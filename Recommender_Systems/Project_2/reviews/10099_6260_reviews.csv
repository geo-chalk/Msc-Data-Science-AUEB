10099,6260,BitteNochEinWeissbier,3.66,"Consumed on: 23 Nov, 2022 Glass: Chalice ABV: 7% ABV Serving Temp: 51.6 F   Look: Dark orange-tinted copper. Thin off-white fizzy head quickly dissipated to a thin ring-and-islands pattern. Lacing is OK.  Smell: Some light (very light) pumpkin aromas but mostly spices. Strong spices. Cinnamon dominates along with ginger and some cloves as well. There is a sugary sweetness underlying these other aromas.  Taste: Follows the nose. The sweetness takes on notes of Candi-sugar and really balances out the spice notes. The ginger becomes the dominate spice in the flavor. The pumpkin is far in the background here. Nutmeg can be detected in the aftertaste.  Feel: Crisp but also a tad syrupy. The body is medium-light, if that.  Overall: I am not a big fan of pumpkin beers, but this is one that I don't mind. Perhaps because the pumpkin flavor and aroma is quite muted. Since I don't drink many pumpkin beers, the spices really do jump out at me.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

10099,6260,dwillie733,3.94,Overall a very good pumpkin beer. Can taste the spices and brown sugar but not overpowering like some pumpkin beers. Will buy the beer again though a little pricey in the midwest.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

10099,6260,1009,4.16,"Pumpkin beers get a lot of hate. We at 1009 are on a mission to combat that narrative. This beer here should silence the critics. A deep brownish red liquid fills the glass giving off caramel and nutty aromatic notes. Taste wise you prepare yourself for the classic “pumpkin pie” in a glass sweetness, but you don’t get it. Rather it’s even better because it is a brown ale accompanied by the pumpkin and cinnamon/nutmeg spice flavors. It doesn’t try to dominate the beer, but instead enhance it. A great cold weather companion that will warm you up at 7% abv.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,TheBricenator,4.03,"Look: Dark amber with red tones and my pour offers up a lively off-white head that billows up and holds as a silky pillow, slowly receding to reveal great lacing left behind Aroma: Roasted pumpkin, cinnamon, warm bread, nutmeg, cloves, a little toffee, pumpkin bread, and brown sugar Taste: Without repeating my aroma notes verbatim, this tastes like liquified spiced pumpkin bread in a glass. Cooked and roasted pumpkin and rich bready malt lead the pack and spices keep filtering in and out of frame through the close Mouthfeel: Full, smooth, medium-high carbonation, soft throughout, and a silky smooth and soft finish Overall: This is some delicious stuff. One of my favorite and first pumpkin beers I ever tried over fifteen years ago and is still well-made and delicious today. Nothing is out of balance here and all the components work beautifully together to make this greater than the sum of its parts.

10099,6260,Perioddicals,3.9,"L - Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a tulip glass. Pours a beautiful clear orange with a 1 finger light tan head that fades down to a film, then a ring. No real lacing to speak of.  S - Scent is caramel malt, with some definite pumpkin. Some nut scents as well.  T - Taste has some spice and metallic flavoring. Pumpkin flavoring is feint at first. No bitterness at all. The general caramel malt is there, but it’s mild at best.  F - Very very smooth, thin beer. Not necessarily watery, but nice. Carbonation is mild.  O - Overall, this a good beer. It’s a brown ale with pumpkin flavoring like the label says. To me, it’s a brown ale, but sweeter…though not sweet. It’s very smooth and easy to drink. Perfect fall beer that I recommend and plan to put in my rotation.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Some caramel aroma to a lesser extent.  Taste: Very nice and a unique taste. I can definitely taste the pumpkin, and there are some spicy flavors which makes for a unique taste.

10099,6260,nicholas2121,4.18,"Punkin Ale brewed by Dogfish Head Craft Brewery, with an ABV of 7.00% This Pumpkin Beer pours out of a glass bottle into a pint beer glass. The color is a deep golden amber color with a nice white head. There is also a nice amount of lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell is Rich with Pumpkin an Spices. Some of the spices are cinnamon pumpkin nutmeg an others. You also pick up a nice amount of grains an malts in the small as well. So far Punkin Ale is a nice inviting brew. Now for the taste, it is Bold with pumpkin spice , really puts you in that pumpkin pie state of mind. Not saying that is a bad thing. If you are a fan of pumpkin pie this brew is a must. Just the right amount of spicy, pumpkin mix. There is nothing overpowering about this pumpkin ale, it has a super nice balance to it. It is really hard to pick up on the 7.00% ABV in this brew, it is just that smooth. The body of this brew is a solid medium. The mouth feel is Bold Pumpkin, Sweet, Spicy, Clean, Smooth and Refreshing. Overall I am going to give Punkin Ale a 4.25 out of 5. I would definitely look this brew up again givin the opportunity to.

Stored at home at 40 degrees. Reviewed 19/10/21. Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol. Green ink on neck “Feb 2022”. Served at 45.5 degrees in a hand washed and dried John Smith imperial pint glass. Final temperature 52.7 degrees. Appearance – 4. First pour – Pale gold (SRM 3) with slight greenish tint, clear. Body – Deep gold (SRM 6), faint haze. When rear-lite, same. Head – Large (Maximum six cm, aggressive center pour), darker than floral white and lighter than Dutch white, medium density, average retention, diminishing to a three mm crown and a complete cap with a few rocks. Lacing – Poor. A few drag marks as the level drops. Aroma – 3.75 – Light pumpkin spices, predominantly clove and allspice, no malt, no hops, no yeast, no pumpkin. Flavor – 3.25 – Flavor follows nose - no yeast, no malt, lightly sweet and no hops. No ethanol (7 % ABV, as marked on container) taste or aroma. No gastric warming. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. Palate – 3.5 – Thin, watery, soft carbonation. Final impression and summation: 3.5 Billed as “Brown ale brewed with pumpkin and spices” but there are darn few brown ale characteristics and the pumpkin appears imaginary.

It was still typical of other pumpkin beers but I'd get this again for sure,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,PathofChaos,3.49,"Appearance: Pure, translucent amber with a finger of off-white fizz that bolts quicker than a politician faced with a lie detector.  Bouquet: Stale gourd husk with a cinnamon stick lodged up its buttocks far enough to be considered “distant.” The sad introduction is a forgivable offense because, as it airs, it exudes a mild aroma of sweet yams baked in butter and warming, fall spices.  Feel: A slick yet girthy medium distinguished by fine, champagne bubbles and a comfy, long-lingered, pumpkin finish.  Taste: Like being lured into a cozy, life-sized gingerbread house by the scent of fresh pumpkin pie… only to be knocked senseless by a cannibal witch with a tire iron: Starts with pumpkin pie filling on a gingerbread pie crust that’s abruptly interrupted by a savagely acrid, burnt copper aftertaste. This unwanted assault slowly desists as the beer airs but d@mned if it ain’t a horrible first impression… blegh.  Overall: Let it breathe or pay the price. Don't wait too long though, gotta drink it while its still cold. Very nice once those harsh introductions are over.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Then the sweetness comes, it's mellow and squashy.  The mouthfeel is thin and there's plenty of carbonation.  The finish is where it really feels like Fall.  Pumpkin and warming spices.  This is so good.  It's balanced, subtle and nuanced.  I give it a 5.1 out of 6.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Attractive tiny rising bubble show. A nearly full wall of lacing follows down the body. Aroma of toasted malts layered with pumpkin spices and brown sugar. Taste is a well balanced blend of toasted malts, brown sugar and pumpkin spices. Gives off a gourd vibe. Medium mouth feel. Good, supportive carbonation.

Pumpkin is the most notable note while the nuts, malts, and nutmeg provide a backbone with the sweetness of the cinnamon and brown sugar. Body is medium-light.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,ThrewRedButter,3.49,"Look – Transparent copper body with two fingers of off-white head.  Aroma – Nutty aroma with big cinnamon and brown sugar. Pumpkin is solid throughout, but I am digging the toasted malts from the base brown ale  Taste – Pumpkin shines much brighter here and it is the dominant flavor…perhaps too dominant. It’s all I can really taste. Some subtle spice notes try to fight their way to the front of the line, but the pumpkin just keeps pushing it back. Not saying it’s bad tasting, not at all, but it is a one trick pony on the taste  Mouthfeel – Nice and full. Medium carbonation. Good lingering pumpkin flavors.  Overall – I wish the taste had more diversity, but hey, the pumpkin fans will like it. At 7% it is bigger than most standard pumpkin beers, but it still shouldn’t be a challenge for even the most casual beer drinkers to put down.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

With it came, surprisingly, very little of the spicy aroma expected from this style. That's not such a bad thing. No noteworthy head nor glass lacing. The taste is of a pleasant brown ale, with but not entirely overwhelmed, by pumpkin pie spices. Pumpkin was likely the starch used when English settlers made their first beers in the New World. It's very unlikely that any of the spices we now associate with pumpkin were included in the mix. Unfortunately, they're noticable in this beer.

The nose is fragrant with aromas of pumpkin, brown sugar, nutmeg, and clove. There is also a buttery malt that is reminiscent of pie crust. The taste opens with fairly strong clove and nutmeg with milder notes of pumpkin. There is also a strong malty backbone. While it's initially quite sweet, there is a surprising bitterness that starts mid-palate and remains to the finish. It's clean and crisp with pleasant carbonation, and it's easily drinkable at 7% ABV.

Initial lacing looks imperfect. Body is more of a dark orange than brown, nearly crystal clear, almost no bubbles coming up. Looks sub par so far.  Nose is surprisingly heavy on nutmeg, brown sugar is present as well, a little bit of pumpkin which starts to dominate as the aroma opens up over time. Getting some fruity notes as well, orange, maybe from the allspice. Smells on the sweeter side, almost perfume like, but well attenuated. Pretty nice, balanced, aromatic.  Flavor is centered much more on earthy pumpkin. Spices linger in the background, with some sweetness. Balanced, flavorful, authentic, solid.  Mouthfeel is pretty standard. Carbonation is high, very lively. Body is medium. Sugars are present, but generally well attenuated and it drinks pretty crisp - balanced. Bitterness is not noticeable. On par for a major craft brewery.  Drinkability is pretty high, it’s tasty and not cloying.  Appearance turned out somewhat poor. A little rim of foam lasted all the way down the glass, but the head overall was average, and accompanied by no lacing.

The brew has a restrained but sweet aroma, with plenty of pumpkin spice and honey/brown sugar.  Sweet on the tip of the tongue; caramel malts and brown sugary sweetness. In midstream, the spice rack arrives. It ends up a little ""muddy"" as a result--like when you put a little too much dry herbs or spices into something. The close is just a touch boozy and provides some welcome earthy/grassy bitterness. I didn't find this as sweet-toothy as some others have.  Medium full bodied. Smooth and creamy yet with a touch of drying at the finish.  Overall, it has some great aggressive notes on the palate, but there is so much spice that no one spice note can get enough breathing room to clarify what it is. It's just ""punkin pie spice"" on overload.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,Amendm,3.97,"A sturdy pour is needed to reach a finger of short lived fizzy white foam, no lasting lace, typical of the style. Chill haze clears to a bright and almost clear light orange amber body, a few small bubbles rise and form a lasting ring.  Not a lot to the nose, pale malt and a candied melon sweetness with pumpkin pie spice are faint.  Neutral on sweetness with average bitterness, crisp with a pumpkin-cider boldness. The spice (big on cinnamon) cancels the pumpkin sweetness but doesn't overpower it. Crystal malt breaks away from the melon sweetness of the smell, pumpkin gets a chance to be noticed as a spicy/peppery bite develops late in the taste and stretches the finish and the aftertaste.  Lighter bodied, carbonation is soft and reserved. Alcohol is well hidden. Very well balanced and true to style. This Beer transcends the Ale/Lager boundary.

Taste follows the aroma to a tee, with pumpkin spice meshed with toasty caramel malts, nutmeg, cinnamon, and lightest notes of earthy, roasted coffee rounding the profile out.  Mouthfeel is just a shade shy of medium bodied with moderate, semi-spritzy/semi-gritty carbonation; largely dry across the mid-palate into the finish, with touches of sweetness and roasty char appearing throughout.

Yet I try it every year, hoping it will return to its original brilliance. Yet it never does.  Quite simply, it's a very rugged-tasting pumpkin ale compared to the top 10 offerings. And alcohol seeps through it, like most pumpkin ales, even the very best. I feel pumpkin ale brewers must overcome this challenge like the IPA brewers have done.  Edit: A few days later, I pull this beer from the fridge and it smells and tastes almost totally different. I can smell and taste the pumpkin, as though it was somehow magically fresher than last time. Good grief.;)",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Even though the pumpkin taste is there, it fades very quickly to a standard ale/Oktoberfest taste. The beer is light, crisp, and refreshing. It’s a solid beer, but I’m left wishing it had a bolder, more lingering pumpkin taste to it. Hints of roasted malts, brown sugar, and cinnamon can be tasted, and there’s even a sweet almost fruity taste that I can’t pinpoint.

The aroma is very pleasant, amber grains, caramel, nutmeg, pumpkin, pie spicing but with a nice nuttiness underneath. The flavors are good, smooth and toasted amber grains, caramel and brown sugar with a really ample fall spice character, soft pumpkin pie with a little nutty character of the underlying brown ale. The mouthfeel is good, coating and lively medium body that is smooth and full with a soft finish.  Verdict: A nice pumpkin beer from Dogfish Head.

Medium texture with balancing carbonation.  Pumpkin beers in general, to my tasting, have a routine sort of pattern as of course they must emphasize pumpkin in some way which may result in a single dimension sort of flavor, especially ones that get carried away with the spices.

Its fairly clear and produces a finger of off white head which dissipates rather quickly. Additionally, something I rarely mention is artwork, but the 2018 label is gorgeous. Aroma: Vegetal pumpkin, some spices, and a good strong caramel malt backbone. Clove sticks out most among the spices, a yeast aroma is also present. Surprisingly, there isn’t a ton of brown sugar sweetness either. Taste: Big toasted brown ale malt flavors up front, a little pumpkin flavor, some pumpkin spices, which are thankfully used conservatively. The pumpkin pie qualities are all here, but this is a more subtile take on the style. Punkin’ has a medium full mouthfeel and does get a little sweeter as it warms, but its still no sugar bomb. The style helps to beef this beer up, negating the need for over spicing or sweetening. A very pleasant, if unremarkable pumpkin infused brown ale. Biased comments: I believe using a brown ale as the base produced better more rounded beer that also more closely resembles actual pumpkin pie than the pumpkin ales I’ve come across.

You will smell the nutmeg and a little pumpkin, but the taste is disappointingly flat. Dfh was a pioneer of pumpkin, but my opinion and the opinion of others I know is that this recipe changed. Something is drastically different from Punkin of old. It used to be better. We don’t know if it has to do with pumpkins or something else, but it’s been a topic of discussion. There are many many far better pumpkin beers on the market in my opinion, once’s with more prominent pumpkin and spice. That said, one thing has never changed and that is DFH Punkin is the best Punkin to make chili with. Again, I don’t know why but I have tried many other pumpkin beers and there is no better beer than dfh Punkin to make chili with. So all is not lost.

Thin half finger white head fades after a minute or so however there is almost a thin blanket of bubbles lingering on top.  S: Smells of spices, nutmeg, clove, allspice and cinnamon.

Carbonation could be seen rising at a moderate pace to fill a quickly dissipating finger's worth of white foamy head that left barely any lace. The aroma had a soft blend of the pumkin flesh, some bready malts and a blend of nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon, and ginger. The flavor leaned slightly sweet initially through the pumpkin flesh and breadiness and developed a nice blend of the previously mentioned spices. Semi-crisp sort of flesh-like sweetness and spices embrace the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was between light and medium bodied with a great sessionability about it. Carbonation felt fine playing with the entire feel and aligning appropriately with the ABV.

Color is a warm, semi-hazy orange, or at least my color blind ass thinks so.  Small retisicient head with a splash of lacing here and there that falls down into the pumpkin ale from time to time.  Smell is a light malt with a faint pumpkin to it, I'm sure had I grabbed it earlier it would've been much more in your face. That being said there is something warming, calm, and refreshing about the suggestion of pumpkin in the ale. Goes down extremely smooth and tastes great.  Really balanced, safe beer and with an autumn cheer. It is a very unartificial pumpkin flavor that resides in the back of the mouth. Light malts to help guide you to the flavor.

Favorite out of the group.  2015: Had a funky taste to it. Very earthy with a bit of clove and pumpkin pie spices. Had the lowest carbonation with a surpringly thicker feel. Least favorite of the group.  2016: Light citrus notes. Most amount of spice: cinnamon and lots of clove/nutmeg. A slight hoppiness in the finish. It had the most carbonation. Rated second best.

Taste - it's so balanced and smooth that you almost don't notice any notes, but if you let it sit for a moment, you get nutmeg, some cinnamon, brown sugar, and there is a perceptible pumpkin note that doesn't taste artificial. Feel - creamy body, dry finish, moderate carbonation. Overall, I'm most impressed by the mouthfeel of this beer; it really helps this beer stand out as something special.

Smell: Like a Thanksgiving setup with all the fixings and the associated spices, not necessarily pumpkin or pumpkin pie though, which it doesn't claim to be. Also sweet smelling, like the brown sugar... which comes through on the tasting too. Ground nutmeg and clove and pumpkin are the other dominant flavors with some bread notes and no notable hops. Feel: Not what I was expecting but very good... crisp, refreshing like biting into an apple, yet soft and sort of creamy after that. If you let it linger on your palate long enough you get some pumpkin mouthfeel, but it is not extravagant by any means.

10099,6260,hoptheology,2.77,"2016.  Toasted grain color with tints of blonde and clean chestnut, with a creamy head of 3 fingers. 20% opaque. Lighter than I thought it'd be as it's advertised as a brown ale.  I'm getting some nuttiness, with lots of clean aromas of malts and grain only slightly dirty by the brown sugar and faint spices that may or may not be detected depending on the depth of the breathing. Kind of detecting the cinnamon now as I breathe deeper.  And again I'm perplexed by another Pumpkin beer flavor profile. It's not even good. Very malty flavors dominate, with some nuttiness and hay following; some paper; leaving a pale, chalky and bitter chemical finish. Some light toffee or molasses sweetness towards the finish. Honestly if I didn't pay for it I'd probably dump it on the grass (yes this is outside on a balmy, beautiful fall night).  The feel is slightly creamy, but with a bump of carbonation, and hell I guess it ends up finishing slightly dry. Whatever.  Overall, I feel this overwhelming urge to get up and dump it in the sink.

I've been drinking every pumpkin beer I can find lately seeing how they stack up to each other, favorite so far being Cigar City's ""Good Gourd"" or perhaps Big Top's ""Pumpkin Stiltskin"". This one's among the less impressive so far, it's labeled a Brown Ale but tastes more like a musty Pilsner with some IPA tang on top, not what I'm looking for in either a sweet n spicy pumpkin beer nor a round mellow Brown Ale.

A clear, orange colored brew reminiscent to a light-pumpkin color, it pours a thick, white head with some staying power and good lacing down the glass. The smell from this beer actually surprised me - it was horrible. It reminded me of a cigarette ash or the smell that emanates from the said tray. I hate to say, I almost considered pawning this off on my son, but I decided to give it a go (and I was glad I did.) The mouthfeel was one of the more complex ones I have come across. It starts coarse then become smooth and then almost watery in texture, but not quite. A very complex feel for me across the board. I noted the pumpkin, some spice and other flavors (thankfully no cigarette ash) and though good, not better than other pumpkin brews I have had. Overall, it's a good beer.

Smell: Smells like pumpkin pie or pumpkin bread. Pumpkin and spices are present without being overstated. Notes of cinnamon, raisin, alcohol. Not much hop aroma.

I wonder no longer... The smell had some light pumpkin hitting what seemed like a cream ale sort of base. Pie-like crustiness leads in and subtly combines with some vanilla. The taste was mainly sweet through the pumpkin, vanilla and pie-like crustiness of the cream ale features. A pumpkin flavored aftertaste runs in and leads in a sticky finish.

The pumpkin stands out a little more here, as does the cinnamon. It's also got a hint of bitter, roasted flavor that stands out more than the younger one.  2015 tastes just as I'd have expected from the smell. A hint sweet, nicely and evenly spiced, and silky smooth with a good amount of carbonation that reminds you that it's still a good beer and not just a gimmick. Likewise, 2014's flavor echoes the scent well. Definitely richer, heavier pumpkin flavor.

10099,6260,Dello,3.05,"Punkin Ale was poured into a short ribbed glass from a (recently outlawed) can-type-growler from Big Hops in San Antonio, TX.  Appearance: an intriguing bold orange colored body with one-finger head.  Fragrance: extremely mild notes of spices.  Taste: extremely subtle graham cracker and pumpkin spice flavor that evaporates quickly. I also found a chalky, medicinally sweet aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: surprisingly thin yet crisp mouthfeel with a slightly lingering sting.  Overall: a bit disappointing. That being said, I am not the biggest fan of spiced beers and do not have loads of brown ale favorites. However, I was blown away by how drinkable the beer was with such a high ABV. I found the beer very boring while being equally relaxing and drinkable. I would love to try this beer again on draft or bottle to see if my opinion changes.

Smells of pumpkin spice/ nutmeg, some lightly sweet brown sugar/ gingerbread/ malts. Taste like the smell's description, but less like a brown ale and more like a spiced ale. Mineral aspect to this too. Feels medium crisp, warming and mildly dry. I'm not a pumpkin ale type, and I love all efforts from this great brewery. I just enjoy many of their other seasonals more. I'd rather like to see them try an imperial brown ale with this pumpkin addition, because I figure if you're going to go all-out on the spice ingredients and pumpkin meat with so much of that flavor, the gravity and richness may as well be elevated as well.

I'm primarily judging this beer from comparison to other Pumpkin beers and from DFH's own description on the bottle, which follows: ""A full-bodied brown ale"" NOT! It's a light-bodied, overly carbonated at that, pale-amber ale. ""Brewed with real pumpkin, brown sugar, allspice, cinnamon & nutmeg."" Tastes like it too - MUDDY. Why all three spices? There is a lot going on just with the malts, pumpkin and brown sugar... The Look is brilliantly clear like all other mass produced crap. This is a specialty ale, why filter so? Smell... I didn't care for it, but maybe it is suppose to smell that way. I saved the worst for last - the label..

10099,6260,dd43,3.88,"This is just a straight up good ale from Dogfish Head. The first aromas that hit me were a vegetal smell of the pumpkin, and a baking spice medley (cinnamon, clove, nutmeg). This beer looks great in the glass, nice creamy off white head and a hazy appearance that makes you think you're about to drink a meal. The brown sugar and pumpkin pie spices are nicely attenuated. This beer is not a spice bomb like so many seasonal pumpkin beers are relegated to. The finish is really appealing, mouth coating but not too heavy.

S: Caramel malt with a toasty hint of holiday sweetness. Brown sugar and nutmeg. Faint floral/piney smell, perhaps coriander.  T: Wow. Absolutely outstanding. You get a very warm spiced flavor right up front, like a warm biscuity alcohol flavor. Then it slowly mellows into a soft yet still spicey blend of cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, and, of course, pumpkin. Wraps up with a crisp hint of malt and pine. Very well blended flavor, good drink through with a melange of flavors to enjoy.  F: Unique feel to it. Very warm, sometimes dry and tingly, but also soft, delicate, sweet, and a bit chewy. Complex no question. I usually don't consider feel all too much, but this one stood out.  O: Phenomenal pumpkin ale. I am exceptionally impressed by this one. Pumpkin ales are pretty hit and miss, and this one is definitely a hit. Surprisingly complexity that is well blended. The alcohol taste up front might set a few people down, but when worked in as a whole from bitter, to spicy, to sweet, it makes for a tremendous drink through.

The taste at first had a slight pumpkin spice flavor to it, but now I'm not picking it up at all, really. It has a nice sweet, malty taste, but not that pumpkin flavor that I'm craving.

10099,6260,Raime,3.77,"DogFish Head Punkin Ale.  This one is officially the oldest on my wants list as it sits. Wanted it years ago before I took a break from the crafts but never wanted to pay the $15 four-pack price. Now that they have dropped the price quite a bit and I found it in a single, I am quite excited for it.  Look - Pours a true amber copperish color with a two finger slightly off white head that jumps down to a well kempt cloud formation on the top of the drink, leaving a thick well retained ring around the perimeter. Carbonation appears to be on medium with this guy. Looks pretty much as you'd expect for the style thus far. Lacing is not a factor as the head didn't end up retaining as well as I though it would. 4.  Smell - hmm...well this is new. The malts are all there and dominate over the pumpkin and fall spices. Almost smells like a Graham cracker pulled fresh from the packet. Moderate tinge of cinnamon upon the embrace of a hard whiff, but overall remaining dominated by the malt and cracker levels. 3.75.  Taste - Doesn't change much in this aspect. The Graham cracker notability dominates the majority of the flavor. Not really getting a ton of pumpkin but that isn't necessarily a bad thing as too much can OD your taste buds. As it warms, you are introduced to a new flavor you won't find anywhere else. Ever have roasted pumpkin? Well if not, here it is. All those malts are still there though they take a back seat and even ride shot gun for a few moments upon the inhaled sit. Should also mention that this is one alcoholic heavy pumpkin beer. Only 7%? Coulda fooled me for a 12-14% honestly. 3.75.  Feel - Body is very, very full and highly carbonated with more alcohol upon the tongue than the ABV with let you on to believe. Flavors remains mostly the same although the cracker aspect becomes more pronounced without the burning sensation of overly-spicyness from the fall spices. 3.75.  Overall - Well.......This is one of the toughest rates I have ever had to do. Very solid and different, though perhaps a bit too different for the pumpkin ale traditionalist. Better than a lot of the weaker offerings, but I certainly cannot say it is a favorite. Weyerbacher did the complex boozyness and pumpkin flavor balance farrrrr better than this one. But, that one pulled a 4.45. So again, very solid, but not amazing. 3.75.  This one was a direct split between a 4 on everything and a 3.75.

There's a boozy component in there as well. Spiced rum? Admittedly, I just had a sneezing fit and my sniffer seems a bit off.  The malt takes over on the flavor profile (this _is_ a brown ale at the end of the day) and tastes like a sweet (but not overly so), spicy desert biscuit. Spice lingers on the tongue well after sipping.  Medium-bodied mouthfeel and a lot dryer than your average pumpkin ale. Me likey.  I always look forward to this one.

The ingredients used and listed on the bottle all show up front and center and smell quite good. Really good take on the pumpkin beer style, it smells like a real pie.  Tastes like it smells but the spices are more pronounced as the allspice comes out and joins the cinnamon, nutmeg, pepper and brown sugar; seems like coriander and cumin join the party too. Very bready with the pie crust/biscuit/wheat bread and wet cardboard yeast notes following the spices, then shifting to tea leaf, dry flowers and hops which add some balance yet let the spices and malt continue to trick your palate into thinking that this liquid bread is a pumpkin pie.  Mouthfeel is thin and watery with fizzy carbonation and a body that's a little lighter than average; it hides the ABV completely with the spices and flows down easy, finishing spicy and full of malt and pumpkin.

Aroma: Very pumpkin-y and spicy. Tons of brown sugar, cinnamon, all-spice and nutmeg. Strong notes of malt and freshly baked ginger bread too, however, not much in the way of hops.

10099,6260,JohnnyI,3.49,"Hmmm.... a full bodied ""brown ale""... not so sure about that. Despite the misleading description, it has a remarkably pleasant appearance. It is jubilantly orange, with an inviting glow when it catches the light. In fact, the playful and vibrant orange color is the attribute I enjoyed the most about this beer. Not far behind is the aroma. The spices and pumpkin meat meld in to an alluring symphony. My wife declared that it is ""mouth-watering"". She's not even a big beer drinker. As for the taste....This is a little bit on the cloying side with an initial sugary sweetness, followed by a harsh spicing regimen that sticks to the palate and never quite meshes coherently. The phenolic clove characteristics seem to override the malt presence and compete with a boozy fusel alcohol that rides through the whole experience. The pumpkin flavor is struggling to come through, as are the bready malts, but they get whacked in to submission by the booze and spice. Although not offensive, it's simply not the best-tasting pumpkin ale I've had. Not by a long shot. That said, the mouthfeel is quite nice. Creamy, perfectly carbonated with medium viscosity. Overall, this is a decent representation. I wonder if this beer would age well, perhaps mellowing some of the sharper edges with the spice and alcohol. Perhaps this one would be better with a slightly lower ABV? It's rare that I would suggest going smaller, but in this case, I feel like the higher gravity detracts from the beer. As with most quality brews, as it warmed and through the middle of the glass, the flavor profiles came together a bit more. Worth a try for sure, especially if you like palate-wrecking spiced beers. A tad overrated in my humble opinion. If you want a big pumpkin beer, try Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin. Of course, there's always Pumking for the over-the-top pumpkin experience. Personally, I recommend Smuttynose if you can get it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

T: Great combinations of sweet and warm malt, with pumpkin coming in afterwards and a light punch of holiday spices; nutmeg, allspice, fainter cinnamon. There is an unfortunate waft of wet dog every once in a while, but if you use your imagination you can make it seem like another layer of malt.  M: Smooth and thick, almost like melted ice cream.

Malty brown sugar and caramel flavors with some nice blending of pumpkin pie spices. The spices become more prominent the more I drink it and linger for a while after each sip.  Has a lighter mouthfeel and quite a bit of carbonation that gets in the way of the pumpkin pie aspect of the beer for me.  This is one of the better offerings in this style, but doesn't quite match the quality of my favorite pumpkin beers.

On the backend of this alcohol aroma, I detect a slight biscuity malt. Taste- malt forward, bread and somewhat doughy. The pumpkin flavor is there as are the spices. Well hopped but not intensely, the spices and hops act as balancing agents. The finish has an herbal and semi dry feel. Feel- medium bodied and doughy in the mouthfeel.

Lots of spice initially with pumpkin notes & sweetness. The alcohol content is well hidden & the aroma is well balanced with some bread but is the spices that dominate with cinnamon, nutmeg & various others featuring.  Spicy with some cinnamon & nutmeg alongside the sugar & pumpkin, there's a strong malt presence with bread & background fruits as well. Some hops make an appearance with hints of alcohol but these aren't the strongest with toasted malts & background fruits at the end.  Medium bodied with above average carbonation & a nice spicy feel to the beer that was tangy & had a good balance. The beer was quite easy to drink & smooth with a dry finish.  Easily the best pumpkin beer I've tried thus far & an excellent all round offering that falls short of being a classic but is very drinkable. Starting off quite spicy, I was initially fearful that this one would end up like some other pumpkin beers I've tried (namely Pumpkinhead from Brewdog) but thankfully this one was a lot more balanced & enjoyable, definitely one I'd pick up each year if it were available here in the UK.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,kemoarps,3.81,"3.25/4/3.75/4/3.75 For a supposedly brown ale converted to pumpkin, this is awfully light. Light amber body, large bubbles form the initial head, but dissipates almost immediately leaving nothing whatsoever on top OR on side. No mullet here!  As soon as I pop the top, the sweet spice notes start. Mmmmm.... I get sweet vanilla, some brown sugar, pumpkin, bready malts, and some allspice. The pumpkin is less pumpkin pie sweet and more meaty, like carving pumpkins, or more like pumpkin seeds tossed with brown sugar and vanilla (never done that particular combo, but this is making me think it might be pretty tasty...)  The taste starts off with a bit of that same vanilla, though less pronounced than the nose. pumpkin meat really comes in at the end, with bits of gourd-onic sweet-ish throughout the middle levels. A little bit of spice, and an almost honey-like finish. Again, the brown base declines to introduce itself, opting instead for an almost reddish (but softer) body. The malts are really soft and accessible. Smoothe finish, largely sweet with a soft finish and just a touch of bitter. Caresses rather than cloying  I feel like this is solid, if not particularly gourdbreaking. I actually prefer having a softer, sweeter base, as I don't have a particularly strong affinity for the sharper malts/amber base that a lot of pumpkins seems to use.

10099,6260,BeerHistoryGuy,4.75,"Appearance: A surprise -- very clear with orange to amber color. Little bit of lacing with a thin white head.  Aroma: Terrific mix of spices (fall spices, like nutmeg, cinnamon, etc.)  Taste: I was surprised. It didn't taste like a true pumpkin ale, in that the pumpkin taste was very subtle..comes in afterwards. The hops balanced well with plenty of fall spices, and the subtle pumpkin/fruitiness at the end rounded out the taste very well.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, with a good amount -- just right - of carbonation. Very smooth beer, all in all.  Overall: For me, this was a fantastic beer all around. I have very little bad to say about it, other than that I almost wonder if the name should be more like an ""autumn beer,"" or ""fall brew,"" or something like that, rather than a pumpkin beer -- although pumpkin surely comes in at the end. Still, I'm giving it a 4.75/5 so I'm searching for an issue, here. In reality, It's the type of beer that would compliment a heart beef stew and work perfectly on a cold late-autumn day. The spices, hops, and carbonation are all perfect for me in this and the hint of pumpkin makes it that much better.

10099,6260,Agent1,4.4,"It took me over 5 years to acquire this little puppy. Pretty excited to give this a taste!  Appearance - Not quite as full-bodied as I anticipated. I assumed this would be a much richer, darker ""brown ale"", similar to the Dogfish Indian Brown Ale or Palo Santo in terms of color. Instead, this is quite amber and bright orange in color. Not necessarily a bad thing, per se, just not as malty as I had originally hoped for. Head dissipates almost immediately. No head after a few minutes. Bubbly inside the glass.  Smell - All spice is quite prevalent on the nose. Cinnamon is detectable, yet faint and subtle. Nice and not overbearing.  Taste - Nice and subtle tastes going on here. Pumpkin is light, fermented brown sugar, caramel, molasses, rum, subtle cinnamon, all spice (heavier than other spices, also on the nose). Not detecting much nutmeg. Nice medium malt body. Lightly hoppy and the hops compliment everything else without taking away from the pumpkin and spices.  Mouthfeel - Surprisingly well carbonated given how flat this beer looks in the glass. Nice and bubbly and the sugars move all throughout the palate.  Overall - Balanced and easy drinking. GOES GREAT WITH HOMEMADE PUMPKIN PIE. I have a feeling that this may be the point of this Pumpkin Ale: to be a session beer that goes down easy, and in turn, multiples can be enjoyed. It's also a beer that most people can appreciate, including non-beer lovers. Very broad in its approach. Again, this is not nearly as bold as I thought it might be. Sam usually likes to push the envelope with his beers, but this one holds back. Still nicely balanced and nothing to complain about! However, I would have to be honest and say, it is a SLIGHT disappointment for me personally given that it doesn't differ too much when comparing it to other pumpkin ales on the market.

10099,6260,kellyej,3.8,"This beer is a fall classic. On the pumpkin beer spectrum that ranges from pumpkin pie to gourd in flavor, Punkin is certainly more toward the gourd side. It is very subtle, especially compared to other popular pumpkin beers like Souther Tier. This allows the beer to be totally sessionable while still giving some of the spicy fall notes people look for in pumpkin beers. Punkin pours a beautiful golden amber color with a wispy, foamy head. It is also quite clear.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

10099,6260,StoneTSR,3.69,"APPEARANCE: The color is not what one might expect from a “full-bodied brown ale”. In fact, it is a bright, but hazy orange color. A half-finger of white head rises and falls within seconds of the initial pour. A layer of wispy foam remains, covering most of the surface of the beer. Quite a few bubbles can be seen popping up towards the surface at varying speeds, giving this beer a nice, lively look.  SMELL: Now the “brown ale” piece of this is coming through with a fair amount of roasted malt aromas that make up the majority of the smell. Just underneath that roast, though, is a very strong pumpkin smell…and not the fake, pumpkin pie smell (which I often like), this is the real deal, pumpkin smell. Some pie spices flirt with the nose as well, but they are subtle.  TASTE: The roast flavors match the aromas in intensity and, for this beer, dominate the flavor profile for me. And again, the true pumpkin flavor comes in right underneath it, but this time the spices are closer to the front and center than in the nose. The heavy roast also brings out what is almost a woody flavor, along with a touch of vanilla.  MOUTHFEEL: Medium-bodied and on the sweet side for an average beer, but a little dry for many Pumpkins on the market. There is a touch of stickiness on the front end, but it certainly dries while going down.  OVERALL: Dogfish Punkin is a pretty solid beer. I do appreciate that I can detect a lot more actual pumpkin flavor and aroma than in most others, but I would appreciate a little more sweet and spice. I’m sure many people out there may prefer this, however.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Taste: Lots of spice, very reminiscent of a winter warmer (GLBC Christmas Ale in particular). The pumpkin itself is almost undetectable, though there are definitely some fruity undertones.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied, has a nice crisp carbonation but also a slightly syrupy feel.  Overall: As the label says, this really is a perfect beer to warm up with. Spices are front and center, so fortunately they are excellently blended and really match up with the platonic idea of pumpkin pie.

The beer lets in lots of light. Very strong carbonation. Big frothy white head with decent retention. Little to no cling in the glass while the drink is being imbibed. Aroma: The aromas are mild in comparison to the other pumpkin beers I've tried this summer and fall. I get nice aromas of allspice, clove, nutmeg. The pumpkin seems to come out very nicely as well. Brown sugar also plays a nice role. Taste: A very mellow blend of the spices and pumpkin comes together. Something is hitting me close to vanilla but in reality it is probably sugars (brown).

Very present, but (thankfully) not overwhelming. Taste: Taste follows nose closely, but with greater emphasis on the vegetal and slightly green flavor of the pumpkin. Malt is predominantly sweet and compliments the spices. Pumpkin is most present on the aftertaste, coming through as an earthy, slightly sweet and fermented flavor. Slight hops bitterness on the aftertaste also kills the sweet, which lets the more delicate flavors come through.

10099,6260,Jadjunk,3.91,"""A full-bodied brown ale brewed with real Pumpkin, brown sugar, allspice, cinnamon & nutmeg."" Brewed in the style of a Pumpkin Ale. Bottled in 2012. Dogfish Head's fall seasonal, available in 12 oz. 4 packs and on draft. In this vertical review, I will be comparing a 2013 vintage to a 2012 vintage.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle to a pint glass. Served north of 56º Fahrenheit.  (Appearance) Pours a foamy cream eggnog-white head over a body of medium-hazy copper orange with high clarity. Retention is about average. Lacing is light and spotty but doesn't stick. 3.75  (Smell) I don't often get very pumpkin-forward pumpkin ales so when my first note was sweet roasted pumpkin I was pleasantly surprised. A nearly ripe pumpkin meat with a mild toasted maple syrup and brown sugar sweetness and a light, smooth bready malt backbone. The spice presence is moderate with nods to mild cinnamon, allspice and cloves, it's just enough to accent the pumpkin and malt character without overshadowing the entire concoction. Hops are low in potency by comparison, some herbal notes. Potency is moderate. 4  (Taste) Mellow, ripe pumpkin sweetness with a light bready caramel malt base. Most of the sweetness originates through the pumpkin and a slighter amount from the brown sugar sweetness, although overall it is a bit lighter than the aroma suggested. The spice profile is still quite mild, with allspice and nutmeg the prevailing spice accents, but both very minute compared to more liberally spiced autumn ales. A mildly acidic grain astringency roughens out the dry finish. 3.75  (Mouthfeel) Texture is smooth, full and mostly clean. Carbonation contributes mildly to a fluffy mouthfeel. Body is medium for the style, medium+ overall. Balance is mildly in favor of sweetness over bitter spice and grainy tones. Alcohol presence is light. 4.25  (Overall) This beer does a fair job at showcasing in-season, full pumpkin flavor and sweet malt character over many other commonly available pumpkin beers. Spice character is very relaxed as well, which I find more preferable over beers that are spiced too aggressively. The balance is favorable to sweetness, although the balance is close, keeping drinkability nearly as high for the style as possible. This is one of the more enjoyable pumpkin ales out there. Recommended as a fall seasonal go-to. 4  2012 vintage (1 year, 6 months aged):  Pours a slightly paler head, retention is the same and body appearance is very similar despite the inclusion of flecked sediment. The age has rounded out the sweetness of this beer somewhat, with a pleasant pumpkin aroma, by now turning a little raw, as well as a clean, simple pale malt profile. Spices are just as potent as before, but perhaps come through a little more intense in comparison with the faded aspects of this vintage. Even more profound an impact is the body of this beer, whereas the fresher vintage has a rather muted sweetness, the maple and brown sugar come through quite strongly in this vintage, generating a pleasant sweetness. The spice profiles are very faint, whereas the pumpkin body and malt bill rounds out in their profiles rather than diminishing. I find the flavor of this vintage on par with the new batch. The texture is similar, perhaps a touch fuller in body and slightly sweeter in balance with no noticeable off-flavors. It would be worth your while to set a single bottle aside and try with a year of age as the results are nearly on par, and in some circumstances preferable to the fresh batch.

GLASSWARE: Kisatsky Tavern pint...OCCASION: it's me (Vernon Davis) and an 18-point lead against Steven Jackson and Tony Gonzalez for the fantasy championship... APPEARANCE: solid, warm amber body; steady effervescence; nice two-finger head; cloudy white and consistent, attractive lacing... AROMA: cinnamon, allspice and hazel nut front and center; a veritable pumpkin pie in a glass, at least by its smell... PALATE: medium-bodied but feisty--not the usual walk-in-the-ho-hum-fall-forest body of a brown; aftertaste is nuanced and bold...TASTE: robust cinnamon overpowers the pumpkin; secondary nutmeg and allspice develop; the cornucopia builds with hazelnut and sugary ginger... OVERALL: I needed a beer big enough to celebrate a win and strong enough to kick in my teeth if I lose--and lose I did with barely a minute to gp in the game.

Slightly more than moderate amounts of lacing are observed.  S: Moderate aromas of sweet pumpkin and pumpkin pie spices (nutmeg and cinnamon) over the top of caramel malts.  T: Upfront there is a moderate flavor of caramel malts with a moderate to significant amount of brown sugar sweetness. That is followed by light flavors of pumpkin and light to moderate flavors of pumpkin pie spices (nutmeg and cinnamon). Hints of bitterness that fades almost immediately.

10099,6260,BethanyB,3.83,"Appearance: A hazy orange, with a filmy, bubbly, light-gold head that does not persist. In other words, a bit of a warning label, but I usually find such things to be subjective false alarms.  Smell: A magical mix of spices takes me back to holidays at my parents' house. Sappy, but true. Cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and other Christmassy flavors you would find in either warm apple cider or a nice mulled wine. With all the spices, it would be nice to have some malt, hops, melanoidins, or esters on the nose, however.  Taste: Holy smokes! A pumpkin ale that actually tastes like pumpkin! Even a nice pie crust flavor comes through. The aforementioned spices are all present, as is an interesting dull bitterness that seems to come from a high amount of toasted malt as opposed to hops. My guess is that a bit of caramel malt would round things out for me a bit more.  Mouthfeel: Medium-light body and medium-high carbonation make this more spritzy than other pumpkin ales. But despite the carbonation and noticeable bitterness, the finish isn't dry. Rather, it's clean and smooth.  Overall: Really, the best pumpkin ale I've had to date, although that isn't saying much since I'm hardly a pumpkin ale fan. Impressed by the well-blended mix of nostalgic spices and the actual presence of pumpkin flavors! However, I do feel there is some room for improvement.

Color is attractive with good head retention, notes of cinnamon and squash on the nose, palate is very odd to me, with notes of spice and gourd, strangely vegetal hops flavor with unpleasantly sweet malt notes reminiscent of artificial maple-flavored syrup, long aftertaste is also unpleasant, with strange vegetal notes.  Would not recommend, which is disappointing given the excellent products made by Dogfish (I enjoy and recommend both their 60- and 90-minute IPAs).  At issue is whether or not my (unpleasant) experience is style-centric or product-centric; nevertheless, based upon this experience, I will not be tasting any pumpkin-styled seasonal beers for a long time.

I'm not sure why people seem to like this so much, there are a lot of other better pumpkins out there that most people have access to. All in all I'd say its slightly above average but only because there are so many breweries out that make a shitty pumpkin beer only trying to cash in on the style. It's worth trying but for the amount you're spending on a 4-pack of this I'd go for a different pumpkin depending on what you have access to.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,Santosizer,2.52,"A - Had this both on tap and in the bottle, very little head, disappears almost immediately. Color was very amber, a dark bronze, tainted orange.  S - Definitely, getting fall/autumn smells, sometimes pleasant and unpleasant notes. Faintly sweet, boozy from the alcohol, definitely pumpkin tones throughout the smell; however, the smell ends with this rotting pumpkin smell that hits the nose going into the throat.  T - This did not taste like it smelled. I will simply list the good and the bad. First the good, malted great, very light in the brown ale taste though; however, it does make up for it in other areas. Tasting this reminded me of carving a pumpkin; very reminiscent of the good things in fall. Now for the bad, I have a big issue with the finish. Very flat on the palate, this initially smells like pumpkin, but definitely no pumpkin presence throughout the drink, no sweetness from the brown sugar, this souring spoiled pumpkin finish, it reminded me of walking into the pumpkin patch and the aroma of rotting pumpkin in the field would unpleasantly hit my tongue.  M - Nicely done in the body, a light to medium bodied beer IMO. This is not full bodied. Very light from the pumpkin, the brown sugar gives off little carbonation, and a slight burning sensation if held on the tongue. The mouthfeel is very nicely done as always from DFHB  Overall - I am very disappointed in myself for giving this brew the rating I have. I love DFHB, I love the lengths they go for their consumers and for their own quality of product. However, this was unpleasant at times. I understand what they went for here, but a pumpkin is a squash, and I know they are very floral when opened, but if you bite into a pumpkin, it is very watery, little to no flavor. I can see the purpose of the brown sugar, but I would have liked to have tasted more of a sweetness throughout the beer. This was completely unbalanced. All in all, I will not be having this again.

The light astringency of the pumpkin goes well with the bitterness in the aftertaste.  M - Medium body and carbonation, just how I like a pumpkin ale.  O - A smooth beer, but overall rather minimal in what it is offering.

10099,6260,Dave128,3.6,"Poured aggressively from a 12 oz bottle into a frosty pint glass. Probably a bit of a mistake since this beer will need to warm up to taste good.  A - Crystal clear amber in color. Head wasn't pronounced on the pour and only a ring remains around the top of the glass. Lacing is pretty low as well.  S - Spices and lots of amber malt - Not too heavy on the pumpkin  T - Complexity is the best part about this beer. It's not particularly pumpkin or spice heavy. You can get a host of different flavors by just swirling it around in your mouth a little bit. At first taste it's nothing special, but it is definitely growing on me (particularly as it warms)  M - A little overcarbonated for the alcohol content and flavors, but suffices  O - A fantastic big fall beer.

Settles into rummy esters with caramel & pumpkin pie spices. It warms the back of the tongue and throat on the back end.  Overall this is an awesome pumpkin brew. I enjoy how playful this beer is. I get nostalgic for mom's kitchen because it could almost be pumpkin pie in a glass. Huge props to Dogfish Head for their seasonal heavy hitter.

10099,6260,magictacosinus,3.91,"Can't believe there's already no bottles left in my distro of this. Oh well, at least I gathered up a few bottles for the season before they all disappeared. Poured out of a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. I do wish the bottling date was a little clearer, but I'd assume the bottle I had was no older than 3 months.  Pours a classic deep amber DFH color (you know, the one that resembles maple syrup) with some strong orange tinges that I'm hoping is from the pumpkin added to the beer. Contains a bone white head that covers the top of the glass, leaving behind minimal lacing overall. Given the beer's relatively high ABV, this swirls around in a slightly viscous manner, but otherwise it's pretty unassuming as far as pumpkin beers go. I'd never guess there was anything unusual in this by merely looking at it.  Hello, holidays! This is a pumpkin ale, all right - less of that sugary, sweetened pumpkin pie-like beers and far more towards maintaining the vegetal essence of the beer backed with spices. Predominant notes of pumpkin rinds, squash, zucchini, and orange peel meld with spices consisting of nutmeg, allspice, brown sugar, cinnamon, and slight pepper and vanilla. Definitely a sharp sweetness from the booze and spices at the finish, but the vegetal character of the beer is very refreshing and delightful in many ways. There's a bit of a caramel, husky sensation that appears at the end, but for some reason so many DFH beers I've had have always provided that flavor. Otherwise, I'm enjoying the fresh pumpkin flavor here overall.  The flavor is nearly on par with the aroma, except that it displays a little bit more fruitiness as well as syrupy sweetness that becomes more present in the finish. At first, there's obvious vegetal notes of toasted pumpkin and squash, which then meld with the brown sugar, cinnamon, baking soda, and nutmeg flavors right at the finish. Orange peel, grapefruit, and pine seem to come in, but the spices are definitely overpowering. The caramel finishes everything off from the grains, but while it works, the aforementioned husky flavor from the grains is still a bit pervasive. Ends a little bit syrupy, with notes of slightly burnt brown sugar, but otherwise this is actually a pretty solid pumpkin beer offering. Feels great, although I do think the spices did some strange things, texture-wise, to the grains at hand. Oh well - I'd imagine pumpkin beers are harder to brew than we take for granted.  Another nice seasonal offering from DFH - from all of the pumpkin beers I've had so far during the holidays, this one is very welcome in my fridge and would work very well with food - especially what people tend to eat during the Thanksgiving holiday season. Vegetal, spicy, and slightly sweet, this is more the direction that I like these kinds of beers to head towards.

10099,6260,MaximalC,2.42,"Pours a mostly transparent copper color with a finger of off-white head that settles slowly. Active carbonation bubbles can be observed ascending within the glass. Aroma smells of pumpkin spices, a vague, caramel sweetness, and some pumpkin as well. The taste features prickly nutmeg, cinnamon, et al. on the front end, which is soon superseded by a nasty, watered-down, metallic juiciness. This is accompanied by a peculiar, chemical bitterness that is neither resinous, floral, peppery, or any other acceptable adjective one might normally attribute to hopping. The finish, which is unmercifully prolonged, features the taste of wheat followed by cloying cinnamon-water. Some alcoholic heat can be detected on the back end as well. The mouthfeel is slightly creamy but overcarbonated, which exaggerates the spices. I finally caught some pumpkin on the vapors that linger between sips. It could very well be there in the middle as well, but if it is, it's buried under so much garbage that it can't be appreciated.  I'm not normally this harsh, but I'm calling a spade a spade--this beer is totally unrefined and borderline amateurish.

A - Pours one finger of good creamy frothy off-white head on top of a dark coppery orange colored body with some nice clarity and lots of bubbles lazily floating topside.  S - Smell comprises much of the usual for the style: cola, cinnamon, allspice. I can even smell a hint of the buttery popcorn smell that appeared in Southern Tier Pumking, presumably from the authentic gourdy pumpkin.  T - Taste follows the nose: crisp cola, brown sugar, cinnamon, hint of allspice, hint of buttery popcorn grains, and just a slight bit of alcohol heat on the finish.  M - Feel is smooth and clean. Just a hint of sticky brown sugar / cola in the aftertaste. Medium to full bodied with nice carbonation.  Overall, definitely a worthwhile pumpkin beer, and one I will continue to look forward to yearly. Good drinkability, and the moderately high alcohol for a pumpkin beer is hardly noticeable.

One finger head that moves quickly to a thin lace.  S- Pumpkin, nutmeg.  T - More pumpkin, a tinge (check) of sugar. Gingerbread.  M - Seems crisp, but full. Carbonation seems low, then spikes and gets prickly mid swig before fading quickly.  O - Decent brew. You can tell it was brewed with ""real pumpkin"".

Smelled and tasted like a great pumpkin ale, but the more I continued to drink, it lost its initial greatness. I tend to prefer a darker, sweeter pumpkin ale, so this beer is a little light for me.  Still, very solid beer and especially for a pumpkin ale. Will buy again if no other new offerings for fall are around.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,BeerMeJohnnyHopkins,4.09,"Overall a very solid pumpkin ale. I don't think it's my favorite, but I'd never be disappointed with a Dogfish Head Punkin. Poured a 12 ounce bottle into a standard pilsner glass.  A- Comes out dark copper with a medium size head that diminishes pretty quickly.  S- The spices don't come out quite as much as some other pumpkins, but obviously it is more distinctive than your typical beer. The malt and sugar take the front seat here.  T- Very smooth, with just the right amount of carbonation, and not so much alcohol that you can taste the 7%. Once again, mostly malt and sugar, and not much in the way of hops. Not overpowering with the pumpkin, which is in my opinion the hardest part of making a pumpkin ale.  M- Nothing particularly special is going on with this beer. Lower carbonation gives it a smooth feel going down. It's particularly dry and the spices stick out, but it's all pleasant.  O- I'm a huge fan of pumpkin ales when they're done right, and DFH has done a superb job on this one. I've had a few others that have a nicer balance and bring out the pumpkin flavor more gracefully, but it remains a seasonal favorite every fall.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

T - Pumpkin spice, nutmeg, caramel, malts, brown sugar.  O - This is a nice pumpkin ale in that it isn't dominated by the pumpkin spices, but rather drinks nicely like a normal ale.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

T: Surprisingly hoppy profile. The pumpkin is there, but it is not abundant. To me this is more of a malty ale than a pumpkin ale. Sweetness from the sugar and hints of pumpkin compliment the malty profile.  F: Medium body and a medium to high level of carbonation  O: Good, and better than most pumpkin ales I have had. Waiting to try Pumpkinatora and Pumpking, but this does not quite match the flavor of Whole Hog Pumpkin.

Slight aroma of Autumn spices, lemon zest, nutmeg, cinnamon and fleshy pumpkin that grows as the beer sits. Slight metallic and herbal hop aroma present but fades as the beer warms.  Relatively clean malt bill with some caramel malt and sweet bread. Spices of cinnamon, brown sugar and clove. Pumpkin is barely detectable in the flavor. Enough grassy light lemon citrus hops there to keep the taste balanced and bright.  Medium bodied and balanced. Active carbonation and very drinkable.  A balanced and refined pumpkin ale. Highlights spices and the clean malt bill more than the pumpkin. Look forward to this one every year.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Appearance in glass was an attractive light brown with orange highlights. Nice head which lasted as long as the beer did and excellent lacing.  Taste (once frosting on rim was brushed away) was a clean malt backbone with hints of pumpkin. The only pie spices evident were those from the glass, it seems. No hops noted -- probably this beer was brewed using bittering hops only and no late additions.  Aroma is similar to taste -- malt with hints of pumpkin.  Mouthfeel was pleasant and smooth.

Look - Pours a clear copper amber with a small foamy head that dissipates quickly and leaves some lacing. Rambunctious carbonation.  Smell - Pumpkin, brown sugar, then cinnamon and allspice, nutmeg takes up the rear. Some sweet malt.  Taste - Carbonated malt intro followed by smooth pumpkin and brown sugar, ending with a huge blast of the spices. Enjoyed all except the finish here.  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied and medium carbonation. Not at all boozy. Nice and creamy. Spices fade into the palate nicely. Great drinkability.  Overall - Maybe I'm being a perfectionist but yet again I found there to be too much spice in this brew and almost all of the others I have tried in this category.

Slight nutmeg and cinnamon hints but this beer smells impressively beer like but with pumpkin notes.  Taste: bear perfect blend of pumpkin, spice, and real malt taste. Pumpkin flavor complements bready malt taste rather than overpowers and the nutmeg, cinnamon, and brown sugar additions give the beer a pumpkin pie like flavor. The finish is drying and pleasant.  Mouthfeel: full bodied but drinkable for a pumpkin ale. Medium carbonation  Overall: one of my favorite fall pumpkin ales because it balanced pumpkin and spice flavors with real beer and malt flavors. Sometimes pumpkin ales are overdone and overwhelming to the palate with sweetness and dessert like flavors.

10099,6260,ThisWangsChung,3.2,"12 oz bottle into a pint glass.  A: Pours a burnished copper color. The head is very fluffy, if not the tallest at only a finger. While the off-white colored head doesn't have great retention, it does leave a ring of lacing on the glass.  S: Dogfish Head actually didn't overdo it with the spices - and that's a good thing in this case. Many times, I've had a pumpkin ale that smelled good but tasted unpleasantly spicy. This smells like it's full of brown sugar, with a touch of gourd character and spicing only existing as a subtle background note. So I'll probably like this more than the Pumpkinheads of the world.  T: Actually, the bitter nutmeg character seems to come through more strongly than the nose suggested. And that's not a good thing in this case. A pleasant canvas of brown sugar and caramel sweetness open it up, with the slightly problematic spice notes appearing in the middle, and fading away as more is drunk. The finish is faintly nutty and mineral water-esque, with something resembling hops occasionally.  M: It's a weird combination of full-bodied and sharp (due to the carbonation). Somehow, this works to give it decent drinkability combined with the dry finish. Once the carbonation fades, it becomes merely full-bodied...and loses its drinkability in the process.  O: It's not great, but it's better than a few others in the style I've had. It has potential as a pumpkin ale for those who don't like pumpkin ales. It's also reasonably complex and only offers a mild spice note. But to me, it still tastes a little uninspired. It's been a while since I've properly enjoyed something from DFH (I think it was a 2011 bottle of WWS), and this doesn't quite change my mind about that.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

A little bit darker than expected from a pumpkin ale.  Smell: my nose is filled with pumpkin and spices upon smelling this beer. It doesn't smell as sweet or promising as the others. I feel as if i can also smell the carbonation of the beer. I can also tell its going to be higher in alcohol content than most.  Taste: A very spice filled taste when it comes to my first few sips. You can most definitely taste the pumpkin in this beer, but its not so sweet as some of the other pumpkin beers. There is alot of spice also noted when tasting. Not what i'd expect when i think pumpkin beer, but i'm not disappointed.  Mouthfeel: A thicker beer, with a medium to light carbonation. Makes for a really good combo. Also i feel that as it goes down my throat that it feels creamy, which i enjoy.  Overall: I have always held dogfish as one of the premier breweries in the states, and i remember this beer from a long time ago.

A: pours a clear orange-brown with about a centimeter of off-white foam. Definitely a lighter color than you'd expect from a brown ale, but hey it looks nice.  S: very complex - sweet, spicy, and fruity. Nutmeg and cinnamon smells are very prominent. Pumpkin smell is pretty light when the beer is cold, and you can smell the alcohol as well.  T: Starts off with a pleasant hop bite and then continues with spicy and sweet brown sugar flavors. Cinnamon and pumpkin flavors are most prominent at the end.  M: Maybe just a bit too much carbonation, but otherwise it's got a nice feel to it. Seemingly lighter at first and then when you taste the pumpkin meatiness at the end it feels a lot heavier.  O: A great beer for the season, couldn't think of a better way to celebrate the start of fall. This ale is definitely another example of DFH's creativity and ability to create high quality, complex beers.

Label is very plain and classic which is nice. Nothing crazy other than the DFH logo with a pumpkin stem. Poured into a standard American Dogfish head pint glass.  A - pretty standard coloring of a pumpkin ale only a touch darker than most I've had. Lighter brown color with hints of orange. Very rich and looks a lot like Autumn. Head pours nice and creamy at first before settling into a pretty good ring of lace leaving small spots of stick to the glass. The best looking pumpkin ale I've ever seen. It was a few years ago and still is today during this review.  S - aroma is spot on. Pumpkin pie spices. Allspice, cinnamon, and a hint of nutmeg. Brown sugar used is noticeable. Fresh pumpkin and a bit of brown malt make up the backbone.  T - caramel malt with a touch of pumpkin up front. The brown sugar notes really do a lovely job of blending the caramel and pumpkin notes. A very balanced flavor with the spices of allspice, cinnamon, and nutmeg take control midway before blending in a sweet finish.  M - a very nice feel and texture to the Punkin ale. Idk if there is a better balanced ale in this style. It doesn't come off as a spiced ale or even a pumpkin pie flavored ale like most. It has the spices, malt and pumpkin but is blended to near perfection. Smooth and easy to drink. One of the best you'll find this time of year.  O - I've had Punkin ale many many times and it remains as one of my favorite DFH brews and one of my go to ales during the Autumn months. It's first class in creativity and quality. It is a pumpkin ale however and that isn't always everyone's favorite, but with that being said there really aren't any pumpkin ales that live up to the DFH offering. It's something about anyone can enjoy. It's not too sweet, too much spice, or too much pumpkin pie character. It's a well balanced beauty that's fit to enjoy.

Smell is of pumkin spice not overwhelming but inviting ""saying welcome to the table"". Taste is of Pumpkin pie spices very well balanced so that the taste mirrors it. I can definetly taste the pumpkin.  Not at all overly sweet, but I must say 1 beer is enough at a ""sitting"" ABV is camouflaged perfectly but you do feel lulled into serenity after, ( just like unbuttoning the pants and loosening the belt after eating the Thanksgiving feast).

The brew its self is a golden brown, with an orange highlight.  Smell: On first pour, there was quite a bit going on. The standard pumpkin ale aroma was everywhere with nutmeg, pumpkin spice, and cinnamon. After a while, it kind of fell off and what remained was the alcohol. A bit disappointing for me, because the smell of a pumpkin ale is half of having one in my opinion.  Taste: Pretty great taste throughout. A slight breadiness, with pumpkin, caramel, and nutmeg. Unlike the smell, the ABV is hidden quite well.  Feel: Thick and warm. I wish it were cold out so I could make like the description and just huddle up with a four pack. Medium carbonated.  Overall: A very decent effort again from Dogfish Head. I've never been disappointed with them, and they don't here as well. Always a bit bummed by the four pack... but whatever.

The flavor follows with sweet caramel and brown sugar with some pumpkin in the front, then it becomes more substantial of more bready pumpkin.

This rating is on this year: Appearance is almost crystal clear, as expected from DFH (not surprised that they filter their beer). The head is great, foamy, sustaining, obvious carbonation, and a fair amount if lacing. Smell is, in the background and as a backbone, almost English bitter in nature (to me). The obvious front scents are not as spice-laden as some, but fairly balanced-cinnamon, nutmeg, with a pulpy fruit nature to the nose. I also get a hint of lemon, but for the nose, it's pretty much on target, definitely not overpowering at all.  As for taste, it basically follows the nose, the slightest bit more tart/sour than expected. Overall, there is a nice pumpkin spice in the beer that is evident, and the medium body feel adds some depth to the spices. There is unfortunately an alcohol-based astringency that detracts a bit from the otherwise nicely balanced beer.  I've for years fought over my enjoyment if this beer. I think it balances spice flanker with de backbone, but would prefer a smoother beer. Pumpkin beers are a finicky thing to me, so take my review for what it is:  This is a decent beer with enough flavor/spice to entice a pumpkin beer fan. Overall execution for this year is quite good, but I think there are better options out there.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

A: 3.5 pours light brown with a red tint, sporting a solid 2 fingers of white frothy head that disappates quite slowly and leaves little to no lacing. S: 3.75 smells like a mild potpourri aroma that my grandma always had proudly on display come this time of year. Plenty of cinnamon and brown sugar, with vanilla, mulled spices. T: 3.25 Unlike the aroma, the dominant flavor I detect includes the mulling spices. After taste leaves traces of brown sugar and cinnamon. Not too dry, not too bitter. Very distinct and mild. It partially tastes a little watered down. M: 4.25 Smooth, as previously noted not dry, not bitter. Just a very smooth brew that is well carbed. O: 3.5 This is a great Fall beer. My first of the year! I would have guessed it at a 3.5-4% beer, very surprising this one racks up to 7%! I would definitely have this again if looking for a Fall beer.

10099,6260,DeFaz,4.41,"Apperance: Pours a light orange color (lighter than I expected) with a medium head that leaves behind great lacing.  Smell: This is the best part of pumpkin ales, and this beer delivers. Pumpkin is placed into moderation by allspice, nutmeg, malt, hops, and alcohol.  Taste: Fantastic. The pumpkin is an ingredient here rather than the whole beer itself, and the other flavors, including the bite from the alcohol, work with it. Allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon add just enough spice to compliment the pumpkin and malt.  Mouthfeel: Smooth despite being on the thin side. Carbonation is low, allowing the flavors to shine. I wonder as I drink this why so many pumpkin ales drown out the flavor with excessive carbonation.  Overall: There is no consensus as to what is the best pumpkin ale, but there sure are a lot of opinions. This and Pumpking are on the short list of the best in my opinion. This is pricey at $8.99/four, but this truly is excellent. This beer succeeds by doing less of what other pumpkin ales do (others often have too much pumpkin, not enough balance of pumpkin and spice, too much carbonation, or pumpkin that does not taste fresh). This is a must try.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Carbonation dances up the glass. Beautiful.  S- I pick up the pumpkin and allspice, and a little of the nutmeg on the nose. It isn't over the top, which is, sometimes, where pumpkin beers go wrong.  T- A great and mellow mix of the characteristics I detected in the smell. Again, not over the top. This taste would compliment a slice of pumpkin pie well, instead of trying to replace the pie.  M- Pretty smooth, a little creamy. A bit of a bitter finish, but I think the spice in the finish cuts the bitterness a bit.  O- This is a fantastic pumpkin beer. Like I mentioned before, I think a lot of beers try to replace the taste and aroma of pumpkin pie, whereas DFH seemed to compliment the treat.

The pumpkin fruit they use is crazy good though because it comes through without being too sweet or overpowered by the spices.  T: This always reminds me of the fall and I also use it to benchmark other pumpkin beers. The alcohol comes through even though it's 7%, but it's a pleasant flavor.

This beer is actually what made Dogfish head Famous, they served it at a festival that was based around lobbing pumpkins with crazy contraptions.  Lets get to it!  A: The over all appearance is nice, a dark amber color almost brown. The head is light, but creamy and went way to a thin layer after a few minutes.  S: The smell is where a lot of the money is made here. This brew has a lot of natural fresh spices, and you can tell when you take a sniff. On top of that, the fresh smell from the pumpkin meat used comes through as well making this a very enjoyable beer. I recommend taking a nice whiff before sipping this.  T: If the smell wasn't good enough, the taste is. This has a nice warm and yet refreshing taste. The fresh spices, and pumpkin make you feel like your eating moms pumpkin pie after a Thanksgiving dinner. The warm tones from this brew compliment the cold weather, and of course the holidays.  Overall this is probably the best Pumpkin Ale I have had. I have hunted down many but this takes the top pick for sure.

10099,6260,TheBrewo,4,"We pour a rusty orange brew. It holds a two finger head of creamy tannish bubbles, showing nice retention. The bubbles slowly recede, leaving clumps of big bubbles atop the liquid, along with sticky, spidery lacing sticking to the glass. Haze is moderate due to finite chunks of sediment suspended throughout the drink, and carbonation appears slow, yet active. The nose is fresh, with big pumpkin spice, light clove, metallic vanilla bean, nutmeg, cinnamon, cumin, and baker’s yeast. The malts are pale, with caramel and a light toast. Our first impression is that this is one of the best pumpkin beers we’ve ever had, with bold, serious flavoring. The flavoring opens with sweet malts and raw pumpkin flesh. There is a bitterness of a menagerie of autumnal spice, along with yeast, and a light phenolic back. To the peak comes more bittering malt, with a white sugar flash to cut, along with more of that serious pumpkin flavoring. Smooth nuttiness adds depth, as does a light caramel, to the malts. This marks the transition to the finish, with enhancing sweetness by sugary pumpkin cream, orangey citrus, more pumpkin spice, and a souring pale malt. The aftertaste breathes of metallics, syrupy pumpkin sugars, toasty malts, bittering yeast, booze, and a light citric hop. The body is medium, and the carbonation is lighter. There is nice slurp, smack, cream, and froth to each sip, with a mild astringency down the throat. The light coating left is metallic, and adds to the dryness. The abv is appropriate, and this beer drinks easily.  Overall, what we enjoyed most about this was how serious the flavoring was. The “realness” of the flavoring really adds to the experience, as it can be easy with the style to use extracts and other additive flavoring. Here we are presented with a full flavor brew brimming with spice and fruit, making this a top competitor for the style.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,ilkelma,4.2,"Poured into a ""pint"" glass from the bottle.  A: Very nice golden amber color with not even a finger of light colored head (from a bottle).  S: Appealing spice laced scent with more than a hint of yeasty aroma. No overpowering pumpkin smell or even much sweetness to the smell.  T: Tastes like a fall pumpkin beer should, rich almost maple syrup like depth of flavor not too bitter and above all not too sweet. Tastes like pumpkin but not so much that it is overwhelming.  M: Light carbonation, very smooth but a bit heavy (as its ABV belies) just shy of dangerously drinkable really.  O: I'd say this is the best ""pumpkin beer"" I've ever had but this is in a real class of its own. Whereas nearly everything else we are assaulted with in fall that claims to be ""pumpkin"" often bears little resemblance to the actual gourd; this beer packs all of that earthy vegetal flavor of the real deal into a beer that is eminently drinkable and a real treat on a cold fall day.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,4ster,3.88,"Poured into a flute type glass.  A: Pours a cloudy, light amber colour, not much fizz with a initial decent creamy off white head , some retention for awhile before it leaves a nice lacing floating on top of the beer.  S: On the nose I get really earthy pumpkin aromas, almost a bit damp & musty (like you'd describe some earthy wines) and hints of the malt and sugars. Not sure if it's the glass I'm using, others better nose, an off batch or just cause it says on the bottle ""brewed with allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg"" that means it smells like it, but I don't get that much spice on the nose, and neither does the other person having this beer right now. (this was our 3rd pumpkin ale of the night and those smelt plenty spicy...)  T: There isn't much I can say over the other 1000's of reviews, but what I can add is that my tasting seems to be more inline with how DFH describes their beer, and as with the aromas, again I don't get near the amount of spice that others are, on that note.... On first sip you are greeted with nice, roasty, burnt sugary malts providing a well done undertone to what follows. As it goes down beautiful roasted earthy pumpkin flavours come out that are wonderfully balanced with a trace of alcohol, and for once I get a bit of nutmeg spice coming out.  M: The beer has a nice balanced level of carbonation, just enough fizz on the tongue, and a heavy enough body of 7.0% abv keeping you interested, but also inline to make sure you're not guzzling it.  O: Even with the lack of spice, I am perfectly fine with that because Punkin does not sell itself as a spiced, pumpkin pie latte ale... this is truly a pumpkin, as in the orange/green/blue gourdes that grow in fields, type of ale, and it is beautifully done. Surely one of the best pumpkin beers I've had yet that really tastes like you've just roasted a pumpkin in the oven, pureed it and drank it down, and have it taste delicious. Where others have left it too light, this one hits the sweet spot in malt sweetness, complexity and hearty pumpkin goodness. I'd definitely hunt this one down another fall and recommend it as nearly everyone else does as a top of the notch pumpkin flavoured ale.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

All the spices from the nose are there but don't try to dominate your palate. Instead, you get that true pumpkin flavor as well and finish with a good malt sweetness. A hint of smoky flavor as well. Definitely used a good grain bill here, going for sweetness while the spices work to cut some of that sweetness out creating a great balance. I think the one flavor that stands out the most is cinnamon but it's got a big supporting cast of flavors working with it. Feels lighter than 7% ABV.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with noticeable effervescence. The spices are a tad cloying and the overall feel is more hearty than refreshing. Average drinkability.  Final Thoughts: As Pumpkin Ales go, DFH Punkin Ale delivers on all the flavors you'd expect in addition to a nice malt bill. While I wouldn't say it's the best of the style, I would say doesn't disappoint. Would I drink it again? Yes, along with a lot of other good contenders for the fall season.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,TheRealBigC,4.22,"This is unquestionably one of the better Pumpkin Ales out there. Dogfish Head has produced a very balanced, meticulously spiced beer that not only feels like fall, but warms you during those cooler months as well. You get a good dose of cinnamon & nutmeg on the nose and palate. Pumpkin flavor is mild, which benefits the overall profile of the beer. It does come through on the nose like a fresh pie. Good, dry finish too. I would buy a pack of these every season. One is enough for the season, but it's something to look forward to (like many great seasonals).",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,TheDinger,3.97,"Poured from bottle into snifter. Fairly uneventful pour with a nice medium amber hue and a little 1 finger head. Looks like bubbly cider. Smell was of carmel, brown sugar and some spices. Very nice aroma. Taste follows the nose with a huge front end of carmel malts and great blend of spices (nutmeg, cinnamon, sugar, cloves). I like that it has the ale qualities and is more of a spiced brown vs. a pumpkin bomb. Very well balanced and great blend. A little hop finish, but focus is on the carmel and spice. Feel is medium with some carbonation and a bit of thickness for the tongue. Overall- A very solid spiced ale that has the balance of malts and spice. It's not over the top and IMO is one of the best I have had. Sessionable and easy to enjoy this time of year. Like that it is a brown first with the spice/flavor to compliment. Well done DFH- Will be having another soon!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

10099,6260,DeltaGolfSierra,3.89,"Appearance is rather average - color is dark amber, much like a strong iced tea, with a small head that fades quickly. The smell is a mix of various spices; scents of cinnamon and nutmeg stand out most. The taste is more beer-like than pumpkin-like. There's a solid malt backbone that gives some sweetness, with the spices adding a complimentary peppery flavor. It's a very nice balance. Mouthfeel seemed a bit on the thin side, and carbonation seemed high. A well-rounded pumpkin ale that emphasizes the ale over the pumpkin.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,Bowdoinbeerboy,4.11,"Pours with no head whatsoever and a slightly cloudy light to medium amber color.  The smell is much more subdued in this beer than I had expected, its mostly a slightly sweet and brown sugary smell with only a light hint of pumpkin.  The first thing that hits you is a malty sweetness and light brown sugar that is balanced very nicely with a slight hop bitterness. The pumpkin flavor of this beer is entirely on the back-end, and is much more like actual pumpkin than pumkin spices (such as are found in some other examples of this style and lingers forever.  Overall this is a very nice seasonal beer, the alcohol is perhaps a bit more than I expected but this is a truly delicious beer. A definite grab in the fall.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,TempeBeerMan,4.1,"Poured from a bottle into a nonic pint.  A - A clear reddish-amber with a very fluffy two-finger white head. Extremely sticky lacing which takes seemingly forever to slip back into the glass when it doesnt just stick outright.  S - Moderately strong aroma of pumpkins and autumn spices. Nutmug pretty prevalent. Smells just a little sour.  T - Sweeter than the nose would indicate, with a big caramel malt base. No sourness in the flavor profile. Autumn spices also come forward (nutmeg, allspice, ginger, and clove in that order) with a pumpkin that tastes slightly roasted. Spices and flavor additives do not overwhelm the base beer, which is a very good thing. Very tasty.  M - Medium to full bodied, with medium carbonation. End result is a nice ""chewiness"" that compliments the flavors nicely.  O - One of, (if not THE) best pumpkin or ""autumn"" beers I have ever had. Ingredients blend seemlessly. In a market that seems to be flooded with numerous brews of this type, this one stand out.

10099,6260,Siriusfisherman,3.97,"Appearance: Smallish head that dissipated quickly, moderate lacing. Gorgeous orange glow, though I thought is was supposed to be brown.  Smell: Like pumpkin pie, definitely get the allspice, cinnamon as well but not as much. Slightly sweet smell to and light molasses tone (brown sugar), as well as a nice actual pumpkin smell. The malt takes the back seat, and the hops come in slightly floral and herbal but very subtle.  Taste: Very similar to the smell, but not as complex or delicate. The allspice is more dominant, as well as the hops, jumping in with a nice bitterness to cut the sweetness. The after taste is dominated more by malt and some noticable peppery bread notes from the yeast. There is a huge amount of flavor in here, even by dogfish standards.  Mouthfeel: This brew has a very robust mouthfeel, it coats your mouth. The carbonation is pretty high as well, although not to much. Compliments the flavor very well  Overall: A fantastic pumpkin ale, the first one I can say that I truly enjoyed. There seems to be a tendancy for this style to consist of a run of the mill ale that is spiced like a pumpkin pie. You can tell this ale was built from the ground up to work as a pumpkin beer. My only complaint is that they call it a brown ale, and it is not brown, which threw me off at first.

10099,6260,BeerFMAndy,4.57,"12 oz bottle poured into a Bruery tulip. 7% ABV, Bottled in 2012 printed in yellow on neck.  A - Dogfish Head's Punkin pours a crystal clear pumpkin orange color with amber low-lights and candle glow yellow high-lights. Brilliant! A solid off-white head that's dense and creamy like whipped topping is produced from a somewhat vigorous pour but it doesn't have the greatest retention. Thin lace traces outlines of a mountain range on the tulip.  S - Punkin Ale's upfront malty nose consists of sweet caramel and light toast notes with a real pumpkin aroma and a good, moderate level of spicing Dashes of allspice and nutmeg are prevalent while a sprinkle of cinnamon remains largely overshadowed. Gooey brown sugar sweetness steps in before this beer concludes with a crisp grassy hop aroma that delicately balances the pumpkin beer to keep it, well, a beer.  T - This might be one of the more balanced, subtle beers Dogfish Head produces. Punkin keeps the pumpkin real with traces of the roasted gourd among the spicing which slowly builds in presence as the beer is consumed. The brown ale base blends almost perfectly with the allspice, nutmeg, and cinnamon and the caramel and toasted malt notes work in tandem with lingering brown sugar sweetness. Once again, the beer is kept a beer with a great finish of soft earthy hops that lingers with traces of spiciness.  M - Creamy and smooth like a piece of pumpkin pie, Punkin's slightly higher carbonation gives the beer a generous crispness that, with the dry hopiness and spice finish, works to keep the sweetness at bay nicely. Thin alcohol is miniscule on the back end adding just a slight, passing warmth which works wonders on the colder fall days.  O - Completely cohesive from start to finish, Dogfish Head Punkin Ale manages to, almost effortlessly, take a nice and malty brown ale with gentle hoppy earth tones, a perfect beer for the season, and integrate real pumpkin and spice all while maintaining the bottom line; it's still a beer. I personally prefer my pumpkin ales a little more pumpkin-rich, but this beer is absolutely outstanding and warrants a try from anyone who's not yet enjoyed it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,socon67,4.05,"A - Orange color, with an eggshell foam that settles fast. Very clear look. Slight carbonation.  S - Good smell of genuine pumpkin; no fake smell. Also, the pumpkin spices are less dominant than the actual pumpkin smell. Another good quality.  T - Great taste of pumpkin, caramel, nutmeg, and cinnamon. A more subdued beer of the style that focuses on the overall beer quality and less on over-spicing the brew.  M - Might be the most sessionable pumpkin beer out there. Feels light for the style and does not leave a spicy aftertaste.  O - For people who like a traditional version of the style and not over the top. Who would think that DFH would make a really good beer that isn't extreme for the style? Easily a fall favorite.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Dogfish Head Punkin pours a clear, burnt orange and is capped by an inch of off-white head. A little pumpkin shows through in aromas dominated by spicy nutmeg and brown sugar. The flavors follow the nose fairly well, with the pumpkin a tad more noticeable on the pallet. Hints of caramel and alcohol are also present.

S: Much more spice than pumpkin, but pumpkin's there. Cinnamon and clove in particular stick out. Tiny malts underneath.  T: Like the nose, not much pumpkin. The spices are pretty well balanced but subtle. I want more punch. Not as sweet as other pumpkin ales. If you don't like the sweetness in other examples of the style, you might like this. A good amount of cinnamon sticks out. There's a tiny touch of heat in the finish, along with a tiny touch of pumpkin.

You have the hoppy character that is prevalent in all Dogfish Head brews and you can taste the spices usually found in a good pumpkin pie.

I will start by saying that when it comes to rating beer, the most important factor to me boils down to one question. ""Would I buy this beer again?"".  Hands-down, no doubt, I would certainly buy Dogfish Head's Punkin again.  This beer is not too watered down. It has a great malty backbone to it. It is not too spiced-up. There is a great foundation of pumpkin flavor without being obnoxious. I could drink more than one in a sitting.

Some faint bready malt followed by a whiff of veg which may or may not be the pumpkin.  T- Whereas many popular pumpkin ales come across to me as tasting artificial and cloying, the spice flavor here is subtle and well balanced. There is a hint of brown sugar sweetness that is quickly offset by slightly bitter dryness at the finish.  M- On the thin side of medium. I'd like a little more body but it is plenty smooth.

10099,6260,Jugs_McGhee,3.05,"12 fl oz brown glass bottle with standard pressure cap served into a Uinta brewing pilsner glass in Los Angeles, California. Reviewed live. Expectations are above average. Acquired as part of a four pack at the Cap 'N' Cork in Los Angeles a few hours ago.  Served straight from the refrigerator. Not paired with food.  A: Pours a four finger white head of nice cream, pretty good thickness, and good retention for the relatively high ABV. Colour of the body is textbook transparent copper. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show. Fairly vibrant, but nothing special.  Sm: Brown sugar, spice (including distinct cinnamon), clean malts, light toasted malts, and pumpkin. Pumpkin is substantial - a good characteristic for the style (you'd be surprised how many pumkin beers I've had that featured very little pumpkin). I'm excited for it. Aroma is dry in character and average in strength.  T: Spice and pumpkin are the first thing I notice, with some texture-affecting brown sugar throughout. The foundation is comprised of clean bland malts. The spices don't feel all that balanced. It's got body, but mostly because of the mouthfeel rather than the flavour. No yeast comes through at all. The pumpkin is nice. The brown sugar comes through most on the climax, where I can almost feel it rotting my teeth. It's a pretty sugary build all around - a substitute here for Dogfish Head's usual trademark sweetness. Where their IPAs are sweet, this is sugary. Some limited subtlety, but little complexity or impressive layering. Indeed, there's nothing unique or special here. Feels manufactured and par for the course. No alcohol comes through. I do get cinnamon.  Mf: Surprisingly dry, with emergent wetness only coming roughly at the midpoint. A bit too thick. Smooth. The mouthfeel distracts from the flavour. Adequately carbonated.  Dr: Horribly overpriced for the disappointing quality. I expected no better from Dogfish Head. I wouldn't get this again. A bit rubbish. Drinkable but boring and bland. Rather simple. Hides its alcohol well.  Low C+ / ABOVE AVERAGE",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

A - Clear. Its a nice amber color that kinda looks like a glass of tea. Small lacing around the edge of the glass and a white lacing over top of most of the beer.  S - It smells like a dogfish beer. Maybe it's just me, but I think all dogfish beers have a similar scent. After taking a nice deep smell, I get whiffs of pumpkin (obviously) and some spices cinnamon or nutmeg (I know the taste, but I can't quite put my finger on it). Smells kinda like a pumpkin pie almost. It smells like fall and it smells delicious.  T - Very creamy beer. Definitely malt and pumpkin driven Once again there's still a lot of spice to it. Initially has a sweetness but then Finishes with a little spiciness. Very good.  M - Medium body. Not too much carbonation. Just right for the type.  O - Another excellent offering by Dogfish. This was definitely worth ordering online and having to cover the ridiculous cost of shipping. Hands down the best pumpkin beer I've ever tasted. Only downside (if you can call it that) is it's so good you really want to just keep drinking it instead of appropriately savoring the aromas and taste. Ultimately, worth a try. Cheers!  P.S. Dogfish, if by some absolute miracle you read this review... Please come back to Tennessee! We miss you.

T - Quite delicious, more of what you get from the smell. Pumpkin right off the bat, with that cinnamon, some spice, and you get the sweetness from the brown sugar. Not quite as good as the nose suggests but still the best fall pumpkin brew that I have had. Alcohol blends in nicely...The brown sugar really started to come through more as it warmed. Nice to start it real cold and sip slowly and luxuriously away at it till it gets pretty cool. At the end the flavors only come out more robustly and leave you with a smile on your face.

But actually a somewhat dry hoppy taste with residual sweetness at the end. Brown sugar seems to come through. Well balanced. The 7% ABV is well hidden.  M - Medium body. Fits the style. Drinkable body offsets sweetness and allows the drinker to enjoy several.  O - This is my 2nd favorite Pumpkin Ale. The spicing is the best in the style. I am a big fan of Dogfish Head and this is one of the best beers they make.

10099,6260,Gatch,4.2,"A: Clear, light golden-brown, almost burnt sienna, with a big, fluffy, frothy, off-white, slightly yellowish-brown head. Decent lace and retention.  S: You have to pour a big head and dig your nose deep to get a lot of aromas. Letting it warm up a bit helps, as well. Fall spices, lightly roasted malt, sweet molasses, caramelized/brown sugar, sugar pumpkin, earth. Smells like the air of the season.  T: The flavor is much better/stronger than the nose. Delicious balance of spices (specifically nutmeg and cinnamon), fresh pumpkin, and roasted malt. Hints of brown sugar, sweet malt, and hops.  M: Super smooth, flavorful, and unique. None of the flavors overpower each other. Can become cloying with all the sweetness but still top notch.  O: A well-crafted, easy-drinking, not overly spiced or pumpkin'd Pumpkin Ale. Great beer for the style. One of the best in my opinion. The question I always find with Pumpkin Ales is, could I have second? With this one, most likely.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,NuclearDolphin,4.27,"Poured into a Pint Glass  Appearance - Dark mildly hazy Orange with a few carbonation bubbles along the sides. Head is white and about half a finger in width upon pour before becoming a white film. Lacing on the mild side here.  Smell - Cinnamon, Pumpkin Pie, Spice, Graham Crackers, Yeasts, and Malts. Very warm and inviting aroma that one can smell all day.  Taste - Cinnamon, Spices, Pumpkin Pie, Yeasts and Malts. After a streak of what I would call disappointing Pumpkin Ales, I'm happy to say the flavor here is rich, delicious & sweet.  Mouthfeel - Light carbonation and light bodied and feels very crisp and easy to drink. I also get a warming sensation from drinking this, which is another good sign (for me at least)  Overall - Even though I still prefer Painted Pumpkin Ladies, this comes in a VERY close for my overall favorite Pumpkin Ale. It's got rich aroma and flavors. On top of that, it's easy to drink and it warms you right up.

10099,6260,TheBigLebrewski,4.12,"Bottle poured into a pint glass. Short but satisfactory, small-bubbled white head. Amber and lighter in color than expected. Great smell, per the style; appreciably not overpowering. Could say the same about taste: great amount of pumpkin, allspice, cinnamon, and nutmeg, without being overly sweet or weighted in favor of any particular ingredient. (Didn't get much brown sugar.) Mouthfeel, however, was not perfect - A very little bit of a metallic tinge that puckered up the tastebuds. If anything diminished my affection for this beer it was the mouthfeel and, even more-so, the aftertaste - a sort of herbal bitterness that detracted from the very well balanced sweetness in the front of the sip.  Overall, a decent pumpkin ale, but not the best of it's type. I enjoyed it, and it's certainly worth trying, but considering that this is usually marked-up from the standard dogfish pricing, you can ultimately find a better pumpkin ale for cheaper. Try Shipyard's Pumpkinhead if you like lighter beers or lots of nutmeg, Jolly Pumpkin's Parcela if you're partial to sours, or Shipyard's Pugsley's series for a similar, more pie-oriented, and equally tasteful pumpkin brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,Luddy37,4,"The appearance of this beer was a orange copper ale color that Id expect. The smell was one of the better from pumpkin beers. I was hit with the floral aromatics which included a hint of pumpkin. However, the smell was not all that overwhelming. The taste was overall good. A hint of pumpkin emerged followed by a light sweet after taste from the sugars. They say its a full body ale, but I somewhat disagree on that aspect. I think overall it was a more medium and went down smoothly. Overall a very good beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,davecavemaster,4.22,"The beer pours with a good creamy off white head. The head starts out pretty thick, but dissipates fairly quickly, leaving a thin foamy head for most of the drink. Moderate lacing on the glass.  As for color, the beer pours a golden, orange. Lots of small bubbles drifting up form the bottom keep a thin layer of foam on top.  The aroma of this brew is very nice. It's like inhaling a pumpkin pie. The smells are dead on what the label tells you, ""brown sugar, allspice, cinnamon & nutmeg."" Very spicy nose, some traces of malt and a slight breadyness as well. Overall, the spices take the front of the nose.  I think the most impressive part of this beer's taste is the way you can taste of the flavors, but none of them are overpowering. You can taste the pumpkin, the spices, and all of the sweetness of the sugars, but all are very balanced. With some seasonals you are done with one, with this one you crave another.  Great fall pumpkin beer. The folks at Dogfish Head nailed this one.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Pumpkin pie spices with an overall smooth aroma. Nothing overbearing. Spice and an underlying herbal hops note.  Spices don't linger in the taste. A bit of sweetness, a light hops bite. Cinnamon & allspice (as noted on the label).  There's a body to this brew that some pumpkin ales lack; a completeness. I don't get the sensation that I'm drinking watery beer with pumpkin spices added to the base. Beats most pumpkin ales in my book.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

S: Pumpkin and brown sugar sweetness off the bat, nutmeg and cinnamon in background. Quite pungent.  T: A rustic pumpkin flavor intertwined with some lightly roasted malts initially. Kicks of brown sugar and cinnamon. Quite sweet and spicey. Malt base reminscent of an irish red mixed with brown, some tea like bitterness notes mixed with the cinnamon and nutmeg, I do enjoy the brown sugar malt base.  M: Pretty thick and syrupy. Quite rich/heavy. Very flavorful, not a session beer. Lot of residual sugar.  O: More of a dessert beer, would pair well with potatoes turkey, steak, and rustic food. Might be a tad over spiced but its got a great flavor profile. Stands out among the many pumpkin ales.

10099,6260,RussBecker1,3.7,"Poured from a bottle to a pint glass.  A-Pours a dark rusted orange with hints of both brown and amber. Looks as you would imagine a pumpkin ale would. Very little head which lasts for a decent amount of time, but leaves little to no lacing throughout the glass.  S-The nose is not very sharp, but the spices are very identifiable. Cinnamon, allspice and hints of pumpkin are there with maybe a bit of clove and vanilla that round out the body. Smells more like a pumpkin pie than simply a pumpkin ale, which is nice just not very strong.  M-About average. The body is heavily carbonated which makes it very drinkable, but it does hamper the taste and undertones of the body.  T-The nose is spot on. All those flavors are apparent although not very strong. It is substantially less sweet than some other pumpkin brews which was personally much appreciated. The flavors do intertwine well, but are muted to a certain degree that takes away from any possible complexity.  O-Punkin is not too complex of an ale, but I did find it pretty enjoyable to drink. Having it only available during the fall does play into its likeability, as at any other time it would be far less appealing.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,Jerzi20,4.7,"A- The carmel color is exactly what I want to see in a pumpkin ale - not too dark, and not too light. It's the perfect medium.  S - Without taking a sip, in the proper glass you can simply inhale the taste of pumpkin pie. Slightly spicy, the crust hits your palate first but the combination of pumpkin, nutmeg and cinnamon remain. It's almost like inhaling desert without the calories.  T - For my taste buds, this is the ultimate pumpkin beer. Is not too sweet, and once you sit down to relax with one, it's hard to quit. Most pumpkin beers leave me too full or are too heavy to drink pint after pint. I just can't get tired of this one. With a small sip, the dry sweet taste hits your taste buds but disappears just as quickly. The sweetness is counter acted with the spices.  M - Smooth, Sweet, and spicy.

The head wouldn't form more than just a half an inch, and it's simmering away pretty quickly.  Smells of pumpkin rind, cinnamon sugar, and some nutmeg. Other spices leaking through, as well. Not entirely contained by the additives are the hops and malt. There's a bready character that is very appealing, and noticeable hopping.  Brown sugar, cinnamon, pumpkin pulp, and allspice. Mild bitterness from a minty hop that permeates the other dominating flavors. Solid graham cracker maltiness is rich, sweet, and leans toward robust. Offsetting hops make Punkin very drinkable and smooth. Really not that sweet, overall. Perfect levels of carbonation for a medium-bodied pumpkin ale. Some great toasty notes in there that pair perfectly with the cinnamon and brown sugar spicing, and it really shines the more the thing warms up. Great stuff.  Punkin probably still sits at or near the top among pumpkin beers for me because it's a solid example and feels great.

On the nose, it’s all those wonderful fall smells you hope for with a pumpkin beer: cinnamon, clove and hints of pumpkin. I’m all about pumpkin, so this is right in my wheelhouse. On the taste, there is a lot of hearty pumpkin which is sweet on the end. The fall spice is a little more subtle in the taste and lets the pumpkin flavor take the front seat.

It's clear, and appears to have been filtered; but its filled with junk, which I'm assuming are spices, or maybe pumpkin. On second look, it may be yeast. Light brownish, slightly amber. S- Subtle spice, mostly cinammon in the nose. Esters, almost seems like this could be a British yeast. Not very aromatic, was expecting a bit more. T- Hmm. Not sure I'm a fan. The first taste was brown sugar, but followed closely by a burnt malt flavor, which was out of place and a bit off putting. Perhaps that was the pumpkin flavor. The fruitiness from the yeast comes though in the flavor too. Slight malt sweetness, becoming more evdient as the beer warms. A little bit musty. Some alcohol in the finish too, warming as it goes down. I don't find this to be pleasant. M- This seems overcarbonated. The body is fairly light, not sure that makes sense with the beer either, I suppose the light body is trying to make it drinkable? Confusing. O- Maybe I have a bad bottle? I don't think I would get this again.

10099,6260,StoutHunter,3.92,"I picked up a bottle of Dogfish Head's Punkin Ale last week for $2.59 at The Lager Mill. I'm still on the quest to find a new favorite Pumpkin Ale and since I missed out on this beer last year I made sure to pick up a bottle this year, so lets see how it goes. 2012 Fall Release. Poured from a brown 12oz bottle into an imperial pint glass.  A- The label is pretty simple and typical for Dogfish Head, but I do like the information and the slight pumpkin modification to the label. It poured a nice slightly golden orange color that took on more of a brunt orange color when held to the light with two fingers worth of slightly off white head that died down to a thin ring that stayed till the end and left a little bit of lacing. This beer looked fine but I was expecting a little darker color because of the Brown Ale base of this beer.  S- The first thing I pick up is large pumpkin pie aroma with all the spices mentioned on label being noticeable with the cinnamon and nutmeg sticking out the most and the brown sugar blending well and imparting a medium amount of sweetness followed by a nice meaty pumpkin aroma that shows up just enough to complete the pumpkin pie aroma. After that I get a slight amount of caramel malts, but it's the pumpkin and spices that are highlighted the most, as they should be. This beer has a good aroma, I have no complaints.  T- The taste seems to be very similar to the aroma and it starts off exactly the same with lot's of pumpkin pie flavors, it's not overly spiced and none of the spices seem to overpower the other ones and the pumpkin tastes authentic and shows up just enough. Up next comes the malts and the brown sugar which give this beer a slightly higher amount of medium sweetness and impart some light caramel malts flavors with a lower amount of bitterness on the finish with a pumpkin pie like aftertaste. This was a good tasting beer, but it would be great if the brown ale aspects showed up more.  M- Smooth, slightly sticky, dry on the finish, pretty prickly, medium bodied with a higher amount of carbonation. The mouthfeel was ok, but there was too much carbonation in this beer and it made for a prickly mouthfeel.  Overall I thought this was a good beer and a good example of a Pumpkin Ale, it had all those great pumpkin pie aspects without being over spiced and artificial tasting. This beer had good drinkability, it went down smoothly and had enough flavors to hold my attention. two would probably be my limit with this beer, it's a great choice for a cool fall night. What I liked most about this beer was the taste and the aroma, they were pretty good and just what I expect from a Pumpkin Ale. What I liked least about this beer was the high amount of carbonation, it was a little overboard and that made for a prickly mouthfeel. I would buy this beer again when looking for a good Pumpkin Ale, but it's a little on the expensive side so I can't see myself filling my fridge with it, but I recommend that anyone who likes Pumpkin Ales to give this beer a try. All in all I was satisfied with this Pumpkin Ale and so far it's the best one I have had this year, but it isn't the best one I have had, Screaming Pumpkin still has that title, but it was still good nonetheless and was much better then the last two Pumpkin Ale's I've had, good job Dogfish Head, this is one solid Pumpkin Ale.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Delicious.  T - Much like the nose, the taste leads with the pumpkin spices, and transitions quickly into the pumpkin flesh taste. Here, however, is where the brown sugar really shines to make this a balanced and mildly sweet treat. The sweetness compliments and brings out the spice flavors, making this beer reminiscent of a good homemade pumpkin pie.  M - Light and refreshing... Not exactly ideal. It feels like a sweeter beer than it actually is, if that makes sense. Moderate-to-high carbonation, and very little dryness.  O - My 2nd favorite pumpkin beer.

F – Medium-bodied with lots of carbonation, a sticky and creamy mouthfeel, and a spicy and dry finish. Pumpkin pie spice, particularly cinnamon, lingers for a nice amount of time and pairs well with the subtle throat-warming sensation from the alcohol.  O – This is a really tasty pumpkin beer. There’s a healthy dose of both pumpkin and spice while maintaining a good malt presence. I would kick back a bit on the carbonation, as I think it would help the mouthfeel and make the “full-bodied” description found on the label more believable.

The head has very good retention, eventually fading to give a light level of lacing.  Smell – The smell is a nice blend of pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg and brown sugar/molasses. Like a sweet piece of cold pumpkin pie.  Taste – The taste starts out of pumpkin and some cinnamon, allspice, and nutmeg spice. As the flavor moves on, it sweetens some, with flavors of a caramel and a brown sugar taste coming to the tongue. These sweeter flavors when mixed with the pumpkin and spice create a very pleasant taste on the tongue. More toward the end of the taste, the spice and sweet intensify and combined with a light hop taste, to leave a tasty pumpkin pie flavor on the tongue.  Mouthfeel – Medium bodied with a medium level of carbonation. Both were good for the pumpkin, sweet and spicy flavors. A little more creaminess may have given it an enhancement; giving it more of the silky pumpkin pie feel, but regardless, the mouthfeel was good overall.  Overall – Good and tasty pumpkin brew.

S-I got a little spice and a little malt. True to the label, you get a little cinnamon, a little nutmeg, and some allspice. Not much pumpkin on the nose. Overall, pretty sweet (brown sugary) smelling.  T-The spices come through, with nutmeg being dominant to begin with and cinnamon taking over towards the end. There was pumpkin, but not a ton. If you are looking for spice, look here, if you want pumpkin go somewhere else. As the beer warmed, you start to notice the alcohol, which when combined with the sweetness of the brown sugar, gives the brew a hint of dark rum taste.  M-This is a sweet beer for sure, but there was just enough carbonation to keep it easily drinkable. Although the label says, ""full-bodied,"" I wouldn't go that far. I'd say medium.

10099,6260,blackcompg,3.97,"Poured from their 12oz bottle...  Appearance - Poured a finger of eggshell head that receded pretty quickly, body is a transparent light orange amber, there is some minimal lacing.  Smell - This really smells like a slice of pumkin pie - big nutmeg and allspice, roasted malts, and big bread crust (pie crust?).  Taste - The very first taste is literally pumpkin pie, which quickly becomes more of the spices of allspice and nutmeg and roasted malt, finishes with toasty breadcrust. This all seems to ride along a backbone of pumpkin meats - I've had other spiced ales where the spices are more prominent - there is something that provides a smoothnes that binds it all together, and I'm thinking this is the pumpkin. It's very subtle, but I really feel (taste) it is there. I get the slightest cinnamon at the back of the tongue way long into the finish.  Mouthfeel - Lighter side of medium, carb is definitely medium and has just enough scrub and edges to cleanse the palate of the slight sweetness and spices to transition to the more roasted malts and crusts in the finish. Overall a very smooth and drinkable brew.  Overall - I really do get the pumpkin here, and this becomes more prominent as it warms, I would recommend drinking this one closer to 50 degrees to get the intended flavors. This really is a nice pumkin ale, a great representative of the style.

In the background you get that raw pumpkin meat taste with some brown sugar. Love it, DFH.  M: Medium-bodied with a pretty clean finish--leaves a little aftertaste, but in just a sweet, subtle way. Not too much carbonation, which lends to its smoothness. It really works.  O: This is my new favorite pumpkin ale. The only points it loses is being a liiiittle too big for this style. I, unlike many other reviewers, cannot really get a lot of alcohol smell, but I certainly taste it.  UPDATE: This afternoon DC is exhibiting some early Fall signs such as that burning smell in the air, and a bit of crispness when one walks in the shade...so I was in the mood to bust out the second DFH Punkin Ale from my 4-pack. And I'm noticing new things this time. A lot more brown sugar in the nose and taste than I noted in my original review. I don't know if I drank the first one too cold or what...but the caramel maltiness, brown sugar, and sweetness is coming out more this time around. Just thought I'd give a few additional thoughts on this one.

Smooth, and finishes warm, leaving that ""ethanol"" warmth from the bottom of your gut to the tip of your tongue. The flavor really hangs around for a bit.  O- Great beer to try! I had a few pumpkin ales, this is definitely one of the better ones. Everything comes together well, appearance, smell, taste/mouth feel.

T - A bit into the beer I detect some minuet presence of pumpkin, yet the beginning of the beer is overwhelmed by the spice and cinnamon, and not particularly in a good way.

It starts to come across with a nice creamy composition, although the fizzy nature of the carbonation really hurts the beer.

10099,6260,TheCorkStopsHere,4.17,"Tonight's stop on the pumpkin tour is the Dogfish Head Punkin' Ale. This is a pumpkin beer that started my love of pumpkin beers, and I'm excited to try it again this year.  Pours out a burnt orange color, on the darker side of amber. The foam is quite lively, a thick, fluffy, off-white head. The foam lasts for a relatively long time, and leaves a nice sticky lacing on the sides of the glass.  The aromas are a nice combination of pumpkin and spices. The pumpkin is not over-whelming, and neither are the spices, but it's a nice over-all balance between the two. So far this year, this smells the most like pumpkin pie of all these brews, which is (in my opinion) what I'm looking for in a pumpkin beer.  The palate and the mouth-feel is perfectly in-sync with the aromas. There's hefty amount of pumpkin flavors right up front, but then progresses nicely into a variety of pumpkin pie spices. It's not super-sweet, but there's definitely a hefty presence of malts here. As the Punkin' Ale warms, but sweetness fades a bit, and the spices really start to come through.  Well this is definitely a treat, the Dogfish Punkin' Ale is the best pumpkin beer I've had yet this year! Great amount of pumpkin flavors, as well as spices, and the two are balanced nicely. I really enjoy the Smashed Pumpkin for it's heavy, up-front pumpkin flavors; and the Heavy Seas Great Pumpkin for it's heavy use of pumpkin pie spices. The Dogfish Punkin' Ale is not too intense in any direction or the other, it's balanced just right.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,mattgreger,4.32,"This brew pours a very nice golden, copper color. It doesn't have much of a head, but what head it had was small and off white. It does leave a bit of sticky lacing throughout the brew however.  The aroma is very nice. Not over powering, but full of some amazing spices. They include, but aren't limited too cinnamon, allspice, brown sugar, caramel, nutmeg, and nice chunk of pumpkin. It smells just like a pumpkin pie at thanksgiving.  The flavors on this brew mix perfectly. Many times on pumpkin brews there is to much spice and not enough pumpkin or just the opposite and you get pumpkin water and no spice. But this brew goes down sweet and smooth, with a great sweet touch with the brown sugar. Its very nice.  A nice medium bodied brew, with a sweet, smooth mouthful. It also is at a perfect amount of carbonation for the style.  This is once again another great brew by DFH. One of the best Pumpkin brews I have had to date. PumKing is always been at the top of my list in this style, but this is a very close second. I stated earlier in the review, but the brown sugar stands out making this brew flavorful and sweet, but not to sweet.

10099,6260,vandemonian,4.04,This bottle of Dogfish Head Punkin Ale was around 4 months old when I had it. Punkin ale is a very nice pumpkin ale that isn't too dry or sweet and has a nice level of spice.  A: Orange/brown colour and a 4 mm head that fades fast. 3.5  S: Sweetness and spices (dominated by cinnamon). 4.5  T: Malty and slightly sweet with earthy spices.

Kind of like a boozy ginger bread cookie.  A - Clear orange with a quarter-inch off-white head and little lacing.  T - Upfront, a combination of pumpkin pie spice and hop bitterness (to a lesser extent). Bready, biscuity malts in the background provide a good base for the spice. A sugary sweetness emerges along with alcohol as the beer warms. A semi-sweet finish.  M - Medium carbonation. Moderate body. Alcohol warming present.  O - To me, the true test of a pumpkin beer is the ability to remind one of Fall and the feeling of Halloween. Upon reviewing this beer at the end of December, I was immediately taken back to feeling of attending Halloween parties and handing out candy to trick or treaters. This is a very well done pumpkin ale that is perfectly spiced and well balanced. A staple of the Fall. I look forward to it every year.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

A: Poured a massive creamy two fingered head. Poured a beautiful Fulvous with carbonation rising nicely.  S: The nice sweet dark malts are quite pleasant with the strong caramel that backs it up. The Nutmeg is definitely here with some additional spices.  T: The first few times I had this beer it had strong Nutmeg notes to it, but now it doesn't taste like that. The strong point to this is oddly it's allspice taste. This oddly does feel really sweet to me which I could only imagine is because of its malt quality. A slight bitterness bites as an aftertaste. As this warms up slightly the nutmeg exposes itself more. It doesn't really feel pumpkin, but with its spices this taste quite pleasant. This doesn't really carry the pumpkin that I hoped for though.  M: The lasting head gives this a nice creamy feel that stays on the lips. The body feels smooth and its carbonation makes it bite.  O: This is quite enjoyable.

10099,6260,BBP,3.95,"Pours brown between a brown ale and a IPA. Head is on the light side yet consistent. A dab of lacing.  The nose is spicy, yet not aggressively so. The base beer comes through a bit as well bringing some hops to the table.  The taste is a nice hybrid of the two main pumpkin beers I've seen so far, being either too plain or too spiced. It tastes somewhat like a desert beer while still being the kind of beer you could through a few back of casually.  The body is medium full and heavy. Carbonation is actually pretty low key in this and fills up the body without making itself too known.  All in all surprisingly good, considering that I'm not the biggest fan of Pumpkin Ales. I spotted this in a single, so I'm pretty happy I could buy it like that. I don't think I'd hesitate to buy it again though.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Medium/heavy carbonation. Light lacing.  S: Very spicy. Nutmeg and allspice cut through, followed by cinnamon and pumpkin. Slight sweetness is noticable.  T: Pumpkin is the predominant flavor, followed by spices and then a sweetness from the sugar. Aftertaste is spicy (nutmeg and a little allspice) and a touch malty. Hops are a mild/light component.  M: Medium body. Spices and pumpkin create a mf that is very full and stimulating to the palate. The spice notes on the aftertaste create a slightly tangy/bitter feeling, but leave you wanting another sip.  O: An excellent pumpkin beer. DFH hits it out of the park with this one. Great balance of many ingredients. Beer is ingredient heavy without overpowering the palate and all flavors come through.

10099,6260,deadonhisfeet,3.8,"Appearance - Very slightly hazy. Almost crystal clear. Nice amber color. Not much carbonation at all. Nose - Nice aromatic beer. I smell pumpkin and spices. Taste - This beer is quite malty and cookie-like with nice accents of pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice. It's a little sweet for my taste, but still quite good. Is it just me, or is there also just a slight touch of mint on the palate (probably from the hops)? Mouthfeel is a bit too syrupy. It's heavy on the palate. I can't imagine drinking more than one. Overall - A nice pumpkin beer. Almost certainly one of the best available, but in my opinion it falls far short of the offerings from Schlafly's and Southern Tier.

10099,6260,siege06nd,3.07,"Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint  A: This beer pours a slightly cloudy, light orange hue. Fades to a golden straw color on the sides. A little lighter than I am used to. About a finger of off-white head emerges and gradually settles to a quarter finger, idly resting atop the beer. Looks more like an IPA than a big, hearty pumpkin ale.  S: I admire the fact that the bouquet on Punkin' has a lot of roasted pumpkin. This isn't just a ""Pie Spices in a Beer"" pumpkin ale. I get a decent amount of the vegetable smell and I'm digging it. Just a hint of the brown sugar, clove, and cinnamon. Good job.  T: Roasted pumpkin, brown sugar, cinnamon, and allspice. Not pulling a lot in terms of malt or hop presence. The taste is certainly more spice forward, the vegetable notes take a step down here from the smell. Almost a medicinal finish.  M: I think this is were Punkin Ale suffers. Carbonation seems way too high for such a thin beer. The cinnamon (or is that allspice) really torches the back of my palate, too. Has a curiously dry, thin finish. Isn't a pumpkin ale supposed to be a savory treat? Mouthfeel here scream cheap and thin to me.  O: Not impressed. The beer smelled quite good, but the taste took a dive and the mouthfeel was poor. No malt presence to balance out the cloying and drying spices. Curiously high carbonation and an overwhelmingly thin feel. My guess is this would be a massive hit among the BMC drinkers, as it tastes like a Miller infused with pie spice.

10099,6260,Caterwaul,3.87,"Served in my trusty Weizen Glass  A: One of the most orange looking beers I’ve ever had. An aggressive pour yielded a healthy looking head that disappeared within about a minute.  S: Pumpkin and a little malt. Straight up. You may think I mean pumpkin pie. I don’t. It’s just… Pumpkin. The raw, fruiting body of plants from the Cucurbita genus.  T/M: Very odd; unlike most pumpkin beers, Punkin focuses more on the plant itself, rather than the spices which complement it. They’re there, to be sure! But the raw pumpkin itself is center stage. It’s very malty and sweet with intense pumpkin flavor, but the spices don't come out in a big way until the toasty, sweet finish.  O : I’d seen this one all over the place and had been meaning to give it a try. It’s certainly something unusual; the malt and raw pumpkin flavors seem to give this beer a sort of dual nature- sweet and mellow, but bright and fruity.

Certainly strange, but not as weird as the smell. I'm not really getting any of those ingredients listed on the bottle. Strange pepper, rootbeer, odd bitterness. Planty.

Color of the brew is golden orange and brilliantly clear. Head diminishes pretty quickly and leaves light covering of bubbles. Lacing is little.  Smell - When I smell this I immediately think ""holiday beer."" It just reminds me of the smells of the holidays and the turning of the seasons. The smells are pumpkin, brown sugar, nutmeg, slight hints of cinnamon and allspice, sweet candied sugar, and a smell of some caramel malts. Reminds me slightly of a nice warm cup of apple cider with a cinnamon stick in it. Very nice smelling indeed.  Taste - Much the same as the smell with nice complimentary tastes of pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugar, a bit of candy sugar sweetness and caramel malts. I don't really notice much allspice but maybe it's in there and I don't quite remember how allspice tastes. Again reminds me of apple cider with a cinnamon stick in it for some reason. Enjoyable.

It seems like they just mashed raw pumpkin into the beer and expected pumpkin pie. There's a tiny bit of spice, but it's immediately buried under a thick pile of bitter hoppiness and alcoholic burn.

This stuff is carbonated beyond all belief. You literally cannot drink it from the bottle. Mixes very badly with the astringent alcohol taste/burn and just amplifies it.  Overall - This stuff is flipping expensive for a severely disappointing beer (paid $10.45 for a four pack of 12oz bottles.)

It's honestly hard to get past these smells, but it's a pumpkin ale - what do you expect?  TASTE  Follows the nose, but less intense than the nose would lead to to believe. It's got some nice body and residual sweetness, but isn't thick or syrupy in the least bit. The alcohol is surprisingly a little hot, but not over the top. This isn't as intense of a spicy flavor as other pumpkin beers, but it has a nice amount of nutmeg, allspice, ginger, and cinnamon flavors. A very tasty brew. Is it pumpkin pie in a glass? Certainly not, but it's definitely pretty pumpkiny.  MOUTHFEEL  This is a medium-bodied beer, and finishes dry. The front and middle of the tongue is a nice sweetness, then by the end it's crisp and refreshing. It keeps you coming back for more after each sip. This is a beer that could be served either with a meal or after dinner, and that's a good quality to have.  OVERALL  I vant to drink your blood! That is, if it tastes like this beer... Muahahahaha! In all seriousness, this is one of my favorite pumpkin beers. The style is either hit or miss, and this one definitely is a hit in my opinion. It's not the potpourri-lile pimpkin ale, nor a pumpkin pie-like ale. It's Punkin. Nothing scary about this one.  Cheers.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Balanced flavors of freshly baked bread, earthy pumpkin, some bright spice, and a touch of caramel and toffee sweetness.  Medium bodied with ample carbonation.

10099,6260,eclaycamp,4.32,"12 ounce bottle poured into my dimpled mug. Punkin pours a relatively clear orange fading to amber, with a small head made up of very tiny bubbles that rise maybe a quarter of an inch above the liquid. The aroma is at once arresting and intoxicating; liquid pumpkin pie. Spices hit the nose first, with nutmeg, clove, and spice arriving simultaneously. Pumpkin follows, though there’s also this candied yams type character as well. From the moment the beer hits your lips you know you’re in for a treat, as a crusty malt backbone holds all of the pumpkin pie flavors in place. This beer is roughly a month old; and the taste is somewhat faded. My previous experience with this beer was near euphoric; the age on the beer hasn’t done it any favors, and dropped it into the echelon of very good. That’s not to say this beer is no longer worth your time, as it remains one of the shining examples of this style. The malt in this beer acts as a framing, much as a pie crust does in a pie. There are no hops here, and why should there be … this is a unique beer and hops would just get in the way of the flavor profile of the spices and pumpkin. Too often brewers get heavy handed with spicing beers of this type, luckily the folks at Dogfish have not fallen prey to this mistake. A very enjoyable take on the pumpkin beer style and one I wish that I could sample more often.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

My local megamart usually carries the same generic pumpkin ale and like a sap i buy it every year. This year, the mart had punkin for me to try instead of the usual garbage.

I pick out nutmeg, cloves, and floral hops that finish with a pumpkin hint.  Mouthfeel: the 7% is balanced nice with a mild carbonation and pumpkin aftertaste.

10099,6260,jondeelee,4,"Punkin Ale opens with a delicious pumpkin pie aroma, smelling perhaps slightly chemical, but largely of well-made pumpkin pie filling (pureed pumpkin, nutmeg, cinnamon, clove) and, somehow, a dollop of whipped cream. The spices gently overpower the pumpkin, at least on the nose. The malts and brown sugar combine to give the beer the sensation of a made-from-scratch pie crust, in addition to more beer-like aromas of fresh grain and yeasty baguettes.  On the tongue, the beer is immediately spicy, the nutmeg, cinnamon, and allspice fighting for dominance, leaving much of the pumpkin flavor clamoring for attention. Small doses of pumpkin do get through, tasting more canned than roasted, but are still tasty. A thick layer of brown sugar and malts brings heavy grain flavors to the brew, somewhat countering the spices. Darker fruit esters such as fig play in the background, joined by subtle hints of lychee nut, white grape, and grapefruit. A strong alcohol bite kicks at the soft palate if the beer is held on the tongue for long enough, and this bite lasts well into the aftertaste, providing a warming sensation. Other aftertaste flavors include the ever-present spices, as well as pureed pumpkin filling, and touches of toast, and the aftertaste--especially the spices--lingers for a very long time. Mouthfeel is medium, and carbonation is medium to medium-high.  Overall, this is a good pumpkin ale, though ""good"" is as good a rating as the beer deserves. There's nothing stellar about the brew, and the slightly overpowering presence of spices somewhat detracts from the flavor profile. And unlike many pumpkin beers, the pumpkin isn't front-and-center here, but simply adds a layer of flavor to what is otherwise a brown ale (unlike, say, Pumking, which tastes almost exclusively of pumpkin pie). Perhaps this is a good thing, as the pumpkin flavors do blend better here than in many brews. I only wish the spices did the same.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Taste: A toned down version of the smell with loads of malt and a good bit of hop bitterness that was not present in the smell. May seem a bit harsh, and it is not meant to be, but kind of tastes like burnt pumpkin pie really.  Mouthfeel: Lots of fizz (maybe a bit too carbonated) and a slightly more than medium body.

Spices lead the tongue too, followed by sweet pumpkin, without being syrupy. Mildly toasted - lots of fall packed into this one. Robust maltiness too lends some sweetness as well.

Overall Experience- This is a great pumpkin beer, I usually will buy early while my store still has it in stock and will hold onto it until it starts to get a little colder out around thanksgiving. the high alcohol keeps you warm as is a solid 4 pack to pick up.

10099,6260,weizenbob,4.26,"12 ounce bottle ($8.99/4-pack) purchased at Pere Marquette Expeditions in Ludington, MI. I'm on the side of the fence with the folks who look forward to Fall Pumpkin seasonals. This hit the shelves late out here and I wasn't sure if I'd get my hands on any Punkin this year. Expeditions pulled through again! ""Bottled in 2011"" is clearly printed on the neck of the bottle, followed by a cryptic series of numbers. I popped the top and poured into a nonic pint glass.  A standard bottle pour (horizontal bottle, 45 degree glass) yields a finger of ivory head that dissipates fairly quickly. Lacing slides down the glass as the head disappears. The beer is burnt orange in color and extremely translucent. A small quantity of fine bubbles lazily ascends the interior of the glass. The hue is enticing, though the overall visual lands in the middle.  One does not have to get too close to the glass to smell the goods. Pumpkin is forward in the nose. The label indicates that this has been brewed with brown sugar, and that is also noted in the nostrils. Allspice is recognizable, but this beer appears to be more about the pumpkin than the spice. Props for that. Traces of alcohol and diacetyl do much to add complexity to the aroma. It's may be the best smelling pumpkin ale I've bought this fall.  The flavor is a nice change of pace from most other commercially available pumpkin ales. I've come to expect a very plain base beer from this style with a lot of spice added for a pumpkin pie effect. Punkin Ale starts with a more robust base brew that brings to mind a mild brown ale that has had its gravity jacked up through the use of molasses. Even without the pumpkin and spice, Punkin's foundation has something to offer. Speaking of the pumpkin, it floats atop this assertively strong beer, delicately caressing the palate. Spices are much less aggressive than I've come to expect from the style, but still noted. Sweet sticky alcohol becomes a complimentary flavor rather than something that needs to be hidden for the enjoyment of the imbiber. The flavors are beautifully balanced with a depth and sophistication that I have found in no other pumpkin ale.  The beer is medium bodied with a nice velvety finish, likely from the moderately high alcohol content. Prickly carbonation feels fresh and lively and is mildly bittering in itself. The feel compliments the flavors well, adding up to what could be the easiest drinking 7% ABV beer you will drink this year. It's also the most modestly priced 4-pack I've seen on shelves in a while. Regardless of your feelings on pumpkin ale as a style, I promise that Punkin is nothing to scoff at.  ---  The Two-Schlitz Scale: (reference my profile for an explanation) I give two Schlitz all fall for this excellent pumpkin ale.

10099,6260,Cavery,3.52,"12oz left over from a social thing, figured I'd give it a scribble.  A: Nice transparent clear brown body that's suggestive of watery maple syrups and vitamin E pills. small ring formation of off white foams that do a decent job of sticking around for a while. Virtually no lacing, but a constant stream of bubbles starts from the bottom of the glass.  S: Lots of cider spice, nutmeg and pinches of cinnamon. Some raw cane sugar sweetness in the nose that definitely makes me think of fall inspired desserts. Much more of a sugary dessert casserole or unusual cinnamon rolls than anything squash or pie like. Some mellow earthy squash notes appear more as the brew warms.  T: Lots of nutmeg, some rustic crisp pumpkin flavor. Mellow but fairly balanced, nothing really pops to give it that dynamic flavor experience that separates okay beers from good ones. Spices coat the tongues after repeat sips in that it becomes all that you can taste. Every sip I take I feel like I'm taking another bite into a cheap microwaveable churro. I like the seasonings and general ingredients, but it just doesn't hit me in a quality fashion.  M: Medium full body, a nice support to hold up slow baked flavors. The carbonation accentuates a spiced up cider softness that elevates the drinking experience just enough to prevent me from shunning this beer. A bit more of a head would certainly elevate the drinkability of this one for me, as it lacks a complimentary creamy feel.  O: Not a terrible beer, it's just not a great pumpkin beer to me. Flavors are really mellow and tame, but the flavors mix well. The nutmeg/cinnamon aspect really dominates the drink for me, while the squashy pumpkin comes off as a secondary flavor via a slight linger. Perhaps I'd try this again on tap, but it really just tastes like another generic pumpkin beer to me. Though I will say despite being very tame/mellow, it's well balanced. A decent beer that is probably quite a bit better super fresh.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

The pumpkin is so well integrated into the solid malt core of this beer. It makes for a pumpkin bread like aroma with a firm note of sweet alcohol. Maybe a little too firm as it gives a bit of an edge that detracts a touch. An earthy hop balance is a nice counter to the sweet stuff. Taste is a unique combination of grainy malt and pumpkin that gives an overall dryness to the brew. Some nice spices with cinnamon and nutmeg. Lightly burnt caramel and fusel alcohol sweetness flow into a bready finish with earth and faint graham. Feel is medium weight and mildly carbonated. Kind of a cross between a regular and imperial. It is pretty drinkable so use caution. As it warms the alcohol tucks in a bit and the malt reveals a light coffee flavor that also shows in the nose. Drinkability goes up and the overall taste profile improves both just under the next score up.

Just right  M: Full bodied with mild carbonation  O: I can't say enough about this beer. As I've been going on quite a fall-seasonal beer tear, this has got to be the best thus far.

It’s fresh, though.  Appearance (4.5): Beautiful, clear ruby-amber body, with two fingers of off-white head of fine bubbles fading to half a finger with a bit of lace on the sides.  Smell (3.5): Very nice balance between cinnamon-allspice spice mix, and a caramel-y malt base that smells like pumpkin roasted with brown sugar over some nice, rich barley. Grassy, slightly piney hops mixed in well, too. Still, could be more fragrant.  Taste (4.0): There’s the nutmeg, but it doesn’t come in an overpowering sort of way—this is nice, relatively modest and well-balanced. The spices move back and forth, nutmeg stealing the spotlight here, allspice here, cinnamon not so much though. It’s there, just in the back. The pumpkin itself is a little tame. A slightly medicinal aftertaste comes in last, due to the mix of toasted malt and grassy hops—and possibly the nutmeg; it’s not bad, though, and mellows out as it warms. Yeast isn’t quite neutral, maybe it’s the grassy hops but it has an English feel.  Mouthfeel (4.0): Lighter side of medium, just a bit of oil and wonderfully carbonated. Smooth bubbles moving back and forth, very nice feel.  Overall (4.0): Punkin is very well balanced. What I hate about most pumpkin beers is the overemphasis on spice. Take a sniff, take a sip, and it’s half the spices in your cabinet flying in your face all at once with no tact whatsoever. Generally speaking I don’t like beers that are overpoweringly this, that or anything—I like the balance, the integration, the dance of flavors. This actually does that pretty well. My one complaint is, I wish there was some more pumpkin. I always seem to want more pumpkin from my pumpkin beers.

Appearance: Punkin ale does its best to look like a pumpkin, coming out of the bottle with a copper amber hue, mostly transparent with a small, fast-fading eggshell head.  Smell: The aroma has everything that was advertised. In order of dominance, I get cinnamon, nutmeg, pumpkin, and all spice with light grain notes in the background.  Taste: The flavor starts a little bit sweet, with some vanilla cream and cereal grain malts. Cinnamon and nutmeg start the spiciness, with pumpkin and allspice provide a lot of the driving flavor toward the middle and end. There is a light spciy bitterness at the end, but it barely interferes with the mostly clean finish.  Mouthfeel: Despite being light colored and transparent, this body has some depth to it. On the full side, it is almost chewy. The carbonation is understated and lightly crisp, and there is almost no residue of any kind left afterward.  Overall: This was an easy to drink pumpkin beer.

Smells more like the pumpkin filling to me rather than a pumpkin pie that is baked.  T: Bitter taste with a noticeable pumpkin spice on there, finishes with the fruit like it smells. This beer doesn't go down as smooth as some of the other pumpkins I've tried, and keeps the bitter taste throughout. Not a horrible taste, but not the best. *EDIT* I really need to finish the whole beer before submitting. This got better after it sat for awile. Going to take it up to a 4 on this from a 3.5  M: Medium feel on this one, carbonation is there and the bitterness is present. Just not as smooth as I would like.  O: This one is worth a shot if you like it more on the bitter side. This doesn't reflect a great deal of the pumpkin style to me, more of a fall offering.

Out of the bottle this beer is very good! I have never had it on tap but hope to change that. Of the pumpkin beers I have had this has the most body behind it.

Head was about a finger with a rigorous pour, kills down to a slim fade over the beer, nice white tight bubbles.  Smell - Cinnamon and nutmeg are right up front which is surprising, i remember drinking this 2 or 3 years ago and not remembering it at all. Maybe it is my changed smell. It also smells like completely new malted barley that you would throw right into the boil kettle, sugary and sweet. Brown sugar in the backbone.  Taste - For me, a little thin. Nutmeg, cinnamon, brown sugar and balanced. However for me it feels like it is missing something, i can't really put my finger on it. Great breadyness and malt, no hops for me or bitterness, incredibly smooth. Dont get me wrong, a delicious brew.  Mouthfeel - Very nice, almost chewy like an imperial stout, no lie, carbonation is light so it helps the tastes coat the mouth, alcohol burn is very late in the throat but in a warming way like an apple pie.  Overall - This beer is exceptional. It does not do things like pumpking where it is over the top and is not crappy like lagers with crappy pumpkin pie spice tossed in the boil or fermenter. You can TELL this has been well taken care of, i kind of wish the pumpkin shined through as much as the spices.

It's a beautiful copper and the dogfish head logo looks good on it. The labelling is fine, it's kind of funny that it says ""punk"" on the top label. BA has this listed as a pumpkin ale, but the label says it's a full-bodied brown, as indicated above. The color is a darker copper and the beer poured with about 1 finger of off white head that was not very persistent. Nothing too impressive about the apperance of the beer itself.  S - not much aroma for me until about halfway through the glass. When present has a nice brown sugar and molasses smell. Maybe a hint of pumpkin.  T - really tasty. Like candied brown sugar, fall spices and a hint of pumpkin I suppose. To be honest, if i didn't know this was a pumpkin beer I'm not sure the pumpkin flavor is strong enough for me to mention. But what I do taste is really great. We drank two bottles of this pretty quick. Taste is the best feature of this beer.  M - astringent on the lips when drinking, softer in the mouth at first, but with an astringency in the aftertaste. But, it's not too bad.  O - despite some criticisms of finer points, this beer tastes great and is really easy and enjoyable to drink. It may not be a full feast for the senses, but I still liked this very much.

Appears to have moderate carbonation.  As far as pumpkin spice presence, this isn't the strongest. Personally this has one of the better aromas for a pumpkin beer. Its nicely balanced. Pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, molasses and brown sugar. Unlike other pumpkin beers this has a nice malt presence too.  I still believe this is the best pumpkin beer out there. Its much more balanced, while still maintaining its ""pumpkin pie"" characteristics. Starts out with a light hop bite, that doesn't last long. This transitions nicely into the spiciness of the allspice, which then comes in the cinnamon, nutmeg, molasses, maybe even some honey. The finish on the beer is rounded out by some nice brown sugar and malt profile. There is a slight finish of alcohol as well.  Mouthfeel makes this beer that much better. Nicely medium bodied, where as other pumpkin beers fall short. Just the right amount of carbonation too.  This is the best pumpkin beer I've tried so far.

Faint pumpkin flavor seems to break through in the taste. No hop taste as the spices mask those within.

There is a bit of doughy and lightly fruity yeast character as well. No hop aroma whatsoever. Taste is very similar to the aroma, with the malt really dominating and no bitterness to counter it. The spiciness and the 7% abv offset the maltiness somewhat.  Mouthfeel is smooth and thinner bodied than I expected. Low carbonation.

It is subtle on the spices so you have to know what just pumpkin tastes like to really pick up on it. The cinnamon I get the most with the vegetable pumpkin taste throughout. Absolutely delicious beer.  I never thought I'd be that into pumpkin beers until I tried this one. So, you can pretty much say this is the beer that turned me onto pumpkin beers. Good job Dogfish head we love you.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

T: pumpkin spice off the blocks. there is an ale malty backbone in there, but mostly spicey. which i believe a pumpkin beer should be. finish is very nutmeggy.  M: lively mouthfeel and refreshingly medium body.  D: tasty, but i was expecting a little more meat on this one. super drinkable and it is hard to even note the 7% abv nametag. however, like i said, i was expecting some more punch of pumpkin/body.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

10099,6260,NWer,3.68,Strictly an impulse buy from large display next to checkout at my local Central Market. Poured into non-descript glass. OK everything. Mildly pleasant taste but I have to wonder what all the fuss is about if this is typical of pumpkin beers. Certainly not worth the price markup. I got nothing out of it worth savoring.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Not really tasting any pumpkin at all.  m: medium to high carbonation.  o: My first pumpkin ale. A bit disappointed as I wish the pumpkin was more predominant. Not a bad beer in itself but not something I'd go out of my way to try in the future.

10099,6260,marikoangel,4.13,"Poured into a Dogfish Head glass at Amsterdam  A: It pours a clear medium dark pumpkin orange and a fingers worth of white head. There is fine carbonation and fine spotty lacing running down the glass, that doesn't stick long. It's a great color!  S: The nose is spice and bread, and a little pumpkin. There is some pumpkin spice - cinnamon, allspice, but is nicely balanced by the bready/yeasty malts that prevents it from smelling completely like pumpkin pie, and making it smell more like a yummy pumpkin beer instead.  T: The flavors are similar to the nose; some spice and some bready notes. It's bready and yeasty but there is light hints of pumpkin and spice. It's a little more bready in the flavor than the nose. There is a small hint of hops in the middle, then finishes a little sweeter, but nicely mellow.  M: A medium mouthfeel. Low and small carbonation with a creamy finish.  O: Overall it's a great pumpkin beer; one of the best that I've had. I find it hard to find a good pumpkin beer, and this one hits the spot as being well done. It has that nice hint of pumpkin and spice without going overboard. It's easygoing, and a nice one to sip and enjoy. Delicious!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,Minkybut,2.7,I poured this pumpkin beer into my tumbler at 45 degrees. I had seen it on the TV on a show about the brewery and wanted to try it as it sounded pretty good.

10099,6260,DCon,4.27,"Received a 12 fl. oz. bottle of this from LarryG & shared w/ GeoffTheAleMan. Poured from the bottle with ""PUNK"" on the throat of the bottle & ""Full bodied brown ale brewed with real pumpkin, brown sugar, allspice, cinnamon & nutmeg"" on the front label into a 16oz Pint Glass. Has BOTTLED IN: 2011 1023 on the front of the bottle.  Aroma- Awesome brown sugar and good pumpkin aroma in the beginning. The cinnamon they mention comes up a it light in the aroma but lets see about the flavor!  Appearance- Pours a 1 finger head but dies quickly. The body is a golden/whiskey color that has decent clarity surprisingly. No big time lacing but some suds.  Flavor- Has a dominant cinnamon in the beginning and then the pumpkin finally comes in at the finish. The pumpkin was nice but seemed like the whipped cream and cinnamon dominated this brand of pie!  Mouthfeel- Light-Medium Bodied, Medium-High Carbonation, and leaves pumpkin on the palate. Not harsh but smoother than other pumpkin ales.  Overall Impression- While it is the most reviewed/enjoyed Pumpkin ale, Schlafly still brings more flavor and strength! Had nice pumpkin attributes but the cinnamon was WAY to dominant. I enjoyed this thoroughly but could drink 4 more of these. Thanks again to LarryG for the trade!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

T: A pungent mash of the above smells as flavors, combined with a tangy bread flavor. It's a bit strange, but overall easy to accept.  M: High carbonation, medium dry finish.  O: As far as Pumpkin Ales go, I'm not very experienced. I imagine that this would pair very well with desert, but I'm not really sold on this beer being exceptional or exciting.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

10099,6260,BeerImmediately,4.29,"12oz into wide mouth glass.  Pours with virtually no head (just a persistent ring) over a fairly clear iced tea to orange colored body. Just a touch of carbonation flowing up.  Aromas are sweet, balanced, and inviting. The typical cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove are predominant. A bit of burnt log. Some wheat bread in the back, and some vegetal (pumpkin flesh) aromas as it warms.  Mouthfeel is slightly richer than expected, and flavors carry some roasted pumpkin seeds, cinnamon toast, just a touch of navel orange bitterness, but mostly sweet pie filling. Good level of carbonation keeps the mouthfeel fairly crisp, given the ABV.  Overall, this is a classic in the Pumpkin Ale category - not just because DFH started brewing it over 15 years ago, but also because it represents the style spot on, and is really enjoyable in aroma, flavor, and mouthfeel.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,dorianmarley,3.68,"The appearance is dark, golden, amber orange with a light head.  The smell is a light roasted malt with orange and a hint of spice.

The beer is very smooth and drinkable; light for a pumpkin ale.

A bit of nutmeg, cinnamon is present, and just an ever so faint smell of pumpkin. Honestly a bit of a disappointment in the nose.  T - What it may have lacked in the nose, it seems to make up a bit for it in the taste. A full taste for sure, lots of spice and brown sugar. Some notes of that cinnamon and nutmeg, a slight bit of bitterness from the pumpkin. It's a more subtle taste, but still pretty good.  M - Pretty smooth mouth, a bit sticky, somewhat of an unpleasant aftertaste, but it's pretty weak.  Overall - A decent pumpkin ale here. I've had much better, I've had much worse. I would have liked for the pumpkin to have been a little more pronounced here, it's almost too subtle.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,Phelps,3.58,"Enjoyed in a Shaker Pint at Mellow Mushroom.  A gorgeous sunset-orange with shimmering notes of metallic copper and just a little haze. Half a finger of light tan foam leaves thin webs of lace.  In the nose: nutty roasted pumpkin and allspice first, with cinnamon, almond and nutmeg dancing in the background. Some odd tanginess lingers.  The pumpkin found in the flavor seems less ripe — sharper, almost. Some cider, cinnamon, allspice and brown sugar can be picked up. The tang is here too, gripping the back sides of the tongue. A bit light.  Smooth medium-light body with fairly high, near-painful carb. Soft warmth in the throat and a clean, quenching finish.  Punkin’s not too heavy on the pumpkin flavors, but it’s enjoyable and drinkable. In the end, that’s all I really expected from it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Not as much in the nose as I was expecting, which is probably a good thing. I don't like overly-spiced pumpkin/winter/seasonals at all. No ""natural flavorings"", please.  The taste is a balanced blend of spices and a malty, meaty base beer that shines through. A detectable hop bitterness adds a nice finishing touch, and helps keep the palate clean towards the end. Warming alcohol and brown sugar notes persist after the finish.  Excellent mouthfeel, not too sweet or dry, just right. Good carbonation. Highly drinkable.  Overall, probably the best pumpkin beer I've tried this year. A refreshing change from the liquid-candy-in-a-bottle approach that everyone seems to go for. Definitely considering buying some more of this one.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

10099,6260,southside,3.21,"This is a bit different than most pumpkin ales. This has much more spice coming from the nutmeg and cinnamon additions, and a nice sweetness from the brown sugar but not too overbearing. This is more of a spice type of beer with some pumpkin flavoring, rather than the pumpkin being the main focus of the taste. Definitely interesting and worth trying, especially if you aren't always fond of how sweet pumpkin ales can be.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

S - Brown sugar, pumpkin pie spices, nutty aromas, with a nice malt background blend together for the smell.  T - Pumpkin spice flavor absolutely dominates. Sweet malts and nuttiness in the background but up front its cinnamon, allspice, brown sugar, ginger, pumpkin, etc. The usual flavors you find in pumpkin pie.  M - Medium bodied, perfect carbonation leaving the beer fairly thicker than you would expect and keeping the flavors sticking to your mouth. Finish is sweet and sticky with the spice flavors staying around finishing overall with the sweet malts and nutty flavor.  O - One of the better pumpkin beers I have had.

10099,6260,akorsak,3.8,"On tap at Al's. Shared with ksak.  A: The pumpkin ale is a darker coppery color, a penny from the bottom of the change jar perhaps. Still transparent though, I can see through the glass. The white head is small, not worth dwelling on.  S: The nose is spicy. I mean really spicy. Nutmeg and cinnamon, nuts, brown sugar, and allspice. Packaged with all of that is a pulpy, starchy pumpkinness. Very busy but not over-spiced.  T: The taste brings the spice back with a vengeance. Cinnamon and nutmeg stand out, as do the other components of the nose. The ale feels thicker, perhaps the starches in the pumpkin are driving that. A lower carbonation level allows the spices to last just a little longer. A decent seasonal, albeit from my least favorite style.  M: A rich ale, the spices get a little heavy at times.

Sam and his team of brewers are super creative and have done much to promote and grow craft brewing, but I do not always like their beers.  I tried this beer for three seasons in the past four - always wondering if it was just me or maybe I had purchased a beer leftover from the past year and not in the best shape, but alas it has always disappointed. Fans of it tell me that it is unique in that their is a significant hop presence. I just find it muddled and murky with regards to flavors, although I like their clean lines/packaging with regards to the bottle. I will stick with my choices of The Bruery Autumn Maple (not truly a pumpkin beer), Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin, and Southern Tier's Pumpkin (although it is not as good as past years and it seems that it is has much more vanilla flavor this year).

The alcohol was well hidden though, and I was surprised this is 7%.  Mouthfeel – Lightly carbonated, mildly creamy.

It's not overly sweet and not overpowering, which works pretty well. It smells quite rich overall.  The taste is a lot more sweet up front than the aroma, then fades to the pumpkin spice flavor I picked up earlier.

It pours a clear tawny-amber topped by a half-finger of dirty cream-white foam. The nose comprises apple juice, cinnamon, nutmeg, and caramel. Save the light spicing, there ain't too much pumpkin (pie or otherwise) character going on here so far. The taste holds notes of mandarin orange syrup, cinnamon, green apple skin, brown sugar, nutmeg, and a very light bit of toasted rye bread. The pumpkin character is still pretty nonexistent, but at least the combination tastes good. The body is a rather light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slick feel. Overall, a more-than-decent brew, but not exactly the most pumpkin-y thing out there. Generally enjoyable, though...",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,mentaltraveller,4.2,I really enjoyed this beer. This was my first pumpkin ale because the idea never really appealed to me. It pours a nice brown/orange color. The pumpkin is very present in the smell. The taste and mouthfeel of this beer are excellent. This beer is smooth and drinkable with a sprightly carbonation and nearly creamy feel. The taste of pumpkin and brown sugar match the hops for a surprisingly balanced beer. Highly recommended.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,keithmurray,3.6,"Appearance - clear amber color with slight white head  Smell - pumpkin, nutmeg, cinnamon  taste - pumpkin, some spices such as clove, nutmeg, cinnamon, a bit hoppier than I hoped it would be, none of the brown sugar detected as mentioned on the bottle, bitterness at the back of the mouth  Mouthfeel - medium bodied, highly carbonated, pumpkin flavor lingers on the tongue and in my burps, not as malty or as sweet as I envisioned  overall - somewhat of a letdown considering all of the high praise, drinks more like a red/amber ale with a pumpkin kick more than anything else. Needs more Malty sweetness for my tastes. Not a bad beer, but I am admittedly new to the world of pumpkin ales and I hope to find better/more malty examples  Price point - $8.99/4pk",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,RickS95,3.47,"A little more clear than I'd like, but that's probably the American way. It's a light to medium brown with a thin white head that has no retention.  A bit of spice in the nose, but it seems more savory than sweet. Allspice and nutmeg, but they're both muted. However, the pumpkin is actually prevalent in this beer.  I can get some of the flavors of pumpkin pie, but there needs to be a bit more sweetness. Brown sugar is mentioned on the bottle, but I'm not picking it up.  It's ok in the mouth, nothing dominates or is offensive. A bit spicy, but that's expected. A slightly dry finish.  Not a bad beer for the style, but there are better beers out there.

S - With all the spices listed on the label, it's hard to discern individual smells.  T - Overloaded with spices and very little pumpkin taste, which disappointed me. The cinnamon is somewhat muted along with the pumpkin but I did get tons of allspice. I was hoping to taste more pumpkin.  M - Great medium bodied with the right amount of carbonation.

A: Pours a perfect amber, leaning towards the darker side, with a small half finger very light khaki head that that fades into a thin ring and small pillow of film in the center from the etching.  S: Pretty disappointing. It's hard to pick up anything. Slight pumpkin and a slight cinnamon, but that's about it.  T: Very light pumpkin and then the spices take over. The allspice is leading the way with a slight cinnamon. Malts are the backbone for this. So far my expectations have not been met.  M: Nice mouthfeel. Good carbonation, medium bodied. Slight spice left on the palate.  O: Wow was I let down. After having Pumpking I was very happy to get a 4-pack of this and try them side-by-side.

Spicy. Not much pumpkin flavor.  M: Medium bodied. A bit creamy, but not as smooth as others. Soft carbonation.

Pours medium amber to honey gold color, whitish head retains well, eventually dissipating to lacing.  Smells of pumpkin, sweet potato and nutmeg.  Tastes like pumpkin and nutmeg with some caramel and again the sweet potato flavor follows. Pretty smooth.  Body is moderate with a mild tingle of carbonation and slight alcohol warmth.  This is an incredibly well balanced pumpkin ale which makes it a real treat to have. Not the best pumpkin beer but in the upper echelons. Definitely not something to pass up.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,LeeryLeprechaun,3.75,"I got to try this beer on tap which was quite nice. The beer was a wonderful deep orange color and came out of the tap with about two fingers of white head. The head did not stick around but was replaced by a nice sweet pumpkin aroma that really set up this whole beer. The beer tasted sweet and of pumpkin, not pumpkin pie or pumpkin spice, but pumpkin. The beer finished sweet and left you wanting another sip. Overall it was a very nice seasonal beer. I would not want to drink it year round but it is a nice holiday treat!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,Greywulfken,4.3,"Not quite as wowed by this beer as I anticipated, but I realize now that I must be partial to the pint-sized-type pumpkin ales, which seem generally slightly stronger and sweeter. This is good for those who like a drier pumpkin ale.  This beer reminded me of the Weyerbacher pumpkin ale I tried last week, but a little more refined.  A: medium orange-brown ale with an ivory head  S: sugary, not as powerful a pumpkin as others I've had (lower abv)  T: a solid good-tasting beer, not too sweet or too strong, satisfying  M: once warmed, very smooth drinking, carbonation apparent, light vegetal/spice aftertaste  O: the anticipation of the release had me expecting the greatest pumpkin ale yet. I got a real good ale for the season.  As I come back to this beer, having been won over by DFH this past year or so, and having tried a greater variety of non-imperial and 12 oz pumpkin ales, I have to improve Punkins marks somewhat, because I appreciate it more than the first time I had some.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

It has a fingernail length dusty white head, which has nice retention. The beer is clear with a good inner light and very steady carbonation.  S: Punkin Ale has a wonderful aroma of pumpkin, brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg. There is also slight hop note.  T: Starts off with spice and a bit of bitterness, but quickly moves into nutmeg, sugar and malt. The finish shows off the cinnamon heat and the earthy, starchy flavors of the pumpkin along with some slight sweetness.  M: Medium with some cream.  O: Dogfish succeeded in producing a very good pumpkin ale. All the flavors of the pumpkin pie spices are balanced well in this beer along with the pumpkin itself. The beer never becomes too sweet, and there is even a slight hop bitterness backbone to balance. If you prefer your pumpkin beers to be on the sweeter pie side, this one may not be for you.

Smell is nice and spicy, with enough color to it to make it apparent that it really is a pumpkin ale, but not so much as to overwhelm you with the individual ingredients of it.  First sip is quite well bodied. There is a predominant spice component to it; however the overall feel of the beer doesn't appear to be put too off kilter with it being there. Carbonation is solid and quite complementary. The aftertaste does a great job at finishing the beer, all the while giving off several unique flavors that aren't perceived anytime other than there.  As pumpkin beers go, this one should be the one you judge all others off of. It really is a solid find.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Nose Caramel, brown sugar, pumpkin meat, ginger, toast and nutty malts.  Taste Allspice and ginger. Caramel, toasted bread, brown sugar and nutty malts form the backbone. Light notes of pumpkin meat and nutmeg.  Mouthfeel Medium bodied, crisp, clean, slightly silky and well carbonated.  Overall Always one of my go-to Pumpkin Ales during the season. The base beer tastes like a mix between and English Brown Ale and an Oktoberfest. Decent amount of pumpkin flavoring and well blended spices. One of the better standard Pumpkin Ales.  2011 Review  A: Pours a clear orange/amber with a half finger of head that dissipates quickly. There's a very thin layer of tight lacing that webs out around the glass. Very tiny carbonation bubbles spread lightly throughout the glass.  N: Caramelized brown sugar, biscuity malts, a touch of pumpkin along with cinnamon, nutmeg and a hint of clove.  T: Starts with brown sugar, caramel and biscuit malts upfront. This is followed by just a hint of pumpkin, toasted pie crust, allspice and cocoa. Finishes earthy with equal parts nutmeg and cinnamon. Just a touch of clove.  M: Medium bodied, semi-creamy, smooth and subtly sticky.  O: I really expected a darker body for a ""full-bodied brown ale."" It's a good thing all the Brown Ale flavors seem to be there for the most part. Kudos to Dogfish Head for trying a different ale base for this pumpkin beer. Easily one of my favorite fall releases.

10099,6260,devinoconnor,3.95,"Very good pumpkin ale from Dogfish. Pours a brown ambler with a finger of foam. Nice look to it.  Smell is nicely balanced with spice and pumpkin. However, the spice seems to outweigh the pumpkin which is a problem.  More of the same in the taste. Cinnamon and nutmeg outweigh and overpower what pumpkin there is in the ale. I'd love a little less spice and more of what it's supposed to be: pumpkin.  Goes down very easy for a 7% ABV.

Taste: Pumpkin, brown sugar, cinnamon, spices, and caramel maltiness.  Mouthfeel: medium/full body and not over-carbonated.

10099,6260,litheum94,4.17,"2011 Vintage.  Amber body with an active, tan-tinged head. Fizzles out quickly, leaving a ring of foam and a mist in the middle.  Spice fills the air: nutmeg, cinnamon and brown sugar, with fleshy pumpkin. Cola aromas as well.  An all-out spice attack, like sprinkling pumpkin pie spices in the palm of your hand and licking it. Nutmeg and cinnamon dominate. Caramel malts with a slightly syrupy mouthfeel, like cola. Sweet, fleshy pumpkin in the background. A little bit of burn on the finish. Not sure if that's from the spices or some alcohol poking through.  If you don't like spiced beers, stay away from this year's Punkin. I for one love this year's batch.

Very balanced with equal amounts of spice, bread, and subtle pumpkin smell. The breadyness is somewhat reminiscent of some oktoberfest beers that I have had.  Taste. Starts with a nice slightly bitter and slightly tart pumpkin flavor. This quickly gets taken over by the spices: nutmeg, clove and cinnamon. This is slowly joined by a building bready sweetness. The finish is slightly bitter and slightly dry.  Mouthfeel. Pretty standard medium body with a medium to high amount of carbonation.  An enjoyable beer. Like many pumpkin ales though the spices take away some of the subtlety that I enjoy in a good brew.

10099,6260,jpro,4.04,"Picked up a four-pack at Carrboro Beverage Co. and served up the first one into a New Belgium globe -  A: Pours a crystal clear amber, with a light beige, one-finger head; good retention, but no lace; not really “brown” as the label implies.  S: Raw pumpkin! A nice change of pace from all the super-spiced pumpkin beers out there; some light cinnamon and “fall spice” in there, but the actual pumpkin aroma is much bigger.  T: Pretty much like biting into the inside wall of a pumpkin or stuffing a handful of pumpkin guts in your mouth; some clove is on the end, for sure, but its not too powerful and seems to do a good job complementing the earthy bitterness that rounds things out.  M: Medium-bodied; high carbonation; a little zing, too.  D/O: The true pumpkin flavor on this one is nice... you can actually taste / smell pumpkin - not allspice galore. The higher abv and clovey-ness may hamper drinkability - but overall, a nice, perhaps more “traditional” pumpkin ale - like George Washington used to make.  *interested to see how this compares to my growler review from last year*",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,nmbr0ne,4.27,"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: Great copper color. Semi transparent with not a lot of lacing. The head turns into a thin ring sticking to the glass as the level of the beer decreases.  Smell: The smell is awesome. It smells just like the description says. You get a hint of pumpkin and brown sugar that is overpowered by strong notes of cinnamon and nutmeg. The spics definitely give a great aroma to the beer. The slightest smell of alcohol is also present, but I feel it is negligible.  Taste: Once again the taste is overpowered by the spices which is the only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 4.5 because I wanted it to taste more like pumpkin. Instead, I got hints of sweet potato pie, but I think that's because of the nutmeg and cinnamon. It's very sweet when it first hits the tongue. The cinnamon comes very strong as a lingering after taste. It isn't unbearable though.  Mouthfeel: Surprisingly I find it very smooth and crisp. It's really refreshing. I expected it to be thicker, syrupy-like because of the sugars and the different ingredients that were added. I was happy with the actual outcome though.  Overall: Thanksgiving came early this year, and this is definitely a brew I am thankful for. But as my first pumpkin ale, it will be a difficult one to beat.

S-October spices and pumpkin. The nutmeg and pumpkin really makes this one smell just like pumpkin pie. A bit of alcohol. Smells good for the style.  T-More of the October spices. A really blatant, and unattractive taste of metal. Tastes like copper. The metal taste lasts. Not too much real pumpkin flavor. The cinnamon and nutmeg last with the metal.  M-Medium body. Mellow carbonation. A slightly slick feel. The metallic taste won't go away.  O/D-If not for the metallic twang that sticks on the tongue, I would think this was a pretty decent pumpkin beer.

Some bubbles with a light orange, very clear beer. Good lacing.  S: Bready. Subtle spices, mostly obviously, allspice.  T: Yummy. The brown sugar mentioned on the label is more obvious here than in the smell. That particular sweetness, combined with nutmeg, cinnamon, and clove, conspire to call to mind holiday pies, but not necessarily pumpkin. Perhaps the 'real pumpkin' used instead of manufactured pumpkin puree has less of an obvious flavour, but without the label, I'm not sure I would peg this as a pumpkin beer.  M: Smooth and thick at times, light and carbonated near the end. A well-balanced mouthfeel.  O: Not my favourite, but a worthy product, even if I do prefer some other pumpkin ales (notably, Williamsburg AleWerks'). Still, this is a good beer and a must-try for DFH aficionados.

Pretty basic, but solid and pleasing to the eyes.  A mild mix on the nose of squash like pumpkin puree, nutmeg cinnamon and brown spice, mixed with a nice bready malt action. Pretty cool.  Taste follows the nose. Squash and mushy pumpkin hits first with a cinnamon front, then gives to a nutmeg and bready hop presence on the finish.

Another year of experience has changed things for me :( I better quit drinking beer, or no.  The head looked good initially, but something in the body must be antifoam because it didn't want to stick around. Dark amber opaqueness is alright.  Nutmeg and allspice are such a presence in the nose, but are covered up in the taste. Strong booze, molasses, and spruce shadow everything else. It almost tastes like a lighter version of Anchor's 2010 christmas beer. Where's the pumpkin? There's a bit of savory squash in the finish, but herbal, piny hops make their presence known until the taste clears. There's a bit of a lactic acid that shows up at the start and lingers.

But it is not overwhelming and strong, but gentle yet distinct. Tasting the beer, the pumpkin and cinnamon build the front, being met with nutmeg, brown sugar and allspice in the middle. The end is rounded up with a malty finish. Actually the is somehow some balance in all his flavors. A very nice approach to make a fall beer.

Wondering if they’ve ever added ginger and cloves to the mix, as that’s what’s missing for a pie.  The beer is lighter than I expected. The carbonation gives it a nice mouthfeel.

S: Sugary sweet as far as the spices go, expecting the taste to be on the heavy side like a shipyard's smashed pumpkin (pugsley's series) compared to a lighter, warming sensation from the spices like Southern Tier's Pumking.  T: The smell did not lead me astray, extremely heavy pumpkin taste. The spices sit on your pallet and do not want to leave. I would say for a brown pumpkin ale the taste is spot on, just not for me. I could use some vanilla notes to balance out the harsh spice that is coming across as bitter. Not the biggest fan of pumpkin pie but if you but on some whip cream and I'll devour the whole thing, my favorite part being the crust.  M: Liquid form of pumpkin pie. Feels just like eating pie and there really isn't a lingering alcohol presence for a higher strength brew. Definitely a hefty bitterness from the spices stays around in the back on the mouth.  D: Not a beer I'm begging for seconds.

I saw this one and snagged two 4 packs while I could.  Look: Poured a fairly clear orangeish copper color – tinges of yellow around the edges. Head was a white layer of foam that didn’t hang around long. Very active carbonation bubbles made their way to the top.  Smell: I picked up on the typical pumpkin pie spices. Brown sugar, allspice, cinnamon etc… Also a lager quality in the nose, which I think is nice for pumpkin ale.  Taste: Biscuity yeast hit for a split second and then a semisweet pumpkin faded into a nice continuous spice with carbonation tingling the tongue. A warming sensation became part of the palate after the first few sips. The finish was a semisweet brown sugar with spices lingering for a minute or so.  This is a very enjoyable and complex pumpkin ale. It was not overpowering and definitely not too sweet like so many other pumpkin ales. If you find this – be sure to grab it up.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,2xHops,4.32,"It's been a while since I had a Punkin Ale! I think It's been couple of years.  How I have forgotten how good it is for this style. It's not my favorite style at all, but I think this hits the spot as opposed to some other pumpkin ales I have drank.  The aroma was kicking it up for me with spices and nutmeg really hitting my nose. The appearance of the beer was enticing as it should be. Well, maybe that's the knowledge I'm going to get relatively high ABV that got me excited?  The taste is reflective of what I smelled, and that's always good. The nose stimulates your palate, eh? I certainly can taste the nutmeg and whatever spices they're putting in this beer! I admit, I can't pinpoint anything else, really. It tastes just dang good. It doesn't overpower you as some other lesser pumpkin ales would.  Mouthfeel's just right. What can I say?  Overall, I think I can only handle this once a year, because the spices are too much for me. It doesn't mean it's bad, it's just a strong flavor profile. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to experiment with pumpkin ales.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,jayhawk73,3.84,"Pours a nice amber/orange color w/ a really nice two finger cocoa head. Really nice carbonation, and and decent lacing. Really nice looking Pumpkin ale. Smell is a little disappointing to me. It's got all the typical stuff, pumpkin, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg... but it's just really on the weak side for me. I'd like a stronger more present nose in line w/ the style for a higher score. Ok... Fortunately, the taste doesn't follow the nose. It's full of flavor, and the spices explode in your mouth giving a great taste. Good, but not my favorite in the style. Feel is nice and malty, w/ a tiny bit of alcohol making itself known. Very full bodied, and a great malt backbone. Overall, this is a really nice Pumpkin ale, but I don't think it quite makes it up to my favorite for the style. Still, it's worth picking up if your in the mood for the style.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,OtherShoe2,4.2,"Pours tawny orange with a cream-colored head. Some lacing.  Light pie spice and actual pumpkin/gourd aromas, but these are behind some toasted malt.  Finally, a pumpkin brew that doesn't taste like a slice of pie in a blender. Subdued sugars and malt forward, with hints of pumpkin ""fruit"" and light spices, particularly nutmeg. The added flavors are there to enhance the beer, and take a back seat to a very decent malt beverage. They call it a brown, but it is really just toasty. Fruit and sugar aside, you also have nice toasted malt and a wave of light bitterness that cuts thru all flavors and finishes incredibly smooth. Alcohol is well hidden.  Fuller bodied; nice carbonation. A little tingle.  This is the beer I've avoided for years because of the number of bad pumpkin brews I've suffered. Well, I was wrong. This is the one of the style that I will return to now that I know. What a great autumn beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,Jinholic,4.2,"Appearance - Solid copper/burnt orange body, lots of carbonation visible. One finger of off-white head didn't stay full all the way through though.  Smell - Spices just smashing into my nose up front, with lots nutmeg and pumpkin following right behind it.  Taste - Such a rush of spices and brown sugar with real pumpkin flavor all blended in together. The middle of the pallet is has an awesome sweetness to it but it still finishes like a real beer with a smooth hop landing.  Mouthfeel - Smooth as can be the spices don't destroy the inside of your mouth and its not over carbonated. Medium body with a great finish that leaves you wanting more. At 7% abv this is a very drinker friendly beer as most shy away after things get over 6.  Overall - I have yet to be let down by Dogfish Head and they delivered once again. Here's hoping I can stock up on enough of this to pair it with some pumpkin pie in a month. That said go grab one and see for yourself.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,danielespen,4.1,"A- Light copper color, very brown ale-ish in color. Poured into a Shipyard pint glass. Head about 1-1.5 fingers, disappeared after about 1 min or slightly less. Slight lacing on the glass as well.  S- Not as 'pumpkin' as I thought, which is awesome. I'm not too much a fan of flavored beers and the fact that it's not overflowing with pumpkin smell, IMO, is good. Can definitely smell the background allspice and cinnamon though. Again, not overpowering, but there.  T- Unbelieveable. I've been looking for a pumpkin beer to call my own and I knew Dogfish wouldn't let me down. Slight malt, not typical in some browns. Pumpkin flavor that is just there. Not overpowering, not right up front, but a slight taste. Exactly how it smells. Let it sit on the tongue for a few seconds and immediately wanted more. Cinnamon and allspice are right on. Compliment the malts and pumpkin quite nicely. Hardly any hop taste, quite pleasant session beer.  M- Thin, but not too much. Not heavy like some browns I've had. Easily chug this beer!  O- Very nice session beer, well put together and made. Couldn't expect any better from Dogfish Head. I've finally found a Pumpkin beer worth buying. Cheers!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,uawildcat,3.73,"A - Poured from the bottle into an English pub glass. The copper color is nice, but the bubbles forming are soda-like in the glass and the head quickly is gone within a minute of pouring. Lame.  S - Smell more than makes up for the appearance. It is heavenly smelling. I can really smell the allspice and the brown sugar. Amazing. If you have a stuffy nose wait to have this beer; I think the flavor is influenced strongly by the smell. Compared to other pumpkin beers though it isn't as strong and could use a bit more.  T - A hefty brown sugar sweetness upfront. The spices really balance it out. No real hop character to speak of, but that doesn't really belong in a beer like this. Tastes pretty good, but there is too much alcohol without enough to balance it out. Could use a bit more spice or pumpkin flavor.  M - Burning from alcohol isn't something that I want from a beer of this style. It isn't overly carbonated though, which I was worried about from the appearance.  O - This beer is the defacto standard now for pumpkin beers in my mind. It isn't really like a pumpkin pie, so don't try comparing this to a Souther Tier Pumpking or Shipyard Smashed Pumpkin.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

The smell is so potent, but one of those rare good potent smells; lots of pumpkin and lots of nutmeg. The taste is just out of this world. This beer tastes like pumpkin picking, but to make notes, lots of pumpkin taste and lots of nutmeg. The mouthfeel is bright, light, and refreshing with a good amount of carbonation.

The spices also make their presence felt upfront, with the pumpkin/pumpkin pie taste in the finish. Surprisingly easy to drink and easy on the palate. The ABV is also masked well.

S: Spices of nutmeg and coriander dominate the nose. Some cinnamon notes are present as well along with the distinct aroma of pumpkin meat.  T: Some sweetness and bite hit the tip of the tongue at the onset of the sip. Sweetness of pumpkin meat and brown sugar and bite of spices such as cinnamon and nutmeg begin the sip and mellow to maltiness and pumpkin in the middle. The spice returns for the finish accompanied by some slight hop presence.  M: This is a light to medium bodied beer with good carbonation.  Overall, this is a good pumpkin ale. The flavors are well balanced. There are other pumpkin ales with a much stronger flavor profile, but many are not as balanced as this beer. It is not spice heavy nor pumpkin heavy.

The mouth is full of baking spices along with yeasty esters, the pumpkin is a bit more noticeable but so is the alcohol leaving a drying, astrigent feeling in my mouth.

It's very spicy, almost peppery, bringing to mind the Sorachi hop (which, to the best of my knowledge, has nothing to do with this beer). Lots of distinct clove and nutmeg. The real pumpkin meat comes through as well; it has the distinct gamey, almost prune-like taste of unsweetened pumpkin.

The fall spices aren't overpowering but quite strong nonetheless. The pumpkin flavor itself isn't really strong and don't hold up well to the cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice.

10099,6260,billab914,4,"12oz bottle into my Sam Adams glass. It poured a deep amber/copper color with a thin white head barely covering the top of the beer.  I get a good amount of pumpkin pie spice to the aroma. Clove, nutmeg and cinnamon all come out in it. Some sweeter, caramel, bready malts mix nicely with the spices. It's a nice mix, the spices aren't overpowering in it which I really appreciate.  The taste shows the pumpkin pie, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove flavors to it as well. The malty, bready, base of the beer helps keep the spices in check. Like the aroma, the flavors are pretty well integrated overall and the spices aren't overpowering.  The mouthfeel is a little heavier then average, but pretty normal for the style and size of the beer. Carbonation is moderate. Overall it's definitely one of the better pumpkin beers of the season. I'd probably put it in the lower end of my top 5 favorite pumpkins. Very solid beer of the style all around and one we buy every year.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

All the spices are present in the taste; allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon. The pumpkin however are seems to be more faint than I remember in the past. It's there and noticeable but the spices definitely dominate. The brown sugar is also noticeable in the finish as the beer warms. Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp, though a little thin.  A nice seasonal from DFH, but this years (2011) just didn't bring the same intense flavors that I remember the last two years.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,deepchills,3.46,"12. 0z bottle of Punkin Ale had a nice full amber color when poured into a tulip glass.  A finger of head dissipated after a minute or so. Little to no lacing throughout tasting.  The nose is very light, but cinnamon and brown sugar are present, and maybe some orange peel.You might need to be a bloodhound to smell it, but it very nice once you find it.  Great mouthfeel. Very drinkable.  Oddly bitter start, not enough pumpkin flavor to join the spices and brown sugar which are great. Too much alcohol burn in the finish, much more than one would like. I’m drinking straight out of the fridge, so the beer might be too cold. So I let it sit for 20 minutes before retasting. The bitter start is still there, maybe even a little sour now. The alcohol burn in the finish has subsided. More pumpkin can also be tasted.  Not what I had hoped for after all the hype. Dogfish Head remain my favorite brewery, but this tasting didn’t go over too well for them.  I still have 2 more of these babies in the fridge, next time I’ll start much closer to room temperature as this ale got better the warmer it got.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Tastes like of the spices mentioned in the smell with just a hint of bitterness in the finish. It is unique and tasty.  This beer has a lighter (than usual DFH) body and a medium level of carbonation. It is really easy to drink, if not a bit thin. That said, the alcohol is well hidden.

Smell - Perhaps it's my allergies, but I don't smell much here. Faint spices and sweetness.  Taste - This is how I remember the beer tasting from last year. I've been a bit disappointed with the bottled version so far this year. The tap brings out much more of the fresh pumpkin I've been waiting four. Sweet brown sugar and other spices accompany the gourd.  Mouthfeel / Drinkability - I definitely prefer the tap version of this beer over the bottled one. It has a lot more of the fresh pumpkin taste I've been longing for. There is also a delicious mixture of spice throughout which stands out more in the tap-version.

It smells a little grainy with a light hint of malts.  T- More pumpkin, nutmeg, and cinnamon. I get some caramel malts and a doughy-ness in there as well.  M- I don't have a lot to compare it to, but the mouthfeel is on the lighter side with a good amount of carbonation. Goes down really easily with only a slight bite from the 7% abv.

Pours a clear amber with a perfect 1 1/2 fingers of head (but I have fat fingers, so it would be 2 for most of you). The head doesn't have a whole lot of retention at all. definite undertones of orangey-amber from the pumpkins.  Smells reminescent of a belgian dubbel or tripel. smells of corriander. The smell is also reminescent of the spicy smell of Sah'tea (minus the floral banana aroma). Pumpkins don't come out and bite you but their sweetness comes through in balance.  The middle says good bye to anything belgian but strongly shares the spice profile of Sah'tea but with more cinnamon. The overall taste is sweet. Notes of nutmeg as well. Slight hop character, which works to bring out the spices, hops in gret balance for the style. Incredible drinkability. Don't forget the bread notes.  The finish is spicy goodness. Nutmeg is most utilized here. slightly dry but still predominantly sweet. The nutmeg is immediate as the beer slides down but the very back end leaves a punkin sweetness.

Smell is typical pumpkin ale - pumpkin pie spice with a nice sweetness. Taste doesn't quite follow up on the sweetness side, but spice is definitely still there. I prefer a pumpkin pie-y flavor to my pumpkin ale, so while this is very good, the lower sweetness doesn't make it as good as a Weyerbacher or Schlafly.  Mouthfeel is also kinda thin compared to others and for a fall/winter beer such as a pumpkin ale, i'd prefer a bit more body.

Nose is inviting with a ton of baking spice up front. A hint of spiced pumpkin pie is there. Some caramel and roasted fig from the malts. The palate confirms but is dominated by the spice and pumpkin pie character. Very good nose and palate but pretty simple.  Texture is lovely. Nice thick, brown sugary mass with incredible balance. Tasting next to the other 5 pumpkin ales this seems so intense and rich without being too heavy.  Overall this was tied with the Elysian for best pumpkin ale among our group (Elysian had better nose and flavor but fell short of the texture and finish of this one). It's really quite a lovely beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

The nose shows nutmeg, brown sugar, orange flesh, and cinnamon. There is also some type of fruitiness, but I don’t think that without the influence of the name, I would distinguish it as pumpkin. The pumpkin flavor definitely does not disappoint, along with the cinnamon and nutmeg flavors. The beer is sweet, but not as sweet as the brown sugar on the nose would have suggested.

However, this ale poured out as a nice looking copper color with a fizzy white head on top. The smell of the beer has a pretty good spicy aroma to it with some malt in there too. The taste of the beer is pretty impressive compared to a lot of other pumpkin ales out there. The taste of pumpkin and spice really blend nicely together.

Taste - Mmmm. I favor this one better than the 2010 batch, very surprising. this is a very well put together beer. It follows the nose really well. I get the cinnamon and nutmeg up front, followed by sweet molasses and oh yeah pumpkin.  Mouthfeel - Aging this one hasn't put a damper on the carbonation. its still very present and very good.  Overall - the flavors play together really well. I have great respect for Sam and his work over at Dogfish Head.

10099,6260,HimerMan,4.16,"Initial Review: (look: 3.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 2 | feel: 2 | overall: 2) on 5/14/2006.  12oz bottle, rated after the Post Road Pumpkin Ale.  The smell overwhelms here, nutmeg and inerds of pumpkins. Way too intense flavor and alcohol here for me to enjoy.  Again, I am not a huge fan of pumpkins - but I do like the stlye of beer, as its flavor is nutmeg, cinnamon, and brown sugar. So, I defintely love trying these.  Pour and color are nice, deep orange color (ironic) and deepened with its nutmeg.  I would suggest trying to split the pack with someone, or get a single if possible. This is a bit hard to have, but worth a shot.  Pumpkin lovers should really love this one, as it is not heavy on the other flavors that come with pumpkin ales.  Cheers.  --- Bottle from 2003 I had stored away, and finally opened in June 2011.  To my surprise, the beer popped and released that beer ""spirit"" from ~7 years ago, and didn't gush out. Good so far.  Poured clear and it had a decent off-white/lightly tan head that quietly dissipated. Color on the beer is great, really ideally orange-ish light brown with reddish highlights. This is certainly a great color to shoot for as a homebrewer too.  Incredible smell! This was really unexpected after so many years. Huge pumpkin aroma with a subtle mix of spices in the background. No off musty, damp, cardboard flavors at all.  The taste was simpler than I remember it, nice pumpkin and balance with its pie-filling spice counterpart. A bit on the sweet side, but definitely fitting for its style. Nice aftertaste, and good balance throughout the bottle. (Not really much sediment at all.)  I remember having this fresh and thinking it tasted like innards of a pumpkin, which was too much pumpkin flavor for me - even in a pumpkin ale. However, after years of mellowing in the cellar - some of the cinnamon, nutmeg and brown sugar-like spices came out and blended harmoniously with the pumpkin.  All in, I have to say - this was an unexpected gem that I probably shouldn't have opened so late. I will probably buy some and try to forget about them again for another 5+ years, just to see what happens.  Cheers.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Funny that the label says it's a brown ale, as there's not much brown about it, IMO.  Smells like sweet malts and spices. There's a baseline sweetness that's ever-present in the smell, as well as some cinnamon and citrusy spice. Pumpkin aroma is very faint at first, but comes out much more as the beer warms up.  Taste has a light caramel malt base, with some spice and pumpkin built on top of that. Just a tiny hint of hops. Pumpkin once again is faint at low temps, but is much more prominent as the beer warms up. It's actually quite tasty - a nice variety of slightly sweet, slightly rich, slightly spiced flavors.  Body is medium-light with slight below-average carbonation. Nothing special, but decent.  When I first tasted this, it was rather cold, and I was disappointed in the lack of pumpkin.

10099,6260,BuxMontBeerLover,4.2,"Received a 4/pk for Christmas. Just finishing the last bottle in February 2011. Just a side note: Bottle was an oddity...it was featured on ""Brewmasters"" about the Punkin Ale being bottled in the wrong type of bottle. I somehow got a ""screw-off"" type bottle instead of the normal crown bottle.  Enjoyed in a DFH Signature Glass.  A - Pours with a one to one and a half finger cream colored, foamy head. This lasts for quite a while and ends up with a thin film on top of the beer. Beer is a deep amber color, slighty opaque. Leaves a copius amount of lacing on the side of the glass during the drinking session.  S - Great smell of spices, like nutmeg and cinnamon. Smells like a dessert.  T - A nicely flavored beer where the nutmeg, cinnamon and all spice are the dominate flavors. A nice caramaly sweetness rounds out this really tasty beer. The alcohol is there but decently disguised behind the various flavors.  M - Nice bite from the carbonation. A slighty bitter aftertaste is evident after each sip but it never takes away from the overall spicy taste.  D - This is a very tasty brew. I've enjoyed this many times from the bottle and I've also enjoyed this on tap after the Dogfish Dash in 2010. I loved it then and it's just as good from the bottle. Very easy to drink several of these. They go down quite nicely.  Overall: Great seasonal beer. Another hit from DFH!  Cheers!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,BeardedRiker,3.95,"It's that time of year where anything pumpkin is mandatory and Dogfish Head has their Punkin' Ale as the answer. First off, I much prefer this pumpkin ale over other pumpkin ales I've had.  I got a moderate head on it that went away quickly. A bubbly film stays at the surface for quite awhile. Color is a clear orange-brown, sort of like a pumpkin or fall colors.  I can smell the brown sugar with the allspice, cinnamon and nutmeg giving it more complexity.  The taste is a little disappointing in my opinion. Yes, I can taste the ingredients used but I expected it to be a bit more full-bodied. That's probably just my bias toward full-bodied beers talking but that's my preference. Even though the ABV is only 7%, you can still taste the alcohol well. It's still a good beer though.

It has a very sharp flavor profile when fresh. It has some nice pumpkin and spice flavors and a slightly sweet and spicy finish. M: decent mouthfeel, it isn't thin or heavy and the carbonation is good. D: fresh it's a little hard to drink more than one, but after aging a few months it's very easy to take care of two of them.

T: The pumpkin flavor is not overpowering, nor are the spices, leaving room for the light malt flavor to come out. There is less sweetness to this than I expected though caramel and candied sugar flavors are still detectable.  M: Light in body, good carbonation and very round flavors.  D: Not my favorite pumpkin beer, it needed a little more thickness to it and a heavier pumpkin flavor and a little less spice. Still a very drinkable beer though.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

S: I was able to detect different kinds if spices such as all spice, cinnamon, and nutmeg but did sniff out some pumpkin pie character alongside sweet bready malts.  T: The pumpkin flavor is a little bit more apparent on the palate but had cinnamon, nutmeg, all spice accents with caramel notes and a touch of toffee.  M: the brew was light to medium in body with a moderate amount of carbonation which had a sweet, spice, and very mild bitter finish.  D: gotta say it was a solid pumpkin and is probably one of my top five as far as the style goes. It was tasty and drank good.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,CuriousMonk,3.65,"A beer that the quality has declined noticably over the years. I still prefer the tap over 12 oz bottle which is usually poured in a pint glass. Pours an orange-copper with a light ring of foam. Sugary aroma with light spice. Alcohol is very present in the taste, with ginger, nutmeg, and cinnamon in the background. Wow! Thin carbonation, decent body. What an interesting approach to pumpkin beer - high alcohol really surprises. Great spice, but where's the pumpkin?",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,wilkowski,4.87,"Poured a 12oz bottle into a Dogfish Head Snifter straight down the middle. I've had this particular bottle in my beer fridge for three months.  A: Bright ruby orange body. Minimal head. The glass is creating an active bubbling up the center.  S: Raw pumpkin. Allspice. Nutmeg. More pumpkin. Smells like an extremely fresh pumpkin pie in your glass. As good as advertised.  T: The spices dominate the taste. Allspice, cinnamon, brown ale malt, brown sugar. No pumpkin flavor on the palate.  M: Crisp and sharp carbonation when cold. Mouthfeel gets significantly smoother and richer as the beer warms. Good balance throughout.  D: Wonderful and warming. Slightly better with age, but after 3 months or 12 months it essentially drinks the same as it does in season. It doesn't age like some of Dogfish's bigger beers. One is good but two are better.

It has a nice roasted pumpkin and brown sugar scent. It tastes incredible, with the brown sugar and all spice being more relevant than an overwelming pumpkin flavor. I can taste the cinnamon and nutmeg as well, but it's not overbearing. It is a very smooth and drinkable beer, with the alcohol being hard to detect, which is preferential in a beer like this.

Pours pure gold, with a medium head. Smells of spicy malts, with a slight ester smell.  Tastes of bold, full pumpkin spice. I like this one very much for its clarity of taste. Many other pumpkin beers are a muddly, spicy mess, but DFH found a way to impart very clear flavors. The taste is rounded out with cinnamon and nutmeg, set atop a very well balanced malt/hop profile.

T - Very close to the nose. Pumpkin is quality, no artificial or ""tinny"" flavors. Cinnamon is more prominent this year then in previous batches.

None of the tastes or spices are dominant, they all mingle so nicely. I taste pumpkin, a little cinnamon, and the holiday spices, followed by some hop bitterness. Really balanced and smooth  Mouthfeel: On the fuller side. Slick and oily, coats the mouth with flavor. Carbonation is spot on.  Drinkability: I have not found a pumpkin beer I liked until this one.

Smell: The label advertises plenty of spice and this beer doesn't fall short. All the spices on the label are accounted for and they produce wonderful aromas. Yeast and malts can also be detected in the nose.  Taste: In short, this beer does taste like pumpkin pie. That's to say that the spices and pumpkin come through on the tongue.

Light caramel malts up front with a good dose of the pumpkin, a bit of cinnamon, and a little clove. There is a tad of hoppiness to this brew but its really toned down.

I am a fan of the style, so I had to make sure I knew when I saw a good one or when I saw a fake.  I probably had 50 different pumpkin ales this year, and this one was the best one.  Terrapin, brooklyn, buffolo bills came close, but they all had somethin that was missing in the clove flavor, that this beer absolutely delivers.  It does not go for the ""pumpkin pie in your mouth"" angle that williamsburg or southern tier does, This is a great decision for the drinkability of this beer. It is one of the very few that can be drank like a session beer without giving you a sugar shock.  Great use of cloves, allspice and home made ""dragon scales"" as they would say at the brewery.

Dominant scents of pumpkin, breadiness, cinnamon, and nutmeg. I may be detecting some cloves, even though it's not listed as an ingredient. This may be a mental insertion of a familiar scent associated with these others.  Tastes of malt sweetness that is almost cloying, overwhelming. The alcohol presence is disappointingly detectable, too. Aftertaste is pleasant, a faint pumpkin breadiness laced with hints of cinnamon and nutmeg. If the aftertaste were the taste, this would be a much more satisfying ale.  The mouthfeel is overwhelmingly smooth with modest to low carbonation. Features a pleasant, dry finish.  I recall in years prior enjoying this beer much more than the present. Perhaps they've changed the recipe, it's difficult to say. The taste isn't as enjoyable as it once was; I don't understand the sweetness factor present now.

The mouthfeel is slightly creamy and nicely carbonated.  This is an awesome beer that screams fall.

All the spices and pumpkin from the nose are picked up on the palate in addition to brown sugar and pepper which makes the beer tingle on the tongue. Strong roasted malt flavor amongst all the spices along with a little booze which is surprising. Not too sweet and not too boring.  M: Smooth creamy texture wih lively carbonation and a medium body.

Evident festive pumpkin, fine blend of cinnamon and nutmeg without being overwhelming. Peppy, bright and pleasing - synergistic. Some actual hops peek through - unusual for the style. Starch from the pumpkin wraps into what may be a base Red ale, there's some pie crust and just a hint of vegetal gourd.  T. A lot drier than I expected, the spice and Punkin' are in full force here. A little booze, a starchy, highly (but not overly) spiced brew full of Autumn cheer. Reminds me of an Imperial Wit for some reason... no coriander here, but something about this... I dunno. It's pretty good. No flabby flavor here, this lays it all out. Falls somewhere between Weyerbacher Imperial Pumpkin and your local generic 5.5% pumpkin brew.  M / D. Not much I'd change here, medium body, mid-full carbonation that knows when to back off. Finish is starchy and allspice with a little hop bitterness on the back-end.

The beige head rises to about two fingers in stature, but doesn't stick around all that long, nor does it leave much evidence of its former existence. Nose is pretty much what one would expect from a well made pumpkin ale. Pumpkin comes through, along with an intriguing blend of spices (cinnamon and nutmeg come through better than the allspice). Brown sugar was advertised on the bottle, and while it didn't show up in the aroma it comes through just fine on the front end of each sip. That and an improved allspice presence among the pumpkin and spices on the back end really take this beer to the next level. Carbonation is fine, middle of the road in terms of intensity. Punkin could stand to be a little bit more rich though, the body comes across as a little thin for a decent sized pumpkin ale.

10099,6260,FeDUBBELFIST,4.03,"I sampled Punkin first at the brewpub, but this review is from a bottle. Batch 10F from 2010. $12 for a 4 pack. Served in a wine glass.  A: Pours with an average head of 1 1/2 fingers, off-white in color, fizzy and rapidly diminishing. The body is light amber orange in color and is ridiculously clear. No lacing to speak of.  S: Toasted (if not mildly roasted) malts of cereal, caramel and bread, reminiscent of the smell of the crust of wheat bread. Hops are light, piney and resiny. Light earthy leafy yeast.  T: Dogfish Head exercises restraint with their use of spices. Sure, there are the expected notes of allspice, nutmeg and cinammon, but in Punkin, the spices come off as delicately incorporated instead of the main flavor component. The pumpkin flavor seems natural and fleshy instead of artifical. Freshness is immediately apparent. Suggestions of brown sugar make their way to the palate as well as a very light smokiness plus a light boozines on the very back end.  M: Light to medium body with a fizzy effervescence albeit slightly undercarbonated in my opinion.  D: This brew performed much better on draft than it did in the bottle. The mouthfeel in the draft version was perfect. On tap, the pumpkin and spice flavors were also more subdued, which is my preference for this style and, in my opinion, helps to increase this brew's drinkability.

Not a lot of sweetness going on. Just not really digging this one a whole lot in the flavor department.  Quite thick with very creamy carbonation. Really nice almost chewy feel.  I'm struggling to put down a whole one of these. It really tastes more like a winter warmer to me. Not as pumpkin ale like as I was thinking it was going to be. I will not be having this one again anytime soon. There are several other better pumpkin beers than this one.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,ramseye4,3.97,"Poured into a Brooklyn Brewery pint glass. I have three of these left for thanksgiving, might as well review one now though. Pours a copper/burnt orange color, semitransparent. Surprisingly large head with outstanding lacing. Smells of nutmeg, clove, cinnamon, smells like a bakery. Massive amounts of cinnamon come to the forefront of the palate, with nutmeg and other, more subtle spices coming to prominence halfway through the taste, and the alcohol pokes its head through during the finish in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is decent, the finish is a bit rough, but it is full bodied and filling.

The head remains for some time and leaves clear lines of retention. The beer effervesces continuously helping to maintain the head. The smell is predominantly cinnamon and nutmeg with a slight hint of pumpkin and rye. Taste is all about lightly sweetened pumpkin pie. The dominant flavors are nutmeg and cinnamon, but the focus on those spices helps make this beer quite drinkable. The beer seems to be a little light on the body. This beer to coat the tongue a little more considering it's a fall/winter beer.

Sugary pumpkin, spice, a bit of roasted malt and caramel in the nose. Alcohol as it warms. Notes of something odd I can't pinpoint..smells a little odd.  The pumpkin and spices listed on the label are there and good, along with some floral and grapefruit hops, but not much to it other than that. Slight bready notes. Sweet but not quite cloying. Boozy on the finish.  Decent mouthfeel but it is boozy, tastes sorta artificial/cough syrupy for some reason.

Bottled in 2010 3C printed on the bottle - no clue what that means as far as dates, but should be fresh.  A- pour is cloudy, light copper. decent head.  S- nutmeg, nutmeg, nutmeg and a few other spices.  T- slightly sweet, muted hops. Nutmeg all the way through, with hints of its supporting cast (cinnamon, allspice?). Really not much pumpkin to this at all. The spices are smooth throughout though - lacks the kick you might expect. Slightly warming.  M- slick, but a touch chewy. Not dry per-se, but something with the nutmeg makes it feel that way.  D- Not bad, but not great. Honestly wouldn't want more than 12oz of this.  Overall an interesting beer, but not really what I'd hoped for, and not up to par with Dogfish's other offerings. In the past, this was an in your face nutmeg bomb, but it's now evolved into a more balanced nutmeg beer.

I think my wife and I (with the help of many friends) went through about two cases of this stuff last year. Oddly enough, this is the first time I've tried this all season.  A: Brilliant, cloudy and peppery orange color, with about an inch worth of head and nice bubbly carbonation.  S: Smells like [you guessed it]: pumpkin pie. Actually, the spices are very well tempered here and it avoids the pitfalls of so many in that it's not a cinnamon-nutmeg bomb. The gourd comes through the longer I sit, wait for it to warm a bit, and whiff.  T: This is first and foremost a brown ale, and as such, the brown sugar hits the palate first, followed by the usual gang of pumpkin spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. All of these complement the pumpkin quite nicely.  M: Not boozy in any way, the brown sugar is surprisingly tempered well by the gourd, and the carbonation plays a nice role in balancing out the ensemble. Not bitter in any way.  D: I've read the posts that say that the Punkin' Ale this year is not as good as the one last year, better than the one last year, blah, blah, blah, blah... Whatever...

I also smell a bit of cinnamon and other pumpkin pie spices. Though there are a few different aromas. It smells sweet.  It tastes of pumpkin (no shit). There is a brown sugary taste that is fairly strong, a mild pumpkin flavor and a bit of a harsh cinnamon flavor. There is actually a tad bit of bitterness in this beer though it is not hop bitterness: it is slightly bitter because of the spices. The beer is not as sweet as I thought it was going to be because of the smell. There is a nice balance to the beer.

Gave it a second chance soon after, and still thought it was without any redeeming qualities. Then about 4 weeks ago, I found myself at a growler station sampling it and thinking that it was much improved, or at least better way than I remember (my palette likely primed by now).  Last night, I finally had a chance to sit down and crack open the growler and was quite satisfied by this ale. It, of course, poured with abundant head - cottony, fluffy. leaving strands of lacing. Yellowish amber hue and clean. Wonderful balance in aroma and flavor. Spices are present, thankfully not in a pumpkin pie bouquet, but they merely lend touches to what is actually a lovely pumpkin/malt blend. The pumpkin (and some faint nuttiness) steps forward in the taste, while the malt and spices seem to lead the scent. What I really appreciate and enjoy here is that the pumpkin is featured quite well, not pushed down or muted by a loud lousy concoction of pie flavorings, as many of these ales are. The pumpkin comes across a little roasty as well. The beer drinks medium-bodied, clean, and somewhat dry.

You do get a little hops in the aftertaste that don't come through in the nose, but other that that, the taste follows smell.  D: Nice and drinkable. Its crisp and pretty low carbonated, but that's good for this style, it leaves a little coating in the mouth.  Overall: If you like pumpkin, you'll like this; end of story. A lot of people think they like pumpkin, but actually like all the spices that pumpkin dishes are prepared with. Remember, pumpkin is a gourd; a vegetable, not a sugary cinnamon pie.

Really not a Pumpkin Pie scent  Taste- Nutmeg dominates after a little caramel tease. Pumpkin shows up in the aftertaste and in that context comes off more as underbaked unsweetened pumpkin than pumpkin pie. I happen to like nutmeg a lot but here I don't think it works,the choice of a German tasting yeast and a rather blunt wooden German type hops killed off the subtle sweet touch of the Nutmeg and amplified it's bitter side. I guess the idea was to merge pumpkin and malts,and merge the nutmeg and hops,but the whole never seemed at all in balance. I don't know if ""cloying"" can apply when there's hardly any sweetness but I had just 2/3 of the bottle and even so that last gulp was a bit forced  Mouthfeel- Body,texture,carbo,no problem. Aftertaste....unsweet pumpkin,some yeast that hit my belly like a brick,and a harsh underbuffered,overdone nutmeg blast accented by a hops that brought out the wrong things...just not for me.

This beer pours a clear medium amber hue, with one finger of soapy pale beige head, which produces a slouching ring of lace around the glass as it falls away. It smells of cinnamon, demarara sugar, ginger, leafy hops, and a bit of alcohol. The taste is spicy caramel malt, cinnamon, clove, and ginger (natch) most prevalent, tempered quite well, if not overly so, by the earthy, boozy, herbal hops.

Poured into my snifter (I'm still really hesitant to pull out my Pilsner glass...is it time yet?), it holds a wonderful polished cherry wood color in the depths with orange accents swirling around the outside. There was a small head of off-white foam, about a finger thick, that quickly dissolved to a bubbly ring with islands in the middle. I was hardly disappointed as the little foam that lingered didn't vanish, but stuck around through the whole drink, keeping it together just right.  The aroma permeated the air around the glass almost immediately. The Punkin left a seductive trail of fresh-from-the-oven pumpkin pie, banana bread, and cinnamon toast that I continually wafted over myself in ecstasy. Closing my eyes, I imagined myself in a warm, inviting kitchen baking scrumptious desserts in preparation for a family Thanksgiving. Slinking among the amazing eruption of baked goods, I found some caramel malt, allspice, and a dash of spicy nutmeg.  To continue with the perfection of this favorite brown ale, the taste was the complete embodiment of the nose, only with the liquid sustenance. It was lightly spicy right off the bat, keeping my tongue tingling with happiness while cinnamon, pumpkin pie, and a generous amount of caramel washed over it. All of this was accompanied by nutmeg, brown sugar and allspice - all of which are extremely complimenting of each other; no one flavor tries to dominate the others. The mouthfeel was smooth with a medium body, like a heavy silk, and everything is supported by just the right amount of carbonation. It ends slightly dry with very little bitterness, and pulls everything together with a comforting warmth from the 7% ABV...which gives it an A+ in my book.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

The smell has some great malt presence mixing well with the nutmeg. The flavor is a nice blend of nutmeg, cinnamon, and all spice. The bottle says it is brewed with brown sugar, so I expected some sweetness, but no sweetness comes through. This one has a medium mouthfeel, but has a hearty feel to it. This one is a great drinker as far as pumpkin ales are concerned, the flavors come together nicely, and do not overpower.

10099,6260,BranfordBound,4.08,"12 oz brown bottle into a SA Perfect Pint. It's cold outside and the leaves are falling... time for the pumpkin beers.  Punkin Ale pours a transparent amber/orange color. A dense off-white head forms and falls, leaving a mild covering. Hints of carbonation. Doesn't leave too much lacing.  Smells like a malty ale, but after awhile the spices penetrate the nose and you can detect the cinnamon and nutmeg.  Strong spices in the beginning and middle. The cinnamon works nicely with the malt to have that wonderful cinnamon and sugar flavor at the front end, then the more aggressive spices take over at the middle to finish out the pumpkin pie flavor. End with an aftertaste of mild and creamy pumpkin, usually more apparent when warm.  Carbonation adds to the element of spice, and it finishes a little wet.

Scent is spicy with cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom. A bit sweet as well, but not able to pick up the pumpkin in the nose.  All the ingredients listed on the bottle are detected in varying levels of flavor: heavy on the cinnamon, allspice & nutmeg. Pumpkin is present but understated, as well as the brown sugar. Spices are at the forefront, and blend with a generous dose of hops to create a dry, snappy finish.  Medium body, which makes it more of a beer which can be drunken a few at a time, rather than a heavy-bodied sipper as with other pumpkin beers. Clean, with a nice hop bite. Still, it's a bit overbalanced toward the spices rather than the sweet malt or actual pumpkin.

S - Bottle mentions cinnamon, allspice and nutmeg as spice additions; all come through in the aroma without overpowering the bready malt. No yeast or hop aromas.  T - Spices are muted at first, but become more prominent as the beer warms. I would prefer a little less spice; the nutmeg really overtakes the taste near the end of the glass. I can taste the pumpkin, which doesn't happen all the time in pumpkin beers. Mild bready, biscuit malt flavor. Clean yeast flavor. Mild hop bitterness with a mild floral hop flavor.  M - Moderate carbonation and medium bodied. Finish is a little dry; I'd think a sweeter finish would help this beer taste a little more like pumpkin pie. Alcohol warmth is evident half way through the glass.  D - Good, but not great. I'd like a touch less spice, a little sweeter finish, and a little more malt flavor.

M: Medium viscosity with prickly carbonation that seems to interfere with the depth of flavors present.

The flavor is amazing, especially for this style. The allspice just kicks you flat in your face, and fills in with the bready pumpkin flavor. Allspice plus.

Not a lot of pumpkin on my palate. I was glad for that, not being a big pumpkin guy, but this came highly recommended. Didn't pick up cinnamon on taste just the smell.  Mouth- Very nice beer indeed. Not overly sweet either. Wasn't very heavy either considering it was a pumpkin beer. Nice crispness as well. Not a lot of malt to it.  Drink- It's a very rainy day in So.

10099,6260,dcook11,4,"Ive had all four beers in the pack before reviewing. Three have been in a pint glass and one was reviewed in a snifter to focus more on the beer's smell. The beer I am currently reviweing has been out of the fridge for about twenty minutes and should be at the 55 egree mark.  A- The beer pours a moderate orange color and a two finger white head that fades quickly. There is some lacing on the glass rim and the carbonation level appears to be fairly low as I dont see any bubbles.  S- This is a very malt forward beer so a sweet malt is the first scent to hit the nose. The next few scents are quick and hard to detect. It goes something like this...allspice, cinnamon, and a very light hint of pumpkin at the termination. It took me a long time to decern these flavore in the beer, and for a pumpkin ale one struggles to get even a faint scent of pumpkin.  T- Once again very malt forward so sweet malt is the first discernable flavor. Next is allspice with a slight hint of pumpkin and bitterness on the finish. I am surprised at how the taste veries from bottle to bottle. Some bottles I got cinnimon, pumpkin, allspice, and hops in the taste where as in others all i tasted was sweet malt and alcohol. My first impressions of this beer were that the alcohol was not well masked. Let the beer warm up over an hour. I kid you not, it brings out the allusive pumpkin. Also, give a snifter a try.  M- The alcohol is not well masked so even with the low ibu's the mouthfeel is still somewhat abrasive. It has a semi-pleasent mouthfeel but I think lowering the abv some and giving us a full sixer would be best. At times the finish comes off as a tad too bitter for the style.  D- The drinkability is decent but probably not something I would want to drink more than a few of. There is just not enough of the ingredients DFH porports having in this beer. It's lack of complexity and poorly masked alcohol prevent me from rating drinkability higher.  This is a decent, if somewhat uncomplex beer. It does not represent the style well and I detected much more pumpkin in buffalo bills pumpkin ale then in DFH and for their price discrepancies that is saying something. Give me a six pack DFH, not this four pack BS. As far as I am concerned I paid 11 bucks for a name not for four beers.  M-",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

S - This is the first pumpkin beer which has a dominant pumpkin scent that isn't overpowered by spices. Sweet caramel, brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg all come through on the finish.  T - Must like the scent, the pumpkin comes through nicely and is complemented by the spices, most notably the cinnamon and nutmeg. It has an odd tang to it as well, making for a unique experience. The higher ABV is well hidden.  M - A lighter bodied ale that comes through a little thin on the finish. Could use a bit more carbonation to load up the body a bit.  D - This stuff was really tasty and one of the better examples of a pumpkin ale. I enjoyed that it was a little less on the spicey side and focused on the pumpkin for a change.

A dessert beer perhaps. A tad too much spice overall. A tad bitter in the finish - from the spice load maybe?  M: Thich, chewy, slight heat. A tad tongue-numbing, maybe from clove/allspice?

Many singular carbonation streams rise from all over the place. Thick collar with cirrus cloud formations.  S- This beer has many layers that seperate as the distance widens. The most apparent is the strong aroma of pumpkin and spice friends. This is followed by a slow withdraw to reveal a cinnamon burn. The last layer is a residual nutmeg and something similar to allspice.  T- Much less pumpkin than the nose portrayed. The predominant flavors are now the spices. In terms of alcohol, it exists as a strong base to build off of. Heavy nutmeg on the opening with astringent hues, middle morphing into cinnamon, and the finish is deliciously mild with pumpkin.  M- Full and complex. Exact amount of carbonation that would want from a beer like this. It also has creamy qualities without being too heavy.  D- Beyond easy.

Earthy vegetal aroma with some nutmeg and cinnamon in the background, pretty basic. Sweet chocolate and mild caramel malt.  Doesn't look like a brown but sure tastes like one. Toasty nutty chocolate malt notes at first, some vegetal notes in the middle with some nutmeg and cinnamon, and the spices dominate through the finish.  Medium-full body, smooth velvety texture, light carbonation on the finish.  Enjoyable all around, yet not a memorable example of a pumpkin ale for me.

While the brown sugar is evident, the finish is actually quite dry and smooth. Mellow and extremely drinkable for 7% abv.  If you are aiming for something a bit more heavy than say the Samuel Adams Harvest Ale, this would be the next step up in terms of complexity and alcohol.

My glass might have been dirty, but it seemed to leave more of a formless residue than defined laces.  S- Spice dominates, certainly more so than pumpkin. A slight hint of sweetness from the brown sugar mixes with a noticeable alcohol scent.  T- Being my first pumpkin beer, I was a little unsure of what to expect. Fortunately, I was pleasantly surprised! Delicious, subtle (but not sweet) pumpkin provides most of the body. Certainly doesn't taste like some artificial pumpkin-pie-in-a-bottle, which was both a surprise and a bit of a relief. The sugar and nutmeg are very delicate and give the tip of the tongue a nice bit of attention. Good balance of malt and hops, with a slightly greater malt presence that adds to the beer's robustness.  M- Full and clean, with no harsh bite from the carbonation.  D- Though I didn't really want to drink a ""pumpkin soda,"" I was hoping for a slightly stronger pumpkin taste. Admittedly, now that I think of it, that's probably not a realistic expectation for a beer. That said, this is an excellent ale that I would gladly pick up again.

Spices in the flavor, too -- again, nutmeg up front, but with enough cinnamon & allspice to compete. Yeah...there's some banana bubblegum around, in the aftertaste. A little booze, but not bad.

I wasn't impressed with the first but now, here with a fresh palate, I shall review the second.  Copper with some hints of ruby pours with virtually no head. Lacing is non-existent.  Nose is of pumpkin with a smell that is suggestive of light spices and a bit meaty, oddly enough.  Malts up front but are balanced with hops and spice. Everything plays together nicely with none outdoing the other but a mediocre balanced beer is still mediocre even when balanced. I don't get any cinnamon but more on the spectrum of light allspice and nutmeg. No discernible hop flavor as I would expect from a typical pumpkin, but since there is no strong spice flavor I would want a little more. Definite malts and pumpkin without a whole lot else backing this up...  Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Great for the style.  I have to say that I'm very disappointed with this brew from DFH overall.

10099,6260,dataskatt,4.32,"Now this is a nice pumpkin ale! Nice carbonation. Appearance is that of brewed tea. This is only my 2nd pumpkin ale, so not sure if that is normal or not. Smell is very nice: pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice and brown sugar are all there. Ditto for taste. A very nice, full flavored pumpkin ale, without being too sweet or spicy. Mouthfeel seems perfect, and drinkability is great, despite a 7% ABV. A very nice blend. I would definitely pick up a 4-pack of these!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,heebes,4.49,"Pours a rich semiclear orange amber. Minimal head and a good amount of carbonation.  Smells of pumpkin (!), cinnamon, spices and brown sugar. This beer is loaded with deep aromas appearing as soon as the cap is popped.  The taste runs smooth of a deep representation of the nose. Flavorful rich pumpkin. Theres a great spice aftertaste lingering. Medium mouthfeel present. Thick on the palette but a smooth drinker.  Overall this is the best yet representation of the pumpkin ale. The Dogfish Head crew delivers. Very high drinkability, glad I bought 2 packs. Theres the definite ale taste to it. Not overpowering as some as far as pumpkin pie type spices. Drinks like a true fresh pumpkin beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Bready, toffee, gram cracker. Nice balanced spices. No one spice takes the lead. More beer and pumpkin than spice which is a nice change. Like the whole pie, not just spiced fizz.  T- Nice big ale. Real malty, bready, nice pumpkin character. Well spice, cinnamon lingers into finish. Almost a gingerbread appeal. Fantastic big beer flavor married perfectly with real pumpkin pie.  M- Medium body, nice full mouth of bread and bubbles.  O- I could drink a million of these.  Best pumpkin beer ever. Full and rich, tastes like ale and fall, drinkable but one will do. Doesn't taste like a candle, or like a scented budwater. One more perfect beer from DFH.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,nhindian,3.7,"Taken from notes dated 9/13/2010.  A: Although the label calls this a brown ale, it is actually fairly light. I'd compare it to more of a medium-colored IPA with it's light amber color. Builds a thin 1-fingered head that disappears into pretty much nothing after a few minutes. No lacing to speak of. Crystal clear.  S: Ah, this smells rich in spicy cloves, cinnamon and pumpkin. The spices overwhelm the pumpkin a bit but helps round out the nose. The bouquet on this is fantastic and sticks around potently throughout. Actually getting more spices and alcohol in the nose than pumpkin. Some pumpkin hints after the initial wave of spice, but it is obviously not a straight pumpkin-forward nose.  T: The taste follows the nose on this one! Following the nose, the taste is very much so spice-dominated. I'm getting some nutmeg and cinnamon, then a bit of alcohol, and then a hint of pumpkin. Very warming and for those who are just getting into pumpkin brews, a nice way to ease into the pumpkin flavor. I'd like for it to taste a bit fuller and less hot, but it is still quite tasty. A great combination of autumn flavors that has me looking forward to the change of seasons and Halloween.  M: Mild carbonation, feels light in the mouth. Alcohol warms the mouth.  D: Very high. The excellent mixture between spice and pumpkin helps this one go down easy and makes me almost reach for another bottle immediately. Although I do wish the alcohol hid a bit more behind the richer flavors, for 7% ABV, I could sip this one all day.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

A - light copper, fluffy white head, lots of carbonation  S - Ginger mostly, clove, nutmeg, cinnamon, some brown sugar and alcohol.  T - Tastes like it smells but with some overhanging pumpkin. Thanksgiving spices like in the nose but not well defined.  M - Medium to light body, a little thin and a bunch of carbonation.  D - Easy to drink but I think it could be better with some stronger flavors (more pumpkin!). Smell is the best part.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

10099,6260,Snamnoum,3.75,"Appearance - crystal clear copper orange color, bubbly and effervescent. Pour produced one finger of head which dissipated quickly leaving a thin dusting of froth. Very lager like in appearance.  Smell - allspice, nutmeg, mace, malt, pumpkin, brown sugar, very reminiscent of pumpkin pie.  Taste - big boozy alcohol presence upfront, then pumpkin and spices, sweet brown sugar and toasted malt round out the finish. Slightly bitter finish as well.  Mouthfeel - On the lighter side of medium bodied, kind of thin and slick feeling, which I wasn't crazy about.  Drinkability - This is a good seasonal brew but not one of my favorites from DFH. I would have expected more outrageous over the top spices, bigger malt, and more sweetness from the folks at DFH.

10099,6260,lavellen,4.06,This is one of the better representations of a Pumpkin flavored beer. It's maltiness holds up to the spices and the spices don't overwhelm the Pumpkin's roasty characteristics. The head was adequate and the carbonation was right on. Clear and beautifully orange/brown the color was spot on. Nothing to complain about.

10099,6260,IronLover,3.97,"Deep orange in color with a slight haze. Pours with a thin white head that reduces quickly to a white, wispy cap. Sweet pumpkin, cinnamon and spicy aromas. Medium bodied with lovely carbonation. Spicy coriander flavors in the beginning that lead to sweet malt and pumpkin flavors and very clean finish. I'm not a huge pumpkin ale lover, but I am a DFH lover, so I was compelled to try this. I recall trying 4 or 5 different pumpkin ales last fall and each of them left me feeling like I was drinking a glass of potpourri. The DFH Punkin Ale was nothing like the others. The spice does not overwhelm the big malty character and the aftertaste is more of a sweet flavor than spice. Excellent pumpkin ale.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

10099,6260,jampics2,3.67,"On tap at the Winking Lizard. Served in a pint glass.  This beer looked decent enough in the pint. It's a caramel orange color, almost like Dogfish Head channeled the colors of the leaves that have just fallen in the autumn forest. The off white head just can't hang on and quickly subsides without any lace. Good color, poor performance.  The smells of the season are all captured in the glass , but they aren't just afterthoughts like in your average pumpkin spiced beer. There's some real pumpkin here, tons of nutmeg and cinnamon, some caramel malt, and even a hint of hops. The beer had a wonderful expression that makes it stand out, not to mention it smells more like a beer than a hokey allspiced ale.  The taste is also unique and enjoyable, but it's just not cohesive enough. Some great cinnamon and nutmeg, plus a ton of caramel sweetness, some mild hops, and some pumpkin for authenticity's sake. The real problem is not the elements of the taste, it's the alcohol. Like the last minutes of trick or treat, it comes in and breaks up the party.  The mouthfeel is decent, and it certainly makes other pumpkin ales seem like childs play. There is a medium feel with creamy carb and just a really nice refreshing vibe going on. I like this beer and I'll revisit it again this season and next. It makes beers like Southern Tier's Pumking seem gimmicky by actually remembering to be a beer. Although it's not without it's flaws, the biggest of which is the notable alcohol, Punkin is a worthy Autumn seasonal just about any beer lover would enjoy.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

The color was rich amber and clean-looking, not cloudy.  Pumpkin pie spice and nutmeg were in the aroma, but not overpowering.  Wow, I was very impressed with the mouthfeel of this beer. It was creamy with no hint of carbonation. The taste of pumpkin pie was deliciously subtle and never overbearing, which I prefer.  There's not much more to say. I loved this beer and thought it was absolutely perfect with Sunday brunch in the fall. Well done.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,bifrojm,3.46,"Bottle poured into a tulip glass. Nice copper color with white head.  Smells lightly spiced of pumpkin pie, nice nutmeg and bits of cinnamon. Smells sweet with malt.  The taste is good, not great for the style. Nice blend of spices for a light pumpkin pie flavor. Very malty sweet and unfortunately I feel the booze shines through. I used to love this pumpkin ale until I had more spiced and quite honestly more balanced versions.  Mouthfeel is fine, nice body, decent carbonation.  Drinkability - I still buy this one, but only because I can't get my favorite in Chicago (Schlafly!). It's kind of boozy (tasting, not just in ABV), so I usually only have one per sitting before moving on to something else. There are two schools on pumpkin ales, and I land firmly in the more spice, the better, and I think this is in the more subtle arena. I alos think the balance is off, especially for the Dogfish guys.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

T- The first thing I taste is the nutmeg, then that fades to the other 4 tastes I listed above. Again, it's hard to put it better than the bottle says. It isn't like a lot of pumpkin ales you may try, in that it isn't like eating a piece of pumpkin pie or some other pumpkin desert (note: I'm not saying this in a negative manner whatsoever).  M- Medium mouthfeel. The plentiful spices tingle the tongue on the way down.  D- Overall a very good beer in my opinion. It went down pretty easy even with all of the spices.

Smell: Well, the label sure is spot on here! It basically smells like it says - pumpkin, brown sugar, allspice, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Very spicy and sweet.  Taste: It also tastes very much like the nose. Except the spices are by far the star of the show here. The pumpkin is a bit content to hang around in the background. It would be nice if the pumpkin could overcome the overpowering brown sugar and cinnamon. This is probably spot-on for some people and their memories of pumpkin pie, but it's not quite right on for me. There's just too much spice here for it to be enjoyable for me, probably doesn't hurt that I'm not the hugest on pumpkin in general as well.  Mouthfeel: Medium body and carbonation. About right for the style.  Drinkability: This one is a sipper for sure. I poured the bottle about an hour and a half ago and am only halfway with my mug.

More spicy and sweet in the nose than anything else. For whats in the nose, I like it  T: the palate is right in line with the nose. I gather sturdy roasted flakey crusted malts loaded with brown sugar and drizzled with caramel and butter. Nothing pumpkin-like really stands out as spices reign. I find the combination of nutmeg, malts, cinnamon and sugar very pleasing. However, I might add that the flavors are walking the fine line between manageable and overpowering. I like the taste but in moderation, glad I just bought one  M: kinda heavy and silk like, maybe a few sheets of silk in smoothness  D: more pumpkin would be nice.

All in all, a pretty decent offering for a pumpkin ale. But again, the spices dominate the beer. Spices should be used to enhance an already great beer, not run rampant on the palate, overpowering what could be a tasty ale. Less is more.  M: Fairly thin body with a good carbonation level.

Smells of pumpkin pie, not pumpkin puree or allspice. No vegetal tate heare. This is good so far.  Biscuity and sweet upfront. What I really like is the finish.

I can smell pumpkin for one, along with all the spices used in the making. I think the nutmeg comes out especially nice and complimented nicely with a touch of spicy cinnamon. This really smells like what I think a pumpkin beer should be; pumpkin followed by Autumn spices. As good as an aroma as a pumpkin beer gets in my opinion. The taste reminds me of pumpkin loaf. You know, the stuff they sell at Starbucks. Take that and add a nice malt backbone and you've got a solid form of this. Rich malts followed by nutmeg flavor finishes nicely with the perfect amount of pumpkin. Possibly my favorite pumpkin beer right here.

10099,6260,azsupra,4.14,"A - deep caramel color with a finger of cream colored foam which dissipates rather quickly. Relatively low lacing.  S - Delicious. Like the kitchen on thanksgiving. Aroma of nutmeg, brown sugar cinnamon and clove. If I was blindfolded and this was put under my nose I may just guess it was a pumpkin pie I was smelling. Note that as I'm writing this review my kitchen smells like wet dog and my girlfriend febreezing the hell out of everything in sight to remove the odor of said wet dogs. I tried to get my nose up in the pint glass as much as I could but a lot of these smell notes are from memory.  T - surprisingly similar to the smell. Subtle to moderate flavors of cinnamon and nutmeg. Hops are just barely there but certainly help to balance the solid malty character of this beer. As it warms I definitely notice the alcohol creeping further into the taste, but overall it hides its 7% well.  M - Medium body, surprisingly light in my opinion for a beer of this character. I could use a bit more substantial mouthfeel to go with such bold flavors and aromas but it's certainly far from a deal-breaker for me.  D - While certainly not a session beer, I find myself able to drink glass after glass of the stuff. I look back with slight guilt the sheer amount of this stuff I manage to consume each season. I can't, however rate drinkability as a five as I often burn myself out within a month of this stuff hitting store shelves, but my god is it great while it lasts.

As such it is highly delectable, pervasive, and yet not overwhelming.  T - The taste follows the aroma faithfully, with the only new perceptions lent by the roasty brown ale base; the impression is that of washing down a bite of savory-sweet pumpkin pie with a swig of lightly toasty mild brown ale.

Looks like someone stuck a spiderweb of froth on the inside of my glass.  Smell: Nice pumpkin pie aroma, with nutmeg and malty brown sugar as the major players. A touch of yeast and cinnamon rounds things out. I'm glad that the sweeter pie smells weren't overbearing in the nose. I think the balance was right; it still smelled like a beer and not a cheap air-freshener.  Taste: Very smooth and creamy. All of the individual tastes play well in the pool together here.

S: Predominantly spice, specifically nutmeg and allspice, with molasses, brown sugar and vanilla.  T: Caramel malt backbone with nutmeg and spice. Some alcohol. Not much in the way of pumpkin. Spice is noticeable, but not overdone and this beer is much less sweet than many of the other pumpkin beers on the market.  M: Lighter than expected with appropriate carbonation. A bit of warmth shines through from the alcohol.  D: A good pumpkin beer. I prefer the dry, subdued spice style of Punkin to the overly sweet, overly spiced, trying to be a pumpkin pie beers.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Not big on funky options normally, and have had some pumpkin ales that turn the stomach....however, from Dogfish one expects more--this delivers!

10099,6260,Spider889,3.49,"Had this on tap at Winking Lizard, served in a signature DFH Punkin' Ale glass.  I have heard a lot about this beer, and was eagerly awaiting its arrival this year to try for the first time, but unfortunately due to the ever early releases of seasonal beers these days I had tried numerous other pumpkin beers before this one. I guess I somehow expected this to be much better than most, which it may be - except in flavor.  Nice orange/amber color. Fairly clear and well carbonated.  I didn't get much aroma out of this beer despite trying pretty hard. A little bit of cinnamon and mild hops but that was about it for me.  The flavor was very well balanced, but not very unique either. Lots of the usual spice suspects: cinnamon, nutmeg, maybe some clove. Lightly bready malts and very mild earthy hops. I got some of the flavors of pumpkin pie I guess, but not really any real pumpkin flavor.  Ultimately this is an easy drinker, and it is very well balanced - most pumpkin ales are such unbalanced cinnamon bombs that more than one glass can be a chore. I could easily session this all night, but at the going rate: $11/4-pack, I'd rather drink several other more flavorful pumpkin beers (or something better from DFH - Burton Baton has started showing up).",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,Flightoficarus,3.83,"Serving type - Bottle  A - Pours a rich amber, with a two-finger, off-white head. Leaves moderate lacing.  S - Smell is of pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, and spices, and a slightly earthy character from the hops used. All of these elements are somewhat sublte.  T - Now this is how a pumpkin ale is done! Essentially, it's like a slightly less sweet pumpkin pie flavor in a glass. Pumpkin, cinnamon, and spices, and some sugar, all well balanced by a nice, earthy hop background that really helps the pumpkin flavor stand out.  M - Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with moderate carbonation, and a slightly bready texture.  D - A bit strong for sessioning, but up to a couple of these are nice.  Overall - This is one of the better examples of the style I've tried. A nice, balanced fall ale that's bursting with pumpkin flavor. Perhaps an excellent Halloween beer? give this one a try if you like your pumpkin!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Color is a deep amber brown and glowing. Not great carbonation. Really nice melding of flavors. Some pumpkin beers are too spicy, this one's spices match with the malt body and carbonation to create a great package. Nice squach flavor backed up by allspice, brown sugar, cinnamon, and great malt charecter. Mouthfeel is also bomber, smooth caramelly. Overall high points are aroma and mouthfeel, followed by flavor, apperance is lacking. Drinks well for a pumpkin beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

This stands up pretty well to what I want in a pumpkin beer, though. It doesn't have the extra spicy and savory punch of Pumking, taking a more laid-back approach. It looks okay, nothing to write home about. It smells more like beer than pumpkin, with malt, nutmeg and clove being dominant. Tastewise, there's a lot of nutmeg and some cardamom thrown in for good measure. It goes down pretty well, if a little watery, and leaves a tangy taste behind. I'd have paid for the four-pack, even if it's a little pricey, and I'll probably have this again before the season's out.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Taste: Not a very lasting taste, but its very balanced- feeling of both bitter and sweet. Can taste a hint of pumpkin while followed by bitterness. However, the bitterness is not overwhelming.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, Balanced carbonation, finish is refreshing with a note of burning alcohol  Drinkability: I would drink this again. It is not overwhelmingly bitter while not being too sweet.

Well, I suppose the price point for a four pack has tended to dissuade me from picking it up but I was able to get a twelve ounce single. Not amazing looking on the pour but looks pretty good; typical pale ale appearance with a white head that doesn't last very long or leave any mark of its existence. Smells really good. Heavy with the pumpkin bread and pumpkin pie spices one would expect. Nutmeg is strong with hints of clove; cardamom if you know to look for it. Flavor is less impressive but it doesn't taste like you just took in a mouthful of dry spices. There's something of a brewed cider going on in the flavor. Maple syrup type sweetness that lingers with the spice medley. This isn't something I'd want to make a night out of but tasting this next to other beers makes for a pleasing experience.

Taste: The spice notes come through pleasantly, and the pumpkin shows up throughout on the palate. The brown sugar is certainly there, but you do have to look for it.  Mouthfeel is very pleasant, and creamy. The carbonation is very pleasant.  Drinkability: It goes down quite easily, but I believe I may get bored with the beer after a few.

Aromas of your standard run of the mill pumpkin pie spicing, along with a kick of hops to throw you for a loop. Taste is amazing, a balance of scent and taste in this one, with a slight bitterness and spice to start that reminds me of a rye brew, followed by a flavorful jolt of fall spices and a light, light hint of sweetness to finish it off. Alcohol is barely noticeable, good balance of malt while somehow managing to still account for a hop presence in a pumpkin beer.

I figured, what the hell, go with the easy choice and select a Dogfish Seasonal. Punkin Ale is what the old lady and I settled on. What a good way to bring in Autumn.  Having poured into a proper glass, it looked like a Fall inspired Ale should, a warm orange/brown. The white lacing stuck around long enough for me to finish the beer at a moderate pace.  It smells like desert time on Thanksgiving, but unlike a lot of it's pumpkin peers, it's as if I'm in the living room next to the kitchen and the smell of pie is just infiltrating the room enough to get my mouth watering... not like I'm snorting lines of pie filling. Hints of cinnamon, nutmeg remind me of ginger snaps.  It's taste? All of the above flavors, but thankfully, not as sweet as their solid-food counterparts. Very delightful.  Average ale feeling in the mouth... with an almost creamy feel, but not quite there. Good amount of carbonation.  This is definitely a good brew for when the leaves start to turn.

Couldn't drink at it (had the baby with me and was driving), but bought a few beers to bring and decided to save a few of each for home. First up, Dogfish Head's Punkin Ale.  Looks nice. Label is simple, like all Dogfish Head labels. 7% abv--not bad! Poured into a standard pint glass. Very pale brown--almost orange, which would be in keeping with the theme. Little head and no lacing.  Smells like pumpkin. Slight hint of cinnamon. Neither is overpowering, and there's no hop or malt scent. Overall it's actually pretty nice. I don't think I'm too into pumpkin beers (I'll have to check my ratings from years past), but I am not turned off by this at all--in fact, I can't wait to try it!  Tastes good. Pumpkin, which was so strong in the nose, drops out here. Overpowered by nutmeg and something else--cloves? Nice taste though--mild and good.  Mouthfeel is average. Nothing special. Right amount of carbonation; right amount of foaminess.  Drinkability--high marks for this one. I would drink this all night. The flavor is mellow and has just a hint of bite form the spices. Like I said, I don't think I generally like pumpkin beer (or spiced beer), but I am sufficiently enamored by this that I would keep having it all night (if the spices didn't stop me first).",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

The pumpkin taste and aroma are apparent at pour they do diminish over the life of the drink. But this is *not* a negative! The pumpkin taste and aroma transform info more complex brown sugar and cinnamon flavors and smells by mid-drink and the end of the drink and this is very much a good thing.

T- Crisp clean taste of malted spices, nutmeg and pumpkins. One of the better tasting pumpkin beers that I've sampled.  M- Moderate amount of carbonation. Crisp clean finish with a minimal bite.

There is more spice than pumpkin it seems, but reasonable amounts of each. Slightly alcohol in the finish. M- Slightly sturdier than average and perfectly smooth throughout.

10099,6260,Thur123,3.81,"This beer pours a pretty clear brown orange color with three fingers of lacing that fade quickly leaving a thin layer of white head at the top. Well carbonated. The smell is nutmeg, cinnamon, perhaps something more savory like a bit of chili and lots of brown sugar. There is a slight gourd smell around all of the spice smell.  Glug glug glug  Way maltier and far less ""spicy"" than some of the pumpkin beers I've had. This brew seems to be working away from the sweet spices and more towards a more realistic pumpkin pie (at least as far I as remember) by not being overly sweet and somewhat savory (from the gourd flavor). The toasty brown ale malts show up and fresh bread and there is a slight hop edge, that's just slightly bitter, to add complexity to the flavor. There is a vegetable flavor, like pumpkin seeds and meat with the blend of spices balancing it out. Overall this is a well balanced and tasty brew, but I would have liked more push from all the pumpkin flavors. (I'm saying the pumpkin aspect is currently at a five, I think six or seven would be just fine) Body and mouth feel work fine.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Taste: Begins with spicy cinnamon and nutmeg with a hint of brown sugar, finishing with breadiness and spiced pumpkin notes.

Nose: There is some spice in the nose, which I was able to detect in the taste as well ... sweet and spicy smell with a hint of alcohol.  Taste: Not as spicy as the nose would allude to, although, admittedly, I am not a pumpkin ale fan. I did not taste pumpkin in this beer.  Mouth: Thin and a bit watery. The alcohol was detectable.

Taste was amazing. Typical pumpkin ale spices such as cinnamon and allspice with a hint of the rumminess from the brown sugar. Extremely drinkable but still held on to it's body. Very well balanced.

But this time I found it to be boozy and somewhat spice dominant rather than actual pumpkin flavors.  a- More of an amber ale than a brown as the bottle states. Some head retention issues, maybe due to the alcohol content. I will say it is remarkably clear.  s- Smells like a spiced up barley wine.  t+m+d- It tastes rather young. Boozy and sweet. I kind of find the spice dosage to be overpowering. There is notable pumpkin flavor, but it is masked by so many other stronger flavors. and although I love my high ABV beers, it just doesn't seem to fit into this beer. The harsh booziness is distracting from the pumpkin, which is the reason I bought this particular beer. Kind of a mess. Maybe its too fresh/young.  I am usually not so critical.

Clear light brown brew turns bright orange when held to a light. From a moderate pour it gives a lovely thick and creamy light tan head, minimal lace. Smell is fairly hoppy but hard to characterize because it blends with a bunch of spicy fresh cinnamon and clove. Backbone is moderately thick malt that similarly blends with a sweet-starchy pumpkiny body, like pumpkin pie beer. Taste is also pumpkin pie, with a moderate hop adding oomph to the spice and a moderate bit of marzen-like malt adding body to the pumpkin.

Let this one sit out of the fridge for a little while because none of the flavor comes out when it is too cold. As it warms you get the pumpkin spices with a nice balancing hops.

Remains smooth while packing a ton of flavor, and the aftertaste doesn't linger too long, just long enough to be very pleasant.  Overall a very good beer. Nothing over the top here, and also nothing to let you down. Great for getting you into the mood for fall.

Look: orange with a slight amber hue and a small creamy colored head. Very lovely in appearence. Smell: exactly like the bottle saying says: pie spices, pumpkin, brown sugar, and a mild hop aroma. Just a good smell all in all.  Taste: almost identical to the aroma, linking starts of with a malty forefront giving you the taste of pumpkin, pie spices, and brown sugar and a decent hop kick at the end. A good solid flavor overall.  Feel: smooth, silky, just a tad bit thick, and a prickly feeling on thee tongue before it goes down. Wonderful feeling overall.  Drinkability: truly outstanding drinkability; punkin is smooth, crisp, refreshing, solid, and just overall tastes good. I could easily drink this one back to back.  I will admit I'm not a huge fan of the hop kick at the end, but all in all this really is just a wonderful beer that's perfexct for summer or fall.

The pumpkin is there in the taste. Up front is still that spiced nutmeggy cinnamon concoction, but then the beer mellows for a second and lets the pumpkin float in on the backside. The beer finishes with a bit of nutmeg/pumpkin aftertaste that makes me really want fall to get its ass here already.  The mouthfeel is probably the weakest part of the beer for me. It's a notch or two above light-bodied, with moderate carbonation, but I want a pretty thick pumpkin beer. Wouldn't that be delicious? A pumpkin syrup in a glass? Just give me a bit more body and I'll be satisfied.  All in all, another excellent beer from Dogfish Head.

The taste is clearly of pumpkin, with a proper dose of spice as a little bonus rather than the main taste. Sweet and biscuity malt centered beer with just enough hops to make the beer balanced.

Smell - Pumkin, nutmeg, malts, hops, sugar and a very bitter, almost pickle aroma also  Taste - Hmm, this is different. Defintley taste the pumkin, hops are present, as usual the alcohol also. Many spices also i taste. Basically its a jacked up brown ale with pumkin spices and added sugar.  Mouthfeel - I enjoyed the first taste, was simular to pumkin pie but after i swallowed, the aftertaste is nutmeg and all spice. Ekk, not liking that at all.  Drinkabilty - Well, im glad this bottle was given to me, so i didnt get stuck buying a 4 or 6 pack. One is fine for me, maybe two if i was eating pumkin pie. I wish the beer had more malts and pumkin and less spices. Ill stick with great lakes or smutteynose octoberfest.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,Star80,4.6,"Pours a rich reddish copper color, appears filtered, but knowing all the additives this is not one you'd not want to filter. Has a nice thick tan head. Smells mildy soapy, but yet spicey, and a lot like pumpkin pie. Not detecting much alcohol in the nose for such a strong ale, can detect some maltiness in here as well, as a brown ale should. Now the taste of this beer is where it blows all the other pumpkin ales away, it is like an amped up pumpkin ale and everything else seems like a watery compromise, like a lager with spices and stale pumpkin powder. THIS beer however, is extraordinarily complex. I can taste the cinnamon spice on the tip of my tongue, and at times the spicyness almost feels kinda prickly on the tonque, in a good way, like it is fresh ground. The pumpkin melds together with the malts to give it breadyness that is comforting like, well, a warm slice of pumpkin pie. The malts do have a solid toffy flavor of a brown ale. Not much presence from the hops aside from a backend bitterness and slight whiffs in the cornucupia of aromas in my glass. . Mouthfeel is rich and full. I've been on the lookout for one of these for years, finally tried one (thanks to DiCarlo's Liquors of Mundelein, IL). This is the new standard for a pumpkin ale, everything else is wayy behind. Drinkability is my only concern, wish it was a bit less strong, but then again why mess with perfection?",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

T - I can taste a bit of pumpkin here, but I have to look for it. I want more. The aformentioned spices are quite prominent and well-balanced by the slightly sweet malt. Brown sugar is subtle but present. The hops are there too of course, and provide a bitter, dry finish. I can detect a bit of booziness though. I was on the fence about whether to give this a 3.5 or a 4.  M - good carbonation and body, and the dry finish balances the sweetness nicely.  D - Not sure if I'd want to drink more than one, but that kind of goes for all pumpkin beers.

A bright and clear copper and topped with a rather quickly disappearing bone white head.  S: Not overpowering pumpkin pie aroma which is nice. Nutmeg light cinnamon, star anise, pumpkin of course. But these are only hints of what is to come.  T/MF: Tastes remarkably like pumpkin pie but not overpoweringly so, not as thick a mouthfeel as pumpkin pie, I suppose that is because this is beer and not food, but I guess what I am trying to say is that this beer conveys the idea of pumpkin pie, minus perhaps the almost overpowering aroma of the pie, into a beer. The pumpkin, the sweetness, the spiciness is all there and melds perfectly together. It's really hard to imagine another beer being able to do the same thing to such a perfect degree. In terms of style the taste cannot be beat, at least as far as I can tell. Feel is not nearly as thick as I was expecting from a pumpkin beer that tastes and smells like pumpkin pie, but such a realization really does not detract all that much from the overall enjoyableness of this beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

It is subtle, and well done at that. Also get a heavy dose of doughy malt on the back end.  D/M: Light to medium bodied with nice carbonation. Very easy to drink, and the 7% is hidden very well.

Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint.  Aroma - Sweet smell, pumpkin spice, citrus, hints of cinnamon. You can tell it's going to be a very sweet beer. Has a linger of a malt scent.  Taste - It's a very sweet ale right off the bat. Cinnamon lingers as it goes down. The pumpkin is very prevalent in this beer. Extremely smooth. It's not like many other pumpkin ales where there's only a hint of spice, it's very powerful. The sweetness adds to it. Not bitter at all.  Mouth - My only complaint is that it can be a little dry as you get into a full glass. Although the aftertaste it leaves makes up for it. Very sweet, similar to that of a pumpkin pie.  Drinkability - I was very impressed by Dogfishhead's attempt at a pumpkin ale. I may sound repetitive but it's very very smooth. It's a lot sweeter than others that I have tried, they really aren't afraid to use their spices. Definitely a must.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Initial taste is mostly of pumpkin, which is later joined by some nutmeg and cinnamon through the finish. Taste is fairly sweet the entire time, although it's not as sweet as other pumpkin beers I've tasted so it keeps from being cloying. Hops are pretty much completely absent. I can tell just a bit of the booziness on the backend too...for style, the ABV is a tad high. Not much of the sweetness hangs around after the swallow.  I think the beer is certainly pretty good in replicating the taste of pumpkin pie. The lack of overpowering sweetness is a good thing and keeps it from being artificial tasting.

The cinnamon and sweetness of the brown sugar great you up front at the taste. The pumpkin and spices great the sweetness mid taste and it finishes off as the full melded flavor.

Some biscuity malt present, with a slight taste of nutmeg and alcohol. Pleasant without being overstated.  M: Nicely carbonated, yet slightly thin. Still nice though.

This beer smells of really clean Fall spices(nutmeg, cloves, all spice, cinnamon) and they shine through in the taste. The taste brings forth all of the fall spices you can think of with the addition of caramelly malts and a slight mettalic presence. This is really the only flaw in the flavor that I could point out.

Slightly bitter almost too much English amber malt that leads to a slight sweetness of cinnamon and pumpkin all-spice but leads more bitter malt. Ehh it's ok for a pumpkin ale but I was told this years version was the best...  M - Overall medium to light bodied with full flavor.  D - Well I still don't like it.

T- One thing that jumps out at me right away is the alcohol, not hidden at all for 7%. The nutmeg stacks with the alcohol to make a slightly offensive flavor. The cinnamon is also highly present, too spicy. I get some nice pumpkin notes but they seem random, having to get past the spiceahol. The more I drink, the more I get that ""wet dog"" vibe.  MF- Light creamy body with a moderate amount of carbonation. Pretty warm from alcohol. Huge coat of spice coats the palate.  DB- Between the alcohol and the spices, I would prefer to split even the 12oz. A good pumpkin flavor masked by way too much spice flavor and alcohol. I probably should have been ready for this.

A frothy off white head builds through the narrow part of the tulip to an impressive height, but mostly disappears rather quickly. A little scattered lacing. Slight haze to the amber body.  Nose is somewhat reminiscent of the carmelized stuff on the edges of a pumpkin pie. Unfortunately, any real pumpkin flavor seems to be drowned out by a wave of the usual suspect pie spices. Enjoyable bready malts aplenty underneath it all, but there's a certain metallic quality to the spiciness that just doesn't mesh well with the malts. And again, actual pumpkin flavor is rather lacking.  Overall impression: Enough with the gimmicky pie spice beers. I hope to find a decent pumpkin offering this year (Weyerbacher and Smuttynose, here I come). In the meantime, I'll pass on this one unless I find it on tap with the brown sugar rim that is apparently all the rage.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,DanOLeary,3.95,"Aroma: Prominent nutmeg will hit the nose first with an underlying aroma of pumpkin pie. The label says cinnamon but I get a lot more clove than cinnamon. No notable hop aroma or malt texture.  Appearance: Polished copper with brilliant clarity. The head pours a low layer of white frosting on top of the beer and sticks lightly to the edge of the glass.  Flavor: A delicate balance of malt sweetness blended with candy sugar and light nutmeg. These flavors hit the tongue right away, but as the palate gets used to the sugar and spice the malt sweetness becomes more prominent overall. It's reasonably lightly spiced, which pleasantly allows some hop bitterness through. Finish is dry with traces of sugar sweetness left behind.  Mouthfeel: Medium light body with light carbonation. The body starts out slightly watery but there is the presence of light syrup in the middle which fills things out. Finish leaves some stickiness behind. Little to no alcohol warmth.  Overall: This is a surprisingly easy drinking pumpkin ale that doesn't try to go over the top on the pumpkin aspect. Though on that note I would say they could push the pumpkin in a little more. If you were handed this beer without knowing what it was you'd probably call it an Amber Ale with nutmeg added. Not necessarily a Pumpkin Ale. Definitely a nice drinking beer with an even blend of spices, sugar, and malt sweetness. I'd buy it again. But it could use a little more pumpkin.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

S - Freshly baked pumpkin pie complete with all spices (nutmeg, cinnamon and caramelized brown sugar).  T - Full-bodied, distributed carbonation. Nutmeg is up front but cinnamon is dominant after the first sip. Once the beer warms, the pumpkin in this really shines, though it's never dominant. More spices than anything but I really love the flavor distribution in stages here.  D - Whoa, 7% on a Pumpkin Ale? A bit higher than the average 5-6% so watch these. No alcohol hints whatsoever.

The smell is dominated by nutmeg, but the taste is nice enough, full of spices but also obviously made with real, fresh pumpkins, which impart a sweet, funky air to the proceedings. I wasn't too fond of the sour pumpkin/maple taste--I think I wanted something that tasted more like pumpkin pie--but my boyfriend said that was his favorite note. The light, zesty body is nice and made this easy to put down.

Starts with pumpkin, cinnamon, and nutmeg and ends with a roasted, bitter malt flavor.  M- Pretty highly carbonated, but sufficiently smooth and creamy.  D- Pretty high.

10099,6260,zoso1967,3.73,"Punkin is served up a very attractive bronze amber with a nice parchment head that leaves near perfect lacing.  The aroma is akin to pumpkin pie with plenty of allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon and brown sugar. There is a slight waft of pumpkin and slightly toasted malt as well.  The flavor is a melding of all the pumpkin pie spices mentioned above and a mixture of pale and toasted malts. This beer seems to taste different every year, and in 2010 it seems to be somewhat lacking in actual pumpkin flavor. I would characterize it as being fairly dry, and am wishing it had a bit more malt sweetness in there to jazz it up. It tastes good, but it just seems to be a bit off the mark for a pumpkin beer. It is also worth noting that even though this is fairly strong for a pumpkin beer at 7%, it is not at all noticeable.  The mouthfeel is medium, and as mentioned above it is quite dry, and finishes as such. The finish itself is very clean and does a good job of not weighing the palate down with all those spices.  This is a drinkable beer, but just doesn't impress me that much this year. I am not sure if it tastes different, or it is just that I have tried other pumpkin beers since I first gave this a whirl years back.

Samples from this year? Or last year's juice?  Brilliant copper color with fine white head that lingers and then quickly reforms with a swirl. Tons of ripe spice and brown sugar aromas.  Fleshy with pie spice flavors and an oddly assertive hop presence with a lingering and somewhat bitter finish. I'm surprised by the review below because it was about the least sweet pumpkin ale I've had. My fellow taster remarked that it almost seemed light after the what she expected from the aromas. I agreed but liked it for this, especially considering the number of cloying bombs in the category.  If I had a concern, in fact, it would be that someone who wants a pumpkin ale will want more flesh and someone who wants a beer that tastes like this would be averse to ordering a pumpkin ale.

Smells of brown sugar and cinnamon escape from the surface. Dont get any of the other likely spices. It's more sugary cinnamon like a cookie than pumpkin pie, which I do not enjoy as much. The prevalent brown sugar makes it seem more India Brown like its cousin than Red or Amber like it is supposed to. This beer is just too over the top sweet, ""standard Pumpkin"" and a bit boozy for me to be impressed. (And I can say this because 2 of my favorite pumpkin beers, Weyerbacher Imp Pumpkin and Southern Tier Pumking are also high in ABV while not tasting like a thick sloopy mess). It's just not quite as pumpkiny as it should be, cinnamon and clove alone do not make it a pumpkin beer.

Rich, mahogany colour, looks like ""liquid wood"" actually. Very pretty to look at. I got alcohol at first on the nose, maybe cause it's not so ""fresh"", but after a while, PUMPKIN, very rich, very sweet aroma. Together with rich sugar cane (brown sugar?). Dare I say almost ""whiskyish""?. Either way, very interesting. Rich taste of brown sugar and pumpkin, and the alcohol is VERY present. At 7% I wasn't expecting it to be like this but, again, maybe it's because it's almost a year old. Despite the 7% ABV, I would say this is highly drinkable.

10099,6260,Hojaminbag,3.8,"I'm aware that this punkin is about 9 months old (maybe 10), but I decided to review it because I actually like it better now than when it was fresh.  Punkin has a Clear, dull orange-colored body that is clear but has a few traces of sediment floating around.  Punkin Ale has the aroma that I expect of a pumpkin flavored ale; a blend of spices such as nutmeg and brown sugar, a touch of pumpkin and generally the same aroma as pumpkin Pie.  Nutmeg is such a strong flavored spice that I sometimes wonder if it is a good idea to brew with it. For me, it sometimes tends to be overwhelming. Punkin does a decent job with it however, the nutmeg flavor is pretty strong without being overwhelming or off-putting. It is still the strongest flavor in the beer though. Since this bottle is a few months old, I really wonder if the nutmeg has died down with a little bit of age. I swear the last bottle I tasted had entirely too much nutmeg flavor going on. After that I notice the other spices that Punkin was brewed with, including allspice, brown sugar and cinnamon. I would say out of that group, the brown sugar is most noticeable and the cinnamon is the least. After those there is just a touch of hops that adds some bitterness, and some biscuit-like malt sweetness. I swear I can taste a bit of pumpkin also, but there is a good chance that the combination of pumpkin pie spices and the fact that I expect pumpkin fools me into tasting it. Overall Punkin is a solid pumpkin flavored beer.  The body is fairly light, and the carbonation is moderate. Basically, there is nothing remarkable in a positive or negative way about punkin's mouthfeel. I'll call it solid.  Punkin is a solid pumpkin flavored beer, and when the season makes its way around again in a few months, I'll probably give it another try if I am in the mood for the style.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

It was stored at a little warmer than optimal temp, around 60-65* Site requires me to select another ""serving type""  Appearance: Poured into a nonic pint, yields a two finger, tan head that gradually fades into a thin cap. Has a pretty, burnt orange/sienna brown colour with minimal lacing.  Smell: Smell from the get go is much more promising than the fresh bottle. I smell more malts as well as a certain earthy spiciness similar to nutmeg mixed with noble or English hops, and a faint whiff of cinnamon and caramelized sweetness. I can actually detect the vaguely sweet pumpkin aroma now, which makes me a happy camper.  Taste: A fair amount less alcoholic and more flavourful than I remember, which is great. Spice flavours are more prominent, which is to say present, but subtle, which is okay. Definitely not a spice bomb - nothing cloying or overbearing. Still, it tastes like a vaguely spicy Boston Lager, not too much going on, but that's fine. It's not meant to be a legendary, epic beer as far as I am understood.  Mouthfeel: Light-bodied ale, nice, soft carbonation. Nice and smooth. I wish it had a bit more body and character though.  Drinkability: Definitely more drinkable than the tiresomely alcoholic fresh version. If you ever buy a 4 pack, try one, see if it's too fresh, and store the rest for 6 months to a year before cracking them open again.

Light pumpkin taste is noticeable first followed by nutmeg. A burst of bitterness hangs around for a little bit, finally giving way to some bready notes, brown sugar, and very faint cinnamon. Aftertaste is dry and crisp. Overall very mellow and balanced.  Creamy and mouth coating with high carbonation.

The appearance and aroma - pumpkin pie spices of clove, nutmeg, cinnamon - combined with the appearance evoke autumn.  The taste is sweet and malty with only very light hop bitterness. It is loaded with spice flavor: it truly tastes like a mouthful of spice and the soft flavor or squash holding it together. There is also a slight alcohol presence that adds warmth.  It is extremely smooth with a thin mouthfeel, making it very drinkable.  This is by far my favorite autumn ale.

D: I could not have more then a few at a time, the pumpkin pie spice rush would be too much for me to take.

Appearance - Pours a brown/amber with no head and minimal lacing that dies about halfway down.  Smell - Honestly, not the beer's best point, but nice smooth, minimal pumpkin, roasted malts come through. No hops noticeable.  Taste - Smooth, rich maltiness with a solid pumpkin afterglow. Again, no hops noticeable.  Mouthfeel - Honestly, the beer's best point (IMO), smooth and creamy with a coating that doesn't doesn't cloy, and doesn't dominate the palate.

10099,6260,luchris80,4.22,Tasting Notes: Stored in the fridge and served in a pint glass.  Aroma: Pumpkin pie-like spices (definitely nutmeg and some allspice). Full malty sweetness and seems like a real pumpkin aroma is there (in back).  Appearance: Medium brown color with copper tint. Slight cream color head with good retention and no trail. Mostly clear with some haze.  Flavor: Medium maltiness with slight toasted and caramel notes. Very slight hint of pumpkin spice flavors. Extremely low hop flavor and bitterness with a hint of dryness at the finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium body with fairly high carbonation (has slight bite). Smooth with a very slight warmth.  Overall Impressions: Good beer for those who don't like pumpkin beers (or think that they don't). Great balance of pumpkin aroma and maltiness in flavor. Nice beer for the season . . . at the top of pumpkin beers for me (pending further research). Maybe slightly high alcohol for style (4.3-6.2% for Brown Ale).,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,ThatWineGuy,3.87,"Clear auburn / mahogany on the pour yielded a distinct orange sheen once it settled. A tan head sizzled to start out fed by a spritzy array of bubbles but soon settled to a loonie-sized centre film that looked just a bit scuzzy. Carbonation continued smooth and even until about half glass.  The smell reminded me of boiled and mashed pumpkin destined to become pie filling, much like my mother made back in the day, with light hints of spice. Taste was full with good body and spice predominant including nutmeg, cinammon, all spice and a bit on the sweet side as well. A nice smooth texture, a bit gassy. There is a light bitterness at mid-mouth with a finish that started out full and rich but got sharper with warming and a bit earthier.

The initial spices hit too hard in my opinion  Mouthfeel- Smooth, almost creamy feel but with an initial sharpness that takes away from the overall taste  Drinkability- Only 7% alcohol but it feels like a higher proof beer...

10099,6260,biegaman,3.66,"If orange is the appropriate colour for a pumpkin ale then consider this one exemplary. Its icy, unvaried orange suit is not only a winsome colour but it is furthermore coated in a glitzy luster that shoots out straight arrow beams of pumpkiny radiance. Its head, too, is praiseworthy. A thick, soapy white collar never relents and in many places has left behind little, glinty, snowflake-like specs of lacing.  It isn't hard to figure out what spices were used - Dogfish Head lists them right on the label. Brown sugar, allspice, cinnamon and nutmeg were all thrown in, alongside actual pumpkin, too. Traces of all those ingredients can be found in the aroma as well as a sizable share of sweet, honeyed malt (which is good because although I like my pumpkin ales spicy, I like them to be able to have enough of a base to support all that spice as well).  The spices are appreciated in the flavour too - appreciated mostly because they aren't too overwhelming. An overly savory or excessively balmy beer can become overbearing, especially when it contains more than 5% alcohol. Dogfish Head seems to have done well integrating the spices (and the alcohol for that matter). As result, the beer is quenching and quaffable, much in the same mold as an IPA.  Curiously, I taste more of the pumpkin than I do the pumpkin-pie and spices. The flavour is discernibly squash-like, perhaps more so yam-like. In other words, this doesn't point to dessert with ice cream, more like main course with a side of vegetables. It isn't without sweetness, mind you. The brown sugar may be the most noted of all the adjuncts, despite the fact that the taste of allspice seems to be ever lingering.  It's tough for me to say where Punkin' Ale places on my list of favourite pumpkin ales. I'm noticing it's a fine line between those that are too spice-dependent, too perfumy and those that are too inhibited, too understated. I find Punkin' (this year's vintage anyhow) belongs with the latter, which, although in someways is better than the alternative, still doesn't seem to satisfy my urge for a hearty, savory Thanksgiving-time tipple.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Appearance: Orangish, good head, the head may have been fuller at poor, this thing could have sat for a bit before I got it, so reasonable retention...  Smell: spices, I think, all spice maybe, coriander, cinnamon, cloves? It smelled good, but not great. 3.5  Taste: Winner...this was good, the spice level was just right, not too much pie, not too much beer, the flavor saturated my palate from start to finish, if you swirl it around in your mouth you'll pick up on the spices as well as the sweetness from the sugars and malts, but it's well bittered with hops to prevent it from being too sweet.  Mouthfeel: About right for the style, thinner than a stout, heavier than water. I can't say too much here, except that it was carbonated at about the right level.  Drinkability: 12oz at a time is enough for me, It's drinkable but not like something I want to go right back too when I finish my first one, the reasonably high alcohol would prevent me from trying to make a night out of these, but the snifter I had lasted me through my meal and the 2 ipas my friend drank with his dinner.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

There is a bit more kick in the aroma, since the base beer here is a 7% abv brown ale. If I were to compare it to a pumpkin pie, I would say it smells like the part of the pie right next to the crust.  The flavor of the beer comes mostly from the spices, but has a good amount of robust maltiness to back it up. The malts in this beer contribute some slight caramel sweetness, but it's quite plain.

Took awhile pull everything out. Cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugar all compound and make a very refreashing and inviting smell. Even a juicy citrus pear undertone helped zest the smell. A little alcohol was detected. May have been more related to the nutmeg and spice though. Initial taste upfront was boozy. Again this could just be an odd taste that I could'nt identify due to the spices used. Taste retains with a subtle spicey cinnamon/nutmeg malt. Aftertaste is enjoyable that tends to stick around. Mouthful seemed a little thin. It was a little spicier then I expected and I dont know if it had a definative ""pumpkin"" taste to it.

10099,6260,femALEist,4.42,"Pumpkin ales in general have never beckoned my name. Perhaps it was that keg that my sister got when I went to go visit her in college when I was still in high school. We got a keg of Pumpkin Ale, had a party, and was drinking pumpkin ale for the next 7 days straight. It seemed like a good idea at the time.  Pumpkin ales are usually just too much to handle- too pumpkiny, too spicey, too undrinkable. But when I saw that Dogfish Head came out with one called, Punkin Ale, a full-bodied brown ale brewed with real pumpkin, brown sugar, allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg and 7%, I decided to try this type of beer again.  The nose has a more sweet caramel nutty nose than pumpkin with a hint of spicy cinnamon. The color is a deep red sienna brown. The first sip revealed a spicy beer with a light pumpkin aftertaste- not too pumpkiny and not too overwhelmingly spicy. There is a lingering allspice taste on the tongue after you drink it a while with a hint of sweet syrupy maple. It is not a super sweet beer- it actually smells sweeter than it tastes. The flavors really seemed to open up and balance more after the beer cooled down a bit. It reminded me of a spicy unsweetened apple cider more than pumpkin beer.  This beer is calling for you to grab it for a picnic on a cool Sunday afternoon with a loved one- it wants to be enjoyed outside. Granted I wouldn't go out and buy a keg of it, but a few glasses had me lingering for the holidays to arrive. Perhaps it is my love of Fall that made this beer warm my senses or the fact that someone actually balanced a pumpkin beer for me to actually enjoy to drink.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Taste and Mouthfeel:Tasted of pumpkin, ginger, plenty of assorted spice, and plenty of very sweet brown sugar flavor in this as labeled. The brew was light to medium bodied with a pretty subtle earthy hop presence which really wasn't enough bitterness to override the sweetness in this, which mad this kind of a treat.  Drinkability:This was a very drinkable brew, nothing overwhelming in the least.

There is a nice malty platform and the hops bring some tanginess and bitterness in the finish, keeping it drinkable.

The beer has a nice malt base, but is spiced up in great ways. There are tastes of pumpkin, brown sugar, and a really strong nutmeg taste, which goes well with the pumpkin.

Pretty decent, but after having had a better pumpkin ale the night before, it's not pungent enough to wow me.  T: This tastes like spicy pumpkin soda.

A little bit of alcohol can also be found. Sweet malt is there in the background. Overall aromas not as strong as when fresh.  Tons of different flavors burst from this liquid. Follows the nose pretty closely. A lot of spiciness. Cinnamon and nutmeg are most evident. Malty sweetness is there too.

A bit dry, especially on the finish, but not overly so.  Definitely one of the best pumpkin ales I've had and another great beer from Dogfish Head.

A little tingly alcohol presence, but not in an offensive way.  Drinkability: This is rather drinkable for a pumpkin beer in the way that the pumpkin flavors do not overwhelm, but a couple would be plenty with the 7% alcohol.  Overall, this is one of the lesser pumpkiny pumpkin beers I've had. This is not necessarily good or bad; it all depends on what you're looking for. The 7% makes this beer a nice midpoint between the many pumpkin beers in the 5% range and the bigger imperial pumpkins that rock the boat with 9%.

Steady streams of carbonation can be seen throughout the body. Nice head retention. Decent lacing. Looks pumpkin-y.  Smell: The pumpkin and nutmeg really assert themselves; they're the strongest aromas. Brown sugar probably comes next, followed by the cinnamon and allspice. The overall smell is quite pumpkin-y, and it's not too spicy like most pumpkin ales I've come across.  Taste: Pumpkin flavor isn't nearly as prominent as I had hoped. It seems to have a hard time standing up next to the spices and grassy hops. The allspice has now come to the forefront, while the cinnamon makes itself known in the aftertaste. Nutmeg and brown sugar are still strong components too, but they're not as strong as the aforementioned spices. I thought this was over-spiced at first, but now that I'm midway through the beer it feels much smoother.  Mouthfeel: Spicy, crisp, medium-bodied, and balanced. Aftertaste is mild and decent tasting. Alcohol well masked; finish really isn't that dry.  Drinkability: I'm not a huge fan of this beer, but maybe it's because I'm just not a huge fan of pumpkin ales.

This beer was first introduced at the Punkin Chunkin contest in 1994 as a homebrew by Dogfish's owner before he even founded the brewery. Since then, it has been released each year around September as a seasonal and, according to Dogfish, is usually gone by Thanksgiving. It is a brown ale brewed with real pumpkin meat, brown sugar, cinnamon, allspice, and nutmeg. They didn't list any information about the malts or hops, but did say it is 7% ABV and 28 IBU.  Punkin Ale pours clear with a nice amber color, creamy off-white head, and leaves good lace behind. It has a crisp, malty nose which was very pleasant with no overpowering pumpkin aroma. The first sip revealed a crisp mouth-feel all around which became creamier as the beer warmed. The flavor is full-bodied with some complexity and presents hints of spice around mid-tongue with a pumpkin and cinnamon follow through. The balance of this beer is excellent and the pumpkin flavor is subtle throughout.  I must say I have been pleased with this season's pumpkin ales in general, although I have tried some that weren't that good. Of all the ones I have tried though, Dogfish Head's Punkin Ale is right up near the top.

I can't say that I pick up any of the nutmeg that the label promises, but the overall smell is pleasant just the same.  I must say that the low carbonation feels right to me. If this was a bubbly brew I might not appreciate the complexities it presents. The beer is not thick, but substantial enough to make for an enjoyable beverage.  Boy, now there's the nutmeg, and cinnamon too. What lovely spicing to this beer. There is just enough pumpkin to make you feel that you're drinking a pumpkin beer but it is married extremely well with the sweeter and more exotic spicing.

Bigger tastes of pumpkin and brown sugar ran around hand in had I thought. Clove, nutmeg, cinnamon, and allspice were great undertones to this beer.  M- Medium mouthfeel to this beer. The carbonation on this beer was a little more than what I thought it should have. Made the beer feel lighter and kind of run across the palate in a fall frenzy. Notes of brown sugar, pumpkin, and allspice were left on the palate after sipping.  D- This is a very drinkable beer as long as you like pumpkin/fall beers.

10099,6260,deleted_user_373360,3.8,"In a season of trying as many pumpkin ales as I can get my hands on, I was very excited to try Dogfish's for its outstanding reviews.  Had it on tap at the SPTR Pumpkin Road Show.  Appearance: Amber with good amount of red and orange.  Smell: You get a sense of sweetness that I believe is oats but overall strong spices hits you.  Taste: You are immediately met with cinnamon and nutmeg. They seem to be the majority of the flavor but then the pumpkin comes through really nicely at the end.  Mouthfeel: It's a bit carbonated with a strong quality from the spices but finishes smooth.  Drinkability: In my excitement to try this beer, I can't say I was disappointed but I wasn't exactly bowled over. Definitely a good pumpkin ale and I could see myself enjoying quite a few but eventually the spices would become too much.

10099,6260,Daniellobo,3.95,"Great ""punkin"" ale, nicely balanced and a reference seasonal offering. Notes for the first draft offering, which make it a great session beer although loosing some of the richness found in the bottle.  Presentation: 16 Oz draft serving. Brief if accurate menu description hitting on the main character, and noting Alc. by Vol. (6.95%) Poured into a pint shaker glass.  A - Medium amber to orange pumpkin color with a very short head, almost unnoticeable since the pint has been served almost overflowing. Minimal lacing in this serving.  S - This draft serving has it all there but much more subdued almost to the risk of losing the smell richness. Punkin flesh aroma blended with a sweet malt scent, touched with faint and nicely balanced spices, cinnamon, nutmeg...  T - Follows nicely the smell with a sweet malt backbone woven with pumpkin and the range of spices adding to the personality but not overtaking the brew.  M - Very smooth with nice carbonation and a solid medium body.  D - Very enjoyable, great experience for the style without being over burdening on the spicy side, and stronger on the pumpkin aspect with a nice balance.  Notes: Actually it does not feel that the beer gains much on tap vs. bottled. The presentation is surely cut short by trying to fill a shaker pint glass to the rim, and aroma is hurting as result too. There is a hint of improved freshness but it is barely noticeable compared to a fresh seasonal bottle. The rest remains the same from the notes of the bottle:  One of the greatest (maybe the greatest so far) pumpkin ales I´ve tried. This is a great seasonal offering and one I´m not shy to have often and recommend. The way it offers the pumpkin range with a gentle background of spices but without the often overpowering opposite way around is a win for my preferences so far.

Very sweet smelling with a little spice. Definitely tasted the brown sugar and for some reason reminded me of fresh sugar cookies. It went down extremely well and I found myself saying how good it was every every sip. The sugars weren't overpowering and I could drink this all-year.  Exceptional  9/21/2010 Poured from bottle into Guiness pint glass.  A: Nice amber color with a thin off-white head after pour settled. S: I can definitely smell some spice, nutmeg, and also some of the cinnamon. Very mellow. T: In my opinion quite spicy, can bring out the cinnamon in the taste. The ""punkin"" is definitely in there and melds very well. Perhaps my favorite pumpkin brew by far. Lots of spice but it does not linger in the mouth. M: As mentioned above the spice hits the mouth but does not linger around. Very bubbly but also has this nice soothing sensation. D: I love when I see this on the shelf, it's my favorite time of the year in fall. It's a fun hunt trying to find who will stock it this year because of distribution issues etc. It's so good that I love sipping on this on a nice chilly Friday night around a fire. It's so good.

10099,6260,Buttermaker,4.73,"I used to think Dogfish Head was a little overrated...then I tried their Punkin Ale. It's the best Pumpkin Ale I've ever tasted. It's the perfect blend of sweetness and spice. It's rich but still incredibly drinkable. In fact, I find myself craving more when I'm out, which is rare for pumpkin ales...many of which will I'll still find sitting in my fridge after Christmas. It's got plenty of pumpkin without overdoing it. It's 7.0% ABV but you won't know it until your glass is empty. It's delicious.

Nice notes of cinnamon and all-spice, and a solid pumpkin flavor. Not as sweet as many other pumpkin beers (ie. Pumking).  M: Medium bodied and moderately carbonated. The carbonation helps to keep things a little bit lighter.  D: I've been wanting to try this one out as I figured if anyone could do a good pumpkin beer, it would be DFH.

Taste-wise the spices aren't nearly as huge as the aroma suggested. Pumpkin and allspice were most notable but they didn't overpower like the spices in most pumpkin ales do. It has a medium body, dry texture with that pumpkin bitterness and moderate-low carbonation. I don't like spiced beers, especially pumpkin beers, and I won't have this again because of that.

Appearance: Nice ""pumpkin"" orange coloring. Not too much carbonation. The head dissipated fairly quickly with no lacing left on the glass. Smell: Your nose has to search for the multitude of flavors. Hints of cinnamon, clove, pumpkin pie, slight alcohol all mix very well. Smells like Fall! Taste: Each one I drink I taste something that wasn't there before. Initial taste of alcohol and the signature hops are very light giving way to letting your tastebuds search for the flavors. The flavors of pumpkin, clove, and cinnamon mix so well you almost believe you're mistaken. Very subtle and not an overtly ""pumpkin"" beer like many others. Mouthfeel: Crisp yet thick. Not very carbonated but very smooth and subtle around the middle to back of the tongue. Drinkability: You simply can't have just one.

Mouthfeel is sweet, with spice and finishes with those 2 dominant components lingering on my palate.

I really swirled this around a bit and came up with a little bit of pumpkin and spice.  Taste is wow simply awesome. Everything is there that is stated on the bottle. Nice heavy roasted malts to start it out. Followed by a pumpkin nutmeg combination that turns into a slight hot booziness. Finishes kind of strong with a spicy yeastiness that leaves your mouth watering and wanting more.  Mouth is full bodied with very good retention. Leaves a sticky sugary kiss on the lips that lingeries a while.  Drinkability is very high for me.

What comes through the most is the spices and cinnamon. The smell is nice besides the alcohol smell.  Taste - Very sweet right up front with some nice spicey tones to it, I can pick out cinnamon, brown sugar, and the nutmeg. The label doesn't lie. The thing that is about the hardest to find is the pumpkin flavor, it comes a bit at the end with the booze, but nothing would point this to being a full pumpkin ale. Still good though.  Mouthfeel - Maybe a bit light, has a weird effervescence to it. Was expecting a bit heavier for the style.

S: Smells mainly of nutmeg, then cinnamon, lots of raw pumpkin, some brown sugar  T: Well, it's got a lot of the flavors that i mention in the smell, but it also has a distinct light lager type of flavor, with some metallic hints and a very dry finish almost like a dry wine. Just not really feeling this one.  M: Mouthfeel isn't bad, but doesn't seem to fit this kind of style for me.

D: There isn't really any alcohol flavor that i can tell, but the beer just underwhelms me and doesn't give me what I was looking for.

Pours a dark amber color that, dare I say it, actually reminds me of what a real pumpkin looks like? A quick trot into my living room and I hold up the glass to the pumpkin chilling there, wishing he was made into some great pumpkin beer. Indeed it is true! The color is almost a perfect match. At this point the finger and a half of head is receding at a medium pace, leaving just a bit of lacing on the glass.  Smell - I had barely poured an ounce of this beer before smelling the wonderful spices. Nutmeg, cinnamon, brown sugar, and a definite pumpkin aroma fills the nostrils. My god, did I by mistake liquefy my mother's amazing Thanksgiving pumpkin pie somehow and inadvertently poured it into my SA glass?  Taste - Exactly how it smells. The spices are on the forefront followed by a very ""pumpkin pie"" taste. The drink finishes with a nice clean malty taste which leaves you just begging for more...and which I indulge myself.  Mouthfeel - Creamy, medium bodied with low carbonation. I was surprised at the low amounts of carbonation when I poured this, but was even more surprised at how well it works with this beer. Overall, a pleasure in the mouth (that's what she said).  Drinkability - Unbelievably so. For 7% abv and being a pumpkin beer, I have to physically restrain myself (what a great picture that must paint) from running to my beer cabinet and opening another. Foolishly I only purchased a single four pack whilst in Huntington Beach for my good friends bachelor party...not realizing that if I did not have more self control the four pack would be gone as of tonight. Instead, I somehow have to make these last me until Thanksgiving. Perhaps I will give two to my fiancée and make her hide them where I won't find them.

Taste is more of the same, wit spice upfront, a malty middle and a pumpkin note at the end.  Mouthfeel is medium with a pleasant creamy carbonation.  This beer can be inconsistent from year to year (see 2006 review below), but I think is the best version to date and more balanced and drinkable than most pumpkin beers, included high rate ones like S.T. Pumpking which is too spiced and too alcoholic IMO.  2006 Version: I have been a fan of this beer in past years, thus I bought two 4 packs before trying it this year. I wish I hadn't.  4thoseabout2bock and I did a blind tasting of this, O'fallon, and New Holland Ichabod and Punkin' came in distant last for both of us.  The nose and taste are both imbalanced. The spicing is not strong but is still harsh with rough edges and the spice flavors do not blend into the beer. Unlike O'fallon, I detect very little actual pumpkin flavors.

Orange-amber color with carbonation bubbles coming up nicely through the liquid. 1/2"" foam upon initial pouring, but it died down to a thin foam across the surface. Nice lacing that refracts the light when you hold it up to the light.  I got almost no smell from the beer...what was there was very faint. Maybe, just maybe it was pumpkin but I think I was trying to come up with what that smell was and maybe I forced myself into thinking that was it. As it warmed up that smell got a bit stronger and it reminded me of faint tastes of the beer. Again, nothing strong here but nothing that put me off the drink either.  Taste though the beer comes through. I got some bitter up front and then a nice spice finish. I can't say that I got ""pumpkin pie in a glass"" like some have posted and in a way it reminded me of a winter warmer. The flavors contrast nicely with one another and make it a very interesting drink.  Mouthfeel - lots of carbonation on the tongue that lasts for a bit, otherwise nice and slick going down.

Nice light head creeps up on the top an settled down nearly perfectly with nice lacing down the sides of the glass and a good bit of carbonation peaking up from the bottom. Aroma is spice, pumpkin and cinnamon, hints of brown sugar and a nice light touch of herbal hops that gave it just the right amount of balance. Smooth and very even flavor here. Rich cinnamon and all spice lead the way here, like a nice slice of pumpkin pie, but with a kick. Even carbonation is nicely placed and a well crafted seasonal is what we get. Lightly dry finish leaves you looking for a little more as the light brown sugar notes really start to show as it warms up.   Overall very solid.

The smell was closer to a typical brown ale with lots of malt. As the beer warmed, the spices began to come out in the aroma.  Ice cold, this beer tasted like a fairly malty brown to amber ale. The spice was far in the background. As the beer warmed, the spices came more to the front. However, it was a very nice balance.

M: Just a little watery on at the start, but it's really a nice light body that goes down pretty smooth.  D: Great tasting pumpkin ale. Considering its light body, there are lots of amazing flavors happening in this beer. It's very refreshing and is a nice choice for a fall evening.

10099,6260,taxguyjase,4.34,"At first glance, this beer has a nice rich amber/pumpkin color, with a little bit of heat doesn't stick around all that long. Lots of ""fall"" smells too - nutmeg, cinnamon, a little sweetness and, obviously, pumpkin. The Punkin Ale is definitely a pumpkin beer, but it's not so pumpkin that you feel like someone shoved a pumpkin pie in your face or crushed a jack o' lantern over your head. The brew tastes flavorful and spicy, but not over the top where it could offend. It goes down really smooth and you get a moderate malt and spice aftertaste to finish off the beer. The biggest downfall of this beer is the price - $10.00 for a 4 pack...of course, that's the way Dogfish Head rolls.  Appearance - 3.5/5.0 - amber pumpkin color, some head but dissipated quickly Smell -4.5/5.0 - great smell - pumpkin , nutmeg, cinnamon, little sweetness Taste - 4.5/5.0 - delicious, not overly pumpkiny, but has the spice and malt with that autumn flavor profile Feel - 4.5/5.0 - smooth, with a solid malt and spicy aftertaste Drinkability - 4.0/5.0 - definitely would have again!

10099,6260,droomyster,4.29,"I'm rarely outright enthusiastic about a pumpkin - or any other flavored - beer, but this one is exciting. Pours a hazy amber with fine carbonation; not much of a head. Smells of all the pumpkin and spice goodness of many pumpkin ales but surpasses its competitors by using a healthy heap of biscuity and toasty malts. Unlike other pumpkin ales I've tried, the cinnamon and vanilla are not overwhelming - the sweetness is actually balanced by hops. A highly enjoyable beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Gorgeous deep gold to amber in the glass with subtle carbonation and a nice head that fell rather quickly, but left a ring of foam that laced the glass nicely all the way down. Pumpkin spices--cinnamon, nutmeg (I guess)--immediately evident in the nose, but quickly found them to be very well balanced in the flavor. Rich mouthfeel and recognizably buttery malt balanced with a nice hops bitterness, a subtle fruity spice (the pumpkin spices) all blended nicely on the tongue. Unbelievable balance and complexity. Easily (now) my new favorite pumpkin ale. The 7% ABV was a bit of a put off when I saw it on the label, as I assumed that astringency would be noticed as the beer warmed. That wasn't the case. This was incredibly drinkable from start to finish. Fantastic.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Aroma is sticky sweet sugar, like cinnamon buns. Pumpkin is also detectable in the aroma. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with big malt sweetness upfront in the flavor. There's brown sugar and pie spice flavors in there too. There's a little bit of hop bitterness in the finish and a slight alcohol warmth as it goes down.

Haxy orangey copper in color, i like the tea reference made by another reviewer below, so im gonna steal it, minimal head and ok lacing. Smell is of faint pumpkin pie spices (nutmeg and cinamon) with some vanilla and malty biscuit scents. The taste is a rather mild blend of biscuity malts, pumpkin pie spices and vanilla. Slight pumpkin flavor on the tail. Lighter bodied, slightly high in carbonation, still manages to be slightly creamy. Mild flavor, but unique in its combination.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,stewart124,4.1,Pours a tea color with a nice white head.  The smell is of baked pumpkin pie and nutmeg or maybe it is an allspice. Needless to say my mouth is watering.  On the first sip I am almost wondering if I received the correct beer. Very low key pumpkin beer. The spices are subtle but spicy in the finish and almost produce a boldness that I wasn't quite expecting.  There is a nice caramel/toasty note. The spices are great and this makes for a drinkable pumpkin ale. Very tasty indeed.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,Matthoc116,4.27,"Poured a nice, clear orange/light amber hue, with low to moderate head. Smells immediately of spice and sweetness, with little hop aroma (as to be expected). Very reminiscent of autumn flavors.  First tasting indicates a very complex brew. Initial reaction is a maltiness, followed by an immediate unexpected (but not unpleasant) tartness. Aftertaste leaves a well-balanced spice flavor, which is then followed by a strong vanilla aftertaste. Would have scored even higher on taste if not for the lingering vanilla extract flavor on the back end.  Overall, one of the better, if not best pumpkin ales I can remember drinking. Often the style gravitates towards one of two extremes: pumpkin-pie beer, or underwhelming squash-ale. DFH manages to find a great balance, and subsequently creates a great beer. Functions well as a dessert beer, or as an autumn warmer. Would and will purchase again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

I expected it to look more like a brown ale referred to on the label. The white head did not stick around too long. The aroma reminded me of an amber with evidence of the pumpkin pie spices. The taste is caramel malts and more pumpkin pie spice (nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice) The mouthfeel is rather light for a beer of this sweetness. I probably wouldn't want to drink too many of these on account of the sweetness, not really a session beer.

At the pop of the cap, I was refreshed with the scent of a decent IPA. Not bad, but I had hoped for a more spicy aroma. I cought a very, very slight hint of pumpkin and spice behind the bitterness.  On to the pour...NICE! Good look, and a nice head that stayed around for a while, without leaving a lacing on the top of my glass. When looking through it, I saw a not to dark/not to light amber with a extra hint of red/orange to it. Looked beautiful.  That first mouthfull...felt good, thin but not watered down. Decent carbonation. Then the taste...sadness overcame me. I was quickly brought back to my teenage years, when the ""dirty-30"" pack of Keystone Light was a great deal. Unfortunatly- it was the ""funneled too many"", hurled over the toilet till the sun came up, I need my toothbrush! taste I was reminded of. Honestly, this was the first thought that came to mind.

Rather clear and light for a self proclaimed 'brown ale'.  Interesting sweet light caramel nose with a touch of fruit and sugar. Otherwise has a light amber sense to it. Rather nondescript with just a hint of ginger spice and light 'pumpkin'. Allspice and nutmeg? Yeah, Me Talk Pretty One Day. Or not.  Flavor is light, as is the carbonation.

Smell: Complex aromas here. Biscuity yeast, nutmeg and pumpkin first; cinnamon and a slight hint of brown sugar towards the end. Maybe some earthy hops, but nothing strong coming through.  Taste: Like a slice of pumpkin pie. The strongest spice to come through is the nutmeg - the pumpkin hangs in there at the end. Strong malt character. The ABV is hidden well.  Mouthfeel: A creamy, medium-heavy body with slight carbonation adding a nice bight at the end.  Drinkability: Spicey and creamy like a dessert beer, but I could have more than one.

The head quickly dissapates to a few bubbles on the top of the glass.  The aroma is so close to the Raison d'Etre that I almost think it could be a switch up at the brewery. Then I start to notice a new aroma in there. What is that? Could it be Punkin'? Aroma is nothing special on this one - very average.  The big WOW factor comes upon first sip. The immediate flow of toasted brown sugar, melted butter, rich cold pumpkin pie, and sweet creamy whipped cream all come rushing in like it's thanksgiving dessert. This beer has an amazing flavor that lasts forever! The taste is certainly the highlight. If you really want to taste the sweetness and the cinammon spice then try this beer after a west coast style DIPA. The pumpkin spices are really accented.  The mouthfeel is perfect. This beer is really thick. At only 7% this beer could have gone 10% easily. There's plenty of fermentable sugar still in there. Sam you're a crafty one - no pun intended.  The drinkability is really high on this one. Despite the sweet flavor you feel like you can drink a few of these. The alcohol is a non-factor and you just want more of this beer.

However, while this period occured, there was detected a nose of sweet brown sugar beckoning me. Additionally, this beckoning was enhanced by a faint whiff of pumpkiny goodness.  Initial taste found heavy spice notes with an intense maltiness that makes for something reminiscent of nutmeg - what else would go with pumpkin? The mouthfeel was certainly complex, having a uniform balance of malt and hop, neither of which undertaking to overwhelm the other. Once again, there is the issue of it being served cold.

No real pumpkin in the nose, essentially dry with a few pie spices.  The taste is at first quite subdued, mostly dry with a moderate bitterness. The brown sugar lends it dryness which emerges in the flavor along with a bit of allspice and maybe a touch of nutmeg. Not too much spice, overall this is an easy drinking version of a pumpkin ale, and a decent alcohol wallop at 7% ABV. Unfortunately, no actual pumpkin flavors I can pinpoint, which for me is a problem. The body is medium to light with relatively high carbonation for the style, it lacks an autumnal richness in body. This is a clean, relatively light pumpkin ale.  While this is quite a drinkable beer, for Dogfish Head this tastes simple and uninspired. I wouldn't call this ale off-centered at all, more like a typical, clean, pumpkin ale that does not stand out in terms of flavors. Way overpriced for what it is as well.

10099,6260,marvin213,3.03,"The beer looks appropriately orange. A thin head dissipates to a thinner film. The liquid is fairly translucent and looks oddly like an amber. A pumpkin beer that looks orange is purty cool in my book.  Brown sugar and cinnamon escape from the surface. That's really all I smell. I don't know exactly what allspice is, and I struggle to get the nutmeg. It's more sugary cinnamon like a cookie than pumpkiny. Even if the aim is more pumpkin pie-like, the nose has less substance from that which it claims as namesake.  The prevalent brown sugar makes it more Indian Brown like its cousin than Indian Red like Thanksgiving...and autumn, and everything else we're supposed to associate with pumpkins. It's not quite as pumpkiny as it should be. Only the cinnamon makes it seasonal. Maybe the real pumpkin makes it look orange, but pumpkins don't exactly smash my taste buds. Perhaps I wouldn't want them to, but I'm left wanting more pumpkin from this pumpkin ale.  The cinnamon provides my cheeks a pleasant tingle and, as always, sugar sits well. The nutmeg presents a tad in the aftertaste, and more at the forefront would enhance this beverage. Again, I'm underwhelmed by the pumpkin effect. It feels more cinnamon toast than pumpkin (or even pumpkin pie).  Pumpkin ales are such a niche market--a definitively seasonal style. As such, I have relatively narrowed expectations. This one falls short. It's too sweet to sip multiples, and too strayed to serve seasonally. Though I have enough respect for DFH to keep trying every year, this is far from the go-to for the style.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

M/D: A medium body that is low on the carbonation end. Not watery at all though. Creamy and smooth. Very easy to drink for a high alcohol beer and heavily spiced to boot.

10099,6260,infi,3.2,"12 oz. bottle, courtesy of BA r0nyn.  Poured into a nonic pint.  Pours a translucent dark-orange to brown color that generates a sizable white head of fine bubbles. Tons of carbonation activity throughout the glass with little to no lacing after constant swirling. On the nose, it's very pumpkin heavy with some hints of malt. Can't really differentiate any of the indicated spices on the front label from the pumpkin-laden aromas.  Taste is total opposite from its smell - sweetness from the malt and caramelized sugar is actually more predominant than the pumpkin. But towards the middle, the subtle spiciness from the cinnamon and all-spice becomes present on the tongue and finally ends upon a slight hop bitterness and boozey heat. Good overall taste with a bunch of flavor components. This pumpkin ale has a medium-bodied mouthfeel with adequate carbonation. Drinkability is fair to good. Not one of my favorite beer styles but overall, it's pretty decent. Very fitting for this coming autumn season.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Whatever head there is disappears quickly--not much lacing either.  The smell is really nice, with pumpkin and vegetal notes coming through on the scent, but there is definitely cinnamon and nutmeg too.  Sweetness and brown sugar are apparent in the taste, as well as a nice maltiness. I was also able to taste the allspice more than I could smell it. The pumpkin flavor isn't very dominant, but it's there. I'd say the sweetness and the malt dominate, but there is a nice bitter finish as well.  Mouthfeel is OK. Decent cabonation, but not as full-bodied as I thought it would be.

Tons of cinnamon and brown sugar off the bat with notes of pumpkin pie that gel together perfectly...amazing!  T: Not as flavorful as I had anticipated...a more delicate tasting brew. I pick up multiple Halloween like spices with a light malt body that makes this beer a great transition from summer to fall; not as much pumpkin as I had anticipated either.  M: Nice and light...and in my opinion, fits perfectly with the type of flavor profile represented by this beer.

10099,6260,r0nyn,3.65,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass.  Pours that pretty burnt amber color I'm becoming used to out of autumnal beers. Still looks great. There's a half-inch thick off-white head that disappears quickly. The smell is nice and complex, with pumpkin obviously being the dominant scent, but you can definitely pick out all the other spices they have listed on the bottle, cinnamon being my personal favorite. There's also a nice malty undertone as well that becomes more pronounced as the beer warms up.  Taste is a bit different than what I'm expecting, as the pumpkin is definitely more subdued with the overriding flavor being the malty character. Spices are still there too, but as with the pumpkin, are also toned down quite a bit. There's a mild hoppiness that gives the brew a fleetingly brief bitterness before the spices and malt round out the finish. This beer isn't particularly alcoholic with only 7% ABV to go around, but there's a very faint alcoholic tinge on the back end that seeps into the mild aftertaste. Curiously enough, the pumpkin reasserts itself ever so slightly after the fact, making this the first beer to have me experience the titular flavor in the aftertaste. Not quite sure how else to describe it, but there you go. The bottle advertises a full-bodied experience, but it felt like more of a medium body to me. Went down pretty smooth. Carbonation was decent, nothing too exciting.  Pretty good drinkability, I can see myself enjoying at least two of these in one session. It was my first experience with a pumpkin ale, but I don't think it will be my last. It remains to be seen if I revisit this particular one, though.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,babaracas,3.92,"Pours a nice autumnal yellow/orange + hint of brown, delicate lacing. Smell: a nice toasted scent that when thinking of pumpkins reminds me of toasting pumpkin seeds, caramel sweetness, spice - i think primarily the allspice and a touch of cinnamon. There is a vague sweet squash smell, which I could be convinced is pumpkin. From 10,000 ft, I guess there's a pumpkin pie motif here, but I don't get that fresh baked pie scent I was hoping for. Taste: toffee, brown sugar, toasted, cinnamon and allspice (and maybe nutmeg). I don't really get pumpkin, but with the creamy start to the mouthfeel I can imagine eating a whipped cream heavy bite of pumpkin pie. Unfortunately the sip ends with a feel like eating ground cinnamon straight out of the jar. Overall, this is a nice beer without the added search for the great pumpkin. Too sweet for everyday use, but will be a nice compliment to upcoming holidays.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

D - the 7% ABV is decently hidden, though a little bit pokes through. Wouldn't go out of my way to get again, but I'd drink another if it was given to me.

10099,6260,jbertsch,3.42,"Poured into a tulip glass.  Copper color with a faint, sudsy head that fades quickly.  It smells like a boozier-than-normal marzen with earthy autumn spices and pumpkin pie. A little burnt sugar aroma as well.  Slight caramel up front, with cinnamon spice in the middle. Boozy on the finish (along the lines of spiced rum) with lingering notes of pumpkin pie and nutmeg.  The mouthfeel is crisp and it almost feels like its alcohol keeps it thin. A prickly finish on the tongue.  Drinkability is good for 1-2 bottles but no more.

It reminds me of the color that ends up being made with a combination of vinegar and food coloring when coloring easter eggs. A very thin layer of head with just a little bit of lacing alongside my glass.  Smell: I initially thought all I could get was a sweet caramel malt out of the nose, but after a few drinks I could notice a blend of all-spice and nutmeg.  Taste: Initially a splash of sweet caramel malt. Following the malt the spices run across the palate. Flavors including nutmeg, sugar, cinnamon and allspice. A very nice blend of flavors, although I don't taste very much pumpkin, which is what I was looking forward to.  Mouthfeel: A medium to full bodied beer, with a nice level of carbonation. A nice creamy feeling as it goes down the back of my throat.  Drinkability: A well put together beer, but I'm not sure I want another one of this this season.

S: Obviously pumpkin spice, but also notes of other spices like nutmeg and cinnamon. Spice notes remind me of a spiced rum.  T: A real beer w/ pumpkin added. Often times I find spiced beers to be a light beer with the spice being too much. This time you have a real beer, with the spice complementing the flavor of the beer.

You can taste the pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg and other spices, but nothing dominates. The aftertaste is actually kind of bitter, slightly hoppy and acidic-tangy from the pumpkin meat. Sweet, but not overly sweet like so many DFH brews. Sweetness is brown sugar, sometimes molasses. Carbonation is medium, though it appears lively.

Poured into a regular tumbler. Clear and amber color, wispy lacing with low head retention. Smells like vegetables, orange and - pumpkin, imagine that. There is also an off smell which is almost bark like.  Taste is smooth and creamy on the front and gives a mild acidity and bitterness as an aftertaste. You can taste the alcohol and the pumpkin, but there is also a sugary cake taste in there that follows the initial mouthfeel.  This one is not my favorite from DFH and it leaves a bit to be desired from me. However I do think it is the best of the style and is truest to form so it definitely gets style points.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,pants678,4.31,"This one goes in a standard pint and I pour smaller than a single finger head that almost immediately recedes to a thin lacing. I thought it would be more clouded, denser perhaps, but it's a clear orange and amber body with a white head.  Distinct and complex, the nutmeg stands out and is sharply spiced. I also get hints of brown sugar and, of course, pumpkin pie.  The flavors are not as sharp as the smell. Well spiced pumpkin pie that's complimented by vanilla and cinnamon. The front is bitter, but not more so than is welcomed. Stains the tongue, as opposed to the top of the mouth, and lingers nicely. A substantial part of this brew waits on the back end. It's all very well mixed, nothing really overtaking anything else and the alcohol is hardly even an aftertaste.  It's a frothy brew and the vanilla takes well to that with the cinnamon and brown sugar playing opposite. Hits all the taste buds. My only complaint is that I may have liked something harsher in there somewhere.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Smell is at first grassy, then notes of vanilla schnapps, creme de menthe, caramel, and toast come forth.  I taste the same flavors I picked up in the nose, with the creme de menthe at the forefront. After a while, though, I'm able to equate that minty flavor to a cinnamon and candy sugar flavor. Overall, the pumpkin spice flavors show up during much of each sip, but toward the finish is a vegetable pumpkin flavor; nice, balanced flavors.  Pumpkin Head is medium in body and more full than other pumpkin beers I've had, which I appreciate. Finish is very clean, happily, without being bitter.

T: Cinnamon, cloves, ginger, and nutmeg tingle the mouth. Some allspice and coarsely-ground black peppercorns are also there, but faint. However, a sour yeastiness pulls through and bequeaths some watery malts, which were not too appetizing.  M: A sharp carbonated bite followed by a somewhat watery body and a creamy finish.

Smell: Very nice pumkin aromas here, probably the most official aroma I've yet to see with the spices complimenting the pumpkin nicely without overwhelming it. I also get some brown sugar and some cinnamon in the back. Fresh pumpkin pie is the best way to describe it.  Taste: Now this is a pumkin beer! So much pumpkin flavor, again without spices and such getting in the way. This tastes like ripping open a pumpkin and eating the insides! Generous amount of spices make the perfect compliment, including some nutmeg, brown sugar, allspice, and a touch of ground cinnamon. Malt sweetness in the backbone is subtle and not overbarring on the actual flavor.  Mouthfeel: Carbonation is medium, a bit of bitterness here as well, nice and round on the tongue, robust and hearty.  Drinkability: Hands down the best pumpkin beer in the category, not only is it the closest to hitting the mark on actual pumpkin taste, but the added spiciness adds a zest that no other pumpkin ale on the shelf can offer.

It's a golden color and from the taste you would think it'd be a little darker.  Smell is outstanding. Smells like pumpkin pie coming out the oven.  Tastes refreshing, crisp, and tastes like a pumpkin beer should taste like. It has all the ingredients of a pumpkin pie and they are actually noticeable unlike Harvest Moon or other relatives of the sort. Not very overpowering or too dense either. Tastebuds never get tired of it.  Mouthfeel is well-rounded - not too dense and not too light. Nice crispy bubbles that are a delight.  Drinkability is surprisingly good for the amount of tastes that are contained inside. Also 7% ABV is hardly noticeable and keeps it nice and warm in your body.

Not as alluring as I would like but not bad. The flavor brings more to the table than the aroma. The same spices are there but seem fuller and more developed. The cinnamon comes forward and marries with the fruity pumpkin taste that's subtle but noticeable. It nicely carbonated and somewhat refreshing which is nice given the spice-forwardness of this beer. Feels rather full bodied but doesn't stick to the palate. I could have used a little more hop fruitiness to balance it out I think but it wasn't a huge problem.

You can totally taste the alcohol in this one and even though the pumpkin taste is very good and very real it does not make up for how boring the rest of the brew is. I don't know if I just do not care for these pumpkin brews. I have had a minor handful of them, (not talking dogfish head) and still have one that i thoroughly enjoy. The only reason i come back to them is because i love pumpkin but have not yet found one that translates into beer.

10099,6260,drtth,4,"Moderately chilled and poured into a Duvel glass. A glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically.  Appearance: The beer pours out a clear orange/amber color with ¼"" tan head that recedes soon but then the foam lasts as ring and light patch of foam for most of the beer. For most of the beer, sipping produces spotty lacing that does not cling to the side of the glass.  Smell: The aroma is soft gentle and most like pumpkin pie spices (nutmeg and cinnamon) along with some hop character showing.  Taste: The flavor is crisp and clean like pumpkin pie without the crust. The flavoring spices include cinnamon and nutmeg. This is all backed up by a malt backbone with caramel and light brown sugar. Somewhere in here there is noticeable hop bitterness but it is just a light presence so the sweetness doesn't cloy.  Mouthfeel: The mouth feel is on the light to medium-bodied side but slick, soft, and smooth with some with light carbonation. The finish medium in length and is mostly sweet and spicy with a light bitterness to balance it as they all fade away.  Drinkability: This is a good, well-made pumpkin ale with a nice balance of spices (think ""pumpkin pie""). It has good drinkability and it is pleasant throughout. While I won't want two or three in a row it's a nice change of pace on an evening where you are having only one beer or want a couple of different beers.

10099,6260,sisuspeed,3.88,"Tried this brew alongside Wolaver's Pumpkin Ale and Post Road's Pumpkin Ale. The DFH was bottled on 7/21/09.  The beer pours a clear, pale, orange color, with a slightly off-white head (yellowish) that leaves decent lacing down the sides of a pint glass.  The aroma is cinnamon and spice. Allspice definitely comes through, alongside a caramel smell and some malts. Not much pumpkin aroma coming through.  With regards to the flavor, I am first greeted by a malty, alcohol-infused taste that subsides into a medley of brown sugar, allspice and cinnamon. There is a little bit of alcohol on the finish as well, but that makes sense, since this is one of the stronger pumpkin ales out there. Unfortunately, I don't really get much pumpkin flavor out of this beer. There is a little bit there, but it only comes through after the beer has warmed up some, and even then, the pumpkin flavor is fairly weak. I also get some honey notes on the tongue.  The mouthfeel is smooth and the body of the beer is robust. Carbonation is low, but fits well. Overall, this is a nice, highly drinkable pumpkin ale, but it is lacking in the pumpkin flavor department.

Mouthfeel is smooth and drinkability is pretty good owing to no overwhelming spice, carbonation or any other characteristic for that matter. This one is pretty well-rounded minus the pumpkin presence.  Overall it's a nice fall beer. If I'm looking for pumpkin, I won't crack one.

M- Carbonation is felt on the tip and flowing to the center of the toungh. Creamy and mildly rich with a smooth finish.  D- The Punk was easy to drink and gave me a sense of the fall harvest, pumpkin pies and the crisp autumn air. I would drink more if in a setting where the beer is primary (bar or as someone's guest) however in comparison to other pumpkin ales (Blue Moon's Harvest Moon Pumpkin Ale) I would have to pass on the Dogfish Head for the Harvest Ale. That being said, this is another great beer from Dog Fish Head and if you are in the mood for a great mix between a full-on Pumpkin (to Pumpkin Pie) ale and a great Octoberfest this beer is worth the time to find.  I will be enjoying this brew this autumn and into the future; although in moderation, the 4-pack offering and the price do not promote more frequent tastings.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,BJam,4.2,"Punkin' Ale - Dogfish Head Craft Brewery 4 Pack - $9.99  It was pretty good but I must say, I was expecting a little more from dogfish head on this one. Don't get me wrong, it's a tasty drink, but the problem I have with it is that taste of pumpkin goes away after a few sips and becomes more of just a mildly spiced ale. So it's a little more on the spiced side and a little dryer then most pumpkin ales. Also, not as sweet. I'd say give it a shot but don't expect the crazy dogfish style, this ones a little more on the tamed side.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Pretty common look for a pumpkin ale, I'd say  Aroma is a bit milder than some other pumpkin beers I've had, but it still has the basic pumpkin pie spice scent.  Taste is good..again, a bit milder but not in any way detracting from its good taste. Spices, pumpkin pie  Mouthfeel is lighter than expected  Drinkability is high. I can't even taste the booze.

Smells of sweet roasted pumpkin, some pumpkin pie spices, nutmeg, cinnamon, touch of banana, brown sugar. Starts off with some dry pumpkin astringency with some spices on the backbone. A little bit of sweetness is countered quickly by a nice rounded earthy bitterness. Finishes with some more subtle pumpkin leaving the palate fairly clean. Not overly creamy, but mouthfeel stands up for itself. Alcohol barely noticeable.  A great pumpkin beer. A lot of pumpkin flavor without being overly sweet like many pumpkin beers.

10099,6260,MetalHopHead6,3.88,"2009 Dogfish Head Punkin Ale poured dark copper with virtually no head and no lace. The color was very nice, with the darkness an autumn ale should have; however, the lack of foam was unsettling.  The smell and taste were pumpkin pie spices with ale coming through in the flavor but not so much in the aroma. The feel was thick and bitter with a little too much acid lingering on the tongue. It was an easy and awesome autumn sipper that improved immensely as it warmed.  The best harvest/pumpkin ales maintain the essence of ""ale,"" with subtle touches of spice. With the vast majority, spice overwhelms ale. 2007 Punkin was the best ever and 2008 was too spicy. This one is somewhere in between, but far better than other pumpkin beers I've tried and a pleasure on cool late summer evenings. On the other hand, the bottles included in one four-pack are enough to do the trick.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Cinnamon, nutmeg. Reminds me of a ginger snap cookie. I've smelled better pumpkins then this like PUMPKING but over all the aroma is delicious.  Nice brown sugar flavor on the first sip. The pumpkin flavor takes a background to the sweet sugariness and spices.  Mouthfeel is light and creamy. Almost a bit too light. Almost none of the 7% is apparent.

There's a nice sweet caramel malt taste to go along with the pumpkin.  The heat of the 7% is a little much for the light spice flavors not a horrible thing, but I think the flavors would come out a little bit more.

The flavor is not as strong. Some pumpkin follow by pumkin spice. Vanilla seems rather strong. A nice oaky flavor with a touch of hop bite coming in at the end. Not as strong a pumpkin flavor as I had hoped but enought to satisfy me. Medium body with moderate carbonation. Overall a well put together pumpkin ale.

Aroma is big on pumpkin pie spice - cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, along with a little alcohol.  On the palate, it comes across as drinking an alcoholic pumpkin pie, with all the spices listed above combined with some good pumpkin and whipped cream. Good strong malty brown ale base as well. I've had this quite a few times in the bottle, and it still remains my favorite pumpkin ale.  Feel is much more robust than your typical pumpkin-soda beer.

Color is clear orangish medium amber.  Smell: A boozy concoction of real and fresh cinnamon, allspice and pumpkin. Smell tells you very little about the malt or hops.  Taste: Alcohol, Pumpkin allspice, cinnamon, brown sugar, brown ale malt, caramel. The flavors all blend together nicely creating a sweet pumpkin pie with an earthy twist.  Mouthfeel: Creamy carbonation, with an alcoholic warmth. A great mouthfeel for any type of beer.  Drinkability: Pumpkin ales are sort of a fall tradition for New England Brewers. A lot of them are syrupy and undrinkable. This kicks the artificial flavoring in the ass, this a truly what a pumpkin ale should be, a beer brewed with pumpkin and spice. The taste is natural and is a really good beer not just for a pumpkin ale.

After drinking it, the smell gives a misleading idea of what is to come.  First comes the standard pumpkin/cinnamon/nutmeg flavor, but immediately following and balancing the sweetness is a roasty dark malt, almost a brown ale flavor. Very drinkable due to the subdued pumpkin spice flavor. Mouthfeel is great due to the carbonation. Also, according to the bottled on date, the beer is about 2 weeks old.

Smell: Smells like pumpkin spice and cinnamon mixed with the scent of fresh brown sugar and fresh coffee cake topping.  Taste: Kinda watery and light, more spice than pumpkin. Has a bouquet of clove and nutmeg for the palate but really.. wheres the pumpkin? Finishes off with a burnt malt flavor and some residual sweetness that blends with a touch of bitter hops.  Mouthfeel: Hits all parts of the palate on its way through: some zest, some slickness, quite balanced but leaves a lingering notion on the throat.  Drinkability: Very drinkable at 7abv you can't really tell. The only thing that will stop you grow sick of the spice or your wallet is depleted.

There is in fact a bit of a pumpkin/squash aroma to this beer but it is very faint and subtle, it smells a lot like a warm piece of pumpkin spice cake.  One sip and you know you've got something great in your glass. Its got an incredible sweet malt flavor that combines perfectly with the spices and the subtle pumpkin flavor. Its not an over the top pumpkin pie flavor, instead its a very well balanced beer.  The tangy, spicy, dark sugary sweetness of this beer is really alluring.

S: Cinnamon is the first thing that hits me. There is a sweetness in there. The problem is that I didn't let it warm up enough. There we go... Now the nutmeg and allspice and, of course, pumpkin come out a little more.  T: When at the proper temperature it tastes wonderful. Don't drink this too cool or you'll miss a lot. The flavors follow the nose closely and dance across the palate without stomping it into the ground. The sweetness that was noted above almost seems like brown sugar now.  M: Well carbonated. It has a little of a bite but not from the alcohol content which is higher than expected. I think it is the cinnamon that is leaving a slight dryness but it's different than a hoppy dry.

Taste - Cinnamon and nutmeg mingle at your palate until they wear off. Then a bit of a copper taste interrupts and transitions the beer to it's pumpkin/nutmeg-like finish.

Can be laborious on the palate but is still an enjoyable trait (at least to me)  Drinkability - This is a warming beer and is perfect for the transition of fall.

The smell is similar to the usual pumpkin ale spices (cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, nutmeg) and a bit of caramel malt. Alcohol is less prevalent in the taste, but this beer is MUCH smoother than most pumpkin ales I've had and much less sour. It possesses a slightly smoked taste that balances a light carbonation and noticeable hop character. Again, not an imperial ale due to the lack of maltiness and slight tartness and sweetness, but this beer is significantly more drinkable than Weyerbacher, Sam Adams, and other pumpkin ales.

I really enjoy most DFH beers and until now have not found one I didn't at least like somewhat. So that brings me to here, face to face with my mortal enemy, a pumpkin beer, but this being made by one of my favorite breweries. Poured it into my DFH oversized snifter cause the most important thing is to nose more of the spices... wait, just kidding!!  A: Brilliantly clear golden brown with some reddish color that leads a murky head that starts decent but fades to a sweing light froth on the top.  N: No way, is that... spiced pumpkin? Yep, it sure is. Lots of toastiness though and gives me a ST Pumpking flash back. Hopefully this one weighs up to the pumpkin pie beer of all. There's a slight sweetness but the more aromas I inhale the more spices, cinammon, nutmeg, perhaps allspice... oh yeah, it mentions all three spices right on the label, oh snap! It's also got some crisp lager/marzen aromas that give me the chills thinking about drinking this on a dark windy and cool October night.  T: Here goes nuthin, Taste starts pretty sweet like brown sugar, lots of pumpkin taste but not spiced pumpkin, the spices have been dulled down quite a bit, and the toastiness gives it a pumpkin pie taste. With the sweetness I'm almost getting the feeling of opening a can of pumpkin pie filling and just going to town on it with a spoon and snifter glass. Its got more of those clear and crisp well done lager/marzen refreshing tastes. Its also got some yeasty and fruity lager flavors.  M: Mouth is pretty smooth and slightly carbonated, could use more carbonation.  F: It gives me a little more sweet caramelized brown sugar and more pumpkin on the taste. It finishes pretty clean like a lager and the sweetness fades pretty quickly, but leaves a strange savory taste that makes my mouth smack on its own. A slight taosty and earthy charred flavors adds a slight interesting flavor.  Final thoughts: This beers is actaully a little surpising. The nose is really spiced, but the flavors has sweet brown sugar, pumpkin, very light on the spice, and not really and bad or off flavors.

The beer itself is a shade much like a proper creme soda. Okay, I know it's not cold enough in Maryland yet to really justify this, but it IS September, so I'm digging in.  Smell is somewhat lacking when cold, a little bit of nutmeg and brown sugar coming through. I expect a better bouquet as it warms. Smell is more of spices reminiscent of a pumpkin pie as the beer warms. Pumpkin starts to shine through as the beer comes up to temperature, (I wish I had an IR thermometer on hand) it seems everyone has come to the party as my mug is beginning to empty.  This is spicier than other pumpkin beers that I've had in the past, in terms of it actually has a little bit of heat to it which I'm going to attribute to an abundance of cinnamon. You can pick out more of the spices as the beer warms, grasping the Siedel with both hands to warm it much like you would a liquor.  Mouthfeel on this is oily, as to be expected for the style.  The drinkability on this particular batch is quite good. I've not had Punkin before, but it's not overly sweet like some Pumpkin Ales I've had in the past.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,dpodratsky3,4,"My first ever Pumpkin Ale. Needless to say I am excited about trying this style for the first time. Fall is my favorite season and what could be better than a new style of seasonal to add to my repertoire.  12 oz bottle poured into pint glass  A: An nice clear amber/surprisingly orange hue with a slightly off-white head that foams up nicely and then settles down.  S: Fairly mild considering I was expecting pumpkin pie in a bottle. Some nice hops make it through in the aroma as well as a distinct pumpkin smell. Also lingering in the end is some spices, in particular nutmeg.  T: Tastes like sweet pumpkin pretty much the whole way through. While not quite a bite of pumpkin pie, it does taste like the whole pumpkins they claim to use. It builds to some nice hop bitterness to balance out that sweet pumpkin flavor. The spices hit here towards the end as well. The alcohol is present but not in a bad way, more so toward the end as a slight sting.  M: A semi-thin to medium body, definitely not thick or anything, with a bitey and dry mouthfeel added to by the 7% alcohol.  D: While not a session beer by any means, it is also far from being a sipper. It has nice good balanced flavors (to me, I like some sweet). The only thing detracting is the alcohol bite. A very pleasant beer to enjoy.  Notes: While not being blown off my stool by this beer, I can easily say it is a very good brew. I like my first taste of this style and can say that I will be trying other Pumpkin Ales this fall.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

T - similar to the smell, very yeasty(like spice cake/loaf) lots of nutmeg/allspice/pumpkin pie flavor, there is also a nice coffee and chocolate thing going on, i will go ahead and call it a mocha taste. this pairs incredibly well with the spices from the mentioned ingredients and the spicy yet subtle hops. there is also a nutty flavor that reminds me of pecan pie. this is an insanley good tasting brew. it has all the making of autumn. never is it too sweet or too fillling.

And I hate to say it, but this is very borderline to becoming over-spiced. It's nice, the color is great (aside from the brown ale thing), exceptionally clear, aroma is full of spice and some pumpkin, and the taste definitely has a lot of spice and not enough malty or pumpkin flavor.  My wife and I remembered trying this years ago and not liking it.... and that's hard for us to do. I recently brewed a batch of pumpkin brown, not realizing this was a ""full-bodied brown ale brewed with real pumpkin"", I stumbled on it tonight at the local bevy warehouse and thought I'd retry it.

Has a one finger head that pretty quickly goes to just a small head that is barely there. Leaves some lacing down the glass. Smell is spices and pumpkin right up front. Pretty typical of the other pumpkin beers I've had. Taste is as I was expecting. Pumpkin and spices right up front, and it's followed by that familiar Dogfish Head taste. Really good taste. Has a 7% ABV which isn't high or anything but no alcohol is noticeable in the taste. Really easily drinkable. Of the few pumpkin ales I've had this is up there maybe as the best I've had yet.

10099,6260,cooncat,3.44,"Had Southern Tier's Pumking ealier today on tap, and brought home a 4pk of DFH Punkin ale to do a comparison.  The pour gives you an orange/copper hued brew, with a small thin head. The head started as a half inch cap, but quickly reduced to a white ring around the glass. No lacing of note.  The nose is definitely more 'pumpkin forward' than the Southern Tier version, but I'm detecting a bit of fusel alcohol notes in the nose as well. The Southern Tier Pumking has a higher ABV, but has no fusel in the nose. I wouldn't say the fusels are 'off putting', but they are noticeable.  Whereas the S.T. Pumking tastes exactly like a pumpkin pie, the DFH version tastes more like eating canned pumpkin pie filling out of a can. It doesn't have the creamy smoothness of Pumking, or the malty character of the pie crust flavor. Mouthfeel is a bit below medium .. I wouldn't say 'thin' ... but not fully medium either. There is a bit of hop bitterness which comes through, which probably isn't great for the style. Drinkability is not high on this one; its a 'one and done' for me. I think if DFH had gone for a more malty profile, this might have come off better.  *For me*, this year's Punkin ale is a disapointment, mostly due to the fusel notes and the mouthfeel, and the lack of a strong malt backbone. Sorry Sam, I'll have to recommend Southern Tier's Pumking over your Punkin ale this year.  Na Zdravje!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

10099,6260,bamadog,4.2,"So I'm giving pumpkin ales another shot and this is the first one... I haven't tried one since I was an undergrad and long before I had any idea what I may have been looking for and I distinctly recall not liking them, but here goes personal advocacy at its best I guess. Poured from the bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a near perfect shiny copper color and comes with a one and one-half finger head that fades quickly to a pretty firm skim on the sruface and a thick ring around it; body is pretty clear and shows light carbonation bubbling up.  Smell: An interesting blend of a light hoppiness with a stronger presence of pumpkin pie spices such as nutmeg and cinammon - the cinammon smells almost ""warm"" - so far, the test is off to a pretty good start.  Taste: I'm actually digging this and I'm kind of relieved -- the ale taste is actually fairly mild, even a bit subdued but underneath the heavier spices is a well-made, just slightly hoppy and toasty malty drink, and on the surface are these wonderful and warming spices (especially that cinammon and nutmeg - I swear I'm even getting hints of a sugary sweet vanilla?).  Mouthfeel: Mouth is actually slightly creamy and fizzy from a carbonation that is mild but very present throughout the mouth - a pretty clean finish overall with just a moderate stickiness left on the back of the roof of the mouth.  Drinkability: I am really enjoying this beer - the flavors are nice and perfect for a cool evening that is starting to border on early fall. While I don't think I'd crave something like this year-round, it really is a great seasonal and the flavors are well-blended and don't remind me necessarily of eating a piece of pie, but really add a nice dimension to the beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

A - Pours light brown in color with a thick two finger light brown head that lingers.  S - Smells of pumpkin predominantly, but also of cinnamon, nutmeg, and sugary malt. Smells more like pumpkin pie than many others of this style I have had.  T - Pumpkin flavors follow the onslaught of spiciness from the first sip. A bit boozy in the aftertaste, especially as it warms. Nicely balanced and full of flavor.  M - This has a silky smooth feel and is medium bodied. Not overly carbonated, just right for me.  D - I consider this a real treat and usually have only one in a night to get myself started. Flavorful and to be savored, not drank in quantity.

T - Pretty similar to the aroma - pumpkin flavors melding with a nice spiciness that hints mostly at nutmeg and cinnamon with a touch of the brown sugar coming through. The alcohol content is slightly noticeable, but blends nicely with the flavors in this one. Some of the flavors remind me of a nice alcoholic cider.  M - Medium bodied with a rich, smooth feel.

10099,6260,Domingo,3.72,"This is the latest batch that just arrived and is dated 2009 on the bottle. Pours a bright amber color. Light makes it through with no issue, but the spices add a hint of haze to things. Like most pumpkin beers, the carbonation isn't too heavy. The smell is great. It's not really just pumpkin pie, too. It's like a malty amber ale, crossed with pumkin pie, crossed with ginger spice cookies. Much like the nose, the flavor isn't all spice with no substance. Yes, the brown sugar and pie spices are there, but you get a pretty good nutty amber ale flavor up-front. The spices really come through in the finish. Not too much, either. With some pumpkin ales, the nutmeg and allspice are almost numbing. Not here. It's a sipper, even if it is ""only"" 7% abv. Drinkability will forever be a limiting factor for the style, though. I don't think I'd ever have more than 2 pumpkin ales, and of this one I'd be hard pressed to even have a second.  Easily one of the best pumpkin ales, if not THE best. It does wonders paired with vanilla ice cream and cake desserts, too.The only pumpkin ales I've had that are on par with this one were brewed in tiny batches for on-site consumption only.

The initial flavor is of deep caramel malts but is quickly substituted with tones of pumpkin, cinnamon and other great spices. The alcohol is nicely hidden within this brew as well.

There was very little left by the time it was brought to me and what was left pretty much stuck around the edges. Had far less than average lacing, but all in all looked pretty nice. The smell was pretty good. Spices from pumpkin pie or pumpkin bread, followed by some roasted malts. I'm not really a fan of Pumpkin styles beers (with the exception of Cape Ann's Pumpkin Stout) but this was pretty good. It has the sweet taste that you would expect. However it's not overly sweet like most pumpkin style ales. I kind of wonder if there are roasted pumpkin seeds in this brew instead of the sweet pumpkin spices of most pumpkin beers. It actually tastes like a beer as well, not like it should be warm with a head of whipped cream topped with a little nutmeg and cinnamon. Mouthfeel is good, no carbination or alcohol bite at all. I'd say the drinkability is good too I'm giving it a 4 instead of a 3.5 cause I'm generally not a fan of this style but it was way better than I expected. All in all pretty good.

The smell reveals hints of pumpkin pie, cinnamon and nutmeg--the spice almost has a warming quality to it, as chilled as this brew may be.  For the most part, the taste lives up to the full-bodied odor that it omits. Dogfish lists this as a brown ale, however, it almost reminds me of a nice sweet lager--not to sound tacky.  As simple as its initial taste is, the spice seems to resonate long after creating a lasting warmth--very enjoyable.  The 7% is well hidden in a balance of spice and sweet malt. On the other hand, this does drink like a heavy brew--something I want to take my time with.

Very mild presence of caramel and brown sugar. Light scent of cinnamon.  That's probably as close as I've found to 'pumpkin pie in a glass'. While the pumpkin flavor is a touch to the mild side, it is definitely there. The spices are a little bit more prominent. Nice notes of brown sugar sweetness. An almost pecan-like nuttiness. Very good.  Solid medium body, which is to style. Carbonation level seems a touch on the high side, but that's probably just me. Nice and crisp.

A bit of lacing, but nothing really sticks.  S - Rife with classic pumpkin pie spices - allspice, nutmeg, cloves, and copious amounts of cassia bark (commercial cinnamon). The pumpkin itself is there, but is pushed into the background.  T - Sweet malt and spices dominate the initial flavor profile. The sharpness of cassia seems to tickle the tongue. Where in the heck is the pumpkin?! It seems relegated to a mere suggestion in the aftertaste. So far, this brew distantly reminds me of spiced rum.  M - Here's one thing they got right - it's an easy drinker. Body lies to the lighter side of medium, and the carbonation is moderate. The sharp cassia flavor takes away from some of the smoothness though.  D - It's tasty, but the whole thing seems contrived, like some sort of cheesy holiday beer.

Looks not unlike an English Pale Ale. Not bad, overall.  Some resin and spice on the nose, even a slight funk - it could be the pumpkin pie spices. Definitely something organic and slightly sulphurous on the nose, it's not terribly exciting or powerful, and the notes are just off enough to make you wonder if there's something wrong.  Taste is lightly sweet, with an initial spice hint that wells up until a rather phenolic bitterness on the back, fairly redolent with alcohol fumes. The spiciness is the only thing that keeps it from being thoroughly unpleasant, and while it does a reasonable job, I can't avoid that alcohol presence, which is very much pronounced for something weighing in at only 7%. Mouthfeel has a pleasant sheen to it, but the flavour is either thin or phenolically unpleasant, so it doesn't have much to work with.  Not one of my favourite American brews, and yet again I have to say I'm disappointed with a style of beer I wish I could get to like. Have I just had bad examples??

An element of a mocha character underlying, quite sweet and lacking the funky sourness of the nose, although there is a slightly tart hit at the end and possibly in the mid, kind of bourbony, and the hops on the back are quite woody.  Am not getting much pumpkin, although there is a hint of spice on the mid - nutmeg I think, while there is a noticeable hint of alcohol on the back, but I think it's noticeable mainly because I wasn't expecting a heavy beer from the appearance and smell. Mouthfeel is quite nicely smooth but that booze hit makes me recoil just a bit. Fairly drinkable I guess, but again that zing marks it down a shade.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Has a delightful aroma of pumpkin, brown sugar, all spice, cinnamon, and a touch of nutmeg. Has an aroma of a ginger snap cookie. Just smelling this one gives me incredable amount of excitement. The carbination is soft. Has a light body. A soft duration, and weak finish. All the aromas come out beautifully in the flavor of this beer. Its a wonderful beer.

10099,6260,damienblack,4.07,"Bottle aged about 9 months from this past fall. Unremarkable in appearance. Smell still has a good deal of spicing to it. But in the flavors, the spicing has been mellowed out a good deal by the aging. it's much smoother than before. The flavour is less outlandish, but it works here. Mouthfeel is decent, straightforward fall pumpkin beer. A bit watery, but still better than a lot of Pumpkin Ale's I've had. The extra smoothness adds a bit to taste, but quite a bit more to drinkability. It doesn't make the beer spectacular, but adds a nice little chunk to the review average.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Well, on to the beer:  It's a filtered copper orange...you can see the carbonation bubbles in the body. The head is soapy, sits about a 1/2 inch high before dropping into a thin sheet. Lots of nutmeg in the aroma. Mild pumpkin sweetness compliments the nutmeg and assorted spices. The taste, right of the bat, is very spiced. Not much of a malt base, which would help this beer. The first few sips are pleasant, but thereafter it takes a little work to get down. The beer leaves a numbling feel on parts of the palate, with a strong kick of spice as it goes down the throat.

Smell is immediately of toned done pumpkin pie spices and a nice floral/fruity pumpkin scent. Perhaps a bit of earthy hop scent as well.  This is still my favorite pumpkin beer so far. Taste has a strong malt character with a distinct pumpkin rather than a ""pumpkin pie"" flavor. Pumpkin pie spices are present however, just not as ""clove"" forward as some other pumpkin beers. I pick up a bit of a banana in the fruit component of the taste. It appears sweet on the palate at first with a nice moderately bitter finish.  Mouth feel is on the lighter side of medium, creamy and moderately carbonated and perhaps a bit oily. It has a very nice mouthfeel.

Smell of unsweetened pumpkin pie right out of the fridge. Caramelized sugar comes through.  Champagne bubbles tingle on the tongue initially. Mild pumpkin pie spiciness of clove, cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves Spice is not overdone, as expected by the smell. The alcohol doesn't come through, unfortunately. Expecting more caramelized sugar and pumpkin flavor. Clean aftertaste--well as clean as a gourd beer can be), linger of spices.  Creamy mouthfeel, medium bodied, pleasant.  One is the limit.

10099,6260,JordanChabot,3.9,"This unusual take on an autumn beer could only be a creation of Sam Calagione and company. For those of you familiar with Dogfish Head's bottled works of art, you'll know exactly what I Am talking about. For those of you not familiar...I'm so sorry you've been missing out....But, this is a great beer to start with.... The pour is a thick, dark orange elixir with about a finger of creamy, tan head. The aroma remarkably filled the area as I poured this one and I was hesitant to bury my nose in it....but, of course, I did. The smell is not one of your average autumn, pumpkin-like beers. It was much spicier, as the allspice dominated most of the nose, and had a well balanced finish of sweetened nutmeg. The taste was very surprising, as you get a touch of hop bitterness first, followed by a long single-file line of spices.... Allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg, and just the right touch of pumpkin hit the palate without the over sweetening common to this style. Finally, a very subtle brown sugar finish and a spacey carbonation polish things off...without a hint of the 7% ABV.

Strong pie spices are balanced against molasses, beef broth, while clove seems to be a constant throughout.  This is a fine example of what this style can be, with nothing overpowering. Sweet clove and light alcohol in the finish.  This is a slick, medium-bodied beer with prickly carbonation. The cleansing qualities are unexpected from a pumpkin ale.  Punkin' Ale is unexpectedly thirst quenching, and may be is autumn's response to a lawnmower lager. Perhaps we'll call it a raking beer. Bring this one as nice twist at a tailgate.

Clarity is perfect, and there are small streams of bubbles rising, even in this plain pint glass.  The spicing is well done. Pumpkin notes are evident, but somehow manage to not be squashy. Not overly pumpkin-pie-spiced either. Nutmeg is certainly there, and a hint of cinnamon.  Flavor follows the nose, but with a bit more melba-toast biscuity malt profile. The spicing is strong, but not overwhelming, and the hops, in an earthy and lightly citrus- almost lemon- way, balance out the finish of the flavor.  Medium-bodied with relatively low carbonation and a light syrupy tinge. The finish is lightly dry and tingly, both from spicing and hops.  I'd definitely drink this again. I wish it were more readily available. Not as much of a spice bomb as I expected from the nose, and more like a spiced brown ale than a typical pumpkin ale.

10099,6260,Bootscraper,4.31,"Well, not only is this my first review since joining the site, but this regrettably is also the only brew from Dogfish Head that I have had the privilege of enjoying. Hopefully more styles from this brewery will stand up to my reviewing in the near future!  Poured from bottle into pint glass, at mildly chilled temperature. Beautiful orange to golden hue, getting darker as a near-amber towards the top. Very sparkling carbonation allows for a 1cm even, fairly-uniform head. After about 5 minutes, the head became quite a thin layer that stayed even across the glass the whole way down. Lacing was spotted, but only slowly fell with each sip. The smell was subtle, and composed of alcohol and slight sweetness. Somewhere in there I finally noticed a pinch of spiciness after a couple good whiffs. The first thing I noticed upon tasting was that the spiciness in the aroma was now the center of the action, and really came alive in the aftertaste, drawing hints of nutmeg and also a bit of cinnamon and even brown sugar. Very slight accents of pumpkin were found throughout the entirety of each sip. There was a pinch of alcohol, but it seemed to blend well with the soft spiciness of the flavors, so it almost came across as an illusion that the alcohol was actually well-masked... something I enjoy. The key part of this beer, IMO, is the lengthy aftertaste. It makes it one of those great beers where you can sip it, use the bathroom, come back, and still be noticing some pumpkin pie in your mouth. Even with dabbles small enough to just wet your lips, you can make one of these beers last. The Mouth feel is what really makes this one of my favorite beers, aside from that aftertaste. Smoother than melted butter and very creamy, the texture does not command too much of you, and it glides right down.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

It's sweet cinnamon rolls with some kind of fruity wooden element, coriander and perhaps cherry. It's a very strong aroma. It's medium-bodied and soft with a large and sparse carbonation. It's syrupy and it leaves the lips and tongue a bit sticky. It boasts a strong and smooth flavor. The flavors are very blended. It's something between garam masala and mole. The malt is a little sweet and a little tart. The aftertaste is alcohol, or black pepper or allspice. It's almost like cake with a spiced liqueur poured on it. This seems like it's in the spirit of Bush de Noel but with an autumn flare. Good stuff. Consider this 4-pack punished!

As for the aroma spices, spices and more spices. There are hints of hops, citrus and pumpkin, but boy are ther spices. As for the taste here we go. It starts out with the taste of hops and citrus and finishes with the spices. The mouthfeel is awesome. Absolutely delicious with thanksgiving dinner.

Smell is quite large and full of, well, pumpkin. It's pumpkin pie, no doubt. Amazingly, it has scent similar to a crust of the pie as well with its bready, doughy characteristic. Some light cinnamon and brown sugar. Taste has a bit much cinnamon for me. It's pretty harsh up front. There is still some brown sugar and other spices. Far from what I picked up in the nose in terms of balance. It's here and there with the flavors, never balancing them as one but showcasing them seemingly one at a time. Cinnamon up front for sure along with other spices, a little sugary sweetness and bready finish. Mouthfeel is well carbonated and smooth. Light dryness in the finish, maybe from the spice? The aftertaste brings memories of the crust, which isn't as apparent in the initial flavor. Damn, if only this lived up to the nose. Still not a bad pumpkin beer by any means. It's kind of big.

M-Clean and crisp with medium carbonation.  D-I am not really a fan of pumpkin ales but I really enjoyed two of these.

However, by chance I had a sip of a friends the other day at the Gingerman and was quite impressed. I didn't know it was a pumkin at all, which made me order another one to give it the full scope.  A: Poured into a pint glass, to produce a dark orange on top and transparent lighter side from the bottom to the light. An initial heavy big two finger head that drops quickly to minor lacing and early indication of how Dog Fish does not brew light ABV beers.  S: If you want pumpkin, you got it in this one folks. Sharp spices and bulkier body versions of pumkin almost completely dominate the aroma. Slight dashes of dark sugar.  T: A nice surprise and change of direction from the nose. The level of spices and pumkin is completely controlled by roasted malts and Cascade hops floral elements. Further swirling gives you some caramel and fruit motifs in minor versions.  M: A Rich, smoth and creamy finish for something I would expect to be light and tart. Carbonation is not heavy and in relaxed state that kept me smiling.  D: I take my hat off for the boys at Dogfish again. Just when you think they will always go for the extreme beer and assault you with multiple spices and bang, this is a more relaxed and low key version.

Poured a mostly-clear, dark gold color, with virtually no foam atop this beer. Minimal lace.  The nose is of pumpkin and pumpkin pie-like spices. Unlike other pumpkin beers I've tried lately, this didn't come with any extra off- scents, thankfully.  The taste is of pumpkins and spices first and foremost. Lots of nutmeg and cinammon to this one, and the pumpkin flavor is more substantial than most other pumpkin beers I've had this year. At the swallow, there's a mild, herbal hop bitterness.  Medium bodied, with a slightly coating mouthfeel.  A vast improvement compared with most other beers of the style, though I think I'd still rank Elysian's Night Owl ahead of it.

10099,6260,vurt,4.12,"12 oz. bottle picked up in a trade with joeyspit, poured into a nonic pint glass.  Appearance: The color is a rich burnt orange, like autumn leaves or an apocalyptic Hollywood sunset. It's the exact color I would want in an autumn seasonal brew. The body is slightly hazy, which I wasn't expecting. A vigorous pour down the center of my nonic pint yields two fingers of fluffy, off-white foam up top. The head dissipates after a few minutes, leaving behind a heavy collar surrounding a thin skin of foam.  Smell: Ah, the traditional Halloween smell of candle-warmed pumpkin, rich and vegetal and nutty. There is also plenty of malty sweetness mixed with warm pumpkin pie spices: mostly cinnamon and nutmeg, with a little clove and allspice too. I also a hint of tea-like, leafy hops. This is not the strongest smelling pumpkin ale, but it is still nicely spicy and mouth-watering.  Taste: Starts off with a rich caramel and malt sweetness, followed by the cinnamon and allspice. The spices join with the alcohol to create a bit of heat. It's more of a glow than a burn. The pumpkin really comes through at the end, along with a terrific flavor of caramelized brown sugar. Finishes drier than it starts. The aftertaste contains a muted sweet/yeasty/pungent note which I can't quite describe but I recognize in pretty much every Dogfish Head beer I've ever tried.  Mouthfeel: Body is on the heavier side of medium, and smooth and creamy. Moderate carbonation provides palate-tingling texture. Towards the bottom of the pint, the spices and alcohol lead to a slight numbing of my palate.  Drinkability: This is a terrific autumn brew. The spices are prominent but not overpowering, and the sweetness is rich but not cloying. The pumpkin flavor meshes well with the Dogfish Head note I tried to describe above. I do find the alcohol to be slightly hot, and I'd love to try a version of this beer that falls between 5.5% and 6%.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

This fall seasonal pours a orange-brown color with an average sized white head. It shows spare lacing but a sparkling body. Whatever it may lack in appearance in quickly made up with what it brings in aroma. This is a very spicy, earthy beer with hints of brown sugar, allspice, nutmeg, and cinnamon that become more evident with every smell. It is medium bodied with an oily, also mineral-like texture and average carbonation with a bitter finish.  This beer is the epitome of all things ""fall"".

A - Crystal clear and crayola color orange-red with an audible, medium bubbled light-tan head. Retention is minimal, and lacing is almost non-existent.  S - Cinnamon dominates the nose, with nutmeg coming in second. Perhaps some ginger and allspice buried in there as well. A bit perfumey and slightly metallic. Hops are crisp, but fleeting and hard to pick out in the nose.  T - Sweet and malty -- it's easy to pick out the brown sugar up front. That's a nice touch. Tingly cinnamon in the middle with toasty, warming alcohol. Gets only slightly dry in the finish and never really lets any bitter hops through. Spicy cinnamon Tic-Tac and bread aftertaste. Missing the squashy tang of the pumpkin -- which would be hard to retain in a beer of this clarity.  M - Considering the cinnamon already provides a bit of tingle to the mouth, this could have benefited from a bit less carbonation. On the watery side going in, this one instantly puffs up in the mouth, becoming a bit more foamy than creamy. Swallow is slightly gassy.  D - This is a decent pumpkin ale, but not a masterpiece. If I'm going to go after a 7% beer, I want a more pronounced flavor profile that's better rounded. This one seems to be a bit jagged, much as many other DFH beers are, but also unbalanced.

Aroma: Cakey, pumpkiny, lightly spicy, with hints of nutmeg and allspice, and a faint background vegetal note that's not quite squash-esque - perhaps from a hop addition?

T: the pumpkin pie spice kicks into high gear, here we go. i am thinking a slight nutmeg with all the various pie spice eyou would want. as many i have talked to have said it lacks a certain pumpkin essence but that gets more knocked in the mouthfeel not the taste, because for how i feel it tastes good  M/D: the mouthfeel is hurt by the light body that lacks a certain pumpkin bliss. this is a great beer but you have to wonder if pumpkin is central. i will continue to enjoy it, but wont say it is pumpkin central",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Spots of lacing. Clear light golden orange color.  Smell is a dry spice. Allspice, cinnamon and nutmeg are predominant. There is a raw brown sugar quality. Taste is quite spicy as well. Still very dry and powdery, and a hint of hops bitterness in the back.  Mouthfeel has a mild creaminess and a mild carbonation. I really like pumpkin ales, and this is a good one. I believe the key is the texture, and this one has a good balance.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,caddybuyer,3.58,"12 bottle from 4 pack.  A-Medium amber orange with moderate clarity and a huge creamy and frothy head with very nice lacing  S- A knockout of spices, overwhelmingly and almost overpoweringly clove, with a hint of cinnamon and a touch of sweetness.  T-Clove hits in the initial sip, with an alcohol vapor and a sweeet molasses and brown sugar taste. It says full bodied on the label, and indeed it is. May be a bit too cloying...it is good, but maybe a better dessert beer? The problem with this is that the taste stays with you for days..not good....  M- Full, rich and syrupy with moderate carbonation. Very smooth.  D- This is pretty drinkable and enjoyable, but not something I would like to hit up back to back  Overall I think this is one of the better pumpkin ales I have tried, and certainly is in line with the balance of the DF line. I applaud them for producing such a trifle and wouldn't mind enjoying one of these now and again in the fall.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,blakesell,4.27,"Poured from the tap into a half pint taster glass.  Appearance- Beer pours amber and clear with a finger of creamy white head that quickly ides to a slim froth on the top. Lacing is moderate and linger for but a second, quickly dying to a ring around the sides of the glass.  Smell- Rich pumpkin puree including a nice pie crust. I have a feeling Sam must have changed the recipe, but this may just be the difference having the beer on tap makes. Malt seems even and hops are fairly light for a Dogfish beer.  Taste- Creamy and light medium in hoppiness. Pumpkin isn't near as rich in the flavor as it is in the scent, but it is still there and impressive. Sweet malts mixed with pumpkin, I really am enjoying this beer and pumpkin isn't quite my favorite style.  Mouthfeel- Creamy, a bit buttery but nice, medium bodied, and medium light in carbonation.  Drinkability- Smooth, nice and better on tap than I remember. I'll go for this again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

The nutmeg, cinnamon, and brown sugar are evident as well as a nice malt profile. The malt is giving mostly caramel. Not bad.  The taste is decent. Notes of caramel, cinnamon, nutmeg, and yes the brown sugar are again evident. It seems slightly bitter on the finish though which isn't really sitting right with me.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with plenty of fine carbonation.  Drinkability is moderate. It's a decent pumpkin ale, and I could drink it again. I'm not wowed though.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

First sip bring the spice up for a closer inspection. Nutmeg. Allspice. Cinnamon somewhat. (I get some clove too, but that's not on the label so I won't say it.) It's spicy and cool, weird and familiar, and perfect for a cold, rainy night. Mild malt, moderate sweetness, a little more hops, and an alcohol heat hiding somewhere in the middle. Mildly carbonated, but what is there is fizzy and stinging - just the kind of stab in the tongue this Punk ought to 'ave. Medium body, more or less. There's some good sweetness leading up to the finish, but the post-taste takes on a funky dryness probably inspired by the spices.  Pretty good; good exemplar of the style even if it's not my personal favorite Pumpkin. It is definitely spicy, which I appreciate, but the tight balance that rests midway between beer and pumpkin pie was lost to the spice in this one. That doesn't mean I won't buy and savor my four-pack every year.

Crystal clear with a frothy white head that sticks to the glass nicely.  Aroma is heavy on the cinnamon and brown malts. The other spices are more understated.  Flavor profile has a bread dough base with clear pumpkin flesh influence and notes of allspice and a bit of nutmeg.  Mouthfeel is well-carbonated and medium-bodied.

S: Lighter than expected, nice notes of pumpkin pie spice, and some brown sugar and molasses.  T: Starts of with full cinnamon spice, and light pumpkin flesh. The beer's overall profile changes mid-sip where the brown sugar comes out and ends on a really nice allspice note.  M: Medium-bodied, with a lot of residual spice, well done I though for a pumpkin beer in the 7% range.  D: This is a really good pumpkin beer from Dogfish Head.

A very frothy head, with great lacing.  Smell: Cinnamon, nutmeg, brown sugar, citrus, malts and slight alcohol hints.  Taste: Pumpkin, nutmeg, all spice, malts, and alcohol notes. Nutmeg also comes through in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Thick, rich and creamy. I cannot detect much carbonation. This beer leaves the mouth feeling clean.  Drinkability: This is my first pumpkin beer, and I enjoyed it very much. I will definitely have to pick up another four pack. Though I enjoyed it I would probably tire of the beer if it were available year round.

Aroma is somewhat sweet, if you can smell sweet, with nutmeg & cloves.  Enjoyed the taste. Pumpkin flavor comes through with medium hints of spices.  Carbonation was just the right level for me. No burps.  I finished the four pack in one sitting. I prefer Weyerbacher but this was still pretty good.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,zdk9,4.19,"A- Pours a rich orange ruby color. There's a finger of white creamy head. And the lacing is very impressive- sheets on one side, strong lines on the other of my pint glass.  S- The smell of this beer doesn't tell much of its story. There's a little bit of spice, and some pumpkiny musty notes. What I can't really smell is the malt or hops. I wish the smell was as great as the taste.  T- The taste starts out with delicious malty brown ale flavors- dark rich wheat bread, slight toast. Then comes the addition of a lovely pumpkin flavor- it tastes roasted and rich; sweet but more savory. Spices are there, some nutmeg, cinnimon, perhaps some clove (or allspice as I think I remember from the label). Hops aren't too present but the bitterness is there, and perhaps they are just well blended into the pumpkin/spice flavor profile.  M- Good, a little syrupy, but nothing drastic. The mouthfeel is very appropriate for the taste of the beer.  D- As I was drinking the 3rd of the pack last night I was struck by an intense nostalgia for fall up north- and it's not that there's really anything in this beer that reminds me of specific things like pumpkin pie or mulled cider- just that this beer tastes of fall like nothing else. I am truly happy to have bought it and highly recommend it to all who are looking for a little fall in their lives.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

A- DFH Punkin' Ale pours a dark, translucent golden orange with about 1/2 inch of head. S- Smells like sweet pumpkin pie. I smell cinnamon, nutmeg and some other spices. T- Tastes like it smells, like pumpkin pie. The same spices that were present in the smell are there in the taste as well, with the added flavor of actual pumpkin. M- A good medium bodied beer, the moderately high alcohol content is barely noticeable. D- I could go through a couple of this with dinner, but just drinking them by themselves I don't think I'd want more than one.

I like the smell a little better than the taste. Thick. Chewy. Pumpkiny. My first brew of this type and it's pretty cool. Hard to describe but a good experience.

I don't recall this from last year, but could be wrong (as that was a few hundred beers ago).  D: I love grabbing one of these in the fall. Just tastes like the season.

Festive pumpkin pie spices hit the nose first...nutmeg and allspice mostly with some actual pumpkin aromas. Some pie crust even as it warms. More pumpkin in the flavor while the spices fade into the back a little. Fruity esters creep in and blend with the overall sweetness.

I'm pretty disappointed.  Smells of nutmeg, pumpkin, fresh-baked bread.  Mmmm. This beer is pumpkin pie in a bottle. Great taste of pumpkin, nutmeg, cinnamon, with a finish of molasses. This tastes like Thanksgiving. I like it.  This is more watery than I would like. Feels a little thin. I was expecting a bit more robustness. Having said that, it is still quite drinkable, even given the higher alcohol. I like this.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

T - Somewhat disappointing. The brew's full nose is not matched by the taste. I know that pumpkin beers don't necessarily have to taste like pumpkin pie, but I found the pumpkin flavor to be muted by an abundance of cinnamon and brown sugar.  M - The beer goes down easily, but leaves an almost filmy feeling in my mouth. The alcohol and the spice work in concert to provide a pleasant warming feeling. Maybe a bit thin, especially in comparison to the very full nose.  D - Not the best pumpkin beer I've had, but certainly better than most.

Physically, it seems a bit flat but not bad.  The aroma is dark toasted bread, mostly whole wheat, crust, hay, a little caramelized pumpkin, and hints of spice, mostly cinnamon.  The taste is interesting with a mix of leaves, bread crust, pumpkin, spice, a hint of alcohol at first, with subsequent flavours of burnt pumpkin and toasty raisins. It's lightly sweet and zesty-spicey, with a spicey, leafy bitterness in the finish along with burnt pumpkin and toast.

Best smelling pumpkin ale I've had so far in terms of spices. It's hard to say what  T- As far as spices go, Cinnamon comes through, some clove, and a nice backing of malt sweetness. Really no doubt you are drinking a spiced ale here.  M- body isn't watery (like brooklyn pumpkin), and it's not on the heavier side either (like weyerbacher imperial pumpkin).  D- the spices, though bold, don't get in the way of drinkability here.

It really does smell a lot like pumpkin pie, and that's a good thing. Mouthfeel is just right with small bubble carbonation. Palate starts with a wallop of the spice, but a nice hop balance reminds you that it's a very nice ale. The flavor blooms as the temp goes up, and reveals a little more malt as it nears room temp. Finish is a little dry with a lingering bitterness. Alcohol is nearly transparent upon tasting.  DFH does this one right every year. It's not a gimmicky beer, like so many other ""offbeat"" seasonals. This years seems a little spicier than last's, and I may prefer it to this year's. But that's a close call.

Very little head on a kind of aggressive pour down the middle of the glass with not much lacing present.  Smell is mainly of spices. The big ones I can smell are nutmeg and allspice with hints of cinnamon in the background making a slight contribution.  Taste finally brings out the pumpkin taste in this beer. It gets your right from the second it touches your tongue. It's there, but it isn't too much all at once. A lot like the apricot in the DFH Aprihop, the pumpkin merely complements the flavor in this beer rather than serving as the focal point. The taste develops to reveal a strong taste of brown sugar which brings with it the spices I mentioned before. Alcohol is present in the finish and the exhale, but is not overpowering.  Given the heavy texture of some pumpkin ales, this one was a pleasant surprise. It was medium bodied with a little bit of carbonation that adds just a bit of tingle to the palate as you sip.

T= Taste was dominated by the pumpkin pie spices, but there was a definite sweet malty presence as well as some mild hops and fruity yeast in there too. The finish was both spicy and filled with alcohol warmth.  MF= Medium bodied with a creamy feel up front. Crisp carbonation finish made this a refreshing beer.  D= A very drinkable punpkin ale, and one that will certainly appeal to fans of brown ale and pumpkin pie spices.

10099,6260,JamesS,3.2,"Pours a nice copper color, but with very little head and no lacing. Nice scent, very pumpkinish, with pie spice, although it's almost too pieish and not enough aleish. Nice taste, same with the taste, with a lot of spice and bit of hops in the aftertaste. Not the smoothest pumpkin ale, but not bad. It's worth a try, but I prefer Blue Moon's, it's easier to find, cheaper, and just as good (in one of the rare cases of a macro being just as good, or better, than a craft).",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,IBUnit63,4.15,"Solid, clean amber body with sparse carbonation rising to nice 2-finger latte head. Decent honeycomb lacing.  A little soapiness at first with hearty pumpkin spice, mild vanilla tones, moderate malt scent and minimal traces of hops.  This has a good amber malt profile, piney hops, ample carbonation and a mild pumpkin spice tone that has strength but is not overpowering. Doesn't have the typical DFH off-putting earth I tend to experience. Very, very good.  Very decent mouthfeel-strong presence and full malt and pumpkin spice. Ample carbonation cuts the heft and finish is full without aftertaste.  Drinks cleanly. Strong but tight.

This review is a bit late in the making since my first was over a year ago. Since then, I've had more than a couple of pumpkin beers and this is certainly at the top of the heap. My only complaint is the drinkability. So many spices in this beer that it will haunt you the next day. Try as you might, you can't escape it. 2 or 3 and call it a night. Just make sure you stock plenty of it because your non-beer drinking friends will love it too.  See above for the numbers.

Pours a deep orange-tinged amber hue with a small off-white cap of foam that dissipates rather quickly and sticks very little to the glass.  Smells wonderfully of holiday spices, with mostly nutmeg showing through above all else.  Spicy flavors of pumpkin pie wash over the whole of the palate, with a slight brown sugary sweetness touching the front and a slight hint of sweet, earthy pumpkin entering in as well. A rather strong flavor of cinnamon and alcohol show through as the beer warms, with a medium-long, sweet brown sugar finish that coats the back of the mouth.  Medium-bodied but with a thick, chewy character undoubtedly imparted by the inclusion of real pumpkin in the mash.

T - Pumpkin and spice persist (and dominate). There are also notes of orange and lemon. Some phenolic tones come through as well, along with just a touch of hop bitterness in the finish.  M - Medium-bodied, wet and creamy finish, carbonation doesn't get in the way of the flavor. The phenolic notes hamper the smoothness of it.

Has a good frothy head with a reddish/brown tint. Head lasts a minute or two before dissipaing and leaves some good lacing behind.  Smell: Heavy on the pumpkin and spice. Can definately detect the cinnamon and nutmeg, along with the scent of molasses. Has just the right touch of bitterness.  Taste: Predominant pumpkin taste, but not too sweet by any means. Has a nice mixture of pumpkin, brown sugar, malt, and some good spicing. A very relaxing taste.  Mouthfeel: Nice and smooth. Not overly heavy but not thin at all. The aftertaste is mostly pumpkin with a slight bittersweetness. Very good.  Drinkability: This is a very good pumpkin ale, as well as a very relaxing beer. You can definately sit back on a nice autumn day and enjoy this one. Just pour it in a glass, as it tastes better then drinking right from the bottle.

The taste starts off with some malty sweetness that fades into some pumpkin and spice in the middle, but just a little. The finish is surprisingly clean after a little bit of hops. The mouthfeel is a little watery, but the carbonation helps to add to that crispness.

10099,6260,AltBock,3.21,"12 oz. bottle with the usual recycled paper label, but this one has their symbol in a pumpkin. Below that is all the list spices that went into this beer. To the far left of the label is a notched year. Mine wasn't notched, but this is the '08 edition.  I know this is a Pumpkin Ale, but I poured this into a Unibroue tulip anyway. Out of the bottle comes a beer that was golden amber in color was with a decent 1/2 an inch fluffy head of white foam. This head of foam had really good retention that left behind a small white film and few small blots of lace.  This Pumpkin Ale smelled like they burned the Pumpkin somehow. It was hard to get pass the burned pumpkin, but when it was swirled around, a touch of pale malts, a hint of brown sugar,a splash of nutmeg, and a dash of cinnamon emerges from behind the burnt pumpkin.  They did not burn the pumpkin in the taste. They managed to isolate that in the aroma. The taste was lightly toasty with toasted pale malts and ripe pumpkin. After the pumpkin is where it got spicy with brown sugar, cloves, nutmeg, and cinnamon. At the end of spice line is where the taste gets slightly hoppy with some crispy spicy hops. I liked how the taste went from the malts, to the pumpkin, to the spices, and then finishes up with the hops.  This was a light to medium bodied beer with a slight dry pumpkin aftertaste of pale malts, pumpkin, cloves, cinnamon, and nutmeg.  Not a bad Pumpkin Ale at all. I liked how this Pumpkin Ale relied a little bit more on the pumpkin that on all of the spices.

10099,6260,whitestag,3.3,"While the label calls this a brown ale, I would say that it was more of a copper shading toward reddish amber. Almost no head -- just a single layer of bubbles that vanished within seconds. Pleasant spicy aroma, but heavy alcohol scent and taste -- surprising, considering that this ale is only 7% ABV. Could not detect any pumpkin scent or flavor, and I'm a pretty serious pumpkin pie freak. Less spice flavor than I would have expected from the smell. Fairly pleasant mouthfeel, would have been improved with less alcohol taste. More than adequately drinkable.  Full disclosure: I ordinarily do not drink pumpkin ales. I've tried several over the years and have failed to understand what the big deal is.

10099,6260,chuckd123,3.8,"Poured into a DFH snifter straight from fridge. Color is a dark-orangey / dark honey, almost caramel-looking. Head was about 1 finger and a half and did hold up for the 30 mins I drank the thing.  Smell -- unlike others, the first thing that hit me was cinnamon. Don't get me wrong, the pumpkin is very present, and as I went back and smelled it a few more times and let it linger, I'd call it about 50/50 pumpkin and cinnamon. Some hints of brown sugar also. Frankly smelled like something I could see drinking for breakfast, but overall impressive.  Taste was very good -- you have to go into this aware of the fact that it's an unusual brew and thus won't taste like anything else you're familiar with -- but as DFH almost always does, I think they've nailed the style. I like a balanced beer where the flavors and aromas linger and meld together, this one does just that.  Mouthfeel was good, nothing surprising one way or another about it, but good.  Drinkability was very good. Not a huge beer, and about the only thing that would prevent me from drinking a lot of it is an almost sugary-sweetness inherent in the style. Just something that I'd probably cap at 2 or 3 tops.

Smell: The aroma was full of spicy clove, cinnamon and nutmeg.  Taste/Mouth feel: It has decent pumpkin flavor up front with a good solid malty body. Hints of sweet brown sugar, pumpkin pie spices and vanilla notes mix in well and add a good, well balanced complexity. It finishes on the sweet side and slowly with mild spicy hops and mild warmth from its 7%abv. The palate has a slick, smooth texture with medium to full body and lively carbonation.

10099,6260,popery,3.9,"The second report from my recent Pumpkin Ale purchases. I had this the same night as the Buffalo Bill version, and the difference was huge. Dogfish Head gave me faith that this style can be done well. The beer has a balanced, restrained flavor that is heavier on spice than sweetness.  The beer pours dark and murky with a light head. You can practically see nutmeg and allspice floating through the dark orange depths, and those flavors come through strongly in the aroma. If these beers mostly smell like slices of pumpkin pie, this one is on the heavily spiced end of the spectrum of pumpkin pie. There is some pumpkin in it, but baking spices are the stars.  This emphasis on spice or pumpkiny sweetness seems like the right formula for a Pumpkin Ale. The spice imparts a warmth and cheer to the malt flavor of the beer. Pumpkin flavors chime in without drowning things out in sweetness. It's a good, warm, holiday brew.  Similarly, the mouthfeel is on the spicier, warmer end of things. The carbonation is relatively light, but that's after the soda-ish fizziness of the Buffalo Bill. Drinkability really only suffers because I just don't love flavored ales. This is a good beer, but I don't want more than one or two bottles of anything that tastes like a dessert than I don't eat outside of one day a year.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

S - Strong, spicy, phenolic aroma with notes of cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove. There is a spicy yeast note in the background that supports the spices nicely.  T - Lots of malt with toasted notes and a bit of toffee. The spices come in the middle mostly cinnamon and clove along with a bit of meatiness, presumably from the pumpkin. The finish is malty and smooth with a bit of yeast spice.  M - Medium body, medium high carbonation, and a fairly dry finish. Slight astringency in the finish.  D - As pumpkin beers go, this is certainly one of the best. Not surprisingly, the aroma is the strong point; the yeast and spices compliment each other nicely. The spices aren't overwhelming, but they don't let you forget what you are drinking. The astringency in the finish is unfortunate, but overall this is a fairly well balanced beer.

Aroma: Just like a freshly baked pumpkin pie - spicy, lots of pumpkin (obviously), and big doses of sweet brown sugar. It smells exactly how you might imagine while reading over the ingredients. Quite appetizing.  Taste: Brown sugar sweetness and pumpkin up front with a nice spicy nutmeg and cinnamon finish. The beer underneath these flavors is somewhat bitter with sweet and bready malt. You can definitely detect that seven percent booze from time to time, but it's certainly not overpowering. Usually, I'm not a big pumpkin fan, but I really love it in this application. It doesn't really taste like a Brown Ale underneath, more like a malty Pale Ale.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and velvety with a good amount of carbonation. It finishes nicely with the slick feeling you get with higher ABV beers.  Drinkability: Despite the somewhat nontraditional flavor combination and moderately high alcohol content, I'd be more than happy to sit and throw back a four-pack of this over a Fall evening. One of the more sessionable Dogfish Head creations I've tried (for example, it would take quite long night for me to finish a pack of Raison D'Etre).  Verdict: While Pumpkin Ales are nothing new, I knew when I saw the neon orange pack adorned with the shark icon sitting on the shelf, I'd be in for something special. Punkin did not disappoint. Without a doubt, this is the best Pumpkin themed beer I've ever tasted. As I've come to expect from Dogfish, this beer is lavish, complex, and above all, unique.

Nice dark orange color however.  Smell took me back a bit. No pumpkin in the nose and and odd spice smell that seemed to fail around. I could not tease out individual spices such as allspice, nutmeg or cinnamon. A pungent maltiness also got in the way a bit. Hoping the taste would pick up the smell but unfortunately was even worse. Spices were were chaotic and produced strange twang followed by a strange malt backbone. No pumpkin that I can tell and the fusel alcohol further confused the palate. The brew gave me a puckering effect that was not due to hops.  A strange brew indeed that misses the mark in my opinion of what a pumpkin ale should be. No balance whatsoever and had to drain pour. Interesting, many of the DFH unique brews go this unbalanced route for me since the DFH 90 Minute is so fantastic. Seems like the beer was trying to do to much.

Into my Sam Adams glass (thanks, guys!), it's an attractive deep coppery amber clear color with moderate precipitating carbonation. 1 finger off-white head quickly fades to a thin cap and ring. Some lacing remains. Nose is bready and hints at allspice, cloves and biscuits. Flavor of mild toasted malt, lightly buttery diacetyl, and finishes on a mild alcohol burn. Mouth is full and just about right: middle of the road viscosity with a smooth, creamy finish. Drinkability is good: it's a tasty brew though not remarkably so.

The Dogfish pumpkin pours a more orangey amber color with little if any head, lacing, retention. The smell is definite spices in the allspice, nutmeg, and vanilla family. There is a good amount of cinnamon and pumpkin in the nose as well.  The taste is quite substantial, probably the highest ABV pumpkin I have had, and not loads of carbonation or efforvesence. The beer is not well carbonated, a bit syrupy, and quite good. The taste is a nice melange of pumpkin, allspice, nutmeg, vanilla, and some hop presence underneath. The beer is a bit crisp, not much maltiness popping through, and a nice flowery hop emerging towards the finish.

Two fingers of light tan head with moderate retention fall to a thick film, with some moderate to light lacing.  S - Amazing. The spice jumps out at first, mainly cinnamon and nutmeg, but quickly I realize that there's a huge malt backbone, with some toastiness and caramel, and dare I say, I finally smell the actual pumpkin! The multitude of scents are as harmonious and seamless as an actual pumpkin pie.  T - Amazing as well. Initially I'm hit with the spices, again cinnamon and nutmeg (I am trying to identify the allspice though) but there's also a pleasant vanilla flavor backing things up, and it's all tied together with a hefty sweetness from the brown sugar. As the spices subside, the pumpkin itself comes through. Not overly vegetal, or rotten, or disgustingly bitter like some pumpkin ales I've had, but in a beautiful marriage with the strong malt character of the brew. Everything is wrapped up with a long, mellow bitterness and some chalkiness from the spices.  M - Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation. Falls slightly short of perfect; I want it thicker and less carbonated! No real problem here though.  D - Until now I though pumpkin ales were something to have with a meal or start (or end) a night with. This stuff is excellent and I wouldn't mind drinking the entire 4-pack in one sitting, though it is a heavier, slightly intense brew with a healthy ABV.

A well balanced scent of toasted malt and pumpkin flavours are blended with the spices that have been added. A lot of others tend to bring out the cinnamon, while I detect much more nutmeg and pumpkin here. It comes across smelling like a pumpkin pie, crust and all.  T + M: A spiciness dominates, but it manages to do so without becoming a negative experience. The big body gives it some weightiness that pulls the flavours over the tongue to a warming finish, where notes of alcohol come through. Much of the flavour is like taking a well-made pie filling and getting a taste before it hits the oven. The body, with that creamy edge complements that very nicely.  D: A little on the bigger side, and that's okay. It's somewhere between gratuitous gulping and mindful sipping, and I can work with that. While I commend DFH for their experimentation and willingness to try unusual things, I find their brews to be rather touch and go to my palate.

Tastes a lot like a pumpkin pie.  This is not my thing, but I think it's a pretty good idea - to ramp up the usual fall seasonal. It's nice and smooth and full, pretty impressive accomplishment even if I don't love all the spicing. That's not their fault but mine, so kudos to DFH (again).",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,EnojysAnyBeer,4.14,My first pumpkin ale and I am surprised at how much pumpkin pie flavor there is in this liquid  A- Super-clear light-copper-orange with a small head that leaves a bit of lace  S- Smells like a liquified pumpkin pie. Wow  T- Taste could be a bit more beer-like but I don't mind the taste of pumpkin pie. Some sweet malts come through but where are the hops?  M- Feels good but too light for what I was expecting. Also too carbonated.  D- For such a potent brew I could see myself drinking more than one of these in a night if I didn't have such a great selection,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,GoodKnight1220,4,"Poured this from a bottle into a glass.  This was a good light copper color with no real head or lacing.  Smell was of very strong spice. Sweet smell of pumpkin.  Taste and mouthfeel was almost identical to the smell, quite creamy and smooth. Very spicy finish.  Could drink this a few more times, only in the season though.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,pmcadamis,4.76,"Tried this out at The Brewhaus with some non-BA friends while waiting for my fellow beer geeks to show up.  A - Dirty brown with an orange cast. The head is a moderately sized fluffy white cap, and some good lace is left sporadically around the glass.  S - Oh. Pumpkin, pumpkin, pumpkin. I love me some pumpkin, and this has the aroma down pat. I detect some actual pumpkin innards (the gore that gets all over ya' when scooping out a jack-o-lantern), along with the usual pumpkin pie notes found in beers of this ilk. There is a profound amount of cinnamon, cardamom, and nutmeg in this aroma. On a chilly wet night like tonight, I'm falling in love with this scent.  T - Like the nose, this is full of pumpkin pie goodness and loads of cinnamon. This is more like a big warm pumpkin cookie than anything else. The alcohol is actually very apparent in the flavor, but I quite enjoy some booze with my flavor and this tastes like some nutmeg laden cookies downed with a snifter of cognac.  M - Medium bodied, tight, firm, and attenuated. Many Dogfish Head beers have a similarly tight alcohol-y mouthfeel, and I think that this boozy warmth helps keep the beers lively when they could easily be sweet and cloying.  D - Killer autumn beer. Honestly this is probably the best pumpkin beer that I've ever had. Damn fine stuff from a damn fine brewery.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,erikm25,3.63,"A: Heard this was out and went to grab a 4 pack. This pours an amber red and with a light brown tint. There is also a translucent warm orange hue. Relatively fluffy two finger head with slight lacing.  S: Spice, nutmeg, and peppers stick out. There is a noticeable pumpkin aroma but it is much more disguised then what I was anticipating. Even though the ABV is not that high it still brings a warm feeling to the nostrils. Overall, I was expecting something heavier on the sugar and pumpkin side.  T: The taste is similar to the smell. Spices upfront with the pumpkin taste hanging out in the background. I found it to be pretty decent but actually would have preferred more pumpkin and nutmeg blasting the taste buds. Those elements are there but tend to be more of a tease. Therefore, it takes some big swigs to get to them but it is well worth it. While caramel and malts are there, even coupled with a nice speck of cinnamon, it is an overall very light taste.  M: Light bodied and very smooth. Not quite as thick with pumpkin as I was expecting but still living up to the quality DFH has established.  D: This is a very drinkable beer. I would have liked something a little heavier, richer, and creamier. However, I will probably grab some more and throw on some Misfits or Samhain and celebrate the upcoming Halloween season. Compared to the couple others (of this genre I have tried) it is still a great beer that is well worth the time.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,bashiba,4,"Poured a nice dark amber with a touch of haze and a light and sticky tan head.  The smell has a light toasted malt nose with a touch of cinamon and pumpkin spice.  The taste is that of a nice solid amber ale with just a light touch of the pumpkin spices and flavors. Has a strong toasted malt backbone with nice hints of the pumpkin pie flavoring, but without being sweet. Has a nice touch of lemon and grassy hops giving it good balance.  The mouthfeel is fairly full bodied with a long dry finish.  Easily the best pumpkin beer I have gotten to try. The pumpkin flavors are present but don't make the beer not taste like beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,DeepSix,3.36,"Appearance is on par with an amber ale, not much head retention and pretty much no lacing.  Smell, wow never quite smelled a beer like this before, its spices are overpowering, can for sure smell the pumpkin spices.  The pumkin taste is no where near as overwhelming at the smell, a pretty thin mouthfeel as well, didn't expect much though.  Only one or two of these a night for me, couldn't drink the bar closed on these.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,tonytuffnuts,3.84,"Good pour, coppery body with orange hues and a modest off-white head that wanes to a laceless ring (surprising for all the sugar within). Smells wonderfully sweet, brown sugar, caramel malt with floral undertones. Pumpkin's naturally present at the front door, a nice yeast awaits at the back. The whole package reminds me of fresh-baked, warm pumkin pie (duh). The scents are all available in the taste, but the pumpkin pie-iness is upstaged by a yeastiness and a spicy, warming, alcohol finish. It's hard to decide if that's a bad thing, since it afterall grounds the offering as a beer rather than a fermented-fruit-drink. The carbonation is unobtrusive. The liquid itself is somewhat buttery. I always get excited by the delicious sound of a Pumpkin Ale, but my expectations are NEVER met. This comes as close as any to that flavorful imagined prototype.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,jeremyd365,4.34,"Alright so I had to even criticize this one because it really smells and tastes great. Pours a dark reddish-coppery color with no haze whatsoever. It smells and tastes just like a pumpkin pie and is delicious--no doubt about it. HOWEVER, I really wish that the thing would have a heavier body. It felt pretty thin in the mouth and going down, and I really like a holiday/spiced ale that you've gotta chew on. If they could do this without jeopardizing any other features of the brew, it would be perfect. Delicious nonetheless though and I'll definitely have it again!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,clayrock81,4.05,"Heavy carbonation led to a receeding two-finger head that sat on top of a transparent, auburn gold. I thought the actual pumpkin smell itself was mild, but there was a good sweet smell of cinnamon and brown sugar. A great pumpkin taste describes this beer, with a real smooth, creamy body. Mix in some cinnamon and nutmeg for a spicy kick and the sugar for some sweetness. Don't forget the spicy, crisp dry backbite from the hops that complemented this beer. My only problem was its lightness and great taste; I drank it too fast. A possible second to ST's Pumpking...still a grat pumpkin beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,Wench,4.33,"Copper with an orange glow, poured from the bottle into a chalice. Light lacing. Nice cinnamon aromatic, fresh vegetal hops in the nose. Nutmeg, cinnamon, squash and raisin follow through the palate, surprisingly low in carbonation, but the bite of the hops on the palate enough to keep the finish nice and fresh. One of my favorite fall seasonals.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,MMAJYK,3.92,"A- This brew pours bright orange, copper highlights, and transparent. No head at all after a medium pour.  S- Upon first smell, I pick up the brown sugar. The pumpkin follows it up closely in second place with the cinnamon-like spice that they brewed it with. I also sense some nutmeg and a very light, subtle hop aroma finishing it out.  T- This is one beer that I can honestly say follows the smell right to the tongue. Nutmeg, fall spices, brown sugar, and of course, pumpkin. I also taste a caramel malt along with some roastiness.  M- Low carbonation and medium in the mouth. Not this beer's high point by any stretch.  D- I was craving a beer that would make me feel like it is becoming fall outside. It is otherwise hard to believe that in the 90 degree weather we are having still. However, on a rainy day, this beer hit the spot. I enjoy it for what it is and would like to try to invent my own brew of this style someday soon.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,GilGarp,4.46,"Pours from a brown 12oz bottle into a pint glass. It has an exceptional orange-amber color, great clarity, and perfect fine white head.  Aroma is perhaps the only category that this beer lacks in. It is somewhat spicy and pumpkiny but nothing great.  The flavor is awesome, though. It's has spice in spades with cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove. The sweetness from the brown sugar is evident but it's nicely balanced with spices and hops. The pumpkin is also clearly present. Overall, it gives the impression of a great pumpkin pie without beeing overly sweet. This could easily be re-labeled a winter warmer. I can't think of another beer that I'd rather have for Halloween, Thanksgiving, or Christmas dinner (except, possibly Great Lakes Christmas Ale).  Mouthfeel is good, not overly carbonated and not too heavily spiced or hopped to have more than one. Drinkability is good too then.  A beautiful beer that's also great to drink - this may be my favorite Dogfish beer to date.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,Chugmonkey,3.83,"Wow. Bright orange/amberish color, big puffy/rocky white head. Absolutely stunning appearance.  Smell is exploding with a veritable plethora of spices. First sip makes you cringe and snaps your head back as your tongue gets assaulted by the spices. Then as you have a few more you get used to it and it gets really enjoying trying to pick out all the spice flavors. Pumpkin flavor, but mostly dominated by the spice.  A super satisfying beer, best pumpkin beer I've had by a long shot. I loved it. Should have got a sixer. Spices kind of take over and linger - one of these at a time is enough.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

The taste is great with a mix of malt and spices . The finish kind of lingures inviting another sip . The body is not as heavy as I thought it might be with the pumpkin in it but it is very smooth . An excellent 1st pumpkin beer of the year .,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,nrbw23,4.22,A- Pours a nice golden orange color with a tan colored head. Head has great retention and nice lacing.  S- Smells of tons of pumpkin and pie spices. Cinnamon and allspice along with a touch of nutmeg. Maybe a touch of brown sugar in there too.  T- Starts out really sweet and brown sugar like. The spices and pumpkin follow in and it really does taste like pumpkin pie. I couldn't pick up any hops and finishes with a nice spice touch.  M- Medium-light in body and carbonation seems to be about right on.  D- A great brew and easy to drink. The only thing that maybe holding this one back is its sweetness but it would be easy to drink one or two.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

S: Lots going on here, lots of bread malts, cinnamon, nutmeg, pumpkin, brown sugar, all-spice. A good mixture and combination.  T: The taste is very complex yet it works. Lots of brown sugar and spice. It really gives a spicy pumpkin taste, but not overly spicy.  M: A full bodied beer, which leaves a little spicy and bitter flavor on the palate.  D: A well balanced seasonal beer. If you enjoy pumpkin pie and pumpkin flavors, this is one of the best ale's I have had.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Smells heavily of spices, cloves, cinnamon, pumpkin, exactly like a kitchen on Thanksgiving Day. Mouthfeel is smooth, with a medium-body and plenty of carbonation. Taste does not leave pumpkin spices as an afterthought. While it is hopped more than I expected it to be, it does not overwhelm the pumpkin flavor, accompanied by hints of clove and cinnamon. Finishes with a kick that lets you know the hops - and pumpkin - are definitely in this brew.  This is the first pumpkin ale I have ever had, and I don't see how one could get much better. Definitely one of my new fall favorites, with high taste and high drinkability.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,kenito799,4.2,"12 oz bottle poured into a chalice.  Orangey amber brew with a smll tan head, little lacing. The bottle prompts us to search for allspice, cinnamon and nutmeg here. These are definitely identifiable in the aroma, with the overall spice impression reminding me of Chinese 5-spice powder, although star anise was not on the label. Baked pumkin bread, brown sugar round out the aroma. Pleasing autumn scents. The flavor showcases the spice mix well, and I swear I do realy taste pumpkin. The allspice and nutmeg do a great job stimulating the palate with a spicy tingle. Caramel flavor but not very sweet, with just enough hoppy bitterness in the finish to make this more drinakble than your standard holiday niche beer. This one is definitely a winner for holiday meals or with that pumpkin pie. Probably the best pumpkin beer I have had, good job.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,jbphoto88,4,"An amber orange slightly cloudy with a creamy soft head that fades to a light haze and soft collar. Right from the moment the cap comes off you can smell the spices.  Very autumn scented. The melding of pumpkin, brown sugar and nutmeg give a very fall festive nose. I think the temperature outside just dropped 15° in preparation for this beer. Dominate aromatic pumpkin pie scents with some sweet malts in the background.  A tasty brew. Not overly spiced but a smooth balance of pumpkin and other adjuncts. A sweet malt start with the pumpkin nutmeg playing second fiddle. The finish is powdery from the dry cinnamon. The tastes respect each other and give one another room to stretch their legs. Not one flavor dominates this beer.  A very palatable beer, but one that only seems right during the fall months. Festive nose and taste make a great Halloween beer. This one can get me in the spirit to decorate the house like a graveyard but more important it's a sign of the great fall and winter beers to come.

Pours a copper red color with good clarity and a small white head.  Aroma is pumpkin spice with a huge emphasis on the nutmeg. Other spice was detectable like cinnamon and there was a bit of hops.  Taste was pretty flat to me. Mostly wet hops and pumpkin spice. Not very good. There wasn't a good beer taste. It just didn't seem to have a backbone.  Mouthfeel was stingy and watery.

Small white head that disappears quickly.  Aroma is nutmeg, cinnamon, and brown sugar. Taste is much the same. Spicy, with a malty background with a hint of hop bitterness as it finishes. Has a sticky mouthfeel, but little lacing. Really does remind me of pumpkin pie.

Pours a deep, amberish colour with a thick head that disappeared quickly. The smell is the best part. Spicy, cinnamony, warm. It embodies the fall to me. The taste is much the same. Some people trying this with me found it to be too spicy and thought it was an odd flavour for a beer. I think it's great. Regardless of the slight bitterness, it goes down smooth.

Pours a brownish-orange, with somewhat slow head formation. Lots of big carbonation bubbles are visible. Spots of lacing here and there.  Smells more of spices than pumpkin. Nutmeg and cinnamon, predictably. Hint of creamy sweetness.  Taste follows suit more or less. Perhaps I was spoiled by Pumking, but I'm not getting a huge sense of pumpkin here. The blend of spices is nice. The hop profile is nice; probably Goldings. For a 7% beer, there's not a ton of outright maltiness. Some brown sugar sweetness, but spices overpower any caramel or toasty notes. This is where the beer loses some points for me. I'd like more sweetness. Finishes with a little spice, and slight herbal hop bitterness. Similarities to a brown ale are muted. Perhaps DFH is strictly mentioning the color, which is still off the mark.  No big complaints on feel. Medium-full.  Punkin is technically a good beer, but I'm not so sure I go back to it. Even though I could not taste much of the alcohol, it hit my by the end.

The beer is the color of a pumpkin (orange.. if you haven't seen a pumpkin) with a light white head. Aromas of pumpkin along with some light toasty malts. The hops kick in nicely in the flavor along with the- you guessed it- pumpkin, adding a little crispness and spicyness. The mouthfeel has a nice medium body. The alcohol isn't overly perceptible in the taste but after drinking half a bottle I could already feel it at work. The brown sugar offers a nice nutty complement to the pumpkin as well. This beer doesn't go overboard in any direction (ie pumpkin pieness) and I'd almost appreciate it if there was slightly less alcohol so I could drink more of them in sort of an Oktoberfesty/Fall kind of spirit, but overall was very pleased.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

10099,6260,roadhouse,4.23,"8/30/2019: it's been 11 years to the day since I first had this beer in the review below, and I have enjoyed it every year since. However, this year the spices are just overbearingly bitter and medicinal. This one seriously needs to mellow out. They shouldn't be releasing it this early if it's not aged properly if that is the case. Disappointed.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  Appears a lovely shade of orange with a three finger high creamy head that sinks down to one finger after a few minutes. Tons of tiny carbonation bubbles billowing up to the top make it very nice to look at. Lots of lace down the side of the glass.  Aroma is filled with lots of pumpkin and pie spices to go along with it. Cinnamon and allspice are the most prominent, with the nutmeg also noticable. A bit of sweet caramelly malt is noticable but it definitely takes a backseat to the spices. No hops to speak of.  Taste is just as good as the aroma. Starts off with a nice rich sweetness from the brown sugar but the spices and pumpkin quickly rush over it and makes it taste like a fresh pumpkin pie. Finishes with a bit of earthy hops for a nice touch to blend with the spice.  Mouthfeel is medium-light, very smooth drinking. Carbonation level seems appropriate.  This is only the second Pumpkin Ale that I have tried so far but it is very good. One of the better ones I've tried from DFH.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Pours an auburn, dark-copper hue with a decent-sized head that quickly receded and left no lacing at all... Smell: True-to-the style pumpkin aroma, rich with hints of allspice, nutmeg, and cloves... Taste: For a 7% Pumpkin brew, this one went down fairly easily with very little alcohol detected on the tongue... Thick, rich pumpkin flavor... The nutmeg and cinnamon are also noticeable... Great stuff from Dogfish... One of the better Pumpkin ales out there on the market... Definitely a step-above from your average...",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,SiriusAth,4,"Pours a light copper amber with a large 3 finger cap of just off-white foam, pretty good retention for the first few minutes then quickly sinking into a small cap just above the beer. Lacing is attractive but also doesn't last too long.  The nose is pumpkin and spice and everything nice. Cinnamon, allspice, pumpkin, and nutmeg jump right out, slightest whiff of cloves and some veiled sweet brown sugar notes. Reminds me of Autumn and Thanksgiving.  The taste echoes the nose closely; my tongue tingles from the spices while the brown sugar and malt make their presence known with a nice sweetness. Pumpkin dominates with the spices providing nice backing, and just the right amount of hop bitterness to keep the sugar in check. Pretty close to liquid pumpkin pie, just not as sweet. Finish is semi-dry but overwhelmingly so.  The bottle claims full-bodied, but I'd say medium is more appropriate. The spicing keeps it from being ultra-smooth, but it's in no way harsh, and it shows a respectable creaminess that comes through a bit more as the beer warms.  DFH punkin is easily one of the better pumpkin ales I've tried and leaves me wanting to have another. Some pumpkin beers strive for straight up pumpkin flavor, some for pumpkin pie, and this fits the latter quite well. Well done DFH!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Reminds me of a candle store/gift shop in the fall. Taste is quite spicy. I was expecting this to taste like carbonated pumpkin juice, but there really isn't a whole lot of pumpkin flavor jumping out at you. It's nice, spicy will a hint of pumpkin in the background. Pumpkin is much more noticeable in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is smooth. Drinkability is great. I wasn't sure if I was going to like this much, since I've had bad experiences with blueberry flavored beers. But this was a nice surprise. It's not an overwhelming pumpkin flavor.

Aroma is spot on - pumpkin and cinnamon with some sweetness. The taste is on the money too, again the pumpkin pulls through with the cinnamon, some nutmeg and brown sugar. The alcohol is extremely well-hidden. Smooth mouthfeel.

S: There was a medium-strong aromatic sense of pumpkin spices of nutmeg, dry pie crust and sweet brown sugar filling the nose.  T: The flavor is not as dominant or strong as the nose leads you to believe, which is a good thing. Nutmeg, cinnamon, pie crust and brown sugar are all here as well but more balanced and toned down which is a good thing. Theres a nice caramel and maltiness backing things up creating a rich, full palate.  M: smooth, medium-full and felt pretty decent per style.  D: Drinkability was fairly good per style considering its high ABV and spiced herb nature. Can drink one or two of these, but pretty pricey per four pack.

Taste: Initially spicy with a very sweet undertone. An almost roasted note dominates the flavor in the back of the mouth almost immediately after swallowing. Hops bitterness is noticable in the immediate finish. The beer might just be starting to go off, but overall it's still wonderful.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and finishes very clean.  Drinkability: 7.0% ABV can be dangerous, but this is a wonderfully enjoyable beer.  Upon post-drink consideration, I think this beer was going to be on the verge of going bad.

Aroma is pumpkin and the standard pumpkin spices, with a hint of brandy.  First sip reveals a surprisingly nice mesh of malt and pumpkin flavors, some of that spice towards the back and an almost salty quality, as if I'd just taken a bite of buttered yams. Nice clean finish with absolutely no turn-off aftertaste. In fact the flavors linger and continue develop on the palate well after the glass has been set down. Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation.

Depth and complexity that I havent come to expect from pumpking beers. Bold mineral based richness up front with a nice hop feel to balance. Slightly carmalized malt teams with the spicey pumpkin tones that is present throughout this beer. The mouthfeel is a rich raw pumpkin and spicey veggie feel.

Less ""fake"" or artificial smelling than other pumpkin brews. T: Medium bodied, creamy, with high carbonation. Like the smell, it tastes like pumpkin pie in a glass, but not in a bad way. Strong malt body, biscuit like and slightly dry. I'm a little late in reviewing this beer and it isn't nearly as good as it was fresh so I'm not letting that affect my score. This was slightly more sweet and less dry fresh. Still a good beer, but not for sitting around.

Taste was dry, very lightly flavored of standard pumpkin pie flavor, with noticeable alcohol present. Why the fuck make this 7% so you can taste the alcohol, and leave the base so weak, and mildly flavored? Christ. Not even as good as the Shipyard pumpkin beer which I hear is simply their summer beer with pumpkin spice added. This was a huge disappointment coming from DFH when they usually at least put out some creative, good beers.

The pumpkin is present, and quite enjoyable. Nice spices, nutmeg is there. The whole time i was drinking it, i was thinking of egg nog. This is my first pumpkin ale, and its maybe a little late in the season, but i enjoyed it, and wish that i had gotten some when it was still available.

Living in Michigan and loving to grill and be outside as much as possible, the fall is the last hurrah to be outside before massive amounts of snow set in. Fall also brings with it a plethora of seasonal beers including pumpkin beers. I've had many pumpkin beers and have been disappointed with each of them, however, this one is a different story. The clear pumpkin color of the ale coupled with the intense pumpkin pie aroma is a world apart from other pumpkin brews. The taste is complex - spicy, sweet, and and roasted like a piece of pumpkin pie. The mouthfeel is well carbonated and well suited to this style.

Just a standard malt body, slight hint of cinnamon and nutmeg, moderate hop bitterness, with pumpkin and alcohol in the finish.  Mouthfeel: The body is on the thin side with thin mouthfeel.

Nose is spicy, lightly boozy, and lightly tangy-sweet; inclusion of brown sugar is evident. My impressions on the first sip are of a sweet, smooth, and moderately full-bodied brew. Punchy . . . definitely wears its 7% with style. Light notes of cherry and angelfood cake, and even a lightly-spiced 'plain cake donut' - very nice. Mouthfeel is smooth and lightly tangy, lightly warming from the higher alcohol, and with remarkably good drinkability. Leans toward a dessert beer but I could easily knock back a few of these. This is the biggest Pumpkin brew (ale or otherwise) I've ever sampled, and yet it has remarkable balance, even to the point of a drier finish than I'd first expected.

The pumpkin and spice taste is really upfront in this medium body brew when it hits the mouth. The cinnamon lingers a bit when the malt kicks in and everything finishes with a dry & hoppy bitterness. The taste of alcohol is pretty much all over it from start to finish. Not too overbearing but there's no denying that it's there. The better half said she liked it but had her thinking that someone tipped a little bit of a nut brown ale into the pie batter.

Obviously, you have your spice, again with nutmeg and clove, but maybe some cinnamon in there, plenty of sweet caramel malts, but also a tangy, dry finish to provide the slightest bit of bitterness at the end. I'm a big fan of pumpkin ales, I always look forward to the fall, and I think this is one of my favorite examples of the style.

Drank from my Laughing Dog pint glass.  Appearance- Pours a super clear reddish orange with a bright white head. Very nice cap and collar that leaves very little lacing. Surprisingly light compaired to other brews of this type. Smell- Lots of pumpkin in this one. More pumpkin in the nose than the other similar brews Ive had. Very spicy as well with lots of cinnamon, nutmeg and clove. Pumpkin pie in a bottle. Taste- This one is a bit different than the other Pumpkin Ales Ive had. Starts with a bit of pumpkin that quickly leaves. Its taken over by a sweet toffee/brown sugar that quickly gets cloying. A bit of a lingering cinnamon but the spice is definitely more present in the nose. The alcohol is covered well though. Mouthfeel- Somewhere between medium and full body with a slick feel and aggressive carbonation. Drinkability- I had big hopes for this one but its not the best Pumpkin Ale Ive had. Its tasty but a bit cloying and I really wish there was more spice in the taste. The nose was fantastic though and I wish it tasted like it smelled.

10099,6260,BuckSpin,3.97,"Presentation: 12oz bottle (bottled on date of 8/10/07) in a Shaker pint  Poured silent, straight, a little syrupy. Sweet, spicy nose, definitely ripe with a ""Red Hots""-esque cinnamon, soft clove. Malts are caramelized & have a mild brown sugar quality that grow as it warms and even takes on a mild bread quality. What head there was (a pencil's worth of very loose dull ivory foam) faded almost immediately to a small, transparent floater and broken edge ring, even with a vigorous vertical pour aimed at accentuating this aspect. Barely hazed, its a sharp copper-orange hue that has some nice luster.  Nice balance between sharp pie spices like cinnamon, clove, ginger, allspice, nutmeg and sweet caramelized malts that do (like the label says) have a brown sugar aspect to them. The spices have a subtle heat that warms the mouth & awakens the tongue and taste receptors, much like zesty but not spicy food does. Its actually quite sharp with an underlying, background roundness & fullness. The spices are a searing lead guitar, the malts a steady bass that, when combined, have a nice, upward crescendo to the palate. This would definitely be nice on a brisk autumn day.  A semi-dry aspect on the palate picks up on the palate and continues to build that light heat and even more angular quality overtop those sweet, rich, soft malts. The alcohol barely kicks in as well, and the overall effect is mouth being scrubbed dryly warm, again all over top that steady & round sweet malt back beat. It finishes a little softer & duller, coming downhill from that peak on the palate, but still spiced. The aftertaste is very pleasing - subtly burnt caramel, mild pie spices, a little chewy, mouth alive & softly aglow.  A very nice Pumpkin Ale. Not the prettiest or best I've had, but a very nice one. This would be a great sipper during the chill of Autumn as well as would be nice with some cheddar or some lively Mediterranean rim fare. I'd definitely make this a part of my Autumnal beer enjoyment. Definitely recommended if you like a nice spiced ale.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

10099,6260,GFSchwab,4.67,"The apperance was a calm brown with a small level of head, however that small ammount of head carries a great flavor and aroma, and stuck with the beer until I finished it. The smell was a deep and enveloping experience (as pretentious as a beer review can get) with a heavy aroma of pumpkin pie, and definitley notes of cinamon. Although the spices used to define this ale as pumpkin commanded the aroma, the alcohol content and fleting level of hops could be detected.  The taste follwed the nose of the beer judiciously with carmel malts blending perfectly with the brown sugar and pumkin that was used in this ale. The 7.0% bite of the alcohol came along with the hops as a faint aftertaste bringing the beer all the way home. The pumkin taste resided on my pallette long after the beer was done, and alothough it was quite a heavy and layered beer, I would'nt hesitate to have one or two more.

It looked quite clean.  S- Definite pumpkin spice and vegetal tones. I initially picked up nutmeg and allspice and something like ginger too. On further sniffs, there were bready/biscuit malt notes.  T- Not as ""in your face"" as some from the style. It keeps the traditional beer qualities. It had a bready backbone with spice to enhance flavor, not overwhelm it. The light hop finish leaves a clean taste.  M- Medium feel with light carbonation.  D- Due to subtle characteristics, it's an easier drinker than many other pumpkin brews.  Overall- Though I like some overly-spiced versions of the style, this one was a pleasant surprise.

Aroma is very spicey. Almost too spicey as the pumpkin aroma is subtle but it's still there.  Taste is once again frontloaded with spices and sweetness. Much like the aroma, the pumpkin taste gets overloaded and seems barely detectable on some sips. Light hoppiness and more than I care for hotness (especially as it warms) in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and seems fairly thick for a Pumpkin Ale.  The Punkin' Ale seems to be one of those beers that I try and try with each year to love and it just never happens. Just way too over spiced with not enough pumpkin and a unnecessaryly high 7% ABV make this a one time a fall beer for me. If they want to keep the high ABV, they should make this an Imperial style and ramp up the flavor too.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

There's some good body and medium carbonation noticeable.  S: Smells like pumpkin mash, some sugary sweetness, and acidic alcohol. Not an overpowering spicy odor, merely faint and intriguing for a pumpkin ale.  T: Tastes of a sweet, molasses based brown ale with some pumpkin flavoring and allspice blended in with it. The hop content is relatively low, but noticeable. The pumpkin taste is more subtle, letting the other sweet flavors and brown ale characteristics to shine through.  M: Mouthfeel is medium bodied; not necessarily thirst quenching, as I'm assuming the beer was meant to be enjoyed on cool fall evenings or at the witching hour, not chugged down.  D: I could easily sip the whole 4-pack of this stuff over the course of a few hours, that's how smooth and tasty it is as a pumpkin ale.  Another excellent fall installment from the brewers at Dogfish Head. I had a chance to sample some of the first batches this summer at the Milton brewery, but it never tasted better as it does at the end of the line and out of my fridge on this Halloween night.

I could only pick out the pumpkin and allspice, that was all. i expect the brown sugar is now the alcohol flavor i taste, but i think it was lacking the cinnamon and nutmeg. i was hoping it would be more ""pumpkin pie"" like but it was not.  it was light, and refreshing, more so than i expected for a fall/winter seasonal beer. was quite carbonated as well.  if you are a big fan of pumpkin and allspice im sure you could session this beer, but i think it needs more of a cinnamon and nutmeg flavor to be a fall/winter choice for me.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Nice dark brown color, thin tan foam, good retention and left thin lacing. Smell had hint of brown sugar and molasses, like a brown ale, but I had problems picking up any other spice or pumpkin. This is a subtle pumpkin beer, and there is not the overwelming 'pumpkin pie' taste or smell. A solid beer with a hoppy character and a very subtle pumpkin taste and aroma. Very tastey and well balanced. Slightly thin body, but that makes it easy to drink, a great seasonal/sessional enjoyed in the fresh air.

Being somewhat pumpkin obsessed, the fall is not the same without pumpkin pie, soup, bread, coffee, and last but definitely not least, pumpkin beer. So I really enjoy pumpkin, and with pumpkin beer, if it is good I can drink this a my session for the night. throw in the fact that I enjoy hops as well, well I state my case for this beer as the standard punkin for me, the best pumpkin beer out there, hands down, it still outlasts the competion after now five falls of head to head tasting. So to the beer. Good color, nice dark brown sugar color with decent glass lacing. hints of brown sugar, molassess and cloves in the nose. The beer, folks, is nuanced. It will not give you the pumpkin pie effect, more the effect is a good hoppy ale giving credence to the season and time. The pumpkin taste as well as aroma is subtle and is meant to be subtle to compliment the hops character. I find that this exudes a great balanace to this beer. I wonder what the hops are? still have not been able to figure that out because that is subtle as well but definitely presistant present. Look at this beer as a hopped brown ale with pumpkin overtones that. i feel, are consistenlty present from first sip through taste and finish. If you can approach that way and like hops, you will defintely enjoy this beer. This is the perfect beer to enjoy raking leaves or chopping wood.

T: This is my favorite pumpkin beer for a reason. This is exceptionally balanced, the actual pumpkin flavor meshing nicely with the spices. I don't even like pumpkin pie that much, in part because I wish it tasted more like this. Can we make a pumpkin ale pie instead?  M: Actually wish this was just a touch thicker.  D: Yummy, but.

The aromas are of your typical spices, nutmeg, cinnamon, brown sugar and some caramel. The taste is very smooth, again no one flavor is really sticking out but seems to have a nice marriage of flavors. Those flavors are similar to the aroma but I think a malty caramel backbone sticks out. The spices seem to be nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon, and pumpkin flavors.

There is nothing that blows me away, but it is good.  T- Some pumpkin and spices with some earthiness. The alcohol is ever so slightly apparent. Nothing really comes in and steals the show flavor wise, it is just a really well balanced pumpkin ale.

Somewhat unimpressive, as is the case with the aroma. Nose detects a light, spritzy blend of wheat, brown sugar, biscuity malts, and a pinch of cinnamon. Nothing too memorable. When I smell a pumpkin ale, I want to smell the pumpkin, the nutmeg, the cinnamon. This was pretty weak.  The taste perked me up a bit, as this ""punk"" hit fairly hard for its style with a sweet, spicey body with a touch of alcohol, bitter hops, and lots of spice. The mouthfeel was dry, salty, and crisp across the palate with a nice bitter bite on the finish. It begins to really smooth out once the carbonation level drops.

10099,6260,MiguelMandingo,3.72,"This brew isn't that bad. I was a little leery about buying another pumpkin ale after sampling my first (the Blue Moon Pumpking Ale), but this is a really good beer.  Appearance - it pours a transparent caramel honey color. It produced a quickly dissipating, frothy, off-white, 2 finger head. No lacing to speak of. The head becomes a thin halo around the perimeter of the glass, and then dissipates to nothing by the end of the brew.  Smell - It has a very spicy nose. I can smell the slightest hint of pumpkin and bready malt, and that is quickly overwhelmed by allspice and nutmeg. There is cinnamon hidden in there as well. The allspice smell is way too dominating for my taste.  Taste - Wow. This tastes way better than I expected. The pumpkin and cinnamon are a little more pronounced in the flavor than they are in the scent. The allspice and nutmeg are definitely present but slightly subdued. I can definitely detect hops in the backend of the flavor, lingering in the aftertaste, while the bready malt is more present in the initial taste . Pretty complex flavor, actually. This would pair up with pumpkin bread better than it would pumpkin pie, IMO.  Mouthfeel - Light/medium bodied. Feels a little thin to due lower level of carbonation. I would have enjoyed a little bit more, personally. All that said, it was still crisp and pretty smooth going down.  Drinkability - I personally don't enjoy having pumpkin ales very frequently, but I did like this one the best of those that I have sampled thus far. I don't think I could enjoy more than one of these during the course of the day.  This is the best pumpkin ale I have had yet. I had almost given up on this style... almost.

It pours with a solid, smooth layer of whitish head that recedes to leave a a thin film atop the beer. Medium amount of carbonation visible. Spotty and thin lacing. S: This beer sports a rather crisp, practically lagery smell. Subtle hint of spice, and some more noticeable notes of grains and earthy malts. As the beer warms, a tiny sweetness emerges in the nose. T: Clean taste up front that is a mix of grassy and woody tastes with a hint of malty sweetness. This maltiness gains strength in the middle, and gives way to a slightly spicy taste that is reminiscent of seasoned roasted vegetables, most notably pumpkin, of course. The finish has a taste of sugars and spice and is really quite nice. M: Fairly smooth and clean throughout, but it's a bit watery, especially in the middle. The finish has a tiny drying feel, and an alcohol tingle shows up after the beer warms a bit. D: Not too bad. There isn't an overwhelming pumpkin flavor/spiciness to this beer, so it's manageable. The dryish finish is the only thing that makes this tough to swallow. Overall, not too shabby for a pumpkin ale.

T: Very much in the style of a marzen, with a varied yet gentle malt profile. Toward the finish, the spices become evident, and add a great accent to the beer. Hoppy and pumpkin vegetable kick come in the aftertaste, and while not being incredibly amazing, does fit the bill.  M: Carbonation is a great balance of crispness and medium body, which suits this beer well. Mostly a refreshing smoothness throughout.

A one finger head formed on the pour and quickly receded to hardly a skimming. Appearance isn't bad but nothing impressive.  This beer has a big helping of spices, unfortuanately without much pumpkin. According to the bottle there's brown sugar, allspice, cinnamon, and nutmeg. The allspice and nutmeg are by far the two most dominant aromas (as it warms further the brown sugar comes through). Even though it's missing the depth the spices present do smell good.  There's a nice flash of toasty, nutty malts upfront that gives way to the spicing. The spicing comes across with the nutmeg and allspice again before turning back to the base on the swallow. The base is pretty tasty and the spicing makes it unique. There profile does evolve as the beer warms.  Medium bodied with a slightly syrupy mouthfeel. Surprisingly the mouthfeel seems to work well with the spicing. Sluggish carbonation lets this beer work through letting the spices do their thing.  Good beer but the drinkability is hurt (in my opinion) by the spicing. There aren't many spiced beers I could drink more than one or two in a sitting.  Solid beer from Dogfish Head. The longer this one sits out of the fridge the better it smells and tastes. I'd guess it's between 52-55 right now and it's tasting pretty good.

Alluring, although it gets a bit rich as it warms.  The taste is very nice. Overall, this tastes a lot like a pumpkin dubbel to me, which is awesome! First time I had this, I thought it was fine, but am more impressed with this second bottle. The spices are present, but their fairly well balanced by the malt and pumpkin. Not sure if there is any spice from the yeast, but there's a fair amount of complexity, with light phenols and clean fusels on the finish. Funny, I've never much cared for pumpkin beers, but the last two I've had (this and Elysian) are really good.  The mouthfeel is on the thicker side, with a slight crispness.

Not overly sweet, one or two would be my limit due to the spice. One of the better pumpkin ales that's more widely available.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,BeerTruth,3.15,"12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass.  Pours a rusty copper hue with a one finger white head that quickly dies down to just about nothing. No stickiness or lacing any where to speak of. Smell is of cinnamon and not enought pumpking. Lots of clove and nutmeg as well. I think the spices are a bit over the top and lack the pumpkin smell. Taste starts with an interesting creamy hop flavor with all the spices mentioned earlier. I really enjoy the hoppiness to this beer, but the flavors seem too artificial to me and a bit overpowering. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation, a bit too much actually. Just had the Pumpking from Southern Tier and Punkin' doesnt even compare to it. I put a 22 oz. Pumpking down easier than a 12 oz. Punkin'. This one is just kind of ""meh"" for me.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,PhxHorn,4.04,"Poured from a bottle into a pilsner glass. Not much head, but the beer was a darker orange than some pumpkin beers I've had.  The smell was intense--pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg.  Tasted just like it smelled, with a bit more fizz than I expected. Not a bad thing, but the mouthfeel reminded me a bit of orange soda. I don't know that I'd want to drink more than one of these at a time, but it's a fine fall/winter ale.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,blitz134,3.92,"Picked this up tonight. I haven't had too many pumpkin beers in the past, but I've been interested in branching out from my usual goto styles.  Truthfully I dont know what pumpkins smell like, maybe I do...just a fair warning for this review, haha...  Clear, copper, orange body. Small, just off white head to start with that was a bit fizzy and reduced down to a ring around the glass with floating patches of bubbles. Lots of carbonation here, just no sticking power.  Has what I would say smells like pumpkin but with some hints of toasted malts underneath. Definate spice characters come out. Smells like the label says really with nutmeg and cinnamon and allspice, fairly evenly balanced.  Nice toasty malt base is the main thing that comes through here. A hint of pumpkins and then the spices again, especially after the swallow and the following breaths. Some hints of brown sugar linger with the faintest wisps of alcohol.  Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but it might actually be reduced some by the carbonation which adds a touch of pricklyness (if that is a word). Flavor lingers though, mostly the malty side, but the spices are there, just not as predominant.  Overall this is a pretty good beer. Not much sign of the 7% ABV, the aftertaste is nice toasted malts instead of some overpowering spices. Pretty easy to drink actually, I could see having a few of these and then the alcohol giving you a kick.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,liquidnoise,2.2,"A few years ago, a friend got me interested in pumpkin ales after telling me he drank one and it tasted just like pumpkin pie. Since then, out of all the seasonal beer styles I've probably tried more pumpkin ales than any other in search of this mystical liquified pumpkin pie, and each time I am let down.  This one was unique with respect to others I've tried, basically because of the high alcohol content and the prominence of alcohol in the flavor. Hardly any ""pumpkin"" was recognizable, and the alcohol stood out so much it felt like I was drinking hard liquor at times.  Drinkability was low, I had to take my time.  Not a very enjoyable pumpkin ale, I'll pass on this in the future.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

10099,6260,PittBeerGirl,3.45,A-Dark orange/brown body that has a large foamy off-white head. Body is slightly translucent and head settles to a nice 1-finger and has great retention. Plenty of lacing is left behind in the glass.  S-This pumpkin ale has a big whiff of pumpkins upfront-go figure. A nice blend of spices such as cinnamon and nutmeg in the background.  T&M- Similar to the smell but the spices are pretty subdued and its just a big taste of pumpkin. Nice malt and brown sugar backing. Finish is somewhat astringent with alcohol but a big pumpkin spice flavor also lingers. Low to medium carbonation and astringency makes this one not too easy to swallow.  D- Decent characteristics but the pumpkin and alcohol become too much to drink too fast. This is only 7% ABV and it has the presence of one 10%+. Still looking foreward to other pumpkin ales but I doubt I will have this one again.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

I slightly pick up some brown sugar as well.  Taste is wonderfully complex and very pleasant. The best tasting pumpkin ale that I've ever had.  Nice mouthfeel.  This beer is wonderfully brewed. A lot of spices in this brew. A lot going on. I really enjoyed this beer, but I couldn't make a session of this. The 7% abv isn't noticeable, but the complex spicing makes this beer not ideal for sessions.

Aroma is full of all-spice and nutmeg, sweet malt and pumpkin, with not much in the line of hops.  The spice in the taste is a bit scaled back, but very evident nonetheless. there is more sweet maltiness and even a bit of ripe dark fruit. Finish is warm with alcohol, but does not linger terribly long.  Medium bodied, nicely carbonated, it's a hearty Fall ale but does not fill you up by any means. Nice drinkable seasonal from DFH!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,BBM,4.37,"Poured a crisp, clean orange into the glass, with a half-inch white head. There was a distinct ginger and allspice smell in the nose, along with burnt sugars.  This is one of the more complex pumpkin ales I've tried, with a toasted (burnt even) malt flavor up front, along with pumpkin pie spices, including cinnamon, allspice, ginger, and nutmeg, and followed up by the faint flavor of pumpkin/squash. There's even a hint of alcohol in the finish as the beer warms. Dogfish Head does an excellent job of balancing all these flavors, to the point where one doesn't dominate. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and slightly chewy. Even at a higher percent, this is a great beer to session on a nice fall night or with an autumn meal.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,PBRstreetgang,4.37,"Pours a clear tawny bronze hue, with an off-white foamy two finger head. Good retention produces thick wisps of stubborn lace. You can smell the pumpkin, ginger and cinnamon from a few feet away, and the allspice, nutmeg and toasted malt are obvious as well, with faint caramel in the background. Deeply toasted pale malt and medium crystal upon first sip- deliciously sweet with a hint of tang like muscavado or turbinado ester. A suggestion of dextrin and good dose of vegetal/squash taste transforms into a traditional pumpkin pie flavor complete with slightly peppery fresh ginger, spicy cinnamon, some faint clove and heavy allspice character. The aftertaste is a gradual fading of the malt and spice that reveals a soft but balancing woody english hop flavor and bitterness that balances the remaining malt and pairs nicely with the spices. Most Pumpkin beers I have tried are either light and overly spiced or have a well-rounded flavor but very mild in charatcer overall; this results in a poor mouthfeel, but Dogfish Head has matched a medium-body/residual sugar profile with medium-light carbonation that lifts the sweetness from the toungue in conjunction with the balancing spices/hops. The finish is also gentle and smooth but saturated with complex flavor. This beer really tastes like a slice of pumkin pie dunked in a hearty Northern English Brown ale and is far and away the best Pumpkin ale I have tried to date.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Aromas of pumpkin and spices such as clove, cinnamon are certainly present. The taste is pretty much the same as the smell. Flavors of pumpkin, brown sugar and the aforementioned spices are present along with some malt undertones and a slights hint of hops. A good taste, but not anything super great here.

The flavors are sharp and dark: pumpkin, the bread again, pie spices. Mouthfeel is bright and effervescent. A tad watery, but not bad.

Much more of a pumpkin taste than I anticipated from the smell. But, it's very good. Hands down the best pumpkin beer I've had. It is sweet and malty. Corriander and clove give it a spicy kick.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's light to medium bodied. Carbonation is excellent. 7% abv is perfect for this beer. Drinkability is good. I'd probably drink two, but no more.

My girlfriend however loves them, and in trying many samples from many breweries, we've come to believe Punkin' Ale from DFH is by far the best. Built on a foundation of a rich brown ale and with 7%abv strength this is serious beer. Some brewers use only pumpkin and others use only pumpkin spices(nutmeg,cinnimon, brown sugar). DFH uses both in great quantity for the ultimate flavor and aroma of pumpkin pie. I also love the bright orange 4-pack.

D: Im good for 3 or 4 of these in a sitting, until i remember that the ABV is a little higher than normal.

The spices that I can pick out are nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, and ginger. Underneath the spices I can detect some faint malt and pumpkin aromas. Tastes much like pumpkin pie. The spices come on a bit strong at first but soon yield to a nice combination of malts, brown sugar, and pumpkin, with malts being dominant. Towards the finish I get just a bit of alcohol astringency coming through, not overwhelming and I can't quite pick it up every time but its definitely there. The more of this I drink the more the spices make a comeback in the finish. Good mouthfeel, nice medium-ish body with low-moderate carbonation. Drinkability is average. I think one of these in a night is enough for me. The dominant spice flavors that only become more intense and ever-present as I drink this beer deter me from having another.

D: This beer is ok, but I would not say it was that drinkable. A lot of spices, especially nutmeg, eventually made me feel kind of sick and dizzy (and this was my first beer of the night!). The spices definitely got to me, and I'd be surprised if anyone could pound a bunch of these in a row.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,Slatetank,4.15,"Served cold in a nonic at the Rehobeth brewpub. A - a dark copper/ light caramel brown w/ a cream colored head.. The head is small and leaves a thin film of lace.  S - Potent odors of spice. Pumpkin pie blend of ginger clove and brown sugar scents. A nutmeg and cinnamon aroma that is very aromatic greets the nostrils.  M - Full feel -malty w/ spicy finish. Very dense when held in the mouth, a nice dose of pumpkin vege effect.  T - Great flavors abound w/ sweet pie-like pumpkin. Nutty and spiced w/ a buttery malty flavor. Lots of spice in the taste, cinnamon and ginger seem to be the dominant flavors. Deep malts and brown sugar sweetness mark the taste as it finishes sweet.  D - Very tasty, but a bit much for more than 2 or 3 I would say. The combination of the spices and sweetness make it not something you would want a session of. I enjoyed 2 pints and it was worthy of that in one sitting. A great example of the Pumpkin ale style. Dogfish head doesn't shy away from a true full pumpkin pie like flavor. Not just a spiced ale - this is the real deal.

10099,6260,number1bum,3.58,"Pours an copper/orange color, crystal clear, with about an inch of off-white head. A few stray bubbles rise to the surface and the head retains a thin lace.  Smell is primarily spices, particularly nutmeg and cinnamon, along with a hint of alcohol.  Taste also has plenty of pumpkin and spice, but they don't overpower. There is a nice biscuity malt flavor, just a little bit of sweetness and then a bit of hop bitterness. Aftertaste is more spices than pumpkin, and it's almost like Captain Morgan's spiced rum. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and it's very smooth and has a nice creaminess.  This is one of the better pumpkin ale that I've had to date, and it's a nice treat for the fall. Interestingly, I think this beer is best enjoyed on its own rather than trying to pair it with something similarly spiced. I've tried it both with a pumpkin chili that I made using the beer as an ingredient, as well as with an apple pumpkin muffin and some apple crisp, and I don't think there is enough malt sweetness in the brew to stand up to a sweeter, spiced food.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

The appearance was average too . Clear with a small head that did not last long with very little lacing . For flavor , the brew was as weak as the aroma . It was a bit watery and a tad bitter .

10099,6260,CWiggins,3.95,"Ah, it's still 100 degrees outside, but the pumpkin beers are beginning to roll into town. I've seen Blue Moon's Harvest Moon, Brooklyn's Post Road, and Dogfish Head's Punkin' Ale in Durham just this week. I really wish they would wait until October (or at least late September) to release these beers; much of the supply may be depleted before the appropriate season. I plan on tasting my way through several pumplin beers this year; Dogfish Head's just happens to have crossed my path first.  It pours a dark copper, and leaves an ecru head that begins pretty thick but dissipates quickly, leaving only a thin lacing around the perimeter of the glass. Nutmeg, cinnamon, and allspice dominate the aroma, although one can detect some malts and hops if close attention is paid. This one's aroma sure is impressive. One might expect the flavor to be rather sweet, but it's surprisingly malty, with pumpkin and spice accents arriving in the middle. The finish is quite hoppy, and this is where the alcohol is also felt. Hops lingers during the aftertaste, while the spice and pumpkin continue to be present.  This is a great pumpkin ale. It's not sweet; pumpkin and spices dominate, while malts and hops are certainly blended well. I recall that of all the pumpkin ales I tried last year, this was my favorite. We'll see how that turns out!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Picked up a case at the local Beer Distributor where they screwed up the price and gave it to me for $28 instead of $38. As Borat says,""Is Niiiiccee!!""  A- One finger head goes away quickly, within seconds. Orange in color with lots up bubbles.  S- Sweet malts with pumpkin hints. Nutmeg and cinnamon also float into my nose. Smells nice.  T- Malty with lots of pumpkin. Alcohol definitely is strong towards finish. Hops and nutmeg also are prevelent. Very different but real nice. Almost like drinking a pumpkin pie.  M- Highly carbonated, yet very thick and syupy. Makes throat tickle and numb which I really like. Great.  D- The alcohol in this is very noticeable. I know some don't like that, but I actually do. Unfortunately, it is 85 degress outside. This would go great on a cool October night while taking the kids around Trick-Or-Treating.

This really does taste like a pumpkin pie in a glass. Starts off with a nice peppery pumpkin flavor, followed by the sweet brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg flavors.

Nice looking beer- good head and head retention, nice clarity and dark cherry oak colour. Smell is good and spicy- nutmeg and cinamon. Taste- the spice in the nose is there in spades in flavour and then some. Very spicy- probably heaviest spiced beer I've had to date. Almost seems like it would be better mulled than cold. I thought this would have lost some of its bite considering its age, but its holding up well. I have to say, its one of the more enjoyable DFH beers I've head (esp. compared to black and blue). It just needs a spoonful of coolwhip on the top and its pumpkin pie in the glass. Carbonation is appropriate and the finish is quite good.

S - Probably the best thing about this fine beer is the smell of freshly baked pumpkin bread -- rich spices: nutmeg, cloves, cinnamon a very lighy spicy hoppiness overpowering a malt base. Only thing missing from mom's pumpkin bread's a bit of yeastiness.  T- All of those above flavors though not quite as rich as the smell might indicate. Malty smooth sweetness gives it a nice round character.  M - Slightly creamy coats the inside of the mouth well, not heavy which is a surprise with all those spice odors.  D- Very drinkable.

Well, that takes the guessing out of the spice category. 7% abv., packaged in 07, and cap lists a $10.49 price tag from Halls.  Aroma: Spices are at a nice firm level, and are all saying pumpkin pie and Christmas.  Appearance: A clear orange amber glass holds a scant cover and gives only wisps of lacing.  Flavor: Spices are the main focus, nutmeg being pretty firm, but allspice gives it some range. There is a definite pumpkin aspect to the beer which is what its all about, right?   Mouthfeel: Nice creamy texture despite the carbonation being a bit too high, leaving it a bit fizzy. A bit oily in the finish which gives a long finish.

Smell is clove and nutmeg, which overrulle all the other potential spice smells. The brown sugar is a nice combination with the spices. The pumpkin is adding a vegetable smell, but this isn't quite the right subscription for it. Actually it is just the way a pumpkin pie smells.  Taste is slightly bitter with the spiciness of the clove and nutmeg upfront. The brown sugar is on top of that and adds a nice home-made caramel and toffee taste. Then the pumpkin taste is coming out and this is a taste that is not a 100% appealing to me. It reminds me of overripe fruit and half-rotten apples.

Ive enjoyed a lot of Dogfish Heads over the top (or, if youre like me, appropriately big) ales before, and I even got to sample a newly-brewed batch of this years Punkin Ale during an end-of-summer visit to their brewery. So keep these predilections in mind as you read; I was looking forward to this beer.  So lets begin with appearance: it all begins with a smooth, fizzy, carbonated pour. Bubbles fizz up rapidly like a soft drink; even two minutes after the pour, a steady stream of bubbles was quietly frothing to the surface. A light orange and brown color, pleasant and warm, never too dark but just dark enough in the middle of my mug to give it a nice opacity. A light foamy head disappeared very quickly. The cozy copper color is very inviting.  Smell is strong: pumpkin, of course, but also sugar, spices. Not very strong, but pleasant; a lot to take in, but it doesnt seep out of the mug and grab you, it waits for you to get close. And now, to sip, perchance to taste   The first sip is strong and tasty; definitely a pumpkin beer. The sweet, well-balanced taste hits you right away, and the cold beer has a crisp and flavorful finish. A great first sip, just strong enough to make me perk up and want to savor the rest of this beer.  Mouthfeel is good: sharp, flavorful, upfront tastes of pumpkin and nutmeg, more subtle tastes that linger a bit, cinnamon and some of the other spices. A good complement of strong tastes at first with some more nuanced flavors coming in to finish up the job.  I am finding this very sippable, the flavors are nice and crisp, spicy and warm, but not heavy. Putting my nose deep into the mug, and getting a nice strong whiff of those spicy, seasonal smells, heightens the taste and really makes this a tasty drink.  Halfway though this beer, Im really enjoying it. Its quite sippable, its tasty and full of flavor and aroma. This is a great slow drink on a chilly winter afternoon. I think the alcohol is becoming more pronounced, toward the end, and its a bit distracting. Its been a flavorful and tasty ride up till this point, and the heavier alcohol taste is somewhat disappointing. But the pumpkin is still there, its well-balanced, but Dogfish Head wisely lets some of the other flavors take the stage and they really supplement each other especially well.  Ive never had a pumpkin ale before, but this one was tasty. The alcohol crept up slowly toward the end, so I dont know quite how many I could enjoy in one sitting. Its easily a fun, enjoyable single, but I could see pairing this with some good food and having a couple. I enjoyed it and would easily enjoy another!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

The smell of spices was sort of weak compare to some other pumpkin ale's. Upon tasting this ale, spices was evident on the palate. There was nutmeg, pumpkin, a touch of all-spice and cinnimon.

As for the pumpkin aromawise, it's a no-show.  Taste: Light toffee sweetness upfront with a fair amount of nutmeg and especially cinnamon, which provides a nice spicy bitterness. Where have all the pumpkins gone?  This is a pumpkin ale, if I remember correctly. Sadly, you hardly get a true sense of any pumpkin in this brew.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied, with an ample carbonation that comes across as fizzy. Too fizzy, really.  Drinkability: The pumpkin flavor was subtle to the point of being absent. Sure, there's plenty of spices, but the missing pumpkin flavor was a disappointment, and made for an uninteresting beer.

There is a suprising amount of lacing for a pumpkin ale. The body displays excellent clarity in orange and amber hues.  The nose is pronounced with a delicious pumpkin ale aroma. There is a higher amount of allspice and cinnamon compared to many others. Vanilla smells help to soften some of the spiciness. Nutmeg presence is very strong.  The first tastes of this ale are of smooth pumpkin and vanilla. Strong nutmeg and cinnamon flavors quickly take over before slowly backing down to a finish mixed with vanilla and cream. The aftertaste of this beer is very strong and lasts for quite a long time after each sip. Unfortunately, the spice flavors really overpower this beer if it warms up too much.  The mouth presence lacks carbonation. Naturally, it is quite spicy on the tongue and slightly oily. I'm really on the fence with this one.  Drinkability is only about average, even for a pumpkin ale.

10099,6260,Oxymoron,3.91,"Did Aston Kucher help with this beer (""Punk'N"" Ale). Pour was rather cloudy with a more lighter amber color then say an orange hue. A big but tight head that lasts for some time. Limited lacing as time goes along.  The nose really makes this beer sparkle. Spice per style with cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and brown sugar really reminds me more of a pumpkin pie, then say pumpkin beer. There are hints of ""beer"" in the back with some malty essences. Touches of caramel and bready notes, as well as some light bittering hop notes.  The taste is similar as the smell but just toned down and balanced out more. The malt has more of an English feel (marris otter) and a slight astringent feel. The spices are there but it seems that the cloves are a little more dominate. More of a gingerbread then pumpkin. Some bitterness in the hops but not much on finishing.  The body has a mid feel with limited carbonation. Surprising ABV as there is a light wispy flavor.

The expected punkin pie smell combined with a cloying sweetness that makes you lust against your will. Smells like a punkin flavored winter warmer to me. A brown sugar sweetness forms the backbone of a well balanced spicy flavor. The alcohol is noticable but adds to the spiciness of the beer in the best of ways. The mouthfeel is fuller than other punkin ales I've had but very smooth. I wouldn't really consider this a session beer, but it would be an excellent beer to drink with your Thanksgiving meal. Dogfish Head does an excellent job of making their beers a little bit different than everyone elses.

Mouthfeel was medium bodied and quite smooth and easy drinking. I could pick up a slight alcoholic note as the beer warmed to room temperature. Drinkability was fairly high.

A - Clear, orange color with little head; decent lacing that lasted half-way through my sampling.  S - Combination of sweet & spice...and of course, pumpkin. I think I enjoy this smell more than other pumpkin ales in that the spice dominates the aroma more than that of pumpkin. Brown sugar is another noticable part of the aroma.  T - Spices galore. Cloves, nutmeg, and some cinnamon flavors compliment the pumpkin, but the biggest surprise is that of gingerbread...definitely didn't expect that. Finishes with the same brown sugar flavor as noticed in the smell. The flavors work very well together as the spices blend very well with the pumpkin.  M - Medium-to-full body with little carbonation. The slightly-higher ABV is only slightly detectable (as hidden by the spices) and it finishes very smooth.

T-There is a big spice taste mixed with pumpkin right off the bat. This lingers in the mouth for the aftertaste too. Almost a spicey after taste. The brown sugar comes through too. Pretty sweet. Flavors better blended together. Makes for a more complex brew. M-Medium body and low to medium carbonation. D- I prefer the 05. It drinks nicely and easy to drink.

The pumpkin is better hidden in this as well. The hops show them self a bit more too. T-The hops are more present. The one in particular spice comes out a lot more too. I'm thinking it may be the brown sugar or the cinnamon. Bit of grassy notes also.

Lots of faint spice behind this: cinnamon, nutmeg, and some molasses/brown sugar aromas in the middle. A background scent of fresh pumpkin innards with little alcohol detectable.  Taste - Tangy/bitter (and somewhat oily) hops right away with a barrage of the spices mentioned above. The nutmeg really picks up here. Pumpkin flavor throughout, again. Finishes with some spicy, sweet, and slightly roasted/smoked malt character. The aftertaste has strong caramel/brown sugar sweetness and lingering spicy malts. Mild earthiness is also present in the finish and aftertaste. Little alcohol throughout.  Mouthfeel - Pretty close, if not all the way, to full-bodied. It has some excited/biting carbonation up front, but only for a moment. The edge of this quickly dies down and it takes on a suble, massaging structure.  Drinkability - The flavors aren't terribly strong, but the overall complexity of the beer from the spices, etc. to take their toll on your buds. Still, this stuff is pretty easy to drink...I could make four or so of these dissappear without too much effort (and I'm not talking about pouring them down the drain!)

To many brews in this difficult to make style are either to watered down or have too much going on- DFH finds a nice balance.

Despite this brew's obvious pumpkin pie scents, the sweetness is spot on--not cloying or overpowering.  The flavor strikes this same kind of balance with good sweetness across the middle of the palate, and a nice, brown sugar-flavored finish. It has enough of a dry, hoppy (this is DH after all) backbone to give some body to back up the beer's other sweet flavors.

All others present and accounted for too.  The finish leaves a lingering spiciness on the tongue, while the mothfeel has tingle, heft and smoothness all at once.

The smell is not spicey and stong the way I expected, though I am getting some nutmeg, but mainly it's just a malty smell. The taste is slightly tart, with a suprising amount of cinnamon, along with nutmeg, and malt. There is a slightly bitter finish, but not hoppy, more a combination of bitter barlery and some kind of tannin from the spcies. This whole time I'm wondering if there are actually hops in this. I can't really taste them, but sometimes I think I can smell them. And this leads me to the question of the hour... which flavor is the pumkin? This certainly does not have the hearty and rich character of a pumpkin pie, and even then, what do you taste more in a pumpkin pie... the pumpkin or the spices? I've got to attribute the sour/tartness to the pumpkin, but having no experience with pumpkin brews, its complete speculation. The mouthfeel is pretty typical for a DFH brew, that being a full medium body with a watery, dry finish.

More pronounced and richer malt character than most pumpkin beers, sour and rich kilned pumpkin character come through. Doughy and chewy mouthfeel, makes you feel as though you were tasting some nice pumpkin bread. Spices are not overwhelming, they play around in the background unlike a lot of other pumpkin brews. A little bit of a drying barky effect present due to the cinnamon.  Props to the 7% ABV on this one, a very distinct approach at pumpkin beer in my opinion. One of the necessary drinks in the genre.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,mmcave,3.83,"Once again I'm not a Pumpkin beer guy normally, I've reviewed one and thought a counter point would be a good idea, especially when its a dogfish head. Poured an orangey amber color with golden high lights. The head is a white foam color, leaving some lacing, with decent retention. Smells just like it says subtle, but real pumpkin, brown sugar, spice, cinnamon and nutmeg. Smells more like an ale with pumpkin/spicing added sparingly, not an over powering smack in the face of synthetic pumpkin pie. Honestly the the smell is not terribly enticing, but its equally not dispelling. The flavor is not as sweet as I expected, its got a bit more tartness and a nice tinge of bitterness. It maintains a nice crisp flavor, some malt complexity and a mellow pumpkin spice finish. For me I'd prefer this type of pumpkin beer to others that use a syrup to flavor and are more forward front with their over sweet pumpkin flavor. Personally this is not as good as some of Dogfish heads other seasonal brews (aprihop) but its definitely not bad. If some one wanted a pumpkin brew, so far I'd say this is the way to go.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Unfortunately, this was about the only good thing I could say about this beer.  Aromas of spice and alchohol. Not much pumpkin. Most of the other pumpkin ales I've tried have smelled better than this.  Taste was quite disappointing. Very bitter alcohol taste. Some spiciness. Reminds me of cheap malt-liquor. The more I sip this beer the less I like it.  The mouthfeel is simultaneously sticky and dry and watery.  Overall, I really didn't care for this beer. It is one of the worst pumpkin ales I've tried. Quite disappointing. I may pour it down the drain instead of fnishing it. I hope people who try this as their first pumpkin ale will not give up on the style. There are many other ones out there that IMO are much better--Cottonwood, Edenton, and Post Road all come to mind.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Appearance- Pumpkin in color, crystal clear. 1/2"" white head. Some lacing.  Smell- Allspice and nutmeg are quite strong. Caramel and a hint of smoke (not sure why, but yeah, I got smoke).  Taste- Pumpkin flavor plays a much bigger role here than in the smell. Lots of spices... too much in my opinion. Roasted malts- very fresh tasting.  Mouthfeel- I'd call this close to full-bodied, good carbonation, and fairly smooth.  Drinkability- More flavorful than most pumpkin ales, but the flavor choices to me were a bit odd.

Poured a very slightly cloudy orange colour with a white foamy head that faded away very quickly leaving a ring of frost around the edges of the glass. Smell is sweet malts with a muted but present portfolio of pumpkin pie, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a maple syrup smell hidden way in the back. Very nice. Taste is more of the same, finishing mildly sweet and leaving all these flavour profiles in your mouth many seconds after you've swallowed a sip. Mouthfeel is a bit heavier than I was expecting.

Head is white but has nice retention. Minimal lacing on the glass.  Aroma is weak. Not much if any pumpkin or other pumpkin type aromas. Sweet smelling. Not much hops in the nose here either. Possibly some molasses but otherwise, a very average beer, aroma wise.  Taste is overly sweet and completely unbalanced. I taste small amounts of cinnamon and cloves, but otherwise, just a regular ale. Certainly not a brown, maybe closer to a light red ale. Very dissapointed here as well.  Overall, not a good beer. Mouthfeel has some redeeming qualities as it is close to medium bodied. I do like the spicy cinnamon that pops all over the mouth, almost like strong pepper or pop rocks. Some astringency detracts and deters. I purchased a four pack of this, and it will probably be the only four I ever purchase.  I dont know why it is so hard to make a good pumpkin beer. I have had two pumpkin beers (Post Road and Cottonwood) that are actually pumpkiny and balanced and the whole nine.

Smooth and delicious, it has a nice copper hue with incredible aromas- just like on the bottle- allspice, cinnamon and nutmeg. But it is not overpowering. I think this due to the hops.

The first sip shows a huge peppery spice ester character, toasted malts, and considerable hop addition. Roasted barley, yeasty. The alcohol presence is fairly potent and mixed with a high hop content it seems to blend the pumpkin pie spices almost too well. Its difficult to discern between all of the spices. Moving down the glass I found some more notes of caramel, cinnamon, and smoothed out roasted malts.

The smell is of pumpkin with cinnamon and nutmeg. Smells similar to a homemade pumpkin pie.  It's nearly a pumpkin pie in a bottle, with some warming alcohol. The taste is spicy - cinnamon and nutmeg especially, but they do not overpower the solid pumpkin taste. There's a brown sugar coating.  It's on the lighter side of full-bodied, more solid medium bodied. Creamy and smooth, though the alcohol is just a tad more noticeable in the feel than it should, but still acceptable.  Bottom line - it's a nicely spiced pumpkin ale. It's not as over-the-top, or unusual, as other offerings from this brewery. It's just a well-done, enjoyable pumpkin ale.

10099,6260,xoqx,3.23,"Get your gourd on! This beer pours medium amber colored and does not indicate that there is some tremendous artificial onslaught of pumpkin or spices lurking within this brew. Its not cloudy. There is mostly yeast and some nutty spices in the nose. The taste is peculiar, even for a pumpkin ale. There are almost meaty spices in the taste, spices I do not associate with beer, but are nonetheless ok. The taste turns midway and sours towards the finish in a way I do not appreciate. The malts are hard to pick out of the spice and hops. Some of the flavors I am reading as spices are probably hops. Its relatively light bodied, and while sporting a 7% abv, it does not taste very alcoholic, though it does warm a bit. As the brew got above 60° the spices came out more in the nose. On the last drink, I had an actual bite of pumpkin pie. Beer Advocacy is about pairing food and ales, right? Well, this beer goes well with pumpkin pie, believe it or not. I would go so far as to say that might be the right way to enjoy this beer; as a dessert beer accompanying an autumnal slice of homemade pumpkin pie. Im not a fan of this style, per se, and I respect that this beer tends to be more like beer and less like a pumpkin or a pumpkin pie. That said, its not the best beer offered by this superb brewery.  Edit note: I have to disagree with the recommended serving temperature of this beer: 45-50°F. I really feel that it had a decent start at 55° and sort of came into its own at 60-61°.

If I drink another of the 3 out of the 4-pack and it is carbonated, I'll come back and change this portion of the review. Also, before I get too far. A 4-pack? Really? That's...um...lousy. It's not WWS. It's not even 90 minute. Give me a whole damn 6 pack.  The smell is all spice, with a smidge of sqash/pumpkin, but mostly clove and cinnamon and... allspice, I guess. A slight alco-pop aroma of malt is somewhere in there too.  Taste is okay, really. I'm getting some cinnamon all over my mouth, and a little pumpkin essence, but mostly, it's essentially another pumpkin soda with some alcohol. Except of course for the complete lack of carbonation.  Mouthfeel. Yeah. Whatever that may be. I'm getting some cinnamon grittiness on top of a pile of ""punkin"". Maybe we've been punkd?  Oh god. I'm not going to drink another one of these.

Initial smell was of astringent alcohol (similar to model airplane glue) with some faint all spice notes in the background. As the beer settled, some nutmeg aroma was noticeable with a touch of sweet fruitiness as well.  Taste was rich and malty from start to finish with ripe fruits, brown sugar, some spicy/peppery notes and a big alcohol punch (but unfortunately no pumpkin was detectable). Nice, hoppy, bittering bite on the rear of the palate. Sweet, malty, caramel-like aftertaste apparent later.  Mouthfeel was incredible. Rich, full, creamy, lush and pillowy on the palate.

Ruby red/amber bottom, clear and transparent with beautiful reflective light, small + thin foam laces the top. Carbonation very visible, head becomes murky and hardly noticeable.  Aroma is bready, hearty, and contains everything a rich slice of pumpkin pie should. Wonderful spices on the nose - strong cinnamon, nutmeg, some cardamom. Sweet and spicy, very fulfilling aroma.  Wonderful pumpkin purée taste, with a noticeable hop biterness. Malts work well with the pumpkin, and spices linger in the background. Some cinnamon and sugar on the tongue, sweet finish. Carbonation is present, not overpowering, but a touch strong. As is the norm with DFH, alcohol is well contained.

It's sweet, but not cloying. I don't taste a strong flavor of pumpkins, but rather a nice, spiced brew. The flavor is quite delicate, which is good. This beer doesn't bash you on the head with spice and pumpkin flavors, like another pumpkin ale I've had.  The body is smooth and slick. I'm guessing the 7 percent ABV has a role to play in that.

In the aroma, there comes a slightly sweet caramel malt earthiness, lightly toasted and crusty. Mild pumpkin and a combo of nutmeg, cinnamon, and clove swirls easily among a trace of alcohol.  Upon tasting, light berry fruitiness and toasted caramel bear a margin of sweetness before autumnal spices crisp up their surroundings with nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice, and clove ringing true. As the spice smooths to a tingly bitterness, a creamy note of pumpkin fills the palate. The finish is dry, roundly bitter, and gently lingering. This is one flavorful fall treat.  Light to medium bodied, it caresses and coats with a savory glow in tow.  While I am not the biggest pumpkin ale fan, this one wins me over.

S: Pumpkin pie notes with spices in the background--nutmeg and cinnamon. Leafy hop notes can be detected once you work through the nutmeg and cinnamon. T/M: Smooth and creamy across the palate. Pumpkin pie flavors with nutmeg and cinnamon jumping out. Sugary and sweet (malt) as you smack your lips. Slighly bitter in the aftertaste with a chalkyness to it. Moderate body.

10099,6260,Liquids,3.6,"Pours a glowingly orangey-amber with a one finger bubbled head and chapagne like carbonation. This claims to be a brown ale? Hard to see. Aroma is rathery pumpkin-like, a bit of hops detected, not much in spice aromas...or maybe the nutmeg and allspice are simply making me think pumkin? Hard to tell. Taste wise its actually a bit pumpkiny, definitely hoppy, and more of a pale ale in style, with yes, a legitimate pumpkin flavor! Spices are subdued and acompany the hops in the finish if any. The 7% is not present in the flavor, which is rather thick. Mouthfeel is medium, and by the now the carbvonation has settled, so okay at this point. Drinabilitywise, It's the best pumpkin beer I've tasted yet by far, though a little less hops could make the pumpkin shine through a bit more, and some might crave more spices. Never knowing the 7% abv here is scary, and the label is the only way we'd know. My favorite brewery does not disapoint, but this beer doesn't make me want to make room for it in the stockpile. Nothing I'll buy in four packs, but I can see grabbing a single or two of this per season for variety.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

A slightly heavy finish with an average mouthfeel.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,auntfloyd,4.05,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a standard pint glass.  Pours a gorgeous copper color with a finger of white head. Fairly dark coloring for this style.  The nose is sweet, with a delightful pumpkin/malt/spice sent. Everything a pumpkin ale should be.  The taste follows up on the promises of the scent. An early pumpkin flavor blends well with an overall note of spice and brown sugar, which is carried onto a midway of maltiness. The taste ends on a distinct alcohol note, perhaps a reminder of the 7 abv. of this ale.  The mouthfeel is very smooth, with low carbonation, and a very high drinkability. That said, this is a stronger ale than you might have imagined; certainly moreso than most of its fellow pumpkin ales.  Dogfish Head brewed up another winner with this ale. I would probably say that of all the pumpkin ales I've had, this one is my absolute favorite: just the right blend of sweetness and spice. If I had a slice of pumpkin pie with it, I think I'd be in heaven.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,Gedackt16,3.7,"Bought in a four pack. A bit expensive but since I love Pumpkin Ales, well worth it. This was a pretty tough beer. Poured a beautiful dark orange amber colour. The head stuck around much longer than other Pumpkin Ales I've met but still not as long as I'd have liked. Spices (especially Nutmeg!) overpower any pumpkin flavor there is and the alcohol is very tasteable. Also sense somewhat of a toasty flavor in the finish. Very nice beer and is very hearty. 7.0% is a bit of a kicker too. Nice beer but only for the tough among us. I only got through about two before I needed something a tad lighter. Excellent effort by Dogfish but one word of advice (and this is according to MY taste, not everyone else's) turn it down just a tad.

10099,6260,BlackJeremiah,4.24,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. I have yet to be impressed by a pumpkin ale; however, I am approaching this one with nothing but optimism.  A: Pours a pumpkin color (surprise). Light coppery orange, with very minimal head. Not much lacing evident, if any. Pretty, but I might have liked to see a bit more of a present head.  S: Smells like fresh pumpkin, biscuit, cinnamon, and cloves. Nice, mild, scent, with just a hint of the spices. Great for a light fall ale.  T: I'm still not the biggest fan of this style, but I definitely like this one. The pumpkin tastes roasty and sweet, mixing with the malt. Cinnamon a bit at the start, but mild. Cloves mixed throughout. Little tiny bit of citric character comes out with successive sips, but again, very subdued. Roasty malt and pumpkin are definitely the commanding flavors here. Just looked at the bottle again, and it's 7% ABV. They did one hell of a job masking it.  M: Thick, just shy of syrupy. Thick on the palate, too, but since the aftertaste is fleeting, it's not a cloying brew. Seems appropriate for the style.  D: This is the only pumpkin ale I've finished with the sense that I'd like another. That's pretty darn impressive to me, and a mark of how well-balanced and subtle the flavors are here. By far the best pumpkin ale I've ever had.

M: Light with nice carbonation. Dry and slightly sweet finish.  D: To me this beer is like a Belgian style pumpkin brew, the alcohol comes through as sweet bourbon.

T: Sweet with flavors similar to the aroma. The finish is clean and the flavor quickly dies away.  M: The bottle calls this ""full-bodied"", I see it more on the medium-light side. Slightly watery and highly carbonated.  D: Probably the best pumpkin ale that I've had, but with that said, I'm not a huge fan of this beer.

Aside from the unsweetened pumpkin meat I can only smell a little cinnamon and that's about it. Taste is far more complex.The pumpkin is rich and sweet, followed by cinnamon and rumminess. Is that a hint of vanilla I detect, conjuring images of a whipped cream atop a slice of pie? Finish is very dry. This is a damn good pumpkin ale.

Smells slightly accented by the pumpking but highlighted by spices such as nutmeg and cinnamon combined with roasted nuts. Very nice.  The taste is driven again by the spices with the pumpkin as the backbone. Very good and heavy spices make it taste a bit more Christmasy and reminescent more of winter than fall but certainly no complaints. Nice and complex.  The mouthfeel is a nice balance between the mild sweetness, the tingle of the spices and a nice complement of bitterness.  Quite enjoyable and drinkable though i don't know if the spices and sweetness would wear on me after a few of these.

Aroma is of pumpkins, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, clove, and a tinge of alcohol.  Taste is of plum and pumpkin, very crisp rather than creamy. A crisp, clear taste of pumpkin, nutmeg, cinnamon .. some hops are evident. Flavor comes out more as the ale warms, this one should be served a bit warmer, maybe just below room temp.

Tasted alongside O'Fallon and Ichabod, the O'Fallon was the clear pumpkin pie winner. The New Holland Ichabod was mostly harmless (no strong pumpkin profile) and a little hoppy.

Pours a pure copper, amber. You could read a book through it, if warm. Not too much of a head, so pour it however you like it. Minimal lacing, as well, a hint at the fact that it doesn't taste too sugary or starchy.  Smells profoundly of pumpkin pie before you've had a sip, although the first sip indoctrinates you. Built on a malty brown ale base, the spices fill this beer out, but all pumpkin ales are inherently unbalanced because of this, IMO. You have a great variety of tastes in the same spectrum competing, and there's just no way to let one win out, even slightly. The finish is great, but there's just something overwhelming about the initial taste that bugs me.  A beer to drink a few times every fall. Get a four pack and introduce some friends to it. It's better than most of the other attempts at pumpkin ale. Maybe the fact that I typically skip the pumpkin pie at thanksgiving has something to do with it.

On the second taste I'm still failing to pick up any of the real pumpkin flavor until the aftertaste. In all honesty, I actually prefer this type of pumpkin ale when the theme is more suggested than explicit i.e. I don't care for the overly sweet versions that amount to drinking a pie.

I'm not picking up much of the 7% alcohol, and this, coupled with the thin mouthfeel and great flavor, really makes for a drinkable beer.

A large amount of pumpkin, a good bit of cinnamon, and a generous portion of nutmeg. The all-spice and brown sugar are definitely there as well, but more subdued.  This beer has a very strong caramel malt backbone. Slightly earthy, with a hint of roastiness. The malt infuses together with the pumpkin and spices perfectly. What I enjoy about this beer, is that Dogfish Head did not go overboard on the spices. It's balanced to perfection, and is the epitomy of fall beers. Mouthfeel is right on for the style.

This is the smoothest pumpkin or spice beer that I've ever had. Traditional pumpkin pie spices mingle with a sweet, brown sugar taste to balance the sharp spicy tastes. The body consists of bread, pumpkin and sweet malt with a gentle, sweet finish.  This is a medium bodied, well-carbonated seasonal treat for the mouth.

A few swirls across the tongue reveal; great depths of pumpkin pie flavors. Brown sugar, nutmeg, caramel, cloves, pumpkin a bit of drying alcohol and a little bit of herbs showcased in the finish. The aftertaste is a bit dry leaving the lips smacking and wanting the next sip.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth and creamy a bit juicy slick with little carbonation (maybe due to growler or could be built that way). Regardless the beer seems to slip easy down the throat.  Drinkability: This is ridiculously easy to drink. I think this may be the best pumpkin ale I have had yet. It is like holiday punch beer. Super tasty and in as much it may be a fantastic beer I think it was a good thing I didnt have a full growler or it'd all be in my intoxicated belly.  Hope this is helpful. Cheers!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,hunteraw,3.65,"I bottled my homebrew pumpkin ale the same day that I tried this, so I was very curious to see how the sample I had at bottling time compared with this, the first commercial pumpkin beer I've tried.  Appearance: Pours a fairly orange color, clearer than I expected (much clearer than my homebrew pumpkin ale, anyway). Minor white head and lacing.  Smell: Acidic-smelling, if that makes sense, pumpkin and spice are present.  Taste: The flavor profile is surprisingly similar to what I had earlier in the day, which is obviously pleasing. Pumpkin is there, but not in an in-your-face pumpkin pie kind of way. Spices are more present than hops, which are scarcely detectable as far as flavor goes, but balance the sweetness well.  Mouthfeel: light body, good carbonation. I'd like to try a thick pumpkin beer sometime, that's a bit more like ""pumpkin pie in a glass""  Drinkability: It's obviously not an every-day beer, but for an off-beat beer it's pretty accessible and there's enough complexity to appeal to serious beer drinkers, as well.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

This beer tasted pretty good, I only had one as a result as it was given to me from my boss to try out, but that one I had was above average. It didn't have an overwhelming pumkin taste, in fact it was kind of understated, at least as far as other beer lovers have lead me to expect. The smell was another thing, however.

Flavor is pumpkin, caramel malt, and some nutmeg. Spices come through towards the back and into the finish. Clean, finish...no bitterness or hop presence to speak of.  Medium body, light carbonation. Good balance. I like that the pumpkin isn't overwhelming like some other examples I've had. Nice overall blending of flavors.

A slight pumpkin taste, more implied than actual I guess... Finishes spicy & warming  MF: Medium bodied, good carbonation, but a slight pricklyness & pretty good balance  Drinks allright, I'd say this probably if not the best pumpkin ale I've tasted.

Finish is sweet and brown sugary with a mildly bitter tail. Has some lingering bitterness as an aftertaste.  M: Medium-bodied. A bit sugary.  D: A bit too high in abv for me to consider drinking too many of these at a time, but this was nice.

Slightly warming as it leaves a pumpkin pie coating on the tongue.  D- I have had few pumpkin style ales before and I could only drink one at most because it was so sweet or didn't seem like beer.

It may be the seasonal allergies, but I don't really sense the normal scents associated with pumpkin ales. Doesn't seem to smell overly spiced.  Despite the lack of aroma, the taste is perfect. It's exactly what you're looking for in a pumpkin beer - spices, pumpkin, some cinnamon. Not over the top in the pumpkin department, but you do know it's there.  The mouthfeel doesn't feel as creamy as I would've liked. It actually, in my opinion, feels a bit watery. Seems to be a tad watery until the very end when spice fills the mouth as you swallow.  Typically, I cannot drink more than 2 pumpkin ales, but I can definitely drink the 4 pack this beer came in.  If you're looking for an overly pumpkin, thick desert style beer, this isn't the one.

10099,6260,WonderWoman,3.04,I had this beer on tap at the Grey Lodge. It poured a dark golden with a small rim of head that lingered for a short time. The smell was of chewing gum that you get from the gumball machine for a nickel and some really awkward spices that didnt mesh well together. It tasted of light subtle spices with a tangy afterthought followed by hints of bubble gum. The mouth feel was smooth and it coated my mouth. It also had energetic carbonation.

The beers head is tall and fluffy. The coloration of the head is a orange tinged biege.  Smell: The beer smells like a good spiced tea. This beer is loaded with sugary malty sweetness, allspice, cinnamon and nutmeg. Basically the spice compliment is what you would expect with pumpkin pie. The beer has a vague sort of crusty bread smells. One problem I dont really smell pumpkin in the beer; however, at other times I strongly suspect I smell pumpkin in the beer. I dont know if it is wishful thinking here on my part. The beer works for my on the spiced beer level. The lemony earthy hops work well with beers overall spicy smell.  Taste: The beer is a spicy soup of the above smells. Again this beer works as a spiced ale in my opinion. I cannot pinpoint any pumpkin in the beer. Spicy alcohol plays well with floral earth hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: This beer beer has a creamy medim body. This beer was very easy to drink. I enjoyed the beer in terms of a spiced herbal beer experience. I didnt get any pumpkin smells or flavors to this beer. I will buy it again as a good herb/ spice beer.

Poured from the bottle into a pint glass a nice orange color, and a nicely sized white heading, that quickly faded to a thin lacing. Aroma was pleasing, with some definite pumpkin pie presence, as well as other spices. My only complaint with the smell was there seemed to be a somewhat sopay presence to it, not becoming at all. Taste was about as close as ive seen to a brewery really capturing the pumpkin taste without making it seem too artificial. Mouthfeel was relatively medium in size. As for dinkability, one was enough for me. Even though I have the utmost respect for this breweries attempt at the style, it is simply one that ive never really enjoyed too much.

S: I dont knw why, but I dont like the smell. Well maybe I do. I can smell HINTS of pumpkin, but I might be putting them there because I want to. A very small amount of spice is present in the nose, but actually it smells adjuncty (I know, pumpkin would be an adjunct) and watery. Sorry that this will hurt the overall rating so much, but I hold my breath before I take the next sips.  T: This is easily the best pumpkin beer I have had. But I don't like pumpin beers. Not one to bow down before marketing and the traditional 'pumpkin ales' DFH did a great job. Now I taste a pumpkiny taste filled with a nice subtly sweet maltyness and a zing of autumn spices to balance the malt. Rather than rely on hops to create balance, I think they used spices. Different, but very similiar. Nice work.  M: Very nice, thick and medium heavy, a little syrupy, but then has a high carbonation kick that I find pleasing. Nicely done and again I am very happy that DFH didnt just throw some spices to a watery beer and label it as pumpkin beer (cough Shipyard chough).  D: I cant seem to put this down. Very surprised.

I can smell a very strong spiced pumpkin smell, like when you first start carving one and sticking your mug directly inside the pumpkin, also smell a bit of clove sweetness in there, I truly love the smell of this crafted beer and whish they would bottle it as a cologne. The taste is awesome what I smell I taste, just with that bit of hop bitterness that we all love from those crafters at Dogfish, awesome.

Starts with a well-balanced, light malt sweetness and ends with everything on the label (pumpkin, brown sugar, allspice, cinnamon and nutmeg). Much more mellow, in a good way, from what I would expect from DFH. Smooth, light (maybe a little too light, believe it or not) and balanced mouthfeel. Definitely easy to drink.

Spicey burnt aromas but very little in way of pumpkin. More centered on all spice, nutmeg, and cinnamon.  Again I remember previous years being better or more balanced and complex. This years had a somewhat watery thin mouthfeel. Things seem slightly discombobulated also. There is slightly more pumpkin than in the nose but it's not complementing the spices as well.

Not much lacing at all, and the head, which is very airy and not extremely sticky, fades fairly quickly.  Smell: Maple, pumpkin spice, nutmeg, breadiness, biscuity, malty, and some hops in there too. More like a beer with added spice and quality flavors instead of pumpkin pie with a shot of beer added to it, thankfully.  Taste: A nice, full-bodied malty flavor with some spices tingling the taste buds. The pumpkin pie-filling flavors are there, but complimentary instead of overly compensating for everything. Some nice peppery spice and nutmeg and clove comes in there too, and some vanilla and maple-like malt flavors. Finishes fairly sweet, with a nice hop-bite tinge to it, which unfortunately doesn't linger as long as I want it too, though the later finish also has some nice spice to it.  Mouthfeel: Fairly creamy while also remaining pretty crisp, with a nice full tinge of carbonation at the swallow.  Drinkability: One of my favorite styles for the fall, and something I get excited about when the time comes near. This is one of the better styles you can get, and though it's slightly pricey at about $9 a 4-pack, it's a tasty treat, one that you can manage to spread over a few days with the ABV being 7%.

The taste is more pleasing than the smell, a nice caramel malt flavor upfront followed by a mild blend of pumpkin pie spices. The spices are not overdone, and compliment the beer rather well. However, there is a lingering bitter spiciness at the end which caused me to lower the score a bit.  Medium body, creamy texture.  Farily drinkable except for the mildly annoying aftertaste.

S: The smell is a strong ginger, pumpkin & brown sugar aroma. You also get the impression from the smell that it’s a very bready beer, in addition to the heavy sweetness.  T: It doesn’t taste as sweet as it smells which I’m going to consider a good thing. There’s little bit more hops and alcohol bite in the taste than you get in the smell.  M: Smooth with a medium body and a bit higher carbonation than I would have expected from a beer in this style. It’s not as bready as the smell indicates and doesn’t leave the stickiness that you would expect from the style either.  D: It goes down easy and there’s almost no hint of the 7.00% ABV.

When I went into the liquor store, I didn’t expect to buy this beer, but it was on special and the price made it irresistible, given the rep of DFH. While I liked the beer and it was more than what I expected from a beer of this style, it’s not something I would want to drink very often. However, if I do decide to drink it, I’d make short work of the 4-pack.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,alexgash,4.17,"Clear, dark oranger copper body with a finger of loose, slightly fizzy, off-khaki head. Sugar wafer malt and rummy fruit aromas give way to whiffs of pumpkin pie, allspice, cinnamon, and a bit of nutmeg. Smells like the spice rack fell in the pot. Not overpowering though; I think the fruity alcohol helps the spice smell and taste less artificial. Lightly toasted malt flavors combine with sweet pears and pie crust. Spices, especially nutmeg and allspice throughout, and most notably toward the finish. Nice complexity and quite tasty. Medium bodied ale, with a relatively lively feel that helps fight any cloying or spiced-out tendencies. Light toasted malt in the finish and residual spicy sweetness and a maybe some orange peel/marmalade. I can't imagine drinking pint after pint of this, but this is definitely the best pumpkin beer I've had (so far).",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

A thin two finger rose and fell quickly to leave a small white ring around the glass. Only one column of beading.  Smell: WOW! Spices galore! Cinammon, clove, nutmeg, ginger and pumpkin for sure. Spices dominat the malt in the nose. No alcohol detected.  Taste: The reason I gave this a five is because of the accuracy with which Dogfish Head has delivered this liquid pumpkin pie. Very complex yet very balanced and symmetrical flavors. Like the nose the spices really pop out. Cinammon sticks, clove, all spice, ginger, nutmeg, and a most delicious slice of pumpkin pie. Nice bready sweetness as well, slightly herbal.  Mouthfeel: Meduim carbonation at first.A nice slick middle and finish. Very smooth easy drinking kind of beer.

Hard to compare with the style since I haven't had any good pumkin beers.  Looks pretty good coming out of the bottle. Not much head or lacing to speak of. Copper brown color with moderate bubbling.  Smell is pumkin (I guess), some brown sugar, and lemon.  Taste gets more into the brown sugar and spices. I can definitely pick out cinnamon and some caramel.

Nice and sweet smelling, but not cloyingly so, with some caramel and brown sugar. Hop presence is low, as it should be.  mouthfeel: The carbonation is medium, and the body the same.  taste: The taste is a little more subtle in the ester and spice department, which is good. A nice caramel malt backbone blends with flavors of pumpkin pie spice. Hard to pick out the pumpkin, though I feel as if I can...maybe some roasted pumpkin seed too.

Aromas of pumpkins, roasted malts, and seasonal spices come out. Together, the aromas remind me of fallen leaves, a cool breeze, and the season of Fall. The taste is smooth and sweet with the pumpkin flavor taking a back seat to various spices. The sweet flavor is never overly dominant or too sweet. The carbonation adds a level or richness that exploits the spicy backbone.

10099,6260,bditty187,4.12,"Hazy, muted bronze in hue with a peachy gold infusion; lovely! The head was beige; there were about two fingers of forth before the bubbles quickly faded to a thin, soapy cap. This mini-head stuck around awhile, at least the beer wasnt left naked. Sadly, the subsequent lacing was minimal, only a few spots here and there. Still, overall, this is an attractive looking beer.  The nose is fleshy meaty in a pumpkin kind of way. Sure, there are pie spices but the malt and pumpkins really shine in the nose. The nutmeg and cinnamon are second fiddle; this is almost always the opposite. Kudos to DFH for that! Ive only smelt one Pumpkin Ale meatier (which was from Platte Valley Brewery in Kearney, NE the beer is not even listed on BA (I only had a few ounces of it)). So, officially this is the best smelling Pumpkin Ale Ive had. Moderate but firm potency and without a doubt I find the nose inviting. Yummy!  The palate is very tasty. Hearty. The abv plays peek-a-boo, it is hidden but I can feel it. There is great bulk plenty malty for the style. Plus there are lots of pumpkin flavors. It is earthy in spots. Nutmeg and cinnamon are found in the middle and they last to the finish. But at no time to they outshine the body of this beer. This is a very healthy pumpkin ale. It has a spicy finish with a malty residue. I say screw making this a seasonal and go year round! Very tasty! I see why this beer is so highly regarded; it blows away almost every Pumpkin Ale Ive tried.  The label says, A full bodied brown ale. I never believe brewers when they use the word full bodied. However, Id call this beer medium/medium full in body. It is hefty on the tongue. The bulk and abv indicate this beer is a sipper. I say, gladly! I dont want to see this beer end.  Very drinkable, dangerously so! I could knock back a six-pack on a cool fall day. I am very impressed with this beer. I now want to taste more beers like this I wonder if any can match it. Ive heard good things about a couple other Pumpkin Ales; I will try them next fall.

10099,6260,woodychandler,4.22,"This arrived with a huge, fluffy, off-white/light tan head above a slightly cloudy, medium-amber colored beer. The nose was spicy, like a blend of cinnamon, allspice, ginger, clove, and others. The scent was very evocative of pumpkin pie. The mouthfeel was tingly, tangy, spicy, but not hot. Fizzy? I dislike that term, but it was a refreshingly palate-cleansing beer. The spiciness was evident on the palate, but the finish was where they were really at. As it warmed, the the spices became even more evident. I wrote that it would be perfect for autumn afternoons watching football, the leaves changing colors, gourds flying across the sky ... Bring on the fall!  Today is F, 09 August 2014 and as part of my ongoing campaign to divest myself of these pesky bottles, I came upon one in the basement's Beerfrigerator. I wish that I had noted where I got it on-tap in 2005, or where I scored this one. C'est la guerre! Notched as ""Packaged in 2003"". Hee hee.  From the bottle: ""A full-bodied brown ale brewed with real pumpkin, brown sugar, allspice, cinnamon & nutmeg.""  I employed a very gentle pour as I was not sure whether any lees were present. I could not see any, but that means nothing. I had no head initially, but I swirled it and got a finger of tawny head that lasted only briefly. Color was Amber to Deep-amber (SRM = &gt; 9, &lt; 13) with NE-quality clarity. Nose had really evolved to the point that the cinnamon and nutmeg stood out like a pair of sore thumbs! Spicy. Mouthfeel was medium and the carbonation was nothing like I had noted in its on-tap form. I liked this a bit better, actually. The taste was mellow, very spicy, but not as intense as it may have been. This really seemed to have aged well over the decade-plus. It took on a brandy-like quality that I found quite interesting. The label reads ""7% Alc. by Vol."", but it was packing some heat. The spices really dried it out to the point that pumpkin and brown sugar were afterthoughts. It was bitingly dry and still slightly hot, reinforcing my brandy idea, but I may revise that to ""sherry"". Either way, it was different!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,neonbrown82,4.71,"I'm not particularly a pumpkin ale fan, but this stuff is quite delicious. Pours to a dark orangish amber color with little to no head and a light carbonation. Hardly laces the glass at all.  The smell is great. Smells like a nutty, robust brown ale with all the spices listed on the bottle showing their true colors as well (REAL pumpkin, brown sugar, allspice, cinnamon, and nutmeg). Ever so slightly roasty.  The taste is just as great. A perfect blend of spices with each one quite distinguishable from the others. The finish shows off the nutty, gently roasty flavors with a great accentuating spice flavor. Even has a bit of an herbal hop to it.  The body is fairly big in this beer: nice and thick and velvety smooth. Honestly, I think this is the best Dogfish Head beer I've tried, and I've had almost all of the non-retired, non-uber-special releases. If not the best, it's definitely the most interesting. I would drink more of this stuff if it was available, but I don't think it was quite good enough where I would seek it out in an online purchase again. If I see it in a store, though, it's mine...

10099,6260,clabaugh,3.42,"Appearance: A light bronze color with reddish hues intermixed. The head was mediocre; not even a finger. The head color was a creamy white. The lacing is light, not lasting for more than a few minutes.  Smell: An aromatic masterpiece. This is one of the best smelling beers that I've ever experienced. This beer captures the scent of pumpkin pie. Ginger, cinnamon, and pumpkin overtones invigorate one's nostrils.  Taste: A sweet beer in accordance with the style. The pumpkin fades as one tastes the beer, with spices predominating. Ginger and cinnamon, along with hints of nutmeg stand out. The beer definitely has an acidic character, which is difficult to miss. The sweetness masks most evidence of hops.  Mouthfeel: Definitely a powerful sensation in one's mouth. Despite being 7% abv the alcohol presence is notable throughout. Carbonation is evident, as one's tongue tingles while drinking all the way through.  Drinkability: The sweetness, along with a strong presence of carbonation limit the beer's drinkability. I couldn't handle more than two or three consecutively, but overall, a fairly drinkable pumpkin ale. This style is not one to be consumed en masse. Limiting one's consumption of this beer in a sitting leads to maximum enjoyment.  Notes: A good fall seasonal. This style complements salty food very well due to its sweetness. The beer balances the flavors of most meats.

Taste; there's definitely pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg and maybe some allspice. Even with all of the spices in this beer it's not as overwhelmingly sweet as some other pumpkin ales I've had.

10099,6260,BuckeyeNation,4,"Generously bubbled pumpkin orange capped by a pastel orange, whipped creamy head that is a perfect color match for the beer that created it. The three finger cap has a considerable amount of patience, but doesn't look sticky enough to grab and hold onto the glass. A lack of lace is a minor disappointment that doesn't spoil a very nice pumpkin beer look.  The nose is as expected: baked pumpkin flesh and pumpkin pie spices. Perhaps I should go along with Dogfish Head and start writing punkin'. I've smelled pumpkinier versions and I've smelled spicier versions, but this one can hold its own against all but the most aromatic. Amazingly enough, even at a relatively high pumpkin ale ABV of 7%, there's no alcohol evident in the nose.  This is lovely stuff, even if the alcohol is now easily appreciated. This is definitely a different sort of pumpkin ale, a stronger version of the usual gourd beer. It's sweet and malty with a generous amount of caramel flavor. The spices aren't as up-front on the palate. The label indicates that allspice, cinnamon and nutmeg were used. They're all identifiable, with none dominating the others.  If I was in charge at the brewery, I'd knock the ABV back a full 2% (or try harder to mask it) and would add more brown sugar and spice. It's their beer, though, so I guess I'll have to take it or leave it. Um... I'll take it. This really is a quality fall seasonal.  The decision to build a sturdier pumpkin ale pays dividends when it comes to the mouthfeel. It's a few notches more full than medium and is as smooth as heavy silk. Too many bubbles on the initial pour become just the right amount before very long at all.  Punkin' Ale is one of the better versions that I've run across. It doesn't seriously challenge my clear favorite (Smuttynose Pumpkin), but it's definitely worthwhile and is deliciously different.

This beer was very smooth throughout, nice silky full mouthfeel. The nose pretty much confirms the flavor throughout the beer, with spicy and sweet hints. They didn't overdo the pumpkin, but there is enough where a first timer may say ""Hmm, Pumpkin Ale. Interesting"" I would recommend it to anyone, as it is probably the nicest pumpkin ale I've had.

The taste is medium to high alcohol right from the first, but tames slightly as the beer is drunk. As it goes down, the alcohol tames to a nice warming feeling.

Very little lacing. Color is dark iced tea with some ruby edges.  Smell is alcohol, then sweet brown sugar, some bready malt and pumpkin spices. Pretty much like pumpkin pie. The first taste is malty and maybe pumpkin (which I guess is pretty neutral when you make beer with it), then a little sweetness and some spiciness. Alcohol is barely detectable. I took the bottle out of my 40 degree-ish fridge about 15 minutes before pouring; I highly recommend doing this; the other three bottles from this four pack I started drinking too cold, which makes it all spices and alcohol.  Mouthfeel is medium and carbonation is medium-low, a good and almost creamy combination that melds well with the flavor. This beer tastes good for what it is, and I'm glad I tried it, but since I'm not a pumpkin pie fan I'm not sure I'd want more than one of these in a session.

The cinnamon and brown sugar standout, and I couldn't really taste much pumpkin. Either way, great beer and I am glad I gave it a second chance.  Old review:  I went through a fair amount to get this beer, and I got to say, for the first time, I think I am going to be in disagreement with most, in the negative direction.  In fact, I am in disagreement with Dogfish on this one. The bottle reads, ""A full bodied brown ale brewed with real pumpkin, brown sugar, allspice, cinnamon and nutmeg""  Fullbodied, check. Brown ale? I would argue it is an ESB (and a good one at that) but the hops are overpowering. The pumpkin, I am barely detecting which is not uncommon as it has a mild flavor. I am tasting no brown sugar, and just a trace of cinnamon. I was really hoping these flavors would have been more pronounced.  Toward the bottom of the pint glass, I am getting more of the flavor and I am not ruling out that my slightly stuffy nose is stopping me from getting all of the potential from this beer. [Turned out to be the case!] I have another one left, that I will try it another day and see if I feel differently.

Unlike Blue Moon, Post Road (yes, I know it is brewed by Brooklyn--and I usually really like their products), Dogfish head uses a brown ale base (I'm guessing their Indian Brown), which gives this punkin' a little more complexity and body than some of the competitors. Likewise, the slightly higher ABV (7%) helps cuts a lot of the potentially cloying sweetness created from the allspice, etc., resulting in a tasty seasonal ale. I usually enjoy the punk for about a month, then it is time for it to retire for another year...until the breeze turns crisp and I start to think of Autumn seasonals one more time.

After the 1st one, I didnt care much for it and left the other 3 alone for a few days. Then tonight I decided to revisit it with a fresh palate.  Look: Beautiful clear orange. Fluffy head. Minimal lacing.  Smell: Pumpkin pie, but I think the allspice came to the front pretty aggresively. It smelled tasty though. Sweet, a tad of alcohol, subtle pumpkin. Yummy.  Taste: Smooth, sweet. Goes down easy, and a nice candied aftertaste. Does indeed remind me of pumpkin pie, but I didnt detect much cinnamon. Allspice was prevalent to the point where I thought it was a bit over the top. Alcohol shows up a bit as it warms, but just the right amount to warm me up on a cool fall night. Overall, a good beer, but this style just isnt my cup of tea. A good offering for the style though, so no points taken away due to my personal taste.  Mouthfeel: Light, yet big. Just the right amount of carbonation. Feels like dessert.Very easy drinking. Alcohol hidden well. Maybe Im just used to stronger beers, but this didnt feel like a 7% ABV ale.  Drinkability: I guess fans of the style would enjoy it more than I did, but by my 2nd one, I actually started liking it more than when I first started, so I will give it a good drinkability rating. As I said earlier, just not my cup of tea, but its pretty darn good for what it is.  If you enjoy pumpkin ale, give this one a try from one of the best craft breweries in all the land.

10099,6260,Zorro,4.16,"Sampled due to the efforts of Lackenhauser and The Great Pumpkin BIF.  Pours a good looking chill hazed amber colored ale with a good lasting tan head.  Smell is very malty with a good strong scent of mulling spices. Ginger and allspice are the strongest scents in here. A bit of brown sugar and bread make up the malt part of this beer.  Taste is mild sweetness and bready with a little spice in the first sip. The base flavor of this ale is a good amber ale, on top of which are a candy like extra layer of malts and spices. Flavors of brown sugar and cinnamon, allspice and ginger are present and not so strong that they hide the herbal hops that finish the flavors. Good lingering flavor of ginger and vanilla in the after taste.  Mouthfeel is quite good.  A very good example of a pumpkin beer, but it does have one small flaw. Tasty but the alcohol is all too prominent in this one, doesn't bug me but not everyone will tolerate it in a regular beer.

The taste is similar. I get hints of ginger, all spice and maybe cinnamon. Pumpkin flavor is subdued but present. One thing I like about this beer is that while the pumpkin pie taste is very present, the underlying brown beer is evident and it helps balances the beverage.  A bit to much carbonation may be the only shortcoming (slight) of this beer. Easy enough drinker, but as with most pumpkin beers, two an evening is plenty for me.  Trick or treat? This is one is a treat!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Taste lacked the pumpkin I was looking for. Lots and lots of brown sugar, way too much for my liking. This is overly sweet. Body is on the thin side, even after it warmed. Finish is a little tart almost and the alcohol gets noticed a bit. This just isn't my cup of tea, I had this along with four other pumpkin ales and it didn't really impress.

10099,6260,sjum29,4.54,"I really enjoyed this beer, and despite the heafty price tag for a college budget, ($9 a four-pack) I will definately be purchasing this again.  Punkin' Ale pours a deep, dark orage, almost a true amber. The head is a tan color but is short lived with a little agitation. Its scent is heavenly, like warm baked pumpkin pie. You can pick out the nutmeg easily. As for taste, this is the Pumpkin Ale champ. The brown sugar and nutmeg really hightens the pumpkin flavor giving an aftertaste just like you remember mom making at this time of year. In my opinion, this beer is a little better after it has been out of the fridge for a few minutes and you can really pick up the intricacies of the flavor.  I like the alcohol content as is (for obvious reasons and others). It is masked well and doesn't detract from the beer in any way that I can tell.  Mouthfeel leaves something to be desired. You almost want something this flavorful to be a little thicker. It is more crisp than I anticipated.  Drikability is excellent. I enjoyed 5 of these to myself and still wanted more. You really can't go wrong with this one.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Pours a pleasing tawny caramel color with nonexistant head or lacing. A very nice scent, with spices and sugar prominent, particularly cinammon. Definitely reminds me of pumpkin pie, which of course is the idea. Some of these notes are extant in the flavor but are generally overshadowed by a very strong alcohol taste. If it were me, I'd lower the percentage from seven to five and not strangle the pumpkin flavor as much. Mouthfeel is surprisingly smooth despite the carbonation, which for an ale seems a bit more than I would like. I do think this beer improved as it warmed and more spice is noticeable as I finish it.

While I was writing my note, the head subsided to a dense, quarter inch cover. Very good looking.  Aroma is of pumpkin, brown sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg. Just like it says on the bottle. It's a bit too sweet for my taste, but spices make it stand out.  Taste is a lot hoppier than I expected. Maybe even a bit too bitter. On second try, maybe not. Bitterness kicks in at just the right moment after initial sweet notes.  Interesting beer. Even though it's not exactly my cup o' tea (or rather my pint o' ale), I find it strangely intriguing.

It has little to no head, I'm sure that off the tap it is much different. However as I am drinking it from the bottle I can't really vouch for that.  As soon as i opened this beer I could smell the aroma that it gave off. It has a very potent aroma that can be smelled across the room. Definitely can detect the nutmeg and pumpkin smells here, there are also some other spices which add to the aroma of the beer. Really this is one of the best smelling beers I've ever had, espicially since I could smell it all the way across the room.  In addition to the smell this beer also tastes great. Matter of fact, it tastes just like it smells. The pumpkin and nutmeg are apparent in the taste. I think that this beer would really complement pumpkin pie extremely well. I think that I'll save the rest of these I have for Thanksgiving, seems to me that these would really go great with the finest fall feast in the U.S. (Just thinking about all the wonderfull Turkey Day foods is really making me hungry. It also makes me wish that I knew for a fact that I would have some of this beer on Thanksgiving to see how well it pairs with such foods, I'm sure it will be sweet.)  Feels great in the mouth. The level of carbonation is not excessive, yet this beer is not undercarbonated. The flavor of this beer lingers on the back of the tounge long after you have finished a swallow of this ale.

They also seem to have a rather pronounced fondness for pumpkin pie, and I think they get that from me. So it has always struck me as odd that I don't particularly care for pumpkin beers. It's not that I think they are bad, they just simply aren't my style (kind of like capri pants).  Appearance: A lovely deep brown, almost the color of a pumpkin pie after you've loaded it to the gills with molasses, brown sugar, evaporated milk and sweet, sweet love.  Smell: A malty sweetness runs primary through my nose, and just underneath it, whispering ""Look at me!"" is the faintest hint of cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice.  Taste: Huh. I expected the spiciness to be far more dominant than it is in this beer. It's actually almost an afterthought. The lable states that they add brown sugar along with the spices, and that's really the predominant flavor. Like the nose, there is a very faint hint of cinnamon, etc. hanging around in the background, but it's just barely noticeable.  Mouthfeel: With the added sugar, I would have expected a much fuller textured beer. This is oddly thin in body, much more so than I would have expected.  Drinkability: Well, still not my style.

Bready pumpkin pie, nutmeg and raisins fill the nose. Flavor is reminiscent of Irish soad bread (could be the raisins again) and darker fruits, a hint of anise(?) to go along with a so-unartificial pumpkin flavor and spices. Hops and alcohol are present in the finish; a nice compliment to the chewy malt. Finishes slightly dry, leaving you wanting more, provided you're into the kickass pumpkin ale you're imbibing.

I wanted this beer to be luscious and velvety, like a pie, but it just evaporates in your mouth after the initial good flavor, except for the barest hint of a cinnamon aftertaste.

The brown sugar is very present, without making the beer overly sweet, if that makes sense.

I didn't want to have to wait until next year.  Pour/Appearance - Medium body pour with fairly heavy carbonation. Carbonation is tough to see though due to cloudiness. Color is a warm amber. Head disappeared quickly. Smell - Slight hint of alcohol through the hearty spiced pumpkin smell. Taste - Yumm. Ever had a seasonal gingersnap cookie? Mix in some pumpkin there you have it. Nutmeg, ginger and, of course, pumpkin overtones. Feel - Hits the palate evenly and the spices linger on the sides. Feels like a light beer, but the warmth makes it seem heavier. Very smooth. Drinkability - Due to the spicyness, not to be drank all day/night. It is a seasonal to enjoy when the time is right.

Warming certainly kicks the aromatics up somewhat, but I feel the ""punkin"" essence, as well as the accompanying spices, are somewhat unwilling to emerge from the glass. This understated style, done purposely, rewards the recipient of this fine seasonal with great drinkability and never the feeling of being overwhelmed by what could be easily overdone enhancements. From the glass, essence of root beer and sarsaparilla are most prominent with a touch of nutmeg as well. The flavor is well balanced with a fine bright acidity that really makes for a lively mouthfeel; and a fine effervescence accompanying this taste sensation.

Allspice and nutmeg are the most present, but pumpkin and brown sugar are there, too. Nice.  Big on nutmeg and malt in the front, fading into a sweet malt with hints of pumpkin in the back. Warms me up like a hug, like a good autum beer should.  Nice, is all I can say. Wish I had bought more than one.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,malty,4.2,"Pours a clear burnished orange with a hint of copper. Visible carbonation rushing upward forming a thin beige head.  Aroma of cinnamon, pumpkin pie & nutmeg wrapped around a nice toasted malt backdrop.  Bright flavors of the aforementioned aromas. Nice balance of the sweet side: brown sugar & roasted malts AND the spicy side: nutmeg, allspice and the generous amount of dry, prickly hops.  Mouthfeel is very vibrant thanks to the healthy amount of boisterous (but not overdone) carbonation. Medium bodied with a nice spicy, somewhat faint dry and long finish.  Drinkability is good. Very drinkable for a spiced beer, where usually it's ONE AND DONE - but not here.  Overall this is one sturdy and well crafted pumpkin ale. I'm starting to look very much toward seeing this ale surface in my town this time of year - well worth the wait. This is probably the best bottled pumpkin ale I've had in my 10+ years of drinking craft brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Bought the 4 pack at Total Wine and Beverage on Midlothian in Richmond, VA.  Poured with about 1/2 inch head, great aroma of the spices. Not overpowering with any of the spices on taste, just enough of each and pumpkin to make it a good seasonal brew.

10099,6260,rousee,4.45,"This thing blows away the 04 version. There was a recent thread about the best pumpkin beers and I know the longbeach one (darren not snoop) hates them as he has made quite clear. Both Darren and Snoop need to try this one. It is not overly pumpkin-ish or pie spices laden. Clearly the best of the 05 lot locally available here in the bottle. The CBC version is a little too flat and the Smutty is a tad to pumpkinny. The BBW one is real good too. I think this one is better in drinkability.  Tasting notes-- pumpkin color, taste and smell but there is clearly a good amount of those familiar dfh hops. They do a good job with their hops/ malt balance as I believe they use ringwood yeast which I am not a fan of. They do well as far as I am concerned, so no need to fix something thats not broken.  I do believe that DFH is/has expanded too quickly as I think they can be inconsistent. But when you get down to it or not, DFH is a prety good brewer.

Spices are not overwhelming, however. Amazingly, this beer has a hint of hops in the finish - much different from other pumpkin ales I have had. Fuller bodied than most others as well.

The allspice and nutmeg are the predominates.  T - A little pumpkin, a lot of spice. Nothing like cinnamon and brown sugar in a beer to make you smile. It has that Spaten Optimator sweet note to it.  M - Very thin and watery for texture, there is very little carbonation, but still lends a tingle on the surfaces. Typical ale as far as mouth feel is concerned.  D - Drinkability is middle of the road, it goes down easy and smooth, but afterwards you won't be amped for another.

Pours an attractive ruddy amber/brown with a short khaki bubbly head. Smells delicious, sweet and spicey, caramel malts maybe a little bubblegum. Taste is much more like genuine pumpkin pie and less like pumpkin puree compared to O'Fallon's offering. Caramel malts lay down the brown ale backbone, with well-integrated infusions of nutmeg, cinnamon, and pumpkin pie filling. This is a desert of a beer. On the sweet side, but does so quite well. Mouthfeel is full for a brown, but still velvety smooth. I could drink a couple more of these no problem, but probably not more than that. This is a damn tasty brew, easily superior to O'Fallon.

Taste is a nice blend of pumpkin, allspice, and ginger...a hefty dose of malt and a bitter hop finish.

Cinnamon and allspice fronnt a bold array of pie spices that assault the nose. Not at all timid. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with strong carbonation and some spicy bite. Tastes like pumpkin pie, with some essence of fresh pumpkin, caramel malt, and aggressive pie spicing. Some mild heat from the 7% abv adds to the fresh baked pumpkin pie effect. Spices dominate all the way through, however, and are a bit overdone.

Appearance: Pours a red-brown color with a light haze. Head is thin, but resiliant.  Smell: Pumpkin pie in a glass - heavy on the spices, with just a hint of alcohol coming through as well.  Taste: Again - pumpin pie. Starts off with a very creamy mouthfeel and an almost buttery taste. The spices come in and blend well with the malt sweetness.

Smell -- Pumpkin. This is the first pumpkin beer I've actually smelled pumpkin. Weak scent of pumpkin pie spices and cloves.  Taste -- Not bad. This is probably the best pumpkin beer I've tried this season (I've also tried Lakefront and New Holland). It faintly reminds me of pumpkin pie. You can definitely taste the pumpkin here.  Mouthfeel -- Medium and slightly astringent. Slight carbonation.  Drinkability -- Of all of the pumpkin beers I've tried this year, this is the most drinkable.

Anyway, I liked this beer when I had it last year, I really like it now.  The overall impression here is that this is a beer first and foremost. A tasty and slightly strong brown ale, with some spiciness from the alcohol, and strong malty flavor. Aroma smells faintly like pumpkin pie filling. The pumpkin and spices are always creeping around the edge, blending well with the traditional malty beer flavors of raisins, grape juice, chocolate and caramel. This is a sweet beer, but never overwhelmingly so. I can't detect much hop flavor or aroma, but the bittering hops are certainly doing their job to keep the other flavors from getting out of hand.  Mouthfeel is very creamy. Carbonated to perfection I think. I also dig the light brown color of the beer, which seems to have a tinge of orange.  My favorite pumpkin beer. Well, one of two that are distributed in my town, so I guess that's not saying much.

10099,6260,Gueuzedude,3.88,"Pours a brilliantly clear, ruby-amber color and is topped by a frothy, large bubbled tan colored head. The aroma is lightly spiced with notes of nutmeg, sweet brown sugar and allspice. The beer has a certain satisfying fullness to the palate, a far cry from the thin wan limp body on the Buffalo Bills version, which lightly coats the mouth as the beer goes down. The beer is lightly sweet with a brown sugar like note and a bit of caramel. The spices are evident, yet at a bearable level, such that they dont dominate this beer. I get notes of nutmeg, allspice, perhaps some soft cinnamon, caramel, molasses, slight ginger in the finish, and perhaps a hint of pumpkin-like vegetal flavor. Because of the spices, this beer finishes with a light astringency, and perhaps a bit of hotness.  The spicing level and the fullness of this beer designate this a bit more than a quaffing brew, slow sips seem mandatory, and I would be hard pressed to down a glass of this beer. This is all ok though, as I dont mind savoring the interplay of spice and caramelized sugar notes. Where is the pumpkin? I am not too sure, as is typical in spiced versions the pumpkin is really not noticeable. This beer is quite enjoyable and is one of the better examples of the style that I have had.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Bready malt is noticeable as well.  Lots of spices everywhere on the palate, including hop spiciness. Bready malt takes a backseat to the pumpkin, brown sugar, allspice, and cinnamon. Hops prevail towards the end with a crisp, spicy bite. Spices don't overpower since the hops keep them in line. Lasting bitterness in the aftertaste.  Good carbonation and hops give this a nice, crisp mouthfeel.  A pretty well-balanced pumpkin beer. I think I like it a little better than the Cottonwood one, which I drank a few of last year at this time before our ABV cap was lifted.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Smell: The smell is awesome. Light pumpkin in the nose. A lot of spices are in the aroma which make this awesome. I can really smell the cinnamon and nutmeg. The malt kicks in and mixes with the spiciness of the spices. Fantastic!  Taste: Sweet at first. Spices kick in fast. This beer reminds me more of a Christmas beer. The hops leave a strange bitterness towards the end. The alcohol then kicks in to leave some dry spiciness.  Mouthfeel: A little thin but a decent consitency  Overall a very good beer.

Aroma is very spicy, with notes of nutmeg, cinammon and allspice. Smells sweet, with maybe some pumpkin aroma in there. It's so spicy I can't really determine hop smells.  Flavor is spicy; cinammon, allspice and nutmeg all come through nicely. There is some hop bitterness there, but not much. Nor is there a detectable hop flavor. Not real sure what pumpkin would taste like in a beer, but this tastes different. Pretty much residual sugar, but not cloying; I like this. Pumpkin flavor, (I guess), is subtle. Aftertaste is spicy and sort of sweet.  Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with decent carbonation. Something is resiny on the tongue; not sure what it is. Finish is sweet and resiny.  This is my first pumpkin ale, and I'd have to say it's pretty good. The spices are pronounced, but not overbearing. The pumpkin is somewhat muted, but present.

Smell is nicely subdued, but the cinnamon, nutmeg, and pumpkin all come through pretty clearly on top of a solid malt backbone and against a slightly bitter hop scent.  Flavor is slightly sweet and heavy on the nutmeg and allspice over the pumpkin, but this is often the case in pumpkin ales and doesn't really bother me. It's by no means an overspiced mess.

The beer has a great sweet overtone that's just festive enough to be a good pumkin... and the cinnamon/nutmeg really comes through, maybe a little more than the pumkin does. I need to say again, it tastes oh so yummy if you like the pumkin-pie in a bottle feel that you get from pumkin ales.

Smell: Spices predominate. The cinnamon and nutmeg flavors mix with a fruity orange / pumpkin essence. As it warms, caramel and fruity overtones make their presence with the pumpkin coming in strongly at the end of the glass. Taste: The hoppy bitterness and spices predominate over the maltiness and sweetness in a pleasant way. The pumpkin flavor comes at mid mouthfeel, finishing with the spiciness from the nutmeg and cinnamon. The finish is clean with subtle lingering hop bitterness. Mouthfeel: Medium to light body for this 7% alc. by vol. ale.

Thin head that all but disappears, but leaves just enough to protect the pumpkiny goodness.  Smell: Never did I think you could actually smell the pumpkin in a pumpkin ale, but it's here. Unmistakable. No hops in the nose, and that's spot on for a pumpkin ale.  Taste: Dogfish does it again. I seem to remember last year's batch being a little sweeter, but this is very nice as well.

Along with the great Aprihop, Punkin' is one of the best fruit beers out there, and one of my favorite beers overall. Pumpkin is such a nice fruit to blend with beer. It doesn't overwhelm the beer or add cloying sweetness. It mixes perfectly with hops and other beer flavors. Punkin has nice spices, a subtle sweetness, a fantastic smell, and an aftertaste that is complex and endlessly pleasurable. I love this beer. Its use of pumpkin is nuanced enough to allow this to be a session beer. Although it's seasonal, it could be sipped year-round.

The aroma is mostly that of the spices, with cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice notes, but more subtly applied than is usual for a pumpkin beer. Tastewise, the pumpkin taste itself is very mild, and the spice is applied sparingly enough that it complements the malt flavors of the beer without overpowering them. Similarly, it has a nice smooth mouthfeel, with very little tannic feel from the spices. Very smooth, and pleasant.

The rear of the nose was spicey cinnamon.  The drink started with a swift kick of pumpkin followed by cinnamon and hop spice the finish was a quick wash of carbonation followed by a lingering sweet sugar flavor.  This was one of the most creative beers I've ever encountered. It's almost like liquid pumpkin pie with beer. Hell, what more do you need! Go find this beer if you can.

Smells of spices, cinnamon and nutmeg mostly is what I get. Taste is not quite there, and there is a slight oxidized/vegetal/wet cardboard aftertaste. No hops that I can taste are present. Nice creamy mouthfeel, and very clean. A clean beer, but not something I'd search out again, especially at $2.59 a bottle.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

I had my first five, yeah five, Punkin in November 2004 and was not impressed. It was a decent brown ale but not a Pumpkin Ale. This bottle, however, was exceptional. A nice, clear amber beer with a sturdy two finger head that stuck to the glass and laced all the way down. Wonderful cinammon in the nose and on the tongue. Delicate, fruity hops in the finish created the need for another sip. I could have drank this all night but only had two left.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,mentor,4.45,"Thanks to Prostman for providing me the opportunity to try this one. Consumed Jan 2005 with a bottle date of 2005. Hard pour to get a half-finger light cream head over an orange nearly clear beer. Smells of pumpkin pie spices...what did you expect? Nutmeg, clove, a zing (from ginger perhaps), very mild cinnamon, but no malt character to speak of. Tastes sweet with gentle pumpkin pie spicing and an interesting carmelly fruity (not quite apricot, but something along those lines) that comes in late and hangs around. Very nice...too many pumpkin beers are all spice with nothing underneath to save them. This one is very sweet initially on the front of the tongue followed quickly by delightful clove, cinnamon, and nutmeg spicing . Later I get a caramel and yeah, some actual pumpkin. My goodness I'm not sure I've ever tasted pumpkin in a pumpkin beer. Seems like the spicing is always so heavy there's nothing left of my tastebuds to pick out that flavor. Nice job, gentlemen. One downside to this beer is at the very end and partly into the aftertaste, I do get some wet cardboard flavor. The ending is very sweet leaving a wet taste that hangs around on the tongue and makes me happy I'm drinking it. A pumpkin beer. I'm happy I'm drinking it. Dogs and cats living together! Medium thick body with mild carbonation...both of which work to make a creamy character that makes this beer delightful.  The beer has now warmed and I'll dump the last bit in the glass (saved in case there was sediment). Yeah, I think there was sediment, but not alot. Smell is different now that the beer has warmed. The pumpkin character now prevails and, unfortunately, the wet cardboard has reached the smell. The clove is a bit stronger and the nutmeg a bit gentler, but it could be my taste buds acclimating. I'm also getting a faint nutty flavor that goes along with the caramel. This is a really good beer and I'm sad I have just one fine gulp left.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

No head at all, just a thin white ring at the edges. Wonderfully spicey scents with a ton of raisin coming out. Karo sweetness. Makes me think of eggnog, must be the nutmeg that just wafts out of it. Such a nice smooth mouthfeel, the carbination gives it a bit of bite, but it really is just a perfect feel . This is just the right amount of carbination for me, not too much, just enough for the style. Malty and spicey, almost tastes a bit peppery at times. Caramelly/honey sweeness, but not intensely so. The spices really come out alot in the end, you are left with alot of clovey-nutmeg flavor in your mouth. This has been a longtime favorite of mine since the first try, and I have always described this as being like having a bite of pumpkin pie and following it up with a sip of good ale.  This was a Christmas gift from my Father, who is appreciating all the beer I have been letting him explore with... -My Dad who thought that he was finally a beer snob when he found Molson, but now is obsessed with Double Bastard!

Aroma features a dash of pumpkin spice and malt, and some slight fruity esters. The aroma is a little underwhelming in its intensity, however. The flavor is very nice, featuring a full bodied beer definitely tilted toward malt with complimentary pumpkin spice flavors taking the place of strong hoppy notes.

The taste was slightly sweet (brown sugar) up front followed by a tangy maltiness with a touch of spices (allspice and cinnamon?) and hops in the finish. There was a touch of alcohol and the hop bitterness and spices lingered in the finish. The mouthfeel was smooth and tangy with medium body and moderate carbonation with some pumpkin texture.

There is a definite spice aroma to this brew--nutmeg is the most prominent, followed by cinammon and cloves. A sweet caramel malt joins in as well. This is a nice smelling beer.  The taste is sweet and spicy and a bit nutty in the mouth (pardon the Austin Powers reference). The finish is punctuated by a slight touch of alcohol. As it warms, there is an almost roasted malt flavor in the finish. Very nice.  This is a pretty thin beer for a seasonal. However, the flavor counters the lack of ""substance"" in this beer. You can really sense the hops in the finish--they are not obnoxious but assertive enough to balance the sweetness of this beer.  This is a good Pumkin beer--it is not overwhelmingly sweet but a very nice example of the style.

Nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice and some lingering malt and a lot of alcohol as it warms. Doesn't sell like pumpkin pie to me though it does remind you of the season.  Taste is nice, a little spicy, a lot of alcohol, doesn't taste like a bear. More like a special mixed drink. Not bad. Great season brew. Has a real nice light mouth taste with just a nip of spice after taste. I might drink two, but no more. Then, I dont think the folks at Dogfish Head thought they were brewing a session beer.

Aroma is spicy with cinnamon and nutmeg, reminding me of a Xmas ale which I brewed many years back (I hated it so all my friends drank it)..no real pumpkin aroma. A touch of smoky ham becomes evident when swirled, and is the best part of this brew. Carbonation is mild to moderate. Mouthfeel is soft with a medium-dense body. Taste starts with off-putting herbal hops, followed by the nauseating spices, followed by amber malt husk bitterness, brown sugar alcohol bleh, and nasty Dogfish Head ruddiness.

Only slight bitterness. Medium body with moderate carbonation. Good mouthfeel, not overly carbonated like other pumpkin brews. This is the best of the pumpkin beers that I have tasted.

Fades after initial burst to a light cinnamon and spice aroma.  Taste - lots of spice, mostly cinnamon. The pleasantries of pumpkin pie are abruptly, if not expectedly, hit by a hefty dose of hops. There's enough malt to contribute to a toasty, mellow spiced aftertaste. Warming alcohol notes at the end as well and the occasional detection of brown sugar. Always the unique style interpretation from DFH. I could use less hops, but the abv makes for a nice winter-type warmer.  Mouthfeel - heavier body, alcohol-induced vapory residue. A cut above.

There may be some carapils malt here that add a base sweetness, but the spices win the day. There is a nice bitter finish, suggesting a pretty darn good hop presence. Mouthfeel: Nicely balanced -- not at all cloying, but not thin or watery either. The palatte is left with a great cornacopia of wonderful spices. Drinkability: Very good.

After drinking a few bottles of Post Road Pumpkin Ale this year, I have realized that these beers have to be warmed up close to room temperature, before they become truly enjoyable, so thats how I am going to do it.  The pour was clear, and orange in color with a fizzy head that vanished pretty rapidly. On par with the other pumpkin ales Ive tried in terms of the looks.  The aroma had the pumpkin pie effect going, with brown sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg mingled in with pumpkins.  The taste was light and spicy, with the pumpkin pie flavor, and some hop bitterness.

Darker than true pumpkin, Punkin' is also lighter than the brown ale it partially claims to be on the bottle. A poofy head on a very vigorous pour and none on a pedestrian pour. No lace.  Hints of brown sugar about on the nose, with a bit of fishy pumpkin. Heavy cinammon and nuts as well.  The taste is like most pumpkin ales, a liquefied Gingerbread cookie. But in DFH's model the hops keep everything interesting and prickly. Lots of herbally biting hop to shut up the cookie quality of the style.

If there was such a thing as allspice candy, it would taste like this beer smells. Also some dry thickness in the background.  Tastes not nearly as spicy or sweet as the nose portended. Round and excellently mellow. Taste is set up as a combination of sweet and flavorful and dry and hoppy.

The color is gorgeous with nearly no haze contributed from the starchy, beer-unfriendly pumpkin. In my head, I like to think the gourd is actually adding something to this beer because, though the spices are so wonderfully controlled, there is a long, lingering element of pumpkin pie that goes beyond the spices.  Beer first, Punkin comes to rely on the alcohol as it warms with a growing, Colheita-like emergence of toasted walnuts and almonds as well as dried berries. Though only 7%, the overall dryness of this beer leaves it open the torturesome nuance of truth -- everything that is in this beer is clearly revealed, from the spices and chocolately malt to the grassy 60 Minute IPA-like hops and dry adjunct.

I poured the cool beer into my trusty Bellevue tulip glass and began the festive beer season in style.  Pours slightly darker than lipton iced tea with a lite reddish hue. Very light tan head was hard to get going. It dissipated quickly to a sticky ring that lasted all the way through. No carbonation to speak of.  Smell was straight up pumpkin with a bit of brown sugar sweetness and the previously mentioned spices in there generally muted.  Sorry, I expect these pumpkin beers and Xmas beers to just be more spicey. I am very glad that Dogfish didn't go overboard with the hops and destroy the good malty bomb that is here. The pumpkin sets a nice chewy malty undertone that sticks throughout. It originally rushes in with the brown sugar sweetness and then finishes with a very faint wisper of cinnamon and all spice. The spices were very muted, like a pumpkin pie with a teaspoon added where there should be a table spoon.  Mouthfeel was medium to heavy given the stickiness.

It's not a doctored pumpkin taste. It leaves a wonderful aftertaste in my mouth as well. Nice and spicy with a wonderful pumpkin taste that is not overpowering.  Mouthfeel is good and this baby goes down smooth. A few of these on a cold fall evening would be wonderful. Drinkability is good as well.

This is not like some others of this style which I had just tried which taste like an alcoholic pumpkin-pie flavored beverage. This is a nice ale with just enough of a suggestion of pumpkin and spice to remind me that it's autumn.  All the flavors that should be there are there... the malt and pumpkin combine to give a warm toasty and slightly sweet & fruity flavor, while the nutmeg and cinnamon compliment rather than overwhelm the very present hops. Definitely not a novelty creation, but a beer that celebrates the season.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,Suds,4.29,"Ive come to really appreciate and anticipate the annual apperance of pumpkin beers. This ones an outstanding example of the class. Pours a clear, dark-copper color with a thin white head. Brown-sugar, pumpkin, and pie spices compose the aroma. The spiciness is folded nicely into a faint alcohol smell. As you work through the glass, nutmeg seems to stand out as the dominant spice. Pleasing alcohol warming (nice in the Autumn outdoors). The pumpkin taste is present all the way through the taste. Finish is rather hoppy for a pumpkin beer. Overall, this is one of the beer pumpkin beers Ive had.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Steeped into me pint with a clear, we're talking crystal clear, yet dark orange almost russett hued pour under a wafer thin off white crescent moon shaped head followed by a few small bubbles.  Scents hit a ""fork in the road"" here. There are surely some pumpkin inside scoops mash that meet some spicey cinnamon and nutmeg notes. While deep inhalations bring nearly off phenolics and band-aids, the pumpkin pie aromas lead the show, quite nicely.  First swigs: Blasts of malty pumpkin and pie crusts take over, perhaps to the best of my imagination, but DFH has been known to pull flavor stunts before so this won't go passed them. Some estery, 7% ABV, awl-kee-hawl vinous wafts greet the tongue. Slight warming temperatures evolve into esters.  Thin to a medium at best feel. Not a heavy brew. Malts and pumpkin go back 'n forth. Hops? Helll-oooo???  Last swigs: BA thanks to GeoffFromSJ for swappin' brews. Pumpkin pie filling meets basic wine spritzer and spices. This cn be mixed with 60 Minute to make a balanced brew.

The appearance is a burnt orange, very clear..the smell has a faint hint of nutmeg and alcohol. There was not much head when poured into the glass.  The taste was a bit overwhelming...maybe too strong for a pumpkin ale, at least as compared to other brands. The strength of the beer seems to drown out the pumpkin (and pumpkin-related..nutmeg, allspice, etc.) flavors.

The nose of the beer is strong but not overwhelming, and leaves enough room for you mouth to make up its own conclusion. The finish was very nice, and not too long.

10099,6260,rdrummer,4.39,"Without a doubt, the best pumpkin ale that I have tried. This is a kick. It pours a rather ordinary, weak tea color with a nice head. The ordinariness ends there. The aroma is of an uncooked pumpkin pie. There is a definite pumpkin smell but there are hints of rum, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and malt all blended in a real pie-like blend.  At this point, I was almost ready to stop without tasting it, figuring that it couldn't be as good to taste as to smell. I was wrong. This a well-blended pumpkin pie in a glass but without the cloying sweetness. In fact, there was considerably more hops bitterness than I expected. With the first sip, the spices described above come through but from the first they are balanced by the presence of a decent amount of hops. The malt accentuates the pumpkin flavor and balances the hops.  This is a full-bodied ale that is very pleasant, and before I knew it the second bottle was gone.  Pours a deep beautiful orange into the glass with a note of spice in the nose. I kind of smell a slight pumpkin aroma, but don't really know if I'm reading into the beer or if it is really there. The taste is spicy. Good and strong, with the spices being mellowed out by the malt backbone. The funny thing is that I think I taste pumpkin, which I haven't been able to in other pumpkin ales I've had in the past. Consider this, the spices are reminiscent of Thanksgiving, mixed in with the hops, and the malt backbone has that pumpkin roundness so that it is like being transplanted from IPA land to the dessert table on your favorite November holiday. The aftertaste is of banana peel and cloves, but not in that Hefeweizen way, more in that bitter way that hoplovers would find interesting.  The funny thing is that it is very drinkable, actually superb, but the pumpkin thing just brings you back to that one time of year. Perhaps if it were different, then it would be different. But alas and alack.... Mouthfeel is nice. The aftertaste leaves that umami sensation in your mouth, o you really can't complain. Though some may call this a novelty beer, it could gain acceptance if people would shake their associations with Thanksgiving.

The aroma is all pumpkin pie spices: nutmeg, big-time cinnamon, and a big waft of allspice. Maybe even some spicy hoppiness in there as well. Taste is really great for a pumpkin ale - it's mainly a very spicy tasting brew up front, then some sweet candied pumpkin and then a nice bitter finish that lingers for a while. Like one forum poster said, ""pumpkin pie in a glass."" No doubt about it. This would sit perfectly against a plate of turkey on Thanksgiving Day. Mouth is medium to full, slightly oily and smooth.

Mild vegetal aroma of pumpkins, and a underlying layer of sweetness, notably caramel.  Tastes lightly sweet up front, lots of dark sugary backing and spices build up steam. Nutmeg and all-spice come in strong and cinnamon takes the finish with a tingling bitterness on the sides of the toungue. Pumpkin flavor is all there, well produced and easy to follow. Finishes is lightly bitter with some lingering sweetness.  Medium-full body, smooth and creamy with adequate carbonation. Nothing to the extremes, but a nice sparkling touch.

It is true that it exudes pumpkin pie smell and taste, and you can pick out lots of spicy notes, but you can also taste the malt and the hops. Wow!! As for drinkability, I tried to have two in a row, and there is no doubt this one is at 7% ABV. If I don't need to do anything after drinking, the drinkability index improves, but otherwise, one in a session is probably enough. I'll need to pick up a few more 4 packs.

Aroma is pretty much assumed in this style of beer. I thought it was nice and balanced but not a lot of depth to it. The thing I liked about the taste of this beer is that it actually had a pumpkin taste to it and not overloaded with spice.

Strangely lacking flavor (other than sweetness) in the mouth, but the aftertaste is quite complex with the spice and bitterness really coming through.  I'm having this beer in a flight of pumpkin ales (a New England specialty, it appears). I'm not a big fan of sugary beers, like scotch ale.

This pumpkin ale is sweeter and maltier than the only other I have for recent comparison, which is the Smuttynose Pumpkin. There are nice hints of allspice, clove, and maybe cinnamon. The beer also finishes quite dry with a very earthy pumpkin flavor. A Dogfish Head guy (owner, I think?) was at the bar, and gave a little summary of the beer, saying something about fermenting the natural sugars in the pumpkin flesh, which I would imagine contributes to this quality. Anyway, I thought this beer was highly drinkable for a pumpkin ale, and if I wasn't at the Blind Tiger with so many other brews to choose from, I could have knocked back a few more.

10099,6260,UnionMade,3.25,"The beer pours a hazy glowing orange. Backlit, it turns a fiery shade of cinnamon, brightened by the suspended yeast pour, topped with a thin, scattered, off white mist. I poured the beer into a belgian style tulip goblet, which usually creates a healthy froth of head, but this quickly dropped into a medium sized collar, with a tight swirl of mist in the middle. No lace. I suppose the lack of head retention could be attributed to the alcohol and lack of hop presence. The color is spectacular, easily a 5 if there was a better head. The aroma is very spicy and rich. Plenty of toasty caramel malt is boosted by a well spiced pumpkin pie blend. The ginger is very apparent, along with nutmeg. Some cinnamon adds a whiff of fireball candy, with perhaps a bit of brown sugar. Not too much in the way of actual pumpkin, if anything, more or less just the spices. No apparent hops. It reminds me of going to my grandmother's house when i was little and opening the spice cabinet, just standing on a chair inhaling the cacaphony of exotic aromas and looking at the strange little bottles and leaves wrapped in paper. Bright oranges, dull greens, and earthen browns. The flavor starts with a pleasantly toasty caramel maltiness, riding all the way through the sip. The spices come in immediately, with cinnamon and brown sugar lending a spicy sweetness. Perhaps a bit of squash in the middle, with a slight ginger tang that grows steadily into the finish. Just a hint of cookie dough yeastiness. The brown sugar remains throughout, somewhat like belgian candi sugar in it's placement. A bit of ginger spiciness, along with a mild nutmeg bite, make up the finish. It blends nicely with the caramel malt, creating a feel not unlike liquid pumpkin pie. A fog of boozey alcohol adds a slight tingle to the finish, numbing the tongue slightly, reminding oneself of it's rather potent alcohol content. A faint saccharine sweetness in the aftertaste, coupled with assertive ginger, creates an almost artificial flavor. Similar to a fireball candy after a plate of sushi. The beer is fairly big bodied, I'd say on the portly side of medium, but easily carried by a sparkly, boisterous carbonation. A bit cloying overall, particularly in the finish, with a sugary feel throughout. One bottle of this is quite enough for me. One of, if not the biggest, seasonal pumpkin ales out there. Perhaps a bit over-wrought, with too much spiced sweetness. I feel like I'm drinking a candy store, especially when it warms up. Perhaps a bit more punkin and grainy malt, and less allspice and brown sugar. I can appreciate the effort and laud the inventiveness, but it's not for me.

10099,6260,marburg,4.25,"Allspice. Fascinating stuff.  The first thing I did after opening this beer was to go sniff a bowl in my sink. That might seem kind of an odd thing to be doing after opening a beer. But it's not: This evening I made chicken shawarma sandwiches.  That probably doesn't clarify much. So let me explain: In the marinade for the sandwiches, I use allspice, cardamom, yogurt, and vinegar. And the sweet, balanced, spicy aroma that marches through my nostrils after leaving the marinade bowl is the same damn thing I'm smelling in this beer. Must be the allspice, even though I only use like 4 friggin granules of spice in the recipe. Quite an astonishing comparison though.  So that gives you an idea. The spices really shine through here -- pumpkin pie, cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger. (Duh.) One might think that such an infusion of those types of flavors would lead to an overly sweet, unbalanced, undrinkable brew. Really, it's the opposite. The sweetness is matched, harnessed, and played upon beautifully. And it results in one of the best, easiest-to-drink beers I've had in a while.

Off-white head leaves a little lace as it fades to a film. Transparent amber colored beer with an orange hue. The pumpkin pie aroma carries over into the flavor, but isn't as strong. There's some hops down there that can't quite make it to the surface. It's not as thick as the aroma suggests, the flavor is pretty strong but doesn't stick to your tongue, I wouldn't call the finish clean, but it doesn't hang around long either. It definitely leans more towards the pumpkin pie end with spices present. Loads of flavor and aroma are probably too much for half the beer drinkers out there.

The mid-palate is still pretty gross but the finish has calmed and grown to be quite complex and lovely with banana creme pie cast as the most prominent ""actor"" in the play called ""To Please My Mouth.""  The mouthfeel has also grown to be quite lovely. Very full in the mouth.  Quite ""alcoholic"" in its linger.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,sideshowrob,3.78,"This brew was a big surprise in the Pumpkin ale style. The line I shall plagerize from another reviewer (Ale Street?) is that ""It is the only Pumpkin beer I'd have twice"".  Dogfish did a great job with this brew. The pumpkin is well balanced with a strong sweet backing (brown sugar?). The combination works well. Very easy beer to drink, though even at a holloween event, it was hard to drink more than two. This is far more than a simple ""me too"" beer brewed with pumpkin, it's a beer that very well might define this niche style. Though not really something I'd normally do with a brew, I have discovered that this a great beer to cook with!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Smells wonderful pumpkin, nutmeg, allpice and touch of cinnamon, Thanksgiving in a bottle had a couple of bottles with Thanksgiving dinner went well, saved a couple for review as you can see I tend to procrastinate. Only got to try three pumpkin brews this year due to my location in Budwiser is King land this one tasted the most spicey of the three. Great fall brew but, wouldn't drink on regular basis, as I would the other pumpkin ale I reviewed.

Pours a medium brownish with some golden ruby highlights and a sort of khaki head. Smell is of spice and a bit of vegetable and pumpkin. The taste is pumpkiny up front and then just melds into a spicy malty mess followed by a drying hop finish that just jumps the train off the track. Drinkabilty was low as i was able to finish the beer, but wasnt going begging for another. Not one of the best pumpkin beers I had last year.

The taste is mostly cinnamon, though the malt keeps the cinnamon from dominating, and keeps the balance enough to make this more than a mere novelty. Mouthfeel is average. Drinkability-wise, could have a few more, though would be too sweet after a long while.  Definitely the best pumpkin ale out there.

As far as pumpkin ales go, this was one of the better ones I had. Good cinnamon/nutmeg scent to it. Looked beautiful in the glass, orange-amber color.

Understated cinnamon and ripe fig esters as well. Very well rounded and appetizing aromawise. In flavor, a browned butter drizzled toasted biscuit impression is the dominant malt presence. Stately, slightly herbaceous allcpice and citric hop combination is an undertone. Lightly bittered, with balance skewed towards caramel, but sweetness never becomes cloying. Subtle bubblegum esters emerge as it breathes, helping facilitate a candyish overall suggestion. Well calculated and integrated pumpkin spice presence. Full dextrinous body and viscous, but not syrupy in mouthfeel. Finishes with soft alcohol warmth and brown sugar sweetness, lending a lingering spiced hot toddy impression.

It's appearance was a very pretty orange color with a creamy head. The head was big for a few minutes, but then died out to a thick laceing. The smell was it's best feature for me. This had so many different things going on at once, it was mind boggling. There was the always present smell of allspice, but then it gave way to a real pumpkin smell, which isn't present in most brews, and ofcourse it was big malty. The taste was similar to the smell, but stronger in the malt catagory, as well as the actual pumpkin taste. The mouthfeel was nice and creamy, which is something I really dig.

10099,6260,jed,2.75,"Appearance: Pours a light orange, amber color with a small head, no lacing.  Smell: Very sweet and spicy aroma. Clear nutmeg, cinnamon scents. Punkin' smells much spicier than other pumpkin brews and less like the actual dessert.  Taste: Initially sour with very strong allspice, cinnamon, and nutmeg flavors, almost like Old Bay. A hint of hops, and more brown sugar as the beer sits. The sourness fades about halfway through the beer, but you still get a weird, yeast/vegetable aftertaste that spoils the brew.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, with light carbonation. The aftertaste lingers a bit.  Drinkability: I can't see having more than one of these. Taste aside, the 7% alcohol is pretty formidable, especially for a pumpkin beer.  I'm a huge fan of Dogfish Head, but I can't say I care for this beer. It needs more malt or hops to balance the spices, which overpower the brew's taste.

Nice white head forms rather easily but dissipates very quickly. Spicy aromas are prevalent with cinnamon dominating. Very tasty on the first sip I notice very light carbonation which is good because the overall flavor of the beer is very mild. Some body to it but definitely not heavy. Ah, on the swallow the spices come back and I might actually think i just took a bite from a pumpkin pie. This is a very drinkable beer and could be finished very quickly. 7% alcohol? Sure dont taste that. This is a beer that could sneak up on you. Definitely a nice spice beer, but could use a little more boldness in the front end.

This ale has a nice clear pumpkin colored amber-read hue.  The nose is spicy with unmistakable notes of nutmeg and allspice, behind which sprites of cinnamon make themselves known here and there.  The flavor is spicy indeed! Its almost like enjoying a nutmeg laden slice of pumpkin pie. In my opinion, the spices are a bit overpowering-- easily overshadowing the underlying ale character. Perhaps this is what a Pumpkin Ale is all about. As to the Pumpkin, Im not certain my taste buds could detect a definite pumpkin flavor, but Ill take Dogfishs word for it, its there (I still hang on to the image of a fine pumpkin pie). Through all of the spices a bitter hops character emerges, producing an unmistakable ale signature on the flavor profile.  The finish seems to be somewhat short but clean, leaving a wash of hops and bitter on my palate as the ocean tide washes sheets of foam and sea water upon the shallows of the beach, with the ocean being the spices, and the drenched sand being the ale flavor.  Mouthfeel is comfortable, with the forward character of the spices producing the bulk of the sensation.  I have to be honest in that I have not sampled many Pumpkin Ales. Therefore Ill continue to regard these beers as a seasonal treat, somewhat off the beaten path of traditional ales and lagers.

Crusty sweet yet dry. Spice wastes no time arriving. Cinnamon is a no-brainer. It's here by the truck-full. Another truckload of nutmeg. There is nothing dainty about the spicing in this one. It is aggressive, but not overdone nor out of balance. Morphs into straight gingerbread (from the all-spice?). Traces of pumpkin sourness along with some maple syrup. A basically unnoticed herbal bitterness appears late from the hops. It is essentially invisible, but it is just enough to clean the mouth from its spice shackles. Alcohol is not noticed other than the light heat it ignites in the entrace of the throat....or is that from the cinnamon? The just-lighter-than-medium body belies the 7%. This is boldly flavored, yet fairly drinkable. As a general foe of pumpkin beers, I must admit that this has impressed me.

That's my immediate thought, for after just sampling other pumpkin-themed beers, this seems to be the one that's getting it right! The spices that are overflowing and dominant in others are clearly more interested in sharing the spotlight here, it's richer, fuller, creamy, yeasty, complex. Taste: again, just right! They hit the nail on the head here, choosing a full-bodied brown ale as the base, so you get the cinnamon and allspice, the pumpkin, and in this case, the brown sugar, but there's still a significant beer underneath, and in this case, a much sturdier, tastier, creamier brown ale than most. A most welcome flood of flavors, smooth, but substantial, thoroughly filling the mouth and washing it with warm, sweet, pumpkinny goodness. Soft, tasty finish. I enjoyed every last drop!

10099,6260,Dantes,4.12,"Package: 12 oz. crowned brown bottle. Parchment-colored, pumpkin-tinged label describing a brown ale with pumpkin, brown sugar, allspice, cinnamon & nutmeg. Listed at 7% ABV. Notched at 04 (Oct. 4?).  Cost: $6.99 (!) per 4-pack at Bottle King  Presentation: Shaker pint at ~45º  Appearance: Poured an appropriate pumpkin-orange with a crystal-clear body. A vigorous pour generated a medium-dense head that resolved down to a thin foam slick leaving some lace.  Smell: This has a whole heck of a lot going on. The nose is sweet in the forefront, quickly trailed by a complex cocktail of easily distinguishable spices including cinnamon and allspice. Brown ale base provides some nuttiness and autumnal refulgence.  Taste: Excellent flavor. Unlike many brewers who start with an austere pale ale, DFH astutely chose to base this on a brown ale, giving it a good base to compete with the full-flavored pumpkin and spice elements. The pumpkin flavor is full and natural, unlike the harsh brews seemingly flavored by extracts. The brown ale contributes a moderate toastiness with some nut flavors. These are capped by the rich pumpkin leavened by the noticeable cinnamon and the more subtle nutmeg and allspice. It all comes together very well in a rich but not cloying brew. The flavor improves as the beer warms, although the finish is a bit marred by an overly-hopped, clashing bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Despite all the goings on, this beer had a medium body, allowing one to enjoy several in a sitting. The carbonation is perhaps a bit harsh, but I suppose it combats any tendency for the beer to become cloying.  Drinkability: With a relatively high 7.0% ABV, this could be dangerous, as the alcohol only became apparent in the pleasant buzz in my head after the second one. Especially for a fruit beer, this is very drinkable.  Backwash: This is probably the best pumpkin ale Ive ever had, closely approximating what I remember of the one I had at Rodneys years ago. As I mentioned in my Post Road review(before knowing about this), the Rodneys version was also based on a brown ale, which made for a more successful result. This beer really transcends its status as a seasonal novelty beer and becomes something Id be happy to have almost anytime. My one cavil is that it is too hoppy, which competes with the other flavors. Id prefer a slightly gentler British-style brown ale feel. To see if the hops mellow, I plan to put one away to age. Pricey.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,Gavage,3.9,"Poured a clear amber / orange color with a thin head. A definite spicy aroma is quickly noticed. The taste is a nice balance of sweet and spice, as cinnamon and nutmeg are clearly evident. The body was slightly thin, and the spiciness lasts a bit on the tongue after swallowing. The higher alocohol content is barely noticeable. Nice beer to sip on a chilly October evening while sitting looking at your carved pumpkins, though it is not a beer to drink several of.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,WVbeergeek,3.78,"Appearance: Copper amber orang when held to the light forms with a cream colored relatively thin head that leaves behind speckled lacing. Aroma: First thing evident is the spices nutmeg and cinnamon with some mild pumpkin tones. Taste: One of the better ones I have had this fall not as resdiually sweet or cloyingly syrupy lacking some of the pumpkin flavor that others have more of but the spices are dead on here along with a decent kick in the acohol department at 7%abv that's not too shabby. Mouthfeel: Some residual stickiness still has the syrupy extract like feel but this one's not nearly as bad as some of the other pumpkin ales out there, good carbonation enjoyable. Drinkability: A definite one at a time beer but to be enjoyed surely every fall.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,xgrigorix,3.54,"Twelve ounce brown bottle, 2003 release.  Amber with a touch of gold, obsured by a slight chill haze. Thin off white head did not stick around very long. Smells like the spice cabinet in my kitchen. Everything that the label promises - allspice, cinnamon, & nutmeg. Whiffs of alcohol round out the nose. Tastes like pumpkin pie made without any sugar. Mollasses, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, & just a bit of the pumpkin to remind you. Dry finish goes on & on. This made for an excellent snakebite.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,rabidawg,4.22,"Appearance: Orange-copper with constant, active carbonation. Small, white head that settled to a clinging skim. Spotty lacing.  Smell: Loads of sensory data here, with all the traditional pumpkin pie aromas. Nutmeg dominates, with slight fusel alcohol esters in the background. Smells almost Belgian.  Taste: Spicy sweetness up front, with warm cinnamon and soft nutmeg. Noticeable alcohol. The slightest metallic twinge after the first sip, but which faded after that. Finishes with a gingerbread flavor and a mouth-tightening bitterness.   Notes: Soft, warming, and spicy, this is a nice pumpkin ale. I'm not as excited with it as I thought I would be, but it's a must-try for the fall season.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,far333,3.77,"Hazy orange color with an off-white bubbly head that settles quickly. Nose is equal parts punkin and spice, and just a bit of alcohol, plus some sweet honey and toffee. Flavor is very balanced between punkin, malts, and spices. Would have liked more pumpkin to come through though. Finishes a bit sweet, with sweet pear and alcohol tingling the mouth in the finish. Pretty good, but not as good as I expected.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,nomad,3.96,"Poured a beautiful color, phenomenally shiny, that shifted slowly from gold edges to deep but lustrous amber in the middle. Had a thin and simple soft head, sat very well, with thick and slow lace that leaft a stain of sloppy but wide horizontal strings and splotches. A good looking glass of beer, no doubt.  Smelled of soft pumpkin, moderate toffee malts, with notes of sweet cinnamon and hearty nutmeg poking up, as well as small hints of cinnamon. Inviting autumnal scents. Taste was of wet and full caramel malt washed over by dry and spicy accents. There was a nascent vegetable flavor through out the middle of this beer, having the chewy and even core of the meat of raw pumpkin. I recognized the allpsice the most, but felt the nip of the nutmeg more. Finish was drying and not the greatest, hurting the drinkability more than the taste.  Pretty good for a fruit/vegetable beer spiked with spices.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,ManekiNeko,3.37,"12 oz. bottle, chilled, served in a pint glass.  Appearance: Clear.. well... pumpkin orange color topped by a small beige head that dissipates rather quickly. No lacing.  Smell: Cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice smells are quite prominent. Light caramel malt in the background. A great autumnal smell.  Taste: Aforementioned spices, then a bit of sweetness, followed by bitterness. Most of the flavor is from the non-standard beer ingredients.  Mouthfeel: Light bodied with a flash in the pan taste, but there is a numbing sensation from the cinnamon and nutmeg. Chew on a cinnamon stick or a clove and you'll know what I mean.  Drinkability: This is kind of a weird beer, as are most pumpkin ales. Worth a try if you consider yourself a beer geek. I picked this up for an impromptu beer tasting for a group of friends. We all found it interesting, but I don't think anyone was overly impressed. I'm finding it hard to finish the bottle. This is definitely one to share.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Upfront a smooth pumpkin nutmeg, and cinnamon taste dominates but then the second layor of flavor is crisp and has a hip sting.. not flowery or citrusy hops... clean stings of hops. Also after you swallow the spice and slight white pepper dryness (abv) stays on the tongue. The more you sip the beer the more prominent the pumpkin stands out. Lively coating mouth slightly viscous to the tongue. A nice treat for an October night. This would be something you either like or hate.. and well...

Nose is spicy with nutmeg and allspice, malt and hop...with slight ""punkin' "" aromas lastly. The taste is a sharp blast of goodly hop bitters followed by some ale yeast-based fruitiness, sweet malts, spiciness and a touch of alcohol which leads into the finish, which is lip-smackingly bitter and long. The most bitter example of pumpkin ale I've had the pleasure to drink...a hop-heads' pumpkin ale if you will.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,BeerResearcher,4.12,"Someone should send a bottle of this to Shipyard, so they understand what a ""Punkin"" Ale is supposed to taste like. It pours an orange tinted amber with a fading white head. Pumpkin, nutmeg, allspice, malt and alcohol fumes (in that order) make up the aroma. The malt body could use a bit more oomph, but it's far more substantial than that weak-ass Shipyard. Flavors of pumpkin pie come to mind - as it should. Pumpkin and cinnamon dominate, as allspice, sugar and nutmeg offer a nice supporting touch. A mild lime-like bitterness seems almost out of place, but after a few gulps, seems to fit in with the ""Punkin"" gang. Warming alcohol provides the expected punch when you smell and taste it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,ElGuapo,4.32,"A clear red amber colored brew with a small, but well-retained head on top. Pumpkin pie hit my nose first followed by a delicious array of seasonal spices. Allspice and cinnamon were the two main ones I could pick out, but the blend is so nice, that they all seem to come together. It reminds me of Halloween, and how much I hate pumpkin pie, but somehow enjoy this beer.  Crisp carbonation starts you into what becomes a very smooth bodied beer. It is pretty full in that category, and it is loaded with complex flavors. Pumpkins do not dominate, but you can get a good taste of them. The spices are the real story here, and the perfect balance of the flavors creates a really great brew. I had a small sample of this at Sippin' By the River, and everyone was shocked when I said "" this is pretty good"". I was a full out pumpkin hater before this beer. After a pint on draught, I may never look upon a pumpkin ale negatively again. A very nice brew indeed.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,edchicma,4,"My first pumpkin ale....quite good...spicy aroma..very little head, but color was like a light pumpkin pie...Taste was interesting..a malty flavor, but with alcohol kick. Aftertaste was good for such a high abv. The taste lingered just a bit in the back of the palate...just enough to invite you to sip more. Mouthfeel was chewy in a nice way...similar to a desert. Easy and pleasant to drink. A nice change of pace.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,WanderingFool,4.08,"I'm a big fan of pumpkin ales and brew my own every year. I found this one to be very flavorful with a nice velvety mouth feel. It pours a clear dark amber color with a light ivory head that dissolved to a thick ring around the surface. The aroma is filled with nutmeg, allspice and a fruity pumpkin/apple oder. Each sip is filled with spices. Nutmeg, cinnamon and allspice dominate. It finishes with a dry fruity flavor that reminded me of a white wine. A slightly fruity palate is left behind after each sip.  For such a full flavored beer at 7% abv I found this beer to be quite drinkable. I just wish it came in 6 packs for the same price.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,Jarod,4.42,"#300 Bottled in 2003  This beer poured a crystal clear orange/brown colored and while held to the light the carbonation bubbles danced all over the place. The head that sat on top of the beer was of the color of cream/beige. It was not real lasting, only from first pour was there any density to it. It fell fast to nothing but a rim on the edges of the glass. Surprisingly there was lace produced and it was in the form of sheets. The aromas were pleasant and fresh. It was pumpkin pie just from the oven and more. I nosed sweet malts, spices (nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice, pepper), grated nut, hops, just opened can of pumpkin pie mix, and some brown sugar. The tastes were just as fresh as a just baked pie. Flavors of citrus fruit, fruit (apple, pumpkin obviously), spices (pepper, nutmeg, allspice, cinnamon), sweet malts, brown sugar, hops, pumpkin flowers, and wisps of alcohol in the end. It finished with light pumpkin. The aftertastes were of spicy hop/pepper. The body was medium. Overall taste and impression, is that it is well balanced, not too much pumpkin, but really balanced in all its flavors and aromas. I personally would like to have had a tad bit more pumpkin, but if that would not be possible then dont change a thing. Note: this beer gets better as it warms. The distinctions of the aromas and tastes become more prominent with each degree increase. I really liked this beer and would get again and again. Great representative of its style.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Faint aromas, but nice and intriguing. Taste is dominated by the Dogfish Head brown sugar, only subtle hints of the spices and pumpkin.

10099,6260,LiamStLiam,3.38,"I love pumpkin ales, and I have been impressed with the Dogfish Head I have had in the past (who's not?).  But this one, while a nice beer, comes up short in my book.  A four-pack went for $6.99. Remember, I am a guy who really doesn't like paying more than $7.99 for s six-pack (but I am learning).  My main comment: The pumpkin doesn't shine through. The spices are there first, and they leave the lasting impression.  Nice orange/brown color, suprisingly light head. It looks good in the glass.  It's comfortable enough, but maybe I was expecting more.  If I were to choose between bottle and tap (I have had both), I would go with tap.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,taez555,3.45,"12oz bottle.  This beer poured a small white head that disapeared rather quickly. It had a clear orange/ruby/brown body.  The nose was very pumpkin spicey. Sharp cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, a slight bready quality. Almost a minty, grassy, piney(dare I say toothpaste) type aroma. As weird as it sounds it almost had a marijuana type smell too it. Pot and pumpkin nose.  The taste was much more subdued. Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Bready, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice. Your typical pumpkin taste. What's really surprising is the citrusy hop flavors in this beer. Touches of earth, alcohol, wood. Very soft tasty malt. But yet again this minty, piney, citrus sort of taste. Very uncharectorisic of a pumpkin beer.  It ends with a firm citrus peel bitterness wtih hints of pumpkin spice in the background.  Overall I was a little disapointed by this beer. It had a very interesting nose, but the flavor itself was more along the lines of a middle of the road american pale ale with some pumpkin spice in the background. Not bad by any means, I was just expecting a bit more from such a great brewery.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,Denali,4.42,"On tap at the Blind Tiger in New York City.  2002 Vintage.  Appearance: Clear orange with small white head that dissipated quickly.  Aroma: Very strong cinnamon and nutmeg (so strong that I felt it at the back of my throat!). Brown sugar was evident as well.  Taste: Like apple/pumpkin pie. Wonderful cinnamon and nutmeg flavors mixed with the pumpkin flavor and topped off with a coating of brown sugar that lasted into the aftertaste. Fantastic.  Mouthfeel: Lightly carbonated.  Drinkability: Extremely drinkable. I could drink this all night.  Comments: I was a bit hesitant to try this because I don't like pumpkin very much, but it was suggested that there are enough other flavors present that I might like it anyway. I did - very much. You just never know. The brown sugar was fantastic. Yum.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,the42ndtourist,3.87,"Interesting.  A golden copper colour, with little head or lacing. Nose is a little spicy and sweet. The taste is quite something, though. I've never had a pumpkin ale before this. I'd call the flavour as something of a cross between pumpkin pie filling, mulled cider, and an amber ale. Quite sweet and spicy, with a slight hoppy finish... That being said, this is also like pumpkin pie and mulled cider in the fact that it's really not for imbibing in quantity, as the flavour can overcome you.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88

Aroma is sweet and full of pumpkin pie spices, nutmeg, allspice and a dash of cinnamon. The flavor is very reminiscent of pumpkin pie, but make no mistake, it still tastes like beer. The amount of pumpkin and spices is not overdone and make for a different, but quite smooth and drinkable, beer that was very enjoyable on Thanksgiving.

10099,6260,Scoats,4.3,"Hmmm...pumpkin pie beer... hmmmm.... ""Pumpkin Pie in a glass"" is the best way to describe this beer. It is the color of pumpkin pie. It starts with a nice initial taste of pumpkin and ends with a pumpkin pie spiciness - just like real pumpkin pie.  Ignoring the pumpkin pie thing, it is also a very drinkable beer. A great balance between gimmicktry and general beer drinkability. It is indeed a fine drinkable beer.  Personally I like this beer a lot, especially during the late fall/early winter Halloween/Thanksgiving time of the year.  This easily is the most popular beer that we sell at The Grey Lodge Pub due to its shocking word of mouth cross-over appeal with non-beer geeks and its scarcity. Barrels emptied quickly all over the city. A certain amount of scarcity is important with this beer as there is little demand for it after the Halloween/ Thanksgiving season is over.  Each year at The Grey Lodge the anticipation and legend of this beer increases.From what I can tell due to its extreme scarcity, that is true at a lot of places. This beer is everything seasonal beers should be and should be about. And to think two years ago we got a barrel around Thanksgiving because they couldn't get rid of it. This year all were gone before Halloween.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,aaronh,3.67,"Nice orange-copper color with amber highlights. Pours with an attractive creamy head that lasts well and leaves a nice lace. The aroma has a distict pumpkin scent, with nutmeg and perhaps clove. The taste is very spicy, with a subdued punmpkin note. It still presents a nice malt flavor, with hops noticable on the finish. A hint of sweetness helps blend the flavors together. The mouthfeel is fairly typical for an ale, noticable but does not coat the tongue, with a relatively clean finish due to the hops. Very enjoyable. Thanks to Nero for making this sample available.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,HopheadEd,3.85,"Nice amber color but unfortunately not a big head, little lace. Great taste though, not overwhealming like some pumpkin ales can be. Not like eating a slice, but more like putting your finger in the batter and tasting. Cinnamon, clove, nutmeg and hops, and a finish that leaves you wanting to put whipped cream on top. Yeah, I liked this one!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
10099,6260,NeroFiddled,4.12,"Deep copper in color with an off-white head that holds well and leaves some good lace. The aroma is quite bold with nutmeg and what I perceive to be All-spice. The body is light-medium with a standard carbonation and a lightly zesty mouthfeel. The flavor shows the unique Dogfish Head character and starts with a good blending of sweet malt & spice, reveals a myriad of spice flavor as it crosses the palate, and finishes with a dry and peppery spiciness that lingers briefly. Bitterness is present, but plays a supporting role to the spice which acts as the main balancing agent (and dominant flavor). The spices are fresh and flavorful - much more so than the generic spicing usually found in pumpkin beers - and the beer has a very distinct character of its own which usually cannot be said of spiced beers. Very nice, and well worth trying.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Pumpkin Beer,88
