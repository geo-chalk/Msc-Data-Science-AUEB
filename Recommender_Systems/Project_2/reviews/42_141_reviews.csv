42,141,harrypowers,4.35,"Pours a clear golden color with a runaway tall foamy head and heavy lacing.  Smells of yeast, banana, citrus and spice.  Tastes of sweet malt, Belgian yeast, orange, pear and apple with an alcohol warm peppery finish.  Medium light body with moderate carbonation. Slightly syrupy, smooth mouthfeel.  This is a very tasty, well-made brew.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Neelbeer,4.25,"Look: huge head that receded quickly Smell: Yeast, lemon, orange, little bit of banana, marshmallow maybe; touch of pear Taste: follows nose with the fruit flavors, especially lemon peel; celery taste (maybe what others are calling coriander), considerable bitterness, a hint of sweetness, I did get the ginger but it took me a while; a little funky; wintery spices, quite a luscious beer Finishes dry but with a sweet tingle; pleasant carbonation, low viscosity but still creamy with the foam, and crisp On the whole, I like the spices and flavors of this beer. A good, modern saison. I got this one from Whole Foods.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,AzfromOz,4.12,"Procured in a trade/proxy arrangement with @turkeysdrinkbeer in February 2022. Drink in October that year.  L: There are orange cordial vibes going on with the presentation of this beer, making my mouth water before I even contemplate putting my nose into the glass. There's no head bar a small rim around the edges. Sediment from the full-bottle pour hangs suspended in the beer, barely ruffled by the few large bubbles of carbonation that dart to the top of the glass.  S: On the nose, there's a slight yeast note and an indefinable tanginess that hangs in the aroma.  T: The taste has sweet orange, sherbety orange pith and yeast - that orange note probably accounting for the tanginess I picked up on the nose. The orange is followed by a musty, slightly aniseed note. It's probably the coriander and whatever bird-of-paradise grain is. Or perhaps it's the last vestiges of the yeast playing with those spices. Regardless, it's extremely tasty and definitely compels a second mouthful straight after the first.  m: On the tongue, there's almost a sherbety quality to the beer, but it's followed by a spritzy snap after the swallow, and it dries things out quickly after that point. 4.25  O: This beer comes together extremely well. The taste is somewhat unique and the mouthfeel and nose only add to that impression. I wonder if I could drink more than one of these, though, as I can imagine palate fatigue setting in quickly with such a sweet, sherbety beer. It treads this side of the cloyingly sweet line well, but volume could push it over. Based on drinking one rather than several, however, it stands up very well.

42,141,Fedorable,4.02,"Awesome saison that most people could pick up and enjoy. Love the color on this and the foam sticks around forever. Bright, orangey taste with a bit of ginger, some delightful malty sweetness. Smell is a bit off-putting: very sour and yeasty, a bit funky.

42,141,hankp59,4.44,"A refreshing great. Had a version from the brewery years ago aged in the Howe caverns. Still a marvelous, refreshing citrusy, hoppy joy. 750 ml bottles that work in a Weiss beer glass. There is a tang to this that is hard to describe but is akin to the unique characters of a Weiss beer. A beautiful head that lingers and a slight opaque look make this stand out from the average crystal clear beers you might be used to. If you have an adventurous spirit and are willing to leave the lager swill behind, get a bottle.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,colts9016,4.52,"Review 1529  My continuing quest for the best has to lead me to this beer. I had to get this beer shipped to me, living in a beer desert it hard to get good beer. The beer is 46 degrees and served in a tulip glass. A beautiful two-fingered bright white foamy and creamy head was formed. The retention of the head is excellent. Lacing was created on the glass as it dissipated slowly. The color of the beer is SRM 6, pale amber with golden yellow hues. The beer is clear with loads of carbonation bubbles.  I first get spicy hops, a touch of floral, malty sweetness, wet grass, and orange peel. Nosing further, I detect coriander, wheat, and phenolic.  The flavors in the beer are orange peels, floral esters, ginger, coriander, phenolic, lightly toasted malts, and malty sweetness akin to honey. The flavors kind of remind me of Belgium pale ale with a splash of Heff. It does have a light funk factor nothing I really could detect.  The mouthfeel is crisp, effervescent, and creamy.  The body of the beer is medium, high carbonation, and a medium finish.  This beer is stellar. The flavor complements each other well and the malt profile is there but not overbearing. The hops are subtle but firm giving away to the spice addition in the beer. If I could get this beer, it would be a staple in my beer fridge.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

42,141,defunksta,3.79,"Appearance: Upon opening the glass, it is billowing out of the bottle. Pours a semi-cloudy (~40%), medium golden/orange color that has sediment floating around in it. A strong white head. SRM of 9-10. (4.00)  Aroma: Moderate aromas of bread and cracker malts upfront. This follows into a banana and clove ester quality. A bit of banana bread and Belgian spice. Some juicyfruit, but ultimately it smells malty. (3.75)  Flavor: The flavor follows with more bready malts upfront. Cracker, bread, and then follows into a Belgian spices of clove and banana. This linger and provides a tart and spicy pepper astringency before it finishes with a sweet, almost candied malt finish. (3.75)  Feel: Medium-bodied. Strong carbonation. Finishes soft on the palate.  Compared to Boulevard's Tank 7 Farmhouse Ale 4/16/21: Pours a more orange color with a milder head. More bready, clove, and banana malts. Less fruit, citrus, coriander, and yeast. Winner: Tank 7  Overall: A pretty good farmhouse ale/sasion. I wanted to see how this one compared to one of my favorite saisons, which is Tank 7. I think I prefer the Tank 7. This is a decent beer, but as other have mentioned its leans more malty, bready, and sweet. The clove, banana, and pepper spice show here. Overall, not as good as I expected, and drinks pretty average. (Final Rating: 3.79)",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,mikeinportc,4.48,"Bottle with Best By date 07/03/22 Ah.... one of my first beer-loves, back in ancient times, c. December '97. Somehow I haven't reviewed it , & have to admit, slightly intimidated to do it now. How to do it justice? Will the ""objective #s measure up to my overall impression of it? Hmmmm??? OK, here goes :  Translucent gold-ish orange, with a huge forever head , that leaves a thick ring , substantial surface covering, and sheets of lacing . (Or it would, if I could hold off on drinking for a few more minutes - trust me - that's what happens. ;) )  Smell ? Nectar-Of -The-Gods, if you like that sort of thing. ;) . The usual banana, clove, ""spicy"" [ coriander+black pepper+ je ne sais quoi yeast aroma ], with a touch of ""fresh"" [wheat-derived, mostly] aroma, that usually accompanies saisons, goses, & Berliners. Just better than the usual.  Taste is similar to aroma, sort of, with elements of [very] ripe banana, black pepper, clove, coriander, 2-day-old homemade bread crust, a vague, very faint citrus element, a kiss of sweetness, and that ~indescribable (by me) , signature Ommegang yeast flavor . Some mild, mildy-drying bitterness.  Feel is light-medium, but give the impression of substantial presence, while also floating-on-air, just above eye level. Moderate, moderately-soft , carbonation tingle that extennnnnnnnnndddddddssss for quite awhile , before disappearing, & leaving the front pof the tongue a bit dry, & slightly stripped.  Overall, as you might guess, I am astounded & enthralled all over again. If anything, this might be a bit TOOOOO fresh , & could use 3-4 more months on it. If memory serves, I'd give the ""Taste"" rating another +.25, in that ideal state.

There’s a good saison flavor under there, but it’s masked a bit by the coriander and ginger. Maybe it’s just a personal flavor preference, but these flavors just don’t quite seem to go with the style.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,JRybacki,4.5,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a stem glass. Strong 2-finger head when poured. Some decent lacing on the glass and nice lingering thin head on beer while drinking it down. Strong copper color filled with carbonation bubbling to the top to keep that thin head going. Coriander and spice right away invite you to take a drink. Sparkling mouthfeel as soon as you take a drink and that smooths out at the end. As described on Omegang's website, you can taste the coriander, spice, and orange peel for a really delightful beer drinking experience. Overall, this is everything you want in a 'traditional' Saison- I fell in love with everything Omegang brewed years ago when Belgian beers became popular. It's so nice to revisit an old friend and put up a review on ba. I strongly recommend this beer any time of the year.

42,141,Spipenger,4.46,"This beer has a beautiful, rich taste on poor. It has a succulent, foamy head with a light amber color. The aroma is not all that apparent. However, the taste is really good. It's crisp and refreshing, especially during a pandemic on a hot, humid day in DUMBO, Brooklyn. I don't smell or taste much in the way of orange peel or the coriander. However, the coriander taste is subtle but clearly there. This beer is refreshing. Even with a 6.5% ABV it's not heavy. A must true.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

The taste features biscuity malt, grassy hops, coriander, and lemongrass, with a lingering bitterness on the back end. Warming elicits notes of wheat as well as bubblegum and banana courtesy of the yeast. Barnyard funk is muted at best. Medium body and fine carbonation makes for a lively, luscious mouthfeel that's just right.  Overall, this a fine beer.

Smells of fresh muddled tropical hops, yeast, wheat, banana, clove, vanilla, bread, some faint floral hops. No real musty or funky aromas. Taste follows the nose, great balance and drinkability. Some very pleasant wheat flavors, not my usual style of beer but this was just so easy to drink. Smooth, mild mouthfeel, just the right amount of carbonation.

42,141,Ozzylizard,3.9,"In cooler at Franklin Beer, Franklin, PA. $ 4.00 (Including tax)/16 oz can ($ 0.250/oz). Reviewed 3/12/20. Can bottom stamped Best By 07/13/19”. Stored at home at 42 degrees and served at 42 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. Appearance – 3.5. First pour – Light yellow, clear. Body – Light yellow, opaque. When held to direct light, light yellow with many tiny particles forming a haze. Head – Large (Maximum 5.5 cm, aggressive center pour), white, medium density, average retention, slowly diminishing to a three to four mm crown and rocky partial cap. Lacing – None. At 7.7% it should have been able to cough up a bit of lacing. Aroma – 4 – Spice and yeast. Flavor – 4 - Spice predominates. Slightly bitter, but that could be more a function of the spices than hops. No hop flavor or aroma. No malt flavors. No alcohol (7.7% ABV as marked on the label) taste or aroma. No diacetyl, no dimethylsulfide. Palate – 3.25 – Medium, watery, medium carbonation. Final impression and summation: 4. This is a well-made example of the style, in terms of appearance (despite no lacing) and spicy aroma. The flavor is a bit overboard on spice with too few yeast characteristics. Despite being well past the outdate, this compares well with the bottle I had back in November of 2009. I didn’t care for it then and I still don’t, although I like the style.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

42,141,Mindcrime1000,4.19,"What does it say about me that I haven't had, let alone rated, this highly-regarded brew? For shame.  Poured from a single bottle into a tulip.  The brew is hazy, but not cloudy, peach/gold, with excellent foamy head that quickly dissolves, but leaves a persistent ring of lace all of the way down the quaff.  The aromas are subtle but complex. Faint esters, clove, coriander, white pepper, citrus, white grape, yeast and funk.  The brew is spicy sweet on the tip of the tongue, with pale malts, esters, honey, pear, and citrus. The mid-palate carries this through with spicy yeast, white pepper, and coriander, with a bit of green apple, and white grape tartness. The hops are welcome but pleasingly understated, showing up as grassy, and earthy notes, not bitter ones. Perhaps the faintest hint of warming booze, but so mild that it melds into the peppery yeast. It skews perhaps a bit sweet for the style.  The brew is solidly medium, but remarkably carbonated and dry, nonetheless. It finishes with a pleasing tingle on the tongue.  American takes on European styles often exhibit reckless measures of hops or booze. Not this bad boy. Despite the slightly ramped up ABV, and the slightly sweeter than normal flavor, this brew is otherwise restrained and remains very well-balanced and smooth. One of the most crisp and refreshing brews at this ABV I've ever had.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

42,141,RockHop,4.33,"A world class beer. Wish Ommegang got more cred as a brewery, but they suffer from being ahead of the curve and the IPA craze. Drank this along with Tank 7 as a comparison. This is a hazier gold. Tons of head and retention. Straight beer aroma with a bit of ginger. This has more funk, more barnyard, and more sourness than the Tank 7.

Banana and dried apricot upfront, followed by toast and cracker, apple, pear, lemon, honeydew melon, green grape, hay and clove. A hint of sweetness throughout, but finishes dry and spicy. The feel is medium-plus-ish, highly carbonated like champagne, providing a prickling and pillowy sensation that quickly rolls across the palate and disappears into dryness.

42,141,thehyperduck,4.16,"750 mL cork and cage bottle from the LCBO; best before Nov 27 2019 and served barely chilled. Long overdue for a look.  Pours hazy medium gold; slightly clouded, highly effervescent body, generating more than two fingers of puffy, pillowy white head comprised of big, soapy bubbles. It falls apart slowly, requiring more than ten minutes to fully dissipate - a patchy cap and fat collar of foam remain, with gobs of messy lace also having been deposited in its wake. Kind of smells like a hefe to me - I'm getting a lot of ripe banana on the nose, with spicy hints of clove, pepper and coriander. Wheaty, grainy, bready pale malt backdrop sweetness, with light hints of lemon/orange peel and orchard fruit providing some added depth.  Quality stuff; ostensibly Belgian in theme, though I think if you gave this to me blindfolded, I'd believe it to be a hefeweizen - its ripe banana esters are the main reason for that notion, while its wheaty, bready malt notes merely reinforce it. Citrusy hints of orange peel and lemon zest rise to the occasion by mid-sip, leading into a spicy, yeasty tail end that includes suggestions of clove, pepper and coriander; clove spice and wheat grain sweetness wrap up the sip before a dry aftertaste. Medium in body, with assertive, prickly carbonation at first, though it does settle down quite a bit throughout the course of the glass, becoming more smooth and soft. While not a factor within the flavour itself, the alcohol does warm the throat/chest just a tad as you sip your way into this one.  Final Grade: 4.16, an A-. Ommegang's Hennepin did not disappoint, but it didn't exactly knock my socks off, either. That is to say, there's nothing out of place here: it's exactly what it needs to be, without going above or beyond in any specific manner. It's a solid beer in and of itself, but it's priced at $10.45 per bottle (in this market) and that seems kinda pricey for what I'm getting. Don't get me wrong - I liked it, and I'd consider buying it again, but I dunno how often I'll be returning to this at that price.

The taste is rather subdued with some traces of wheat and pils malts and some familiar Belgian yeast character but muted and leaning to the musty side. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, very carbonated and dry in the finish. Overall, ok but not what it would be fresh. Did not know where to look for a date on this, but I've had it fresh before and it was great. Rated to the average and will review again when opportunity presents itself.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,IronLover,4.16,"Dark straw yellow in color with a light haze. Poured with a robust, bright white, fizzy foam that quickly settled. Medium high aroma of anise and sweet bready, wheat malt with light peppery notes hiding in the distance. Fruity aromas begin to intensify as this warms. Medium bodied with medium high carbonation. Lush, creamy smooth feel up front with boozy warmth emerging from the middle to the end. Sweet bready, malty flavors up front with hints of sweet bananas. Light peppery and anise esters follow on the edges and slowly overtake the sweetness. Tart fruitiness in the middle followed by sweet apple, pear and berries. Finished with a tart fruit flavor followed by a mellow sour dough yeastiness and light peppery notes. Flavors and aromas were complex while subtle. A tasty enjoyable beer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,ThePold,4.6,"Fresh bottle into a beer glass of sorts. Pours a good amber color with thick head and decent lacing. A terrific wheat farmhouse taste with no lingering aftertaste. Buy it again, yes.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,chitoryu12,3.69,"Looks: Gold, with a head visible even through the bottle.  Smell: Fruity, yeasty, and hoppy. Not the best, honestly.  Taste: Much more subdued than the smell. A mild fruitiness and freshness without much hop bitterness until the aftertaste, not unlike a good pale lager. A little citrus. Extremely easy to drink.  Mouthfeel: Thicker than I expected for such a pale beer, almost creamy.  Overall: A very fine beer for a hot summer's day. The smell can be off-putting, but the beer is much more mild than it seems and it would be a good alternative to macrobrew lager.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Dragginballs76,3.9,"Appearance - Pours light golden color with thick rocky white head that lasts forever.  Aroma - Yeast, banana, clove, light funky, straw with a touch of bubblegum.  Taste - Taste leans less toward the funk and more toward the yeast, banana and clove side. Just a hint of funk at the end.  Feel - Light bodied prickly carbonation touch of dryness on the finish.  Overall - A well done saison, nice flavors very easy drinking.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,bibo_ergo_sum,4.36,"Man, Hennepin has got to be one of my favorite beers of all time. Definitely one of the best, highly available (at least on the east coast) American Saisons out there. The beer pours a beautiful hazy yellow-gold, with a head so fluffy you could take a nap on it. It smells of pilsner, clove, ginger, orange peel, mulled wine – grandma's spice rack/the old country. In the mouth, the beer develops what's already in the nose: spiced apples, funky citrus, pepper, yeasty dough with lingering hops. This is a creamy liquid dream, an excellent example of the Saison style.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Beerucee,3.25,Drinkable saison with now bad tastes. Perfect for ALCS start. From Nancy Yung.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Alexrdvz,4.72,"355 ml bottle. By far, the best saisons brewed in th US. Pours with a generous head with good retention (when done correctly), which helps release the bouquet and enhance the flavor. Nice and well balanced fruity and floral smell. The effervescence is a little on the higher side; the Golden color is just spot on. Not as sour as I was expecting (a good thing in my opinion). Citrus flavor with a peach or banana aftertaste (in a good way). I can’t get any of the ginger out of this one, neither on the smell, nor the taste. but there is no need to go looking for it. This is just as close as it gets to a perfect beer. Very complex flavor, refreshing, not too bitter.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,VoxRationis,4.19,"Decanted from a 12 oz (355 ml) bottle into a conical pint glass; no production information. A: Pours a slightly, hazy golden color with a very robust and creamy white head showing good retention and some lacing. S: Aromas of corn/grain initially with an evolving and increasing clove and lemon scent, as it warms. T: Very dry. Clove and hot pepper flavors mostly, maybe some citrus. Strong bitterness throughout. M: Light bodied with significant carbonation despite rather high ABV for style. Crisp finish. O: A nice representative of the Saison style. A little drier and more bitter than average, but with a more complex flavor profile and more refreshing than most.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,mpyle,4.08,"Deep golden color, somewhat cloudy. Pours a very healthy and creamy white head with good retention.  Nice soft clove aroma, generically ""Belgian"" but fairly muted in aroma.  Soft clove flavors matching the aroma, but quite drying in the finish. Seems quite authentic with the flavor profile.  MF - Fairly light body and big carbonation. Carbonation aids in the drying finish. Again, quite traditional.  Very much in line with Belgian/French Saisons, in terms of being highly carbonated and dry and maybe a little boring. A nice beer, just probably not my favorite style.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

42,141,briandschorr,4.78,"Another home run for Ommegang. A fantastic beer overall and is a must try for all beer lovers out there. A fine example of how a Saison should be. You will notice a good amount of carbonation. The taste is amazing. There is a mild note of fruit that stays on the palate. There is a wonderful white head along with slight lacing. The taste follows the nose and is a lovely blend of clove, Pilsner, fruit, and yeast. I found there to be a great mouthfeel. The champagne-like quality is another element that, when combined with everything else, makes this beer an amazing addition to the Ommegang body of work.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Holderness,4.01,"Hazy yellow body with a fizzy white head produced with gentle pour. Decent retention and minimal lacing. Smells of pilsner, fruity yeast, jackfruit, clove, and booze. Taste largely follows the nose , but the tongue-tickling effervescence and booziness masks some of the nuances in the flavor. Nice, full yet refreshing mouthfeel thanks to the high ABV. Overall a nice high-ABV saison  81/100",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,BeerAndGasMasks,3.87,"From the bottle, it pours a solid amber with a modest head which reduces to a ring and a large continent. Possibly some fruit and malt in the nose.

Apricot or other fruits are not present in the taste. Heavy malt/yeast/grain instead. Alcohol taste is more prominent yet clean and crisp.Very dry finish. Leaves an interesting coating on the palate perhaps this is the ginger doing its magic.  Hennepin saison ale makes for a solid companion to the summer weather. I've come to expect some semi sweet notes on this style of brew.I've only had a handful of examples in this style. My inexperience and sweet tooth,however does not take away any part of the joy I get from sipping on this brew. Overall this is a solid farmhouse ale, just not what I was expecting. Definitely complex.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,The_Atom,4.09,"This is delicious. Pours a very prominent soapy head, but dies down a few minutes after the pour.

42,141,Lone_Freighter,3.99,"It poured a light golden yellow yielding a yellow/orange colored body. A white, foamy, one inch head appeared and slowly died to a film coating the top of the body. A fair amount of carbonation is seen rising. The smell has the coriander and pepper up front. The taste is peppery and crisp yet tart and balances it all out with a slight orange peel-esque-ness coming through. The palate is dry on the aftertaste and finish, some acceptable harshness on the tongue. I’d say this is fairly drinkable. I’d say this isn’t exactly very drinkable. Overall, this is a good saison, different from most I’ve had, but still good.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Shade1951,4.13,"Love this one! I'm surprised I haven't already rated it, as I've had it several times.  Color is a lovely bright cloudy amber. A normal pour creates a billow of white foamy head that dissipates after a couple of minutes to a thin white covering. Fragrance is pleasant and mild - a bit of flower and grain.  Taste is great. A hint of sweetness, but only a hint. Dry on the finish. Quite refreshing, as is supposed to be the case with a saison, although the ABV can be dangerous if one quaffs the brew quickly. Tingly carbonation - champagne-like. Slightly watery, which works fine as a thirst quencher.  Overall, a fine ale that I pick up whenever I come across it.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

T- Peppery with a hint of citrus peel pith. Moderately hoppy but balanced and refined with a clean, dry finish.  F- Very effervescent and light on the tongue. A rich full body, very crisp and light.

Looks great. Terrific saison presentation.  Aroma: Good nose. Grass, funky yeast, citrus/orange rind/lemon, hay, earth.  Taste: Follows nose. Orange rind leads the way and is right on the the edge of overpowering without going over it. Tasty saison. Doesn't quite equal the appearance and nose with the taste, but that's a high bar.

A hint of bitterness, sweetness, and citrus with a unique richness and creaminess that lingers in the back with a dry finish.

Taste was more wheat than almost any beer I've had which is saying a lot. Alcohol was kinda pronounced. Some citrus in there. Really tastes more like a hefe than a saison. Lacks the dry finish, the levity. This comes off as an imperial hefeweizen. The clove dominates. Format is expensive.

42,141,SaltofOH,4.18,"Bottle BB 1/20/17. DFH Tulip.  A (5): Pours a slightly hazy light gold with three fingers of frothy, foamy, white head that seems to be lasting forever. Arguably the thickest, longest lasting head I have ever had on any beer, ever. Loads of carbonation streaming up from the sides and bottom of the glass. Lacing is exquisite.  S (4): As soon as I popped the top, I could smell the Belgian phenolics: bubblegum, spice (not clove, but similar), yeast, green banana, candied orange peel (orange peel is really in there, go me!).  T (4): Tricky and deceptive arrival; complex flavors that call you to attention immediately, but I wouldn’t call it bold – this is not Duvel; it is overwhelming and laid-back all at once; slightly malty and phenolic/spicy arrival, turns more phenolic and slightly medicinal on the mid palate (ginger?); goes for a slight funk/dried straw note right at the end, and then bitters to a very smooth, lingering phenol, spice, and hop ending. As was the case with Duvel, I find the hop/clove/alcohol combination to be a bit much as this grows warmer, but it is a really well balanced beer.  M (4.5): Lighter side of midweight, actively carbonated, but not biting. A little residual slickness, but clean and dry overall.  O (4.5): I have seen this beer on the shelves for years and years, and wanted to try it. Now that Ommegang is releasing more things in six packs, I am able to try some of their wares, and I have been impressed with everything that I’ve had. This is excellent, and if I could afford to do so, I would drink this all summer long. 7.7%ABV? You would never guess. This is a deceptively complex yet simple beer; loads of flavor, but eminently refreshing. It reminds me a lot of Duvel, but that, I felt, was overpowering; this is not. And is this ever a beauty to look at and to nose. I’ve only had two other Saisons: the first one I don’t really remember, the second I remember because it was awful. I suppose in this case, the third time was the charm.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Smell is forward on the Belgian yeast, followed by cherry, orange, and some apple. Hits the tongue sweet from the malt, followed by fruits similar to the smell. The apple and orange come through clearly, with pear as well. Fruit flavors work well for this saison. Feel is very refreshing. Light, crisp body, with lots of carbonation.

Taste is initially sweet malt in the beginning, followed up by coriander, faint orange and a hint of ginger heat/or saison spiciness. Beer has a somewhat sharp, spicy dry finish.

42,141,hoptheology,3.93,"Known as the king of Farmhouse ales, I had to try this.  Hennepin comes barreling out of the bottle before I got a chance to pour it, with toothpaste-like thick foam, bubbling over and creating a beautiful disaster. When poured, the liquid takes a second or two to get past the foam and then develpps into a perfectly hazy, light mango flesh colored body. The head continues to look like shaving cream mixed with white toothpaste, just absolutely pasty and unrelenting. 100% opacity.  Fresh fruits on the nose with green and white grape, oranges, stone fruits/drupe, cantaloupe, accented with cinnamon and pie spices.  A wheaty-hay character starts it out, followed by a wash of circus peanut, banana split, and yeast. A stale cracker/wet hay malt flavor permeates the profile though, detracting a bit from the experience overall. Some lemon-lime flavored water finishes out the profile. 4 seems too generous and 3.75 seems too low, it's a hard decision.  Feel is crisp, light, and dry like a white whine or champagne. Not bad at all and a great compliment to the style and flavor profile.  Overall, I think this is the first Saison I've had this season, though I may be mistaken. Perhaps I'm not giving it a fair chance, but I thought this was just above average. Not neccesarily bad, but not totally mind-blowing either. Will I have it again? Maybe.

42,141,Beginner2,4.49,"This ale is a master stroke of taste and marketing. Overall, the only ""5"" rating I have ever given a brew.  First I want to talk about the marketing. (Besides, Hennepin's 2177 reviews have said everything about its taste imaginable.) So, here is my take based on a few facts and what I hope is informed speculation. Duvel's success made clear the huge potential market for Belgian ales. Duvel also learned how hard it is to distribute in 50 states. Duvel's owner (Moortgat) was among Ommegang's original and, eventually, controlling investor. Seemingly, Ommegang's strategy was to lead in America's craft market for Belgians by tagging along with Duvel's distribution network here and helping build it. Both grew.  We also can look at this bookends in history. Hennepin, a Belgian missionary, discovered Niagara Falls. I view Hennepin, the beer, as Moortgat's missionary to help bring Belgians to America and to focus on making ales for fine cuisine.  It also helped that Hennepin tastes great. If you want to review BA's Bros and Top Raters as I did, I find little more I can say except to relay some other experts. However, I will note that the label pictured as the current one is not superior to the original. But, there is no need to judge this gem by its cover.  While MJ's 1999 ""Guide"" gave Hennepin 3 of 4 stars and called it ""fruity, dry counterpart to a Belgian saison"", MJ gets wildly enthusiastic on page 416 of his ""Great Beers of Belgium"" and even compares it to the classic Saison Dupont.  Oliver Garrett's calls Hennepin ""Ommegang's finest creation"" (page 197 ""Brewmaster's Table"") and talks about how its sweet and sour center makes it an excellent accompaniment to food.  These two generations of beer's master writers agree. So 2177 reviewers and one of BA's highest rated saisons must all be correct !  Collectively, Hennepin is a master stroke on a mission.  7/18/20 Bringing a magnum to an outdoor party of wine-drinkers. I hope to get at least one convert. Hennepin is my go-to for appetizers and summer fare. I wish it were easier to find.

Cloudy amber in the glass with a decent amount of sediment.    -Nose: All yeasty and bready brings me back to the champagne comparison. Reeks of bananas and orange peel with a slight bit of hoppiness.    -Flavor: Great creamy mouthfeel. Orange peel, rye bread, with a decent amount of hops. A bit of petrol on the backend. Great finish but it doesn’t linger    -Rating: 4/5: This is a really good saison. Light and refreshing with a great mouthfeel. Just what one needs for a nice Spring day drinking session.

Smell is cloves, banana, lemon, pear, and just a general earthiness. Taste expands on the above flavors into an overall fruity and spicy beer; in addition to what I picked up in the smell, there's also coriander, orange peel, banana, and wheat. Very complex balance between sweet, spicy, and bitter. Feel is full and rich, somewhat high carbonation that makes it feel pleasantly prickly on the tongue.

Smell: Banana peels, apples, coriander, fruity esters, something floral.  Taste: Very floral. Flower petals. Bananas. Lemongrass. Cloves. Overall, the bananas and the floral notes probably stand out the most, but it does have a well-rounded flavor for a beer of this style (even if it is on the fruity side), and the alcohol is hidden quite well.  Feel: Bubbly, sharp, and refreshing.  Overall: While it's not my favorite farmhouse ale, it's still a very good one.

The beer is champagne like in bubbly goodness and the head is an off white, two finger thick foamy layer over the brew itself....it retains quite nicely and gets rather puffy. Beautiful coloring too....yeast hazed golden/copper, and there is some dead yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle too....nothing but good stuff happening appearance wise!  S- Velvety soft spices that remind me of clove, coriander and slight black pepper right off the bat, followed by mellow fruitiness (pears, pink lady/gala apple, soft citrus and notes of banana), yeasty buttery biscuit....finish seems somewhat dry.  T- The banana fruit flavor comes to life even more than the aromas let on, with the pear and apple/citrus notes now taking more of the back seat. Balancing light smooth malt sweetness that is slightly toasty and grainy/grassy cleanliness! The finish is slighty hoppy, and this becomes much more noticeable after the swallow when the back of the palate gets a tart/bitter floral tone. The spiciness is quite muted but detectable overall...just mild pepper and clove of note!  M/O- Very pleasant on the palate, and while there is a boatload of bubbly zing, it really allows the full expression of the mellow, balanced flavors to shine. Very well hidden alcohol and the beer will age well, as I have found out (BB or bottled July 2013)....this is a highly drinkable and social brew that could be enjoyed on many a night by and sort of club meeting or perhaps with a good meal!

Once it does, speckled lacing clings to the glass and eventually slides. The smell starts off with a rustic spicy peppercorn aroma running into some tart apples. The taste was rustic with a tad of funk, slight spice slides in and brings in a light citrusy fruity balance. It finishes semi-dry. The mouthfeel was about medium bodied with some carbonation hitting on my tongue just a bit more than expected. Peppercorn spice does hit my tongue appropriately.

The appearance was a soft hazy bronzed orange color with a one and a half finger-ed white foamy head that dissipated within less than about a minute. Trickling semi-foamy lacing stuck around the glass. The smell had a nice sweet Belgian bready yet delicate citrus fruitiness and then highlights of a light peppery spice rolling in for the balance. The taste was balanced very nicely between the breadiness, the citrus fruits, and then the spice all blending nice and sweet to spicy. A light fruity to spicy character shows its face in the aftertaste and it leaves a sweet fruity finish. The mouthfeel is about a light to medium in body with a nice sessionability with this one. Crisp carbonation leads the way but isn't burdonsome as it is there, but allows the sweetness of the blended flavors to be somewhat wet yet slightly clingy, nicely done.

F: Fairly light and refreshing, has a crisp, dry finish similar to champagne.  O: A delicious Saison from Ommegang.

42,141,akdo,4.58,"Look: The body is gold and has a one-finger head which quickly recedes to a thin layer of white foam.  Smell: The nose offered notes of toned-down lemon juice. Expect no funky smell.  Taste: The palate matches the nose right off the glass like many North American Saisons. Then, it shifts quickly to notes of Belgian spices which are milder than those found in the back-end of a witbier. As a result of that, Hennepin is not aggressive on our tongue and is very drinkable.  Feel: Like any saison, be it from Belgium or North America, this beer is refreshing. Moreover, we do not feel a crispness that might blur the lines between a saison, a radler or a lemonade. This last detail is a plus.  Overall: This beer is a simple textbook North American saison. Although it is stylistically anonymous because of its simple notes of lemon on the front-end, its simplicity actually makes its charm. The only reservation I have with Hennepin as well as other North American saisons has to do with the head retention. Sure, the beer has a nice lacings, but it can't match other Belgian saisons, which mostly manage to keep a half-a-finger head during a tasting session. Despite this flaw, I would drink this very often during summer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

42,141,Lesingnon,4.16,"Appearance: Pours a cloudy straw-color with an absolutely massive, bubbly head. The head might be my one complaint about the beer, though. As I find it necessary to pour extremely carefully or it's almost inevitable that the beer will bubble over.  Smell: The Belgian funk is readily apparent. Smells primarily grassy, but hints of fruitiness round it out quite nicely.  Taste: Like the smell, funky grassiness is the primary taste. Hints of citrus and spice dance about the edges, and though there's not much hop bitterness they do leave some floral notes that linger after the swallow.  Mouthfeel: Light, with carbonation that dances and tingles pleasantly across your tongue.  Overall: An impressive Saison, not as harsh as some I've had and very drinkable. I find myself particularly fond of how the few citrus and spicy notes seem to complement the grassiness just perfectly. Undoubtedly a great beer that deserves its reputation.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,ThisWangsChung,4.24,"Re-review. 12 oz bottle into a teku.  Appearance: Pours a cloudy (as it should be, damnit) straw color. The head is a billion fingers high and white in shade. What's worse, the head is both incredibly fluffy and long-lasting. Some lacing sticks to the glass, too. If someone asked me what the stereotypical saison SHOULD look like, I'd point them to this. I've sort of becomes attached to the theory that a beer's aesthetics are mutually exclusive to how it will taste; with this, I simply can't wait to drink it. (4.5)  Smell: It's like, every single note I expect from a standard (non-brett) saison is here and in full force. I really pick up massive notes of black pepper and grass, along with some mild apple and pear notes. As it opens up, I also pick up some sesame seed. This takes a lot of elements from a witbier, too - the coriander is particularly strong (yet doesn't devolve into Underwood deviled ham like some coriander-laden beers can). It takes all the good elements from a saison and a witbier, and creates something that smells killer. (4.25)  Taste: I get some saison spice initially. From first sip, I can easily tell there's a lot going on here. As the notes of black pepper, fresh-cut grass, and sesame seed gently subside, I start to pick up notes of coriander, candied sugar, and lemon. Of course, I also have to mention the ester flavors: the apple, pear, and white grape notes really sing on the palate. The finish brings back some grassiness. Why the hell didn't I revisit this one sooner?! (4.25)  Mouthfeel: This is refreshing yet decently substantial, like a saison should be. If there's one complaint about this beer, just one complaint, is that it's a bit too sweet at times. Whatever, it's 7.7% and doesn't have brett to eat away at the residual sugar, so I'm peachy. Carbonation is moderate yet mouth-filling. (4)  Overall: This is a classic for a reason. It drinks like an archetypal saison, yet adds just enough witbier elements to make it even more interesting (instead of detracting). This is what happens when you search for the latest and greatest saisons: you ignore stuff like this that's on the shelf 24/7, and come to regret it when you finally decide to pick it up again a couple years later. No more, I'm going to be buying a lot more of this in the future. (4.25)  4.24/5: I could just buy this and Dupont in lieu of all other non-brett saisons and not feel like I'm missing anything",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

There is also a musty wet straw/wet hay smell lurking just beneath the surface along with sweet malts.  The taste is sweet with a very sweet berry like, bubble gum taste along with lots of sweet wheat. The spices tickle the palette then the sweet, creamy wheat taste comes in.

O - This is an exceptionally well crafted farmhouse ale, that uses its yeast and malt to good advantage. Ranks among the best brewed on this side of the Atlantic, and remains quite approachable.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

T-none of the flavors shine bright for me on this one..........notes of lemon, some of the yeast, esters seem muted, getting some of the spiciness, faint pear........ a bit of a metallic taste that lingers and coats the mouth  F-light bodied, crisp from carbonation, dry finish  O-somewhat disappointed in this one today as I had this beer before and thought it was great but just not living up to my memory..........maybe the palate is off today.........does improve with each sip but something just isn't working for me on this one",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

42,141,Mikefriedman90,4.73,"Exceptional saison. Another great ommegang brew. Pours light yellow with a relatively heavy top. Drinks very easy, and at 7.7% alc/vol they mask the strength well. Can clearly smell the sweet orange peel but it's the taste that's gonna keep me coming back. Until I find one to better it, the Hennepin is my new go-to saison",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,babaracas,3.85,"Pours a hazy golden color, two finger tall fluffy but fast fading off-white head settles to a thin ring, trails a few streaks of lace down the glass. Smell: pear, pepper, lightly grassy and lemony, with notes of unripe banana and something a bit oddly vegetal (like sprouting garlic). Checking the label I've never realized how many extras they throw in... don't see any expected offenders, but there is that odd out of place note. Taste: boozed ripe pear, mild whole-grain-bread graininess, lemon peel, significantly peppery with some really mild orange-ginger mix in the finish. Initially slick then fast growing carbonation hits, gets to be a little too much, then fades slowly into a crisp-ish but not dry, and slightly sticky, finish. Packaged 3/14, best by 3/16. This was my first ""saison"" many years ago and it's definitely an enjoyable beer... throttle up the gravity a bit and it's a killer BSPA... but for the style it advertises it's not great, and very reliant on the adjuncts.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,bmeehan,4.02,"Even the beers from Ommegang that aren't outstanding are still worlds better than the same brews from a lot of other brewers.

42,141,DaverCS,4.9,"Best Belgian-style beer for the Price!  Appearance is a hazy yellow-orange color. Ample carbonation that matches the style perfectly. Beautiful fluffy white head that clings to the glass and stays throughout consumption.  Aroma is hits of the yeast with some alcohol presence up front. A major contribution from the yeast that gives it an almost bready smell (as in the yeasty-bread dough before it is baked). Definitely spicy peppercorn with some citrus notes of mainly lemon and orange.  Taste is excellent. Immediately hit with spiciness and yeastiness. I get some of the orange peel and coriander, however not much of the other labeled ingredients. Some nice flavors of lemon juice and zest with a touch of lime zest in the mid palate as well. A moderate amount of classic pepperiness with some biscuity notes. Totally complex!!! At the end a very mild kiss of hops makes the beer incredibly balanced and drinkable. The beers carbonation allows the beer to be extremely refreshing.  For about 3 dollars a bottle, this beer is cheap in comparison to other Belgian beers (normally 5 and up), however it doesn’t lack in complexity and character. It is owned by the same company that produces beers like Duvel (another favorite) and Achouffe, so that’s another perk of known quality! This would go well with many different food pairings. I think pairing this beer with something equally spicy would work well such as some excellent cured meats like hot coppa or soppressata. Again, for the price, this beer is my go to! The only thing that isn't perfect is that as the beer warms up it gains a slightly more present alcohol hit (amplified by the flavor of raw ginger) that detracts from all of the other great flavors. It isn't terrible, however, I did have to mark it down for that reason. However, I still give it 98/100 points!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Gajo74,4.43,"Pours a light golden color with an impressive soapy head. Amazing thick lace retains throughout. At first there is an earthy and barnyard like aroma, kind of like hay. Later, there is a strong fruity and citric like aroma. A fruity taste predominates at first; sweet but also slightly tart. It reminds me of green grapes; like a white wine. There is a hoppy, herbal and dry finish that leaves a bitter aftertaste. The feel is medium/light bodied. It is very easy to drink and fantastic with meals. I really loved this one. Excellent overall!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

42,141,JackRWatkins,4.1,"A: Pours a hazy, straw gold color, with an off-white, creamy, three finger head, (very) good retention. S: Immediate apple, and general estery quality, with some subtle clove, with a pleasant suggestion of biscuity malt, and subtle, clean, hop presence T: immediate yeast and clean bready note, with a subtle suggestion of citrus/grapefruit, there is a peppery quality here as well along with what can only be describe as just the right amount of hop bite, I get the suggestion of white pepper though I'll admit it is less present here than in other saisons, despite the complexity of the flavor profile, I find overall this is a very crisp beer (this (along with the yeast) to me seems to define it). There is a somewhat floral tartness here but it does not overwhelm. This beer's yeast definitely comes out more as it sits. M: it is dry, but it certainly coats the tongue in something of a resinous way O: probably the best of the more traditional american saisons that I've had, it is truly a fantastic beer and a credit to our contemporary definition of the style. I think it is easily the best year round beer that Ommegang makes, though they make their fair share of fine beers, many of which are sorely under-considered due to their availability",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Produced as much foam as body and had to wait a bit to pour the rest. Color is deep yellow and clear, with lots of effervescent carbonation streaming to the surface. Aroma is Floral and fruity, and belies the Belgian yeast. Taste is fruity and spicy, with orange rind, pear, white grape, and coriander all found within. Some earthy and floral flavors. Feel is light, and champagne-like.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Along with the standard bready and spicy tastes that seem fairly standard among Saisons.  Mouthfeel - 3.5/5 More creamy than crisp. Medium to heavy in body.

The taste is very vibrant in the mouth and consists of several zingy citrus fruits, a light hoppy character in the middle with a reminiscence of wheat grain, and finishes beautifully in a cascade of flavors that dance around the mouth well after swallowing.

42,141,CalgaryFMC,4.05,"12 oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass. A cloudy golden yellow with a white head that starts large but quickly settles down to a comfortable half-finger. Very malty, fruity, spicy aroma: Fresh apples, hay, light grapefruit, breakfast cereal, pungent coriander seed, white wine, and just a touch of funk. Palate is correspondingly fruity yet quite dry. Robust rich malt backbone coupled with the fruit and spice notes mentioned above, subtle nutmeg and cardamom, citrus (lemon and grapefruit rind), shortbread, and a hint of rock candy sweetness. Body is thin to moderate, with carbonation on the low end. Quite a wonderful saison, not as tart and bitter as some, lacking that dry ""burlap sack"" note, and yet redolent with yeast phenols and esters plus added hop bite.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

The aroma is fruity (banana, green apple and melon), spicy (coriander, clove), floral, and slightly funky (barnyard and leather). Delicate and nicely balanced … no punches in the face and the character comes together as one. Much the same for the taste, hop and phenolic bitterness with subtle malt in the background. Light and balanced. Finishes very dry with moderate astringency. Body is light and bubbly … feels like a dry champagne without. Overall, it is a delicious beer and another example of why I’m being drawn to Belgian-styles. Complex, yet well connected and easy to drink.

42,141,Keginator70,4,"First pour in a challis. Mammoth head with tons of yeast, pepper and citrus on the nose which I can smell a foot away. Typically cloudy but lighter in color than some other beers in this style.  Very complex. Flavors are all over the place. Savory heat (cilantro or watercress maybe) on the tongue and a bubbly tingle in the mouth. A grainy malt texture blends well with the yeastiness which lingers but doesn't overpower the palate. A superior taste with an even better sensation in the pie hole.  Results from the second pour are almost the same. A little more heat as the beer has warmed up some.  Final pour. I allowed some of the yeast to flow into the glass. I can still taste it after ten minutes. Not the way to go for me. I have tried this before with a 11.2 ounce Belgian blonde and it worked well. So it's the type of beer, temperature or some combination of the two.  Overall I love this beer. It is my favorite saison and one of the best beers I have tried.  Note* I'm not a fan of a big grapefruit presence (probably because I don't like grapefruit) so take this into consideration if you use opinions as a guide.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Aromas of pears, apples, peppery notes, citrusy notes, a touch of earthy and floral hops and some of that barnyard funk. Taste follows through with citrusy orange notes, mild peppery tones, floral hop flavor, tart apple and Belgian fruity yeast flavors.

Nice body of color with some nice lacing and head, lots of very small, fine floating bits from the sediment in the glass (not too distracting, thankfully).  S: Very high in citrus and green apple with a hop body. Some alcohol and yeast backbone. A good aroma.  T: Lemon and floral hops, green apple finish with some mild bitterness. Very light malt body. Little bit of light sweetness, not much bite. Rosey finish.  M: Very crisp and clean, nice and drinkable. Fairly strong beer, but doesn't feel like it.  O: Another very good selection from Ommegang, who is currently averaging a wonderfully high rating for me. Probably the most consistent and highest average brewery I've reviewed. Hennepin must be my least favorite beer from them so far, but it is still a very good brew that would be nice to drink on a mild summer afternoon.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Smell: Pears, spices, bananas, and semi-sweet bready malts greet the drinker. There is some very dry pepper, and ashy notes on the body. Earth and dirt mesh with some light hop notes on the back end. Wow a lot going on here.  Taste: Touches of pepper and airy spices hit on the front first. Bread, sweet dough, and some salty hops show up on the body. More sweet malts ride through on the finish and some lingering spices go well together.  Mouthfeel: Bright carbonation with pleasant transitions of spice and sweet malts.

42,141,safaricook,4.23,"Got the 750ml corked bottle at Whole Foods in Vienna, Virginia. Enjoying it in my hotel room out of a tumbler glass.  Slightly murky straw yellow body with lots of fine to medium carbonation. Fine white head of just a finger that stabilizes at a thin layer. Some nice lacings.  Smell is citric and peppery, there is ginger and some fruitiness added by the orange peel.  Typical Saison dryness with quite some spiciness to it, almost hot. Bitterness is there but hops are not standing out  Plentiful carbonation makes this refreshing, crisp and palate cleansing. It ends with said hotness that comes probably from used ginger and grains of paradise.  This is a well done maybe even great Saison. It is refreshing, dry and interesting due to the added spices that give it dept. In my personal opinion I believe it could be made even better if the flavor would rely more on the yeast than on the spices, furthermore it is a bit sharp due to the high carbonation.  It think it would work with a lot of spicy foods. Actually it's probably even better when combined with food than on its own.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,TheItalianStallion,4.11,"Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a Duvel tulip glass.  A: Pours a hazey golden color with lots of carbonation. There is a gigantic, dense head that eventually settles to 1 finger in size and sticks around for the remainder of the beer. Minimal lacing with some chunks of foam clinging to the sides of the glass.  S: Smell is of lemon, grass, white pepper and slight clove. Also a bit of yeast. The nose is similar to a Tripel with the pepper and yeast aromas.  T: Taste is fruity tartness with lemon and a bit of apple. White pepper and clove are definitely present. Some grassiness with earthy notes are there too.  M: Crisp and refreshing mouthfeel with high carbonation and a light body. Finish is somewhat dry.  O: Overall this beer was good, but wasn't a stand out by any means. This is the only saison I've ever had so maybe I'm just not a huge fan of the style, but I would give this beer another go. Nice and refreshing on a hot summer day.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Renaissance_Man,3.27,"Poured from 375ml/11oz bottle into a pint glass. Be careful pouring as I ended up with a 'beer floater' head. Appearance was classic off yellow. The oversized head lasted for most of the drink. First impression was of spice and this was confirmed on first taste. I detected coriander and bouquet definitely opened as the beer warmed up in the glass. The spice on the pallet clearly overrode the typical saison funk and really become pronounced on the back pallet towards the end of the beer. Overall, being one of the first saisons I have critiqued I found it pretty good. If anything a little too spicy for my liking.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Would definitely get this again.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,archyquaffer,4.28,"Poured from a 750 ml (25 ounce) corked bottle into a schooner glass. The label depicts a silhouette image of Father Hennepin, with his wide brimmed hat, canoeing a pine-fringed lake while hoisting a stemmed glass similar to the one I am using. The bottle glug glugs and I back off to an easy pour, producing about 3/4 inch of a chunky, billowy white head with a golden tinge. The beer is a slightly hazy, pale ruddy golden with effervescent carbonation.  Funk, spice and light floral-citrus in the aroma. The flavor is complex, but not overly funky. Spice, dark fruit, and citrus notes combine with some light earthy tones, biscuit, and some overripe banana. Mildly bitter with an overall dry finish yet with some lingering pungency. The mouth feel is creamy and crisp altogether. A pleasant burpiness settles the stomach and produces biscuity, fruity, grainy flavors. The alcohol is well-masked beyond a little bit of warming, and light at that.  An excellent beer and perhaps the best of its type that I have tried. The funk is there but it's not overpowering and the beer is surprisingly light and drinkable considering the strength. This seems like a perfect beer to quench thirst, ala Belgian peasants, although the ABV would seem to limit its session-ability!  This beer was bought for $9.19 at Hennessey Grocery in Butte, Montana, which continues to bring variety and exotica to beer drinkers in our corner of the mountains. The price is at least 2 dollars below Belgian imports of a similar quality for sale in the store.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,TBoneJones,4.01,"Pint pour is a hazy, cloudy pineapple yellow, with soapy foam head of nice height. Looks rich. Smells like bread and coriander spice, some ginger, herbal. Refreshing to the nose. Upon sipping is where the orange peel kicks in, and everything else that was on the nose falls into place for a creamy, biting saison that embodies its listed ingredients very well. Ending is an earthy sum of all the ingredients, sharp, biting, some minerals. Not complex to me, but I enjoyed sipping this well enough.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,blackcompg,4.44,"Appearance - Pours a quick 3 fingers of tiny bubbled foaming white eggshell head, body is a very hazy bright golden yellow with very light orange highlights, body also contains alot of garb rising thru the center, leaves prominent foamy lace rings after each sip, great head retention.  Smell - Yeast, banana, light clove, fresh citrus, coriander, nutmeg, crisp pear.  Taste - Starts with yeast, light under-ripe banana, very gentle citrus of lemon and orange, very nice light pepperiness of white pepper, also hints of coriander and nutmeg, and there is a definite presence of white grape and young pears at the back of the quaff, the finish is yeast and drying spices, banana pith, and a very light sourness of grape skins.  Mouthfeel - Medium mouthfeel, and yet silky smooth and pillowy light. The bold flavors of yeast, spices, and light fruits fill the mouth, and then theres this wonderful carb with is medium-high, but the bubbles are so tiny, washing over the tongue in a smooth tingly foam with tiny little edges, really feels wonderful, and will have the sipper contemplative of both flavor and feel after each sip.  Overall - What else can I say, this is simply a fantastic saison, and a perfect representative of the style. Everything you want is here - yeast, spice, light fruits... and it's bold, effervescent and dry. A must try.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,travolta,4.43,"Appearance: An amazing whipped egg white head with excellent retention and great caked on lacing. An hazy golden straw color with nice races of yeast.  Nose: Coriander, lavender, some clean citrus and a tiny bit of pine. A little banana and yeast. Very clean.  Taste: Banana, grass, some citrus, and pineapple. Earthy and very well balanced.

42,141,ExaltedNecrosis,4.13,"22 oz bomber poured into oversized Duvel tulip.  A - Pours a cloudy golden yellow with 4+ fingers of foamy white head. This dissipates slowly to a 1cm head that persists for a long time.  S - I get the typical Belgian yeast aroma with citrus, clove, and spice in the nose.  T - The Belgian yeast is prominent in this with a large amount of clove, lemon, pepper, and a bit of grassiness.  M - The body is light with a high amount of carbonation. It's very crisp and refreshing, as saisons should be. Definitely a great hot summer day brew.  O - One of my favorite saisons...I'm glad I finally got around to trying this. Refreshing and drinkable while maintaining a good amount of complexity.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,ONovoMexicano,4.17,"Poured from the bomber into a Ommegang Belgian tulip glass.  A vigorous pour produces a massive head that is light, airy and pale white in color. It persists well and leaves an abundance of lace all over the bottle and atop the body. The body is a cloudy orange and golden.  On the nose I initially get a pungent, boozy malt smell, but this is followed by a grape-like sweetness and some toffee aromas. There's also a bit of spice, although I can't identify what exactly.  This is tasty. I continue to get the sweetness from the nose, the wine-like grape flavor as well. There's an earthy quality to the taste as well as a bit of spice that could be coriander but I'm not sure. Citrus also weaves in and out.  I notice that this saison is much lighter than many I've had lately. It's refreshing and has a wine quality to it. There's a good level of sweetness but it isn't overbearing or distasteful. The finish is clean and semi-dry with a bit of a yeasty effervescence.  This saison stands out to me for it's lightness and the grape and wine characteristics. It's a beer I could drink on the hottest of days and still enjoy.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,fourstringer,4.25,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a simple glass tumbler. Gentle hand. No clear date on the bottle. Enjoyed this many times, but never reviewed.  A: Cloudy, pale yellow with a faint tint of green. Towering 3+ fingers of rocky, white head. Good retention. Light lacing.  S: Inviting, mild Belgian yeast spice. Coriander. Light hay. Faint floral notes. Lemon. Noble-type hops.  T: A rustic, lightly musty spice opens with the development of a balancing hop bitterness. A bit of fruit and tartness add some depth. Fairly dry finish. Light alcohol presence.  M: Moderately high carbonation with a moderate body. Drinks nicely despite a solid effervescence.  O: Refreshing and easy drinking saison with a deceptively stout ABV, but no arguments here. Good balance. Warrants the regular revisits I throw its way.

42,141,Mikus,4.19,"I guess I have tried this before... must have been a couple of years ago, and my palate may have changed/evolved. Rated a 3.75 before. A more detailed review is necessary. Pale golden beauty with yellow highlights in the light, and 2 transient fingers of the purest white head. A beauty if I have ever seen one. Super clean nose. Peppery yeast notes, light wheat and malt notes clearly ring through (nothing to hide here), and some light phenolic notes to round it all out. Spot on. Light bubble gum on the front of the tongue, lingering spiciness/peppery notes as the yeast dominates the middle of the palate and holds on, perfect balance of malty and bitter. Balance. Light and crisp finish, with a pleasant aftertaste that lingers until the next sip. Ridiculous. An absolute standard for the Farmhouse Style. Possibly the best that I have tried. Such beautiful balance.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,vickersspitfire,4.8,"Appearance: Light blonde body that’s very clear and topped off with a thick white head. Smell: Spices and mild citrus fruit are up front, mild alcohol and wheat all hit you at once. Taste: Grapefruit, although very mild, is present, the spiciness really makes this ale tasteful, some grass flavors come through too. A little peppercorn mixed in with lemon and orange zest make for an interesting ale.  Mouthfeel: medium bodied with plenty of carbonation.  Overall: This is an excellent ale, the flavor is complex and makes you yearn for another drink, the aroma is sweet overall and really inviting. I highly recommend drinking this ale.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,majorbase2,4.08,"Poured from bottle into pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a beautiful straw color. Sizable white foam head, with decent retention. Some lacing. Some nice sediment, as well.  Smell: Smells strongly of wheat and citrus. Some spices and a bit of alcohol as well.  Taste: Yeast and pepper out front. Wheat. Definitely some fruits, with lemon and orange being the most evident. Not as much hoppiness, and the alcohol is hidden excellently. Zest dominates this one, but not in a bad way.  Mouthfeel: Very light bodied. A good deal of carbonation.

42,141,Andrew041180,4.21,"A - Arrived in a tulip glass with about a finger's worth of white head which retained well and left some spotty lacing on the glass. The beer is a golden straw color and hazy. I can see lots of carbonation rising quickly from the bottom of the glass.  S - Dominant aroma is a spicy grassiness with hints of yeast.  T - Complex flavor profile. The background is a slightly sweet barnyard funkiness. On top of that I can pick out layers of peppery spice, lemongrass, and an ever so slight touch of alcohol. The alcohol basically puts a point on the other flavors.  M - Nothing outstanding here. Medium bodied with substantial carbonation, although the carbonation doesn't produce anything like a soda water sensation. Finishes dry and cleaner than I would expect.  O - Definitely a good one, although I have to say that at this point Saison and Tripel are both falling in preference next to Dubbels and Quads. I can certainly appreciate this one, but I may be trending away from the style as a whole.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Radome,4.56,"Tasted from a 750 ml bottle.  A - Color is a light gold. Slightly hazy. Head is white and inches high on the initial pour. Later is recedes to a paper thin sheet with some lacing. Large bubbles are constantly rising through the beer.  S - The aromas are spicy and interesting. I get cracked pilsner grain, leather, black pepper, coriander. There are more aromas in there, but I can't pick them out. No overt hops; a low yeast note on the end.  T - Flavors of cracked grain and black pepper lead off. This is followed by herbal grassy notes that seem to be from spices or yeast. The mid-palate is buttery and slightly sweet. There is enough hops bitterness to cut the sweetness, but no hops flavor that I can detect. The finish is dry. The overall flavor impression is crisp and fresh, but very deep and complex.  M - Medium body with silky smooth carbonation. Low alcohol presence. Clean, crisp finish despite the slight sweetness.  O - This is a smooth drinkable beer full of interesting spiciness.

42,141,Foyle,4.24,"Appearance: 3/4"" fluffy white head recedes quickly with very little lacing. Color is golden and cloudy. Lots of carbonation streaming. Aroma: wonderful smelling beer (if you like Belgian ales). Lots of cinnamon and clove, distinctive ’horseblanket’ Belgian yeast aroma, some lemon as well. There is a light malt flavor as well, sort of like a fresh baked cake. Mouthfeel: I can’t really distinguish this from champagne. Pretty much identical mouthfeel to me. Flavor: mirrors the aroma. Lots of cinnamon and clove dominant with the sweet cake-like malt flavor underneath. There is a very slight hop presence and a nice alcohol warming in the back of the throat after the swallow. Overall: This is an outstanding Saison.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,BWE,4.72,"This beer is fantastic. Somewhat hazy yet golden appearance. A sweet, and slightly hop smell with a little malt maybe.  The taste is very fruity, yet malty at the same time. You can definitely taste the ""Brett"" influence. I didn't notice much hop flavor. I would say more lemonade like than anything. As you let it warm up, the flavor changes quite a bit. More yeasty and full.  If your a fan of Saisons I would definitely put it on a ""to drink"" list.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,ChristopherWIU-UTPA,4.62,"It poured hazy golden, with a thick white head, average carbonation, and little lacings. It has malty, wheat and hops infused taste, with strong accents of orchard fruits. I t has a malt aroma that fades quickly and goes down smouth and leaves the mouth dry.

42,141,Kadonny,4.41,"Poured from a corked and caged 750ml bottle (with new label) into a Hennepin tulip glass.  A: A light golden color with some haze to it. Head is big and frothy and pure white. Glass lacing is terrific and lasts.  S: Yeasty smell with a large dose of fruit and spice. Nice smelling beer.  T: Fruit forward with orange, lemon, pear, apple and some green grape. The yeast and spice creep in with some pepper, clove, coriander and even a little funk. Some biscuit malt is mixed in but the beer stays mostly dry with some slight tart to it and some nice hops. Bitterness combines with the yeast and adds herbal and floral hop notes and the finish stays smooth and bone dry with a little lingering bitterness. Fantastic flavors going on here.  M: Dry, very dry, alcohol is well hidden, slightly bitter and a nice lasting medium to full mouthfeel.  O: An outstanding Saison, maybe the best one brewed in the US. If you like yeast and fruit and spice but in a hoppy dry beer, this one is for you. Fantastic.  I'm not the hugest Saison fan, but this beer is fantastic.

42,141,CaliforniaJohnson,4.75,"25.4oz bottle purchased at Trader Joe's with the new labeling, poured into 6oz tulip glass.  APPEARANCE: 50:50 fluid to head ratio. Beer is a rich, overcooked-olive-oil-yellow with aggressive effervescence. Fully translucent but cloudy. Head is pure white with subsidence in asymmetrical patterns, leaving pillows of foam in unpredictable places.  SMELL: Lemons, Grandfather's toolbox, Chardonnay  TASTE: Tart to the tongue inducing pleasant saliva secretion. Hops are very present but just enough bitterness to balance the bright flavours. Yeasts are very fruity - Notes of citrus. Notes of anise root. notes of papaya. ""aftertaste"" strongly resembles pear jelly bellies. Alcohol is well concealed.  MOUTH-FEEL: Frothy due to the easily-agitated carbonation. Tickle to the tongue, followed by a filling gulp down the throat. Viscosity of true fluid is low.  OVERALL: This beer was rated without any financial bias, however, the pleasure it provided was frighteningly affordable.

42,141,NewMexicoBeerLover,3.5,"A: beautiful and beguiling--more foam than the glass could contain when poured casually. Laces well and steady stream of microbubbles supports a thin layer across the beer for the duration.  S: Lemons and a lazy day.  T: Wow--Haven't sampled many saisons but this is way more sour than expected. Initially overwhelming; as the buds acclimated, started to embrace it and could see how this might become the quintessential thirst quencher--lemonade for grownups and enough reward to make one want to pick crops or at least mow the lawn.  M: Really for as lemony/citrus/sour; this lands very softly on the tongue and is swallowed with a smile. Very cool craftsmanship at work here.  O: For nine bucks a bottle, I need more, much more complexity and interest. Several Belgian Saisons at the same cost, and IMHO that also offer a much more beguiling entreaty to be consumed than this one trick tart. (example: St. Feullien--a rhapsody of flavor and aroma by comparison.  Still on a hot day and your dollar, I'd have another in a heartbeat. Let it also be known that I have immense respect for the ""gang"" and love many of their beers.

42,141,LambicPentameter,4.21,"Finally providing one of my favorite American-made saisons with a proper review. Poured out of a 12 oz bottle with the new grey/purple silhouette branding. There is a production and best by date on the neck, but the production date is smeared beyond recognition. The best by date on this particular bottle is August 2015, which makes this bottle 20 months old based on the shelf life of Hennepin (listed as 3 years on freshbeeronly.com). Poured into a Boulevard Smokestack Series tulip glass.  Appearance - Pours a golden straw colored body with a little bit of haze to it and a brassy twinge to the hue. A steady stream of bubbles rises up from the bottom of the glass to meet a one finger stark white head with a few larger bubbles from the sloshing of the pour. Lacing at this point is almost nonexistent (almost), but I know in my experience with fresher bottles that it is not uncommon to leave mottled sticky lacing around the sides of the glass on the drink down.  Smell - Whereas a fresher bottle of this reveals pretty forward notes of floral overtones reminiscent of jasmine and sweet nectar, that has been subdued with time in favor or more of yeast flavor profiles--pepper, clove-like spice are present alongside grainier notes of sourdough and even some hints of brighter lemongrass and Granny Smith. But the grain and peppery characteristics are the leaders now.  Taste - The aroma wasn't lying, with strong notes of pale grain and slight tart (but not really sour at all) notes of fruit along side white pepper, baking spice, orange zest and a slight estery bite with some faint hop bitterness. I must admit to preferring this one fresh, and my ratings reflect as such, but this is still a good beer with nearly two years on it. Would be an easy one to keep around for a random occasion because of the ability to keep for a long period of time.  Mouthfeel - Light bodied and moderate carbonation with an effervescent component to the feel. Dry finish with just a slight hint of sweet.  Overall, this is just a really well-done American-made saison. It's one of my favorite beers from a stellar Ommegang lineup and one that I will frequently grab just on a whim when I'm looking for a solid saison that isn't Tank 7.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Act25,4.34,"This may be Ommegang's best, and I think it's so close to Duvel and great Trappists that I'd love to conduct a blind tasting later this summer. Outstanding. Must try.  Since Duvel is one of my favorite beers, this is in my top 30 for sure.  A - Pours a murky, dusty straw gold color with a 1 inch white head. Not the head of lasting and lacing of Duvel.  S - Also a Meditation beer as good as wine or champagne, and even more energetic. . Lemon, champagne, with spices, pepper, fruit, apple, and sweet malt. Grassy, very long finish, very appetizing. A little more yeast stink than Duvel (a Saison).  T - All of the notes in the aroma and MORE SO... RISING on the tongue, with sweet malts, a little bitterness, spices. Pepper & champagne. A lot going on. Also like Duvel, a clean long, long, cleansing finish, that makes you want another kiss, I mean sip.  M - pinpoint carbonation. Dry and crisp like champagne. A bit chaulky in a good way.  D - Must try. As Alstrom wrote ""Close to champagne but so much more. At a dinner party see if people prefer over wine"". I do!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

42,141,artoolemomo,4.06,"Appearance- Pours up a whole lot of head and looks as if it will have very good retention. The head is a pure cotton white while the body is a dull, pale amber which appears as a hazy mix of gold and lemon in the light. Some lacing.  Nose- Big notes of banana followed by very mellow and rounded notes of clove. Some coriander, big notes of orange peel. Light hints of apple. Some creaminess that tends somewhat toward vanilla. Some lemon. Nice smooth ginger. Swirling gives the phenols a slight sour to sulfur scent. Not in a bad way. Maybe even a little bit of grassiness.  Taste- Fairly reflective of the nose with what I can already tell is very good balance and integration. The fruit aspects seem to work seamlessly together with banana moving into lemon and orange, some melon, and light notes of apple. The cloves have a good amount of presence and aren't exactly rounded but they work. They are more smoky than ashy and have a slight woodiness to them. It works well with the creamy front of well rounded fruit esters. Strong coriander and mild notes of pepper. Pepper grows on the finish and works well with the smoky cloves. Not my favorite saison but I fully understand why it gets such good ratings. It's not as crisp a DuPont but the mellow nature of the flavor profile and the mouthfeel are a nice change of pace. Definitely a really good beer and one that I will drink again in the future. Pepper expands and even gives suggestions of cinnamon. Nice complexity, good presence. It doesn't seem like being owned by a conglomerate has ruined Ommegang yet.  Mouthfeel- Nice tingle from the flavor notes. A little more than light bodied with a good amount of airiness and effervescence. Healthy amount of carbonation and even a slight carbonic sting but it works well with the spicy finish of this beer.  Drinkability- Very easygoing and quite pleasant. And I love the fact that these are in 12 oz bottles so I can pick up a four pack for a little more than what a 750 would cost. Why more should cost more, I will never understand. A bargain at just over 3 bucks a bottle.  Overall- Really good beer that is a good representation of the style. Not as dry and crisp as my favorite saisons but still quite enjoyable. A must try.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Aroma of light, tart fruit with some secondary citrus character. Chalky, clove-like yeast notes.  Semi-dry, very flavorful. They nailed the rustic farmhouse character, though don't expect and funk or Brett character. Light, pale malt backbone, and there may even be some wheat in there. Fruity esters suggest pear and white grape. Some white pepper is apparent on the finish. Soft mouthfeel, the carbonation becoming ever-smoother. Hardly a hint of alcohol.

This would be the PERFECT beer in the summer. It has that Belgian wheat beer core but a bit more flavor.  The smell has something in it that reminds me of the scent of piss. Haha. That doesn't deter me because the taste is fantastic (no piss). The bottle says not to disturb the yeast sediment... I did that by accident. Maybe the yeast doesn't like to be disturbed, it gets pissed... then it decides to smell like it. :D My fault! lol.  If you are a fan of Belgian wheat beers you will LOVE this. I'm sure of it.

42,141,surfbouy,4.75,"First of all, the weather was sunny and warm and perfect for the style when I had this beer yesterday. I had also just listened to Dr. Charles Bamforth on Beer Smith radio. I was more than ready to drink great beer and wax philosophically about it.  Appearance: Standard side pour into a .5l Weizen glass makes a large, fluffy white pillow that lasts for a good long time. Lovely cathedral window type lacing. Golden and effervescent.  Aroma: Amazing! Crisp, slight skunky/grassy/ hoppy, pilsner malt, spices/peppery, tropical banana, so much more!  Flavor: Follows the nose with Pilsner malt, spice/peppery notes add depth with complex fruity, banana, citrusy, vanilla to add yet another layer before a medium-dry finish.  Mouthfeel: Light body, with a slight tingle/sting from the carbonation. Alcohol is very well hidden. Crisp, but not overly so. The carbonation is too high to quaff this beer and that’s a good thing.  Opinion: Amazing! Similar to Tank 7… Maybe better? I was worried a little because of all the adjuncts (coriander, ginger, orange peel), but the balance is perfect. The medley is hard to detect and many sips are necessary to fully appraise. The individual flavors are elusive and fleeting. Buy it again?

42,141,magictacosinus,4.41,"I had this over a year ago on tap and remembered liking it a lot, but what with the hoopla on so many saisons and funky farmhouse ales churning out every day (it seems), this was sadly buried underneath with no immediate visitation. No more, I say - reviewed live - poured into a teku glass from a 12oz bottle. Freshness date is ""09/2014,"" and apparently it was bottled on 02/29/2012"" as well (?!). Doubtful, as these four packs weren't available back then. I'm going to say this is 2-6 months old, roughly.  Golden amber in color, with a fluffy, foamy white head that coats the top of the glass before eventually settling into a ring. Good carbonation at first - I'd imagine this would look fabulous in a flute glass. Lots of sediment float around in the glass, and added on to the cloudy appearance, this is relatively rustic looking. Quite good.  A lovely saison at the nose, as indicated by the generous amount of spices, fruitiness, barnyard notes, and overall bitterness. The spices are at the front here, with juicy orange peel, coriander, as well as some slight ginger and white pepper, but there's a nice white peach (or merely stone fruit) flavor that follows, with some notes of wet hay, lavender, and light toasted leather notes. A little bit of toffee, maybe some caramel, with an underlying funkiness underneath that resembles a good cave aged cheese. Really delightful and playful stuff!  The flavor is a continuation of the aroma, with a little bit more sweetness showing in from the malts and yeast, but otherwise, that's about as far as it goes. THIS is how more American made farmhouse ales should be made. A generous addition of orange and lemon peel, plus some light peaches (with cream), as well as some white pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and some dried white flowers (with a bit of honeysuckle). Finishes semi-dry, with a wetness accentuated by the yeast, which gives it a bit of soaked leather and light tobacco flavor, as well as a brief nuttiness resembling almonds. Slightly sweet at the finish, with some strong notes of toffee and sugar cream, but it's otherwise stupidly balanced and refreshing. Graceful carbonation, with a gentle, cracker-like texture. For a mass produced saison, this is among the greats for sure.  What a wonderful saison! I'd love to buy some bottles and watch as they all develop over time, in spite of the apparent freshness dates. This has to be one of the most underrated saisons brewed in the country - and I'm at guilt myself, as I've spent so much time running after the more hyped or limited ones while this would gather dust on shelves wherever I'd go. Highly recommended for saison lovers - a domestic offering that's up there with my favorites from Belgium.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

S: Spicy, coriander and grains of paradise. Citrus and yeast combine to create a hefeweizen-esque nose. The yeast notes are tempting me. This beer has a very appealing nose!  T: Follows the nose. Spicy but subtle, orange peel with a tartness behind it. Yeast, wheat and a sweet finish. Flavors meld well to create a delicious sip.  M: Creamy, effervescent and medium bodied.  O: I'm not the world's biggest saison fan, but this proved to be a great choice. The spicy, orange peel tartness mellowed perfectly on the palate. I would drink this again. Easily drinkable and sessionable if you can find it at the right price. Paired well with a Neapolitan margherita pizza with a little black truffle oil on top. I would recommend this beer as a great example of the style.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Great retention; nice even strings of gloppy lacing. Almost perfect.  S: Spicy phenolic yeast notes pervade with a somewhat hoppy background. White pepper, banana, cloves, vanilla, medicinal hops, lemon zest.  T: Soft and slightly sweet with a tremendous yeast flavor. Orange creamsicle, dough, dandelion, hay and a finish with the tiniest touch of hops.  M: Slick, creamy, and quick. Almost coats the old mouth, but has a clean finish with a nice level of carbonation (especially considering how violent it looks in the glass).  O: Seriously... I keep waiting to have a beer by these guys that I don't love, but alas, this one didn't do it. Once again, despite being American, Ommegang has made a stellar Belgian style (something that is all too rare, in my opinion). Beautiful beer with a nice summery nose and a taste that perfectly balances the line between being sweet, refreshing, and hoppily dry.

Odor- smells like a heavy wit beer and the smell of yeast rolls.  Manifestation- Normally I pour beer into a glass with this being my first one I didn't really car so much. Most beer disappoints.

A good amount of that phenolic note. There’s almost an alcohol or metallic flavor in there too. Lots of carbonation and a bit of drying on the finish.

Flavor follows nose with citrus and tropical fruit, spicy clove and ginger, light bready malts and yeast. Alcohol is almost 8% but well hidden, nearly imperceptible.

Taste: An initial hit of strong carbonation followed by the floral taste of the hops, but not too ""hoppy"". Complex herbal taste, slight citrus, and great balance..  Mouthfeel: Full body but not weighty. Refreshing due to the blend of citrus and carbonation. Light enough to drink quickly but complex enough to slow down.  Overall: My first review, my first saison, and easily my favorite beer to date. The balance in this beer is fantastic. Those who are turned off by hops can wait a second until the complexity of the beer comes out. The citrus isn't the primary taste, yet it isn't too herbal. I really enjoy this beer.

Overall: Easily my favorite example of this style so far. Complex, refreshing and delicious. Works well during any season.

42,141,abeeronthebeach,4,"A - Thousands of bubbles rush to the surface like so many helium balloons. Pours a straw gold with an impermeable haziness and a champagne style head with great foaminess.  S - Has a freshness which reminds me of a Hefeweizen; I think particularly due to the coriander and orange peel which are mentioned on the label. Man, this beers smells so good; sweet and yeasty.  T - Has a very homespun taste; I get herbs, crisp citrus, yeast and wheat with a nip of hops just before it washes down the throat. I’ve never had a homebrew, but this is sort of how I can imagine a homebrewed Belgian wheat ale (which didn’t quite go to plan in terms of carbonation and complexity) tasting. Pleasant but not top stuff.  M - Unusually I found this a little wanting in terms of carbonation, although this may be true to style. Continues the homely feel from before, I find myself wanting to describe the mouthfeel as ‘cozy’ if that makes any sense. The beer just seems to envelop your tongue with a blanket of gentle bubbles spun from medium-weight fabric.  O - My first saison, and certainly a style I will continue to explore off the back of this experience. While 7.7% abv isn’t super high, it’s a good fraction higher than your average beer, and this beer carries the load with no stoop in its shoulders, a trait I must always commend. If this serves as an exemplar for saisons, then for me that means I ought expect a sort of musty, wheaty Belgian ale with a casual attitude towards carbonation. If this beer were cheaper it would be highly sessionable, but as it stands, while enjoyable, I probably wouldn’t pay $10 for a bomber again when I can get my hands on top notch Belgians, Weizenbocks and Hefeweizens for less.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

T&gt; Tastes a lot like it smells, a sweet malt background that is complimented nicely by the tart funkiness of the farmhouse style with a hint of strawberry like fruitiness that hits my taste buds periodically. Perhaps a bit too sweet on the finish and the spices steal the show a bit too much. I can also taste hints of the 8% ABV.  M&gt; Good feel in the mouth with ample carbonation. Quite creamy.

Plenty of spice is present, with corriander being the most dominant. Clove, brown sugar, a bit of pepper, and orange peel. A few fruits are in attendance as well with banana being the most prominant of the bunch, followed by orange and a hint of kiwi. Distinctly Belgian. LOVE it!  Taste: Spicy from beginning to end and a bit off-putting... at first. The more I sipped it, the more I began to enjoy it and pick up the subtle characters. Corriander and clove sprinkled amongst fresh bread and yeast. A fair bit of funkiness is present, but it's plenty tolerable. Grapefruit and banana are the only real noticable fruits in the flavor. Alcohol is also very noticable with a bit of hop bitterness wrapping things up.  Mouthfeel: Carbonation is in abundance from this medium-bodied beer. It's quite smooth and creamy.

42,141,Immortale25,4.34,"Poured into an oversized snifter. Bottleneck says Best By 05/20/15.  A- Pours a medium golden color with a 1/4 inch white head that doesn't retain long before becoming a thick ring around the edge of the glass and a large center patch of surface foam. Non-resilient lacing leaves a thick ring behind on the glass.  S- Inviting Saison yeast aroma brings notes of banana, faint spice and lemon. Effervescent with a tinge of alcohol.  T- Juicy flavor with notes of citrus as well as some banana and bubble gum. Some wheat malt flavor is present plus a bit of alcohol but everything flows in harmony making for a delightful drink.  M- Semi-spritzy from the medium-high carbonation. Light body.  O- It's been years since I've had this and it makes me wonder why I haven't revisited it in so long.

42,141,StoutHunter,4.21,"I picked up a bottle of Brewery Ommegang's Hennepin last month for $3.45 at Boyne Country Provisions. It's another warm night in Mid Michigan and a Saison sounds pretty good right now, so lets see how it goes. Bottled on October 12, 2012.. Poured from a brown 12oz bottle into a tulip.  A- The label looks nice, it's got a nice simple look to it and I think it looks better than the old label. It poured a cloudy straw yellow color that took on a slight golden hue when held to the light with three fingers worth of fluffy white head that died down to a thin ring that stayed till the end and left a little bit of lacing behind. This is a good looking Saison, I have no complaints.  S- The aroma starts off with a slightly higher medium amount of sweetness that had a slight honey aroma to it and was followed by some Belgian yeast that imparts a medium amount of clove and banana aromas. Up next comes some a lighter amount of grainy and bready malts followed by lots of nice citrus aromas with lemons and citrus rind sticking out the most with some typical spicy Saison aromas in the background. I thought the aroma was pretty damn good and very true to style.  T- The taste seems to be pretty similar to the aroma and it starts off with a medium amount of sweetness followed by a good amount of citrus flavors with with lemons and citrus rinds still sticking out the most followed by some Belgian yeast that imparts some banana and clove flavors. Up next comes some spicy Saison flavors with a light Farmhouse flavor imparting a slight straw like flavor. On the finish there's a lighter amount of medium bitterness with an earthy, citrus and spicy aftertaste. This was a pretty good tasting Saison, but i wish the Farmhouse aspect came out a little more.  M- Pretty smooth, very crisp, clean, fairly prickly, dry, medium bodied, with a higher amount of carbonation. The mouthfeel was good and true to style, but I thought it was a little prickly.  Overall I thought this was pretty good beer and a very good example of the style, it had all the aspects that I look for in this style and I think it's pretty close to being as good as Saison Dupont which is my favorite of the style and I think I will have to try the two side by side to really find out which one I prefer. This beer had great drinkability, it was pretty smooth, clean, not filling, pretty refreshing, and the flavors did a great job at holding my attention, I could drink a few of these easily, I think it's a great summertime Saison. What I like the most about this beer was the how true to style it was, it had pretty much everything that I look for in a good Saison. What I liked the least about this beer was the how little the farmhouse aspect showed up, i wouldn't mind if it imparted a little more funk and typical Farmhouse flavors. I would buy this beer again when looking for a nice Saison, it's a little pricey but it is cheaper than Saison Dupont, but I don't think I would buy this all the time. I would recommend it to anyone who likes Saisons. All in All i was pretty impressed with this beer, I wasn't so impressed with their Belgian Pale Ale, but this beer turned out pretty damn good and I'm now a little more interested in checking out more of Brewery Ommegang's Lineup. Good job guys, I really enjoyed this Saison.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Aleks_P,4.29,"Appearance: Very light golden yellow with a significant amount of carbonation, like champagne but a little more yellow. Very full bubbly head, could not pour the full bottle into my pint glass.  Smell: Having a hard time articulating the smell. Bit peppery/spicy I suppose. Bottle says coriander but I'm not sure I know what coriander smells like, this might be it.  Taste: Definitely tastes like a farmhouse saison. Slight bitterness and a lot of fragrant earthy spices.  Mouthfeel: Very light and pleasant, probably the best part of the beer. High carbonation lightens even further. Very smooth, not dry. The spices are very evident in the aftertaste.  Overall: I've only had a couple of these farmhouse saisons but I really enjoyed this. Just a bubbly tasty beer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

42,141,Bosoxfan20,4.43,"A- Vibrant golden orange with a 2.5 finger head that only sticks around for a bit. A ring of foam continues to see this drink through  S- Smells of citrus, coriander, apples, pears, sweet pale malts, cracker bread, hay, and phenolic spices. Fruity, yet musky.  T- All the wonderful qualities the aroma brought, but then kicks them all up a notch. Smooth, mellow, full flavored. Its not overly complex, but the way the layers of flavor bring together the sweetness, spice, tart, citrus hops, and phenols works so well. A touch of cracker dryness from the yeast as well as some clove. Not as much ""funk"" as others of the style, but I prefer the subtle Belgian yeast.  M- Light, crisp, refreshing. Smooth with no bitterness. Carbonation is spot on as it creates a tingling effect as though it is dancing on your tongue. The beauty of this one is how it makes you yearn for more. So drinkable.  O- One of my favorite saisons. It is difficult to beat the price and availability of such a fantastic representation of the style. Ommegang makes it look almost easy here. Maybe the best year round saison IMO.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Libationguy,4.12,"Hazy deep straw color with a lot of orange to it. Bright white 1-finger head with medium retention and light lacing in the glass.  Kind of funky on the nose in a good way: orange peel, lemon zest, coriander, grain, mint, white flowers and the thread of a light sour lactic note that pulls through everything.  Old world feel from the new world with a light hop funk, white pepper, earthiness, white flowers and celery seed. Light bitterness allows the palate to keep deep earthy tones and still feel clean on the finish.  Medium bodied. The carbonation is a little aggressive in the mouthfeel, giving the beer a slightly frothy texture. A very faint hint of alcohol on the finish.  Nicely done. Surprised that the carbonation was as aggressive as it was on the palate based on the appearance, but there are several things going on with the beer. Solid execution of the style.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

S: That big Belgian nose, yeasty and bready, lemon, spicy notes (a bit of pepper).  T: All those wonderful Belgian flavors, yeasty with a touch of malt in the background, spicy notes (pepper and coriander), lemon zest, some tart citrus. Some slight bittering hops drying the finish out.  M: Medium body, smooth, round, and full; lots of carbonation.  O: A great balanced beer with an awesome appearance and small…and it tastes great.

42,141,zac16125,4.11,"750mL bottle into a Teku no bottling dates  A: Pours a slightly hazy, urine yellow with 3plus fingers width of bright white head. Head has good retention and leaves a moderate amount of patchy lacing.  S: Spicy and yeasty, like a Belgium strong pale or tripel. Clove, pepper, and nutmeg. Coriander and grains of paradise. Faint citrus notes, and a floral, almost sage-like character.  T: Spicy like the nose, along with some sweet fruit notes. Clove and ginger. Grains of paradise and orange citrus. There is some funk as well that I didnt really pick up on in the nose. Vanilla, as if from an oak barrel, in the aftertaste. The funk builds as you drink, and reminds you that you are drinking a saison.  M/D: Medium body, very heavy carbonation, ABV completely masked. Drinkability is somewhat limited because the carbonation is so high, but a nice mouthfeel.  O: This is the standard of the style in the eyes of many people, and I see why. Hits all the notes that a Saison should. Personally, I prefer my Saisons with some tartness, and Fantome is still the epitome of the Saison to me. This is a great beer though.

42,141,joeseppy,4.16,"Notes from Sunday Aug 04 2012  Cloudy golden yellow pour. Large foamy head, have patience when pouring.  Smells yeasty, tannic, lemon-pepper spice, apricot, clove and malt.  Light malt citrus flavor followed by a lingering lemon pepper spice and yeast.  Loads of carbonation, dry crisp finish.  My lawn tractor is broke and my .75 acre lawn is six inches long. Borrowing my neighbors lawn mower with a broken drive, I had to push. Temp was apx 85 F and sunny. I was really looking forward to this after mowing feeling like a farm laborer. Man, this hit the spot and was ever so refreshing. Thoughts kept going towards how this really compares to Saison Dupont, my first saison. I just love a beckoning saison like this on warmer summer sunny days-good memories to have.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,barczar,4.04,"Pours a hazy golden with a billowing ivory head that lingers indefinitely.  Notes of pear, clove, banana, coriander, bruised apples, and flowers form the initial aroma. Very strong. Musty, earthy scents complement horse blanket, orange peel, and perfume.  Flavor reveals more barnyard funk, with an earthy, slightly bready backbone, finishing a touch dry, slightly bitter, and peppery. Citrusy underpinnings of lemon and muted orange are countered by spicy clove and white pepper. Banana esters are subtle. Pear really dominates.  Body is moderate and creamy, with high, effervescent carbonation that lifts the flavor from the palate, hiding the high abv well.  Very flavorful example of the style. Not a fan of banana esters, and this isn't my favorite style, but a refreshing beer. Plasticy phenols were a bit of a turnoff, too. While I'm complaining,I find the carbonation to be too high.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

42,141,RonaldTheriot,4.57,"Ommegang Hennepin has a rather thin, fizzy, root beer-like, off-white head and a hazy, extremely bubbly, lemon-yellow appearance, with some lacing left behind. This beer clouds up, once the bottom caked brown substance is swished loose and poured in. The aroma is of citrus zest, sugar, biscuit, spices, and candy, and the flavor is of all that, with some mellow bitterness detected in the background. Mouthfeel is medium and prickly, and Ommegang Hennepin finishes champagne dry, refreshing, lively, and very drinkable for a 7%+ alcohol beer. Overall, it’s really wonderful, and I score it most excellent. I would like to try a stripped-down version, without the spices to see how it holds up.

Lots of little bubbles. Looks very inviting  Smells grainy. There is a lot of coriander and/or orange zest in here. The grains of paradise aroma is evident - anyone who has had a sam adams will recognize it. There is a funky Belgian yeast smell too characteristic of the style but not as much as I would have expected  The taste is very funky. Earthy grainy tones form the backbone of this one. There is some sweet ginger and orange. I taste some hay and grass. Not so much spicy as zesty. Citrusy. Lingering yeasty aftertaste is slightly weizen-like (banana and clove)  Feels crisp and biting. I feel like the carbonation makes the tongue tingle more than the spiciness but either way this is a lively brew.  Overall a great saison. Rustic yet elegant. Crisp and refreshing. Lots of flavor.

Wafts of carbonation with loose bubbles surrounding it.  S: Surprising for my expectations; a little skunky, with hints of corn and yeast funk, not unlike beers seen at frat parties. Some fruit esters underneath it all; passionfruit, peach, lemon peel. Good saison character.  T: Great improvement from the smell. Orange and lemon peels, mild malt, a bit of wheat and funk. Ever so slightly sweet, manifesting as honey. Quick finish, with added strawberry hints, but I can't expect a beer this light-feeling to stick around for long. Oh well, guess I'll have to sip it again.  M: Light and highly carbonated, super refreshing. Just what I was looking for.  O: A very refreshing Saison, exactly what I wanted on a hot night like tonight. The flavors could be a bit stronger, but none of them were bad.

42,141,scotorum,3.49,"I really like Ommegang's packaging and labelling, which is attractive and announces a quality product. And I enjoyed my sampling of their Three Philosophers at the Green River Brewfest in June. So ready to give more of their line a try.  Poured into a tulip glass from the 12 oz. bottle. Bottling date smeared but looks like it might be 2/25/12. So not so fresh, although it has a ""Best by"" of something something 2014.  Translucent amber topped by a finger thick white head which receded to an even white surface foam film and thick even lacing. I had poured directly down into the glass as usual, instead of slowly as the label instructed. Oops. So I got the yeast sediments, which no doubt affected the taste.  s: Ripe fruit  t: Soap and mild ripe fruit.  m: Smoothly light to moderate, leaning to moderate.  o: The label says it should be hoppy but it's not so much. Does not taste as fruity as drinking proceeds. Nearing the finish line, smoothness stands out and it's quite decent.  This experience has not daunted me to try the many other Ommegang offerings, or even a fresher example of Hennepin.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,falloutsnow,4.13,"From: Binny's, Bloomingdale, IL Date: Best by 9/2014 Glass: New Belgium globe glass  Hennepin has long been a favorite saison, and I was glad to have a bottle to review. It was interesting to compare this to Boulevard's Tank 7, which I had the ability to try earlier in the day. Though likely using the same or similar yeast strains, the breweries produce two very different beers. Ommegang gives us a yeast, herb, and spice-forward saison, full of rich and hearty flavors, whereas the Boulevard was brighter, hoppier, and less dense. Hennepin is thus perhaps suited for cooler days, despite it's lower ABV, as the richer, heavier flavors seem more suited to this.  Pours a tall, voluminous head (~4cm) of fairly clean, white foam, made up of very small bubbles, leading to a frothy appearance. Retention is excellent, lasting several minutes in a slow decline to a 0.5cm cap atop the body of the beer. Lacing is similarly superb, thick clumps and webs cling to the insides of the glass. Body is a bright golden yellow color, hazy (50-60% opaque), light bringing out significantly paler golden yellow hues. Carbonation is readily visible, moderate in number and fairly vigorous in activity.  Aroma of yeast, dried lemon and orange peel, with lesser banana, mustiness, modest phenolics (spicy and marginally clove-like), and when warm, green apple.  Front of palate yields a very rich, hearty flavor, with pale malt sweetness, robust Belgian yeast, banana-like esters, mild mustiness, coriander, slight vanilla, and a light orange and lemon peel character. Mid-palate continues with hearty yeast flavors, banana-like esters, along with slightly peppery and lemony grains of paradise, slightly spicy Belgian yeast-produced phenols, slight mustiness, coriander, mild orange and lemon peel, and a pleasantly sweet pale malt backbone. Back of palate features increased grains of paradise (peppery, vague lemon) and Belgian yeast phenols (spicy, sharp) with notable banana ester, a dash of pineapple, and faint mustiness. Aftertaste is superb, with Belgian yeast, banana, pineapple and lightly sweet pale malts joining everything together.  Beer is medium to medium-light in body, with carbonation of medium intensity, leading to a slightly fizzy, though never prickly or painful, mouthfeel that settles into a thin blanket of foam on the tongue. Closes fairly dry, with little residual stickiness on the palate.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,jngrizzaffi,3.81,Pours a very hazy golden color with a thick head. Head retention is good. Lacing is decent. Has the funky yeasty fruity aroma. A little more hop and a little less fruit would be nice. Strong yeasty funk taste with very fruity aftertaste. It is a little on the sweet side but still good. Still would prefer a little more hop to it.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

42,141,KYGunner,3.96,"I had barely poured an ounce in the glass and got three inches of bubbly foam, that's how alive this brew is. After a more deliberate pour I was able to achieve a solid head of soapy bubbles crest above the glass resembling merange. The color was bright golden with a current of bubbles emanating from the bottom.  Strong hints of banana and clove with sweet notes of bubblegum, the scent is fragrant but not overly complex.  The taste is a deeply satisfying melding of malt, grain and yeast. The yeast characteristics come through stronger with a sweetness and spiciness. The banana, clove and bubblegum-like flavor are more subtle than in the nose and attach to the malt and grain.  The feel is very full and the massive carbonation dissipated after letting it sit.

Some notes of clove and coriander, orange peel, and some other exotic spices.  mouthfeel: medium to high carbonation, pretty thin bodied  overall: A great saison, probably only second to Saison Dupont in my opinion.

Some honey and yeast.  T - Very sweet, yet still light. Full of light malt and yeast flavors, and a slight aftertaste (not at all unpleasant). A hint of wine flavor cold; as it warms, it becomes mellower.  M - Medium to light. Slightly syrupy, coats the mouth.  O - This is similar to a Belgian Pale Ale, but lighter. It's a very good beer, and definitely enjoyable on a scorching hot day. The ABV is a little high for a ""refreshing"" drink, but you certainly don't notice as you're drinking.

42,141,BethanyB,3.66,"Appearance: A slightly hazy true yellow, with a foamy white head that persists like a barricade. The head was something I found myself having to fight through, but I know it's typical of the style. I expected the color to be slightly darker.  Smell: The aroma is light, yet beckoning, and typical of a saison. The main smells were of apricot and biscuit malt, and were accompanied by a breath of spicy hops.  Taste: A thirst-quenching blend of light malt, citrus fruit, sprinkled spices, and honey. A somewhat dry finish leaves little aftertaste at first, then suddenly gives way to a smattering of hops that have been gently warmed by alcohol. Very true to style.  Mouthfeel: The beer's medium-light mouthfeel and high carbonation is refreshing...once you claw your tongue past the seemingly never-ending foam party that is the head.  Overall: A very pleasant saison, but overall, nothing terribly special. I was a teensy bit irritated by the fact that I had to fight through the fizzy head to get to the liquid, no matter how much time went by or exactly how I poured the brew. Not sure I would seek it out in the future, but I certainly wouldn't turn it down.

Massive four-finger, fluffy white head atop a body that's a cloudy straw color. I can see yeast sediments! (I love yeast sediment.)  The scent is full of grainy yeast, bananas and green apples, cloves, ginger, and sweet, buttery corn, believe it or not. An outstanding combination.  It tastes straightforward and GOOD. Yeasty, sweet white bread infused with a bit of dry, fruity tartness.  The feel is totally crisp and refreshing. That's all.  An awesome saison and fantastic American take on a Belgian ale style.

42,141,mattcrill,4.25,"Aroma: Moderate clove and white pepper aromas up front. Background fruity esters that remind me of fresh cut musk melon and cantaloupe. Possibly some earthy hop aromatics.  Appearance: Cloudy amber pour with a fluffy white cap that retains well.  Flavor: More ripe melons, slightly peppery, mild clove. Earthy hop bitterness balances out the light crackery malt base. Balance is to the spiciness/bitterness. Finish is very clean and dry.  Mouthfeel: Light bodied and spritzy. Carbonic bite is appropriate. No alcohol heat, creaminess, or astringency.  Overall impression: Well crafted and well worth the hype. Not my favorite style but I can understand why it gets good press.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Highly recommended.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,utopiajane,4.45,"Hennepin is my everyday favorite from Ommegang. It’s a lighthearted, somewhat prickly farmhouse saison. Pours a cloudy straw yellow with a great big head that lasts. Laces well. The citrus is not as prominent as some saisons but it’s there, and it’s not sour. Earthy flavors lend balance to the forwardly floral hops. The malt exudes a tender sweetness that’s somehow masculine. A great saison, easy to drink, mellow, a little peppery. Mouthfeel is crisp and light. In the glass this beer is equitable and upright. Bravo!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Body is relatively hazy with quite a bit of fine suspended sediment.  Smell: Lots of spices. Clove, coriander, banana, white pepper, and orange. Big Belgian yeast character.  Taste: Follows the nose, with the orange, citrus character being more pronounced than in the aroma. Slightly tart upfront and through the finish. Citrus, spice and yeast characters are all present, without one overwhelming the other.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and crisp. Carbonation is on the high end of medium.

42,141,ElijahRivera,4.25,"750ml bottle packaged on 6/21/13, best by 06/2015, and consumed in September of 2013.  A- Hazy golden body. Many streams of small champagne-like carbonation rising to the surface in support of a big, foamy, white head.  S- Lemon zest, hay, some spice and esters. Very subtle. Not getting smacked in the face with anything.  T- The flavors are not to subtle. Spices, bitter lemon rind, some and some numbing retro-olfaction from the ginger all rear their beautiful heads. However, the ginger flavor on the palate is not very distinct, and the sweetness takes a back seat to the dry, bitter, aromatic complexities of the hops, coriander, orange peel, and ginger.  M- Dry, crisp, chalky, fizzy, tingly and solidly medium bodied. The finish is very dry, and hits pretty hard with bitter, tart flavors that evolve long into the aftertaste.  O- Very refreshing and a bit more sour, sharp and bitter than I remember it being the last time I had a growler of it.

Nice spice notes of coriander and black pepper. With the spices it contains earthy clove, banana, baked bread and orange rind. All these different aromas mix in very well with one another.  T-The taste of this beer is amazing all around and follows suit with the smell. Citrus, coriander and clove. At the end of the palate has a dank earthiness with the banana like sweetness coming out. Very enjoyable balanace with the malts and hops. Finishes with a refined bitterness that does not last long.  M-Medium, effervescent body. Not as dry of a finish as I was expecting.

42,141,mick303,4.24,"Poured into a tulip glass, this is a hazy blond gold with an excellent cap of sticky white head, good head retention and lacing.  S – a lemon note accompanied by a wonderful full yeast character, lending slight farmy and musty notes but without a noticeable brett character. Notes of banana, cinnamon, lemon zest. Good firm yeast profile holding it together.  T – creamy body with a pleasant gentle crispness, earthiness, lemon citrus, florals come through nicely, full yeast with gentle spices coming in, musty, slight ginger, distinct earthy aspect with some great complexities flowing throughout. Leading to a dry finish, with a stony and dry malt note. Lingering aftertaste with a gentle spice and dry citrus.  M – full creamy feel initially, soft carbonation, letting the yeasty complexities come through nicely, leads to a dry finish with a really nice crispness. An absolute pleasure to drink, full satisfying feel that is pleasantly crisp and refreshing. Malt and yeast compliment each other nicely.  A true class act. Nice mix of earthy and musty notes in the mix and a fair bit of citrus hops.

42,141,raoulduke25,4.32,"This was a gift from a dear friend. Much appreciated, bro.  The first thing I notice is that no matter how slowly and methodically I pour it, a foamy head quickly develops. The beer pours smoothly and after it is done, there appear in the glass tiny colloidal particles that hang suspended in the glass, through the entire depth.  The smell is heavenly, soft, unobtrusive. A light malt waft is sensed when one dips his nose into the glass.  The taste is mellow but not without complexity. It's almost as if too many layers exist to parse in one sip. Hence, many sips were taken to identify all the many parts, but I remained unsuccessful in my ability catalogue them all.  The mouthfeel, though admittedly unimportant compared to taste, was much less viscous than one would think based on appearance.

I also get a bit of grass, and some mineral rich well water. Srs.  T: This beer is sweet to start with a nice light malt bill. As it shirts to the back of the palate I get that grassy taste and bit of light citrus. Once the beer has moved off the tongue, the spices begin to shine. I get big pepper notes as it dries.  M: Light bodied beer. This is an incredibly easy drinker for a 7.7% beer. It's sweet and wet to start tightens up in the middle and get really dry on the back end. The spice shines through as it dries and it lingers until the next sip.  O: This is a really nice beer, but It's not my favorite saison.

42,141,Maxwell,4.12,"The beer pours pale, golden yellow with a lot of chunks and carbonation bubbles circling around. The beer pours with a nice tight white head on it that settles to a quarter of a fingers width and leaves a thin lacing of tight, dry bubbles. On the nose, the beer smells strongly of spiced coriander with hints of orange peel, and ginger. There is also distinct bananay yeast in the background giving lovely character to the nose, while the hops and yeast are properly downplayed with lights notes of grass and hay and some wheat notes. On the tongue, the beer tastes creamy sweet and grassy bitter with lots of spice character. The flavor begins as orange peel and light wheat malt before being steamrolled away by heavy coriander spices with hints of pickling ginger. This moves into bitter grassy hops and banana yeast. The finish gives a fresh kiss of coriander infused orange juice with just a hint of sweet wheat bread before mellowing into an aftertaste of light coriander spice and yeasty banana funk. In the mouth, the beer tastes creamy smooth and medium in body with a touch of fierce carbonation that mellows into a clean scrubbing of the tongue. The mouth is left slightly dry but clean. Overall this is a solid and interestingly flavored beer. They’re a little heavy handed with the coriander spicing, which hurts the other flavors, but these flavors still show through and are beautiful and fresh in feel. This is a classic American saison in a Belgian-style. Worth a try.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,BigBarley,3.39,"Pours a crisp, bright gold. Almost completely clear, with the exception of the swirling sediment and the extremely active carbonation. Yields about 1.5 fingers of head that recedes over time to a floating cap of foam.  Fresh banana and clove smell up front, touch of citrus and coriander right below. Stand out smells of wild yeast all around. Fits the style well, keeping that funk balanced with the sweet, fruity undertones  Interesting. There's a bitterness wrapped around this beer that gives it a sour flavor. Very sweet but subdued by the funky presence. Similar to some Hefe flavors, with the presence of coriander and a clove taste, but the dominant quality is this funky sourness. Pretty interesting to say the least.  Somewhat thick, but refreshing in it's own way. Pretty much the standard mouth for the style, but goes down easier than some.  Not a bad Saison, but the flavor doesn't really wow me. It's enjoyable, but it doesn't really surprise or excite, and it falls short because of the way some notes clash.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

T - mild sweet bubblegum that has spice in the background that makes it more enjoyable. slightly dry. crisp. hops are there but their bitterness is mixed with the dryness so it's hard to differentiate, but definitely refreshing and enjoyable.  M - Carbonation is definitely refreshing, but not overwhelming with too much of it. Slight sweet syrup touch, slick, i'd say.  O - didnt quite live up to the hype for me, but this is just my second saison. If I would drink it again, It'd be on a hot summer day and I would've had it nearly ice cold.

The color is a cloudy or hazy yellow (like most Belgium beers); nothing can be seen on the other side of the glass except light. Lacings were present.  I smelled cloves, other spices, gingerbread and some apricots. I do get ripen bananas as well!  It taste great. It has a fruity flavor yet it was not too sweet like I expected it to be. I have to admit this is my first Saison beer. There is an equal of sweetness and bitterness which makes this great. It also had that spiciness that came with the smell of cloves and other spices.  I opened this bottle in March but I have read that it is really refreshing to indulge during the summer months. I do think this beer complements well with all seasons. Drinking it right now felt like a perfect occasion. It could be opened on a cold rainy day or on a hot sunny day.

The saison color is very nice to look at and gives off a bit of a nice body look.  The beer smell is a nice and bready Ommegang yeast smell with a pretty good bitter and lemonish hop note. The hop is the stronger note but the yeast gives a nice balance to it. There also seems to be a slight funky smell that reminds me of a farmhouse to it as well.  The taste shares the same note as the smell but the funk is a little bit stronger and mixes very well with the bitter hop taste. The yeast is bit more stronger and visible in the taste, which is good.  The mouthfeel is a bit heavy but still nice and refreshing. The carbonation is pretty biting and a smooth finish.  Overall, a very good saison and one always worth coming back to.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Appearance - Pours a nice golden color with a big thick, pillowy head of about two fingers that had great retention, probably more than five minutes. I love the bottles that Ommegang uses, very unique and cool.  Smell - Bananas and spices, some citrus from the hops, yeast, and cloves round out the smell. Not as pronounced of a smell as something like Orval, but a well balanced nose that is quality.  Taste - Follows the nose, although a little more subdued. The spices and yeast make their appearance, finishing with a touch of hops.  Mouthfeel - Finishes smooth, easy to drink this beer. Medium carbonation with a fairly dry finish.  Overall - This is a good beer, nothing spectacular, but good. I would rather have a couple of the other Saisons instead, but there is nothing wrong with this one.

42,141,spoony,4.44,"Reviewed from notes date January 27, 2013.  From a 355 ml bottle into a tulip.  A-The brew pours with a big, shiny, white head of foam. The head is slow to fade. The beer is clear and golden in color with a lot of visible carbonation.  S-The smell is spicy and crisp. I detect straw, hay, and lemon, as well as a touch of honey. Underlying the mixture is a powdery yeast scent. Complex and pleasing.  T-The taste follows the smell in flavor and complexity. There is less honey and more lemon (lemon curd to be accurate). The flavors are predominantly dry, grassy, and crisp. The finish is long lasting and drying.  M-Mouthfeel is an example for the style. The brew is nicely carbonated with a lighter body. This brew is crisp and easy to drink, but full of flavor.  O-This is one of my favorite saisons ever (new or old world). Ommegang really hits on all cylinders here: the brew is good looking, it smells nice (love the crisp lemon and honey), the taste is complex, and the feel is well-matched to the flavor profile. I will definitely drink this again.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Smell is citrusy, predominantly lime. also a vague fruitiness and spiciness.  Taste is a muted version of the nose. Not unpleasant in the least, but not as flavorful as I had hoped given the awesome smell.  Mouthfeel seems a bit off for me. Perhaps undercarbonated, but given the massive head, perhaps something else is off. Can't put my finger on it.

42,141,JMS1512,4.8,"On the docket: 12 oz. bottle of Ommegang's Hennepin Farmhouse Saison. best by date: 11/20/17.  Poured into: River Horse craft glass  S: Honey-gold and packed full of fine bubbles, this one sits under an airy, thick off-white head. Delicate lacing and good evidence of carbonation. Just a bit hazy due to a vigorous pour.  A: Spicy phenols and actual spices dominate the nose, with coriander and orange most prominent. Explore the nose further and you might pick up just a touch of malty sweetness and the piquant ginger. No real hop aroma unless they're earthy and floral, adding to the already adventurous bouquet. As it warms, the alcohol shows itself as a slight prickle to the nostrils.  T: The spice blend carries over into the palate, plus a blend of clove, cinnamon and citrus. Midway through, the malt provides a husky, grainy sweetness that counters the spice element. The finish is short and sweetish, though the spices do appear briefly.  F: Fine, effervescent, tingly bubbles. This beer is great at scrubbing down your mouth and would lend itself to cleanse your palate after heavy sauces like hickory-smoked barbecue. Medium bodied, and the slightest bit chewy. Short finish, quite dry.  O: One of the easiest examples of the style, fulfilling all the hallmarks of a well-made saison. Capable of multi-tasking, and has potential to age a year or two (7.7% abv) to mellow out the spices and integrate the alcohol.  Suggested food pairing: Versatile beer able to take on sauce-glazed meat such as boneless barbecue chicken thighs, spicy Asian cuisine, steamed clams and shrimp, or creamy cheese. Enjoy on its own as a cocktail beer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Mavigo,4.36,"I've been waiting on this guy for a long time, Costco had a holiday special a few months ago, 3 bottles (750ml) for the price of 2, good deal. Served in a snifter.  A: Pours a hazy golden color with a nice 3/4-1 inch soapy white head that lasts for a few minutes before shrinking down to a thin white layer with bits of lacing. Constantly bubbling.  S: Nice aroma going here, wheat, malts, yeast, floral hues, hops, the combination of these gives a champagne like scent, has citrus notes to it, very sweet,  T: Good sweetness to it, very smooth, yeast and wheat flavors predominate, with hints of spices and has a good hop presence to it, very well balanced, very delicious,  M: Has moderate amounts of carbonation and is full bodied, very well balanced in all aspects, has little bitterness from its mild hops and spices, it is quite enjoyable.  O: Overall the wait paid off, this beer is a bit expensive, but for the deal I got, it's in amazing gig, but cost aside, this is a great beer, I mean it's perfectly balanced, rich, robust, and smooth all at the same time, great with food, excellent craftsmanship, a must try for everyone.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Beerstorian,3.73,"Poured into a tall tulip glass.  Aroma: A light malt nose. None of the clove-y esters one would expect from a saison. Almost no aroma.  Appearance: Yellow-orange, with ruby highlights at the edges. Nice whipped meringue head.  Taste: Malty, sweet, and clove-t. Close to style, but a bit harsh.  Mouthfeel: Sharp.  Overall: I like this beer, and have it every chance I get. But when I finally set down to review it, it didn't hit the style notes I thought it would. It's perhaps a too-commercialized version of a saison.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

42,141,DMXLOX22,4.02,"Picked up a bottle of this brew fresh from the brewery after visiting/vacationing a nice snowstorm in Cooperstown, NY. Lets see how this ranks up.  Appearance: Pours a golden, foggy hue. Leaves behind a pure white, fluffy white, frothy head that looks utterly appetizing. Leaves behind some very nice lacing.  Smell: The aroma packs a slight hint of fruit, some admirable spice. Some alcohol is also in the mix. Fair Belgian hops can be also scented.  Taste: Has a well-balanced sweetness and actually some fruit flavors that come to mind like apples, pears, raisins. The yeast comes to the palate towards the end of a sip, along with some gentle spices.  Mouthfeel: Medium carbonation that actually goes down quite easily. Nothing intimating at all about it. Has a great balance between sweetness and bitterness. Awesome job.  Overall: Liked the look of this beer and actually liked holding the bottle once I first grabbed it. Something told me this was going to be a special one, and boy was it! Quite disappointined this perticular beer isn't widely available in PA, but I'm sure I can do some hunting and locate it. I would recommend this beer to anyone interested in trying a traditional Saison. Cheers!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,BedetheVenerable,4.35,"Presentation: Corked and caged brown Belgian-style 750ml bottle, with the old-style label (I'm one of those who likes the new labels a bit better). Best by December 17th, 2013 clearly stamped. Poured into my Hennepin chalice. Thanks to the wife for picking this up for me today to celebrate getting a new job. Love ya babe!  Appearance: Rich straw-gold beer with just a hint of haziness, this pours with a large brilliantly white, fluffly yet cream cap that shows good retention. Medium-high levels of carbonation. Really nice looking brew.  Smell: This starts off with clean, grainy notes reminiscent of the best European Pilseners, but with a soft, yeasty notes of golden fruit, white grapes, and hints of bubblegum in the background.  Taste: Slightly musty (in a good way) golden fruit, firm clean bitterness that feels a bit more than the 24 IBUs, with a bit of earthy hop flavor. I certainly can't pick out the coriander, ginger, grains of paradise and sweet orange peel that this is brewed with, but there is a subtle spicy character that is nice. A pleasant, unobtrusive, hint of alcohol. Sweet, golden-fruit flavors combine with firm bitterness, cleansing alcohol and a clean finish to produce a well-balanced, refreshing beer.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied and smooth.  Overall: Very simply the best American-made saison I've had the pleasure to try (though this particular batch was brewed in Belgium). I generally favor Belgian versions (like Dupont) over American interpretations, but this one is really damn-near world class, especially as it's priced at around $7.99 a bottle.  93-94 A",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,biteme398,4.34,"From a 750ml bottle as part of a Ommegang variety pack. Very tall head that recedes slowly. A fairly pale color with some hints of amber. The smell seems similar to a pilsner; very crisp and clean with some flowery hints. The taste is very interesting. Almost like a pilsner and wheat beer combination. Some sweetness at the end leaves you wanting more. Although I am not very familiar with the saison style, this is a very good beer overall.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

A: Poured a bright, yet murky orange color, with a pillowy, cloud-like formation posing as a head on top.  S: Coriander and orange peel upfront, followed by some banana pudding, and candy component reminiscent of ""Pixie Stick"" dust.  T: The finish on this is really harsh and not entirely pleasant to my taste buds. A bit too alcoholic, and a bit too grainy and bitter for my liking. I think that if some pepper were added to the overall profile, it might have been more fun and interesting.  M: I dug the carbonation bill.... very spritzy and champagne-like, but the bitter lingering was substantial. A good bit of lacing on the glass.

A mild spicy, fruity aroma.  Flavors of pepper, cloves, citrus and a musty earthiness in the background.  A medium bodied beer with a crisp finish and moderate to heavy carbonation.  A nicely balanced if fairly tame example of the style. I prefer my saisons with a little more of that farmhouse funk to them.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,tectactoe,3.98,"Poured from a bottle to a pint glass. Starts off a pale straw color, reasonable clarity at first, with a bunch of carbonation bubbles floating around. Within seconds, a haze takes it over and all of a sudden it becomes almost a completely opaque, peachy, light amber color. Interesting. Foamy, white head settles but lasts, looks to be a pretty volatile beer.  The aroma consists of a nice little concoction of spices; faint white pepper, heavy clove. Fruity and earthy esters are abound, with just a hint of that bubble-gum aroma that is so common with Belgian yeast. Some light fruits on the nose as well. Not picking up much of the ""farmhouse"" side of things, at least on the nose.  Hennepin hits the palate light and crispy with heavy carbonation, it almost seems to evaporate away inside of your mouth. Fruity esters take over right from the start; pear skins, apple skins, faint banana, and even some kind of melon... maybe honeydew? Something unique that I can't quite put my finger on. Clove crowds the background from start to finish, which is to be expected, but it doesn't overpower or distract the other flavors thankfully. Just a touch of mint and white pepper to go along with the clove spices.  The bubble-gum like taste comes out a little more as the beer gets warmer. About three-quarters of the way through the sip and riding strong into the aftertaste is the ""farmhouse"" funk. Some wet, musky, corky, funk flavors come out and satisfy their share of the workload. It's noticeable, but subdued and controlled at the same time. Executed very nicely; I'd like to think this is a decent amount of ""beginner funk"" - a good way to introduce new people into the work of funk without scaring them away with something crazy like Fantome.  Very good beer - almost similar to a Belgian tripel, but more spicy and less sweet. The added farmhouse funk on the tail end adds a different elements, as well as some unidentifiable fruit. Very pleasing, I'd definitely have this one again.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,SeamusDoyle,4.24,"Pours a golden orange with a foamy white head which fades to decent lacing. Aroma is of citrus, baked bread, yeast, cloves, some sour fruit, and some earthy funk.

42,141,AmitC,4.19,"Poured from a one off 12 oz bottle bought from Atlanta GA.  Pale yellow, a bit strawish color. Very unclear and a lot of haze. Head is around two fingers thick of white color, creamy and fluffy. Receding head leaves an excellent Belgian lacing on the sides. Good retention, stays for a long time. Super bubbly. A lot of finely suspended yeast.  A lot of typical Belgian ale fruity notes. A very good burst of pepper like phenolic and noble hop smell bursts as soon as the cap is half open. No apparent alcohol though it is only 7.7%. Some spiciness. Strength is moderately strong.  Taste is much better than the nose. Enters with upfront spiciness and crispiness. Phenols give a mix of pepper, clove and coriander taste. Some dry nutty feel towards the end. Some minor noble hops provide freshness and prevent any malt effect from coming forward. Overall finish is dry with some tartness. Very fine.  Mouth feel is medium light to slightly medium bodied. Abundant carbonation. Effervescent. No astringency of any kind.

42,141,hagbergl,4.01,"It's crazy I haven't reviewed this old standby, the first Saison/Farmhouse I ever tried. Served in a pint glass at The Pub, University of Chicago, where there's always something tasty and domestic on tap.  Appearance (3.75/5): Hennepin is light yellow, straw-colored, a smooth, dense white head of foam tops it off, coming in at about two-fingers. Slightly hazy, though a little too clear for a Saison, in my opinion.  Smell (4/5): Lemony, grassy, smooth herbal hoppiness, some interesting yeastiness (a little spicy, a little funky) going on as well, and sweet pale malt. I really enjoy the melange of grassy/herbal hops, the yeast funk, and the light sweetness of the malt. Subtle. Well-engineered nose going on here.  Taste (4/5): Lightly hopped, floral, grassy, sweet bready malt, green apple. Some yeasty spice, light citrus, lemony, and lemongrass. Refreshing. Mellow, and despite its relatively strong ABV (compared to most Saisons, this is big 'un), no alcohol is present in the flavor–nice job on that, for sure. This is a solid tasting Saison.  Mouthfeel (4.25/5): Hennepin sports medium carbonation and medium body, both appropriate to the style and to what I believe the brewery's going for. It has a very nice light prickliness to it. The mouthfeel is also dry, champagne-like.  Overall (4/5): Hennepin is a quality Saison that really nails the essential flavor hallmarks of the style. And while it doesn't feature anything particularly adventurous, creative, or outlandish, it's still quite a pleasant beer and a wonderful introduction to the style. That I would recommend either Hennepin or Saison Dupont to those who have never had a Belgian-style Saison is a testament to how well Ommegang's creation stands up to the imported examples of the style (Saison Dupont being a paragon of the Saison style). Good stuff and a worthy buy.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,JudoJeff,3.81,"I found the taste to have hints of bitter spices. The label says it is brewed with ginger, but it wasn't forward enough for me to notice. However, I do pile ginger on pretty heavily in the food I eat so it may be that it is just a much less intense taste than I'm used to. The coriander and grains of paradise seemed to play a larger role the the flavor. In general I don't enjoy hoppy beer, but this was quite nice overall.  When poured from a 750 mL bottle into a tall glass (maybe the wrong choice) this developed a very tall, foamy head that took a while to settle.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Mouthfeel - Very drinkable, another stomach warmer, another one that's hard to tell it is such high alcohol content, which is a good thing.  Overall - Amazing brew, seems like a Summer beer but it was hearty enough to also enjoy in the Winter. Another solid brew from Ommegang!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Jugs_McGhee,3.62,"I've taken a long time to get to this one, but I'm glad to finally get to it. I've educated myself on saisons recently with a lot of Fantome, so I'm confident I can give this the fair review it deserves. 7.70% ABV confirmed. 12 fl oz brown glass bottle with standard pressure cap acquired at a local bottle shop and served into a New Belgium stem-goblet in me gaff in low altitude Los Feliz, Los Angeles, California. Reviewed live. Expectations are through the roof given its reputation.  Served straight from the fridge and allowed to warm over the course of consumption. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated.  Not paired with food.  A: Pours a two finger white colour head - disappointingly thin - of slight cream, and great retention for the high ABV (~4 minutes). Body colour is a hazy pale yellow-gold. Thin minimal lacing. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show. Nontransparent. Translucent.  Sm: Crystal malt, brett yeast funkiness, heavy lemon esters and lemon zest, lemongrass, rustic spicing (perhaps cilantro and clove if I had to guess), and pale malts. Maybe a bit of light white pepper. The lemon citric zest is pure and fragrant, evoking a fine dry champagne. Pear effervescence. Honey. Pale grains. A moderate strength evocative aroma. I can't wait to try it. Yeasty and inviting. No alcohol is detectable.  T: Delightful lemon citrus esters and lemon zest; these notes are dominant. Complementary funky yeast as well with notes of clove spice and maybe even a bit of banana and phenol. Some light biscuity character. Crystal malt. Dry pear and champagne notes. A hint of sour green apple - but not to the extent you'd see in a patersbier. Pale unobtrusive malt body. Rustic spices seem primarily yeast-derived. Refreshing and a bit tangy. Some honey. Perhaps some light fermented pineapple. These bright fruit esters also seem to come from the yeast. Little malty sweetness - just enough to aid the balance. I quite like it. What's sorely lacking is white pepper; a quality saison should always have peppery qualities but this one lacks them. Still, it's a balanced and well-layered saison. No alcohol comes through either, and it manages to remain refreshing. It doesn't lack complexity, but saisons are a complex style, and more could certainly be done. Maybe my Fantome consumption has driven up my expectations.  Mf: Smooth and wet, with some effervescent dry champagne qualities as well. Excellent carbonation and thickness, complementing the flavour profile and coaxing out the more subtle flavours. Good palate presence. Refreshing and enjoyable.  Dr: Drinkable and enjoyable. Hides its high ABV well. A quality saison from Ommegang, but it drinks a bit too much like a witbier with its heavy reliance on lemon notes. Still, I quite enjoy it and I'd definitely get it again if I was in the mood for a domestic saison. It's a fine offering and a fairly priced one. Lives up to its reputation. Very refreshing.

42,141,damndirtyape,4.5,"12oz bottle, bottled on 07/03/12. Can't exactly read the best by date, some of it is unreadable. Served in a tulip glass. Despite a careful pour, some sediment came along.  Appearance: Cloudy golden yellow with a dense white head. Persistent sheets and strands of lacing. Held up to the light you can see the sediment suspended in the beer, along with bubbles coming up nicely through the beer. I suspect this would be an amazing looking beer had I been able to keep the sediment in.  Smell: Yeast, orange peel, herbal leafy hops. Quite nice.  Taste: Delightfully tart orange peel up front, followed by grains, coriander, hops, and a crisp but satisfying malty finish. Complex, but oh so very good.  Mouthfeel: Effervescent is indeed a good way to describe this. The carbonation is not fizzy, but does a nice job of gently scrubbing the palate clean, and yet leaving some of that orange peel and hop flavor behind without it sticking to the teeth.  Overall / Drinkability: Dangerously drinkable - I wish I had another one to try right now. Went very well with Tuna casserole and overall is a great beer. Fantastic in all categories. I will have to get it again to see how it is when I pour even more carefully next time leaving the sediment behind.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Ommegang style label thats quite classy in appearance. Neat story and photo of brewery on the side of label. Poured into an stemmed Tulip style glass.  A - straw look to the color. A cloudy yellowish gold with good efferescence. Fluffy white head that's truly Belgian in Look. Head resides after a few moments leaving a decent ring of lace.  S - Crisp aroma that has some good fruitiness to it. Unique Belgian like yeast whiff with notes of spices.  T - starts with hints of orange fruitiness that quickly makes way to banana and clove spices. Peach, oranges, big banana, clove spices, delicate pepper spice. Just a good fruitiness to it with the spices doing a nice job of being noticed. The yeast strain is pure class in this flavor. A semi bitterness in a refreshing finish. Good complexity while keeping its balance in check.  M - this has a good crisp, clean mouthfeel that's overly enjoyable. I find this very easy to drink and a good farmhouse ale to enjoy any time of year.  O - I love the saison/farmhouse style and ive had many from its home country of Belgium. For a long time now American brewers havent truly understood this style of ale. Ommegang don't pretend to brew in a Belgian style but they actually do brew solely in a Belgian style. They give American craft junkies a true Belgian saison brewed and bottled right here in the United States and Hennepin holds true to the authentic farmhouse style. If you want the best American made saison then this is the one. American brewing has needed a farmhouse ale to give the great Belgians a run for their money and Ommegang's Hennepin is that saison we can call our own knowing it can compete.

42,141,KKB,4.42,"A – Pale gold body that is almost champagne-esque, gorgeous translucent white fluffy head, carbonation that flows rapidly from the bottom, overall a very good looking saison.  S – Apples, pears, yeast, a spicy element, perhaps a slight pepper, little bit of grass, lemon and wheat as well. Very fine smelling, and complex to be certain but very clean. I am thinking this girl is going to taste very nice.  T – Top notch. Very good. It comes on initially with the apples, white grapes, pears and then progresses into the spicy elements of light clove, some pepper, and a very nice yeast as well. I’m not really getting the hops right now but this could be owing to the fact that this bottle is about a year old. I waited a while to drink it because it was recommended to me that I wait 6-12 months and it seems that this has suited the beer very well. The taste definitely warrants some comparisons to Duvel, but I would say that it is unique and has a broader complex of flavors. This farmhouse saison is clean, fruity, spicy and well-balanced. A fine brew.  M – The mouthfeel is really just great. It’s luscious and smooth because of the amped-up carbonation. The body is medium and it has a very dry finish.  O – What a great beer. I actually totally was not expecting to enjoy this as much as I did. I love the Saison style to begin with (who am I kidding I love just about every style), and I love Ommegang Brewery so perhaps I was being naïve in thinking I wouldn’t enjoy this, but I really really like it. Maybe the best Saison I’ve had to date.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

S: Citrus, orange specifically, possibly mandarin. Accompanying the citrus are the delicate notes of a particularly randy sow making friends with species of all types in the barnyard. Truly exquisite.  T: Taste follows the nose. Something like what a secretly welcomed sexual assault of an orange on a clove would taste like.  MF: The MF is consistent with orange/clove sex assault and delivers as anticipated. Glorious day!  O: Quite good. By the end of the bomber my curiosity was satiated. It will be a year or more before I have to, well I don't want to unsettle those bits of yeast right now. So quaff able.

The smell is a solid wheat scent in the beginning. Hints of cloves, bananas and spices follow closely. It has a very hearty smell.  The taste is fantastic! Really nice balance between the wheat barley, brown sugar malt, bananas, cloves and spices. Balance is a difficult thing to properly achieve, especially with a beer this complex.  Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp and leaves all of the flavors against the tongue after every drink. It is carbonated but finished smooth and dry, giving you the hint that you should drink more!

No “funk” really which is what I expected from a saison. A flavorful (delicious) pale ale is the best description of this brew. The alcohol is completely un-noticeable.

The aroma has the typical Belgian Yeast characteristics; orange peel, lemon zest, coriander, bubblegum and yeasty, bready malt.  The flavor is very similar. Up front there is a ton of orange peel and coriander with slightly sweet citrus fruits, slight wet hay/grassy notes, white pepper spiciness, and yeasty notes. Very, very refreshing.

I finally got my hands on a couple 25 oz. bottles.... It was well worth the wait.  As I pour part of the 25.4 oz. bottle into a pint glass, a massive head of fizziness appears atop a beautiful and hazy yellowish/gold brew.... Though those little fizzy bubbles diminish quickly throughout the drink, they leave plenty of lacing behind.... There's also easily noticeable sediment rising throughout the drink.  I take a whiff, and I immediately get spice like that of cloves.... There's also fruity notes of banana, and delicious notes of bready Belgian yeast.  All the mouth-watering scents of the beer really come out while sipping it.... You feel everything on the palate the whole way through.... At first sip, I think it's definitely spicy.... There's also a lemon citrus taste, as well as fruits like that of apple or pear.... There's a perfect balance of overall flavor with just the right amount of a hoppy taste to it.  The mouthfeel is is the home run to complete the cycle.... Very full-bodied with moderate carbonation that releases all the flavors of the nose and taste, leaving a lingering aftertaste.... There's also a tingly feeling left on the tongue throughout and well after the drink.  Overall, the only thing that needs to be said is ""I LOVE THIS BEER !!"".... Amazing from first sight in the glass.... It's complex and deep scents to the delicious and complimentary taste and mouthfeel....

42,141,95stategrad,4.7,"As far as I'm concerned, this is the Gold Standard for Saison/Farmhouse in the USA as far as mass producers are concerned. Some micro out West might have a better one, but as far as a Big Time producers, this is it. Everything is right on. Smell, appearance, and of course taste. It has the classic Belgian esters you get with the Farmhouse yeast strains. Everyone is out to make an ""Americanized"" Farmhouse/Saison by going big with the gravity or the hops or more unfortunately, both. True Saisons are not overly hoppy and are modest alcohol % with just enough hops to keep them from going bad too quickly. This one is a bit on the high side alcohol-wise to really be a real traditional Saison, but it is otherwise on the money. Saisons were brewed to refresh the seasonal field workers in Wallonia, and the brews were generally 3-5% so the workers could have one and still finish the job. 7.7% is a bit too high to be a true traditional Saison.

Slightly hoppy to start; mostly sweet, maybe green apple, with some mild hoppiness in the middle; and a crisp clean sweet finish. Really good taste. Refreshing just like I think a good saison should be. Complex taste.  Mouthfeel is good. Maybe a little more carbonation than I like but still good. Mouthfeel adds to the refreshing taste.

42,141,GMB,4.3,"Hennepin deserves its nearly perfect score at BeerAdvocate.com. It pours a beautiful hazy golden body that supports a nice, fizzy foam. I have seen more inviting heads on Saisons, but this one is lovely all the same.  The nose is very nice. Its sweet and fruity character is at the fore, but it closely followed by mild spices.  The taste is complex, but not as complex as some Saisons. Lemony tartness, pineapple, and coriander seeds dominate at first, but are immediately balanced by the malt's lightly roasted and honey-like characteristics. This beer's aftertaste is outstanding; spices (notably coriander seed and pepper) and roasted grain linger on the palate. Mild esters highlight the bouquet of spices and tart citrus by adding a warm base and floral characteristics. All this is nicely complemented by the beer's mild carbonation and full-bodied mouthfeel.  What makes this beer stand out is the distinctness of each of its myriad flavors. To achieve complexity without confusion is the mark of fine craftsmanship.

42,141,colforbin73,4.3,"ommegang is a treasure of a brewery -- one that american's should actually be proud of -- a brewery that makes flawless beer true to the traditional styles of belgium. while other american brewers have crafted unique beers in a truly american style -- ommegang brews beer that can stand up to any in the world on the merits of craftsmanship and adherence to the specifications of traditional style. for me, HENNEPIN is at the apex of american brewing. i associate this beer with baseball and more generally late summer and fall.  the pour is very delicate -- you need to pour slowly and carefully, the brew has a champagne level of effervescence and gives off a big foamy cloudy white head that sticks to the glass all the way down. the aroma betrays the spices used, coriander, orange peel, and ginger. but unlike a spicey winter warmer, the spices provide just a background hum. the yeast is pronounced in the aroma...  the taste is crisp, clean, a little sweet, maybe from the corn used along with the pilsner and pale malt. coats the throat and warms the belly after a few sips.... this is fantastic saison and would be perfectly at home at a wide ranging harvest festival, with a crisp salad of apples, walnuts and goat cheese, a roast pig, a spicey butternut squash soup and a pear and raisin torte for dessert.  what a beer!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

I can detect plentiful streaming bubbles in the beer. The head retreats slowly. There are aromas of biscuit from the malts as well as those typical spiced and fruity Belgian ale aromas like coriander, lemon, and pear. The beer definitely is spicier in the taste that in the nose. The coriander is more intense and it's somewhat peppery. Those fruity flavors are more intense, being pear forward. The hops on the back end provide some bitterness for balance.

Appearance (4.0): This pours a tight, two finger head of bone white foam that dies relatively slowly, and leaves some sporadic lacing on the way down—a few suds, a few legs, a few fat splotches of lace scattered around the glass. The body is hazy and honey-colored, kind of a soft shade of orange. Aside from not having a lot of head or lace, this is a nice looking saison.  Smell (4.0): Coriander and light clove come out first—very nice mix of spice character for the style, not heavy-handed like a lot others. The malt has a strong biscuity character, very pale, rustic, and bready. There’s a fruity, musty character at the back, dominated by pear and wet hay. There’s a very floral, somewhat grassy scent that can get lost in that estery finish, but it’s there and very nice.  Taste (4.5): Starts out much spicier than the nose, with more coriander and a good dose of white pepper and just a bit of clove, too. The fruitiness is more pronounced here, with a sweet, juicy pear and apple character. It finishes with a relatively mild hop component, just a bit of grassy bitterness and a moderate hop spiciness. There’s a surprisingly nice mineral character in the finish, too.  Mouthfeel (4.5): It’s got a body that’s just about exactly medium weight, with a nice, all-over tingliness that moves into a lush, foaming carbonation, and it finishes very dry.  Overall (4.25): This is a really solid saison—always has been. Considering how light and dry it is for something of this strength, you can get a very good sense of the yeast character in this beer, which I like. It’d be nice to have some more head retention, but it looks good enough and has a nice nose, with a very good flavor and feel. It’s not transcendent at any point, but as classically styled saisons go, it’s well rounded and well done.

42,141,jondeelee,3.92,"Hennepin opens with a slightly musty nose bursting with lemon, orange, and banana fruit esters resting atop a thick bed of wheat bread, floury baguette, biscuit, and toast crust. The musty aroma that overlays everything reminds me of the interior of grain silos or hay barns, being clean and natural. This blends with just a touch of sour, where grapefruit rind and lemon peel notes mix with a hint of fermented apple cider. As a whole, the nose is balanced and nuanced, several notes coming together to blend well and nicely represent the Saison style. The nose is just a touch lighter than it could be, lending the beer a slightly watery first impression, marking one of the nose’s few weaknesses.  On the tongue, the beer opens with a huge banana and clove blast, the latter ingredient somewhat surprising because it wasn’t overly present in the nose, and these are almost immediately joined by the grapefruit and lemon rind/fermented apple cider sour note. The sourness is very light, providing a mere shade of countering effect to the beer. Lovely full-grain and baking bread notes, including wheat and rye, form a nice base, adding both yeasty baking goodness and peppery notes. Further fruit notes include berry, apricot, and orange, the beer being nicely sugary. Towards the end of the mouthful, as the sugars die off, the banana/clove and sour notes increase slightly, as do the breads. The aftertaste is largely a continuation of the main mouthful, though with fewer sugars, and lingers on the tongue for a long time. Mouthfeel is medium-light to medium, and carbonation is medium to medium-heavy, causing a burning sensation on the tongue and soft palate.  As a whole, this is a very nice Saison, bearing all of the common flavors in decent quantity and nuance. The beer does seem slightly more watery than the 7.7% ABV would imply, but at the same time, the relatively high ABV is very nicely hidden, creating a strange contrast. Furthermore, the banana/clove and sour notes slightly overly dominate, especially if several sips are taken in quick succession. Still, this is a very nice beer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

It's like a blend of a wit and Saison in my opinion. You get some of that banana, some coriander from the yeast similar to a wit. But the nose has some traditional Saison notes. The carbonation almost makes it creamy and silky.  M: Light leading to medium.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,TheRealBigC,4.13,"Pours a dark golden color, chunky white head with excellent retention. Grainy smell, a touch of sweetness as well. Nice delicate spices with a touch of honey. A mild fruity tart profile and dry finish. This is the most popular Saison on BA, and for good reason. It's got a great taste and warmth from the alcohol but remains remarkably drinkable. A Belgian noob will find this accessible without sacrificing flavor.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,CraftBeerTastic,3.45,"Ba Review #196 Served On: 07/23/2012 Glassware: Pilsner Glass Labeled ABV: - Date/ Code: -  Had this at Finbars (Rehoboth) while visiting Coastal Delaware on summer vacation.  Look: Poured a clear yellow. Head was a thin coating of white foam. Some lacing formed on the glass - nothing to write home about though. Carbonation bubbles were minimal.  Smell: A typical Saison aroma. Peppery coriander, clove, some faint banana and wet grass. Nothing real special was in the nose.  Taste: Again, very typical to the style. The coriander and funky Belgian yeast hit first with hints of sweet banana making up the middle. The finish was a long lasting mango or kiwi that faded into a clean aftertaste.  This was a textbook Saison in my opinion. I've had others that were very similar, but the level of quality is probably what sets this beer apart from the others.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,CureTheRadio,1.49,"I almost wonder if I had an infected bottle because this is one of the worst beers I've ever encountered. It is worth mentioning that saisons are hands down one of my favorite styles. It was poured out of a 12 oz bottle purchased from a roughly 55 degree cellar room at a local wine store. No dates on bottle. It was poured into a SA perfect pint. [don't judge me!]  A- Not impeccable. Odd for the style but not out of the question. After all saisons are neat because of the variety. Dark and quite clear for the style. Almost a burnt orange kind of color.  S- Malt overpowered most everything else. After tasting I found the smell to be unworthy of analysis. Vanilla and earth were most prevalent next to the malt.  T- Tastes like chewing a dry pack of Brett. B. and a handful of Maris Otter. With no water. In the desert. Again malt is overpowering, and the end leaves one with a sticky flavor somewhere between dirt and the smell of a dairy farm. Esters are very detectable but abrasive and unpleasant. In all fairness, despite the flaws it is somewhat balanced. I found it to be strangely acidic. There did not appear to be any residual sugars. I love funky beers but good god damn... This must have been a bad batch. Bad beers shouldn't make it to the shelf.  M- Thick and velvety for a beer of it's color/gravity/strength but mixing with the taste it just feels gross. It is sticky and slick, lingering on the back of the tongue for some time.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Taste, not as citrusy, a little more clove and sweeter biscuit or cornbread. Strong yeast and herbal hop notes. Pretty good balance of sweet, bitter, refreshment. Somewhat of a wheaty type flavor, though not the clingy body.  Nice carbonation tickles the tongue. A lighter body, just barely warmth from the alcohol. Pretty darn good.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,psuKinger,4.03,"25.4 ounce bomber, corked and caged, poured into my new Ommegang Tulip.  A: Huge bone-white head, well over 2 fingers worth. Perhaps the most visible carbonation I've ever seen. Hazy golden straw color. Reminds me of ""beer champagne"" in the glass.  S: Yeast, clove, and banana all come through in the nose.  T: Light bready notes with a sour lemon zest on the back end. Perhaps a hint of clove and garlic. A touch of pine bitterness on the back end to help balance things out.  M: Light and lively doesn't do this justice. A yeasty wheat beer that is still light and refreshing enough to truly be enjoyable even on the hottest of summer days.  D/O: Enjoyable from start to finish, and I get why so many suggest that this is a great summer beer. Sometime soon I hope to give it a go on a hot summer day. Until then, this was enjoyable, but it's still not something that I *crave* when the weather isn't hot.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Nice lacing  Smell: Lemon zest, Belgian yeast, biscuit, slight funk.  Taste: Wow. Belgian yeast, biscuit, citrus, pineapple, hay funk are so harmoniously combined in this beer. Biscuit and lemon linger on the palate.  Mouthfeel: Slight carbonation, but really just crisp and dry. So refreshing.  Overall: I think this might be my never-fail, go to beer. I really am never let down, it is both fulfilling and drinkable, and it combines what comes best in so many different styles that it truly is a no brainer if you want a Saison. Do not be deceived by the shelf availability of this beer: it will beat many of the best.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Sirwootalot,4.69,"Poured into a tall pilsner glass. The beer has a thick, chunky, and very foamy head - some bubbles are large enough to be iridescent, and the whole thing has the look of ocean spray frozen in time. The nose is redolent of lemon candy, wheat fields, and a tiny hint of exceptionally tidy barn. Upon tasting this beer, I involuntarily exclaimed something school-inappropriate - It's utterly sublime! Juicy fresh-squeezed lemonade accompanied by hints of carrot cake, white peppercorns, and maybe even a tiny tinge of nose-searing Russian mustard. As the taste develops, the strong alcohol notes and the copious phenols kick in, with a taste very much like banana bread or fried plantains. It's like a beer equivalent of a gruner veltliner, in all of the best ways imaginable. Despite the high alcohol, it goes down almost more like juice or 7-up - it is just fiendishly drinkable. It leaves a sticky, starchy and very dry feeling in your mouth after a while, which of course just makes you want more.  Overall, this is one of the best things that has ever entered my mouth, beer or otherwise - and hands-down the best Saison I've tried (though Surly cynic comes close). I originally wasn't planning on reviewing this beer, but it was so ridiculously good that I felt utterly compelled to share the experience.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,WeedKing4,4.08,"Picked this up in Buffalo. Pours a bright, hazy, golden yellow with lots of white head.

I've recently really become a big lover of Belgians and this one is wonderful in that it's not quite as strong, but has a delicious, full Belgian taste and smell.

S: Up front floral and grass notes with sweet hits of lemon peel and coriander. Also some yeasty sweet bread and light malts.  T: Less sweet that the scent with yeasty bread and grassy earthiness. Taste of mild malts and a crisp clean dry finish.  M: Clean, crisp and dry with a upfront sting of carbonation. Maybe a little heavy carbonation, but that's my personal preference.  O: This dry brew is easy to drink, easy to enjoy and easy to pour another. The mix of malts and hops with a dry finish makes this a refreshing treat, uncomplicated and straight froward.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

42,141,b11,3,"This was once one of my favorites, for a number of years. Now it is made in Belgium (as of June 2012) and it is a significantly different beer, not the same at all. I taste the following: hoppier and less sweet (the subtle sweetness of this beer was one of my pleasures), far less yeast taste (again, I loved this) and more filtered for sure, and less malt taste. It's as if the brewers said ""let's make Hennepin taste more like Heineken"". Very disappointing. I will not be buying this again (until they make it in NY).  If you doubt me please check this out yourself, the new label says ""Product of Belgium"" right on the front.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

A bit of foul diaper-rash smell as well.  Taste - Traditional Belgian properties. Loved the beer from the bottle; the tap is the same. Fresh banana and peppery clove. Citrusy orange and fresh, faint hops.  Mouthfeel and Drinkability - A nice, light beer for summer. Easily drinkable and refreshing.

42,141,tlazaroff,3.73,"Distinct buttery nose, but not diacetyl. It has a nice herb-like quality as if you were wandering through an herb garden. Somewhat barnyard-ish too. Very nice!  Pours out a dark hay straw color with a crisp white, fluffy head Lacing is spotty, but sufficient. Lots of visible carbonation supporting the head.  The flavor profile I can best use to describe this is dried wheat grass. It has a distinct earthy quality which is backed by herbal goodness. A little bit of black pepper on the finish rounds this beer out nicely.  Highly carbonated, moderate body, and a dry finish. Overall, I really like Hennepin. It's a quality saison and one that I will seek out again.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

It was pretty dense appearing and had a good solid, rocky head with good lacing left on the glass. The nose is a wonderful, sharp spicy hop smell, with some yeasty/doughy background. There is a touch of fruit there too. The taste is great with lots of floral, spicy hops and fruit esters. I don’t get the banana some other folks talk about, more of sweet fruit. The palate is lots of carbonation which sort of takes over the rest of the body with a very crisp, dry finish. Overall, a very excellent beer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

S: At first I get belgian yeast, an orange and banana base with hints of coriander. Certainly some pale malts and some hops in the background.  T: Has a nice light fruit taste, banana with orange and spice. Solid hop backing gives it a nice finish. Very balanced ale that has wonderful belgian qualities. Alcohol is well hidden.

Significant lacing is observed.  S: There are moderate aromas of floral hops, light amounts of citrus and spices, and just a hint of the yeast.  T: There is an earthy and floral quality to the taste of this beer most likely contributed by the hops. There is a good balance with the underlying malts. Also, there is a hint of citrus and moderate amounts of spices. This beer has very light bitterness but is not sweet, the bitterness lingers just a bit in the finish.

The head retains in the glass as a think blanket until the last drop. Lacing from the ale leaves some rings around the glass.  The aroma is light, crisp, and full of citrus hints. Lemon peal, white grape, and yeast.  The crisp tart citrus flavors hint the palate first. Lemon peal, even a hint orange peal pull through the almost white grape sweetness from the alcohol. On the other side, I get a soft yeast roll flavor from the malt. The hop and spice are light. Hints of coriander and a mild bitterness from the hop.

Hennepin pours into a Duvel tulip with an ample head of creamy white foam that leaves concentric rings of lace in the glass. There's an ever-present skim on the surface, at least a few cm thick. Bright and saturated color, pure bubbly sunshine.  Signature Belgian yeast at first, lightly citrusy and musty, with herbal notes of tea leaves, coriander, and sage.  Grassy tea-like hops present in the flavor as well, alongside peppery Belgian yeast phenols and dry crackery malt. Finishes very dry with a lightly bitter edge. Seemingly simple on the surface but well nuanced in flavor and aroma. It has a prickly feel, well carbed, and easily degassed after swirling the glass a few times. Quite a thirst-quencher, and it pairs exceptionally well with charcuterie.  ""Hennepin. It goes with everything!"" ...Sorry, old BA forum joke.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

A - A big fluffy white head puffs up off the pour sitting upon a hazy, medium golden brew with trails of effervescent bubbles streaming towards the top feeding fluffy snow-white head. Excellent head retention with sticky lacing abound. Looks incredible.  S - Spicy, fruity, and yeasty; everything I would expect here. Lots of coriander and floral esters adding spice, as well as a bright fruitiness, giving me crisp green apples, fresh peaches, white grapes, and a touch of apricot. Finishes with honey sweetness, hay, and mouth-watering yeast.  T - Opens with light malt that quickly turns to spicy coriander and grassy hop notes lasting into the finish. Fruit comes in the finish as well, giving some white grape dryness and tart green apple with just a touch of sweetness to balance. Floral esters come in at the finish as well, providing a subtle bite. The yeast comes in here too, meshing with the fruity, estery, and spicy characters seamlessly, giving the profile a drinkable and approachable feel all around. Subtle honey sweetness helps balance the stronger flavors here as well.  M - Light body, but not at all watery. Carbonation is apparent, but very fine and smooth. The finish adds a touch of spice and gentle bite, from the floral qualities. Finishes with notable dryness, but nothing too strong.  D - Only my second saison after Unibroue's Blonde De Chambly, and this is worlds apart in many aspects, but still distinctly satisfying in the same way.

Again, hay and grassiness intermingles with a bready, lightly sweet maltiness, some black pepper and other spices, yeast, very mildly funky and tangy. Hints of green apple skin, citrus, and the remnants of floral hops. There’s a lot going on but it’s all fairly subdued and well-balanced. Quite dry. Booze is totally hidden.

The nose was mostly herbal and flowery with a few mild citrus notes, primarily lemon. Not as much fruitiness as I expect from this style. It reminds me more of a pilsner.  Mouthfeel is crisp and firm and the high carbonation does not overwhelm the flavors. There is a soft, bready, malty flavor up front with a slight hint of diacetyl. Hop profile is extremely mild. Instead, the beer has a slight tart fruity acidity at mid-palate that develop into a dry, yet slightly sweet finish. Extremely drinkable and refreshing.

Citrus, coriander, hay, a little banana, and possibly even horse blanket.  The taste is refreshing, and leans towards the dry side. This is good, as I'm not a huge fan of overly sweet saisons. Earthy yeast, a mild banana and clove is met by black pepper on the dry finish. Citrus hops lightly float above the other flavors. The mouthfeel is nothing spectacular.

42,141,BarryMFBurton,4.11,"Hennepin: never thought I’d be drinking this as a Saturday night brew, but I’m feeling a little Belgian tonight. Cheers!  Brewed over two years before the date of this tasting (Bottled on 16/12/10, best by 16/12/13).  A: Gorgeous, shining body on this one; pours a rich goldenrod. Looks bubbly, producing two inches of thick, white foam and a cavalcade of bubbles from the nucleation site; and man, this head is not receding at all. Beautiful. The lacing is soapy and thick, too. Perfect look.  S: Smooth, Belgian aromas of vanilla, straw, cornbread – a pretty aromatic buttery-sweetness. Light, fresh lemon, too, which mixes with some chamomile and lilac notes to form a tea-with-lemon effect. Otherwise, there’s a bit of barnyard funk, pine needles, and even a charming hint of melon.  T: So herbal and complex – absolutely delicious. Loads of white pepper, pine, orange peel, coriander, and flowery hints wrap the first tastes into a shell of perfume airiness, bright and tongue-tickling. Exotic wheat notes take it down a heavier, though similar road, with a Belgian crusty-breadiness (yes, that’s a word) and some light butter tones. Astringency comes in the forms of phenolic, lemon-rind hops, showcasing light – but lasting – intensity. Finishes with some fruitcake and cinnamon tastes, with some flaky biscuit tones.  M: Very light – bubbles off the tongue, at first, but it evaporates in moments with a noticeable weightlessness. A little oily, but it fits just perfectly with the style. What a drinkable beer.  O: This beer makes me smile – every sip is just delicious. Complex, memorable, and intense at just the right moments. Every time I walked into the liquor store, this beer was right there; little did I know that Hennepin was just waiting to dispel the rarity-means-quality myth. Grip ‘n sip, my Belgian-beer fans; grip ‘n sip.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,VelvetExtract,3.73,"A-Pours lively yellow. A bunch of bubbles lead to a nice fizzed head. Medium sized head with moderate lacing. Very bubbly and mostly transparent.  S-Pretty light on any barnyard characteristics. More of the Belgian bananas, lemons, and other pale fleshed fruits. Light little grassy hop presence but overall a bit underwhelming I would say. Good, not great.  T-A little more musky. Grassy hops, spice a light sweetness (not fruit). The pale fruit flavors are there throughout as well. A pretty pleasant taste but far from my favorite from such a cool style.  M-Very carbonated and the ABV is masked very nicely. A very sessionable feel. Rather light but the body is fulfilling enough.  O/D-Not my favorite, but I can understand why this is such a well liked brew. Solid in every aspect but I would not put it among the best of its style.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

S - The nose is excellent. Lost's of clove and black pepper spice. Belgium yeast, banana and faint wheat characters thought the middle. Sweet white grape as well. Hints of alcohol. Complex.  T - Yeasty, spicy, grainy, fruity, it just like it smells. It taste so damn natural.  M - Smooth and refreshing with a champagne like finish. Pretty damn good.  O - Pretty much outstanding.

Yeast and some sweeter citrus in the nose. Lemongrass, pineapple, and a little bit of fun and booze.  Citrus, fruit, and funk are up front in the flavor. The flavor then turns hoppy and spicy. It then has a nice clean finish of clove and yeast.  Medium bodied and very carbonated. Not overly dry and a crisp, clean finish.  Another great beer from Ommegang. Highly drinkable and refreshing.

42,141,phishsihq,4.45,"Welcome this is a farmhouse...ale  Ommegang Hennepin is a Farmhouse Ale, that could also be classified as a Saison. The brew pours a pale gold with a HUGE white head that required several pours, before settling to leave a thick lace. Banana and clove dominate the nose at first, but settle into other aromas including some grainiess, citrus, and slight funkiness. Complex flavors erupt on the pallet! Citrus and floral notes intermingle with hints of wheat, spice, clove, lemon and funk, to name a few. This beer finishes clean and dry, with a medium body and high level of carbonation. As with all the other Brewery Ommegang beers we have had the opportunity to review, Hennepin is an amazing example of Belgian-style brewing in America. World-Class!

Bright golden body that would probably be totally transparent if it weren’t for the rush of bubbles. The big white head just kept growing after I poured.  Banana, citrus, grass, and pepper in the nose. Not much phunk.  Citrus and grass are very prominent in the taste. Pepper and clove type spice character. Little banana and a general fruitiness. Slightly tart.  Lots of bubbles. Light body. Super dry.  I dig super bubbly bottle conditioned Belgians but holy crap I have never seen so many bubbles in a beer.

42,141,dumptruck81,4.76,"Appearance- Very pale color mostly transparent color. Not much head retention. I'm inclined to think that a beer needs head retention to have the strong aroma that I like but this one defies that rule of thumb. Great aroma and taste from this one that almost looks like your typical garbage BMC.  Smell- At first it I got your typical banana, grass, and funk. As I got a bit further into it I noticed the it wasn'treally banana but some other fruits.  Taste- For the most part follows the nose. Opens up into a nice range of fruits. Lemon, apple, and pear. Nice hop crispness, hay, coriander spice, and funk. Really complex beer for a lighter style.  Mouthfeel- medium light bodied. Enough body to enjoy the range of flavor and just enough hop sharpness to keep it crisp.  Overall- Well done ommegang! This is a must try beer. This will be one of the beers where you have to ask yourself why you hadn't had it before. I wish I could give it a perfect score but I just can't bring myself to do it. The knock on appearance is due to previous standards on what usually makes a good beer. The sharp mouthfeel is most likely necessary to open up the depth in this beer but keeps it from being the beer you can drink all day.  Edit: I've had this beer again many times with a good amount of head. I think there was soapy residue in the glass when I did the review",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

S- Smells like a hefeweizen. Lots of banana and clove with some pepper.  T- Similar to a Duvel, but not quite as complex. The taste follows the nose, with plenty of the Belgian yeast coming through. I was fascinated by the finish I got, which added a new dimension to the range of flavors already present  M- Very carbonated at first, which took away from it, but was much better as it warmed. Dry and crisp.  O- I'm not too familiar with the Saison style. Having only had Saison de Silly, I was expecting something a little more funkier and out of normal range, but I suppose the Silly is an exception.

Mellow and on point.  Taste: Lemon zest and hay. Grass and a mild funkiness. Faintly musty with a decent lingering floral note. Raw honey and a mild peppery finish. Floral and earthy. Powdery bread crust. Very clean. Lingering notes of lemon.  Mouthfeel: Dry with a lively carbonation. Body is light and bubbly. Drinks clean and easy.  Overall: The first time I had this beer was on tap. It came to the table and smelled like a citronella candle. I've been putting off retrying it for 4 years as a result. Ultimately, I'm sad I waited.

Pouring along the side of the glass will not even help one bit - pour slowly. Very nice honey-toned spicy floral aroma. Though there's some raw honey sweetness as well, the taste overall is nice and dry, lemony, and herbal, all very well integrated in the mouth. Smooth stuff.

T - Fruity notes with the cloves coming through, floral citrus hops, unique spiciness that is tough to nail down, but is incredibly tasty and complements the musty caramel malts.  M - Lighter bodied ale that comes across a tad prickly is heavily carbonated, but finishes nice and wet.

Retention is very good, especially given the ABV, and the head leaves sticky lacing as it recedes. Quite appealing.  S - Honey, crystal malt, bready yeast, floral hops, tart fruit, a bit of sourness, pepper and other light spice that I can't identify, and a bit of ethanol. Inviting, and subtly complex.  T - It's got a much more tart/sour flavor than the nose predicted, though I like it. The tartness does well to balance the sweet malt and candied sugar. The hops are incredibly subtle, but make an appearance toward the climax. I think it suffers from its subtlety, though, and I wish the flavors were more bold. No alcohol comes through at all.  M - Light bodied, well carbonated, and dry on the finish. Nearly perfect for the beer.  D - A tasty brew for sure. I'd like it to be a little more bold, but it's got good flavors and is very easy drinking. I'd have it again.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Smell is yeast and malt. A light apple fruitiness and some spice are detectable as it opens up. There is some light funk as well.  Taste is dry maltiness. Very mellow. A fruity bitterness is in the aftertaste. I am missing the tart though, according to the listed style.  Texture is incredibly light and smooth. A highly carbonated beer makes this light bodied beer even lighter. Very drinkable.  My first venture into the farmhouse/saison, and I really enjoyed this.

42,141,grannaniwa,2.8,"12 oz bottle. Smells kind of like a hefeweisen to me. I think I smell lemon, but I can’t tell whether this is just because so many beers get served with a lemon slice in the US. Nose is a little richer second time around, a little earthier and more cloves.  Taste is a little flatter than I expected. Not that bright, falls more on the bitter side. Carbonation is out-of-control. Makes it hard to swirl around and get the full experience! One of the flavors in the aftertaste reminds me of a flat domestic lager. Little bit of tang on the tongue after a swallow. Tastes like it is high alcohol, and it turns out to be significantly high!

M: Light to medium light body with mid level carbonation. Crisp drinking and easy flowing. More bitter than sweet.  O: Top tier beer from a top tier brewery. The secondary notes in this beer is what did it for me. Its a proverbial dance of flavors mixed with a solid yeast profile. Its as if Ommegang has been doing this for hundreds of years.

42,141,BeerMaverick,4.22,"Appearance - Darker golden brew with a slight opacity and an inch of frothy white head leaving plenty of lace on the chalice.  Aroma - Not as funky as many Belgian saisons out there. This beer has a very clean floral smell with hints of spice that you might encounter in a hefeweizen along with some butter in the background.  Taste - The floral character noted in the aroma isn't as prevalent in the taste and more of the farmhouse floor funk that saisons are known for has entered the realm. The Belgian yeast and spiciness are much more dominant here and miniscule amounts of lemon and orange-peel fill in any gaps.  Mouthfeel - As is the case with most Belgian beers, the yeast is carried into the aftertaste along with the spices in this medium-bodied ale. Some of the previously mentioned butter has survived to this stage as well.  Overall - Not the greatest saison in the world, but definitely one of my favorites (as is the case with all Ommegang beers). This beer was fantastic, but it was a little too clean for a saison. Probably one of the best American-made saisons though.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

42,141,Darkmagus82,3.92,Served in a chalice.  Appearance- Served with nice orange color and a bit of haze. A nice billowy white head is present upon serving that fades slowly over time leaving a bit of lacing.  Smell – Citrus with some more green apple aldehyde and some phenol like aromas typical of wild yeast brews. Some bready aromas mix in with the more wild yeast aromas giving a rather nice “wild” aroma.  Taste – A sour citrus is heavy up front and is mixed in with some breadiness from the wheat maltiness. The yeast cake flavor develops more toward the middle of the flavor alongside the green apple aldehyde and some phenol flavor. Bitter and sweet fruit flavors rounds out the taste profile; with the bitter flavors winning out over sweet and leaving the tongue with a rather lemony grapefruity flavor.  Mouthfeel – A rather heavy level of carbonation suites the brew quite well. This coupled with a moderate body makes it quite easy to drink.  Overall – A very nice beer. Sour and bitter with just the right fruit sweetness. Well done for a Brett fermented beer.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

42,141,TheBrewo,3.93,"We pop the top and pour a pale golden-amber colored brew. It holds a full two finger pillowy head of off-white bubbles. This has great retention, leaving spotty but thick lacing around the glass. The carbonation appears crazy active, and you can hear the popping like Rice Krispies. There are bits of big yeasty sediment, and a thorough haze throughout. The aroma is bright with metallic yeast, paler malts, fresh hay, and a faint musky funk of mossy wood. There is a faint hop grassiness hiding behind more wheaty malts and clovey orange rind. It actually smells much like a traditional wit, with added lemony freshness and hops. As we sip, the flavor opens up with overripe apple sweetness and bright steely malts. The wheat also comes in, with wet twangs of more yeasty metallics sticking to it. The latter is very Belgian and strong with light banana esters. The middle peaks with sweetness, supported by vanilla and a toasted grain bill. The finish allows the hops to shine through in full force, cutting the malts and sugars, adding a new type of hop bitterness. Both the grain and the yeast are souring to the very end. The aftertaste breathes of clove, chemical phenols, musk, and funky yeast. It is actually quite earthy, with echoes of light and peppery ethanol. The body is medium and the carbonation is almost too high. The feel is, at times, thin feeling, but remains crisp and cooling to the palate. There is great slurp, froth, and cream, with a final dirty, earthen astringency. The abv is higher end for the style, and the beer drinks easily.  Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the interplay between the crisp and cleaning, and the earthy and the muddy. The flavors are all clean, but blend nicely towards the finish for a more robust and full flavoring collectively. Paradoxically, the flavors do muddle towards this end, but in a nice, balanced way. One negative is that the carbonation is painfully too much. This is a great representation of the style overall.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,elNopalero,3.7,"This pours a light golden-straw color with a bold layer of foam. There’s a distinct yeasty aroma, slightly musty—the funky saison smell, I’d imagine. Tastes light with some bitterness, followed by a dulled zestiness. In reflection this isn’t as exciting as I remembered it. As an example of a saison I think it’s pedestrian, in light of the number and variety of saisons I’ve started drinking on a semi-frequent basis.  As a caveat, however, I will note that the first glass from the bottle wasn’t exciting but when I came to the bottom of the bottle and refilled my glass, now with the dregs and yeast at the bottom of the bottle that my pour definitely had a more vibrant character to it.

Aroma : bready and yeasty with strong phenols from the belgian yeast strain ( probably of duval origin ) clove, tart and lactic barnyard funk common of the style as well as mild hops.  Taste : peppery phenols are dominant and taste follows the nose except for the brett sourness that comes through very apparently as well as more of a hop bite than the nose would present. there is a sweetness in the background that is also common of the style but not as prevelent as with other examples.  Mouthfeel : carbonation plays with the overall light body of this beer making it a more medium body beer. the carbonation lingers with a carbonic bite i personally enjoy.

Full of funky yeast, clove and coconut. Some white wine characteristics with lemon edges, lemon pepper. Biscuit background with honey and tart, citrus edges. Some medicinal tones. Very yeasty, funky, and complex.  Like a fine, fizzy white wine. Smooth edges.  Wonderful beer. Complex and interesting. Very enjoyable.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

S- smells of green apple and pear, honey and light belgian yeast, banana, clove, tiny detection of tartness.  T- Tastes very much like a belgian golden ale, it has much of the same flavors as the standard bearer in that category- Duvel. Green apple, honey, phenolic esthers, belgian yeast, and a faint tart finish. Very clean. Very crisp.  O- A very well done saison that touches the right flavor points, but just isn't my absolute favorite in terms of the style. I would prefer just a bit of a brighter flavor, often found in the more citrusy saisons I have encountered (Jack D'Or is what comes to mind for example).",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

42,141,tonyf55,4.03,"From the bottle into a footed pockal glass  Visual (4.5): Yellow-golden colour with a slight haze. Pure white, 2 finger +, pillowy head with large rolling bubbles from an active carbonation. Bubbles are active, and visible through the body of the brew. Belgian lacing decorates the glass during the drinking.  Aroma (4): Spicy, malty with a citrusy hop smell. Typically Belgian with comparisons able to be made to Duvel (even though they arn't the same style...) The fruity esters, and hop cirtus lay underneath a distinctive spice profile, from the Belgian yeast produced phenols.  Taste (4): Presiding light flavours overall, with cirtus fruit and grassy malt initially and then a fruit-spice coating late in the flavour. The malt and spice flavours shine the strongest with the fruity esters and citrus hop giving an initial taste.  Mouthfeel (4): Rough and carbonated after the initial pour. Actively dances across the tounge. Mellows as it warms into a smoother taste with mild carbonation.  Overall (4): Light flavours that are exceptionally true to the style and pay homeage to their Belgian roots. A rolling thick head with a spice flavour that lingers in both the aroma and the taste, distinctive of a Belgian yeast production. An extremely drinkable beer that is very likely at the top of its style.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

A hazy golden straw yello with good signs of carbonation coming up through the center of the glass.  Smell: Belgian candy sweetness, apples, pears, bready and sweet malts, yeasty esters, vanilla, spiciness, and music to my smelling senses.  Taste: All the aromas for the most part can be tasted in the si  Mouthfeel: medium to high carbonation, smooth, somewhat dry, light bodied, and easy to drink.

My bottle said it was brewed in Belgium at Duvel.  A: Clear, golden colored ale, with a good amount of bubbles in the glass. The white head is a huge rocky mass of 4+ fingers that shows excellent retention and super lacing. A very attractive pour.  S: Fresh and spicy, the aromas are clean and have the typical Belgian yeast notes. Fruit smells as well, as in apples and grapes. I also get some peppery notes. Overall the aromas make a wonderful combination.  T: Taste is complex; wine-like in the dryness and fruit flavors, with the peppery and spicy features carrying over from the nose. Features a nice bite from the hops but I wouldn't call it bitter. Fruity, but not overly sweet. The flavors transform nicely as the beer warms.  M: Crisp mouthfeel from high carbonation on a medium body. The finish is semi-dry with a light tartness.

Hazy, golden wheat color. Lovely.  S: Banana, clove, and orange peel dominate a subtle, balanced nose. Very bright.  T: tastes like the brightness of the nose suggests, but in a much bolder way: lots of lemon and orange (both fruit and peel), maybe a little bit of banana, and some clove and coriander to round it out. The sweet and tart aspects of this saison are out there far more than in, say, Saison Dupont (which is the gold standard, in my opinion), which sets this nicely apart. There's something like champagne grapes in here, too...  M: effervescent and cleansing throughout, very smooth.  I love this beer. Great with spicy food, and highly drinkable.

The taste is more or less the borderline for what I'd expect from a Saison. It's balanced very well with fruit, yeast, and tart, but it doesn't really leave a lasting impression.  The body is medium light with a medium/high thickness. The finish is moderately dry and sticky.  Overall, this was a solid saison, and for it's availability and pricepoint it really shines.

42,141,NuclearDolphin,3.98,"Poured into a 16oz Pint Glass  Appearance - Much like the Ommegang BPA, this pours a very large head at around a 4 finger width with a rather foamy look to it. The ale itself is a fairly hazy wet yellow straw color with some orange tint around the center.  Smell - Yeasts with a slight sour smell. There's some decent cloves in here along with some lemon and some malts. I can faintly make out some slight hops in here as well  Taste - Cloves and spices are fairly strong, along with the yeasty taste that was in the smell. Amazingly the sour notes here are not from the yeast, but rather the slight lemon flavor and it somehow sits perfectly. There's some malts in here that seem to add a bit more depth.  Mouthfeel - While I feel it adds some more to the flavor, the carbonation is a bit more on the intense side. Body overall is average and the same thing goes with the overall thickness.  Overall - Saisons are always interesting to try out from different brewers and fortunately Ommegang has delivered a solid Saison Ale. It's flavor is nice and complex and while the mouthfeel leaves something else to be desired, it's still an excellent beer",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

42,141,Agent1,4.46,"Brewed in New York and in Belgium (thanks to Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat), this brewery is not like many others. And surprisingly, it was started in the US of A, but focuses on only crafting Belgian-style ales. Using authentic Belgian ingredients and variation recipes, this Saison has somehow managed to gain notoriety within only fourteen or fifteen years. This is not my first time to enjoy this beer, and certainly not my last...  Appearance - Bright yellow/ gold. Almost champagne in color. An active beer that pours okay from the bottle (head seems rather thin and bubbly at first) and then once it sits, really seems to come to life. An amazing head on this beer. Lots of carbonation, too, so the retention is strong as a result. Thick foamy cream. Very appealing!  Smell - Quite spicy on the nose. Immediately, wheat and pale hops stand out. Lots of coriander and lemon, giving it aspects of sourdough. The dry, pale hops really stand out here.  Taste - Bitter orange peel, honey, lemon and other citrusy fruits, plants/ flowers (earthy notes), and yeast. Zesty. Crisp and balanced. The bitter pilsner hops really compliment the sweeter honey/ fruit ingredients. The alcohol is definitely detectable but never overpowering.  Mouthfeel - Smooth and crisp. Almost zaps the tongue. A clean finish that leaves a sugary coating inside the mouth.  Overall - Considering this is a beer brewed out of pure passion versus hundreds of years worth of experience, it is damn impressive. Rich in color and taste, this is a beer to be revered (it's no wonder Duvel Moortgat bought this out). This is beautifully layered and yet represents the style almost perfectly. A great Farmhouse Sasion.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Poured from 355ml bottle i ended up with a foamy head due probably to my over vigourous pouring technique. Once it settled the beer is pale and cloudy in appearance due to the yeast sediment.

I poured this at 46 degrees into the Ommegang glass which produced a 2 finger light and fluffy head the color of raw cotton. A brilliant pale gold with straw colored edges with a light haze. Brisk carbonation from the bottom of the glass.  Great complex smell of Belgium yeast, lemon zest, grains, creamy. Really nice nose on this.  Best saison I've had. Grains, straw, and carbonation attack your palate first, following quickly by herbaceous notes and lemon zest and other citrus through the lingering finish. Maybe a hint of grapefruit flashing toward the end. Despite all the citrus notes, it is not in any way tart.  Goes down very smoothly.

A good-tasting beer, easily quaffable - might be one of the few beers I preferred while it was a little colder - it had a brisk character that compelled me to take real hearty swigs as opposed to, say, thoughtful sips.

S: Smells yeasty with a hint of either citrus or pine maybe both.  T: There's so much to taste here. I can taste a muted hops combined with that yeasty taste.

42,141,datalager,4.48,"Mmmmm...Hennepin. A beautiful beer from Ommegang.  Pour is a murky saffron yellow, swimming with all kinds of small sediment. The off-white head has the characteristics of peaked stiff egg white, and rises two fingers...easily. You could do four if you were too aggressive. Lacing is absolutely sick! This is one of my favorite looking beers by far, as there is just so much to look at. Simply beautiful.  Aroma is a fusion of pine, fruit, must, and a little wood...maybe cedar???  Flavors here are awesome, with tons of dynamic play. Hops up front display a familiar ""IPA"" type evergreen note. But this quickly fades into an unripened plum flavor, which greets you with sweetness, but ends rather sour. Aftertaste is quite earthy, but like others have said here, it is actually pleasant.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, without any distracting bite. Nicely balanced.  An absolute favorite for me, and the default pale on my shelf.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,frankiepop,4.78,"Are you tired of spending your inheritance for those wonderful Belgian brews. I say they are well worth it, but .... My dealer sells a big 750 ml bottle of Hennepin for only about $8. That's a bargain.  The cork pops off and tons of smoke rolls up and hovers on top of the big bottle. When you pour, a big white head emerges with plenty of lacing. Hennipen wonderful Belgian style beer with a classic Belgian look of hazy and cloudy golden brews.  Taste so good I forgot to get whiff. So I pour some more and discover a wondrous beer smell. I will just sum it up as quite interesting and complex. Beautiful sturdy head built up in my Ommegang Chalice. A golden murky look. I loove that.  Taste is damn good. This is less hoppy with a sweet after-taste and still a little tangy sour, but Hennepin is nice and subtle. There is some subtle sweetness with sour fruitiness. Hennipen is balanced. Malty yeasty flavors.  And it's so drinkable. This beer slides real nice over my tongue and gives me so many nice tastes and a great texture that is a tiny bubbly Belgium fizz that I love so much. The carbonation reminds me of New Belgium's Fat Tire. But the flavor has much more ...uumph! This beer compares closer to the Tremens.  This beer arises to one of my top five favorite paler golden brews. It may be in the top 2 or 3. Damn fine beer and powerful. Kicks your white butt too. Pretty strong brew.  So what should you listen to while drinking this brew? I would recommend folk singer Greg Brown. His new cd Freak Flag would be a hip choice. I might also recommend his recording The Iowa Waltz.  You may want to save this beer for UEFA Champions League soccer matches. Love ya dogs. Go Tottenham! And good luck to the Belgium team in Brazil.

Looks a lot like a witbier, maybe a touch darker.  First smell was a bit offputting, and with that I mean it almost smelled musty, or even like some cheap beer that I wish to forget. Subsequent smells reveal more. Yeast and citrus? Bubblegum? I'm not the best with recognizing smells in beer aroma. I was almost offended at first, and worried I wasn't going to like this, but then...  Great flavor in this, much better than the initial smell. Fruitiness, citrus, bubblegum, it's a sweet beer up front. Wow. This is the first beer of this style I've ever had, and if this is what I can expect from the style, I'm certainly a fan. It's similar to a witbier, without the spice notes. Somewhat dry on the finish, but not bitter, not hoppy. Just a great, highly drinkable beer. I'll be buying this again, no doubt.  Mouthfeel is similar to a witbier. I keep going back to that, but it's my best point of reference. Pretty much perfect drinkability. I would say this could easily be a session beer.

A bit of a thick Hefei with a Saison. Big aromatics of yeast, dampness, lemon and banana.  Taste- A good malty spicy saison. A large amount of pepper on the first sip and then more of the hefe banana and yeast flavors on the following sips.  Mouth- A medium body and a medium carbonation level. A bit of a mixed wet/dry feel and a bit more peppery spice note.  Drink- This was pretty good and flavorful. More of a sipping saison with big bold flavors and a good balance and feel.

The retention is fantastic, and the head itself looks like whipped meringue. Lacing clings to the glass. Ommegang really makes some pretty beers, and this is no exception.  The aroma is quite sweet. There's a very strong honey note in the mix. Some citrus twang, mostly lemon rind, but the whole package ultimately ends up smelling like something approximating Lemon Drops due to the sweetness. It's not necessarily bad, just one-dimensional. A hint of bready malt rounds things out.  The taste is very sweet, bordering on cloying. There's a flavor akin to confectioner's sugar at work here. Some bready, biscuit malt in the mix, and a touch of lingering bitterness. No real funk to speak of.  Ommegang nailed the mouthfeel. This is an incredibly full, rich saison, but the carbonation is on the medium side. The end result is that this is a very easy beer to drink, and flavors really come alive.  I've enjoyed many bottles of Hennepin in the past, but this is the first time that I've detected overwhelming sweetness in this beer. Pleasant enough, but far from the best the style has to offer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,mariposafan,4.48,"Poured from a 12oz bottle to a Duvel tulip.  Bright, cheery yellow with an inch and a half of creamy head. The head fades back slowly to soapy lacing.  The aroma is yeasty and citrusy with a spicy undertone. Could be a little more forward, though.  The flavor is yeasty and citrusy and spicy, with some lingering bitterness. Some tartness as well and not much sweetness to balance it. The only downside is that the only portion of the flavor that lasts at all is the bitterness, otherwise the flavor fades too quickly.  The viscosity is right in the medium range making it easy drinking when it's warm but thick enough for a winter day. The carbonation, though, is a bit extreme - it feels more like a soda than a beer.  Overall it's a great beer. A little less lingering bitterness and more lingering flavor would make even better, though. Still, for a saison that's relatively easy to find in single serving bottles it's hard to beat.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,MsRif,4.23,"I've had this bottled and on-tap several times. Pours a translucent gold color with a nice white head. Retention and lacing are both excellent. Has an aroma of yeast, funk, citrus, sweetness...complex and well-balanced. Tastes sweet with a bit of tartness to it...yeasty, earthy, bready...citrus is still there. Does not stay on the palate long.  Light bodied with generally great carbonation. This beer is excellent and very drinkable. A refreshing beer that goes down smooth.

42,141,UTCengOwl,4.38,"Hennepin was my first saison. I used to get this all the time and I'm quick to recommend it as a good intro beer for newer beer drinkers. Having had a few more saisons, I can see where Hennepin falls a bit short of those, but it still cleanly delivers its flavors. Served from a corked and caged into a snifter.  The beer has a bone white head that has nicely dense foam pockets. The body is a hazy oranged gold. One of the reasons that I loved this beer in the past was that it was one of the first truly beautiful beers I had poured for myself.  The beer itself is somewhat muted on the funk or farmhouse angles. The flavor is definitely present, but not quite where I want it to be. However, the dryness and complementary noble hop presence are right in line with where I love them. I've only recently come to appreciate Noble hop flavors, but I've always enjoyed the hopping on this beer. It just seems to fit.  This is a solid and clean beer. Do I wish it had a bit more funk? Sure. However, the hopping and dry mouthfeel are so in line with where I want them to be that I don't mind the lack of huge farmhouse character.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Cornucopia of flavors follow; light fruit, white pepper, earth, Belgian yeast, sweet crackery malt. While it starts sweet and tart, the beer finishes dry.  M: Light body.

Very fluffy white and great retention. This one stays at 1 finger.  S: Definite mustiness and medicinal notes. I really enjoy the zestiness and sweetness of this beer.

42,141,bramsdell,4.26,"Poured from bottle into imp pint glass. This is nowhere near my first Hennepin, but first time having it in awhile and first time reviewing it.  A: Where to begin? Let's go bottom up. A brilliant yellow/gold that nearly radiates out of the glass at the bottom. Moving up, the beer retains the golden color, but becomes cloudier. The carbonation racing to the top is very clear. The head is perfect. It's huge and fuffy at first, exactly what the best summer clouds look like. The head recedes to a 1/2 cm white that remains for the duration of the drink.  S: Dry and fruity. The dryness of the smell would have been a turn-off if this was my first encounter with this beer as it truly is the predominant aroma. With a big of agitation, the alcohol also reveals itself. There is a nice fruity compliment to these aromas, but they arrive at the end.  T: Worry not, children, this is not a dry white wine. This beer is bursting with flavor, but in now way overpowering in any way. The fruitiness is the first flavor to come through, a pleasant sweetness. To balance this, the beer becomes drier, but nowhere near the dryness that that the aroma indicates. As the brew warms, the dryness comes forth more, but again, this is not the predominate flavor. There is zero booze flavor  M: Light, crisp, bubbly and dry. This is an extremely pleasant beer on the tongue. The beginning is very much light and crisp, the perfect beer to enjoy a summer day or warm evening with. The residual feel is a sweetness and dryness.  O: A great beer. Lots of flavor, but a beer that can does not scream for attention.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

It starts off soft, tasting of oats and lightly of wheat; underneath it all is a tart current that keeps it all in line; finish is more tartness mixed with some punchy, citrus hops. Wonderful!

42,141,BDTyre,4.82,"Yummy! Cloudy gold orange with a big white head. Sugary, fruit scent. Sweet malts, citrus-y hops. Light spiciness that eases off as the beer warms, but it never goes away. Light wine and raisins.  Mildly dry taste. Bitter, hoppy and quite refreshing when cold but as it warms. Spiciness constant through, apple, bananas, citrus, raisins, brown sugar, bread and barley. Underlying sweetness, but an initial dryness in the taste. Very complex, and the characteristic barnyard flavour is there but quite mild.  Carbonation is quite noticeable at first, but dies down fairly soon. A very nice saison, and one of the better ones I've had.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Taste is sweet initially with the pale crackery malt, followed by the peppery spice and ending with a bit of fruity esters of apple, pear and melon. Some lemon too. Part of the taste is just plain sugary, though it finishes moderately dry.  Mouthfeel is creamy with alcohol warming. Carbonation is foamy, not prickly. The feel leaves a bit of sticky sugar on the lips despite the moderately dry finish.  This is a very good saison. Not as dry as many others.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,climax,4.5,"There was no issue obtaining a gigantic head from this one. The eggshell white mass sat atop a cloudy straw yellow. The retention was equally as admirable, and faded leaving thick globs of foam.  There is quite a pronounced earthy/skunky tone to the aroma, but I like it. The delicate Belgian yeast flavor was accompanied by a sturdy lemon tartness. Coriander, clove, banana, and a dash of diacetyl deliver the winning runs. The peppery spiciness just barely tickles the nose and the alcohol wears a clever disguise.  The flavor has the same hint of buttery diacetyls that the aroma only hinted at. It teeters on the sweet side, but still has a mild sourness. Amongst all the soft flavors, only once it warms do I notice the alcohol creep into the flavor.. The finish comes in earthy and moderately dry, with only a hint of bitterness.  The feel is silky and very sharp and the light but robust body just coats the mouth with loveliness. The slightly dry finish keeps me sipping at an alarming rate. Ommegang definitely has a stronghold on the Saison market with this classy and well crafted brew.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Hard to distinguish particular fruits for me, but banana sticks out. Lots more as well- a pretty complex flavour. The Belgian yeast is prominent. For all the fruit, it is not overly sweet. Very nice.  Fairly high carbonation, but works well given the style. Medium bodied, pretty smooth once the carbonation dies down a bit. Feels good.  Overall? A great saison.

The aroma is yeasty yet clean, also exhibiting notes of dry earth, white pepper, dry citrus rind, as well as some sharp citrus.  Flavour is very clean for the style. Crisp dry grainy wheat up front, mild dry citrus character in the middle accompanied with dry mild spice, and finishing with a spike of kumquat sweetness before drying out once more for an earthy, spicy aftertaste.  Medium-bodied mouthfeel, creamy smooth texture that adds an extra fullness to the overall character, moderate pin-prickly carbonation.

42,141,zeledonia,3.23,"Bottled on 31 March 2011. Tasted 23 September 2011, reviewed from notes.  Pours a really nice golden yellow. Mostly clear, with a light haze. Big fluffy white head that sticks around for a long time. Some spotty lace, not much. It's one of those beers that you pour and it just goes ""poof!"" Bright color, glowing, topped by a huge gob of white foam.  Smell is dominated by Belgian yeast. A little bit of faint musty barnyard funk. Lots of spice, especially clove, with a little banana, and some slightly sharper spice. I like it. To me, it smells more like a Belgian golden than a saison. But it's good.  Taste starts out slightly sweet, musty, malty, with that light earthy flavor characteristic of saisons. All those layers, just like it should be. But then a huge dose of hops spoils it all, bringing a tingly bite that doesn't feel right to me for this style. Finishes pretty bitter - not what I was looking for. My feeling is that they were trying to make a hopped-up saison, and it didn't really work out. It detracts from the beer by overshadowing all that subtle complexity with pure bitterness.  Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, high carbonation. Fizzy and tingly. Quite good, but I would appreciate it more if it weren't reviving flavors I don't want.  Over-hopped, especially for a saison. I don't pick up the hop character in the smell, but it's quite obvious in the taste, and its effects are largely negative.

42,141,biboergosum,4.05,"750ml caged and corked behemoth of a bomber. Strangely, the label indicates that this is a 'Product of Belgium' - brewed and bottled at Ommegang's parent company, Duvel Moortgat.  This beer pours a somewhat hazy, pale golden yellow hue, with three ebullient fingers of puffy, thinly foamy, and frothy eggshell white head, which leaves some nice linked snowflake lace around the glass as it lazily sinks away.  It smells of musky flowers, citrus rind, bready pale malt, dried apples, sassy earthy yeast, and a soft ground pepper spiciness. The taste is moderately sweet pale malt, buoyed by some restrained candi sugar, weakened citrus, but with an uptick in general fleshy fruitiness, some new-found coriander, consistent yeast, and subtle, sneaky earthy spiciness - pepper meets ginger. There is no overt alcohol presence, however, a pleasant wave of underlying warmth pulls the covers up all nice and snug.  The carbonation is present, but lightly rendered, and, well 'brut-esque', the body on the prim side of medium weight, and smooth, but with a swelling of edgy heat baying at the gates. It finishes off-dry, with head-spinning complexity - nothing that has thus far presented itself seems to have buggered off yet. Oh well, then.  A well made, um, American saison? Heritage and corporate buyouts aside, this is just plain enjoyable, the delicate nature of the farmhouse ale decently ramped up, balanced, and quite agreeable, as the masked booze strength plays up well to the waning summer ethos up here in the soon to be Great White North.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

The smell is a little herbal from the hops, spicy from the yeast, and bready from the malt. The beer tasted good, but it was definitely undercarbonated which keeps the aromas in the beer and out of my nose, but it kind of also ruins full appreciation of the beer. This was carbonated more like an English Pale than a farmhouse ale. The beer wasn't as fiesty and zippy as the bottled versions of this beer, which are perfectly carb-ed. That said I think this beer develops in the bottle a bit and it might be the micro-oxidiation (along with carabonation) from the bottling process that adds some earthy and fruity flavors I remembered in this beer that was not present.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,draheim,4.32,"750mL bottle (bottled 8/6/10 - best by 8/2012) poured into a Hennepin glass. Clear golden color with an enormous fluffy white head that subsides slowly.  Aroma is Belgian yeast, spice notes, fruit. Light, crisp, and lemony with just the right level of musty funk.  Taste is clean and bright with a smooth mouthfeel. Yeast, malt and hops work in perfect harmony here. Confirmed once again as one of my favorite saisons.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Seanstoppable,3.92,"Pours a hazy goldish color with plenty of fluffly white head.  Beautiful yeasty smell. A bit of pepper.  Beer is not all that great when chilled. Offish flavors as if I was drinking something closer to a Labatt Blue. Letting it warm up a bit brings out more of a traditional saison like flavor. Plenty of yeast, a bit of spice, a slight honeyish sweetness.  Not as great as, say, most saisons actually from Belgium, but overall still quite good.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,fank2788,4.42,"Pale straw gold fairly clear with a careful pour however the head is crazy, even with a slow pour I get half a glass of foam, and it doesnt appear to be going anywhere. A lot going on in the nose with this one. It is dominated by yeasty esters like bananas and cloves but there are also lemon and peppery spice as well. The taste is classic saison. Fruit, spice and clean crisp grain. For the fruit I notice lemon and other citrus the spice is mainly light pepper and a bit of clove and that is all rounded out by nice pale malts. The mouthfeel too is good. Lively carbonation with a super dry and clean finish that manages to leave a touch of sweetness that invites the next sip. The alcohol is well hidden but does sneak up near the end of the glass. Overall a very good example of an often under respected style.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,AmericanGothic,4.33,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Unibroue tulip.  A: Pours a cloudy yellow color with two fingers of billowy, almost pure white head. Strong retention and lace, vigorous carbonation.  S: Sweet yeasty bread, light hay and pepper.  T: Very subtle flavors: yeasty bread, tart apple and pear, pepper and minerals. Definite hop bite on the finish but perfectly balanced with the other subtle flavors. Delicious.  M: Light, soda-like but with a bit of cream and fluff, refreshing astringence.  O: Can't believe I've never even tried this before, what a treat. Available year round and reasonably priced, this one is going straight onto my go-to list. Definitely recommended.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

42,141,snaotheus,3.06,"750ml bottle split into two really big snifters. I left the yeasty sediment in the bottom of the bottle.  So, it looks pretty clear, straw yellow, with a very robust head and lots of active lacing. Cork made a nice pop, too. Smell is spicy and somehow unpleasant. It makes me think of cheap lagers. Kinda yeasty.  Taste is a bit funky, kinda spicy. Very yeasty, even though I left the sediment behind. I can't taste much else, in fact.  Mouthfeel is a little dry and chalky. Overall, this seems OK to me. Maybe I didn't get the best bottle; it was on clearance.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,output01x,3.63,"Poured from a 750 mL. bottle (Bottled On 09/22/10 / Best By 09/2012) into a tulip glass.  A moderate pour yields a 3-finger off-white head that fades slowly but sticks around forever. The body is a cloudy straw gold with carbonation bubbles rising like an undersea volcanic vent. Thick lacing sticks to the sides of the glass in gloppy ribbons.  A good amount of funk is coming from the head, which is nice as I have had some rather complacent-smelling Hennepins before. Citrusy and oily lemon peel blends well with grainy wheat and, of course, the dominating funk.  A sweet grainy flavor holds a number of notes, including banana, lemon zest, and pepper. Where is the funk that is so explosive in the nose? The flavor is delicious, but not what a saison-lover would expect. It is much more approachable for the style, and as such, it is great for someone uninitiated to the saisons.  Light to medium bodied with decent carbonation, this beer has great drinkability. The carbonation is not overly apparent and does not cause the beer to fizzle when held in your mouth, but it is just strong enough to help push this beer along. The body is not coating and sticky nor light watery, but sippable and gulpable.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,JohnnyBarman,4.28,"Bomber picked up at Consumer Beverages in Buffalo. Been meaning to try this one for a long time, especially considering the dearth of saisons available in Ontario.  Enjoyed on the patio on perhaps the nicest summer day of the year - zero humidity, clear blue sky, and with a freshly mowed lawn to boot. Perfect saison weather.  Poured into a Leffe goblet. Pale golden, slight murk to it, and with a billowing head sustained with lively swirls of carbonation.  Nose is lemon, pepper, grass, spice, a bit of funk, and with a surprisingly sweet malt character to it.  Citrus, pepper, clove, earth, and oh so dry, Hennepin is a delightful brew on a summer's afternoon. The alcohol and funk comes in mildly towards the finish, and there's a mild medicine-y taste, but other than that it the brew is fresh, flavorful, dry and light - exactly what I was hoping for. Improves nicely with a bit of natural warmth.  Creamy, medium bodied, with assertive, lively carbonation. Very dry, almost needs an accompanying glass of water.  A great saison, sweeter than some, and without a strong musky-farmyard flavor, but still lively and bright, and with lovely citrus and peppery notes. A pleasure to drink.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,DingusKhan,4.32,"A - Dark, straw-colored yellow, with a thin white head and tiny bubbles continuing to float to the top as it sits.  S - A very bright, citrusy scent. It smells very good and has a definite fruity aroma. You can also very clearly smell cut wheat, it smells like what I think  T - Extremely refreshing with a slight bitter aftertaste on the sides of the tongue. This is a very clean, easy to drink brew.  M - It has a very clean feel to it, very easy to drink and smooth.  Overall: I very much enjoyed drinking this beer. It was very refreshing, and affordable; I would easily imagine myself getting this beer again.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,calebroberts811,3.72,"Another installment of my Saison journey.  A - Straw yellow, medium haze, a rather weak head with loose bubbles.  S - Somewhat restrained, a rather rustic graininess, some banana, wet grass, etc. Little funk.  T - Way sweeter than I expected. In fact, a little too sweet. There wasn't a great deal of funky sourness that I've gotten from other saisons and that was a bit disappointing. Light grassiness and banana notes.  M - Too little carbonation for a saison in my opinion, was a bit too cloying in its sweetness.  O - If I'm in the mood for a saison, there are four others that I would choose in front of this one. Just ok.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

D-Great session beer especially for the summer months.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,jayhawk73,4.47,"Pours a bright amber color w/ a thin off white head. Good carbonation and lacing on this brew. Excellent looking Saison. Smell is fantastic. Spice, grains, fruit, pepper. Really well balanced, and really excellent for the style. Taste is amazing for the style. Same profile as the nose. It amazes me that a beer this refreshing and balanced can pack a 7.5% ABV wallop. Mouthfeel is really smooth and balanced- not much more you could ask for here. Overall, this is probably the second best Saison I've had, and the best from the USA. It's priced really well, and I can't recommend this one enough if you're looking for a Saison.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Thickfreakness,4.65,"A- Pours a cloudy sunshine yellow into my DFH signature glass. A three finger bright white head seems to have 7 little layers of bright and darker foam when held to the light... really cool!!! It collapses upon itself like a volcano that gave out leaving sticky, foamy lacing all around the glass. Insane carbonation, but part of that is the glass itself.  S- Fresh cut pear, tart apples, caraway seed, star anise, coriander, Lemongrass, and some black pepper spiciness. Nice nose of torn wheat, hints of banana and Belgian yeast. This is so deep and delicious!  T- Nice yeastiness, pepper and lemon. I wouldn't describe this as funky, but the lively yeast, banana, lemongrass, and pepper really make your tongue stand at attention. Really light, flavorful and crisp. Spicy caraway rye bread tones mixed with a squeeze of lemon.  M- Bursting with spicy carbonation and tart citrus! Nice little bit of alcohol, sweet wheat, and a tinge of funk. I've had this many times, and still love it and am amazed by how well done it is.  O- It really doesn't get much better than this in it's style, or any other! I am in love with this beer, always have been. Light, refreshing, fruity, tart, bready, spicy...

42,141,obywan59,4.5,"I had to do a double-take when reading the back label. Brewed by Duvel Moortgat, imported by Ommegang--WHAT???? After doing a little digging, I found that Ommegang closed for a couple of weeks in January to undertake some improvements to their brewsery, and Duvel actually did take over brewing some of their beers. The neck label does say it is a ""true Belgian Saisson Ale"".  Pours a transparent golden-orange with a near white head of 3 1/2 fingers which gradually settles, becoming chunky and swiss cheese-like on the way down. Thick, sticky lacing is more prevalent as the beer warms. Carbonation bubbles rise like a tower of smoke from the center of my Duvel tulip (appropriately enough) as well as being scattered throughout.  Aroma of sweet honey, and toasted whole grain. Floral and peppery aromas as well.  On the dry side, but still, a bit of malty sweetness manages to punch through the tart lemony flavor. Earthy, but not funky.  Medium to medium-light bodied.Peppery carbonation stings the entire mouth. Hot burn of alcohol in the throat.  An excellent brew!! I had thought that perhaps this would be more suited for a cooler month, but this seems lighter and more summery than some Saissons.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

S: Apple, pear, lemon, and orange with notes of pepper and coriander. I get a little hay and grain accompanying perfumy floral notes.  T: The beer has a lower moderate earthy and herbal bitterness up front with lots of fruit. I detect pear, apple, and lemon, with a rustic yeast profile and a light peppery spiciness.

42,141,mactrail,4.35,"Mother's milk! Smooth as caramel, warm and slightly sweet. A creamy mouthfull with great rich flavors. Beautiful beer-- golden color and clear in the tall tulip glass. Individual flavors don't seem to stand out as much, but the overall effect is spicy with rich wheaty malt. Mellow is the word, just enough fruit and a hint of hops. Not the usual Ommegang over-the-top Belgian funk.  Best Saison I've tasted this year. Highly drinkable but with a rich set of flavors. Shows a good Saison doesn't need the excess of acidity and random bacteria so often encountered.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Morey,4.03,"Pours yellow-orange in color and has a slight haze to it. One and a half fingers worth of frothy white head is starting to settled to a thin lace on top of the beer. Plenty of carbonation bubbles throughout. Moderate retention.  Sweet and somewhat fruity (maybe lemon), with wafts of Belgian yeast in there as well.  Crisp and lemony up front followed up by a carbonated punch and a kiss of sweetness. The sweetness quickly fades into a subtle tartness setting up a smooth and refreshing finish.  Medium mouthfeel with a fairly aggressive carbonation.  An above average Saison to be sure.  Morey's Bottom Line: This is good...really good, but I don't know that it's quite as good as Lavery's Liopard Oir. Don't mean to be a homer, but that's just my opinion.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Lots and lots of tiny bubbles visible in the brew. Head stays thick throughout. Thick clumps of sticky lacing cling here and there.  S: Pale malt with lemon notes. Sweet honey appears as it begins to breathe.  T: Pale malt is the backbone here, with very faint hefe-like notes of banana and a spicy clove finish. Honey prominent throughout.  This is 7.7% ABV? You wouldn't know it. Very well balanced flavor.  M: Medium and a little sticky. Very heavy carbonation lends it a prickly mouthfeel and a slightly dry finish. A little warmth remains as the last layer of it lingers in the tongue.  O: Good, refreshing beer that might even be sessionable if it weren't for two things. 1: the alcy in this is higher than you'd think and 2: the carbonation makes you feel bloated.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

It's like a hefe with what you get in terms of the fruitiness, plus a rustic farmhouse note. Some light hops also provide a nice bitter flavor towards the end. Very crisp and refreshing  M: Light bodied with moderate carbonation  O: A great example of a refreshing, crisp saison that works amazingly as a summer beer.

42,141,BeardedRiker,4.03,"I think the last time I had an Ommegang was...I don't remember. For some reason I haven't tried many of their beers. I've had their Three Philosophers though. Since it is way too damn hot in Texas I thought getting a saison would be a good purchase.  This beer looks great. I poured it into a large stange glass. It looks yummy. A great, massive, bubbly-foamy, white head formed. In the glass it took forever for the head to fizz away and the head kept a nice retention for a long time. My glass had etching on the bottom so there were a lot of bubbles rising to the top. Without sediment in there the beer is clear and a golden-yellow color.  I get a lot of lemony citrus in the smell. The yeasts bring out some veggie and grassy smells. There's some sulfur in there too that sort of gives off a skunky smell. It's possible my beer could have become a bit skunked since it's the Texas summer. Anyway, light malts add a straw-like aroma. There's also a very strong toasty smell.  Hennepin has a sort of toasty, grassy yet sweet taste. Hops are minimal. Yeasts add that bit of sulfury funkiness. The more sediment that's added makes the beer taste more like a light hefeweizen than a saison. I like the flavors but I didn't find it too extraordinary.  Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium. It's creamy at the beginning but has a dry finish. Medium-high carbonation.  Interesting flavors. The toastiness adds some uniqueness but I wish it had just a tad more hoppiness to it to make it more distinguishable from a hefe, especially when sediment is added in.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

42,141,Cavery,4.23,"750ml shared with SundaySour, bottled 5-20-2010. An extra from GoGators (cheers!).  Poured into a Lost Abbey tulip.  A: light yellow pair skins mixed with pastuerized pulp-free lemon juice. The foam on this thing is very whip cream like, fine and fairly thin. 3 solid fingers of foam eventually rejoined the waterline. A few waterfall tracks of lacing, a rather strange formation. The retention was moderate, but a fingernail length foam remains on the glass. A good looking saison.  S: Slightly green lemons with some crispy green beans. Pear sweetness throughout. A really sweet vegetable smell that takes me to cooked peas, asparagus, and potatoes cooked in red wine. The wine notes really stick out in the end, and are quite sweet. The alcohol is very vinous with a mellowed quality I'd more readily associate with reds. All in all quite mellow, but with many notes.  T: Lemongrass, dandelions, and edamame. A little spike of flavors that I can only describe as poppy seed like, very soft but noticeable. A little bit of tahini in the late middle. Geen onions linger with alcohols to create a very salad like finish. Arugula has a strong presence for a peppery green character. A strong showing for salad greens in this one. Very easy to drink, extremely easy drinking. Love the fruity pear notes.  M: A real champagne yeast character that has a fairly slow drying process; and also never quite fully dries to champagne standards. I like the more wet character in the mouth as it doesn't leave gaps for the alcohol to take over, and more subtle plant characters remain in the flavor. This has quite a full body for the style, but I'll play it safe and say medium-full. I can't tell how much trickery is in that rapid-fire carbonation.  O: Really quite good, and very easy to drink. I appreciated all the flavors in here, but there isn't too much complexity in here. I'd say the flavors are even fairly homogenized, but it doesn't really matter. This a very clean representation of the style, and it most certainly should be had with food. Stir fry, steamed greens, and light salads would do awesome here. You wouldn't even need to put pepper on your salad -- it's already in your glass.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,SundaySour,3.65,"Shared with Cavery.  A: Hazy golden yellow with a fluffy white head. The color of gold; gold in them there hills!  S: Smells a glass of apple or pear cider, with a citrus ""leaf"" smell. If I were to whiff this unknowingly, I might suspect it could even be a champagne. It honestly smells pretty damned delicious.  T: It has a clean pale ale taste with a light orange juice finish. The scent deceived me, I thought it would be a little fruitier. Also attending the party is the delicious taste of bread, especially in the aftertaste. Light and yummy.  M: On a scale of 1 to Champagne, it's probably about a 6. The flavor lingers and lingers for a Saison.  O: I enjoyed this beer, but I wasn't falling out of my chair excited. It is crisp, and the sweet orange undertones were really nice. Admittedly, I could guzzle down a pint or two. But for a Saison, I feel like they could have pumped up the flavor a bit.  Sour out.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

I don't see how it could get better.  A wonderful aroma: citrus, namely lemon and some orange, barnyard, a touch of horse blanket/farmhouse, and a touch of white fruit, perhaps apple or pear. This beer's aroma grows and magnifies as it warms; it's tremendous.  A classic saison, if such a thing existed. The flavors consist of sweet fruit, barnyard/horse blanket, a touch of funky yeast character, and some mild bitterness. Though it sounds funky, this beer is accessible as they come and incredibly drinkable.  Light to medium mouthfeel. A pleasure to drink.  A really fantastic saison. This might be the classic, benchmark, standard for the style--and I wouldn't argue the point.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,stakem,4.17,"750ml C&C bottle I have been sitting on for awhile just for giggles. Circa 2006-07 vintage. The bottle has conflicting information regarding it's abv. At the bottom it states the abv is 7.5, at the top left corner it states 8.5%. Poured into a Ommegang 10 year anniversary cervoise it appears a clear straw yellow color with a golden center. A finger of white froth dissolves leaving finger-like patterns of lace on the glass. A light swirl revives the cap to a finger of fluff that is yellowish stained.  The smell of this brew is quite fruity with notes of pear and bready grains. Somewhat like caramel with hints of original bubblegum. There is some expected yeasty spice included not really peppery in nature more like clove. There is an evident amount of sulfur and some grassy notes mixed with belgian phenols. The backend is minorly reminiscent of banana.  The taste is sweet with caramel malt and a hint of original bubblegum flavoring. Slight herbal hop inclusion provides a nice balancing bitterness. There are some spiced yeasty notes of clove and faint banana. It is very clean and well balanced.  This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. It is quite creamy and smooth in the feel. Very easy drinking with a low alcohol impact despite the conflict of listed abv on the label. Regardless if it is 7.5 or 8.5% abv, it drinks like it is half of that. Exceptionally balanced, this brew has gone through quite a transformation I actually enjoy it more with age on it than a fresh offering. Nice.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Citrus dominates in the flavor, with some pilsner malt sweetness in the finish.  Mouthfeel is full, but the beer is exceptionally dry. After the swallow it just vanishes off the tounge and you're ready for the next sip. Perfect on a hot day like today. Very refreshing.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,nppeders,4.6,"I decided I needed to bust out my bottle of Hennepin from the cellar on a 100 degree summer day in Mpls. Good old mr. summer is getting me all hot and bothered for some Saison thirst quenching action so I decided to dip deep into my cellar and found this Hennepin that I've been hoarding for about 6 months.  Undid the wire cage on the bottle and the cork popped out with out me even touching it so I thought I had a bomb...but no...it poured crystal clear yellowish orange with a one finger rocky head. I made sure not to get the sediment in there but I wasn't too worried.  The smell is very strong and I can't put my finger on exactly what's going on. Definitely some citrus...maybe some apricot and some spices. Not sure if the spice aroma is all yeast or if they use actual spices as well but it is a beautiful bouquet. Maybe some bubblegum and clove in there somewhere.  Taste is a bit malty and really fruity like apricots or something like that, a little pear action as well. Really tasty and as you breath in it all just works so good together.  Mouthfeel is right on for a Saison which is on the thin side typically and dry in the finish. This yeast have clearly been coaxed by the brewer to eat as many sugars as possible! This one definitely finish's dry but also makes your mouth water bringing you in for another sip. Carbonation is on the high end which is perfect.  Overall- I can't think of a better example of the style. It's like reading the style guidelines for a Saison word for word. If I was stuck on an island and could only choose one beer for the rest of my life...it might be this one. The yeast flavors don't really hit Saison head on for me...and I think they might dry it out with the sugar rather then a traditional Saison yeast...but it just all works so damn good together.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,lurpy1,3.06,"Shared with the wife last night on a scorching hot day.  Pours golden yellow, retained a pretty good head. Someone please tell me this beer doesn't look like a urine specimen?  Smell is a bit off-putting, a little bit too yeasty for me. It's not terribly different from the smell of baseball stadium beer, and that's not a good thing.  The taste is somewhat floral, with hints of citrus and breakfast spices in there. Not bad, certainly easy to drink, but also somehow a little bit thin and watery. I know this is not supposed to be a big beer, but there could have been more here.  Quite fizzy in the mouth, but saison's are pretty fizzy. Mission accomplished on Ommegang's part, I guess.  Certainly, this is not bad, but I'm evidently not part of the adoring crowd this beer has. Frankly, I gotta be honest, compared to the ""best of the worst"" of the macro-brews, stuff like Leinie's, Rolling Rock, I cannot say that Hennepin is better than those beers by an order of magnitude.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

This pours a yeast hazy light yellow / straw color with a large white foamy head which ends up being about a finger in width and leaves a slight lacing. The smell is of belgium yeast esters, a little clove and citrus. The mouth feel is light to medium with lots of carbonation. The taste is complicated, its yeasty sweet at first, citrus, lemon, and then it ends with a nice slight hoppy, spicy, peppery, dry finish, very refreshing. This is actually my first Saison and I love it, this is much more of a good summer drink for my tastes than the SA / Brooklyn summer ales. Good stuff.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Hoptometrist,3.76,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass  A- Pours a beautiful hazy pale golden color with an incredible four finger rocky, pillowy head that leaves lots of chunky lacing. Perfect looking Belgian-style beer.  S- Apple, orange peel, spice, and biscuity aroma  T- Lemon, lots of spice, pepper honey, biscuit. Has quite an assertive bitterness for a saison and the alcohol shows up some. No funk in the taste at all.  M- Very crisp, goes down smooth with a little alcohol warming, pretty good carbonation  O- This saison was pretty good, although too much spice and pepper and no detectable funk made this beer a little bit of a disappointment for me. A well-crafted beer that I enjoyed, but not quite what I was expecting.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,TheWhiskerReview,3.95,"On-tap at the Flying Saucer. Nashville.  Pours a hazed straw-gold with a fluffy one-finger head. Moderate retention with slightly sticky lace (lasted about half the glass).  The nose is mostly a malty mix of crackers and honey-drizzled biscuits with more lemony and straw tones. There's the expected spice and barnyardy funk, but it's real restrained compared to some other Saisons I've had. Smell is real reminiscent of those honey-lemon cough drops, but totally in a good way.  The palate mirrors the nose pretty closely- a creamy rush of malt with vanilla overtones to the continued theme of honey, lemon and straw. The hoppiness is light and floral/noble with a very mild bitterness, while the finish is mouthwateringly dry. Again, restrained spice.  A very delicious brew. Not as interesting as I had hoped- by that I mean I wished perhaps for more spice and funk. But it does show consistency with my other Ommegang experiences- delicious and approachable Belgian-style brews with an unbeatable price-point being domestic and all.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Smell-Grainy and Grassy with some light citrus.  Taste-Better then the aroma. I got a nice amount of grapefruit and some lemon citrus. Finish is sweet and tangy.  Mouthfeel-Medium bodied, medium carbonation. Can pick up some light booze.  Overall-Good beer, not outstanding. A little too sweet on the finish to drink that much at once.

42,141,mikestan06,3.61,"My first saison, so take this with a grain of salt because I really don't have a lot of experience with the style.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into my tulip glass. A weak gold color with a ridiculously thick white head that lasted for days (even with a weak, gentle pour like the bottle suggested).  Smell was strong and earthy. Dirt and lemon peel? My roommate called it cat pee, but I don't want to be that guy, so...  Tasted pretty nice, however. Strong spice and faint lemon notes. Even at 7.7%, alcohol is nowhere to be found.  Mouthfeel is as crisp and clean. Not overly syrupy with a light carbonation bite that's gone immediately.  Is it my favorite style? No. Is it good? Hell yeah.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,csiewert,3.73,"This beer pours a slightly yeasty golden color with a finger of white bubbly head that doesn't retain terribly long or lace much.

Overall a great saison.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Knapp85,3.53,This beer pours out as a nice looking hazy golden yellow. The head billows and needs to be given a moment to settle. The smell of the beer has a decent amount of funk to it but it's not as much as some of the authentic farmhouse ales out there. The taste has a pretty good amount of malts and yeast with some spices in there too. The mouthfeel is drinkable and has plenty of carbonation to keep it alive on the tongue. Overall this beer is pretty good but not my cup of tea really.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,rundocrun,4.03,"Poured from a 12-oz. bottle into a snifter.  A - Pours a hazy straw yellow with multiple fingers of fluffy white head. The foam sticks around forever and leaves a thick layer of lacing on the side of the glass.  S - Smells of light malts and a heavy dose of spices (coriander, citrus peel). A mild bready-ness and a dollop of honey top things off.  T - Upon first taste, I notice a rich sweet malty backbone. The orange peel is very noticeable but pleasant. It lends a tangy, zesty character to this summer refresher. Floral hop flavor. Mild hop bitterness gives this a dry, but somehow quenching character to this beer.  M - Thin-to-medium mouthfeel with a mostly clean, dry finish but a slight residual syrupy sweetness lingers.

Unfiltered pale yellow with a fluffy two finger head and healthy lacing on a good pour.  S: Lemongrass and honeydew melon.  T: Subtle flavors of earthy Belgian yeast, sliced banana and fresh citric acid.  M: It's buttery, rich and creamy, yet light and easy drinking.  O: Ommegang's Hennepin is the quintessential American-made Saison. It's great summertime drinking, and is balanced enough to put back year-round. Worthy of most hype and worth seeking out.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,eat,4.3,"Great looking beer: a fluffy cover of bright-white head tops a cloudy pastel-banana yellow coloured body, lacing decently.  Lots of lemon and astringent yeast on the nose. White pepper, light nutmeg, delicate malt, floral, pears, earthy hops, a touch of alcohol. Smells pretty delicious.  The flavour follows with big notes of fresh lemon and astringent, slightly-funky yeast. Perfectly spiced with pepper and nutmeg being most obvious. Malt is light but provides just the right sweetness underneath everything else. You can tell there's more alcohol here than average but it's expertly mixed into the whole. A low-lying bitterness ties everything together with some great herbal hops.  Nice full-feeling light body and lively carbonation keep drinkability high.  This is most likely the best saison I've had to date. Smooth, flavourful and extremely refreshing; this stuff would be positively dangerous outside on a sunny day at 7.7% ABV. This bottle disappeared; too bad there was only one.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,FanofHefe,4.5,"Pours a light golden-colored body that is only a little hazy. Even with a careful pour, the glass fills with a huge, fluffy, white head that retains very well and leaves a little lacing.  Potent aroma. It's funky, for sure. An earthy aroma blended with some apple and pear, that finishes with some peppery spice.  In the flavor, the funkiness is greatly diminished, favoring a much heavier emphasis on the peppery spice. A light fruitiness is secondary with a light hop note in the background. Very tasty.  Light to medium mouthfeel that finishes very crisply. Very drinkable. Light enough to enjoy on a hot day, yet would be flavorful enough to combine with a meal.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Bmuncy,4.43,"Apearance: Cloudy and dim, this banana yellow brew formed a huge snow-white head even though I poured it very gently. Generous lacing forms as the head quickly dissipates, leaving a half-finger head that remains throughout.  Smell: Very spicy on the nose. Fruitiness permeates and makes it a very prominent smell of the brew. Also present is a strong yeast aroma.  Taste: It is a quite tasty beer. The citrus present in the nose shines here. It's somewhat spicy, earthy, yeasty, fruity. The relatively dry finish is very manageable and rounds the brew out quite well. The taste pleasantly lingers.  Mouthfeel: Light bodied and extremely well carbonated. It goes down easy.

The taste to me has a tart sour apple flavor followed by a peppery spice that adds to its complexity. I didn't expect this complexity when I first saw it poured. It finishes a little dry and has a nice and light mouthfeel. The alcohol is hidden well and I could drink more than one of these in a sitting. This is a perfect brew for this 95 degree day.

Poured from a 12oz bottle into my Ommegang glass that looks like the one pictured on the bottle, but doesn't have the Hennepin logo, and doesn't fit a whole 12oz bottle :-(  Appearance: Golden yellow, beautiful white head that takes its time to dissipate, leaving lots of lacing  Smell: Sweet malt, Belgian yeast, bananas, honey, pepper  Taste: Banana, lemon, fruit, earthiness, clove, and spices.  Mouthfeel: Medium body, high carbonation, dry finish  Overall: I thoroughly enjoy this beer, like everything Ommegang brews.  Note: I just found a 750ml bottle of Hennepin that was brewed by Ommegang's parent company Duvel in Belgium, and was going to re-review this. No need, these notes still capture it. Amazing that this can be brewed in two distinctly different locations with the same results.

42,141,SickGnar,3.82,"A: Quite pale straw, ever so slightly golden, with some haze and murk. Lots of rising bubbles join a big, large-bubbled, chucky head that leaves surprisingly weak lacing.  S: Slightly tart lemon, musty grain, background peppery and phenolic notes. Fruity hints with some earthy, slightly funky yeast. Some bubblegum & lychee. Grassy / herbal hops and crackery / biscuity malts in the background.  T: Quite yeast, even for a saison, but not unpleasant. Spicy and tart. Soft, tangy lemon – strong though. Peppery alcohol. Just an edge of sweetness on the dry cereal malts. Banana and cloves come out middle to end. Candied green apple? A slight minerally aspect sneaks in. Earthy, white pepper, yeasty notes grows in the aftertaste with each drink. Towards the end grassy and herbal hops push through. Wheat becomes more apparent as it warms. Noticeable alcohol. A tad much on the lemon.  M: Medium body with a bit over average CO2. Creamy and luscious, yet rustic. Sweeter and fuller than some, and this is a plainly (but not obviously) bigger version. Somewhat tart and ultimately drying. Slightly warming.  D: After a bit you do notice that this is a fairly strong version. Still, it is easy drinking enough. Just too strong to be a quaffer. Best had with food – the lemon tartness would cut flavors well and cleans the palate. Rustic and hearty.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

T: Similar to the aroma, spices and cloves followed by some light fruit sweetness up front. A hearty bread and yeast flavor with some spices follows with a lightly bitter finish.  M: Light body with medium-high carbonation, this beer is nicely attenuated so it's light and crisp. Quite nice.  O: Overall, a good American saison.

42,141,BeerPhan86,4.41,"Hennepin has always been a personal favorite of mine from Ommegang, and the saison style is perhaps my favorite overall Belgian style of beer. I have to credit Hennepin with introducing me to the saison style as well! Poured into a Duvel tulip.  A - Pours a hazy white gold with a huge three finger foamy white head. Very similar in appearance to an authentic Belgian white in that you can truly see a white or silver color to the beer when pouring out of the bottle.  S - Hints of subtle banana and candied sugar, as well as grassy hops and spices. Not terribly aromatic.  T - A strong wheat flavor up front followed by hints of grass, banana, and bubblegum. Reminiscent of a good hefeweizen initially but carries that distinctive Belgian yeast taste afterwards. Clean and dry finish with a bit of citrus, but the alcohol is very well hidden. I can't believe that this beer is almost 8%.  M - Crisp and dry with plenty of carbonation. Lighter than most other Belgian styles and very refreshing.  D - Extremely drinkable but potent as well. Perfect sipping beer for the warmer months.  Overall, this is a terrific and well balanced saison ale, and well worth trying. Perfect beer for someone looking for a kicked up, Belgian style wheat ale in the summer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,mocktm,4.55,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into Duvel Tulip.  Moderate pour yields a nice white, thick and frothy head that lingers around nicely leaving substantial amounts of lace behind in its tracks. Beer appears a beautiful yet semi hazy golden yellow with plenty of carbonation bubbles apparent. Almost reminds me of champagne.  Smells a bit musty from the yeast, but not in a overpowering negative way; the funk is right on. Nose lets off slight lemon citrus overtones with a peppery spiciness. Light fruits such as apple and banana and a tad bit of bread like nuttiness are there as well.  This beer is everything I hoped it would be. Yeast is very much in the forefront along with some citrusy yet tart hop presence, immediately giving way to buttery biscuit like notes. Spices come through strong in the middle to add some spicy clove like flavors to the mix. The nearly 8% ABV is completely camouflaged and I'd have no idea it was as strong if it wasn't printed on the bottle. Finishes off fruity sweet.  Medium bodied and very well carbonated. Seriously refreshing with a semi-dry finish. Real drinkable and ideal for complementing a nice summer night.  One of the best Saisons I've ever had, and that's saying a lot considering its brewed in NY. The fact that this is available year around means trouble for my wallet, as I'm sure I'll be buying tons of it in the next few months. Can't recommend it enough.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Not very much working on the nose, a little plum, light malt  Not a ton going on as far as flavor profile notes as well. Light caramel, plum, light malt. Almost a nutty-pumpkin bread like aftertaste  Mouthfeel is pretty good. Good carbonation smooth most of the way with a little bitterness at the end.  Overall I'm a little confused with this beer. It takes like a blonde bock to me. Flavor notes along with the smell are pretty flat. It's not bad and is a decent spring type beer. But I'm just so confused with what it's trying to achieve cuz it's just so simple.

The bubbles look like driving through a heavy snow storm with your high beams on. Chunks of foam and partial tunnels(not rings) of lace cake my glass right to the bottom and even the bottom of my glass still has an inch of head. Perfect!!  S lemon, rind included, dry cereal, lots of peppery spice, faint funk and even fainter bubble gum  T the bubble gum has now been chewed and I pick up on some tropical fruits both citric and banana, some yeast I couldn't smell, and just a touch of booze along with everything I smell  M light and very fluffy, not turning to foam in your mouth but heavily carbonated in a manner that's on the edge of being too much but its just keep in check. Big length on the finish and bitter enough to please me  O I know the Saison is a loose style but this beer has all the things I personally look for, refreshing, light, a little booze but well concealed considering, funky yeast and something to set its self apart from every other farmhouse ale, in this case zero fluctuation's from how I view the perfect Saison.  even with a 750ml bottle I found myself smelling an empty glass before this review was typed.

42,141,Kinsman,3.92,"Crisp clear golden colored body. Big fluffy white head with a slightly sticky texture.  Lemon citrus and floral with some hints of grain on the nose. Yeast production adds strong spicy phenols with some peppery and clove-like notes. Slight musty wood character and a faint nuttiness.  Pale malt characteristics provide a base for the flavor with notes of lemon and some herbal flavors in addition to these. Strong yeast profile provides a mix of phenols and faint hint of alcohol. A bit of a barnyard funk but the spice notes take over.  Light, crisp, and bubbly mouthfeel. Overall, one of the best widely available saisons around. Nice balance of funk with the rest of the flavors.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,JTSbeerislife,4.42,"12 oz. bottle Poured into a Duvel Tulip tasting glass with nucleation etching on bottom, great glass!  A: Beautiful golden pale yellow. Poured a nice thick 3/8"" head with excellent retention  S: Wonderful fresh yeast and crushed spices. It smells ""alive"", even though from a bottle it smells like it just came from the tap  T: Big rush of delicious yeast infused carbonation. This is so typical of the style and I find this very enjoyable. Some hop character but in no way ""piney"". It definately has it's own character, more of a citrus experience. Hint of lemon and spices. Quite full bodied due to ABV which gives this a wonderful balanced flavor and full mouthfeel. Long lingering finish of yeast, lemon, spices.  O: Well I have to say this is one of the best Saison's I have tried and I have tried many. True to type. Did I mention that this beer is just spot on delicious!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,titosupertramp,4,"A: Hazy, dark golden in color..looks almost like pineapple juice. Frothy 3-4 fingers of white head. Leaves some lacing and nice bubbly cap.  S: Sweet with just a hint of spice and funk. Raisins, apricot, apple, yeast, banana.  T: Just like the nose. Apples, banana, raisins with a good bit of spiciness. There's some breadiness and bubble gum at the end...actually a good bit of bubble gum.  M: Almost buttery, leaves a tingling behind.  O: Maybe not the best saison I've had, but certainly belongs in the conversation. In fact, I'd say this is the best of style available in Nashville for what it's worth.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,habanosdarklord,4.5,"Pours a nice hazy yellow color. The head on this one is the best I've seen on a Saison/Farmhouse. Thick, creamy 3 finger head that sticks to the glass. The aroma is spot on. Ripe fruit comes to mind first, kiwi, bannana, green apple, and peach. You also get some nice bread/dough flavors in there as well. The taste follows the nose almost exactly. I love the fruit you get with this beer. There is a slight funk that is going on too. Musty like flavors on the finish. Overall, I loved this beer. Right up there with my favorite saisons.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,ChugginOil,4.2,"Hennepin  12oz bottle into a BPA gold rimmed pint glass @ The House Pub.  The color of this brew is a ultra cloudy yellow-straw. A little less than 2 fingers of white head holds great retention a leaves solid walls of lacing as it slowly goes down.  The nose is mainly Belgian yeast funk with some spicy/fruity esters. There is an inviting candy aroma as well, offering hints of bananas.  The taste is pretty damn similar to the nose, just intensified! Bananas blend with the spicy characteristics and a bit of hops linger. Yum. A bit of a wheat taste is noticed at the end.  The mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing, however, a medium-bodied feel gives it a rich, full feeling. Crisp amount of carbonation thrashes the flavors across the palate.  Overall, this is an excellent summer time brew thay can become dangerously drinkable. The comination of flavors is balanced nicely and rubs me the right way.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

S: clove, citrus, bubblegum, sour grape, cracker-like malt, light level of Belgian funk.  T: clove, banana, cracker-like malt, and a distinctive sour note up front, the middle releases a load of spicy, phenolic goodness, with more clove, pepper, and plenty of floral and fruity notes, the finish is mildly earthy with a touch of grassy/herbal hop and a floral end note.  M: medium-bodied, silky texture, moderate carbonation.  O: a delicious saison, and very drinkable. It pairs nicely with a grilled hamburger.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

T: orange juice with a drop or two of lemon juice. the alcohol is definitely evident as well, with a brief cereal-like maltiness in there after the alcohol. finish is pretty dry, but not entirely with some lingering sweetness.  M: a serious effervescence on a medium body.  D: the alcohol definitely is evident on this one. not so much in the taste, but more on the brain. at 7.7 this isnt a shocker. overall a great drinker and a great example of the style.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Nearly total sheets of lacing. Almost perfect look.  S: Earthy hops, bready grains. In saisons, I always anticipate the yeast will play a large part, not only in the nose, but also in the taste. Wait, there it is, slightly funky, with hay smells, hint of metallics.  T: Again, earthy. I am struggling to determine if the flavors I'm getting are actually from hops or yeast. Slightly bitter, peppery, lots of grain. Still hints of metal. A little clove on the finish.  M: Light body and highly carbonated. Dry finish.  O: Well done.

M-medium creamy carbonation with a dry finish  O-i found that the belgian spiciness makes this not very drinkable. I like it in other belgians, but in this the taste gets tiring. this is pretty much an average saison that i don't feel is great for the style. i wouldn't recommend this to people more accustomed to the style, but that's just me.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Smell: A combination of yeast, spices, pepper, and lemon. Some sweet malts in the background.  Taste: Spice, pepper, and yeast up front followed by banana and cloves.

Smell - picking up some grassy nodes, along with slight citrus. there are hints of banana in there as well, although subtle.  Taste - oh man, what a great tasting beer. some sweet, little bitterness near the end, so good. you can really taste the sweet from banana's early, the hops and grass nodes add the bitterness to the end.  Mouthfeel - very full, very rich, very dynamic, adds such a sweetness to the beer while bringing the bitterness fwd even more. So good!

S: Mostly wheat with some yeast notes, all underscored by that distinctive Belgian funk.  T: Unsurprisingly, a strong wheat flavor up front with a bit of citrus to follow. Finishes with a distinctive Belgian funk.  M: Quite dry all the way through, with a refreshing amount of carbonation.  D: Can't taste the alcohol at all, which is great for the 7.7% ABV.

The head is foamy and white with fairly good retention and strong lacing. There is a lot of visible carbonation.  S: Smells primarily of yeast and a little spice. There is a bit of citrus/lemon to the scent and some hops.  T: Again, one of the dominant flavors is earthy yeast. The most notable flavor is that of bananas, which is surprisingly identifiable in this beer. There are also some spices. The finish is clean and somewhat citrusy. The alcohol is noticeable but mild.  M: Feels fairly dry with a decent amount of carbonation.  O: A nice farmhouse ale. Belgian yeast plays a large role and it is drinkable, dry and clean.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,bobhits,3.03,"Pours a huge head, large bubbles, but unlike most large bubbled beers these have some staying power. The body is citrus lemon like yellow and fairly clear given the Belgian Nature of this one.  OK, what the hell is that smell….pouring this one is smells like something has gone terribly wrong! Surprisingly once in the glass and smelling the beer in there, it smells pretty decent. Somewhat sour nature gives off lemon, pale malt, pepper, and just overall smells dry if that’s possible.  Wow hops, bannas, cloves, funk, the hef flavors given way to apples and pears with a following sips. There are light subtle candy flavors here, but they don’t balance the sour citrus nature of the beer. A rather interesting and refreshing beer.  A summer master piece on the tongue at first, but the weight of the alcohol comes into play here a bit. I’m not sure when or why one should drink this beer, but I’d highly recommend trying it out.  I hate reviewing this style as they all seem to take on such different characteristics. There is always a hop/sour effect but after that it seems like everything is fair game. As a result all I can say is this one of the best I’ve had with the style, but I believe the results can still be far better.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

A - Poured a gloriously crystal clear golden hue with a massive, rocky three finger head that slowly slumped into a thick white blanket leaving average side lacing.  S - Bananas, belgian spices, light yeast aromas. Very nice.  T - Just like the nose there are those delicious belgian yeast and spice notes with some simply wonderful banana and possibly clove esters on the end. Very, very good.  M - Really nice mouthfeel. Just enough carbonation to keep this crisp though it is almost cloy with all that banana.  O - Really, really good saison here. So easy to find and reasonably priced.

42,141,MinnesotaRIS,4.3,"Served in a hansa pils glass. Pale, bright yellow and brilliantly clear appearance if the bottle trub weren't swirled in. Trub is suspended in the top foam and makes an amazing display as it falls. Tiny bubbles float up. White head that is rocky, stands for a bit then falls at an average rate.  S - very pleasant aroma of a light, refreshing beer. Almost lagery with other notes that round it out - earthy, grassy, a touch of the rustic.  T - Saison that has been well aged. Again, earthy and grass like. Alcohol has some sharpness and is evident in the taste but it is soft, rolling over the palate. Finishes with a touch of citrus but not from hops. Tastes more like natural additions other than hops and malt; malt is very subdued. Clean finish.  M - Lingering finish. Very complex mouthfeel that makes one want to have this with a very delicate meal - nothing overpowering or overfilling. Low body that is sharp and supported well.  Great beer.

Mouthfeel: creamy and carbonation. Coates my mouth very well and leaves a clean finish/feeling.  Overall: Wow, freakin delicious. I have no idea where the 7.7% ABV is and could easily drink a bunch of these. Aroma is inviting, taste and mouthfeel make me want to drink more and more.

Flavorful: citrus, lemon juice, wheat, some table sugar, hops come thru towards the finish complimenting the light fruit with some dry and bitter. Esters of banana and clove appear and bring subtle booze along as an aftertaste. Medium bodied with zappy carbonation and a slight cloying of flavor.

Carbonation bubbles ascend feverishly for a good while.  S -- Grassy funk, grain, and hints of spices and horse blanket.  T -- Spicy earth tones and grassy on the front, citrus zest and grain that is fairly dry and somewhat biscuity.

Aroma is banana, lemon, yeast, spice, dough, apple, pear, fruity, a bit funky. Very good strength.  Flavor is more fruits such as banana, apple and pear, some lemon citrus, yeast/bread/dough, a bit of spice, minimal to no alcohol, light sweetness.  Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied, good scrubbing carbonation, slightly syrupy.  Not very experienced in Saisons, but found this to be a tasty, well-crafted brew.

42,141,LeeryLeprechaun,3.36,"The corked bottle opened with a wonderful POP! I was very excited to try this beer and it poured a gorgeous hazy straw yellow that prevented you from seeing through the glass. The aroma was less complex than I expected and was yeasty and floral. The beer was notably carbonated and bubbles played on my tongue with every sip. However, the flavor did not have much depth and the only aftertaste was about a second of sour on the very tip of my tongue. The brew was enjoyable but will not be placed on the top of my list.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,sixerofelixir,4.35,"12 oz bottle. Lots to read on the label.. very informative.  Pours a glorious straw-yellow. Big, gravity-defying white head (at first) then settles down and washes the glass splendidly. Many tiny protein particles at the last pour. Smells great too; clove, citrusy herbs and spices. floral notes. Tastes great too; a bit of mineral on top of the aforementioned lemon-grass. Mildly hopped, bitter finish. ""Heavy"" for such a lite-looking brew. Alcohol is a tad warming. Great brew here, a classic indeed.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,ludachris,4.08,"This is my first beer from Ommegang and first from my big beer haul from Premier Gourmet in Buffalo. What a place.  The slightly hazed golden straw body is well carbonated and already looks refreshing. About a finger and a half worth of creamy tightly knit white head sits on top and for a long time. Thick and creamy sheets of lace are left behind as the head slowly receedes. This looks fantastic.  A subtle and pleasant nose gives off notes of Belgian yeasr, musty and wet straw, some welcomed over ripe Anjou pears and just a touch of spice. Very well balanced with no one thing being overly pronounced.  Just as balanced in the taste as well. A bit more spice forward than what I was expecting but it does well at meshing with the grassy/musty hay character that is prevalent throughout. I still get some pear-like sweetness on the tip of the tongue but it has been greatly reduced from the nose to taste. A subtle grassy bitterness is what's left, accentuating the dry finish.  I forgot that this was 7.7% ABV when I took my first sip and was surprised at the body of this thing. Its got a smooth, rich, and creamy feel with a great bubbly kick. Well balanced through and through with a dry and subtley bitter finish that makes me want to take another sip. Besides its medium and rich body, there's no indication of its higher ABV.  I haven't had all that many Saisons but this one explains why they're becoming one of my favorite styles of beer. Smooth, crisp, refreshing, and tasty; perfect for nearly any occasion. I'd definitely buy this againa and can't wait for my next Ommegang brew!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,brewerburgundy,4.41,"25.4oz bottle, bottled on 2/17/10, best by 2/2012, Boulevard tulip.  This is a 5 if I’ve ever seen one. The straw yellow beer is covered in a luxuriant, sticky white cloud. It looks so pure.  The nose is largely Belgian yeast; lightly funky with bubblegum, clove, and sage. Earthy lemon mixes with pale Belgian malts or wheat. It’s obviously a well balanced beer.  Musty pale Belgian malt bubbles up once I take a taste. All the yeast is still there, working to make a spicy but balanced farmhouse ale. Malt sweetness is very polished, and the finish moves towards spicy dryness.  As the appearance would lead one to believe, this beer is filled with many fine, tickling bubbles that assist the spice of the yeast and perception of dryness. After some time it is still well carbonated and becoming creamy. The body is moderate and this has proved to be an adequate refreshment on this inaugurally hot day of the year.  Overall, this is one of my favorite Saisons and, to me, is the best of the ‘must tries’ that I’ve tried. Hennepin has continued my interest in the style and shows how the beauty of Saison is in simplicity with so many variations.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Smakawhat,3.83,"Poured from 12oz bottle into a tulip glass.  Giant white hard rock head coming out of the bottle even on a slow pour, three four fingers big. Body is real gorgeous looking, very light yellow gold and clear with visible carbonation coming up. The body is almost pale green! Head falls at a simple pace. Real nice looking beer.  Bouquet is a good smelling bread like yeast, not Belgian like but almost, gaseous smelling a little, seems more Belgian Pale Ale than saison like, sort of a weak Delirium Teremens.  Taste though is more saison, light bodied but kind of pale ale tasting. No sourness, no funkyness really pretty easy drinking. Kind of not what I expected for this category. For 7.7 abv this doesn't feel big but is easy drinking so that's great.  Overall this is quite tasty but this doesn't feel like a saison at all, most saison's I find real polarizing and this is more into simpler Belgian pale ale territory with sweetness. I do admit though I like it, I would tell people to start here for this style before grabbing something like a Dupont or god forbid a Fantome for a first time saison drinker.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Good carbonation and a nice big head top the beer. Aroma is tart and fruity with damp straw underneath. Taste is honey sweet - almost surprisingly so - followed by a refreshing lemon dryness. Crisp light cracker malt can be found in the middle of the beer, with a light peppery phonolic finish that's dry and leaves you wanting to drink more. Mouthfeel is effervescent and somewhat sticky, kind of like a sticky soda.

42,141,chicagoabbot,4.17,"Out of a snifter...a good looking beer with a pale cloudy body that supports a respectable head. Good funky Belgian yeast, with a very similar final character to their BPA, which is a good thing.  On the tongue, it's sharp, with a hoppy grassiness and the yeast funk carries through quite well. It's slightly more bitter than some other examples of the style, and is definitely balanced to the yeast and hops over the malt. Crisp and tangy. Make no mistake though, this is a good saison and even more impressive for being made in the USA.  Mouthfeel is clean and energetic. Overall, this is a highly enjoyable beer, although a little on the expensive side to be sessionable. Recommended. I've also had this out of the 750ml corked bottle, and this might be sacrilege but I enjoyed it slightly more this way, it was sharper...or perhaps that particular 750ml had been sitting on the shelf a little long...I don't think this beer should really be aged too much, it's a little low on the abv and heavy on the hops for that.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

A: Belgian yeast, orange, lemon, light spice, and grass. I thought the nose was a little light overall.  T: Pretty straightforward. Lemon, grass, pepper, and orange. The belgian yeast imparts it's traditional notes. I don't think this is very complex, but it's nice nonetheless.  M: Light body, aggressive carbonation.  O: I was slightly let down by this one.

It will not go away.  S - Clove, pepper, slight bubblegum, a little citrus sweetness. bready-ness.  T - If you only taste the head, it's completely pepper. But why would you do that? Sweetness dominates the other flavors in the taste. Pepper, bubblegum, and clove are still there, but white grape is a new flavor that dominates.  M - Light bodied, highly carbonated, which is good. Finish is light, sweet and slightly drying. The finish is very similar to the taste, not too different from the overall taste. Light white grape flavor, some slight clove, and a little bit of pepper.  D - Fantastic overall saison. Well balanced between the uniqueness of a saison and the sweetness of the malts and fruity esters. While the alcohol is not noticeable it takes effect pretty quickly.

S - spicy phenolic cloves, a little metallic, slightly musty, but not a big horse blanket presence I expected.  T - well, doesn't really taste like a saison. How is this ranked higher than dupont? Don't get me wrong, it tastes good - a lot of clove, a nice portion of malt. Tastes extremely similar to Duvel. Where is the funkiness thought? If this was classified as a SBGA then I probably would have given it a 4.5 for taste, but I don't think this is very true to style.  M - really nice carbonation with a little syrupy character to it.  O - I am pretty disappointed by this one. It just played it too safe with the funk.

Nope, but it is exactly what you want to see in a beer garden.  The Smell is light. Doesn't smack you in the nose. But if you get close enough the fragrance is worth it. Wonderful smell. Wish there was more of it.  The taste is perfect. Light lemony citrus with subtle sweetness. Nothing overbearing.  Light and crisp to the mouth. You could could potentially drink it after a workout. :) But why do that???  Overall I say what a wonderful beer! Cheers!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,therica,4.3,"Bottle poured into a pint glass. So sue me ;-)  A= very cloudy light lemon, beautiful. Nice active white head, dissipates after settling into plentiful lacing, rimming and pooling.  S= light nose but right for the style, growing bolder as it sets for a few minutes. Light hops florals, lemon citrus, plentiful malts. I typed this review in about 10 minutes (eating nothing), then went to take a sip and got a strong nose of what seemed like white chocolate! Bizarre! Talk about a diverse beer.  T= slightly dry and tart up-front, much like a fine champagne (I'll prefer this beer next New Years!). Lemon zest, generous malts for the style, light coriander, slightly bready in the finish at times. Gorgeous.  M= a little tart and dry on the tongue and palate, citrus zesty zip, mild residual malts.  D= a beer you can drink forever if you enjoy a Belgian-style beer. Beats Blue Moon out of orbit, for your pseudo-""craft"" BM drinking friends. Grilled or steamed fish (fried oil might disguise the enjoyment), poultry, seafood, popcorn, most anything non-red or dark. Aside from the tart-dry tongue that might put some people off, it's superb. Answer? Keep it flowing so you don't have time to have a dry tart mouth!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,phiberoptik,4.07,"750ml bottle poured into a wine glass for lack of better glassware. I actually purchased this bottle to use in the Thai braised chicken recipe from the magazine. Its in the oven as we speak!  This beer pours with a lot of white fluffy head and a beautiful deep clouded orange.  I get sweet orange some spice as well as malt in the nose. Some yeastiness as well as a light tinge of alcohol.  The taste is sweet with hints of fruit, yeast, and malts as well as the alcohol tingling in my mouth and throat. I do not get as much of a lingering finish as I would like but this is a highly enjoyable tasting beer to me.  I get a lot of carbonation on the tongue almost like a sparkling wine.  Overall this is a great beer to savor and my wife and I will probably split another one in the near future. I am just really looking forward to how this BA recipe with Hennepin is going to turn out! I will post a review of it later!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Strong funkiness prevails as well.  M: Goes down well.  D: Very complex flavors kept me coming back for more.

42,141,JayQue,4.38,"Hennepin is one of those beers that I have had many times, enjoyed greatly and never got around to reviewing (Legend Brown Ale is still in that category, Oskar Blues Ten Fidy was another one).  Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Big bubbly white head with excellent retention and lots of thick lacing. The head could be described as delicate and frothy at the same time.  Smells good too! A hint of funk and some lemony aroma.  Tastes as good as an import. Funky yeasty mustiness and horse blanket effect, more than balanced by lemony spicy taste. There is a hint of sweetness (honey?) here as well/  Mouthfeel is good. The carbonation is spot on and makes this a light and zesty experience.  Very good overall. Hennepin is a great beer and goes fantastic with a meal.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,musicforairports,4.2,"Pours on the golden side of straw-colored, an abundance of carbonation creates an enormous head (3+ fingers) with a vigorous pour. A softer pour makes for a different (but equally good) drink.  Smells like yeast, a bit of spice, perhaps a titch of alcohol, and a bunch of mustiness.  Tastes of those dusty flavors mixed with citrus rind, hints of clove, alcohol, yeast, other spices. Finish is long and somewhat bitter. More robust than some others of the style.  Mouthfeel is thick for the style, a bit creamy, but still full of carbonation.  Overall, this is a great beer that manages to be refreshing while still being pretty robust in flavor. A good one to sip in the summer, and the most affordable Saison anywhere around here, as it comes in 4-packs.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,dirtyskunk,3.91,"Pours fairly opaque, a very appealing peachy yellow. Tons and tons of fluffy white head which keeps growing in my snifter until I actually start drinking. The head never really disappears, leaving a thin cap, and leaves somewhat spotty lacing.  The smell is nice but nothing remarkable, a little bit earthy and woody. Some very mild spice and malts. Sort of disappointing considering the abundant head and the use of a snifter.  Taste is also good, but not great. The earthy oak is at the foreground. A bit of toffee sweet malts, and barely a hint of sour funk as the beer warms. Pleasant overall, a little dry and musty and not as complex as it could be.  Good mouthfeel, the beer is highly carbonated and produces tons of foam, but it doesn't overpower and the carbonation isn't too prickly.  No complaints about drinkability. This goes down easy, but the taste is less than totally impressive so it doesn't compel me to drink another one or two. Good enough that I would probably buy another one for a tasting party or a nice meal though.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

M- Full of carbonation very rich feel  D- A very easy drink, alcohol is not felt, all in all i was suprised by the quality of an American take on this Belgian style.

42,141,evanlarkin,3.42,"Thanks to ngeunit1 for this bottle.  Appearance: In the air it looks almost clear. In the glass it takes on a straw yellow color, with just a slight haze and 1 1/2 finger white head made of big bubbles that fizz down and leave just a slight lacing.  Smell: Dry and malty, with a lot of belgian yeast scent. Kind of like a dry champagne, except malty instead of grape-y. Slight orange peel quality to it too.  Taste: Sweeter than the smell had led me to believe, but fairly dry. Orange zest and a few grape-like flavors. Some tangy hop character with low bitterness at the end.  Mouthfeel: This is a fairly straightforward champagne-bodied beer.  Drinkability: It's not bad, reminiscent of other belgian-style ales. I would not call it one of my favorites for the style, but it certainly isn't bad. I'll probably have it again in the future.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Finally home after a quick 1 day trip to Athens for my girlfriends birthday bash. I happily tear into this beer and end up getting a bit of wax inside the bottle, oops! Gentle pour still produces a voluptuous dense white head about three inches tall. As I let the head settle there is very little lacing being left on the glass. Aroma on this bad boy is nicely funky. Brett and some herbal earthy notes, lemon grass and sage come to mind. Light yellow in color with amazing clarity and constant carbonation.  Taste is slightly bitter with a very subtle but complex tartness. The lemon grass comes through on the taste but not much else in the herbal department. Mouthfeel is dry in the finish but very quenching upfront.  Going to go with saison for style.  The reveal - Ommegang Hennepin. This is a very good beer and I'm now realizing I've been neglecting it. For a readily available saison its very good and doesn't kill your wallet.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Lots of bubbles, and lots of lacing that stayed all the way through the beer.  Moving on to smell, we've got a whole mess (the good kind) going on in here. I'm notice (in no particular order) orange, apple and lemon.  The ""wow"" comes in with the taste. An explosion of flavour hits your palate, and each aforementioned fruit is augmented by a nice balance of carbonation.  The mouthfeel is very light, very crisp.

The scent can be enjoyed throughout my entire kitchen and the first taste truly brings this work of art to life.

The taste has a light fruitiness that lasts throughout, that is quickly hit a sharp spiciness and slightly bitter lemon rind, leading into a dry but yeasty finish.

The finish is on the crisper side and spice lingers on the tongue.  M: Light to medium body, and creamy at first, but drier towards the finish.  D: Though the beer has high ABV, it has complex flavors that are enjoyable and refreshing without being taxing.  Overall: Saison beers might be my second favorite type.

It tasted mildly sweet and yeasty with a slight acidic tinge at first and ended with mildly bitter yeast flavor and had hints of citrus, and other spices with the flavor lingering on the palate for a nice while.

42,141,Shoegaze99,4.26,"Ommegang rarely disappoints. Hell, they just might be the best American brewer of Belgian styles out there right now. That's why I was eager to try out the Hennepin, an example of the increasingly trendy farmhouse saison style.  Popped the cork, opened the windows, and poured into a lovely Ommegang glass.  This beer looks wonderful, pouring a slightly cloudy, grassy yellow with a healthy, rich snow white head that looks like whipped cream.  Cloying nose teases at pleasant spring grasses, with a slightly lemony zest. it's a very clear, fresh aroma that begs for this beer to be consumed outdoors. Open those windows!  Once you start to drink, all those aromas reveal themselves to be precursors to an equally subtle yet alluring taste. The zesty lemon leaps to the forefront at the tail end of the taste, and is preceded by the very slightly sweet, every so mildly grainy taste of fresh cut fields ... and not the negative kind of grassy associated with some lesser beers. This tastes like the fresh air of a Pennsylvania farm. It's quite nice.  Wonderfully bodied, perfect carbonation and an overall nice feel make this a sensational sipper.  Overall, Ommegang once again shows why they rarely disappoint. The Hennepin is a zesty, refreshing example of the farmhouse style. When the spring weather warms you NEED to have a bottle of this.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,ebby82,4.58,"Pours a light straw into a tulip glass with a significant, three finger head.  The aroma is of hops, a little fruitiness, and a dry, spiciness.  The taste is a bit of hops, backed up by some spiciness, perhaps coriander. I'm not sure how to describe it, but I know its wonderful.  I've never had a Belgian I didn't enjoy, but Ommegang is making a firm Belgian fan out of me. I'm drinking this during winter, but I can't imagine a much better spring or summer drink. It's crisp, refreshing, and yet, at 7%, its no slouch in the alcohol department.  I haven't had many saison's, but I can say with confidence, that this is an excellent example of its style, and one I will repeatedly return to.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

The aroma is peppery, some fresh banana, and a bit of medicinal alcohol in the background.  The foremost taste for me is that of cloves and bananas. A bit sour and a slight, but pleasant hoppy presence. Finishes rather dry with a bitter lemon-like aftertaste.  Quite highly carbonated and light bodied in the mouth, pleasant however.

Dessert tart (key lime pie?), lemon/citrus (not IPA-like, though). Spice.  Taste: More sourness, tart fruit (those that you bite on and make you see the stars if you have sensitive teeth). Several arches of sweetness and spice- some banana, some bread pudding. Reminds me of Weihenstephaner Hefe Weissbier. Finishes dry and slightly hoppy.  Mouthfeel: Very carbonated (and rightly so), tart but refreshing, medium body and full flavor.  Drinkability: Very chuggable, refreshing, easy. 7.7% is not noticeable.

A - Looks like a summer/baseball beer w/just a hint of cloudiness (depending on how much yeast you leave behind in the bottle); yellow/orange, w/a foamy head. Looks very *drinkable*! S - Just a hint of clove and a nice hop scent T - A bit of banana & clove off the top, but just a bit. This dissipates to a lemon-y hoppiness, which is done quite well, similar to a Weihenstephaner or a Munchener Helles for me; not very pronounced but just enough to make itself known. Finishes quite dry with a lingering hint of clove & hops and a bit of alcohol as well as a warning if you decide to slam it. M - Prickly on the tongue - this is nicely carbonated, definitely towards the summer-beer end of things which makes it very thirst-quenching. That 7.7%, especially in a bomber, could sneak up on you as a result. D - Extremely high; am drinking this on a warm-ish day in NC and it is just the thing. This is a lawn-mower type beer, especially if you like getting a healthy buzz on after mowing said lawn.

For having so mellow a flavor, the beer was surprisingly crisp and thin.

42,141,trevorjn06,3.46,"This Saison brewed in Cooperstown, NY is 7.7% ABV.  Pours a bright yellow, crystal clear, with 3 fingers of fluffy white head that recedes after a minute.  Aroma is pilsner malts, fruit, yeast and mild spice. Overall a fairly simple/straight-forward nose for a saison.  Taste is very dry, beginning with light, bread malt and light fruit flavors. Yeast, soapiness and a sharp bitterness follow, with the finish leaving an acidic bitterness, vegetal character and some yeast character behind.  Medium/light mouthfeel and high carbonation.  Overall I really do not care for this beer, it is too sharp and lacks all the depth of flavor and character that I love in saisons. This is the fourth time I have tried this beer an I have never enjoyed it, I think I'm done giving it chances.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Arithmeticus,4.28,"Had in ale glass  A: cloudy yellow, bushy head, nice carbonation, outstanding lacing S: lovely spritely aroma of lemon that lingers T: very lovely saison, with overtones of banana and clove; the brewers have hit the sweet spot on the bottle conditioning, giving the beer the depth of flavor one comes to enjoy in Belgian-style beers, yet without any cloying effects.  Overall, a fantastic beer. Cheers!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Wegomlegging,4.38,"Golden cloudy appearance with very nice lacy head. Pours nice, but pull back on the bottle at the last second to hold back the sediment. Really nice floral smell. Yeasty spicy flavor done right, with pure satisfaction in the finish. Snappy mouthfeel thanks to great carbonation, and very drinkable.

Spice heavy aroma with nutmeg, cloves and coriander coming through with hints of sweet fruity ester/bananas. Taste upfront is tart with a nice sweet finish. Very good mouthfeel. Crisp, tart, refreshing ale. Alcohol definitely warmed me up with every progressive sip. In spite of the higher ABV, this is a VERY drinkable ale. Very good lacing along the insides of the glass. This is a very good saison from Ommegang. Paired very well with some spicy curry. Definitely worth a try if you like this type of ale.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Peppery spice with banana and clove on the nose that leads to a nice peppery forefront and sharp bite on the palate. I just ate onions on my sandwich though. I feel a faint grape like mouthfeel in the back and finished spicy and slightly alcoholic. Overall a nice beer to have with any occasion.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

S: I could swear this was a wit beer. Tons of clove upfront with banana and other sweet aromas in the background. Yeasty, some citrus (lemon mainly), slight floral hops.  T: Just like the nose, this tastes like a classic hefeweissbier. Clove seems to dominate the flavor with banana and lemon in the background. There's a ton of floral yeast, very light buttered biscuit malt character. Finish is lemon, clove, slight alcohol, and Belgian yeast.  M: Fairly high, crisp carbonation. Light body. While it's light, the high level of yeast and solid malt character give the body a strong backbone that allows the flavors to flourish. I quite like beers that can achieve this.  D: As with the style (again, more wit beer than Saison), it's light, crisp, and delicious. This is quite easy to drink, though it's on the high end (7.7ABV).",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Then a bitterness takes control, before earthy malts gain strength.

Spice, citrus, and yeast are all present also.  T - Same as the aroma with hops, spice, citrus, and yeast. Sort of a sourness I think in the finish, bringing out that Saison-ness a little more. Slightly dry in the finish too.  M - Light body, medium carbonation. Needs more body or less alcohol b/c they don't seem to synch up for me.  D - Huge drinky on this.

It is one of my favorite Ommegang brews:  A: Pours a beautiful golden yellow with a little cloudiness. Not as ""unfiltered"" as some of your Belgian Saisons but looks good none the less  S: Decent amount of spice in the nose. Very refreshing scent.  T: There is something about this beer that keeps me coming back. It has a little spice in the taste that turns sweet while it's warming in your mouth.  D: Goes down smooth, if it was a little lighter on the ABV it would make a great session beer.  M: My only complaint is that it feels a little thin.

Great carbonation streaming off the bottom of the glass.  S: Great clean Belgian yeast aroma right up front. The earthy, clove like aroma is great. Really nice and light nose that is evident that this beer is well put together.  T/M: First taste is clean and earthy. Good banana clove flavors in the front of the palate. Towards the back of the palate is a funky earthy flavor, but not an off putting flavor at all.  D: Crisp clean and very nicely built beer. Love the flavors and the subtle Belgian funk.

Caught a big whiff of lemon and pepper as I uncapped this one. In the glass I'm getting both of those with some honey, banana, and vanilla. Smells nice and funky.  Taste is funky and fruity with a nice sweet and spicy finish. Wow, I'm getting a ton of flavors at once, it's hard to wrap my tongue around it all. Very enjoyable.  High carbonation but it's very creamy. Leaves a good feeling on the tongue.  Drinkability is pretty decent on this one. Carbonation is high but the taste is excellent.  Overall this is great.

It is still extremely drinkable and lighter, something I have come to expect from this beer. It's kind of cool to see how this beer compares to a newer vintage. On second thought, the beer has gained more of a champagne-y taste, a very delicate balance of sweetness, bubbles, and a little dryness. Very cool.

Smell - I got some bananas, clove, yeast, fruit and a subtle maltiness and sweetness.  Taste - I found some clove, bananas, spiciness, other fruits and some sweetness on the taste. There is a bit of a bite to it, and you get some alcohol bite to it as well towards the finish.  Feel - A lot of carbonation like champagne. This could be off putting to some, but I enjoyed it. There is not a lot of body, but there is a lot going on in the flavors.  Drinkability - I would rate this beer well on drinkability. With everything going on from smell to flavors, it was really nice.

A- Like a lager, bright yellow. Lots of mousse that effervesces like mad, settling into a thin top layer in my thin goblet.  S- The most apealing aspect of this beer is the aroma. Spicy with a note of citrus.  T - I can't get away from the rather unpleasant bitterness that overwhelms the palate. Not a pleasant bite, not balanced by anything else in the ale.

I expected this to continue, but I was in for a surprise. Each of the next sips improved the taste and the composition of this beer played its full tune. the bitterness softened to a great balance to the fruit flavors. the mouthfeel is a prickly medium bodied beer.

42,141,airheadmtrcycle,4.28,"Twelve oz. bottle poured into a Sam Adams Perfect pint. Big bubbly head that leaves tons of lacing as it recedes. The ale is clear and golden (almost orange) with bubbles rising from the bottom.  The aroma is of honey, citrus and more. Quite inviting. Very interesting, but subtle. I expected more. I taste a slight sweetness followed by something tart and dry, almost champagne-like in taste and mouth feel. Yes, and some citrus flavors that are more lemon-like. Perhaps some tangerine as well.  After 4 or 5 sips and maybe a gulp or two I add the yeast from the decanted bottle. The aroma explodes into something sour that I've smelled before, but I can't quite make it out. The taste is muddier, less distinction of flavors. Perhaps the tartness increases some. Very tasty in its own right, but I think I prefer the yeast back in the bottle and tipping it up after the glass is gone.  The mouth feel is refreshing, sparkly, but substantial. This one beer is exceptionably drinkable. Two might be pushing it. I've had trouble finishing a 750ml bottle before. In fact I don't think I've ever finished one on my own.

Sweet smelling which plays off the earthy grains in the background.  T: First tastes are the funk you'd associate with a great aged blue. I think the yeast is huge in this beer, it lends so much flavor and aroma. Has a nice biting grassy flavor that is cut through with the crisp citrus. Finishes spicy with a lingering flavor of clove, nutmeg, and pepper.  M: Mouthfeel is spot on for this one I'd say, light bodied with a strong carbonation that helps to move along and heavy lingering flavors.  D: Bought a keg of this for New Year's Eve to go along with Michelob Ultra. Group was BMC drinkers for the most part but they were all adventurous and stepped out of their comfort zone.

I think it was a bit too cold, and it suffered a bit because of it.  S - Lots of strong bready belgian yeast up front. Plenty of barn yard funk with some faint earthy hops. I really think the colder pour hurt the appearance and smell of this one greatly.  T - Plenty of funk up front mixes well with a bit of sweetness. Some muted earthy hops add a nice hop bite. Hops seem to come out a bit more once it has had a chance to warm up a bit. A touch of black pepper adds some spice to help break up all bready sweetness. Finish is funky but not overpowering. I love how this one is light and refreshing and yet still filled with bold, rustic, flavors that make it one of the best saisons.  M - Light body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Not as barn yard funky as some of the other drafts of Hennepin that I have had in the past but still funky none the less.  D - Very high. I absolutely love this one.

42,141,Mississipping,3.69,"750ml corked and caged bottle chilled and poured into a Pisgah Brewing Co. pint glass  A: Appearance is exceptional ... beautiful hazy straw color with huge fluffy eggshell colored head that takes forever to dissipate. Even with a gentle pour, it took several to fill the glass past the halfway point. As the head begins to recede, it leaves behind an impressive, sticky, and mesmerizing lacing.  S: The smell is not nearly as impressive as the appearance. More pilsner-like than a saison, there just doesn't seem to be much going on here. A little bit of barnyard funkiness, a bit of citrus fruits, and mildly yeasty, but overall, disappointing.  T: The taste is exactly what one would expect from the aroma. Again, more pilsner-like than a saison, with a slight breadiness, very, very subtle citrus and spice notes, and just a bit of booze at the end. There seems to be a lot missing here that would really help the profile. It's just bland as it is.  M: Mouthfeel is approaching impressive, but still a little on the lighter side with adequate carbonation that makes it bubbly and smooth on the palate. Not overly dry, which I think is a very nice characteristic.  D: Drinkability is very high, as the alcohol is hidden well and it drinks more like a plisner or a hefeweizen. I finished the bottle myself with dinner, and could have opened a second easily.  Overall: I have really been looking forward to trying this out, as it has received some pretty great reviews and is something that isn't available where I live, but I was really let down with this. HOWEVER, I should note that I think I opened the bottle too soon after taking it out of the fridge. The second glass that I had was better than the first, and some of the things that I look for in a saison (biscuity, spicy, funky, and citrusy) came out slightly as it warmed.

Tangy and sweet, bready with a few nuts, citrus, cloves, pepper, apricots, tangerines, bananas, good malty body with light hops. Great balance of flavors, an excellent saison, one of my favorite styles.  Feels delightful, just like I want a saison to feel.

42,141,DaveBlack,4.05,"12 oz. bottle poured into a tumbler  A: Pour looks pretty good. It has about a two-finger head on the top, which has decent retention but doesn't leave much in the way of lacing. The beer is a rich golden color and slightly cloudy.  S: Citrus fruits are the first thing that hit my nose, along with a lot of spice. There is also a strong smell of yeast and a slight hint of the alcohol. Very reminiscent of the Hefeweizens that I've had  T: Tastes a lot like it smells: Yeasty, spicy and a hint of citrus. Once again, you can taste the alcohol, but it hides it very well. I never would have pegged this as a 7.7% ABV. Really great, complex flavor.  M: High carbonation balances the flavor nicely, and it doesn't feel very heavy. It has some stickiness to it after the first few sips, but nothing too drastic.  D: Overall, a very good beer. It's actually scary how drinkable it is for the alcohol content. A six pack of this could make for a very good, or very bad, night.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

It has a distinct bread flavor that plays with the fruit flavor.  Peppery and fruity are the first flavors, leaning back to a malty bread taste that finishes with bitter spicy hops. Excellent complex beer that is extremely refreshing.  Mouthfeel is very light especially considering the ABV. The carbonation has incredible lifting power and slightly drying characteristics.  Drinkable. Almost too drinkable.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

I gave it an aggressive pour but despite that, the head is fairly thin. Its almost purely white, fluffy, and turns into a thin film at the top of the beer fairly quickly. There's no lacing whatsoever on this one.  Smell: fruity, some spices like clove, cardamom, some yeastiness and alcohol.  Taste: I can see how these beers were meant to be drank through the summer by farm workers. Follows the nose with some spices, fruitiness like apple and raisin, some yeast and a hint of alcohol. It straddles the line between being complex and being easy drinking and does it quite well. There's some citrus and floral characters in the taste as well. The alcohol is well hidden in the taste.  Feel: medium to light body with a lot of carbonation. Alcohol warmth isn't there.  Drink: very drinkable. I could drink this all day.  Overall, a very nice beer. I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it. I am not sure if my grades do it justice based on style, so I just graded based on how I enjoyed it.

Cloves and coriander dance with orange peel.  The mouth is happy too. Those same spices greet the tongue, along with that same orange peel, and some peppery notes.  Mouthfeel is fantastic. It's crisp and refreshing, almost cleansing. Despite all the spices, it's a gentle feeling that seemingly cleans your palate.  A simple beer to drink. It tastes good and provides a crisp feeling as it goes down. Despite the spices and high alcohol, there's no burning whatsover, it actually seems to cool you.

42,141,Chico1985,3,"12oz to Unibroue tulip, no best by date listed.  Pours a clear golden color with a huge puffy white head, lots of bubbles, highly carbonated it seems. Dusty sediment floats about. Settles at a thick bubbly cap leaving some lacing.  Pale pilsner malts jump from the nose first and foremost. Typical Belgian yeast, some sweet candi sugar, wet grass and lemony hops follow. Just the tiniest hints of funk and hay. The pilsner quality reminds me a little too much of an generic pale Euro lager but the smell really starts to open up nicely after a bit.  Taste has notes of lemon/citrus/grass throughout from the hops, Belgian yeast and some candi sugar. I found the scent to be more enjoyable. Some bready notes in the finish. High alcohol taste dominates (at the finish especially) and is noticeable right from the get-go. Although it does fade over time, it is ever-present giving the beer a bit of a distasteful, soapy medicinal feel. Mouthfeel is not nearly as carbonated as the appearance would hint towards, has a creamy oily feel to it, but the booziness just about kills it.  Kinda reminds me of Duvel in some ways (which makes sense), but I couldn't get into this one much. Feels too boozy and just heavy and uncomfortable when it reaches your guts. Flavors that were present didn't really leave me wanting more.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

42,141,claspada,2.8,"Aromas are a bunch of upfront floral and spicy notes with pungent citrus. Dry pilsner bready biscuity malts are also detectable. Belgiany yeast is fairly apparent as well.  The taste is fairly aggressive for a saison (or at least what I prefer in my saisons). All kinds of things happening here. Alcohol isn't midden all that well and the esters aren't in balance with the hops, really sharp finish as well; really not a fan. Thick, yet extremely bubbly mouthfeel; carbonation is apparent for sure.  This is a real aggressive saison. I can tell it's extremely well-made, as Ommegang doesn't mess around when it comes to making good Belgian beer. I was a little put off by the rather strong alcoholic character, but perhaps that's how it should be.

Off the bat I had some mixed feelings. I had to pour this VERY slow or else there was more head than I wanted. The smell however was amazing.

42,141,BuckyFresh,4.3,"I've decided that drinking before watching the Detroit Lions play is probably a good idea. Whatever I can do to dull my sense of disappointment I guess...  Appearance: Poured from a 12oz bottle into a large wine glass. Pours a hazy straw yellow, with a soapy-looking two-finger head. Lots of active carbonation in the glass. Retention is pretty darn good considering how large the bubbles in the head are. Some lacing is present, but it slides off the sides of the glass pretty quickly.  Smell: There's a nice characteristic funk in the smell, as well as grainy malt and citrus. If you inhale deeply enough, you pick up some of the underlying peppery spice that gives Saisons such a unique aroma. There is also a bit of fruity sweetness in the background, as well as a touch of alcohol.  Taste: The flavor is a well-balanced representation of what the nose had to offer. Good citrus bite up front, followed by some grassy malt, and finished with some spicy yeast and a touch of pepper. I love how the tartness and the dry finish act as bookends to the sweeter, fruitier flavors you encounter in the middle. This has to be one of the most well-balanced, easy-drinking Saisons I have had to date.  Mouthfeel: A little more tart and dry than I anticipated, but delicious nonetheless. Lots of carbonation and citrus bite, but refreshing and not at all overbearing.  Drinkability: Probably the most drinkable Saison I have had yet. A refreshing treat for the warmer months to be sure.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

There is a fruitiness present but it is not sweet in any way. Light bitterness at the finish. There is a hint of funk in there as well. Aftertaste is dry and fairly bitter.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with a decent amount of carbonation. Quite smooth.  Drinkability: High drinkability. The alcohol is very well hidden.  Overall: Very good beer overall.

M - Smoother and fuller bodied than I was expecting. It's still light like a saison should be, but it's more satisfying too.  D - Smooth and easy going. Didn't fill me up at all.

42,141,nhindian,4.06,"750ml bottle poured into an Ommegang flute.  Had a 750ml bottle of this laying around from the Ommegang gift set that I got a few weeks back. Decided to crack the second one after the Chocolate Indulgence as I've only had a tiny sample of this. Here goes!  A - After twisting off the cage and giving a little nudge on the cork... it literally flies off and bounces off two walls, landing conveniently behind my fridge. Luckily I had it faced away from my eye and there was surprisingly no gushing. Pours a steady,,cloudy, straw colored stream and builds a fantastic, 2-fingered, creamy, egg-white head. And this head is here to party. Even after drinking half of my glass it still is going strong, unleashing the sweet aroma, probably in part due to the rising carbonation at the bottom of the glass. Interestingly, the head repels the glass for the most part and most of the lacing comes from the edge where I drink, while the head on the opposite just glides back and forth without sticking. As I get closer to the end, the head finally gives into the glass, but unlike earlier, it holds on for dear life. Some really fantastic lacing here.  S - Smells faintly of a Belgian pale, with a bit of barnyard funk to it. Nothing Bretty, but freshly mowed grass, lemon, and citrus are the predominant smells. Getting some malts, but overall it's a pretty mild nose. Definitely a defined crispness. Really effervescent as the carbonation expels all the nuances of the head.  T - Taste is certainly giving various impressions. Like the nose, there is a Belgian pale familiarity here with the coriander and lemon taste that imparts a spicy bite and peppery aftertaste. But then you also get a tannic, almost grape-like taste behind that mixes in a bit of alcohol. These combinations are refined and delicately balanced, however, and it goes down great. A bit bitter at the end, but a fairly dry finish keeps each taste fresh.  M - Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and highly carbonated. Tingles and pricks the mouth and really plays into the dry, crisp, and peppery finish. A real treat to enjoy and can see this pairing fantastically with a nice dinner.  D - Drinkability is high. A very slight alcohol bite at the end is the only reminder that this is a 7.70% beer as it drinks almost too easily. An excellent offering from Ommegang and a great representation.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Bready, sweet tones with just the right combinations of lemon zest, clove, coriander, and white grape without too much funk like many saisons. Taste was even more impressive, with all the aforementioned flavors and a champagne-like dryness, especially in the finish.

42,141,zoso1967,4.45,"Pours an ever so slightly cloudy pale golden color with a frothy and light head. The foam has marathon retention and leaves loads of beautiful white lace on the sides of the glass.  The aroma is equally stunning with a good pear, wheat tartness, some funk, lemon grass, white pepper and a touch of clove. All the flavors are very well integrated.  The flavor is much drier than you would expect from the aroma. It also carries a slight tartness from the wheat, as well as some fairly subdued funk notes. It has a decent amount of wheat to it, and a bright, slightly lemony hop character that mingles with plenty of peppery yeast. This beer has a nice pear flavor that fades in near the finish, and then fades out after swallowing. Very tasty.  The mouthfeel is vigorously carbonated and medium in body. Combined with the dryness of the brew this creates a pretty invigorating and refreshing drinking experience. Somehow this beer still seems to retain some smoothness as well.  Super drinkable, especially for the ABV. This beer is one of the all stars of the American brewed Saisons and one of my favorites. I am not sure if the 12oz. bottles are a new thing, or if I had never noticed, but I am pretty excited to be able to enjoy this beer without finding an occasion where a 750 ml. works.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

M- Clean, crisp, and very refreshing.  D/O- At 7.7% the drinkability gets dinged a notch because it's such a distinct taste. I don't think anyone would want any more than one or two of these.

The beer smells of pears, crisp red apples, sour white grapes, mango and slight cinnamon notes notes. The flavor is a mixture of old champagne, slight flavors of orange, and grapefruit and some peppery notes in the back. This is a nice complex beer and it's not too harsh on the sour which is one thing that I tend to avoid as far as the style is concerned. The mouthfeel is a little too carbonated for my liking it is quite prickly in nature. The remainder of elements for the mouthfeel are rather nice still.

The taste is better than the aroma, with notes of lemon grass, orange zest, clove, lemon, straw. There is a subtle, spicy kick in the finish.

A - Pours a fluffy, bubbly two finger head. There was minimal lacing after the dissipation. Beer is a clear pale yellow, kind of disappointing in someways because I'm used to cloudier looking saisons but I guess thats whats fun about them; you never know what your going to get out of each brands beer.  S - Pale hoppy smell, kinda bready. Wheat, cloves, floral notes. Green apple, lots of spiciness.  T - Very crisp, has the usual saison tartness, however its a little over the top. Green apple is roaming around in there somewhere. Bready, estery alcohol tastes. Alcohol is very present at the end. Has a champagne like quality to it. Bready after taste. Finishes dry.  M - Body was very light and the carbonation was well balanced, which helped its drinkability. However, I thought the tartness was a little over the top and it didn't leave the greatest lasting impression on my pallet.  D - I enjoyed it but it was strangely more of a sipper than something i couldn't put down, which is unusual for me when it comes to saisons. I think the balance was slightly off. Overall, I enjoyed it but its not something that I would look for in the future. I think I was hoping for something else, probably something comparable to what I've had in other saisons (in terms of balance at least).

The nose comprises wheat, coriander, and lemon zest, with a touch of minor caramel in the very, very back. The taste follows along a similarly-landscaped path, though there's more wheat and a touch o' relatively minor funk hanging around the corners and edges and whatnot. And when I say minor, I mean AA, maybe even A (who doesn't love watching a Dunedin game, am I right?). The body is a very light medium, with a moderate carbonation and a somewhat dry finish. Overall, a nice, solid saison, not my favorite of the style but pretty good nonetheless.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

A-beautiful, hazy straw with another creamy head that really holds up for a LONG time, opaque and amazing  S-perfect for fall, both fruity and nutty, almost banana-ish and clove  T-really nice, just the right balance between fruit and carbonation  M-as close to the categories listed above as one would expect  D-very good, don't be scared by the 7.7, everything here is in wonderful balance",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,kreeper,4,"Coudy golden-orange, with billowy pure white head that sticks around for the long haul. Beautiful. Spicy banana aromas, very complex. Taste is herbal hops, pepper, clove, banana, candied ginger, caramelized orange rind, pear -- it's all in there!

42,141,Cannoneer,4.28,"This beer is a classic. I can get it in a 750ml bottle at $6.49 from a local beer store and at this price is has no rivals in the entire range of US-brewed craft ales.  The appearance and drinkability are both nothing short of exceptional. Color and notes of hay, baked golden apples, orange marmalade. Very well balanced with just the right amount of hops. This beer is a natural accompaniment to many kinds of grilled seafood and shellfish with light sauces. It excels alongside cheeses and grilled vegetables with roasted garlic also.  Perhaps the most salient feature of this ale still is the consistency of its quality. I've been drinking it since 2003 and am continuously impressed with how steadfastly it meets the expectations.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,paulozanello,3.43,"Had this on tap at Meridian Pint in DC. This is a beer bar that has three tables with individual taps that carries two pre-selected beers on them so you can pour them yourself and they will charge you like a gas pump. The night that me and my friends were there the beers on tap were the Hennepin and the new Sierra Nevada Tumbler (Fall Seasonal Brown Ale).  But anyway, the Hennepin poured a nice dark yellow/golden color, translucid, with a small white head and fairly good retention. It was pretty cool to pour a pint of Hennepin in my own glass as I've had this beer before and loved it.  The smell was dominated by malt/bready notes and a LOT of clove that was clearly overpowering the yeasty esters.  Taste was pretty much the same: started with bread sweetness and a lot of banana/clove that got me wondering if I was really having a Hennepin or if this was a Hefeweizen. I called the waitress and told her what was going on and she promptly brought me a sampler straight from the line downstairs. And it was sure different! I could now taste those spicy and fruity notes that make Saisons very complex and refreshing beers, given that the malt profile in this style is pretty much just regular pilsner or pale malt. Bottom line is that this beer was probably in this table tap for too long and lost a good deal of its complexity.  Mouthfeel was medium and carbonation was high making it very drinkable.  I know Hennepin is a good beer but I will just have to taste it again from a bottle because this table tap experience was not very good.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,JoeAmerican77,3.61,"Great appearance. Poured out straw and filled out a nice two and a half finger white roiling head that kept itself until my mouth did away with it.  Smelled of doughy yeast and flora. White flowers and lilac.  With the first sip you can really draw out flavors of honey, belgian yeast, sour dough and some spice. Not overly complex. No detection of alcohol, considering above 7% thats a surprise, but may come from me drinking it warmer than fridge off the bat.  Surprisingly full body for what it is, and welcome but light carbonation.  A pretty drinkable beer, I would say bust it out for a back patio summer day with friends and classic rock.

42,141,FeDUBBELFIST,4.2,"Bottle to tulip. Best by date of 04/2012.  A: First of all, every Ommegang beer I've ever seen has been an absolute stunner in the glass, and Hennepin is no exception. The head is 4 fingers high, the brightest white imaginable and it lasts annoyingly long. The half point lost is from the lacing which is good, just not as impressive as it could be. Medium goldenrod in color and very hazy. About a 15% transparency.  S: Very yeasty: must, barnyard and dough. Ample malts of bread and straw, lightly toasted. Hops are above average with pungent citrus aromas of orange and lemon as well as a distinct floral quality.  T & M: Spices, dust and paper hit the palate along with a tame sourness and a moderate level of residual sugars. The front end is sweeter than the back, which has a chalky dry finish. Full body with a thick, minerally texture cut through by the lively and fizzy carbonation.  D: Residual sweetness keeps the drinkability score average.

A touch of tobacco comes out as the beer reaches room temperature. T: Flavors of golden fruits, bubblegum, peppery yeast, kiwi?, melon, and lemon zest. Very doughy and bready as well with a light sourness in the finish. Hints of hay and wheat and maybe allspice. Aftertaste has a touch of peppery hops and toasted crackers. As the beer warms I get some notes of banana and cloves. The aftertaste is a bit sour, bitter and leafy tasting as well. M: Creamy frothy carbonation with a medium-full body. Finish is sweet and drying. D: A really complex beer. Thirty minutes into it I was still picking out new flavors.

42,141,MoreThanWine,4.41,Poured a light hazy gold with a big head that took forever to die down. Bouquet is a big wallop of citrus and spice and the flavor holds the same as well as some fruitiness and malt. And it all blends together seemlessly. And just like their Abbey Ale I'm simply amazed I can get this at Trader Joe's for around the $8 range.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,BamaViper1,3.88,"Poured from the 12 oz. bottle into a beer mug.  This beer has a straw yellow, slightly opaque color. A massive head results from the pouring of this beer, leaving the appearance of soap suds on the sides of the glass as it dissipates. Each sip leaves a bot of that soap-bubble styled lacing.  The smell of this beer is a little metallic with hints of yeast and fruit typical of a Belgian-styled beer. Potentially there is a little bit of citrus as well.  Hennepin tastes of mild citrus and light yeast coupled with dried fruit maybe. A malty-yeastiness maybe. The finish is full of alcohol flavor, which I didn't really expect. A little metallic.  This beer has a good bit of carbonation; chewing produces a good bit of that soap-like lacing in one's mouth. The alcohol makes it's presence known in feel too.  As far as drinkability, this beer is not too bad overall, a light Belgian-style that is bright and proves to be a nice sipper; however, the presence of alcohol flavor from a 7.7% ABV beer kind of makes me want to drink one, then move on.  Overall Ommegang does well in their saison offering.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,allforbetterbeer,3.83,"Poured into a tall thin glass at 50 degrees, only after the pour (which despite my best efforts to be gentle produced an out of control amount of head) I noticed the label says to serve it at 40 degrees.  Pours with 4 full fingers of billowy white head that sticks like sea foam on the glass as it recedes. Body is pale yellow and slightly cloudy, and full of little bubbles rising to keep the head alive. Very inviting and authentic looking.  Nose is full of soft yeasty bready very Belgian-yeast notes, noble hops and toasted malted barley. Some hints of clove spice and other spices like it. Swirling the beer only makes the head advance up the glass, which is true to the style.  Sourdough bread, yeast, and toasty sweet bread make up the flavor profile of this beer. A little banana makes an appearance as it warms, but not in a significant way. I am surprised to find a noticeable amount of alcoholic flavors here, and it is distracting from the rest of the flavor profile.  Rich, smooth, spicy and medium-full mouthfeel. High marks here, this is like bread in a bottle. Nicely sweet but bites enough to check the sweetness.  Drinkability could be higher if not for the noticeable alcohol.  Conclusion: I wasn't as impressed with this beer as I had hoped to be, but I have limited experience with this style, so I may simply not be able to tell why it is rated as high as it is.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Cloudy citrine and golden-yellow body with an immense rocky splashed white crown that recedes to a soapy fat finger. Sticky thick lacing, but no legs.  Mowed alfalfa, challa, orange-blossom honey, and faint spice in the nose. Generally (albeit mildly) floral and citrus-infused.  Dry, moderately hoppy (grassy/earthy noble varieties) palate entry. Grape skins, lemon/lime/orange zest, and white pepper round out the profile. Crisp well balanced taste, though the yeast could be a little more forward (I thought the bottled version would be better in this regard than the kegged version, but I can distinguish no difference).  Medium-light bodied, effervescent, and refreshing.  Quite drinkable, but lacks a bit of complexity and flavor compared to the better Belgian examples. Originally I would have excused this based on value, but over the years Ommegang has gone up in price making me less inclined to choose their offerings over those that are the source of their inspiration.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

The flavor is 'beyond the pale' in complexity. The yeast flavor is huge with a spicey and crispy first sip, and then a hefty mix of spice and pepper, and a pleasant bitterness from the hops with more earthiness to follow. The malt is actually pretty hefty with a brilliant subtle sweetness that provides amazing balance. hearty and earthy with a unique smooth malt along with a clean crispy feel that finishes smooth and long. the feel is like a luxury sports car (I can imagine) and pretty damn impressive for a something brewed outside a Belgian Abby.

42,141,GimmeAles,4.37,"Opaque blonde, spritzy carbonation produces billowing head. Drops some lace, but medium-to-poor head retention, the glass might be to blame here.  Plenty of dry, peppery spice - actually smells crackling dry. Soft, floral notes - lavender-like. A touch of sulphur.  The tongue is first awash with saltine cracker and bread crust, then drying carbonation floods the palate, wiping it clean with more pepper, chalky dust, faint citrus and a leafy, herbal character. Faintest whispers of candy-ish sweetness, but nearly non-existent. Pleasantly rustic and distinctly DuPont-like in overall character, though the greater 'heft' of this one (higher ABV) is noticed over all.  Pleasant, tongue-curling dryness is straight to style, begs for another sip, making this a solid, enjoyable Saison. I am biased as this is my favorite style, but this is a solid standard.

42,141,JetSmooth,3.51,"Some years back, my extremely good friend, Jake, gifted me with a three-bottle set from Brewery Ommegang. Ommegang is a Belgian brewery in Cooperstown, NY. I'm just going to let that settle in for a moment. You may associate Cooperstown with Baseball. But beer people associate it with Brussels. The three beers included in this set were the Hennepin Farmhouse Saison, Chocolate Indulgence, and Three Philosophers Triple. This review will be of the 2008 Hennepin Saison.  I'd been holding onto this beer since Christmas of 2008. I've not really aged beer before, but felt these would be good candidates. Keep the age in mind through this review.  Eyes: The Hennepin Saison pours from a 750ml corked and caged Belgian bottle as a bright amber. I stored this sideways and don't think all of the yeast settled back to the bottom from when I put it in the fridge to chill. The first pour was crystal clear but clouded up somewhat as the yeast snuck into the pour. Still, the golden amber was very inviting and ""rustic"". Head was creamy white and thick, but not fluffy. It clings to the sides rather well, but does not ""lace"" much. Eventually dissipating to a thin foam.  Nose: Nose is very thin. This could either be from the long aging or the fact that I have a late-summer cold. The aroma seems to be lightly plastic, but not in a repelling way. There's a little spice and maybe some fruit, but it's not the prominent component.  Tongue: At first, this beer comes across as rather bitter; not from hops. Rather, it seems to be an alcoholic bitterness. There is a good base of citrus and maybe ... I don't know; figs maybe? Hennepin came across as a little one dimensional until I was about half-way through the first pint. Spice began to present itself. Maybe a little pepper. There was some late-presenting malt. Definitely grainy, but not sweet. Perhaps this was through the temperature of the beer warming up over time. Still, I would have liked a little more fruit in a saison.  Mouth: There is a little bit of solvent to the mouthfeel. It lends to the spiciness of the beer. The higher alcohol level of this beer definitely provides a good burn and astringency, but not in a bad way. This isn't a liquor burn; more of a comforting warmth.  Overall: Despite the solvency and slight metallic taste, this beer is very drinkable. Most of the flavor comes through AFTER drinking and in the after taste. This would be a great beer for an October evening at a bonfire or barn party. This bottle could have been aged a little long. It was still a great beer!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Reaper16,2.04,"served on-tap at Mellow Mushroom - Tuscaloosa, AL - into a pint glass  Pours a straw yellow color that is fairly indicative of the style. 1.5 fingers of dense, white head stuck around for most of the drinking session. Lacing was adequate. Problem is that most examples of the Saison style (and I've had a lot of them) look pretty awesome. So, when rating to style, this impressive looking beer is actually pretty average amongst its peers.  Not a lot going on in the nose. It doesn't smell like an elite Saison. It doesn't even smell like a good Saison. It is all banana and spice and airy biscuit malt. Lots of banana, actually. No funk or phenol or sourness or hoppiness to speak of. If this were given to me in a blind tasting then I would emphatically call ""bullshit"" on its aroma.  I would call ""bullshit"" on its taste, too. This does not taste like a good Saison beer. It is dominated by banana esters. There is some minute funk flavor and a bit of generic malt flavor to inform the banana but that's it. This beer is pretty accessible for what it is. It just isn't a good example of the Saison style.  Solid mouthfeel on the beer, though. It strikes a good balance between the prickly carbonation and having a body size conducive to carrying the flavors that it wants to present. Drinkability suffers from 1.) not being a good example of the style, and 2.) having a large (for the style) ABV%.  Saison is my favorite style of beer. I am very passionate about it. So take this review with a grain of salt; I am a Saison nerd. I haven't tasted Hennepin for a few years until tonight, yet it is just as poor as I remember it being. I can't understand how people think this is a good Saison. if you like this beer then I implore you to check out better examples of the style.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Flavors are full of yeast and light peppered spices and clove. once again missing that wet straw im accustomed to with this one, this particular bottle is kinda dissapointing, if only for the fact i remembered it differantly. The feel doesn't have as poppy a carbination as i would like, or as dry a finish.

42,141,mfunk9786,3.98,"I've had quite a few saisons, mostly ones brewed in America. But as all Ommegang beers are, this is an American-brewed Belgian beer, right down to having been stocked in the foreign section of my local Wegmans. It's going to stay true to the Belgian saison style, which is completely new to me.  A: Beautiful. Quite a bit of frothy white head, and a light yellow hazy body that's to die for. If I could compare it to other saisons I've had, I'd just observe that it's a lot lighter and fluffier than usual.  S: Smells of very sweet Belgian yeast. Quite a bit of zesty, spicy citrus as well. Lovely.  T: Is this what a saison is supposed to be? The only reason I'm giving this category a 3.5 is because I'm rather puzzled by the lack of lemon and pepper character. It tastes like a slightly lemony Belgian pale, it certainly isn't as whizz-bang as some other artisianal American saisons I've had. I don't know if that's a good thing or not, but it's just underwhelming me for the style. Certainly no farmhouse funk that I've become accustomed to with this style, either. Lovely, but rather mild.  M: Light, effervescent carbonation, begins a bit syrupy with a dry finish. A nice substitute for champagne on a special occasion.  D: Very dry, but certainly could drink a couple of 12 oz bottles of these in a night. Not so sure how sessionable it is, considering the sweetness that lingers on the tongue.

42,141,gotweid,4.68,"Poured from the bottle into a flute glass. Beautiful straw, yellow, carmel color with a big, creamy white head. Lacing hung onto the glass all the way down. Smelled like a typical Farmhouse Ale/Saison with it's earthy aroma. The taste was a superb, complex blend of some spice, malt and fruitiness. The mouthfeel is quick with the dry aftertaste that is unique to this style. Incredibly delicous beer. I have to admit I was very pleasantly surprised by what I was drinking. :)",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,haazer,3.71,"Poured into a tulip glass.  A- Thick white head. Lacing left all down the glass. Takes awhile for the bubbles to drop. The appearance of Ommegang in a tulip glass is one to behold. The color reminds me of honey. Very golden, and cloudy. Lots of fiz and carbonation.  S- Yeast, banana's, cloves, and a hint of some spice I cant put my finger on. Before pouring the last bit from the bottle into the glass I smell from the bottle, and detect oranges.  T- Slightest hint of hops, yeast, and the tiniest hint of banana. I'd almost compare the taste to a Franziskaner but more of an alcohol taste(higher abv, duh). I like it but it's very simple, not too complex.  M- Very smooth. Creamy, also refreshing. Tries to be crisp at the end but its too refreshing to be dry.  D- Could drink quite a few of these, although it would eventually catch up and do damage from the abv. Very smooth and refreshing. A simple taste for me, but would definitely try again.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,hopsbreath,2.06,"Poured into an Ommegang tear drop, the beer appears a murky peach color with a massive snow white soapy head. Minimal spotty lacing is apparent. Looks like a typical saison to me.  Smell is heavy on the banana. A little funk and sweet malt round out an under-performing drink.  Taste follows the aroma. Funky banana with a touch of black pepper. Again I'm a little bored.  Mouthfeel is sticky and gummy. I prefer my saisons to be a bit more refreshing.  Not my favorite saison...by far. I think this might be an issue of personal taste. I won't be searching this one out again.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

A great deal of lacing is left behind.  smells very herbal, and citrusy up front, and the Belgian yeast gives off a nice spiciness.  oh man, this tastes incredible. lemony zest up front and the subtle yeast flavors begin to reveal themselves one by one. Very bright and refreshing taste, Nice and tangy. Just a hint of alcohol in the end, but it's well hidden for the most part.  Has a dry mouthfeel, perfect carbonation for a Saison, a light-medium body that is very airy and bright.  Extremely drinkable in warmer weather due to sheer refreshingness.

42,141,ThePorterSorter,4.3,"A perfect pour into my Duvel tulip (according to the website's instructions & expected results) makes for a nice fragrant release from this Saison ""farmhouse"" ale. This is the last beer in my variety 8 pack picked up at the brewery, but I'll be back next summer Ommegang.  Appearance: The beer pours a light honey amber with tiny bubbles of carbonation throughout (in addition plumes of bubbles being sent up from the Duvel ""D"" engraved over the stem). This beer has a nice haze and the bottom yeast sediment went right into the glass (not a bad thing). A tremendous head formed (2+ inches) and there is lacing down the glass. This beer looks inviting.  Smell: A ""rich floral bouquet,"" as stated on the bottle, is released when poured. There are notes from the Belgian yeast as well as a citrusy sweetness followed by what I interpret as...fresh cream. Delicious, it smells incredibly refreshing. I can't wait for when they make this an air freshener scent to hang from my rear-view...minus the ethanol. I believe in Ireland they refer to this as the ""angel's share.""  Taste: This is such a tasty Saison. The beer is apparently blended with ginger and orange, but it would still be quite floral on its own. I started with this beer after warming up from being fridge chilled. As the beer warmed I was able to get a mouthful of what this beer is all about. Crisp and refreshing, smooth to the finish. What more could you ask for with a fading summer and ever present beginning school year?  Mouthfeel: This beer has everlasting carbonation, thanks in part to the bottle conditioning. It has a deliciously refreshing first taste followed-up with a light floral after taste. This beer is not watery at all, which is hard to say given its golden complexion.  Drinkability: Cheers, enjoy this well crafted Saison. Put on some good music and you will have no doubts about why this is Ommegang's best seller. I would definitely enjoy this beer every day of the year, but it's something special when summer is turning into fall and you're surrounded by different pumpkin infusions...but you choose this beer over all of them.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,kellypodz,4.38,"I was only recently introduced to the Saison/Farmhouse variety of ale. Ommegang Hennepin was definitely a wonderful first encounter with the beer. It's light, sparkling, and refreshing. It's not hard to put away a 750 ml bottle of Hennepin.  Hennepin is of a medium bitterness; but is tamed by the sweet malt and citrus tastes. Many jokingly call Saison Ale the breakfast beer due to its grapefruit juice undertones. Champagne and sweet wine lovers could easily be turned on to the brew.  All ales exhibit a certain hoppy aroma. But this Saison radiates ginger and citrus as well. The heavy carbonation delivers the delightful aroma straight to your nose.

42,141,FreshHawk,4.23,"A - Clear golden color with a fair amount of bubble action. Above average sized, foamy, bubbly, sticky, soapy, white head. Pretty good retention  S - Plenty of spices (corriander, clove, pepper, etc.). Fair amount of funk and some tartness. A touch of golden fruit as well with a lot of apple (tart) and a touch of lemon. Some sweet malt and grain in the background. An overtone of herbal and medicinal phenol aroma as well.  T - Starts sweet with some pale and a touch of bready malt taste. Then the spices really come out (see above). Some apple and other golden fruit comes out mid sip, but other than apple they don't last long. Along with the spiciness, a touch of alcohol adds a bit of heat as well. Some sweetness lingers, but so does a good amount of spice. A touch of earthy and herbal hop bitterness comes out toward the end. Some funk and mustiness are also present.  M - Lighter side of medium body with a good amount of carbonation. Fairly smooth going down, but it has a bit of a drying finish.  D - A nice, easy to drink saison. Alcohol is pretty well hidden with just a bit coming out. Pretty good mix of spices, sweetness, and bitter. Quite refreshing.  Notes: Nice saison with a good balance and mix of spice, sweetness and bitterness. Very easy to drink and quite refreshing. Definitely recommend trying this at least once.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Clove and white pear up front, some oddly tripel-ish white pepper then lemon and ginger juice hops, with a butterscotch hit at the end. Prickly finish, tight linger. Light to medium, crisp, dry, none.  No sharp edges! Not too heavy on the yeast or spice, but a bit malty and full for the style. Not sure it deserves the high marks, or if this is just a common intro to Belgians for a lot of people.  Still a very drinkable saison.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

42,141,ToasterChef,4.22,"Poured from a fridge chilled bottle into a Smuttynose pint glass. The beer foams up with a huge pure white head made of medium sized bubbles and a foamy cap. The liquid in this initial pour is perfectly clear, straw colored, and has lots of visible carbonation rising. I know there is yeast at the bottle of this bottle, so later pours may be a bit more hazy.  The aroma is very pleasing. There is Belgian candi sugar providing a slight sweetness. The yeast gives of plenty of pepper, some lemon, and a familiar Belgian mustiness.  This is a good, clean tasting saison. There is enough sweetness to make up the majority of the flavor, but it is well-balanced and doesn't seem to overshadow the other tastes. These include some pale whole grains and peppery spices. The finish has a sharper bite than the rest of the sip, and here there is some evidence of the 7.7% ABV. It's refreshing.  The beer has somewhere a light and medium body. I think it feels heavier because of the sugars and the amount of carbonation. There is a little bit of a coat, but it isn't too sweet and hardly sticky at all.  Everything about this beer leads me to believe that it is highly drinkable. I do not foresee any problems finishing off this 750ml bottle by myself. I except to feel the effects of the ABV by the time I'm finished, but this is the kind of beer to enjoy at home on a warm afternoon/evening. I'd recommend this beer to any fan of the style.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

It also has a good amount of lemon and orange citrus flavor to it. Pretty appealing and refreshing aroma overall.  The taste starts with some of that bright citrus flavors that were found in the nose. In the finish more of the yeast and spice come through with some of that clove like flavor present. A bit of alcohol in the finish but not too bad. It has a nice balance between the spice and the citrus that a lot of versions fail to achieve. It's both refreshing and relatively complex, which I like.  The mouthfeel is on the lighter side with carbonation being high.

First off, getting a lot of alcohol action, but this gets balanced with a sharp ester hop character. A rather sharp finish that is reminiscent of isopropyl alcohol.  M - Sparkling, carbonation is apparent for sure.  D/Notes - One and done (7.7% ABV kind of seals the deal)  This is a real aggressive saison. I can tell it's extremely well-made, as Ommegang doesn't mess around when it comes to making good Belgian beer.

42,141,MasterSki,3.41,"Thanks to Adam for serving up another Saison. Served in an Allagash Cervoise. Best before January 2012.  A - Pours with a voluminous three-plus fingers of white foam that eventually dissipates to a thin cap and leaves behind some stray chunks of lace. Body is a golden straw color, and oddly only one of three three pours had a stream of bubbles.  S - Yeast, esters, some light stone fruit, must, earth, and a bit of soapiness. Alcohol could be better hidden, and this lacks in ""pop"" and intensity, particularly after the Odonata offering.  T - Taste is a little better, as there is less alcohol and spicy ester character. More pale malt, with a bit of lemon, stone fruits, and floral hop character.  M - Carbonation is a bit too zesty and gritty, body is medium and a touch grainy as well. There's a touch of warmth in the finish, and residual stickiness.  D - Meh.

Spices up front - coriander and clove, maybe something else as well - which lead into a strong fruity banana/bubblegum flavor with a lemony presence, followed by a dry bready finish with a hint of hop bitterness. Alcohol is deceptively well-hidden - I didn't realize this was over 7% abv until I looked it up.  M - Had this from a growler that was filled at Brewery Ommegang about a week and a half ago, so I'm not sure how representative this should be of the beer's carbonation. Mouthfeel was good - carbonation drew out the spices without being too strong to destroy the tastes in the middle of the palate. Maybe slightly thin, but that was probably the result of the growler having been filled a week and a half ago.  D - I could drink this all night. It's light enough to not fill me up, but still packs a ton of flavor without leaving an unpleasant aftertaste.  Ommegang got me into craft beer, and this is another great offering from them.

Taste - At first it is somewhat fruity, but a fruit with a sour bitter bang. Less spices are there than what I got off the nose, but they're still evident. I don't taste the citrus that others describe. Leaves a pleasant dry bitterness in the mouth, lingers for a while.  Mouthfeel - Decent. Surprisingly light and smooth considering the amount of carbonation present off of the pour.  Drinkability - Excellent. Finished my 12 oz in no time. A little more bitter than I anticipated but this is a strong brew overall. I've only tried a couple of saisons, so I don't know too much about them.

42,141,twiggamortis420,3.72,"This is the 12 oz 4-pack version with what looks to be a bottled on date of 02/10/10 and a best by 02/12...I like it when both dates are stamped on there, the former much more important than the latter though. Pours a fairly clear, medium yellow color with a rather large-bubbled white head. Much lighter than expected and the foam does not stick around as long as I would like.  Smell is nicely farmhouse with some earthy lemon and yeasty clove/banana aroma. Grassy hops are notable as well as a wheat tang. Nose is quite nice.  Taste is somewhere in between a wit, hefe and saison. Has plenty of yeast esters but not really all that funky or bright like a DuPont. One of the better American renditions for sure, but the malt seems a little sweet and not grainy enough, while the lemon feels more like an American wheat than a saison. Hop bitterness is spot on and provides a nice cleansing on the palate. Tough love I guess, as saisons are one of my favorite styles and tend to grade harder. I like it, but feel like it lacks a bit in personality and farmhouse funkiness. I'd like a yeast with more personality, less sweetness and some more raw grainy aspect.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,BranfordBound,3.91,"Pours a transparent light gold with a giant white head that is fed by a ton of carbonation. Leaves great lacing chunks.  Smells like a saison. Some grassy and floral notes with only a little bit of funk. Tart citrus comes out later.  Tastes like some sweet malt with a big yeast note. Pretty sweet and a spice lingers at the end. Very fruity and when warm there is a slight spice with a bit of alcohol warm. Alcohol is undetectable in the taste, though.  Mouthfeel is a little dry, but nothing excessive, pretty smooth and light bodied.  Drinkability is pretty high, but the ABV is a little high and will hit you before you get tired of the beer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

42,141,dpcoz,4.52,"(Originally reviewed 02/28/2010)  APPEARANCE - Cloudy, Pale, yet the middle of the glass, from top to bottom, it appears to be darker, almost as if a Yuengling was surrounded by a Miller Lite. Pure White head, 1 1/2 fingers up. Carbonated fairly well, bubbles continue to rise to the top  SMELL - Sour, citrus, spice, yeast, alcohol. I think the sour could possibly be some granny smith apples in there.  TASTE - Malty, citrus-acidic, I tend to sense some earthy flavors as well. Maybe even a hint of banana - nothing overpowering or obnoxious, but nice. Slight grapefruit aftertaste, combined with bitterness and dryness.  MOUTHFEEL - Smooth. Carbonation does not interfere with the experience. Definately medium bodied and crisp.  DRINKABILITY - Complex flavors, strength and price make this one a winner. Constructed almost perfectly, delivers powerful product, this was a highly enjoyable experience.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Golden yellow in color with a bit of haze.  S- powerdy yeast and a bit of lemon peel. Mild icing sugar sweetness. Bananas and cloves come out with some time.  T- slightly tart with some lemon upfront that rolls into a full yeasty quality. Mild hits of barnyard and spice, with cloves and cardimon. Wheat and a hint of sweet.  M- mid to light in body with a nice carb that keeps things very lively.  D- its amazingly drinkable and approachable to a noob. Great stuff at a great time.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,rapidsequence,4.45,"750 ml bottle. $8.99 from Neds in Lynchburg (ouch).  Appearance: Slightly hazy yellow. Fantastic head-- Thick and creamy white with infinite retention. Really nice lacing.  Smell: Pears and apples, some florals, spice, a little citrus, and slightly musty/funky Belgian yeast. A little noble hops whiff.  Taste: Slightly sweet fruity esters and a tart bitterness that is both citrusy and hoppy. Yeasty flavor really comes through toward the end and on the finish and is again slightly musty and sourdough bready.  Mouthfeel: This is a rollercoaster on the palate. Initially the high carbonation makes it feel sharp, spritzy, and dry in the mouth. As it goes down it seems to coat the mouth a little bit and feels much bigger, almost creamy. The finish is cleaner, but not overly dry.  Drinkability: This is just a hell of a good beer. It has that ""big beer"" feel, but its still refreshing. Its really good anytime and with almost anything. Look for it in the 12 oz bottles-- not that you cant down a 750 alone, but they're a much better deal.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,pmlondrigan,4.23,"Pours opaque straw gold with a dense, dense puffy white head that eagerly leaves lacing all around the glass. Initially smells like rock candy, and then the more familiar Belgian saison yeast. Fruity and floral with a small amount of farmhouse notes and vanilla. Tastes great, haven't had this in a while. Fruity and sweet with a clean malt bill and mild hop presence, dry but could be plenty more for the style...again there is a vanilla like candy thing going on and I can only imagine it is from the yeast. The more I drink this the more I think that vanilla thing is actually just some phenol type flavor. Wow great mouthfeel, awsome bottle conditioning by ommegang, other than the fact that this beer is almost 8 percent (and you can't tell it is) it is highly drinkable. Love it.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,EgadBananas,4.08,"Hazy straw in color, start white, very predominant head. Had to wait a sec to let it settle to pour the remaining amount.  The smell is citrus and tangy. Faint hops, and a bit of spice.  Most the same with the citrus fruits, spices and hops. A tad boring on the explanation, but it's simple and very well to style.  Feel is light and crisp, with a bit of carbo bite.  Out of the few Saison's I've had, this is definitely the best, which makes me look forward to more of the style.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Duhast500,4.38,Poured from a 750ml bottle into a tulip glass.  The color is a foggy yellow with about two to three fingers of foamy white head and bunch of lacing.  The smell is a bit peppery with a wheat flavor that reminds me of cereal. Some green banana and a little apple flavor seems to be just in sight of my nostrils.  The taste is pretty fruity with some sour apple and a nice peppery spice that goes into a nice clove flavor. Some slight lemon flavor in the back-end as well.  It seems to spin on the tongue and then go down smooth. A well carbonated beer that feels really light going down.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Phelps,4.05,"Looks: pale dandelion, perfectly clear, with a small grayish head like soap film that leaves insignificant trails of lace.  Smells: oooh! Cloves, nutmeg, coriander, some cinnamon, honeysuckle, roses and lavender. Very floral, with the slightest hint of graininess.  Tastes: like a white lifesaver. Lots of cool flavors here: ginger, pineapple, Hibiscus tea. Coriander spiciness mixes with some wonderful tang I can't quite place. If finishes mostly sweet, but with a building dryness as the level of the remaining beer drops.  Feels: crisp. Medium carbonation with a somewhat light and watery body.  Drinks: like summer. The floral nose and enticing spicy flavors really agree with my current palate, and the sweetness of the beer is dialed in perfectly. An unexpected treat from Ommegang.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,gboy515duo,2.63,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass  Pours a yellow, but thick cloudy, body with a thicky and cloudy offwhite lacy head. Smells of malt and not much else. I only knew there were bananas in there because of other reviews, otherwise I would have never picked it up.  Truly tastes like nothing great, just a nice malty beer, but nothing impressive, and something I would never spend 2.75$ for a 12oz bottle on again. This is a beer that is truly underwhelming.  The mouthfeel & drinkability for a 7.7% ABV were the only upsides to this beer. The fact that only a few will get you feeling really good and that it goes down nice with a quick bite make it only slightly worthwhile...  For a brewer who puts out Abbey Ale & Three philosophers, this was extremely disappointing.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,HalfFull,4.12,"Poured into an Ommegang tulip from a corked 750 ml. bottle. A careful first pour yields a pale yellow body with a robust inch of rocky white foam. Cap breaks down slowly and leaves lots of clingy lacing as it does so.  Touch of lemon on the nose with some yeast notes in the background. An intriguing spice nose accompanies. Subtle fruit notes of apple and light pear as well. Much more complex than the draft version for this beer.  Pepper and clove are more prominent in the flavor though they appear on the nose with warming as well. Offers a nice grainy texture with lemon and a subtle almost wheat like quality. Finish is long and smooth with tart lemon and bready yeast. Reveals a tinge of sweetness only as the carbonation settles and otherwise masks the ABV well. A pleasant alcohol warmth is notable on the nose with warming however.  A firm carbonation supports this Saison from start to finish, offering complex yeast and spice notes though less so in the fruit arena. Light and well balanced overall, dry and powdery. And again, a different and superior animal to its draft cousin.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Trapiste389,3.9,"Wonderfull appearance. All rocky and vibrant head and pale effervescent beauty. the smell is dominated by the malt and some alchohol with little to no contribution from the hops. The taste is sweet but not cloying, as it is wonderfully balanced by the mild hop bitterness. there is almost no flavoring hops. Just a little bitterness to keep the sweet maltiness in check. The body is pleasant and satisfying, medium mouthfeel. There is a faint hint of alchohol, but is not too astringent. this beer is very drinkable and goes down very easy. this is interesting scice this is a 7.7% beer ( a litlle to strong for a saison). It is stilla very wonderfullly balanced farmhouse ale that is a very good interpretation on a beloved style.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

A spice note reminiscent of coriander in a witbier mingling with banana, green apple and citrus-like notes.  T- Malty and spicy with the coriander notes mixing prominently with some fruit and a warming alcohol. Also a nice sugary sweetness on the finish.  M/D- Nice, smooth mouthfeel. Very drinkable, though at 7.7% and with a slight alcoholic bite, 2 would probably be enough.  A very nice, rather big saison. Bold flavors and a smooth, fluffy mouthfeel. A perfect summer quencher and a nice change of pace from the typical summer ale offerings. After recently tasting their Three Philosophers quad, I'm really enjoying Brewery Ommegang. Fairly authentic American takes on Belgian ales.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,kirkpjr,4.08,"Poured into a SA Perfect Pint glass.  A: Pours a huge, fizzy, billowing head that barely holds to not drip down the sides of the glass. The head hangs around for quite a bit, leaving spotted lacing. Slightly hazy and light golden yellow in appearance.  S: Bananas, cloves, and Belgian yeast. A little earthy and slightly spicy.  T: Crisp flavors accentuate everything brought out in the smell. Lemon zest and a little orange peel also present - bringing a little tartness out.  M: High carbonation and medium to light body. Very crisp and refreshing. Lemon and Belgian yeast leave a clean aftertaste.  D: Carbonation limits the drinkability here, but altogether a great summer beer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

In no particular order: honey, hops, a wedge of lemon, a slice of green apple, peppery, and citrusy while maintaing a light funk and earthy dimension. Hops start to get herbal-like and grassy after a while. Malts are sweet and biscuity  M: feels like a million. Lighter body with ample carbonation, the tickling kind.

42,141,checkfeet,4.5,"Poured from a 1 pint bottle into a Bordeaux glass.  Appearance is lovely - a warm golden yellow like rapeseed honey - with a thick poofy crown of white head on top, though this, along with any lacing, dissipates significantly as you drink. Heavy carbonation rises from the bottom of the glass through the cloudy remnants of yeast.  The nose is so inviting; not at all overwhelming but teasing with scents of sour apples, lemongrass, grapes, coriander and that special Belgian yeastiness that makes one think of a summer day on the farm.  The taste lives up to the nose with a subtle explosion of sour apples and citrus with just the right kick of tang and hops on your tongue. The ever-so-slightly sour flavor is perfectly accentuated by the carbonation giving a very pleasant mouthfeel that is light and airy but with enough substance to keep reminding you how delicious it is long after your glass is empty.  This beer is so well-balanced, I could easily finish one bottle and go back for more. A wonderful interpretation of the style.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Leaves superb lacing after each sip and a persistent pool of fluff in the center of the chalice.  S - Belgian yeasts and citrus.  T - Citrusy and peppery up front, with a bit of boozy alcohol in the middle. Belgian yeast esters and flavors abound. Coriander and herby/spicy flavors dance around the palate. The finish is mineral-like and more bitter than I expected from a Belgian. The flavor sticks around for a long time in my mouth.  M - a bit of a light body with a mouth-coating effect. Carbonation is roughly average.  D - the body makes this quite drinkable, though I do notice the 7.7% alcohol.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

This Beer is an excellent interpretation of the style, that can actually go toe to toe with some of the belgian saisons. I'm not saying it is the best, but it clearly holds its own.  I consider this beer very well rounded. It is strong, without overtly tasting like alcohol it warms nicely on the way down. It has a sweetness to it, but is nicely balanced with a hoppy bite. The flavor has a bit of straw, citrus and spice to it and the carbonation is strong, but it retains a smooth feeling in the mouth. A sipper for sure, but this remains one I could sip all night.  I consider this the best of Ommegang's offerings. It is a very strong showing for American Brewers doing the Belgian thing. An added plus is that this beer is easy to come by in the states (north east at least) and is a fraction of the price of some of its Belgian counterparts.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

It poured well with a good head that slowly faded, it had mellow cloudy yellow underneath it, with bubbles rising and falling.  S: I get some mild citrus and mellow fruits.  T: The citrus is there, but in the far back of the taste. It is more of the mellow fruits: mango, banana, and clove/coriander for the slightly spicy after taste.

42,141,Pittsburgh,4.4,"I hate to do comparisons, but this tastes almost the same as Saison Dupont for me, I will have to compare side by side but they are very similar. Hennepin is a bit less yeasty, and a little stronger and bitter IMO. But many people, myself included could probably not tell the difference side by side. Still, a very good offering for sure, the did a great job with it, not sure if they were trying to clone SD, but it is a solid beer regardless.  Light golden yellow pour, great foam, that reduces to a little foam pile and eventually a thin layer lining the top.  Smells excellent, of yeast and lemon.  Nice, light, fluffy, yeasty, and lemon flavored. Very smooth, has a bit of a tart/bitter flavor finishing it off, and that is the big distinction for me in this beer.  Overall, very good, I love SD so I love this by default, but for my money I'd probably choose SD bc it's cheaper. Just being honest. Still very good. Perhaps if they tried undercutting SD they may sell more.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,lovindahops,4.35,"I am pretty stoked to try this legendary brew that lies a lil' east of Syracuse. Poured into a tulip glass  A- a beautiful hazed yellow that has a substantial head resting above the brew. The head is fluffed up with lacing wrapping around the side. The color is a classic saison straw yellow look  S- a musty lemon scent that looks in all the aspects of a saison. Spices, bananas, and butter overlap the initial farmhouse yeast in the end. The flavors all balance together and really develop a flagship style  T- fresh lemons clash with the patented farmhouse funk to give a flavorful taste. The taste of clove of spices almost trickle over the top of the brew's properties. It's really a great combination of flavors meant to exemplify a taste profile  M- light and carbonated. It helps keep the flavor going  D- this is my frst brewery Ommegang tasting and I am impressed. Hennepin is such a detailed crafting of the saison style that is ridicuously enjoyable.

42,141,mintjellie,4.41,"Fairly long pour needs to be done in two stages. The first attempt results in a massive rocky white head that takes its time subsiding before I can continue. Haziness lends a bit of depth to its pale straw hue. Nice lace. Very pretty looking beer. Creamy mashed banana aroma; peppery, medicinal phenolics; and floral hops. I get a whiff of lemon and hay in the background. Lots of over-ripe banana in the flavour too, also quite peppery with a little bit of lemony tartness. Musty and earthy, when it gets close to room temperature. Noble hops and a mildly bitter finish. Medium bodied with a enough carbonation to keep it feeling light in the mouth. Has a little bit of warmth from the alcohol. Just a little. You barely notice it's there. Very approachable and easy drinking. I found myself having to consciously think about pacing myself as I drank it.

Compared to the Fantome my wife and I just finished, it seems quite pedestrian, but I know that's not fair. Hennepin Saison is a true example of quiet greatness. It is a well put together, refreshing, and tasty treat that screams for a cheese plate or salad.

Appearance- Pours a straw golden with a slight haze to it off the tap. About a finger and a half of creamy white head sits on top. Dies back gradually to a thin, patchy sheet.  Smell- Smells strongly of yeast with a slight fruitiness and a bit of fresh bread.  Taste- Again, starts off with a slightly fruity/yeasty quality. A touch of cereal graininess and an almost spicy, dry finish.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Mouthfeel slick and adequate with good carbonation.

42,141,jmerloni,4.31,"A - A nice crisp yellow that has a hazy tornado of unfiltered yeast in the middle. The head on this beer is absolutely ludicrous. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. One of the longest pours I've ever had to deal with. Probably about a 7 minute pour. And sticky as fuck too.  S - Very nice. Honey, spice, flowers. Earthy. Yeast. Bread. Interesting.  T - Very rich. Floral, grass, honey, coriander. Impressive taste. Strong.  M - Light to medium bodied. Looks lighter than it is. Carbonation is appropriate. Nice finish.  D - More drinkable than most saisons. As rich but not as filling as most saisons. Typically one or two saisons is the most you can drink. I could probably drink the full 4 pack of these. This is a REALLY solid brew. Best saison I've had and that says something because I'm a big fan of saisons, even in my young days of beer drinking. Stellar as ever, and another fantastic release from Ommegang - one of my 5 favorites breweries in the country. Will be getting this again.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Smixam,4.2,"Bottle into a tulip.  A - Pours a hazy straw yellow with a reasonable pure white head. Strong lacing that really hangs around.  S - Strong fruit (banana, hint of citrus) with a welcome - if muted - floral hoppiness, and beyond that just a general sense of fresh flowers. Really interesting.  T - Fruit comes on at the start and remains throughout, the same banana and lemon/citrus. I feel like theres some sort of spice in here that I can't quite put my finger on - not hot but just a zestiness. Mild to moderate hop bitterness on the finish but it doesn't linger too long.  M - Surprising amount of carbonation but a generally light mouthfeel. Not a huge amount of aftertaste, but the alcohol content comes through at the end.  D - Reasonably light for what it is. I don't think I'd want to session something as worthy as this anyway, but I could certainly put away a few pints before the moderate ABV catches up to me.  Overall, a great warm weather beer and a nice way for someone who hasn't traditionally been a fan of the style to jump in. OK, it's not a ""real"" Belgian in the same way a Padron Anniversario 1964 isn't a ""real"" Cuban...but in the end, do you really care?

Also a little bit of sweetness to the smell.  T - Taste is similar to the smell. This beer has some sweetness and wheat on the front with clove and spices in the middle. Has more spicy bitterness along with an alcohol bite at the end. Spice is a little stronger than I prefer in a saison, but otherwise still good.  M - Lighter bodied smooth with moderate amount of carbonation. Has a nice crisp refreshing feel to the body.  D - Easy to drink and hides the ABV pretty well.

42,141,aquaphiliac,4.45,"This is my first beer of the style.  A: Light, golden color. Brighter (almost luminescent) than a pilsner. Large, fluffy head that overflows out of my 22oz glass.  S: Floral scent, Citrus fruits; very pleasant overall.  T: The citrus taste mirrors the smell, it has a kind of richness that I can't really place. Takes a little bit to get into the taste, maybe because this is my first saison but about halfway through the beer I was like ""wow."" Very very tasty.  M: Seems light at first but as stated above there is a certain richness to it. Excellent palate experience.  D: I found myself getting a little full at the end of this glass, but very satisfying. 7.7% abv is invisible.  Extremely happy with how this turned out. At $9.49/4 pk it's not a steal, but well worth it.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,sweemzander,4.63,"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip. No bottled date found.  (A)- Pours a hazy golden yellow color that produced a massive pure white fluffy head with great retention behind it. It left sticky lacing all over the place as it finally dissipated. There was still some foam left even with the last sip.  (S)- A floral aroma that turns quickly to a hay/clay/barnyard funk. Bits of lemon, banana, and yeast dryness. An earthy profile yet fresh with fruits.  (T)- Very similar to the smell. Has a bigger banana/lemon creaminess to it that fits nicely with the earthy yet dry funk of hay/barnyard background.  (M)- A lively carbonation level that fizzes up on the tongue. Has a crisp and refreshing feel to it. Not overly bitter, sweet, or dry; yet it has a little bit of each creating a nice harmonious balance. A playful complexity that keeps you guessing.  (D)- A wonderful Saison. Granted, this is not a true belgain; but its one of the best American-made of the style. One of my most favorite summer beers to enjoy. It is crisp and refreshing. A great example of the style. One of Ommegang's best offerings in my opinion.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Bouleboubier,4.6,"This is the way to go if you want Hennepin.  Whereas when I encountered a strong phenolic aroma and taste in the bottle version, on draft (in this case, from a growler), what was so up front and mildly distracting/detracting was now much mellower - mellower to the point where now it blended into the entire makeup of the beer so wonderfully.  Even keeping the growler top unlatched while we drank it (why? I don't know why), it poured with a huge, fluffy, crystalline or cotton candy-like head. The color was a deeper orange compared to the bottle - a cantaloupe shade.  Before, where the phenols were kicking more, now the spice and an apricot taste highlight the flavor. Hints of freshly-cut hay are still present.  The feel and drinkability are amazing. Like freshly-squeezed orange juice. Hard (as in cider) but not entirely soft in the finish. Slowly warms you up and mellows you out. Wonderful.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

D - Very drinkable, very refreshing. This beer is gonna make me re-evaluate the style...",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Epicedion,4.73,"750mL bottle poured into a Chimay goblet  A: A golden glow, as if from some inner light. It pours with a poofy head that settles down to a thin coating after a long while.  S: Spicy. A little musty, but that gives way to bright and sharp very quickly.  T: The beer is immediately sweet, spicy, and bitter. It all hits the palate at the same time and then fights it out through the finish. This beer is like a train wreck of great flavors, all smashing together with wonderful results. The finish is long, with sweet giving way to bitter giving way to spicy, finally giving way to a lightly sour lemon flavor.  M: Prickly carbonation that lasts all the way to the end, combined with a medium-bodied beer makes this a perfect mouthfeel.  D: This beer is perfect for drinking while cooking on the grill in the middle of summer after mowing the lawn and playing fetch with the dog. It's perfect for drinking on a cool night. The alcohol content is low enough to make this a beer you can sip all night, and everything about it is enough to make you want to sip it all night.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

42,141,babywhooper,4.31,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into Duvel chalice...  A - Beer pours a very deep yelllow, almost opaque, with a hint of orange to it. The head is very nice as well. About two fingers, and very sticky. The beer looks great.  S - Very aromatic beer. I get a lot of citrus and a little banana, as the poster below me said. Get a sort of ""sour"" or tangy hint in the smell, but not in a bad way.  T - Very subtle fruit or citrus taste, contrasting the smell, but the taste gives a lot of spice. Also a sour taste to the beer, but I think that only enhances the back end of the taste.  M - Mouthfeel is very smooth. Very easy to go down as well.  D - While this beer is 7.7% abv, it does go down rather effortlessly. But, I think the spiciness can become overwhelming after a few. Even so, this is a beer that can definitely call for more than one round.  This is an excellent beer, and deserves all the high praise it receives. Looks great, and exceptionally tasty.

A: cloudy yellow-orange with a golden/amber tinge, two fingers of bubbly white froth, and globs of lacing on the shaker (wrong glassware, I know). S & T: yeasty and nutty aromas, strong citrus and lemon flavours, fruity tanginess, a little sour. This lacks the brett elements of a traditional saison, but it's a delicious beer nonetheless. M: huge peppery spiciness in the body, super tart and dry finish. Packs an impressive, refreshing bite. Very good. D: goes down like a glass of lemonade on a hot summer day. This drinks way too easy for a 7.7% brew. Maybe it's the 30+ degree weather in Daytona? Either way, Hennepin is a satisfying Belgian-style ale.

42,141,Beerenauslese,4.5,"First pour of the bottle is clear gold with an ample head that lasts, leaving considerable lacing. On the second pour, I kept most of the sediment in the bottle, but it looks a little cloudier.  Spicy aroma with notes of straw, sweet corn, ginger, coriander, fruit, and sugar.  Tastes of sweet malt and fruit--especially pineapple maybe some banana, and spicy with notes of ginger, clove, coriander. A saison with a tripel structure, more Belgian than French. Not pronounced hoppy.  Medium in body with good carbonation makes this really creamy, and while on the sweet side, it finishes light and dry.  This is one of my favorite saisons and I drink it regularly. Interesting flavors and moderate alcohol level does the trick for me. Never have a problem finishing a 750 ml bottle.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Big fluffy full white head that slowly diminishes to a thick sticky lace.  S--Tangy honey scent at the nose with a peppery phenolic kick.  T--Very winey honey taste at the start with a nice acidic nose. The finish has some floral notes with hints of pepper, grass, citrus, and earth. Beautifully complex.  M--Medium bodied with perfect carbonation which complements the acidic bite in the taste.  D--7.7% so not a session beer, but I could drink this all day. Just perfect anytime of year.

Good head retention and a nice lacing down the side of the glass.  S: Huge scent of clove and nutmeg. A little funky and yeasty. Some lemon and banana smells. A little hint of the alcohol in the nose. A slightly tart odor too.  T: The taste lives up to the nose with regards to the clove and citric hop flavors up front. Slightly sweet, but mostly tart and a little funky. Finishes pretty clean with a very subtle hint of malt, but not much at all. The alcohol is not really able to be tasted in the beer.

Has an aromatically pleasing and promising mix of lemon, candy sweetness, dacetyls and spice. Slight notes of grass and musty Belgian yeasts follow at the end. Tastes lemony, sweet and spicy with a citrus hop wrapping and a butterscotch and sourdough middle.  Goes down creamy at first but becomes a bit more crisp with time.

Carbonation rises from the bottom vigorously.  S: Has some funk, but is overpowered with biscuity, honeyed malt notes. Floral, fruity tones linger, with hints of banana and citrus.  T: Flavors are complex, with notes of biscuity malt, banana, and lemon peel. Grassy, floral hop notes lend the beer a dry, fruity finish. Yeast plays a part in the flavor, imparting hints of more fruit and just a touch of funk.  M: Light bodied, yet has enough comlexity to give the beer a long finish. Slightly slick mouthfeel.

42,141,Slatetank,4.35,"I had this on tap at the Mt Hope brewfest -served chilled in a taster, had a few to enjoy over the coarse of the afternoon while strolling around  A - A mildly hazed golden similar to apple juice or pear nectar w/ 2 fingers of cream that is snow white. The lace clings in a film and the bead is tiny  S - A smell the reminds of fresh ripe pear and some granny smith/golden apple notes w/ slight funky and earthy vegetal aroma w/ mild spicy herbal hop and a mild sweet aroma from the malt which is accented by more yeast which has a light white grape odor. The fragrant brew has plenty of complexity  M - I like how the feel has some tartness and light earthy peppery qualities and still has enough fruit and mild sweetness to comje off as refreshing with a high level of carbonation and mild tart almost lemony sour aspects. The finish is dry and light toasted in texture  T - The flavor of Hennepin is smooth, and brisk w/ light fruitiness and lots of yeast tartness which brings to mind grapeskin, lemon peel and the malt has a light toasted grain note w/ mild spice again from the yeast and slight alcohol influence. There is a mellow astringent note and hint of pear and hop in the finish which has a refreshing dry taste  D - I enjoy this beer a bit more in the bottle but this was great on a warm spring day - it was made for it with crisp full flavor and I was sincerely glad I got to try it again on tap",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Hazy yellow-gold with a chunky head which almost pulled away from the sides of the glass and became like a white mountainous island in the center. Bitter orange and crystalized ginger on the nose with a small amounts of barnyard going on.  Flavors are dominated by citrus sweet and sour, however my first reaction was something distinctly Caribbean.For me this can typically mean spiced rum or coconuts but after a bit more exploration I realized it was a very noticable plantain flavor. Keeping with the Caribbean theme (which is very subtle)there is a creaminess which combined with the pineapple flavor reminds me of a classic pina colada. Despite the appearance of a creamy texture there is a Champagne-like sharpness which makes this Saison extremely dry and refreshing.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,TCHopCraver,4.3,"Reviewed from notes on 5/7/10. Damn, I need to get off my butt and get the internet in my new place. I believe this is my first Saison.  A: Pours the color of a golden raisin into my snifter. The head is an impressive, foamy, 2.5 fingers, is colored off-white and has excellent retention. The lacing is clingy and pleasing to the eye. Copious small bubbles rush in straight lines from the bottom of the glass upward.  S: Fruity and spicy. Concord grape, pear, golden apple and raisin aromas mix with clove and peper to establish a deliciously enticing primer for my mouth. I also detect some spicy and earth hop character as well.  T: A tartness bordering on sour that I did not encounter in the smell is the driving force in the flavor. A lot of clove flavor is also prevalent; this perhaps overbalances the the crisp fruit flavors that I enjoyed in the smell. There is a fine malt to hop balance. I can pinpoint the golden malt carrying the beer after the tart fruit and clove flavors settle, followed by the bittering hops taking the lead and leaving a dry and spicy residue on my tongue.  M: Hennepin is so crisp and refreshing to my mouth, and at the same time it has a pretty creamy and full body. I would adore this beer on a 95 degree, dry Napa Valley day. This beer makes me wish that I had been sufficiently turned on to the craft beer scene when I lived there, because I can taste this in my mouth when I reminisce about sitting on the back porch overlooking a vineyard.  D: This is extremely drinkable. I would certainly have another and will make a point to seek this out when it is as hot as the Devil's Oven in the middle of the Michigan summer. This beer makes me excited to try many more Saisons.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Very faint funk. Altogether pleasant, not overdone. I'd actually like the aroma as an air freshener.  Lots of light fruit flavours to taste, melon and citrus again. Quite a bit of floweriness to the hops. Solid impression of lemon right in the middle. Good balance. Touch of funky yeast, just to remind you of the style. Very tasty.

42,141,PapaGemutlich,3.62,"I will not be bullied into liking this.  It's fine. I poured from a chilled 750 ml into a pint glass. The pour was lively, color wheat gold, and the head a solid, persistent white. Good quality aromatic hops impart a clean straw bouquet.  Drinking, though, seemed off balance to me. The high alcohol and phenols seemed over-assertive, out of balance with what should be a bright, summertime quaff.  This is my first from Brewery Ommegang.

The lacing is nice, but not the best I've seen.  There is a definite skunk funk in the scent. Lemon and orange citrus shine through the skunk. There is also a sense of wheat in the smell.  A slight fruity note starts out the taste which gives way to a heavy dose of yeasty malts. The aftertaste is a bit buttery and pairs with some sourness.  There is plenty of carbonation and light mouthfeel. The finish is very clean and leaves me ready for more.  This is very very drinkable. I enjoy the refreshing aspect of this beer.

T- A lot of throaty flavors that follow the nose, with an almost creamy backbone. Sweet, and very citrusy, very refreshing, and very bold.  M- Light but sharply carbonated.

S: Smells strongly of wheat and less strongly of light fruits...maybe apricot? Faint spice.  T: Oh. Wow. One of the spiciest beers I've ever reviewed. I'm going to need a little while to figure this one out. Let's see...Black pepper. Cloves. Carbonation. After a few sips, strong citrus notes emerge. Late into the flavour I detect some nuttiness which disappears after I swallow. Aftertaste is slightly bitter, slightly grassy, mildly pleasant.  M: It's a bit of a kick at first, but moderates into a gentler, medium light mouthfeel.  D: The alcohol isn't hidden as well as I anticipated and the sheer complexity of this beer makes it almost a chore to drink.

Smells of medium fruits - green apples and pears - backed by light malts and large amounts of peppery spices.  Tastes similar to how it smells. Crisp light malt flavors kick things off and are joined quickly by sweet green apple and lighter pear and apricot flavors. Midway through the sip peppery spices make an appearance, carrying through to a mildly bitter ending, leaving grassy notes lingering on the palate.  Mouthfeel is good. It's got a nice thickness with moderate carbonation.  Drinkability is very good. I finished my glass quickly and could easily have a few more.  Overall there's nothing exceptional about this beer except how well all the flavors complement each other.

Taste: Flavors of citrus and stone fruits, yeast and malt are crisp and bold with notes of apricot, orange, and a slight bitter hop finish. Mouthfeel: Light to medium body with adequate carbonation that offers a crispness to this medium bodied Saison. Drinkability: Very drinkable for some, an acquired taste for others.

Malty with hints of pineapple and a slightly sour finish.  M: Carbonation is champagne-like and typical for the style. The sweet finish gives the illusion of a thick brew, but Hennepin is actually quite silky and lite.  D: Hennepin is a very nice American interpretation of a Belgian Saison, and hides the 7.7% alcohol extremely well. I'm not sure I'd want to drink a second 750, but it is a very refreshing dinner beer. I made moules frites tonight and used 6 oz or so of the Hennepin to steam the mussels; beautiful pairing.

42,141,akorsak,5,"A growler filled at Al's of Hampden on 23-Apr-10. Hennepin is on record as being my favorite. It was also in the running for my newborn daughter's middle name (although it wasn't the winner).  A: The saison is crystal clear, a pale golden straw color that radiates. If I didn't know any better, I'd call it a pale lager due to the hue. A full head, over 2 fingers, is lacing in thick clumps.  S: The nose is refreshingly sharp, hoppy with a fresh dose of Belgian yeast. Mild fruitiness and black pepper jump out, both subtle but unmistakable. Grapes (white, of course) and a teaspoon of funk round out the nose, alongside a brief earthy hop aroma.  T: Each sip is deliciously sweet, lightened up by fleshy fruits (think pears, peaches, apples). A dose of anise follows the fruit, a dry sharp contrast to the sugary fruit. Coriander adds a black pepper flavor, a bite against the sweetness. Throughout, the saison is light and refreshing. Clove and pear appear near the finish. Near the end of the growler, the carbonation tapers off, allowing the fruits to linger much longer than normally.  M: The mouthfeel is sweet, with a heavy dose of yeasty fruits. Hops linger around but never get in the way of the pale fruits.  D: The ale nails every aspect, sweet and dry, sharp but lush.

Taste: All though it was better than i expected given the smell, I was far from impressed by the taste of it. I felt that it was a stronger version of a cheap main stream beer. Mouthfeel: It wasn't anything special from the other beers that I have had. Pretty typical Drinkability: It is easy enough to drink that I will be able to continue drinking what I have of it, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it again. Given the high reviews that I have seen of this beer I was expecting it to be much more flavorful than it ended up being. Although it is a nice beer, it was a bit of a let down when it came to flavor.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Gotta pour this one really slow.  S: A little tart and sour, yeasty. White grape juice?  T: Candied green apples, with a a little yeast spice, clove maybe? Good balance of tart and sweetness and a touch of herbal spice. A little bit of hop bitterness at the end. Many layers of flavor in this one. Tastes very fresh and crisp, refreshing.  M/D: Light to medium. Lots of carbonation. Feels a little smooth. Pretty good drinkability. A great summer/spring night beer.  I can definitely see why this is so well liked.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Great head retention and nice, sticky lace all over. Replenishing carbonation comes from the bottom.  Smell: Tart aroma has a hint of white grape, honey, cloves, and coriander. Alcohol has a slight presence.  Taste: Very mild sweetness. Malt is simple, dry, and biscuity. Grassy and earthy flavors. Slight alcohol kick toward the end, although it is generally masked rather well. An oily residue accompanies the slightly tart finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium body, above average carbonation. Slightly dry. Very smooth.  Drinkability: The smooth transitions and robust elegance of Hennepin make it a drinkable model brew for the category.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,dasenebler,4.23,"From a 12ozer bottled 9/09, this Saison pours a highly effervescent and hazy pale gold, with a fantastic head that rises a full inch out of my tulip glass in a volcanic shape.  Aroma is very nice. Tart, with hints of vanilla and clove.  This beer tastes as though it could have come from Belgium, although the bitterness and hop flavor lend an American twist. The overall flavor is very well-balanced and layered. At first there's a candy-like sweetness and clove flavor that is countered by a touch of tart and funk, and a good bit of earthy, bitter hops on the finish. Malt character is cookie- or cake-like. The alcohol is noticeable, but it adds to the dry, refreshing nature of this Saison. The mouthfeel was good, with champagne-like carbonation providing some creaminess and body to this somewhat thin Saison.  This is truly a great Belgian-style ale brewed right here in the Northeast. Excellent value as well.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,meatyard,4.3,"Pours a nearly clear, golden yellow with considerable, visible carbonation. The head forms to about 1"", is fairly dense & fluffy. The smell is bready yeast, lemon and there is the bit of clove smell following. The taste starts off with some spiciness including a stronger clove taste than in the aroma. What follows is some of the yeast and lemon and also an earthy flavor. At some point in the middle I get a bit of funk. There is a bit of sweetness but not much, especially as it warms. Mouthfeel is sort of on the light side but it feels right and there is moderate carbonation until the end of the bottle. It's on the dry side too. Drinkability: Very good. There is a lot happening in this fine Saison. It's been a few years since I've had one so I'm glad I picked this up.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Skunk! after it pours, luckily, that aroma goes to the background and in its place is plenty of pepper, yeast, lemon, funk, sour apple, tropical fruit (banana, starfruit, mango).  taste is yeasty, fruity, peppery. starts off with a lot of pepper, a bit of lemon, banana, and clove which gives way to nutty, bready malts and some herbal, spicy hops before the pepper again takes over and along with the bread, stays on the palate. there is a funky must that stays from start to finish.  medium-bodied, creamy and bubbly. spiciness really attacks the tongue.  goes down well, definitely true to the style.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,jeffthecheff,4.2,"Served in a chilled Hennepin stemmed glass. It hpouts a bright gold color with a medium amount of haze. Creamy white foam forms up about an inch at first and then recedes to a nice thin cap on top.  The aroma is fresh and yeasty, and reminds me more of a wit than the other Saisons I have had. Fresh orange peel, some spices, and a floral, lavender like smell.  The flavors are light, with a very dry and bitter finish. The finish is so dry it doesn't leave much of a lingering flavor, just a bitter sensation. Up front is a simple malt sweetness with some hay, spice, and citrus.  Mouthfeel is dry as I can imagine with ample carbonation. This was a great, refreshing beer for outside on a hot day. Not sessionable, but certainly quaffable.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

S: There are pleasant floral aromas of hops and yeast with along some hints of citrus and spices. T: The overall flavors are slightly hoppy and earthy, although they are well balanced by the underlying malts. The finish is a bit bitter, but not by much, and some notes of spices are evident. M: The mouthfeel is very refreshing and crisp; the level of carbonation makes it feel light on the palate (like champagne), but definitely not without flavor. D: This goes down smoothly and easy to drink, even on a hot summer day. I could coast through a bottle quick but I don't think I would have more than one of these given the alcohol content.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Flashsp2,4.35,"Hennepin 750 into Duvel tulip  Pours a slightly hazed gold with a giant fluffy eggshell head that fades away very slowly, leaving behind chunky lace.  The fruity and yeasty aroma is present from a good foot away. Lots of light, juicy fruit presence. And a big, dry, Belgian yeast is also very prominent. Spice, yellow pears, a hint of alcohol, granny smith apple peel, bright citrus.  Taste starts of big and juicy with lots of bright fruit and finishes with a dry yeast bite, with some tangy hop bitterness after the finish. Bready, soft pale malt sweetness, earthy/leafy hop, white grape skins, ground white pepper, sour cherry, alcohol spice, lemon zest.  Light to medium body with a brisk carbonation, proper for the style. Seems a bit watery at times, but not enough to ruin it at all. This is probably the only 'lackluster' point of the beer, if you want to call it that. It's certainly not terrible, but just keeps it from being an 'A' beer.  Such an easily appreciated beer, at a great price, and that can be offered to those not in-the-know. A lovely beer that I far too often overlook, despite having offered it many a time during a weekly beer tasting at the liquor establishment where I was previously employed.

T= Upfront straw, barnyard, and a slight hint of horse blanket followed by a light fruity sweetness that fades into a dry straw finish.  F= Lively feel with a high carbonation.  D= Non-session beer for sure. It hides its somewhat high abv all day long. Easily enjoyed during many different seasons of the year and goes great with spicy food.

Some definite hints of apple and pear and some citrus.  Taste mirrors the smell with a lot of fruit upfront, pear, apple, and lemon all quite notcieable, a little banana and cinnamon in there as well. The spices are very nice, cloves and pepper from start to finish it seems, very lightly hoppy in the finish, all in all very refreshing.  Crisp, clean mouthfeel.

Good retention - keeps a nice layer of foam for almost the entire life of the glass. Plenty of retention. Looks great.  Dense, fruity and slightly funky smell. Apples, cloves, little bits of banana, earthy 'dirt', little bits of orange & lemon peel, other florals, and a bit of the noble hop character.  Fantastic beer. Well balanced, great depth and layering of flavor. Creamy and light from the carbonation. Begins with hints of crisp apples and fresh barley malt. Floral characters float over the malt backbone with introduction of earth and acidity. The beer finishes with a long aftertaste of carbonation and noble hops to give a clean, dry finish. Incredibly well balanced, incredibly well done. Bravo.  Excellent Saison, excellent beer. One that I should have more of.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,epicness,4.68,"A - Very bright golden color. I'm using the Duvel Tulip Glass, and I don't know if this is directly related to the glass itself, but theres a single file stream of bubbles in the middle of the glass just rising continuously. Pretty neat looking. Pretty cloudy with a large frothy, white head. Very sticky lacing is left on the side of the glass if I give a little swirl.  S - I've never had a Saison before so I wasn't really sure what I was getting into, but the smell was totally not what I expected. Almost smells like a Witbier. There's lots of similar characteristics. It's heavy on coriander and lemon. The smoothness of clove is present. It's also a little spicy and if I'm correctly identifying it, it almost smells like ginger is in there.  T - With the initial taste it was very sweet in the front and very dry bready taste on the back end. Based on the smell, I would have to say the taste is a lot spicier than I anticipated, although that's not a bad thing. It's a good spicy taste. Spices and citrus definitely dominate the overall taste of the beer though. Honestly, it almost has this sour taste to it.. like a green apple sour taste. I definitely like it. That taste seems to be hanging around in the aftertaste.  M - Good carbonation on the tongue, yet so extremely crisp and refreshing at the same time. Light bodied.  D - I type pretty fast to give you an idea of things... and while typing this review I've killed off the entire beer except for a mouthful without really realizing it. I can't get enough of this beer. Very high drinkability obviously... well until the near 8% ABV sneaks up on me. Cheers.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

It's a good beer to drink on a hot summer day, but I can think of many others I'd rather drink in its place. That's just my opinion.

42,141,Bolendak,3.16,"My brother bought me a 1 pint 9 oz bottle of Ommegang Hennepin and I decided to pop the cork after a couple weeks of staring at it in the fridge.  Appearance - it really looked like i was pouring a glass of bud light. it was a light yellowish gold color with a good amount of head. it even smelled like bud light or something you would find in the dixie cups of a beer pong playing college student.  Smell - again, it really smelled like a light beer, perhaps bud or maybe even coors or miller, they're all the same to me.  Taste - after lifting the glass and actually sampling this beer, it did, in fact, taste a lot like bud light. However, there wasn't such a harsh or bitter aftertaste. The aftertaste was similar to Heineken or some other hoppy lager. I did not enjoy the bubbly carbonated light beer taste, but the sweet aftertaste was a relief.  Mouthfeel - It was extraordinarily easy to drink. I could chug this for days without my eyes watering. The carbonation was a little much, and I would have liked it to be a little heavier.  Drinkability - again, very much like a light beer. While I enjoyed drinking it, I was let down by my expectations, come on Ommegange, you can do better.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Lars3,4.01,"75dL bottle into an Ommegang holiday pack glass.  This beer was so pretty that I had to stop and take a picture. A beautiful translucent golden color with a billowing white head. The lacing never ends.  This been smells like getting drunk on the bank of the Seine. Or at least that is what my brain is telling me. I don't drink many Saisons, but my first were consumed on a trip to Paris with some buddies. If I was in the fragrance business creating a cologne that smelled like this would be priority number one. The actual scent is grassy with hints of green apples, and maybe a little alcohol underneath.  Very tart, but I wouldn't say sour. It is a light tasting beer. All the scents that I picked up are also present in the taste. My mouth feels clean after each sip. I could probably drink more than a .75L bottle of this is given the opportunity.  Hennepin is light on the tongue, but the tartness makes my mouth want to pucker a bit. The smell, but prolific, bubbles feel great from the time they touch my lips to the moment they drain down my throat.  The 7.7% abv is what prevents this beer from being a 4 or even 4.5 in drinkability. This beer is easy to drink and not too hard of the wallet, but I'm a light-weight and I always will be so drinking too much of a 7.7% beer is just out of the question for me.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

The fact that I get a lot of aroma from this beer says something since my sense of smell lacks a bit.  T: Champagne, sour, this is a beer that I feel is the benchmark for the style. This is a superb summer beer with a bright, fresh taste that leaves the mouth feeling like you just ate a garden salad with some green apples and a light vinaigrette.  M: The prevalence of green apple taste made me think that I would have the aftertaste in my mouth that I get from green apples, but I absolutely do not. This beer gently rolls off the tongue and leaves me feeling light and fresh.  D: I love this beer. I need to go buy more.

Strong spiciness upfront intermixed with horse blanket, yeast, and lemon scents. A little grassy as well.  Like the nose, spice is readily noticeable upfront and it tastes a lot like cinnamon. The sweetness is light and biscuity, possibly some honey, and I detect some cooked pear as well. Straw and light lemony citrus flavors pervade as well, along with a clean and musty overall taste. There is some faint alcohol on the breath, and the bittering hops perfectly balance the malt as they explode and then tingle on the tongue briefly.  Effervescent, light bodied, and highly carbonated.

42,141,SLeffler27,3.9,"A huge fine white head rises four fingers over a light, hazy, pale brass beer. The carbonation mesmerizes as it swirls ever upward. With time, the head turns rocky and settles to a big puffy cloud, leaving patches of sea-foam one the snifter glass.  The aroma is that of lemon hops, with a touch of grain and apple, followed by apples, spice, and with warmth pepper and other juicy fruit.  Lightly tart, with a zing of acid Hennepin grabs the tongue, and lets alcohol take over with each sip. Distinctly yeasty, with warmth, this tastes like fermented apples or pears and has a parting shot of tartness in the finish, followed by a long lingering dryness.  Lively carbonation is most prominent, in this silky full bodied dry beer. Cleansing and lightly astringent, with moderate alcohol, this is a winner.  Very easy to consume and improves quite well with warmth, so take your time and espouse your views with leisure.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

42,141,BretSikkink,3.95,"Hard to believe I've never review Hennepin. I picked up a 750 just for the purpose (and because of excellent memories of getting it on sale in college).  Hazy golden color with some orange-amber hues. Head is pretty tall, mostly white, with good-looking saison carbonation. Quite a bit of flakiness at the end from a rather non-judicious pour made the last glass a bit darker and less attractive, but overall a fine appearance for the style. Not much retention and lacing.  The nose is fruity-sweet, with sour apple, lemon, and a touch of clove leading the way. The flavor is similarly fruity, good pale malt base with a slight earthiness of herbs and spices. High levels of carbonation don't give way to that metallic element, but do betray a bit of the high alcohol content.  Tart, citric finish that's not too puckering, great for the style. Very solid take on the style that's not too flashy. Pays homage to the originals but has a distinctly American voice. When you see this one for under $7, consider it a steal.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

It's kind of one-dimensional here but I really like this particular dimension. Simply delicious-smelling.  Taste: again, light pear with a distinct and delicious chalkiness. There is a tiny hint of malty funk buried underneath the delicious subtlety; it peeks out a bit toward the end along with a nice smooth bitterness. This is a delicious beer.

Initial glass was a clear, golden yellow, with a continuous stream of tiny bubbles racing to meet the light, white head that formed and left beautiful lacing. Final glass was a little hazier, probably due to my disturbing the yeast at the bottom of the bottle.  Smell was not overly remarkable, mildly hoppy with a little citrus overtones, but nothing seemed to stand out.  Taste was intriguing. Probably had it a little cold initially, so I got a little citrus/hoppy kick, mildly acidic. As the bottle warmed I got a little more earthiness to yeast. The alcohol was not as prominent as the ABV would have you think.  Mild carbonation led to a crisp, zesty feel in the mouth.  Overall, very easy to drink.

The regular already is a world champion but the Cave Aged which was 2 years old (bottle still covered in authentic cave dust) was so much richer and more complex than the regular Hennepin.

Has an aroma of very yeasty/doughy bread with a spicy twang to it. Lots of light fruity citrus aromas, with a little mustiness. I pick only a bit of the alcohol giving it almost a fresh mint smell (at least it seemed like mint). There are plenty of earthy hops in there as well.  It tastes very much like it smells - yeasty and spicy with lemon and some white grape flavors. There is plenty of earthiness to it as well. As is warmed up some sweet malty flavors came out a little. There's a mild bitterness on the finish. There is almost a champagne like quality about the flavors.  It's very light bodied, but not watery in any way. There's some gentle fizzy bubbles that are little sharp on swallowing. It has a light juicy feel to it, but very dry at the same time.  This is a great beer. Very light, crisp and refreshing, yet full of flavor. It has almost an elegant quality to it.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,RppIII,4.6,"Poured from a growler into a pint glass (several times)  Appearance: Pours a pale golden with a slight haze clouding the body of the beer. Carbonation gives way to a full snow white churning head, which quickly subsided to a light film that leaves almost no lacing.  Smell: The aroma of this beer has a slight doughy sour note, fruit, spicy yeast, and a hint of alcohol.  Taste: The beer brings back memories of many a triple but with a twist. I love the flavour present from Belgian style yeast. There is a sweet tartness to this beer that reminds me of white grapes which is a superb contrast to the dry crisp profile of this beer. Reminds me very much of a sauvignon blanc I recently had.  Mouthfeel: Medium in body, crisp, and refreshing. This beer is excellent at masking it's 7%+ abv, which adds to the pleasant feel going down.  Drinkability: It doesn't get much better than this. If this beer could contain alcohol or could be exactly the same and contain no alcohol I would opt for later because if I could I would drink this all day every day. Absolutely the best Saison I have ever had.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Tulkas,4.43,"Enjoyed in an oversized pilsner.  Large aromatic head easily established with light pouring, aggressive pouring will give you more than you asked for.  Lost of flavor, delightful clove and cinnamon-esque undertones, finishes clean. Body matches the flavor very well. Yeast visible but hardly noticeable at any stage-neither disappointed or happy about this.  Would love to try this again on tap-will def enjoy again at 7.99/bottle, mirrors the quality of much more expensive Belgium styles at half the price.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Mouthfeel is light and effervescent.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,snpub540,4.2,"This beer has alot going on for itself. Poured a nice pale golden hue. Very reminescent of straw. Fluffy white head that left some nice lacing on the glass. Not overly carbonated, but a nice stream of bubbles were there.  Smell was great. Very much yeasty with an earthiness and some banana and clove notes in there. Also a barnyard smell, more like straw. Some spice notes were present too but not very strong.  Taste was great and super complex. This beer seemed to change alot as it got a little warmer. At first it was very earthy, sort of had a mushroom yeasty taste, which wasn't unpleasant. As it warmed it became more fruity with a more pronounced alcohol warmth and the clove notes started coming through alot more. I enjoyed this one immensely.  Mouthfeel was medium bodied and the alcohol was pleasantly masked by all that was going on with the flavors. Has to be the best saison that I have tried.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

The aromas were quite good with a hint of spice to the dominant grassy tones. The taste is really good; a perfect balance of sour tastes with fruit flavors like lemons, peaches, oranges. All of it mixed with a yeasty, earthy flavors. Mouthfeel was decent though the drink lacked a good punch and was a little too light.

42,141,puboflyons,4.42,"Sampled on January 19, 2010. The cork popped and flew across the room emitting a nice bit of carbonated mist from the bottle. The pour is pale yellow and quite cloudy with excitable effervescence. The fizzy white head diminishes after a few moments. The aroma is a nice pleasing balance of wheat, banana, yeast, and clove. There is a nice creamy, bold mouthfeel. The taste echoes the aroma with an additional breadiness and a dry hop ending. Ommegang really understands the Belgian style brtewing process and they emulate it well.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,JohnQVegas,4.4,"Bottle into red wine glass.  Pours honey gold, cloudy and with a big fluffy white head. Settles into a dense 1/4"" cap that leaves epic lacing.  Nose is peppery, a bit musty, nice farmhouse character, with a lightly sweet, bready malt body underneath. Notes of honey and orange come through at times to really make things interesting.  Taste starts off with a big orangey fruitiness, peppery, light honey sweetness, pilsner malt, grassy bitterness. Yeast lends both a big dose of phenols as well as a lightly bread presence on the exhale. Finish is crisp, dry, moderately bitter with a nice grassy presence and another shot of peppery yeast to finish things off.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, crisp, full carbonation, dry, with a long, moderate bitterness and a huge lingering yeast presence.  Drinkability is good, pretty much classic saison. Crisp, refreshing, but with a huge, massively complex flavor. Textbook. Excellent.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,kylejohnson03,4.3,"Corked and caged 750, bottled on 9/23/09.  Poured into an Ommegang Tulip. First pour gives me a finger of fluffy head, and a great straw-coloring. Lacing doesnt stick to the glass, but a nice collar sits around the top.  Citrus sweetness dominates early and a mellow hop profile gives you flowery notes without being over the top. Balance makes this beer the absolute treat that it is. Thin body and medium carbonation make this an easy drinker, the mark of a great saison beer.  I would write more, but its a shame to be tapping on my phone while this beer sits in front of me. Do yourself a favor and go drink one of your own.

Appearance: Slightly hazy, very pale golden color with a very large, long-standing white head that leaves behind thick foam around the side of the glass.  Smell: Sweet, apple-like hints with butter and yeasty bread and slight herbal grassiness. Definite Belgian farmhouse aromas.  Taste: Begins with apple sweetness and buttery bread finishing with hearty, lingering bitterness. Yeast throughout.  Mouthfeel: Relatively light bodied, with balanced, natural-feeling carbonation and a crisp finish.  Drinkability: If I didn't know what brewery this was from, I would say this was brewed in Belgium. Absolutely true to the style and very good overall.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Finishes with a sour, medicinal quality with traces of salt. Leaves the roof of my mouth feeling warm and numb.  D: Not something I could ""drink"" for an evening.  Value: I paid three bucks for a 12 oz bottle. Not bad for what is obviously a high-quality ale.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,fairdinkum2,4.47,"Poured from a 750 ml bottle into a tulip glass. Formed a good head with just a moderate pour. Head disappeared pretty quickly, leaving a thin collar. Appearance is attractive with a light golden, slightly hazy look. Complex nose. Spice, citrus and yeast. I can't say that this style is my favorite beer, so I am always a little reticent about what I'm going to taste. However, this beer keeps the citrus and spice components very well balanced. Some sweetness on the front palate and some hoppiness on the finish. Gives the beer a crisp appeal. Good level of carbonation, surprising given how quickly the head dissipated. Again, this is well balanced and adds to this beers drinkability. I'm looking forward to drinking more of this beer and others from this producer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,SACraig,4.42,"Appearance - Golden and fairly clear, nice lingering head with nice lace Smell - Complex, esters, sweet, strong pleasant odors tells of things to come. Taste - Balanced with sweet and spicy flavors. Feel - Semi dry finish. Aftertaste lingers, but it is pleasant and just encourages the next taste. Drink - Great  Very impresive beer as expected from the Duvel family of ales. This was the beer that started my love of Saisons. The flavor created by the high ABV is complex while avoiding the alcohol/solvent flavors.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,wknight167,4.2,"Apearance - A very careful pour revelas a clear light yellow to orange beer with a 3 finger thick white head that dissolves slowly and leaves behind very nice lacing. Champagne like carbonation.  Nose- Very heavy on the yeast spiciness. Clove, citrus, coriander, pear and honey all accompany a definite bready character.  Palate- Sweet yet tart. Lemon, pear and honey, spiced with clove and coriander. Alcohol is warming, but not overpowering.  Mouthfeel- Medium body, high levels of fine carbonation.

S: A little fruity, maybe some banana with a touch of yeast.  T: Starts sweet, fades to slightly bitter, with a sweet, almost caramel aftertaste, very good.  M: Carbonation is very big in this beer but not so much as to overwhelm your taste buds, nice.  D: I could drink this all night long. When served chilled, I didn't notice the alcohol flavor much, and then it warmed up and was very noticeable in the finish.

42,141,generalnotsew,3.77,My first Farmhouse Ale ever so bear with me.  A: Fat head with larger bubbles that isn't going anywhere soon. Very bright yellow with a tint of orange. But a tad weak.  S: Very sweet toasty malt. A bit of cloves and very faint banana. Some fruity notes as well.  T: Pretty tart. Really reminds me of a Strong Belgian Pale Ale. Is there not much difference? Lemon lime with a smooth caramel malt likeness on the back end. Really tangy stuff. I like it.  M: Seems common for the style and in style I mean Strong Belgian Pale Ale as that is what it feels like to me.  D: A bit too overcarbonated for my liking.  May have this about 5 degrees too cold so chances are I will like it more as it warms. Overall I do like this beer and would go for it again. Still can't stop thinking of Duvel as I drink it. I really need to research how close to the style it is.  D: Just seems too tart for me to handle drinking a lot of this. Almost puckering.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

I've had this lots of times before, both at the brewery and far away from it and I've loved it every time.  a: poured from a 750ml bottle into a Ommegang tulip glass. Quickly forms a 3 finger flat-white head (which slowly dissapates), even with a gentle pour. Clear, bright golden color with lots of carbonation. Excellent.  s: strong and complex aroma. almost indistinguishable from genuine Belgian saisons. surprisingly funky nose on this one (horse blanket, grassy hay), along with some malts and a subtle hint of hops.  t: lots of funk flavor in the forefront, with delicate malts to round it out a bit. hop flavor is noticeable, but by no means oppressive. belgian yeast adds another facet of complexity. excellent stuff.  m&d: pleasently bubbly mouthfeel, goes down smooth. drinkability is outsanding, since it's inexpensive (6 dollars for my bottle), easy to obtain and very easy to drink.  before trying hennepin, i was not a fan of the style, but since then i've really enjoyed saisons. i'd say this is still up there on my top 5 saison list.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Duxx,3.66,"Poured into a pint glass.  A: Wow, I've never seen a beer with a head like this one. It was easily 4+ fingers tall. It filled 1/2 of my pint glass with a meringue like bright white head. I did not use an aggressive pour because I was trying not to get any trub in my glass. The label says not to be too delicate with the pour so as to ""create a luxurious head."" I definitely saw that. The meringue like head stayed around for the whole 750 ml bottle. It was easy to refresh the head with each pour. (3 times in total.) The beer color was a cloudy bright yellow. Kind of like if you mixed a BMC & a witbier.  S: Cloves, Cloves, and more Cloves!! As a matter of fact, I grabbed the spice jar of cloves from the cupboard and it smelled exactly like that an almost as intense!  T: Again, cloves and more cloves along with a sweet after taste. I was reminded of those clove spice jelly beans that are common around Easter time. I really like those jelly beans and was surprised to find a beer that tasted like that but in a good way.  M: OK to good I guess. I was so overwhelmed by the surprising flavor it was hard to pay attention to this.  D: I finished the whole 750 ml bottle while making the baked ziti for dinner.

A touch of sweetness, with some wheat flavor as well. Small alcohol warmth at the back end.  M: Smooth, light body. Instead of crispness, the carbonation gives it a very velvet- or silk-like feel.  D: This beer was smooth and refreshing, and balances the alcohol well. I split the 750 mL bottle with one other person but I could have easily finished it myself.

Not very complex, but interesting enough.  T- Starts off with wheat and malt flavor and quickly melds into more lemon zest and yeast, followed by a peppery character. Finishes fairly hot at 7.7%, not much malt to counteract that alcohol.  M- Fairly strong carbonation and a lighter body.

My reluctance about an American 'poseur' to the fine Belgian tradition was removed with this beer. Didn't seem to have quite the alcohol 'kick' of several world class Belgians, but that obviously added to the ""drinkability"". No reservations about having more than two at one sitting without feeling crapulent or hammered. Not the world's leader in this category, but well worthwhile.

T: Mmhmm.... it takes me a bit to get past the farmhouse flavors here, but once my tongue gets used to it there's an amazing confluence of flavors underneath. A strong yeastiness is definitely present here, as is a nice crisp citrus flavor. The finish is dry but clean.  M: Moderate thickness, but coats the palate nicely due to the heavy yeastiness.

Smell was immediate as soon as I popped the cork. Very tart and fruity upfront followed by a lemon zestiness. A nice clove to dress thing's up and finish it off.  Taste and Mouth is pretty much the same extreme fruity tartiness, and very zesty. A nice hoppiness as well along with some very sweet malts.

A: Pours a bright gold with a massive white head that remains for quite awhile. It's appearance reminds me somewhat of Duvel.  S: Holy cow, it even smells like Duvel. Hints of pear and sugar, along with subtle hops. I wonder if Ommegang uses the same hops as Duvel uses.(Styrian Golding, perhaps?)  T: A bouquet of citrus and sugar with a tart aftertaste. Some mild bread as well. I remember the first time I had this brew and didn't exactly love it. I suppose things have changed. Amazing!  M: Well carbonated with a dry prickly finish. Almost seems to finish exactly like I recall Duvel's finish. While they are different styles (Begian Strong versus Saison) I imagine using the same hops is obviously going to make them seem similar.  D: This is a fantastic brew that can be enjoyed in a limited session. For some reason, there is a huge difference between drinking this in the bottle versus pouring into a glass.

Very tall, white head with good retention (slow dissipation) that leaves some trail on the glass. Somewhat cloudy, but rising bubbles are still visible.  Flavor: Crisp citrusy hop flavor with some spice notes (seems to be ginger). Maybe a bit of light maltiness and yeast flavor present? Very slight bit of alcohol in background.

42,141,cbutova,3.58,"Pours out like lemonade, hazy yellow that looks very dilute. Has an explosive head that goes up to about three fingers and dies down to about one and retains at that point very well. The color is not that attractive but I think the haziness is due to me pouring in some of the sediment. Other than that the appearance is pretty strong. Smell is a mix of Belgian yeast and malts, some fruit (apples, bananas) and a bit of sour. The overall strength of the smell is a bit weak and I start to pick up more and more alcohol as I drink it. Taste is pretty much the same as smell. Belgian yeast and malty flavors, fruits (apples, bananas), alcohol and some sour. A tiny bit of hops. It is stronger than the nose and pretty much just a solid Belgian flavor. It eventually dies down to a very dry almost rye like taste with alcohol, the loss of flavor is disappointing. Mouthfeel is pretty suitable. The carbonation is medium and the body is pretty light but a bit creamy. Not really watery at all. This beer is pretty warm for 7.5%. Drinkability would be better if the alcohol did not take over and the flavors did not die. The price is not that great for how much I liked this beer. Maybe I'll try it again after I have some more Saisons.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,goblue3509,3.68,"Pours a yellowish oragnish grapefruit like color with a pillowy head that gives way to decent lacing. The aroma is of sweet malt and some citrus. The taste is sweet malt backbone with some citrus hints. The mouthfeel is very carbonated and bubbly. This is a very drinkable beer, nothing to turn you off, but it is a slighty funky taste, the alcohol is well hidden.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,southernbelle09,4.45,"I tried this beer out of a 22 oz bottle from Oasis in Spartanburg. The color is kind of hard to describe. Sort of a hazy yellow with huge, bright white head that fades some. Smell is sugar and alcohol with little hops. Taste is sweet and a bit dry. This one is really bubbly, but a very easy drink, espically at 7.7 abv! I was really impressed with this beer and can see why it's one of the best saisons out there!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,advill88,4.3,"Pours a rich golden color with a robust one and a half inch head with strong retention.  Smells of sweet honeysuckle, with a touch of yeastiness.  Taste has the same prominent characteristics of honey and a light malt, with a touch of sweetness. There's an ever so slight touch of hops on the back end to provide a bit of balance. Mouthfeel is medium with carbonation on the heavier side.  This beer is just right for the style; it's not too strong to take away from drinkability, but it's still very flavorful and complex. I could probably drink this all day without getting tired of it.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Augustiner719,4.38,"Poured from a 750ml bottle into an ommegang tulip glass  Appearance: Hazy yellowish orange color with a huge 3 finger head. Great pillowy head with medium sized bubbles in the lace along the glass.  Smell: Smells very lemony, yeasty, herbal and pine coney. Great zesty quality in terms of the oiliness of lemon and orange peels.  taste: Tastes similar to the oily texture of citrus zest. Great corriander and citrus taste followed by yeasty goodness. Very light and refreshing.  Mouthfeel: Coats the palate surprizing well for such a light flavored beer.  Drinkability: I say F bud light, this wins for drinkability. Perfect carbonation, mouthfeel and texture. Not overwelming at all, yet very interesting and complex. A must if you havent had anything from ommegang!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,blackearth,4,"Purchase from Three Cellars in Franklin, WI. Poured into a snifter, this beer shows a bright yellow body with a thick puffy white head.

Very good drinkability.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,mullenite,4.08,"This bottle is aged about a year, where it is different from a fresh bottle I will note in the review but I do not have one here to do a side-by-side.  Pours a very hazy pale orange color with a two finger pillow-y white head that leaves very nice lacing down the glass.  Smell has a nice fruit character to it, a little funk in the background, but not really a brett funk. Some coriander and clove in there as well. Smells a bit like a funky witbier.  Taste is definitely more funky than a fresh bottle and it has developed nicely. I have always considered Hennepin a ""half saison"" because it lacked this funk whenever I've had it (bottle or tap) but after a year I have to say it is much better.  The spice flavors from the nose come through but while the lemon/citrus is still there it is not as pronounced.  Medium body with a lot of sharp carbonation to it. This is very easy to drink and overall is much better than any fresh Hennepin I've had.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

42,141,emsroth,4.3,"12oz bottle  App: Light golden/straw with a perfect amount of haze. Small streams of bubbles rise to a thick, frothy head.  Smell: Apricots and apples with a hint of champagne sweetness. Sour and peppery yeast. A hint of husky malt, perhaps wheat?  Taste: The beer changes flavor throughout the sip. It starts with a biting carbonation that is taken over by the tartness of the yeast. A slight sweet flavor (pear and orange) follows that is taken by a hop and malt bite. The taste dries on the tongue and leaves a sweet, husky malt behind with a bit of lingering bitterness.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Cakanator,4.3,"At Ommefest. Amazing golden color with light hints of softer fruits, spices, and zest. Amazingly crisp and dry much how i love saisons. Always a winner. I've had the original from belgium recently that is about 2 years old and can say that it is holing up very well. I was surprised how well it was doing censidering the time difference, but Ommegang did a great job with this one.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,CharlatanSin,3.67,"Poured from a 22 oz into my old trusty oversized wine glass. Purchased from Flair Beverages in Inwood, no freshness date on the bottle.  Appearance: Pours an apple juice color and looks extremely fizzy. There's a light one finger head on the pour that goes away fast with some light lacing.  Smell: Yeasty, like rising bread. Also a mild tart fruitiness that I couldn't quite place. I want to say boysenberry, but I think I've only had boysenberry flavored soda, not the actual fruit.  Taste: Up front it tastes like sweet country white bread. Pleasant enough. The finish, though, is superb. Complicated and spicy. Goes great with hummus.  Mouthfeel: This is where the drink suffers. It's way more watery than I would have guessed by looking at it. Where did all the carbonation that was apparent when I poured go? It's not unpleasantly syrupy like I find most low-carbonation beers, but I wasn't impressed.  Drinkability/Overall: This beer seems to get better as you drink it. I guess the tastes come out more as it warms. Also, this beer has one of the greatest differences between pre and post-agitation taste that I've ever had. Certainly drinkable, and I wouldn't turn down another, particularly with certain types of food. Still, I prefer the Rare Vos from Ommegang.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

The aroma thin, it has some sour funkiness, some yeast, and maybe some pale hops. Flavor is much more pleasing. Some fruitiness, banana and clove flavors. There are some yeast and hop flavors there too, but they are mild.  Carbonation is high, not sure if that is appropriate or not, but it seems to go well. Mouthfeel is dry, leaving you wanting another sip.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

The head is about a finger, gone quickly with decent retention.  The aroma is ok, nothing outstanding with light hops and flowers.  The taste is better than I thought after the aroma, but once again nothing to distinguish itself as a great, it is what it is. There is light hoppiness with flowers.  The beer is really watery but easily drinkaable.  Overall this to me is just a little more pricey sessional, nothing special",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,tronester,4.25,"Pours a slightly hazy very pale golden with bluish-green highlights. A nice rocky pale white head sits atop the beer. Smell is estery, fruity, and smells of fresh grain.

Drinkability is very good, delicate flavors make this an excellent beer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,drabmuh,3.61,"Beer served on draft at a local bar. Beer is yellow and has a slight haze to it. Thcik white head, carbonation low. Lacing is very high in this beer.  Aroma is primarily yeasty followed by that Saison funk. Like a barn.  This beer has a lot of odd bitterness to it. Its like orange peels or something. The flavors are complicated, fruity, sour, harsh, and finished by the bitterness. Drinkability moderate and the mouthfeel is a little thin. Not my favorite from this brewery unfortunately.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,jhoban19,4.5,"750ml bottle with cork and cage, poured 12 oz at a time into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass.  A: clear golden color with fluffy eggshell white foam, about 1 fingers worth. settles into a decent ring with full surface coverage and good lacing. constant stream of effervescent bubbles throughout the entire pint. the second 12 ounce pour yielded a considerably more luxurious foam- at least 3 fingers worth - and really held up well. also becoming a bit hazier as I near the bottom of the bottle (must be the sediment creeping into each subsequent pour).  S: initial aromas are of familiar Belgian yeast, biscuit-like, giving way to some tart green apple and floral hops as it warms. getting a subtle hint of golden raisins as well.  T: lemon and honey, with a pleasant green apple tartness on the finish. subtle hops spiciness kicks in as the liquid moves along the tongue. each sip also brings various hints of fruits that I can't quite put a finger on- some raisons and a random taste of over-ripe banana. the biscuit malt really steps forward as it warms.  M: medium bodied with wonderfully fizzy carbonation. smooth and crisp on the tongue and in the throat. a pleasant tingle lingers on the roof of the mouth. the honey and lemon really lingers throughout each sip.  D: this is what I expect from a Saison. excellent balance of tartness, floral and spicy hops (haven't experienced that before, hope I'm not misinterpreting something), and biscuity malt. this beer looks good, smells good, tastes good and has a very pleasant mouthfeel.

T- much the same as the smells- sweet and biscuity on the front. lemon and honey with a dry alcohol aftertaste that lingers even longer as the ale warms. reminds me quite a bit of a belgian tripel.  M- medium to light body with lots of carbonation. crisp in the palate  D- kept waiting for the catch but there isn't one. this is a really good beer. could drink one every night and not tire of it for a long time. looking forward to picking up a sixer and letting them age for 6-12 months.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,dougriddle,4.35,"Just poured this from one of the 750ml bottles. It has a nice and soft golden yellow color with a strong head that slowly dissipates as it sits in the glass. Upon the first sniff I get a slight, slight malt fragrance accompanied with citrus. When drinking while smelling there is a strong hoppy aroma as well as a nice hoppy and carbonated dance on the tongue. As it goes down the hatch, I get a crisp, burst of citrus followed by a final goodbye of hoppiness. The taste left in the mouth is a battle between hops and citrus, with the victor eventually being the citrus. Indeed it should be served a tad bit out of the fridge as I think it helps battle the strong carbonation. But my goodness is this beer smooth, delicious and oh so good to the last drop. Hennepin, we will be seeing each other soon.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

The taste has elements of Slovak Christmas bread.  Mouthfeel: high carbonation, moderately sweet, dry medium light bodied  Drinkability: Very tasty. By far my favorite in the style that I have tried so far. I like the hay taste without the big bitter taste. I will be having this again.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Leaves long lasting lacing too. The aroma is near perfect for what it is. Smells very fruity...sweet, not boozy at all. Tastes are consistent with a couple different fruits. I pick up a little grapefruit specifically. Very refreshing and easy to drink.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

There are some touches of spice and yeast in there too. The finish is dry.  M- Slick feel, clean finish and an aggressive carbonation.  D- My first saison, and I love it. It's just perfect to sip on, but I really like pairing it with food.

42,141,Offa,4.03,"This is a tasty, lightly spicey beer, light yet solid in character and feel.  Faintly hazy pale straw, it has a huge, off-white head steadily shrinking to a thin, rocky foam and leaving some foamy lace.  The aroma is light, fruity alcohol, grain, hints of banana, clove, yeast, dough.  The taste starts slightly shrp and acidic, but this quickly settles down into a lightly alcoholic fruitiness with herbal-peppery-spicey bite, yeasty dough. The herb has a juniper quality along with otherwise leafiness and grassiness. There is a light earthy hint throughout. It has light sweetness balanced by the bitter-spicey-acidic bite so ends up rather dry, but not too dry. It's quite drinkable and, though a bit thin, has some complexity and good balance while the character holds up well.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

T - spicy and bitter with a musty and hay-ish flavor underlined by a yeast-earthy thing. quick hints of sweetness emerge about halfway through before things dry and clean up for the finish.  MF - medium sized body with a creamy feel. tons of explosive little bubbles that massage and tingle on the way down and make for a crisp palate scrubber of a beer.

The effervescence complements the crisp, clean character of this ale very well.  Aroma is moderately hoppy, with a touch of spicy citrus.  Tastes of noble hops, with a moderate and pleasant bitterness, balanced well by a full maltiness. Slightly sweet in the finish. Very drinkable; I'd gladly enjoy two or three of these in a sitting, in spite of the ABV.  Overall, this is a very balanced and drinkable ale. Definitely one of my favorite American interpretations of a Belgian style, and I'd also say this is one of my favorite saisons -- regardless of origin. I recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable crisp, tasty pale ale with more character than the typical golden ale.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Nice malts and very strong yeast smell. Mild sweetness maybe some honey. Spices.  T - Very clean earthy and grainy malt taste with a great yeast kick right after. Some mild clove sweetness that dissipates quickly. Some nice hop bite at the end.  M - light-medium with great CO2 intensity and balanced flavors. Great texture.

It has wonderful looking floaties that look great when held up to the light. Has a more understated mouthfeel than the non cave aged version and is much more pleasant to drink.

The head here is remiscient of Duvel - but not quite as prolific and doesn't retain quite as well.  Smell is citrusy with layers of apple/pear. Taste is similar, but there's also a spice at play. Gives a nice warming sensation. The apple/pear was pretty dominant to me. Left a bit of an aftertaste that I wasn't entirely thrilled with - but I believe it's just personal preference, so I won't mark it down because of that.  Light to medium body and very drinkable.

Spicy, zesty, black pepper up front, with a nice citrus flavor (orange peel, lemon rind). Every sip has amazing flavor. [edit] Man this is funky!  Mouthfeel - Light to medium bodied. Moderate carbonation that appears to be never ending and ends with a crisp dry finish.  Drinkability - Relatively drinkable for an almost 8% Saison.

Frothy white head that builds quickly and sticks slightly on the way down.  S- Very fresh and spicy. First instinct is citrus, then the hints of dark fruits clove and banana linger.  T/M- Must admit I had higher expectations for taste based on the smell. Rush of carbonation. The citrus is there, along with some other fruits as it warms, such as fresh apple or pear. Some honey is there in the background. There is a tart after taste from the beginning, and you can feel the alcohol on the exhale.  D- Had the whole 750 and could ask for more.

Vigorous carbonation is evident through a hint of haze.  Aroma is lightly spicy and fruity with notes of coriander, ginger, and pepper. It's more subdued than many others in this style, but nonetheless complex and pleasing.  The taste is spicy clove and coriander, ripe pear, apple, ginger, orange peel, and pineapple. A refreshing tart, spiciness is present from start to finish.  Finishes bone-dry and crisp. It appears that much of fruit and spice is coming from actual spices as opposed to the yeast.

42,141,cavedave,4.45,"It pours a beautiful, cloudy, light golden with a massive snow white head of lasting foam. As it recedes coriolis ejections of fluff stick to the snifter.  Smell is a bright and full aroma of bread, belgian yeast, spice (clove? coriander?) and light fruit, perhaps peach or nectarine, bounded by a pleasant, slight sourness which balances it perfectly. Wonderful bouquet, the kind that invites the nose to stay upon the rim.  Before describing the first, and subsequent, sips, it is now two minutes after the pour and still there is one finger of lather-like foam atop this gem.  What a flavor, there is a lot going on here. It is 45 degrees and the taste is full of sweet and light bread, yeast, mellow tartness, bright spiciness, and earth, fruit, and herbal notes that round the sip into a complex delight that finishes semi-juicy and full of herb, earth, and light bitter. As it warms all the flavors become more assertive, but the balance improves. A marvelous, complex flavor, it tastes better now, from a supermarket bottle, than it did in a pour at the brewery.  Mouthfeel is full bodied, perhaps a bit overcarbonated, with a clean flavor hold that allows the taste to stay in the mouth in a pure form. Good job Ommegangmembers!  Drinkability is of a dangerous caliber, delicious, easy to drink, alcohol burn MIA. Warning flags are up on this one.

Would be a total loss if it wasn't for that big fat fluffy cloud of a head that almost has a mind of its own. In words of Frankenstein ""It's Alive!""  Smell: Has a faint aroma but what it does have is some complex nuances in that nose. There is some an almost bubble-gum sweetness with a big Belgian yeasty corn-husk backbone that is offset with a present rubbing alcohol phenol.  Taste: Starts off with a wave of citrus then some earthy undertones that transform into a banana like taste that finishes off like a yeasty apple juice.  Mouthfeel: Such a rush of carbonation guides this clean and complex brew down your throat in one fell swoop.  Drinkability: Could easily quaff and quite enjoyable to say the least. Abv is moderate but not a single notion that its in there besides its phenol aroma.  Overall: Big bold flavor for a domestic belgian these guys aren't playing around with the style.

42,141,sisuspeed,4.38,"Poured this specific tasting from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. The beer forms a big, fluffy, white head that eventually reduces to some extent, but remains throughout the enjoyment of the beer. Lacing is present and coats the glass above the cloudy, pale yellow hue of the beer. Looks refreshing.  Belgian yeasts rise up from the glass, mixed with citrus and something that smells slightly like bacon. Some spice notes mingle as well.  Floral, citrus, and a mixture of prickly carbonation and hop bitterness come to mind after the first sip. Upon consuming more, honey notes and a bit of ethyl alcohol come through, but the alcohol is faint and well hidden. As the beer warms up, toasted bread moves into the foreground and compliments the other flavors quite well.  The mouthfeel is full, yet refreshing. Not thick like a stout or porter, but the beer still has some robustness. The prickly carbonation probably aids in the refreshing aspect of this beer. In terms of drinkability, the beer is extremely smooth and goes down very well. I could see myself consuming a large volume of this tasty Farmhouse Ale on a lazy summer afternoon.  In short, I have tried a couple Saisons/Farmhouse Ales and the Hennepin is by far one of the best, if not the best. Ommegang has done an excellent job in creating a world class Saison.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,abuliarose,4.6,"Poured into a pint glass. The bottle said pour slowly and man did I ever! Even so, there was a huge white head and it continues to bubble vigorously. Color is like french vanilla pudding, pretty unfiltered-looking.  Smells yeasty, fruity and a little like the taste of very sweet corn. Tastes carbonated, followed by strokes of sweet ginger and again the corn (albeit very good corn). The beer has an incredible bite to it coming in part from the carbonation, but leaves a very smooth and almost citrusy taste on the tongue that teases of hop bitterness. Very refreshing. Alcohol is detectable, but not overwhelming. Mouthfeel is big from the carbonation, but otherwise smooth with medium-light body.  This is what I want a farmhouse ale to taste like. Thank you, Ommegang, for the delicious saison. Next time I'll get the bigger bottle.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

A few visible bubbles can be seen rising.  S-Sweet fruit stands out. Lots of green apple. It also has a lot of bread aroma. Not much funk is coming out.  T-Tastes very sweet. The fruit, particularly apples, pineapple, and pears, are strong. The bready flavor is very strong in the aftertaste. Not very funky tasting. In the back there is a little spiciness.  M-Medium bodied and sticky. It has some prickly carbonation.  D-A decent beer, but too much sweet fruit for more than one. Would like it to be a tad more dry and funky.

Almost like drinking it directly out of a can. Loses some of the spice on the palate. It's very cold. There is a soap bubble taste - banana? Cloves.  Very drinkable.

Has a certain spice and medicinal quality to it as well.  Taste/Mouthfeel - Sweetness and fruits up front but finishes off with the tartness and medicinal qualities you get from the smell, especially as it warms. Light to medium bodied, quite a bit of carbonation keeps the mouthfeel even more refreshing.

It pours a golden opaque with great lacing and a nice one finger head. Simply put, it smells like outside, a farm to be exact. It carries a certain ""funk"" that I think only comes from a true saison ale. It has overtones of hay and has a mild sweetness but with a body to back it up.  Above all it is exceedingly tasty and drinkable. I use it as the standard to measure other saison ales against.

We got a case of the 'cave aged' hennepin (rests for a year in the howe caverns at 52 deg. for a full year after brewing) pour was very carbonated, big bitey bubbles and a huge head! after letting it rest for a good 15 minutes, the aroma was light, airy and slightly spicy. the taste in the mouth is almost the same as the flavor, not as spicy as it tastes though. pretty uneventful in whole, but very well balanced, mild and a perfect hot day beer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

S: Straw and sour but not as pronounced as others (e.g. Dupont) and more inviting. Mild hops and a malt balance. Strawberry, citrus and spice play a small role. Can smell a bit of alcohol.  T: Very mild hop flavor and much less sourness than expected, except towards the end. The malt does a good job of balancing the hops.  M: Fairly light, good carbonation - very crisp.

Unfortunately it disappears rather soon. You can see the great carbonation in the glass. Typical lighter color and not completely clear (not that I expected it to be)  S - Great smell of an awesome beer went immediately through the kitchen as soon as I had poured it into the glass.  T - Crisp, refreshing...perfect for a hot summer day. M - Crisp and refreshing, carbonation goes great with this light beer. No malt/hop overtone  D - Goes down very smooth. What?

The beer is a pale straw yellow with some slight hazing.  S- Mustiness and bananas are the first things I notice. The nose has alot of characteristics similar to hefe's. There is some slight sharp citrus deletable under it all.  T- Slight tartness and sourness but not as sour as I was expecting. Its citrusy, peppery and contains notes of the banana found in the nose.  M- Round and smoothness are offset by prickly crisp carbonation.  D- Quite refreshing and nice for warm weather.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Hint of citrus zest.  Taste: Tastes like it smells. Sweet malt up front, bananas and cloves, fades into a peppery citrus flavor that lingers. Was shocked to find the ABV at 7%. Completely masked in the taste, well done.  Mouthfeel: Creamy and round at first, but the good amount of carbonation gives a clean and tingling citrus feeling on the tongue as a finish. Tastes rich but refreshing.  Drinkability: Excellent. I'd have this all summer every summer.  Overall: This is a brilliant beer. It delivers exactly what it promises.

Smell's funky & tart, like I expect a farmhouse style should. Some citrus character. Earthy & dry.  Taste is citric up front, sour & funky from what I assume is brett, some smells of raw bread, spices, a little sweet in the finish. This sounds weird, but it reminds me of walking through high grass or brush & all the random organic smells that come out. It's very rustic & evocative, I like it.  Mouthfeel is tart, activates the saliva a little, but still smooth.  Drinkability is decent, I could easily have another, & the somewhat high ABV is not detectable.

Smells of medicinal phenols, clove, spiciness from the clove, light malty tones, touch of funk, just incredible. Tastes of dry, crisp spicy malt with a nice crisp bitterness and dry finish. Nice phenols and clove throughout balanced nicely with a clean malt. Some orange perhaps? Some earthy hops near the end, but muted by the spicy dry finish. Thin mouthfeel that is perfect for this style.  An amazing saison, lots of flavor, not sure if its from the malt or the added ingredients (ginger and orange, i think). Not super dry but being an American interpretation, one of the best for its style.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Hullabaloo2,4.32,"Aroma - Yeast/phenols. Sweetness. Estery. Nice, complex aroma.  Appearance - Yellow with slight haze. White head poured two fingerwidths that dissipated to one fingerwidth. Good lacing. A lot of visible carbonation.  Taste - Yeast/spicy phenols. Slight malt balance. Not very tart. The spice from the phenols, the fruity esters, the subtle hop flavor, the malt, and the dry alcohol finish makes this a very well balanced and complex beer.  Mouth Feel - Thin to medium body. High carbonation. Moderate alcohol. Dry finish. Somewhat phenolic aftertaste.  Overall Impression - Another solid beer from Ommegang. I'm continually impressed at the amount of Belgian beers they make that are great representations of the style. If you're new to Belgian beers/Saisons this is a good one to try and can serve as a good comparison for other beers of the style.

42,141,hossua34,4.45,"A - Pale yellow-gold with a slight haziness. A massive, rocky head disappears slowly leaving tons of sticky, white lacing.  S - Like candided oranges, grass, wheat and a touch of anise. Very complex and very good.  T - Spiced oranges were what I thought of. There is a very slight hint of anise, or some similar herb. Fresh wheat, grasses and other spiced notes. Deliciously complex.  M - Crisp, fizzy and refreshing, but also substantial. Damn near perfect.  D - For a beer so refreshing and crisp on the tounge, this Hennepin is surprisingly hearty. Perhaps the 7.7 ABV has something to do with that.  So... Great Lakes Grassroots Ale bills itself as a saison, but I am confused, because that tasted like crap and this tastes delicious.

Complex medium body, some sweetness, good spice and lots of carbonation (first-class yeast strains in this). There is some sweetness and plenty of dryness in the finish.  For the novice: Hennepin and Saison Dupont are standards in the world of saisons, you can not go wrong with those. Watch the pour, don't rush - let the head form.

Underneath the surface is a torrent of small bubbles rising up from the bottom of the glass like an upside down rainstorm. Clumps and spots of lace cling to the sides as the foam recedes.  The aroma seems rather faint for this beer. Spicy notes of clove and coriander, with some bready yeast and pale malt mixed in. Perhaps a hint of banana is in there as well.  Each sip of this medium bodied beer gives a soft effervescent fizz on the palate. It finishes slightly tart. The flavor is simple. Light sweet malt with a touch of honey and lemon, spices such as clove and allspice, a hint of apple and pear. At the end the beer becomes somewhat tart. Once gone the tart fruity flavor and some alcohol lingers on the palate.  This is a very tasty, easy drinking beer. Something that would go great with an expensive dinner.

Black pepper, orange peel, lemon citrus, and a funky yeast flavor.  Mouthfeel: Citrus and zesty. Medium bodied. Fairly high amount of carbonation. Ends with a spicy and funky aftertaste.

Hennepin has managed to capture the essence of the Belgium brewing style. A smooth blend of fruit, sour, and muted bread flavors that perfectly mask the relatively high alcohol content. I recently had one of these while watching Rick Steves give a HD tour of of the Grand Place in Brussels - perfect.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,BeanBone,4.05,"Appearance: A nicely hazy golden-straw body with three fingers of slightly off-white, bubbly head that sticks around and leaves good lacing.  Aroma: A honeyish malt body with fruity (golden fruit, citrus, and banana), yeasty, and spicy (clove, coriander, and pepper) notes. Some traces of booze, but not much.  Taste: Up front, a sweet pale malt character with fruit, spice, and ever-so-mild molasses twinge towards the end. It's somewhat sour and dries towards the end. Hints of alcohol in the end, in just the right proportion. It may not the most complex flavor profile, but it's quite satisfying.  Mouthfeel: Medium-light bodied and smooth with good carbonation. Crisp with a dry finish.  Drinkability: Generally good, but reined in a little by the moderately-high alcohol content.  Verdict: Hennepin is a great beer to sit down with an enjoy on a peaceful Summer evening.

42,141,berkey,4.18,"Corked and caged 750ml bottle poured into a goblet.  Pours a great hazy pale blonde typical of many Saisons from Belgium I've tried. Forms a good bright, foamy, white head with decent retention and very good lacing.  The aroma jumped out so agressively after the cork was popped it almost forced me to change up my usual review process and describe aroma before the appearance. Belgian style yeast, spice, citrus, and soft earthy aromas all rush out to greet me.  Everything on the aroma carries over well to the palate along with some herbal flavors and sweet, almost tropical, fruit. Some dry flavors here but not as much as some I've tried in the style. As it warms a tartness really starts to come through along with a vaguely medicinal character.  Medium body, balanced but slightly prickly carbonation, puckering tart and faint dry characters create a highly enjoyable mouthfeel. Drinkability is extremely high thanks in part to a very balanced flavor profile and a medium ABV.  Overall while not 100% to my personal preferences for the style (I like mine funkier and a little more dry) I have to admit this is an excellent job by Ommegang. They somehow managed to take one of my favorite styles of ale and craft something that's extremely approachable without 'dumbing it down' one iota. A top class ale I'd recommend whether you're new to the style or a seasoned Saison drinker.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Effervescence gives a sustaining vibrant head and ample lacing. Mmmmm pretty....  Smells of earthy, grassy-hay hops, fruity esters. If you close your eyes it takes you straight to the rolling hills of wheat and barley.  Taste is fruity, frothy and spicy in the finish. Refreshing and satisfying. Mmmmm lemon grassy...

S: A well balanced smell with spicy yeast, earth and sweet citric notes (oranges) to the fore. Apples, white bread, grass and a minimal note of English toffee. A pleasant smell, although it's not very powerful.  T: Subtle notes of lemon and apples quickly leaves room for a slightly roughed taste of malts, white bread and yeast. Plenty of spicy notes enters in the middle and stays on for the rest of the show. Very gentle nutty aromas get through every now and then. Grass, leaves, currants and bubblegum. The flavor has a good balance between sweetness and a mild tartness. The finish is mildly bitter and has a decent amount of alcohol to it, medicinal phenols, herbal notes and hints of fruit.  M: Medium body, well suited carbonation that's rather aggressive yet not overly so. A crisp texture with a dry finish.  D: A good saison. The alcohol is slightly too prominent.

42,141,bobsy,4.2,"I was completely unaware that Duvel owned Ommegang until I saw the label on the bottle. I knew there was some sort of link, but not this strong. She pours like a beat, and its all I can do not to write Duvel-esque down. A clouded gold body supports two fingers of white foam that puts down some good streaks of lace and lasts well. The aroma is kind of neat, and well perfumed. Spicy and floral, it has sweet notes from honey which are balanced out by a distinct earthiness. In the very background I get a touch of cider. Where's the funk? I expected Hennepin to bring more, but this is still a solid beer nonetheless. Marzipan and honey come through strong, and the earthiness become more apparent as you work your way through it. A touch of spice and barnyard keep things interesting, but I'm looking for more in a saison. Alcohol makes its presence felt. While the flavour didn't do much for me, the mouthfeel is simply awesome. Soft and pillowy, its all you could hope for in a beer, and works well with everything else going on here.  Overall, I really enjoyed this beer, but it did remind me more of a Belgian Strong Pale than a saison. I'm looking for more funk and more of a refreshing feel... in essence something more traditional. That aside, Hennepin is a decent US take on a Belgian and worth the price (especially when you get it on super-special like ritzkiss did - cheers for sharing Eric!).",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Nose is grassy with a little funk, slight lemon, hay, a hint of pepper. Subtle but it's all there.  Had this in a night of saisons and this one stands out for the delicacy and fine craftsmanship. It was not bold but yet all the right notes were in the right places. Some lemons and esters, hay and grass, faint hop profile in the finish, a real earthy feel to it with a sharp drying in the finish. Reminds me a little of a toned down Local 1 - more subtle.

Grains and yeast are first on the nose with an herbal sort of earthiness underlying and citrus notes. There's a nice dynamic between a light thick touch of honey and zesty citrus, also complimented by a gentle peppery spice underneath. This one's all purity, complexity and balance. There's a raw, leafy earthiness on the palate also. A biscuity malt serves as the backbone, but all the flavors are completely complimentary. A delicious brew. The body is medium and the mouthfeel is a balance of crisp and smooth.

The aroma is spicy and fruity with hints of yeast. The taste does not let me down. So fruity and delicious. I love the spice mix. It's like a piece of bread with cinnamon butter spread on it. I found the mouth feel to be pleasing as well. Not too thick. Seems right for a saison. I think this could easily be a session beer.

42,141,NODAK,4.53,"Aroma is very nice. Sweet and spicy...a good deal of fruity esters present. This is very inviting.  Pours a nice golden color with a fluffy, loose head that has very good retention.  Taste has some sweetness to it, but nowhere near overpowering, with some spicy notes seeming to be present as well. Finish is a little citrusy with a tart snap along with a tad bit of hop bitterness initially noticeable but fading away as drinking continues. Some yeastiness is even apparent at the very end. Aftertaste is pretty minimal with some spiciness and stickiness.  Alcohol is warming, but not overally obvious...at least, at first it isn't. As it warms, it does come out but never to the point of ruining drinkability.  Absolutely delicious and a personal favorite of mine. Very drinkable, very tasty and yet very dangerous.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Gish,4.4,"750 ml poured into a snifter.  A - Honey-colored, a bit hazy, has a huge head.  S - Herbal, astringent, reminds me of white wine.  T - Wow! One of the most crisp and refreshing beers I've ever had, especially considering it's approaching 8% ABV. Fairly tart, with tannins and white grapes. I had this by itself, but it would go great with food as well.  M - Well carbonated, a little thin.  D - Ridiculous drinkability, it blows away many beers that are lower in ABV in this area.  One of the best saisons I've had, Hennepin definitely gives Belgians a run for their money! Great value as well.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,wesbrownyeah,4.13,"A- Pours a beautiful light golden fluid that produces excellent mild bubbly head that leaves great lacing on the glass.  S- Smells of fresh yeast, alcohol esters, and mild grassy notes. Secondly I sense a very fresh wheat-like aroma that arouses the senses.  T-M- Upfront is a a very stiff alcohol presence followed by flavors of orange and other citrusy notes. Finishes with a piney after taste that hangs around for seconds. Mouthfeel is moderate with thick feel due to the alcohol in the beer. Smooth finish as it washes down.  D- Very drinkable and easily overdone... Be easy and enjoy!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,FloppyDog,4.25,"Poured into a tulip glass at the Flying Saucer in Raleigh, NC.  A nice pale yellow appearance with a minimal white head and a few lines of bubbles rushing up from the bottom of the glass.  The aroma is of honey, light fruitiness...mainly green apple..., possibly some wheat. A faint alcohol presence is apparent after it warms.  The taste is also of green apple, with a good malt presence and minimal hop bitterness or flavor.  It has a light mouth feel with with a slight prickliness from the carbonation.  Overall, this is a great summer beer. Nice for a hot day, but still enough flavor and complexity to be a quality craft beer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Onenote81,3.76,"Had this on tap at First St. Draught House in town. Came out a murky yellow/gold with no head on it at all. No lacing present either. Smells of funk, yeast, pineapple, coriander, and flowers.  The mouth is very crisp and overly-carbonated. Too spritzy for my liking. This may be a style thing so my rating is a bit higher than my preference. Flavor is of pineapple, apples, tart yeast, and slight spicy finish. This is refreshing and pretty good. Had it with lunch and it paired well. Not bad. My first of this style. I will seek out more...",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Lots of yeast activity from the bottom of the glass, with bubbles rising towards the top. The scent is heavy with the Belgian yeast and backed with the alcohol. There are some hints of spice and clove, but not too prevalent.  The taste is great - peppery and spicy, with some underlying tones of banana. There are also a good amount of hoppiness and bite throughout. The alcohol carries through towards the aftertaste, but doesn't present itself that heavily.  The mouthfeel is very light-bodied and crisp; sort of reminiscent of a champagne, but not as bubbly.

Decent looking but nothing to write home about.  S-yeast, banannas, clove and slighly sour funk. Overall earthy, organic and wet dog in the far background. Overall a rather understated nose...I had expected more.  T-slightly citrus fruits and Belgian yeast with young green apple with a mild clove undertone. Delicately sweet, with a very understated sour note and a dry somewhat astringent hop finish.  M-well balanced mouthfeel overall, on the lighter side of medium with ample effervescent carbonation.  D-this is a pretty drinkable brew. It goes down easy and is pretty understated.  Overall, I could take or leave this one. I was really looking forward to it based upon the advice of some friends, and, of course all the reviews and kudos here, but frankly I just don't get it. It is decent, it is solid, and would I take another if someone poured it, sure, why not? But did it blow me away and would I seek it out again? No, and probably not.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,ChopperSmith,4.42,"Poured from a chilled 750ml bottle into a tulip glass.  Appearance - A slightly hazy pale golden color. Small foamy head that retained about 1/4 inch and laced nicely.  Smell - Spicy, fruity and yeasty. The trifecta for a Saison style. Very nice nose on this one.  Taste - Slightly sweet, but dry. Nice and crisp with a good blend of hops and yeast. A little hops bite on the tounge on the finish. Overall a very delicious Saison...right up there with Saison Dupont for me.  Mouth Feel - Crisp with just the right amount of carbonation.  Drinkablity - Very drinkable and a reasonable ABV. Could easily do a session with this one, and I have s3everal times. Very good American interpretation of a Saison Farmhouse style.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,MVotter,4.7,"The Ommegang Hennepin pours into a pils glass a cloudy, light-gold. It yields a towering white head which, even when settled, is a generous two fingers tall. It leaves a good bit of clingy lace in it's wake as you drink it down.  The aroma is cloves, spices and yeast.  The taste runs in parallel with the aroma ... spices and clove right up front, sweet malts in the middle and the finish is a little tangy, tart. Very nice.  The mouthfeel is incredibly effervescent, a Belgian all the way, med/heavy gravity, ... bubbles, bubbles, bubbles ... hehe.  Hennepin is a very drinkable dry brew.

Smells of clove, lemon, banana and gigner with Belgian sophistication (read yeast funk) and sugary wort. Smells farmish.  Aggressive taste: cracker malt with spicey versus tart balance and a dry tequila-esque umph in the middle. Mild orange juice fade. Crisp carbonation practically throws flavors on the pallette.  Has that hard to find balance between complexity and drinkability. Good stuff.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Terrifically inviting.  T - Lots of tangy layers here. The wheat, hops, and yeast all impart different but complementary levels of flavor. Again, lots of banana, pear, papaya working alongside the bready yeast and the floral notes.  M - Crisp and refreshing. The yeasty, bready flavors make for a surprisingly filling brew.  D - Lots of dynamic yeast action here. I could probably drink another bottle of this in one sitting, but I would certainly take it slow - this is the kind of brew that rewards the drinker who takes his/her time.

There's a hint of citrus and some mild bitterness before a clean finish. There's not a hint of that 7.7% alcohol anywhere; this is one easy drinking beer.

Some floral undertones ride underneath the main aromas.  Taste starts out spicy, but it's not overwhelming, in fact, it's very inviting. Some lemon and grain notes hits in the middle. Finish is spicy with a little bit of hops making their presences known. It's all balanced and inviting.  Mouthfeel was medium with lots of carbonation. Feels good.  It's wonderful all around.

Pours a hazy yellow gold colour, with a lovely, frothy, crackling head of white foam. Loose-bubbled though it is, it sticks around for quite a while. Nice.  Nice sweet lemon citrus, funk and grassy organics on the nose, lots of pleasant acidity to create a thoroughly refreshing aroma. Some light yeast notes come through as the head collapses, grounding the beer a little more. Very nice indeed.  Gritty organic bitterness on the palate, initially sharp, but with that sweet citric note coming through on the rear. Very clean and crisp. Sparkling and effervescent, which adds some great refreshing notes to the brew.  Clean, crisp and refreshing. A pleasure to drink, and a fantastic alternative to cold pale lager for a summer beverage. The 7.5% might take hold after a while, though.  This is an excellent Saison.

I always like a loud pop from my beer!  This beer produced one to two fingers of bubbly, sticky, and creamy foam. The body was a delicate cloudy yellow with a slight bit of orange hues noticed in different lighting.  The nose was simple...bready with a nice bit of lemons and bananas. A bit musty, but not overpowering.  Wow! This is very light and refreshing! Very yeasty with a slighty funky finish...most comparable to pineapple. A very balanced flavor that contained a touch of nuts.  Perfection on this mouthfeel...light and cramy!  With the alcohol nowhere in sight, this could easily be the goto saison. Although I haven't had very many yet, this is one for quaffing in my opinion...but also one that is great to watch it change dimensions as it warms.  I definitely want to see what age can do to it.

42,141,jwheeler85,4.54,"750ml poured into my beloved Unibroue tulip glass  A- Golden yellow / orange hue. Light, but tall head quickly diminished to a thin layer of residual head.  S- Definitely getting some orange peel and coriander. A slightly detectable sweet almost honey like smell behind all the spices.  T- Starts of mostly sweet, light malts coming through. Then the spices start to develop, nothing overwhelming, but you know they are there. Getting more of the coriander / clove notes than citrus. A slight bitterness begins to build at first barely noticeable, then getting stronger as it progresses towards the back of the tongue. It's almost more of an astringent and slightly sour bitter flavor. A fairly quick and dry finish. Flavors took about 10 seconds to fully play out after each sip.  M- This seems like a medium bodied beer that desperately wants to be lighter. The carbonation gives this illusion as each sip held for a few seconds feels effervescent as the CO2 dances on the tongue.  O- Complex, but not too complex. Seems to have been a great choice for a refreshing beer on this hot day. Personally, I think that it has more to offer in the aroma than it does in taste. Definitely a fun time and not too expensive (750ml for $7.50). The bottle will be super-glued to my wall shortly.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,charlatan,3.56,"Pours cloudy with a frothy head, like pineapple juice but with a slightly more amber hue. The nose is unspectacular: banana and chalk.  The beer is well carbonated but smooth on the tongue. It tastes sweet and creamy with hints of lemon and maybe a little pineapple. Reminds me of stewed fruit with cream. I don't taste much in the way of spice here. Certainly doesn't remind me of clove cigarettes!

42,141,melagnus,4.74,"Unlike Father Hennepin (where the name of the beer originates from!), I was not the first to lay eyes on this Saison, though I am sure grateful I did!  A - Straw to Pale Straw in color (SRM 6) with a haziness (bottle conditioned) that only deepens when finishing off the bottle. The foam is frothy white and slowly recedes with little lacing. Carbonation seems high, which probably contributes to the long head retention. Yeast sediment clings to the bottom of the glass after final pour.  S - An arousing peppercorn aroma by way of phenol fills the room upon first flow, though allows for a barnyardy and citrusy orange notes to come through upon bringing the stemmed wine glass closer to the nose. The peppercorn scent predominates, though by no means in a way that is uncharacteristic of the style.  T - Peppercorn, baryardy and slightly citrusy on the palate. The year and carbonation quickly rouses the taste-buds and asks for more! Slight warmth comes by way of the high alcohol, thereby making this a Strong Saison (6.5% - 9.5% ABV) by classification, though not a Belgian Specialty Ale.  M - Slight creaminess with a crisp finish. Carbonation tickles the tongue and leaves a dry yet magical finish.  C - Tantalizingly drinkable and very much to style. Paired incredibly well with a French-style Triple Cream cheese stuffed in Pepperdews (the red varietal pairs nicer with the cheese than the orange one did, though the orange Pepperdew offered a more sweet-acidic flavor than did the red). La Brea Whole Grain bread (purchased at Whole Foods) was delectably utilized as a pairing as well, with aforementioned cheese and Trader Joe's Artichoke Antipasto® to finish off the aperitif. Of course another whole grain bread with lots of density and nuttiness would work just as well! Caribbean-style Halibut burgers and a fresh garden salad with tomato, sprouts, balsamic vinegar and oil, cracked pepper and avocado made up the main course.  Easily one of the very best beers I've had in my lifetime!  Prost!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Carbonation is quite active and holds up a soapy white cap that doesn't retain particularly, but leaves a fair amount of lace.  S: Musty at first. As my nose lingered, I picked up straw, plus a healthy dose of pepper and clove. A small amount of cinnamon was also present.  T: Quite spicy overall. Dry malts are there, but masked by a generous spicy bitterness. Pepper and clove provide most of the spice flavor. The yeast is in the back lending a light sourness to the proceedings. Finishes slightly tart and semi-dry.  M: Medium light body is grainy. The carbonation level felt high to me.  D: This beer certainly goes down easily enough. I'm starting to realize that Saison isn't one of my favorite beer styles, but I still feel Hennepin is a great example of one.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,markaberrant,3.66,"A - golden, clear, huge white head (cork went flying when started to pull it), tons of carbonation, leaves lots of sticky lace behind  S - bananas, fruit, spice, hay, grassy hop  T - more sweet banana, light pepper/spice, not much hop flavour, more in the bitterness, but still not a lot, aftertaste is sweet banana  M - highly carbonated, very fluffy and airy, not much crispness, low alcohol warmth  D - this is a good beer, but does not remind me at all of a saison/ farmhouse ale  This has a lot more in common with a Belgian Blonde or Tripel than a Saison. Lots of banana, not enough hops, and doesn't finish dry enough, or crisp enough to keep it refreshing. It is still a very good beer, just not at all what I was expecting.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,kirok1999,3.72,"Damn, what a massive, fluffy white head that lasts forever! Tons of carbonation bubbles yet they don't show up in the taste. Smells like a nice mix of butterscotch, caramel and earthy funk. Tons going on here! Tastes much denser that it appears. Lots of earthy funk, a bit of lime, grapes and a bit of musk. Very dry finish and a smooth drinkability. A really complex beer. Thanks to DannyS for the extra in a trade.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Natural510,4.83,"Pours a HUGE fluffy white head which ever-so-slowly dissipates while leaving a cloud floating above the drink. Nice crystal golden color. Smells lagerish (to me): light malts, grain and essence of hops. Main difference being the high yeast note expected from any Belgian-style brew. Inviting. Breaded flavor at the forefront from a biscuit malt, yeast and hop grain. Hops seep in to provide a surprising kick without overpowering the brew. Yeast gradually dominates the back end of the flavor creating a dry, puckering finish. Slight lemon note and an overall sweet & sour character. Very well balanced and inviting for more. Crisp, easy-drinking with a dry finish in the mouth.  What else can I say but, wow. This is my first saison and I'm debating whether to try any others as it may ruin this first experience. Great job by Ommegang for creating such a complex yet simple tasting brew.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,TLove,3.37,"750 ml into a glass tumbler.  Appearance is pervasively murky and orange/yellow depending on the light.  Smell is citrusy, with a resiny tang. The alcohol is strong, but doesnt hold up so much in the smell as in the taste.  Taste is basically like a bleached blonde with the alcohol content of a saison. Grainy, but not grainy enough. Unfiltered and a tad sweet.  Like other saisons I've had, the taste doesnt roll off your tongue, but rather to the back of your mouth and straight up your nose.  It finishes well with a touch of plum sweetness and tartness, like a grilled apricot soaked in scotch.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,LyonsHead,4.42,"A: Pours a murky yellow with big, bubbly, almost champagne like head. Head sticks around for a long time, no lacing.  S: Great yeast character of citrus and honey. there is an earthy grassy character here as well  T: much like it smells, lemon and honey. earthy notes and then back to the citrus which lingers just a bit after the swallow and leaves you wanting another sip right away  M: Smooth and rather creamy due to the higher levels of carbonation which usually annoys me as it gets in the way of the taste, but here it works well.  D: This is one of my favorite Belgians to date. Great rendition and readily available which makes it even better.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,OnThenIn,4.18,"Appearance: Two fingers of beautiful white fluffy head that dissipates into rockyness. Some lacing. It is nice and straw yellow, but is somewhat cloudy.  Smell: Fruit and some banana smell. A little bit of spice in the nose as well.  Taste: Some fruit and lemon flavors in this beer. Definitely some grain sweetness. There may be some spice flavor to this one as well. I can completely taste yeast in this beer. Just an overall solid flavor.  Mouthfeel: This beer has a light/medium body to it and is very well carbonated. In almost any other beer I think that it would be considered over carbonated, but it works in this beer so perfectly. It adds a certain crispness to the beer.  Drinkability: I could drink this beer all day.

Smell: Light aromas of sweet fruits like grapes and it's very yeasty as well; there is a bit of a spicey scent coming through, but not especially strong in the nose.  Taste: The spices are much more potent in the flavor and are really the first thing that I notice - I would say the standard Belgian-esque spices of coriander and nutmeg; there is a very sweet yeasty flavor as well. The nice sweet and sour fruits are there as well, and, like the smell, I would go with the light clean taste of grapes.  Mouthfeel: Massive carbonation keeps it very prickly; a very slight coating initially but it finishes pretty clean and light -- leaving the mouth a little watery wanting some more.  Drinkability: I would say especially high. This is a great tasting beer that is light and refreshing, as well as especially flavorful.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

The head has fantastic retention with very nice lacing to it. Outstanding flavor with notes of vanilla, lemon, and hay funkiness. There's a pleasant bit of hop bitterness at the end. This is a beer that I think is fantastic, but can't put my finger on why exactly. Does funky lemony vanilla hay sound good? Well no, but drink it sometime and you'll find that it actually tastes fantastic. The beer has such a nice smooth drinkability and alcohol is very well hidden.

Appears a cloudy bright yellow color with a healthy two fingers of fluffy white foam. Smells and tastes of spicy peppery yeast, lemon, pear, green apples and grassy grains. Moderately carbonated to say the least, with a medium to full body. Crisp, dry and quenching, one of the world's perfect food beers.

I had never had it before, but ¨if Duvel made it, I´m thinking it will not disappoint.¨ Wow, it really didn´t! It poured a beautifully dull golden color that became very clear as the head developed. And what a head! Right there with Duvel on that! Excellent, white, sticky head. I found myself re checking the bottle to be sure it was made in America. The smell is spicier and more peppery than I had expected with some definite sweet fruitiness. Still new to reviewing, so I don´t have a better description than that. I was having a NY Strip and some vegetables, and this tasted absolutely wonderful with that. It was citrus, honey, yeast and pepper tasting with the hops coming in at the end of the taste. Hennepin feels very smooth in the mouth. A bit thicker in consistency than I was expecting, but not at all in a bad way. A nice difference from the Belgians I usually have. Still very crisp and very very drinkable. About three dollars less per 750 mL bottle than the true Belgians with every bit as much quality. I will definitely have this again and recommend Hennepin to friends!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

The head doesn't dissipate as quickly as expected.  Smell: Smells of slightly tart fruits. There is definitely some mustiness to this farmhouse ale. The tangy notes almost overwhelm the nose; this might be some of the phenols pushing through.  Taste: Very carbonated. Mild lemon flavors jump to the forefront. The tartness isn't quite as high as the nose would cause one to expect. The maltiness isn't very prevalent. The spicy flavors balance out the tartness well.  Mouthfeel: This beer has a medium-bodied mouthfeel. The beer slowly moves to the back of the tongue, but after a few seconds, the taste is completely gone.  Drinkability: This is a very good farmhouse ale. It's definitely shocking that this beer is brewed in the U.S. This beer is quickly becoming a staple in this house.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Possible peppery scent with mild overtone of sweetness. Slight grain aroma also.  T: Very crisp with a nice smooth flavor. Hard to break down because of its complexity. Ever so slightly spicy and very mild sweetness that lingers in the background. Aftertaste is like mild lemon and fruit tartness. Nothing overboard but very well ballanced.  This is excellent!!! I never understood why people spoke highly of Ommegang until I tried this style. It is a better version of the parent Duvel standard brew.

Very slight apple like flavor, and possibly grapefruit. Nice spicy/hoppy bite on the finish. So many different flavors, it is hard to separate them all.  I really like this one.

Non-IPA style hops lead off with a citrus-spice, transitioning with lively carbonation to a clove/bread mixture, and finishing with just a hint of heat. Also a fair amount of champagne character and flavor. Could do with slightly less clove.

42,141,Riccymon,3.65,"Pours a cloudy golden orange color from the bottle with a half inch of soap bubble head that boils away after a couple minutes. First smell brought with it a hint of skunk, but after that I found a mix of tripel/Belgian pale aromas--orange, pear, grassiness, and a spicy pepper note. Taste is similar to the smell, but tastier and with a nice alcohol presence. If the label didn't say otherwise, I would probably have classified this as a tripel. The finish contains apple flavors and mild hops.  Mouthfeel is a little spicy and there's a tart bitterness to the finish. The alcohol suits the mouthfeel and flavors, and while it is a refreshing brew, the nearly 8% ABV doesn't make this the most drinkable of beers. Interestingly, I remember the Hennepin I had on tap as a little fruitier. Nevertheless, this is a great offering from Ommegang, and I'd think about returning to it again when I'm in the mood for a Belgian.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

After trying several prominent saisons, I figured I go back to one of the first I tried and give it another look.  Beer is a dark, hazy yellow with a feverish carbonation that spun upward like a tornado, packing a mammoth, pillowy white head.  Scent of lemon and sour mash permeate this summery beer, reminding me of the smell of fruit soaked in alcohol. Flavors are of the tart variety, featuring citrus fruit taste with the pleasant spiciness that makes saisons distinctive. Taste is quite well balanced and notes of cinnamon and banana tickle the throat as it goes down.  Beer hits the tongue beautifully, not overpowering with sourness, but not masking the true nature of the beer with sweetness. It never becomes too tart to consume and it is definitely a saison that can be sipped all day in the hot summer sun.  One of the best examples of the style and a great little number from Ommegang.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Sweet and fruity, not unlike cheap champagne, with apple, pear, and light fruit aromas with some very light spice and earthy hops aromas.  T: Apple, pear, and other fruity esters are present with a medium-tart finish. There is a nice earthiness from a spicy hops and clove as well. The yeastiness is there but light and not overbearing. Alcohol is nicely warming.  M: Medium body but the lively carbonation lends a light feel to this fine brew. Aftertaste is light and fruity with a touch of spiciness.

Pour is a strong dark orange, very cloudy and- as it was for my experience- very, extremely carbonated (maybe it was shaken up by the trip back)- with a shiny, thick white head to slowly dissipate and leave a thick and firm lacing on the sides of the glass- a good, yeasty sign IMO.  Nose is citrusy, i honestly expected it to be sweeter as per the appearance but it was rather neutral, sourish at times and rather spicy, ranging around a grapefruit, cumin-ish feel.  Taste was quite good, although much as the smell, it wasn't as sweet as i'd thought it would be; albeit nice, it felt like an unsweetened, clementine taste with a very dense body and quite a full alcohol background making it fairly complex and tasty. not to bitter at the end, and not excessively sour throughout.  In the end the beer is a fine saison, very much like Dupont in the sweetlesness quite inviting to explore this style to a fuller extent.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Look: A warm and inviting golden yet opaque appearance with greater than average head and lace retention.  Nose: I thought I smelled an orange-and-hop combination. Quite pleasing aroma none the less.  Taste: The flavor seemed to effloresce in my mouth like a sunflower bursting into bloom. Again orange and hops is how I tasted it.  Mouth: Creamy delicious.

Spices, orange, and grape. I'm not liking the grape, but it's mild, and doesn't detract too much. It feels great, if a little too carbonated for my taste.  Overall, I find it delightful, and I could drink it all night.  (Note: This is for the 7.7% ABV 750ml bottle.

The nose has a grainy straw-like character that I find to be pretty common in belgian style beers. There is a nice structure to the flavor. The foam on the head lends itself to really ""creaming up"" the mouthfeel.

S - Lots of subdued flavors going on here: Honey, sweetness, hay, damp wheat, and ginger. That is complex and awesome! Earthy a bit too.  T - Complex to the max! Ginger ale flavor with a dry wheat, honey, and a slight citrusy hoppiness. Complex yet not at the same time, weird!  M - Soda. Exactly like ginger ale soda. So much carbonation it gives it a bite.

I will likely be biased in that I've drank this quite a bit and feel that it may be the best beer I've had. I'm sure there are threads in the forum on the subject, but if I was forced to pick a single beer to be stuck on a desert island with, this would be the one. Pours a hazy, yet bright gold with a tinge of orange. The head is nice and fluffy with plenty of carbonation oozing beneath. Smell is somewhat typical to the Belgian style yeast with hints of lemon, grass, and a touch of bubble gum. I don't know how to explain it, but you do get a sense of earthiness in the smell and taste. Taste is magnificent. The 7.5 abv is unnoticeable. I think saisons were typically made in the winter to be enjoyed the following summer, but it would take more willpower than I have to wait those precious months for this beer to mature. Thank goodness for modern refrigeration! Also, I've read a few reviews perhaps complaining of too much carbonation, but I feel that it is in perfect harmony with this brew.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

The first smells are yeast and honey, followed by cloves. There are also citrus notes, very lemony.  Wow, this is delicious. This is the first time I've had this and I'm thoroughly impressed. I've had a couple other from Ommegang that I enjoyed, but this may take the cake. The nose is all lemon and pepper, but after the swallow this bursts with a ton of other flavors, specifically banana, clove, and honey. The transition from spicey to sweet is simply amazing. Very unique.  The body is medium-full and smooth. Good carbonation that is crisp and clean. The pepper and cloves sting the tongue slightly, then the sweetness tones it down.  I was shocked to learn the abv for this one. I couldn't taste it at all. It's delicious, smooth, refreshing, and intriguing.

There's not a single bubble visible within the head just a puffy layer of white. Great retention on the head that is visible the for the entire drink, supported by a very strong stream of bubbles. Just looking at this one is mouthwatering.  S: Smells wheaty with strong traces of citrus along with caramel and apples.  T: Very wheaty with strong Belgian yeast. Strong caramel and honey, citrus, clove, and apples with a bit of pear and possibly the slightest amount of banana. Dry slight floral hop finish. Fairly complex and well balanced flavors do a great job of masking the alcohol up till the very end. I had originally given this one a 4 in taste, but after the second one I had I was able to appreciate it a lot more. Serve this one around 50-55ish, the flavor comes out sooo much more and is 10x more enjoyable.  M: Stays strongly carbonated the entire drink, very smooth and crsip. Perfect.

Faint hint of malt, but definitely not the focus of the beer. Beer finishes dry and crisp. Though a high ABV beer alcohol is well hidden and only begins to appear after beer has warmed considerably.

S- Smell is yeasty, with dry fruit and caramel malt in the background  T- Yeasty to start, then the malt kicks in with a nice caramel flavor, some hops add a spicy sting, then it finishes with a dry yeasty flavor and heat from the alcohol  M- This is a lighter bodied beer than other similar high gravity brews. High carbonation as well, but there also is a certain hardness to it, this must be from the carbonates or other minerals in the water.

42,141,Arbitrator,3.65,"Chilled bomber into a glass.  A: Pours a cloudy straw color with active bubbling up the glass. Creates a nice, long-lived, foamy 1"" off-white head. Leaves nice walls of lacing down the glass during a drink.  S: Bananas, lemony citrus, wheat, brett funk, a little barnyard / hay mustiness. At the right temperature, this is just a powerful bouquet and delicious to smell.  T: Wheat, lemon, and biscuit malt dominate the taste, with only a mild banana component in the background. The mid-taste sees mostly wheat with a slight smattering of clove spice. This progresses to a slightly tart/sour finish with a noticeable earthy undercurrent to it.  M: Thin-bodied, with active champagne-like effervescence. Well-masked ABV, with no burn to it. A clean, dry finish -- maybe leaning toward crisp.  D: I've had some outstanding saisons. This is in the middle of the pack, but it's a good option when I can't get the ones that I have to trade for.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,biegaman,4.39,"Hennepin has a very Champagne-esque appearance - consistent streams of carbonation and an anemically pale shade of yellow. The head is bounteous and creamy, continuously growing from a steady contribution of bubbles. A light haze distorts clarity but transparency prevails nonetheless. This, itself, looks like a sunny day.  The aroma is musty in a sort of barnyard kind of way. Abounding are notes of farmhouse straw, fresh squeezed lemon, spicy phenols, and under-ripe orchard fruits. It is a charming blend of musty and zesty, grainy and fruity. When my nose dips into that glass it doesn't resurface for quite some time.  The flavours are simple and straightforward - wheat, bread, grains accompanied by a sprinkling of spice and citrus zest. The taste of roses and additional floral notes arise. Flavours of under-ripe fruits - green apple, pear, peach - are also noted. Grains, tang and spice all make equal contributions and combine for a balanced, flavourful beverage.  The carbonation is rather effervescent. Little bursts of bubbles pin-prick the roof of the mouth on each sip. The beer is tremendously refreshing and it's peppery (mustard seed-like?) spice and citrusy fruity esters blend in an intricate manner that becomes only more so with warmth.  In terms of a refreshing, sociable drink that could be shared amongst guests, this really does make a valid substitute for sparkling wine. It would make a great welcoming drink and its effervescence makes it a suitable aperitif as well. This bridges the world of beer drinkers and non-beer drinkers on the agreeable grounds of undeniable quaffability.  Ommegang will tell you that Hennepin is suited to every season but I'd insist it's absolutely ideal for spring and summer. Wait for a hot, sunny day and sit yourself down with a big bottle of this stuff. Find shade under a tree, nestle up with a good book or share it over a meal with family and friends at the table. But don't just take my word on it...try it for yourself!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Halcyondays,4.38,"On-tap at Beachwood BBQ,  A: Pours a cloudy yellow, with a full white head, lots of lace.  S: Yeast notes and ester, light fruit.  T: Yellow apple and definite herbal notes (sage) carry the beer. Mild acidity, quite complex.  M: Medium-bodied, quite refreshing, smooth.  D: One of my favourite saisons, I can't believe I haven't reviewed it yet. This and LA Red Barn are the top 2 easily available American saisons in my opinion.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,coalcracker,4.42,"Appearance: Pours a even golden color with a good amount of foamy head, carbonation is very active as bubbles continue to rise from the bottom of the glass. Head does disappear halfway through the first glass. Smell: Mild tones of spice (clove)and earthy yeast; dark fruits quite noticeable. Taste: Spicy, mildly bitter bite at first taste, followed by essences of tart fruit (plum and pineapple to a lesser degree). Malts are a bit 'biscuit-like'. Finish is fairly dry and clean. Overall moderate alcohol warmth. Mouthfeel: Medium mouthfeel belies a little spicy zing on the tongue. Drinkability: Best appreciated as a sipper, as this beer is enjoyably complex. Nonetheless, easy drinking and clean with deceptive strength.  Great effort by Ommegang! Can't wait to review Three Philosophers.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Heads settles, but leaves tightly bubbled lacing throughout the glass during consumption  S - Tart, fruity smell of green apples, coriander, banana, and spices. Yeasty and a little peppery.  T - Damn fine... Good mix of the tart fruitiness, well spiced. The alcohol is noticeable here - I think the taste could be improved with a toned down abv.  M - Carbonation runs wild, but the beer covers the palate well and is crisp and refreshing  D - Very refreshing beer, leaves you wanting at least one more.

42,141,damienblack,4.3,"Hooray for my 100th crappy review!  Pours shimmery gold in color into my Ommegang tulip, carbonation is free-flowing to the top. Hazy apple-brown, like a cloudy macro-lager or apple juice/sparkling cider. Just a little too dark and cloudy to be champagne. Nice foamy head at the top. Smells like a vineyard, a slightly fruity mustiness (or maybe the barrel room, rather) and yeastiness.  Overall: Light, crisp, refreshing, and a nice sweet/sour balance. On first swallow, all I get is a real earthy taste, with a little green apple/pear, a little barnyardy, but it isn't until a couple seconds have passed that the flavors of the beer really come out. This is when the tart funkiness starts to come out, not so much as some beers I've had, it does't really taste like ""horse blanket"" or anything like that. But it is deliciously tart, and the tartness stays on the palate without the dank earthyness. Very light body, crisp and ephervescent. I'd say it's only off-dry, not as dry as some others I've had, and that is a positive impact here. After a bit it starts to stick to the tongue. I can see why this is such a well-regarded saison. Everyone should give this a go, especially when the mood for something lighter strikes.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Sweet, grainy malts. There was also some sweet fruits, noticeably grape and cherry coming through.  M - light, crisp, and refreshing. Pretty decent mouthfeel to it.  D - this was a pretty excellent ale, especially for the price. I will definitely purchase again since it is so light and crisp, yet delicious.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Fits the style of a Saison / Farmhouse Ale. Mouth feel is smooth and crisp with a very high carbonation level. Tastes of earthy malt up front, slight banana flavors next, slight hop background, and some tart malt. A real nice blend of flavors, with only a hint of dryness. I would definitely recommend this brew.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,grayburn,4.48,"Hennepin pours a beautiful gold with a huge white head that stays in the glass long after the beer is gone...but then again a beer like this goes a bit too quickly. The smell is subdued fruits, nice belgian yeast floral and fruity. Some light hopping in there. The taste is very multi-dimensional, it starts somewhate subtle with light apricot and peach flavors, then comes through with a touch of citrus hop aroma. It is finished with just a touch of sweetness, but the overall effect is very dry like a good champagne. The mouthfeel is superbly refreshing, crisp and clean. Not much sweetness or bitterness to combat, this beer is incredibly subtle.

42,141,thirdeye11,4.63,"Presentation: Poured from a corked and caged 750ml into a Duvel tulip. I see no dates on the bottle.  A: Pours a beautiful opaque orange color with 3 fingers of head that recedes very slowly. This beer laces REALLY well on my glass, and the yeasty floaters are a welcome addition without overcrowding the glass.  S: Smells of pears, sour apple but mildly so, yeast is present. I love the smell of this beer. One of my favorites for sure.  T: The pear and sour apple are present, but not really sour from a taste perspective as much as it is in the smell. The yeast really comes through here, but not bready and heavy like many belgian-style beers. It's clean tasting, and reminds me occasionally of a hefeweizen style without as much of the banana and clove flavors. They are still present though.  M: Creamy, bubbly, and coats my mouth almost as well as any beer out there.  D: Off the charts for me. I drank a full 750ml of this last night without batting an eye, and probably could down 2 of the bombers in a night. Never tastes bitter, too sweet, or too hoppy. Everything is balanced for me.  Overall one of my favorite beers. I often forget to buy it, but should because it's 60-80% of the cost of most Belgians I like just as much. Highly recommend this one if you've never had it. This beer would be good for ANYONE who likes beer in even the slightest respect.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,macktbone,4.08,"This was purchased on sale $5.99 (great price for a bomber) at Monument liqour. It was recommended so after having other Ommegang's I had to try it.  Looks great. A real bright colored unfiltered ale. Looks highly carbonated and the head sits nicely upon the sweet looking beverage.  Smells like a summer day. Realy bright fruits and a little alcohol edge. I get a hint of light wood and some funk.  Much tarter than I expected. I like the freshness of the flavor and the after taste really hangs on. It almost tastes like a heavier belgian without the caramel underlyings. This has a medium sweet middle to it that fades to a soapy aftertaste.  Standard mouthfeel.  Although this rivals some of the other Saisons I have had, the alcohol taste is too promenant for 7.7%. If they were trying to hide a 10 or 11.5% sleeper in a farmhouse ale I might forgive 'em, but at 7.7 it should taste like a sweet dream. I would recommend this to others, but not if their favorite was a saison. They would pick it apart.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,rpstevens,3.8,"The beer pours a cloudy straw color with a very large foamy white head. Nice lacing that slides down the sides of the glass slowly, in a very lazy manner.  The beer smells at first like banana but each time I smell it I get a little something extra, some flowery aromas and an earthy smell underneath, but also very crisp spices.  The taste is sweet and malty to start with a rush of citrus at the finish. The banana is not as present in the taste as the smell, but the taste has much more balance between sweet and sour than I expected. The taste finishes with a very earthy bread flavor that mellows the whole thing out.  Hennepin feels crisp and light in the mouth. The carbonation is perfect for this style of beer with it's spices and fruity tones, it's not overpowering at all.  This beer reminds me of summertime at every turn, it looks bright and light, it smells of fruit and flowers and it has a crisp taste and mouthfeel that are perfect for the warm weather.

42,141,dotsonjamesg,3.83,"This is my first Saison but I have enjoyed other similar ales. I've always been a fan of Belgians, Dubbels, Trippels, and Quads. Though the flavors are a little different, I was told this is right up my alley. My style of choice is RIS mostly but I often look for other stuff to keep my taste buds fresh. I bought this at Springhill Liquor in North Little Rock, AR.  Poured in a 14oz wide mouth wine glass 2008 Bottle  Appearance: Poured a Pale yellow with a thick, three-finger, rich and creamy white head. Nice lacing and good retention. The head dissipates slightly but stays long after the pour, as if my beer has been topped off with whipped cream. Haven't seen that before.  Smell: Sweet malts light fruity notes and some stinky earthy tones. Smells similar to much of the Belgian styles I have enjoyed in the past but I think this is a little more aromatic.  Taste: The taste is pretty, sweet and sturdy yet delicate. The flavor is new to me, its like tasting a lovely perfume of a passerby. Its bitter and spicy with some fruity notes but its hard to really pick out specific flavors. If I had to pick, I'd say banana with a hint of strawberry. The brew is pretty damn good and enjoyable.  Mouthfeel: The carbonation is pretty light, almost too light. Kind  Drinkability: This brew impresses me but its not my personal brew of choice. I would definitely recommend it to others but I don't think I would buy it again, not because it isn't worthy, its just not my personal preference. My only problem with this brew is that it came with only 7.7% ABV. Not enough for the money in my opinion. Indeed, I buy for quality but its still nice to get a good buzz off of a good beer.

Huge white head, and lacing down the glass almost on par with a stout. Very nice looking. Smelled like an excellent German hefe, with lots of bananas and cloves in the nose. Taste was awesome, with more of the same flavors and some wheat and bubble gum flavor mixed in. Very light on the palate. Didn't even notice the abv. Very easy to drink, as a saison should be. Better than most Belgian or French versions I've tried in the past. I should drink this more often.

S: Citrus, hops and some sweet malts; undeniable spice on the nose. T: I'll break this part into two. The first half: Sweet start and a bitter finish. Wheaty and spicy, rounding out with yeasty, hoppy and eventually a baked/biscuity flavor as it warms slightly. Only a few minutes after that, earthy flavors pull through majorly. Eventually my palate was overrun with grass, metal and blood. Or so it tasted. I loved the first half of this beer, but I was not a fan of it as it had a chance to warm a bit. M: Love the carbonation and spice combo. Lighter, refreshing body and just a touch or slightly bitter residue left on the palate. D: This beer is as refreshing as any wheat...in the beginning anyways. I thought there was a serious breakdown of flavors near the end, so much so that I thought someone threw a farm into a blender and served it to me.

The beer has an awesome creamy head that mixes nicely with a fruity, spicy wheat taste. Tastes like it smells. The balance of this beer is amazing.

This pours a slightly hazy (much clearer than SD) gold with a nice white head that sits high above the rim of the glass. Smells are floral, yeasty, with an almost selzer-like element. A bit phenolic but not in a bad way. Tastes completely different than SD but is still out of this world. Tastes of a rich blend of green apples, pineapples. Finish is quicker and dryer than SD, and doesn't punch you with citrusy zest. Hennepin is pretty suave. I'd consider SD's equal except that its body lacks that electric tingle owing (I assume) to less carbonation. This beer is fabulous and proves once again that Ommegang is an amazing brewery.

The head becomes a bit rocky and irregularly chunky as it slowly dissipates.  S: A definite musty, yeasty, phenolic/medicinal aroma that is calm but confident. Loads of juicy, fruity notes, mostly apple I'd say. Some mild graininess. A bit spicy and faintly sour. Some alcohol is noticeable as it warms.  T: Quite juicy and fruity - very nice. Tart apples, some vinous/grape, and faint banana flavors. Rather yeasty as well, with the sugary, honeylike phenolic notes evident in the aroma. An appealing musty sweetness that makes itself known without becoming cloying. Some sour, vaguely citric hop flavor as well into the finish.  M: Medium bodied and surprisingly crisp, with active carbonation. A bit of slowly-developing dryness into the finish. Refreshing for such a complex, robust beer.  D: This is very, very tasty. It blends some flavors from several different styles in a very interesting and unique profile. Reasonably priced as well; around $6.50 for a 750mL bottle.

Aroma a spicy tartness with a hint of a sour side.  In the taste the sour side becomes more evident reminding one of wine - on the dry side. A moderate bitterness in the aftertaste. Well carbonated with alcohol somewhat apparent. Defiantly a robust body it gives you the idea of Flemish Sour without going completely there.  For me drinkability is moderate. If you would like to acquire the taste of a sour this saison may be a good place to start down that path. Probably best drank in the warmer months.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Slightly hazy, but for the most part clear and translucent. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to pour the yeast sediment into the glass, so I took the bottles instructions and ""poured slowly to not disturb the yeast."" Very lively carbonation, almost like champagne. Produces a thin milky white head that actually has impressive retention. Leaves a bit of interesting lacing patterns.  The nose reminds me of a tripel. Fruity, yeasty and spicey. No alcohol present on the aroma that I can tell. It's very light and reeks of Belgian goodness.  Ah the taste of a good Belgian beer. Admittedly, the taste also reminds me of a Tripel, but it is a little more fruity. I get green apples and green grapes and possibly a little pear taste. The clove shows itself more in the taste department than in the aroma. Once again, alcohol is all but non existent. It definitely has a warming quality, but it's hard to imagine a brew with 7.5% ABV that wouldn't. I welcome the warming, I think it adds character to the taste.  The mouthfeel is light and very crips. Tart as well. The lively carbonation is still chugging along at an alarming rate.  Overall, this is an excellent beer. I have a few in the cellar that I'm going to let sit for 6 - 12 months to see how they mature. Mostly experimental. I would enjoy this fresh any day.

A beautiful hazy gold color with lots of lively carbonation running up the glass into a foamy white head that's about an inch high. As I drank, it left a sticky layer of lacing on the glass.  Smells of citrus, wheat, and a few spices I cannot place.  Tastes great. First hits the tongue with a tart, fruity flavor similar to a sour apple or a light citrus. Then finishes with a small amount of spice followed by some crispness by alcohol, helped by the carbonation.  A fairly light beer with a high amount of carbonation, but that helps complement the flavors of the beer, in my opinion.  Overall, a very tasty beer that is perfect for summer weather.

S - To me is smells very similar to a Belgian Wit ale, I guess Saisons and Wits are close is style?? Either way it's a little less citrusy in scent but more spicy. Don't know which spices are used but it's very nice.  T - After smelling it I thought it was going to be very much like a Wit but I was a little off. This beer is much more tart than a Wit, which is very nice. Tastes much like a Belgian farmhouse ale! A little lemon/apple/yeast aftertaste...very complex.  M/D - Carbonation overload...which isn't a bad thing in this case. Paired with the flavors of this brew the carbonation compliments it nicely. Very rough on the palate given the carbonation but, again, works nicely.  This was my first Ommegang beer and I am quite pleased. For a beer brewed in New York they have out done themselves. Not quite as good as a true Belgian but it's definitely knocking on it's door! Very nice take on a hard beer style to master.

Taste: Smooth with some tart characteristics that are reminiscient of Granny Smith apples. A slight citrus acidity exists, but there was not any hint of coriander, clove, cinnamon or orange peel. A slight hop earthy hop character, but not much bitterness.  Overall: Quite different from the usual 750 ml bottles I've become used to. I feel somewhat let down since this is one of my favorite beers. May have to go buy a 750 ml for a side-by-side comparison.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Nice crisp bite to this with a little lingering bitterness and tartness... all good.  M: medium body, smooth dry and soft mouthfeel.  D: good, nose is a little off, but very drinkable for a 7.5 beer.  overall a very solid beer. Kudos!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,BierFan,3.76,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a cervoise. The label lists an abv of 7.5%.  Appearance: Fairly cloudy pale yellow. Big white head. The appearance reminds me of Unibroue Ephemere(Apple). The head never completely vanished.  Smell: Fresh tart apples, yeasty spiciness, and perhaps a little bit of an alcohol presence.  Taste: Very juicey and peppery. I wish there was more fruitiness to the taste. Alot like a tripel.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Thanby,4.35,"Mild straw color, kind of like apple juice. Smells of a mild malt with butter, cream and some spices. Flavor is full of wheat and cloves, smoothed out by a buttery flavor and with a bit of hops in the background. Nice body and flavor all the way through, easy to drink and just generally a good brew.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Appearance: Slightly cloudy gold/amber or straw color with initial ½ inch white head that disappears slowly leaving behind lacing on sides of glass and rim of foam around glass with thin layer of foam on surface.  Smell: Fruity (pear), a bit of alcohol and some complex spicyness (but hard to tell which spices)  Taste: Crisp, yeasty fruity (pear, a touch of green apples), some sourness.  Mouthfeel: Light bodied mouthfeel with steady low level of carbonation and a long finish with sweetness becoming dry.  Drinkability: Very pleasant. Reminds me a bit of a Tripel. One or two of an evening would be just fine.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,ruckzuck,4.12,"A - pours a clear, golden yellow with a massively frothy head. The head dissipated as I drank, but it was still as sight to behold. Watching the bubbles shoot up the glass is also nice  S - lots of sweet and slightly tart fruity notes enter the nostrils. Apple or pear comes to mind, along with a hint of banana. Definitely some Belgian yeastiness and a bit of funk. The aroma of bubblegum also comes to mind  T - very similar to the smell, and very enjoyable. The sweetness isn't cloying in the least, and the tart undercurrents are great. Delightful on the tongue  M - crisp with a nice amount of carbonation. Wakes the palate up in a great way  D - very nice; a classic saison through and through. I'm a big fan, and I'll have no trouble finishing the 750 mL with my lady.

S: planty, like leaves, slightly malty, slighty sweet. Beyond what my vocabulary has to describe it to be honest. Wow  T: Does not match the scent whatsoever. Still fantastic. Sweet on the tip of the tounge, slightly bitter on the sides.  M: Very nicely dances across the tongue and on the roof of the mouth. Seems to leave a lace on the tongue as it goes down.  D: Dangerous. I could spend a LOT of money on this. Goes down amazingly easily.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

A: Poured a slightly hazy golden color, with a solid white head that fades to a lace that lingers on the top right to the bottom.  S: A nice, crisp smelling malt note, with the typical Belgian-style yeast profile, a bit fruity and spicy. Nothing really surprising here, but that's okay.  T: Bright, crisp malts blended with a fruity, yeasty notes, and a slightly sour finish. The alcohol is nicely obscured in this one. Really an excellent beer flavor wise.  M: Typically thin mouthfeel, but that's fine. Carbonation is significant, with a constant stream of small bubbles rising to the top from the beginning of the glass to the end.  D: I could certainly drink the entire bottle. This is an excellent beer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

The smell is mostly yeast with hints of fruit (mostly green apple).  Its taste is overwhelming and complex. The beer starts with a funky yeast/fruit taste, then goes to a tart taste, and finishes with a crisp apple flavor. Its aftertaste is mixed with spice and apple.  The mouthfeel is pretty full with a light carbonation.  Overall it is a big beer, very complexed with a whole lot going on as far as flavor. It is definitely not for beginners. But this beer is without a doubt worth a try, a very fun beer to drink and breakdown.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,talkinghatrack,4.42,"a - Light pale yellow, opaque. Frothy two finger head.  s - Fruity, yeasty, some sour notes. No hints of alcohol.  t - One of the more sour beers I've had. Hits you right on the back underside of the tongue. Otherwise a light belgian taste with a sour aftertaste that requires just one more sip. Warming finish but no mouth numbing.  m - Light body but not entirely watery due to some malt action. Very carbonated but it seems to work in this setting.  d - I'm not quite used to the sour, especially sour without a powerful bitter alongside it. It's an energetic little brew. I see myself pouring to the end of this bottle quickly with no complaints. Great masking on its 8.5% ABV - if not for savoring the sour this stuff drinks like a light beer.

42,141,TheDoorman,4.42,"Pours a light transparent yellow, slightly cloudy but mostly transparent. Tons of carbonation apparent in the body. Tons. A smooth white head leaves nice lacing. Aroma is lemon, grass, bubble gum, pale malt sweetness and yeast. Taste mostly mirrors the scent, but with just a touch of tartness. A nice earthyness which matches the sweetness. Enough hops to make their presence known in the backdrop. Mouthfeel is perhaps a touch too carbonated, though that is fairly typical for the style. Smooth and refreshing. Alcohol barely noticeable. A great blend of sweetness and earthyness, and a touch of tart. Fantastic beer that can be enjoyed with any meal or at any time. An extremely versatile brew.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

42,141,bowersdm,3.15,"12 oz bottle poured into a nonic.  This is my first saison.  A - very, very light yellow color. This is probably the lightest beer I have ever seen. I had to stop after about 8 oz because the glass was going to overflow from the carbonation. Ten minutes later, I was able to finish the pour. The head was whitish and around 4cm tall. It was very lumpy also  S - fruit, yeast, some spices, definitely cloves.  T - this beer has absolutely no malt flavor to it (to me, at least), it is not the least bit sweet. very, very dry with a slight fruitiness. cloves are noticeable as are other spices. Very dry finish, not bitter, just dry. I guess that's what this type of beer is supposed to taste like, but I'm not really sure.  M - it was very thin, but I'm guessing that's normal for the style. It had a lot of carbonation too.  D - I didn't like it's dryness.  Note: I didn't like this beer at all. However, it's somewhat highly rated because it does exhibit the characteristics that the style description lists.

42,141,msubulldog25,4.27,"I fondly remember Hennepin as the first saison I ever tried (less than 4 years ago) and it blew me away back then. It's been a very long time, so this is like visiting an old friend. Got an imperial pint at Bailey's Taproom.  A: Bright golden, almost clear with little rising carbonation. Small snow-white head, strong lacing top to bottom. Not sure if the lack of carbonation is normal; I know this keg was tapped roughly a week ago, so it's still 'fresh'.  S: Spicy aroma with sweet yeasty roll. Apple core and pear slices. Hints of clove and melon.  T: Crisp apple, light honey, grass/hay. Buttery sweet rolls and a sharp spicing. Finishes out dry, with pepper and a slight medicinal chalkiness being most notable. Terrific balance.  M: Refreshing, lively carbonation. Body is light/medium; alcohol seems subdued, but grows with a subtle warmth. Finishes with a faint yeast/grain stickiness and a little chalky bitterness.  D: A high point - both extremely 'easy to drink' and notably desirable in the 'want to have again' categories. A fine example of the style, haven't had more than a couple US-made saisons that can compete.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

A slightly cloudy honey and tea was topped with an airy head that left a trace of lace  It was faint in the nose and not as available as I would like, but straw and spice with a hint of fruit.  What a beautifully flavored beer. Earthy with a hint of yeast and hops. The draw was the best part. Touches of honeydew, melon and orange! FABULOUS!

Unbelievable amounts of super fresh hops. Smells like bread dough rising, fresh picked hops, & fresh cut lemon grass. Some caramel, nuts, and hops.  Taste: Crisp hops, citrus, pine & crackers. Superbly smooth yet bitter hoppiness. Refreshing carbonation and awesome citrus / piney hops wake up your taste buds on a new level. The hop assault on your tongue lingers on.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, bubbly, awe inspiring crisp bitterness. Thick and juicy.  Drinkability: World class. Its superb by itself I can only imagine how good it will be with food.

42,141,darklordlager,4.35,"12oz. bottle acquired from the Coffee Grounds in Eau Claire.  Pours a straw yellow colour, very cloudy with a great 2"" head that sat like a rock.  Smell is funky. Sourness, white wine, booze, esters.  The first thing I notice about the taste is the dryness. Very dry, but leaves the mouth with a pleasant fruity taste. Alcohol is evident, but it remains a very smooth brew. A little sour bite at the end.  Mouthfeel is soft, medium-to-light.  Drinkability is solid. The dryness might limit it (if drinking it by itself). I bet it would go great with Fetuccine Alfredo...just might have to try that next time.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Ok, I smelled and smelled and smelled this with myself, some friends, and my mom (who has the nose of a bloodhound). This stuff smells like cooked strawberries, and then a bacon and pancake breakfast - like nothing I have ever experienced. Taste was a very very very good farmhouse, almost to the caliber of Avec Les Bons Voeux, but not quite, citrus was nicely balanced by malt. Very smooth mouthfeel, and drinkability is extremely high due to great taste and its feeling as a ""session"" beer. Good good stuff.

Appearance: Poured almost champagne like...half of the tulip was beer the other half was a white sudsy head. A hazy golden color that showed plenty of effervescence. The head had pretty good retention eventually receeding to about 3/4"". There was ample lacing, but nothing to write home about.  Smell: A subtle hoppiness that leads towards citrusy. I would say it is highly aromatic, I was standing at the table and the glass was sitting on the table, and the flowery aroma found my nose. There is a little hint of the alcohol.  Taste: Mineral tones and a spicyness that is not quite astringent. Somewhat bitter, or maybe I would lean towards tartness...much like lemon. There is a subtle metallic aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Light-bodied and full of carbonation. A little gaseous in my mind. There is a nice almost drying finish that I found interesting.  Drinkability: One 750mL is about all I would care to drink in one sitting. Not bad but a little filling and not exactly what I typically choose to drink. I do however appreciate the style and will continue to try new saisons. I believe this to be a very good representation of the style.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Pours an hazy unfiltered gold color with a nice rocky head. The glass I poured it in is great for capturing the scent but hurts lacing, so I won't penalize it for that.  Very interesting smell. I'm new to this style but at first sniff I thought bananas like Hefeweizen. But it has an spicy sort of smell as well.  Taste is fruity and peppery at the same time. Bananas, lemons, and spice. Dry finish and makes my mouth pucker a little.  Mouthfeel is carbonated though I couldn't see the bubbles. Prickly on the tongue and a little bit acidy.  Drinkability is good.

T - Wheat character continues to press on. A moderate level of bittering with floral hop flavor. Apple-like esters with a general fruity/estery character. Alcohol more present than expected for strength. Tartness, possibly from use of unmalted wheat. Very dry finish. Crisp.  M - Medium-bodied with a very high level of carbonation. Smooth.

42,141,itcomesnpints,4.62,"I did a blind taste test of this next to Saison Dupont and the Lost Abbey's Red Barn Ale.  An explosive white head quickly filled the glass. Underneath lay the translucently golden ale. Nice retention.  The smell was marvelously pungent, bringing forth candied orange peel, clove, and wildflower honey.  The taste was exceptional with wisps of clove, honey, apple cider and anise.  Hennepin has a higher abv than its competitors, yet managed to conceal it the best. The fizzy carbonation fit perfectly as well.  I've only tried these three saisons, but without a doubt I enjoyed Hennepin the most. With its lively carbonation it is a great beer to replace champagne with for those special occasions, and it also gets the job done on those extra hot summer days when a BA needs a cold one.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Light phenolics. Muted banana and wheat like twang. Spicy pepper in the back of my nose. It gets bigger as it warms.  Taste is knock it outta' the park good. Maltiness that recalls fresh French bread combined with a wheat malt flavor. Spicy and peppery as well. A touch of lemon and an herbal component that deepens the melage. Sharp but mild hops bring in the finish and blend into nuttiness. Dry, short and clean. There is a light sweet roll taste that lingers with nutty biscuits. Faint banana, and peppery spices.  Crisp and quenching mouthfeel is accented by a lively carbonation and tingly light creaminess.  Drinkability is so good you think session until the reality of the abv sets in.

Some yeast and bread, typical of many Belgians, with that funky tartness (a good band name?) and sligh kiss of grassy hops. The mouthfeel was light.

42,141,fingerlaker,4.77,"Wow.  Wow.  Wow.  That's all I can say. Phenominal.  Hennepin is my ""stand-by"" beer, so you could probably say that I am biased. If you believe so, stop reading my review. But I think my opinion is valid because I've had it 1,000,000,000 times, both in the conditioned bottle and on-tap.  Knowing that I must have a recent review to be valid, I went and got an imperial bottle of this from Wegmans (anybody who lives in the Rochester area knows about this store) and chilled it by letting it sit outside in the 4-degree weather for a wee bit. I poured it into a Brewery Ommegang glass.  The head rears up no matter how little you shake the bottle. Just get used to the idea of having a glass 3/4 full. The smell is funky, almost as if you're sitting in the middle of a cornfield. There are citrus notes from the flavoring hops, all of which are from the Czech Republic. Bubbles cascade upwards no matter how long it sits.  Now for the taste. It's dry and full, with a medium body and a present alcohol tone; immediatly commanding your mental faculties. The citrus-y flavor then hits, then the bitterness. Something I have noticed with the umptrillion times I've had this is that the flavors are very seperate and one notices them one-by-one, not all at once like many other Saisons.  After killing the whole 750-ml bottle, I'm pretty happy and require some time before I can drive, thanks to the 7.7% alcohol content.  My only gripe? Perhaps it's a bit too bitter. That's it.  It's not perfect, but damn close to it, and better than most of the actual Belgian Saisons and it's only $5.  P.S. Living just 2 hours from Cooperstown, I decided a road trip was in order. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have some of the best brews in this fine country of ours.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Great retention, tons of carbonation rising up to meet the head. Fairly large amount of lacing left. Great looking beer.  Aroma is outstanding. Smells of funky, slightly sour yeast with sweet underling of citrus fruits. Peppery hops as well. Extremely well balanced... wow. Very bready, almost a sourdough bread scent to it.  Taste is how it smells, but even better. The funk is there, the yeast, the citrus, the pepper, the sourdough... just exceptional. Like pepper soaked lemon rinds with a yeasty, biscuity, sourdough taste thrown right in the mix of it all. It's tart, sour, sweet, peppery all at the same time - and it works. Great tasting.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied and it's chewy and sticky on the palate. The true ""Farmhouse"" finish is excellent. Carbonation is high, but in a very good way. The drinkability is outstanding - could definitely see myself downing glass after glass of this by the pool during the summer. It's extremely refreshing.

42,141,mikesgroove,4.46,"Review #1500. For this one I chose a really solid american brew I had never had before. Go figure, after ll of this I had never had a Hennepin. So anyway, this lovely beer was served at cellar temp and poured into an oversized wine glass. Consumed on 01/05/2009.  Now if that was not the most perfect Saison pour I do not know what is. Very nice amber hue with a rich, decadent looking three inches of white foam on top. Just hanging there with a huge amount of side lace just dripping down the glass and keeping the head alive and well throughout the session.  The aroma was very, very nice. Rich notes of spices, apricot, light apple maybe and a touch of grain. As it warmed some light pepper like spice starts to come forward, nearly spot on. As I take the first taste, I expierence just what I wanted from this one. A light, perfectly carbonated saison. Light notes of fruit spiced up with hints of white pepper and a perfectly balanced mix between light grain and fresh grass in the finish. Smooth, delicate and perfectly drainkable, I was very impressed by just how good this one was.  Overall I am ashamed it took me soo long to try this one.

42,141,Gyle41386,4.13,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle purchased at Total Wine in Columbia, SC.  Poured a golden yellow with a huge, fluffy long-lasting head, good lacing. Plenty of activity with lots of bubbles rising up from the bottom. Smell reminiscent of a few other Belgians I've tried. Smooth and sweet at first, with a bit of a spicy bite at the end. Citrusy/fruity with a hop kick. Dry. The carbonation is tickly on the tongue. Very drinkable. This fits into the category of beers you need to know the ABV of beforehand. The 7.7% is very well masked.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Tucquan,4.11,"Had this on 2009-01-30 and again on 2013-09-15 in Columbia, PA  A - The saison beer pours a beautiful, straw yellow color with a 4"" head!  S - There is a light Belgian yeast, fruit and floral smell.  T - The taste is very complex and delicious that I'd describe as bubbly, fruity, lightly tart and cheerful. Seriously though, the things I taste in this beer are grain, carmelized apple, grains of paradise pepper/citrus and a lightly bitter aftertaste.  M - The carbonation is medium-high and it has a light-medium body. Crisp and dries quickly.  O - A flavorful and unique beer. Not something I'd want on a regular basis but a nice treat.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,DoctorDog,3.88,"Presentation: 750 ml bottle into a pint glass.  A- Slightly hazy golden. Pours with 2+ fingers of white head, which fade gradually, leaving ample lacing.  S- Bready/yeasty odor. Some minor citrusy/hoppy odors mingle with some nondescript herbal notes. Slight metallic note.  T- Slight citrusy hopiness and moderate malty breadiness blend with a nondescript spiciness. Minimal orange peel bitterness. Flavors all meld nicely, and the alcohol is well concealed.  M- Moderately crisp with medium carbonation. Fairly creamy.  D- Easy drinking, and quite sessionable.  Future outlook: Nice, solid tasting, versatile drinker. After being hugely disappointed in my sampling of Ommegang's ""Chocolate Indulgence,"" this offering has restored my faith that they can produce a quality beer.

Incomparably smooth upon first drink, with a mild spark that quickly mellows to release a great number of flavors to envelope the tongue - hops, orange, lemon, something mildly floral, and other flavors that lull you into complete submission.

The flavors really blend well together and the peppery aspect pops out every once and awhile too.  M- A nice amount of carbonation keeps things light and the alcohol keeps it fairly dry on the tail end. It is also pretty creamy at the very beginning. Not bad.

Definite saison funkiness. A little sourness, but this is also pretty sweet. Some Belgian yeast with aromas of grain, but also sweet malts.  The flavor is in line with the smell. A nice malt backbone, doesn't taste as sweet as the smell. Definite yeast with balancing bitterness. Flavors of biscuits, orange peel. Enough sourness for complexity, but not too sour. There's a lot going on in this beer. The flavor sticks with you for a while with this one.  Medium bodied. Nothing terribly exciting on the palate. Very well carbonated.  A definite session beer.

The head goes on and on, while medium carbonation sends bubbles through this brew.  Smells of malt and spices. Very faint alcohol scent. Very balanced bouquet urges me to drink. Drink!  The first taste that hits my mouth is cloves, which I don't normally consider pleasant, but other spices (specifically coriander, I believe...) Balance this out. Faint citrus and a slight peppermint taste round thid beer out.  A crisp refreshing mouthfeel is supplemented by lots of carbonation in the mouth. An almost cleansing feel.

42,141,theBubba,2.6,"Okay. This is not so much a review as it is a warning. First I have to say that I'm a big fan of Omm brews. And all the reviews of Hennepin are pretty accurate concerning appearance, smelll, etc. But one reviewer said ""The beer finishes with sweet notes and yeast"". I'd say it finishes with a bitter over hopped taste that lingers until you brush your teeth. Now you serious beer guys aren't going to like this, but in the spirit of keeping the gravity, I cut this ale with Keystone Ice rather than flush it. I'll stick with the Ommegang Abbey Ale. Like I said earlier, I can't disagree with the myriad of excellent reviews of this offering from Ommegang, if this style suits your taste.

Settles to leave a thick cap in the middle of the glass, which is refortified by rising carbonation from that etched ""D"" in the middle of the Duvel tulip. Some lace left behind.  S: Fruity with a hint of yeasty earthiness or musty-ness. Better (more fruity) as it warms.  T: Fruity malt undertone (think ripe green apples) with some spice finishing it off semi-dry. I don't get a sense of the 7.5% ABV (per the bottle) at all in the taste, though there is a warming feel in the belly after a few sips.

42,141,yesyouam,3.96,"This is a rich, cloudy orange beer with a supreme head. It's a huge, fluffy, rocky white head that melts slowly like styrofoam in gasoline. Outstanding retention and lacing that stays forever. The aroma is of clove, orange peel, grass and hay with a sweet malt lying beneath it all. It is soft and creamy on the tounge, medium bodied with lively carbonation. The flavor is similar to the aroma. It's quite pulled together. The bitterness is grassy. It leaves the mouth clean and smoothly into the warm glow of alcohol and peppercorns. This beer may have the best head I've ever seen.

42,141,Mazeraski,4.32,"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into an oversized wine glass.  A - Pours a semi-transparent hazy golden yellow with an inch-thick white and soapy-looking head that leaves a nice ring of lacing around the glass.  S - A big yeasty aroma smacks your nose with hints of lemon peel, honey and pepper. A more sour scent appears as it warms.  T - A large amount of bready yeast mixes in with the honey and lemon as well as an overall citrusy note, for a zesty first wave. This is followed by a mix of carbonation and peppery notes that bring a bit of zing to the palate. The two waves combine, leaving you with a refreshingly tart and spicy flavor that lingers for a very short while. The tart factor becomes a little more pronounced as it warms.  MF - Lighter-bodied with a bit of a heavier carbonation that adds to the overall taste very well.  D - Quite a drinkable brew I'd have to say, even though the ABV leans a little toward the higher end of an average beer. If your looking for something to make a session out of though, one could definitely finish the 4-pack of 12oz bottles, which would make for a great summer night session =)  Notes - A very interesting and refreshing brew and my first taste of a saison-styled ale. Overall, quite a good brew to pick for the summer to quench the thirst for a good beer that won't knock you on your ass and that has a great flavor to match.

Smells like...a farm! Hints of cow and horse, in with the smells of the meadow; wild flowers green grass, and sunshine.  Taste - sweet, rounded, nice, following through to hoppy bitter and dry. Swallow is cleansing and refreshing, with a slight hint of hops in the after taste. Balance is fantastic.  Mouthfeel - light, springy, almost juice-like texture. Nothing close to 'thin,' but at the same time no where near 'thick.'  Drinkability - high. Another smooth, delicious Belgian Blond Ale that you could easily drink all night.

It's yeasty, but not with the overly-spicy aspects of most Belgian yeast. It's much more peppery than what I'm used to. Strangely pleasing.  That flavor is peppery as well, with some very earthy aspects to it. It's also sour and has a nice hop bite to it. This stuff is complex.  Mouthfeel benefits from great carbonation and a full body.

A thick two-finger head slowly fades to a bubble-fueled collar leaving some nice lacing.  some subtle belgian yeast aroma blends in with a definite bready malt profile and some lemon citrus, apple, and green grape. As it warms, the yeast aroma strengthens, reminiscent of a sourdough starter.  Light toasted malt intermingles with subtle yeast undertones up front, with a simultaneous fruit and citrus sweetness and sourness hitting at the same time. A bit of tartness and more straw, grass, and crackers as it warms. The fruits come in stronger as well, with apples, green grapes, golden raisins and green figs.  This one definitely has some strong carbonation that carries the tartness and yeastiness but is almost overwhelming at times. Smooth and fairly full on the whole, with a definite dry and spicy finish.  Definite enjoyable, although the fruit flavors and high carbonation were almost overwhelming the other characteristics at times.

Pour was a very light, cloudy straw yellow with an insubstantial white head and little lacing. Aroma was light and zesty, and perhaps the best part of this ale - lemon, white pepper, and sourdough bread.  Taste was light and watery, notes of citrus fruit and spices - cardamom, clove, pepper along with a sour yeast flavor. A metallic tin flavor leaves an unpleasant aftertaste. This ale lacks substance: almost no carbonation, very light, oily on the tongue.

Won't bother me, but clouds the overall presentation. (I obviously won't take this into account as far as ratings go however.)  Smells peppery, and honey sweet.  Tastes of honey mingle with the light doughy malt flavor. Also prominent are pepper and lemon flavors. Decently hopped, and while the bitterness is detectable, it plays its part without having to have all of the attention. I'm picking up some other fruity notes as well, although I can't quite decide if it's more of an apricot, or maybe even a pear. Either way, very good.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, tart and crisp, semi-dry finish, and it leaves me with a desire for more.  Overall, I really dig this beer.

Slightly warming. Good overall.  D - Alc is a bit high at 7.7% for a saison. For a simple ""farmboy beer"" it is rather complex and enjoyable.  I bought this beer in summer.

Aroma seems to be somewhat subdued (its just not very strong) though relatively complex. A yeasty aroma is most dominant with light fruits (banana, pear, apple, peach) and a bit of white pepper. Taste is like the aroma but a bit stronger. At first it is creamy and mild with a light maltyness but then pears, peaches, and some light bananas take over. As we near the finish a peppery spicyness becomes more pronounced and builds through the finish. There is some occasional heat here, seems to be from the spices as it doesn't seem like any other hot alcohol I've taste. Doesn't seem too dry despite being well attenuated. Body is medium-light with very high carbonation. Overall its very creamy with a moderate alcohol presence that plays well with the other flavors.

42,141,roadhouse,3.8,"It's about time I bought this bottle. Poured from a 750 ml bottle, 8.5% ABV, into a snifter and tulip.  Appears a semi hazy golden color with a lively one and a half inch bubbly head. Lots of lace.  Aroma has that funky barnyard must that is so characteristic of saisons with some nice earthy hops, a bit of orange, and some sweet sugary tones.  Taste has a bit of sweetness up front then some funky musty flavors with some lemony citrus followed by a decent amount of earthy hops.  Mouthfeel is medium, nice and effervescent.  This is a tasty beer, but I just don't think I can get myself to like Saisons all that much.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

The smell was real funky. You have to be a funk a holic to enjoy this one. Luckily I enjoy it. It gave off bananas, spice and a citrus orange smell. The taste was peppery, spicy and was like sour fruit. In the mouth it was highly carbonated with the pepper leaving the mark. Overall it was pretty damn good.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

T: Super sweet and yeasty. Totally different than in the bottle. Looses some of the spice and instead has a strong yeast flavor.  M: Light to medium bodied. Excellent carbonation.  D: Perfect for a 95 degree day. Probably went down a little too easy. Great beer.  Review was from notes from the Albany Microbrew festival.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

S- The smells is fruity (citrus and lots of apple) with some spice as well. T- Lots going on here. There is the same fruitiness in the taste that was in the smell, the apple is sweet and the citrus, tart and bitter. Overall very crisp, with a lingering spiciness. M- Medium bodied, the moderately high alcohol isn't noticeable at all. D- If I wasn't sharing the bottle, I could easily polish the whole thing off on my own.  This was my first Saison and my second Ommegang.

Picked up a few bottles and got this star on my list.  A: Pours a cloudy, slightly dark golden body with a frothy white head and loads of lacing.  S: RAW country smells, apples, clove and coriander spices, a touch of citrus and some yeastiness.  T: After a touch of apple sweetness, the tongue is struck by the lemony citrus bitterness along with the spices; over time the sweetness re-asserts itself in balance, this time with the spices and bitterness  M: Medium/light bodied with a lot of frothy carbonation.  D: This is an all-star, one of the best Belgians I've had yet. Ommegang has a star and this is my favorite of ther lineup. I love the rawness of the ale, really fits the style well.

Medium-sized head that leaves a nice, thin, foamy layer. Chunky, sliding lacing. Very beautiful.  Fresh grass notes. Slightly sour funk. Light citrus notes. Very light maltiness. Nice presence of spiciness. White peach, banana, and clove.  Green apple peels, peaches in honey, and a nice spice level. Earthy graniness.  Nice, crisp, and clean mouthfeel. Not nearly as creamy as I like my saisons to be.  Very drinkable, especially as a day-to-day kind of brew.

Taste is way to strong on the alcohol. Thats all you taste up front. Creamy body with a lot of yeast and a lightly hoppy and lightly bitter finish of spice. As a western take on a saison though, this works pretty well. Lingering notes of Caramel and Vanilla and a very slight sour note redeem this one.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

There was about a half finger head to start, which dissipated to a thin film. Not sticky at all.  S: Smells mainly of grass, with a hints of pepper and citrus - a bit of yeast as well.  T: Taste is primarily citrus, with notes of honey, grass, and sweet cream. Quite light. Very well constucted - not much bitter.  M: A bit dry, biting carbonation. Though at the same time quite smooth. As it goes down it sticks to your mouth for extended enjoyment  D: Very smooth as the alcohol is very masked for having a moderately high ABV. After a few a tastes though, you can start to feel its kick. For being remarkably light tasting though, it can be quite an enjoyable session.

It retains it's head very well on top of a cloudy yellow beer. The bubbles are super fine and just keep coming.  Aroma is slightly sweet, slightly spicy with a decidedly Belgian yeastiness to it.  Flavor is similar with nice Belgian complexity and depth of character. There is some sweetness to it but it's mostly dominated by spice and sourness. Nothing is over-powered which is nice.  Mouthfeel is good and as would be expected in a Belgian. That is it has higher than average carbonation and alcohol. The later is fairly well-hidden.  Very good american rendition of this style.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Smells of sunshine, faint (appealing) barnyard, herbs, bright fruit, resin. Taste is a burst of earthy and crisp. Mouthfeel is light, balanced. As it warms, the resinous aromas and flavors become honeyed and deeper. Better with each sip.  Second glass of the 750: Incredible vinous aroma floods out! Effervescence isn't diminished at all -- it is champagne-like, with fine, dancing bubbles. The slightly metallic taste from the first glass is gone. Richer, fuller flavor and aroma in every element. Some of the brightness mellows noticeably with this second glass.  For heaven's sake... there's nothing I could say in this review to talk anyone into drinking it that someone else hasn't said more eloquently.

Citrus hops are coming through nicely. Spicy, peppery scent. Pretty faint though.  T: Taste is pretty good. Yeasty, earthy goodness. Citrus hops bring a twangy, sweetness in here with lemon and orange flavors. Malt is subdued but present. Grape flavor comes in a bit. Touch of alcohol. Very nice.  M: Medium in body but feels thin. Carbonation is heavy, but makes it easy drinking. Alcohol rests on the throat with a pleasant burn.  D: This beer is easy drinking but the feel seems to be off. Taste is good and interesting.

Had to pour this one slow as the head was massive - Five finger plus head when I poured this - the head lasted a while too!  S: The Belgian yeast is the initial smell here, followed by pale malts, slight orange and lemon, and some peppery spices.  T: The taste is very nice and crisp. The Belgian yeast strain really comes through nicely. The other main attribute I picked up was pepper, and tons of it. Also some fruity flavors also like orange and banana.  Overall, this is an extremely high carbonated saison. Perhaps too carbonated, but not soda-like.

A light tropical fruitiness, perhaps pineapples are present with some zesty oranges and a lemony zing. A nice light wheat creaminess is observed with some light oats as well coming through. The beer finishes with a nice acidic bite in the finish with some light bananas, and cloves contributed by the yeast.

Taste has some sweetness that is fruity, sugary and a little malty. The body of the flavor comes from yeast; it is peppery, white peppery, slightly medicinal. It seems that there is some added spice also. Some hop character can also be detected in there.  A very crisp, carbonated mouthfeel, but probably a little more body than the best belgians..

42,141,TheycallmeTim,4.52,"Poured from a 750 ml. bottle that reads ""Product of Belgium"" on the label into my Ommegang Witte tumbler, because I already managed to break my Hennepin flute.  My first BA review, of the beer that got me to pay attention, so if I sound ignorant it's because I am.  A--Color matches the logo and ""Worth the Wheat"" slogan on my glass, basically a tawny more gold than yellow wheat. Good sized head that's more foamy than fizzy with some lacing.  S--My weakest category. To me it smelled mostly funky barnhouse, with a little piney citrus sharpness. Like a used horse blanket sprayed with Pledge.  T--The biggest thing I noticed was a hot spiciness that wasn't from hops, though I can feel in the backend a sharp pine bite from them. Took me a while to get the taste but I think it's like ginger, or candied ginger, as there's a mellow sweetness that rounds it out first. Beginning of the swish in my mouth was more yeast than anything, with some grassiness, too.  M--Medium with a little more carbonation than I like. Definitely smooth with a little chewiness.  Great drinkability for a humid day in that oxymoron of places, the Brooklyn backyard. Went great with a slice of tomato pie. This beer got it all started for me, and while I've moved on somewhat, I've got much respect for it.

M/D: A medium body that is over carbonated for my tastes. The alcohol show a little, but other than that an easy to drink beer.  Pretty much spot on for the style. I really enjoy this.

Really soft pepper in the nose, nothing too bracing, yeasty, and plenty of lemon aroma. Taste follows the nose, with some clove and pear notes, and a faint grassy hop presence.

The flavors are quite good, herbal hops, some balancing malts, a raw honey sweetness, assorted spices I have trouble putting my finger on, ALC esters as it warms. Complex and challenging.

This was a big letdown from what I'd hoped for.  Mouthfeel was great. Lots of prickly carbonation and generally a nice smoothness to go with a medium body.

Aroma of citrus, citrus, and more citrus, with some slight floral notes in there as well. Very pleasant.  Taste is herbal, grassy even, with notes of clove that remind me of a summer wheat ale. Mouthfeel is smooth and medium-to-full-bodied, with nice amount of carbonation. Finish is somewhat neutral, with not too much of an aftertaste.  This would probably make a superb Summer beer (though watch out for the alcohol!), but it just didn't do it for me. Perhaps it was because it just wasn't one of those nighttime, before-bed beers. Overall, not too bad.  ---  Served at The Mellow Mushroom in Evans, GA.  Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.  Light, clear straw-gold hue with a pillowy head of white foam. Nice, thick rings of lace grace the walls of the glass as the beer drains.  Nose of citrus, with notes of lemon zest and grapefruit peel, mixed with earthy, musty horseblanket.  Light, highly carbonated body, with an herbal, grassy palate, with a nice, none-overpowering clove spiciness. Finish is very dry, helping to lead one to a further draught.

D: Definitely drinkable, not hints of the high ABV in the brew.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,smerkinb,4.6,"Bottle has instructions for pouring and blurb about history of this beer. Pours a golden orange with 2""+ head that is pure white. Great lacing the whole way through. Smells fruity and yeasty but makes me think ""clean"".  Tart and alcohol esters were the first impression with some mild earthiness. Clove stands out to me (maybe cuz of all the hefes lately) Ends a slight band-aid dry. As it warms the alcohol comes through a bit more, but nothing overwhelming.  Mouthfeel is light and crisp and ends with a twangy bite.  I was a bit afraid of this one as I don't drink much that has a higher ABV, but my fears were unfounded. Though I could sense the alcohol as this warmed up it never became the main attraction. The flavor was way too complex for my little mouth, but I'm smart enough to know I liked this alot and will be coming back for more, and more, and then probably some more. My interest in this style is definitely stronger.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Zadok,3.8,"Poured from a 1 pint 9.4 fluid ounce bottle.  Poured a rich golden straw coloring with a perfect 2 finger frothy pure whit head. Mild lacing kept up on descent.  Smells are prototypical of this style and this one is exceptional to the norm. Clove spices set the foundation for the rest of the aroma to include coriander, banana, and bubble gum. A very light essence of pepper nudges its way into the picture and all in all hides the moderate ABV well.  I'll try to be as objective as possible, but the taste is a major letdown from the smell. Mild and I mean very mild hops and soothingly subtle spices make up the rather well balanced, albeit light flavor.  Medium body with a medium carbonation leaves a small dry bite after each swig. Slightly filling but not enough that you couldn't have a couple of these bottles.  Nice summer ale for sure, goes down very smooth and is quite refreshing.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,ColoradoBobs,4.5,"750 ml corked and caged bottle.  Gentle pour into a tulip flute yields a huge white rocky bumpy head over a cloudy golden-blond chill-hazed body. Incredible effervescence: the head stays, stays, stays, even grows! Lacing is permanent and thick. Gorgeous beer.  Smell is bright, green apple and under-ripe fruit, yeasty, mildly funky. Soapy and clean, over a light cracker malt base. Floral hops are there.  Taste is very similar to the smell, though a bit more malty. There even is a note of chocolate! Nice hoppy dry finish. Mineral water. Crisp and perky.  Moutfheel is superb -- round & rich , yet simultaneously crisp. Wow!  Drinkability is excellent: the 7.7% ABV is completely hidden. Sessionable!

S - Nice floral/citrus aroma with a mild bread finish. Sweet and not bitter.  T - Wow. Great balance of citrus and malt flavors. Very clean and crisp and it really masks the strength of this brew. Great representation of this style.  M - This Saison reminds me of Duvel in this area. While not as apparent it has that wonderful nose tickle...

I've tasted this beer three times and am ready to review it now.  Pours a golden color with a big head.  Aroma mostly reminded me of a pilsner or perhaps a weak pale ale. Not enough esters, funk or spice to do the style justice.  Taste is clean and refreshing and has some estery fruits but for the most part was just a decent beer that was a bit boring.

Definitely a good beer for the summer: it has a somewhat crisp wheat-like flavor with notes of complex malts. High carbonation. Medium bodied. Very flavorful mouthfeel.  D - All in all, I definitely respect the quality of this brew - it just wasn't one of my favorites.

42,141,shadow1961,4,"Brewery Ommegan's Hennepin pours a big stiff head over a cloudy yellow brew. The head collapses to a finger in a minute or two, leaving a bit of lacing behind. Carbonation is hard to guage- though light in color the beer is quite opaque. The nose is is fruity- apple, maybe and a bit of some kind of berry, a bit of yeast funk, and the barest hint of alcohol stiffening up all those smells. The flavor is very delicate light malts, wood, and an herbal hop off the back. Mouthfeel is light, crisp, and very dry. Aside from the whiff in the nose, the alcohol is well controlled- making itself felt as a definite warming, but in no other way. This is one of those brews which is suitable to try out on your wine-drinking friends, in place of a dry white wine. A really nice Saison, and in spite of the name, it comes not from Minnesota, but from Cooperstown, NY- the birthplace of Baseball. Nice.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Quite impressive appearance.  S: Somewhat weak with spiced aromas, lemony/herbal hops, and some slight fruitiness. A very light, summery kind of aroma, almost akin to a Hoegaarden or other Belgian wit. Solid, but not special.  T&M: A rather tasty, crisp, and tangy beer. Start is malty and smooth before giving way to some tangy fruit and sourness. Finish is spicy, hoppy, dry, and long. The depth of complexity is definitely appreciable. Body is medium with a slightly prickly carbonation that could definitely be better, considering it's a Belgian ale.  D: High ABV limits this a tad; however, it's still crisp, flavorful, and delicious.

The taste is crisp and refreshing and follows with the aromas detected. Finishes very clean. A nicely crafted beer, this is my first saison but I have had similar belgian style ales.

I tried to leave as much sediment in the bottom but the beer comes out sort of hazy. A huge foamy head arises and retains for quite some time leaving interesting shapes as it dissipates. Initially this beer gives off a skunky-lager type aroma and some citrus and somewhat sweet. The taste is very different. Clove, spices, and fruity esters shine through.

Pronounced dry bitterness in the finish from the hops and noticable alcohol that remains on the tongue after the flavor has faded. Feel is a bit rough. High carbonation levels are a bit much at first, but mellow somewhat toward the bottom of the glass.

I've heard many people rave about this beer but have always turned the other way as I naively claimed not go like ""Belgians"" (style)  Now that I've discovered that I do enjoy Saison's I knew it was time to break out a Hennepin.  I was not disappointed.  I enjoyed this in a large wine glass which showed off this beautiful beer. The beer poured a hazy/cloudy gold with a pillowy white head that was about a finger thick. The head quickly settled to a thin white film across the top of the beer. Beer was too cloudy to see any carbonation at all. I good looking beer indeed.  Aroma was wonder and fresh. There were some earthly tones as well as some slight spice notes. Also coming through was a nice light fruit aroma. Very light, fresh and inviting.  Taste was even better than the delightful aroma. Perfectly balanced from to back. I detect a fruity flavor but could not really pinpoint a specific fruit, perhaps pear. I really enjoy the peppery flavor that seems to stay just delicately in the background. More like white pepper. Finally, you can detect some earthiness that accompanies the hop finish.  Really nice, a new fan is born.  A slight carbonation brought the flavor to life on your tongue. The mouth feel was light and refreshing while the flavor was crisp and bold. It's so drinkable that I hope my wife does not enjoy the glass I poured for her. So silky smooth and inviting.  I can see why this such a sought after brew.

Smell: Faint citrusy, hoppy aroma.  Taste: At the moment the bitterness of certain beers does not appeal to my adolescent palate, but this; crisp, hoppy, with some weisse-like sweetness to balance it all out, is delicious. Zesty, the hops dominate but like MJ on the court, it's a beautifull thing and the other flavors play their roles like a strong supporting cast. Damn good.

It was tough, because Le Merle (North Coast) was also calling out to me, but the last saison I had was the Merle. So Hennepin was up next; it was Ommegang time.  Poured into a barrel pint (all of my proper glassware is currently in storage) from the .750ml, the Hennepin is a site for sore eyes. An opaque, but glossy, yellow/gold color with a ginormous bubble-bath head of white foam on top. Good lace. The nose is a spicy sweet banana scent, with pepper and apple and faint lemon grass. Other spices in there too. Really nice aroma, if you ask me. The taste leans a bit to the sweeter side, as the fruitiness really rises to the occasion. I'm a bit more inspired by a spicier bite to my saisons, but this is still really tasty, and really cuts through the summer heat well. Mouthfeel is tangy, but evens out and becomes noticeably smoother as the beer warms to room temp.  A fine outing by the gang at Ommegang. The Hennepin makes for a wonderful spring or summer treat.

Pretty sweet, too sweet for me, but ton of other spicy, fruity, floral stuff going on for balance also. Bottle doesn't mention anything about spices, but hard to imagine all of these flavors being created by just the yeast.  Flavors changed as it warmed. It took me a while to drink it, was definitely better warmer. Overall way too sweet to me. I'm new to the style, but drinkability was tough cuz of the overly sweet finish.

Funky farmhouse flavor, spicy, slightly sour, notes of grass, pale malt, and the slightest licorice flavor on the end. Good, slick mouthfeel with adequate carbonation.

I love the yeasty taste and the earthiness it delivers. The carbonation is higher than other beers and delivers a nice bite. The typical belgian spices of coriander and orange peel are very sublte and only add to the already delicious taste.

A: Poured a slightly hazy golden yellow color with a ton of carbonation and a foamy, champagne-like dome of carbonation. Lacing was minimal, but the head retained quite nicely.  S: The smell is crisp and grainy, with a whiff of grass and citrus fruits.  T: The taste is dry and sweet up front, like a pinot grigio. Then, a lemon-grass, herbal pepper hop flavor comes over the tongue. A rush of tangy and tartness finishes dry and vinous, with plenty of dry, citric hop aftertaste. Outstanding!  M: Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and slick, with a prickly rush and dry, carbonated finish.  D: I guess it's a good thing I split this among 3 people, or else I would have kicked it myself. Dangerously drinkable saison, with plenty of flavor and character to keep you sipping glass after glass. A keeper.  The only drawback I can sense with this brew is the funk and tart/sour factor. I know it's not meant to have such powerful overtones, but something a little more tangy to balance the heavy citrus zing here would have made it truly exceptional.

Look: Medium gold with deep straw hues, fair clarity, moderately large head with less than moderately low retention.  Flavor: Attack is fairly clean and flavored lightly behind the tart, bitter, alcoholic body. When my palate adjusts, I get mild sweetness and maltiness along with various earthy, grassy, and slightly musty flavors. The volume of sensations grows like that of a string quartet - starting soft and with the least of energy.  A little alcohol flavor joins in and the heat is turned up. Musty melon flavors, leaves, hints of strawberry, banana, citrus, (what I take to be) wet blanket, and mild barnyard all vie for attention with restrained whispers.  The Verdict: A light/subtle brew that is better experienced carefully and with great thought. No wild exciting flavors here, just relaxed summer evening contentment.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

S: Yeasty sugars, perceivable orange citrus.  T: Semi-sweet candied sugar, toffee, chardonnay, fruit tartness along the lines of dates and plums, sour orange juice, citric hop bitterness.  M: Chewey, smooth cream, the carbonation flirts courteously on the tongue.  D: This big bottle will do me for the afternoon, but, oh yeah, it's drinkable -- a little too drinkable.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

42,141,PiecefulToker,4.45,"Wow. This is definitely my favorite saison yet. It poured with a nice and thick 1-finger head in my St. Bernardus chalice which sustained itself, leaving some awesome looking lacing in the glass (you could even see the levels of each sip I took). The smell was straw, pale malt, and slight alcohol warmness. The taste was amazingly well balanced and smooth, which went through a series of phases before it subsided. This is the best example of a saison that I have tried yet, and I now understand why this style is so highly regarded. This stuff is great. The mouthfeel was also excellent in its smoothness and perfect carbonation. I drank a 750 by myself, and I could have easily downed another, if not two more. If you see Hennepin on the shelf, make sure to grab a bottle (or 4).",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,gestalt162,4.25,"From a 25 oz. brown bottle, part of a Ommegang 10 year anniversary package...  A: Cork pops like a bottle of champagne. Even my mild pour creates a huge head. Bubbly, frothy, rocky, a metamorphizing off-white head. Cloudy golden-white body. Lots of carbonation- a very active beer. Splotchy lacing on the sides of the glass.  S: Banana and clove predominately, kind of like a hefeweizen, but with a grainy and grassiness to the aroma as well. Nice clean malt flavor. A deep whiff also gives a slight alcohol smell.  T: Crisp, ever-so-slight maltiness. Predominant flavors of bananas, honey, hint of cloves and other spices that I can't put my finger on. Hint of citric lemon-orange behavior. Really clever grassy, hay-like character that feels like a harmony between the malt and hops. Slight tartness towards the middle/end really brings things together. Lasting banana, smooth malt, and dry fruit flavors sit on the palate after swallowing.  This beer is so complex, I'm pretty sure I didn't even mention half the flavors that were apparant. I could study this for hours.  MF: Well-carbonated, light to medium body, just enough crispness not to overwhelm, but to really enhance the flavors.  D: At 7.5% ABV, not sessionable, but like I said, this is a very complex and enjoyable beer. Simple if you drink it fast, but if you really slow down and enjoy it, a lot of those nuances will come out. A great beer to enjoy outside with nature during the summer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Bowdoinbeerboy,4.47,"Appearance- Pours with almost no head and only a little carbonation. Beer itself is pale yellow-brown.  Smell- Sweet fruity smells in the nose, alcohol gives it just enough jump into the nose to really make it delicious smelling.  Taste- Tasty bit of carbonation fizziness at the start, taste mellows out a bit after that to crisp citrus and lemon. Mellow on the aftertaste with a pleasant amount of tang.  Mouthfeel- Really fills up the palate and warms the mouth.  Drinkability- A delicious brew, a great sipper to sit down and enjoy with some brie, which im currently doing!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,largadeer,4,"Appearance: Blond in color and fairly cloudy, moreso after the first glass. A billowing white head rises from a gentle pour, lasting until the final drop.  Smell: Very malty with some banana-like esters. Closer inspection reveals spicy and floral notes (white pepper, ginger and mint come to mind).  Taste/mouthfeel: Tropical fruit and yeast are at the forefront here, but there's a spicy kick beneath it. Mildly sweet initially, though that's quickly overtaken by a lasting dryness and mild herbal/floral hop bite. Carbonation is high and the finish is ultra-crisp - this is one seriously refreshing beer despite the high ABV. The flavor is low on the funkiness sometimes found in Belgian saisons, but I'm not complaining; this is a damn good beer.  Notes: A solid beer that was past due for a review. For the price it's hard to go wrong with this stuff.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,joezak5,4.89,"Appearance: Poured into a Duvel sniffter; I couldn't resist and poured out all the yeast... a hazy golden orange with overflowing pure white thick head. Little rentention and good sipping lacing.  Smell: Wild, musty and earthy yeast. An all out funky yeast bomb... outstanding. Little mushroomy twang and grassy earth.  Mouthfeel: Light bodied, slick and lively in the mouth even though there is little carbonation.  Taste: Honey sweet malt with tart lemon and the nutty spicy yeasty kick. The hop bitterness comes in as a warming and lingering finish. The floral essence is beautifully mixed in with everything. This is the most complex beer I've ever had.  Drinkability: Unreal, complex yet drinkable. Sweet, tart and almost bitingly crisp. I think this would be a fascinating intro for anyone who thinks they don't like beer.

Flavor is a little one dimmetional at first, a bit of wheat and some spice. As the beer warms up the flavor becomes more complex with more spice (pepper and a bit of clove), some solid noble hops and a dry saison finish.

A) A nice golden color, well, a little pale in appearance, but nice to look at.  S) The aroma was spicey, something like honey as well as lemon zest.  T) At 1st it was maybe I say ""bready."" followed by blended fruit, spice and a nice floral flavor.  M) This is definitely medium body, with what it feels like a fresh sense to the palate.

A - Golden, slightly cloudy with nice carbonation and some yeast floaties. The head is Duvel-ish; never really dies and leaves its mark on the inner walls of the glass.  S - modest barn yard, banana, yeast, citrus.  T - Wow. Over-the-top splendor.  M - Creamy with perfect carbonation.  D - Top of the line.

42,141,MiScusi,4.32,"750mL bottle.  A- pours a chill hazed cloudy light gold with a big fluffy and rocky white head. The haze wears off after a while and it becomes a pretty clear gold.  S- Dominated by light fruit and Belgian yeast. Definitely has the ""farmhouse"" character that it should. Nice and earthy. Gotta give it props since my dad who was sitting a couple feet away said he could smell my glass and also said he really liked the smell.  T- Lots of fruity esters come across at the beginning, washed away by earthiness, and then both combine at the end to leave an aftertaste composed of both flavors.  M- Way to carbonated, though after warming up a bit with extensive swirling it releases enough of the carbonation to make it a bit more enjoyable.  D- Well I don't know if I've ever drank an entire 750mL bottle by myself but I did with this so that's gotta score it some points right?",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

A little banana presents itself as well...  Damn, this is just terrific... Slightly citrusy and hoppy but also yeasty and funky at the same time...

Sparse but interesting lacing...could be my frosted pint glass though :)  S: An earthy yet spicy (cloves) aroma dominates this beer. Lemon qualities detected mixed with yeast and minimal sour note.  T: Nice and bubbly, mild sourness of lemons or even sour apples mixed with an enthusiastic spicing. Quite dry. Low hop flavor. Footnotes of light malting.

Appearance - Golden with a soft white head, firm but not too pillowy. Head slowly dissipates, but a quarter inch remains.  Smell - Spicy, with a little fruitiness.  Taste - Wow. Refreshing, with more fruit, and a hint of apple. Almost a sour, but satisfying, finish. Pretty tart. Lots of depth to the flavor, and a tasty lingering on the tongue.  Mouthfeel - Incredibly crisp. Just a very refreshing beer. Not heavy or creamy, but sharp.  Drinkability - Absolutely off the charts. for such a potent beer, I could pack these away. When I order this at the bar I have to limit myself to only two, or I know I'll end up going too far.  This is one of my favorite beers, ever.

Is straw yellow in color and has a nice Belgian farmhouse funk aroma. The flavor is quite impressive. It has an orangey citrus full saison flavor that is closer to the BJCP guidelines of a saison than Saison Du Pont.

Smell: Citrus (very lemony) and a hint of alcohol.  Taste: Hops in the finish, a little bit bready, somewhat sweet as well.  Mouthfeel: Nicely carbonated, I have my mom a taste of this and she thought it really reminded her of how champagne felt in her mouth (which I would agree with). Fairly light as well.

Finally decided to pick up a single bottle to give this a whirl.  12 oz. bottle poured into a tulip.  A- First thing I notice is the big huge massive head that emerged- fluffy and hilly- bold white color. The liquid was a bright shade of gold. No lacing on this one.  S- Smell is very citrusy- hints of grapefruits and pineapple. Some spice in the nose as well.  T- Taste was really excellent. Sour tartness followed by a nice peppery spice- I detected some strange flavors in here- maybe some biscuits/bready/ginger? orange zest. Lots going on here.  M- Surprisingly easy to drink- tingly yet not overwhelming.  D- I could pair this one with many different meals.

It's very robust and spicy, yet it goes down pretty easily. Lots of crisp carbonation in the mouth, but good weight to it as well.  This is a great version of this style.

Smooth grassiness in the back with a fleeting yet pleasant sour note. Lightly alcoholic finish with more sourness and a light lingering tingle.

This drink wants out!  A careful pour into a tulip glass evokes a billowing, explosive cloud of soft white foam, decorated by a tiny glowing golden body alive with bubbles. The head is continually fed by a steady stream of bubbles, and holds at over two fingers throughout the drink, lacing the glass in a fashion not unlike shaving cream. This drink is alive!  Smell is yeasty and sweet, with notes of clover honey, hay, crushed red pepper, and unbaked sweet rolls.  Tastes yeasty and tart, with sweet grass, underripe green pears, nutty and dry, with a flavor of spicy pie crust and a touch of astringency and chalk in the last pour from the bomber. Lingering dryness and a note of raw pecans remind the drinker to drink again.  Smooth, rich, and tingly in the mouth with a nice clean finish.

T - Really complex, tons of fruit flavors, yeasty goodness. Borderline cloying but never steps over the line. My only complaint is that it could stand to be a little more tart and a little less sweet.  M - Sparkly, yet a little syrupy... slightly thick but the carbonation cuts it  D - The ABV is a little big, but it's relatively drinkable for it's sweetness.

I actualyl pured a little to fast and overflowed the foam that formed faster than anticipated.Good 3 finger head, settled in a few minutes to a half in thick layer of foam.  Appearance was nice, a bit cloudy, the color reminded me of orange juice, but not as deep an orange. Noticeable bubbling from the carbonation as well.  Smell was pronounced, main scent to me was banana, but a spicy banana. Also has some citrus scents in there as well, but the banana and spices were the most prominent.  Taste was nice, banana is there, as well as a clove like taste. A bit sweet, but not overly so. Has a bit of the carbonation burn you feel when drinking a carbonated soft drink, finishes with a bit of a spiced citrus taste. Very flavorful, no one flavor dominates, but everything there works together and is nicely balanced.  I liked the mouthfeel, was full without being overdone. The carbonation left a bit of a tingling sensation at the finish.  I think this is a very drinkable beer, although the high alcohol content and price will limit you more than anything else. I could see myself easily lingering over 2 or 3 bottles of this over the course of an evening.

42,141,ABCJiugui,4.43,"EDIT: REALLY important to note- there are DIFFERENT types of hennepin, depending if it is brewed in Cooperstown NY or in belgium. The labeling tells you, and I'm not sure if they've standardized it all. The arched front labels are ones brewed in NY- those are GOOD, the standard hennepin that I love. The ones with a flat square label with the words ""product of belgium"" are NOT good. They taste like Duvel knockoffs- and since Moorgat brews them IN belgium (to keep up with demand since the NY brewery is allegedly too small), it's no suprise. So if you want the TRUE hennepin, u must buy the arched label with NO pouring directions on the side, with NO statement ""Product of Belgium"".  The one pictured in these reviews for example is the belgian version. Not as good.  tulip, 750ml bottle  A- ridiculous head, huge, soft, pillowy, rocky chunky. Retains forever to the last sip.

This has a high carbonation with a tingly sensation that goes well with the spice kick.  Notes: Picked this beer up based on the reputation and previous experience with The three Philosophers. I am really glad that America has a Super Power of it's own in Ommegang Brewery.This really felt like champagne and I can see it at the table for Thanksgiving. I feel that this is not for sessions,but that is because I felt fine after two glasses and personally think it still does fine in the warmer weather. In addition, for the price it can not be defeated.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Overlord,3.87,"Pours a hazy yellow/orange. Smells of wheat/grass and yeast. Pours with an inch or so of white head.  Taste is very yeasty. Almost overwhelmingly so. Rich bread tones, some lighter fruits (citrus and melon), and that wheat/grass bite so typical of farmehouse ales.  A good beer, even though I'm not a fan of the style. Mouthfeel was decently chewy.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,PhillyStyle,4.8,"This is possibly one of the best beers that I have ever had. It was on-tap and served in a tulip glass. It was a slightly hazy yellow/wheat color. It had a very white head that was retained for a little while. It gave off a nice citrus aroma with additional hints of spices and yeast. At first I thought this was a Witbier until the bartender told me otherwise as the taste did have similar characteristics. The carbonation was good and the beer was very smooth. Overall this beer is very drinkable in any setting, perhaps not as a session beer, but should be enjoyed early and often.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

I don't know why it took me so long to try this beer, but I will not hesitate trying this beer again. Alcohol is well masked.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,PatrickJR,4.62,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into red wine glass.  A - Slightly hazy yellow with 2-3 finger head and decent lacing.  S - Smells a lot like lemons with other vegetal/earthy aromas. Hidden are smells of apple, leather, and spice.  T - This tastes a lot like a dry white wine. A lemony backbone but without the usual sourness. Grass clippings and mushrooms pull through, followed by white pepper, coriander, and perhaps some sage. Finishes with an almost oaky dryness, reminiscent of musty flavors in scuppernong and muscadine wines. Improves as it warms.  M - Medium bodied and fairly carbonated.  D - Could have one after another. Medium body coupled with intense flavor makes for an easy sipper. Not only does it improve with warmth, but also gets smoother after repeated bottles.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,number1bum,4.08,"Pours a pale yellow color, good clarity and some bubbles rising to the top, with an inch plus of nearly pure white head on top. Head retention is very good and it leaves quite a bit of lacing, too.  Smell is herbal and somewhat bitter, with some yeast and grass aromas as well as some spice. Not much fruit.  Taste is dry with very little sweetness and an herbal, earthy bitterness. Yeast and spice add some complexity, and the hops have a moderate level of bitterness and some grassy, herbal and earthy flavors. There's very little sweetness and not much fruit either, other than some tart lemon maybe and some unripe green apple. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, crisp but quite dry.  This is a good beer and I certainly enjoyed the bottle, but if I had my druthers I'd prefer a saison that's more fruity with just a touch more sweetness. Still, I certainly wouldn't turn Hennepin down when presented with it.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Ommegang brews in the Belgium style and the Hennepin could easily be mistaken for Belgian.  Pale, hazy yellow with thick three-finger head of white foam. Highly carbonated. Yeasty, floral aroma. Cloves and allspice with a bit of a bitter bite.  5/31/10--updating review. Upgrading smell. Lots of good stuff going on with this brew. I'm surprised it's 7.7% abv; would have pegged it around 5.5% Goes down very easy. Lots of citrus and cloves. Great to look at with its pale yellow hue and pure white head.

No freshness date on the bottle, though the label does state that it's both 7.5% and 8.5% ABV :-P  Pours a bright hazy yellow color, with a few fingers of fluffy white head. The head left beautiful lacing around the glass. First whiff I got was very earthy. Then became very sweet and fruity smelling. Lots of banana esters, as well as light citrus.  Taste is more sweet banana and citrus (orange and tangerine). A good bit of earthy yeast, spicy malt, and floral hops. Nice dry and slightly bitter finish. Deceptively complex taste profile. Lots of subtle flavors. Can't taste the alcohol at all.  Mouthfeel is kinda light. Feels smooth, with a crisp aftertaste. I think a bit less carbonation would do this beer well. Drinkability is very good though. It tastes good, and there's nothing too overwhelming about it. Seems like the perfect beer for a hot summer day.  I believe this is my first saison.

S = Strong phenolic smell, white pepper, cinnamon, lemon zest.  T = Taste tracks the smell but with a little more malt sweetness, there are strong yeast phenolic notes, some pepperiness, spiciness of more Middle Eastern of possibly Southern Spanish types.  M = Too fizzy in my mouth, hard to make any other judgments, medium bodied, fair mouthcoating.  D = This is an okay beer, but I cannot rate it's drinkability too high. It is both too strong and too weak for me to really want to sit back and enjoy it. On the one hand, it has some potential scents and flavors, but at the same time doesn't seem to quite live up to the those since they are either too soft to really be a great funky beer, or too strong to make it a simple enjoyable beer.

Great balance here.  t: Mirrors the smell for the most part. This has more pepper and less banana than some. This tastes deceptively simple and familiar. It's easy to forget how many layers there are here.  m: Great, long lasting carbonation that tickles the tongue just right.

Pours a rich, opaque golden color with active carbonation and a luxuriously frothy, two-finger head.  Aroma of hops, yeast, spice and lemony citrus.  Well-balanced alliance of citrus and hops with subtle notes of coriander and carrot. Crisp and lively in the mouth. Tickles the tongue with a bright effervescence. Finishes dry with a pleasant shudder of alcohol.  Clean, refreshing and highly drinkable. Quite possibly addicting.

The aroma is a wonderful lemony amalgam of delicious floral hops and bubble gum/hint of band-aid. Active carbonation conveys a light, crisp, stimulating experience. Sweetness up front with tangy lemony acidity and complex floral hoppy bittereness in perfect balance. Peppery allspice, long but restrained pink grapefruit finish. Delicious!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Its aroma is fruity and floral, citrus and spice and every thing nice. The flavor of light malts, citrus and clove hits you first. Then earthy yeast and complementary citrus and floral hops leads you to a sweet and sour finish. Well balanced, medium body and very refreshing.

S: A nice, sweet, fruity beer with hints of banana esters in the undertones.  T: A nice, malty taste with an alcoholic and banana ester aftertaste. Alcohol subsides as you drink the beer and the combination of the malts and the banana esters become quite complimentary.  M: A nice, crisp, refreshing mouthfeel that paired well with the taste, after it smoothed out.  D: A nice combination of the mouthfeel and the smooth, banana ester/malty taste made this a nice beer.

S- Yeasty and earthy with just a tinge of bright citrus.  T- There's quite a bit going on in the taste- yeast, some paleish malt, some fruitiness (not sure if that's hops, or yeast, or something else). It all comes together nicely except that there is an alcoholic taste, much like vodka, that doesn't meld well.  M- Great creaminess which is so full in the mouth, and yet the beer is also bursting with evervescence. I really enjoyed just parcelling the liquid around in my mouth.  D- A nice and complex beer.

Very good carbonation which led to a two-finger head that receeded quickly to half-finger froth but left sheath lacings. A crisp, tart citrus smell of mostly lemon and orange, mellow floral hops and caramel and some hints of pepper and clove among other spices (for a second I also thought I picked up bread malt in this beer). The taste is crisp, also, with the hops being a little on the heavy side in a more-or-less full bodied beer. The lemon is more prominant than orange and other fruits in regards to taste, and there are hints of grassiness. This beer goes down smooth with some caramel on the sides, and has a semi-dry finish thanks to some (bread?) malty goodness.

Nice and sweet. Light clove, corriander, and orange peel spices emerge. Caramel malt is faintly noticeable.  Taste: Sweet fruit flavors (lemon, banana, and apple) kick it off. Caramel malts are blended extremely well. Not as sweet as I expected from the smell. That's a positive. Spicy flavors are perfectly woven. Very light floral hop flavor on the tail. Sweet, slightly dry finish.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's medium bodied. Carbonation is excellent. This one goes down too easy. Drinkability is very high.

S: It presented a surprisingly balanced profile of sweet, spicy and sour. There were green grapes, honey due melons and light white spices overlaying a modest semi-sweet base of lightly toasted malts.  T: There was a solid base of flavors from the lightly toasted malts and white doughy yeast. There were also hints of grassy hops and a sour flavor that receded the further I got into the bottle.  M: It was medium-bodied, very carbonated, and gave the tongue a workout trying to sort out the various fruits and spice flavors. It finished clean with little sour afteraste.

The head eventually settles into a thin white skim. Decent carbonation release visible throughout the consumption.  S= At first all I could detect in the smell was overpowering alcohol bite. This was due to the beer being served too cold. Once it warmed, I was able to get more of the musty and funky Belgian yeast. Also detected a bit of pepper and some phenolic notes.  T= This beer tastes like a very dry, slightly tart Belgian trippel. There is a mild background of grassy/earthy flavors. The finish is dry with biscuit and faint walnut flavors.

S: Light on the nose with citrus hints and light caramel, apple, and honey.  T: Light to caramel malt flavors expertly balanced. Citrus flavors and spices abound in a complex, mostly dry blend. This really struck me as a great abbey style triple without all the alcohol. The finish is nice and clean with a bit of citrus bitterness in the linger. Very good.  M&D: Light and lively on the tongue and across the palate with abundant carbonation in the form of tiny bubbles. Fantastically smooth and easy to drink.  I don't know that I have sampled many saison style brews but if they taste like this one, I'm all for more!

Nice & smooth with that hint of sour & orange. Not as good as the Abbey Ale, but good. Grows on me as it goes down. Yes, saison will be added to the shopping list.

Smelled of the typical farmhouse horse blanket with a hint of some citrus and peppery tones. The taste starts out sweet and citrusy and then gets a little funky with some straw and pepper spiciness. Very great version of the style. Ommegang keeps surprising me with their belgian style but given their origins I can understand how they do it.

S - sweet citrus smell with some straw and what I've seen described as horse blanket. Sweet, yet rustic.  T - Such a great, complex taste. At first I taste the citrus, orange with some lemon and mango. Crisp, then smooths out and the taste of straw and raw grain kick in. A great funk lingers after the beer is swallowed, but light and not overpowering.  M - Thick, yet smooth. Will slide down the throat. A tiny bit sticky at the end for my taste, but not bad. The bubbles are a nice effervescent touch. Not champaigny at all.  This is such a great beer. I bought the 750ml thinking it would last me for days when I could have easily finished it in one sitting. Instead, I finished it in two. This is an easy drinker, yet a sipper.

A- Amazing 3 finger white fluffy head crowns a cloudy straw yellow brew. Excellent retention, and very intricate lacing. Very well carbonated as well.  S- Fruity malt plays with the nose at first... a mild spicy apple, perhaps pear... malt, yeast... vague faint dark fruit (similar to a belgian strong) are also present. Hops as well. Excellent nose.  T- Delicious, yet not without its flaws. The taste is not as complex as the nose would indicate... Much spicier than fruity... slightly peppered. A rather one dimensional malt is the headline here... although it transitions into a very warming alcohol taste... which then transitions nicely into a brief hop finish. Dark fruits linger on the aftertaste, although slightly apple rules the initial sip. Tasty, but doesn't live up to the nose.  M- Hmmm... Light body... lighter than i was expecting even... however, perfect carbonation.. nice citrus bite as well.  D- Well, although this comes in a 4 pack, it is quite drinkable.

Crusty, jagged, foamy lacing. Lively carbonation dances up through a beautiful straw golden body - it lasts to the bitter end of this gorgeous brew.  Smell: Rich, deep grainy aroma intertwined with spicy, fresh, lemony esters and a funky, earthy yeast scent. It's sweet, but also musty, and oh so mild.  Taste: Sweet and grassy grain notes are in the foreground, with a slight hop bitterness and a hint of peppery alcohol in the tail. Mild fruity notes - not just citrus, but something else as well, banana esters perhaps - mingle with earthy, musty nuttiness and spice notes imparted by the yeast. There's quite a lot going on here, and it's all divine.  Mouthfeel: Slick, but crisp, with a medium body, and a good carbonation profile.  Drinkability: Stellar. It went so well with the sharp cheddar mac'n'cheese, I ended up drinking practically the entire bottle on my own and was only mildly tipsy. There's enough going on in this raw, complex beer that it can be enjoyed any number of ways.  Forget wine - bring a .750 L bottle of Hennepin to your next dinner party.

There's a steady stream of bubbles cascading up the center of the glass. Thick spotty lacing down the glass.  Great aromas of bananas, coriander, cloves and yeast. There's some notes of lemon zest and orange with some floral hops in the background. Great blend of sweet and spicy.  Taste is pale malts and yeast up front, followed by banana and spices: again, coriander and cloves. There's some sweet citrus in there as well, with a mildly bitter finish.

Excellent coriander, orange zest and banana ester aroma with a little added citrus. Scent is very clean but viscous at the same time.  The abundance of malt is surprising here - almost straight woody malt with some bruised yeast and even-handed spice. Alcohol oozes gently in this offering. Spice, tang and mild bitterness combine with the woody malt to make an extremely well-balanced product.  Mouth pops on the even citrus/sour finish - some blood orange, maybe even some zest and bitter lemon.  This is very light on the palate and a pleasure to open up a 750 and sip it over time.

Taste is similar; there is a slight biscuity flavor about it with the slightly sweet, peppery cloviness coming to the forefront and being countered by a moderate bitterness of hops and alcohol. The alcohol has a slight warming effect but isn't overly noticeable in flavor. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a creamy, slightly aggressive carbonation. Drinkability is decent, but I think the cloviness and alcohol might get to you after a while. Overall, an excellent beer - I look forward to trying other Siasons in the future.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,hustlesworth,4.25,"edit 4/26/08  A- pours a hazy pale golden canary yellow with a great cap of nerf-like white foam that had awesome retention finally turning to a floating clump of ice cream like duvel. waves of lace eventually coat the inside of the glass. the head says it all here- the only other siason i've have is rogue festive ale which had beautiful tropical sunset, i would have liked to see more of that but maybe it's not actually characteristic of saison...more research is necessary.  S- banana, lemon peel, a hint of clove, and flash of crisp noble hops. pale malt also, although mild, and floral jasmine/wysteria incense-like notes, and some funky barnyard smells. still not sure if it's the yeast or what, but i like it. as it warms it takes on the aroma of fresh rustic bread, buttery pound cake, powdered sugar and honeysuckle nectar.  T- banana, clove, and bubblegum, with a grassy petrol hop bite and some herbaceousness. soft orange and coriander, and a lemony ginger bite that goes well right along with the hops. sourdough bread, pineapple, apricot, and unripe peach come out in the fruity semi-dry finish.  MF- feels light and clean with a bubbly feeling similar to peroxide mouthwash, medium high carbonation, the bubbles seem to expand as i drink, releasing flavor everywhere.  D- smooth and refreshing, this would be great in the late spring after workin in the garden all day.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

This diminished to a thin cap. The beer is a straw color that is quite cloudy.  The nose is more like a heffeweisen. Had notes of spice (corriander) and a yeasty nose... like many belgians that I've tried.  Taste: Not Bad.... a fruity taste followed with a tiny bit of alcohol warming. A strong heffe (kinda). Tiny hops bite at the end.  MF: Not as smooth as my favorite heffeweizens.... but this is my FIRST Saison... so maybe this is normal. medium to low carbonation and a clean mouthfeel.  Drinkability: You'd NEVER guess 7.7% abv!... very well hidden. I could enjoy a few of these in a sitting.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,TheDeuce,3.68,"750 ml corked bottle. Poured a hazy light orange, as the cork goes the carbonation bubbles up like crazy . Into the glass it crackles and fizzes. Nose of hops in a citrus haze (I'm not sure which ones) and the Hennepin website says gingersnap.  Taste/Mouthfeel- Sweet but light taste, flavorful with notes of alcohol, hops, and fruit but the back is grainy, ginger and other notes are light but noticable.  Drinkability-actually refreshing, probably good on a hot day, here in the cold of early March in NY though the alcohol helps warm me up.  Overall- I'm not an expert on Saisons, but I will say that this is a refreshing complex ale and a fine beer. When I try more of this style I will appreciate or depreciate it more based on its competitors.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Taste, again some hops come out right away, floral and fruity. light carmel sweetness comes through with a touch of toasted grains and spices (corriander?), but all of it is just a little light for my tastes. mouthfeel is a little thin, but smooth and well carbonated. this is a good beer, but over rated in my opinion, just nothing special going on in this one.

Poured into the nice official glass that came with said gift pack, this beer is a pale gold color with not much cloudiness. The head is 2 fingers tall and just a shade off white. The foam is very soft looking but it manages to stick around nicely due to the streaming bubble columns from the bottom of the glass. Nice amorphous blobs of lacing adorn the sides of the container.  Aroma is tripel-esque, but less boozy. Lots of bright fleshy fruit, some citrus twang, and some spiciness (Ommegang with a spicy beer??!).  Taste includes lemony citrus rind, boozy apple, and unripe banana up front. Finish is lightly hoppy with some accompanying spice. Somewhere between witbier and tripel here.  There seems to be a lot of carbonation in the mouthfeel but it's not making me burp. Body is light and refreshing. Alcohol is only detectable with significant warming.

Corked and caged, cave-aged in Howe Caverns, released 8Oct05, according to hangtag.  Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 1 1/2"" bright white head over the cloudy orangey golden brew. Head lasts due to heavy fueling of small bubbles from the bottom, with ample heavy frothy lace. Aroma is lightly of spicy sweetness. Taste starts with pale maltiness, quickly exhibiting the ample spicing, which lasts through the crisp close. Mouthfeel and drinkability are both superb. Still liking this one.  3/31/05 - 4.5/4/4/4.5/4.5  750ml bottle obtained via trade with LuckySevens82. Thanks for the opportunity...

Head lasts well, due to rejuvenation from all the bubbles, with beautiful frothy lace covering everywhere. Aroma is subtle notes of sweetness coupled with light fruitiness. Taste is upfront with sweet pale malts, switching to some spiciness and light fruits, and a crisp light close. Not really any sharp edges here, probably the cave-aging at work.

It's dry, but almost sweet. It sounds contradictory, but it's both.  Mouthfeel: Incredible. For me, perfect carbonation. Again contradiction, very smooth but not.  Drinkability: Drinks easier than beers with lower abv's. I absolutely loved it. One more please.

The beer poured into my 211/8th fl. Oz. snifter with an enormous head. It shortly subsided with massive lacing on the inside of the glass. The nose was heavy with hints of yeast and sweet grass.

T: Light, but wonderfully complex. Notes of wheat, spice (ginger and coriander), and citrus hops. M: Light and smooth with hint of dry bite. D: Eminently drinkable. Very versatile beer. Perfect in the summer heat, with spicy food, thick burgers, or to complement simple fare of bread and cheese. Also great on its own.

A: Poured strongly and had a hazy gold with constant tiny bubbles. Enormous white head that would have been better suited for a belgian glass.  A: Flowers, hops and coriander. Peppery and spicy smells. The fruitiness earthiness and spices were well balanced.  T: Taste changed through the beer but the coriander spice was the strongest and the candied sweet ginger was teriffic. This was the first semblance of yeast but inviting. The hops round this one out nicely.  M: This beer had some life to it and for a wheat beer, held on most of the beer. Drying coating.  D: I was surprised that this had something of an ABV, completely unnoticeable. No reason this cant be a sessionable saison. If you can try it, try it.  Not a huge saison fan, but this way did blow me away. Had before from bottle, this was first on tap and did it justice.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Damian,4.68,"Drank from a 750 ml bottle purchased at Downtown Wine & Spirits, Somerville, MA  Poured a hazy yellow ochre with noticeable streams of carbonation. The head was rather impressive. Two fingers of tight, frothy, bubbly, bright white foam slowly faded to a lasting thick cap. Huge, odd shaped patches of lacing coated the entire glass.  The aroma was crisp and slightly funky. Grassy hops were apparent along with citrus and some skunkiness. A Belgian yeastiness and some spices (coriander and lemon peel) came through as well. As the beer warmed, the aroma turned a touch sweet.  The taste was rich and full-flavored for the style. Lemony, tangy, snappy and citrusy with coriander and clove coming through strong. Crisp, clean and bright with a slight barnyard funk. The long-lasting finish was a touch sour and rather dry with notes of grassy, earthy hops.  Mouthfeel was lighter on the palate yet silky smooth. A fine, lively carbonation made the liquid feel almost pillowy.  This was unquestionably one of the most drinkable and refreshing beers I have sampled. 7.7% ABV? Are you kidding me?  All in all, this brew was outstanding. If there is a more impressive saison out there, I have yet to try it.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Moderate lacing was left along the glass.  The aroma included some breadiness, and both earthy and spicy pepper-like scents. The taste was bready and spicy. The spices being pepper and clove. I also taste some subtle fruit pear-like flavor. There is a strong bitterness on the swallow made up of both a hop and carbonic bite.  The mouthfeel is light with very high carbonation. This is a fairly drinkable beer, but the high carbonation level would prevent too much imbibing.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

When thinking back on my first experience with this style, I remembered enjoying Dupont more. However, I'd have to try it again to explain what I liked about that brew.

42,141,timtim,3.48,"slightly hazy golden honey peach with white head that holds well and leaves nice lace. smells of yeasty spice (clove, pepper, etc.), - like a saison should, but not quite as strong or authentic as i am used to in my favorite saisons - lemon, pils malt, a little barnyard, and mildly sweet bread. taste is the same. the pepper/clove thing really hits the roof of my mouth and top/back of my throat, creating a dry/bitter (but only mildly so) finish. medium full body with a good carb level. okay beer. good saison representation for an american made brew. what amazes me is that saison dupont and it's sister beer foret don't rank anywhere close to this one, and they seem more true to the style for me. i guess that part of that has to do with the fact that a lot of these reviews are by people whom for which this is their first saison. when i think saison, i think super earthy, even horsey - like i'm smelling the beauty of a horse barn on a farm way out in the mountains somewhere. hennepin comes close, but doesn't do it for me. i rated it extra high because it is an american take on a classic belgian style, and they actually do a great job, but i'll take a dupont or de glazen toren, or fantome or southhampton for a few more duckets any day of the week.  edit: okay... i get it. this is a grisette, not a saison. i have tried many many times, but i just can't take this beer. i avoid this beer like the plague. it is the sam adams of belgian-style beer. toned down and dummied up to suit unschooled palates. sorry ommegang, i appreciate what you do for us, i just don't like this one.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Clearly some strong spice in here as well. Great hard saison taste. Very pronounced wheat and yeast flavor with good peppery spiciness. This is no Dupont but it is quite good. At this point the haze is starting to fade a little bit from warmth, but is still very present. Flavors are becoming earthier at this point. The aftertaste has some nice banana notes. The mouthfeel is slightly abrasive on the tongue, but overall quite good. Drinkability is solid on this one, and is impressive.

42,141,jonworth,3.63,"750 ml bottle poured into a goblet.  Perhaps I'm being harsh, but I was slightly let down by this ale. Bottle-conditioned, Belgian-style ale brewed in Cooperstown, NY? And one of the ""Duvel family"" of ales? I wanted to like it--no, LOVE it.  The verdict is in, and I would submit that it's pretty good, but not great. (Disclaimer: This was my first foray into the ""saison/farmhouse"" type of ale, so I can't relate it to others of the same type.) The bottom line is that the dryness and lemony-ness of this ale are overpowering. Considering the healthy ABV, and the fact that it's a Belgian-type knockoff, I would ask for a little more complexity. This ale has a lot of flavor; it's just not as interesting it could be (kind of like typing in ALL CAPS).  Apparently many other reviewers like it, so it might be at the top of its class for all I know; I can only speak within the limitations of my own experience.  Would I drink it again? Certainly.

42,141,toastdog,4.77,"poured from cork and cage bottle into Ommegang tulip glass  Appearance: Two fingers of compact white head perch on top of a slightly hazy pale golden beer that tends to straw in strong light. Head dissipates reluctantly and leaves lacing on the glass.  Aroma - lilac, clove, pepper, apricot, earth and hop spice all appear at different points in your progress through the glass. Also an occasional whiff of... yes... gasoline, or a sweetness in the nose that reminds one of gasoline. Which is waaay better than it sounds.  Taste - more lilac, spicy hops, marshmallow, malt, apricot and freshly turned earth all underpin a lightly sweet pale malt flavor profile. There's a refreshing dry graininess that recalls a nice Pilsener or Dortmunder which balances out the sweetness and the riot of subtle flavors that present themselves in various combinations as you drink. Highly carbonated, which brings some Champagne-like dry notes to the party.  Mouthfeel - This beer is slightly viscous - a too-warm bottle will be a little cloying and tongue-coating, but at 50-55 degrees it's great. It is possible to wear yourself out on this beer if you let it sit and warm to 70 degrees F.  Drinkability - A compulsively sippable beer, but not exactly sessionable. I want to *quaff* a Czech pils... I want to *consider* a Hennepin carefully, preferably alone and with a nice sourdough and aged cheese. I'm such a fop.  Other stuff: A soft smack of aroma hits the nose as you raise the glass, sometimes pepper, sometimes clove and malt, sometimes lilac, which is something I have never found in any other beer. The flavor changes too as you sip, sometimes earthy and sometimes sweet, while the heavy carbonation scrubs your tongue and brings more aromas through the back of your throat. After swallowing, the aroma stays and stays on the nose while the aftertaste lingers and changes on the tongue, as malt fades into hop bitterness and then a long finish of peppery spice and floral hops. When you get a well-handled bottle, this beer is a real treat.  Absolutely one of my favorite Saisons, and one of my all-time favorites of any style.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

A - Pours a dense orange with a two finger head that dissipates quickly then you're left with a small cap that laces gingerly down the glass.  S - A tart yeast dominates but doesn't disappoint. Citrus follows along with what smells like coriander.  T - Smooth but tart. A slow enjoyment seemed to taste better as it breathed a little.  M - Heavy but very subtle on the palate. Left a clean citrus feeling.  D - @ 7.7% it's hardly a session brew but 1 or 2 is just about all you need.

Starts tart with lemon and citrus. Next comes spices and mild earthy hops. Yeast is present, adding some funk. Finishes fruity with tart apple and pear.  Light-medium in body, clean and crisp.

Not a lot of hops with just a small bitterness to round it off. It has smooth mouthfeel that isn't real thin and watery but isn't thick and syrupy. All in all, it is a very good drinkable swill.

42,141,diamondc,4.57,"I've really wanted to try Hennepin for a while now. The local liquor store got my request in only two weeks time. $6.99 a bomber w/no freshness dating.  I wasn't that impressed with the pour in my Chimay goblet. The head died down after a minute. Very golden colored and just a bit cloudy. The yeast are stuck right on the bottom of the glass. Lots of bubbles though ...  Right away I can smell the spicy-ness and hay. A little bit of funkiness. This is definitely a good sign of things to come.  The taste was very Belgian Pale Ale like .. reminded me a bit of Duvel, but not as sweet. Belgian candi sugar & ginger like. Right away there was some pepper and earthiness/grass to contrast the initial sweetness. After the spicy-ness was just a touch of hay and yes ... a touch of horse blanket (I always wanted to use that adjective for a beer review). After all those flavors a medium punch of Noble hops left my tongue a bit dry. I couldn't detect any hotness at all.  The carbonation was spot on ... constant bubbling and very effervescent, this beer felt alive. The second pour I managed to coax all the yeast into the beer and it pushed the taste to 4.5 territory with a bit more bitterness and spicy-ness. I wanted to drink more right after putting the glass down on my desk.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

It's just too good to wait that long between tastes.  From the 25.4 oz. bottle, three fingers of dense white froth top the mug of dark blond body, really beautiful. Prominent malty aroma wafts from the mug, with moderate spiciness and fruity goodness. These tastes explode in the mouth, also bringing suggestions of sour, tart fruit--likely lemon, maybe raspberry. Extremely impressive. Bold carbonation blends with smooth texture, eliciting excellent drinkability that effortlessly elides the moderately high ABV.

The taste is at first tart, but mild fruit esters and a strong phenol spicyness comes through and then diminishes to expose a lovely malty backbone. This beer is sharply carbonated with a moderate body.

Fruit, cheesy spicy yeast, mineral, grassy hops. Not quite totally dry, exceedingly well balanced. Then it does dry out completely, with a long refreshing finish of pure grassy hops and finely tuned minerally hop bitterness.  Can get a bit too fizzy, but the bubbles are nice and small and interact with the yeast character to deliver a pleasant spicy prickliness. Certainly drinkable.

Poured an absolute beautiful gold..crystal clear with probably the thickest, rockyest head I ever saw. The lacing would have stayed on for days if I didnt rinse the glass when finished. Smell was yeasty, fruity and very spicey. I like to say banana and spicey notes. Taste was remakable. Very clean. The Belgian yeast domonated, givin the traditional spicy, fruity notes expected.

Thick, mountainous, vast and rocky are words that come to mind. I'm here to tell you this head was evident throughout the pint, and the lacing it left behind might still be on the glass. Those who have conquered Everest may have found this head a challenge.  Aroma is light and flowery, some banana, pepper and exotic spice. Definitely complex and pleasant. Taste is also peppery, with other spice evident. Hints of banana and bubble gum throughout. Some nice spicy hops in there as well. I love the complexity of this simple looking Saison.  Light to medium body, and eminently drinkable. I'd love to have had another to share.

42,141,morimech,3.85,My 100th review so I thought it should be something special. The 25.4 oz bottle is part of the Ommegang 10th Anniversery set.  A very soft pour produces a golden orange brew with a small white head that leaves some lacing and settles to a solid cap. Tiny bubbles are continously released throughout the session. The second pour 30 minutes later created a much more vibrant head. It must need to rest awhile after uncorking.  The smell is fruity and spicy of cloves and pepper. True to style.  The taste is the same as the aroma. Fruity with some cupboard spices with just a touch of alcohol detected on finish. I don't get much of any hops and the malt is understated which is a bit of a disapointment. It is almost like a wine cooler or one of those malt beverages. It has a nice body with good carbonation. A saison on the overly sweet side but it does taste good but not really something that a person could drink a lot of in a day.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Floydster,3.83,"Pint at Beachwood BBQ in Seal Beach for six dollars  Color was a golden pale straw with a massive white soapy head, easily over an inch and left generous amounts of lacing  Smell was citrus, sweet honey, grassy accents, and some bread-like malty aromas  Taste was pretty good and there were several different things going on, there is honey, grapefruit, oranges, lemons, pears, earthy hops, coriander, several spices, and other sources of sweetness, nice balance of malts of hops, a slightly bitter finish differentiate this saison from other ones I have had in the past that are too sweet a lot of the time  Too carbonated at times in my opinion and the body lacked fullness  Could drink another pint or two these of this with ease, taste might get overwhelming after a while and it is pretty strong at close to eight percent alcohol  First review of an Ommegang beer for me and it was an above average brew, will add an Ommegeddon review some time soon when I taste that beer again after it has been aging for a while",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,BWH3,3.79,"Hennepin Saison Brewery Ommegang Large Corked Bottle from a Goblet at 50 F  A: Golden light orange with mild haze from bottle conditioning. Massive bubbly white head pours then settles to a meringue firm foam atop the beer. The carbonation is fine bubbles but big and constant. Flawless presentation. (5.0)  S: Not all that surprising or bold, but has the appropriate features of the style. A sweet lemon aroma dominates with noble hop mustiness. No spice or herbal notes. Alcohol undetectable. Often farmhouse ales have a earthy or grassy scent adding to the complexity. Unfortunately this beer does not. (3.5)  T: Again not challenging but has the basics for style. Light bread like malt sweetness underneath a crisp citrus flavor. Carbonation somewhat impairs the ability to enjoy the flavor rather than augmenting it. No spiciness or herbal flavors. No alcohol taste. Again very little complexity, but what is there is very good. The carbonation and hops give a nice clean dry finish to the aftertaste. Ultimately, the aroma and taste would benefit from more spiciness from the yeast phenols or some herbal additions to challenge the drinker. (3.5)  M: Very light bodied, high carbonation, low alcohol warmth. Very good for style. Tongue is still stinging from all the bubbles. I would like a bit more body so that it doesn't go down like champagne. (4.5)  D: I enjoy this one. I think if I were trying to introduce people to the style I would offer this one before going to more robust and complex examples. Also, for quenching a thirst this is very nice.

42,141,Procrastinator,4.18,"12 oz. brown bottle poured into tulip glass. My first review of this beer after having had it many times before. No freshness dating, but at 7.7% ABV and bottle conditioning, I'm not worried.  Appearance: straw yellow colored body with tight creamy, small bubbled head. Lots of champagne-like carbonation. Lots of lacing throughout the entire beer.  Smell: candy sugar, honey, sweet overripe bananas along with yeasty sediments and a peppery spiciness.  Taste: candy sweetness, fruitiness of pears, spiciness and alcohol are met by a slight hop bitterness in the finish.  Mouthfeel: crisp and lively carbonation make for a very active mouthfeel. Light effervescence in a slick medium bodied brew.

Smell: A bit of banana and almost like a pineapple, but everything was pretty mellow. Taste: Very nice phenolic fruit taste, again banana and pineapple. perhaps some orange or other citrisy fruits. Nice and compex but not standoffish. Mouthfeel: Nice and crisp. Drinkability Pretty good, and I'm not to much of a Saison fan.

42,141,TheodorHerzl,4.07,"Poured into my tulip glass. The beer pours a beautiful golden straw hue with a dense cloudy interior and a huge billowy white head. You can also notice a massive amount of yeast in the bottle from the bottle conditioning. The nose is fruity, spicy, bready, and bit hoppy. The taste is very refreshing with fresh fruit flavorings coming to the palate including apples and lemon with a certain earthy graininess coming to the back of the palate, and a sweet malt profile makes itself known as the beer warms a little more. The mouthfeel is interesting due to the high carbination in the beer. Very refreshing and inviting in the mouth, and it doesn't leave a very heavy coat in your mouth. The drinkability is great for this offering. Perfect to share with someone over a meal or just by yourself.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Windigstadt,4.23,"A- Hazy grapefruit juice color with rocky white head. S- Yeasty tart aroma I associate with Belgian ales... really no better way to describe it. T- A slightly citric sweetness immediately rolls over the tongue. Some spice (perhaps coriander?) but nothing overpowering. Definite biting esters that suggest a warm fermentation. Some alcohol warmth with a tart finish. Very well balanced; similar to a Belgian Strong Ale before the tart, slightly earthy finish. M- Very effervescent; a bit too overcarbonated for my taste but typical for a bottle-conditioned Belgian. D- Can definitely tell it's in the 7-8% ABV range, but the light color and effervescence leaves it deceptively drinkable. Overall: This reminded me of the farmhouse cousin of Delirium Tremens. It has the same (relatively) light feel, but a little more spice and earthiness that makes it a great introduction to the style for those who are scared off by a strong ""horse blanket"" characteristic. Definitely recommended.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

42,141,BuckSpin,3.88,"Presentation: v.2006 750ml cage top bottle, cellared in my possession for 15 months, in a Duvel tulip.  Opened with a loud (and very sudden) ""POP!"" Poured light, crisp, effervescent, a nice amount of carbonation & audible crackle. Nose is soft, floral, a little sweet, full of yeast esters that also add a slightly sour/tart quality as well as some soft citric tones (orange peel & very subtle lemon). It also imparts a faint spice quality of coriander and old black pepper. Grasses & clover round out the nose. As it blooms the malts emerge dry as straw & hay. Is it coincidence that a farmhouse ale evokes all these rural aromatics?  Head was huge - easily 3 fingers of tight, thick, somewhat sticky & lunar landscape-esque pitted/sculpted pearl white foam that has some nice retention, eventually settling to a pinky's worth of the same. Lacing is sporadic & isolated, creating marble-like ebbs & flows  A gentle swirling restores the head to a fat finger of the same. Subsequent re-pours restore it to 2 fingers. Its certainly a nice piece of eye candy.  The body is a slightly hazy sun-kissed, barely brassy honey gold, shimmering with a delicate, dulled brilliance. A nice parade of bubbles rises thru it serpentine style, twisting & twirling.  Its delicate, light, crisply semi-dry with a nice, cider-esque, middle of the mouth semi-sweet crunch. Malts are barely sweet but not caramelized at all, more of a nip of honey quality. The classic Ommegang yeast takes the point noticeably up front. It comes across slightly sour and lightly spiced with dull citrus (orange peel), coriander & maybe a peep of white pepper bite. However, the Ommegang yeast is perhaps a little too noticeable. Don't get me wrong, its a great taste but I've encountered this before in other Ommegang brews and, having enjoyed others farmhouse ales feel that its a bit too noticeable.  It grows lighter, with more of a lemony taste, the spice qualities of the yeast amplifying & growing sharper, more angular as opposed to rounder. Its certainly one of the sharper, spicier, drier Saisons I've had. I've typically found these to be rounder & softer and slow to reveal all their complexities, but this one pretty much ""dropped the kimomo"" on the first few sips and thats it. Perhaps I've been spoiled on the simplistic, slowly evolving reveal a lot of Saisons have provided. Again, this is not a knock on the taste but rather an observation that if this was a landscape it would be easily viewed & relatively flat after that 1st mountain, whereas others provided views full of hills & valleys that slowly reveal themselves only after sip by sip exploration.  It finishes soft, duller & more even, softly spiced and with a clean, smooth. mildly citric-sour aftertaste. A final pour fills the tulip with all that lovely yeasted goodness, clouding the color to a very dull gold, but surprisingly the taste stays very consistent.  A nice Saison. Not the most complex, and quick to reveal, but nice. I've come to enjoy, and subsequently look forward to, the simplistic complexity & slow ""burlesque"" reveal these typically provide. While tasty, this left little to discovery after the first few sips. In short, its short on foreplay, more of a quickie as far as taste. I did like it, and would pare very well with just about any cheese, some nice artisan bread, cured meats, seafood, a nice salad, etc. I'd definitely drink this again in a heartbeat, but if given the choice between this & others of the genre would probably pick the others. Its a great bang for the buck and would probably be helped by food, but there are better examples to be had. Still, definitely worth checking out.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,SMark,4.42,"This beer was poured at 46º from a 750ml bottle with a cork wired on. There was no date information located on the bottle. It was poured into an Imperial pint glass. There was a huge amount of head and a lot of activity during and after the pour. The coloring was a golden blonde.  Citrus reminiscent of lemon was detected during the pouring but seemed to diminish with a wider range of fruits and spices taking over afterward. There was a slight hop presence in the bouquet also.  Ginger was detected with the first swallow, maybe from too much reading. The other spices and fruits stayed in the background. This is a very pleasant tasting beer.  The beer felt very good and could have lasted a little longer. There was a very slight sweetness which made it very comfortable. No off flavors or detriments were detected.  This was a much improved Saison over my first experience. I may have to go back to that one again to see if I did something wrong with the temperature or what.

The initial smell of this beer brought about a certain spiceyness to it. Some coriander...some citrus notes came to mind.  Taste...well...very smooth with a slight tartness. Unfortunatly it tastes somewhat lighter than you would think with it's higher ABV...Somewhat of a hindrance I would think as you might be tricked into believing that you could drink more of these than you should. Very delicious.  The mouthfeel was slightly carbonated as one might expect from a bottle fermented brew. Light initially, but you can feel the weight of the heavier alcohol content in your mouth.  The drinkability of this beer certainly doesn't belie it's ABV. I could easily have 3 or four glasses of this in a night and be very happy.

The aroma is a largely spices and fruit, with a hint of alcohol. The taste is a smooth fruity flavor up front, and then ending with a slightly sharp spice finish. Doesnt seem to complex, but still full enough to deliver. Less than medium smooth mouthfeel. Low enough abv. and full flavor definitely makes for a few of these in one night. Overall, having never really had a saison ale, I was suprised at the taste and how well put together they are. Just another style for me to explore. Recommended!!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Brad007,4.62,"Pours a very pale color with a very nice, frothy, amount of foam. Heh. My snifter's broke so I had to use a pint glass. Shouldn't matter too much. Aroma is very nice and spicy upfront. I detect raisin, clove and mild apple flavors. A second sniff of the aroma brings up an apple pie flavor and leaves a decent amount of lacing. Taste is much of the same as the aroma except that the spice is more pronounced and the apple flavor seems to be dominant. Goes down very smooth. This is more of a sipping beer as well. Taste is somewhat sour towards the very back of the throat. Definitely a nice Saison!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,N8TheGreat,4.65,"Served at 53 degrees  Pouring this beer into a snifter produced a thick, tight head that complemented the hazy gold color of the Saison. Aroma was quite pleasant and familiar. The beer enveloped my mouth upon the first sip as bitter hop and spicy Belgian notes faded into a delicate fruit which lingered but a moment. Despite its 7% level only the slightest suggestion of alcohol mostly via warmth. This beer proved immensely drinkable.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,beergynt,4.18,"On tap at the Bavarian Lodge in Lisle... Served in a goblet, this beer was pretty to look at. A bright, cloudy golden hue, with some orange color. A little darker orange and it would actually look a lot like orange juice, Bright, white, fluffy head that lingered throughout leaving scalloped lacing all the way down... Smelled banana and clove, spicy phenols, maybe a hint of mint... Taste mirrors the smell on this one; banana, clove, slight phenolic/alcoholic heat... Mouthfeel was very nice; Clean not cloying, effervescent, sparkling... Overall a good representation of the style and a nice, drinkable brew.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,flexabull,4.18,"I've been interested in this one for a while, but I have always balked at the high price. It's Friday, so I figured I'd splurge a bit...  Pours a bright clear gold color from a 12 oz bottle with a big white fluffy head on top. This sure looks good.  Aromas are spicy, yeast like, some clove, and a bit of citrus.  Beer has a very bright, crisp and dry character. Some subtle citrus flavors, a bit of creaminess, and a floral hop bite on the finish.  Mouthfeel is very nice. Very full, coats the mouth well, smooth, and well carbonated.  Drinkability is very good. This is a nice Saison, and I see why it gets high marks here.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Brianmerrilyn,4.65,A: Poured cloudy gold. Head did not last long and was about half a fingers worth.  S: bouquet of fruit but my hairy nose could not differential between bannana and orange.  T: Tangy but sweet undertones with several aftertastes where the fruit becomes more noticeable.  M: Heavier than i expected but glad nonetheless.  D: Very easy on the pallet and the ABV is not noticable to this quafer.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,younger35,4.13,"Received this beauty in a trade with tpd975. This is my first brew from Ommegang and am super excited to try. Drank from a Budweiser pint glass, just as the brewery intended  Appearance- Pours a nice murky yellow orange with a huge billowing bright white head. The head looks stiff, like you could sculpt it. Leaves sticky lacing randomly down the side of the glass. Smell- Nice spicy, yeasty nose that reminds me of a combination of a Hef/Tripel. Clove and banana are reminiscent of the Hef and a dark mustiness reminds me of a Belgium. All in all, its very nice. Taste- Much like the nose the first thing that hits me is the big banana spiciness. Very fruity orange and pineapple with hints of tart lemon zest. Dirty, earthy yeast tones really add nicely to the style. Hints of alcohol but most is covered very nicely with a subtle bitterness. Mouthfeel- Light body without being watery and vigorous carbonation tickles the mouth. Drinkability- Great! Maybe a little to good. This is one of those beers that you can keep drinking and drinking and before you know it BAM!...Drunk again. This is a fantastic brew and I cant wait to try more from Ommegang. Big thanks tpd975!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,roblowther,4.62,"750 ml, corked and caged into a tulip glass. Pale honey and straw in color, with a persistent thin lacy head. A touch cloudy, to add that element of mystery. Smells of lemons, apricots, with a medicinal note in the background. Beautimous. The taste is sharp and crisp, almost bitter. There is a silky maltiness that holds it all together nicely. The finish is malty and dusty, but not too dry. The aftertaste is spiced fruit. I can only say :) The mouthfeel is slippery and tingly. Always a good combination. The drinkability? Pour me another! The alcohol is a plesant warmth as it trickles down the throat. Nothing off-puttish and the flavor balance makes you want more. And now I'll have more.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,meechum,4.3,"A - A blonde straw yellow color with a nice fluffy white head, this was poured into a Pils glass as that's what was on hand  S - Could smell a bit of the yeast, biscuit flavors with a hind of spices and fruits (I'm thinking like a spiced fig bar kind of smell)  T - The taste was big with a big malty, yeasty, biscuit backbone with hops on the back end to cut the sweetness in just the right balance, just a little of the alcohol lingers in between all of these notes to warm up the palatte as these flavors come across  M - An aggressive amount of carbonation, more than I expected..but I don't know if it's the reformed macro in me but it helped to deliver to flavors rather than dull them and I thought it worked well  D - This is a very balanced beer with several complex flavors competing and complementing each other at the same time. The higher ABV gives this a bit of alcohol punch that is deceptively lost in the flavor. Overall an excellent choice",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,PittBeerGirl,4.59,"A- When first poured I was surprised by how light the color of the body was. It was a quite cloudy translucent very pale straw yellow body. The body appeared quite watery but had a massive thick foamy white head that took forever to tame. The second pour from the bottom half of the bottle produced a more typical translucent golden straw yellow body with plenty of bubbles rising to the top and a good cloudiness from the yeast. This pour finally tamed to a nice thick collar but left little lacing behind.  S- This brew smells excellent. Big Spicy Belgian yeast nose with hints of citrus. Peppery spice, coriander, ginger, and banana are noted in the background.  T- This is a good, complex-yet simple brew. Up front is lots of coriander, ginger and banana. Then the yeast kicks in. A big sweet and spicy bready flavor kicks in from the yeast and added spices. The finish has a lot of hop taste and bitterness balanced by the spicy-bready taste already present. What lingers on the front of the palate is a sweet almost sugary bready taste while on the back of the palate is lots of spiciness and hints of bitterness and the tiniest bit of of an alcohol burn.  M- Lots of carbonation upfront-almost too much for my liking. It seems to fit with this brew. Big yeasty mouthfeel. Smooth light to medium bodied and delicious.  D- The alcohol is completely hidden by this brew and I love to taste and smell it again and again. This is a great saison and a great Belgian brew all around. I love this beer and I can't wait to try more from Ommegang.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,wfaulk,4.5,"Slightly orangey yellow, slightly cloudy. Small trails of bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. Absurdly large head, very creamy, retaining a lot of shape on its own, almost like shaving cream, with strong lacing as it subsides.  Yeasty, slightly fruity nose. A lot of earthiness.  Yeasty flavor. Almost sweet, but not quite. A small amount of bitterness in the aftertaste, but not much. Mild fruitiness, but no specific notes. It's somewhat hard for me to describe, but it's very nice.  Very carbonated, as if it were a soda with tiny bubbles. A slight thickness to it. It feels like it coats your mouth.  This is a very nice beer. I don't think I can say enough nice about it. I could drink it all night.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Monkeyknife,4.12,"Poured from a bottle a very cloudy orangish-yellow with a frothy white head and sticky lacing on the sides.  Smell is sweet with the aromas of bubblegum and flowers.  Taste is both tart and sweet with plenty of lemony citrus and yeast. The 7.5% alcohol is very well hidden.  Mouthfeel is on the lighter side, slightly slick to the palate and with little carbonation.  One of the great American Belgian-style ales. Surprisingly easy to drink and enjoy.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Mdog,4.32,"Appearance: Clear gold, big fluffy head, nice lacing.  Smell: For some reason, this smelled extremely floral to me. Almost exactly like a rose to be exact. After drinking almost the entire glass, the regular yeasty, grassy aromas came out.  Taste: Complex and tasty. Sweet bubblegum and honey, spicy pepper notes, a dry light citrus finish.  Mouthfeel: Quite light for a somewhat strong beer.  Drinkability: If it was in 6 packs this might be a little higher, in 750's it's more of a special occasion beer.  I visited the brewery back in 2003 when in Cooperstown to see the baseball hall of fame. I've had their beers since then by mail order, but now Minnesota has Ommegang. They make good Belgian styled beers, and the price is usually better than the imports. Hennepin is a very good beer, quite complex but easy to drink.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,wagenvolks,4.1,"12 oz. bottle into a Duvel glass.  An attractive, golden-blond pour leaves a monstrous white head and fairly decent lacing. A plume of carbonation rises up from the ""D"" in the bottom of the glass, providing the foam with good retention.  The aroma is quite yeasty, with some sweet sugar and floral undertones. A bit of spicy hops, vanilla, and biscuity malts make themselves noticed as well.  The taste is equally as good, with a smooth yeast / citrus character up front followed by bigger notes of hops, alcohol, spice, and more astringent citrus flavors. Mouthfeel detects a light, crisp body, fantastic carbonation, and (again) a great hoppy aftertaste.

Aroma is grassy, light fruitiness and some light hops.  Taste is mostly light citrus flavors and sweet. Light hops. Crisp and clean but nothing standing out.  Mouthfeel is spritzy, light bodied and quite dry at the end.  Overall, very easy to drink. A good session brew. Another nice feature is that this can go well with a variety of food. Quite flexible with food, so this makes a good beer to keep in the fridge at all times.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Durge,3.28,"This pours a dishwater grey/yellow, kind of cloudy, with a huge head of big time bubbles and plenty of lacing. The smell is very floral-biscuit but there is a sort of caustic overtone, something medicinal, of alcohol perhaps. The mouth finds a peppery introduction, very nicely carbonated and active, but the major flavor I detect is one of licorice. Bitter but very smooth and full bodied. Yeast presence is there but I can't get past this anisette quality that isn't really my favorite, and it aggressively overwhelms the taste buds right to the back of your throat. Quite dry but generally refreshing. I don't pick up hops or malt. It is something different and definitely a quality brew but this, like many other Belgian styles I've tried thus far, isn't right up my alley. Recommended for a try, this might be really special to the right palette.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,ohoove,4,"Pillowy, absolute white head filled with tiny bubbles that broke quickly but retained an excellent lacing throughout. Smell was a bit of citrus and malt with a little hoppiness , bread maybe- can't nail it. Hazy, urinesque color. Mouthfeel was smooth yet a kiss of fizz, spicey on the tongue, pepper, fruit. This is not one of my go to styles but I really did enjoy this beer and would gladly do a couple of bombers with friends during a cookout .",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,bluemoonswoon,4.63,"750mL bottle poured into tulip glass, no freshness date but does say to serve at 50F.  A: Pours a super (and I mean super) sticky and bubbly two inch head that fades into a thickish ring halfway through the glass leaving behind lacing all the way to the finish. Tightly packed bubbles coming up from all sides of the glass makes this one look especially inviting.  S: I can see why a lot of people would say this one smells like a dressed up macro lager. It has a bit a husky sweetness to it but not that much so that it should be confused with a macro. Peppery lemon and yeasty aromas dominate instead. Each is subtly balanced but still pungent enough to still be greedily inviting from across the room (I exagerate but still very good).  T/MF: Spicy upfront with a good balance of lemony and peppery herbal tones that even out with a good deal of yeast that makes the beer almost feel creamy as the beer warms in my mouth. Finishes rather fruity with tinges of apple, orange and coriander. Leaves the tongue a bit dry but not overly so, very refreshing kind of dryness that one might get from drinking sparkling water. Great complex beer in every facet.  D: Tastes super fresh and with nearly no alcohol heat to detract from the subtle flavorings. Great for a hot day, or any day for that matter. The heavy carbonation makes this one especially good after mowing the lawn and is quite quaffable by yourself, I had the whole 750mL by myself and was as lucid as when I first popped the cork on this one.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,garymuchow,4.37,"Nice to have this available in MN. Initially pours with an gihugic head of fullness, depth and density. Pours close to water color, but in glass is more yellow gold and very clear, which does become more cloudy as moves toward the bottom of the bottle. Distinctive rings left with every sip. Wonderful complexity to the aroma. Sweet, fruity, spicy, sour, yeasty, lightly malty, and even some hops thrown in. Seriously can just sit and enjoy this before even taking a sip. The flavor offers the same complexity as the aroma, but the balance and display varies. Nice dryness that is quite noticable. Softer fruitiness and mild spiciness. Mild bitterness. Alcohol warmth and just a touch in the taste. Sweetness is on the side of less noticeable. the flavor is less interesting and enjoyable compared to the aroma, but this is good, nonetheless. Quite smooth with the carbonation contributing less then expected, but again is showing greater presence towards the bottom of hte bottle. Nice feel. Sourness becomes more distinctive later. This is a beer worth the scores it receives. A great summer beer, now it's time to move outside and watch a fantastic thunderstorm move in and listen to Twins on the radio.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Patrick999,4.35,"A - Looks like a saison, maybe a little less cloudy than Dupont. Big fluffy head, golden color.  S - I got some weird vinous aromas upon popping the cork (which was a bitch...the thing just wouldn't budge). It initially smelled more like I just popped open a dry Merlot than a beer. That faded quickly, though, giving way to the grassy, lemony, aromas of a saison.  T, M - Impressive. Hoppy, lemony, spicy, with some assertive alcohol that just adds to the spiciness. Dry, and plenty bubbly. Wow....I'm not sure that I was expecting to love this as much as I do.  D - Outstanding. The tart, dry spiciness keeps you sipping, Hell of a value, too, compared to the Euro saisons. An American brewery brewed this? I knew this going in, of course, but it still strains credulity.

S: Citrus and fruit but not overpowering with a little bit of floral and yeast coming through  T: Excellent taste - a little bit of citrus but not too much fruit - excellent balance between not being to sweet or too bitter- very well balanced with alcohol  M: A great balance between being light but with body. Nice amount of carbonation - not too bubbly but not flat at all -The taste keeps going in your mouth after each sip.  D: Perfect beer for a relaxing day or evening.

42,141,objectivemonkey,4.68,"First off, I must confess, this is one of my favorite beers to drink. Tasty, good price, now available in MN, and from a brewery I respect a lot and have visited a couple times. Second, this is a two year old bottle, purchased right from the brewery 22 months ago. Third, this comes after a forum post in which everyone seems to think this beer does not age well. I will dispute that in the following.  Into its dedicated Hennepin glass, pours a somewhat hazy gold, slight yellow, with a large fluffy head, good staying power, decent lacing down the glass, lots of carbonation swirling about. The aroma, based on my previous review, has lost some edge, particularly the hops, but still maintains a generous spiciness, orange peel and coriander, still very nice.  The taste has always been good, and still is. Like the aroma, it seems to have mellowed out a little, but it retains the generous spicing of orange peel, cloves, the hops still departing an earthy feel and leading to a drying finish. The mouth is above medium, carbonation is fine but substantial.  So, I might say that a full two years might be a bit much for Hennepin... not that I regret it, but it seems to be at its best at about a year old, imo. As it stands, its still a delicious beer that I thoroughly enjoy.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

42,141,jdoncbus,4.3,"750ml bottle poured into goblet.  Pours a hazy, bubbly gold with a large fluffy head. Heavy lacing.  The nose is peppery, wood, and dull lemon followed by those old candies called ""Bottle Caps"" - tart with faint cola. Interesting to say the least.  A very complex taste. Bringing the glass to the mouth you get a whiff of the tart - hitting the palette I can make out some citrus peel, pepper, and wood. Actually reminds me a bit of a Corsican moonshine called Pastise (sp?) I had when visiting the Mediterranean Island. I was told Pastise was made from grape stems and it also had a very woody taste.  The mouthfeel is jumpy with the usual Saison bubbles, mildly oily and left somewhat tart with a pepper finish. A slight warmth of alcohol lingers.  Pretty damn drinkable and pleased that I finally ran across this offering. I will enjoy sharing it with others and will certainly tango with it again.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

42,141,SilentSabre,2.71,"Heard so much about this beer and having been a BA for nearly four years, I cannot believe I am only now trying it for the first time. The 12oz bottle poured into my pint glass a cloudy yellow orange colour with a snow white head probably three inches thick. Looks nice. Smell was good, but rather off for the style, I thought. Smell was more akin to a tripel than a farmhouse saison. The damp, musty, basement smell present in nearly every saison I have ever had is totally abscent in this one. Taste, too was far from a saison, IMO. Also, likely the worst thing about this is the detectable level of alcohol. To me, a farmhouse saison should be smooth and easy drinking, smell like a mouldy, damp basement, and have a rather pronounced tartness. This is bereft of any of the afore mentioned traits, and again, if I were just given this to drink, not knowing what it was, I'd probably enjoy it and exlaim, ""I've had better tripels, but this one's not bad.."" I don't know guys, for all the hype surrounding this one, I must admit, I'm quite dis-pleased with it. Perhaps I got a bad bottle.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Aromas are passion fruit, pears and some berries, strawberry with a nice non-overpowering alcohol smell in there. Taste is great, the same fruits, some pineapple. Very smooth, somewhat dry and earthy, which must be the hops showing through. Saisons are a great beer, and to find a state-side brewery that does it this well is quite a treat.

42,141,ccrida,3.28,"I've had this one on tap a few times, and while it's one of my favorite styles, I was never too impressed with the Hennepin. This is my first bottle. As soon as I twisted the cage loose, the corked exploded out, with a little bit of gush, but a relatively easy pour, into my St. Feuillien Goblet. The Saison is a golden yellow with tons of streamers and a big, pillowly white head. While I'd rather it a bit cloudy, the head is really gorgeous, and with the effervescence, continues to grow in a nice rocky fashion. It is very slow to subsided and leaves blankets of foam and lace to the very end.  The smell is sweet, some honey and vanilla, a bit floral, with rustic grain, a decent bite of booze, and a hint of diactyle as it warms. Overall, more omphh and saison-like then it is on draft, so it's off to a good start, although still on the understated side.  Well, so far this has been much better then the draft version, which was bland and unobjectable. While the taste certainly isn't bland, it's really not too good. Initially there's some sweetness, but it's quickly overcome by a husky astringency, is a tad chalky, rather hot and boozy. Letting it warm too much, it gets worse, funky, but not in that fun belgian way, just off, with a bit of diactyle. Overall, it seems like they were more focused with making it taste rough for that farmhouse authenticity, rather then taste really good. I'm not so hard points wise on the graininess, but booze is too much to ignore, especially for only 7.7.  The mouthfeel is very creamy, medium light bodied.  This wasn't too drinkable. It was just too husky and astringent, and not enjoyable enough. While the heat might fade in cellar, I'm not so sure about those grain tannins.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,BWMKappaSig,4.55,"Appearance - Cloudy yellow-gold with a very thick head filled with countless small bubbles (I might have stirred up the yeast too much).  Smell - Immediately noticable sourness, without being overly funky. A slight citrus note with definite hints of pepper. Wonderfully floral bouquet.  Taste - Mildly spicy with a citrus hops character to it. As it warms, it sweetens well. Yeasty, but not overwhelmingly so. This is far more complex than most beers I am used to, but extremely enjoyable.  Mouthfeel - As crisp and pleasantly carbonated a beer as I have ever had. This is as wonderful of a mouthfeel as I have ever had.  Drinkability - Based on the crispness and the complex taste, one would never guess this was nearing 8% ABV.

Tight head. Lots of bubbles. Highly carbonated. A pretty good looking beer when poured in the proper glassware. I used a Duvel tulip glass.  Light hoppiness in the aroma. Peppery. Sour overtones, some horseblanket which is typical of the farmhouse ales.  Flavor is tart/sour but only lightly. Not overpowering at all.This beer has a clean, crisp feeling to it in the beginning before it trails off leaving a dry,slightly bitter aftertaste. Very drinkable especially on a warm summer day.  Malts used have a toasty/buiscuty flavor which shows up in the middle. Balance between the malts and hops are good. Classic belgian yeast characteristics. At the very end you have a mild alcohol warmth that helps comfort you.  Two 12oz bottles with your BBQ makes for a relaxing time.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,sleazo,4.06,"Greenpoint Deli has the whole Ommegang ouevre so I am going through it.  A-A meringue like cloud with peaks and valleys tops a semi clear dark golden liquid. There is a steady stream of bubbles replenishes this beauty of a head. The head here truly is a work of art.  S-a musky sweetness with some banana and clove like flavours going on. The smell as a whole is subdued slightly and I have had Saisons that smell a bit stronger. However this is a good smelling brew.  D-The fluffy head hits your senses as you inhale which gets those scents to meld very nicely with the taste. It is slightly sweet with those same banana/clove flavours a slight bitterness and a slight funky acidity. The farmhouse taste that I have detected in stronger versions is there but muted. Still this is pretty tasty. The hops are there as a bitterness but I can't detect them in the aroma or flavour.  M-Slightly thick with less carbonation than I expected due to the steady stream of bubbles. Still for what the beer tastes like the mouthfeel does a goodjob of getting the flavours to linger in the mouth. the wonderful head also helps too.  D-Not the best Saison I have ever had as I could go with a little more musky farmhouse taste. By farmhouse I mean what others call horseblanket, but I have never rode a horse no less tasted their blanket. So I take it to be that musty funk I have detected in others. I take this to be more of a combo Tripel/Saison type of beer. Still this is one heck of a beer and since it is in state for me costs half of what the imports cost. Will buy again.  Edit-At the end of the bottle i decided to pour the yeast in unlike what the bottle recommends. I have a smaller chalice so i get three glasses out of a 750 so the first two were sans yeast and the third included it. The yeast adds the funk i was looking for. The bottle says dont pour it in, which i think works for half the beer",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,joe1510,4.3,"750ml Bottle $5.99 Binny's Orland  Hennepin pours a hazy straw golden with tiny natural carbonation bubbles rising to the surface. A two finger white eggshell head forms on the pour that sticks around awhile leaving chunky lace after each sip that falls back to the body. A very good looking saison.  Aroma is tough to pick up through the dense head. Slight lemon sourness. The classic barnyard scents are in there as well but toned down. Freshly cut hay. Very refreshing. Aromas fit together seamlessly.  Mildly tart lemon upfront. The tartness lingers as subtle grassy undertones show up mid palate. Finishes with a nice grassy, lemongrass hoppiness. Touch of alcohol on the swallow. There's even some of that Belgian candi sugar feel although I don't think any is added. Very refreshing.  Crisp, clean (for a saison) light bodied mouthfeel. Finishes bone dry letting the hops come forward. Very nicely done.  In the summer months I could tip back Hennepin all day long. Such an easy sipper and so refreshing.  Hennepin is a beer that is constantly stocked in my fridge. One of my favorite summer sippers and at an affordable price. Not as funky as a couple of my favorites but as thirst quenching and enjoyable as a saison can get.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Onslow,3.32,"Sitting here ..in Houston, humidity 98% and a homemade pizza in the oven: Its time for my 750ml bottle of Hennepin...  Pours a light honey colour..  Nice sized head on pour, but disappears after 15mins with the glass i was using..  Straight up farmhouse smell, but not as funky as some from belgium..  Good bitterness level.. Sweetness is also done very nicely.. ..a good balance..  aftertaste is very good but maybe needs a bit more assertiveness...  Overall, I am happy i tried this brew but am at a loss wether it is as good as Dupont, Hennepin seems a bit sweeter and not enough bitterness to make it a great- but still I did enjoy it!!  ...Music- ""Lady Dana"" 'Climax' -the CD ...",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Beautiful golden, slightly hazy, with a plentiful white head with very long retention. Smell is yeasty, fruity and earthy, but it had a few unpleasant notes, soap like. Firm and highly refreshing, it lacks a little bit in depth, but it is still pleasantly yeasty, fruity, with multiple citric notes that unfortunately fade quite quickly.

It proved to be an excellent relief. At 7.7% ABV it was the lowest of the evening. I loved everything about this beer. The appearance was a nice cloudy golden hue.

Nose: Smells like summer, which is a sour citrus, light hops and hint of apples.  Taste: This was kept a little too cold for my liking so I gave it time to warm up and let some of the flavours loose. Tart lemon zest flavor that moves to a sweeter flavor finishing up with a hint of hops. Generally subtle flavors.  Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Proper carbonation and mid to light bodied. I could have a couple on a hot summer day, but would stop at two.  Notes: Solid all around Saison.

The flavor are much the same as the aroma led on, spicy with citrusy zest. Some fruity notes of apples and pears creep in. Alcohol is noticeable but not harsh, medium bodied. Some musty farmhouse notes in the background too.  Overall: not all that complex of a beer, but absolutely delicious and well made.

D: I bottle these in the small 12 oz, bottles but could but down a big boy with ease.  Overall: A great domestic version of a Saison. Summer is the season to enjoy a saison and this one is thirst quenching. I just finished cooking burgers on the grill and popped this one open.

Slight fruity aroma, green apples, flowery almost spring-like aromas, if that makes sense. The mouth feel was huge because of the high carbonation. The taste was extremely light with the co2 rolling around in the mouth. Slightly spicy flavors, but very subtle. Finishes very crisp and clean.

42,141,BBM,4.72,"This beer poured a golden honey color into a Hennepin goblet. A thin fizzy head lay atop this beer. To be honest the appearance belies how wonderful this beer really is. Aroma was very subtle, but had it's fair share of Belgian spices, sweet malt, and bread-like quality.  The taste is a magnificent blend of Belgian ingredients and American micro brewing. There is so much depth, so much flavor bursting with each sip, you'll wonder aloud if this beer was brewed in a monastery or not. The Belgian spices, banana-like flavor, dark fruits, and beautiful hop balance all come together without a hitch. There is a very subtle alcohol flavor in the finish, and as the beer warms it becomes that much more enjoyable.  Mouthfeel is perfectly smooth, with just the right amount of carbonation. I would drink this one all night if I could, but it does get a touch filling. Overall this is a beer that can be measured up to any of the abbey ales I've tried. And it's from upstate NY.

S: Terrific smell of citris, especially lemon.  T: Very complex flavor, with lemon zest and spices lingering on the back of the tongue. Memorable taste.  M: Pleasing, light, but gripping mouthfeel. Great carbonation for this style.  D: I could definitely have a few of these in the course of an evening - rather light and refreshing, but full of flavor as well.

T: The first taste on the tongue is that off some light hops followed by some light citrus; lemon rind, apricots, maybe some orange. There is good complexity in this brew with several layers of interesting flavors including some funky earthy and herbal elements. It finishes clean, dry, and with a slight tartness.

42,141,MiguelMandingo,4.13,"This beer is a favorite of mine, and the best offering from Ommegang IMHO. Good price for a good ABV, no doubt.  Poured part of a 750ml into an oversized wineglass.  Appearance - 2 finger head that doesn't quit. It is a clear fizzy golden yellow beer with a constant stream of bubbles. This is one of the only fizzy yellow beers that I am proud to drink, in fact. I poured the first glass an hour ago, the head is STILL THERE. STILL!!! Amazing. Looks almost as good as a Duvel.  Smell - Yeasty, clovey, citrusy and sweet floral honey. Smells like a Belgian.  Taste - Yeasty and spicy with a hoppy bitter finish. Tastes much like the smell but with more sharpness. Ommegang packs a lot of flavor into this one.  Mouthfeel - Crisp with a capital C. Near perfect carbonation level. The flavor and mouthfeel work together in near perfect harmony. Goes down smooth.  Drinkability - Awesome. I feel like I could finish another 750ml with little to no problems.  I would describe this brew as sharp - it cuts right through on every level. The ABV is almost completely unnoticeable, which lends itself to easily be a session brew. Of the saisons I have sampled, this one is easily in the top 5.

It's a very lively beer with loads of carbonation and tons of flavor.  There's no hint of alcohol, even though it's much stranger than American macro brews.

Flavor wise it is incredibly flavorful with all the Belgianness you could want: tons of funky overripe fruits, a bit of grass and hay, with a tight dry finish. This sample is a bit cleaner than Belgian saisons, especially Dupont and Fantome, a trait I find in many American Belgians.

Solid, densely-packed white head of good duration and with fine lacing, a full finger easily. The nose here is worth the price of admission, with the rare spiciness of the yeast verily prickling at the nasal passages, inviting wet horseblankets and dull fruity malt components up for drinks in the wee hours. Better than I remember in this regard. Equal parts tangy and sweet on the first sip, coating the tongue and promoting a sense of degustation; where's that sampler platter at? Pale malts sing the high notes in the background as the middle is cajoled through the wheaty-meaty bits, and the zest of the yeast parying a bit in the foreground, but not quite asI remembered from my last go-round some years back. Dry around the finish and with enough hop aromatics to make you notice them, but even for the stylistic interpretation that is Hennepin this is a rather tame component. Not a small beer by any means, it drinks so easily you'll forget where you left your car keys if you're not lucky. Some lemon rind peaking through here and there, but nothing to be overly offended by, and in the end this feels a bit tame overall. Still, this is the first time I've had it on draught, and seeing as how it's back it won't be the last. I look forward to another go . . .",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Large solid fluffy white head retains with ease. Smell is dominated with a funky yeastiness, and various spices, deep and complex smell overall with some fruit esters popping through.  Taste is neutral enough for Hennepin to be chugged down on a hot day.Yet, complex enough to be enjoyed throughly anytime of the year.  An influx of spicy and unrelenting hops build a beautiful foundation for all the flavors to come. Intense earthiness along with a dry spiciness throughout with ginger accents on the fringes. The ginger works perfectly with the dry spiciness. The yeast is providing a lot of the flavor as well, especially the earthiness. A hint of citrus peel is thrown into the mix about halfway through, giving lead way to the flawless finish. Hennepin finishes with that spiciness lingering, albeit now much more refined then the start. It's almost as this beer starts untamed, and then at the end of your sip you have taken it into captivity.  I have to say one of the best parts about this beer, is the truly decedent mouthfeel.

What's more, I recently brewed a saison myself, and until it's ready, Ommegang will have to hold me over.  APPEARANCE: Pours a slightly hazy pale yellow with barely a gold highlight. A huge white pillowy head forms and fades to a rocky loose-bubbled cap.  SMELL: Huge yeasty smell reminiscent of the finest ales from Belgium. A vague aroma of bready funk comes through. Citrus is apparent as is apricot. Hop aroma is non-existant.  TASTE: Incredible flavors come through all at once. Sweet caramel malts, bready and funky yeast, sweet orange, and a hop bitterness and flavor that really holds its own. The finish is only the faintest bit dry and somewhat yeasty. This is really a taste to behold.  MOUTHFEEL: Medium to light bodied with a sharp carbonation. Fairly refreshing given the body.  DRINKABILITY: Now THIS is what I want to be drinking this summer. Goes down so incredibly easy and hides the 7.7% pretty well. All in all a delicious beer.  I can only hope my homebrewed saison comes close to this beer's awesomeness.

It's also grainy with a subtle banana and peppery spice.  The taste is super spicy, and that good Belgian funk and tartness. Slight bitter finish.  There is a moderately high carbonation to this beer, but it does have a somewhat creamy feel and eventually finishes dry.  I could put a 4 pack of this away on a Spring or Summer day.

Appearance: golden, cloudy, perfectly conditioned. A thin off-white lacing up the inside of the glass and over the rim tells me it had a good head on it when it was poured. The head reduced to a fine layer of thin bubbles which didn't go away until the beer got warmer and I had consumed most of it.  Smell: lightly spicy, a little citrusy... it was hard to tell with the smell of food in the air. Very enticing, though. I just had to take a sip...  Taste: flippin awesome. Citrusy hops, spicy goodness and yummy yeastiness (is that a word?). I had to go to Ommegang's site to see what they had put in there: gingersnap! Unbelievable.  Mouthfeel: crispy, sweet, a little lingering resin from the hops and an interesting ""je ne se qua"" from the yeast.  Drinkability: definitely drinkable. I want another, but next time I'm going for the bottle. Another magnificent brew from Cooperstown.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,blakesell,4.33,"750ml bottle Poured into a belgian goblet/cereal bowl style glass.  Great how Ommegang's beers hold together, cork pops right off yet no head even attempts to escape.  Appearance: Pours a cloudy yellow hefe like colour with a thick creamy head. Tiny bubbles rise for hours as this beer sits, was poured too cold so I let it sit to get to proper tasting temperature. Lacing never fades on this beer.  Smell: Slight barnyard, sweet and earthy if that's possible. Belgian yeast for certain. Lots of spices. Corriander, Orange, Allspice?  Taste: Slight horsy flavor, candi sugars, spices big time, they could have even eased up on the candi sugars a little on this one. It's quite sweet for the ""farmhouse saison"" flavor that they claim it to be, but quite nice for the style and very drinkable.  Mouthfeel: Plenty of carbonation and a sweet/sour flavor that lingers on the tounge.  Overall: Damn this is a great beer. Ommegang really came thru for me on this one, my only thing that I don't love is that the candi sugar is a bit upfront. About 6 mos of aging and that sugar would likely mellow out and be a near perfect beer. I'd like to witness this brew's steps in the brewery. An absolute pleasure to drink that I will come back to again and again.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,RichThatchr,3.75,"I had this on tap at Waterzooi tonight and it felt different from the bottle version I was used to. It alternated between a little watery and having the coriander zing to it above the chunky grains. It looked great in its glass, but I was a little taken aback as I seem to like the bottle version better overall.  Strangely, the after taste came to me 5 minutes after I left the bar with the previously mentioned banana esters and the bitterness of the hops. I thought maybe the keg was on the way out, so I'll hold back on any further thoughts.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,FenwaySquid,4.92,"Presentation: 750 ML bottle, no dating of any kind, poured into the Hennepin slender golbet style glass that was sold with the bottle.  Appearance: Pours a hazy pale golden color, light carbonation rising inside. The head formeda thick, creamy off-white color that faded slightly but maintained throughout.  Aroma: Peppery, spicey, tough to describe but very inviting.  Taste: Lemony and up front, then cloves, yeast and alcohol follow seemingly all at once. Sweet and spicy flavors battle and balance each other perfectly. The finish is dry and spicy but not bitter. Overall, exquisite.  Mouthfeel: Crisp, smooth, and creamy. The carbonation was also in good balance.  Overall: I'm honestly in shock that something this good is made here in the good ol' USA. No offense to American brewers, but beer this good is usually exclusive to Belgium. Arguably the best beer made in this entore country. If you have not tried this yet, do so immediately.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Apples and pears. Hops in the nose also.  T: White wine grapiness, very lite barnyard funk, pretty tame for the style for me. Herbal hoppiness.  M: Very dry, hoppy, and bitter.  D: Pretty good. Too hoppy and too mild in all the other flavors, to me, for the style. I'll take a Saison Dupont or De Glazen Toren Saison any day of the week.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,2LBrew,4.75,"On Tap at a favorite beer bar.   Appearance: Pours somewhat whitish yellow color. Head adheres to the glass.  Smell: A very spicy beer. It has a different type of smell that is remarkably good.  Taste: I was expecting a strong, overpowering taste, but it was very drinkable and satisfying to the taste buds.  Mouthfeel: Smooth all the way. Very light and soft, providing a bit of tingly sensation with every sip.  Drinkability: Alcohol is hardly noticable with exceptional flavor.  This beer was a great find. After attending the Strong Ale fest in San Francisco this year, I really have taken to Strong Ales. I would recommend if you are looking to broaden your beer drinking scope. If you are not comfortable with drinking beer out of a something other than a pint glass, avoid this one.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Newsman,4.42,"I had to grab this when I saw it at Sparrow's in Hoboken, having had a taste at the South Street Seaport during Beerfest in September. Comes in a very hefty, corked bottle. Beautiful presentation.  I don't have a goblet, so I used a tulip glass. (Heretical, I know.) Big massive head on this one, cloudy appearance, reminiscent of a witbier. I could see the yeast at the bottom of the bottle.  Smells fabulous -- citrus, spice, a little bit of hops. Even my wife, who generally dislikes beer, remarked on how good it smelled.  Taste...wow. Some ginger, coriander, citrus, some hops, all at play, but it isn't overwhelming...very subtle and fun. It's very light, decent carbonation, feels great in the mouth. Goes down very lightly. The taste changes as the beer warms. It's very complex, yet very drinkable.  Drinking Hennepin made me want to have a beer tasting party. Maybe some Asian-fusion-barbeque. Yeah. And it was only $4.95 at Sparrow's, FYI. Great deal. I'll be back next weekend for another couple bottles.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Poured straight from the store temp (55-60) to my goblet. Beautiful golden color with a thick white fluffy head that lasted half way through leaving a pretty ""bridal panty"" lacing.  It smelled kind of funky/sour?, but ok just the same.  I like the taste, it's sweet/sour/hot/spicy and the alcohol warms at the end.  It has mucho carbination but feels good in the mouth, I swirlled the glass as it got low and like the fuzzy foam in my mouth.  Very, very drinkable, I'm glad I got 3 and tomorrow I'll probably go back for 3 more!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,sethmeister,4.43,"750ml corked and caged into chimay chalice  Pours a hazy gold with deep creamy meringue-like head which lasts the life of the beer and leaves generous sticky lace.  Nose is pears, banana, lemon, a lovely sweet / sour yeasty belgian funk and a bit of peppery spice.  Flavors include banana, pear, lemon and a hoppy and spicy bitterness toward the end finishing with that belgian yeast sourness. Dry finish.  Biting carbonation with a light thin mouthfeel and an astringent finish.  Drinkability is excellent and the alcohol presence is very well hidden. Wish I had another bottle.  This pairs brilliantly with comte cheese incidentally.  I must get more of this beer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,kkipple,3.71,"Hennepin fills my goblet with an amazing amount of fluffy, rocky, meringue style head  easily half the glass! 2 inches at the very least  shades of an Duvel style head here the ale itself is a very pale gold, with vigorous carbonation that assists the (now rapidly falling) head. Short lived as the head is, its certainly a beaut! Ahh, what the heck, Ill add some more beer to the glass just to revive the thing  The smell is subdued, but I get an extremely Belgian yeast shock when I stick my nose into the glass. Fruity, sour esters and spice notes jump out as well. Lemon and an acidic tartness linger in the background.  Taste is rather tripel-like: pale malts, alcohol, coriander, clove, fruity rose / sour apple, some unripe pear perhaps? Interesting and mild, not in your face, which adds to the drinkability, in my opinion. A good beer, but not one Im crazy about.  Mouthfeel is creamy, mildly dry, and finishes estery sour. Quite nice for what it is.  Hennepin is a fine American example of a Belgian-style Saison. A rather complex and excellent sipping beer. An real steal at $6 for a 750ml bottle.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,goochpunch,4.4,"Pours out a shimmering and slightly hazed gold with lots of bubbles in the body and a thick, frothy, fluffy head that maintains its size and clings to the side of the glass, leaving elaborate lacing patterns. Aroma starts off with a sweet mix of vanilla, jasmine, apricots and sweet oranges, with underlying bready and grainy smells. Alcohol is in there but doesn't detract too much. Flavor starts with a bit of grain, but underneath it is a malty, bready, and slightly nutty body. Belgian yeast characteristics are there with the fruity esters with a definite apricot presence. Hops add a great floral touch that really expands in the aftertaste. Finishes dry and rather clean. Only thing really detracting here is a warm alcohol presence which I'd rather not be experiencing. Mouthfeel is incredible. Isn't at all weighty from the alcohol level. Bubbly in the mouth, but not overly prickly: just enough to bring out the subtle flavors. Pretty drinkable, but I just wish the alcohol presence were a bit more subdued.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

A - Before I poured, I noticed that the bottle had TONS of stuff on the bottom. Poured out, it's a hazy light orange color. Decent head and carbonation.  S - Fruit, slight malt.

The smell is a floral, zesty blend of lemon, orange, banana, and Belgian yeast. The flavor follows, with the addition of subtle vanilla, corriander, and a pleasant, warming buzz of alcohol.  The mouth is complex and well carbonated. It is lively and volatile on the palate, with a lingering, yet ultimately clean finish. Good drinkability, but the alcohol and dense flavor might prevent it from acting as a true session brew.  Amazing overall. Best saison I have had.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

S: Complex swirl of florals, yeast, peppery spices and a little orange. T: So much going on with this. Tartness up front with a little orange and some sweet malt followed with numerous spices - coriander most notably - and some yeast. Hops comes through predominantly towards the end. Interplay between all of these things is constant throughout and changes as it warms. M: Carbination makes this pretty airy and bubbly. Really dry finish that screams give me more.

SO, for my review I'm going to stray from the usual format. This was a tasty brew, straw colored and a bit musty in the aroma. The taste - ignore the serve at 50 recommendation on the bottle. Much better around 60.  This is one of those mild brews that sneaks around and smacks you upside the head with a surprising complexity. The key is serving at the right temp. Too cold and you miss it.

42,141,williamherbert,3.82,"Appearance is a very light and golden color. Thick and bubbly head, much like an root beer float. Tons of carbonation. Almost looks like a white wine, to some degree.  Deep, spicy Belgian scent. Has a nice sour smell. Appealing, slightly wine-like aroma. It smells sweet and even a bit flowery.  Very strong and pungent taste. Bursting with serious, HOT Belgian flavor. Almost takes my breath away due to its strength. Close to a liquor in flavor.  Light and bubbly feel, but with a major kick on the back end. There is even that hard liquor ""burn"" at the end. This is delicious, but let's face it, it's a one-off because of its strength.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,atsprings,4.35,Poured a pale orange with a slowly diminishing head that left decent lacing on the glass. The aroma was malty with a light fruitiness that was accompanied by a good spiciness. The great spiciness overpowered the taste. There was a good balance of hops and malt that provided a good background to the spices. The beer sits lightly and very crisp on the tongue. The alcohol was also well hidden. This is a very enjoyable beer.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

42,141,bluegrassbrew,4.33,"From a 750 corked and caged. I poured gently as not to disrupt the yeast at the bottom. It is a lovely bronze color with a thick white head with the prevelent carbonation of any good belgian style ale. Smells interestingly sweet and sour and the same time. I got hints of candy as well as a slight musk. Upon first tasting it was apparent that this was a belgian at heart. Sweet candy malts on the front, but a bit of hops came through later. The biggest taste left with me after each sip was of a sourish funk, and I mean that in a good way. Very unique, as this was my first foray into the saison category. Wonderful mouthfeel and highly drinkable. I actually paired it with a southern style potato salad on zesty vegetable crackers and that really brought out the flavor. Highly enjoyable!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

S-Fairly sweet with fruity esters, but overall far more reminiscent of a simple pilsner. A little piney hops.  T-Somewhat sweet with little hop balance- very slight bitterness, almost an orange peel bitter, or maybe grapefruit. Very strong flavor that I picked up and tried to place, I think it's honeydew. Surprisingly, alcohol is barely in there.  M-Highly carbonated with a relatively light body and dry finish.  D-The beer is good, but not as complex as I was expecting, and far more drinkable-dangerously so for a 7.7.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Gmann,3.88,"Poured out of a 750ml corked and cage bottle. The color is like a hazy miller lite, though the second half of the bottle was more orange in color. The white head is nice soapy and rocky, that left some real nice lacing on the side of the glass. The smell is not very strong, it kind of reminds me of a pilsner, with the noble hops. The taste is of Belgian yeast, tart apple, some sweetness and finishes with a slight bitterness to balance the flavors. This ale drinks very much like a lager, it has nice carbonation and finishes crisp.

Taste: A very spicy tartness with alcohol in the nose, cloves and pepper, the flavors linger and then end with a very dry finish. Suggestions of lime, anise, rosemary, oregano? I'm trying to place some flavors, but this has so much going on.  Mouthfeel: Light and crisp, carbonation is bubbly, body is medium and slick, finish is very dry, leaves you wanting more.

42,141,Winter,4.33,"Hennepin is the 2nd beer from Brewery Ommmegang that I've tried. The first was their Witte beer, that I enjoyed quite a bit. This sample came from the 12 oz bottle.  Hennepin pours hazy golden in color with a thick micro-bubble white head. It leaves a thick soapy lacing down the side of the glass. The nose consists of peach, pineapple, hops, bready malt, vanilla, banana and some spicy yeast. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and airy. Soft from carbonation, yet crisp at the same time. The taste has a spicy front combined with fruit flavors. Middle is sweet with some banana and maybe a touch of wheat. At this point things turn acidic with a lemony twang. Hennepin finish dry.  Impressive to say the least. Despite the 7.7% abv, this is a light drinking saison. It would be easy to quaff a few of these on a warm summer afternoon.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,paleoplant,4.45,"This is one of those beers that turned me on to the style. I feel that Ommegang produces a wonderful saison. The appearance was a light straw color with a good head. The foam remained for a long time. The smell was unique and unclassifiable. Someone told me it had a hint of horse-blanket, and I would have to say I agree. Besides this aspect, the taste and mouth feel were wonderful.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Jwaks,4.05,"Serving 750ml bottle  This beer has great looks with a light golden yellow body revealing a storm of carbonation welling up to an awesome dense, thick and frothy half finger thick white head. Lacing and retention are great, this brew's head just refuses to give up, it's so thick and rich that beer can't be seen through the tight, dense frothy cap. The color could be a bit richer with a bit of haze.  The nose is quite aromatic, rife with brown pears, red delicious apples, honey, a bit of allspice, floral meadow flowers and bready yeast with hints of earthy spices, lemon zest and buttery phenols.  Loads of sweet sickle pear, light honey, a bit of tart golden delicous apple flavors make a smooth entry with a bit of bitter yeast with more apple peaking on the mid palate paired with a bit of allspice, spicy alcohol, lemon zest and fresh cut hay flavors. A welcome smooth finish boasts creamy mouthfeel with more sweet honeyed autumn fruit and buttery phenols melding into a delicious spicy finish with a kick of sweet lemon zest and pale malt. This is sweeter than other saisons which aptly emphasize spicy floral flavors rather than sweet honeyed autumn fruit though this has a great pale malt body to support it's sweet fruity flavor. A bit too sweet and refined for a saison, a saison should be a bit wild and unrefined, it needs a more piquant spices!  Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, great for a saison, with just enough bitter hops to slightly pucker the mouth on the mid palate and finish. This is just not complex enough for to keep my drinking more than one bottle though a few glasses is a great achievement in itself.  Wow, new Belgium has sprung up in Cooperstown NY! Kudos to Ommegang for brewing a great, fruity saison!  Cheers!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Smell is spicy malt and with a hint of hops. Taste is fruit and spice with enough malt and hops to make it a well rounded taste. Nice full mouth feel. The 7.7% alcohol is hidden nicely.

42,141,Onibubba,4.02,"From the large bottle into a tulip. Large white head which dissipates rather quickly into a somewhat foamy, sticky mess. Cloudy pale yellow. Lots of floaties suspended in bottle, but allowing it to warm and settle before pouring helped. Subsequent porus did not yield as much head. Aroma is much funkier and spicier than I remember from the smaller bottles. This is good. Taste is also better than I remembered. Slightly tart, some nice white pepper spice to it, and a slight case of the funk. Mothfeel is a bit too high on the corbonation for my liking, but this calms down if you allow the beer to sit and warm.  Like most Saisons I've had the pleasure of trying, the drinkability of this beer is quite high. Alcohol is a non issue and taste is not extreme enough in either direction (bitter vs sweet) to limit drinkability. After embracing Dupont, I looked upon this beer with some disdain. That was a dis-service. This is a fine beer, nicely priced, and easier to obtain than most Saisons.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

During our tour, we tried Hennepin and I was impressed. So, I decided to grab a bottle and try it again, at home (standard bottle, pilsner glass).  It poured wonderfully and showed off an impressive yellow/amber color. The head was plentiful and lasted well into the review.  Upon lifting the glass to my nose, the aroma was strong, but pleasant (spicy, citrusy).  Hennepin has a smooth start and a decent amount of cabonation. To me, the spices become more evident in the middle and the finish, but not overly so. All in all, a smooth experience from start to finish.  I have since bought several bottles to keep on hand, and I would definitely recommend this beer to all.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

The beads of carbo were very fast rising and spiraled to the top sustaining the head on top. This lasted the entire drink of 25 min. or so. Fresh green apple smell and a different sweet fruity smell also. Inviting smell that leads into similar tastes. Didn't know what to expect with taste because this was my first saison, but was impressed. Champagne-like dryness and fizziness. Sourness of like, a white grape thats not quite ripe. Fizzy mouthfeel but not overdone. Very drinkable and will have to try this again and some other saisons.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

When I first tried this beer before I didn't really like it, but the recent trip to the brewery changed my mind quite a bit. The beer is supposed to taste rustic and earthy, and in furthering my beer appreciation I think I respect this beer a lot more now. At a small bar in town I drank it all friday night (and it sure does sneek up on you...) I couldn't get enough of it. It changes so much with temperature being more grainy and earthy at colder temps, then warming up to a huge array of citrus, spices, and hops.

T: A beautiful balance of sweet malts and esters balanced by a nice sharp bitterness and spiciness. Also a nice backdrop of horseblanket that rounds things out. I have to say that even though the bottle says to leave the yeast behind, I think the added yeast really improves the character, making everything softer and mellower.

42,141,hseritt,3.59,"Got this from the standard 12oz Hennepin bottle and poured it into a lager-style glass. It honestly did have one of the tightest foam heads I've seen in a while. Head was a very clean white-capped 2"" foam. The foam dissipated very quickly and left a very nice lacing throughout the drink. The color of the beer was a light gold.  The smell was very faint. I even ordered a second one just for another opportunity to see if I missed something (I promise!) in the scent.  The alcohol content for Hennepin is relatively high for domestics (about 7% or so). However, the taste shined through the alcohol very easily. One could taste things like lemon and light hops but not fruity enough to make one stand up and take note (the fruitiness in beer is honestly not much my thing -- so nothing lost too much).  The feel was light but definitely not too light. I detected a fair amount of chewiness but not a heck of a lot. Again I am neutral on this.  I could very easily entertain a session of Hennepin but without the price I found at a local pub. I would drink it again gladly... unfortunately, for the moment there are other ales that have caught my attention over this one.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

A very nice beer to enjoy. I watched it during a movie and it held my attention more than the movie did I believe.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,TexIndy,4.88,"Poured from a 750ml corked and caged bottle - no visible dating system. Picked this up in Indy during Xmas with the folks and just found out going to be avail again in Texas!!! I poured it into my Delirium Tremens tulip glass and it was a golden yellow color. It had a tremendous head with bunch of initial carb that settled into a thin foam with great lacing. The aroma was spicy and fruity but just a little too subtle to be a 5 but it's close. The mouthfeel was perfect was for me - it had a great creamy feel with a tongue tickling from the carbonation. The taste was also perfect. It's sweeter and less dry than some other saisons I've had which is perfect for me since I favor sweet over dry. Overall, this is a top 5 beer for me and I can't wait till available in Texas again. Highly, highly recommend. (5, HR, T, Y, HOF)",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,PEBKAC,4.27,"Cooperstown edition Brewery direct, shipped in a gift pack  Golden & lush; intensely frothy. The pour was not quite clear & golden, so I most likely stirred up some yeast. Yeast is good for you!  Musty, funky fruit, sweet muscatel. Alot of wine characteristics in both the smell & flavor. The alcohol stings my nostrils a tad, but isn't totally evident in the taste. The finish is somewhat tangy, along with the obvious corriander spice. Bready to the point of inducing continued sampling.  Rereshing & not filling, but the carbonation does hit quicker then your average ale. Savoring the bottle is the most safe & delectable way to go. Easy to play, hard to master.  Now stocked regularly at Stop n Shop, alongside other Duvel products. Excellent. :)",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Georgiabeer,3.76,"Pours a cloudy golden with a big white head that retains pretty well and leaves quite good lacing. Smells of typical Belgian yeasty flavors with some clove and light apple in the mix. There is also quite a pungent sharp smell there as well that cuts through everything. Tastes a little sharp as well, but not necessarily in abad well- kinds a more stinky cheese flavor. Complex, with ripe, musty flavors and some subdued stone fruit. Fades to a more typical saison light yeastiness on the end. Decent body, good balance between creaminess and crispness, but finishes a little limp. Pretty drinkable, a a good value, but there are others similar to this beer I'd reach for first.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,BeerBelcher,3.38,"I had this on-tap at Cafe Hollander in Milwaukee. I thought it was a fairly pleasant saison-style beer, particularly compared very old bottles of imported saison that are found in my area liquor stores. Recommended, but not outstanding.  It arrived as a fairly bright and hazy yellow, with fairly good head structure that left little lacing.  Aroma was of sweet yeastiness and some subtle spiciness.  Flavor was also of sweet and complex yeast flavors with some spiciness, but without a lot of fruitiness.  Mouthfeel was a bit harsher than I expected for the style, but was still decent.  All-in-all, a good saison choice.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Nipitato,3.79,"Picked up a bottle at Marty's Liqours in Allston.  A: A gorgeous beer. Golden. Not clear. Volumnous craggy white head. Visibly effervescent. Belgian lace.  S: Soft, airy, light citrus like aromatic prescence. Nice malty base. Phenolic peppery aroma barely present.  T: Dry. Slightly sour. Nice and peppery. More so than scent leads on. Citrus esters not as prominent.  MF: Light and airy. Very effervescent. Nearly astringent bordering on puckering. As mentioned by other reviewers this beer does not give away its higher alcohol content.  D: The lightness and dryness of this beer makes it quite drinkable. A great beer to break someone out of the macro beer pattern.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,jettjon,4.03,"Served from a 750ml bottle, no freshness date noted. Decants with a light pop; pours into the wine chalice, bright yellow-gold with numerous Champaign-like bubbles, pillowy, 2-finger white, craggy head. Slow fade leaving spotty lacing. Good looking pour. Nose of strong floral/citrus hops and vanilla notes. Taste of mild alcohol, a bit boozy, definitely fruity in the vein of scuppernong, reminiscent of a white ale. Mouth is bubbly and very smooth, nearly velvety. Very clean. Drinkability is excellent; very smooth, tasty, and goes down easily. Highly drinkable.  Overall: Very different from my previous experience with Rogue Festivale Saison; somewhat different from the also excellent Saison Dupont, I find this style enigmatic to say the least. Must try more! Very good overall, cheerfully recommended.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,fisherman34,3.8,"Bottled sample via trevorwideman. Gold in colour with lots of floaties (that's ok... yeast is good for you) and strong carbonation. Aromas of over ripe banana, vanilla, meadow flowers, white grape, and spicy pear. Flavors of lemon rind, soft fruit, spicy Duvel yeast, some wheat malt, and a slight metallic at the end. Smooth in the mouth with some nice lively carbonation creating some interest on the dry finish. Overall, this is a mellow and technically sound saison, but for me it lacks that certain something that makes a beer really special (like the signature funkiness of Fantome or the austere refinement of Dupont). Perhaps this sounds like damning with faint praise, but it's still a VERY good beer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,cabsandking,3.95,"A shade darker than golden and the beginning of a nice head but fizzles to a fine bubbled pool but some sticky lace remnants of its former height. Grassy, tart sour fruits, wheat, soft flowery esters all in the nose. Some unexpected light hops are noticed and are followed by fermented lemons pith and apple, grass, wheat, yeasty, husk. Later in the glass fruit characters gain in strength with some honey sweetness and notes of vanilla and banana. Mild carbonation and a light, airy mouthfeel. The finish echoes much of the flavor but is still relatively clean.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,HossMcGraw,3.76,"Hennepin is a pretty good interpretation of a Belgian farmhouse, but ultimately fails to live up to its potential. Too Americanized and goes out of its way to be inoffensive.  Looks great with straw yellow hue, big frothy white head, and adequate lacing. The aroma has the typical funky/bannana saison qualities with a bit of pepper. Very restrained. Same goes for the taste.  The flavor is nice and has potential, but is a bit bland. I'm really having trouble tasting much of anything. There's a bit of Belgian malty sweetness, with a crisp, dry, hoppy finish.  Feels pretty full in the mouth, with a good level of carbonation to keep things interesting. The drinkability is quite high, as this is pretty light in flavor and has terrific mouthfeel.  I had 3 Monts a week ago, and found it to be similar to this in many ways, but much better. Drink that instead.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,jbramley,4.13,"The beer pours a light straw yellow with a thick, fluffy, white head. The smell is of fruit and yeast. Upon drinking, I first noticed a complex medley of flavors, hard to pin any one flavor down. There were over-riding fruit flavors with a bit of an alcohol tingle on the front of the tongue. After swallowing, a mild apple juice flavor lingers for a short time. Has a sharp bite when it first hits the tongue but mellows out.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,SetarconeX,3.63,"After reading the rave reviews of other people here, I wonder if I might have gotten a bad sample.  Doesn't look like much, clear golden and bubbly. Smells really skunky, which first made me suspect the bottle might be off. Beneath the skunk however, is definitely some malt and fruit that keep it from being a total loss. Taste is a bit light, not unlike a very good pilsner, with a squeeze of lemon, and some added bitterness. Really not sure what to make of it.  The mouthfeel, however, is fantastic. This is an exceptionally smooth and creamy feeling beer, and it really improves the drinkability considerably. In the end, I'd call this a drinkable, if not great beer. Might be worth buying again just to make sure my bottle isn't off.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,indy169,4.5,"Hennepin pours hazy golden with light lacing that holds a malty fruitiness without being too sweet. Smell is bright, and substantial. Taste is mildly sweet, slightly fruity, with enough clear malt flavor to hold the fruit notes in check. I enjoy this beer very much. A very respectable Saison offering that hides it's 7.7 ABV quite well. Excellent.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,techdiver,4.68,"Pours a beautiful clear amber with a fantastic head that lingers and takes on a meringue-like look.

42,141,kimcgolf,4.16,"Much like Duvel or Saison Dupont, this poured to a very carbonated, hazy yellow with orange tint, and a thick white pillowy head that eventually reduced to excellent lacing. Aroma was a very hoppy floral, with hints of citrus and some spices. Taste was along the lines of the Duvel as well, but not as well-defined. Nice smooth finish. I really enjoyed this beer and Saison style.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,tcfishler,3.7,"Somewhat hazy orange-gold with a thick but coarse-textured, rapidly dissipating head.  Bready aroma, with faint hints of citrus and spices.  In the mouth, the carbonation also feels a little coarse. Malt is there but not just subtly sweet (sweetness appears later), nicely balanced with nonaggressive citrus/floral hops.  An interesting, very unrefined beer that is nonetheless nicely balanced. The texture of carbonation was a weak point in my eyes. A fun drink, though not a session-er for me.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,lpayette,3.78,"Details- 12oz bottle . Bottle conditioned. Nice blurb about where the name comes from and the proper pouring and storing techniques.  Appearance- Straw gold with bright white head. Some lacing, head is sizeable, but not as big as some saisons.  Smell- Cloves, pale malt, earthy, and slighttly alcoholic in the nose. To me it smells more like a belgian pale ale than a saison, but I suppose that those styles are fairly close in smell anyway.  Taste- Pears, apple, a certain grainyness, sweet pale malt. Fruity yes, but not as fruity as I'd like it to be. Also some earthy tones.  Mouthfeel- Nice carbonation. Light-bodied, long earthy aftertaste.  Drinkability- Fairly easy to drink, but I'm not a huge fan of the beer overall... I mean, it's good, but not as good as others that I've had IMO.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Thanks so much to demcorhip for bringing this for me from Wisconsin via Thunder Bay. 12oz bottle sample.  Pours an unfiltered pale yellow, almost white colour, with a voluminous fluffy head that dosen't quit. Lots of sediment and medium carbonation. Smell is yeasty and little funky, some earthy hop notes, coriander and cloves, some orange peel. Wheaty with some summery fruit in there as well.  Flavour is sublime, with a Granny Smith apple sourness hitting the tongue first, them moving on to all kinds of mellow bready/yeasty flavour. Pears, white grapes, all come before the funky finish that stays for a long time. Sticky and dry in the mouth but not overcarbonated, just a little bite. This goes down super-easily, but still invites you to hold it in your mouth for a long time. Very impressive Saison, and all the more impressive for being a North American beer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Estarrio,4.3,"This bottle was brewed in Belgium, as opposed to Cooperstown, NY.  Poured a clear, bright, golden yellow with a great deal of visible carbonation. The large, frothy white head retains very well, leaving sticky lacings on the glass.  The complex aroma includes sweet fruity phenols, a spicy alcohol bite along with hints of honey, apple, hay, clove and some earthy, wood tones. This is a great smelling brew.  The taste is tart grape up front with some mild sweetness. The aftertaste is pleasingly dry and bitter. There is a big earthy, yeast presence mid-sip, coupled with some green apple and phenol flavor. Overall, this is less sweet than the U.S. brewed version.  This body is rather light and aggressively carbonated, more so than the U.S. brewed version. A very pleasant and highly drinkable saison.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,calinative68,4.5,"second review of this fine example of a saison.... appearance - poured with 2 fingers left which produced a clear, golden color with an amazing head. Great white head. Smell - I made sure that I didn't make the bottle gulp, witch achieved that great floral smell that I love. Even my wife thought it has a great smell. Taste - Crisp, good balance. I think pears or ginger and citrus. Slight pepper and yeasty. Mouthfeel - this bottle had excellent carbonation, so it goes done easy. Which leads me into drinkability.

42,141,GooberMcNutly,3.47,"750 ml. Poured with a nice head, but not too big, as many Saisons are. Fell kind of quickly as well. Golden color with poor clarity and lots of suspended yeast. Not very floculent. Light aroma with hints of lemon and cherry with a persimmon note. Palate was uncomplicated with a light but distinct sour ale taste and quick finish. Plenty of carbonation left on palate for an active mouthfeel. I didnt get the alcohol notes until about 1/2 way through the glass, then my palate opened to it and I could taste it then. My favorite Ommegang product so far.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

42,141,MrHurmateeowish,4.12,"Smells sweet for the most part. Murky yellow body with initially large white head. I realize I am serving it initially cooler than suggested (the label suggests 50 degrees) but maybe itll warm up, its a warm summer night after all... anyway... hm not bad. Mostly sweet (banana?) with a little hops and pepper. Good solid beer. Im impressed",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,tempest,4.35,"At first glance, Hennepin looks innocent enough with its hazy, yellow color and fluffy white head. But it smells like no other beer you've had, featuring tangy orange and earthy hops. Upon tasting, there's an odd complexity of citrus and herbs. Peppered lemon flavor with a hint of vanilla gives way to a tart bite of green apples, grapes and finally a grapefruit-like bitterness. It's truly an adventure in beer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Terp96,4.5,"This is a hell of a beer. I wasn't into the farmhouse style that much until I had this one.  It pours a bright, orange/gold into my Duval tulip glass. Very effervescent with a huge head. Very inviting.  Smell is fruity with nice, spicey clove overtones.  Taste is amazing. Very light and refreshing. Distinct Belgian golden ale flavor. Slightly fruity with a spicey hop finish.  Mouthfeel is exceptional. Never thin, this one isn't too thick either. There is just enough body to let you know you are drinking a quality beer but it also is dry and refreshing at the same time. Very light on the palate but with lingering flavors as well. Very balanced.  Overall one of my favorites. So good, you could drink this one all night but at 7.7% abv you might regret it.

I don't know what to compare their smell to, perhaps a fresh bag of nature. Mmmm, nature.  Taste- Tart citrus. Very crisp, does not linger on the palate. Refreshing.  Mouthfeel- I'm a big fan of tiny little bubbles, which this has. Kinda sticky afterwards.  Drinkability- Man, I would be trashed if if someone offered me one of these after exercising. It really hits the spot and if I were parched I do believe I would drain one of these before you could say Ommegang.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,beersabound,4.18,"The yummy ale is very drinkable and a rather good example of a saison. However, whether compared to its brethen across the pond, I feel this one is a bit simple. It pours a lovely golden hue with fits of carbonation busting out to yield a great rocky eternal noodle. The aroma is of noble hops and lemon mostly. The flavor has a nice malt character that well supports the hop and citrus flavors. The body is medium/light and mouthfeel is round and pleasant. The alcohol is mildly perceived which aids in the drinkability. I didn't get much of the complex flavors and aromas that come with some of the Belgian saisons. This one is very enjoyable though.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Pours a murky, golden color with a huge, fluffy white head. The head decided to stick around a while on this one, which I didn't mind. Smell is very appealing. Yeast first, then some earthy hoppiness.  Taste is sweet with a slight sourness to it. Very refreshing. As it warms up it improves greatly. I was worried it might have been skunked. Didn't know how long it had been sitting at my local shop, but it was far from.  I wouldn't mind trying this one again.

42,141,demcorhip,3.95,"Appearance Bright golden straw coloured beer poured with a generous two finger creamy white head. Some yeast manged to make it in to give a particulate haze to this otherwise very clear brew. This medium carbonated brew was finely laced once the head settled.  Aroma Bready and a fruity, lemony aroma greeted my nose along with an earthy grassiness and hint of clove.  Taste Lightly toasted malts give nice cracker and bread backbone to this brew. A touch of lemon and an earthy grassiness and peppery hops nicely compliment the malts in this one. Theres also more fruit flavours that became even more apparent while drinking this one, hints of green apple, pear, and green grapes. The yeast also contributes here with a definate tang with a touch of funk as well as some clove flavour.  Mouthfeel This is a sparkly, tangy and crisp mostly balanced medium bodied brew. Was quite peppery, which is something im not quite used to, which along with the alcohol, warmed my belly.  Drinkability This is a tasty and refereshing beer with lots going on in it. Would make a decent session brew, and a good introduction to the realm of belgian styled ales. Challenges the palate, not due to the sheer size of its flavours, but moreso the depth, complexity and interplay between them. Ill be drinking this again.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Smells of spice and grass with a definite whiff of alcohol. The alcohol is very well balanced with a warming spicy flavor and some lemon hints.

The smell is of citrusy lemon, bready yeast and a slight medicinal aroma in the background.  The taste of lemon mixed with honey. Sourbread and grainy malt come into play a little later. The taste is not overly assertive, but always present enough.  The feel is smooth and refreshing. It's easy to drink, the flavors linger and the body holds up well.  A solid choice for a saison.

Not as much spice as I expected, but a touch of clove with the hops. Finishes a little sour and quite dry.  M: Crisp, light, and highly carbonated, but not negatively so.  D: A complex brew, but not filling  Substitute this for a white wine at dinner. A great American take on the style, and a great price for what you get.

Poured a moderate gold colour with a finger-width white head into our clear plastic sample glasses (wine glass style). Aroma is spicy and peppery, with fall fruits (apples?) and a little bit of that well-known funk.  Taste is definitely farmhouse, with hay, grass, damp wood or leather, among other notes. The tart fruit elements remain, and the carbonation is relatively high, although I think that suits the style. Mouthfeel is pleasant if you're looking for something crisp and refreshing.  I know this is an oft-recommended beer for food pairings, and a popular beer in general. And, I agree that it's not bad. But I don't see anything spectacular about it, and I wonder if the only reason why it's such a good pairing is that its flavours are restrained and inoffensive.

IMO, it looked like a Bud Light but the flavor and aroma had me wanting more and more. To begin, I first got a nice heavy blast of grainy malt w/ a hint of honey, coriander and clove. The brew had a pleasant light body, watery, and fizzy(small bubbles) enough to make it feel like champaign. I could also taste all it components such as the coriander, malt, hint of yeast and etc. This brew is really good and will buy several bottles next time, so that my wife and I could enjoy thoughout the night.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Good staying power, leaves sticky trails behind.  S: Grassy, spicy, flowery. An outdoorsman's beer?  T/M: Grassy and herbal up front, like lawn clippings, hay, and coriander (it's better than it sounds, trust me). There's a little bit of a ""rustic funk"" which adds some earthiness, spiciness and boldness. Far less funky than the Saison DuPont I had. The finish here is crisp, dry, and slightly bitter.  D: It occurs to me that someone could use the exact same description above, and present it as evidence to NOT drink the beer. Grass? Hay? Funk? Saisons are an odd bunch, and I'm not sure I've ever met someone who's indifferent to them; you either love them or hate them.  I think this is a marvelous beer. Ommegang is without question my favorite local (loose definition of ""local"" here) brewer. I wouldn't drink a six-pack of Hennepin, but it's a great, crisp, rustic, flavorful beer.

Hoppy, floral and truly makes you anticipate that first sip.  The taste is excellent. Light and easy to drink, with a nice sweetness in the finish, preceded by a nice fruity mouthfeel.

42,141,dblinkhorn,4.42,"Poured from 750 ml corked and caged bottle into my Gulden Draak tulip glass.  Appearance - Pours with a very large (about four fingers) head that is sparkling white and soapy (consisting mostly of larger bubbles). The head dissipates at a fairly regular pace and leaves some medium lacing on the side of the glass. There is high carbonation activity inside the beer, which is a pale straw color and ever so slightly hazy. It reminds me of a freshly poured glass of champagne (the bubbles, that is).  Smell - Apples, pear and a slight citrus presence on the nose. There is a large aroma of clove-like spice that accompanies the aforementioned. The hop character is ultra-crisp, and in fact the bouquet as a whole is very clean and crisp. The hop bitterness is on the low scale in the scent, followed lastly (and least powerful smell) is a fresh and bready malt character. Some faint alcohol aroma is there, but barely.  Taste - The champagne-like carbonation tingles your tongue nicely for the start. On its coattails follow the lighter-charactered fruit flavors (apples and pear again, mainly), with an extremely crisp attribute from the beer all around. The clove spiciness is excellent and is present through the entire taste, save the initial barrage of carbonation tingling. The bready malt character comes through more fully than in the aroma, and dominates the aftertaste, along with moderate flavors of pear. There is almost zero alcohol presence through the entire taste.  Mouthfeel - Most may find the carbonation a bit strong compared to most brews. While it is pretty strong, I personally didn't find that it took away from the overall value of the beer. The beer itself is light bodied and somewhat smooth, and in these two categories there is possibly room for improvement. Good mouthfeel altogether, however.  Drinkability - Excellent. There is nothing discomforting about this brew, from its flavors, complexity, mouthfeel, or small alcohol feel. I could sip a bottle or two of this with friends on a nice summer day.  Overall, this is one brew that I imagine would be a perfect summer daytime sipper. It's as crisp as anything out there, has a very refreshing taste and lively carbonation character that wakes your mouth up. An excellent saison that I will definitely be coming back to in the future.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

S: You can smell a nice sour aroma, some citrus, some light maltyness  T: At first it is the sour taste, that comes through, and then some grapefruit and other citrus. You can taste light notes of alcohol as well, with a nice gentle warming in the back of the mouth.  M: Good carbonation, helps move the flavors through the mouth and tongue.  D: Good, a very nice beer to enjoy on a warm day.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Smell: Earthy aroma, with some citrus and spicy hops.  Taste: So good, so balanced. Complex without being busy. I was expecting to find the ""farmhouse"" flavors to be a little more assertive, and that it would make this style more of an acquired taste, but I didn't find that to be true at all. It's not too sweet, like many Belgians tend to be. My new favorite Belgian-style ale, for sure.  Mouthfeel: Light body, not at all syrupy. Good carbonation. Finishes dry.  Drinkability: Paired with a meal of chicken, sauteed mushrooms, homemade creamed spinach, and gnocchi in a gorgonzola cream sauce, this was delightful.

Impressive under light--reminiscent of La Chouffe.  Aroma: Golden raisins, treacle, a little breadiness. Lemon, orange, and honey development and the faintest hints of spice and pine. Very rich nose, and very pleasant.  Taste: Ginger, lemongrass, honey and lemon zest--good bready foundations. Some grassy notes and a little cloves. Banana and apricot developments. Some pepper and a splash of pine in the finish. The flavors in here are certainly equal to LaChouffe, which this beer constantly reminds me of.  Mouthfeel: Light and crisp. Nice hops finish. Smooth with low carbonation.  Drinkability: Great--what a treat to have had this on the same night as the Fantome Strange Ghost. At the price, this might be one of the best belgians--in fact, just one of the best beers period--available. Fruity, refreshing, fantastic.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

I don't recall the exact age, but I recall emailing the folks at Ommegang and they told me that this beer would age well... Anyway, the sedond time, I had this i in a log and it was more current... I think I preferred the first, older, version... This is just an unusual style... Sweet, carbonated and notes of honey. I dinged it a little bit for mouthfeel - I think you can sense the carbonation and relatively high alcohol... Even so, I just like it...

Smell is of vanilla cream, Belgian yeast, pils malt, funky sour noted esters, light caramel, and mild hoppy citrus notes. Taste is of the mentioned aromas. This one actually reminds me a tad of Dupont although more depth to this one and more of a sugary taste. Mouthfeel is bitter-sweet, mildly sour in a refreshing medium body.

The beer's aroma consists of Hops, some spices and yeast. The taste follows the aroma fairly well. However, the hops are more apparent in the taste. The beer has a froathy body that leads to a lingering residual sweetness that I don't like about American breweries takes on Belgian Beers. Slight Alcohol present in the warmth.

The nose is much lighter than the bottle, with just hints of the grassy funk I expect. The taste follows suit, being more mellow, less grassy and bitter than the bottle. Suffers a bit due to the loss of complexity. The mouthfeel tells you that this is a lively beer, with huge carbonation pushing through the medium body. A good beer on tap, but much better bottle-conditioned.

42,141,GolgiIPAratus,4.3,"*** Caved Aged Edition ***  Sampled: 7.9.06  The only thing that distinguishes this bottle from an ordinary bottle of Hennepin as a Cave Aged edition is a card hanging from the corked & caged bottle neck by a gold elastic.  The beers pale gold is slightly cloudy and sits under a medium 1 inch head. The foam leaves plenty of lacing clining to the sides of the glass.  The aroma is immediately the tartness of fresh green apples hanigng out over the appropriate Belgian style funkification. Sweet and slightly spicy, but not overly so. Sweetness and tartness rule the nose in this town.  The flavor starts tart, carried from the aroma and is noticabley crisp. Soon sugary malts come through as the brew warms in the mouth. A slight edge of bitterness at the end of the taste hits as the beer goes down the throat. Though I cant be certain as I didnt do a side by side, it seems as though the year in the cave smoothed the brew out, gave it some balance. Its dry and light in the mouth, with a medium carbonated body. The dryness, possibly a result of the yeasts having more time to perform?  The beer is quite drinkable. Its crisp, tart and dry finish makes it a good one to have on hand like anyone else would have wine, but much less potent at 7.5% ABV. Highly recommended, though I cant say whether this Aged version is worth the extra $1. The Hennepin itself is delicious, no amount of agign would change that in any subpar brew.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Head is bright, bright white, like a well-bleached flour. Tight collection of tiny bubbles. Lacing is outstanding and thick all down the sides of the glass. Head retention also excellent.  S - light, sweet pilsner malt aroma followed by significant bursts of spice such as corriander, cloves, and fresh cracked peppercorns. Lots of spicy, citrus fruit aromas as well. Notes of higher alcohols. Little hop aroma.  T - spicy, fruity, flowery flavors overlying the sweet, slightly corny malt foundation. Light bitterness, but beer is mostly sweet and spicy. Warming alcohol. Nots of oranges, pineapple, citrus, cloves, pepper. Very, very tasty beer. Alcohol content is fairly well masked.  M - light bodied, carbonation is medium high to high, tingly.

42,141,rhoadsrage,4.3,(Served in a chalice)  A- A hazy lemon yellow body with a thin white head that last for the full glass. It is a bit to hazy to see any carbonation in this beer.  S- The dry faint tart notes come through with a faint lemon zest hint in the finish. There is a very light earthy hint to the tartness.  T- The dry tart flavors can't really be associated with anything and it is followed by a faint spicy note that is hard to describe also. The faint taste of black pepper and lemon/grapefruit start to come through. There is a faint soapy taste that in pleasant with a light bitterness from hops at the finish.  M-This beer has a medium light mouthfeel that is crisp.  D-This beer might sound awful the way I described it in my review but it was very taste with a very mysterious flavor that was hard to put into words.

Earthy yet bright. Hints of alcohol as it warmed. Pleasant. I was eager to try a sip.  Tasted light and citrusy. Perfect hop crispness to balance the tartness. Apples and honeydew.

The color of this farmhouse ale is a very clear golden yellow. Overall it looks appetizing.  One of the first things I noticed about this beer upon opening it was its complex aroma. There is a distinct yeasty aroma about this beer. There is also a spicy character easily picked up by the nose, Sazz perhaps? In the background I detect some slight fruit/sweet notes.  The nose of this beer is only the tip of the Iceberg. It would be nice if more of the complex flavor were represented in the aroma of this beer. This beer has got a nice overall flavor to it. Lots of things going on. There is definitely a fruity sweetness to it that can't be missed. Also notes of light caramel. Finishes with just the right amount of hops to offset the sweetness. Along with these bittering hops, the spicy character can be tasted as well(I'm going to assume that this is Sazz). Alcohol is slightly detectable (taste) as it goes down the throat.  On the palate this beer is very light. It goes down easy and warms just a bit as it goes down. carbonation does not get in the way of the delicate taste of this beer.The beer is clean tasting and crisp, it finishes fairly dry.

Pours a bright, glowing golden hue, but is slightly cloudy or hazed below the one finger foamy head. Smells Belgian (uh oh, I think), yeasty, sweetish, and only gently hoppy--not too much smelling going on here as it makes me nervous and the aroma of Belgian beers make me think of dusty cellars by association... Okay here I go...tastes fruity and complex--fruity in a white wine kind of way. Nectar like. Has waves and layers of flavor. Definite alcohol presence. Starts with the fruit-like malts, flashes alcohol, adds a flair of spice, and finishes with a juicy, fruit-zest hops lingering on the tongue for a moment or two. I'm not in love with the taste, but it's intriguing. Mouthfeel is full but on the tongue sits slightly watery--more so than expected, I expected more syrup, but it is pleasing. Not sure how I feel about the carbonation level..a bit high. Drinkability wise, this is nothing I'll swoon over and plan my day around, but it's a good beer that seems it could go well with the summer bread, cheese, fruit, and spiced meats kind of picnic.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Not as fruity as the aroma, but the banana, orange, and lemon undertones are still there. Plenty of spice as well. Excellent balance, but mostly very subtle. Somewhat of a yeasty aftertaste.

Much like the nose, it tastes of bananas, yeast, honey dew melon, some spiciness that would be expected from this genre of beers, just party in my mouth. Mouthfeel is decent, creamy yet maybe a little too carbonated. For a 7.7% brew, this is EXTREMELY drinkable - even TOO drinkable.

Aroma is both belgium yeasts, which I love, and fresh tropical fruits....oranges, mangos, pineapple. Taste is sharply tart of citrus with bananas and a substantial drying. I am sure there is more complexity than I am describing, but I am drinking this with a dinner of smoked ribs and cole slaw and I can see how people say it goes with everything.

Taste and mouthfeel: Spicy hop bitterness mixed in with sweet, fruity flavors; I got Granny Smith apple and green grape. A late burst of alcohol provides for a warming finish. There was an earthy quality to the whole thing. Mouthfeel was slick, especially as the beer warmed, yet remained refreshing.  Drinkability: If the alcohol burst doesn't bother you - and it didn't bother me - it's quite drinkable. Great sipper.  Notes: My first saison, and I think I'm gonna really like this style.

The aroma is anything but fizzy and yellow. Bready, yeasty, and spicy aromas shine through, with a hint of alcohol.  Flavor is dry and spicy. Huge amounts of yeast flavor, very spicy phenols, and a hint of wheat flavor. Mouthfeel is chewy and full, and drinkability is high.  Once again, another fine brew from Ommegang.

42,141,Abita45,4.25,"Light bodied for it's style, with a pleasant wheat/yeast fragrance and a minimum head. It laced nicely on the glass, but the real substance to the beer was its nice combination of wheat, hops, and malt which made for a crisp taste while also giving it a smooth, almost creamy mouthfeel.  I only had a loose bottle of this beer, but feel compelled to pick up a few others. I thought it was outstanding.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,InsolublePancake,4.18,"Part deux of my unexpected Kroger Ommegang score. Unlike the Rare Vos, this bottle opened with a loud pop and some spillage into the sink. Not too much though, thank goodness.  A- Nice pale golden color with a big white head. Active carbonation with a couple columns of bubbles rising to the top like a good champagne.  S- Malt and yeast flavors abound with spicy clove-like phenols and an orangey fruitiness.  T- Lemony tartness with cloves and some mustiness. Finishes dry with an earthy hop bitterness.  M- Fairly light and nicely carbonated. Easy to drink.  D- Quite drinkable due to its light body and pleasant mouthfeel. I'll have no problems polishing off this bottle.  Very nice ale, probably my favorite out of the three I've had from Ommegang. I'm not very familiar with the Saison style but this beer has got me interested. I'd definitely like to try a couple authentic Belgian examples and see how they stack up. I drank this beer alone, but I bet it would pair excellently with many types of food.

42,141,kmo1030,4.02,"cave aged '05... i picked this up during a visit to the brewery last weekend.  hazed golden color with a white head. the aroma is a peppery pineapple with some tangy lemony orange citrus, with undertones of hay. it has some wit beer aromas too, a little clove and banana (seems to get more ripe as the temp rises). when the head is thick there is a lot of bubble gum. the taste is softly citrusy with a baryard hay-like quality. it's got some pineapple and ginger as well, along with a nice amount of pepper. it's got some wheat like qualities in there too, a little bit of a sweet grainyness. it becomes a little sugary as it reaches room temp. towards the bottom of ther bottle the yeast gets mixed with the beer a bit and adds a nice bready aspect. in reality this deserves somewhere between a 4.0 and a 4.5 for taste, i'm gonna have to round down here though. it's got a full medium body with moderate carbonation. finishes sort of dry, but sweet a solid saison, that age has definitely mellowed a bit. more than worth a try. it's actually better at a little bit of a lower temperature.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Smell is fruity and quite sweet, has a small citris aroma as well. Interesting.  Taste. Again, somewhat similar to a hef, cloves really come out after a few seconds that becomes slightly peppery on the touch. This beer also gives me a cooling effect in my mouth after a few seconds and swallow, like menthol. Very nice spice tastes and has a yeasty taste to it as well. Aftertaste kinda gives me a corriander flavor, little creamy.  Mouthfeel. Lots of carbonation. light body, good balance. Gives my mouth a small puckering and drying sensation.  Overall, a very nice beer. Light and refreshing, yet tasty and complex. Good beer, but i'm not sure i totally agree such a high rating. But still quite good.

42,141,EPICAC,4.68,"I purchased this at Downtown Wine & Spirits and had it last night. I let it warm and served it in one of my New Belgium snifter style glasses.  Appearance: Pours a lightly hazy golden with hints of amber. The clarity is good and reveals vigorous carbonation feeding a thick frothy white head. Retention is good, though the head eventually fades to a thin layer leaving patchy lace.  Smell: The aroma reminds me of a hefe-weizen. There are notes of yeast, banana and cloves. Additionally there are aromas of grain and citrus.  Taste: Tart lemony citrus and fruity flavors upfront fade into a peppery grainy and grassy finish with a nice balancing bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, mild carbonation (considering the bubbles), light oiliness with a dry finish.  Drinkability: Well balanced refreshing and incredibly easy to drink.

The feel is smooth with a nice, medium body. Overall, I liked this beer but I just felt it was too strong and boldly spicy/fruity to be a beer that would be really drinkable.

I love Hennepin, so I was glad to get my hands on this.  a: beautifully clear golden brew. A very fine head that laces like a sheet of white...errum...lace? s: sweet fruits with some alcohol. t: Sweet fruitiness that finishes dry and light pepery phenols and powery yeasts. Alcohol is present. The aftertastes is a bit syrupy which conflicts with the dry finish. m: smooth; so smooth and mellow. Yummy! d: I can sip this forever. This is truely an amazing brew.

42,141,GregoryVII,3.73,"This beer poured a thick and abundant head and the color was a dark orange/gold, with a slight haze. The mouthfell was medium light, with bouncing carbonation. The aroma was citrusy, fruity with orange and a dash of spice that leans more towards ginger than pepper. The flavor was refreshing up front, sweet with notes of honey and grains. There is really little of any funk that you might expect from a ""farmhouse"" style. Little spice, aside from what adds sweetness. I do get a little bite from the hops, but not enough to round this out to as rich a beer as it could be. The drinkability is high. I know you shouldn't rate a beer based on what's not there, but I wanted more from this beer than what it gave.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

I love the Ommegang Abbey Ale, but this is close to becoming my favorite Ommegang offering.

Hennepin pours a bright golden color with a thick white head that lasts and lasts.  Smells are of sweet vanilla, spicey , earthy, bready barnyard -types. Maybe a potpouri of belgian farmhouse aromas.  Tastes are sweet, buttery, caramel, bready malt mixed with slight banana/clove/alcohol character.  Mouthfeel is medium frothy, syrupy but crisp.

42,141,audiojon,4.01,"Saisons are an odd beast, sometimes I think I have the style nailed and then something comes along and turns my brain around. When I think saison, I think grassy, slightly bitter, and dry. Hennepin is a bit dry, but is not very bitter and is definitely not grassy. It is still a delicious beer, with some nice fruit undertones and the perfect amount of carbonation. Smell is a bit one dimensional, and the phenol levels are a bit high, but these are merely small imperfections in an otherwise very drinkable beer. I must say this is not my preferred saison, but it does represent a bargain at six dollars a bottle. (This bottle only cost me three, the local bevmo was clearing them out!)

Sweet malt, corriander, spicy and fruity, very complex and absolutely smells Belgian.  Very sweet initially, bubblegum, corriander, Belgian candi-sugar, this is really tasty, super fresh and a great representation of this style. I'm thinkin it's the most enjoyable Saison I may have ever tasted.  Medium plus in body with great head retention and the complexity of a fine Belgian, I'm craving one right now.

42,141,dragonbrew,4.54,"Haven't seen Ommegang beers in very many places around my area until just the past few months. Interestingly enough I stopped in a random Dandy Mini mart (typical gas/convenience store) and as I was waiting to pay for my gas at the front I looked to the back of the store. To what to my surprise did I see, but yes, an Ommegang display rack. This surprised me because this place has always been your typical place to find deals on such things as Natty light and Busch. I don't know if it is selling in this locale, but hey, God bless them for trying.  Point is their beer is starting to pop-up everywhere in the Southern Tier not just in the better beer stores, and that can't be a bad thing.  Anyway, about the beer. Although it wasn't my first time with a Hennepin saison and certainly not the last, it is the first time I've reviewed it. I purchased a bomber at the store around the corner from my home and chilled it for a couple of hours before consuming.  At first pour the frothy pure white head was abundant and survived throughout the drinking of the beer covering the hazy straw color of the liquid below. As for smell, I don't have the greatest of ability in this area, but to be sure there was nothing in the slightest bit ""off ""about this beer, and it was at least pleasant in that respect.  The taste had a very light sweetness to it and a definite clove, corriander, citrus undertone. Although it has a 7.5 abv it seemed much lighter in mouthfeel, something a ""gulpper"" (like I can sometimes be) should be wary of on a hot summer afternoon.  I definitely see myself buying this beer more often now that it is readily available. It is a great summer beer that is light and refreshing. AND at $4.99 retail, not a bad price for a very high quality product.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,BassBone,4.42,"This is an exceptional beer from the get go. From the 750mL corked bottle, to the pop of the cork itself it screams class. It pours a hazy golden-yellow with a thick, rich white head with some pretty impressive lacing. The head sticks around for a bit, too. The nose is hoppy, citrusy and spicy. Some fruitiness there, too. The first sip is like a slap across the face with flavor. Beautiful hops and malt with undertones of citrus and severe spice. It finishes smooth with a lingering bitterness and a dash of spice. Truly a great beer.

42,141,jhollick,4.63,"25th Birthday Beer!!! This review is from a fresh 750mL bottle. I poured aggressively enough (into an inviting cognac glass) to produce an inch thick head, which lingered for a bit and then dissipated aside to a small ring around the edge of the glass. Color is a beautiful hazy golden-orange with fine bubbles constantly breaching the surface of the beer. This really gives it a lively quality, which is further enhanced by the earthy overtones in the smell and taste.  Initial smell is of candied malts, apple, banana, orange, and straw. Mouthfeel is what I would expect...the bottle conditioning gives a delightful tingling in the mouth, and the slickness and moderate body lets the beer waft across the tastebuds very easily.  Shit...I haven't even gotten to taste yet? :) Taste is very balanced. Honey and light fruits hit the buds initially, followed by a grassy taste/smell, which is accompanied by a variety of phenols to give some warmth to the taste. Finish is the slightest hop bitterness. It is just enough to balance the upfront dry malts, sugars, and fruit flavors. It really is a melding of many different flavors. Simply ravishing. I absolutely can't believe this is brewed just a couple hundred miles from my house. I have never tasted an American beer like this.  Oh...my. This beer is devilishly drinkable. I can hardly detect the alcohol, as it is well hidden amongst the spices. A 750mL is enough to send me to a happy place, as if the beer weren't enough. I'm not very familiar with Saisons, but all I can say for certain is that this beer is decidedly Belgian, and at $6/750mL, I will buy it again and as often as I can get hold of it. If you love beer, try this beer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

A: The beer pours to a very pale yellow color with a large foamy white head that fades at a decent rate and leaves a small amount of lacing on the glass.  S: Bready, yeasty smell with background notes of malt, banana & hops.  T: The taste starts of malty with a flavor of banana, follows with a little bit of hops, then alcohol warmth. Not as bready as you smell and no after-taste. As the beer warms you get a little bit more hops but still not overpowering.  M: Very crisp, light-to-medium body, medium-to-high carbonation and a clean finish.  D: It goes down easy but I just didnt like the taste enough to drink a lot of it.  I tried this beer at a tasting and thought it was pretty good. Now that Im drinking a a whole 750ml bottle, Im not liking it as much. Just being honest.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Budlum,4.35,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle in to a goblet. Pour carefully as this one produces plenty of head, approximately 1.5"". Colors are pale yellow, orange and amber. Nice lacing from the long-lasting head.  Aromas are yeasty and dominated by spice. Coriander, nutmeg, citrus and hops. It would be a great air freshener for my car.  Highly effervescent mouthfeel that is immediately refreshing. Definitely lots of spice in the moutfhfeel. Flavors of exactly what I smelled. Lots of citrus and coriander spice. The yeast lacks but there are some hints of vanilla. I would expect just a little more vanilla and banana clove flavors from the yeast in a saison. The brew is best served cold and picks up a few pungent flavors if left to warm too much. However, too cold and you miss the beauty. At least go for the four pack and experiment.  Overall, a great example of a saison lacking some of the features of the best saisons available. You won't be disappointed.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,ej285701,4.33,"750 ml bottle, corked and caged.  Pours a lovely hazy, orangish-gold color with a two inch off-white head that sticks around for while.  The smell is very good. Sweet malts with a lot of fruits, oranges, lemons, apples. Along with some yeast that works very well here.  Taste is very similar to the smell but stronger than the aroma lets on. More yeastiness is noticed here, but it is held in check by the fruitiness and the sweet malts. Some bananas and cloves are noticed. Also a slight marshmallow taste, which just adds to the complexity of this beer. My only complaint is the yeasty finsh. However this only lasts for about two or three seconds, so its not a big deal.  Very well carbonated, and light and airy on the tongue. A little too carbonated at first, but after some of that dies down, the mouthfeel is perfect.  After a whole 750 ml bottle of this stuff I don't get tired of the flavor. Extremely drinkable and very refreshing. At only $4.99, this is an amazing beer for the price.

Taste; the bananas and cloves are present up front, with a bit of sweet pineapples mixed in. There's a definite belgian yeasty funkiness, with some outdoor/barnyard earthiness going on.

I swear this beer is stronger than it was when it was first introduced.

Nicely sharp carbonation in a crisp mouthfeel, the horses again in the flavor, apples and grapes, banana-y yeast, a dash of coriander, and a cute hop bittering to freshen it up.

Easy-going, white, frothy head, the texture of steamed milk  Smell: If I were to describe the way this smells (and I am), I would say it's like a blend of a fine Czech pilsener and an even finer brut champagne. Splendid! I also detect green bananas, sage, white grapes, phenols, and carnation-like floral notes. Very fruity, very complex.  Taste: The aroma's nuances do not mislead. White wine dominates, banana flavors and tart, musty yeast are also strong, and fresh pineapple appears. Spicy alcohol and a quinine-like flavor lend the impression of a gin and tonic.  Mouthfeel: Pleasantly carbonated and light, yet creamy and chewy.  Drinkability: Hooray! This is a really drinkable, really interesting ale.

There is a slight apple sweetness to both the smell and the taste that is wonderful. The is still a slight spicy bite upfront, but it mellows into a wonderfully smooth finish.

The color is a slightly hazy gold and first sniff is banana, clove, and malty sweetness. The taste -wow; very complex with phenolic and esterey qualities with a solid earthy Belgian funk. Hop flavors are in the background, but the bitterness is certainly noticeable. The feel is fizzy, but smooth, with a fruity finish and back-end kick of alcohol.  Really challenging, and I had to take a few sips to reassure myself that this is indeed a beer. Halfway through and I'm really impressed. This is no easy beer.

Finally when I'm able to pour the rest in the body turns a hazy yellow, as I poured the yeast in, which might be why. Lacing and head isn't as impressive as I drink, but still hangs around. And a swirl or two recharges it right back.  Smell: A lot of phenolic activity without being over the top. Mostly a bit of grass, slight barn and bandaid. Some lemongrass and citrus also comes through, along with a bit of sourness with some hops maybe. A bit of dark cherry also comes through. Very balanced and complex with much going on.  Taste: Lots of fruit and citrus with phenols for a crazy and fairly balanced combination, along with some slight vanilla and caramel also. Finishes dry but not overly dry, with a bit of hops and a lot of lemon and citrus on the tongue. There may be some ginger in there too, along with a nice earthiness and yeastiness. Also some band aid funkiness which somehow compliments the finish.  Mouthfeel: Very creamy and rich, and without the carbonation levels I thought would be present, it still remains full without being cloying.  Drinkability: I am indeed impressed by this. A good amount of masked alcohol, lots of balance and flavor, and around $8 for a 4 pack, or at least that's what I paid. Ommegang's becoming one of my favorite breweries. Along with Allagash, they know what they're doing with the Belgians. Saisons are a singular and special brew to me, and this is definitely done very well and is highly recommended.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Byeast,4.5,"Sampled from a 750 ml , caged and corked  This farmhouse saison poured a hazed but not opaque , golden straw color with a large , creamy white head that stayed around as a quarter inch of foam , more dense and chunky in some areas then others. Nice spots of lacing left on the glass and the beer cleared up quite a bit as it warmed. The smell is very inviting. Malt , clove ,spice , fruit , grain , yeast , and a tinge of honey are all in the nose. Flavor is pleasant and complex. Some tartness in the form of grain and citric/lemon tastes , clove, bit of medicinal phenolic qualites , bready malt , tad bit of honey , slight peppery spice, a bit of banana and herbal notes , and a yeasty dryness in the end. Mouthfeel is on the slick side. This is one tasty brew. So sooo drinkable and flavourful! I will be buying many more of these in the future.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Bitterbill,4.62,"Poured from 750ml bottle with cage and cork(room temp) after an initial big pop and a bit of overflow. It's a clear light gold(until further into the bottle when it becomes hazy from the sediment) in colour with lots and lots of foam and a dust devil of bubbles, dead center in my Chimay glass. Interesting look. Btw, my bottle says 7.7%abv but no bid deal...:^)  The smell is inviting...all malty, yeasty and an abundant nose of clove and fruit.  The taste is so nicely complex. Flavours of yeast and malt abound heading towards the sweet but then an ample hop bitterness moves in, with some sour citrus notes, causing me to utter an inaudible ""hell yeah""! :^) Tasty stuff to say the least and so darn drinkable!  Oh and...I've had a few Saisons and this one, imho, is dead on for style...way to go Ommengang!  Bottom line: Here's an *excellent* example of the Saison style that should please the most discerning Belgian Ale drinker. Recommended!!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

The beer is an expected hazy orange-gold.  Aroma is full of fresh sweet malt, husk, and apple with herbal and floral hops seamlessly blended in. Perfume like.  The flavor is immediately sweet, but not overpoweringly so, quickly followed by big banana and plenty of carbonation bite. Finish is quick and dry. Not much depth to the flavor.  Mouthfeel is light to medium, somewhat slick but with plenty of fizz to keep it from sticking. Very easy to drink and refreshing. Easy to put back a little too fast, but it's a quencher of a style and it does the job well.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Clove spice, and some fruity esters. Apple peel. Dry malt, very robust.  Taste: Dry grain, with a coarse texture. The middle of the beer is a little sweeter, tasting of banana, lemon, and apple. Warm and spicy as well, with coriander being the clearest element. Honey-like, sticky sweetness lingers beneath the sturdy earthiness of the beer. Tannins spike sharply in the finish, giving the beer a grassy aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied, with a decidedly frothy composition.  Verdict: Sturdy and flavorful. Recommended.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,kbnooshay,4.77,"a- This poured a very pale yellow gold with a lot of haze and a decent amount of carbonation. The white head was really fizzy and fluffy. Not the most attractive beer style in my opinion but that is allright, the other categories with rock your socks off.  s- Mmmmm. This smell is citrusy and yeasty with a hint of cinamon or perhaps other similar spices. I buried my nose in this like Jim Koch in the Sam Adams commercial. Very sweet and earthy with a decent amount of hoppage.  t- oh man. This tastes like duvel just not as harsh and bitey. I love it! The flavors such as pear and apple please the mouth and the alcohol isn't harsh at all. It is barely there even at 7.7%! The flavor is aweome and spicey w/some yeasty goodness. Makes me think of sour apple candy.  mf/d- Tingly and very drying. The feel is smooth but prickly from the carbonation. I am draining this 750ml bottle, it is so drinkable! Heheh the bottle is all mine.  Now before trying this I preffered the darker beligians a lot more and I still do, but not by as much. This was surprisingly perfect. I can't wait to try others of the style.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,mobyfann,4.41,"Paid $3.99 for the 25.4oz bottle...  This ale pours a cloudy yellow color with a huge white head, exceptional head retention and nice lacing effects on the glassware. The aroma is yeast and fruit driven with a touch of alochol, nice mellow and strong notes of both.  The taste is very full-body. The yeast flavor takes over and it leaves a fruity aftertaste, a bit lemony. The mouthfeel is smooth on the palette and this is highly drinkable, at 7.7%abv, it is hard to not consider this a session beer.  Final Thought: This is an excellent example of a craft beer with great creativity; it is not only a staple in its class but also an excellent buy.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,CAMRAhardliner,4.6,"This is the cave aged version, the bottle looks really cool with the mouldy patina on the labels.  The pour reveals a hazed gold liquid with a huge white rocky cap. Stupendous amounts of lacing coat the glass. The aroma is malty and spicey with some earthy mustiness. The taste is an explosion of different flavors that meld together flawlessly. Pear, vanilla, coriander, peppercorn, all spice, cloves, anise all figure prominently. The finish is briskly hoppy, but more spicey. The mouthfeel is wonderfully textured with creamy carbonation.  It sucks that beers like this arent available in Canada. This is emminently drinkable and extremely complex. Thanks to Nick at Bauer Wines for the recommendation.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,geexploitation,4.11,"Pours a tarnished golden color with a big, rocky white head. Looks very appetizing. The nose is a pretty subtle and not nearly as forward as some other saisons... there's some spice in there, along with a bit of barnyard funk and some yeast. Flavor is quite fruity right off the bat, with a round sweetness that's overcome by those barnyard/horse blanket notes, helped by some hops. Highly carbonated mouthfeel that doesn't get in the way of the smoothness of this beer. Overall, a wonderful, versatile beer. Interesting, easy to like and complex at the same time.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,sloejams,4.22,"""A hoppy brew, the Ommegang Hennepin is beautifully golden in color and stays on the palate with a briskness that makes it perfect for aperitifs."" according to BevMo.com. This statement is pretty much bullshit.  Not even remotely hoppy (at least in the way that the descriptor has come to mean something with high IBUs), instead this is a fine American version of the lovely Belgian farmhouse style. It should come as no surprise that Brewery Ommegang of Cooperstown, New York, was purchased by the Belgian Duvel Moortgat in 2003.  It has a nice citrus aroma - very crisp, very refreshing. The yellow straw murky color is very inviting. The taste is light but full on flavor. Hints of spice and fruits come through deliciously.  This is a fine beer and comparable to similar ones more fabled from Belgian. For the price, its quite a bargain considering its Belgian kin will likely cost you twice as much.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,DaggerEyes,4.47,"750 ml brown bottle with a cork and a cage poured into an oversized wine glass  Poured a fuzzy golden yellow. The haze was so dense in this brew that is was hard to see my hand through the other side of the glass. Not much of a head foamed up but a delicate filagree of lace formed on the surface. The beer is sticky and clings to the walls of the glass while drinking.  The nose is sweet and slightly spicy with earthy hints, as well as some subtle fruit scents.  This beer is very very active in the mouth and features a high level of carbonation. It is slightly spicy on the tip of the tounge and has a dry sweetness through the finish, featuring apple like flavors mixed with an earthy grainy quality. There is no doubt that this saison is true to the ""farmer"" roots of this style. I detect a very subtle melon like aftertaste, which is very pleasant.  A very drinkable beer, an absolute pleasure to enjoy on it's own or with a nice meal.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,sinstaineddemon,4.52,"this beer pours a hazy golden yellow with lots of obvious carbonation and a head with tremendous staying power.  there is a distinct aroma of spice, smells like ginger to me, more specifically ginger snap cookies, with the associated barley aromas.  wow, this is damn good, it has a dry sweetness tht is hard to place, the ginger snap aroma persuades my taste buds that that is the taste as well.  it has a smooth feel to it that turns drier near the end.  it definitely leaves me craving more.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

42,141,doppelmeup,4.11,"Poured a bottle into a Duvel tulip glass.  Initially had a bit of a skunky smell, but that went a way quickly and then I was able to smell the Belgian yeast aroma that I was expecting. Thick, half inch tall head that stayed for quite a while.  Beautiful gold color with hints of orange. Very nice looking beer.  Taste was very good. Initial Belgian flavors, tempered by a nice bit of bitterness that balanced it very well. Slightly spicy. It was not overly sweet, which is a trait I find I don't like in some of the Belgian styles.  Modest amount of carbonation. Clean and crisp dry finish.  Very drinkable brew! Had I not known differently, there is no way I'd have guessed that this wasn't brewed in Belgium. Well done, Ommegang!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Metalmonk,4.1,"Always willing to dive into an Ommegang!  This poured one of the whitest and lightest heads I've ever seen. Head retains relatively well, though it's a thin one from pour to final swallow. Color is pure gold with moderate bubbles and moderate lace.  Aroma is extremely fresh: grassy, mildly hoppy, flowery.  Mellow hops and a cool breeze of primo grains hit first, with mild floral spices following. Bready malts hit last. Light and unobtrusive in the mouth, this feels really good if you're not looking for a heavy, chewy ale. Dry finish.  This is a no-nonsense Saison without any wild or unusual characterstics. As such, it's a fine represenation of the style, it's delicious going down, and I'm glad I've got more left in the bottle.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Farm like flavours, similar to some saison or gueuze, some notes of natural flavours. Fruity esters, followed by hops and a shy malt.  taste wise she is fruity, hoppy with a bitter sour ensemble, acid, very carbonated, the sourness comes and reminds me of cherry sourness .  She actually reminds me of a ""Saison Dupont"" who mated with ""La fin du monde"" as wannabe.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,t8000shx,3,"Was pumped to give this one a go, I generally like Ommegang. Poured nice, tons of bubbles, tall head. Caught me off guard, required a more delicate pour than even most other belgians to moderate head size. Nice hazy gold/yellow color in the glass, appealing looking. Smelled like the real deal, very authentick belgian.  It was only once the beer left the glass and found its way onto my tongue that disappointment set in. Admittedly, for my first sip the beer was way too cold, so i let it sit for some time. Unfortunately i don't like how it opened up. Tart, bubbly, mildly sweet, citrusy, and earthy. It all sounds nice, except the tartness was too strong. Resulted in an extremely unbalanced flavor. Not to say the beer was terrible, it wasn't, however it could use significantly more strength from the earthy/malty notes. Tartness and acidity need to be toned down a bit. Noting the beer's high rating, it looks like i'm in the minority here, but so it goes. I'll stick with the 3 Philosophers next time I hit up Ommegang",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

A few mins later and the head is still around, looks fluffy.  S - Bready, yeasty, spicy and earthy. Smells like a belgian. I can faintly smell the hops and I don't detect the alcohol really. Reminds of me of a wit.  T - Tart and a little sweet, earthy, spicy. I'm not accustomed to this type of beer so the best description I can give is complex. Again, reminds me of a wit. There's a little bitterness throughout but it's just right. It's not bitter really - just well balanced. Wow, this thing is 7.5% ABV... I'd never even suspect it so high. Even though I'm not the biggest fan of belgians, this one is definitely tasty.  M - Smooth and very nicely carbonated. Light and refreshing.  D - I'd still choose an American ale over the belgians right now but they are really starting to grow on me. I've had several in the past and this one is definitely the best by far. I would definitely buy this again.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Aroma is mostly citrus with some slight spice (coriander?). it has a lot of sourness to the nose along with a bit of alcohol...a bit much for 7.5%.  Sipping is a bit of sour & bitter lemon flavor, but a lot of alcohol and carbonation kills a lot of the flavor i hoped to get from this. Some peppery flavor sneaks through along with some yeast. Maybe a bit of grass hops at the end along with some alcohol.  Lots of carbonation stings my tongue but the body is rather light. Decent alcohol bite. Could be better.

Robust white head with considerable retention and strong lacing of the glass. A gorgeous beer.  S - Hmmm ... NY not Belgium, huh? Are we sure? Smells like a true Belgian delight. Yeasty with a slight sweetness and the hint of spices. Fruity nose of melon and grapes.  T - Wow ... this is very white wine-like. I taste white grapes up front with a yeasty floral character. Slightly tangy and tart ... the fruity sweetness is offset by the dry persistence of hop accents. The alcohol is noticeable, but only in a wine-like manner. Superb. When I first tasted this, I thought ""this taste I know"" but couldn't identify ... I later realized this ale is so very much like a good, dry white wine.  M - I'd say this is definitely a medium-bodied ale, with quite a lot of carbonation. It's very ""alive."" As it warms, it pours in the mouth and covers like a pleasing effervescent blanket. This one ""plays"" in the mouth.  D - I'm half way through the 750ml bottle now and I'll assuredly finish it. What a pleasant, fun beer. I've had Ommegang Three Philosophers, and the Rare Vos, and liked them both for their own merits ... but this one, so far, is my favorite from Ommegang hand's down. Imminently drinkable and user-friendly, this ale ranks at the very top of the category ... Belgian or not. I had to remind myself that this wasn't an authentic Belgian ale, at least in the sense that it was brewed there. It IS authentic ... just from NY. Highly recommended and may well have a place in my top 10. An accomplishment. My hat (if I had one) off to Brewery Ommegang for this outstanding beer.

There was a 1/4"" head at first pour, that slowly fell to a 1/8"" head that stuck around forever. There was some serious lacing left on the glass after dinking  Aroma: Very dry and grainy aroma with some bready yeast character. As you get deeper into the aroma, you can pick up some spice that seems like it is alcohol driven as anything.  Taste: The taste is a bit dry and attenuated also. I believe that this beer has seen better days. There is a noticeable spiciness that must be from the yeast as well. The underlying character of this beer definitely has potential. As the beer warms a bit, the flavor gets a lot softer edge to it. It is getting rather creamy and some sweetness is coming out.  Opinion: Well, after all was said and done, I ended up liking this beer even though I am convinced that it has some age on it. The flavor was complex and there were only minor flaws caused by the age. I would definitely try this beer again when it is a fresher example",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Some random fingers of lace stuck throughout the tasting. The nose had a funky wheat sort of spice quality. P'raps a bit clovey and peppery as well. Yeasty. The beer was also mildly alcoholic and was somehow reminding me of lagerish scents. The taste was somewhat ""farmhouse"" sour. Notes of banana and wheatish flavours as well as clove and strange esters were notable. The mouthfeel had a sort of creaminess and a solid pils style body. Easily medium.

Taste - Wow, starts off sweet, with a nice bready flavor which subsides into a lemon/orange citrus taste. As it warms up the bready flavor is up front and the citrus comes out more, warming up a little only makes this better.  Mouthfeel - Smooth, bubbly, slightly earthy.

Excellent rendition of an (sadly) obscure style.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,TheEclecticGent,3.94,I shared a pitcher of this beer with my girlfriend and a friend of hers. This beer looks fantastic in the Hennepin goblets they gave us. The beer has a hazy golden coloration. The head is very thick and an off white color. The lacing was very good and followed the beer all the way down the glass until completion it has a peppery-nutmeg spicy fermented fruit smell with nice musty spicy yeasty notes. The taste is floral-citrus sweetness with lovely spicy notes in the flavor. This beer is very balanced. This beer has a medium-light mouthfeel. There is good carbonation in this beer. This is just an easy to drink beer.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,bahumutx,4.4,Served from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip glass.  Appearance: Pours a cloudy golden yellow with a big head that is dissipating slowly.  Smell: Very yeasty and bready. Also a strong citrus/fruit aroma and a slight grassy aroma. As the beer warms I am picking out a pepper/clove taste. Very balanced.  Taste: Starts off with a sour and citrus taste that moves onto a yeasty and bread taste.  Mouthfeel: Smooth Mouthfeel. Ends slightly dry.  Drinkability: Very drinkable. I could easily have a few of these in a sitting.  This is my first beer of this style and I must say that it is delicious. I think it will be even better when the warm weather gets here.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Hautacam,4.21,"Is it OK to drink this in January ? You bet it is! A really good Saison...reminds me of summer ...and a nice little change from the wonderful heavy seasonals that I've been drinking lately. Pours hazy gold with an huge head....lacing nicely. Smells yeasty and malty. Nicely balanced malt with a perfect amount of floral hop bitterness, and the alcohol is right there. More complex than I thought it would be....this is an ale to savor. Mouthfeel is just right...medium, with a slightly dry finish.Medium to high carbonation. I could easily go through a few of these with or without food...it went really well with a white pizza. Another great one from Ommegang.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,PorterLambic,4.15,"Pours a cloudy, straw-honey color with a huge explosive head. Took a while to get all the beer in the glass what with all that foam just sitting around and such. Smell is spice, malt, yeast, hops, fruit (green apple) with a floral note. Taste is exactly as the nose predicted, unusual as that is. With a medium body that leaned to the fuller side, I was surprised at this brew's lightness on the palate. The clean finish was nice as well. This is a really good beer. Kind of like a wheat but with more body.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,edchef1850,4.25,"Ommegang makes such good beer. The fact that its practically in my backyard is a bonus. Hennepin was the first Beer i tried from ommegang, and remains my favorite. I love saisons, and this is a bonafide classic. cloudy, sour, refreshing, not to sweet, damn good stuff. This beer pours a light gold amber, hazy with a healthy foamy head retention, nice yeasty ring in the bottom of the bottle left behind. Smells of citrus, a little alcohol, light sweetness. The flavor is all saison, nice sour tartness, a little sweetness to balance it out, wonderfully refreshing. Great Beer .",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,macpapi,4.42,"Another classic that I've yet to review. Ommegang, the piece du resistance of American breweries. How I do love your fine Belgian style products. From the price, to the bottle art, to the pouring instructions and trivial facts on the back of your label, to your hometown--location of the quintesentially American sport's hall of fame and the original American popular novelist. But I digress. On with the review.  Hennepin pours a hazy/light orange color with a good, full, fluffy head. Despite its opaqueness, bubble activity is noteable in the glass. Decent lacing as well.  Smells of yeast, wheat and hops. And did I mention citrus fruit? It certainly has that in the aroma as well. Floral tones help complete a fine balance. A nasal delight.  Tastes fantastic. A great balance of sweetness, wheat and hoppy bitterness. There is a nice citrus, and slight spice kick at the end of the swallow.  In the mouth Father Hennepin's Saison is crisp, sharp and bitter all at the same time. Sweetness completes an incomprable quaff. Very impressive.  On the whole this is one of my favorite beers. It has just enough hop bitterness to complement the yeast/fruit tastes typical of Belgians. To my mind this is the finest saison around. An American classic!!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,marksto,3.88,"Pours a hazy gold with big carbonation and a thick white head that lasts. Aroma is dominated by spice with a hint of fruit. The flavor displays a dry, peppery character with an underlying lime-like citrus essence. Spritzy carbonation, a medium body, and a slightly perceptable alcohol finish make this an excellent example of the style.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,ClearDog,4.13,"Served from a 750ml bottle to my Duvel tulip glass.  Appearance -- Hazy light gold in color with a tall frothy white head, reminiscent of a cloud.  Smell -- Smells like a clear early summer day. Kind of floral . . . a lot of life. Complex.  Taste -- Semi-fruity and earthy. Very nice.  Mouthfeel -- Nice carbonation; very pleasant mouthfeel.  Drinkability -- Quite quaffable. This is one I'll be seeking out on a regular basis. This is my first Ommegang product and I like it very much. You get a lot of value for the price you pay. I cannot believe this is made in New York. It totally feels like it's from Belgium. Great stuff!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,DarkerTheBetter,4.5,"This beer pours a light, mild golden yellow with a bit of smooth white head sustained by a stream of bubbles from the bottom of the chalice. Smells of caramel and spicy yeast with a wonderful sour grape smell. The flavor is dominated by an amazing musky yeast and malt that are beyond my vocabulary, but I must try none the less. Theres a mossy anis-like yeast that just grooves with my palate and a green grass undertone. Theres also an obscured foundation of sweet grains that taste like oats and wheat. Light airy bubbles seem to unlock a hint of mandarin oranges and a very subtle dry piney hops. The mouth feel was medium bodied with an unobtrusive carbonation. Absolutely amazing. I just couldnt/cant believe that this is made in New York. Highly recommended.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Viggo,4,"Pours a very hazy golden, huge white head forms, good retention and lots of lace. Smell is sweet, honey, some cork, wheat, citrus, spice and yeast.

Good beer but I don't think I'd put it in the top 100.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Tupperwolf,4.56,"Where to begin... The presentation of this beer is stunning! It's corked and caged in a brown, round-lipped bottle that is incredibly classy for the low price. A very cautious uncorking releases pressure with a crack and swirly haze rises from the mouth of the bottle like in a mad scientist's lab. The anticipation nearly kills me...  Hennepin pours into my tulip glass a glowing orange with an off-white head of large bubbles that builds rapidly (I love you, tulip) and surprises me with its retention, forming chunky mountains that fade only when I get them all over my face for the first sip. Rising columns of tiny bubbles mark the depths of this slightly opaque beer. Lacing clings completely like spackle. Very enticing indeed.  The smell is very small... I'm lucky to catch a couple of tiny, seductive notes of alcohol and roasted nuts... A few things whizz past too fast for me to really make them out? Definitely enticing, but not exactly pungent.  Taking a deep sip sets the tip of my tongue off, huge sweetness helped by swishy carbonation, a balanced middle... A caress of flavors on the back of the tongue... It's VERY well-balanced and not too sweet or bitter. Citrus, honey, slightly metallic notes, just a little tart.  Mouthfeel is pretty unreal. There's a very, very thin caramel left by those swishy bubbles of carbonation; A medium body that in my opinion is too good to be true. Alcohol warms the back of the tongue and immediately sets off good feelings in my belly. This beer does 7.5%abv as well as I could ever hope. I can barely taste it, but the effects relax my muscles and stimulate my mind. No booziness. Drinkability is superb.. I think I might drink the whole bottle. I think this beer gets the highest scoring of those I've rated here so far.  The way this beer is presented and tastes, I could easily be fooled into thinking it's a $15 Belgian import. $5.69, are you kidding me? Unreal!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,JerzDevl2000,4.18,"This is the first beer I ever had that is a saison, and one of the first that turned me on to craft brews. It was served to me in the city, and it showed me that beer didn't have to be chugged down in mass quantities to be enjoyed. 4 years later, it still remains a wonderful brew and quite interesting to the touch and smell...  It poured a wonderful goldenrod, with a head that filled up the remaning space in my good ol' pint glass. Very cloudy, especially after I swirled the yeast that settled on the bottom of the bottle and added it to the beer that was already out. The taste is enjoyable - lots of bread, yeast, citrus, floral, and metallic notes combine for a mellow and dry taste. Not a lot of bitterness here, but it has a very European tone to it and it became more and more enjoyable as it warmed up throughout my drinking session. The lacing was wonderful too - the bubbles on the side of my pint glass are practically defying gravity, even as I take a few minutes in between sips!  I recently had the Southampton Cuvee Des Fluers at David Copperfield's in New York City, and I feel that their offering and this brew would do a lot to expand the average beer drinkers horizons. The only thing that I would wish for regarding Hennepin is that it would be more readily available in my neck of the woods. I believe the effort to increase it's exposure would be well worth it in the end. Highly recommended!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Phatz,3.26,"750 ml bottle poured into my tulip glass.  Appearance: Pours a light brown with a hint of orange hue to it. Translucent but hazy. Nice head. Highly carbonated.  Smell: Very sweet malty smell with lots of citrus and surprisingly yeasty and bready.  Taste: Sweet malts, bread, a bit too much yeastyness (for me), citrus, and bit of wheat. Very good. Not my favorite flavor for a Saison, but still a good beer.  Mouthfeel: Nice medium bodied highly carbonated beer. Crisp finish feels refreshing.  Drinkability: Though Saison may not be my favorite style and this is not my favorite Saison it is still very drinkable and a 'classy' beer that is good to impress with. It is quite drinkable and worthy of a justifiable occasion from time to time.  Hope this is helpful. Cheers!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Tons of fluffy white head, not much retention, but leaves a nice lace. Mix up the yeast sediment and it becomes quite murky.  S: Earthy, spicy and bready.  T: Spicy, earthy, bready. Slightly bitter, with a hint of tartness in the aftertaste. Mix up the yeast sediment and the earthy flavour is really intensified.

42,141,hustlemuscle,4.5,"I had a 16 oz bottle sitting in my beer closet for about six months, and broke it out this weekend, on the coldest day of the season for a taste of summer.  Damn. It was a bit hot when it was young, but holy moly does it age well. An elixer of summer, just a magical brew.  Clear golden, with a huge fat puffy head that looks like merangue. As it settled large bubbles in the head popped, leaving a jagged landscape of head. Spicy and tart smelling, but it tastes like summer. Clean and crisp, light and airy, grassy and spicy yeast with a touch of fruit. The time alone in the dark really helped this one, calmed the alchohol and melded things perfectly. I found it a little hot before, but now, damn.  Light and airy, with just a hint of spice from the yeast, this one is a really special beer, mellow, full of subtle flavor. Get some, store some, love some.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Phyl21ca,3.77,Bottle: Poured a clear golden yellow ale with a huge bubbly white head with above standard retention. Aroma of pear and lemon with some distinguishable yeast. Taste is really hoppier then most Saison I have tried with a dry finish. Body is quite full and spice mix is interesting but could have been more accentuated. Very interesting take on the style.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,nlmartin,4.92,Poured from the bottle into a wide mouthed goblet.  Appearance: This beer looks fantastic in the goblet. The beer is a somewhat hazy golden coloration. The head towered in the glass a solid off white. The lacing clung like pancake batter on the glass. Very tight bubbles noted breaking the surface.  Smell: Very spicy hoppy smell. Lots of peppery spicyness plays with fruity goodness. Floral notes play with citrus. There is a nice musty spicy yeasty notes. A very nice funky smell plays around the nose.  Taste: There is an initial floral citrusy sweetness on initial taste. There is plenty of spicy funky notes in the flavor. Very nicely hopped and malted.  Mouthfeel: This beer is meduim bodied plus. There is loads of carbonation in this beer. The finish is dry and leaves you wanting more beer.  Drinkability: This is just an easy to drink beer. Pure drinking pleasure through and through.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,lackenhauser,4.1,"Very nice amber/golden color with a great fluffy off white head. Vinuous and earthy aroma-heavy yeast and spices. Big malt flavor. Extremely spicy-peppery and a sour grapefruitiness to it. Earthy as all get out-almost dirt like in spots. Fairly dry finish to it. I dont really care for the mouthfeel-its too bright and fizzy to me, though it lessens as the beer warms. Even some of the highly carbonated triples arent this fizzy. Overall a very drinkable beer. Ommegang certainly gets high marks from me. They really got a good thing going on.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

One of the best looking very light/pale beers I've seen. Radient glow happening here. Aroma is extremely pleasant + delectable. Soft aromatic spice, pepper, ginger...etc blended amazingly well. Taste is in the same boat. The taste is perfectly mouth watering as is the smell. Everything is really subtle yet really awesome. Mouth is sticky and makes you want more. Drinkability is through the roof.  This is one sick brew, one of my favorites. A+++",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Frozensoul327,4.23,"One of the better beers i've had from the Saison style. Pours out to a slighly cloudy golden color with a nice head of white foam. High level of carbonation. Aromas of earth and barnhouse are strong, with some sweet malts and spice notes. Taste is very quaffable; flavors of malts, volatile yeast, sweet grain and mild corn are present and blend quite well. I have to say, this beer gets better as it slightly warms. Mouthfeel is smooth and silky, going down far too easy for the higher ABV that it possesses. Drinkability is good. I really like this beer, and considering i'm not a big fan of the style, it's very good. Highly recommended for the style.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,orfeu,5,"750 mL, caged and corked. ""Cave-aged"" in Howe Caverns for 8 months; released October 8, 2005 and aged in my cellar for another two months. Bottle doesn't look any different than the regular ""non-cave-aged"" stuff, except there's a hangtag proclaiming that it sat 156 feet underground, etc. and there's a bunch of fuzzy cobwebby stuff and dust on the outside of the bottle. Hazy golden orange with massive, beautiful egg-white head that meringues and leaves an incredible webby lacing all the way down the sides of my Ommegang cervoise. Aroma is yeasty, bitter citrus peel, fresh apple juice, vanilla. Spicy, earthy, and fruity flavors abound. A bit vinous at the back of the palate. Granny Smith apples and newly-mown grass. Mellow ginger spiciness, yeast, and a lingering aftertaste of peach cobbler with vanilla and powdered ginger. Medium body; creamy smooth and dry for so much pronounced fruit flavor. This is one of my all time favorite beers from an all time favorite brewery. Saisons are all pretty unique (at least the ones I've tried), so it's a bit risky to say which one is ""the Best."" However, Hennepin, whether cave-aged or not, is absolutely one of the finest examples of the style in the world and easily the best Saison produced in the U.S. Difficult to imagine anyone pulling it off better than this. Fives all around.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,gotbeer,4.27,"This brew pours a translucent amber with a decent head that fades without lacing the glass too much.  The smell is a little pungent and peppery.  The taste is pretty incredible. There are flavors of lemon and tart fruits. Pepper and spice with a bite of hops. Quite a bit of complexity with a sharp mouthfeel. The drinkablity is unreal. It is as great on a summer afternoon as it is on a cold winter day. I can honestly say I have never regretted opening one of these up. An incredible beer.  A great saison, and I would heartily reccomend it.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,germaniac,4.55,"Looks- Pours hazy yellow, with a golden shine when backlit. The offwhite bubbly head eases down to lace rings after a quick exit from the bottle.  Nose- Hearty yeast, with hints of orange zest. Not to mention the ever popular funk that makes this style so unique. A little bit of pepper aroma in there, too.  Taste&Mouthfeel- Peppery spice with a dash of cinnamon. Fruity sweetness and a doughy yeast presence all combine to make an excellent beer. Lightly carbonated and easily drank.  Overall, really one of the best beer experiences I've had in awhile. The total package. it does everything perfectly stylewise, but still remains extremely accessible. From the Elk Grove BevMo.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,benito,3.99,"Pours an opaque straw with lots of head and carbonation (though this may have been because of how it was stored). The foam leaves a nice lacing and clumps well. The bouquet is sweet and earthy: scents of coriander, bread dough, and pepper.  Similarly, the flavor itself is a wonderful mix of sweet and dry. The initial taste of pear was followed by a bitter dryness and then a smoothing sweetness, which was dominated by coriander and citrus flavors. In some ways, I was surprised by how sweet this was compared to other saisons I've had...at times I could have been convinced that this was a witbier/saison hybrid. But, the consistent dryness and earthy flavors (nuts, leaves) in the aftertaste keep this grounded in the realm of the farmhouse, albeit a slightly sweeter and more light-bodied one than I've experienced in the past.  The balance and light-body made this very refreshing and quite drinkable. A delicious beer all-around.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,kmcnair,4.3,"750ml bottle, corked and caged  Pours a nice straw yellowed hue and makes an inch of densely bubbled white head into my petrus goblet. Sweet aroma, filled with banana, coriander & cloves. Sweet bready flavor with notes of light fruits, peppery spice, medium hop bittering, banana. Bit of alcoholic bite. I really am enjoying this. Mouthfeel opens with a peppery carbonation but as the bottle warms it becomes velvety smooth and finishes dry. This is an awesome saison considering how easy it is to get. Definitely will be a staple in my beer fridge.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

42,141,shbobdb,4,"So this is the much vaulted Saison -- I don't hate it. I specify that because in the past I have found spiced beers unpalatable, and I had been specifically avoiding this style for that reason. Evidently, when spices are placed the in hands of a master brewer, they don't suck. This beer pours like Dreadnaught, a hazy straw colour with a generous head. It smells, like a beer. By that I mean, it smells similar to a variety of continental pils, a pleasant smell indeed. The taste follows the smell. It is simple and subtle. It actually reminds me of a Grolsch; however there is an ethereal taste, something I can't place my finger on. Similar to bubblegum, actually. That's good. Ohhh, as it warms some more flavours come out. It loses the Grolsch quality and grains a granular flavour. Not bad. Is that corriander? Not sure. I'm not one to pick out spices. But, yeah, this is a good beer.  Oh wow. 7.7% is what it says on the bottle. Well hidden, well hidden indeed.  Makes me actually want to try other Saison-style beers. Maybe Belgium makes something worth consuming other than french fries. . .",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Light in color with a large white head. Extrememely effervescent - again, like champagne. Smells nice - very rustic.  I admit to not being such a fan of the saison style, but I will do my best to rate this beer objectively. It went down very easy, but I felt the fruit was a bit too tart for my taste. Pears, pineapple, bananas, etc. are all very apparant, however I felt none of the sweetness of the fruit was incorporated. The aftertaste was very much like a dry champagne. Goes down very easy.  All in all, I think it is a fine example of the style, but certainly not my thing. But if you love saisons, you have to give this one a try.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

42,141,FirstMan,4.35,"Big bottle with champagne-style cork. I'm especially happy about this beer because when I got it at Julio's it came with a great Hennepin glass. Pay me off with free beer stuff - hell yes!  But really. This is a beautiful golden wheat color. Misty throughout. Clean white head was big and vibrant but then settled down into a splotchy layer across the top. Big time lacing.  Nose is warm summer fruit - bananas and peaches are in there - with a slight tinge of allspice and cardamom. Crisp and light, but with that sweet candy edge that always seems to be in the Belgians.  Again with the fruit aspect in the palate, but hop bitterness eases its way throughout. Honestly the taste and the smell are tied very closely together in this one. Much of the character that I got in the nose is echoed with equal subtlety on the tongue. There's a bit of a lingering bitterness and alcohol essence in the nose after a few seconds.  Smooth and creamy with a light bubbly character.  Very good. I'm looking forward to trying more of this style.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Shiloh,3.88,"A very nice product...now this beer has a head on its shoulders, starting to three fingers and leading to full thick lace with an island. The colour is a very pale yellow and slightly murky. Very lively, large bubbled carbonation with a citrus like scent and a whiff of the skunk.The body is a medium plus. A light lemon start, a little yeasty with a semi-sweet malt like finish. A lengthy aftertaste matching the cycle of the taste. A very dry mouthfeel due to the high ABV.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,GnomeKing,4.03,"Following the instructions on the bottle, I poured this one according to the directions and was rewarded with a large, rich head of tight bubbles that extended above my La Chouffe glass's lip but never spilled over the side.  The champagne mouthfeel was nice, but a little thin for my liking. The taste was of sweet and citrus-y fruits...some lemons, but more prominently pinneapples and apricots. Even pears seemed distantly there. Flavors take their time emerging, so you have to sip a decent bit to appreciate its complexity.  There was something about the beer overall that made its flavor profile seem timid and polite rather than subtle and well blended. Although I enjoyed the flavors, I felt that I was looking for them rather than letting them call attention to themselves.  This is a really nice beer, but it doesn't have the stones to really assert itself. The citrus bite is a little too strong for me to laud it as being highly smooth and drinkable. The beer is on the fence between a Belgian-style flavor bomb and a mellowed-out, easily-quaffable brew.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,nickss,4.18,"Pours a straw-yellow hue with a gargantuan frothy head. Large bubbles stream from the bottom of my pint glass to join their brethren in the foam that caps this beautiful libation. Looks almost champagne-like.  Huge citrus smells hit me in the face as soon as I poured it. I didn't even need to stick my nose close to the glass. Extremely pungent, but in a good way. Hops join the lemony citrus in the nose. Smells crisp, refreshing, and clean.  This brew is amazingly complex... the initial taste is one of hops and lemon, but add on to that a sort off outdoorsy dirty-in-a-good-way flavour. Hints of alcohol peek occasionally through, but only for a moment. The taste, too, has some semblences of champagnes, and some wine-like qualities as well.  Medium bodied, yet tight and crisp, as I would expect from a saison. Extremely refreshing. Glad I pulled this one out to review before it got too cold... I think it would have lost some of its appeal (though not too much).  Extremely drinkable beer, if you can handle the 7.7% abv. Wonderful spring/summer beer... glad this is finally available in NC, as it is certainly one of the best deals for the money out there.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Appearance features a cloudy, pale golden color with a thick, soapy looking raft of head and decorative lacing that lasts. The best part of the nose is the citrus and other subtle fruit interests that predominate the clove and spices. The taste is light but very sharp and includes roasted malt and a smooth bubbly entry that eventually gives way to a crisp finish that reminds you this is actually a beer and not a fine wine. High in alcohol flavor too but very nicely shadowed by fruit and peppery flavors. This beer is really good, probably a little too good for MNF but I'm definitely not complaining. Guess I'll need to investigate this Saison thing..",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,bigflatsbeerman,4.88,"This has been my favorite beer for the last 4-5 years, so of course I have a high opinion of it. The most striking thing is the carbonation and head. It actually looks like someone is pumping bubbles into each glass, it is so lively. It is light in color, but cloudy. Once you get beyond the look the taste is exceptional and it is truly an outstanding drinkable beer.  I prefer heavier darker beers in winter and lighter during the warmer months, but I enjoy Hennepin 12 months of the year.

The smell is definitely fruity (apple and pear) but with the characteristic Belgian-style malt/yeast earthiness that makes me think of nuts.  Taste is not as sweet as I expected based on the smell (and my limited experience with saisons, which I thought were sweeter). The earthy characteristics shine through instead. Alcohol taste is present more than I expected, but not out of balance. As drinking continues, the pear flavor is the one that persists.  Feels creamy but light on the tongue. As I get toward the end, wow(!), I realize how much I am enjoying this beer. While I wasn't initially floored, the great balance in this beer makes it a great drink!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Oxymoron,3.48,"The pour is an off orangish yellow color with a cloudy appearance. The head did not pour out too fluffy but did last a good amount of time. The lacing also was good.  The smell is no doubt a Belgium. A sweet malt and sugary aroma. Hints of lighter spice and it reminded me of a Belgian wit more then a saison. Some fruity notes remind me of oranges and lighter citrus notes.  The taste is a light for a saison. There is some lighter tart, almost apple flavor and citrus zest, but not really noticeable for what I would consider for a saison. A good sweet aroma and a Belgian yeast taste are most noticeable. At the back end there is a light candy taste. The tart flavor lasts a while for the aftertaste but is limited. There is some spice flavor, cloves and white pepper. Reminds me of a Belgium wit.  There is a higher then normal carbonation and the body is light. The higher carbonation does bring out more zest in the back end though. One thing to note is there is no hint of the higher alcohol. Sneaky.  Overall I would have liked more of a tart flavor but that taste is good and a very enjoyable beer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

42,141,sopor,3.77,"My first farmhouse saison, and I've been told this is a very good representation of the style.  Pale gold brew with ample frothy white head. A few towers of rapidly rising bubbles add to a creamy film that will stick around for a bit. Smells yeasty ""funky"" the same way most Belgian ales smell to me.  Malty and dry with some definite hop bittering. Some tangy sourness and that yumm Belgian-style yeastiness, with herbal and earthy notes. Very tasty American brew. Light body with fizzy-frothy carbonation.  Tasty and quaffable, nothign stood out extraordinary, but I'd drink it again.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,DevilDogBeer,4.7,Hennepin is one of my favorite farm house ales. The pour is smooth with a great white head forming almost immediately if poured into a fluted glass. The head is creamy and stays for the duration while lacing down the glass. The beer is a cloudy honey color and the bottle conditioning adds an interesting pattern to the final pour. The smell is a bit sour with great malt notes and yeast esters. The taste is exceptional; it is a tad sour but only in balance not in excess. The malty sweetness creeps up slowly as the aftertaste fades into complex notes of barley and yeast. The mouthfeel is crisp and clean and this beer is very drinkable. This is my favorite beer from Ommegang. Cheers!,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,hoffman,4.52,"Pours with a nice billowing white head, rising to 2 1/2 fingers, settling down to 1/8"", laces all the way with the glass. The smell of this one is sweet, mostly malt with some fruity hints and a bit of alcohol and floral hops. The taste is very nice, fruit and a lot of malt up front a bit of grain in the middle and a nice hop kick at the end. The feel of this one is the best I have had, like liquid velvet. Smooth but robust and full, creamy but not overbearing, with a well balanced carbonation that tingles just right...very well done. Overall this is one that will take permanate residence in my chiller. A nice .750 to have on hand for nights with friends and nights at home.  Review edit...I tried this one initally over chilled. As the beer warms it unlocks hidden smells and flavors that are not present when cooler in temp. There is a sweeter more pronounced body and more hop character when warm, the boquet also opens up to a more spicy oroganic nose, with a definite yeast presence that envokes a bananna aroma that should make chaquita jealous.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Backer2004,3.97,"The thing I like most about this beer is that my friends and family don't give a God awful look when they try it, unlike most high gravity beers that are filtering into this post Pop the Cap state. It's enjoyable in every fashion but does not scream Wow in my opinion. Light and floral, the hoppiness is not overwhelming and is easy enough to consume (even though a glassful is still sitting in my fridge two days later). Cheaper compared to the other Ommegang choices available here.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Mouthfeel is also superior - carbonation is present but not overbearing.

42,141,jamesdergen,3.81,"Appearance: Pours a beautiful hazy, honey color with a nice Duvel-esque head that sticks around.  Smell: I can't pick up much here. Some yeast and maybe hints of vanilla?  Taste: Nice, big floral/citrus taste up front that fades into some delicious Belgian yeast and nice, clean finish with the alcohol making it's presence known. Not too sweet and not too dry.  Mouthfeel: Carbonated, but not too fizzy. Light-to-medium bodied brew that has a clean finish.  Drinkability: For a stronger brew, this one goes down relatively easy. I'll finish this bottle for sure.  A nice, well-balanced offering from Ommegang. Very similar to Duvel, but more complex and fruity. For the price, I'll buy this again.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,petercmartin1,4.35,"Poured from a 750ml.  Appearance: Nice, crystal clear (was careful to leave the yeast at the bottom of the bottle) with a slighly orangeish copper color. Beautiful, fluffy head that stood almost 1 1/2 inches over the top of my glass. Head lasted a good long time and even when faded, left a good 1/4 inch on top of my beer.  Aroma; wonderful bittersweet aroma, somewhat honeylike but more like caramel just before it hits the burnt stage (its lost a lot of sweetness, but hasn't become overly bitter yet). Another whiff and I realize what it is. It is the smell of those candied almonds you can buy at fairs, but it is faint, just barely there. It's that moment when the wind brings just the essence of it your way, for just a second then it is gone. Also the aromas of lemon, yeast, and raw bread. Really enjoyable and very complex.  Taste: After all those aromas it would be easy to be let down by this beer, but I'm not. All those essences follow through in the flavor. What really comes through though is a lemon like tartness then flavors of malt, spices (clove and the slightest hint of cinnamon), yeast (in the form of raw bread dough) and ending with a slight tannic dryness similar to eating apple peels. After a minute or two the aftertaste develops into spice again, this time with black pepper predominating. There is also just the slightest hint of warmth from the higher alcohol content. I really love the complexity of this beer. It's got a lot of things going for it. The only drawback is that first initial drink. I found it to be just a little on the tart side, but overall this beer rocks.  There are a lot of things going on in this beer, so I don't know that this is a beer that you would drink glass after glass of. It could become fatiguing. Also with a slightly higher alcohol content 1 or 2 bottles and I would be ready to switch for the day, but only to come back again tomorrow.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,ODBRIP,4.88,"This is awesome; i love the citrusy/belgian, but not too sweet thing it's got going. Much more drinkable than a belgian, I think. you could drink a ton of these, and not get tired...but you might fall over, as it's pretty strong. I think the all around drinkability is due to the nice effervensence and citrus taste. good in any weather.  I would have given it all 5's, but I suppose it could be improved...not really sure how.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

This beer has a spicy aroma, with a little pepper mixed in. It smells slightly hoppy. I can detect a clove aroma. Also, it is slightly floral. The taste is not as spicy as the aroma would suggest. It is still spicy, but I just expected a bit more. The alcohol is slightly noticable in the flavor. It has a hoppy flavor also. It also has a very slight citrus flavor. Lemon, I think. Also, this beer has a slight sour taste. The sour taste is appealing. This beer is highly carbonated, which is good for the style. It is light, and crisp, providint a very refreshing, smooth beer. It leaves a slightly hoppy, slightly spicy aftertaste. I think this beer would make a great session beer. the only problem I have it the alcohol content.

It states that you should pour it slow and give it a very generous head, which I did. Pours a pale orangeade and a cloudy color. The head is luxurious, frothy and white about two inches high. The head really sticks around to the bottom of the glass too. Very nice appearance  The aroma is fruity, apples and bananas with a hint of vanilla. The flavor is very good with an apple taste, along with cinnamon. There is a mild bit of alchohol in the flavor that warms the body with each swallow. There are mild hops in the aftertaste, giving it a nice balance in the mouthfeel.  The taste really does improve as the beer warms, and, by bottle end, I detected a nice dry, wine like flavor.

42,141,DaPeculierDane,4.88,"I've been a little too intimidated to review this beer for some time. There is just no way an amateur like myself can do it any justice but I will do my best. It is simply spectacular.  Appearances first: I love the fact that Hennepin comes with a champagne style cork in a 750 bottle. Like all of Ommegangs beers, it is fun to open but that is just the beginning.  Hennepin pours a rich gold. Its sticky and its head lasts and lasts and lasts longer than just about any beer that I have ever seen. Its highly viscous, globular, and almost alive.  When I tilt my snifter, my Cabernet/Bordeaux glass, or my goblet of Hennepin the head forms a brilliant lacey coating around the bottom of the glass. It doesnt dissipate. It just rests forming a different beautiful pattern each and every time I tilt.  Furthermore, Hennepin has an intensity in its hue and brightness that is almost unrivaled. This is a beautiful beer.  Onto the smell: Hennepin smells like I would imagine an idyllic Medieval farm to smell like: grain, straw, horses, sacks of dried flour, pepper, and of course, a beautiful lady. As tripe as this may sound, I assure you that Hennepin does indeed carry with it a quality that reminds me strongly of William Goldmans the princess bride. This beer smells like I would imagine Buttercups hair to smell, utterly perfect.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Hennepin is medicinal, no doubt about that. Its taste is robust and ads vigor to the body. There are also most certainly elements of lemon and grass, freshly baked drop scones, honey, and biscuits. The finish is dry and nutty, leaving the mouth thirsty for more. It wraps and warms the tongue and coats the palate, stomach and esophagus. I cant get enough.  Drinkability: Unmatched.  This beer breaks the arguments of wine snobs down to detrital slime.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,meathookjones,4.45,"Cloudy straw yellow with a tall white fluffy head. A bit light on the lacing. Funky yeast scents with lots of fruity notes to it. A bit lighter grassy hops. Light fruitiness, pears and apples mainly with a backing of spiciness and yeast. A bit of doughy malt and citrus flavor blend in well. Spicy grassy and funky yeast finish this out. Lively in the mouth with carbonation this is also clean, crisp and quite refreshing. Very easy drinking to the point it almost goes down to quickly.

42,141,jaluria,4.22,"Pours a yellowish color like hay with a white head. The smell is very interesting because there is so much going on...malt, yeast, fruit undertones. A hint of bread as well (probably from the yeast). The taste was exceptional with it's complexity and balanced texture. I tasted a bit of fruit-inspired bitterness with some spice flavoring. As the brew warms, I taste more sweetness and less bitterness, but that may be my tastebuds being confused by this beer. My mouth is left wanting more; a bready texture on my tongue.

Just-ripe citrus, a dash of cough syrup, clean pale male. That medicinal quality I find in every Ommegang I've tasted is really a turn-off. I must be hypersensitive to it.  Soft on the palate. Cool and clean.  Not my cup of beer. The medicinal taste is just a bit too much. Maybe I need to grow in that direction.

42,141,semihobo,4.48,"Mmmm uncorked a 750, out of the warmish cellar and chilled a little.  Into the chalice. Huge head that takes a bit of time in dropping to a reasonable plateau. Retention is incredible -- ideal amount of lace puddling on top, even over 30 minutes. Color is a beautiful subdued orange, kind of like Pranqster (the only beer I've reviewed with similar appearance). The hue screams candy goodness.  Intense smell, especially as it warms. Sugar, two part citrus smell that is from both the malts and sugars and the hops. Some alcohol. A buried hint of piney hops. Some yeast as well. Quite a heap of flavors, whoa, possible to get your nostrils a little singed.  Complex taste, too. Bananas and apricots, with some marshmallows whipped in. Some spices, maybe some clove, also hop bitterness. Flat, matzah-like breadiness present from the beginning. All of those flavors very distinct and well-defined. I don't feel like I'm grasping for straws at all. Only downsides are some alcohol notes and a little bit of souring as it warms a lot. Has the essence of Belgium -- maybe the yeast, something about it screams ""belgian!"" in a nice way.  Mouthfeel is great, you can swirl around a sip and then lean back and savor. Can drink leisurely or quickly, nice carbonation that matches sugars well. It seems like this beer maybe holds carbonation a little better as it warms than others .. not sure, just how it feels. Would be interesting to measure. The citrus makes this a littte crisp.  Even as this gets warm it is still quite drinkable. ABV is not prohibitive, and matches the price range / bottle size (750ML bottles are consumed much more in wine servings and at a wine pace). I need to try more Saisons, I think this beer is excellent as a session beer, a special occasion beer, a gateway beer (bonus: I had two non-BA type friends try this and both were exclaiming ""I gotta get into this stuff!""), anything. This beer is especially solid, it leads in all categories ...  At the big grocery store (Wegmans) it is $4.49 for a 750ML ... at that price, I am drinking this a LOT more.

Aroma is a funky blend of malt, spices and hops; i detect pepper, nutmeg, corrainder, sourdough bread, lightly floral and mineraly hops, a subtle but intesnsely complex aroma. Taste is equally complex and challenging; at first the bready malt takes center stage, then onto the spices including but not limited to: nutmeg, lemon zest, corrainder, and pepper, and then a lightly bitter hops flavor that is earthy, mineraly and slightly citrusy. There is also a fruity yeast flavor that adds yet another layer of complexity to this fantastic brew. The mouthfeel is smooth with moderate carbonation, and the drinkability is excellent (especially on a hot summer day) and the alcohol is very well concealed and only lightly warming.

42,141,mushroomcloud,4.3,".750 corked and caged bottle. No date visible on cork, label, or bottle.  Pours a hazy butterscotch color. 1"" billowy cream colored head recedes to a 1/4"" and then finally to a cap. Great sheet of lace.  Initial aroma is yeast. Delicate floral and perfumey nose. Fruity with some hops way in the back.  Tastes fruity. Ripe apricot, peach and honey. A little tart. Powder. Some hops in the end balancing out the fruit. Nice, nice, nice!!!  Hennepin is full of fruit. Good carbonation. Smooth and clean in the mouth.  Very high drinkability with a long fruity finish. I am going to go back to the little store in Austin where I found these (Ommegang is not around TX anymore) and buy them out! Fabulous beer!!

42,141,EPseja,4.5,"After a fantastic time at Belgium comes to Cooperstown, I figured it was about time for me to get some Ommegang ratings up, starting with my favorite of their line.  Served in a tulip glass at just above fridge temperature.  A - Pours a hazy apricot gold color with a huge, pillowy head composed of large bubbles near the surface and tiny bubbles at the top. Lacing is clingy and dense. Makes my mouth water just looking at it... Wonderful!  S - Sweet but subtle summer fruitiness behind a thin veil of organic, hop-laced hay. Bright and fresh despite the sour farmhouse notes. Very well done; captures the essence of this style exquisitely.  T - First on the tongue is a honey sweetness wrapped around a tiny nugget of fresh, leafy hops. Slight bitterness reveals itself in the middle along with a mild tartness to balance the sweet. The finish is organic, yeasty, slightly bitter, and moderately dry. Alcohol warmth becomes prevalent with the deliciously bittersweet aftertaste.  M - Enters the mouth slightly viscously and wells up into a gentle sea of round and creamy foam. Despite the largeness in the mouth, it goes down very smoothly. Mouthfeel improves as it warms.  D - This is a fantastically tasty brew and a great example of this style. Easy to drink, easy to go in for the next sip. Well done, Ommegang!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,IceAce,4.37,"Bottle # 0395  Yellow to golden color, very hazy, kind of like sunshine as it breaks through the fog. Three fingers of dense white foam, the consistancy of whipped egg whites, caps the body and leaves exquisite lacing on the sides of a beer-clean stemmed tulip glass.  Beautiful funky barnyard aroma, complete with earthy clove, banana taffy, closing with a crisp dryness. Entry provides an initial sweetness which is quickly overcome by a complex mix of tropical fruits, sweet malt, and yeasty dryness.  The mouthfeel pleases the palate and the finish is champagne-dry with a lingering yeasty fade and plenty of residual sugal left on the lips.  A wonderful saison to say the least...many thanks to beerbuddy JiLLian for this one!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Appearance: straw colored, cloudy with an appropriate head for this style. Some lacing. Smell: Seems right on. Undescribable, but appropriate to style. Smells musty? Taste: Finishes sweet for a second, then bone dry. Mouthfeel: Surprisingly full. Coats the tongue Drinkability: I like it, but certainly not a session beer. Drank it with korean food tonight and it worked pretty well. Most Korean dishes have some sweet and some hot elements, so the sweetness of the beer and the spiciness fit in.  Overall, I will be glad to get the Ommegang line back here in NC. They are really doing fine work up there at Cooperstown.

42,141,NeroFiddled,4.6,"Well, I've tried cave-aged Hennepin twice now, and I honestly have to say that it doesn't smell or taste any different to me than any other cellared bottle of Hennepin that I've had. It's a very decent beer fresh, and I appreciate that, but I like to put 6 to 12 months on it to drop the yeast and soften it a touch. So, that said, the cave age is no different from my cellared bottles except that there's dust and tiny chunks of rock (?) on the bottle. If you don't have a cellar that holds 55-65 F during summer, you might want to try one of these; but other than that, forget the extra expense and do it yourself. It's only a few buck put away for a little while (it doesn't really improve beyond conditioning, and I think it's quite nice and ready to go with even four months under its belt). But keep in mind, this is one of my favorite beers to begin with, and my favorite beer from Ommegang, so maybe I'm biased. Cheers!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Tried their Abbey Ale last night, was intrigued and at $4.39 for 25 oz, had to give this one a try. My first saison/farmhouse ale.  Pours a golden straw yellow with a frothy white head. Nose is complex like its Abbey Ale cousin, but this time it's floral, fruity and spicy. Taste follows suit with apples, pears and grapefruit dominating with a spicy, hoppy bite. Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing and the 7.7% abv is hidden so well I think I could down a couple big bottles of this, though it would probably hit me like a train.

I waited for it to die down - it didn't - so I stuck my nose in it. The flavars are delightful with complex spice and sweet malt. The beer is full bdies and light at the same time.

It taste's more clean than dupont. This doesn't taste like it was made in a farmhouse, it tastes like the modern american brewery it was made in. Dig? Appearance was the highlight for me. I seriously sat looking at the glass for days like it was tv or something. the bubbles come up from little clusters and the head is never too big but it never really dies either. all the glass gets wider it goes from yellow to orange to clay. artwork. lacing  smell: too subdued. if you can get a smell you smell green apples, yeast and other goodies. it is not funky though. which can be good  taste: it's good but not complex. there is a sweetness and a dryness, more green apples. there is a puckeringness to this beer. yeast. i like it. mouthfeel: carbinated but just right. again there is a dryness in the aftertaste. drinkability: high. i can't seem to stop and it keeps getting better. notes: once ajusted to the style this is a great beer. this is not a drink alone and meditate beer like some belgians. this a drink in a hottub full of people at a party type of beer. there is no beer that feels this light for 7.5. recomended. for the price double recomended.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,BEERchitect,4.35,"Always great to have a fresh Hennepin in my glass, however this seems to be a bit of a struggle as of late. The more and more I taste this beer, I draw comparisons to Duvel. The dryness, peppery notes, soft pilsner note on the front end... the beer is a classic Belgian Pale Ale but the light dusty aroma and taste bring on those attic-y aged cork-like notes (along with that estery lemon zest and the front-loaded sweetness) that pulls it to the Saison side. Some may see this beer as being too clean but I love the refreshing and efforvescent life of the beer.  Second tasting at USBTC at Jungle Jim's, Cincinnati. I have yet to drink a better Saison. Though this beer is big for the style, what it gives up in drinkability, it gives back in character and flavorfull-ness. Very citrusy (lemons, oranges, peaches, pears) with a lightly Belgian yeast flavor. Soft, similar to Wits, but more spicy and fizzy. Alcohols are high, lessening the quaffability. But, Ommegang can do no wrong; it's a great beer.  I have always been impressed with all of the Ommegang beers. Hennepin looks very yellow, cloudy, and carbonous. Dense white head that laced well. Smells citrusy sweet and citrusy tart. Spicy, yeasty, and earthy with a mild hop aroma. Tastes Lightly malty. Sweet like pears, apples, and honey. Spices of corriander, cloves, and a bit peppery. Tart on the side of white wine or cider. Wheat and yeast round out the flavors. Light hop flavor compound the spice and offset the sweet. Feels tingly and mildly hot to the toung and palate. Medium body and creamy texture. Finishes powdery sweet and lightly tart, all the while, dry and crisp.

Flavors of light malts and sugar, yeast, some bittering hops, sharp citrus/bananas, very clean and smooth. Crisp-like, but not dry. Long aftertaste of earthy bananas.

Slight head that created a whole hell of a lot of lace. Nose is citrus with some spice hovering in the background. Flavor was great. Lots of spice and a solid malt backbone. Truckloads of spice threatened to overwhelm the tongue. Alcohol came through quite vibrantly also. Mouthfeel was more carbonated than I expected with a thick and heavy feel on the tongue.

Smell: Bananas and light fruit prevail here. Alcohol is effectively masked.  Taste: Rancid fruit (in a good way, I promise). Strong banana flavors. Hint of bitterness. Flash of dryness in the middle. Alcohol flares up and then rides through out. Aftertaste is banana and rotten fruit with slight alcohol burnination.  MF: Stinging carbonation gives way to fluffy smoothness.  Drinkability: Very good. Excellent taste and perfect abv.  A 750ml of Hennepin is my personal favorite for a post-work relaxation session.

It had a nice golden orange color which was so clear it was like looking through a window. The second pour was a little bit more cloudy because of the yeast follow through.

VIA the pour you will receive a nice bulky-chunky dense foamy head, of which some remained throughout the entire sampling experience. The aroma is one of fine yeast and clean doughy must; completely appealing and totally appropriate. The hue of light clover honey fills the glass with a noticeable haze from the presence of the generous quantity of yeast within. The taste is awesome; honey-lemon laden fruit cake, good bitter citric element just rides to the point of being discernable-hiding waiting to be noticed. The combination of the refreshing citric element, honorable weight and flavors bursting from the seams makes this a virtual session brew lacking the cloying heaviness of some of it's counterparts.

42,141,scooter231,5,"I should start this review out by saying that I'm quite biased towards the Ommegang Brewery beers- it's one of my favorite breweries, and Hennepin is my favorite beer. However, I will strive to be as honest as possible despite my love of it.  Can I rate this a 6? Please? It's fabulous. It's similar to the regular Hennepin in many ways...it pours a pale gold color, with lots of head- gorgeous. The smell is like Hennepin with more bite- it's sharper.  Taste is, simply, yummy. It's a bit crisper, drier, fruitier than regular Hennepin, and a bit more alcoholic tasting. The mouthfeel is bubbly, medium-bodied, and plays on the palate. Drinkable? You better believe it.  Now, I'm always in the mood for Hennepin- but, I can see this lovely cave-aged version being more of a specific craving. That being said... I can see cravings for this happening frequently. The sad thing is there are only 3360 out there... mine was number 1010. Oh well. Get it while it's there. Yummy, yummy, yummy.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Herbal, earthy hops follow and round this out nicely. A very tasty brew that is equally refreshing.  Smooth creamy mouthfeel with champagne like effervescence.

The taste is an experience for the entire tongue. I will need to sample this one again to get a better handle on exactly what is going on here. No biting hoppiness -- good so far as I'm concerned.

A little dissapointed in the bottled version, but overall still a very enjoyable beer.  Poured from the bomber into a toulip glass yielding a big 2 finger fluffy snow white head. A little uneven in some places, and a little chucky in the head, but this is probably because of my pour and not the beer. The beer itself was a dull yellow color and some yeast sediment was present in the pour. A lot of carbonation streamed up the side of the glass throughout the sample and some patches (but no rings) of lace throughout the sample.  Smeel had a deep citrus and wheat smell. Similiar to a hefeweizen. I had had a Julius Echter earlier in the day and this smell reminded me of that. (A little different that its smell on tap). Some definite lemon zest type fragrance in the nose as well.  The taste was quite citrusy up front and crisp but not quite as crisp as my last sample. The bottled verision seemed a bit heavier and did not quite have the same thirst-quenching bite. It was just slightly bitter and very much carbonated. Towards the end of the sample it seemed to almost take on a bit of a grape taste.  Very light on the palate, yet still heavier than its tap version. Lots of carbonation.  Overall still very drinkable but not as good overall as my last on-tap sample.

Aroma is banana and yeast and musty. a little stanky cheese. Flavor is sweet honey and lemon, with some peppery spice. Finish is ruby red grapefruit and citrus zest. touch of alcohol burn on the throat. Second glassfull paired well with some asiago cheese.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,horndecker,4.35,"I tasted this one from the small 375ml bottle. Haven't noticed any difference between the 375 and the 750. The 750ml is more fun, though.  Honey colored and cloudy. A beautiful bright white head forms, full, foamy and rocky. Great sudsy lace decorates the interior of the glass.  The aroma has lots to ponder. Lime and orange at first, earthy yeast, spicy, perhaps ginger, a bit of clove and maybe something peppery. Very nice. Not as funky as some.  The beer starts with a bitter hops kick, toasty malt holds it own through to a dry acidic finish and a persistant herbal aftertaste. The beautiful bitterness accompanies the malt all the way. It's medium to full-bodied with a prodigious buzzing carbonation. Very refreshing.  I visited the Ommegang brewery a few years back just after they had been bought by Duvel Moortgat. They give an interesting tour in a nice rural setting - worth a visit if you're in the area.

42,141,GClarkage,4.41,"05/31/05- Purchased at Tower Market in San Francisco, CA  Presentation- 24oz bottle with no dates. Poured into my Duvel tulip.  Appearance- Huge thick poch-marked head. Ultra creamy and thick. Nice golden-orange coloring and excellent lacing.  Smell- Spices, spices and more spices. A very good amount of swwet and sour in the scent as well.  Taste- Damn, this one is a fruit garden. Lots of sweet but sour at the same time flavors. Mainly apple and maybe some melon. Meanwhile, lots of spices as well.  Mouthfeel- Well carbonated, but goes down sooo easy.  Drinkability- Probably the best saison I have encountered from the USA. Still no Fantome, but it's not that far off. Excellent!!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,woemad,4.82,"12oz bottle purchased at Daanen's in Hayden, ID for $2.75. Oddly enough, this was only $0.25 more than a Twilight Ale.  Poured a orange/gold color. Fairly cloudy looking, with a big, thick fluffy white head that took forever to drop, and left luxurious sheets of lace dripping down the insides of my St.Bernardus goblet.  Smell was of sweet malts, grapefruit, spices and a musty earthiness. This smelled absolutely delicious. The sweetness was exquisitly paired with the dry, citrusy grapefruit scent.  The taste measured up to the smell. The earthy, grainy flavor was what I noted first. Then the sweet maltiness and dry, grapefruit flavor pass through, with the citrusy flavor being a little bit stronger. The swallow ends in a crisp dry, grassy note.  As with the greatest homegrown Belgians, the body and carbonation feel just right.  This is a great beer. This could turn out to be the highlight of my recent beer trip to northern Idaho. I really hope this shows up in Huckleberry's soon, though I wouldn't call 40 miles too far to go to get this.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,mmmbeer,4.41,"750 mL, bottle conditioned, corked and caged - served slightly chilled in a goblet. Looks amazing - 3 finger head that is so close to white and pokes out the top of the glass. It is rocky and sticky, leaving big clumps of foam for lace. The body is a hazy orange/amber with a buncha stuff floating around. Aroma is outdoorsy with grapes, white wine, lemons, some tropical fruits, and a big spiciness. It is sharp and spicy on the palate with yeast, lemons, wine, and is kinda dry. It has a very distinct taste that lingers and makes you want more. Smooth and warming with a full body and makes you really burpy. In a class all it's own.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,mynie,4.48,"Pretty! Dark gold like honey honey fizzy and pretty as can be. The head on this is perfect. Best head you can imagine. Wonderful.  Smells like a Belgian. Honey and ripe fruit. Plums aplomb. Little hints of alcohol and spice.  Big spice upfront. Lots of cloves and pepper. Moving into juicy fruits in the middle. Very ripe fruit, but not over ripe. Incredibly tasty. White pepper and more fruit in the middle, and a sweet honey aftertaste. Nice, but a slight metallic taste keeps it from perfection.  This is a world class brew. I had no idea what I was missing out on. Whenever I see a bottle of Hennpin, I'm gonna be picking it up.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,BeerFink,4.5,"Fills my glass cloudy and pale gold in hue, topped by an intimidating white head. Strong aroma involving fruits, bready pale malts, yeast, a little spice, and some citrous hops. Taste is bold and complex. Bready malt jumps out quickly, before bitter lemons and citrous rinds attack the tongue. Some caramel-like sweetness dances with spice, but there is an underlying creaminess. Mouthfeel is pretty full, but crisp carbonation and the zesty hops really blast inside the mouth. Finishes just like it begins, but leaving a very enjoyable long lasting aftertaste with some fruity yeasty character to it. Overall a bitter impression is left on my palate.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,foXXtail,4.17,"Highly drinkable any time of the year, just as a good saison should be. In fact, it's hard to believe this one comes out of New York.  The nose is filled with sweet vanilla and orange backed up by a slight phenol of spice. A hop aroma is present, but only slightly perceptible. A faint alcohol aroma alludes to its presence in the beer to come. The beer pours a hazy golden with a rocky, frothy head which retains &gt; 1 minute. Champagne like bubbles rise forth unabated.  The taste is wonderful. Sweet honey hits first, which quickly makes way for vanilla, citrus and a slight banana. The sour fruit taste is dominant, backed up by a slight hint of spice and coriander. Hop hit is noticeable, especially in the aftertaste, but it does not take over. Alcohol warming is moderate. The beer is aggressively effervescent and medium-bodied.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,cubedbee,4.38,"Served out of a 750 ml bottle into a Duvel glass. Beutiful hazy golden color with a thick off-white head. Smell is delicious --- sweet, fruity, banana bread, yeasty, and even a little peppery. Spices hit up front giving way to a fruity finish--orange mainly but a little lemon and banana too. Mouthfeel is amazing--thick and full bodied, it almost taste like your chewing bread. This is one hell of a beer. Most Belgian styles are a little too intensely spiced for me and not that drinkable--but this one has just the right balance and I could have it all night.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Higravity,4.37,"Not a beer I would drink everyday for the $$, but that being said this was a great beer. Honey gold straw with a white head that became spotty. A hoppy fruity nose of citrus and yeast. Distinct Belgian yeast taste followed by a creamy citrus softness lined with noble hops. Quite a mouthful and deceptive with the high alcohol content.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,twelvsies,4.03,"I had this once a long time ago, before my days of Beer Advocacy, and since then I have overlooked it. I'm excited to try it once again. Appears a very light orange color, almost yellow. Crystal clear... I mean I don't think I've ever seen a beer this clear. Rising bubbles and big white fluffy head that lasts and lasts. Smell is yeasty, bready, zesty, spicy, and dusty. Unfortunately, it's not as dusty and funky in the taste. Not quite a true Belgian in that sense, but it is very good, don't get me wrong. I've recently become obsessed with the best Belgian pale ales, De Ranke XX and Orval specifically. I love that dry, hoppy, grassy taste. I've been searching for a cheaper alternative that is equally satisfying and refreshing, and this is a close one. The taste is nice and hoppy, decently bitter, and with a nice soft buttery malt taste. The dusty taste I like is noticable too, a definate plus. Really smooth mouthfeel and this beer is highly refreshing, which makes it highly quaffable. Really a good beer. Really. I don't know what it is, but there's something about those beers from Belgium that are just indescribable that can't be found elsewhere. This beer is not to be faulted though for not having that quality however. An awesome beer from Cooperstown.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

42,141,palma,3.45,"Nice looking beer. Pale yellow/golden color body with a lasting white head. Yeasty peppery nose with some citrus and vanilla notes. This beer tastes very much like a witbier. Don't know what thats about. Fruity citrus base with some grassiness. A tart sour-like finish. Even though this is a siason, I think it's a little too tart for the style. Big citrus sour aftertaste kind of ruins the complexity of this beer IMO. Finished clean and semi-dry. Not the greatest siason as many BA's have proclaimed it is. Southampton's is much better.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Fluffy little head that's off-white with tan and yellow dimples. Smell - Wow! Very fruity and sweet but balanced with a great hit of yeast and malt. I smell raisins and bananas, yum. It tastes very unlike anything I've had so far. It's sharp and flavorful, full of fruit and malt. Mouthfeel - good full body and a sweet syrupy finish. I feel like I'm eating more than drinking it.  Note - I've tried a couple of Belgian style beers in the past and never been impressed... this has changed my opinion. This may be my favorite beer to date.

A certain spiciness prevails, followed by a quiet citrus quality, quite fruity and refreshing. Mouthfeel is sharp, quite carbonated, nice.  Overall very well crafted, doesn't taste like an American version of a Belgian, it simply tastes like a Belgian, very crisp and tasty, well crafted indeed.

42,141,FLAbeergutinMASS,4.25,"This is not my type of beer, but when I saw it and had read so many positive reviews I decided to give it a try. Comes packaged in a beautiful bottle with champagne style capping. Pours tremendously cloudy with very unsubtle sunset colors. The suggested serving glass call for a wide-mouth glass, (I used a red wine glass) upon pouring a swelling of orange, berries and some serious alcohol infused my nostrils. This beer taste like a summer beer, overloaded with sweetly hops that balance each other. This beer almost transcends beer at its strangest and purest points. A serious beer, but is it really a beer; or should it be in its own category?",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Pours a pale golden color with a constant source of fizz. The HUGE billowy foam cap seems to grow even after the pour is done. Smells fantastic, very spicey, but otherwise difficult to place. Tastes spicey as well, with a hint of a hop bite in the end. Taste seems to morph as the drinker becomes acclimatized and the beer warms. Seems to have a buttery banana ester quality at some point that fades into a funky belgian yeasty clove flavor. I will definitely try other saisons.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

The balance of hops and farmyard funk is truly wonderful, and the aftertaste is very nice as well. It's very thirst-quenching. The mouthfeel is creamy.  Drinkbaility and Overall: Excellent.

Flowery/floury permissiveness on nose with coriander, sweet clover honey, and Kentucky blue grass all chortling around in there; as it warms, alcohol provides some heat. Biting pepper, lemon juice, chewy grape leaf hint, Hi-C fruit punch sweetness follows behind all of this with a finishing overall Sourpatch Kid puckering.

Smell is citrusy, but it's also got some sour musty clove and pear scents in there as well. Taste is interesting. I'm tasting some pear in there as the foremost among the tart flavors, but there's so much to talk about. The citrus matches up nicely with the dryness of the finish and spicy notes. The alcohol is there, but not to the detriment of the flavor; if anything it helphs you notice the dryness of the flavor. Wow, I really dig this one, it's a tart and spicy masterpiece.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,deejaydan,3.47,"Bottle conditioned saison from New York. Hmm... let's give it a go. It pours a pale clear yellow (almost looks like a pale ale/Macro Lager). Not much head on this. Moderate lacing. Smells slightly funky, like outdoors in the spring. Taste is slightly metallic, and slightly sour at the same time. A hint of grassy hops in there as well. Overcarbonated in my book. Not a hit. Not something I'd look for again.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

It feels fizzy, crisp and clean in the mouth, like a saison should.  Drinkability: very quaffable!

The aroma is spritzy with notes of lemon, coriander, ginger, slight herbalness, a certain damp wood-like mustiness. The aroma is quite light and appetizing, and has a nice level of complexity to it.  The taste is lightly sweet up front through the middle, but then becomes quite dry in the finish. This is nice and spicy with competing notes of pepper, ginger, lemon zest, coriander. This beer has a nice soft sweet grain character which mixes quite well with, and in fact even accentuates, the refreshing, cool citrus notes. This beer is very good, it is just about the perfect beer to sit down and enjoy over an evening. The one flaw is that it is perhaps a little to thick in the body, don't get me wrong, it is by no means thick, it is just that I like my farmhouse ales with a nice dry, light palate.

The nose has a yeasty/doughy character up front with bright grapefruit from the hops and a mild candy character from the malt. Very layered and complex. The taste has an awakening tartness followed by a mild bitterness. The play between the sweetness and tartness is very pronounced. Light and slick mouth feel leads to a very drinkable beer.

42,141,karst,4.35,"Only my second attempt at this style (1st Saison - fruity, strong Belgian ale. Amber, medium-bodied, tart character from Belgian yeast. A tap but also in bottles from Schlafly- St. Louis, good but not so complex from this 750 ml corker!) clear light lemmon yellow but later I see a chill haze or some suspended yeast. The bottle conditioning yeast incrusted its neck when incorrectly cellered or transported upside down. Each pour yields a big pufffy white head that has nice retention and produces lacing. Very aromatic- flowery and spices! Almost like a wine fruity esters perceived but not alcohol. Nice aroma. This should be tried with a fine meal.  Still new to style, I have studied Jan/Feb Zymurgy for some details. It is sweetness kept in check with the hops, herbs( coriander) and spices(ginger & orange zest). This ""Grisette"" farmhouse ale really has a earthiness to it. Very unique taste. But very drinkable. This is a light-medium bodied brew. Very good long dry finish.

I'm also picking up banana-ish esters, pepper, candyish fruit malts, and yeast. Yum. Spicy, almost-bitter floral hops up front, that are accenuated with a lively carbonated spritzy feel. Rounds into a yeast-accented malt tang, with the bitterness remaining. Estery fruits and light candy sweetness swell into the finish, which is long, and strong with both sweet fruits/yeast and floral bitterness.

The brew poured to a cloudy golden color with a thick frothy, foamy head that had incredible retention and left chunky lacing through out. The carbonation is very active with a good deal of small (reminds me of champagne) bubbles coursing up the side. This is a very inviting looking beer; something about it just says it looks perfect! The aromas have a pronounced Belgian scent to it from the yeast I would presume (?), very earthy. Scene highlights of pepper, grapes, citrus like hop qualities, and a sweet aroma. Very drinkable brew; somewhat sweet with a fruit (citrus) like taste ending with a balanced hop ness.

Crisp and light, mild fruit (pears and apples) with subtle spice, clean and smooth. Very nice carbonation as well... not overly carbonated, but just enough to be refreshing. No odd flavors, nothing to make you go ""wow!"" or ""huh?"", just an extremely well crafted beer that reminds you that great beer doesn't have to be anything extreme (not that there's anything wrong with extreme beers, and I enjoy my fair share, but Hennepin proves that simple and well-balanced doesn't have to mean boring).",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

A fluffy and frothy bleached white head foams up 3 cm easily. tons of rising streams of bubbles in the glass. Aroma is mild but I get some green apple and pears, a bit of biscuity yeast and some funky musty basement scent. FIrst sip reveals average body and intense prickly carbonation. Carbonation definitely overwhelms the flavor on the first sip. Flavor is light and fruity with some apples and pears just like the nose. A bit of genearl tart fruitiness too. I also get some candy sugar that I find a bit too sweet and slightly unappealing. The flavor of the beer reminds me of champagne just like the appearance did. The beer finishes with some dryness, again champagneesque. OVerall the beer is okay, but if I wanted to drink champagne I would buy a bottle.

Aroma is yeast and some fruit, a hint of bananas, a whisper of citrus and a touch of sweet pepper.  Taste is crisp and refreshing. Sweet malt transitions to some citrus, flowery hops and a blast of alcohol with a sharp hop finish that fades quickly. Quite complex as one expects in the style, but also balanced.

The taste was initially sweet, with some bitterness at the end. Exceptoinal taste, it was balanced almost prefectly with some grassy and citrus undertones.

No freshness or content information.  Pours an ever so slightly cloudy raspberry-tinted gold under a one finger white head that sticks around for a while, particularly after settling to thick film, leaving a few good strands of lace. The nose is full of fruit and malt, with a touch of sweetness reminiscent of good Belgian ales. The mouth is light and very, very prickly. Good smooth if not overpowering taste, with sweet fruit and spices up front, carried by a malt backbone. The finish includes some dry currant bitterness and more bready malt, which rises to dominate the aftertaste. Solid product, no doubt, even if not my favorite style of beer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Citrusy smell, worried that I had made a mistake on this cold winter day.  However, the taste was exceptional. Full mouthfeel, acidic, a fine balance of sweet and bitter, long finish. I tasted pears and hops, alcohol and lemon zest.  This was a refreshing beer that would work well alone or with food. My spouse had just baked some Brie and she loved the pairing. This is one addictive brew. This came from Ommegang's 3-pack which included 750s of Three Philosophers and Rare Vos. I'm traveling this week, so I'll be breaking those out next weekend.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Light-bodied with a plenty of carbonation. Light dry white wine flavors blend wiht an apple flavor and a faint whisper of alcohol. Becomes slightly sweet in the middle and then finishes with a dry, light sweet aftertaste.

Smells of slight phenols, pear, lemon, and a hint of coriander.  A myriad of tastes do a dance on my tongue. Slightly tart with a hint of dry grass and some alcoholic heat. Wee bit of saaz spice, but it's really rather subdued. No noticable funk (yet). There's a good, sweet backbone through it all.  A kick-ass, highly drinkable, relatively affordable domestic saison. We need more beers like this.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Hagbard,4.33,"Pours from the 750 ml. bottle a hazy orange. It's very murky even after a careful pour, identifying the beer as bottle conditioned in case you can't read the label. A large white head rushes to fill the space in my tulip glass. The head recedes leaving a rocky terrain of foam with lacing down the sides of the glass. The first aroma is a wet musty closet...very interesting. There's some fruitiness in the background, but it is kept at bay by the musty funk. The taste is wet blanket (cliche, I know, but still true), with oranges and apples mushed in. As the beer sits on the tongue and sails into the finish, a pronounced hop bitterness appears. Finishes fairly dry and is very drinkable. This is a great tasting beer, one I will buy often. A great example of a Saison that hold up very well when compared to Saison Dupont (the flagship of the style IMO). At $4.99 for a 750 ml., it's really a no brainer!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,BruceBeerman,4.08,"750ml corked bottle. Color is hazy very light straw. Nice Saison which is hard to believe it came from the US and not Belgium. Very citrus and orange flavor ale. The carbonation is very good-not too much or little, with a finger size foam lace at the top of a goblet. The mouthfeel is good with very slowly disapating foam. Very easy to drink but has a little alcohol kick to it. You can feel it as you drink (7% ABV) but you really feel it as it hits your head. Some beers have a delayed alcohol reaction-not this one. Don't drink on an empty stomach. This is a great beer to share with friends! My wife even liked it!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Dukeofearl,3.9,"Pours a cloudy, light-medium golden color with a frothy white head. Aroma is very pleasant, with fresh, clean, citrusy notes (lime & sweet orange), a little musty. Flavor follows through the aroma, with yeasty, slightly sharp off-notes (I can't place what) that keep this from being in my top 10. This beer has a lot of hidden carbonation- I was gassy for a while after this one (sorry to have to share that, but you should know just in case!).  However, I still think this a good, solid brew that I would enjoy having again.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Billolick,4.25,"I was happy to track down bottle # 1127 from the 2003 vintage at American Bev. in Cobble hill, Brooklyn, NY., Just a week or two ago. The cork was a bit tougher to get out then usual. Pours a cloudy orange/yellow shade, lots of tiny yeast particles floating around. Head was fairly active, but settled to a fine film, and leaves respectable, fine, long strands of lacing. Nose is at once Smokey,spicy, with pepper,cloves, and ginger picked up. This is a fine example of the style. Earthy, peppery, fruits,smoke,yeast. Hops cleansing the tongue and making it want more of this fine heady creation. Support Ommegang, they are pushing the Belgian/American brew concept into great places.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,maltomeal,4.32,"To quote the bros: ""One of our favourites, bring a couple of 750 ml bottles to the dinner party and see if this sparks anyones interest away from wine"" It worked. I brought 3 bottles to Christmas dinner and only had 2 glasses for myself. Beautiful white head that lasted forever. My brother-in-law noted it looked like an ice cream float. He put down his drink and had several glasses with dinner which is where this beer really shines in my opinion. It was a perfect match for the stuffed ribs and garlic mashed.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,bigbeerdrinka,4.23,Pours a beautiful rapunzel like golden color with a massive rocky white head. Aromas are yeasty and citrusy with just a hint of lemon in the mix. Initial flavors start off sweet and spicy with a champagne like mouthfeel from the firm carbonation. The flavors progress to a lemony like citrus flavor with yet more spice and a slight alcohol kick to it. The finish to this brew is just as spritzy as the beginning with an almost clove like finish. Overall a fantastic brew with probably the best price around.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,beerattorney,4.31,"Pours a golden straw color with a healthy pure white head. In typical saison style this beer smells very grassy and farmish. It is exceptionally well balanced and hides its substantial alcohol very well. The aroma is a grassy banana and the taste complements with rolling mellow flavors. In my opinion, the mouthfeel of the Hennepin makes the entire experience. The beer is perfectly carbonated and delivers the perfect balance of earthy flavors, yeast, and CO2 to make this a delightful treat that is at home in any season.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,GCBrewingCo,4.2,"The beer poured slightly hazy pale golden straw. The head was white and frothy and rose tall to fall slowly and eventually coat the glass from top to bottom.  The aroma was of sweet malt with an earthy presence, Belgian yeast and some farmhouse ale aromas. After the head fell back the fruity esters emerged and added to the aroma.  The flavor was sweet immediately upon hitting the tip of the tongue but quickly transformed into a very nice bittering component. The sweet malt and bittering worked well together and then Belgian yeast spiciness and a slight farmhouse quality emerged. A decent complexity of flavors.  The finish was dry with a nice lasting bittering component. The body was medium light. The alcohol content was hidden somewhere and never made an impression, not in aroma, flavor or finish.  750 ml bottle, corked and bailed. Overall a well made Saison, with a slight bit more complexity this could be a contender, with the price it certainly could be one to have again and again.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Shultzerdugen,4.8,"75 cl bottle. I can hardly believe this beer is made in NY! Cloudy, dark straw copper, but the cloudy was most likely yeast stirred up during transportation. Impressive, chunky head. Very complex smell: apples, apricot, citrus, malt, horse blanket, alchohol. What a great taste. This ale compares more than favorably with Begium brews. I had it back to back with Delirium Tremens and was surprised with Hennepin's well balanced hoppiness and smooth malt character. And at roughly $5 a bottle, it is about the best beer bargain I can think of.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,ColForbin,4.67,"I'm drinking the first release of cave aged Hennepin from 2001, bottle #2825 of 3360 in celebration of the birth of my beautiful daughter Sadie.  The cork was very hard to get out, but when it went it went with an audible pop. It pours a golden orange with a huge white head that fades to a 0.5cm coating on the top of the beer. The aroma is floral, spicy (coriander and clove) with strong hints of orange peel. Taste is spicy, slightly sour, hoppy and pergaps a bit of clover honey. Slightly slick mouthfeel, with a warming alcohol finish. Extremely smooth and drinkable, and seems to have mellowed with its time in the cave and the cellar. A great celebratory drink and if you can find the 2001 edition, you'll be happy you did.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,rlcoffey,3.73,"Poured from a 750 ml corked bottle into a brandy snifter. Nice light orange color with a solid two finger orange head. Very good appearance. A strong aroma of hops and fruit. Pleasant to the nose. The taste had a good subtle flavor of the citrusy fruits, mostly orange, and hops but seemed to be lacking a little of something. Mouthfeel was what I was expecting for the style, no residue left behind. Alcohol was high to be overly drinkable and its probably the wrong time of the year for this beer. I will definately be getting this for sipping on the deck next summer.  This was my first saison, it is a style I have just never bothered to try. I will be trying more in the future. This is the second Ommegang beer I have had that didnt live up to its hype. But, in this case, Im not sure there is anything necessarily wrong, I just may not know the style well enough. Yet. Will review my scores after I am more knowledgable.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,longarm,4.41,"Rarely does a beer live up to the hype. Does this one?  Color is an opaque yellow typical of bottle conditioned brews. Before this, I've had vague preconceptions of the definition of lacing...now I know. Craggy valleys of foam dissipate into defined and semi-permanent designs clinging to the side of the glass.  Smells like oranges with light hops and moderate alcohol. Some noticeable spices, but at first these are hard to pin-down.  ...and then the sip. Unbelievable complexity washes over the tongue in continuous waves of orange and a host of spices. Is that cardamom, cloves, mace or maybe all three? What amazes me most is how the spices don't overwhelm the beer, which remains unpretentious in spite of its complexity.  This certainly lived up to expectations. I'm already looking forward to the next time I get to have one.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Jacobier10,4.57,"Poured from a 750 mL bottle into an Ommegang goblet that I got for free along with the purchase of this bottle...KICK ASS! Golden and orange with a huge, two-finger, fluffy head. Citrusy hop aroma filled with lemon, orange, grapefruit, and flowers. Very pleasant. Great taste. A little on the acidic side, but the hops really play against each other very well. A very drinkable beer that I will most definitely be purchasing again though I prefer the regular Ommegang to this.  Update (4/12/05): Just had Hennepin on-tap @ The Elephant Walk in Boston, MA. Amazing. The aroma really came out more than before . Very citrusy. It was also dangerously drinkable. Served in a pint glass, but I'll let it slide because it just means I got more bang for my buck. And what a bang it was! (Insert dirty response here).",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Troyone,4.15,"Purchased in a bottle with a cork, the label says that this is a Grisette farmhouse ale (Belgian-style) that is bottled conditioned with a dose of yeast. After removing the cage the cork popped (with a bang) off after one turn. The beer poured in the glass with a three inch head that stuck to the sides.The color is a very hazy blond with the evidence of carbonation activity. The smell is a lemon sweet with hints of wheat. The taste is a crisp slightly caramel lemon wheat that has significant carbonation. The mouthfeel has carbonation with an even smoothness throughout in taste, drinking, aftertaste, and even when belching. The drinkability is good, the after taste does not linger and dissipates in time.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,gentlebubbles,3.91,"Bottle-conditioned. 750 ml bottle.  Brilliant gold with enthusiastic bubbles streaming up to meet the huge fluffy white head. The head dies down into clumps while throwing off a bracing floral scent, a very young scent, almost grassy, like newly hewn stems. As the head dies, it shifts to more of a funky, almost sweaty, sweet-corn aroma.  Sticky streamers and spots hang on the glass as you drink. The mouth fills with a lively foam, and yet the bubbles are very tender for such an active carbonation. Tones of apple, as crisp as biting into fresh slices of Granny Smiths. That sweaty funk takes on a curiously ""hot"" tone. Hints of pepper in the finish, with the sweet alcohol of apple cider. As the sweetness dies, there's a strange salty rebound.  For such a weird mix of likes and dislikes, it's quite light and goes down way too easy.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,HardTarget,4.37,"750 ml corked and caged bottle. No date, cellared in my closet for about 2 years. Aroma: Nice Belgian banana yeast aroma with some apricot, grape and pepper. Appearance: Hazy golden blond with a moderate covering of clumpy white head. Flavor: A touch of farmyard funky with great fruit flavor. Lemon rind, grapes and yeast predominate. Its a straightforward taste with the fruit and funk melding nicely; enjoyable. Mouthfeel: Lively carbonation, but not fizzy. Clean mouthfeel that leaves the taste to linger but a crisp finish. Fairly light body. Overall Impression: Easy drinking Belgian! Light in style, simple and direct, but a nice flavor. A very approachable Saison, I could see this with fish or a light meal. A good summer quencher but a bit alcoholic for a session; highly recommended.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,dgallina,4.6,"Pours a cloudy gold with a gigantic creamy white head and non-stop lace. Nose is predominantly fruity, spicy, and complex. Great mix of flavors that start off sweet and fruity but quickly develop tart notes and finish dry and spicy. Medium-weight and slightly creamy mouth-feel. Extremely easy to drink. Hard to believe that this is a 7.5% ABV Saisson.  This bottle was far better than the bottle of Saisson Dupont I sampled last month...",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,rajendra82,4.22,"The beer came in a 12 oz. brown bottle with lots of useful information (like how to pour this beer, and what kind of glass to use) and some trivia (like origins of the name, and some tidbits about Belgian culture). When poured in my trusty goblet, the beer looked marvelous with clear, pale golden body, and an outrageously sized head that tried my patience as I could only get half of the bottle into the 16 oz. glass. As the head died down, there was tons of lace left behind. The smell was delicately floral, spicy, earthy, and fruity, with bananas, saffron, pepper, and horse blanket evident. The taste was tart and sweet, with flavors of lemon, banana, beet sugar, orange peel, and radishes. The aftertaste was spicy and semi-dry, and left me longing for more. Thin and delicate mouthfeel is a bit dusty. This beer has very good drinkability and offers a good value for the money. I will be sampling more beers from them again.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Light and lively in my mouth, and scent of esthers becomes very strong when imbibing. Aftertaste is like the scent, begs a second drink. Saccharine if left without a swig too long, but absolutely divine when I am drinking. Just at the edge of my palate skills at identifying tastes, it is extremely fun and interesting. Brilliant and exciting.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

42,141,Quaffer,4,"25.4 oz. Bottle. Corked and caged.  Appearance: Hazy, pale yellow with a large white head. The foam was spiderweb-like and dissipated quickly for its size. Some light fingers of lace were left behind. A rough pour on the second glass yielded a head that was denser and had more staying power.  Smell: At first, all heavy, corny sweetness and not overly enjoyable. However, after awhile, some hops and a little spicy yeast emerged to save the aroma.  Mouthfeel: Thin-bodied but with some chewiness. Smooth, with light hints of carbonation tickle.  Taste: Pretty straightforward flavor. All sweet malt, yeast, and floral and herbal hops. Both the bitterness of the hops and the sweet malt continued long into the aftertaste, where the yeast gained strength.  A good beer, but nothing to write home about.  A big thanks to noclueaboutbeer for hauling this one out to Kansas all the way from Connecticut.  --10/29/04 Update--  This beer showed a lot more complexity on the second sample of it that I had today. This was from a smaller, 12 oz. bottle with a nip cap.  The aroma had more depth, with smells of fruit ranging from grapes to apples and an underlying layer of vanilla that added a lot of warmth to the brew.  The beer came across as fuller bodied, but it dried out just the right amount at the end. It was still malty and hoppy as I stated above, but it seemed to have more of a raw grain quality to it. A nice, light fruitiness was present, and the hops were rather subdued. They just balanced out the beer and gave it the right amount of spiciness.  I was much more impressed with this beer the second time around. I boosted my ratings accordingly.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Appearance is a golden color, with a frothy white head on top. Excellent sticky lacings cling all over the goblet. The head stays in form as I enjoy this beer.  Aroma of pepper, herbs and spice.  Taste has a nice complex feel to it. Highlights include a strong belgian yeast profile and honey sweetness on the finish. Lemon or lime zing flavors blend with peppery bite. Pressured carbination effect with bubbles tingle the tongue.  Very tasty and enjoyable beer. Excellent drinkability at 7.5 % ABV. Ommegang nails every Belgian influenced style beer that I've had. Check this beer out....recommended.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,NearerMyBeerToMe,4.25,"Note: 12 oz. bottle. Pours with a rich pillow of snow-white head with a bead as tight as shaving cream. A swirl of the goblet sends the foam into a little galactic spiral. Lazy cling, o.k. lacing. Beer is peach chrome in color with honey-colored highlights and enough yeast haze to make the carbonation just barely visible. Smells involve peach pie filling, cinnamon sugar cookies, beeswax and clover. A twist of saffron and the perfume of shredded violets round out a cool, floral, humid nosefeel. Fresh ginger flavors dominate over the sweetness of ladyfingers in the front palate. Must, straw, and alcohol are incorporated into perfectly level transitions between fruit and spice before ending with a well-hopped, bitter finish of fruit pits that sticks the tongue to the roof of the mouth. Burps of red delicious apple appear by the time I'm reaching for my second bottle. Mouthfeel is lightly viscous with a calciferous, magazine-paper slickness and a sharp, tingling POW! of carbonation high on the tongue. At room temperature, drinkability soars... knocking off a 750 should be a piece of cake. This is like drinking a summer picnic out of a glass.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,RockyTopHeel,4.4,"Bold, bright, and golden in color with a substantial, pillowy white head and rather furious carbonation, Hennepin looks very nice, and its aromas reached my nose almost instantly as I poured the brew. Yeast, hay, and a soft sweetness wafted into my nostrils before I took my first sip, which revealed more dry, farmhouse elements in the taste, as well as an almost surprising alcoholic twinge.  More elements - some herbal, some peppery, some light citrus, and others - emerged as I continued drinking. This is wonderfully complex, very drinkable, and thoroughly enjoyable.  I'm a sucker for saisons, and this is an excellent one.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Left my mouth with a light coating, highly drinkable, undoubtedly would be good with a variety of foods. The alcohol content may sneak up on you.

Poured out of the bottle with a generous 2 1/2 inch head into a chalice. Nice semi-cloudy golden tone underneath. The head took forever to dissapate, and when it finally did it left behind a nice sticky lacing that stayed throughout the drinking.  The smell was a little musty. Behind the must came honey, and citrus appeal with an obvious phenol tinge.  The taste was bitey on the first sip, alcohol was predominate. The rest of the bottle went down very smooth, leaving a orange-cream taste. Doesn't get astringent toward the bottom as the Rare Vos can. Pretty good, but just a little bit yeasty.  The mouth was excellent. Nice and rich with good carbonation, goes down VERY smooth and left me refreshed.  Drinkability is great, although I may want to space it out a little more next time as I may have finished the last 2 glasses a little quick.

Honey sweet malt notes, some red licorice candy-like sweetness with a citrusy, peppery, and botanical (heather and lemongrass) nose. Initially sweet and floral, like an orange blossom, and then moving towards a more bitter, hoppy finish while still maintaining a general sweetness, overall. Good carbonation. Very complex, in aroma and taste.

This beer is an absolutely incredible match for Humboldt Fog cheese, which is an aged goat cheese. Together, they are better than the sum of their parts. I'm trying to be objective with my ratings, trying to rate the beer as it stands on its own. But if I was rating my experience with this cheese and beer together, you would see a 5 for taste, mouthfeel, and drinkability.  As it is this is a great beer. Poured with a nice head.

Smell: peppery citrus on the front, followed by a sourdough yeastiness and closing on a fresh whiff of lemongrass and cotton candy. Big, bright nose.  Taste: opens with a heavy nudge of bitter sweetness (grapefruit rind) deep in the center of my palate, and spreads out with a fruity (raisins, plums, cherries) chewy maltiness. The taste closes on a slight hint of alcohol in my throat and a bitterness that hums along pleasantly -- like blunted pepper corn -- on the sides and back of my palate.  Mouthfeel is creamy without getting in the way.

Not a huge towering head like the Ommegang had, but it also hung around longer.  Grainy aroma, bit of a honey smell in there, and something a little spicy in the background. Real mild flavor, kind of an earhty flavor to it, with a bit of a citrus flavor in there, perhaps? A bit of a lemon, and a bit of that same spicy flavor from the aroma, I'm thinking pepper now. A tad thicker feel to it, and very crisp. Also makes me think a bit of bread or biscuit dough, for some reason.  Very nice, smooth, drinkable beer. I've never had a Saison before, so I don't know if this is characteristic of the style or not. I'd been told by people before that the Hennepin was favored over the Ommegang, and I definitelly echo their sentiments. A very, very good brew.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

42,141,poundboy,3.93,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a english style pint glass(yes I realize a chalice or goblet would be better, but I'd rather spend my limited funds on beer and homebrewing supplies than fancy glassware)  Appearance: Golden/straw with a hint of copper. A slow, tilted pour produced about an inch of head which lingered, at least in part until finished.  Smell: I don't have the best smeller in the world, so its hard to say. I noted sweet fruit and yeast smells. Undertones which betray its relatively high ABV.  Taste: This may be blasphemy, but about all I can say is it tasted like a belgian. Most beer geeks, I think, will know what I mean. Mild hops behind a distinct sweetness. Ample carbonation influencing the favor, and that distinct, fruit like yet hard to describe belgian yeast charcter. This beer is saison, but to me you could put it next to a Belgian pale and I (at least) wouldn't be able to tell the difference. Which doesn't necessarly mean that you wouldn't be able to. However, I very much enjoy belgian brews, hence the high marks.  Mouthfeel: High marks here. more viscous than I expected for a beer this light in color, with a pleasant bubblyness as it rolls down your tongue.  Drinkability: Very drinkable. Mine went down about as quick as a good lager. The sweetness might be too much after a few, but by then, the 7.5 ABV should be slowing you down anyway (or perhaps barking at the moon)",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,CortexBomb,4.13,"Pours out a deep hazy golden orange but the thin head that it began with decided to take a sabbatical after a minute or two. Nose is of a non-descript yeasty / wheaty variety, I mean, it's there unlike cheap beers, but it doesn't exactly leap out of the glass at you either.  and this non-descript aspect completely ends when it comes to the taste, which is stupendous and deep. Up front you get a delightfully tingly sensation on the end of the tongue, like sour citrus, and then a gentle hop bitter begins on the back. The wheat and yeast from the nose take front and centre, along with a spicy tinge (pepper? cloves?) that whirls around in the mouth amidst all of this.  The entire presentation is only aided by the delightfully full mouthfeel, I'm not talking thick like a stout, just very bubbly, and pleasant, this is the first non-viscuous beer that I've given a full 5.0 on mouth to, but Hennepin earned it, with ease. The drinkability on this stuff is also excellent.  Overall I would term this beer shocking. The appearance and smells really offer no hint to the treat that is hidden in the flavour and mouth. A pleasure, I'll certainly be having it again.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,NEhophead,4.43,"Thick, foamy 1"" head. Very noticeable carbonation. A glowing, pale orange in color. Layers of standard belgian lacing throughout the glass.  Citrus (lemon/orange) esters with a clove-like spiciness. The spiciness carries the aroma. The aromatics are noticeable but quite mellow.  Orange and lemon flavors at first that give way to an active clove spiciness. A sourness is present that doesn't overpower the ale's other flavors. Plenty of carbonation that cuts through the sourness and balances it well.  Light and crisp on the palate. Very dry aftertaste. Maybe a tad too carbonated.  A session saison! Light, crisp, and refreshing. The abv% is up there and well hidden.  A top notch saison. Exactly what you would expect from Ommegang. This is one to enjoy and recommend to a friend.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,rugger,4.08,"This was truly an enjoyable experience, and to top it off this is something that I can get in my area for $8.75 for a 4 pk. The nice orangy color and nice thick white head were promising and the smell was nice an yeasty like you would expect from a belgian brew, and then the taste was very smooth at first and then moves to a well rounded sweetness that can only be described as mana from the beer gods. This was very drinkable and I really enjoyed hanging onto the lovely aftertaste of this brew. One of my new favorites.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,beals,4.75,"Impressive... I actually thought it was a true Belgian until I read the label more carefully. Poured smoothly out of a 750ml colorfully-labelled bottle into a tulip glass. Golden color and thick, almost sticky white head. Bouquet was everything a belgian should be - fruity and rich. Smooth taste, hint of nuttiness, just an incredible brew. It was about 85 degrees last night, and this was the perfect beer for such a warm summer evening. Worth every penny.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Hefe,4.67,"Tasted on 7/22/04 from 12oz bottle.  Appearance: Pale gold and slightly hazy, poured with a half inch head that slipped down to more thana little sticky lacing.  Smell: A riot of aromas, sweet and tart. Candied orange, apricot, wildflower honey, yeast, banana, spice.  Taste: Yeasy right up front, malty underplay, with touches of peach and spice. A whisper of floral hops on the finish.  Mouthfeel: Delicate carbonation, light to medium body, crisp on the finish.  Drinkability: Nigh unto perfection. Righteous!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Bruiser81,4.13,This brew pours a hazy golden color with a a huge rocky head. Lacing slowly slides down the sides of the glass but doesn't stick. Sharp looking beer. The aroma smells like fresh hay along with lots of pale and sweet malt. Mild floral hop aromas dance around the edge of the nose. Small amounts of citrus. The fresh hay aroma carries over to the taste as the first flavor to become noticed. This is accompanied by a bready taste. A slight hop flavor creeps up on the finish with slight citrus notes. A solid malt flavor runs through the whole beer. The mouthfeel is medium-full and goes down smooth. A very drinkable beer. To bad is not available here.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Vipsanius,4.54,"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a Hennepin glass. Has a pale golden color, lighter than most Belgian Ales, with a large white head that quickly dissipates with decent but not really pronounced lacing (had more on the second glass).  The smell is an absolutely wonderful floral and citrus smell that mimics some of the best Belgian ales of this type.  The taste is a whirlwind of flavors that hits the palate and lasts a very LONG time after the last sip. It starts with hints of lemon, orange, honey, and ends with a pronounced herbal aftertaste.  The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth with slight carbonation. Mind you this is my first review ever and the term ""chewy"" is still new to me...but I kind of feel a sensation of wanting to chew on this beer...hard to explain but I imagine this is what they are talking about when using this term.  This is a very drinkable beer. I could drink this everyday during the summer. Even though this is made in NY, I think this beer could easily hold it's ground against some of the best Belgian ales of this style.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,maccroz,4.4,"Not too shabby. This is a dary cloudy beer with all sorts of crazy flavors. I, like many others am exercising my right as a Georgian to buy beer &gt; 6.0% alcohol this week. Hennepin was one of the first.  This beer definitely has some kick to it, but it rewards with a very mellow, almost banana like aftertaste. Very yummy. Unlike other high alcohol brews, this one goes down smooth. If you can find this gem available in your area, I'd suggest that you try it.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Dithyramb,4.65,"750 mL brown bottle purchased at Chesapeake Wine Company in Canton for $5. Chilled on ice for a half hour, and enjoyed during a winning softball game.  Appearance: Poured into a tulip glass. Big, thick, frothy white head. Great retention. Lacing throughout. Color reminded me of liquid caramel. Lots of carbonation.  Smell: Big yeast smell right off the bat, kept reminding me of the smell of the Baltimore Brewing Company on brewing day... Followed by banana, grapefruit, and spices.  Taste: Tingly carbonation. The caramel color didnt disappoint when the flavors come rushing in. This baby has thick malty flavors; nice and sweet mix. Some pepper and very faint hops on the back end. This is a very crisp and enjoyable beer. A slight warmth is felt in the mouth after the first swig or two.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Oooh very so. Hennepin has a very heavy mouthfeel with the malty flavors sticking around for a very long time afterward. Although this isnt a beer that I would pound, or have every day, it is very drinkable and worth many more samples.  Ive always felt that saison beers were more of a late summer/fall beer. That spicy mix is usually for the cooler weather. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that Hennepin worked well in the sun and the warmth. That creamy smoothness is very enjoyable, even when sampled in-between innings.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,ramrod666,4.55,"hennepin pours a cloudy honey color with a huge cloudlike head that is an off white. lacing is heavy. smell is white grapes, ginger and citrus (orange peel?). flavor is complex, dry with a light alcohol note. can taste something fruit-like but can't put my finger on it....i'm new to the style. a terrific beer though can really taste ginger and corriander. spicey. mouthfeel is almost fuzzy with plenty of carbonation. could drink a couple but definatly not a session beer. i ain't no rockafella. $9.00 a bottle but worth it. definatly happy that i bought this brew.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,studentofbeer,4.92,"Poured into my ommegang goblet from a 750ml bottle. The beer is a light yellow through light and a pretty light honey orange most of the time. A fluffy white head, 2-fingers or so fluffs up in the glass and drops to a nice 1/8th inch or so coating that lasted the entire beer.  Smell is fantastic--earthy, mud, wet hay, barnyard, leather, honey and fresh herbs. incredibly complex and satisfying. this is one of the rare beers i just want to keep smelling, forget drinking it.  But drink I must, and the taste doesn't lower the bar at all. Sweet bread, honey and a soft fruitiness hit the tongue first, then a mix of herbs and yeasty spicyness punch through, followed by a soft flavor of wet grass and earth. The bitter earthiness follows in the aftertaste combined with a candy sugar sweetness.  The well-carbonated brew comes off creamy, especially because of that soft head. A 750ml goes down so incredibly smooth, I could drink another 750 if I didn't know better. In my opinion this is a beer approaching perfection, and it's amazing to think it's brewed in the US. There's no way to even guess this isn't a traditional Saison from Belgium, and it would rank near the top of any beers in the category, no matter the geography.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,RocketWidget,4.58,"Enjoyed immediately after a sample of regular Hennepin for comparisons sake. Comes in a 750ml corked bottle. Has a layer of dirt on the bottle. Bottle #1471, this was cave-aged at Howe Caverns at a depth of 156 feet at constant temperature of 52 degrees Fahrenheit from early 2003 until September 23rd of the same year. Enjoyed 6/21/04. Claims to be the only American brewery that has been cave aging beer in over a century. Cork appears to have mold on the top, a little worrisome This is one of the most carbonated beers Ive ever had, with tremendous head and unrelenting carbonation. This beer is alive. Incredibly thick, foamy, lacy white head that explodes out of the bottle. Let me stress this point. The head of the beer continues to expand minutes AFTER pouring. Absolutely incredible. I had trouble keeping this beer in its glass! A golden color, less cloudy than the regular beer, but more carbonated. I wanted to believe that the extra few bucks I spent on a cave aged beer would be worth it. Truth be told, although subtle, there is a difference. Smell is a little more pronounced, though has the same characteristic orange smell. Taste is outstanding. Extremely smooth, with a slight hoppy taste and lots of spice, orange and citrus. Unbelievably smooth for its ABV, this beer distinguishes itself as one of the best Belgian beers in America, and would put up a impressive fight in a Belgium itself. This beer kicks ass, and Im proud to say it.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,waughbrew,3.68,"Dortmunder Gold in color, very clear, big head, great retention and lacing but a bit soap-sudsy with big bubbles. Aroma is very faint and of spicy pickles. Flavor is very polished - fruit esters are banana and cherry with huge carbonation that annoys me. Verrry drrry. Malt is non-existant, could be all sugar for all I can tell. This beer is just fizz on the tongue and then leaves a little flavor there that is esters and spice. Not as much ginger as I remember. Struck me as Unibrouish and triplish, but not worthy of either really. This is a well-made effervescent creation, but fails to inspire me.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,watermelonman,4.28,"This has a great glow to its dark golden color. The head and lace seem thin but are still really nice.  It looks, smells, and tastes really nice. This is one tasty beer. It has a lot in common with my favorite Belgian strong pale ales, but with a different kick in the taste.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,BuckeyeNation,3.62,"I gave Hennepin a very careful pour, unlike my usual, because of the nasty looking stuff in the bottom of the bottle. The beer itself is significantly hazy, bright banana-amber with a handful of fine particulates and a generous amount of carbonation. The very nearly pure white head started out small thanks to the gentle pour, fell quickly to thin film and is leaving very little lace.  The nose is fruity, spicy, faintly alcoholic and reminds me, somewhat, of a Belgian tripel. The flavor is definitely interesting, but doesn't bowl me over. It's malty, fruity (apples, pears, golden raisins) sour and clove spicy.  The body/mouthfeel is light and well-carbonated and the finish is long with a trace of sweetness. There's also a hint of alcohol that it isn't the least bit intrusive. It does pack a bit of a punch, but then 7.5% on an empty stomach usually does.  Hennepin is my first saison so I really have no idea whether it's a good version of the style or not. For all I know it could be great beer. My suspicion is that this bottle is a little on the old side, so I'll re-review when I get the chance.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,garthwaite,4.18,"Pours a cloudy yellowish with a perfectly white head. Aroma of citrus & spice. All kinds of flavors competing for attention - earthy hops, spice, belgian yeasts, & mildly sour lemon. They all mesh well together in this heavily carbonated brew that finishes with fruity orange, a bit of yeast, & a flavor that reminds me of wheat. Extremely drinkable & an absolute steal for the price.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Hunter,3.92,"Chimay-like presentation, in a 750 ml bottle with cork stopper and wire cage. Label lists Hennepin as a Belgian-style ale. Provides some interesting tidbits about Belgium and how to pour properly. Couldn't find a bottling date.  Pours clear, cider-like gold with heavy carbonation. The head is dense and white, breaking down fairly quickly despite the large bubbles moving from the base of the glass to replenish it. Revives readily upon agitation.  Aromas of citrus, hops, and that candi sugar distinctive to the style. Agitation brings out some alcohol and floral notes. Nice and inviting.  Carbonation is evident on the tongue, to the point of scouring the taste buds. The alcohol gives a certain heat to the flavor that takes away from the smoothness of the moutfeel. Hops are in the forefront, middle, and end of every swallow. As the glass warmed I went from large gulps to smaller sips. The harshness of the alcohol gives way in the warming, taking a back seat to an odd but pleasant mix of flavors: lemongrass, sugar, fresh hops and white wine.  Finishes clean, with a lingering smack of wine and hops on the lips. I sampled this on its on but imagine it would be a fine compliment to poultry or fish. Given the ABV food might not be a bad idea, as halfway through the bottle I got quite warm.  An admirable expression of the style. Not a bad substitute for Chimay, particularly when you're light on funds (the Hennepin bottle was a full $3 cheaper than the least expensive Chimay). I'll come back to this one.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,WetCoaster,4.77,"Appearance: Very cloudy (my fault, stored incorrectly) deep sunshine yellow with a small, pure white head. (Again, I've served it a bit too cold). Thin lacing.  Smell: Very strong lemon/lime citrus aroma with sweet, almost butterscotch undertone and notes of honey. Very unusual and quite nice.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Fan-freakin'-tastic. Starts sweet with some herbal/medicinal notes, but quickly cuts to a unique bourbon/overripe fruit/malt sweetness; it tastes a bit like Yukon Jack. Tarts up nicely at the finish with a terrific citrus zing--you'll find yourself looking for the lemon slice floating in the glass. The mouthfeel is tight and crisp, with lively, brisk carbonation--very refreshing.  Drinkability: Exceptional, and amazingly light and crisp for a 7.5% ABV brew. I'd be honored to drink another, and I might just.  Now, THIS is a summer brew. Full, complex, satisfying, yet still wonderfully refreshing. A perfect example of the style, really couldn't be much better.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,TheLongBeachBum,4.53,"Cave Aged: Bottle #1315  Presentation: Standard looking 750ml Hennepin bottle, which is deceptive at first and may fool the uninitiated. But on closer inspection, this is no ordinary bottle. The wire cage has a weathered and crimpled looking gray cardboard tab that states that this Hennepin is one of 3360 cellared at Howe Caverns at a depth of 156 feet at a constant temperature of 52°F from early 2003 until September 23rd 2003.  Hand applied Red Ink Stamp professes Bottle # 1315.  The gold colored cage encases a thumbed champagne cork that has an aged black spotted surface (from the Cave Aging?) and it takes a little coaxing to remove. When it is extracted, a solid but manageable thrupp precedes a whispy phantom like expulsion of twisting light gray gunsmoke.  Appearance: Fantastic pour, carefully slaked into my Westie Glass (only the best!) the hazed Golden body shimmered as it slid effortlessly down the hyperbolic sides of my pristinely clean and recently rinsed Westvleteren Glass all the time releasing its dissolved carbon dioxide to form a head that rolled back on itself forming a beery surf. A lovely shimmering straw colored haze sits in the fusel gold body that is disrupted only by constant rising streamers once it quickly settles. The head is perfectly silky and forms an immaculately uniform bone-white creamy cap. Gently rolled like a fine Brandy in the Westie Goblet, the dissolved carbonation comes out to play, but only for a short time, as it is soon called back by its Head-master. This has one of those perfect heads that easily forms with a careful top-up each time. Solid web-like lacing on the Goblets edge. Excellent conditioning, even better head retention, and a fantastic overall presentation in a Goblet style glass. Top Marks here!  Nose: Perceptible from the off, fresh Tripel-like hoppiness mixed with yeasts and freshly proved dough odor that has a little clean farmyard funkiness to it. Light spices and a citrus element together with a smidgeon of Coriander. Mmmmm, smells great, I may have to imbibe this one through my nose!  Taste: Soft, fluffy entrance allows the bitter hoppy feel to expand readily. Pale malts are in the background, light alcohol feel, slightly warming on subsequent mouthfuls. Lemon rind and coriander in the middle, spicy hops with a delicate farmyardiness (yes its a made up word) and some more flavored spicy bitterness in the warming finish which gently caresses the stomach with a smooth frictional like heat after a glass or two. Tangerine rises in the back end with some citric bitterness.  Mouthfeel: This has a well attenuated smoothness from the fine carbonation. Talcum powder soft on the tongue with a light rasping feel when swallowed. Superb presence, this has a very mature Tripel mouthfeel.  Drinkability: The whole 750ml went down quicker than the Titanic! A whole three-quarters of a litre of this 7.5% beauty all to myself  My Bad! Oh Yeah - Sheer Indulgence!  Overall: Very nice!! The precise effects of Cave-Aging are argued over it seems, it could well be the equivalent of modern day Fuzzy Logic. I am no expert on the Aging process, except that I may have to look forward to gray pubes and bad eyesight one day, but this is certainly a beer that definitely appears to benefit from Aging in a Cave (see how diplomatic I am!).  I make no apologies for admitting that I am a big fan of Brouwerij Ommegangs offerings, they still represent probably the best value for money widely available, high quality Belgian style US brews around for me. I am not sure what I did to deserve this beautiful, and rather prized, rare bottle as a gift - but a very BIG heartfelt Thank You indeed to djgonzalez and RokotGirl for sparing this gift from their stash during a recent trip to NYC. It was much appreciated and highly enjoyed. Ill have to get to NYC more often - the first beer in the Blind Tiger is on me next time!!!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

42,141,Dubblebock,3.91,"Extra kudos to the Hennepin folks for putting out a really cool label with this beer. Informative and interesting, the label gives background on Cooperstown, lists some of the local tourist attractions, and provides some insight to the beer itself. Good job. I had almost as much fun perusing the label as I did drinking the brew.  It's almost summer here in Tejas now, and it's time to break out some of these spring/summer offerings. Hennepin is a saison, light in texture and heavy on the spritz. It broke out of the bottle with gusto, like Craig Biggio getting out of the box in a hurry to beat out that infield single. Very rich and impressive head on the pour, it captivated me right from the start. Not an overwhelming nose. It looked good in the glass, cloudy and inviting with an orange-yellow coloring.  The taste was a little raw, but the flavor held up the bargain. Citrusy and tart, the hops coming out in front. Slightly grassy in the middle, a slight taste of apricots maybe. Much like a typical Jeff Bagwell season, it was very, very good, and it will be appreciated by those in the know. It finished up with a slightly sour aftertaste, but not in a bad way. The carbonation was massive in this sample. Good, good mouthfeel, it felt alive on my tastebuds.  I wanted the big Lance Berkman home run from this one, and it delivered a shot over the wall. It wasn't an upper-deck bomb, but it was respectable and solid. Good job from the Ommegang Brewery in Cooperstown.

Tangerines, blended with mild apple/pear and maybe just a hint more of citrus fruit. A nice bitter finish to this classy brew.  Mouthfeel is fairly light, just about a medium body. Good servings of small bubbly carbonation. Easy going down the hatch; simple body and flavor---simply delicious.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,HappyHourHero,4.03,"Bottle #2368, should be about 1 1/4 years old by now.  Not as much carbonation as the fresh version, buts still a constant stream of bubbles. Big fat brilliant white head that leaves a thick coat of lace, but doesn't hold as well as the fresh version. The color seems a bit lighter, more of a golden straw color. Earthy doughy aroma with a bit of mild coriander and light lemon. Nice light fluffy mouthfeel on a lighter bodied beer. I don't know if it's the second glass of Hennepin but I'm noticing the warm stomach effect. A bit more flavor in this one, pale malt (or strong wheat beer) not noticing the spices or lemon, just slightly more bitter. The alcohol is more noticable and the flavor is a bit stronger cutting back on the drinkability.

Rocky suds remain as it dies down.  Smell: Mmmm, whew. Yeasty and citrusy, especially lemons.  Taste: Hmm. Different. A very organic earthy taste with the yeast playing a large part. Kind of fruity, apple tasting esters and a honey-like sweetness in the middle. Quite a phenolic bite in the aftertaste. Ewwww. I think about band aids floating in the pool. The phenols are really evident in this.  Mouthfeel: Decent. It has some body to it, but still drinks light and refreshing.  Drinkability: Very nice once you get over the phenols. Refreshing and easy to quaff in warm weather. I had no real problems finishing the bottle. I'm not sure it's as great as its ranking suggests, but a nice brew overall.  ----Update----07/04 A fresher bottle has less medicinal taste, brighter pepper and more fermented funk. I'm upping the taste to a 4 from 3.5. And at $4.59 for 750 mL, this and all Ommegang products are a victory for the beer lover on a budget.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,francisweizen,4.87,"750ml bottle #0336. Cave aged at Howe Caverns from early 2003 until September 2003. Drank in April of 2004. This is one of only 3,360 bottle that was cave aged at a constant temperature of 52 degrees Fahrenheit.  OK, so this stuff, like the cave-aged Ommegang and Rare Vos that I had quite some time ago, *is* different than the regular Hennepin. Is it worth $9 for the 750, as opposed to $4-5 for the regular Hennepin? I'd say yes, and here is why...  This brew pours out with a familiar orange tinted gold colour, and a large, rocky head of white foam. This brew was slightly cloudy, yet still very attractive in my chalice. The singature fruity aromas were even more complex, in this sample, and the spicy/herbal hops were definately much more pronounced as well. This brew has a nice bready middle, and an everlasting spicy hop finish. The flavors melded together very well, making for an exceptionally smooth drink, that drained from my glass too quickly. If you like Ommegangs products, you owe it to yourself to try the cave-aged stuff...it's all really quite good.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Very fresh smelling. Some alcohol, clove, spices (cinnamon?), citrus, and a faint floral hop scent. Taste is very fruity, the main spice in the brew is cloves. Some citrus is also present from the hops. The alcohol heats your throat quite nicely and does not even remotely overpower any other flavor of the beer. There is a very nice dryness in the finish as well. The carbonation in this beer makes for a very interesting and pleasent mouthfeel. This is another stellar brew from Ommegang. I will definitely have this one again.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Rastacouere,3.58,"Hazy golden hue wearing a thin white head. A very vinous nose with more alcohol than expected. Quite fruity overall with grapes, lemon/citrus, but it could use a bit more spices to my liking. Saison-ish hay character is very well defined though and appealing. Lots of warming alcohol in mouth also, a solid hay field accompany typical cereals. Mildly acid with more lemon, yeasty with a dry bitter finish. The body is highly carbonated, a bit too much for my tastes with this particular flavor profile, it's smooth and big enough to support the warming effect nevertheless. I must say I expected more from one of the rare american Saison, the obvious alcohol at this moderately low ABV just doesn't allow for the quaffable yet feeding beverage I expect.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

When the head disappears, a think layer of spotty froth coats the surface of the beer.  It smells of pine, horseblanket, sulfur, and green banana with some sweet malt in there as well.  The taste hits with a swirling combo of the sweet malt and a hop bite. The two move back and forth and leave with a hop zing and slightly banana sweet malt flavor.  The mouthfeel is solid with only a hint of prickle.  I detected a plastic taste in earlier batches, but that is gone now.

Pours with a nice foamy white head that simmers down just enough to cover the beer. Smell includes every fruit in the holiday fruit basket...fresh pears and definitely a strong citrus aroma. One of the first Belgians I have had, so the taste was definitely a mystery when the first drop hit my lips. Smooth taste with a sweet aftertaste that is in no way dissatisfying. When I let my girlfriend try it, she thought she was drinking a champagne or sparkling wine. The carbonation is odd, but somewhat refreshing. Definitely a beer that I could have a couple of if it was in the budget.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,GreenWBush,4.43,"750mL bottle into an oversized white-wine glass.  This beer pours out much like a sparkling wine or champagne with a deeper golden copper appearance. Major carbonation that gave a beautiful fuzzy (or in my original notes furry) taught head that left a few nice tracks of lace. Streams of bubbles rise to the top throughout the duration of the bottle.  The nose screams apples, with a slight bit of pear and banana. This has more of a conventional ale-smell than most Belgians that i've tried. Subtle perfuming of alcohol as well, moreso than the higher ABV Ommegang.  The taste is amazingly well balanced. The generous hopping cuts through the sweet cidery tones perfectly. A spiced flavor balances perfectly in harmony with the malts, sugar, and hops. Immaculately brewed. For price and freshness, a Duvel breaker.  I'm with Todd, one of these in a night would not be enough.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,soper2000,4.05,"Taking the cage off and running my finger over the cork was enough to send said cork halfway across the room causing my friend to dump half of a storm king onto his lap. Wow, I like this beer already. It pours a cloudy orange color with a billowing fluffy white head. There is definitely a fruity/spicy smell to it. Taste is spicy, hoppy, and fruity all rolled into one. Mouthfeel is decent, consistent to many other caged and corked Belgians I've had. A great beer from a great brewery.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Zorro,4.77,"Pours a cloudy gold colored brew with heavy carbonation.  Smell is apples and lemons, sage, flowers, spices, pears, and 20 more things I can't pin down at the moment.  Taste is sweet, spicy and complex. Perfume flavors abound like lavender, pepper, roses, apples, nutmeg, nuts, yeast, bread, and 10-20 more flavors.  Mouthfeel is much like Champagne, or Duvel.  Super drinkable, this is very similar to Duvel. Super pleasant to drink. Think of this as the Batman that opposes the Duvel Joker.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Sammy,3.83,"Hoppy and a bit bitter and dry. Colour is like a Belgian pale, despite some cloudiness. Very bubbly in the pour, moderate head.alcohol is there. Yeasty aroma.

42,141,Ellbert,3.6,"Appearance: This beer was very clear. Crystal clear even. A decent head that faded fast to a small head that lasted with sticky lace. The color of the beer was an orange/red color with a white head. The bubbles came up like champagne.  Smell: Very spicy with some hop highlights. A little alcohol enters the nose.  Taste: At first there was way too much cabonation to even taste this beer but after it breathed for a little bit the carbonation wasn't as rough. This beer was very spicy. My first Saison and it was almost like all the other Belgians I have had.  Mouthfeel: Way too carbonated at first. After it breathed it was consitent. It had a nice not too thick but creamy consitency, very nice.  Overall not a bad beer but not my top choice.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,longpondbeerman,3.77,"I admit that I am not all that familiar with this style though I have enjoyed Brewery Ommegang's several other worthy offerings. This pours a clear light golden color (I got the first pour out of the large bottle--the later pours got a bit of the typical cloudiness of a bottle fermented brew). There is a large white head, and the effervescence is evident right from the outset. The head receded slowly, and the lacing is tenacious but not sticky. The aroma is tart, dominated by citrus and ginger with an underlying wheat maltiness. The taste, I'm afraid, was initially a bit too rubbery for my palate, letting the alcohol reign for a moment or two, but as it moved to a finish the aforementioned aromas insinuated nicely themselves into the mix. The mouthfeel is thin to medium with lots of carbonation.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,FranklinPCombs,4.4,"Ive had this beer several times and I finally found out that I havent reviewed it yet, so here goes. The beer pours with huge frothy head, which seems to have a certain rigidity to itself, retaining a tall lofty shape in the middle, even as it dies down around the sides. The lace patches up nicely along the glass. Bubbles float aimlessly from the bottom. The smell is wonderful, with immediately recognizable hints of the heavy wheatiness of the beer, a ton of spices, a hint of lemon and an overall yeasiness that makes me think of bread dough. There is bit of hoppiness evident, and touch of straight alcohol is also present. For lack of a better term, it smells very thick in the nose. The taste follows right along with the smell. It is very warming and thick, with the wheatiness of a weisse beer, showing a strong yeast character again, with the alcohol definatley tastable. The exact characteristics of the spiciness escape me, but its a heavy part of the taste. Mouthfeel is a light syrupy viscosity, with tons of tiny carbonation filling the mouth. Drinking this gives me a nice warm feeling. A nice throw back to the past, as this was one of the first ""real"" beers I ever had.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,HiroProtagonist,4.2,"Hennepin was served from a 12. oz bottle. In a Duvel tulip, the beer was murky and straw colored, with a fine head that left fascinating tendrils of lacing. Very attractive. The nose was quite wonderful, with a zippy lemony acidity garnished with coriander, a rough orangy mustiness, and a touch of sweetness. The taste began with a lemony citric tinged sweetish malt base that developed accents of mandarin orange. The beer finished amazingly with an energetic smack of bitterness followed by ever lingering lemon-lime-orange notes...I loved this. However, I felt that the beer was a bit too sweet and not crisp/dry enough for a saison. For this reason I had to deduct a half-point, but I must stress that this was the only negative. The beer had the appropriate vigorous carbonation, and the body was full and smooth.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,vitesse,4.5,"served in 750 mL bottle.  pours a bright golden color with slight whitish cloudiness. super fluffy, pillowy head. label calls this a saison, not a style i'm too familiar with... aroma is of belgian candi sugar and cloves. taste just blew me away. very very similar to duvel, which shouldn't surprise me because the ommeg brewery is owned by moortgart. slightly ""farmhousey,"" grassy flavor especially reminds me of duvel. alchol packs some punch, but spicy hops flavor and belgian-esque sweetness all meld together to balance out nicely. sweet finish but super duper drinkable. this is a real crowd pleaser. all the complexity of the big belgians is here. a great blonde beer. i highly recommend it.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Foxman,4.13,"It pours a clear twinkling gold with sparkling bubbly accents. A couple fast fingers of variegated white head settles quickly to a Berber carpet of froth. Dainty lacing clings prettily on the glass.  The compact aroma leads with a rounded sweetness of malt and berries, along with a distant pie cherry tartness. The yeast carries a diaphonous air of gentle sourness.  Upon sipping, a biscuit malt sweetness leads off, but checks its swing as a drier, more tart berry note takes over. The grain character continues on to a pas de deux with mellow spice elements, certainly clove, and maybe coriander. Alcohol comes through clearly toward the end, along with a slight doughiness from the yeast, and these fade to a dry bitterness at the finish. The unique proportions of the various components lead to an intriguing balance.  Medium bodied, it clings determinedly to the tongue and mouth, leaving an even deposit of the round flavor. A mild dry bitterness glows on the tongue at the finish.  The drier components vying with the subdued sweetness leads to a refreshing union of both. Each element works in proportions that seem something other than the usual. The result is a stylish marriage of common qualities, a unique result indeed. The ABV is credible and overt, but exists in a friendly symbiosis with the beer's overall goodness, making it drinkable in sensible quantities. Now that I've had this, I'll certainly find the time to have another as soon as the mood strikes me.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,AllThingsNinja,4.43,"Purchased in a 750ml cork and caged bottle, this brew was served in a flute. Amble bright white foam crowned a bright golden beer. It's aroma hinted of fruits and yeast. The flavors offered more complex spicy and fruit flavors balancing sweet caramel malts. This beer was neither heavy, nor thin but had definite presence in the mouth. It was a delightful companion to a meal of cheese-bread and soup.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,aracauna,4.06,"The first pour is a clear, glowing deep golden amber. The second pour turns cloudy and darker. The head is massive and stiff. It fades slowly and leaves a thick sheet on the sides of the glass. Beautiful beer. Orange and cloves on the aroma. Very bright and happy. The taste is also very bright and spicy. Fruity esters meld nicely with the orange flavor and a nice straw and caramel malt. A slight bitterness lingers in the finish. Excellent.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Suds,4.08,"Sampled this with some great soft cheeses. Pours a clear, pale golden color with a frothy, energetic head. The aroma is more floraly hoppy than I expected.layered flowery smells, spiciness, and citrus-like hop aromaswith a background of alcohol. First taste is sweetmoderately malty and yeasty. Subtly spicy. The beer is highly carbonated, which gives it a crisp carbon-dioxide bite. Its refreshing, clean, and finishes pleasantly bitter. I could see this beer going well with most foods. Inexpensive and impressive, Ommegang is becoming a favorite of mine.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,ctrlfreak,3.76,I was surprised by the clarity of this bottle conditioned ale. (taking a sip) I was a little nervous about trying this because I am not a fan of the Ommegang. But I was pleasantly surprised by this. (sipping) A beautiful amber with lots of tiny bubbles. The head was a wonderful thick frothy white. The nose was a little harsh but that is do to the Belgian yeast. I am a hop lover. (sip and gulp) But the taste cuts through the nose and washes everything down with a clean and crisp mouth.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,CBFanWish,2.53,"Not to be the spoiler of fun, I'm just not a fan of this particular beer. The first time I had it, I liked it, but I have had many since then and haven't liked it much at all. It pours into the glass a hazy orangish yellow with a huge head. I tried to control it, but it was like racing a car on ice with a blown tire, I couldn't win. But it does give the drinker a decent chance to smell of what he/she is drinking. The smell was hoppy, but it has a great deal of sweetness to it. The taste is bready to say the least. It's not much different than bitting into a slice of wonder bread. There are some hoppy qualities to it. A bitterness and also a sweetness. Normally these are qualities that I like in a beer, but it doesn't sork for me in the Hennepin.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Charthepirate,4.76,"Amazingly simply amazing. Sipping this beer I cannot describe the plothora of flavors present in it, but I'm not at that point, so I'll start with the appearence, which is mighty fine. Pours kind of a ruddy golden, head is like heavy cream, god it's beautiful. Left a huge covering, if not thick lacing.  It smells fairly standard, reminding me of a wheat beer and duvel. IMO the weakest point of the beer.  The flavor, god the flavor. smooth, complex and rich. Spicyness from the alchohol, wheat flavors, mild banana, sugars. God, I list all those and I can't even approach what I taste there. Amazing, simply amazing. In the back of it all, just a touch of bitter from the hops that calls out the contrasts and makes all the amazing maltiness of the beer just stand out even more.  even more than the flavor though, this beer rolls around the mouth, in perfect coordination with the carbonation and the full mouthfeel. It's almost like what champaigne would taste like if it had a roundness to match the carbonation.  As you can probably tell by now, i've had a bit of this stuff. Why? it's damn drinkable. Amazing, amazing brew, no if ands or buts.  Char",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,chilidog,4.45,"Wow, This brew could not be guessed it comes from Copperstown, N.Y. It pours a nice hazy gold with a higher carbonated (some fizz) head. The head is white that settles to a thin,close bubbled film that dose lace though it fades also. The aroma is lemon citrus. As with the taste the citrus comes through in a lemon pepper on wheat. Also a honey sweet spice lingers a dry mouthfeel. Alcohol at 7.5% hits home strong while allowing this brew to be very drinkable.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,jtfest,4.25,"Beautiful yellow coloring with a nice, lasting white head. Active carbonation lends an ongoing bubble-show in the glass. Sweet floral aroma complements nicely the rich mouthfeel and taste that starts sweet and ends dry. To tell the truth, it reminds me of champagne, particularly in how the effervescence feels on the palate (not just because of the corked bottle ;-). Overall, a very enjoyable experience.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,yankeeheel,4.13,Pours a very hazy yellow with a hint of orange. Smells very citrusy/hoppy and scared me originally when I sniffed it. Had all the makings of a pale ale nightmare. How happily wrong I was. Has a very active bubbly white head that just looks great receding down the tulip glass. Damn good looking beer.  The taste is interesting. Syrupy sweet with a hint of malt and a lot of lemon/grass/pepper up front. Quite a good sized body for a mild beer. Finishes sweet as it began with some nice carbonation tingling on the tounge. Another gem from Ommegang.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,twilight,4.72,"12 oz bottle, silver-rimmed chalice glass.  I first thought I wouldn't like this beer. The first impression is the bitterness, and it reminded me just a tad of ESB's that I don't have a particular fondness for. I kept drinking however, and mmm....  This beer is yummy. It pours with a golden color, with very little head and leaves only a bit of lacing. The aroma is reminiscent of honey, citrus, and that smell I refer to as ""earthy"" (kind of like smelling tree roots). The taste is nice, though a bit ""wheaty"" for me. I can definitely taste the wheat character in the beer. One of the only detractions is a hint of the alcohol comes through, (at 7.5 percent), so it detracts some from the flavor. I know I'll be enjoying more of this in the future.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,mschofield,4.35,"Orange-gold that sparkles when I hold it to the light, very clear for bottle conditioned. Two finger head with loudly crackling bubbles. Ends up as a bubbly laces.

Crisp with a medium feel, a pleasure to drink.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,filabrazilia,4.42,"Pours a semi-cloudy golden with a white loosely carbonated head. Excellent lacing.  Smells like a saison--citrus, coriander, and pepper with a light hop presence blend nicely in the nose.  The taste is similar to the smell and is delightfully refreshing in the mouth. The flavors are pronounced but not too strong. This is a great tasting beer.  This is a medium bodied beer with a crisp dry finish. Very nice.  This is a drinkable beer that was a pleasant suprise.

The aromas of spring flowers hit my nose and filled my head before I could take a sip. While, at first, I didn't ""get"" the Belgian beer style, I continue to drink them, hitting on some good ones and gaining appreciation for the bolder ones. This beer would be the perfect introduction to the Belgian beers as it is not overshelming, yet is very complex  The flavors consisted of fruity, tropical flavors like bannana, pomegranade, pears and figs, it had a smooth and easy drinking texture that finished with a nice hop dry feel with some sweetness around the edges, like a nice dessert wine. This was served rather cold from my fridge and as the glass warmed, all of the above aromas and flavors grew until the last sip.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Wonderfully complex aromas of freshly ground ginger, orange peel, maybe some coriander, pepper, fruity esters and slightly earthy hops. More ginger, orange rind, Saaz hops, ripe apple and pear are evident before a mild finish reminiscent of freshly ground pepper. Mouthfeel is smooth, lush and downright pleasing. Drinkability is phenomenal for a beer of 7.5% abv. Though it's not a true saison to the traditionalist due to its alcohol content, it's a damn good beer that is clearly worthy of your attention. One of the better values on the shelves today, too.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Especially at the 4.99 price tag for a 750ml, here in Chicago.The color is right on, featuring blazing orange-the head pours big and frothy and maintains a fine stick. Flavorful and refreshing both, the beer salutes the style nicely. The taste is much like that of a Dupont Saison, with spicy citrus hop and a nice snappy bite.

42,141,shirfan,4.8,"Poured a cloudy light gold with a retentive, large-bubbled head.  Aroma is estery, fruity, with sour notes of cherries, cloves, pears and alcohol.  Flavor is balanced, light and sweet yet complex at the same time. A pleasant, non-diacetyl sour lemon flavor keeps the sweeter esters in check; pear and a mild clove come through in the finish, with a yeasty, drying aspect. There is no hint of alcohol here other than a slight warming a full 2-3 seconds after the sip is swallowed... but there are leafy, spicy hops as well. Not in a capacity to overpower, but just enough to make things all the more interesting. Never cloying nor thick, this just keeps tempting another sip.. and another...and another.  Hennepin takes all the best qualities of a hefeweisen, belgian, and ale... and combines them into a ridiculously drinkable beer. I'm totally in love with this, and rating accordingly.

Poured a hazy honey colored yellow with a large and enchanting white head. Big bubbles all around.  Aroma was of yeast, fruitiness, grasses in a blender, a few spices, etc.  Flavors included all kinds of fruits, yeast, and spices. Not bad but certainly not what I was expected.

Smell is mostly yeasty and spiced, some citrusy lemon and white pepper underlay with a slight touch of alcohol. Taste is subtle and fairly complex with an overall mellowness thats super nice with an easy and soft maltyness, lightly citrusy of lemon and melon rinds, dulled tangyness, some notes of musty grasses and sugar. Spicy yeastyness is light up until the finish where it approaches ever so tingly and lightly building slowly, gaining some and helping end with a calm dryness in the finish. Carbonation was perfect, solid and full bodied, a nice crescendo from start to finish and a bit of thickness and even some light chewyness rendering in some of the finish. Nice malty balance with the yeast, and what ever hops may be in there adding in with some of that grassyness and very slight calm bitterness thats barely noticeable in the middle.

Hoppy aroma with citrus notes tells me that I'm going to like this one better than the syrupy V-12. Indeed, the mouthful is reassuring. Hop notes and carbonation assault the tongue. This is a very visually attractive offering, maintaining a small head and interesting vertical lacing. Taste is dominated by the interesting hops, which are tempered by hints of hay and pears.

42,141,RoyalT,4.03,"Appearance  Beautiful, light but cloudy yellowish-orange body with a nice white head that went down slowly.  Smell  Nice mix of yeast and slight sourness with some significant spicing. The spicing is typical BSPA. The fruits are light and pleasant, most notably melons, apples, strawberries dipped in sugar, and lots of green grapes.  Taste  This one is very good. Theres a hint of the grassy garden in there, but mostly youve got a wonderful yeast base mixed with tangy but restrained fruitiness. Theres a hint of alcohol more along the lines of a dry blanc or maybe even a brut blanc de noir with all that carbonation.  Mouthfeel  Medium-bodied but heavily carbonated, this one produces about a thousand sensations in the mouth. Very fun and entertaining; not something youd want to serve with a meal.  Drinkability  I had this on an empty stomach just before dinner, and it was a delight. It wetted my appetite for the stuffed chicken with sticky rice and garlic gravy. Excellent and adventurous example of the style.  Update  I re-reviewed this with a 2004 bottle and found it to be very enjoyable. I got a lot more spicing this time around but otherwise it seems pretty consistent.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

The nose is a mix of fruits, yeast, wood, alcohol, phenols, apples, apple peel, cinnamon and some other soft spices.  This beer has a huge amount of carbonation. It's almost hard to drink at first it's so carbonated, but once it sits for a few minutes the carbonation mellows and pulls all the flavors out. Very easy drinking, medium bodied and very well balanced. Clean tasting, lemons, lemon peel, soft grain malt, an earthy hop bitterness, apples, pears, wheat, phenols, yeast. There's even a slight chalkiness.  It ends with a more intense bitterness that slightly overshadows the nice clean malt and fruit flavors.  Overall this is just a great beer. If it weren&#8217;t 7.5% I'd call this a perfect session beer. It tastes like the sort of beer you could just sit back and drink all day long. Very clean and simple, yet complex enough to let you taste every flavor all in perfect harmony.

Spices are ginger and coriander. This is a beutifully spiced brew from start to finish. Low peppery image mixed with fruit produces a cidery quality. This beer makes no apology and produces a very bold flavor. The finish is stong with belgian malt and a hint of alcohol. Worth the 3.99 price tag, to be as understating as possible.

Smooth, sweet, spicy and complex flavors assault the tongue, with estery notes, ginger, and a slight hint of banana as well. It's hard to say just how this beer can display so many things at once, but it pulls it off admirably. Alcohol is well hidden, but slight warming is there at the end.

42,141,nixhecks,4.23,"Poured a hazy golden yellow color with tons, and I mean tons, of carbonation bubbles shooting upward. Very large, foamy, white head with maximum retention. Aroma was full of banana, yeast, wheat, not too unlike a hefeweizen. Taste was soft and mellow, kind of cidery with a citrus like hoppiness and the banana in the background. No real indication of the higher ABV. Awesome brew, and the price ($4.29 per liter) can't be beat.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,cerevisiaephilus,4.2,"I was very impressed with this beers head. Very soft and fluffy, leaving a very nice lace on the glass. A very nice spicy yeast flavor that isn't over done, but still an important, solid part of the flavor profile. There is a good dose of hops to this beer, with a carbonation level that is quite appropriate to the style. This beer is quickly becoming a new favorite, and at $4.99 a 750ml bottle, it really can't be beat.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,beerguy101,4,"Medium copper color, large head. Hoppy floral nose. Nice carbonation. Mildly hopped, spicy, slightly malted. Some yeastiness and some fruitiness. Light and refreshing. Yeasty flavor. Finish is light. Aftertaste is slightly fruity with some hoppyness, not bitter. This beer carries it 7.5% alcohol well.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,DarrellK,4.38,"The aroma and palate are good individually, the way they work together makes them very complementary. At 7.5% it is fairly strong, but soft enough to not be intrusive. The label calls it a Farmhouse Ale, which is a good description of a Biere de Garde, and it comes across as a brew that could have been done by a local in an uncomplicated yet pleasing result. THis can be an everyday drink on it's own or with a meal instead of a white wine.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,kevinl6,3.7,"Overall, a little bit of a let down for me. Split this one with my drinkin bud, and poured it into one of our new tulip glasses. Had a nice appearance...cloudy orange with a foamy, two finger thick head. Smell was nice as well, sweet and fruity. Had a carbonated, crisp mouthfeel, but not as pleasing on the palate as other Belgian style ales I've had. Taste wasn't anything special for me, fairly typical for this style of beer. Had an average drinkability....I didn't have problems with my half of the 750ml bottle, but I didn't want any more either. Worth a try, but don't expect to be blown away or anything.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,ViveLaChouffe,3.84,"750ml bottle I picked up at Brewery Ommegang in February 2003. A fine appeance, looks even better than it tasted, A luminescent gold but cloudy. It has a thick white head, even with a gentle pour. Smells spicy (ginger or coriander) and hoppy with a hint of apple. Tastes alternately sour and fruity (depending on where it's hitting the palette) with that ginger spiciness thrown in. Quite the hoppy aftertaste but not unpleasantly so. Aftertaste really lingers. Has a foamy mouthfeel with a medium body. For such a complex ale, it is very drinkable. I would have to say this is my favorite Ommegang product I've tried thus far.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,dmarch,4.12,Golden in color with a high amount of carbonation and a thin white head that dissipates quickly. Aroma suggests tropical fruit and orange with some spices. Taste begins with a honey-like sweetness and finishes slightly tart. Very authentic and true to the style. Completely in the tradition of Belgium.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,xgrigorix,4.43,"Seven hundred fifty milliliter brown bottle, corked and caged. No bottling date to be found.  Bright gold in colour, and slightly hazy. A rocky white head erupts and quickly departs, leaving a thin bit a foam and tons of creamy looking lace.  The aroma is spicy sweetness mixed with oranges.  Mildly sweet, spicy, alcohol, herbs (ginger and coriander?). Dry orangey finish.  Lively carbonation, soft mouthfeel.  The yeast pour turns it into a cloudy yellow, and brings out a fruitier character.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Stubbie1,4.13,"Another wonderful brew from Ommegang! This Hennepin pours almost a clear honey gold, there is a slight bit of haziness in the beer. On top of this champagne like brew is a thick, tight, white head that stays around for a while. The aroma is a bit mixed of light hops, fruit and spices. The taste is great, it starts off with a sweet/sour mix. Not a bitter tart sour but a slight twang to it sour. Near the end is a hint of malt and some hops. This is a very busy beer, that is nicely bodied and easy to drink. Very very nice!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,IrishRedRock,4.13,"Corked and caged 750ml...and for only $3.99 up in Boston! I would probably have paid double that down here in PA.  Had I not known what I was drinking, I might have thought this beer was straight from Belgium. A thick pillowy snow-white head sits atop this light golden elixir. The first sips are dry and a tad smoky... as it warms the flavors and complexity emerge. Clove and banana complement the sticky yeast and subtle hops, and there is an odd yet enjoyable sweetness to it as well. I have not had many of this style, but I know this to be a delightful brew. Very light considering the complexity. The alcohol is hidden well. A tasty brew...I'm awaiting the other Ommegang beers that are in my fridge!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,edchicma,4.2,"Hmm...first thought was ""Is this a 7.5 ABV?"" Reminded me of Hoegaarden, even though I know it is a different style. Head and appearance were very interesting. Nice thick head that dissipates slowly and lingers with a large bubbly surface. Smell is sonewaht fruity, reminding me once again of Hoegaarden. Nice crisp, somewhat fruity taste that cleansed the palate quite nicely with a subtle aftertaste. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, which was good for the alcohol content...no extreme bite here. Hard to really describe this in terms of other beers I have tried, othe that certain aspects reminded me of Hoegaarden...I honestly think this offering would be best on the patio on a nice summer's afternoon (out of the sun of course!) Initial thoughts are that at the right place and time this would be an excellent choice.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,beergeek279,4.32,"Served in the 750 mL bottle. The color was golden, with excellent head retention. The smell was very fruity and yeasty. The taste was slightly sweet.......not overly done on sweet taste......hints of a flowery, estery taste. Mouthfeel was somewhat heavily carbonated, but that didn't seem totally out of place. Drinkability-wise, I could easily finish the 750 mL bottle of this one!  Although Rare Vos is my favorite Ommegang product, this is certainly a close 2nd. The Saison is such a wonderful summer beer........so light and estery, yet still packs quite a punch!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,RenoZymurgist,3.74,Lace stuck to the inside of my glass and dthis had a thick white head that dissipated slowly atop a amber gold beer. Aroma was of a light hoppiness with spices. The flavor was a distinct spiciness from the yeast with a dry maltiness that definetly reminded me of a wheat beer. The carbonatin was very fine and truly in the belgian style. Very clean and excellent to have with dinner.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,SheepNutz,4,"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a hazy gold color with almost 3 fingers of foam. There is lots of thick lacing left on the glass. The smell is a bit spicy, with some cinnamon and fruity and nutty aromas as well. The taste is kind of fruity, kind of spicy, and kind of hoppy. A really good balanced blend of flavors. It is just the slightest bit dry. The mouthfeel is fairly full and bold. At 7.5%, this is fairly drinkable too. What a bargain!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,TheDM,3.33,"This brew pours a large invigorated white head of finely sized bubbles. It has a Cloudy wheat yellow color with yeast and carbonation rising in it. It has a mild malty hoppy aroma. Its a bit fizzy at first, but it soon dies out. I tasted a mixture of flavors that was unique to this brew. It was a bit chewy, doughy and had a hint of something else. It became very smooth with time. The good buzz I caught afterwards keeps making me raise my rating on this brew.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,RBorsato,4.85,"Hazy pale orange with a decent off-white head that dissipates. Good carbonation. Spicy yeasty Belgian aroma; light alcohol notes and citrusy tones also. Spicy and citrusy (grapefruit ?) taste with a light alcohol finish. Medium bodied and smooth with a strong spicy finish.  A nice, yet spicy/yeasty, intro to Belgian beers.  Label states: ""Belgian Style Ale"" & "" Bottle Conditioned"" & ""Grisette Farmhouse Ale""  Aged (2 years maybe) Tasted: 07/11/03  ($3.99 / 25.4 oz / 750 ml Corked bottle)",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,granger10,4.5,"I can't believe this is an American brewed Belgian. It's better than most Belgians from Belgium! Very complex in taste. I note a sweet fruity wine taste to it that all ommegang products seem to portray. There's also some peppery spice that brings a slight alcohol taste with it. Further along I notice honey and more spices. Great mixture of sweet and spices. No bitterness here. Finishes light and dry but has an alcoholic kick to it that I liked. The best Ommegang product. This is an amazing brew, one of the best for it's price.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Boilermaker88,4.3,"Actually got the last Hennepin in an 11oz bottle at a local liquor store for 50 cents. Seems there's no longer a distributor here in SoCal (correct me if I'm wrong, please) so I snapped up the last one. Glad I did.  Appearance: hazy orangish body with a white creamy head that slowly faded to a thin cap. Left nice lace behind.  Smell: immediately noted a spicy peppery aroma with a faint banana scent on the fringes. Soft alcohol smell in there too.  Taste: picked up a sweet/sour combination of peppery spices and vague apple taste, almost like a tart apple. Good little shot of an astringent alcohol kick at the finish.  Feel: Starts off smoothly and finishes very dry and crisp.  Drinkability: delicious almost to a fault. Wonderful mix of tastes and 11oz bottles could have you hammered in short order as you quickly quaff this outstanding beer. Now I've got to try to find more.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,aaronh,4.15,"Luminescent golden body topped by a rather thin white head, but the head shows decent retention and slowly fades to a thin collar. The aroma is very sweet, but then has an intriguing herbal smell as well. Hard for me to place the individual components, but it is very enticing. The taste is not neraly as sweet as the aroma insinuates. It has a nice grassy hop component, atop decent malt that just seems to stay out of the way. The finish is slightly bitter, but has a strange complexity. The spices bring to mind homemade chicken soup, as they did on the nose (I just thought it odd to mention at the time.) It has a very dry finish, that is slightly smoky or something. I can almost guarantee this would go well with roasted chicken or turkey. The mouthfeel is light and airy, but doesn't leave me feeling like something is missing. The drinkability is very good. I think this is an ideal dinner drink for poultry, and less of an everyday drinker. This may find it's way to my Thanksgiving table. A very enjoyable beer that seems part wine, part beer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,euskera,4.23,"Nice golden-yellow color. Pours with a nice foamy head that laces quite well. Taste is definitely Belgian, complex and rich. Deviliously delicious with a wide-ranged palate of flavors, a little spice, a faint hint of banana. Will return to this one time after time...",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Popsinc,4,"Appearance: A cloudy, dull golden/orange pour with a livley and constantly present head.  Smell: The nose is exploding with aromas. Big rich maltiness up front highlighted with a fudge-like sweetness. A mix of spicey & fruity hints as well.  Taste: Extraordinary! Layers and layers of complex flavours in this beer. Instant sweetness up front that reminds me of honey and brown sugar. Peppery spice and earthy qualities follow and a big rich maltiness give the beer generous body. A medicinal, alcohol kick towards the finish that carries a woody, sweet n' sour taste along with it.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and rich at first. Crisp and dry towards the finish.  Drinkability: I absolutley loved this beer. One was just not enough for me.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,BitteBier,4.02,"Hazy pour with a formidable off-white head. Clean, crisp grain smell dominates the nose and is complemented by an interesting cinnamon-like spiciness. Those scents carry over nicely to the taste, which is characterized by a good combination of sweet, crisp grains and a spicy bite of clove. Eventually fades to a warm finish. Good, clean mouthfeel. Once the novelty of this refreshing offering wears, you are left with a good but not great pale ale.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,brewdlyhooked13,4.43,"This pours a cloudy and somewhat subdued yellow. It creates a thick rocky head with big, fat bubbles popping all over. Haven't really seen that before, kinda different. After settling, there is a thin wisp of yeast sediment in the glass bottom.  Aroma is yeasty, musty, sweaty...no wait that's me. I get a very snappy yeast aroma dominating. At first it's kind of difficult to get past that, my nose just wants to be lazy and be satisfied with that yeasty Belgian smell. Focusing in, getting past that, I am rewarded with some notable banana and clove smells. I like.  Fairly average malt taste at first, but before I go thinking this one is overrated, the fun begins. Very bubbly, approaching the likes of champagne. Develops very nicely into some yeasty, bready flavors, just a bit of sourness in there, too. As the fluid clears from the mouth, that's where it's easiest to detect the above normal alcohol level. A no-brainer as it warms up, there's no hiding it. That vapory, estery mouthfeel gives way to some citrusy, lemony notes. Perhaps a little hop action there? As the mouth dries out, that lemony taste further develops into a grapefruit-like aftertaste. Cold, it also gives a warming feeling in the throat, your 2nd Notice that you'd be well advised to drink these slowly. Not as warming as it warms up, odd how that seems to be in reverse for me. Also, either as it warms or as I get closer to the bottom (higher concentration of yeast?), the aftertaste has a trace sugar mouthfeel, like aspartame.  Mouthfeel - the effervescence keeps the taste buds honest, I think it enhances the enjoyment of the beer by kind of bubbling off the prior sip's flavor influence, like the guy at Penn Station who scrapes the grill between sandwiches. Good consistency for the style, a little below average thickness, but not watery at all.  Given the opportunity, I would probably abuse this beverage by overdoing it, Hennepin is most delicious and drinkable. 7.5% abv be damned, this is one beer that'll make you look past that to see how many more are in the fridge!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,BigHead,4.35,"Cool bottle, which is always nice, seems to make my tongue more anxious. It pours nicely, an slight orange hue to the golden yellow brew as the cascade of bubbles make their way to the top for their obligatory contribution to a nice sized head. I smell bananas, clove, ginger, some other fruits, and yeastiness. And boy it is a nice tasting ale, with the fruitiness (banana and grapefruit) and spices making a nice balance with a decent hop presence. I found it to be a smooth beer with the carbonation action livening up my tongue, by the alcohol content makes this one to be careful with since I really couldn't tell it was that high.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,WVbeergeek,4.65,"Served from a corked 750 ml bottle it appears a golden hue with a vibrant white head leaving trickled lace a picture perfect Belgium style ale. Aroma has some of those farm house ale characteristics of spices and yeast notes very nice along with huge tones of malt sweetness, underlying honey notes and the phenols are also producing the fruit tones characteristic of any fine Belgium ale. So, far simply amazing I love it. Taste light trickled malt, this is the perfect combination of sweetness, light hops, and exotic spices and full rich tones with a nice finish of alcohol on the palate. The mouthfeel has the consistency of a light syrup highly carbonated just full enough to coat the palate and tickle the senses. Drinkability is just wow, I could treat this like a session beer until I tried to stand up. Really too drinkable and desireable to approach too often save it as a treat. Best thing about it is the reasonable price for such a great beer, classic!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,MJR,4.7,"Corked 750ml bottle  Appearance: After the cork all but forces itself out of the bottle, this beer pours a highly carbonated, pale honey body crowned by a massive, foamy off-white head. The head retains amazingly well, as it shrinks only a bit in the center, leaving a thick lacing on the glass.  Smell: The aroma is stunning...I could just smell this for quite a while! It has a wonderful balance of light fruitiness, spices, honey, hops, earth, musty yeast, and a slight phenolic note. Wow...  Taste: The flavor starts out with a sweet bite, then opens up into a brilliant balance of the following: light fruit, peppery spiciness, raw honey, bitter and biting hops, medicinal phenolics, musty and bready yeast, coriander and ginger, lemon and orange peel, and a faint banana flavor. Brings forth phenolic burps... Breathtaking...  Mouthfeel: Highly carbonated, with a tantalizing smooth and tongue-tingling, bottle-conditioned mouthfeel. It's like sex in liquid form for the tongue...  Drinkability: Just shy of outstanding. The only thing that could stop me from drinking a lot of this is the strength. You don't notice how strong it is because you're too damn busy being seduced by it.  Unquestionably top notch...why the hell did it take so long for me to review this? It's proof that the best Belgian-style beers don't always come from Belgium. It's also a bargain at $4 for a 750ml bottle.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,WesWes,4.18,"The beer pours a light gold color with a lovely white head that stands tall. The aroma is exceptional. I love belgian beers like this one. There is so much going on in here; bitter orange peels, corriander, etc. It has a sort of banana aroma. I can't say enough about it. The taste is also good. It rings of spices right from the first sip. The elevated alcohol level (7.5%) also lets you know that this is a beer to enjoyed, not slammed down. This would be great with some gourmet food. The mouthfeel is tremendously smooth for a bottle conditioned ale. It goes down smooth and is very drinkable. A great choice anytime. In my opinion, their best regular offering, only edged out by their limited edition Three Philosophers.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,assurbanipaul,2.64,"Golden and strong, light citrus aroma. This bottle had a heavy ammonia odor also, so my sample and evaluation may be tainted. Otherwise, another failed American attempt at a Belgian ale. However, I will say that this bottle's label is the most artistic and attractive that I've ever seen on a brew.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,WaltTrombone,4.33,"This fine brew poured a dark coppery blond, with a humongous sticky white head with amazing staying power. Forget lacing on the glass, this one left big clumps and gobs behind. Truly amazing head, bigger and fluffier than anything else I've tried. (I looked in the bottle for a nitro widget, none there...) The head was obviously inspired by the beer's namesake, Fr. Hennepin, who was the first European to see Niagara Falls. The aromas were abundant, malt, clove, leather and tobacco. The taste was mostly malt and clove, that faded to grapefruit. Faint notes of honey, caramel, and pine. The mouthfeel was creamy, and had (truly amazing, considering the massive head) light carbonation. The finish was very mellow, setting me gently down to earth with a smooth, mild hoppiness. Wow! What a trip! Not like a barrel over the Falls, more like the Tunnel of Love with your best girlfriend...",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Sixpack595,3.88,"A good bit cheaper than all the other Belgians I picked up this weekend, and still pretty good. Typical head, thick, fine, almost white. I broke my regular glass and was forced to drink from a green glass so I can't comment on the color or clarity (guess I need to get some more). The aroma was fruity and hoppy, maybe a bit spicy. Taste was great, ranging from sweet, to tart, to a bitterness that seemed to grow stronger with each glass. Nice lacing, and the head persisted to the bitter end, of course it didn't take long to polish off this beer. While there are better Belgians out there I must say this is a steal at $4-5 for 750ml...at that price its worth it just for shooting the cork at your friends.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,jcalabre,4.43,"Originally sampled 19 January 2002. Although the style says it is a 'Saison', this reminds me of the white beers I had in Belgium (like Hoegaarden).

I'm glad that I can get Ommegang's beers easily in my area",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,hotstuff,3.82,This brew poured a large white foamy long lasting head. The lacing on the sides of my glass was so-so. It had a sweet lemony aroma to it in my opinion. The carbonation was seen rising to the top. The body was gold in color. There was no bitterness noted with this particular brew. It was a smooth tasting brew to me which is much to my liking. I would definitely drink this one again.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

42,141,GeoffRizzo,4.73,"A light golden or honey color with a very thick and huge head, which sticks in sugary patches throughout, I love those sugary patches! The aroma is of fresh fruit and flowers, quite nice. The initial chewy and sugary and alcohol combo is brilliant, some pepper and banana can be detected. Towards the finish, some hops and fresh fruit, a dry and hearty finish, very warming, and this is brewed in my home state of New York? Incredible, awesome, add your adjective here, deserves to be a top 10 beer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Huge, fluffy, white head sits on the Hennepin throne (Duvel-esque, no?). Smells very floral and slightly citric. The taste is quite hoppy and fruity, notably apple, pear and banana. This is quite a crisp beer, with lively carbonation in the mouth. Finishes dry. Alcohol very nicely hidden.  A nearly perfect beer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,BierReise,3.95,"I'm surprised by the maltiness of this ale. Has a terrific sweet malt flavor. Looks great in the glass, cloudy honey appearance with a great Belgian-like head of froth.

Nice Ale!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,jward,4.62,"Hennepin is honey-colored, with a sizable creamy white head. It has a cloudy appearance in the glass, but it's not so cloudy so as to obscure the steady stream of bubbles rising toward the head. The nose, one of my all-time favorites, presents strewn hay, citrus (pineapple) and a faint mustiness that seems appropriate for a farmhouse/Saison ale. At first the flavor is sweet, with a slightly tangy sidenote, but mid-palate the sweetness is balanced nicely by a noticeable, peppery hop presence. Just a hint of banana shows up for the finish.  This is a hoppy beer, as the label suggests (""pale, hoppy, crisp and rustic""), but it is by no means strongly or assertively hoppy. The complex flavors balance nicely. And a crisp mouthfeel makes this a refreshing brew, especially after a day working (or relaxing!) in the spring sun.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,ChrisBowers,3.91,"Definately one of the better Saison style brews I've had, especially considering it is made in the United States. Hennepin's strongest characteristics begin to present themselves as the beer airs out and warms up a bit from its bottly confines. At first I found the bouquet to be a bit on the sour side and thought that I may have bought a skunked bottle of Hennepin, but after a few minutes I began to discover its delecate honey and hops tones. Definately a sipping beer, probably good on a hot day (I had it indoors on a 35 degree day). Overall, another excellent BC offering from Cooperstown.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,BeerResearcher,4.32,"I should mention at the risk of being ridiculed by fellow BA's, that I don't care much for some Belgium Abbey Farmhouse style ales, as far as beer goes. This is an exception. It's the overly acidic clove flavor that separates this style with every other style of beer. And Hennepin adheres to, and in fact, exemplifies the ""Abbey Bottle-Conditioned"" Ale, sans the overly cloved taste. Cloudy gold, medium body, high hops, strong yeast clove flavor, earthy, fizzy effervescence, some citrus notes, noticeable alcohol, nothing subtle and a fine white lasting head with plenty of Belgian lace. Is this not a description of the Abbey style? And aren't you hungry for strong cheese? Nice stuff!  Edit: 10/31/04 - My tastes for the Abbey-style ale have evolved. I like them more than I once did. I can't drink more than a few at a sitting because they create an acid reflux problem for me.

Hazy golden in appearance. Smell is wonderful - lemon and bubble gum? First sip reveals grassy, earthy flavor and on the dry side. I got a nice aftertaste that seemed honey like in sweetness with some sourness. I read a review after my initial notes that indicated a salty cheese flavor that I agree with. I also agree with remarks that this would pair well with food. I wish I had some cheese to try out with it.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,stirgy,3.68,"Poured out a pale and hazed yellow color. light carbonation with a creamy white head that thinned out quickly but left a nice lace.

A nice beer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,nomad,4.27,"Farm in a bottle! Yee haw!  So this puppy poured a gold color with a cloudy tinge from the yeast. Had a fair sized white head with thin spotty lace. Carbonation was furious, as it was fun to watch bubbles of all different sizes fly up my chalice glass.  The nose, well, its a farm: cloves, grass, wet hay, a little honey-toned background, and some serious yeast funk and whispy phenols. The smell is amazing, but is also quite hard to pin down. It was like a summertime meal, like roasted wheat and corn mashed with some wild mushrooms, cooked with butter and leeks and then left out in the country breeze.  Taste was like a pale ale with a funky character from the hops and unique yeast. Besides the slightly spritzy feel from the carbonation, the mouthfeel and taste was buttery, creamy, oily with notes of a salty cheese lightly playing on my tongue. The barley-ish base was great, as you didn't really taste the hops too much until the end of the finish, wherein the oily wash turned over into a soft dryness in the back and roof of my mouth. Overall, a character-ful swig that becomes almost wine-like after opening and a second glass (or more...)  This beer is made for food. Me and the foxylady munched on some salami that went extremely well with it - I imagine any spring or summery picnic or dinner would go fabulous with this. Can't wait to woo my wine drinking family over to beerdom with this brew this summer. Ommegang has hit the nail on the head in terms of a saison/farmhouse/bier de garde kind of ale.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,GreatPondBrewer,4.45,"750 mL bottle This was a damn fine beer! Another pick up from my escapades in Cooperstown. This poured a beautiful golden color with a marshmellowy white head. The smell was sweet like candied fruit with some rounded maltiness. The taste was crisp, smooth a very dry with some incredible carmamel flavors and notes of slight grape as well. I cannot praise this highly enough. I can see why they call this a folk beer. I would definitely drink 4-5 of these on a hot day which is exactly what this day was. However, with the increased alcohol content I will have to limit it to two.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,ElGuapo,4.05,"Cloudy straw with a big pillow of white foam on top. The lace remains on the glass for some time. Aroma is mostly of sweet fruits, but there is a solid yeast smell in there too.  It is very tingly and crisp. A very refreshing brew. I had it on the first pretty warm day of the year, and it definitely hit the spot. I could see it being even more enjoyable during the heat of summer. Sweet malts provide most of the flavor, and then you get a doughy finish. The yeast comes through in the aftertaste, and then a slight hint of alcohol.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,the42ndtourist,4.52,"12oz bottle at the Esplanade Bier Markt. This was their last bottle as they had just changed the beer menu for the spring/summer season. Offered to me for free for that reason. Served in a matching Hennepin glass (which I also obtained gratis).  A chill-hazed deeper golden colour in the body, with a fairly large white head that doesn't want to leave. In that respect it's certainly Belgian. Nose brings the smells of a hay barn during baling season (someting I'm familiar with), matching mustiness, some esters. Not that the hay barn dominates, but it's there.  The flavour is like the denizens of a barn in spring. Flavour is musty, some hop pepper plays around with lemon and grassy flavours. Alcohol chases them, cavorting, but never roughhousing. Young calves, baby horses, barn kittens, all delighting in their freedom and the spring.  A delightful beer, the rawness of it entices me like the less-than-perfect recordings from a indie CD. This beer hasn't been polished, the rough edges are still there, and that's what makes it so great. It's a beer to drink and enjoy. Again and again.... and again.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Mitchster,3.92,"Pours straw-golden with a slight haze, forming a large (depending on how you pour it), though quickly dissipating white head with an airy, sea-foam consistency, perched atop large bubbles. Carbonation is moderately strong. Aroma is highly yeasty with lots of phenolic cloves and banana. Hops and malts are barely discernable. No funk, esters, diacetyl or other fermentation by-products noted. Mouthfeel is fizzy and spritzy with a light body. Retention and lacing are adequate. A simple, but relatively clean beer....cloves, bananas, autolyzed yeast, wheat spiciness, some well-hidden (in taste) alcohol, with an isopropyl-like dry citrus finish and watery mouthfeel. As it warms, a grainy pale-malt note comes out in the finish and as the carbonation dissipates, the mouthfeel improves. There is still that metallic, ruddy tang (bad water?) that I tasted in the Ommegang, but thankfully this doesn't taste like ass. Adding the yeast and letting it warm made it infinitely more drinkable. Somewhat inferior, but similar to Blanche de Chambly from Unibroue but with a more potent alcohol bite. A 750ml bottle gave me a pleasant buzz.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Darkale,4.4,"Aroma is tart and hoppy, and it forms one of the most beautiful, large-bubbled, hot-white heads one is apt to find in a beer, with good retention and lacing. The beer itself is a cloudy dark yellow.  Very highly carbonated (witness the head, of course), with a sharp, tangy, gingery, peppery snap in the mouth. Brisk and hoppy, thought I detected a little saltiness to go with the massive pepper, slightly gritty and more than a little sour.  A very complicated beer that definitely improves with a wide-mouthed glass and a little warmth.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Body is about medium in thickness....very very drinkable...flavor includes sweet lemon drops...honey...cloves...juicy oranges...and some grassy hop notes develop along with a very slight alcohol spiciness on the long finish...this is a dandy...I want more!!!,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Poured a nice murky orange colour with a smallish pure white head which dissapates to a fine lace. The aroma of this beer is out of this world really pungent fruits and spices well mixed..i smell cherry, plum even some banana.. strawberry wow every time i smell this i get a different aroma great stuff. The tase of this beer is almost as good as the aroma.. again i get cherry..tingles on the back of the tongue leaving some hop bitterness thats well hidden..then as it goes down the throat I feel the alcoholic warmth..dang i can still taste this beer a full 1 minute after i have swallowed. Very easy on the mouth, the carbonation seems just right. Very drinkable but i couldnt manage more than 4 or 5 in a sitting..

42,141,kbub6f,4.37,"A huge, almost white, egg-whitey head reduces to rolling, dense hills of foam. Thick, foamy, clumps of lacing line the inside of the glass. The beer is a hazy peach-gold with superfine, extreme carbonation.  The nose is apples, fruit, spice and yeast; bubblegum and a little paint. The front is bubblegummy and spicy; the full, thick middle is apples, caramel and buttery smooth. The finish is dry, flowery, bitter with noticeable alcohol. The taste continues to change after swallowing: the aftertaste is bready and turns sweet.  Overall, this is a wonderful beer: fruity, spicy, flowery bitter.

42,141,Morris729,5,"Saved for my 250th Review. Ive been saving this one for my 250th review since Im such a huge fan of regular Hennepin. However, its been tough to resist the temptation to open it before tonight on many occasions! Pours a bright hazy golden color with a monstrous pillowy white head that billows out of the glass and very slowly fades into a heavy lace and coats the sides of the glass with thick sheets of lace as it recedes. Active carbonation is apparent as you can see many streams of tiny bubbles racing up the glass. Nose is sweet honey and fresh citrus with some floral notes. Similar to regular Hennepin but a bit softer. Medium in body with one of the smoothest mouthfeels Ive ever known a beer to have. The active carbonation also gives the beer a very crisp quality. Taste is very complex. Sweet and fruity at first with flavors of banana, grapefruit, melon, lemon, and honey followed (and nicely balanced) by a dry yeastiness and maltiness. Ive often been reminded of fine champagne while sipping a regular Hennepin, and this one is no different. It does have a more mellow yeasty and citrusy bite to it then regular Hennepin, though. This was simply a magnificent beer. Absolutely one of the best beers Ive ever had the pleasure to drink. A very special thanks to paceyourself for sending me this brew!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,IPAlot,4.62,"I consider this the finest product of Ommegang, as I have not yet detected such a masterful balance of spice, malt, aroma, and gaseousness elsewhere in there lineup. Drank out of St. Bernardus chalice/goblet (it doesn't really belong to either at)around 55 deg F.  Appearance: That beautiful belgian blonde. My dreams say it should be a bit more cloudy. Forget that I just squeezed the bottom yeast out of the bottle and there it is.  Smell: Heavenly. Pepper. Citrus. Apricots. Pears. Honey. In that order. A subtlety amazingly combined with the attention-demand of a slap in the face.  Taste: Not much hops, but the spiciness and pleasant fizziness substitute proficiently. A smoooooooooooooth light maltiness fills the middle, and the swallow is followed by a very fun crackling of lace inside your mouth, which doubly serves to release a final bubble of aroma up the back of the throat.  Balance, balance, balance, Daniel-san. Asssertiveness and Lightness, Yin and Yang, Theory and Practice, Black and White, Power and Persuasion. This beer is all of these.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,marburg,4.57,"This hazy, golden beer poured more clear, golden color than I expected. Definitely clouded -- but hardly the opaque biology lab many similar beers ressemble. So I was a bit surprised. The Duvel-ish head is creamy, dense, and lingering -- but never impossibly big.  Well carbonated and somewhat spritzy on the tongue but not in that pop-rocks sort of way -- more like a solid German hefe. And indeed, that's kind of what it reminded me of on first taste. Lemons and coriander up front. More acidic earth on the back end of the swallow.  Something of a farmer's market of flavor.  This is a great beer -- definitely a crafted product. Nothing immature or haphazard tasting about this brew.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,scottum,4.47,"wow.   Pours out a hazy straw gold with a beautiful bright white head. Tastes almost like a hefe in many ways. A hefe on lsd maybe. This is one complex brew. Wheat and lemonish flavors arive and depart. Clove and yeast knock on the door aswell. This is a beer that anyone can enjoy. Not too hoppy to scare away the unworthys (to quote Stone) and complex enough to satisfy a wine-buff. Not sure this is my favorite from the brewery, but this is an awesome brew that every BA should try if it becomes available.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,rabidawg,4.52,"750 mL corked and caged bottle.  Appearance: Cloudy golden amber, with slight carbonation bubling throughout. White, fluffy head that settled slowly; leaves a nice, uniform, spotty lace.  Smell: Like a strong Hefeweizen. Clove and banana, with noticeable musty, earthy tones.  Taste: More complex than I can completely analyze. Very creamy start, with sour citrusy, sacharine notes. Noticeable but not distracting alcohol content. Yeasty, wheaty middle. This beer finishes with that sacharine tinge coming through again . . . a sweetness marked by a bitter, dry finish that cuts the total sweet effect. Very crisp, and very easy to drink.   For $3.99/750 mL bottle, this is an enormous bargain. Pairs well with Vermont white cheddar and an impending Nor'easter. Great brew overall, and an excellent beer for the price.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

42,141,JohnnyDuvel,4.32,"This was quite a pleasant suprise. Somehow, I had the sense that this would be more of a ""spritzy"", carbonated type of beer. In reality, it is very much like some of my favorite Belgian (and Belgian-styled) beers. Quite the subtle flavor for the style, very refreshing . Pours a large, fluffy head, good retention. Fluffy lace remains. Similar to Orval in the body and mouthfeel, but without the spicy, flowery taste. This goes down so easy, it could get you in trouble! Dare I say delicate?! Quite a feat for a beer with a 7% ABV.

42,141,putnam,5,"Gorgeous perfume. Angel food cake is the focus with spring breezes carrying the smell of thawing earth, sprouts, buds, green growth, honey, coriander...inviting. The palate is slightly chalky as it delivers powerful flavors of reduced hops, stems, seeds, vanilla, leeks and sweet alcohol. Assertively dry. Perfectly balanced. Tight fizz indicates nice slow, cool maturation in the bottle.  Now, after pouring in some of the yeast crust, there is a decidedly additive effect. Black pepper surges on the mid palate and serves to power an even longer finish. More complexity, more bitterness and tang...more life. Keep it clean for the timid, I'll have mine cloudy.  beer. ___  upgraded from 4.85 to 5.0 on 9.19.03: From what I can tell this is the best beer brewed in north America. It speaks of nectarine and pepper. From Cooperstown NY, it is exotic. Crunchy, tart fruit doused with nutmeg, pepper and mace.

I definitely detect saaz hops, also some delicate malt character. The flavor starts out quite tart and hoppy, then more hoppy and malty near the middle. There's also a lot of sour fruitiness going on. Grapefruit especially. More delicate malt is detectable, which is a little bready. Even with the hop bitterness, this is very smooth. Great mouthfeel. Sourness and malt in the finish. Great beer! This could be considered a warm weather refresher, but I'm enjoying it on a cool evening, and it's working great.

I was expecting more depth and complexity to this brew, but it held back until the finish. It mellowed to a nice balance at the end and the tartness faded to sweet.

42,141,Thrasher,4.1,"Have enjoyed this many times but never sat down and tried to describe it. I'm finding it difficult for some reason, I think mostly because there's a lot going on. Shimmering platinum with blossoming head, although I did not experience the retention that many described. A floral, perfumey nose with champagne-like yeasts. Flavors include lemon, white grapes, almonds, apples (yellow or green), spices and pepper, with a quite sour finish. Malts are incredibly delicate and hops only underscore the spices of the big yeast profile. A saison perhaps, but I found this merging into Duvel / pale / tripel territory due to its brightness and zesty lemon flavors, and almost none of the tea or peach flavors that I associate with a saison. I imagine a good meal would bring out the heartier aspects of this brew. As such it remains an excellent US version of a Belgian and surprisingly cooling and refreshing.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92

Flavors like pale malt, honey, vanilla. There was even a tiny toastiness that found its way into my glass. Hop flavor or bitterness wasnt too prevalent, however there was some pepperiness to the beer. Carbonation was bigger than Id like and the beer was more viscous than any Saison Ive come across.

The beer poured quite lively into the glass forming a dense long lasting head with a beautiful color. The overwhelming nose was that of apples. I took some time just enjoying the aroma. The taste on the palate was clean and light with the bitterness being subdued and later. The beer tasted deceptively light for the high alcoholic strength. The finish was short and clean.

A fairly potent peppery flavor in the foreground, soothing light banana-honey in the middle, a bite of citrus at the end, tart but not overpowering. Hennepin is a fulfilling quaff without a brawny body, a remarkable accomplishment. Impressively complex, unrefined raw, yet, unsacrificing towards drinkability.

Buy the time you finish this ale the glass is covered with foam (it's not really a lace pattern). The aroma is heaven. The first thing you notice is the fruity yeast followed by grains of paradise, orange, lemon, coriander, and hints of alcohol. The taste is very well balanced with the malt flavors up front. This is followed by citrus flavors and spice flavors blending in with the malt and being balanced with the effervescence of this well carbonated ale. The finish is dry with notes of apple and pear and just a hint of hops balanced against the alcohol. The aftertaste is a lingering sweetness with citrus and alcohol notes. The mouthfeel is full and pleasant with effervescent tingling. IMHO this is one of the best Saison's made in the world. It goes great with food or just sipping in the afternoon.

Very fruity with a strong spicy hop pressence. Sweet malt in back, a bit more then typical for the style. Not as spicy and complex as many, but still big and inviting.  Flavor is malt and fruit at first, but quickly fades into a very dry, spicy, and alcoholic finish. High carbonation dries it out even more. Has a stong citrus rind character with complexity of bannanas and pepper. Almost a berry seed character, interesting. Lots of spicy hop character adds to the overal spicy finish. Pretty bitter for the style, maybe a litle more then I prefer. . The spice comes through in the middle with a hell of a lot of complexity, almost like fresh herb. A lot of pine notes wich is very intersting. After taste is dominated by alcohol, almost grain alcohol like without the complex fruit and spice notess. This higher alcohol character is a big turn off. Also seems a bit tannic, almost oak like in finish. No sourness are tartness, which is fine, but is really a character that I think works well for this style in beers like Pipax and Fantome.  All in all this is a decent beer, with a lot going on, but is not one of the best saisons out there. The finish is disapointing and loses a lot of the complexity. Aroma is great, and appearance is perfect, but just dosnt come all together like some. If you like this try the Fantome Automn, it has the same smoth malt bas and spicy complexity, but just works better and all blends.

The foam could stand almost an inch over the rim of the glass without running down the side and there was plenty of bubling action even though I rinsed the glass twice in anticipation of a frothy beer. The head on this beer left a total curtain of lace down the side opposite the one I drank from. Aroma was full of fruitiness, with some weizen type banana smells and some peach and grapefruit evident as well. Slightest bit of clove and a dash of grassiness apparent in small low quantities. The flavor is deeply complex with hints of grassiness, hazelnuts and peach and citrus fruit, as well as a good amount of clove and hints of other spices and a bit of musty yeast. Very smooth, easy to drink mouthfeel, despite the zesty, high carbonation. It is a tradition in my family to bring a bottle of wine to the Thanksgiving Dinner for all to sample, but I think this year I will surprise them all with a couple of 750 ml. bottles of this.

The scent is somewhat of a fruity one but not overly sweet like some Belgians. The taste is perfectly balanced more toward the malty side IMO. And it sits well on the palate, this beer is very drinkable for anyone. I think this is the one i would choose for the uneducated beer drinker to start with, it won't scare them off, and we BA can enjoy it also.

Orangey-brown colour with a massive, foamy, sticky, chunky head that slowy reduces to a heavy blanket of snow. Beautiful nose of honey and light banana and slight alcoholic tones. Earthy tastes with a slight malty graininess, cloves, fruity bananas and nuttiness. Medium, foggy-mouthed body that remains dry with little after tase on the palate.  Looks beautiful, smells soothing, tastes smooth and feels comforting and luscious. What can else can I say? Please drink. Cheers!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Murph,4.77,"Pours a hazy golden color with a decent creamy white head that never fully sinks and leaves a decent lace down the glass. Huge bubblegum, banana and other lighter fruits, and spicy pepper dominate the smell. The taste starts off with some great light fruity flavors that is mostly dominated by banana with some possible peach and orange. About half way through the brew gets nicely spicy with some good peppery qualities to it. Excellently creamy and smooth but also fairly refreshing and excelently drinkable with a medium body to it. This is one damn fine brew and I can't wait to get my hands on some more.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,mophie,4.58,"Coudy golden-orange, with billowy pure white head that sticks around for the long haul. Beautiful. Spicy banana aromas, very complex. Taste is herbal hops, pepper, clove, banana, candied ginger, caramelized orange rind, pear -- it's all in there! High carbonation creates a playful feeling on the tongue, and balances nicely with the spicy and oh-so-bitter finish. This is a damn good beer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,zerk,4,"Dark golden color, with a white head. Head dissapates quickly, but carbonation continuously replenishes it. Aroma and taste contain honey, spice, and citrus. Highly carbonated, very crisp, and drinkable.  This is a great beer for the price, $4.50 for 750ml in Indianapolis.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Bighuge,4.5,"This brew is a chill hazed golden and throws out a big pufffy white head that has nice retention. Pretty sweet aroma with this one. Honey like. Almost like a braggot or that Midas Touch brew. There's also some fruity esters perceived on the nose. Maybe some slight herbalness too. Nice aroma. Now this is a style of Belgian beers I can get into. This is really nice tasting. It is sweet, but kept in check with the hops, herbs and spices (which I will only try to take a stab at). There could be something like Rosemary or Marjoram throwing some pizzaz into this brew. I like it whatever it is. This brew really has a nice earthiness to it. Very unique taste. But very drinkable. Honey also seems to be perceived on the tongue. This is a light-medium bodied brew. Very good.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,marc77,4.4,"The fluffy, thick lace - leaving porcelin - white head tops a hazy light tangerine hued effervescent brew. Orange zest, candied ginger w/ trace phenol in aroma. Tart, citrus rind hit the palette upfront and are followed by a mild but refreshing hop bitterness. A light sweetness persists throughout this brew and seems to be the foundation for other flavors to build upon. Candied fruit, honey, pear notes all intermingle in a whimiscal fashion. The light body and crisp mouthfeel add to the flavorful yet refreshing nature of this brew. Finishes bittersweet, w/ a mellow lingering breadiness. Hennepin is ""playful"" in flavor, yet is very clean, and its drinkability is superlative. Alcohol warmth surfaces long after the sip finishes. Excellent, and perhaps bit dangerous.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,frank4sail,4.48,Fresh fruit aroma with hints of sweetness. There is also strong yeast odor. Very pale hazy look with a thick white head. I also smell bannana. Very carbonated at first taste with bannana and hops on the tongue. Great mouth very sharp tasting also on the tongue. lots of complexity in the yeast/hops relationship. This would make a great starter with cheese and fruit. Awesome American ... as usual from Brewery Ommegang!,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,ADR,4,"Orangey and opaque, 1/4 inch fine mist head replenished by ascending carbonation. Bubbles shimmer like sugar crystals on the side of the glass. Slightly astringent aroma. Good combination of fruit, a little banana, and very nice bittering at the end. Pretty reserved and yet nice tasting. Its hard to call a Belgian a ""session"" brew to me, but this one would be for me. Solid in most categories.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Wildman,4.1,"This beer poured out a nice golden color. It formed a nice white head with some lace on the side later on. The aroma of smelled of malts and cirtus. Good level of carbination to this beer. Due to that, the initial mouthfeel taste of it throws me off a little, but it sudsides after the next taste or so. Hides it's alcohol content well. A very enjoyable beer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Viking,4.23,"It all starts when you pop the cork from the bottle. A nice loud 'pop' - almost like a champagne. The beer pours to a hazy gold, with a thick, white head. Solid head retention, with lace clinging to the glass as you drink. Smell is lightly fruity and spicy, filled with sweet apple, pepper, hops, and yeast. Flavor is rich and strong with the flavors hinted at in the aroma. I also notice a bit of citrus flavor meshing with the apple. Lively continual carbonation give the brew a bit of zest, but not too much as to make it seem acidic on the tongue. Wonderful brew, and a great cost effective Belgian-style ale.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,beerluvr,4.2,"Pours a hazy golden with lively carbonation. A long-lived head displays ample Belgian lace clinging to the glass. Nose is light malt, and a wee bit lemony. Taste is again light, fruity with some hoppy bitterness coming thru. Close your eyes and you'll swear this beer was brewed in Belgium. Goes great with Wise BBQ potato chips.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,cokes,4.1,"I am actually shocked that I have not already reviewed this...as it is one of my favorites. Pours a yeast-filled golden....quite hazy. Aromas of apples, yeast, pepper and hops. This pretty much labels the taste as well, Fantastic tart apples up front. Peppery yeastiness. Nice lime accompaniment. Citric and very tasty. Hops dry things out in the finish. Medium-light bodied with the big carbonation. This is sooo good on a hot day. Alcohol is not a factor. One of my most-purchased beers (especially at $4 a 750ml...where's the brown bag??) This is THE stuff.  Update: Maybe my opinion of Ommy has soured, but this is not the beer I once thought, aged or fresh. More tart than memory recalls with green apples and citric fruit taking the fore. Simplistic, light peppery and doughbal yeastiness. Good for what it is, but so many saisons surpass this. But I must say, for the price, this is still a soild belgo-quaffer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,packetknife,4.25,"Tart and fruity. Heavily carbonated, obscenely so. Smells wonderful. Nice deep character. I didn't expect anything this good for what I first thought was a 'knock-off'. Definatly a re-visit.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Bierman9,4.03,"Interesting Ommegang offering. Golden color, a touch cloudy, with a fine white head, which laced the glass big-time. The nose is a fruity/spicy mix. Seemed to be a little thin to medium on the body-scale, but ok carbonation-wise on the tongue. There are some spicy-notes, along with a hint of sourish-ness. Alcohol is evident here. Dry finish for this one. Not bad.  overall: 4.1 appearance: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | mouthfeel: 4 | drinkability: 4  114",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,inebrius,4.35,When first a draft of Hennepin hits your tongue a lively carbonation spreads. Then tart and fruity and spice shuffle about. A dose of hop bitterness and flavor finish as the alcohol warmth envelops you and you smile. Where would we be without the craft brewers dedicated to good beer? Quality!  Cheers to frank4sail for the sample.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,BeerAdvocate,4.3,"Presentation: 12 oz brown bottle with raised glass Ommegang emblems below the neck of the bottle. No freshness date though this beer has strength and is also bottle conditioned giving it a long shelf life than the normal microbrew.  Appearance: Dull golden in colour with a pure white, rocky, sticky, chunky head (almost seems alive). Clarity is decent and the head stay for a long time.  Smell: Raw honey, peppery with a medicinal phenolic back ground. Vague suggestions of horse blanket and a musty graininess in the aroma also.  Taste: Medium body, very crisp with a slick mouth feel. Mild lemon and fruity tartness swirls around with leafy, grassy and earthy flavours. Honey like sweetness within, malt character is a tad dry with biscuity flavours. Yeast adds a nutty dryness that is similar to aged walnuts. Spicy phenols give off herbal and medicinal flavour but not in an overwhelming way, clove pushes the envelope the most. Alcohol is runs estery with fruity flavours that suggest pineapple and plantains. Spiciness lingers and the dryness lends more nutty flavours in the end.  Notes: Raw and complex yet oh so drinkable, impossible to tell it would have been from NY in a blind tasting. One of our favourites, bring a couple of 750 ml bottles to the dinner party and see if this sparks anyones interest away from wine.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Jordan,4.82,"A pleasant fruity and spicey nose. Extremely carbonated, quite the spectacle. Head is thick and fluffy, almost weightless, endures long after your pour, sticky. Misty yellow-orange. Exceptional flavor. Fantastic belgian character. Home-town indeed. Prost!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,jermar,4.05,"Cloudy and golden with lovely white head that sticks around. Very smooth and full bodied initially, followed by a bitter/alcohol/carbonation gang-bang bite at the back of the palate and into the nose coupled with a lingering bitterness with a slight tartness that leaves the outsides of your tongue somewhat numb. Taste is very similar to biere de garde style with lots of spiciness but not much wineniness.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,Brent,4,Very reasonably priced for the quality. Nice balance of sweetness and peppery spice. Probably one that would grow on me after a few more bottles to get to know the beer.,Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,BKotch,4.29,"This is American? Whoa. Hennepin is the best American approximation of a Saison that I have ever had. Slightly cloudy golden brew that pours a big white head. Fruity sweetness (orange? lemon?) balanced by a good hop character in the finish. And, at a little over four bucks for 750 ml, what a deal!",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,mmthompson33,4.36,"Damn this is a good beer. Such a smooth light taste, but that Belgian strength and sweetness is still lingering there. A top quality beer for an unbelievable price.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,pbrian,4.84,"This is my first saison, so I have nothing to compare it to, but this beer is awesome. It usually takes me a couple of beers to warm up to a style, but I liked this one off the bat. Are all saisons this complex?",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,John,4.9,"A lighter, dryer brew than the Ommegang, but no less complex. Lemon, orange zest, spicey finish. There plenty going on with each swallow of this outstanding beer.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
42,141,AaronRed,4.76,"Fantastic Beer. Has a little cidery taste, but it works.",Brewery Ommegang,"New York, United States",Saison,92
