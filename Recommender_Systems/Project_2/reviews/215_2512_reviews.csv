215,2512,DFred,4.34,"Pours a deep, dark brown color with a large, creamy head that retains well. The aroma is sweet with notes of cherries, plum, spice, and a bit of perfume. On the palate, it has strong fruit flavors of plum and cherries, complemented by spicy and flowery elements, with a slight hint of caramel in the background. The mouthfeel is full and drying, with a sweet and warming finish. This Belgian Strong Ale is well-crafted, with an excellent balance of sweet and slightly roasted and bitter notes, a great body and mouthfeel, and a focus on malts and esters. A great example of the style.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Soft, smooth, lush and lightly syrupy mouth feel.  This is a very complex and strong sipper. As your glass warms the sweet fruity tastes get better and like an oporto.

Foamy white head persists in excellent form throughout leaving a ringed sheet of lacing.  Muted aroma, malty, not much else.  Well the taste is certainly not muted.

215,2512,nizzle8287,5,"Small Chimay blue bottle, with L22 on the back, which I gather means best before December 2022... meaning it this bottle about 5 years old, if I understand their dating system correctly. Poured into a large snifter at 50F. Pours between a hazy brown and amber, with 4 fingers of bubbly off-white head which reduces down to about a half-finger of very fine foam head which lasts. Very nice lacing. Smell is a complex bouquet of dark ripe fruit, signature Belgian yeast, and caramel. Reminiscent of a winter warmer style from some other brands, but ultimately more complex. Taste is slightly more complex than the nose, with figs, dark plum, caramel, and of course, all of this supported by the Belgian yeast flavor. Wheat and barley grains are noticeable, and provide an excellent foundation for all of those other complex flavors to ride on. Somewhat sweet, but very easy to drink. Feel is fairly carbonated, but less so than other Belgian beers I've tried. Perhaps this is due to the age of this bottle. Mouthfeel is full, but alcohol is barely noticeable. Not 'chewy' as some higher ABV brews are. Just has a very nice feel to it. Overall, I'd be doing those monks a disservice If I rated this beer anything other than a 5 across the board, so there it is: 5 across the board. Well done, monks.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

215,2512,Ant777uk,4.4,"Just bought in a bottle from my new local supermarket in Paris, never had before, not sure what to expect...  Bottle looks pretty cheap. Not expecting much...  Dark, deep, lingering foam...more even more beautiful than Guinness.  Aroma is natural, deep and inviting. Though a little too carbon dioxidey (in case you are foreign, that is not a word, I just created it...)  Very flavoursome, smooth and highly drinkable, for 9%. Reminds me of Christmas, even though it is August. Bitter, citrussy, loving it. Most stouts and dark beers are much too choclatey and heavy...this is still light, despite the high alcohol content. Definitely going to be drinking more of this. Unfortunately not tonight as my supermarket closes in 8 minutes and I live on the 7th floor with no lift, typical hardcore parisian style.  In Paris I remember I went to a bar opposite my apartment, ordered one of these...drank it in about 5 minutes...ordered another and drank it in 5 minutes. And then ordered another. The bitch French (Senegalese) bar maid told me that I had already had 2 and that now I can only have water. WTF!? So I went to a different bar. In England you could order 10 in 1 hour and they would love you for it.  Very good feel, it really zings in your mouth and the bubbles themselves have flavour. But not as amazing feel as some West Coast IPA's from America. However because of the smoothness and high alcohol content...and I guess premium ingredients...the high from drinking a few of these is amazing. Dark beers always keep you in control, unlike lagers, pilsners and IPA's. I have no idea why this is, maybe it's chromatics.  This beer is pretty cheap in Paris, and the best I have had so far that they sell locally. Will have to be careful as it probably will not mix too well with my current 7th floor no lift parisian style.  I would add that this beer is variable in my experience...  Although for me many West Coast IPA's are better than this overall, if I could only drink one beer for the rest of my life, I would probably choose this one.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,ItalianWarrior96,4.31,"I'm reviewing a bottle from 2021. At the sight it shows a dark brown color. As soon as it is poured into the glass, a very compact and balanced foam is formed. The nose is not particularly articulated, perhaps notes of cherry and spices as well as a strong hint of alcohol stand out. At the first sip all the sweet character of banana and chocolate comes out, which was a little covered on the nose and now is released. Overall, I was particularly struck by the strong and balanced flavor of this beer that I would approach very well with a tasting of cured meats and cheeses.

No bitterness. Some booziness, but not over-alcohol tasting at 9% ABV. Each taste changes a bit. Keeps you coming back for more.  F - Good carbonation. Medium thickness on mouthfeel.

215,2512,Sam88,4.77,This beer is a beautiful thing - a beautiful large head sitting atop a rich dark ale . With such a strong alcohol content it will certainly knock you out a bit but you wouldn't know it from the taste. Great fruity and caramel flavours - you can taste the history here.

215,2512,AlexandraDen,4.56,"Pours an opaque, deep dark brown with a slightly off white head that slowly grows to be over five inches thick. Over the course of a few minutes it slowly recedes to a creamy looking millimetre cap on top. Lovely looking beer.  I honestly thought I smelled aromas before I unbottled it. Lots of the typical notes are here, doughy and yeasty malt flavours, backed by a general sweetness and mild booziness, rum raisin cake, a deliciously deep and sweet savoury note, maybe dark chocolate covered dried dark fruits? Spices abound, hard to pick them apart, but you can always expect cloves and just a hint of liquorice. It’s really something else  The taste? It absolutely follows the nose, but the way it does it is what makes this such an experience to drink. Aside from what you get on the aromas, I’ll point out the most notable flavours. Bubbly, creamy, and boozy up front. You get hints of rum soaked, moist raisin cake. Spices hit you soon after and meld seamlessly, cloves nutmeg and liquorice are notable here. Deliciously yeasty and toasty caramel malts can be tasted throughout the sip and become quite notable at the end, augmented by the spices and sweetness, sort of tastes like you just had toasted bread with butter and cinnamon. Some dark cherry notes here and caramelized banana. Likely due to the high abv% mixing with the fruity esters and the caramel malt flavour, but it makes for some unique and tasty flavours. Perhaps just the slightest hint of general hop bitterness throughout.  Long and complex finish, which is mostly dry and fairly sweet. I didn’t pick up much bitterness myself. More lively carbonation than you might expect, but the carbonation is quite fine. Creates a creamy sip on the way down and prickles at your tongue. ABV% is slightly more noticeable than some other high alcohol beers, but it’s still masked well and the way you feel it with the flavours/it adds to your taste perception is a plus, honestly.  Phenomenal beer, honestly. Mine was a few months old, would love to try an aged one. I think it helped bring the effervescence down slightly judging by how carbonated some other reviewers said theirs were. I only have one more in my cellar, and this is a beer I would love to try at all life stages. Super fresh, a few months old, year or two old, and a super old cellared grandpa! Or maybe it’s just indicative that I want to drink a lot of this. Highly recommend this for anyone who loves any Belgian, or European beers. Or honestly, anyone who likes beers at all. It’s a must try!",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,Whyteboar,4.56,"Received this cellared version in a trade with @Providence - Date code is L11-545 So bottled in 2011? No idea, but he said it was old. Poured rather darker than expected for an Ale; almost cola brown. The manila colored head lasted a very brief time before retreating just to the circumference of the glass. The aroma was potent! Lots of dark fruit (Think figs and/or prunes) and a surprising amount of spice - almost akin to a Christmas ale - curious as I wasn't expecting that at all. The flavor follows, the malts lead the party but the spices (cinnamon, nutmeg?) want to play too. It may be my imagination but it seems they didn't want to get along. Didn't matter to me, I enjoyed it anyway. The feel was better than expected if this is indeed an 11 year old bottle. I would not have guessed that at all; but now I kick myself for not grabbing a fresher one for a side by side.

Smells of bready, caramel, slightly roasted malt dark fruit, with rich notes of raisin, plum and fig, as well as some chocolate, spice and hints of licorice. Taste is an excellent balance of bready, caramel, slightly roasted malt, chocolate and rich dark fruit, with notes of raisin, plum and fig, as well as distinct spice, with notes of clove, nutmeg, anise, licorice and just a hint of candi sugar and earthy, bitter hops. Finishes bittersweet, with a medium sweetness and some dark fruit and spice lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a rich body and medium carbonation.  This makes for a superb, rich and complex Belgian Strong Ale with an excellent balance of sweet and just slightly roasted and bitter notes, as well as a great body and mouthfeel. The focus is clearly on the malts and esters here, with a rich bready and caramel presence and distinct notes of dark fruit and spice, while subtle hops add just a touch of earthy, bitter notes to this that balances it out very nicely.

215,2512,UnoBeero,4.9,"Chimay Bleue is my favorite of the Chimay range. This is one of those beers you simply cannot turn down if offered to you.  Nose: Chocolate, cocoa, Christmas spices, nutmeg, cinnamon, minor citrus notes. Strong yet semi sweet malt aroma.  In the Glass: Like Red, this is a very dark full bodied ale, the color shows this strong character and it is a beautiful sight. Slight oily legs on the glass much like other full bodied ales.  On the Palate: You are met with a sweet malt flavor accompanied by cocoa, Christmas spices. Toffee and candied malted barley make up the body of this ale. This is easily the most complex and well balanced Dark Ale I have ever had.  Finish: Sweetness fades into a rounded malt with minor bitterness.  While this is most certainly a winter beer due to the spice character, I would enjoy this ale any chance I have.

Retention is shockingly short, given the Vesuvial geyser the ale emits.  Bouquet: A bulwark of Belgian yeast under a drizzle of brown rice syrup, precariously propped up on a tripod of wheat bread. A heel of browned, beer bread, sparsely pocked with raisins emerges late in the after-aroma.  Feel: Elegant, plush medium draped in a sprawling shawl of carbonation that keeps those baking spice flavors alive and signing. The linger is semi-sweet and bears a gentle touch of booze heat.  Taste: A gregarious greeting of Belgian yeast spiciness arrives, toting a tray of caramelized plantains, carefully dusted with cardamom, cloves, and allspice.

Realistically I could have found it at a different store closer to me, but I figured I might as well grab it anyways. I'm thrilled to try this one  Pours an opaque deep brown with 3 fingers of fluffy light tan head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing  The nose here is intoxicating, if not a bit simple for what it is. I'm picking up on aromas of plump raisin, brown sugar, overripe banana, brown bread, and toffee  It's definitely more spice forward in taste, but finds a nice balance between spice and fruity yeast. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting dark malt, black pepper, rich caramel, plum, and a touch of earthy hops. The swallow brings it back to more familiar territory, bringing notes of raisin, apple skin, toasted malt, candi sugar, and a touch of clove  A medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a surprisingly refreshing and light beer for the abv. Finishes mostly dry with a nice sweetness  A damn good beer! I can certainly see why it's considered a classic, better than the Rochefort 8 tbh.

T: Dark fruit and raisin flavors dominate with a tinge of spice, yet not as spiced as many Belgian holiday offerings.

Some partial lacing sheets left behind. Aroma of Belgian yeast, caramel malts, and raisin/date dark fruit. Taste is initially sweet with the caramel malt, followed by the dryness of the yeast. The raisin and date flavors swirl throughout. Kind of dry at the end, which follows because of the higher ABV%. Thicker mouth feel with the drying tug. Good carbonation. So good as an exploration into the Belgian yeast, with the other rich flavors of caramel and dark fruit. Easy to drink but conducive to sip and savor.

After switching vessels, the head now works as intended, receding into a thick dessert-like lacing. The bottle itself is made from thick expensive looking glass. The sound of the cork popping off is a real party starter.  S: It is well developed and the yeast did lots of work. The nose resembles candied prunes, par for the course of Belgian strong ale.  T: Roasty toasty malty notes. Not bitter as I anticipated, but bitter enough to counterbalance the caramelized sweetness of the malt. This is delicious beyond my expectations.

In the front of the palette this ale seems slightly sour and bitter. Though, in the back of the palette, this ale seems sweet. This offering is interesting and mysterious.  M - Pleasantly full yet non-lingering. This brew is dry but refreshing.  D - I wouldn't consider this a session beer due to its higher alcohol content.

215,2512,GarrettB,4.06,"October 2rd, 2015 - On the long list of Trappist ales to taste this is the last of the evening, after the grandiose luminaries like St Bernardus 12 and Westvleteren 12. The Chimay Blue has the range and availability of the Bernardus but the pedigree of the Westy, and has some of flavors that keep beer drinkers in the hobby from Age 21 to 91. This bottle has a bottle that starts with a little cheesy fink and some mushroom, but with a slight peach sweetness. And the taste is very similar, though with a bedding of grain flavors underneath like a saison, and reeking of the penurious delight of light grain. It is simple, parsimonious, elegant and nearly perfect, with a rue and swirl of molasses in just the aftertaste, but disappearing as quick as they appear.  9/11/2007 - Focus, focus, focus. All these Eastern religion crazes and astrological ombudsmen always blather on about focus, finding one’s center and maintaining spiritual energy at the nexus and vertex. Everything from urban development to cake decorating is centered around…well, the center. Proper balance has become a higher art, put into form in everything, including beer making. And that paragon of centered flavor and palate is the Chimay Blue. What a beautiful beer; beautiful in its precarious balance. The color is like a light baby bear’s fur, and the foam a casual light tan color. The whole appearance is gentle and soft, picturesque to anybody with a disposition to tactile experience. The smell is extraordinarily complex, fuming with copious yeast and some teriyaki sauce. I must say, the aroma is quite mild, not unlike the taste. The flavor is just light enough to match perfectly with the palate. The whole flavor compound lingers on the tongue for a long time, allowing the drinker to take his time and really immerse himself in the Chimay Blue experience. It lets one center themselves, finding the same coveted balance that the brewers at Chimay instill in their signature beer.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

215,2512,officerbill,4.71,"A deep, rich brown with a thick and creamy dark tan head. Smooth and full over your tongue with a little bit of sweetness in the middle and enough tang at the end to clear it of of your tongue. Malt, fig, plum, some spices I can't identify, and maybe a hint of chocolate; it's easy to taste that this started out as a Christmas ale. The blue Chimay edges out St. Bernardus as my favorite dark abbey ale because it goes with food a little better (this ale with a good reuben is a match made in heaven). It is a little on the pricier side, but well worth it. This will probably be the best Belgian dark ale you'll ever taste.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,Davedrinkinbeer,4.43,"11.2 oz bottle poured into a St. Bernardus Chalice. Look is very dark red, almost black with an off-white 1/2"" head that remains. Smell is vibrant-- mostly candy sugar, malt, spices, plum, fig, and other fruits. Taste is very complex and well blended, with all the ingredients coming together and only spice and malt come out at the middle and end of taste. Mouthful is very even, moderate carbonation, with little aftertaste and mild stickiness.  This is only my 2nd bottle of the Grande Reserve that I have tried, it is a little pricey (around $6.50 a 11.2oz bottle) but this is a very good ale. Highly recommended!",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

215,2512,Tomais,4.2,"2017 bottle. Today 2019-01-31. I've tried this a few times and found it too sweet for my tastes: I'm no expert beer reviewer, and do have a preference for pils, so this is foreign to me. Then I tried it one time with a ripe characterful raw milk brie cheese, and I loved it. This time round the bottle is a little older (not sure if that a factor). the cheese isn't so good, but I'm loving the beer: sure it's sweet -- but it's complex sweet -- and there's a perfectly balancing bitterness comes through after. Carbonation is very fine, like bottle conditioned, the phrase 'melt in your mouth' came to mind -- not logical yet I found myself sipping again and again to get that wonderful smooth prickly mouthfeel with that lovely bitter finish.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,KooVee,4.24,"Bottle, 2018.  Deep amber, lace.  Drive-by aroma is full of pear. Very strong and distinct. Taking a deeper sniff broadens that to phenols reminding me of Duvel.  Taste continues to concentrate on the fruit and the phenols with a bit of alcohol. Body is moderate, carbonation just right. A complex but not imposing bitterness envelopes the tongue, mixing a bit of hop-derived with yeast-derived notes. In a version this young, the phenols are still a bit rough around the edges, especially as the beer warms up. Alcohol is therefore a bit too prominent.  I wish this site allowed an easier way to review different ages of a beer. This one is still too clumsy to live up to its potential, yet it is already a very good classic. Having tried to clone Chimay myself, the nimbleness of this is actually quite impressive. The yeast very easily produces over the top aromas. Which gets tiring.

S: Soothing, sweet and creamy, with soft notes of brown sugar, vanilla and coconut held up by rich almond and black cherry, prune and fig. The base of the finish is soothing oat bread with clove, tobacco and a hint of toffee, with toasted acidic notes trailing off like sourdough crust.  T: Nutty almond swirls dives into sweet vanilla and creamy macadamia nut, beaching on a shore of dried apricots and raisins where coconuts and tobacco are getting toasted nearby on an oak fire.

Crumbling down to a nice even layer, it puts off a rich decadent brandy or port-like scent; dark sweet fruits and quite boozy (9% abv). Deep dark golden brown appearance is perfect. It glows a fiery red orange with a phone light behind it, while tiny bubbles race to the top.  Taste follows nose; sweet, rich candied plums with and added alcohol punch, but a perfectly crisp dry finish. Decadent.  My favorite aspects of Chimay Grande Reserve Ale are its crispness and dryness, which fight to overcome the rich sweetness. A little too sweet out front and a bit too much alcohol smell for me, but certainly top notch for sure. I should have warmed this up a bit longer, I think. The malts seem to start showing up as it warms.  May be perfect for a Christmas or New year party, after smashin favorites first.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,stortore,4.29,"750 ml bottle into a tulip snifter. Had 1/13/17.  Pours a dark brown, a little garnet on the edges in the light, fairly opaque, with a huge three inch foamy head on an average pour. Lots of foamy lacing. The smell is Belgian yeast, candi sugar, caramel, dates, figs, malt, some spices- cloves, for one. Light black pepper in the head, a little cola aroma. The taste is also strong on the yeast, much more malt than the nose, caramel, figs, candi sugar, dates. A quick flash of light bitterness up front. Smooth, creamy, a solid, medium body, well carbonated- a little on the high side.  A classic and top notch Belgian Strong Dark, with well blended flavors and a big, complex aroma. This is a beer everyone should try.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

215,2512,wmartin,4.16,"Chimay Blue, one of the world's great beers, or so they say.  I've been trying various versions of this beer over the last 2 years. I've had 5 samples of it, each one has been different in some way. Review rating is based on the 750ml bottle dated 2017 sourced direct from Belgium in March. This version has a different label than 750ml bottle bought at the same time in the U.S. dated 2016, which was imported into Texas.  The first copy of the beer I had was a 12 oz bottle from a bottle shop. I was disappointed as it had a cardboardy flavor. Cardboard flavor is indicative of a beer well past its prime, yet this beer should store well for half a decade. Perhaps it had been on that shelf in the bottle shop for a decade, or stored at 80 degrees F for awhile. Both those things are possible.  The next sample was from a 12 oz bottle in a restaurant. I found this quite good, but not one of my favorites. The characteristic Trappist yeast flavor and fruity nose, combined with some maltiness; is what made it good. Still, I wouldn't say it was spectacular. Hard to see what all the fuss was about.  But I persevered. The next sample I had at a tap room in Seattle that had around 150 taps. I asked what version of Chimay they had. When the waitress came back and said ""Chimay Reserve, Blue""; I immediately bought a glass. It came in a Chimay chalice. The person I was with, who doesn't like beer, stated that it really looked good. It was quite a site with it's glittering glass, frothy foam, and brownish orange color. And drinking it was a fantastic experience. One of the best beers I've ever had. The memory of it lingered the rest of the week, despite having a couple other great beers afterwards.  On that, I obtained a couple 750ml bottles from a US distributor hoping that the larger size would be more resilient to storage issues, and more like the draft version. While I initially enjoyed these bottles, a soapiness to the flavor began to bother me, and left a disagreeable memory. I was beginning to despair at being able to repeat the Seattle experience. These bottles were dated ""2016"" on the cork.  I found a Belgium site that would ship direct to the U.S. and got a 750ml bottle of the Belgium version, which I just drank moments ago. This bottle was dated on the cork and label as ""2017"". And it had no soapy taste whatsoever. I wouldn't say it was up to the level of the Seattle version as the fruity notes were not as pronounced, but I loved it and will probably get some more (direct from Belgium if possible). I don't know if the difference between this one and the US labeled one was because one was 2017 and one was 2016, because they ship inferior stock to the US, or because of storage issues; but I think that the fact that the Belgium-sourced sample was a year younger is a good sign for getting things direct from Belgium.  The Seattle on-tap sample would be a 5; but obviously consistency is something of a problem.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

The bottle has been cellared for a good handful of months however I lost track :)  Look: Excellent appearance from the colour to the head (given the style). It pours a clear dark brown with red highlights. One finger of foamy, tan head that settles to an impressive cap after three minutes. The cap remains until your last sip. Poor lacing... and here I thought my glass was beer-clean...?  Smell: Quite strong an aroma with notes of caramel, banana, Belgian yeast, brown bread, and dark fruits. Hints of peppery spice and herbal hops to improve the overall balance. There's no doubt the malts and esters are here to shine.  Taste: Exactly what the aroma promises. Intense and balancing towards sweet. Not cloying. Prominent estery notes of dark fruit and banana as well as bready malts, and caramel. Absolutely delicious.  Feel: Medium-full body with high carbonation. Creamy, warming, and prickly with a smooth alcohol-warmth.  Overall: Fantastic example of the style.

Dark fruits, particularly cherry, dominate the smell. There is also a sour smell, reminiscent of an oud bruin. This smell is less noticeable as the beer warms. Dark fruits also dominate the taste. The sourness in the smell is not present. A sweetness in the middle of the tongue is followed quickly by a bitterness on the swallow. There is no sign of the 9% abv.

215,2512,DaverCS,4.64,"2016 (1 year) versus 2013 (4 year).  2016: Aroma is of Belgian yeast/ spice, some honey, caramel, and a bright citrus note.  Taste is nicely carbonated with a moderate mouthfeel. Nice malt character, dark fruits (prune and raisin), a slight spice, and pleasant citrusy finish.  2013:  Aroma is alluring. Cold, it smelled of pure apple juice. As it warmed, pear and a ton of prune juice were noted.  Taste is much lighter and almost thinner than the 2016. Very effervescent. The Belgian spice and yeast notes are a little muted. Still ample dark fruits and citrus.  Overall, regardless of age, this is a phenomenal example of the style. I found four years to be too much, as the beer became a bit too thin, but the aroma on the 2013 was far more complex. From this, I would say a 2 year age would be my reccomendation.

215,2512,Everydayoff,4.28,"330ml bottle poured into a chalice. This one is 2015 reserve.  Deep ruby brown hue, the pour quickly builds up majestic light tan creamy head that doesn’t go anywhere until the last sip with its exceptional strength of retention. The head looks very silky smooth and so velvety. There is vast amount of sticky lacing ring and wave along the way down.  Mild estery affair reminds me of prune, raisin, and dark cherry. Malt is biscuity, dough, caramelized, yet sometimes chocolate and toasted. Sugar, honey, treacle, spice, and floral notes draw down to add in more complexity.  The mellow fruity ester that exhibits in a nose also being displayed through the palate sensation with notes of prune, raisin, and dark cherry. Treacle, honey, and sugar sweetness reveal in the middle along with all those malty flavors of toasted bread, biscuit, slight chocolate, and caramel. Big phenol and spice is at the end together with peppery and medicinal hint while some hop bitterness also reinforces in the finish. The aftertaste is long-lasting with spice, bitter, sweet, and slight fruity touch.  Medium to full body with some bold touch through the palate, carbonation is quite low but it is crisp enough to carry all the things well under the smooth mouthfeel and pleasant palate. Finish is very dry.

Nice balance of flavors, you can't taste it's a 9% apv(!!) beer. It's very smooth on the tongue, nice warm feel in the throat. The aftertaste is of nuts and chocolate. Overall I would return to this beer, it is nice example of a dark Belgium beer, it proofs once again trappist beer is on the top of the league, these monks know how to brew beer.

The head is beige and soapy, very thick, and retains a half-finger's width, leaving some spots on the glass.  The aroma is of honey-wheat brown bread. It's got honey sweetness, and a background of yeast and banana chips. Maybe some raisin. As the beer warms, the banana chip aroma becomes more pronounced. No alcohol on the aroma.  The taste is the same as the aroma. No alcohol. The bitterness is mild to none.  The mouthfeel is medium to heavy and carbonated.  The finish is somewhat dry.  Overall, this beer is more mild than, say, St. Bernardus Abt. 12, both in flavor and aroma, as well as alcohol level. Yet, it costs more in the areas in which I've seen both products.

Nice malty and fruity aroma with notes of prunes, molasses, orange marmelade, coconut, vanilla, figos and mild Port wine.

Very complex flavor with notes of prunes, molasses, peppery yeast, cloves, noble hops, burnt coconut, umami, toasted malts, cinnamon, apple puree, candi sugar, rose petals, a bit of banana and vineous fruits. I should stop looking for fruther notes. Finishes smoothly dry with a medium bitterness. Bordering full body with velvety carbonation. I didin’t feel its 9% alcohol at this point.

215,2512,MikeA21,5,Chimay is the reason I drink craft beer. I was turned on to chimay about 20 years ago and it was very hard to find a beer as good until the last few years when craft beer has really become popular. The Grand Reserve has a bold strong flavor that keeps you coming back for more. It has a strong malt smell and pours dark with a good head. Their are many great beers around today but not many have been brewing as long as Chimay.,Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

The flavor is robust with a good kick of alcohol that hits you right away with flavors of dates, brown bread, and honey mixed in culminating in a spicy finish. The body is somewhere between medium and heavy. Everything about this beer is classic strong dark ale. It is really a nice drinking experience and everything is well balanced. My only criticism would be that it is maybe not as complex as I would have hoped. It’s rated 2nd for the style and I think it should undoubtedly be in the top 10 if not top 5, but it’s maybe very slightly overrated.

215,2512,teromous,3.66,No bottle or import date that I can see. The bottle I am reviewing is the 750ml corked and caged version.  Appearance: The body is dark brown that is completely opaque. Even in the light I don't get any color pinpoints. There is a bit of light that makes it through the bottom edge of the glass showing just a lighter version of the brown body. The head is thick and fluffy with a light tan color. It stays up for a while then gently fades to a short cap leaving some fine lacing in the glass.  Aroma: I get some bubblegum and a very light date aroma. Overall it doesn't have a lot of aroma and the dominant scent is bubblegum.  Taste: Very light flavors here to match the aroma. A bit of that bubblegum flavor mixed with a touch of sweet brown sugar. The finish is a very faint tea leaf flavor. The flavors are nice but faint.  Mouthfeel: The beer is exceptionally smooth and easy to drink. It is very well carbonated and the carbonation really helps to push the beer across the palate and deliver the light flavors to the corners of the mouth. Again the beer is very easy to sit back and enjoy because it has no rough edges whatsoever. I do wish it has a bit more of a finish.  Overall: It's a decent Belgian Strong Dark Ale. There are many other Belgian Strong Dark Ales that I would prefer over this one but preference is subjective. The light simple flavor and character of the beer would make it easy for anyone to enjoy.,Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

I couldn't readily tell whether any other breweries try to mimic this beer, but this beer's layered/stacked dark, fruity/roasty malt depth and lasting flavor is something the imitators often lack... while the malt underbelly is excellent, the fruity esters are a good bit smeared and foggy up top, kinda dying in the front of the palate and not contributing much to flavor structure definition, while a little bit of phenolic spice settles in the back... 4.25+  F: at first, a bit lighter and more spread out (centered flat) than expected... it loosens up and lends a more elastic flow as it warms... coiled viscosity, quiet heat, drawn out numbing... arguably unsung drinkability  O: haven't had this much in recent years, or even that much ever, to be honest - this might be the 4th or 5th time?...

215,2512,nout72,4.85,"Probably the best Trappist/Belgian strong dark ale and overall the best beer I ever tasted. I only recently came to that conclusion. Chimay blue is one of the 1st Trappist, stong beers I tried in my life. At that time, I was 17 years old, I liked beer, no matter what type and to me Chimay blue tasted just like a trappist, I couldn't exactly tell a difference with a Westmalle dubbel. Later I came to appreciate the differences, but to me Chimay still was just a trappist you could buy everywhere. Beers like Rochefort or St. Bernardus weren't readily available and just how it works in the mind, unknown, more rare beers always taste better. I have dismissed Chimay the last two decades, always chose Rochefort, St. Bernardus, La Trappe and recently Jopen Ongelovige Thomas over the blue labeled bottle. But Chimay blue beats all of them in my opinion. And for the biggest part because it leaves no strong sweet aftertaste. The aftertaste isn't exactly dry, but it doesn't stick too long. All the other trappist/abbey beers to a certain extent blurr or flatten the taste after a while. The best example is the Rochefort 8, the sweet aftertaste ruins the experience to me. Chimay has the ideal balance between sweet and bitter. It is smooth (non-boozy) like a Rochefort 10 and spicy like a St. Bernardus, and the amount of carbonation is spot on. True the sweetness isn't that round and smooth like a Rochefort 10, it is more stingy (for lack of a better word) but it leaves with little trace, therefore every new sip tastes great, not muted.  Do note: with this beer it really is important to serve it at a minimum temperature of 10 degrees Celcius, not any colder, because when served too cold the taste is watery and muted. I usually drink this beer at (slightly lower) room temperature, 17 up to 19 degrees Celcius works great for me.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

215,2512,Mindcrime1000,4.27,"Look--Pours a unique murky-copper with faint maroon highlighting that suggests a ""fruitiness"" right out of the gate. The highlighting isn't ""off-putting"" but it is a bit strange. The head and lacing dissipate almost immediately, which isn't uncommon with this style, so no ""mark down"" for that.  Smell--Agressive nose of dried fruit--fig, raisin, (prune perhaps?) with bready and banana notes that stay forward throughout the drinking experience. Almost reminds me of a banana bread with dried fruit. Unlike some better strong Trappists (i.e. Rochefort 8 or 10) this doesn't modify much as the beer warms.  Taste--Very smooth and drinkable considering the alcohol content, but is rather sweet and boozy compared to even stronger similar offerings. Unlike some others that develop a subtle bitter-chocolate note as they come up in temperature, this one just gets sweeter. The carbonation doesn't have quite enough staying power to provide some balance.  Feel--Warming in a very pleasant way, and very drinkable.  Overall--I like this one, but wouldn't rate it as high as a Rochefort 8 because it lacks that extra ""nuance,"" and stays a little too sweet throughout the drink.

215,2512,Beginner2,4.41,"During the course of my career, I have had this ale at least a dozen times. The bottle that is the basis for this review I kept for five years, about the length that some claims it is at its richest, fruitiest stage. I agree. What I might have done wrong with the other 11 copies is I drank it too soon; lacking patience. Age also tames the high carbonation that is signature to Chimay and only less so of its Trappist brethren. While this very minor flaw does recede after ten minutes, the second half of this bottle is better than the first for that reason. The flavors are richer as it warms and the bubbles become gently soft.  MJ's ""Great Beers of Belgium"" gives Chimay 4 pages. But then, he really likes the Trappists. MJ's 1999 ""Guide"" gave Blue 4 of 4 stars (very rare) and talked at length about how the fruitiness mellows with age. As one of the most frequently reviewed beers in the world, it is on the ""1001"" list and Bleue deserves to be there. And to complete my classics, Roger Protz' ""300 Beers To Try Before You Die!"" gives 1&2/3 pages to the Chimay lineup. Roger tells the Chimay story almost as well as MJ and describes Bleue as having vinous notes similar to Zinfandel. That's serious.  Chimay also has an entry in the ""The Oxford Companion to Beer"" (2011 edited by Brooklyn's Garrett Oliver.) The entry is a bit longer and worth a read, but mostly reinforces the above master reviewers. (Original research must be hard to find on Chimay.)  6/24/17 Bottled in 2015 (see cork.) Maybe this gets better with age, but it is great right now. Had with my world famous ratatouille stew and lamb. Increased rating because Feel truly is exceptional and Overall because I want to have this again. Maybe I will hold it for 4 years and double my patience.  4/22/20 Earth Day, a fitting tribute ! In the intervening three years, I've had several more copies and did not feel the need to change the rating. And I have said enough in my review and can't add to the 2,447 others currently on BA. So hence, I am keeping count over at Untappd.  2/7/21 I guess I'm not fully at UnTappd, given the depth of Bleue. I also just noticed that Chimay's Espace was not on my BBBL (Belgian Brewers Bucket List) and add it now, probably as a my #4 priority. I think it was the cheeses that brought me home.

Huge malt with a slight hop all while being very refreshing and pleasant to drink. Cracked one open on a cool humid night and is/was perfection. Pairs well with most foods and desserts but it pairs the best with itself (meaning opening more than one in a night). Great any day, any time of year and as often as you'd like to enjoy one.

215,2512,CanadianBacon,4.14,"Appearance - This beer pours almost a black color but the edges appear redish brown in direct light. It pours a 3 aad a half finger foamy off white head that just does not fade. Carbonation is extremely lively and very visible.  Aroma - The first smells to hit your nose are dark fruits, plum, raisin and fig are all there. Then you get a soft slightly burnt caramel undertone followed by spice and fresh baked white bread.  Taste - Again fig, raisin and plum hit the tongue first followed by a medicinal phenolic taste. then you get burnt caramel and toffee followed by pepper and fresh baked bread. Apon swallowing you get a strong boozy warmth.  Feel - medium-light body with carbonation that tingles and is creamy at the same time, a boozy warmth finishes off this feeling.  Overall - This is a very good Belgian dark ale. As far as trappist ales go I've had some blondes and tripels that surpass it in my tastes. I prefer light fruits to dark fruits though, With that said this has to be up there with rochefort 8 as one of the better strong dark ales. The flavors mesh very well and It is rather smooth. I just feel like they could have hidden the boozyness better. Either way I guess this way it makes for a better winter beer to come home to on a cold day.

The aroma is bready, earthy, fruity and minerally. The flavor has a distinct maltiness, suggesting a gingerbread cookie. Also apparent is a spicy apple-raisin fruitiness, and a lemony tartness on the finish. A peppery bit of spice and pucker punctuate the flavor, while a light earthy funk underlies it all. A little boozy warming is apparent, and perhaps a touch of spicy alcohol bite. Vinous, port-like notes and dark fruit hints become more pronounced as the beer warms. The mouthfeel is frothier than one might expect.  This is obviously a world class beer worthy of its reputation.

I am getting caramel and red wine esters.  T: [4.00] The taste follows the nose with a nice rich caramel taste. This beer has a really solid malt build that gives some toast flavors in the middle.

M: [4.00] Nice carbonation. Slick mouthfeel, maybe a tad on the watery side though. There is no sense of the 9% ABV.  O: [3.75] This bottle has aged for almost a year. I have never had the beer fresh - but this is really good. The primary flavor is a caramel that is very appealing. As mentioned above there is no flavor of Belgian yeast (which I dislike).

Despite the label's prescribed drinking temperature of 12 degrees Celsius, I poured the beer straight from my fridge which is just around 2 degrees C. I noticed that the boozy character thinned out as the beer warmed and more dark fruit came through. I definitely recommend that you let this one warm (to about 12 C) before consuming.

Moreover, thanks to the carbonation, the head retention is perfect.  Smell: I could smell some hints of roasted, but not smoked, hops. You can sense the smooth bitterness.  Taste: Despite its high ABV, I didn't taste the alcohol, which is a good sign. The beer has a bouquet flavours which encompasses black currants, honey, caramel and roasted hops. There were also some hints of coffee at the back end.  Feel: The beer is not as creamy as Trappistes Rochefort 8 is on our palate. However, it is an easy drinking beer with a sublime taste.

I cannot tell what the carbonation looks like in the murkiness but I can tell you all that the lacing of this one is subdued and the foam quickly slides back into the glass. Not bad overall!  S- Toffee, caramel, blackstrap molasses, dark maple and cooked brown sugar probably round out the initial aroma profile. Dark fruits like plum, raisin, fig are present and there are notes of dark chocolate and some muted coffee tones as well....very balanced smelling Ale for sure!  T- This is dark and delicate overall.....flavors follow suit to the aromas quite well, with the dark fruits taking over initially but the chocolate and coffee tones are quite noticeable.....the sweetness found in the aromas sharpens into a deeper darker suculent version of themselves....the toffee and molasses is much more noticed! The finish is somewhat dry and of Earthy spices....awesome!  M/O- The carbonation of this one really explodes well on the palate, allowing the full spectrum of the complex flavors to show themselves individually. The body is medium/full and the rich balanced nature of this one is something to sit back and think about!

First scent is grape juice and figs and hints of burnt brown sugar. Fruit scents are really bursting here. Smells like it's going to be sweet.  Taste is richer than the scent, bright fruit juices turn to dried fruits like prunes and dates and Thompson raisins. Baking spices for a rum cake roll over the tongue. Reminds me of traditional German Christmas desserts Kompot and Stollen. Finish is booze burnt caramel, and I may detect a little bitterness for half a second.

Spare lacing and a fringe of foam persist.  Smell: Roasted grains, dark fruit (raisins, dates), spice and hints of alcohol.  Taste: Full, roasted malt body; dark fruit, earth, vanilla, tobacco and slight bitterness. Finishes relatively crisp and dry.  Mouthfeel: Medium body with relatively lively carbonation giving an airy, creamy feel.

Very nice lacing throughout the drink. The aroma is malty with definite fruity undertones. The taste is exceptional even for a Trappist ale. It starts with a sweet maltiness that has real grapey undertones. The taste ends with an alcohol hit that is ameliorated by the fruitiness. It feels almost perfect in the mouth with some real body, nice carbonation, and a lingering taste of fruit. I rate this down a little in drinkability just because of the alcohol content. It is drinkable from first drop to last.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Not much lacing, but the head has legs.  S - A strong front of pears and apples, a hint of orange, grape must, and cherry. Spices include allspice and clove.  T - The fruit opens, with baked apples and poached pears, stone fruits, and raisins the main elements. The middle turns to doughy goodness, a baked confection of spice and bread, with a hint of citrus. The close dries some, still sweet but with a steeped tea note as balance.  M - Moderate carbonation and mild drying keep this from becoming cloying, but the beer is a serious, somewhat heavy affair.  O - The various flavors and counterpoints make for an exceptional Belgian, powerful and full, but balanced and pleasurable.

Beautiful 2 finger head that leaves incredible lacing on the side of the glass.  Smell: Soft notes of plum, sweet date, molasses, and dark corn syrup along with notes of banana, clove, and plum.  Taste: Yeast notes really shine in this one- the darker fruity notes mentioned in the smell are really quite assertive here. Dates, plum, banana, and clove seem to dominate the flavor and it's all glued together by a nice caramel/molasses touch. Magnificent balance and drinkability for an otherwise strong beer.  Mouthfeel: Silky on the tongue, but stronger carbonation than I expected.  Overall: A great beer, no doubt, but honestly, one that seems to be hyped up a bit. For a Belgian Strong Dark Ale, several Unibroue beers seem to compete strongly against this and might even edge it out, especially Trois Pistoles.

215,2512,MrDell,4.73,"10.10.15  Chimay Grande Réserve (Blue) – Year: 2014 Best Before: 2019  Aroma: Moist dark fruit like currants and raisins that have been soaked in brandy overnight. Fairly strong alcohol on the nose.  Appearance: This was very lively when opened and I lost a quarter of the bottle to the sink unfortunately, which seems strange as I have had this beer many times before and that’s the first time its happened – same situation with the Chimay bruin I had from the same box earlier this evening. Anyway, beer had a lively two finger off white head when poured into glass, the head soon disappeared leaving just one patch above the etching of the official Chimay glass. Colour is brown / very, very deep red, almost purple. I’m surprised at how little head there is on the beer now, just 10 minutes after opening it. Although it still looks great with its bright colour.  Taste: Yet again, this is another fantastic brew balanced brew from Chimay. Taste is as aroma, its got the dark fruits followed by a lovely warming bit of alcohol then a nice dry hop finish. There is, as with many of these dark sweet Belgian ales, the dark molasses treacle taste. I have been drinking a lot of trappists and strong dark ales recently and this is up there with the best of them.  Mouth feel: Like the Chimay dubbel, this is relatively low in body for the style, but again it works. Quite a dry finish.  Overall: I have sampled one of each of the three main Chimay beers this evening as I had a gift box with a bottle of each in it and while they are all obviously different stylistically, one can tell that they are from the same family. You just know, whether looking you are looking at the bottle, opening and pouring the beer into the lovely chalice glass or taking in the aroma and tasting, that you are dealing with a high quality product. I think that because the Chimay range is produced in such quantity and is so widely available and reasonably priced, the beers often get overlooked for what they are – some of the best in the world. 10/10.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

I used to drink these all the time, so surprised I don't have any reviews. A great way to kick it off with a nice big grande reserve 2012 vintage.  Pours a decent looking fizzy bubbly, lots of bubbles, hits a finger surprisingly, but fades back fairly quickly, foamy lacing, murky darker mahogany ruby color, some sediment as well.  NOse is very rich, loaded with dark dried fruits, fig, date, raisin, plum, etc, nice fruity aromas, with some mild booze warmth, and attached are the nice phenols expected from the style. Surprisingly not sweet and sugary, perhaps the age helped, a little candi sugar and touch of molasses brown sugar but not much, mild toasted nuts and touch of a coffee syrupy kinda note, actually more like dark caramel . Then a mild apple note, with touch of booze and sweet candy, a bit apple brandy like aroma.  Taste brings lots of sweet candy, tons of it but not super sweet, but syrupy nonetheless, lots of candi sugar and molasses, brown sugar and caramelized sugars as expected. Then fruits, again tons of the dark fruits, fig and date right out front, candied raisins with brown sugar, plum juice, etc, again followed closely with the nice phenols and mild warming booze. The dark caramel and brown sugar add nicely to the fruits. Nice soft aged malts, brown malts with plenty of caramel and a mild biscuit toffee, actually decent toffee with a mild nutty flavor, toasted etc. Again a mild apple brandy flavor as well but mostly in the backend. Finish is a bit drier, mild candy lingering, lots more brown sugar and dark caramel, mild booze and phenols, lingering dark fruits as well and a touch of booze.  Mouth is med o heavier bod but syrupy, mild warming tingly booze, dry non-sticky finish somehow, nice carbonation too.  Overall a big time winner, the staple for a great quad or Belgian strong dark style, esp good with some nice age on it. Great dark fruits, sweet flavors without being too sweet, mild syrupy but dry finish somehow, mild booze, nice level of phenols, nice malty character, just well done all around.

Although it was rich and dark it did not overpower the beer into something of a required taste. Nice and smooth without any real taste of the %.  F: It had a really smooth feel and went down easily.

Nice, but somewhat light, nose of dark fruit (mostly raisin and date), grape and hints of cherry over caramel.  Light full bodied with a creamy texture. Normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence in the finish.  The flavor profile is intense, slightly complex but not well balanced due to the lack of alcohol coverage. The aroma flavors are present, but get overwhelmed by alcohol. It begins with dark fruit, then light caramel, over an underlying tobacco element.

215,2512,BethanyB,4.28,"Look: A fluffy gold crown rests atop a churning haze of dark honey. You can practically see the viscosity of this famously ""big"" beer, which in true Belgian style, leaves the glass covered in lace.  Smell: Brings to mind the song ""Elegantly Wasted."" The pungent scent is very much like a strong champagne cocktail. It is boozy yet bright, with a balanced cornucopia of both dark and light orchard fruit--dates, apricots, cherries, pears. Some oaky notes add to the alcoholic richness, and as the beer warms, it reveals some luxurious accessories in the form of rosemary, cloves, and cinnamon.  Taste: The initial taste is of tart golden apple cider topped off with a splash of bitters, but sweet and tangy apricot marmalade quickly takes over, and sticks around through the finish like honey. Caramel and brown sugar are curbed by a slightly harsh cherry cordial flavor. There are many strong competitors here, including a bell pepper taste associated with young red wine, but the malty flavor of freshly baked bread soaks them up in such a way that they are kept at a reasonable volume.  Mouthfeel: A satiny mouthfeel is clipped by an impactful dryness and sharp carbonation. The alcohol is so apparent in the taste, that it is less apparent on the throat and tongue.  Overall: This beer is all about juxtaposition, with clashing characteristics rising to such an intensity that they are on the verge of not quite blending. And yet, blend they do, when all is said and done. Chimay Grand Reserve is like a couture gown. It makes you cock your head and go, ""huh?"" for a second, but then all you can hope to do is marvel at its extravagant beauty.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Smell - Malty grain aroma is pretty strong here, plenty of brown sugar smells. Prune, raisin, apricot, plum and mild apple with some banana.  Taste - The flavor here is rather grape like almost towards a wine beer hybrid. There is light spice, mild smokey wood nuts and biscuit which combine to make a complex deep flavour that makes this immensely drinkable. There is also an abundance of fruit in the flavour here following from the nose prune, raisin, apricot, mild peach, plum, slight apple and finally some banana. There is also notes of honey in here making this a seriously flavorsome beer.  Mouth feel - Full and creamy this beer has some pretty good boozy warming tingle combined with the CO2 so there is a lot of activity in the mouth. There is a pretty cloying end to this beer as it is very sweet but it boasts some serious linger.  Overall - This beer is deeply complex in its flavour but it has some downfalls in the mouth feel so that it lost some marks there for me.

Big, frothy head with considerable staying power.  Smell: Big malt up front, and quite sweet with it. Some toffee/caramel and burnt sugar notes too, with some vinegar as it warms up a bit. Overall, it smells as dark as it looks.  Taste:Very yeasty and malty up front with a certain booziness about it too, although at 9% ABV that's probably a given anyway. Others have noted a fruity finish but I can't honestly say that I got much of that, although there was a bit of vinegariness there. The malts run all the way through, although they're not as apparent in the finish. Not a massively complex taste profile.  Feel: Eminently drinkable, almost dangerously so. You've got to hand it to those monks, they've got the brewing thing down pretty much solid. Must be those years of practice and contemplation.  Overall: It's Chimay, so I was always going to like it.

Cloudy brown in color, appearing downright murky. Aroma of red wine, fresh baked bread, dates, and a very subtle spice note. This beer definitely was aiming for more of the dark fruit notes found in quads v.s the spicy phenolic notes. On the palate the maltiness comes through more but the dark fruit hangs around too. Bready and rich on the palate. Finish is of dark caramelized fruits. Alcohol doesn't even exist in this beer. It leans on the sweet side but still maintains a nice balance.

215,2512,BradtheGreat7,4.33,"Review taken from notes Spring 2014. I've jotted down notes on more than 7 occasions with this brew.  750 ml brown Chimay trapping style bottle. Corked and capped in typical Chimay style. Label is blue in color featuring many great Belgian trappist monk artwork I have no less than loved from the beginning of kt craft beer days. Poured into an authentic Chimay trappist goblet.  A - massive head on the pour which displays a very unique tan color which you'll only find on authentic trappist dark ales. It settles after what seems like forever and leaves a thick ring of lacing leaving incredible like stick. Body color is trappist brown with hints of the brown side of dark, mahogany ruby gleaming through when held to the light. Yeast sediment and particles are at full force and only add to the experience.  S - doughy bread like yeast with a buttery sweet caramel note that's simply a trademark of Chimay. A nice semi hoppy note of orange peel and a faint whiff of ripe apple. The more Chimay Blue warms dark fruit really sets within the nose. A mild whiff of alcohol and spice in the background. A simple yet pleasing trappist aroma.  T - the flavor really takes on the simplicity of the nose and hammers home great monk style taste. Sticky, sweet, buttery caramel let off a near candy corn note within the mouth. Doughy Chimay style yeast with big dark fruit flavor. A soft candied orange note creeps up followed by a mild alcohol and spice finish. Delightful flavor.  M - upper medium in body. Displays spot on thickness as intended in this monk brewed ales. Just a perfection of a body for the style. A semi dry spiciness in the finish. Mild alcohol warming that adds even more depth and complexion to the mouthfeel.  O - Chimay Grand Reserve or Chimay (Blue) as most refer to it as, is a simple yet world class Belgian Strong Dark ale and really the perfect option to begin with exploring bigger Trappist ales. It's been a real favorite of mine since our first encounter, and one I'll grab on a few more than special occasions every year. Just a classy ale from a classy brewery.

Medium white head with fine bubbles. Slightly cloudy from the yeast still in suspension.  S - Lots of the typical Belgian yeast spice character (phenolic) predominant. Just underneath that are the strong malt and caramel tones with some fruit character like dark cherry. No hops but this beer isn't made for it.  T - Very similar to the smell the Belgian character holds true but isn't the only player with lots of malty goodness sitting on a bed of the caramelized sugars. Has a lot of sweetness but the spice character helps and It's a complex beer that gets even more complex the more your tongue gets used to the Belgian flavors and it warms pulling you more in to the depths of this Belgian strong ale.  M - Full mouth-feel that isn't too cloying. Has some light bitterness and finishes complex with an aftertaste that isn't exactly the same as the flavor but doesn't stick to your entire mouth. Light carbonation making the flavors sit longer on the tongue letting you take in all of the complexity.  Overall, an amazing beer that has such depth and intrigue. Not a beer that I could drink more than 2 of but it is a delicious beer that I would strongly recommend. There is plenty to discover in this bottle and I would get this again.

The (cider-like) body is cloudy and deep orange-ish brown in color; the light tan head is large and somewhat creamy. The flavor includes pronounced, bread-like malt and strong but smooth alcohol.

Expectations are high based on this beer's good ratings.  Poured into a Coca-Cola goblet.  A - It pours a beautiful reddish caramel colored body, very dark, with lots of particulate yeast sediment floating in the glass. About two fingers of bubbly foamy tan head that fizzles it's way out of existence. No lacing on my goblet. Looks very nice, either way. 4  S - I hate goblets for their lack of aroma, but I'm picking up notes of toffee, caramel, dark fruit, Belgian candi sugar, and a hint of alcohol. 3.5  T - The taste is very delicious. Sweetened dark fruits - plums, raisins, figs, Belgian candi sugar, toffee / caramel, & a distinctive yeast character. A slight metallic / well water note is discernable, but neither distracting or off-putting. Very delicious. 4.5  M - The mouthfeel is smooth, rich, & creamy. I am absolutely in love with the feel of this beer; smooth enough that I could drink it all day. Perfect carbonation. Goes down ridiculously easy for a 9.00% abv beer.  Overall, an extraordinary example of the style, and I can't wait to try more of these. This has definitely changed my outlook on what a great Belgian style beer can be.

215,2512,Eric_Standard,4.85,"Appearance: Deep amber with an active, cream coloured head. Looks very rich.  Smell: Some bready notes over an undercurrent of slightly sweet autumn fruits – apples, raisins, and the like.  Taste: A sweetish wave of fruit and malt comes up front, followed by more bready notes with Belgian yeasts – a bit of sourness. The beer finishes out sweet, with more dark fruit notes, some caramelly elements, and a mild alcohol flavour that provides a nice warming and emphasizes some peppery, licorice-y flavours in the finish.  Mouthfeel: Exceptionally smooth, moderately heavy on the palate, very good.  Overall: A pretty exceptional beer – complex, interesting, well balanced and delicious. It goes very well alongside a nice chunk of Chimay à la Bière.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Appearance - a very overcast, deep red, almost brown with huge, foamy beige head that recedes rapidly to a thin layer. Lacing is minimal. Smell - stone and dark fruit, yeast and a hint of alcohol. Taste - a tempered sweetness resembling the stone and dark fruit in the nose. Slight spice and tang that elevate the flavor! Easy drinker at 9% that keeps calling for another sip! Feel - very carbonated, medium body with the alcohol making subtle appearances with each sip. A spicy and tangy bitterness, but a creaminess that adds an interesting layer to this dynamic brew!

It's, sweet, fruity, and also slightly peppery, with the faintest hint of bitterness; it's heavily spiced and smells strongly of cloves.

Poured into goblet from 0.75L bottle. Appears very dark brown with a tinge of auburn when held up to a light. No real head to speak of, but little carbonation bubbles are pretty consistent. Nose is sweet. Raisin, red wine, and preserved plum are scents that I am reminded of. Bready yeast is also in there. Taste is not as sweet as the nose in my opinion. Malt even comes through with some roasty, coffee like bitterness in the midst of the toffee sweetness and bready and yeasty flavors. Mouthfeel is perfect with a nice amount of carbonation and a long lasting almost syrupy finish. I love this beer.

I expected stronger flavors from this beer (not sure why), but was instead impressed by how tasty the beer was without being powerful. I guess this is some definition of balance.  The beer was a dark amber, with decent carbonation and a fair to good head retention. The smell wasn't too strong, but a bit of raisin bread, maybe some fig.  The taste was very smooth and light, actually. There was a light sweetness, date-like taste over a typical abbey ale yeast flavor. There is also a nice carbonation to this pour which plays on the tongue with a light, neutral bitterness to end the taste.  Overall, I might say this is slightly on the sweet side, but it's distinction to me is in the balance and ability to produce a little depth in a balanced beer.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

There is a certain earthy/meaty/smoky aroma that I can't quite identify that smells appealing.  T - Raisins, dates, black mission figs, and other dark dried fruits are very forward. Note highly sweet in that sense, but more rich with a bit of fermentation tartness. Licorice/anise seed flavors are very mild but present on the finish.

Poured into a Gotlands Bryggeri weissbier glass.  A - Dark, opaque brownish red. Not cloudy yet still opaque with a light held up to it. Clearly a heavy brew  S - Malty, sweet smell with hints of yeast. It almost reminds me of molasses. Very strong. Kind of gave me a headache after too many wafts, but exactly what I would look for in this style.  T - First it is very sweet and a little fruity. Then the malt's presence overwhelms the sweetness. Almost no hint of bitterness or hops. Although, the strong dark ale is 9%, I couldn't even notice an alcohol taste.  M - Creamy and a little bit thick from the all the malt. Although the opening brought a fizz over, a perfect mild carbonation.  To be honest, this is probably the best beer I have tasted to date.

Dried dark fruits, Christmas cake, chocolate covered cherry, hickory smoke, pumpernickel, allspice and walnut are all mixed together in an intense blend of flavor components.

Perhaps the high cost reflex of paying for an unknown beer was too much for this old man. Since I was feeling intimidated by the beer purchase, I put it aside for a few weeks until the moment was right. Sure enough the stars aligned and everything was going my way. I sat down to watch a good movie with my better-half, minus the nagging. Then made the perfect sandwich with Smoked turkey breast, applewood-smoked bacon, smoked Gouda, lettuce, tomatoes and Chipotle Sauce on freshly baked Tomato Basil Sourdough Bread with sweet crumb topping, but you didn't come here for all of that.  So I slightly chuckled at the thought of pulling out a beer from the wine rack. I easily untwisted the metal cap and popped the cork. Out pours a smooth creamy tan head that filled my whole glass with extreme carbonation. After the beer settles down I’m left with a dark brown beer with garnet hues. There are familiar aromas to that of other dark ales such as the English Porter that come to mind with scents of dark fruits and yeasty fresh breads. The taste is smooth with a sweet creamy body and hints of Green Apples, Figs, Prunes, Molasses, Roasted Malts and other complex baking spice flavors.  Overall the best points are the mellow flavors, smooth body and strong 9% ABV. The only downsides would be the cost, and maybe the sediments at the very bottom. Considering the high price over other similar beers, it certainly makes my Samuel Smith Porter and Oatmeal stout buys look like a bargain.

S: Smells of warm bread and kitchen spices with some rum soaked raisins. There is a light mineral quality to it with some mild alcohol and yeast esters to finish out the nose. Really nice malt and yeast complexities in the aroma.  T: Tastes of bready malts with loads of dried fruit notes like raisin, plum, and figs. Has that Belgian candi sugar sweetness to it but it stays more on the dry side without cloying. Spicy but not particularly clove like phenols which is nice. More of a peppery spice with some loamy earth and banana peel there. Low to moderate bitterness with some perceptible alcohol noted. Really nice and balanced overall.  M: Very creamy and soft with a moderate filling quality. Well carbed with a high amount of spritz on the palate. Finishes lightly dry and a touch thin however this is very clean overall.

Pours very dark, apparently murky caramel brown, but amber-caramel with clarity when backlit, with one-finger very light-tan head, with excellent retention, pulling a solid coating of (Belgian) lace down the glass. Aroma of mild roast malts and moderate Belgian spice off pour, joined as warms by a little sweet citrus, some florals, a lot of chocolate, a bit of sharper stone fruit, and finally a little alcohol sweetness. Moderate carbonation delivers smooth, deep, sweet caramel malt to start, then a little fruit (plum?) break, over a substantial, mouth-filling body, and much chocolate, complemented with a little orange, before a crisping, slightly-citrusy, somewhat alcohol-warming finish.  Re-reviewing my favorite beer after 10 years of assumed enjoyment, the particulars have changed, but the assumption holds. An unmatched malty pleasure.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

T: Taste has some notes of citrus, banana, grape and other fruits, more fruity Belgian esters.  M: Fuller side of medium bodied, average, if harsh, level of carbonation.  O: Slightly edges out the other two common, year-round Chimays, but it's grossly overrated. It is a really good beer, but it is not one of the best Belgian ales out there.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,Andrew041180,3.92,"A - Poured into a Chimay goblet. I poured slowly, and about a finger's worth of light, bubbly head spring up. A little fizzy looking. The head receded pretty quickly and maintains a film. The head clings to the glass, but does not form any lacing. The beer is quite dark. Very dark brown with some nice highlights when the light strikes it right.  S - Honestly, I detect almost nothing here. Some faint semi-sweet malty tones.  T - Here is where the beer starts to pick up. Something of a dark fruit sweetness with a convincing bitter presence at mid-palate. The finish evolves significantly with a dry, almost tart flavor. Nice complexity. Just a bit of alcohol detectable on the finish.  M - Excellent. Medium-full bodied with some carbonation detectable. The dry finish is great, and leaves me wanting more. Not as a means for clearing some bizarre aftertaste, but because it really is that good.  O - Slow start, but I'm warming up to it. It doesn't knock my socks off in any significant way, but I appreciate the range of feel and flavors that you get from this beer. Nice sipper.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,Bernoulli,4.22,"Very nice smell of grapes and beer.  Opaque (slightly-hazy) golden-brown.  1/2"" head fades relatively fast with no lacing.  The stereotypical Trappist ale taste is a bit hidden by the slight grapiness. You can feel the alcohol's warmth, but the taste of alcohol isn't overpowering. A very nice warmer!  The tragedy is that we have so much to say about mediocre and bad beers, but not much to say about the great ones.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,ThisWangsChung,3.55,"12 oz bottle poured into a Chimay goblet, natch.  A: Pours a murky dark brown color with great opacity. The head is about two fingers high, with an off-white shade. Typical of the style, it's very airy in texture and a bit rough-looking, and its retention is decent without being spectacular. No much lacing to speak of.  S: At first, the aroma is mostly bready and peppery, lacking in both fruit esters and even darker malts. There are also touches of earth here and there. To get the most out of this beer's nose, you really have to let it warm up - this way, it will develop some nice tones of caramel, chocolate, brown sugar, cherries, and raisins. While the aroma develops into something quite good, not once does it jump out at me; it's rather mild to a fault.  T: There is a good amount of raisin flavor as soon as this hits the palate. Past the swallow, it transitions into a sweet caramel-and-chocolate flavor to go with its earthy (but not funky) yeast. There seems to be something ever-so-slightly off about this one, especially on the back end - I want to say it's kind of metallic? Yeah, that's it. Metallic. Some stank-ass cheese flavor also pops up in spurts, but I don't consider that a flaw. The complexity here is quite good.  M: The carbonation is quite intense. This makes it light-feeling and a bit prickly, but also very drinkable. Once the fizz calms down, it still remains very dry on the back end. The feel does a good job of reminding me why I enjoy my Belgian-style ales to come from Belgium itself: the carbonation doesn't try to cover up an overly sweet finish, while still retaining a complex nature.  O: Almost great, but that metallic strangeness kind of hurts. This and the mellow aroma keep it out of the fabled 4 range, sadly. I imagine this would go great with a stank-ass cheese (preferably from Chimay themselves), and this is certainly worth having again to find out. Still, my favorite (non-quad) BSDA remains Gouden Carolus Classic.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

215,2512,BeerDocT,3.94,"Ah, Chimay. Dusty, expensive bottles lining the shelves of beer stores across the globe. What's inside? What could it be? Will cost prove to be predicate to excellence?  Poured into a chilled La Trappe goblet.  Appearance 4.0: Poured out a dark amber with a nice head...well over half an inch. Good lacing.  Smell 3.75: Bouquet is subdued and very strange for this style. I smell Belgian yeast, but phenols from different styles: banana, cloves. Also, there is a nice hint of earthiness.  Taste 4.0: Front is slightly sweet, but in a warming way. Middle is silky smooth and just delightful with hints of treacly malt and some light noble hops. Finish is smooth with a big wave of malt and some interesting tastes of adjuncts, specifically corn. Aftertaste is long and silky, but sticks to the basics: malt and...well, malt.  Mouthfeel 4.0: Smooth, well-balanced and lovely on the palate.  Overall 4.0: Outstanding Belgian Dark, but not the best I have ever had. The bouquet is a bit off and the taste is somewhat one-dimensional, but -nonetheless-- this is an excellent brew. So, my advice is to save up your sheckles and buy a bottle of this to try. Then once you have done so, save up some more money (less than Chimay, BTW) and buy a bottle of St. Feuillien Speciale instead. Or, go to your local Trader Joe's and buy 750ML of a comparable beer for $5.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

It's beautiful, for sure. You want a strong dark ale, and you couldn't photoshop one much better.  The smell is full of dark fruit and not-overpowering sweetness. It's really inviting.  The taste is complex and delic--wait. What's that? Am I just not in love with the yeast, or maybe the esters or something? It's tough to pin down what holds this back from being amazing, which is a testament to the number and variety of flavors in it. But there's one too many cooks in the kitchen, and he's a dick.  The mouthfeel unfortunately accentuates whatever's going on in the taste that, admit it, you don't love either. I mean you may love the overALL taste, but you know something's holding it back. The prickly supercarbonation pushes whatever that thing is right into your taste buds.

The liquid is dark brown, cloudy, and almost murky looking with some slight carbonation.  I don't get a lot of aroma on this one. The dark fruit, plum and fig notes are there and I expect that, but not much else, just some slight yeastiness.  The taste is similar to the smell, with the heavy dark fruit, some malty sweetness and the lingering taste of candied syrup.  I was impressed by the mouthfeel, as there's some spiciness, only slight carbonation and chewy, creaminess in the middle. Most importantly, there's no alcohol burn.

Tastes fruity upfront much like in the nose. Some background dark malts, maybe some chocolate or caramel - tough to tell behind all the fruity favors.

215,2512,CalgaryFMC,4.16,"Poured from a 330 ml bottle into a genuine Chimay goblet. Perhaps lighter than expected, a ruddy orange-brown with a massive amount of tannish head. The forth settles down a bit but the carbonation remains brisk. Although one's Belgian dark ale schema is screaming heavy and thick, this classic is in fact silky smooth, creamy, and of only moderate body, although the flavors are assertive enough. Aroma of cooked orchard fruit (pears and apples), raisins, dates, sweet grains, and a decent dose of cellar must. Boozy and a bit funky in the yeast sense. Although the aroma is not terribly spicy (maybe its my crap sense of smell), the palate is spice-forward ... Pepper and pumpkin pie spice, cloves, and a rather unique and very pleasing floral/herbal essence like dried basil and sandalwood. Malts remind one of rye bread and hints of toasted crust. Sweet rum, dates, treacle, a whiff of chocolate ... A fresher fruitiness as well in this example, almost like Concord grapes. Intermittent blasts of alcohol. The king of Chimay. Perhaps lighter and drier than other Belgian darks but has its own herbal/floral character paired with the yeast, spice, and dark fruit one would expect.

The beer is the color of figs, deep red brown.  Smells of bread pudding, raisins, toffee, sweet doughy, fruity yeast, vanilla. Hints of alcohol throughout. Simple, but outstandingly put together.  Yeasty sweet bread, bread pudding, cinnamon rolls not iced, sweetened iced coffee, rum raisin. There's more alcohol here; bitter and a bit estery.  The weight is unremarkable in the mouth. Not too much carbonation despite the large head. Nothing is out of wack and the focus is on the aroma and flavors.  I can see why this is a classic. It's not flashy, but it is very good.

Excellent product at a great price.... $3.65/ea at the LCBO.  S- Light and thin. Not indicative of what the flavor is like  T- Excellent! Very enjoyable. Light on the tongue cold. Opens slowly to expose a light nutmeg flavor. Once it warms it does power up but not hot by any means. Having this one with 6mths since purchase I don't think hotness can be subdued yet.  M- Smooth. Leaves a touch of bitter nut at the end. Carbination stays and stays and stays. VERY lively.  O- Very very good. Will definitely cellar a few.  I don't know why the reviews bash this offering after aging too long however at the price I will try to see how they age every 6mths on every year's batch. Will update this review as I do.  Food Pairing  This excellent little dark ale will pair very well with... Hamburgers  I do cook from comfort to natural to gourmet but do believe in keeping it simple for the most part. Hamburgers will accent this slightly heavy beer. Keep your toppings low and simple and this pairing will compliment each other very well.  Enjoy,Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

215,2512,CDBeerDisappear,4.93,"Look: Dark brown with massive rocky head. Visible carbonation of the sides of the glass too dark to see rising bubbles, plenty of lacing, great retention. Thick foam cap lasts forever. Smell: Caramel malt and dark fruit, prunes, plums, raisins, fig, Belgian yeast (banana and apple) Taste: I don’t get a distinct taste, neither sweet nor bitter it just is completely what it is. I know that sounds dumb but try and tell me what you taste (sweet, sour, bitter?) Flavor: Now flavor, that’s a different story. This beer’s flavor comes across as dark fruit with chocolate notes, strong malt backbone, molasses, pear, spices. This originally intended to be a Christmas Ale and it certainly has that vibe, but you would never want to rim the glass with sugar. The flavor stands up to all seasons. Currently a 90 degree day August and it doesn’t back down or make me wish I was drinking something else. Feel: One of the best mouthfeels I have ever had. It’s viscous and rich but livened up by bright carbonation. Finish is dark fruit. Overall: One of the BEST beers made! I have been drinking these (on special occasions) for 30 years. My wife know that I always appreciate a Chimay (any color label) and often buys me one as a gift on gift giving holidays. Of course, it’s too expensive to drink regularly. I don’t think it would be an everyday beer because then it wouldn’t be special. For me, this is champagne. I would rather celebrate a special occasion with one of these than with an actual champagne.  The buzz (and you'll have one after drink 750ml of this beer) is a smoother and better buzz than most other beers. Of course this is not the reason to drink it, lest you go broke, but when you do drink it on those special occasions, that is just one more layer of the enjoyment.  It stands up to any kind of drinking. A sip is delightful, a gulp is satisfying, drinking it fast would be great, but you’ll certainly want to drink it slow as to not miss anything. If you sip it without thinking about it it’s satisfying, if you concentrate on every aspect as you slowly sip it, it provides nuance after nuance. For many years this was near the top of the Beeradvocate Top 100. Currently ranked #1 in the Strong Ale – Belgian Dark category. AND, it’s available almost everywhere!

Excellent, true to form for a good Trappist ale. Scents of Belgian yeast, candi sugar, dark fruit, molasses, raisins, prunes, a slight metallic twinge, peppery, spicy scents, grape, slight apple, banana comes forward as it warms, melding with the other aromas to make a nice, sweet scent. Very faint hints of alcohol in the background. A rich, sweet, deep aroma with an amazing complexity, as expected of a Trappist ale. Flavor follows the nose. It is quite sweet up front notes of apple, raisin, dark fruit, and slight pear. As it warms in the mouth sweet caramel malt, honey, and spicy flavors begin to emerge, melding with the fruit. As you swish spicy clove and alcohol notes emerge in the back of the mouth. Candi sugar and Belgian yeast spiciness and hints of faint herbal qualities and wood in the background are present throughout. Finish is spicy and burns the nose slightly, with alcohol, clove, yeasty spice, and some non-descript sweet spices.

It's a solid beer--I would've enjoyed it more if I had actually served at the proper temperature and glass. That's on me.  I will definitely try this again...and get it right next time.  I will say this--it is an excellent beer to sip on while sitting on my back patio enjoying this cool October evening in the Midwest. Cheers!,Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

215,2512,thehyperduck,4.51,"330 mL stubby bottle picked up at the LCBO; 'best before' 2018. I was honestly shocked to see this one on the shelves of a store right down the street from me that I neglect to check regularly. I quickly scooped up a couple of bottles, because I've heard great things about this one (and it's also the only flagship Chimay product I haven't yet tried). Served at cellar temperature, and poured into a tulip.  Pours a muddy reddish-brown colour, erupting at first with nearly three fingers of head (I guess it's been a while since I've poured into this glass). It dies down gradually over a span of five to ten minutes, coating the sides with gobs of lacing, and eventually leaving behind a creamy cap and generous collar. Looks awesome, and the aroma is equally enticing - there is a good mixture of raisins, figs, banana, toasted malts, caramel and molasses. Nothing out of the ordinary for the style; quite yeasty.  Very tasty stuff, though not exactly as complex as I'd hoped after sniffing it. Dark fruits dominate at first, including the aforementioned raisin/fig duo, in addition to some dark cherry and baker's chocolate. This transitions into some caramel and molasses sweetness, with a touch of banana. The finish offers a combination of malt sweetness, yeast and light clove spice, leaving behind a mildly sweet/roasty aftertaste behind on the palate. I am astonished at how well the alcohol is hidden here; it's detectable, but it integrates perfectly with the rest of the flavours. Full-bodied and very smooth, with mild carbonation that gently prickles the tongue. Deceptively drinkable at 9%, though it sure hits your head quick once you stand up out of your seat.  Final Grade: 4.51, an exceptional A grade. This isn't a style I drink much of on a regular basis, but Chimay Blue is easily my favourite BSDA so far. This is delicious fresh, but I think it's safe to say it would be worth holding onto a bottle or two for a few years - this stuff is made for cellaring, and I hope to review this same vintage in 2015-16 or so. The only problem: mustering up the self-control required to stop myself from opening the remaining bottles of this incredible brew until then!",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

S: Deep ripe fruit, cherries, aromatic hydrocarbons, spices, dried cranberries. Maybe some esters, very slight. Some weak caramel malty notes and non existent hop notes.  T: Smooth, with dried fruit like dark and tart cherry. Very mild cola nut and caramel malt notes.  M: Creamy due to tight little bubbles on head. Medium mouthfeel and a gentle drying finish. Outbreath gets hotter due to booze level. The ultimate finish is a pleasant dark cherry aroma. Very nice.  O: A wonderful strong Belgian with beautiful, complex dark cherry and caramel notes.

215,2512,Gasc0igne,4.22,"Re-reviewed October 2nd 2016.  750mL bottle. 2011 on label. 01/12 on cork.  After a satisfying pop from the cork, the pour yields a gorgeous cloudy mahogany liquid, complete with yeasty sediment goodness. A large-bubbled, off-white, and soapy head quickly forms but soon retreats, leaving a distinct layer atop the beer. Carbonation is quite visible and the lacing is above average.  Heavy, tart cherries is what seems to dominate my nasal experience. No alcohol until the very end of a sniff. There's certainly a good background bread/yeast presence that does well to balance this tart and sweet dark fruit monster.  Belgian, in a big way. Strong and chewy Belgian yeast along with the malty-breadiness is right there from the beginning and stays there. The fruit has dropped away more than I'd expected; it's still present towards the end in a more bitter form, but the alcohol tries to cut it out. There's a dull sweetness the pokes its head out every now-and-then but it isn't much.  The Belgians really know how to make me salivate...

Smell - Dark fruits, burnt brown sugar, other fine malts.  Taste - Again dark fruits and burnt brown sugars, but cherries and plums specifically are noticeable from the dark fruit conglomerate.

Flavor follows suit, with rich malty sweetness upfront, followed by underpinnings of dark fruit and a slightly dry finish. Bruised cherries, green apple, raisins, and figs ride a backbone of toasted, slightly nutty malt.  Body is full, with light carbonation, slightly spritzy, and significant alcohol warmth.

Aggressive effervescence at all 360 degrees of my glass, carving trails through the head in its ascension to the open air.  S: Dark fruit like prunes, some burnt sugar or dark toffee, occasional warm spices. Some sniffs have a surprising floral aroma, but an unfortunate slight metallic scent is sometimes present underneath.  T: Same as above, with a slight sweetness coming from the prunes- not my favorite. Subtle spices (cinnamon) and some smoke, a bit of malt, even a bit of lemongrass coming and going. Has some intriguing characteristics, but ultimately its foundation is too far from my preferences for me to really get into it.  M: High carbonation, fills me up quickly, yet smooth.

Up close, I get a big whiff of candi sugar, plums and dates, maybe raisins or grapes. There's a slight nuttiness, but more subdued than their Dubbel.  Slightly tangy; dark fruits and nuts; huge sugar element. Complex, but it tastes so sweet and lovely that you don't have to analyze it at all; just sip and enjoy.  The only hint of the ABV is a slight warming effect after several sips. Full bodied, and thickly coats the mouth with a pleasant, lingering aftertaste. Frighteningly drinkable, although this is still very much a sipper.  ""This is how wine should taste."" -my wife. If there's a BSDA or Quad out there that fits my palate better, it's Rochefort 10.

215,2512,1sophrosyne1,4.21,"Enjoyed immensely in La Grand-Place, Bruxelles and on my couch--each time poured from bottle into a snifter-goblet and consumed over roughly 25 minutes.  A nutty-red caramel brown color with virtually no translucency. Pours a one finger head with little retention. Endearing slow streams of bubbles continually rise to feed the speckled ring on the glass. Near the bottom, thick glycerin stares up from winey-warm sips.  The overall smell is of a light brandied fruitcake. Its bready malt draws in the mouth to take a bite. The candied plums, figs, and cherries are vibrant, and toasted walnuts suggest there will be some smoke in the flavor, as well. Caramelized banana fills the middle of each breath with some vanilla overtones. Orange and some lemon pierce the boozy air, carrying along a lingering cinnamon.  The alcohol and carbonation delay emergence of taste for just a moment while all those aromas crawl up the nose to set the stage. So, the banana is pressed down enough to allow more of a red sweetness to show in the form of cherries and currants. Lots of malt carries along some roasted pear. Orange peel with nutmeg and allspice bring to mind cidery holiday cheer. An aluminum taste-blade slices into the banana some more near the end of warmer mouthfuls. I would prefer a little less of the tropical fruit and just a bit more hopspice, but I know this is a centuries-old blend that's to be respected for what it is.  The tight, fine carbonation does a lively dance on the insides of lips and all over the tongue. Working together with the booze, it creates a bright burn that's mirrored in the gut as the 9% begins to collect. The tannic dryness of a wine offsets sweetness well and makes me reach for the glass again. Wait long enough between gulps, and buccal surfaces feel almost metal-polished--a reminder that there are hops doing their part. All these moving parts keep this fat, creamy monk from smothering you--he's jolly and round, but never too heavy.

215,2512,Mardrommar,4.21,"Poured into a Chimay goblet.  Pours a dark, blood orange color with light orange highlighting when held up to the light. Appears a maroon color when not directly exposed to a light source. Formed a finger-width off white head that dissipated within the first three minutes, shrinking to a centimeter or so in height. Beautiful lacing along the sides of the glass when swirled. Minimal lacing otherwise. There is a large amount of yeast sediment floating around in the beer. This could be due to the vigorous pour I gave it, or it could be due to the fact the beer has been sitting in the fridge for a year plus.  The Chimay blue has a very complex, pleasant aroma. No one scent stands out -- it blends together and highlights the fact it is a balanced ale. Dark fruits are present, such as plum and raisin, though it has the scent of pear and apple as well. A candied sweetness is underlying. Booziness tends to come through as well. Brown sugar may also be present.  The mouthfeel is the beer is big, coating the entire tongue. Carbonation is high. One of the most complex beers I’ve had. It’s hard to piece together the flavors. The initial flavor is a candied sweetness of sorts that is paired to a boozy flavor, which then transitions into a sharp bitter finish. The finish is crisp, and leaves a mildly bitter aftertaste with a dark fruit complement.  Although this beer is very smooth and easy to drink, it is heavy on the stomach. Its complexity is daunting, I think.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

A nice hint of spice/pepper on the finish. M-A bit carbonated, but it's pleasant on the pallet and it adds to the pop of the spices on the finish. O- a great example of Belgian strong dark ale.

215,2512,hreb,4.35,"2012 vintage. 75cL corked/caged champagne-style bottle served in Chimay's own wide mouth chalice. Beer pours deep brown with a massive, delicious lighter brown foam. Aroma is way sweet, candi sugar, with a little bit of fruit, like dates.  First sip is explosive with flavor. Sweet up front, tangy on the sides, and rich through the middle. Super fine carbonation tickles the front of my tongue and dances all over my mouth. This compliments the malt flavors and contrasts nicely with the super heavy richness that the ale otherwise conveys. Oh, and it 9% ABV it's a great drink, not at all too heady.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Quickly dissipates in thickness, though a thin layer of foam remains on top. Cloudy, red. Moderate carbonation  Smell: Dark fruits and some chocolate. Some spice. Some malt.  Taste: Dark fruit carries over, but the chocolate really swells here. Spice and malt towards the end. Beginning is certainly not weak, but it builds into something really special. One of the stronger middles I’ve tried out of all of the Trappists I’ve had so far (especially compared to say the Rochefort 8). Good finish.  Mouthfeel: Light for a dark Trappist, but still somewhat heavy. Good carbonation, silky smooth.  Overall: Surprised me in a very good way. I somewhat stuck my nose up at it as one of the most common Trappist beers. Very solid beer, especially for the price and availability (3.50 Euros here to $11 back in the States).

Aromas of richly sweet date and grapes, giving it a wine-like characteristic. Some subtle spicing of nutmeg and all-spice, with a tone of alcohol throughout, as well. Smells balanced and rich. Flavors are very rich, with heavy old-world fruit sweetness giving a rich and robust blast to the palate. Nutmeg and clove clean up the tail end of the palate, and there is a tangy toffee sweetness that carries through into the aftertaste.

Really eclectic aromas in this one.  T- Quite a bit of sweetness comes through, with the fruity esters leading the way with the nutty and grainy flavors balancing it out. Aftertaste of fruit preserves, with a little bit of hazelnut.  M- Very bubbly and carbonated. The coating in the aftertaste is tremendous. This one is full bodied, but has a fizzy feel to it.

215,2512,Curtis,4.05,"Poured into a Boulevard Brewing Co tulip glass I use when reviewing special beers, primarily Belgians. Nice plop from the cork, a strong indication of the carbonation level to come. Nice fizz with a thick head that dissipates very quickly. Very dark amber color, hints of ruby red. when held up to the light. Mouth feel is a little excessive from the carbonation. It could mellow a bit with more cellar time, like several months: I bought this one only two weeks ago and have been itching to try it.. Not real sure about this at first, wasn't at all what I expected. Starting to like it more and more with each sip. Noticing sherry, caramel, VERY mild hops, dark Belgian candy sugar. Nicely blended, well-crafted, a very good desert beer with chocolate. Alcohol content is hidden well, but still present. The only ""knock"" for lack of a better term would be very mild smell, and the slight over-carbonation of this particular bottle at this time. Smell would take away from the complexity of the blend. I really can see it mellowing with age and moving up a couple of notches. As the glass sits for a couple of minutes and the carbonation dissipates, the true nature of this beer comes out, especially the sherry, caramel roasted malt and the complexity of the blend..",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

T:A delicate banana flavor, with woody notes like other trappists, a little alcoholic feel emerge in the end, but the predominant flavors came from the hops.

M- This is actually my favorite part of the beer, there is a lot of carbonation diffused in the body of the beer that pleasantly fizzes up in the mouth, almost soda like.

215,2512,Groomsy,4.37,"Poured from a a bomber into an Orval chalice. Bottled on 08/12, so this is still fairly young.  Chimay Blue pours a murky brown and has highlights of ruby red when held to the light. Streams of carbonation come from the bottom of the glass and support a quickly-fading head of a white soapy head that leave stringy lacing down the glass. A great-looking beer, though it doesn't leave the lacing for which it's usually renowned – this probably has to do with the relatively young age of the bottle, maybe.  Sweet mother of pearl, the nose on this beer. I can only think to list the descriptors: caramel, toffee, fig, raisins, rum-soaked cherries, slight citrus (orange peel?), fresh-cracked pepper, bread, and rum. It's incredibly gorgeous and complex. A swirl of the glass revive some faint earthy/musty notes as well as signature Belgian yeast aromas, calling to mind clove and fresh-baked wheat bread.  Chimay Blue is incredibly layered and complex, and only grows more so as it warms. Starting off with a peppery bite, the beer smooths over with flavors of roasted malt, dark fruit (think figs, raisins, etc.), bread, and tart cherries soaked in alcohol. The dark fruit seems to dominate on the middle of the palate, and it finishes with a dry, alcoholic sweetness with notes of clove and other spices. I would be very interested to see how this beer changes with age, but unfortunately, I have no other bottle by which to judge.  While quite carbonated and zesty, Chimay Blue has a body that matches its flavor and appearance. Its medium body is dry with some lingering fusel alcohols, but these alcohols provide a fairly “normal” finish to the complexity of the rest of this beer.  Trying Chimay Blue is a moment which every beer drinker should look forward to. This is a beer which I savored over the course of about two hours or so, and I am grateful to have tried it in a time span which I knew would be uninterrupted. Beautifully layered and complex – I am eager to try this with some age on it.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

A- Pours a muddy brown, cloudy opaque body with a perfectly carbonated 2"" off white head that reduces slowly and leaves some lacing.  S- Candi sugar, citrus zest, orange juice, cloves, bananas. A deeper whiff reveals cocoa powder, coffee beans, apples, toffee, molasses, figs, tart cherry. One of the most complex beers I've ever smelled.  T- Starts off with spices, bananas, candi sugar, brown sugar and molasses, and develops into a more citrusy, tart fruit, cherry and apple flavor. The finish is slightly roasty. The long aftertaste is tart fruit, white grapes, and lemons. The flavors come through more as it warms, and it also gets smoother and more creamy.  M- Medium carbonation, medium body but drinks like a lighter bodied belgian.  This was one of the most complex beers I've ever tasted.

215,2512,hermit990,4.13,"750 ml bottle, poured into a goblet. Bottled in 2012.  Appearance: Pours an opaque, red-brown color, with about 1 finger of tan head. The head quickly recedes to a lasting foam on top of the beer. Lacing sticks to the glass well as the beer is moved around.  Smell: There's a fruity, vinous character upfront to this one. Sweet, dark fruits (red grapes, raisins, plums). Also some hints of breadiness, mixed with baking spice (clove, cinnamon) near the finish. The aromas blend together very well. Picking up some more subtle elements of candied sugar and toffee notes as it warms.  Taste: Leads with a dark fruit sweetness, (plums, raisins). This gradually fades into a chewy, breadiness, retaining a bit of the sweetness, while combining with some baking spice elements (cinnamon, clove, nutmeg). Finish becomes slightly bittering and earthy, finishes with a crackling, black pepper spiciness. Some caramel notes, and a bit of the alcohol taste, come out as the beer warms up.  Mouthfeel: Good body to this one. Starts with a medium feel on the tongue as carbonation scrubs over it. As this builds, the feel becomes thicker and creamier, almost chewy about the time the bready flavors hit the tongue. Tingling spiciness and some warming feel from the alcohol as it finishes.  Overall: This is a very enjoyable beer. While other Trappist ales are more to my liking, this is still very good in its own right. Very easy to drink considering the alcohol content, and also readily available just about anywhere. A bit on the expensive side ($14 per bottle in my area), but this isn't out of the norm for Trappist ales. Definitely worth a try.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Apple and pear come in after the after the sugar and there is a cracker like taste on the back end. The alcohol seeps through just a little bit.  The mouthfeel is thin, creamy and cracker like.

Lacing as you swirled it in a small snifter glass. *S: Classic triple, fruity, a bit of malt, but mostly orange, lemon, pineapple, grass *T: More complex than the Allagash Tripel from earlier in the tasting. 2 levels of flavors from the initial tip of the tongue to the finish. Sweetness and tartness. Carbonation keeps it buzzing on your tongue. Alcohol is hidden, just a bit in a champagne sort of way (carbonation). *M: Nice and creamy.

215,2512,Chrysostom,4.64,"MY REVIEW GOT DELETED BECAUSE I TOOK TOO LONG TO WRITE IT. The following review is heavily shortened, and is affected by the 1000-word mega-review (in my typical style) which was deleted and pissed me off. Will review again from calmness in a few days when I re-up at the package store and pick up a few more bottles, and make sure to cut and paste before I hit ""submit"".  Introduction: this is one of the best of the Quadrupels, and it's the original. All further Quads, come from Chimay Blue.  The Trappists are a Catholic cloistered religious order, one of the strictest there is. They are called the Order of Cistercians of Strict Observance, an 18th-century reforming order which broke away from the original mediaeval Cistercians, themselves a reforming order and a breakaway from the ancient Benedictines.  Thomas Merton, the famous Anglo-American religious and spiritual author of ""The Seven-Storey Mountain"", was a Trappist monk - in America!, yes, America has Trappist monasteries - at Gethsemani Abbey in Kentucky. Too bad they don't brew beer.  Without further ado, a severely truncated, unreliable review.  P: 750mL corked and caged bottle poured in to Chimay chalice/goblet.  A: Very cloudy dark brown, small head which quickly recedes to nothing. No lacing. Has hints of mud/lighter dark brown when held up to the light. Nothing that can be called a ""highlight"", as it's the same colour with light coming through it; however, it is appetizing, and typically Belgian.  S: Booze, esters, and malt. As it warms, booze becomes predominant. The smell is small for such a big beer.  T: Dark fruits, carbonation, esters, malt bomb. Some booze. More boozy than St Bernardus Abt 12, but still with deceptively-hidden alcoholic content. The finish is quite long, and astringent/bitter. The hops come through pretty strong, as does a quite noticeable thin mineral-water aftertaste, which is the only thing I dislike about the taste of this beer. 4.25 to 4.5. It's lower in comparison to St Bernardus, which has a very similar flavour, yet has a better finish and no mineral-water aftertaste.  M: Effervescent while still being relatively thick. Finish is long, and leaves a coating of some sort, not a cleansing.  D: High. One could have many of these, to one's own detriment.  O: A veritable illustration of the maxim, ""The whole is greater than the sum of its parts."" This beer is truly greater than any one of its component ratings. 87-92/100.  I recommend searching for a video on Youtube called ""Chimay Brewery Tour"", which increased my appreciation for this beer, and shows the fusion of monastic life, passion for beer, and high-technology which goes in to Chimay.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,zeledonia,4.19,"Finally trying this Trappist classic. I tend to overlook the European beers for less expensive domestic ones, but it's about time I made my way through some more tasty Belgians. Tasted 1 March 2013, reviewed from notes.  Pours a deep murky brown, but with an amber shade. Clear coming out of the bottle, but dark enough that it's tough to see through. One finger of light yellowish tan head, very foamy and fizzy like carbonation from soda. Slowly relaxes to a thin but complete cap.  Smell is crisp, which is one of the things I really like in the better dark Belgian ales. Despite being sugar-heavy beers, they manage to have this delicate lightness in the smell, softly backed up by those malty aromas. A bit of tobacco, herbal and mildly bitter.  Taste is dark, sweet, and fruity. Figs, brown sugar, but with that unmistakable Belgian yeast twang. I'm liking this a lot. Not quite on the level of some of the best quads and BSDAs, but really close.  Mouthfeel is, well, overcarbonated. Medium-heavy body, a little chewy, and sticky. But it fizzes up much more than I want to, blocking the flavors from me, so that I'm tasting foam instead of beer. Otherwise pleasant, but that carbonation definitely interferes with my enjoyment of the beer.  This beer is really really tasty. The one thing that brought it down for me was the mouthfeel, which I found overly fizzy for a beer like this. But the rest of it is so good that it carries my overall enjoyment well up. I also found it better at relatively cool temperatures (~50 degrees F) than after it had warmed up a bit more.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Gets better as it warms up.  Mouthfeel - Great carbonation. You almost want to chew it.  Overall - One of the best I've had, to date.

Splitting this with my wife tonight, into two Chimay chalices, to commemorate the sadness of leaving behind my career as a medieval historian and teacher and a celebration of the next step (whatever that might be). Cheers!  Appearance: A warm, ruddy sienna brew, capped with a dark ivory cap which fades slowly to a thick patchy film. Not quite as much stick as I'd like, but still an attractive brew.  Smell: Wonderfully soft and inviting aroma, with dark sugared fruits (grapes, raisins, plums), sweet/baking spice yeast notes, and just a hint of cork and cellar. Elegant, refined, classic.  Taste: Soft dark fruits (maybe grape, and several others, but none really jump out). LIght notes of sweet yeasty spice. The lightest hint of toasted bread and something earthy on the finish. Sweet flavors, but ends dry.  Mouthfeel: Light as a whisper, almost fluffy. It's amazing that 9% can feel like this.

A thick, two finger head forms and then actually SWELLS up to the top of the glass before bubbling down after a few minutes. Leaves some truly stupendous lacing as it goes down  Smell: Starts off with some rich brown sugar, a lot of yeast with some medium malts with a whispy booze. A bit sweet with an earthy background note. Not a whole lot going on here really.  Taste- Very straight forward and clean flavors. Rich and a bit sweet with a good yeasty flavors. Like the nose it's malty with hidden booze that creeps up on you and dark fruits.  Mouth- A light medium body that is also rich and malty but a tad too bubbly.  Overall: I'd buy and drink it again.

A finger or so of off white foam crowns the beer. Most of it fades away, but a solid iceberg like chunk remains long after. Lacing is pretty sparse. The nose is almost perfection. Lots of plum and fig, and spicy phenols are a secondary aroma. The flavor profile still has some dark fruit esters, and they're joined by a light caramel touch. The pepper and clove spicy notes are definitely more pronounced than in the nose, and just a hair too much so for my taste. The mouthfeel is fantastic, highlighted by a very well dried out body. The carbonation is plenty lively, but there's just a slight lack of creaminess to it.

On the nose, close your eyes and you might think you are in a bakery at early morning as the ovens are getting going - yeasty bread overtones dominate here.

Some unsettled yeast in the bottom of the glass.  S - sweet smelling figs, raisins, and the scent of pecan pie come to mind. Very nice!  T - tasty but somewhat one dimensional or ""well balanced"" which makes it hard to pinpoint specific flavors. Not as sweet or fruity as the aroma would lead you to believe. Hops play a minor role here while malts and yeast flavors share top billing. Finishes warm.  M - silky smooth and slick with a decent amount of carbonation.  O - ABV is masked nicely so this brew goes down smoother than you might expect. Very enojoyable, but I felt it was missing something....can't put my finger on it though.

You get more of the date taste, and a little bit of raisin.  There is decent carbonation, but it isn't overpowering. It sits easy and goes down the same.

215,2512,Hoppsbabo,4.07,"This is a revised review. The first bottle had gone a bit stale. Belgian beer clearly doesn't like long haul flights. Virtually everything Belgian I've brought to Korea with me has gone off but thankfully I can buy Chimay in Seoul now.  A: Mahognony with fluffy off-white head. The delicate bubbles make soft popping sounds.  S: Barrett's Refreshers, marzipan, plain white bread, some banana.  T: Tart breadiness, quite acidic, sweet, earthy and has a sharp fizziness to it. Has the usual sensual blend of dark dried fruits but they're not overly prominent but not dull either. There's a bit of coriander essence but it takes on more of a liquorish character, and while it's neither prominent nor subtle, it blends beautifully with a cooked rhubarb fruitness. A lovely balanced mix however, there is a slightly unpleasant burned flavour. Kind of reminds me of burned beef stock or even weirder, celery leaves. Shut up.  MY ORIGINAL SUMMARY (bad bottle): Not sweet enough. Smelled good but the alcohol was too bitter and there wasn't enough flavour (for me anyway). I remember it tasting better than this so maybe I've had a bad bottle.  MY REVISED SUMMARY (fresh bottle): Delicious. The balance of liquorish, dark dried fruits, rhubarb and general acidity has won me over. It's not quite as resplendent as some of the other Belgian dark ales, or I should say the flavours are not as exagerated, but it's beautifully balanced and very sensual. It'll be a staple when I finally leave Asia and go back to the UK.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,schoolboy,4.12,"I bought this particular one yesterday and we are drinking it for lunch today (Christmas Eve). It almost tastes like it was pre-aged - very mellow.  It pours a cloudy murky mess with a lovely head. The aroma is the perfect Belgian yeast. I got some foam up my nose sniffing and it was heavenly.  The taste is thick like the appearance, with loads of yeasty goodness. It lingers nicely with a Belgian goodness. This was a good choice for an early Christmas treat.  Edit: Here it is, October 2015 and I have a couple of these that are from their 2012 anniversary special. $8.99 at Saveon, and these are pre-aged (don't tell anyone, they have lots more three year old ones).

A-The brew opened with a decent whoosh and the carbonation provided a long-lasting head that topped out a two fingers of khaki/brown foam.

I also picked up a decent wave of peppery alcoholic spice and a touch of fruity, doughy yeast.  T-Taste follows the smell to a t. I got sweet, boozy, slightly spiced dark fruit that was this beers defining characteristic. Also some brown sugar and molasses. Overall, the taste was a touch on the sweet side for my palate.  M-Medium to heavy feel, but not heavy when compared to others of the style. Smooth drinking.  O-This is certainly a great beer and one of the easier dark, strong Belgians to find when you're out and about. The flavors are solid and the feel is nicely balanced.

S – Just absolutely sumptuous, luxurious, opulent. The smell explodes with clove, dark fruit, cinnamon, nutmeg. And it only gets better as it warms.  T – The taste is glorious. I was nervous for a moment because even though I’ve recommended this beer to my friend, I have never sat down and actually written out a review for it. I thought that I might have remembered it as being somewhat more grand than it actually is. This is not the case. The dark fruit is even more noticeable on the palate and tastes of figs, with caramel-esque sweetness, a healthy amount of spice that comes on late, almost chocolate-like malts, and a tartness/bitterness to go along with the sweetness that adds complexity and character. And the thing is with each new sip it seems the beer changes and a new flavor stands out most prominent. So well orchestrated, absolutely “wow” worthy deliciousness.  M – The mouthfeel is phenomenal in my opinion. I love the heavy carbonation that gives it a tingly, light mouthfeel; finish is somewhat dry and peppery despite the fruity nature of the beer, and it goes down with a comforting warmth.  O – This is just a great trappist, or Belgian Strong Dark Ale. I think that it is truly something special. Each time that I get it, I come to find I enjoy it a little bit better than the time before.

Brew is a deep brown/burnt orange.  Earthy hops, grainy malts, raisins, currants and savory spice all play a big part in the nose. Very complex aromatics.  Chimay Blue kind of slaps you in the face with it's presence. It's huge; flavors ranging from dark fruits and sweet esters to the thick, rich and almost chocolaty malty backbone. The hops play a bigger role than I thought they would, offering a perfect, bitter yet fruity and EARTHY quality. The booze offers some nice spice in conjunction with the spicy yeasts. The mouthfeel is very full, like a burger in every sip. It's rich, satisfying, and complex. I can't quite put my finger on it, but I swear there is a very ancient quality to this beer.  Chimay, in fact Belgians are not exactly my style of brew but I really enjoyed Chimay Blue. The only reason I bought it was because I found a Chimay goblet for $3 and figured I might as well break it in with a bottle of Blue.

Makes it a bit airy and doesn't feel like 9% or even close to it.  O: An excellent BSDA. Honestly not the best I've had, it's very sweet and fruity but oddly hot and not as complex as a lot I've had. Not to knock it, it's an excellent beer, especially considering how easy it is to obtain.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

215,2512,MrKennedy,3.63,"330ml bottle, 2012 vintage, from Vintage Cellars, into a Duvel tulip.  Nice beige-tan head that forms on top of a deep, dark brown with some strong ruby highlights. Big foam on top that settles above film but with little to no lacing.  The smell was initially a lot of pear, stewed pear and green apple and then changed for the good to cinnamon and dark fruits.  Tastes spicy with cinnamon there with some booze. Some of the stewed pears comes in to the taste as well, with a little bit of banana and clove as well. A lot going on, not all of it is great.  Mouthfeel is odd. Thin at times, bitey with the spice early and finishing with a bit of booze and warmth. I think this needs a bit of time to even out in this department.  I've had a few of these over the past decade or so and it seems a year or so of age on them does the world of good. This has plenty of potential, but at the moment isn't quite there.

215,2512,Goblinmunkey7,3.98,"Appearance: Deep rich brown with some nice amber hues when held to direct light. Head is beige with tight bubble formation. Slightly creamy. Drops to a thin cap and solid bubbly collar rather quickly. Lively carbonation. Nice sheets of lacing. Great retention.  Smell: Dark fruits, Belgian yeast, and alcohol. Figs, plums, and some dark cherry. Big chewy sweet malts. Some caramel. Bready. Nice spice notes. Clove dominates over some banana. Some peppery notes as well. Alcohol soaked raisins. Big on the fruit. Big, but not aggressive, yeasty presence. Some candi sugar to round the whole thing out.  Taste: Raisins, cover it in booze, and wrap it in a Belgian yeast strain. Big malt sweetness. Caramel and touches of toffee try to push through the yeast and alcohol. It only works a bit. Fig and plum come through a bit as it warms. Some nice underlying peppery sweetness mixes with clove. Yeast is decidedly Belgian and hits all of the usual notes. Even some bubblegum hiding in the burp. Mild toasted elements. Banana and apples too.  Mouthfeel: Lively moderate carbonation. Body is medium, but feels a little thin due to the carbonation. Nicely dry and a bit of smoothness.  Overall: Belgian, and unapologetic, and it works.  Not as nuanced as some other beers in the style (speaking broadly of darkish Belgian ales), but worth drinking. Lots of flavor, but it's a bit brash and lacks that overall drinkability that some of the others have. The best showing in the Chimay lineup.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Little bitterness. Very well balanced.  T - Medium malt, some sugar, some darker fruit, but alot of carbonation to contend with. I'm not a cask guy, but this might be a little too much. Medium complexity, nice aftertaste of old leather, and fig.  M - Nice, other than the little-too-much carbonation. Medium heavy in the body. A good sipper.  O - A good representation of the style.

Sweetness really prevails here with little to no hops flavor. Long lasting sweet finish.  M: Thick and full with a decent alcohol warming.  D: Medium to low. This is a sipper so much more so than the red or white.  Overall a very good beer, but just a tad bit to sweet for me. I'll take the red or white as they are more enjoyable in my opinion with more balance. Still this was a very good beer not to be understated.  Updated Sept 2012. I had a 750 bottle that I had sitting in the fridge for probably 2 years and I cracked it open on Labor Day. Upping the score on this beer as I can now really appreciate it (refined palate). Taste had a bunch more ripe fruit flavors with plum, grape, cherry, apple and a bit more caramel malt (probably due to the age). Not as sweet as stated in my initial review.

About one finger of head on this pour, but the buttermilk foam has a nice, thick consistency.  Chimay blue has a fairly tight nose. Aromas of brown bread and Fig Newtons dominate. There's a good hit of nutmeg here, maybe some sandalwood. But it is mostly maltiness.  The taste follows the nose to large degree. Lots of brown malt, and lots of figgy flavors. Heavy nutmeg spiciness, with, like, an herbal note (thyme?). Some green raisin. It's quite good, and very balanced. It's also...restrained. I love subtlety, but I wish the beer were just a bit more explosive.  The mouthfeel is absolutely perfect for the style. Perfectly soft carbonation. Perfect attenuation.

T - On the palate I mainly get the fruit that I smelled, but a dark cherry like flavor is the most prominent. The finish on this beer is interesting, sweetness, some hops, and a nice maltiness rounded it out.  M - Full-bodied, but not heavy, with some chewiness to it. The carbonation was perfect.

215,2512,TheCondor,4.57,"Picked up as part of a Chimay gift package that included red, white, and blue labels, plus a Chimay chalice that kicks ass. I think it is pretty gangsta when the beer and glassware match up brand wise. Anyway, side poured with standard vigor from the bottle into the glass.  Appearance - Pours the color of cherry wood, beautiful reddish brown color. Has about one finger of mocha head that recedes quickly and leaves little lacing. The color of this beer resembles a Scottish ale or wee heavy, which I love.  Smell - The big malts are the dominant force here. They power over you letting you know this is a big beer, in ABV, taste, and character. Dark fruits, a little yeast, and booze round out an excellent nose.  Taste - While the nose was good, the palate was even better, and followed the nose closely. The malts coat your tongue from front to back, while the fruits complement the flavors superbly.  Mouthfeel - Very smooth and creamy brew, finishes with a warmth that invites one to drink more. A slight booze in the aftertaste couplethe with the dark fruit is an excellent balance to the malts. superb drink ability, very easy to drink a lot of this.  Overall - I see what the hype is about. Excellent beer, obviously those monks know what they are doing. I fully plan on this becoming a staple of my drinking, as should you. Highly recommended.

The head was fizzy, off-white to khaki and seemed to retreat back into the beer without much left in its wake. The nose didn't quite have that usual strong Belgian yeast I expect in a Belgian strong. It was there, just muted. There are also hints of plums and dates with a lot of fizz. The taste again has a very muted Belgian yeast character. There is sweet dates and cherries, but it finishes farily dry, preventing it from becoming overly cloying. Mouthfeel is heavy on carbonation; alcohol is masked well. I have always passed by this beer because I felt it was probably priced higher than it was worth, and I am just not finding a taste for Belgians.

Smell - Malts, dark fruits, butterscotch/caramel, woodiness, musty  Taste & Mouth - There is a below average amount of carbonation and I can taste raisins/dates, malts, and some butterscotch/caramel. There is also a woodiness and a light smokiness. It ends with a dark fruit and malty/woody aftertaste with a light bitterness.  Overall - The cork came flying out as soon as I removed the cage - which I wasn't expecting. The amount of fizzy head lead me to believe there would be a lot of carbonation in the mouth, but it was fairly smooth.

215,2512,Jesse13713,4.26,"Doing a bit of procrastinating with this review, as I am having this to celebrate what is hopefully the last college paper I will ever have to write. I finally shelled out the twelve dollars for the large bomber. Lets hope these ancient monks brew some terrific beer for the price. Poured into a Maudite tulip glass.  Appearance - Just a side note - uncaging the cork of a bottle is always my favorite thing. The cork came out with extreme ease. I let the pressure shoot it up into my ceiling, watching as an eerie haze creeps over the mouth of the bottle and into the room. I had to rush my pour a bit as carbonation hurried to the lips of the bottle. A nice two finger pour of explosive, unstable looking head. The carbonation is more than alive as it pops, sparkles, and wheezes. This Belgian Strong is an oaky, malty looking mahogany color. Dark blood red meets the bark of a tree. Appears a bit fruity in appearance.  Smell - Balanced Belgian yeast hits me the hardest. Darker fruit notes attempt to dodge around the sweet malty background, but are distinguishable. Dark cherry and bloody pomegranate are the most noticeable. A faint, spritzy near-candy smell is also apparent. Fruity malts with faint bready malts behind them. Still, the aroma is tame and by no-means overpowering.  Taste - Definitely a fruity background to the body of the beer. Taste of black forest cherry cake without as much sweetness. Grappling pomegranate, plum and pluots. The taste of saturn peaches carries out the sweetness with a bit of almond mixed in. A tad pinch of coriander, as well as a very light amount of chocolate and chocolate raisins.  Mouthfeel and Drinkability - A bit heavy in the chest, as the carbonation fights right up until its swallowed alive. Alcohol is extremely well-balanced, and this brew avoids overdoing the notes of black cherry and coriander. An elastic and brisk burn that is not overdone. The brew can get a bit sweet at times, but it quickly balances itself out.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

This beer looks pretty in the glass, even with the chunks floating around in it. The smell is like a caramelized biscuit, sweet and malty with some good yeasty notes and light hints of fruits, molasses, brown sugars, candy sugars, and even a little citrusy tinge at the very end. It has a rich sweet taste like caramel and molasses. There is also a lingering flavor of dark fruit and, again, an ever so slight hint of citrus at the back of the taste along with a boozy back taste that can be quite strong. The taste is a little too sweet for my palate, reminiscent of sweet dark candies. It is oozing and thick in the mouth, however, which gives it a very nice feel. It is also a little cloying in the after effects on the mouth, leaving a thick wet trail of saliva on the tongue. Carbonation is nearly negligible in the taste. This is a nice dark Belgian with a lot of nice complex flavors in it. The sweet strikes a little too high in the initial gulp and lingers almost like a tingle in the edges of the mouth, but the mouthfeel is great, and the candied hints are virulently present in the taste. Overall it is a tasty dark Belgian ale, and a great example of the style.

Maybe cause I still prefer the Rochefort Trappistes family as far as Belgian ales are concerned. Maybe...just maybe cause I've also grown fond of beer straight from the tap rather than the bottle too in recent weeks.  For whatever reason, I found this beer to be good, not great. Maybe it's not fair as my comparison of styles is not a true ""apples for apples"" comparison. The blending and subtleties of flavor of the Rochefort Trappistes family as well as barley wine have captured my attention.  However you cut it, this beer isn't bad...it has a nice monolithic flavor but not as complex as the beers mentioned above. Ooops there I go again in the unfairness department.

Head of well-defined fine bubbles showed good retention, persisting throughout the session.  S: immediate soft, sweet dark fruits, like dates and figs, maybe some brown banana  T: crisper than the nose, bitterness tones down the fruitier notes and adds backbone. Now, you’re drinking.

However, that said, this beer is indubitably among the standards by which all beers of the style are compared. You can’t argue with 150 years of Trappist brewing. Take note: devotees of the style as well as advocates of beer in general should include this in their beer education.  2011 (?) bottling:  A: deep ruby brown; fine bubbled head settles into a rim and film, leaving speckles of lace up the sides  S: caramel malts, some dark fruit notes  T: fresh yeast tops the dark fruits and sweet malts; a little sweeter than I'd expected  M: medium-bodied, fizzy, tiny little sour notes remain in the aftertaste  O: I have heard this was a benchmark beer for the BSDA, and since I haven't had one since my first (before I started reviewing beer), I figured I should come back to it and check it out again. Yes, it is a true BSDA, but it is not my favorite BDSA - however, you need to try it if you like Belgian beers/strong dark ales.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

The beer has a finger tall pillowy beige head that reduces to a thin film over the entire surface of the beer with a slightly thicker ring at the edges of the glass. Light to moderate lacing is observed.  S: Overall, this beer has a rather sweet smell mostly dominated by dark fruit. There is a definite presence of plum along with a black cherry and grape. The aroma gets sweeter as the beer warms.  T: The taste follows the smell, with the beer having a good amount of sweetness. There is a dominant flavor of dark fruit - plum and black cherry - along with a light presence of spices. Very nice complexity.  M: Medium bodied with moderate to heavy amounts of carbonation. Extremely smooth though slightly dry in the finish.  O: The alcohol is very well hidden in this beer, making it slightly dangerous if you have more than one...

The sediment helped cloud the beer to make it opaque. There are aromas of dark fruits, malt, brown sugar, and yeast. There are tastes of bready dark malt, dark fruits like prunes and raisins, yeast, and brown sugar. The alcohol is present in the flavor as is some hop bitterness. It's very well balanced. The body is medium to full and the carbonation is quite lively. It's very easy to drink for such a strong beer. Overall, this is another excellent beer from the abbey. This is a top notch example of the style.

Dried/dark fruits with slight sugary and yeast notes on the back  T- Similar to the smell but luckily much brigther. Caramel malt base, then quite on the sugary side with loads of bright dark and dried fruit notes in evidence (prunes, cherries...).

Finishes on the earthy side, bringing balance to it's sweet overall feel, with yeast and a slight touch of refreshing hops. Very complex but still all perfectly integrated  M- Medium to full body, nicely creamy on the tongue and even more so on the palate, where flavours can still be felt after some seconds.

215,2512,Mrjwsjr,4.5,This was the beer that really got my quest started. I have always been a big fan of Guinness Draught and Stout. And while standing inline one day at wal-mart a gentleman with a handlebar mustache asked me if I had ever tried Chimay before. He said if I liked dark beers the Guinness that I would really like the Chimay so I went on a quest to find some no one close carried it so I wound up in Evansville one night with my brother-in-law and we steped into a liquor store and they had a sampler pack of all 3 of the Chimays and a glass. I purchased the pack and the quest was started. I liked all 3 of the Chimays but the Grande Reserve Blue is my favorite.,Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Taste: Like the aromas, it has a nice fruity character (raisins and plums) with some bready notes, caramel/toffee sweetness, spices, and some yeast.  Mouthfeel: It has a high carbonation with a nice overall balance and feel.

215,2512,Darkmagus82,4.67,"Poured from 750 ml bottle into snifter  Appearance – Pours a deep hazy brown color with hints of mahogany seen when held to the light. Upon pouring a one finger tan head is formed. The head fades with some swiftness to leave a nice amount lacing.  Smell – Dark fruits are heavy in the nose with nice prune, cherry, and raisin aromas. There is a yeasty, spicy, and malty aroma as well which meld nicely with the sweeter dark fruit aromas.  Taste- The taste starts out with a nice mix of dark bready malts and darker fruit flavors. These two tastes provide a very solid foundation with which the rest of the taste experience evolves from. More towards the middle the yeasty flavors detected in the nose come into fruition with some spice flavors coming into play as well. Toward the very end of the taste a lighter alcohol flavor develops along with a molasses flavor which when mixed with the bready malt and dark fruits leaves a rather satisfying aftertaste on the tongue.  Mouthfeel – The body is creamy and smooth. It coasts the tongue allowing all the flavors to really sit on the tongue to be experienced. The carbonation is on the medium side adding some tingling excitement on the tongue, but not too high to take away from the creaminess of the body.  Overall – A fantastic abbey beer. It’s renowned and a classic for a reason.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Smell: A traditional trappist belgian, fruit (plum, raisin) notes and a sugary maple base.  Mouthfeel: Crisp with a good bit of frothiness.  Taste: The best of the three main Chimay beers I've tried.

T- biscuit, spices, aged raisins, plums, cherrys, candy sugar and a splash of alcohol in the finish. Sweet start with a bitter finish.  M- A bit too fizzy in the wide-mouthed Orval glass but it did better in the Tulip. Medium bodied with a semi oily finish.  O- Very easy to drink and I could sip on this.

Looks great in the proper glass!  S: Rich, fruity aroma. Dark fruits and berries dominate, with a bready and malty presence too. It smells thick and full, and is pretty complex. Very inviting.  T: Sweet - very very fruity, once again getting berries. Surprisingly, got a definite taste of apple towards the end of the glass after every swirl. Malty too. I think I got a slight hint of toffee, hidden in the maltiness. Very complex, yielded new flavours as it got warmer and less carbonated.  M: Full bodied and rich. Slightly dry, very satisfying. Carbonation is initially lively on the tongue. Warming sensation of the alcohol lovely.  Overall: Stellar. One of my favourites now. It's been a while since I had the Premiére, so I'll have to try that again soon to compare, but the G.R. could very well be better in my opinion. Either way an extremely enjoyable beer, one that I would strongly recommend. A must for any Belgian Ale fan (or just ale fan in general).

The beer was a dark burnt orange color with an absolutely dreamy sandy-white head. It was big and frothy and never EVER left the top of the beer. From the top down, this beer looked like a milkshake. The nose was yeasty and bready and had hints of berries.  Taste is malty and fruity. There are slightly sweet bready, malty notes and some fruit flavors. I get primarily berries, plums, raisins, and a slight touch of ginger. The carbonation is quite high and really excites your tastebuds and complements the creamy feel of the beer nicely. It's a joy to drink.  I decided a while ago that I would buy two bottles of this every year and store them in the basement. To date, I have bought far more than I have actually drank.

The alcohol really starts to become pronounced toward the back end and dominates the finish which ends up being a little astringent  The Rest: Cork says it was bottled on 03/11.

S: Deep dark scent of malt and extra dark honey. Smells of dark dried fruits, raisins, cherries and plums all mixed together. All the scents smell slightly toasted - as if left to caramalize until a sticky heady scent. Try the smell over and over as the beer warms - it changes incredibly form start to finish.  T: A mixed combination of complex flavours make this beer a sipping beer over a refreshing thrust buster. Flavours of dried raisins, cherries, plums, mixed with toasted maltiness and coco powder balance together with a hint of pepper and cloves. It's not that far off the flavours of a good panforte (christmas cake), without the over sweet cloyiness that might be associated with rich sipping drinks like port.  M: medium bodied and starts out high carbonate. you might find a little alcohol burn, which I actually enjoy.

S: Belgian yeast, strong phenol alcohol, and some really dank figs and raisins. There is some biscuit character present but not a ton.  T: Fairly tame compared to the nose. The balance is the most notable. The flavors meld together nicely and no one dimension stands out above the rest. Yeast interplays with the dark fruit and leaves you with some bread quality.

There is a tan two-finger head that seems to dissipate rather quickly. There is, however, a nice amount of lacing left on my glass as I drink.  Smell: I seriously smell brownies. Maybe hints of cocoa mixed with a biscuit-like odor create this brownie smell? There is also a slight bit of fruit essence in the back, with a barely discernible zest.  Taste: Wow, delicious indeed. Dark malty goodness, cocoa, dark cherries/fruits, slightly roasty, definite biscuit flavor. Very minor bitterness that stops as soon as you swallow. The alcohol burn is there, but the taste is excellently hidden!  Mouthfeel: Moderate carbonation, moderate to light body, slightly smooth and creamy.

215,2512,sommersb,4.42,"Tasted On: 02-07-2012 Freshness: Not indicated Packaging: 330 ml brown bottle Glassware: Chimay chalice Purchased: Gift pack from Frugal MacDoogal, Nashville  Color is a very dark burgundy, capped by a dense, tan head of two fingers. Very little lacing but there is good head retention.  Aromas are complex and inviting, with dark fruit notes, grapes, malty toffee sweetness and a musty yeast trait as well.  This is a highly carbonated beer, which is the first thing I noticed. Taste is a nice balance between sweetness and dryness. Flavors include ripened dark fruits such as raisin and plum, along with caramel malts and spices. No hop bitterness is perceived.  A full-bodied ale, with a noticeable alcohol presence. The aftertaste presents the balance previously noted of the malt sweetness and dryness of the yeast. I would prefer it to be a bit less carbonated, however.  Overall, this is a strong and elegant beer that makes an excellent treat at the end of the day.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,jcomp21,5,I love this beer! It was like cherries and strawberries with a smooth finish. It was my first trappist and I didn't know what to expect. I somehow thought I didn't like Belgian ales but I tried it with a bunch of other beers and it was my favorite BY FAR. Soooo tastey!!,Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

T- Plums,figs,blueberries and dry fruits present,a slightly warm touch coming from alcohol,sweet and dry finish,hops are present just to balance malty flavors.

215,2512,BrownNut,3.87,"They say to age this, but I didn't want to wait. So take into account that this review is of a version only eight months in the bottle.  A - Dark copper. Loose, fizzy, foamy head that bubbles down to a stable, solid film within five minutes and erodes slowly after that  S - Pleasant combination of fruit and yeast that meets in the middle somewhere near wine. Also caramel and maybe butter. The caramel is more evident deeper in the glass  T - Initially there's somethinge bordering on metallic that, later in the glass, merges into caramel. Behind that, and more noticeably on the exhale, is something more pleasant, a combination of fruit and booze. It hides the alcohol well.  M - Initially dry yet somehow still soft in the middle and then ending dry again. Interesting!  O - Pleasant, but less complex and robust than I'd hoped for. Wish I'd cellared it. I'll buy one more and try that. Otherwise a second one wouldn't bring me back.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Two finger cream colored head that eventually fades to nothing and won't come back, No lacing due to high abv I suppose.  S - Best part of the beer, lots of dark fruit and carmalized sugar on the smell, with a touch of vanilla mmm.  T - Lots of sugar, dark fruit - raisin/fig/date, and vanilla (too much vanilla imo). The ending leaves a taste of vanilla and is dried out a touch by the hops. Alcohol is present and in this beer I don't enjoy it showing its ugly head.  M - medium to full bodied with a relatively smooth mouthfeel, needs to be drank at 50 degrees +  O - A good beer for the holidays or dessert but not my favoritve.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Already halfway drunk by the time i am writing this review so I apologize.  A - Dark cloudy brown with ruby highlights. Lacing is superb and the head lasts forever. With this glass, you can see the bubbles almost oozing to the top from the etch in the middle of the glass. Awesome.  S - Probably the weakest point of this beer. Smells of yeast and dark malt. Kind of get some dried fruit smell in there but not too prevalent.  T - Dark and sweet. Caramel and plums galore. Indescribable flavor. It manages to capture great aspects of many different styles. There is a slight hop bitterness on the finish.  M - Medium to heavy body with ample carbonation. Maybe even a little too much.  O - An amazing experience with an amazing trappist ale.

I am new to Chimay so I picked up a bottle based on the advice from the knowledgeable beer salesman who said this is his favorite. Poured from bottle to Duvel tulip. The beer pours a deep mahogany color with huge 3 finger tan colored head. Excellent retention and lacing. Bits of yeast sediment settle slowly. The aroma is nice, belgian yeast with it's characteristic clove aroma thought subtle is detectable. Thick malts, almost syrup like character. The taste is incredibly smooth: mild sweetness with mild bitterness, fig/plum fruitiness, thick caramel, hints of pepper. Very rich. Well crafted. I am amazed at how these Trappist brews hide their high alcohol so well. I could drink this all day long. Higher end of medium bodied and well carbonated. Very pleased with this beer. Highly recommended.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Scent leads with dark fruits and aromatic spices, some dark, sweet malts and dark bread also present. Taste leads with full notes of dark fruit, blends well with strong notes of clove, moderate sweetness and breadyness. Medium bodied, lightly bubbly. Overall, while many would rank this #1 or #2 on the Chimay scale, it falls down to #3 for me.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,StJamesGate,3.93,"Glowing chestnut and an athletic loose but creamy and lumpy beige head that fades to a puckering steady layer of film that webs. Muted nose - clove, spice cake and a bit of beeswax candle. Ginger cake, light plum, some toffee crisp, hints of incense, and a kaleidoscope of spices to end. Chutney finish and numbing clove linger. Light to medium, gently fizzy, some chew, creamy.  Beautifully seamless, like so many of the greatest beers. And yet I find myself wondering if that's the case here, or if there's actually not that much there. I know the rep of this beer has taken a hit over the years, and this is just not as deep, distinctive or compelling as it's classic status would suggest. The skill of the brewers is undeniable; the beer, sadly, is only very good.  Part smoke and mirrors, part real magic.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Tiny tan colored bubbles dissipate to a nice cap of head with fantastic retention. Small amount of lacing on the sides of the glass.  S - Subtle syrupy smell  T - Taste is very smooth and subtly sweet, flavors of dark fruit (plums?), caramel with some alcohol and floral notes, a smooth pleasant, slightly peppery finish. Well carbonated.  M - Medium mouthfeel which seems lighter due to the bubbly carbonation feel in the mouth.  O - An incredibly smooth, rich and flavorful beer. The best by far of what Chimay has to offer. What I can buy in stores here in the US tastes just as good as the one I had outside the abbey in Belgium.

215,2512,evlu1441,4.22,"I've had this bottle in my fridge for about 2 years now, and I decided that today would be the day I finally try it. I poured it into the Chimay chalice that came with it. The glass has certainly seen better days, but I expect the beer will be better than ever!  It pours a very dark brown that looks more amber when held up to the light. It's surprisingly clear, and I can see a bunch of sediment floating around (poor pouring technique on my part). The head is thin but very fine and fluffy. It's exactly what I imagine when I think of a Belgian beer in terms of appearance.  The aroma is outstanding! Age has done a lot to smooth out some of the sharp yeast and carbon dioxide aroma that I noticed with the other Chimay beers. Hints of vanilla come through very faintly, and hints of dried fruits fill things out. There is a hint of banana in the background. The whole aroma is wrapped in a faint spiciness. Nothing is too overpowering here, and the aromas remain subtle.  The taste is very smooth, and much less intense than I remember. The malt profile is complex, starting out sweet, and smoothly moving through several smooth toffee/vanilla/cake stages. it leaves some lingering sweetness and an aromatic and slightly woody aftertaste. The alcohol is undetectable.  Overall, this is a nice ale and surprisingly easy drinking. At the same time, it's hard to say exactly what makes it distinctive. A good brew nonetheless.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,BMoldy,3.93,"A: Looks a lot like the Red, but a darker shade of brown and more opaque. Mocha-colored head settles nice and slowly. No lacing, but that's likely my wet, overused glass.  S: Molasses and dark fruit. A little bit of alcohol.  T/M: Some smooth caramel malt mixed with alcohol. Much bolder than the Red, with more familiar flavors. Hint of vanilla. Warm, solvent alcohol on the finish. Medium/medium-heavy in body, with a very subdued and inoffensive carbonation. Alcohol can be a little much at times though.  O: Outshine its little red brother, but I'm still not the biggest fan. Too much alcohol and not enough other flavors to really make it worth it, in my opinion.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,Drinkerofales,4.35,"Poured into my Chimay Goblet, which I received as a gift about 8 years ago from Sam, thanks.  Pours an opaque brown with hints of red and gold. A large dirty tan head dissipates rather quickly to a 1/8"" ring.  Smells of the special Belgian yeast, gotta love that. A hint of spice and fruity dark raisins are also present.  First taste is earthy spices, allspice and clove, but not overpowering. Middle is almost roasted malt and caramel, and that great yeast. There is a shadow of the alcohol here, but it's done well.  Feels very bubbly and not quite light. A tangy yeast accompanies the medium bodied beer. Though quite strong, this feels somewhat easy to drink.  I truly enjoyed this beer. It has all the spice and great flavors I like from this style. The balance and complexity are woven together in this excellent beer, which I will be drinking more often.

S: Very nice dark fruity malty sweetness pairing with very nice chocolate/caramel and a hint of hops  T: Complex flavors starting with dark fruitiness going into the chocolate and caramel sweetness and adding a hint of hop bitterness at the end leaving a somewhat dry finish. Very enjoyable.  M: Very nice carbonation that can be seen proceeding throughout the beer complementing the classic Trappist syrupy lightness that balances well.  After sampling some of the other Trappist ales, I can now detect some of the faults in this brew, however when compared to anything other than a Trappist, this brew is a cut above.

Pours a beautiful deep red/brown. You can see the bubbles coming up to keep around the off white/tan head that settles down fairly quickly. Slight lacing.  Sweet dark fruits and alcohol.  You get the same dark fruits and alcohol in taste along with a bread and some spice.  Lots of carbonation on the tongue but still feels thick and creamy and smooth and wonderful. The carbonation kinda died out as I came to the bottom of the glass which was a bummer. I drank it kinda slow but still.  This was the first Belgian beer I had months and months ago albeit in the 750 ml format. It blew my mind with all the carbonation and dark fruity taste. It doesn't seem as great now that I am a into “craft” beer as I originally thought, but it made me realize what beer can be and I will continue drinking this well into the future.

T - Like the other Chimay ales, this one also feels very simplified, but sort of muted. Dark fruits, a little bit of spices, yeast, the usual, but nothing really stands out. Alcohol is easily picked out, but the flavor somehow still remains exceptionally drinkable. Maybe some figs, a touch of licorice, and plum.  M - PERFECT smoothness. Thick body, low carbonation.

Then on top there is a creamy eggshell white head that makes the beer look like a cappuccino. Just wonderful appearance all round.  Smell: Very fresh, and surprisingly subtle. There is no overwhelming feature of the aroma, there is just a nice blend of sweet, dark fruits and a light breadiness that is opened up through the champagne like effervescence.  Taste: Right away you get the dark fruits, but not in the traditional sweetness you find in other examples. This fruity character is slightly bitter at first, then a light sweetness comes in with the breadiness and rounds out the beer. The flavor is so bold and so well rounded, it makes for a joy to savor each and every sip.  Mouthfeel: The carbonation perfectly suits the flavor and all of the robust fruit and yeast character adds up to a full body. The perfect balance does not stop here.  Overall: About as much perfection as you can find anywhere. There is nothing off-putting about this beer, every aspect just burst free in your mouth in perfect harmony. I can not complain about anything, it exceeds any expectation I have and is well worth the $11 I paid for the 750.

I would place this near the top for best bang for the buck.  As I have done many times before, I poured this into a snifter. You get two fingers of foam that dissipate into a very thin scum on top.

215,2512,Agent1,4.92,"Being such a sucker for Chimay's Dubbel and Tripel, this bottle of the official Blue Cap is almost guaranteed to deliver. Founded inside Scourmont Abbey, in the Belgian municipality of Chimay in 1862, this beer has a staggering history and worth every dollar spent. Let's see what it has to offer:  Appearance - Very dark (almost black) with heavy caramel/ brown coloration when held up to the light. Looks to be rather heavy and complex, like melted brown sugar and molasses. Excellent head retention with a mouth-watering texture. Incredibly creamy. Awesome lacing, too.  Smell - Malty and sweet. Lots of figs and brown sugars present. Bread and yeast are noticeable as well with subtle lemon and hops. Toffee and dark cherries. A faint spice is traceable. So much to pick up here!  Taste - Dark cherries, rich brown sugar, figs, coriander, light coffee/ spice, bitter orange peel (not much, though), a little woody with a peppery aftertaste. The dry hops with coriander really balance out the fermented sugars. Quite complex. The 9% alcohol may not be fully disguised, but it almost adds a certain 'bite' to this Trappist ale.  Mouthfeel - Smooth, but not. Again, the alcohol creates a clean, cutting edge to this ale. Perhaps not quite as hidden as I would like, yet it still works. Also, not the most chewy or thick of the Trappist beers, but it really sits in the mouth well and stimulates the palate throughout.  Overall - The strongest of the three ales produced by Bières de Chimay. I am a big fan of the Tripel, and the Dubbel is great, too. But the Grande Réserve is a step above. Boasting strong characteristics, it is no wonder that this beautiful Belgian Quad is held in such high regard under the ""Authentic Trappist Product"" name.

I let it get too cold and was getting very little in the nose, so I set it aside for about 20min and came back to it. The most prominent feature is the molasses-y sweetness. The alcohols and phenols are readily apparent. A peppery spiciness also is present. A floral bouquet.  T: Malts are syrupy sweet but also dark fruity. Some bitterness, perhaps from the malts. Persistent finish that is reminiscent of a whiskey.  M: High carbonation and considerable alcohol warmth, one or both of which contribute to the tingly-hot tongue sensation. Medium body.  Notes: I am really torn as to how I should rate this beer. It is the classic Belgian Dark Strong Ale, and yet, I struggled to enjoy it. Furthermore, the balance was lacking: the molasses sweetness completed overpowered the more subtle and delicate flavors: the esters, the phenols, the alcohols. And while I said that the finish was dry, it was hard to assess. The finish was big and almost cloying. The afterbirth was nice, whiskey-like as I said, but it took a long time to get there. This beer has the subtle flavors that are characteristic of this style, but the balance was not there. It took a deep patience to get to the subtle and complex symphony of flavors because of the misplaced child banging the cymbal of sweetness.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Head is THICK... comes off about 3/4 to a full inch off my glass.  Taste: I love the way this beer comes off, what I hate after doing quite a bit of servings of cheese pairing with it..just feels like it goes away. Tastes like a million bucks but spends like it. Believe me I can spend a million bucks that quickly and so can you.  Mouth: Perfect and I do mean perfect medium carbonation. After taste isn't pleasant it is what they call yummy and I do mean yummy.  Overall: Drinking half off this bottle before even looking it up, I must say....I need more.

Crystal clear mahogany brown color w/ a thick khaki head, good bright carbonation.  Aroma is dark malt and yeast with some fruitiness. Some raisins, figs, and alcohol detected as it warms - even later picking up some dry winelike characteristics.  Taste is caramel malt, candi sugar, some toffee/brown sugar and dark fruit. As I get toward the bottom of the bottle and the carbonation subsides it takes on a slighly vinous quality with the sweet acidic taste of dark grapes becoming increasingly evident.  Mouthfeel is dry, clean, and a little prickly from the carbonation. Smoother as time progresses.

215,2512,frankiepop,3.5,"I got a little mad when I first drank Chimays. I knew the French had wonderful food and wine of course, but some of the best beers too? damn that's too much domination especially if you are learning that about 10 years ago or so because if you were a soccer fan, the French were dominating the world there too. Plus the French were proved right at that time concerning weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. No wonder the French get a little arrogant.  First I just love Chimay tripel style beer with white label. It's one of my favorites. I am not fond of the red label, but today I am review a dubbel style beer with the blue label by Chimay.  Many beer connisseurs find blue to be world class if not one of the top 3 or 4 beers in the world. I rate it a little lower.  Ok it spawns a little smoke upon opening and has a nice pour of brown ale with some murkiness with a good firm tan head.  Blue has a nice smell that is not too complex, but it is rather straight forward mildly sweet and earthy that all seems to sum up as nice.  The taste to me is clean crisp dark ale with just a slight fruitiness. The alcohol taste is a just a bit too strong and apparent for my taste. Some just love the balance here. This is many a beer drinkers favorite. Again we have a straight forward taste that is refreshing to me, but that's about it. I consider the after taste simply delightful.  I am not emotionally stunned by this beer that's all - not stunned. I am impressed, just not stunned. I wanna be stunned. My experience really shows that Chimay is a beer that individuals seems to like or love so don't disregard this beer. It may be the beer you will love best of all. This is a quality product.

215,2512,flyingpig,4.64,"This was a 2010 bottle, cellared for around 9 months and poured into a teku glass.  Pours a dark sort of reddish brown almost chestnut colour with a tan white head about two fingers width high. The head appears quite bubbly that stays put for quite some time before finally reducing to a thin lacing over the surface of the beer. It may have something to do with the fancy teku glass I poured it into but even after the head recedes this one still looks fantastic.  Surprisingly sweet but still not overly, it smells of dark roasted malts and a strong but very pleasant alcohol aroma to it. There is a fair bit of fruit to this one as well like dates and perhaps some fig. I also detected some brown sugar and vanilla as well but this seems to come and go. As the beer sits and gets a chance to open up a little some chocolate and spice become more pronounced as well. A very complex smelling beer & one that is great on the nose.  Again quite sweet upfront with a a faint alcohol kick to it that is part sugar, part spice. Some good chocolatey malts and hints of caramel along with the dark fruits noted in the smell. An amazing taste to this one with a malty sweetness and a great creamy taste added to the fact the beer is incredibly well balanced and tastes great.  Medium bodied and quite rich on the palate with medium carbonation. It is really smooth and goes down much easier than a 9% beer should. There is still a solid alcohol kick to it and the finish is relatively light in bitterness.  Simply amazing, this beer is without a doubt one of the best I have tried so far. It has great depth and an fantastic smell coupled with a solid feel and brilliant taste, it's almost perfect. No doubt one that I'll find myself going back to time and time again, perhaps not quite as much as some slightly less rich beers but definitely a world class ale & one that you should definitely try if you haven't already.

215,2512,jbowers56,4.2,"Ah, Chimay. The old standby, and one of my first truly inspiring craft beer experiences.  Forms a slightly larger bubbled head than im used to with this style, but stays around for a good amount of time. Laces well. A deep brown colour with some golden hues.  Good one. Plenty of ripe fruits - pear, fig and even perhaps some orange. A lot lighter on the nose than I remember. Some of that typical belgian phenolic profile presents itself as well. All supported by a rich malty presence. Unmistakeably belgian.  Overcarbed. Perhaps not Chimay's fault, it's gone a long way. Alright, swirled it a lot and now lets get down to business. Big malty presence, more so than on the nose. Seems to lean more on brown/special malts than super dark malts for the flavours and colour here. Toffee, and christmas pudding is what i'm getting. Those fruity notes are there, but maybe some banana bread also coming in. A very, very good beer. Spicy phenolics and hop bitterness blend perfectly to balance this big belgian ale.  The overcarbonation hasn't helped the mouthfeel. It's full, but also just a touch hollow.  A good beer, for sure.

215,2512,doktorhops,4.58,"Review #100. Something special = Chimay Blue.  I've been wanting to polish off this bottle since trying (and loving) Duvel, but I wanted to make it a special occasion, and what could be more special than a century of reviews? Well many things, but let's not think long and hard about that whilst waiting for our Chimay to get up to temperature. Let's think about the last 99 brews; the triumphs, the surprises, the mediocre, the God awful *cough*VB*cough* and all the other tastes in the rich global tapestry that is beer culture, viva beer!  Poured from a 750ml corked bottle (got to have it corked people) into a large brandy glass.  A: This has got to be the brownest brown I've ever seen in a beer; my colour wheel states the body is a deep chocolate and the head is a firm 1.5cm fawn.  S: In a word; nice. You know you're in for a 9% ale here - the aromas are rich candied fruits, toffee, toasted biscuit and morello cherries. A very sweet and full fragrance, fantastic but not quite as good as Duvel which is more crisp and pear/apple based, however this is my personal preference.  T: Bold, very bold flavours here. They begin with a heavy biscuit base followed by the sour cherries the sweet candied fruits (think again cherries but also with added figs and plums), slight hop bitterness and a long dry finish. Super effort here. Duvel's evil twin if I had to pick it; Duvel is all crisp and light whereas this is dark and heavy. There is an alcohol note towards the end, but of course it is a 9% beer! [duh]  M: Very even bodied brew for the ABV - mid to heavy with medium carbonation and the dryness of Blue means that it doesn't cloy the palate like the other heavy beers out there.  D: The more Belgian Tripels I drink the more I'm beginning to believe that it isn't all about hops - it's yeast that makes an outstanding brew. Think about it: every Belgian brewer talks about the ""mystical yeast"" strain that they've isolated and keep in a large concrete vault 500 meters underneath their abbey which is guarded by cyborg gorillas that feed off the remains of beer aficionados and international spies that attempt to steal the formula. It's all about the yeast people! Anyhow I digress, how is Chimay Blue overall? It's a very close second place to Duvel in my opinion. However going off taste alone is difficult because everyone has their own taste and another mans Duvel may be another mans Victoria Bitter, ergo: beer is in the taste of the beer-taster.  Food match: Chimay Blue is so dry that it's a palate cleansing beer, i.e. game on when it comes to food. However I would recommend a meal befitting the quality (and cost) of this brew; caviar, lobster, truffles, foie gras, rare mushrooms that can only be purchased in Japan, baby panda's, etc.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

A beautiful color between Claret and Umber or a few shades deeper than a fine Sherry. Noticeable carbonation provides a thick Cappuchino colored head that takes a long time to settle and leaves a creamy coat of lacing.  A dark fruit nose reminiscent of Dates and Figs with some alcohol esters and a molasses like sweetness and just a whiff of hops.  A soft and supple mouthfeel which glides effortlessly around the tongue.  Malty, sweet and boozy, lots of dark fruits here including some dark cherry and some tongue tipped bitterness on the fade.

After my pour, the section of label that had touched my hand was attached and looked like pieces of ash. Just wonderful. Prepare to read ""for its age"" a lot.  A - Interesting. The bottle opened with a nice hiss. Poured a light brown, lighter of course than a fresh pour. Acceptable amount of lacing, which returned upon sifting. For its age, it looks great.  S - Not quite as much musty aroma as I'd expected, but it's there. Little bit of bread, little bit of malt. Not too powerful.  T - Actually pretty good. The flavors have combined well together and created a smooth flavor. The dust flavor upfront and significant dryness at the end made this interesting for me.  M - Well it couldn't be much better for its age, but it could certainly be worse. A little thin, but that's because most of the body was stuck to the bottom of the bottle.  O - I'm giving this one an exceptional overall score. I'd happily drink it again, but that could be more of a personal preference than a recommendation.

215,2512,magictacosinus,4.65,"Poured out of a 330ml bottle into a Duvel tulip. Freshness date is listed as ""2016"" on the bottle.  Pours a darkened, reddish color that makes it look like a strong cherry cola. With its unfiltered look, barely any light shines through this glass. Poured a massive head definitely aided by the glass, and it sticks around for quite a while - making giving this beer a lovely presentation all in itself.  The aroma is malty as all hell, but there are definitely other wonderful complexities that come with it. Fruity aromas are all over, and this is a beer that people love to match flavors together. Molasses and raisins are pretty obvious here, but I'm definitely getting huge notes of cherries and plums in particular. The hoppy quality is superb here - I've been drinking Chimays for quite a while and nothing really smells like them due to the hops. Admittingly, this is the first time that I try this beer. Their dubbel is one of my all-time favorites, and the Grande Réserve only brings those aromas to a whole new beastly level. The extra ABV definitely helps, but it's not what this beer is all about. Here, we focus on malts first and foremost.  Moving on to the taste, did I mention malts?! Holy crap, this is more creamy than I expected it to be - I should have suspected so, though, as it is technically a quad. Nevertheless, the fruity flavors are more subtle than I expected them to be, and the same goes for the bitterness/sweetness variations that this brew is going for. The alcohol is not noticeable at all, which makes this a deadly beer indeed. It's an extremely well-balanced quad and doesn't try to overpower the palate. Instead, it relaxes and chills the tongue with a variety of flavors that come together in a fantastic way.  At first I wasn't going to call taste the forté of this brew, but it's so balanced for how ridiculous the recipe is that it's ultimately perfect, in the end. Great mouthfeel, too. The alcohol burns the throat a bit with each gulp, but it's on the warming side than the overwhelming side. Creamy, smooth, unique... how could you not enjoy drinking it?  Nevertheless, for all this beer has going for it, it's definitely not something I'd get any time of the day, on any week of the month. It's a truly special, life-affirming beer that should be consumed to be appreciated alone, like a nice aged bottle of wine or cognac. Treat it like a session beer and you will not appreciate it as much. Ultimately, treat it with respect. Abbaye Scourmont really displays their brewing techniques here with what is presumably the first pioneering quad to jump-start the style. It's beers like the Grande Réserve that make people understand what beer can be, and its unlimited prowess for achieving complex flavor and body like nothing else.  UPDATE: Tried a 1.3 year old 330ml bottle earlier, and while I don't think the other two by Chimay are superior when aged, this is completely true for Chimay bleue. The aromas resemble a thick raspberry-strawberry drink like nothing else, and the drinking experience is far maltier and yeastier, yet extremely smooth to the point of extreme relaxation. Highly recommended aging 750ml bottles of this for a year or two - you won't regret it.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,TheAlamoWrocker,4.26,"Poured from a 11.2 oz bottle, March 18 of 2006, into a Snifter.  Appearance  Center is a strong dark brown with it's edges a shade of sienna. This is a beautiful look that appears heavy, but not too heavy. The head is 2 fingered and lacing remains strong while the carbonation rises to the top. There was actually a small amount of head which was dark brown. I couldn't believe this until I saw how the cap of the bottle had the same quality color to it. I could only assume this is sediment that was built up over time.  Smell  The smell has an IPA quality. The alcohol in this drink does seem apparent and strong. Strong malts with a background of sweetness. If one lets this beer settle enough then fragrances of prunes rises to the top and it's quite amazing, so one has to take their time to truly enjoy this drink.  Taste  Sweetness is what hits the tongue but bitterness is throughout and even stays as a nice aftertaste which lingers quite beautifully. A taste of raisins hit in the back of the mouth, but then a hint of chocolate is detected which comes and leaves quickly. If it doesn't leave the bitter aftertaste then an alcohol taste is left over instead. The warmer the drink gets the more harder the alcohol actually hits the palate very much like an IPA which I thought the smell was similar to.  Mouthfeel  The mouthful is interesting to say the least. It has carbonation which flows throughout the mouth which almost makes it feel like the mouthful gets larger within the mouth. The reason why it probably gets larger is just it hitting the mouth which makes it more active, but still wow.  Overall  The mouthful is probably what did it for me to make it as interesting as it was. The taste is easily something I need to try again and again to taste everything which this drink has to offer. This beer was quite nice and I would definitely buy it again over the selection that is offered it my town.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,BryanRex,4.37,"A world class beer, although it's the most expensive beer I've ever reviewed given it's exceptionally high cost per unit alcohol volume. The cost is so high that it's almost prohibitive to drink considering the competition. Like most Belgian Strong Dark Ales, it's very malty and pours a muddy burgundy-brown with a thick creamy head. It smells great - like candy sugar, raisin, plums and spice. Up to this point it's about perfect, but on the first sip things start to go downhill a bit. The complex blend of flavor is somewhat disjointed, and the lack of carbonation makes it feel somewhat watery. Unlike a rich malty doppelbock, this doesn't feel much like a meal in a glass, but more like a seasonal cider. It's definitely sweet, spicy and delicious, but in my opinion there are better beers given the prohibitive cost. Try St. Bernardus Abt 12, The Sixth Glass or Aventinus Eisbock to get more flavor and spend less duckets.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,bobhits,2.54,"Ah Trappest so far I’ve found this word to mean “awful beer.” Lets see if my memory of this “grand reserve” are justified.  Pours a deep rusted dark orange/red color. The head is full of tiny little bubbles often associated with pour head retention and lacing, but none of that here. A strong head and nice lacing all around. I made some effort to decant for the appearance, but this one is murky.  Sour hops and weak malt are the opening. Alcohol makes itself noticed as well. A sort of rum and spice with some dark fruits is in here but this aroma is normally far far better.  The flavors are far more enjoyable than the nose thankfully. Extremely complex blend of slight bitterness, sour notes, spices, and malt perfectly placed to not distract but enhance the other flavors. I can certainly see aging this beer for a decade to kill the hops and bring out the malt more. I’m not a huge malt lover, but here the hops are pleasant and really the different flavors don’t fully mingle well. Bottle if I’m reading it correctly is around a year old.  Those tight bubbles make for an over carbonated mouthfeel, but far making the beer hard to consume. Body some off rather medium to style because of this and as a result it isn’t good or bad.  Certainly not as bad as I recall which means I’m becoming more and more tolerant to these odd flavors. That said one should expect more based on the hype, cost, and well the reputation of Trappest beers. Oh and just a bit of advice to Chimay, this beer should be served in 6-7 oz bottles.

Nothing but dark fruits and alcohol, except for perhaps a touch of sugary sweetness. It's fairly mellow and quite pleasant, but a long way from the depth and complexity present in the best examples of the style.  T: Better here, with some great clove and cinnamon spiciness joining the candied fruit. Big raisins and prunes, light molasses, and a mixture of spice and booze on the finish. Quite tasty, but still a little uninspiring.  M: Highly carbonated, slightly prickly, and a bit light for the style.  O: I've had this a number of times now, and this is probably the best it's ever tasted to me - and as my rating shows, I'm still not a huge fan. I can certainly see how this beer is popular, since it's both tasty and widely available. I just don't think that it's in the same league as the best Trappist Quads (Westvleteren 12, Rochefort 10) or even the best secular ones (Malheur 12, St. Bernardus Abt 12, Cuvee Van de Keizer Blauw, the various Pannepot variations).

Smell -- Traces of sweet, sugary plum, as well as dates (personal favorite of mine).  Taste -- carbonation is the first sensation to touch the tongue. Quickly, plums and dates come to the forefront, as well as hints of chocolate, molasses, and malts. The aftertaste is sweet and yeasty. Hops are very subdued. Alcohol is almost impossible to detect, which can be quite deceptive as this is 9.00% ABV.

I even got Chimay cheese from a local store to accompany this and after pouring this out, there was no doubt that this was one of the classics. Sure, this is strong in taste, but this beer should be sampled by any aficionado and although this took me a while to work my way through, it was well worth the time!  This had quite a pour to it, with a raisin hue and a head that filled up my glass long before I emptied the contents of the bottle out. Once that finally settled, there was quite a bit of booze in the aroma and a decent amount of lacing on the sides of my glass. The taste was great, with notes of plum, cherry, and prune, with just a hint of pumpernickel as well. This was not a beer that I could down quickly but the flavors worked well together and there was enough sugar in the aftertaste to linger into the next sip.  Of course, this is strong, but there's a reason that this is a classic. This is so flavorful that it would pair well with most dinner foods or would be solid enough to savor by itself. As a beer, it makes the transition from dinner to dessert well and proves that a great beer can be subtle and unchanged throughout the ages.

215,2512,damndirtyape,3.63,"330mL bottle poured into a Tulip glass. Date stamp of L11-66.  Appearance: Slow pour to keep the sediment in the bottle gave a very hazy dark brown beer - dark brown with some orange and red highlights. The foam on top was a persistent 1/3"" thick and light tan in color. Foam was really large celled, with a constant stream of bubbles coming up from the bottom replenishing the foam. Islands of lacing here and there and some constantly changing strands near the surface of the foam since the sheets of foam slide back down the glass with every sip. The color isn't doing much for me, but the foam is fun to watch.  Smell: Yeasty with a bit of a musty smell. Some fruity esters thrown in for good measure - a bit of cherry I think. Mild boozy and alcohol notes carrying everything along, but in a very nice way. Enjoyable to take a deep sniff of.  Taste: Quick sweetness at the start of the sip, then a roasted/toasted grain/bread flavor. Gets a bit sweeter as it warms up, but there is a strong finish the whole way through this beer. The finish is tart, like tart sour cherries. It's not mouth-puckering tart, but it's there and quite notable.  Mouthfeel: Creamy and effervescent all at the same time. Well carbonated but not fizzy.  Overall / Drinkability: A beer for sipping and savoring, but I think it would be good with the right meal. Interesting, but not my favorite Belgian Dark Strong Ale, nor my favorite Trappist ale.

S: Very pleasant malt smell to it. A hint of fruit, but the malt is where it is at here.  T: Very complex and malty taste to it, has some fruits behind it. Taste seems to finish off with the fruit so that is a nice touch. You can taste a bit of the alcohol to it. This gets better as it calms down and sits for a bit in my opinion.  M: Complicated and tastes heavy, finishes nice. Nice carbonation on there. More than I would prefer, but it doesn't bother me in this beer.  O: A very good and widely available Trappist. If I need a beer to go to, this one is always good for a try. If you prefer a Rochefort, or even a St. Bernadus, those beers are better, but harder to find.

S: The beer smells sweet and heavily spiced. Malty and bready tones are also evident in the aroma with a candy like sweetness.  T: The beer is very sweet and candy-like. There is an underlying caramel and faint coffee flavor. The alcohol is present but very well hidden.  M: The mouthfeel is creamy and rich. Super smooth on the palate and low carbonation.

Light cherry with caramel. Belgian spice as well.  A very sweet beer. Cloying at first, but this sensation mellows out by the second glass. tartly bitter in the end.

A: Pours clear deep ruby with two-inch head that collapses quickly and leaves no appreciable lacing. Exuberant effervesce.   S: Treacle, dark, dried fruits such as raisins and figs, caramel. Additional aromas include cherry, port and oxidation.   T: Taste is much more mellow than I expected, with the individual characteristics evident in the smell having been worn down. This beer is also drier than my nose lead me to believe, and that is also to the detriment to this beer. Dark bread, caramel, raisins, and spice are the main players. Mild bitterness joins in before a finish that has a strange numbing antiseptic note flashing across palate.   M: Medium body and medium-light carbonation. Light and thin on palate.   O: For a beer that shares the great smells I associate with world-class English barleywines and doppelbocks, Chimay Grand Réserve certainly disappoints me in other categories. It is not bad, per se, but definitely not impressive. ",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,BarryMFBurton,3.77,"Chimay Blue in a Chimay chalice? Life is good. I think I’d consider Belgium my beer paradise, mostly because of breweries like this. Good tradition, great reputation, and (hopefully) awesome beer. Cheers!  A: Nearly opaque, dark reddish-brown body; looks like thick apple cider. The head, off-white and super-creamy, dissipates quickly and leaves just a bit of lacing. Nice residual film sits on top of the body like oil on water, adding yet another element to that thick, Belgian look.  S: I could smell this one from across the room! The fruit scents are damn powerful, showing up as a strange combination of dark raisins and juicy grapes; sort of strange to have the distinct scents of the same fruit dried and fresh, but they pull it off. It has a spiced alcohol aroma, too, though it’s mostly the scent of a fiery fruit wine. Sugary baked goods come rolling out, melding the fruit tastes together to give off that pleasant, warm oatmeal-raisin cookie smell. Esters are there, too, but not big, sitting atop mostly grainy scents and a mild aroma of blackberry preserves. They all just combine to form one big, delicious smell, so much so that the inner complexities can be hard to pick out sometimes.  T: Smoooth flavor at its core. I’m getting a big presence from some slightly bitter fruits; blackcurrant, raisin, and a hint of orange rind. The grains, surprisingly, are the next biggest contenders: fruity wheat and some earthy tea tastes are predominant. They’re backed up by a certain leathery mustiness in the palate, which is a bit old-tasting, but not horribly unpleasant. A prickly dryness settles over the remaining flavors, setting up a plum/white wine aftertaste. It’s a relatively thin body, much less complex than the nose would lead me to believe.  M: Crisp and bubbly, it pops all the way down like champagne. Again, though, the body is incredibly diluted for a beer with 9% alcohol. I really don’t think it’s possible to not accidentally drink this beer too fast; it really just goes down like water.  O: Glad to see that Chimay Blue was very much a fundamentally different beer from the Red. Though it wasn’t excessively flavorful, it sure was a really good drink, and one that I might just have again (maybe with some age, next time).",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

This pours a yeast fill hazy dark tea brownish color with a large tan head which foams up but then quickly dissipates down to a thin layer. The smell is of yeast esters, slightly sweet, some fruit (grapes). Feel is medium and with high carbonation. The taste is pretty sweet, lots of fruit and sugars, this is a very sweet beer, but its also very good (but I've had it many times and know what to expect).

Raisin with nuts, some sweetness a hit of chocolate in the back, very nicely balanced. The alcohol is nicely hidden.  M – Soft, creamy, sticky, bubbles and pleasant. For me this is what mouth feel is all about. In one word: superb!!!  O – A good beer, very tasty. What I don’t understand is; why didn’t I buy this beer any sooner?

215,2512,ShanePB,3.58,"750 ml corked and caged bottle, poured into a tulip glass.  A: Murky mahogany dark brown colored body with an extremely large fluffy and billowy off-white head. Tight carbonation bubbles make the formation and this keeps really no retention except with the occasional swirl to bring it back. Not much lace either however it's fairly traditional looking for the style.  S: Belgian yeast is immediate up front, followed by some spice, black pepper and lightly present dark malts. A touch of hay sweetness is towards the end, finishing with some very doughy and bready elements. It's not a powerful smelling beer and doesn't seem to have many stand out aromas.  T: Darker flavored malts and bread initially, pumpernickel and slightly earthy, almost ""dirty"" flavored hops. Towards mid-palate, big yeast flavors and dry alcohol notes come to the forefront and leave themselves well into the linger. It's not unpleasant, it's good, but as complex as this beer seems it all is quite boring in nature.  M: Highly active carbonation, bubbly and prickly. Through and through the flavors are delivered all over, finishing a touch dry into the linger. It's again evidence of some bottle conditioning and for the style, rather typical and acceptable.  Certainly my least favorite of the Chimay labels, although Belgian Strong Dark Ales are not my cup of tea. Coming out of this though, this is certainly one of the better beers in the style and I did quite enjoy this.

215,2512,Damian,4.59,"Drank from a 26.4 fl.oz. bottle 2008 vintage Best before end: 2013 Served in a Chimay goblet Thanks to Douglasjamjak for including this as an extra in our trade.  The liquid poured a cloudy, ruddy brown color and was topped by a bubbly, frothy crop of light brown foam. Excellent head retention. A thick, resilient film clung to the surface of the beer. Unfortunately, there was no lacing.  The aroma was simply amazing. Tons of phenolic, fruity, Belgian yeastiness with underlying cotton candy notes. Ripe figs instantly came to mind. Raisins and prunes were apparent as well. Spicy and moderately boozy. Strong bready notes. Some toffee. The nose had a sweet, pastry-like aspect to it. Subtle brown sugar notes appeared as well, most likely from the addition of dark Belgian candi sugar.  While noticeably different from the nose, the flavor profile was rather impressive. Sweet, bready malts came through up front. Strong dark fruit notes. Quite raisiny. Lots of Belgian yeastiness. The sweet malts were nicely balanced by a slightly acidic, tart apple quality. The finish was crisp, dry and moderately bitter with a bit of alcohol warmth on the swallow.  The beer was medium bodied for the style. Ideally, I would have preferred a bit more heft. The bottle conditioning however contributed a prickly, finely bubbled effervescence that gave this beer a light, frothy creaminess found only in the best examples of Belgian ales.  I was never won over by the fresh bottles of Chimay Grande Réserve that I sampled in the past, but this three-year-old bottle was a totally different experience. If you have the space (and the patience) I would definitely advise cellaring a case of these and sampling one periodically.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

The foam recedes only very slowly, becoming denser until it gets to half its size and looks thick enough to walk on. Spongy walls of lace.  Sweet nose. Candy sugar, raisins, plums, a light bit of bubblegum. Deep and syrupy, it smells like it would be good on pancakes.  The flavor: juiced raisins, figs, blueberry syrup — all the best notes of dark fruit. Hints of toast, brown sugar and lightly floral hops are spiced with the heat of ethanol. There are spices as well, though they would be impossible to pick out individually. Black peppercorns? Anise? I would say I have a plethora of flavors going on.  Medium, prickly carbonation in a buttery medium body, with very soft fizziness. Alcohol fumes can be picked up in the nose and throat, but complement the beer rather than distract from it.

The head accumulates into a creme color with a violet hue and is excessive, almost overbearing. Bubbles are tight and foamy near the center and expand into larger pieces near the outer edges.  S: Aroma is complex: bready malts and lemony citrus congeal into an almost chocolate cake like texture making everything sweeter, soft baked pretzels accentuate the malt profile, spicy cinnamon provides some bitter balance, refreshing watermelon and hints of dark plums and figs become apparent and a small bitter kick at the end is reminiscent of an obscure hop addition.  T/M: Texture is very thick and syrupy but not overpowering in flavor, housing a low amount of carbonation. Red grapes along with some slight alcohol sting proliferate initially and give way to some sweet bread maltiness. Not to be confused with sweetbreads, the designation for an animals pancreas when eaten and also from Silence Of The Lambs fame, but like sweetened loafs of bakery fresh bread. A touch of licorice, some noticeable plum and a hint of apricot brings up the backbone along with a surprisingly clean finish, except for a bit of alcohol sting.  It’s extremely well balanced and even though the profile is complex, it’s a bit too light for my tastes. Very tasty, nonetheless.

215,2512,woodychandler,4.52,"If I was unsure about ever having had Chimay Blanc yesterday, no such question exists today for Chimay Bleu. I remember many years ago, during the original iteration of the State College Brewers Expo and when B. United was the east coast distributor for Chimay, they actually had some on tap! The reps recruited some lovelies to help them pour and at the end of the first session, I went off to dinner. When I returned for the start of the second session, only one of the reps was there, although they had three people initially. When I inquired, I was told this rhyme - ""Chimay, Chimay not, but with Chimay, she definitely may!"" With all due respect to Billy D. Williams, he should shill for Chimay Bleu if he is going to proclaim that a beer ""Works every time!""  Another fond memory was from Dec 2001 and I was in Bruxelles, having scattered some of my late Pops' ashes in Paris, per his request. I was staying in a youth hostel and the attached downstairs bar had 11.2 oz. bottles on the cheap and I partook every night that I was there.  Finally, I will never forget the yahoo at The Sharp Edge who came in and yelled at the duty server, ""Hey, darlin', gimme some'a that Chimmy (hard ch-sound, not sh) stuff! I hear it's supposed to be real good!"" She looked at him quizzically until he started pointing at the bottles of Chimay in the coolers. The regulars, including myself just snickered and filed that gem away for just such an occasion as today.  From the bottle: ""The registered trademark 'Trappist' certifies that this ale was brewed within the walls of an existing trappist monastery under the control of the trappist community. A major part of the sales revenue is used by the monks to support charitable works. The exceptional yeast isolated by Father Theodore, combined with the purity of the highly protected water of the abbey's walls, gives Chimay its unique richness. Since 1862, Chimay's secondary fermented ales have neither been pasteurized nor filtered and only natural ingredients are used. To fully appreciate the strong character of the Chimay Blue, serve slightly chilled, in a wide-mouthed glass.""  I was going to bow and scrape before this beer, loudly proclaiming ""I'm not worthy!"" until I popped the cap and it began to foam up through the neck. This is MUCH too precious a beer to allow to go to waste and so I sprang into action, decanting it into my Westmalle glass so that I could stop the foaming. I created a dense finger of light-tan head with excellent retention. Color was a deep brown with cola highlights, but it was too dark in its color to be able to gauge clarity. I could still see the lees in the bottom of the bottle, so I would guess that I did okay. The nose on this beer is worth the price of admission! I have stated many times over that I am a self-avowed hophead and do not generally like malty beers, but this is an exception. The initial waft is of dried dark fruits, followed by a healthy smack of alcohol heat and then chocolate and nuts. I could sit with my nose buried in the glass for a while, but a) you get the idea, b) there are plenty of other, better reviews and c) I am anxious for a sip. Mouthfeel was full and creamy with an initial sugary/malty sweetness and some big heat, followed by caramel and toffee, then dried dark fruit and finally a touch of yeasty must. Finish brought the heat then settled back for a slightly dry aftertaste. Right after that, the mellow began to set in and I felt sleepy, very sleepy.

The 750ml 2011 arrived from Belgium just this week. I've been waiting for this for a while, you might say...a vertical tasting of 5 years of Chimay history  The 2011 and 2009 poured a rich dark brown with ruby notes, a moderate off-white head and plenty of lacing. The 2006 poured darker, the ruby notes subdued to non-existent. They all look lovely, though not really exceptional.  Smell-wise, these were all really quite amazing. Plenty of dark fruitiness, particularly in the newer ones. The older 2006 (I wouldn't have expected this) was actually much brighter and even trending towards green apple. Very Belgian, with yeast and malt and lots of cooked fruit. I could have spent the evening just smelling these guys.  And they taste great. Not a tonne of difference between the 2011 and the 2009, though it actually seemed like the '09 tasted fresher and lighter. Dark malty cooked fruits, like dates without the cloying sweetness...some licorice, even some medium-dark chocolate in the middle and then again near the end, more pronounced in the 2006 than in the others. No...I don't *want* to cleanse my palate, thanks very much. I just want this taste to stay there and linger. Chocolate? Really? Like a fruity chocolate stout? Weird, but wonderful. Seriously...oddly fantastic.  ...and I can't imagine a nicer mouthfeel. The 2006 was no less pleasing than the others, with just a perfect level of carbonation that kept the beer light despite its complexity. The older the bottle, the brighter it seemed, actually. The 2006 at points felt fresh as a hefeweizen, but without the banana or coriander. They all filled the mouth with a velvety and lush texture that was over way way too soon.  Overall, this was an exceptional and singular experience. This is a really really good beer. If you can bring yourself to do so, put one on the shelf and leave it there for a few years.

Has a boozy tinge to it as well, no noticeable hops. Medium bodied with nice carbonation. Has a spicy and smoky aftertaste that's slightly dry.  This is a strong, but very good beer. Very well rounded and the moment you taste it, you’re hit with an awesome combination of tastes. Pricey, but definitely worth it if you come across a bottle.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,KAP1356,4.42,"Poured from a 750 ml bottle purchased at Giant Eagle in Canonsburg into a cervoise. 2011 bottle...  A - Pours a murky, dark brown color with a nice and fluffy off-white head that forms about 2 fingers thick. Lots of lacing as the head recedes.  S - Pretty nice smell for a BSDA. Lots of dark, sticky fruits - figs, dates, raisins and some apricots I think. Nice amount of Belgian spice and some yeasty notes as well.  T - Nice dark malts mixed with the sticky fruits mentioned in the nose with more raisin and date than the others. Spices come out a bit more here with allspice and some clove. Light peppery flavors as well.  M - Medium bodied beer with a higher carbonation level. It adds nicely to the beer and gives it a nice bright feel on the mouth for suah a heavy beer.  O - As always, a standard go to. Really nice flavors and aromas that make this one such a drinkable beer. Might try cellaring a few of these.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

215,2512,Knapp85,4,"Very enjoyable Belgian brew. I remember some drunk dude at one of my local shops telling me about how great this beer was and I just looked at him and said ""Yeah I know..."" I guess he figured that a 22 year old wouldn't have tried that beer yet. Needless to say, I had and it was very good. The beer poured out as bubbly brown color with some red highlights. The smell of the beer is a bit on the earthy side with some sweet dark fruits on the nose and of course a hefty amount of yeast. The taste is a little metallic at first but that fades as it warms up. The dark fruits are subtle here but there is a slight sweetness from them, it's a little boozy, and has some spice in the back end too. The mouthfeel of the beer is a little thin but had enough carbonation to keep this one interesting. Overall this is enjoyable, I like to order it on occasion but not often.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Smell is very sophisticated with a ton of different nuances, some I could place and some I couldnt. Malts, raisins, yeast, earthy notes, a bit of spice...  I smells go well into the tastes. I did not see the bottle date on this but it tasted like it had some age on it. Smooth malt character, raisins, a tiny hint of sour cherry that I attribute to most Belgian ales. No one flavor jumps out.  The mouthfeel on this is incredible. Its velvety, medium bodied, with a light amount of carbonation.  This was truly a treat with quite a bit of sediment in the bottom of the last pour.

Lacing is minimal and carbonation is a medium level.  S: The aroma is medium intensity and shows notes of plum and currants. Nice malty character, which is very multidementional. Faint hint of alcohol.  T/M: Clean body, with a silky smoothness. Body is not overly thick, but has a nice layered texture. The taste is that of dark fruits and rasins. Lingering finish is not too impressive, taste is gone fairly quickly.  O: Overall this is a solid beer, with a good following.

A little but foamy despite a relatively slow pour with the head subsiding down to a thin effervescent slick with a thickness around the outside of the glass.  Smells a bit boozy with some grape coming through. possibly a touch of plum as well.  Tastes of fig and dried fruits - a little like prune. heavy on the malt but no real hop character detected. I imagined a bit of a deeper flavor based on reputation.  Mouthfeel has a sharp effervescence to it that mellows out and fils the throat on the way down. No real after-taste either - just a subtle bit on the tongue. One of the better aspects to this beer.  Overall I'm honestly a little disappointed. I've heard of this as an A+ type of beer - world class and loved by many - but found it to just be ""good."" I wonder if a larger corked bottle is a different experience. I also imagine this beer might be a little different after it warms up a bit after the chill wears off.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,shambeano,4.47,"okay, so chimay blue review, one of those beers who's reputation preceeds it, and by that i mean insanely preceeds it. the avourite beer of so many people i know, however, i cant remember if i have tried it or not. so for all intents and purposes, this is a first for me. this one is a 2010 vintage, poured at room temperature into a tulip.  A- pours a dark brownish with about 2.5 inches of very fluffy white head. the head slowly subsides with a lot of lacing.l ooks good.  S- straight up a tidy mix of malts, alcohol and spice. malts slightly on the sweeter side, but quickly brought back by the apricot/raisin/dried fig character, followed by a spicier side, a touch of clove and cinnamon, but whats most impressive is the way they move from one to another.  T- straight up a touch of sweetness, but a whole bunch of spice follows. allspice and clove, followed in the end by that alcoholy dark fruits. very similar to the smell but in a different order. again flows very well.  M- upfront very full bodied, but near the end the carbonation comes on in a rush, a fair bit but very quick. very good length, and midway through becomes slightly drying, but still tasting the beer ages after. great.  O- considered one of the wrolds best beers, and for good reason. the alcohol only adds to the overall flavour, and although there are beers with more complex flavours, the beauty of this is that all the flavours flow and work togeher very very well.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,Rijtjeshuis,4.22,"served in a branded chalice.  LOOK (3.5/5) Pours a deep brown to lighter mahogany - maybe around 30*SRM. This one is quite opaque. Very cloudy indeed. Head is a bit disappointing; it rises to about a finger and a half (rocky, creamy, off-white). This falls quickly , with too little lacing, to a ring around the glass. Some nice carbonation on the inside of the glass.  SMELL (4/5) The smell is malty, as you'd expect, but with a lot of yeast esters and some more tart grape aromas. The malt has some mailard in it, but the dark fruit is gentler than most. This faces to a dark grape-juice flavor. The yeast is also fairly fruity - it also had some banana and bubblegum. Not very much hop or alcohol aroma.  TASTE (4.5/5) The flavor is similar to the nose. There's some more grape and pepper in there, though. The flavor has a lot of melanoidin in there as well (prunes, plums). But this faded to a tarter grape-juice, somewhat vinous, flavor. It rounded out with some spiciness (pepper) that wasn't really on the nose. The finish is a bit on the sweeter side. Some alcoholic warmth.  FEEL (4.5/5) This is medium-full bodied and some higher carbonation. This is what I call 'fluffy' - high carb goes well with the spice.  DRINK (4/5) Drinkability is medium - too heavy and flavorful for a session, but well balanced and complex. A great drink all-in-all.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,Scotchboy,3.65,"Review No. 150  11.2 ounce bottle, a gift from my wife after a long days work and the one Chimay I had yet to try. Bottle marked: L09-221 and poured into a New Belgium globe.  A: Murk, muddy brown with hints of deep purple, I poured the yeast in on purpose and you can see it working throughout the beer and even the head. My pour was aggressive and yielded a ton of yellow head but I was surprised by how quickly it dissipated and how little carbonation was in this beer...older bottle?  S: Dark malt, yeast esters, plum, chalky cocoa powder, spices, some distant fruit sweetness, possibly bruised apricot and old grapes.  T: In line with the smell; spices and nuttiness abounds and the dark fruit characters and rich sweetness abound; grape skins, faint cocoa nibs, and the slightest hint of booze.  MF: Again, that chalky/yeast character seems dominant. Low carbonation, medium mouthfeel with some slick chewiness.  O: I thought I would like this beer a lot more. As a positive, it is easily drinkable, but I was surprised by how average this beer seemed to me; each element seemed subdued. I am not a Belgian expert (I do like Boulevards BBQ and Grand Tetons Coming Home) so I will revisit someday and hope that my palette has matured.

Smells faintly of spicey malt.. maybe some clove notes with herbs. Taste is better, its smooth and tingly and surprisingly smooth for a 9% beer. I've had 5% beers that were more harsh than this. Very good and a pleasure to drink. Aftertaste is most pleasant and the buzz is perfect. Different beers produce a different buzz. This is a quality feeling from a quality beer.  I had the white, red and blue chimays and I enjoyed all of them, however I still don't quite have a taste for belgian beers. This was probably the best one yet.

Outside at the patio and opening it for the friends and neighbors. Took off the cage and barely touched the cork, POP! and the cork flew a good 30 feet (9.5 meters) into the back yard. Inside of the house I always ""cup"" the cork in my hand.  Ok on to appearance poured into tulip glasses producing a reddish amber color that looked ""rich"", head was a 2"" tan foam that stuck around and laced well.  Smell was of dark fruits , mostly grapes and raisons that appeared sweetish but not off putting.  The first thing I tasted was the malts and some breadiness from the yeasts, then the fruits of raisons, apple? and spices, YUM! Very complex beer here.  The mouthfeel was medium to medium full, without being heavy. The carbonation and hops cleanse the palate and gives a crisp feel to this.  Overall - WOW and WoW again.

Finished crisp and slightly sweet.  Overall: It has been years since I last had the Chimay Blue. Why did I wait so long? This beer has plenty of character, and is very drinkable.

A small amount of visible carbonation.  S- Belgian yeast, dark fruits, an interplay of sweet and sour - as seems to be the norm with Belgian strong dark ales. Scent is more subtle than many of this style... Hard to tell what to expect.  T- A fair amount of carbonation is very noticeable up front, followed by a surprisingly mild array of ripe fruits (grapes, granny smith apples). Carries into a slightly yeasty taste. No alcohol taste or burn. In fact, it is among the sneakiest I have yet to try.  M- Medium body, but a rather large amount of carbonation makes this lighter and crisper than many of this style. Finishes dry.  O- I'm going to admit, my expectations were maybe too high for this beer. However, it ultimately is tasty and quite easy to drink. It's the most mild of this style I've yet to try.

He is a regular here, living right down the road, and has introduced me to several people here already. Everyone seems to know him… sort of his personal Cheers!  The label is, well… blue!

215,2512,WastingFreetime,4.42,"AGED REVIEW 2008 VINTAGE A. Very deep brown with reddish highlights around the edges. Nice very light tan head one finger which doesn't stick around for much. S. Deep dark fruits including figs, raisins, plums, some oddball apple esters peppered on top. Occasionally hints of freshly cut juicy ripe heirloom tomatoes, but mostly when its warmed up to room temperature. T. Predominantly raisin bread with dark fruit jam on top of it. Dried apricots come briefly to visit and say hello, than leave just as abruptly. Strange wisps of mulling spice float around on your tongue, keeping company with an oddball earthy / mushroomy umami high-protein finish. After some time aging in the cellar I find that the sugary cloying nature of the fresh product has dampened out into a better balance with the thick yeast flavor. 3 years old is my personal preference for drying out the sugars maybe about halfway only. Also, the boozey hotness retreats even further into the background. M. Feels like an entire meal in liquid form. Heavy flavors on an medium-heavy body. But it doesn't get oily. It does, however, make a lasting coating on the surfaces of your mouth. If you don't like how it tastes, you will be stuck with it for a while. The flavors of this one stay with you and even influence the character of any food you might have for quite some time afterward. For better or for worse, everything tasted for 10 minutes or so gets a condiment dressing of the flavor of Chimay Grande Reserve, so plan accordingly.  This is a special treat to get once in a while when you have extra money to burn, but a little bit too expensive to justify having as a 'usual suspect' in the fridge. If possible, I recommend cellaring for a couple years to dry out the excessive sweetness, that is when it really hits its prime.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

It tastes sweet at first, filling your mouth with strong fruit characteristics, and amber/caramel malt. It tappers off into a smooth tomato finish.

215,2512,OliverTweek,4.45,"I've had Chimay many times before I decided to review it. It really was one of the first ""higher class"" beers I had. It wasn't until I had more that I realized how great of a beer I truly had.  Look: A nice, very bright caramel color, with a nice creamy, almost walnut colored head. While very carbonated, it is an easy pour that looks crisp and smooth.  Smell: I saw someone else on this site reference ""figs"" and I think that hits it dead on. A very sweet but not overpowering odor. Along with the figs, there are nutty, creamy, and slight coffee hints.  Taste: A very complex flavor, and a rich, earthy, sweet taste. The after taste is much more fruity than the initial one, very cirtrusy but both are great. You can certainly taste the alcohol, but unlike other beers with a similar abv, it doesn't overpower the beer, but compliments it.  Mouthfeel: The carbonation is just right, not too bubbly, but not too flat. A little heavier than I would have liked, but with so much going on, it's not a detraction.  Overall: One of the best beers I've had, and certainly one of my favorites. There really is very little I can say bad about it, every thing seems to be in perfect balance.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,MoreThanWine,4.3,"It's interesting how so many reviewers, both on this site and in reference material, taste different things in this beer. Here's what I got. Poured a massive ecru colored head which settled to lacing and traces. Color is a deep russet, almost cider-like. Smell has malt, raisins, figs, or basically dark dried fruits. Taste has more of the same and it's quite rich. There's an acidic zing which persists in one of the longest lasting finishes I've ever had in a beer. Clearly this deserves the world class status it holds. Of course I'd prefer if it were cheaper. And what I don't get from it, which I've seen other reviewers claim, is plum, pear, honey, or bubblegum. Say what?",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

A&S: Pours an opaque reddish brown with about two fingers of head that bubbles and disappates quickly leaving small patches of bubbles along the edges of the glass. Smells of fruit and malts.  T&M: There is a lot going on with the taste: tons of fruitiness, a little hops, malts, a very delicious blend of flavors that mask the alcohol content well. Mouthfeel is very bubbly, carbonated, and light.  O: Very delicious. Very pricey, but very delicious.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Smells sweet, fruity and spicy. Very exotic for this English bitter drinker.  The taste is very complex, all the aforementioned smells blending in with a slight hoppiness, and the lightness of the texture makes it very drinkable. It's how I would imagine a fruitcake in beer form would taste!  Overall a very, very good beer. Beers like this really uphold the Trappist reputation for amazing complex brews.

The head is about one finger of foam and quickly dissipates. I could see quite a bit of sediment that exited from the bottle into the glass.  The nose is sweet and sugary and malted goodness. Reminds me a bit of fresh pastries coming out of the oven. Perhaps some hints of fruit in the nose as well, such as pear, prunes, raisons.  Taste is a delicious boozy sweetness. Brown sugar, molasses, and some caramel. Leaves a nice lingering sweetness on the tongue. Mix in some candied fruits like apricots and dates. Crisp, dry, sugary finish is delightful. Hands down the best of this style I have had.  Mouthfeel, again, is crisp and dry. Carbonation is active and contributes to the crispness at the end. The boozy sweetness creates a nice coating in the mouth and on the lips.

I was driving around with this in my car earlier, so it may have been a bit shaken up, because this one was a bit of a gusher.  A- Rich mahogany in color, with an off-white/faint khaki head that plumes to two fingers above the body of the beer. The head subsides leaving a thin covering over top of the beer that is dancing with carbonation. Very pretty.  S- This throws out a burst of malt and raw grain up front that is interlaced with brown sugar, raisins, and prunes. There is only the slightest presence of alcohol in the background. The aroma is nice, but could be a bit more pronounced.  T- Similar to the smell, but with a much more noticeable yeast presence, and a faint bitterness on the finish. The yeast embodies everything that comes to mind when thinking ""belgian"" or ""trappist"", however, I wouldn't have guessed it to taste this good based on the smell.  M- Lively carbonation that's a little overbearing until the beer settles for a bit. A little more than medium bodied.  O- Overall, a very respectable, very drinkable beer. I have one that I'm going to put in the cellar until I can't stand to keep it down there anymore, and I'll see what it turns into.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Bottle dated 5/10 therefore, it is a year old.  Appearance: Dark reddish brown, nice head that builds initially to about an 1” to 2” but quickly recedes to a nice frothy ¼”, good lacing.  Smell: Nicely complex, some sweet dark fruit, the expected Belgian yeast, and mild phenols.  Taste: Delicious beer, complex, balanced with the dark fruit up-front, mild hoppy bitterness on the finish. A great example of the Trappist SDA/Quad, in fact perhaps the perfect gateway to the style.  Mouth feel: Aggressively carbonated but remains fairly smooth.  Overall: Very drinkable, delicious Belgian SDA.  Like for many this was my gateway to the wonderful world of both the Trappist beers and Belgian strong dark ales / quads in general. It’s a very good beer; however, for the money there are so many better beers. In fact it is at the bottom of the Trappist SDA’s, which is not an insult as it is the least of a series of great beers.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Had this once in my beer cellar for several months (less than 12 but more than 4) before cracking this one open. Head starts well & then goes away pretty click. Smells of prunes, dates, very dark fruit. Decent carbonation.  Taste is in line w/ the smell. Dark fruit, very complex! Sweet, malty, tart finish. No hop presence really. Alcohol is extremely well hidden. Lovely, just lovely. I kinda expected an aggressive beer but this is very sublime. I keep thinking of dates when I sip on this. There are just so many things going on here that it's very hard to describe.  Mouthfeel is thick. Not chewy, but thick - full bodied for sure. And as for drinkability, it's a high for me.

Very little light passes through when held to light.  S: Raisins, booze, caramel, dark brown sugar, and a very faint floral note. The booze notes are somewhat subdued, but are still detectable.  T: Very close to the nose. Rum soaked raisins is the first thing that comes to my palate, followed by a very faint bready, doughy malt. Some caramel, dark brown sugar, and then booze decides to sneak out of the background and make itself known. Jeez, there's some alcohol heat here.  M: Low carbonation, medium body, a little creamy.

Great retention and size seems to be a Trappist tradition. Big pillow leaves spotty Belgian lace.  S- Dark brown sugar malt, raisins, dark cherry fruit and a nice Belgian yeast profile to round it all out, some spice and bread.  T- Good balance of Belgian yeast (bread, spice, coriander, clove), brown sugar malts and dark fruit. Nutty, floral, apple, grape, apricot and sweet hints in there as well.  MF- Insanely foamy and carbonated, like champagne level. The cork pretty much shot out like a gun so I was expecting it. Some bitterness.  The only complaint is the huge carbonation, it really ends up drinking like foam instead of liquid but that is minor problem because the flavors are nice.

A - Pours a dark murky ruby red colour, finger of beige head with decent retention and nice sheeting lacing.  S - The dark fruit, plums and raisins come off the top, some bubble gum and cloves come through on the finish. Although I was expecting the ABV to dominate, a nice sweetness is present.  T - Much like the scent, though the buggle gum, bananas and cloves tend to dominate. Some sour apple and raisins come through on the finish alongside a bit of pepper and spice. The high ABV goes incredibly well hidden.  M - A bit overly carbonated or my liking, resulting in a bit of a prickly feel going down, though it does finish nicely with a touch of dryness.

Nice white head, which (mostly) lasts 'till the last sip and a dark, cloudy brown color, if put towards the light, a little reddish. Smell is nice, but not very strong... some sweetness, a little bit of yeast and dry fruit, maybe... Taste? Awesome. I think this beer masks the alcohol really well, as I can't taste it much, a little bit of bitternes at the end, very smooth. Quite a lot of carbonations at the start, warming feel at the end.

The sweetness and slight heat evokes rum, oddly enough, and it goes down smoothly without being watery. Character is what I'd call average.

Taste- The taste offers a lot of grain and malt, with a nice kick of fruitiness that really hits the taste-buds, defiantly a nice sipper. Slightly bitter, not hoppy at all, very smooth. Very complete in taste, the alcohol is disguised well, behind the fruity after taste.  Mouth-feel- Offers a carbonated feeling to an extent, but it flows well and tastes even better.  Overall- Its hard to stop at one glass, the 75cl bottle offers more than that, so I couldn't see anyone stopping at one. Behind the smooth taste, and slightly carbonated flow, its easy to throw back a few of these and forget about the 9.0 alc which is greatly disguised with the smooth and rich taste.

Looks inviting.  Smell: Smells of yeast, malt; and grains. It smells somewhat of tree fruits to my nose, nectarine or apricot.  Taste: Tastes initially of malt and grains, with some flavors of brown sugar, nectarines, plum, and a little orange peel. Hops are downplayed in this beer, but add a nice grassy taste at the front of the mouth and mild bitterness. The tastes grow more complex as the beer warms, adding a sort of berry flavor, rasberries or currants maybe, as well as deeper complexity of the malt and hops.  Mouthfeel: Although carbonation is apparent, this beer is very smooth and quite drinkable.  Overall: A fine beer.

215,2512,ColdPoncho,4.89,"11.2 oz bottle. ""L10-602"" whatever that means  I have long thought of this as my favorite beer. 'bout time I got to reviewing it.  A - The pour yields a murky dark brown body with reddish tinges around the edges and a great big bushy beard. I mean off-white head.  S - Dark fruits, cherries, plums, figs. Bit of yeast and spice. Dark roasted and chocolatey malts. This nose is exquisite. This is exactly how a BSDA should smell, IMO.  T - Damn I love this beer. Nutty and dark fruit flavors are at the front of the taste here. The forward sweetness has great counterparts in the more earthy malt flavors and the light Belgian tart spice. Very good tasting beer.  M - Smooth, big body, very full presence in the mouth. Carbonation is in check.  O (D) - I really love this beer. It's excellent in so many ways. A desert island beer for sure.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

I didn't get much in the smell. A bit malty, but nothing else stood out.  The taste is all Belgian. Sweet dark fruits dominate the taste buds, with a little alcohol in the finish.  The mouthfeel follows the taste. Early on, it's sweet. There's some spiciness in the middle, as well as some cleansing carbonation. The swallow is all heat from the alcohol.  Despite the high ABV and the obvious heat from it, it's pretty tame for 9%. In addition, you've got the bite from the carbonation. It's an intense beer, but never is overpowering in any way and because of that, actually goes down pretty well.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Some hints of port in there as well. A bit of earthiness to it too. The flavors improve at it warms a bit, getting more complex, with the flavors melding better.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied with crisp carbonation, relatively smooth, getting smoother as it warms, likely due to losing a little carbonation.  Overall: This is one of my personal top 5 beers.

This is followed by an explosive cork pop that wields a nice waft of carbon fog. A fruit filled scent precedes the pour.  A wine snob would call it complex with a long on the palate finish. A little too strong on the alcohol, but it had a good caramel flavor. A very nice, long laster with a mouthful of taste. It will definitely age well in the cellar.

S - Smells of bread, dark fruit, and a rum liquer. Almost reminds me of a rum cake around the holidays.  T - Tastes sweet with flavors of plum, raisins, and dark cherries. Goes into a booziness of a spiced rum, and then finishes crisp with the tawny bite of a port wine. Just an excellent blend of complex flavors.  M - Probably its best quality, this ale is insanely smooth and a wonderful texture that can go with a nice meal, as a cocktail drink, or an after dinner appertif.  O - Yeah, this is really good.

Grande Réserve is a dark caramel colour and lets very little light through the goblet its in.  The smell is remarkable, with notes of spice, bread and hops all intertwined in a complex dance that excites the senses. The taste takes it one step further, with a very earthy, heavy malt that completely lacks sweetness. The bitterness is almost overwhelming but stops just short of that, creating a unique blend of flavours that seems close to perfect. Bread, earth, spice and hops all play a part.  As the dense head would suggest, this beer is very creamy, very heavy, and, to my delight, very dry. Its so heavy I think I'll only need one of these for now, but I will definitely drink another when I see it. Grande Réserve is a wonderful beer.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

This is among the best ales (if not THE best) and definitely one of the best beers I've ever enjoyed.

S - Although not real powerful, the smell is spectacular. Dark fruits are most notable for me. Plums, figs, and tart cherries. Then a doughy cinnamon shows up. That Belgian yeast is surely there, but again, a bit subtle. There's also a hint of clove and just enough alcohol that you have to hunt for it.  T - Follows the aroma quite a bit. Nothing overpowering. Everything just works together...sum of the parts thing. The dark fruits are there at the beginning and never really disappear. The balance between the spiciness and sweetness is perfect. I did notice a woody apple note that never appeared in the nose. Taste is impressive.

The smell suggest a very delicate and balanced citrus to the caramelly darkness. I wouldn't call it dark judging by the smell. Minor burnt characteristics  Amazingly delicate for such a variety of flavor. It is perfectly dry, crisp, and even, all the way to the finish.

It tasted slightly bitter-sweet in the beginning with a hint of raisons and finished moderately sweet and malty and had a slight alcohol tinge at the end with the flavor only lasting a short time.

D-There is a bitter aftertaste that tends to linger and they did not do the greatest job hiding the alcohol content. I would say the drinkability here is below average.

This has tons of roasty syrupy malts which add a heavier body and take away from the drinkability. That being said this is still an amazing brew.

Beer is dark cloudy brown, with lighter browns and oranges at the edge of the glass. Tons of carbonation streaming up from the bottom of the glass.  Nose is rum soaked dark fruits like raisins, figs and plums, sweet caramel, grainy bread, cloves.  Tastes similar to the nose, boozy dark fruits and grainy breads with a bit floral hops. Nice balance of the sweetness, alcohol, and drying bitterness from the hops used, especially on the somewhat dry finish.  A bit thin on the tongue, with the ample carbonation pretty aggressive. Definitely not as sweet as some other Belgian strong dark ales or quads that I've tried, which helps make it more drinkable, as the alcohol is just a light warmth in your throat.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Behind the fruit is some yeast and alcohol, but these are nothing compared to the fruit  T: Pretty much the same as the smell. Big showcase in the dark fruit department all the way through. Making appearances are again the belgian yeast and some nice warming alcohol  M: Medium-heavy body with plenty of carbonation.

There's a little bit of soapiness and caramel malt.  T: There are some mild fruits up front such as apple and pear. In the middle I get toasted malt and some yeastiness. There's light floral hops and nuts/woodiness at the finish.  M: I thought this beer had near perfect mouthfeel for the style. The carbonation was appropriately high, without distracting from the overall experience. The beer was crisp and had a good aftertaste.  D: This beer has fairly high drinkability.

Tastes of prunes and raisins and cherries with little hops and plenty of malt sweetness.  Medium to thick mouthfeel bordering on luscious. Very nice.  Drinkable even at 9%.  A relatively boring Belgian Strong Dark Ale. I'd been holding off on trying this for some time as I'd held it as the gold standard, but this beer disappoints on almost every level.

Given it's reputation, I decided to start with the Chimay Bleue in a 33cl bottle. I was not disappointed. It poured a dark and cloudy chocolate/caramel color into the glass and left a creamy head which did not disappear right away, but left an enjoyable froth and lacing on the sides of my glass. It had a much fruitier fragrance than I expected given it's strength and color with yeast in for good measure. I actually found my mouth water when i wafted it in. Again, it's flavor surprised me. I have tried my fair share of beer at and over 9% abv and I usually find them overpowering but not this one. It had good dried fruit and bread/grains to the palate with a pleasant malt without the over powering sensation of a high alcohol content. It finished a mild bitter and left me swirling, smelling and sipping until it was done. Given that I am new to the Trappist beers I may have to come back to this review at some point in the future.

The spice is certainly more balanced to the sweetness on the palate than it was in the nose.

It yields a rather small head with delicate lacing.  Aroma: The aforementioned small head gives off an aroma of coffee and caramel.  Taste: The caramel scent carries over along with some sweet chocolate notes and some spiciness. Unfortunately for any hopheads, this beer is not that bitter. I noticed the day after that the beer gave me a spicy, almost oniony aftertaste.  Feel: The feel is very smooth, and the high amount of alcohol creates a very refreshing finish.

A pleasant, fairly large, nearly white head arises and subsides with haste. Carbonation races to the top long after the beer has been poured.  This one smells like dark sweet fruits, Belgian sugars and yeasts. Apple, grapes and raisons come to mind. A spicy profile lingers in the background.  Taste is reminiscent of the nose as far as the dark fruits are concerned; however the taste is less sweet than the nose would lead you to believe.

Fairly thin and dilute and pretty carbonated. The taste is pretty one dimensional. Gives a sharpness which is not entirely developed.

215,2512,Fatheranderson,4.53,"This is a good solid entry into the Belgian Strong Ale style. It's spicy and smooth and slightly sweet but overall just amazingly complex and well done.  Appearance: Dark, rich, succulent. It looks like a mahogany wood finish when poured into a glass.  Smell: Complicated... layered... apple maybe? No not really. Stewed prunes mixed with a hint of apple and pear is the best I can describe it and even that doesn't really strike to the heart of the smell. It really just smells smooth.  Taste: Smooth, complex, deep, rich. There's just a tiny hint of alcohol, but overall it tastes almost exactly like it smells... and it's very hard to explain. There's definitely some plum in there now that I taste it again. Maybe plum, pear, and a hint of hickory wood would be a better description of what it tastes like. Add a hint of cocoa and just a little caramelized sugar and you've got a decent approximation of what it's like. There's a whole lot going on with this beer's taste at the same time, and it's really something you have to experience to completely understand. Also, the taste apparently evolves as the beer warms up, unlocking more levels of flavor like gentle hints of vanilla, maybe a little Irish creme?  Mouthfeel: just enough bite from the carbonation to keep it from feeling flat without being overbearing.  Drinkability: it's a very complicated beer which, like any good brandy requires multiple tastings to truly experience all of it.  Overall: this beer is a rich, complex, delightful ale that evolves as it warms. It isn't boozy, but it isn't completely beer either. It's a very unique, well balance ale that requires an experienced beer connoisseur to completely appreciate.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,BeanBone,4.08,"Appearance: A murky dark brown-orange body capped by two fingers of creamy off-white head that burn out quickly and leave little lacing. This is a noisy beer, from the loud pop as it opened to the fizzing head burning itself out.  Aroma: Lots of dark fruit and clove-like spice over brown sugary malt. It's understated, but elegant.  Flavor: On the palate, it's a mix of rum-soaked dark fruit, peppery spice, Belgian yeast over a nutty and brown sugary malt backbone. The alcohol is masked well, contributing just a hint of spice as it warms. Dark fruit and nuttiness in the finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with spritzy carbonation and a sweetish finish. Not much sign of the alcohol in the mouth.  Drinkability: Easily quaffable, especially considering the high alcohol content. You could easily drink a 750ml bottle by yourself during and after a nice dinner.  Verdict: Chimay Grande Réserve is a beer that comes with a lot of expectations, and I'm happy to report it lives up to the hype nicely.

S: Really great aroma. Smells deeply sweet with hints dark fruits. The yeast gives it a great bready aroma as well. Smells exactly like a good belgian should.  T: Tastes much like it smells: hits first with the malts and a sweet, grape-like flavor which gives way to the yeast, and finishes nice and (surprisingly) dry. This beer hides the 9% ABV very well, and is only evidenced by the slight warming sensation in the back of the throat. Well balanced, really tasty beer.  M: Medium bodied, relatively light on the carbonation. The carbonation that it does have are small bubbles, which are pleasantly tingly.  D: It has been a few years since I had this beer, in the time before I really started getting into Belgians, and it is much, much better than I remember.

And after 10 minutes there's no lacing left either. 2.5  S: Nose is not potent at all. This follows a Bernardus Abt with a best By of 06/08/14 and the flavour in the St Bernardus was just so much more potent to the extent that the beers are not comparable in any way. There's a bit of yeast and some winey notes and alcohol but apart from that the nose is simply incredibly weak. I think partly it's that the head dies down too quick to get any lasting flavour notes. 2.5  T: Some sort of Belgian chemically solventy flavours mainly. Not unpleasant but not really impressive or enjoyable in any way. At least there is some flavour here, unlike in the nose. Also some yeast. 3  M: Relatively thick and creamy actually. 4  D: Honestly not an enjoyable or well flavoured beer. Can certainly drink it but it lacks flavour.

I also enjoyed both the Chimay Red and White which came in the same tasting pack. I just don't know what's wrong with the Chimay Blue now, it's supposed to be their flagship beer but I can quite honestly say it's just a bad beer at present. Carbonation dies down too quickly (I'm staring at the glass within 10 minutes of opening the bottle and there is 0 head left, a far cry from the Bernardus Abt where the head lasted for 50 minutes or so), flavour is muted.

Got it home, popped the top, poured into my New Belgium globe...  Apperance - PERFECT, dark, rich and cloudy amber color, for an ALE this is perfect. The head was about one inch tall and went away quickly.  Smell - This reminded me of a cheap, woody cognac to start with. I actually sat this down and came back to it after a few minutes, afterwords I could still smell the woodiness but the fruit and florals started to become more prominent.  Taste - All I can say is watered down whiskey. Just NOT IMPRESSED.  Mouthfeel - TOO thin, no feel at all. It has the feel of water.  Drinkability - I would get something else.

A vigorous pour gives me a very generous head filling the chalice and then settling down to a nice layer of bubbles.  The nose instantly fills me with some tart cherries, much more tart than I remember from the last time I had this beer. It's a much welcome smell as it's one of my favorites in Belgian beers. Behind that some sweet malts and some yeast spice.  That tart cherry flavor doesn't transfer over to the taste very much, it is replaced with mostly some sweetness and dark fruits. On the backend I can taste some alcohol and with the sweetness and Belgian spice I'm drawing comparisons to a mildly spiced rum.  Mouthfeel is medium with a semi-dry finish and high carbonation.

Plum, raisin, roasted malt, spices, and signature Belgian yeast dominate. Just enough tart in the background to keep it from being overly sweet. I get a note of chocolate as well.

No real head to speak of, just a thin white ring around the glass.  The smell is amazing and unexpected; sweet and fruity -- apples, peaches, and oranges. Beneath that are the aromas I've come to expect from the style: malt, spice, and Belgian yeast.  The taste follows the smell: sweet and fruity, with apples, peaches, malt, and spice. Finishes pretty balanced with bready, Belgian yeast and a vinous, white wine sweetness.  The beer is fairly carbonated and medium-bodied, crisp and refreshing.  Very drinkable.

The smell is fantasic, lots of breadiness, plums, toasted caramel and toffee. It almost smells like a fruitcake, or some kind of fruity pastry.  Very bready, malty taste of exceptional smoothness. At the same time, there is candied sugar sweetness, a balancing hop presence makes itself known, along with a tartness reminiscent of a black cherry. The result is a nearly perfect equilibrium.  medium-full bodied, moderate carbonation, and unabashed smoothness. It's just so velvety, there is nothing harsh about it.

There is a smell hint of vanilla, and the alcohol is present as well. The malt smell is so delicious, the scent is making my mouth water just smelling it. The color of the beer is a little darker than I expected for a Belgium, however it is a strong dark ale, so it should have been expected. The beer is a little cloudy, but again, should be expected as it is bottle conditioned and non-filtered. The head retention is amazing, 3-4 minutes after pour I still have at least three centimeters. Tasting the beer I was a bit surprised. It was a lot crisper, cleaner, than I expected. It is very well balanced, to say the least, starts with a sweet/fruity twang than the malts mellow out to the end. I didn't really taste the alcohol until the finish, but it is present. The beer also has a warming effect on the finish, with a medium body. The carbonation in the mouth was around par, not overly abundant but still very noticeable. The creaminess of the beer, mixed with the carbonation, mixed with the body and warmth of the alcohol was really a nice combination.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

A thick and creamy looking 1/4 inch head forms which recedes to some tiny clumps that seem to linger around on the top of the beer. Smells of Iraqi figs picked fresh off the tree, along with distinct characteristics of dark sun-maid rasins and a strong presence of alcohol. The taste is of sweet, bold malts with definite caramel notes that are followed by a strong alcohol presence. As this brew warms up in the glass, more fruity, alcohol soaked flavors such as the distinct figs and raisins that were noticeable in the aroma become available to the tastebuds. The mouthfeel fits into the med/heavy range and is paired with a high level of carbonation that somehow blends nicely with the beer's characteristics.

215,2512,TheBrewo,4.47,"We pour from our 750 mL bottle into our snifters. The beer is the deepest orange-brown in color, with maroon streaks throughout. The tan head is soft and foamy, standing two fingers high. It retains well, leaving thick lacing as it slowly recedes. The carbonation looks to be active, and no sediment is noted. The aroma is a bouquet of sweet malts, faint esters, tangerines and apricots, clovey phenols, spicy alcohol, and floral-nectary notes. As we sip the palate is rushed with malts, bitter spice, and medicinal phenols. Through the middle esters begin to mix in, along with other fruitiness, of light pit fruits. The finish washes down with a mouthful of spicy, peppery booze, and calming, cooling sweet malts, with faint citrus. The aftertaste breathes with bitter chalkiness, from the yeast, light sugary sweetness, and a large wallop of alcohol. This helps to create a serious warming effect. The body is medium and the carbonation is light to medium. The beer sips with a syrupy feel and, while creamy, it leaves the mouth quite dry. The abv is middle of the road, and despite its assertiveness, the beer drinks smoothly.  Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the bright, full aroma. While the nose was complex it maintained cleanliness throughout, making it very smooth and pleasant to whiff. The subsequent taste profile did not disappoint, as it hit all the major stops throughout the sip. Finally, the nice warming end, where you feel it all down your chest and into your belly, makes this the perfect swill for a chilly winter afternoon.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

A - Pours a deep orange brown with a fluffy billowing off-white head that hangs around a good bit before settling down to a nice ring of foam around the edges.  S - Sweetness. Candied fruits, brown sugar. Some dark fruit along with apple. Touch of yeast and a touch of alcohol.  T - Dark fruits and spice. It's sweet but a subdued sweetness - less than what I expected from the nose. A bit earthy. Dry. There's some spicy alcohol that tickles your throat on the the finish. Really tasty.  M - Dry and bubbly but still smooth and a bit chewy.  D - Good. Certainly a sipper, but it's so good you have to force yourself to only sip and not guzzle.

Its smooth still, and not overpowering. The brown sugar and spices add some sweetness to a bold dark ale.  Mouthfeel - Its thicker but still it doesnt ruin mouth.

Smell: rich with dark fruit like currants and fig. Belgian, yeasty spiciness stands out proudly. There's some sugary aromas and a bit of alcohol.  Taste: dark, rum soaked fruit stands out along with some dark sugars, a bit of Belgian spice and yeast flavors, and a bit of fruitiness. There's no real alcohol flavor in this one for me.  Feel: sweet, medium bodied, not much alcohol warmth, nicely carbonated.  Drink: could drink quite a few of these and I find myself wishing I had a 750ml bottle instead of this undersized one!

Way too drinkable for a beer that I paid $5.50, for a 12oz bottle.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Smell: Bread, some fruitiness like prune and/or banana  T: Bready, fruit, tart/sour, some alcohol on the nose and spice felt in the nose as well, like some mustard spice. There was a nice finish of bitterness at the finish. There is a very complex flavor profile.  Mouthfeel: Very effervescent, but not overwhelmingly so. A very nice, clean finish.

215,2512,philosobeer,4.69,"This is the first beer in my week of Trappist beers. A beer a day, one from each of the Trappist monasteries that bottle their beer. I poured this into a Chimay goblet.  A - cloudy, and very dark, brown with some orange-red notes. (Or is that red-orange?) White and tan in some parts of its sticky head. That head? Retained pretty well, by the way.  S - Anyway, this beer has a super yeasty aroma, you can smell the malt, but also some wine notes. It smells like a german white wine and lychee in a way that totally contrasts what I think of as a typical dark beer, even belgian dark beer. There's plum in the smell too. And maybe some raison.  T - The first thing I got here this time was some yeast and bread crust from darker malts. And some caramel flavors, that lead into sweetness and ... ahhh. Plum, fig, and date, seeds and nuts. It warmed a bit in the glass, and I tasted spicy notes, like grains of paradise. The alcohol is present and warm, but with a strong dark ale this is perfect winter drinking. I'd go on, but, for how could I? It might need a treatise.  M - Sharp on the tongue with its foamy effervescence, a touch of bitterness, and spice. High gravity, but not too high. which lends to its...  D - ...drinkability. Which is nice for a beer of its strength and complexity. But, uhhh, I couldn't drink tons of this, or probably have it every day, either. What can you really expect from this, though?

S: Sweet toffee drizzled figs and sugared dates. Cloves, leather, tobacco and just a hint of alcohol.  T: Flavors are a bit more subdued than the nose.

Amazing rich dry fruit aroma, raisins, plums, bread and grape skins. Tastes like a thick jam, again lots of dry fruits, yeast forward with a thick malt body. Deep flavor without being roasty.

Popped the cork and it went sailing across the room as if it were a bottle of champagne, poured a nice deep brown with four finger head that descended into a nice lacing that stayed all the way down ,moderate carbonation.  Taste - For a 9%abv brew I was expecting a hot brew that would be difficult to drink,That wasn't the case at all,This was smooth from start to finish,light malt flavors and some spices that combined makes this a extremely well blended and balanced brew.

The beer pours with a solid 9/10 glass full of head then slowly, real slow, disappears down to about 2 fingers. The head is a gorgeous off-white creme colour that has some decent ""volume"" to it. Beer is a solid amber colour and hard to tell the amount of carbonation.  Smell - I can smell some raisins, some spices and little hop present. There isn't an overall abundance of smell.  Taste - What a great tasting beer! There is a raisin presents at the start followed by a slight bitter spice. The beer leaves a warm aftertaste in my mouth as well. There is also a taste of sweetness somewhere in there, very faint.  Mouthfeel - decent amount of carbonation added here that brings the bitterness level up big time. This is where i felt u can taste the 9% alcohol level. The raisins pick up big time as well.  Drinkability - This is a fantastic beer that offers a lot to the mouth and palette!

215,2512,Chizoad,3.91,"I finally broke down and got the Blue after avoiding it for some reason. Too much hype probably. After having it built up too much I found it to be a bit of a letdown.  Poured a cloudy brown with hints of red. Nice head to it with big clumpy bubbles. A little flat on the nose but plum and stone fruit definitely in there.  Taste was odd at first when the beer was cold. Almost as if it had the same flavor a corked wine does. I let it warm to almost room temperature and that went away, along with the metallic bite it first had. Nice rich malts and not overwhelming to the palate. Raisins, dates. Good sweetness.  Decent mouthfeel, and very drinkable for the style. Wouldn't go out of my way to buy it again, but not gonna turn it down if offered.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

I drink mainly american craft, so this was a bit of a switch for me. and i normally dont review beers i drink, but after half a glass of this, i couldnt help myself but write down what i thought of it.  dark murky brown with maybe a reddish tint to it. head is only about half a finger and dissipates quickly, but looks superb. looks perfect in the goblet. i cant wait to taste it, but i put it off for a moment so i can take in its aroma. the most immediate smell is a lingering scent of belgium yeast. i search for more, i detect a light fruit scent, but not fruity. very faint in the aroma department, but not at all bad. rolls through my mouth with a smooth creaminess. i can taste the fruits i smelled with a maltiness that is both heavy and light at the same time. perfect balance of alcohol, not at all overpowering. carbonation is pretty high, but the bubbles are so fine that it works fantastically. taste lingers in my mouth in a good way, reminds me of that feeling your mouth gets after a sip of cranberry juice. all this sipping and the first glass is gone, so i guess that puts the drinkability pretty high. ill leave it at that as i refill my glass.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Taste -- Up front is sweet and fruity with fig and prune, rum raisin, red grape, and tart apple. Mid-palate is malty and rounded with spice and alcohol character coming to the forefront. Finish is slightly acidic, akin to plum skin, with a firm alcohol presence. Lingering flavors of grape skin and spice  Mouthfeel -- Medium in body with ample fizzy carbonation.

Raisin, Plums and many other dark fruits. Upon further smells I picked up the smell of brown sugar mixed in there. Very appealing.  T: The taste follow the nose almost exactly.

The aroma is a bit of a let down - a somewhat metallic edge overlaying some candy sweetness and yeast. Over time some raisin/plum notes come through but it's all pretty weak.  The taste is much better. A slightly pungent Belgian yeast profile with some cloves and plums. Alcohol dries it out so the lack of real bittering isn't a problem. A little sweetness but not too much.  Good mouthfeel but the carbonation is higher than I'd really like for this rich a drink.  For what it is it's plenty drinkable. If the aroma were better it would be more inviting, however, and smoother carbonation would add an elegance that I feel it's lacking.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,BBP,4.5,"A- Pours a thick chestnut brown with good carbonation, and a beautiful creamy head that kept pretty well considering the width of the glass it was in.  S- A little weak, but I can make out plum, a bit of grape, biscuit, and yeast.  T- Plum, grape, and raisin come in early and then buttery notes take over. For all the buttery notes I've seen in beer, this has some of the nicest. There's some very subtle spices to it as well. There's also a good amount of yeast to be tasted. All of these flavors balance incredibly well, and it makes for a very nice experience. It even has some hints of hops, that balance things but don't take away from the sweeter flavors.  M- Smooth and creamy. The carbonation is spot on. It makes the body feel nice and big while just a bit lighter, and doesn't feel abrasive at the same time by going overboard.  D- Superbly drinkable. There's not much booziness to be found, and the flavors are balanced quite well. I found that both of those things made this drink as impressive as it is. On the other hand, it did seem a little light in the flavor department, as nothing really pronounced itself more than any of the other flavors. It wasn't really assertive. It's the kind of drink that you could easily drink and think nothing of, or slowly drink to pick apart all of the details. I chose the second, and enjoyed it, but I'd love a version of this with everything amped up a bit.  Still a great beer. Pick up if you can.

S: Primarily dark fruit, with a bit of zing. Tart plums come to mind. Peppery, with some alcoholic yeastiness underneath. Robust. Later, after a bit of warmth, softer fruity smells come through -- stewed apple and even a hint of banana.  T: Spicy, sweet, fruity. Cooked apples. Coy cloves. Cracked pepper. A bit lighter and bit less developed than others I've had in the past, but this is the youngest I've tried. The aftertaste is round, sweet, and completely pleasant. As it warms, the flavours develop, grow, and improve.  M: Pleasantly effervescent, with the slightest stickiest that causes me to smack. Sweeping, forceful, ascendant. I like it.  D: A classic, and the beer that made me realise there was more to life than adjunct lager. This is my least favourite iteration of the Chimay Blue, but I'll jot that down to its age -- I'll try ageing one a few years and see what happens then.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Goes down pretty easy.  4.0 D: Definitely a solid offering, but I think there are some US breweries making stuff just as good at lower non-import prices.

215,2512,busternuggz,4.41,"Poured from a 11.2 oz bottle into a Belgian glass. Nice dark brown with a ruby/garnet tint and an amazingly persistent thick, lush, pillowy head. Leaves thick curtains of lacing. Nice smells of dried dates and herbs- like licorice root and/or gentian- at first. As it warms I smell some cloves and cinammon bark, a little bit of sugar- like turbinado sugar or something similar, and some kind of caramelized or candied dark fruit. A little like a rich fruitcake. Smells interesting but a little weird. Caramel, cocoa, stewed sweet figs, and light molasses on the taste, with some brown sugar notes toward the finish. The molasses comes back on the aftertaste, followed by a bit of dank earthiness. There's some floral notes too, like wet fresh flowers, and a bit of a menthol/medicinal taste. There's some sweetness but it's well balanced by the earthy and herbal notes, and the carbonation. As it warms the tastes blend together more smoothly and the herbal and floral notes die down. Very complex and exquisite, very close to a 5 on taste if not for just a bit too much of the medicinal quality. The texture is nice, carbonated enough to balance the body and sweetness yet still ends smooth and clean. Coats the tongue just slightly. For its complexity and alcohol, very drinkable. Hides the alcohol very well, though you get a peek at times. I could see cracking another one when I'm done just to dig in to all of these flavors again. An amazing beer. The nose, while interesting and complex, is slightly off-putting, and that menthol medicinal taste is a bit odd, but those are my only small complaints. Good stuff.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

The taste is light notes of dark fruit, pear, raisin, and slight cloviness. Finish is sweet and spicy with a candy quality throughout. Lesser notes of maple, vanilla, tangerine, and nutmeg are present as well.  The mouthfeel mouth is lighter than expected due to the soft and creamy carbonation. Alcohol is slightly noticeable in the finish but pleasant. Very soft mouthfeel.  Overall this is one of the best on the planet. Gets improved ratings as well because of the ease at which this can be found all across the country. Definitely a world class beer.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

T - Lots of caramel malts, has a toffee like sweetness to it. Big dark cherry presence with just a hint of vanilla and a nice peppery spice in the finish.

Ah the smell was very pleasant with raisins and cherries dominating. This certainly reminded me of the fruit cakes my grandmother baked back in the day.  Began with a raisin fig combination which was a main part of the taste and finished with the alcohol warming the chest. The malts were very apparent as well which led to the sweetness(not too sweet) of the ale.  Mouthfeel was thick and creamy. Really enjoyed it.  The drinkability was smooth and due to the 9%ABV definitely a sipper. Would certainly indulge again. Oh yeah definitely gets better as it warms.,Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,pilotgod,4.78,"Poured 07/09 vintage from the 750ml into a Chimay chalice.  A: Wonderful dark color that appears brown, when held to a light it becomes apparent it is really a dark burgundy. When poured with 45 degree tilt it leaves a good nearly two finger head that remains all the way through the drink and leaves great Belgian lace.  S: Lots of fruit and floral notes, must be how the monastery's gardens smell in Spring. Better noses will pick out specific fruits, I detect cherry and possibly apple. The malt notes are very apparent, but there is bit of an alcohol nip that can overpower the other notes. Great smell, but not the best of the Trappist styles.  T: Excellent, smooth and malty. Fruit apparent is mainly a dark cherry note with malty presence to sweeten. This is balance by hoppy notes. The whole ensemble comes together to produce one of my favorite brews.  M: Good, the carbonation can be a little too much. The mouthfeel goes up the longer the beer is aged.  D: This is one of my favorite brews. I can drink it for lunch, dinner, after dinner and just because. The only issue I've found is that everyone agrees it is best to age it. Sorry, but I can't have a bottle of this and let it sit. I HAVE to drink it. If you've never had a Trappist Ale this is the best one to start with.

More cherries and fruity esters keep going wild and wonderful and somewhat port like. Some spice from yeast and hops in the background.  T: Dark cherries, black currants, vanilla, jasmine, roasted caramel and bready malts combine with some toffee and molasses sweetness. Some sherry and port like flavors with a spicy yeast and it is a touch of heaven. Finish is smooth and well balanced.

A: Pours a red mahogany, opaque, 2-finger foamy head that hangs for a little while and leaves good lacing.  S: Dark fruits, bread, alcohol esters  T: A nicely complex mix of a variety of dark fruits, the esters come through fairly strong, lots of bread with the malt, very little hop presence.  M: A little heavy for a Belgian Strong Ale, but that's good news for me. Fairly dry, especially on the finish. Carbonation is moderate and mellows fairly quickly over time, which is exactly what I want. The alcohol does have a pretty strong presence in the finish, but the esters taste more like that of a dry red wine than anything. Very pleasant.  D: This is definitely a strong beer and the heavy presence of alcohol esters make it tough to drink more than one glass, but the great complex flavors and wine-like finish leave you reaching for more.  Overall I was impressed by this Strong Ale. It didn't blow me away like I was expecting, but it does seem to be growing on me the more Belgian strong ales I try.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,BuckyFresh,4.59,"Appearance: Poured from an 11.2oz bottle into a large wine glass. Pours a very murky dark brown/amber, with a foamy, tan one-finger head. Head recedes fairly quickly, but a thin film remains on the surface, pummeled by the active carbonation below. There is very little carbonation to speak of.  Smell: Aroma is everything I hoped it would be. Wonderful bready yeast, refreshing citrus, and deep dark fruit smells make this one complex and inviting. There is a spicy funk happening as well, and I'm picking up something in the background that smells like cookies.  Taste: Flavor has elements of plumb, yeast, brandy, molasses, raisins, and some spiciness. The bite from the carbonation is a nice contrast from the sweeter side of the beer and helps hide the higher ABV really well.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, with carbonation that is prickly on the tongue. There is some coating warmth from the alcohol, but much less than beers of a similar ABV.  Drinkability: Drinkability is very good for a beer with such a high alcohol content. The finish is is fairly dry and refreshing.

215,2512,ToasterChef,4.8,"Poured from a cellar temperature 33 cl bottle into a Chimay goblet. The beer has a dark brown color; It is to dark for any light to penetrate. The head is about a finger in thickness and composed of egg shell colored foam. Fairly even lacing is left behind as I swirl the glass about.  The aroma is very interesting. Slightly sweet, it reminds me of a red, velvety candy. There is some molasses. Aspects remind me of ginger snap cookies, although I would say that there is any ginger in the nose. There is only the slightest bitterness, but a grassy aroma is present. A hint of the alcohol is also hidden in the mix.  A smooth, prune and plum like flavor greets my tongue as I sip the beer. A bit of molasses is also apparent. The finish is crisp and effervescent. It has that neat twist that the Chimay yeast provides which has none of the mustiness Belgian yeast strains often impart on a beer. It is an all-around exception strong dark Belgian flavor.  The Blue has a medium body and a lot of carbonation. The bubbles are not distracting, but can certainly be felt, especially if you hold the beer on your tongue briefly before swallowing. A coat is left behind, but it isn't sticky or thick; it is much less intense than other 9% ABV beers.  For such a strong beer, this is incredibly drinkable.

Nice malt character but overall weak; fruit, spice, and bitterness for the most part. The bitterness could certainly be from hops but has the slightly burnt sugar character.  Mouthfeel Medium body; medium carbonation, that is prickly at times. Sweet to medium finish with a long aftertaste of fruit, malt, and spice.  Drinkability not a beer that I could have more than 1 of at a sitting.  Good beer. But I do not feel that this is among the best Belgian brews I have had.

Lots of Belgian yeast coming through in the nose...a nice spiciness, fresh bread, dark fruits, sweet malts - wonderful aromas in this beer. The taste falls right in line with the scents, subtle dark fruits (plums were my first thought), the bready yeast, a touch of spice (clove / coriander) and some malty sweetness to balance it all out.

It smells of sour apples, spice, squah bread and a touch of raisin-rum alcohol. The nose is fairly subdued, but gentle twirling releases the aroma...quite complex.  At the front of the sip, the fruity esters of the yeast combine with caramelly malts, but the alcohol is strong and counters any anticipated sweetness. The raisin-y tones are noted, along with cherries and and holiday spice, suggesting clove and nutmeg. The flavor profile is complex and takes a bit of unraveling. The entire swallow is distinctly bread-like (even for beer), as if fresh, artisan bread soaked up all of these amazing flavors. This brew is soothingly rich and creamy on the palate, so it works best if slowly sipped. Still, the striking balance will keep your interest.

215,2512,Kinsman,3.87,"Vintage 2009. Poured from the bottle into my chalice, this beer shows off with a chestnut colored reddish/brown body and a massive pillowy light-tan colored head.  Aroma is most noticeably spicy, with strong hints of clove, and little room for anything else. There is an underlying fruity aroma reminiscent of apples and maybe even cherries, but the fruitness tends to come and go.  While the spice seems to dominate the aroma, it sits back a bit in the taste, allowing for a stronger presence of dark fruits like raisins and a sweet alcohol flavor like rum. With a bottle thats at least 10 months old, I'm surprised how noticeable the alcohol seems to be, but its certainly not too hot. Clove-like spice does balance out the sweeter flavors and there is even a slight bitterness in the finish.  Mouthfeel is a solid medium body, and quite bubbly. Actually, with the loud pop of the cork and huge head, carbonation seems to be a bit high, and it is noticeable with each sip.  Overall, this is, like many other have said, a top notch Belgian. It almost defines the BSDA style and it certainly deserves its reputation, but it just isn't the ""wow"" beer I expected. At it's price point, compared to other regularly available BSDA's, this is not the best value out there, but definitely one that everyone should try.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Shared at Thanksgiving dinner with friends and family.  A: Bottle was very difficult to open, I think it had been waxed to help the seal. the cap that the cage rests under was fused to the cork. Once this was removed with the help of a knife however, it made things much easier. I half expected a gusher, since the bottle had been jostled around a lot. That was not the case however and the pour went perfect into 2 large wine glasses. Much head generated from a heavy pour, and a slight lacing was left with no head retention. Body is a mahogany colored liquid with ruby accents. There was no chunkiness, residual yeast, or floaties of any kind.(3.5)  S: Michael Jackson called this the most port like of all beers. I have never agreed with this until I had this aged version of this beer. I had a couple glasses of port a few weeks earlier at a bachelor party and this Chimay definitely reminded me of that night. Slightly oxidized, but somehow not in a bad way. Almost like opening an old book. The usual apple, cherry, plum, marzipan and dark fruits are present as well (5.0)  T: Almost a wine/ grape like sensation here. Again a little oxidized, but still very pleasant. Fruit flavors are more subdued than a young bottle, but much less edgy. I think 10 years for this particular bottle was the right amount of time. any longer and I think it would have declined a bit. (5.0)  M: carbonation was perfect. Complaints of over carbonation in young bottles are common, but this one seemed a little on the still side which suited the flavors perfectly. Body was a little thin, and not sticky at all. surprising for a %9 beer.

215,2512,bamadog,4.2,"Well, like many other beers, this is one that I've been seeing on the shelves since I moved to this area and just never got around to picking it up. Since things have seemed especially slow in terms of cool new beers showing up on the shelves, I've caved and popped for it. Review is from notes taken on 10/6/2010 and poured from the bottle to a tulip.  Appearance: Pours a relatively dark, cider-like brown; starts with a big 3 and 1/2 finger fluffy tan head with really solid retention; head slowly fades to a billowy cap and leaves thick patches of lacing here and there; body is pretty cloudy and murky;  Smell: Rich toffee/caramel maltiness; warm Belgium spices; a bit of a faint hoppy bitterness in there that's a bit grassy  Taste: An interested set of flavors, most not uncommon for the style -- nice rich and sweet caramel malts and warming Belgian spiciness (cardamom, nutmeg, cloves); bit of a faint (yet still very present) hop bitterness and a bit of an earthy/grainy/mulchiness; as the flavors swirl around in the mouth, towards the end the malts and spices take over the flavors and it becomes a bit more familiar; definite warming presence of alcohol as well.  Mouthfeel: Body is just a hair under what I would typically consider to be medium in weight; carbonation is strong and prickly, just shy of sharp, so the body comes across as lively; the mouth and belly are definitely left warm from the 9% ABV; a thin semi-dry sticky coating is left, particularly on the roof of the mouth.  Drinkability: A very good beer with an interesting hoppiness to it -- clearly, I'm not an expert on BSDAs or anything, but I've had quite a few and typically this ingredient is typically more subdued and I think that's a pretty cool take on it, especially from one of the older breweries in the world; very nice flavors and a nice smell (wish it was just a bit bigger, but still good) and a nice finish; it doesn't really sit all that heavy, so I would say the only thing that would slow anyone down on this beer is the ABV.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

215,2512,TheHammer,3.9,"Finally decided to finish off the last of my Chimay three pack, poured this into the Chimay chalice it came with.  Appearance: A deep opaque brown of which particles of yeast can be seen. A finger of carbonation is produced, that retains decentlyl although did not lace.  Smell: Lightly roasted malt provides the backdrop for the smell of plums, dates and figs with a yeasty undertone. There is a slight alcholic scent to it though. Warming however is needed to get the full effect.  Taste: The yeast and alcholic taste to this one really takes away from the experience as both are predominant throughout the entire beer. It starts with some doughy malt which then allows the dark fruit taste with notes of cherries and grapes kick in as the yeast goes into overdrive to then be well rounded out by earthy hops. Make sure you drink it at the right temperature, I tried a sip while cold and it's not so great.  Mouthfeel: Good creamy carbonation, good transitioning, subdued dough like aftertaste are all great things which help it's case. However the high alchohol content isn't disguised at all and it is a bit too solvent in nature.  Drinkability: Well, it does a lot of things right, and while the yeast doesn't try the beer out that much, it does take away from it. Sits down easy and if not for the high alchol content it would be a lot smoother.  Final Thoughts: While BA may regard this as Chimay's best offering, I find it to be their worst. It seems a bit too plain to be a high class beer like their other offerings, and the undisguised alchohol content isn't doing it any favours.

The mouthfeel was warm from the alcohol-not too terribly syrupy for the darkness - and it lingered for a second gently nudging my taste buds until they resonded.

A: Pours Coca-Cola brown, with a mean 1.5 inch + head, and carbonation to boot. Beautiful!  S: Caramel malts, plums, raisons, and hint of brown sugar.  T: I taste everything I just smelled, but also a hint of chocolate. The aftertaste is smooth as silk. This is the least ""funky"" Belgian I've had in a good while.  M: This is probably the smoothest beer in this style class I've ever tasted. The sugar is present without being syrupy, and the foaminess (and there is A LOT!) adds to the brew's charm.

S: Rich notes of dark fruit, figs, dark malts, Belgian spices and spicy yeast. Lots of clove and slight vanilla. T: Light notes of dark fruits, pear, raisins and peppery spices dominate. Finish is spicy but has a fair amount of candied sweetness to it. Notes of maple, vanilla, tangerine, and nutmeg are present as well. M: Mouth is lighter than expected due to the soft and creamy carbonation. Alcohol is slightly noticeable in the finish but pleasant. Very soft mouthfeel.

Medium to full bodied bouquet with a maple-honey sweetness and vanilla extract notes. It almost smells like being in a sweets shop. Very inviting.  T - Very well-balanced and delecate. Great sweetness and vanilla is perfectly accompanied by a soft bitterness. The balance of this beer can not be over-articulated; it was absolutely wonderfully crafted.  M - Medium bodied feel with soft carbonated bite. Again, vanilla and honey character is present.  D - This is a slightly heavy beer, not so in the light of a stout or heavy porter, but it is certainly heavy. I don't know how much of this I could have in one night.

The head recedes quickly as expected and true ton the style. Aromas of caramelized sugars, Pete moss, some rich bready, raisins and some rum even come through. Sweet smelling with a slight booze kick. The taste has rich caramelized sugars, sweet raisin bagel breadiness. Alcohol esters come through but are contained with rich malts that are comforting and very smooth. Carbonated to the max, this cuts through my steak easily. Really pairs well but I bet this would be heaven with vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce. Drinkability is perfect.

215,2512,CrellMoset,4.12,"750 mL corked and caged bottle purchased by a good friend. Poured in to a snifter.  Appearance: Pours a maple brown sugar glaze, crystalline around the edges and perhaps crystalline farther in, but it's both darkly hued enough as well as slightly hazed (courtesy of some yeasties) that you can't really tell. An initial explosion of fizzy, sudsy head surges and gurgles and foams forth before collapsing just as quickly, exposing the source of that head - tons of burbling effervescence seething forth from the bottom of the snifter, straight up to the surface as well as rippling and bubbling up the sides of the snifter. Absolutely volcanic at first, though ultimately it does calm down significantly.  Aroma: Cherry juice, cardamom, clove, apple juice, raisins ... a bunch of sweet, fruity notes, bathed in heavily caramelized and toasty sugars, brown sugar, molasses, slight toast. Drastically improves as this one warms.  Taste: Much dryer. A dry but solidly malty beer, in terms of foundation. Well-attenuated brown sugar, caramel, toffee, and dessert bread notes, coupled with a nice handful of fruity notes - cherries, most strongly, but also raisins, dates, slight figs, and faint tropical fruits. Hints of citrus intermingle with cloves, cardamom, and other great medicinal phenols. Not a standout beer in terms of taste, but this is clearly a complex-tasting beer, with a dry (but varied) enough backbone to both keep things interesting and provide plenty of chances for everything to shine through.  Mouthfeel: Initially a fizzy, crisp, over the top, uneven mess, this one really does even out nicely, at least, as of the time I'm typing this. We'll see if it turns in to a syrupy mess soon. Nope. Not yet. Still very nice!  Drinkability: A beer that I was a little less impressed by than I'd hoped. Don't get me wrong - it's a well-crafted beer. But it's a little too subtle, a little too subdued, a little too quirky - process wise - to be a true standout, even with its complexity. I appreciate the balance and the dryness, as well as all the great yeasty notes, but there are a few things missing here that could improve this beer, and I would have hoped and assumed Chimay would have done those things by now (maybe my tastes are just funky). Regardless, it's still a solid well-made beer, and one I'd be happy to have again if the right pairing came along.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Aroma is full of nice hints; raisins & other dried dark fruits, yeast, sweet caramel malt. A very nice typical belgian strong dark ale nose. Taste is full of spice brown sugar sweetness. I do think the mouthfeel is a bit different for the style; on the thin side of moderate with a thin fizzy feel. A very enjoyable strong dark.

215,2512,ThePorterSorter,4.33,"I have waited for a truly special occasion to drink this beer. In this case, that happened to be friends and home-cooked Italian food. After pulling the beer out to warm from being chilled in the fridge, I noticed the cork beginning to wedge its way out of the bottle. Incredible power. It was right then I knew this beer would be comparable to a good champagne. My tulip glass is happy to have true Belgian contents swirled and wafted.  Appearance: The beer pours a dark brown mahogany, but the light reveals it is cherry in color. An outstanding head forms that's almost light brown/tan. Lacing down the glass and ample carbonation (needless to say after almost shooting a hole through the ceiling with the cork). It looks incredibly rich and inviting, not like any beer I've seen.  Smell: Quick wafting releases a fruity, almost wine-like essence followed by a more subtle yeast undertone. Not a heavy aroma at all, more sweetness seems to be hitting the olfactory. I am also reminded of raisins, cherries and roasted fig with the brim suctioned to my face until my nose starts giving me answers...  Taste: Unique. This must be some heavily guarded water because they are helping to produce a masterpiece. There are no doubts in my mind that I'm drinking a well balanced beer with deeply protected complexity. There is almost no hint of the 9%abv while drinking, everybody is keeping their mouth shut. It's a good beer and tastes like one, especially if you enjoy Belgians as much as I do.  Mouthfeel: Feels wonderful. Its caramel smoothness is followed by a refreshing rush of tiny bottle fermentation bubbles. Yes, I have been drinking this beer while reviewing it...but, that's the only way to do it. My first impression from taking a sip is a sweet malt without any bitter in the swallow.  Drinkability: Drink responsibly. This beer is highly drinkable and highly enjoyable chilled -&gt; RT. You will grow with this beer and it's safe to base your first impressions of a good Belgian ale on this particular interpretation.

The head dissapates rather quickly while leaving a bit of froth on top.  The smell includes strong caramel malt with a hint of brown sugar and alcohol.  The taste initially reflects the caramel that was in the smell with the addition of Balgian yeast, but quickly evolves into a plethora of spices with a hint of alcohol to round out the flavors in the finish.

Overall not super aromatic for a big BSDA but still very nice.  Taste: More dark fruity esters, with more traditional Belgian yeast clove coming through. The sweet biscuity malt really balances this one out at the finish. Just the slightest twinge of alcohol in there as well.  Mouthfeel: Very heavy body with a palate coating slickness.  Drinkability: As just any regular Belgian brew, this one is a huge winner. However it really doesn't stand up to well against the rest of the Trappist brews out there.

Wonderfully dense and cloudy, the rich mahogany-colored ale delivers in the taste what is promised by the presentation. Thoroughly balanced, the tongue is hit with a round mouthful of toasted malts with a caramel-nut accent and a kind of buttery feel that flows smoothly into a deliciously pleasant, roasted treacle and bitter hops flavor in the back palate.

215,2512,StephenRich,4.23,"To cap off the trio of Chimay Trappist beers, we will discuss the grand daddy of them all; the Grande Reserve. The other two beers in Chimay's lineup, the Premier (Red), and the White, both show unique flavors and marvelously distinct Belgian qualities. The Premier is a Dubbel at 7%, the White is a Tripel at 8%, and the Grande Reserve is a Belgian Strong Dark Ale at 9%.  This specific beer style makes me smile every time. If well done (which this is) they can be so entertainingly complex, hugely luscious, and rewardingly delicious. A huge range of flavors can find a home in a Belgian Strong Dark Ale; anything from spices like cinnamon, cardamom, pepper, clove and nutmeg, to fruits like plums, cherries, oranges, figs and bananas, all the way to hops with big earthy rich aromas and zesty acid-like tartness. The Chimay Blue is a true classic, and among my favorites - the level of rich depth erupting from this beer begs for it to be aged for years. If only I could wait that long...  The Grande Reserve comes in 330ml stubby bottles, 750ml corked bottles, and the large corked magnum - which is the only Chimay bottle to be dated. I want 5.  I opened the Blue close to cellar temperature around 12C (54F). Like all Chimay beers, the Grande Reserve is bottle conditioned. I don't always include the sediment resting at the bottom of the bottle in my pour with a bottle conditioned beer - sometimes the earthy yeast flavors can bring an unfortunate bitterness that is not well suited for the beer. With big Belgian Darks though like this one it can fit the flavor profile adding balance and complexity. I made sure that I swirled the bottle close to the end of the pour so that I would be able to enjoy everything this treat has to offer.  The pour was dark and rumbling; it formed life and excitement where it hit the chalice and eventually built a fluffy light brown, close to khaki head. There were streaming pockets of air everywhere in the foam - some small and dense, others near the top were large and mountainous. The beer itself a deep and dark purple garnet with rich mahogany shining though - maroon, copper, dark amber reds and brick browns all glow in the stance of this beer. It was totally opaque, but not hazy; just very calm and deep in thought.  The nose is potent and again, complex. Big spice comes in right away accompanied by thick dark fruits, and an earthy musk - seemingly yeasty. Cloves and nutmeg battle out in front and lead into a deep a richly sweet malt backbone. Rich figs soak in dark brandy, while plums, apricots, stewed pears and dates get mashed together and float up into my olfactory sensors. The yeast comes in still with a lightly funky earth note and hints at tart fruit zest. The lightest and faintest touch of hop freshness glides in and shows a hint of bitter.  Open yourself up fully to the Grande Reserve. A light sip will not come close to unleashing everything that is contained in this beer. Thus, a generous wave of the blue will bring with it big malt richness showing the wild combination of layered fruits and spice that you can pull so easily out of the nose. Spicy and gooey figs and dates come though first, then smooth plums, apricots and molasses melts its way in. That brandy soaked fruit sensation is back and fills your entire mouth.  It may sounds like this is thus far massively sweet, but these big flavors are all very mellow. Rich, but mellow. Beyond that, there is a good punch of earthy yeast and hints of tart spice and bitter hops to balance it out. A surprisingly light and sparling mouthfeel also keeps the texture clean and crisp. I was expecting something silkier and lush, but this keeps the beer alive and exciting. Otherwise it could near overpowering (which I also enjoy).  The overall sensation here is rich complex malt with layers of spice and funk balancing out to a warming and and vastly soothing Belgian ale. The finish is sweet and dry at the same time with a crisp and abrupt end made possible by the beers large amount of natural effervescent carbonation. Beers like this are so magical with food - because it is balanced, yet hugely aromatic and displays a wide range of flavors it can match everything from roast beef to chocolate cherry trifle. I do recommend enjoying your first one own its own.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Big taste of alcohol is the first impression. More cherry, some plum maybe. I can't really differentiate fig from plum, raisin etc. . .

215,2512,Thehuntmaster,4.13,"2010 330ml bottle 9,0% ABV  Appearance: Hazy, dark brown in colour with great orangey-red highlights when held to the light. The head, as with most Belgians, is a thing of beauty. Massive, tan brown, great retention and lace, could one ask for more?  Smell: The nose is a mix of sweet fruit and the typical spiciness of Belgian yeast, with the spice coming out top in intensity. The first aroma noted is clove, followed by pepper. A little warming and the sweeter and fruitier notes start to come through. Dates, plums, cherries, currants, molasses, hints of dark sugar and rum all make an appearance. Don't get me wrong, this is a great nose, but a little more intensity is needed to make it truly world class.  Taste: The taste follows on well from the nose, but has a better balance between the sweet and spicy notes. Dark fruits (currants, dates and plums) and spices (clove and white pepper) are present in equal amounts. Dark caramelized sugar, toasted brown bread and a touch of molasses also make an appearance. The alcohol is not as well hidden as in the nose, however it is well integrated into the flavour profile and does not detract from the beer.  Mouthfeel: Just fuller than medium bodied with massive carbonation (A tad too much for my liking). A gentle alcohol warmth is felt in the back of the throat.  Drinkability: A quality brew and one i will certainly have again. A 750 would go down very well over the course of a good meal.  I must admit I was a little disappointed in Grande Reserve, though I can't help but feeling that an aged bottle could well be the world class ale I was expecting. I will most certainly age my next one for 2 - 3 years minimum.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

I had this so many times over the years and was my first Trappist I ever had, as it was the first I ever seen in England, later the US. Reviewing a standard non aged bottle.  A: Poured in a fine crystal tulip. some fine lacing at 55f it lasted about 1 minute or so. reddish brown in color. very nice, but it always looks nice to me.  S: divine stuff, lots of dark plums, some leather, dark candy, dark malt. Alcohol is detected in the nose, no hops detected in the smell. as it warms you get a spicy almost clove like smell. I also get some coffee hints.  T: I get sweet dark plums and spice, hints of dark candy sugar that tastes like rum and molasses. Balanced semi sweet beer, that does have a heavy alcohol profile. Some spice like clove candy, you cannot taste the hops, but you know its in there, the Belgian yeast also add a classic Trappist flavor profile, something you get after you had many of these not that bitter, but mostly semi sweet.  M: Medium-full body. Moderate carbonation.  D: decent but not my favorite of this style, but I never turn it down either.

I always figured some age would do this beer some good, and indeed I definitely liked this much more than fresher bottles I've had in the past. Definitely reminiscent of aged Rocheforts, Abt 12, etc.  Original review: (scores - 4/4/3.5/3/3.5) 08/09 on the cork, 750ml split amongst some people.  Pours dark brown with a fizzy tan-flecked white head. Turns to a swirly cap and leaves some lacing.  Smell is nice typical Belgian, lots of yeast, caramel, nuts and dark fruit.  Flavors are good but this is way too boozy for my liking. Way too much for 9% anyway, especially since it's aged. Strong flavors of plum, figs/raisin, brown sugar, alcohol, spice and clove. Tasty yeast notes are more present towards the end.  Has a nice creamy texture but booze and carbonation are a bother.

I poured this one from a 33cl/330ml/11.2oz bottle into a fairly decent sized tulip glass.  Appearance: Dark hazy brown with a thick cream colored head quite nice looking overall.  Aroma: smells of caramel brown sugar, caramel, plums, cloves, and cinnamon.  Taste: very full bodied in flavor and as the nose suggests tastes of, caramel, plums, prunes, slight fig tastes, accompanied by tastes of cinnamon cloves and nutmeg.

Pours a dark nutty brown that is almost opaque at the core with ruby accents at the edges of the glass. I got three fingers of a light-khaki, pillowy head that held together nicely. Columns of bubbles climb the sides of the glass. Beautiful presentation.  S: The most prevalent aroma is a funky Belgian yeast note, sort of floral and spicy. Next, I get a big helping of malt, molasses, and brown sugar.  T: Follows the nose, only kicked up a notch. As with most of the Trappist beers I've tried, there's a noticeable fruity characteristic (possibly from the yeast), although this is much darker than what you'd find in tripel or the like. Raisin bread comes to mind, although the bread note is more outspoken. Somewhat sweet, but not overly so. No real hop quality or bitterness to speak of.  M: It's definitely heavy on the palate, and rightly so with such a complex combination of flavors. However, it's also surprisingly refreshing. The alcohol isn't menacing at all, and in fact adds a nice warming to the palate. There's also this lovely tingling sensation thanks to the carbonation that coats the entire mouth for some time.

Dense amounts of breads and grains fill the aroma that is accented with slight touches of fruit (perhaps cherries along with other ""richer"" fruits) as well as a flowery touch. Full-bodied and complete while remaining very simple.  T: Follows the aroma pretty well. A very hearty and filling beer with upfront yeast characteristics. However, the taste really brings the fruits to the forefront and highlights the rich flavors that add a unique and memorable characteristic to the beer.

Big pillowy four-finger head the takes 30 seconds or so to drop down to a thin cap that sticks around for the remainder of the beer's lifetime. A bit of sheeting on the glass, not much for lacing. It doesn't last very long, meaning the lacing is only about two fingers off the cap of the beer all the way down.  S - Raisins, dates, and figs, pretty standard stuff. Then some caramelized sugar, toffee, and vanilla. some yeast on the finish. I know it's not unusual for this style, but I can't think of aromas that I would want more than these.  T - Follows through on the aroma, but maybe a bit more on the candied sugar side. The toffee and vanilla really sing, and is dominant on the finish. Creme brulee in a glass.  M - The weakest point for this one, and it's not even weak, just not as strong as the other aspects. It's nice and creamy, but the carbonation fades just a bit too quickly.

Smells pretty mild, flowery smelling and I'm not sure if this is right but it smells sort of metallic. Tastes better than it smells though. Tastes of orange with a bit of nuttiness, very balanced and easy to drink, no one flavor stands out more than the other. Medium bodied and smooth, just the right amount of carbonation. This beer goes down oh so smoothly, the alcohol is hidden incredibly well, a wonderful representation of style.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,BJamesII,4.92,"This Dark strong ale comes in at 9% ABV. A dark reddish brown color with a thin head. This beer is flavorful yet not over the top. If you had no preconceptions about the strength of the beer itself you would not think it was strong. Many heavier ales with high alcohols tend to exhibit their strength in the taste. Grande Reserve is not at all like this. It is smooth and easy to drink. There is a dried fruit character and it is not sweet or real heavy. The body feels medium and it is relatively dry yet aromatic. This bottle (750 ml) in particular had slightly less flavor that others I have tasted. Overall it is one of the best Dark Belgians one can spend about $12 (bevmo) on and not feel guilty about the expenditure. After the bottle was finished... needless to say so was I. Even though you can't taste the alcohol, believe me it's there!!!

215,2512,Millski7,4.83,"Poured into a Chimay Chalice from a 11.2 oz bottle.  Very nice pour with a caramel head, somewhat off white. A nice deep caramel brown color with noticeable particles of yeast floating along with some other flavorings. There is a nice hint of roses or flowers when catching the aromas. When drinking this ale, the first key note is the balance and medium mouthfeel. Perfectly balanced and not overpowering in any way. The taste is extremely balanced with a low to mild bitterness at the end, yet the primary taste is still this flowery feel. The 9% alc. hides extraordinarily well and will catch up on you. Overall an exceptional very smooth beer to drink.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,metter98,4.5,"A: The beer poured cloudy brown into a goblet. It had a pillowy head that was off white in color, suspended the yeast particles (resembled nutmeg on eggnog) and left nice lacing patterns. There are also lots of particles floating near the bottom. S: Complex aromas of dark fruits provide for a rather sweet smell in the nose, particularly as the beer warms up. Notes of grapes and plums really stand out to my nostrils. T: Dominated with flavors of dark fruits, the taste shares a lot of similarities with the aroma. Some flavors of spices are also detectable. M: It feels medium-bodied on the palate and very smooth. There is a slight amount of dryness in the finish. D: Although the alcohol is well masked, this beer is a great beer to sip and savor all of the complexities in the aroma and taste.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

215,2512,Epicedion,4.45,"750mL bottle poured into a Chimay goblet.  A: Brown to dark amber. A little like a very dark maple syrup. An aggressive pour got a little bit of a head which faded rapidly down to just a little tiny bit of foam around the edge of the glass. Very little lacing.  S: Lightly sweet. There's some evidence of spice in the nose, and maybe some fig.  T: This is a fairly sweet beer, with just enough bitterness to keep the sweet from being overwhelming. The raisin/plum comparison is okay, but it's very blended and smooth as opposed to having any standout tastes. It's good. It's very good. It's just not as complex as some of the other beers out of the Chimay lineup.  M: It really fills and coats the palate. Medium body and just enough carbonation to give it volume. A fairly long, bittersweet finish that doesn't quite dry the mouth, but does leave the impression of alcohol.  D: Far too drinkable. Nothing about this beer is overwhelming, and it's just as easy to sip it slowly as it is to swig.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

I am writing this after drinking the entire bottle, well, it was very very good. Great drinkability and look and feel. I am not one for useless (sorry) adjectives to describe the beer, but man, it was great. Drank it with some burgers and potato salad... mmm mmm good. The head was light cream with nice carbonation. I also really like the yeast in the pour, leave it in the bottle if you like, but it really adds to the depth, I think. Great if you are looking for high alcohol and great taste.

Aroma: Dark fruit: plums, raisins, belgian yeast, spices, heavy bready malt.  Taste: Plums and raisins upfront. The malt tastes amost like liquid whole wheat bread. Theres some spicy Belgian yeast and a touch of warming alcohol at the finish. This is now the third time I've tried it, and perhaps the worst. It tastes a bit... flat. Oh well, here's hoping it was just a bad bottle.  Mouthfeel Soft and smooth. Medium-bodied. caresses the mouth in a bittersweet embrace that ends. Prickly carbonation throughout.

215,2512,argock,4.19,"Poured from 11.2oz brown bottle into a Chimay goblet. L08-367 on the back label. Purchased as part of a Chimay gift pack.  A: Mahogany brown with short mocha shaded head with spots of lace.  S: Dark fruits like raisins, prunes, and candied dates predominate with some vanilla, cocoa, and light spicing. Hops are light and earthy. Alcohol is not overpowering but lends some berry qualities. An excellent compilation of malty aromas.  T: Dense dark fruit flavors mimic the aroma with less spice but delicious prune, raisin, and grape flavors, brown sugar and molasses, and much lighter spice component. Hops are lightly drying and herbal. Alcohol comes through pretty strong in this 1-2 year old capped bottle.  M: The body could be a bit beefier although it is easily medium and little more. The carbonation is subdued and the aftertaste is very long and malty.  D: I am intrigued by this brew -- I am going to purchased a few corked 750s and see what transpires over the time. In the meantime, this is a tasty treat for malt lovers, and I can only imagine 5 years of cellaring will deepen the maltiness and tone down the alcohol. I still enjoy Rochefort 10 a lot more -- better feel, more complex flavor. Still, Chimay Blue is no slouch.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

T: Wow, this is really complex. Dark fruits again, raisins and dark cherries. Vanilla and a slight oak influence? Red grapes. It kind of reminds me of a mix between pipe tobacco and champagne. Short, subtle finish. ABV is hidden very well. I would like to try this again in the future when I've had more reviews under me.  M/D: Medium body, with a crazy thick velvety mouthfeel from tons of small zippy carbonation bubbles. Its like the beer turns very thick since the carbonation is so high. It makes the body seem fuller than it really is. Drinkability is pretty good partly because of the great mouthfeel, but also because its so interesting, in a good way, but you have to be in the right mood for this beer, not something I could have everyday.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

The taste is starting with sweet dried fruits, figs and dates, some hint of sour notes - a whiff of lambic, malty earthy tones, dark bread crust and finish of with a few bitter almond notes.  Rather high carbonation, small bubbles and a smooth feeling that goes over in a warm and dry feeling.  This is truly one of the greatest beers. Enjoyed with a ripe Gruyère.

215,2512,Ragedman,4.45,"Upon reading all the reviews for Grande Reserve I had to try it. Lucky for me my local grocer (Albertsons) stock the blue, red, and white label. At $13 a bottle the Chimay Grande Reserve isn't cheap.  Opening the cork was fun (champagne anyone), but it's whats on the inside that matters. This beer pours a dark caramel with a tan head that quickly fizzes away. Hardly any lacing either. The beer's look is much darker than any other strong ale I have seen. Earns a solid 4.5  Smell is very caramely, and i catch whiffs of grapes, very malty also. Not a bad smelling beer at all.  Taste is very unique. It does seem to have a flavor of white wine but the taste is far more unique. Sweet at first, then the alcohol follows once the sweet taste has calmed down. A very good tasting beer.  The one thing about the blue label that has set me off was its carbonation. It seems a bit over carbonated, the bubbles bite in the mouth for the first second. Once past that the beer goes down easy and it very easy to enjoy.  Will have to pick up all the labels very soon.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Fruit, caramel, and brown sugar aromas. The fruit aromas roll onto tounge. Figs. Raisins. Has a full-bodied mouthfeel. Somewhat dry also. The 9% abv is well hidden IMO. A great, flavorful brew.

The smell of this beer is yeasty and can slighty smell the alcohol.  The taste is what really makes this beer. First off you get the taste of the yeast which is almost biscuit like. After the rush of yeast you get fruits like apricot and raisins. Lastly you get the alcohol.  The mouthfeel is not too think and its pretty carbonated.  The drinkability is probably a one to two time beer in one sitting because of the alcohol.  I will buy this again and recommend it to people!",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Pours a clear brown with a thick finger of tan, borderline light brown, head. Large number of individual streams of small bubbles rising from the bottom.  Highly carbonated and very creamy; almost mousse like with a tongue coating property. Mouth enveloping also.  Dark sugary malt upfront with a very long sweet finish that has some faint citrus acid/tartness that is reminiscent of lemon. Grapes and plums are compromise the fruity flavor. Balance is spot on with no cloyingly sweetness. Alcohol heat is noticeable at swallow but under control. Bitterness is very mild with a small tingle on the tongue and a quick dissipation.

Looks nice, a dark brown with plum edges. Nice head is huge and sticks around.  Smell is grapes, raisins, apple, sweet candy sugar and bready malt. Some spicey notes as well from the yeast.  Taste follows the nose. Raisin bread with crust. Molasses. Slight alcohol warmth. Just not enough flavor compared to some other beers in this genre (Rochfort 8 for example). But for a Trappist you can get at the local supermarket, this is extraordinary.  Mouthfeel was above average but the carb was so intense it distracted as much as it lightened.  A nice standard but I feel the bar has been raised by followers. Does it deserve props? For sure, a trailblazer in introducing the world to the Trappist flavors. But I feel a bit more flavor intensity would make this on top of the pile once again (sacrilegious? No, sacreliscious!).",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

The appearance is probably my favorite aspect of this beer - it pours a cloudy/murky brown color that is quite hypnotizing to look at. The aroma is mainly a sweet/smokey/malty scent. Flavors are largely reminiscent of some standard Belgian yeasts with a strong sweet & roasty finish.

T: Bready, biscuity with some dark fruits like plums, raisins and licorice in the taste. I thought this had very similar flavors than the Chimay Red, but they are exaggerated and very bold in the Blue.  M: Well carbonated with that Belgian yeast characteristics in the finish. Alcohol presence is a little more detectable here than in the Red.  D: This is a great sipping beer to have buy a fire, although the big alcohol presence might want me to limit to one glass.

The taste is complex with a fruity malt sweetness that is balanced by the yeast and some finishing spiciness. There is a hint of noticeable alcohol and a minimal cinnamon hit.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a initially biting (almost distracting) carbonation. It still leaves a clean and crisp feeling with a velvety texture at the end.

A gorgeous beer to look at, with hints of amber... guess I could stop staring at it and start drinking it.  This beer has a very distinct aroma -- lots of malt and toastiness, with a hint of mustiness that, rather than finishing up as is typical, dances around the edge of the nose the whole time. A wonderful aroma. The taste mirrors; nuttiness and spice mixed with the malt. There's also a strong hints of raisins on the end, and again the mustiness is there throughout.  I have to admit that the beer was a little too carbonated for my liking; that might be the glass's fault, though... but I've had enough Chimay Blue in my days to think that it's more of a bottling issue than anything else.

215,2512,hayesez,4.05,"Found the big bottle of Blue in my sister-in-law's fridge on a recent vacation. Turns out she picked it up just for our visit. The Blue Label has always been my favorite of the Chimays, but I've never ranked it. After splitting this one with myself tonight, figured it was about time to toss up a review.  Poured into a large wine glass...several times. Pours a hazy dark brown that glows a burnt orange near the glass when held up to the light. A nice tan one-inch soft frothy head forms quickly, but disappears nearly as fast before settling to a ring of fizzy foam. A fair amount of carbonation is seen in this medium bodied brew. As expected, no lacing left on the side.  Smells yeasty, in a good way. A deep smell exposes the fairly obvious 9.0% alcohol. Sweet, fruity. Smells like some sort of raisin cake soaked in a stiff rum. I like the smell, but wish the alcohol sting was just a bit less. Still, a very nice aroma.  The yeasty thickness is just as present on the palate as it is on the nose. Sweet and bold, this is a very nice beer. Not one of my favorites of the style, but certainly a quality brew. The dark fruitiness is definitely there, although I'm not sure I can discern it to be raisins, like the smell indicated. The alcohol is not quite as evident as one might think after taking a deep sniff, but it is still there as well. I've never had the Blue, or any of the Chimays for that matter, with a bit of age on them, but I suspect that this one would only improve.  Overall, I'm pleased with the Grande Reserve. It's not a beer that I purchase very often, but I won't pass it up when offered.

I think I've had this one aging for over a year now so that could explain the somewhat thin head.  S - Toffee and currrants. Blackberries and toast. Slight vinegar notes mixed with a ton of dried fruit.  T - Took me awhile to realize what I was tasting that was so distinct. It tastes like saba, the mediterranean cooked grape juice reduction. There's also a bit of spice from the yeast. Again echoes notes of a great balsamic vinegar. Perfect warming alcohol kiss in the finish.  M - Super dry and crisp. Medium viscosity but still a lot of carbonation. I think a year really did a lot for the dryness and I'm happy to see it is still very well carbonated.

There's a steady stream of bubbles flowing up from the center of the Chimay glass.  It has a strong yeasty aroma with a little fruity spiciness. Some sweet bready and toasted malts.  It has a very spicy yeast flavor with lots of fruity esters and peppery alcohol. There's also plenty of sweet bready and toasted malt and hint of caramel. The flavor is very rich and complex. Really a great tasting beer.  It's medium to full body with pretty full mouthfeel. Very high carbonation with lots of prickly fizz. I get a nice warming sensation and it's fairly dry.  This one is a sipper for sure with the high alcohol and fizzy carbonation. A very flavorful, complex beer. Really great beer.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

A little bit of sediment floating on top and throughout the beer. Minimal lacing.  Smell: Nice malty sweetness with strong notes of dried fruits.  Taste: Excellent blend of malt and dried fruits. Light hints of alcohol at the finish. Nice dried fruit aftertaste. Absolutely delicious.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with a decent amount of carbonation up front. Fairly dry finish.  Drinkability: Excellent drinkability. This is one to be enjoyed slowly. The high ABV is masked by the delicious flavor so this one could sneak up on you.

215,2512,Jesstyr,3.68,"This is my favorite style brew, and I've enjoyed many a bottle of Chimay, but for some reason I've never fallen in love with the Blue. I actually planned to review this a month or so ago, but when I had it it just wasn't as good as I had hoped - something I attributed to bad tastebuds that evening.  Appearance is great - pours a deep ruby amber with subtle haziness. Head is perfect, 2 cm, and lingers the entire drink with excellent lacing. Nose is strong and yeasty, good balance of raisin and an earthiness with subtle floral aspects.  Taste is good, just not tremendous. Overwhelmingly malty, so much so that it overpowers the subtleties that exist - with some floral and dark fruitiness. Too much carbonation that lingers with a dryness that isnt beneficial to the experience. Closes nicely, without any alcohol burn, but it is quite dry and not really conducive to multiple drinks.  I really like this beer, but would go elsewhere for the best of the Belgian Strong Dark Ales...",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,Pahn,4.58,"750ml bottle into Chimay chalice (why not?). Bottled June, 2008 according to the cork (it's March 2010 now if you can't read the posted on date of the review).  Chimay Blue was actually my eye-opener craft beer. I've neglected it for several years (if I get Chimay, I go for Chimay White personally). Time to go back and see if my ""beginner's palate"" missed anything.  Appearance: Moderate pour yields a half inch, fizzy and pillowy off-white head that dissipates slowly into an active, bubbling mound in the middle and around the surface of the beer. Neither head nor the beer leave much lacing. Pours a deep, deep ruby that's almost opaque, with visible bubbles rising in the middle and some sediment floating around even in the first glass.  Smell: Belgian yeast, raisin, plum, grape, clove, some floral character, and a tiny hint of earthy funk. Aroma shifts more towards woodsy grassiness and grape as the beer warms.  Taste: first sip: deliciously deep rush of sweet raisin and plum, transitioning to a big note of Belgian yeast, then moving to a deepening of flavor too big and fast for me to keep up and identify it all. Overall impression is that it's fruity, spicy and smooth. Finishes a little dry, with some warming alcohol present from early on in the glass. There's a smooth, almost chewy hit of roasted malt like a good stout in the transition from the huge carbonation in the middle to the slightly bitter end. Chocolate notes come out as the beer warms.  All the elements from the nose are present in the beer, along with dozens of other random good flavors lurking around and popping up from sip to sip. While each sip is different, each sip is also balanced. Sometimes it's a complex rush of equally strong dark fruit notes and clove, sometimes it's just straight plum to Belgian yeast to roasted malt, but the flavors are always harmonious and complement each other.  Mouthfeel: A beautiful, medium-bodied combo of creamy and juicy. Very carbonated.  Drinkability: Great beer to sit down and savor. I'd imagine it pairs well with some Chimay cheese. Alcohol is present but not overpowering, though it doesn't really matter; 1 350ml or 750ml bottle is enough.  My last impression of Chimay Blue before I stopped drinking it was ""Annoying, way too fruity, overcarbonated mess."" I guess I have changed a bit since then, because Chimay Blue is world class. I think the carbonation, dryness, and deep dark flavors were probably a bit too much for me when I first started getting into beer. Whether I've changed or misremembered or whatever, I love it now. It's one of those all too few beers that gives you some crazy, novel combination of flavors in every sip, each one interesting, palate-pleasing, and satisfying--with real *character* in all 4 of the objective BA rating categories. It's probably time to put Chimay back into regular rotation for me.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,zoso1967,4.2,"Pours dark slightly orange brown with a nice ecru head, not much lacing. The smell is spicy and full of currant and dried black sweet cherry aroma. It also has a sort of savory note that I am having a hard time placing. Taste is very similar to aroma with tons of dried dark fruit, some brandy character and herbal hop bitterness. This is definitely more sweet than bitter, but there is definitely a decent amount of dryness. The spice from the yeast is much less noticeable in the flavor. This beer seems to mask its alcohol content better than others of the style, though it is present. Mouthfeel is medium, but is lighter than I expected. Somewhat spikey carbonation kind of takes away from the mouthfeel, but the finish is quite nice. Drinkablilty is good for this style. A classic example of the style, and a solid Trappist style ale.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Pretty nice.  m - Medium body and low carbonation. Feels pretty good.  d - A very nice Belgian.

The body is reminiscent of the sweet liquor as a liquor slight but spicy in a nice way. Over time, it offers in its smells and tastes a texture close to the port (Maderisation) while keeping its keys spice.

Smooth dark fruity flavors, with a slight zing from the yeast and vinegar notes. Slight chocolate and caramel notes.  M: Highly carbonated. Not as much as the other Chimay's, but enough to draw away from the feel and drinkability. Taste lingers, but not for long.  D: As noted above, the carbonation fills you up. Very drinkable otherwise.

I taste a little celery. Very slight alcohol taste on tongue and palate. Mouthfeel: Slightly thin mouth feel. Drinkability: This is a 10% abv beer.

Taste: Has a solid malt character with lots of fruit flavor coming to the foreground. The fruit was ever so slightly overpowering, leaving with a bit of a sour/tart aftertaste. Very good, though.  Mouthfeel: Has a fair body from the carbonation, but it felt quite fizzy to me. Again, it seemed almost like a soda or champagne.  Drinkability: Excellent beer.

215,2512,Flashsp2,4.52,"Chimay Grand Reserve (blue) 750ml, roughly aged one year.  A moderate pour into a Duvel tulip generated a ginormous, fluffy, light beige head. Quickly dissipates to a moderate layer which provides some nice stick to the glass. Deep brown/red color which allows a bit of light penetration.  Aroma is big, juicy fruits, some malt sweetness, a light sharp/sour note. Some dark fruit and vinous notes as well. Alcohol spiciness is present as well, sort of underlying it all. Very yummy nose.  Taste is sweet, juicy in the middle, with some raisin/prune on the palette, sort of hiding behind it all. Alcohol provides some punchy spiciness, and gives warmth to the palette and face. Vinous taste abounds, and lingers through the end leaving a nice aftertaste. Some other flavors in there as well, so much going on it's hard to pinpoint everything down. Some yeasty flavors, maybe some clove, and a faint bitter at the finish. Finish is almost drying, like cinnamon on the tongue type of dry.  Mouthfeel is very silky, not heavy or watery, but with a great balance. It just feels very lush and luxurious without feeling too full bodied.

215,2512,OnThenIn,4.39,"Appearance: Poured into a chimay glass with a finger of head. the color of the head is a slightly tan color, while the beer is a rich brown color.  Smell: The smell is pungent. There are a lot of dark fruits like plums and raisins in the nose, along with some alcohol notes. There is some malt sweetness.  Taste: Upfront this beer has a beautiful sweet dark fruits and peppery spices kinda flavor. Just really complex. There is a little bit of hop bitterness peaking through towards the end. There is a bit of a molasses sweetness that I usually associate with a beer like Old Foghorn.  Mouthfeel: This is a medium to full bodied beer with the carbonation being on the lighter side, giving it a barleywine-esque chewyness.  Drinkability: The heavyness makes it a slow drinking beer and the alcohol is more present than the 9% would have you believe, without giving a straight up alcohol taste (I mean there is a bit more burn than I would expect). Surprisingly, this alcohol characteristic goes great with the rest of the beer and I am really loving this beer.

The color is a deep and hazey amber, ambrosia, copper laden hue with strong bubbling.  Yeasty berry, sweet artisan Hawaiian roasted breads, candi sugar, and just enough hops to give this beverage a Belgian beer aroma and not mead.  The taste starts sweet toasted nuts with overwhelming almost roasted sweet bread sprinkled with candi sugar. The middle of the palate is a sweet caramelized fruit, from the yeast and roasted malt combo. But the finish slows things down just a little with some light pine notes from the hops... very light. The feel of this beer is well carbonated cola syrup. But this feeling is not overbearing, but seems to suit this beer quite well.  This beer is a great sipper and would go well with any properly cooked red meat centric meal with a nice brownish sauce of sorts. Or by itself as a nightcap is just fine by me.  This beer is one of the foundations of Belgian brewing.

215,2512,eat,4.02,"The last 330ml bottle from the set of three I bought, which came with this nice Chimay goblet. I have to admit that I was ignorant to the quality of Chimay before I bought that three-pack and will no doubt be filling the goblet with lots more Chimay in the future. I really enjoyed the Red and White.  Chimay Blue pours a cloudy mahogany and ends up with a hazy covering of beige head. Not much retention of lacing.  Big, complex nose. Very bready, Belgian yeast, spices, minerals, oranges, prunes, toffee. Fantastic. The strength recedes in proportion to the head, leaving some room for a little more presence.  The first quality I notice in the taste is apples. Lots of fresh apple juice/apple cider. Quite sweet, though not cloying. There's a drying bitterness to the finish that almost balances it out (not quite though). Some subdued spice. I don't find the flavour to be nearly as complex as the smell, unfortunately. The 9% ABV isn't exactly hiding, making it clear that this is indeed a strong Belgian ale, both in the mouth and on the finish. Apples and alcohol mostly.  The three Chimay's should be looked to as models of good feel for anyone brewing beer. Whatever they do over there to get a feel like this...they definitely know what they're doing in that respect. Creamy, full medium body. Foamy in the mouth in the best way possible. Feels like you're drinking liquid velvet.  I was really looking forward to this one, saving it for last of the three I had. But it's easily my least favorite! Strange. I think this is actually why I didn't check out Chimay for so long: a friend recommended the Blue a while back and I wasn't too impressed. In my opinion the other two are better brews (maybe I'm strange). A well-made and drinkable beer, but if I'm going to be drinking Chimay, I'll take a Red or White any day over the Blue.

Very, very pleasing smell, I must say.  T: This beer isn't quite as big as I expected it to be, but it's excellent nonetheless. If there's one thing the belgians are good at, it's making an extremely flatline, homogeneous beer with high complexity, and this beer is no slouch. You'll want to keep tasting it over and over just to see what else you can pick up. You can bet I regretted getting the smaller size.  M: High, almost Duvel-level of carbonation. Not my favorite feature but the beer is extremely crisp and fresh.  D: This is one of the most drinkable beers I've ever had, and it's a 9%er. Unbelievable.

Planned on saving it for a while but ended up splitting it with my girlfriend late one night (Mistake. MOST women cannot appreciate a beer of this caliber. To those who can, I apologize).  This was my first experience with Chimay. Hell, it was my first BSDA. I'm a bit of a n00b. So I didn't have much to base the experience off of, but regardless, I was impressed.  Sweet bottle, complete with a cork at the top. I popped it off and prepared to enjoy.  Color was a sort of reddish-brown. As far as looks goes, it screamed high-quality. Huge, frothy head. A step above any beer I had enjoyed prior.  The smell was rather simple. I figured a whiff would tinge the nostrils a bit, but I only got subtle signs of toffee, and maybe some sort of fruitiness. I'm not exactly sure.  The taste, however, was a different story. So complicated. It was very sweet at first, but as it warmed it became much more complicated than that. Sweet, yes, but also a little bit of bite at the end. The alcohol hits the palate at the culmination of the taste. Tons of malt and hops, as I'd expected. A lot of different fruit flavors, and perhaps a hint of dark chocolate.  The carbonation in this beer was amazing. It felt soo good on my mouth. Its bubbles produced all a massaging effect, and they were fun to watch as they danced up and down in my chalice.  Despite the rather high alcohol content, the beer went down easily. I enjoyed every drop.  I wish I could drink beers like this more often. Alas, I am a poor college student, so these must be saved for special occasions and for trips home when Pops is buying.

Let me say right off the bat that this is an all time favourite. An absolute classic. This is the 2009.  Pours a reddy brown that can appear murky from the carbonation and occasional yeast sediment. (Am I alone in enjoying that yeast sediment flavour? Any vegemite loving Aussies with me?) Some effervescent bubbles rising from the bottom, top up an ample head that never dies and leaves amazing swathes of itself down the side of the glass.  The aroma is a delicious combination of lemon and orange rind from the yeast and malt, some dark sugar, more citrus and light oily hops.  What makes this beer a great in my opinion is its balance and complexity of flavour. Mild bubble gum sweetness of dark malts, big veal stock like yeast notes, some more citrus from the yeast, subtle dry hop oils, then finishes again mildly sweet, a touch sour and almost salty.  The body is just viscous and smooth, good mid-high levels of carbonation and with a light tang.I'm not ashamed to say I have had a few sessions on this beer .. (Mind you a session @ 9% doesn't amount to a lot of beer).  The scores that I've given here will sum to less than what I really think of this beer.

The beer settled the two cheeses down, exaggerated the juice of the pears, and accented the saltiness of the salame. Overall, the pairings were excellent!",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,dqrull,3.5,"2009  Pours a deep hazy brown with a two finger thick b eige head, that leaves little to no lacing, bu t leaves great lid on the liquid.  Initially smells alot of belgian yeast esters, as the beer warms, plums, peaches and apples come forth, as well as a slight sweet note of melted sugar and chocolate.  Taste is slightly muted by yeast, as I have experienced with this beer earlier. Although I thought that I might have disturbed the yeast before drinking it, but this time I had it standing up, untouched for a week, that should be more than enough. But still, the yeast esters are slightly overpowering, and not very interesting in itself. Behind the yeast there are some light notes of fruits, spices and apple pie.  Mouthfeel is okay, but the carbonation is a little too much and in your face, otherwise okay.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,jrallen34,4.02,"I drank this from a 11 oz bottle into my Westvletern chalice.  The beer pours a medium brown, much lighter in the light, with a few yeast floaties. The head is light tan but rises only about a finger and is gone very quickly.  The aroma is medium, lots of sweet matls, caramel, dark fruits and candided sugar.  The taste starts pretty matly dark fruit and finishes with a bit of bitterness. The taste to me is a little flat and lacks the complexity of a lot of other beers.  The feel is ok a light on the light side with a boring finish.  Overall, a solid beer but to me the least of the trappists.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,Brabander,4.67,"This was one hell of a Chimay. I was surprised with this one after a had a disapointing Orval this week. A nice and very smooth beer which gives a nice broken white head. You can smell the quality of this beer. Drank it in my Westvleteren chalice. The alcohol is strong but very pleasant.  Drank this one again in 2011 and i must say that i am very impressed by this beer. I had a Westy 12 yesterday which was not as good as this one! The westy was fresh however and this one is three years old. Still, this is a very good trappist!!",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

There wasn't much head from this bottle -- I think it is just this particular bottle, though, usually, the head is a thin but nice creamy-ness.  S: Yeast, malt, and spices. I also smell a nut...maybe almond? Vanilla, sugar...  T: The alcohol is quite present, but it is very palatable for this particular beer -- it interacts very well with the malt and almond taste. And I taste...plums? The last flavor that hits is the yeast, which finishes the beer nicely.  M: Warm, full, and smooth. Perfect. I enjoy the slight burn that comes from the alcohol.  D: Wonderful. Great sipping beer.  One of my favorite, classic beers. Always a delight to have.  I am drinking it now while listening to Bach Partitas performed by Glen Gould.

Poured into my Chimay Goblet, it pours a deep rich brown color. Like a deeply stained oak. The head is a perfect size of about half an inch almost through the entire drinking of the beer. It is a nice tan color and leaves a decent amount of lacing.  It smells of all sorts of dark fruits and nuts and dark caramel. Some yeastyness is also present.  Taste is great. All the above flavors in a subtile way with a nice alcohol booziness that actually works for this beer.  Mouthfeel is on the higher end of the carbonation spectrum but it is good for the style.  Overall this is an amazing beer that all beer lovers should have on hand to drink every once in a while. I personally like it with a little age on it but this one is a newer bottle and is still great. This beer is a staple around my house.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

It's mahogany with a thin, cream colored head that fades quickly but is glad to come back around with a gentle swirl.  Fantastic aroma of plums, raisins, pecan pie, yeasty bread dough, and red ripe fruit.  Taste is malty, yeasty genius. Rich and silky with the alcohol perfectly hidden. Brilliant notes of figgy dried fruits, bready and doughy caramel all caressing each other in a perfect way. Velvety body and drinkable isn't the word for it.  World class doesn't do it justice.

A- Hazy deep ruby brown, bubbles dancing up the sides of the glass, nice 1 to 1 1/2 finger creamy head dissipates into a shallow ring, carbonation bulging through the center of the beer like magma from a volcano.  S- Tangly, toffee, dark juicy plums, earthy spiciness, lightest hint of caramel or burnt sugar.  T- Beautiful tangy sweetness, grape fruitiness, no trace of alcohol until it warms for a while.

Taste is very smooth with chocolate predominance along with caramel malt. Not too sweet though, rather quite dry throughout. No bitterness at all. Finishes with a dry yeast spiciness, with a slight touch of alcohol.  Medium body with a creamy, almost thick or viscous feel. A solid beer overall.

215,2512,SpeedwayJim,3.85,"Thanks to Schen9303 for this one. Poured from a 11.2oz. bottle into a Ithaca tulip.  A: Gentle pour (so as to not disturb the yeast) yields a supple, 2.5 finger light cream colored, semi-fine, fluffy head with moderate retention. Beer is a cloudy reddish clay, mahogany. Lacing rises up nicely but dissipates just as quickly.  S: Grape juice, ripe prunes, spicy yeastiness, hint of booze.  T: Opens spicy, ripe purple fruit (grapes, prunes). Middle is slightly tart, boozy, signature Belgian yeast flavor. Hint of cloves. Finish is very clean with a bit of grape flavor almost as an afterthought. Malt character absolutely dominates here as is expected and there's no hop presence to be found.  M: Light to medium bodied, lively, carbonated, watery. Doesn't leave much. Finish is very clean with near no aftertaste. A bit boozy at points but never overly so.  D: A good, solid beer, but completely over-rated. I'd rather have any BSDA from Unibroue. I just don't really see anything special going on here. Complexity is present but its very plain (perhaps because its the original?). Mouthfeel sets a standard though. Very carbonated and watery. Goes down easily but also allows me to enjoy the flavor.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

The aroma is subtle, with a sweet, yeasty character and an undertone of alcohol. The flavor is both fruity and earthy, with notes of raisins, dried cherries, and other dark dried fruits, and a biting combination of yeast and spice. Highly effervescent like its little brother (Première) and a bit thin in the mouth, but still creamy and smooth nonetheless. At 9% alcohol and with a hint of alcohol in the nose, I was afraid of the booze taking over, but this one is warming without being harsh.

I've had this before and I know there was lacing then...  Smell is a little jammy - apricot and raisins, a hint of the alcohol. A little clove, some banana esters, and a fair helping of yeast rounds it out.  Slightly sweet, prunes up front. A little bit of sticky sweet raisin, then the full yeast flavors. Well balanced, but not immensely complex. Hints of sugar plum, banana, and allspice, but nothing palate-blowing.  Carbonation is fine, creates a clean beer that is easy to drink. Not my favorite Belgian, or Abbey Ale for that matter..., but a very fine quality one. Enough complexity to warrant aging if you're a fan. Would go well with roasted meats, or a heavy steak and potatoes meal. Or, it's fine to drink on it's own.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

A truly decadent beer with great complexity and character. Smooth and robust with the taste of dark fruits and candy sugar that also includes the traditional Belgian yeast strain. Moderate malt finish that leaves one wanting another sip.  M: Smooth and rich, with solid carbonation. The pinnacle of a Belgian strong dark ale.

Poured a deep chocolate walnut brown with almond fringes and an almond head that disappeared quickly after a vigorous pour. Almost no lacing as you drink this beer - that way you know it's a thick hearty man beer for champions and beer lovers alike.  This beer smells wonderful even as you pour it - scents of dried grapes, figs, chocolate malt, and cherries waft into your nostrils. Such a robust and fervent smell that I can only say smells like beer heaven.  The taste is much the same. As you let it warm even more flavors come out: a certain figgish prunish grapish quality comes through with warm alcohol hitting your tongue on the way down.

I dont pick up on the yeast like their other beers, but there is a slight hint of bread.  T- Not as complex as the smell, sweet and sour all at once, just a hint of alcohol, the sweet dried fruits come through in the finish/aftertaste, with a hint of caramel, bread when it warms.  M- A little thin to support the flavor. Too much carbonation not enough body. Not bad by any means though.  D- Hell yes its drinkable and will only get better with some time on it. The alcohol is well hidden with just a little bit of a bite on the way down.  Its better in the 750ml bottle for sure.

Pours a cloudy dark brown color with a well-formed, well-retained off-white head and good lacing.  Aroma is amazing. Lots of dark fruits, sweet malt, candi sugar, spices, and Belgian yeast.  Flavor is also awesome. Dark fruits dominate - raisins, dates, figs, and slight vinous notes, as well as some banana. Lots of spices present, almost like an awesome winter warmer. The beer is fairly sweet but not overly so. Caramel malt and candi sugar in there as well, along with Belgian yeast. Really, really complex. This beer also ages incredibly well, so if you get the chance to lay one down for a few years, do it. After a few years, flavor and aroma go up to a 5.0 rating.  Smooth and creamy on the palate with medium-full body and some nice alcoholic warmth without any booziness.  Drinkability is good.

The beer pored a brown, cloudy colour with a thick cream coloured head that displayed good retention for a bottled beer.  The nose immediately hit a scent of strong ripe berries, bitter sweet in one. Slight hint of barely but not a very complex scent.  The beer has an initially malty taste, with a slight sweet hit, this becomes slightly bitter with a fruity concoction of citrus and berries. Not too overpowering, very pleasant indeed. The medium - heavy mouthfeel is perfect for this type of beer.  This beer is just about perfect, so why the 3? At 9% there is no way that you could drink this all night, very nice indeed, but not one to finish the case off in the same night.

Wonderful spicy flavor with strong but not overpowering or alcohol taste! This would be a great winter warmer beer!!!  Lots of alcohol but very drinkable with good mouth feel. I like this! And will drink it again on a cold snowy night. WATCH out this is very drinkable but STRONG! Be warned :) What a great beer just perfect for cold nights. MUST BE DRANK AT THE CORRECT TEMPERATURE and the older the better! :) Also drink from the proper glass!  An incredible beer that has become one of my all time favorites.

215,2512,drabmuh,4.47,"Poured from a bottle into a Chimay Goblet. I have to say before I get too far into it that this was my favorite of the three Chimays. I thought the red was going to be the best but this one was. I did not record the date but I'll assume it was a recent vintage.  Beer is brown with an offwhite / yellowish head made up of small bubbles that are collapsing slowly into one another into a medium and larger bubbles. Head has some good retention power, fueled by steady carbonation of small to medium bubbles that rise through the beer. Beer is ultimately hazy and the head leaves lacing on the sides of the glass.  Beer's aroma is sweet and bready. Good yeast character to it. I intentionally served the beer with some of the sediment, it didn't affect the clarity but I like a little yeast with my Belgians. Smells wonderful.  Beer is medium to full bodied. Sweet fruit flavors and some alcohol light up the front of the palate, beer is smooth leaving no aftertaste or anything. Second taste I pick up more yeasty character and a good breadiness. Mouthfeel is amazing, the carbonation is providing good connectivity and drinkability is really high. I absolutely slay this beer before I know it. I'm glad this is one of the more accessible Trappists, its a wonderful beer.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Fruity and slightly floral, with not much in the way of hops. Reminds me a bit of apples and prunes.  The taste was surprisingly fruity, with a rather nice malty finish. Surprisingly easy to drink, and not as malty as I would have thought from the look of the beer. From the taste, this is something that a non-beer-drinker could enjoy, due to it's mildness. I didn't really taste the alcohol as much, but felt it in my belly after a few sips.  Mouthfeel is fairly even and understated for a beer of this type. Not too thick, high carbonation mellows out after the pour.  Drinkability is high with this one. This beer is an example of ""don't judge a book by its cover."" The huge bottle and impressively dark colors seemed to promise something a bit harder to handle, not as sweet, not as subtle as this, but the smells and taste will surprise you.

215,2512,Chronofied,4.67,"Drank slightly chilled, about 50 degrees, from a goblet.  Appearance - Rather murky, with a distinctly darker center, mahogany in color. The edges are a dusty amber. Very royal thick, frothy head.  Smell - Quite malty, but peppery rather than sweet. A rough, rich, toasty aroma of yeast.  Taste - A snappy, unexpected dark fruit taste right away, sweeter than the smell. The after taste is much less sweet and has a bit of alcohol heat. The heat leaves warmth in its wake rather than reducing the drinkability. Flavor only improved in richness and complexity as the beer opened up and got a bit warmer.  Mouthfeel - Slightly thicker, syrupy, decent carbonation. Sticks to the inside of you mouth.  Drinkability - Pretty drinkable, pretty recognizable. The thickness makes it quite filling, so drinking a lot might get uncomfortable. It is definitely very easy going down, and quite gratifying when it does.

This lacing accentuates the dark, ruby-brown ale with no highlights, but does put up a thin film.  The aroma is alluring immediately upon opening of the bottle with rich, fruity plum and a punch of musty yeast followed by clove, vanilla, molasses, oak and various nuances on multiple layers. This strong, dark ale delivers with each step as it continuously unfolds.  As with the nose, there is tremendous complexity ranging from raisins to plums. This is less sweet than anticipated, and woody notes come forward in the finish with a hint of hop bitterness. As it warms, the true subtlety of this elixir can be appreciated.  A dry, full-bodied ale with a quick bite of alcohol and ever present prickly carbonation.  This is an excellent sipping beer.

215,2512,jeffthecheff,4.36,"Poured from a 33 cl bottle into the Chimay Goblet. L09-493 seems to be some the date code. I couldn't find any information on it but I'm guessing this is the 49th week of 2009, (12/3/09) so its very fresh.  The pour into the Chimay goblet is beautiful. It has a murky, dark brown color with red highlights when held to the light. The Trappist logo etched on to the bottom of the glass produces a rapid stream of bubbles. The head is a very light tan color and is one of the fluffiest I've ever seen. It coats the glass, and even with the wide surface area, you can never see through the head if your looking from the top.  The aroma is fruity, but not very dark despite it's appearance. It smells like orange peel and cloves, but with enough strength to suggest this yeast worked on a big beer.  There is a lot going on in the taste of this beer. I picked up figs, green tea leaves, cola, a bit of orange, and burnt brown sugar. Finish a new flavor that is sweet and lingering. The mouthfeel on this beer is very interesting. It's creamy and robust at first, because every sip starts with the fluffy head. In the middle part of the sip, it's bubbly, dry, and light. The finish is also light but it carries the strong lingering sweetness anyway.  This beer drinks very well. I was looking at the bottom of the goblet a lot quicker than expected. Even though this is a strong beer, it's not very rich and it's not a slow sipper. It still has a high impact on the palate because of the strong flavors and sweetness, but it doesn't leave me full at all. I thought this beer was more like a quad and would be too much to pair with ordinary foods, but I think it might do well with a steak or some other meal of similar impact.

Golden tan head that dissipates quick and leaves little to no lacing. Spiciness is the first aroma noticed followed immediatley by the alcohol and the sweetness of the malts. Great flavors with the sweet malts and spicy tastes combined with the alcohol warming and tickling. Feel in the mouth is great with an abundance of carbonation and a clean slightly dry, though medium to full-bodied feel.

A: Pours a muddy red-brown color that lets very little light through. A nice foamy head disippated after about 10 minutes, leaving about 1/2 a finger of head primarily around the rim of the brew. Almost no lacing.  S: Roasty malts and dark fruits like raisins and plums. Hints of molasses and alcohol are also evident.  T: Follows nose pretty closely. Lots of sweet dark fruits and sweet malts. Alcohol is also pretty apparent to the point that it detracts from the flavor just a little. Overall, however, a tasty Belgian Dark.  M: A pretty full body with just a hint of dryness in the finish. There are definite warming effects from the alcohol as it goes down.  D: A solid Strong Dark Ale overall, but I like Maudite just a little more I think.

My old man bought me the Chimay variety pack that comes with an 11.2 fluid ounce bottle of Premiere, Tripel and Grande Reserve for my twenty-first birthday. Damn good gift.  A - Poured into a Snifter glass provided by the pack. Appears a burnt red that turns slightly orange towards the bottom.  S - The fruits are most prevalent - plum being the primary. Also a brief sense of clove.  T - May be the most complex experience my taste buds have ever taken on. A multitude of sweet fruits and spices - once again the clove and dark fruits being most prevalent. The alcohol doesn't make an appearance until a little after.  M - Extremely creamy and heavy that is assisted by a modest amount of carbonation. Very pleasing and not overbearing at all.  D - Definitely fills up fast - for me at least. I would have another in an instant if I could.  The Grande Reserve is simply incredible.

215,2512,Yoonisaykul,3.96,"750 ml caged and corked brown bottle with blue label. Best before 2014. Very nice cork comes out with a satisfying pop and let's out some nice ''beer smoke'' and kind of tootsie roll like smell. Poured into Jacobsen snifter. Was going to use my Brassin D'Hiver tulip but the back label shows a chalice and so I thought my snifter is a closer match.  L-Very active light-beige head with bubbles of different sizes settles into a 2mm creamy foam. The brew is a very dark brown similar to filter coffee. Almost opaque. When poured looked syrupy but it really isn't that viscous.  S-Dried fruit maybe figs, Yeast, A little tootsie roll, A little salt. Miniscule bit of vinegar but don't let that put you off. Strangely I smell a bit of a fresh vegetable. Tiny bit of alcohol.  T- Starts sweet, Taste follows the smell except for the vegetable part. Cloves. Finishes a little metallic. As it warms, you taste more and more alcohol.  M-Great from the very first sip. Full mouth feel. Foams up a bit as you are about to swallow it. Warming feeling though alcohol taste isn't that strong. Although I wouldn't mind there being more, I think this beer might have a perfect level of carbonation.  D-Great drinkablity... once you taste take the first sip. I don't always feel like drinking one of these but once I start... terrific. I remember the first time I had one. I went to sleep still thinking about it, licking my lips (kind of) trying to remember the tastes and mouth feel.  A great experience. This may very well change, but this is one of my favorite beers, and I am more of a IPA/hops kind of guy. Taste this beer. Just make sure you don't need to be sober after.

Liquid is red when held to a lamp, but it's much murkier and imposing when moved out of direct light. The look of this Belgian classic is immediately recognizable and oft imitated.  First smells to hit your nose are a warm waft of alcohol, cherries, dates and other dark, bold fruits. Possesses a sweet, candied aroma that is certainly enchanting.  Flavors are complex; cherry, chamomile and nutmeg are the most prevalent. These tastes are accompanied by a strong alcoholic backbone and profound floral overtones. Conclusion packs a roasted quality as well, which adds a nice muskiness to the total package. A total mindblower!  Liquid coats the tongue like cognac or a smooth, sipping whiskey. It possesses a zippy tingle at the end, which adds pronunciation to the dry notes.  This strong ale is almost too drinkable.

Aroma - malty, earthy, brown sugar/caramel, peaches (?), slightly sour (which made me a bit nervous), cherries, apples and raisins. Lots of smells to take in.  Taste - sweet brown sugar, toffee, earthy and mossy. This beer has aged better than I expected. Its slightly oxidized but that does not take away from all the flavors. Its got plenty of malty sweetness but also some yeasty flavors and a good amount of earthiness. Its slightly acidic and syrupy but not in a way that is off putting. Nice brown bread flavors as well. Its delicious and better than I hoped.  Overall - 11 years old and still amazing.

A cologne of this scent would be pleasant.  The taste. Wow. Full flavored and vibrant, it starts with a wonderful mix of plum, raisin, sugar, caramel, some toasty notes, and goes through a wonderful transition of tastes into a juicy, long finish of mild bitter, deep fruity essences, alcohol, and a light spiciness that leaves a bright clean flavor in the mouth. Marvelous flavor, extremely well balanced, blended, and complex.  Low carb, medium body, good cling, no cloying flavor here, pure clean flavor into an astoundingly good finish. Excellent in the mouth, a masterpiece.  Drinkability is off the charts for a BSDA. I fear if I had a cellar filled with this beer my sobriety would be limited to those few hours I sleep.

M.F.-Carbonation is high, wish it was a bit lower so I can experience the flavor a more, instead it just kind of gets pushed out of the way.

A- Chimay Blue pours with a lot of carbonation, the head foams up quickly. The beer is dark ruddy brown, sort of iced tea looking in color. The head did not last but a minute or two, and now has no foam on top whatsoever. No lacing, no nothing. I expected a longer lasting head and some lacing.  S- Mostly figs and alcohol, also a bit of pear.  T- Early on the Chimay Blue was very boozy, almost rum-like. Once the carbonaton settled down abd the beer had a few minutes t breathe, more flavors of fig nutmeg and molasses revealed themselves. Towards the end of the glass the malt shows itself more apparently.  M- Very carbonated, not my favorite sensation. I often like to retain the beer in my mouth for a moment and exhale through my nose, to bring some of the flavor up to the nasal receptors. With Chimay Blue I find I don't like keeping the beer in my mouth.  D- Overall, this is a nice ""change of pace"" beer.

All is forgiven as soon as I take a sip. Very treacly yet rounded flavors of sour cherries and sweet prunes and spice, like nutmeg and clove, with a dry peppery finish. Warming alcohol lingers a bit on the aftertaste. No hops that I can discern. An interesting melange of flavors working together harmoniously.  Highly carbonated with a bite that lets this beer down a little. Still, it went down easy. Too easy.

215,2512,mralphabet,4.42,"12 oz bottle poured into pint glass..  A: Reddish brow and foggy.... very nice 1 1/2 finger head that bubbles fervently and then died as quickly as it rose. No lacing at all.  S: A great mix here of dark fruit (cherries and raisins), brown sugar sweetness and some alcohol.  T: All the smells are here... Just a wonderful mix of all flavors.... With the alcohol I'm reminded of a very nice port... gets even better as it warms....  M: Mid bodied... a little thin at the start but thickens out as you go.  D: OK at 9% ABV you are not drinking a bunch of these... Sit back drink one of these wonderful beers and relax. Warms you up on a cool autumn night  Like all Chimay Beers this is a must try !!!",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,Fizzlybear,4.55,"L - Pours a misty dark brown, with a nice off white colouored head, that lasted.  S - The smell was very strong. I had bits of caramel and red berries, with a few spiced notes and a bit of herb.  T - A herb and malt taste was the first I picked up, with a hint of yeast thrown in too. This then turned into a sweet honey kind of aftertaste.  M&D - A very smooth beer that goes down nicely in hot and cold weather, the complex flavours make it great in the mouth and easy to drink.  Overall this is my favourite beer to date. I would score it 5's across the board but im adamant that there is a beer out there I will prefer!",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,sweemzander,4.63,"750mL corked bottle poured into a tulip glass. 02/09 printed on the cork.  (A)- Pours a dark purple to black hue with reddish highlights that produced an effervescent white to off-white bubbly & foamy head with great retention.  (S)- Dark berry fruits amidst some bananna & yeast characteristics. A twist of lemon.  (T)- Nice and velvety dark fruits with some lemon & banana thrown into the mix. Very fresh and crisp. Some yeasty clay funk that is always good yet offers and edge into the complex body.  (M)- Plenty of carbonation that almost fizzes to life on the tongue, but it fits the beer and its style well. Has a superb balance with all components yet is layered and complex within its simple yet broad flavors. Superb alcohol (9%) integration. Incredibly smooth; only gets better as it warms up a bit believe it or not.  (D)- I always look forward to drinking this fantastic beer. Also, because of that, I never manage to hang onto a bottle for very long. I look forward to the day of having an aged bottle of this. But anyway, Chimay Blue is a fantastic beer that is even better when enjoyed with a friend, I was feeling pretty good after drinking the whole bottle!",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,BBThunderbolt,4.53,"Poured into 10oz goblet. Poured that beautiful, deep, rich reddish brown that has come to be the standard for the style. The beer had a short tan head that dissipated quickly, leaving just wisps of lacing.  The aroma was rich and earthy, with the sweet fruit notes upfront and the solid malt foundation holding up the back. The flavors followed along but were even richer, fuller and more complex. There was a slight yeast taste mixed with the fruit flavors.  The body is full, smooth and substantial without being heavy. Drinkability is excellent, several of these went down very easy with a slice of rich chocolate cake while reading a book at one of local cafe's.  Overall, a standard of the style. A must try.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Pours a dark mahogeny with flecks of reddish brown, visible yeast in the bottle.  Has a sweet, fruity aroma, almost wine-like in the nose. Mild carbonation and a full, balanced and smooth taste.  Overall, a very enjoyable beer and a great representation of the syle, just wish I had the big bottle instead.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,seand,4.2,"Poured from an 11.2oz bottle.  A: Pours a dark, fairly opaque brown, with several fingers of foamy tan head. The head retains fairly well, but doesn't leave a great deal of lacing.  S: Earthy Belgian spices and a background of biting alcohol.  T: The Belgian spices are present, along with a mild sweetness. Finishes slightly astringent, but certainly not unpleasantly so.  M: Carbonation feels strong on the tip of the tongue, but finishes almost watery. Medium body.  D: Drinks easily enough, though watch out for the 9% ABV.  A pretty good example of the style; enjoyable, but I wouldn't call it outstanding.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,TLove,4.42,"(From Notes)  Without a doubt, one of the best of its kind.  Full, deep brown color with a yeast-laden 9% woosh of a smell that possesses scents of dark sugars, Norton grape, and majoram (east Indian spice). Has an uber-creamy, light brown head that settles slowly and patiently. Floral taste flows into a yeast-centric raisin and fig body with a clove punch and an incredibly round, estery mouthfeel that warms in the mouth as the malt matures.  Fruity, but in a fig sort of fruity way, with a round, peppery, malty, incredibly complex and balanced body that also possesses a certain nuttiness to it. Very smooth. Very round. The sugars and the 9% ABV hit hard even after only a few months out of the brewery.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,mightymoksha,4.87,"Served in oversized wine glass.  Pours a cloudy mahogany. A frothy, beige head retains well, lasting all the way down, leaving thick lacing every step of the way.  Nose is very complex, with pleasant aromas of cloves, raisins, pepper/spice, dates, green pears and fruity esters. Brown sugar, wood and alcohol aromas are also present, albeit more subdued.  Taste is heavenly. A huge dark fruit character steals the show at first taste, with fig, date and raisin notes being the most prominent. The flavor then assumes notes of plum, smooth cacao, clove, brown sugar and a very faint cinnamon. Finish is beautiful, a slightly dry, slightly spicy velvety sweetness. As the beer warms, multiply this by 5.  The carbonation and high alcohol content tingle the palate, wonderfully complimenting that velvety smoothness referenced above. Swishing some around creates a decadent treat for the tongue.  Despite the high alcohol, it is quite drinkable. The alcohol, while present, is very elusive, making the temptation for another glass even more difficult to resist.  This is beer.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,corby112,4.7,"Pours a cloudy dark chocolate chestnut brown with dark amber edges when held to a light source and a thick frothy, pillowy light tan head. Excellent retention, only slowly settling into a lasting cap that lasts throughout, leaving chunks of soapy lacing in it's path.  Slightly spicy peppery aroma with a lot of sweet estery Belgian yeast, chocolate, candy sugar and dark fruits; plum, raisin, prune, fig, etc.  Soft carbonation up front that subdues a bit when the beer warms. Lots of sweet dark fruit character with hints of fige, prune, raisin and plum as well as some silky chocolate and caramel. Very faint sour presence with some pleasant spiciness. There's some cinnamon, brown sugar and candy sugar that provides an excellent balance and complexity to this amazing beer. The alcohol presence is there but the high ABV is very well masked making it dangerously drinkable. One of my all time favorites.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,donniecuffs,4.17,"Into a chalice, poured a deep dark brown, with two fingers of mocha-colored head and very good lacing. The aroma was a beautiful mix of tart cherry, plum, raisin, oak, clove, coriander, biscuit, and yeast. The flavor revealed all of the above in copious amounts, however the alcohol wasn't very well masked, and the after-burn was a little too much. Nicely smooth and surprisingly carbonated for a thick beer.

215,2512,Whiteweasel,4.52,"Oh the anticipation...my adventures in craft beer have finally taken a giant leap with my first Belgian Trappist ale. This bottle has been sitting in my cabinet for weeks, just waiting for the right time to be enjoyed.  Poured into a wide mouthed wine glass/goblet from a bottle bought in Sept 09 with 09/08 marked on the cork. Enjoyed this momentous occasion with my roommate and fellow advocate Heissebier  Appearance: Absolutely gorgeous. Beautiful brown colour, almost opaque from all the sediment. Head was small, but this might have been from the serving temperature. It is very persistant however, and it mixes around on the surface which only whets my appetite even further.  Smell: At first the scent could only be described as ""ohmygod""... However after a little thought, a very warm, sweet fruity and floral aroma, with something almost like pepper. Very estery with traditional ale banana and clove scents, only even better. There really is something almost indescribable about this scent. Transports me  Taste: Such a complex taste, this is going to be difficult...Definitely exhibits the traditional characters of the ale, a banana/clove taste, but also has something of a grape or red wine element to it that I've never really experienced before. It has a distinctive nuttiness to it probably from the yeast that Chimay uses. Fantastic finish; its so smooth and pleasant. The aftertaste is malty and wheaty and very sweet but not in an overdone sort of way. Absolutely incredible taste, and certainly the best beer I've had to this point  Mouthfeel: You can certainly feel the alcoholic content in this beer, and it leaves you a mild boozy warmth in your mouth and down your throat. Very nice level of carbonation which tingles in your mouth and compliments the booziness  Drinkability: I would drink this every day if I could. Hell, I would take a vow of silence and become a trappist monk if I could drink this every day. It's just that good. However the only thing that I hold against this beer is that it is 9% abv, and unless you have a friend with you, the bottle practically begs to be drank all at once, leaving you potentially giddy from something else besides the deliciousness of the Chimay.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Appearance- Rich hazy color with a caramel colored head. Smell- Incredibly complex. Lots of sweet floral scents with hints of pepper and malt.  Taste- The only way to truly appreciate the taste of this world class beer is to try it for yourself. Good carbonation with a melody of flavors and a sweet, fruity finish. As the beer warms up the flavor really comes out.  Mouthfeel- Orgasmic. Rich and complex without being overbearing.  Drinkability- A beer to savor, a little bit goes a long way. This beer has incredible staying power and the flavor continues to develop long after each sip. That being said, I could drink it all day every day.

M: A medium-full body brew with a fizzy carbonation that fades to a slightly off-dry  Overall, This beer is a great classic. It's an easy drinker that is also complex and sophisticated. The abv is hidden well, or else covered up by rich flavor. The flavors become more pronounced as it warms, but this beer is best right out of the fridge in my opinion.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,zoso493,4.33,"Poured from a 330 ml bottle into my Chimay chalice  Appearance: Pours a deep mahogany color with a fluffy one-finger head.  Smell: Smells of yeast and malts with some dark fruit mixed in there. Maybe some dates, raisins and apple. Also just a touch of toffee and brown sugar.  Taste: The dark fruit again come out with a big malty presence up front. Finishes with a wonderful sharp, dry burst of Belgian yeast. This is pretty tasty.  Mouthfeel: Almost perfect, for me. Full-bodied and just a pleasure to drink.  Drinkability: You'd never guess this was 9% ABV. Pretty drinkable for what it is, though.

215,2512,Wisconsinality,4.42,"Poured from an 11.2 oz bottle into a Chimay chalice.  A- Pours a nice deep brown that is a little cloudy(I am one who likes the sediment in the glass) and about a finger and a half of head that recedes somewhat quick but leaves a good lacing. S- A nice whiff gets me some malt along with some dates and raisins. Also maybe a little bit of the yeast and just a hint of the alcohol. T- The Grande Reserve is like many of the style, the taste really comes through when it warms up a little bit. Raisins, dates, some brown sugar. The yeast is barely noticeable along with the alcohol. M- This is a medium bodied beer but I would have preferred it to be a little heavier. It has the right amount of carbonation that makes this one smooth beer. D- This one goes down very smooth and and could have a couple in a sitting if not for the higher abv.

215,2512,DefenCorps,4.05,"Two years back when my friend bought me a Chimay gift-pack for passing my PhD qualifiers, I stashed the blue away until today. Why? I don't know.  Decanted into my Chimay chalice, this beer is quite the looker. Deep crimson, sanguine almost, with a dense off-white head that recedes to a disk quickly. Great clarity, and plenty of carbonation is present.  The nose is great, with a lot of dark fruit complexity - figs, plums and dates- as well as brown sugar and a little molasses. Bready with the smell of fresh-baked raisin bread as well as some yeast. A touch of oxidation has crept in, lending a little cardboard to the nose. Spicy alcohol is noticeable as it warms up. All told, very very good  Opens big and fruity with plums, raisins and figs as well as a deep and rich bready character, with a mild caramel sweetness. There's a combination of caramel and nougat in here, as well as a rum-like sweetness. Quite deep in flavor. Medium in body with a fabulous, lush carbonation, this is a treat on the palate. A touch sweeter on the finish than I'd like, this beer doesn't really have a long lasting finish like I prefer. Alcohol appears, adding a spicy note. Thoroughly drinkable and enjoyable, this bottle is going down, no problems  **Edit 02 Jan 2013** 750ml bottle, 2007 vintage.  No oxidation, no noticeable alcohol, refined, integrated palate and nose. The mouthfeel is also better - soft and supple, with a medium-high carbonation that doesn't distract. The flavor and nose is driven by fruity notes up front, with a mild spice character, reserved yeast, buckwheat honey, some brown sugar. Age has really integrated alcohol into the flavor profile, it's wonderfully hidden.

Body is hazy and dark maroon, with lots of carbonation rising from the shield emblem etched into the bottom of the glass.  Smell: Sweet toffee and dark fruit, belgian yeast funk. Bubblegum and strawberries. Smells good.  Taste: Sharp and tangy, orange and grapefruit are immediately present, somewhat sour and funky. Alcohol provides a sharpness. Slightly drier, vinous flavors finish. Somewhat raw, could be laid down to mellow for, oh, a decade.  Mouthfeel: Alcohol is strong and provides a warming sensation. Full and goes down slick.

It is not my favorite BSDA, but very enjoyable nonetheless.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,mdwalsh,4.3,"200eight bottle  A: reddish brown and hazy, very little light gets through it. There's a one finger beige head that slips away leaving just a little lace. There's a little active carbonation, not much. It looks sort of dull, I wish it were somehow sharper.  S: It initially filled the air with its Belgiany Beery goodness when I popped the cork, but now I find it rather weak. I get some light fruityness, malt and a little bready yeast. No hops. There is a lot going on there in small quantities and it gives the Grand Reserve a sort of unique smell. Some mouth breathing and retro-olfactory sensing gives me a pretty solid vanillin smell.  T: Much stronger. Very fruity with hints of cherry, cranberry, maybe some mellon and banana and more darker, cooked fruits. There is also something I would call a nuttiness, but not a dry, roasted nuttiness more of a raw, fresh nut taste. Again, no hops, and there's really no bitterness at all, nor is the alcohol at all detectable. It's very smooth and wine-like. Almost cola-like even with the carbonation. There's some vanilla/vanillin in there as well that becomes more pronounced as the beer warms.  M: Smooth, though the carbonation is a little high for something of this strength to me. Finishes clean and leaves the tongue completely, instead of lingering as a film like some beers do.  D: Very drinkable. A great beer to convert wine drinkers. It's big, so it must be drank slowly, but I think a bottle could last a person a night of good drinking, two or more people for a more casual event.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,PartyBear,4.58,"Poured from a fresh (2009, same year as tasting) slightly chilled 330ml bottle into a Chimay chalice.  Appearance: Dark oak brown, verging on black, with a small foamy tan head. Appears to be heavily carbonated.  Aroma: Rich sweet bready malts, yeasty notes, and lots of caramel and toffee notes. Fruity scent of banana, and apple. There is a clear grainy aroma from the malts.  Taste: The malts are abundant at the front, providing sweet toffees and a bready graininess. Definite banana flavours mixed in with a subtle caramel base. The aftertaste is has a sticky bitter quality.  Mouthfeel: The texture is oily, and smooth, with a nice substantial body.  Drinkability: One of my favourite trappist ales. Really well brewed ale, the mix of flavours is almost perfect, and the feel beautifully heavy and smooth for a trappist.

I dunno what it is, but these monks know how to brew and I never want to see the day this stuff isn't on the shelf.

215,2512,wl0307,4.35,"2008 vintage, BB 2013, served cool in Westmalle's broad-rimmed chalice.  A: pours a very dark brown hue clouded with yeasty bits, showing nice dark ruby glows when seen against light; the fizz level is made apparent by the hissing sound, pumping up a 1 cm thick beige foam that settles in good time to a thin cap. S: yeast perfume (fruit esters) is everywhere, mixed well with the notes of dark candy sugar and relatively light maltiness; a close sniff reveals the elements - sweetened Chinese red-bean paste, figs, plum preserve, bananas, sweetened black tea, and slightly salty sweetness as of exotic yeasts. Nice, but the complexity doesn't develop into different layers. T: the lightly effervescent swallow comes with nice & complex flavour, featuring mixed spicy-salty and bitter-sweet yeasty+malty elements, raisins, bitter orange, bitter licorice, burned dark sugar, lightly chewy hop bitterness, that develop well towards the rear of the palate. The finish, just like my previous encounters, comes slightly dry (pleasantly so) and semi-bitter, but still full of undertones as of spiced olives, red-bean paste, Chinese hawthorn fruit candy, and aromatic ""red sugar"" (NOT brown sugar). M&D: despite the light effervescence on the first several sips, the fizz level is tuned to perfection as the beer breathes, and the body remains as moderate as the flavour would prefer it to be. The estery flavour and sweetness endowed by the candy sugar are constantly in check by the necessary level of sourness and also nice bitter edge of flavours. All in all, this is a complex yet extremely approachable dark ale, and around 12 centigrade is just about right for a full enjoyment.  * Tasting Date: 18/08/06 This bottle is the ""2006 vintage"", as stated on the front label. BBE 2011, served lightly chilled in a large Burgundy bulb wine glass. 4.5 A: dark mahogany hue with bright ruby glows when seen against light; the creamy and tight frothy beige head, 2cm thick, sustains pretty well and leaves tight sheets of lacing as it retreats, against a pretty lively carbonated body... Simply elegant. 4.5 S: a semi-astringently yeasty and slightly sulphury note escapes from the bottle as soon as it's opened... in the glass, first approaching the nose is an almost hefe-weizen like fruit-estery note: ripe mangos, green bananas, sour-sweet orangey notes with a touch of Belgian hops that I remember Poppering Hommelbier by... attractive and not overly rich... against a background of deeper scent of caramel-(and Munich-?) malts, candy-sugar, raisins... and a light flow of warming alc. at the tail. Really enticing and harmoniously mixed, reminiscent of Westy 8, albeit with a more straight-forward fruity theme. 4.5 T: upfront on the palate is a flow of effervescent-textured, lightly sour-sweet dark malts backed by plenty of raisins, woodiness, bitter edges of caramel, semi-sweet dried citrus rind... coated by a semi-herbal (licorice), peppery, an attenuated ""rusty"" mouthfeel (like that of mixing Belgian dark ale with hard, full-fat cheese... try it and you'll know what I mean), and a slightly alcoholic middle that is in turn taken over by a spicy-dryish yeasty undertone, residual hops and creamy, raisiny malts. Surprisingly dryish finish, without any unpleasant sugary/sticky mouthfeel but a sour-yeasty edge does hover in the end. 4 M&4 D: the creamy-fizziness buttresses the whole flavour profile just fine... it's full-flavoured yet easy to manage on the palate; but somehow the texture falls a bit thin at the back and the yeastiness is slightly rough as well... I can't explain how, but the balance is slightly off, perhaps because this bottle is still too young? Nevertheless, I do enjoy it, esp. having not tried it for two years since my last trip to Belgium. Maybe I need to buy a couple to ""lay down"" for future tasting to see its full potential?",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

215,2512,AmberMan22,4.3,"I don't have proper glassware, nor immediate access to any to my knowledge. Poured from a 33cL bottle into an undersized glass.  The Chimay Bleue pours a hazy dark plummish-red, with a solid two finger head to it. The head is impressive in itself, with large bubbles at the base, working up to microscopic bubbles at the top of the head. Unfortunately it goes away far too quickly, with minimal retention or lacing.  The smell is impressive, in that it disguises the 9% ABV so well. Alcohol is still present, but mixed well with spices, darker fruits, yeasty undertones to support, and a wonderfully expressed maltiness.  The taste is immediately of a traditional trappiste style beer, but when left to linger in the mouth, the idea of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale comes immediately to mind. once the initial hop/fruit/alcohol blend drifts away, I am treated to a toasted maltiness.  The mouthfeel really does please the tongue. The carbonation is far from overwhelming, unlike most belgian beers that I've tried. It is a medium+ bodied beer, that as I said, feels incredible when allowing it to linger in the mouth.  Overall drinkability is only a 4 for me, because of the high ABV, and the sweetness of the fruity tones.

Pours a brilliant crimson red & cloudy with a massive suede head. Its beautiful to look at against the sunlight. Showed a lot of life, surprisingly for a big beer. Okay, the smell was dark and fruity all the way. A lot of damson and caramel, and reminded me of a walnut pudding. The head retained all the while so I had my first sip of Chimay thru it - massive to say the least. Dark fruits, mainly plums and caramel are in your face. A little tart feel remains prominent in between sips. Mouthfeel is solid and heavy with medium carbonation. I would keep it down to 1 bottle a go for the ABV, which by the way it hides very well.

The mouth feel it very bright lots of bubles almost like a warm soda... I served it at 63* F So it may be a little warm but I like my beers warm so oh well it is smoothing out now to due to the agitation of drinking it.

Tastes like plums and other dark fruit with some bready undertones. Nice mouthfeel slightly carbonated. Hides its 9% abv extremely well. Overall i will always have at least one of these on hand.

Sweet smell of bready malt, dark fruits, phenols, light cherry and a touch alcohol.  Biscuit, sweet malt, dark fruits followed by a kiss of cherry, some more pheonol and a dry alcoholic finish.

The taste is sweet, but carbonation (I know, not a taste), robbed me of my tongue. This one was medium bodied with a lot of carbonation left over from the head.

The head slowly recedes into a thin layer on top leaving thick lacing.  Smells of dark fruits - raisins mostly - with brown sugar and a clean aroma that is best described as a Belgian cellar.  Tastes very good. Brown sugar and other assorted spices follow dark fruit flavors and sweet malt. The spices gain steam midway through the sip before a clean and crisp ending.  Mouthfeel is great. It has a very nice and smooth thickness with active carbonation.  Drinkability is very good. I finished my bottle quickly and could have a few more.

This beer contains lots of wonderful aromas. I detect raisins, apples, hops, sugars, and alcohol. The aforementioned aromas do a good job of hiding the alcohol.

A - Dark mahogany, poured a finger and a half head that turned to a thin film halfway through (I admit though that I was using a Belgo Chalice and not the proper Chimay one which is wider). Not too much lacing.  S - Apples, candied fruits, and alcohol. All more subtle than I would have expected. EDIT - Aroma perked up as I drank this and by the end everyting was more prominent with the addition of some slightly tart cherries.  T - Dark roasted malt, candied figs, raisins and dates, a bit of alcohol. Very well balanced and very nice. Aftertaste is pleasant and a bit sour and fruity. Wonderful!  M - Perfect!

Followed by a slight sting of spice and clove on the tongue.A bit of a heavy boozy bite settles on the palate and warms the belly. Medium-full bodied with excellent carbonation. Nice and bubbley that sits on the palate alive and well.  Drink is a bit boozey really a bit to spicey for a good session beer. A definite taster.

Smell: apples and pears right off the bat. There's a nice crisp malt there which you might call a biscuit aroma, and below that a heady yeast aroma which just adds to the experience. It's great!  Taste: tree fruit and a bit of an alcohol bite, but there's also this muted chalkiness which adds an underlayer of flavors which meld together but which I can't really identify; perhaps the creamy mouthfeel is contributing to this chalk perception. It's very good though.  Mouthfeel: enticing creaminess I have come to expect from Chimay.  Drinkability: at 9%, the alcohol really starts to affect the drinkability of this.

Smells a bit like cloves to me, kind of Dunkle-ish. Its a heavy bodied beer, but it drinks extremely smooth. Its one of the most balanced beers I have ever had the privilege of drinking. There is a bit of chocolate flavor that comes through, and it tends to have a bit of an acidic tang on the finish.

The head started as large fizzing bubbles but has diminished to a smaller ring of off white miniscule bubbles. Very pleasing.  S: I pick up dark fruits on the nose, cherries especially and a very malty aroma. It has very nice spice notes as well and a very noticeable yeasty smell.  T: Taste is out of this world. Very malty and bready with a nice follow up of dark fruits and banana. The cloves and spices are evident towards the end. Very rich and luscious tasting, especially drinking it warmer.

Smell: Big-time yeast/bready aroma, cloves, ginger and potent alcohol for the most part. Sugary undertones. Characteristic Belgian ""hayfield"" aroma. Very nice. Do I detect a bit of juicy strawberry?  Taste: That weird strawberry inkling has followed here! Rich, and flavorful, with sugars and caramel dominant, spiciness of cloves and hits of ripe red fruit and citrus, then alcohol warmth.  Mouthfeel: Very soft! So nice! Rich and full in the mouth, smooth going down. Mild-medium carbonation just enough to excite the palate. To me, this is almost the perfect mouthfeel.  Drinkability is good, thanks to the pleasant honeyed aftertaste of the beer, the carbonation level and the smooth, smooth mouthfeel. Savour this beer, don't rush!  For me, the major challenger to this beer, in terms of beers that I can realistically drink often, would be Trois Pistoles from Unibroue, which is stellar in its own right.

This beer pours a very dark, murky, orange-brick brownish hue, with two fingers or so of thin, rather fizzy pale beige head, which leaves some stark coral reef lace around the glass as things sink away.  It smells of ripe dark bananas, pear syrup, fresh red plums, raisins, cloves, yeast, a rather candi-sugar informed caramel malt, and faint earthy, musty hops. The taste is more quite sugary caramelized, and somewhat bready malt, fairly spicy cloves, dusty yeast, muddled dark fruit smoothie, a hint of citrus, and a subtle nod towards warming alcohol.  The carbonation is decently sturdy, a wee frothiness kicking up at times, the body a pretty solid medium weight, smooth, and ethereally creamy. It finishes off-dry, the reserved malt and broadly sublimated fruitiness mostly countered by the lingering spice and floral notes.

Dark fruit--figs and dates--and some red fruit. Spices, mostly up front, and bready sweet malts throughout. A bit of molasses and alcohol on the back end. Smooth and boozy, lots of character.  Good drinkability and smooth mouthfeel for the style.  Chimay red on tap was one of my first craft beers, though it's taken me a long time to get around to grande reserve. Would like to catch this one on tap, as well, and it would probably make for an even better experience.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,gmfessen,4.25,"Poured from the bottle into the Chimay chalice, beer is a deep, murky brown color with an active, quickly fading, cream colored head. The smell is a mix of spicy yeast, slight fruitiness that reminds me of fruit punch and an alcohol sweetness. The taste starts of with the slightly sweet, dark fruity flavor that was present in the nose and transitions to a slightly bitter, dry, warming alcohol finish. Raisins and figs, slightly spicy. Complex yet simple and difficult to discribe. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a thin, whispy carbonation. Overall, a very drinkable beer that one would not expect the high ABV that is present in this beer. Drink with care.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

S- Yeastie sweet bread, malty, Dark Prune and raisins  T- Very sweet malt. Belgian spices followed by a deep dark fruity taste. Well rounded.  M- High carbonation. Finishes with a sweet fruit taste.  O- This is the beer that started me down the road to craft beer. It might not be the best Belgian Trappist beer out there, but it is quite good.

215,2512,petroos,4.44,"Had this at Anthos restaurant in NYC with a braised lamb shank. Served from a bottle into a tulip.  A: Pours a muddy brown with a tinge of red. Nearly transparent with some murk caused by carbonation. The relatively thin, tan head dissipates pretty quickly. There is very little lacing.  S: This smells wonderful. Chocolate, caramel, and tinges of red fruit and molasses. Alcohol comes through a bit.  T: Tastes very similar to the smell, with chocolately malt upfront followed by a sweet midpalate of red fruits. It reminded me a bit of an old painting of a fruit bowl, except imagine the fruit bowl was covered in molasses and caramel. Dark flavors of cherry, fig, and chocolate. The finish has great retention, and leaves the palette with a bit of a burnt caramel flavor. The alcohol is slightly apparent at the end but overall extremely well hidden. Really good.  M: Mouthfeel is heavenly. The sparse, fine carbonation perfectly balances the dark flavors, giving it a lightness that you wouldn't expect from the ABV and flavor profile. Nevertheless, the maltiness and ABV also lend a creamy counter point to the carbonation.  D: This is dangerously drinkable. At 9.00% ABV it's not even close to a session beer, but flavorwise it damn well could be. A sipper you can gulp.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Aroma is of caramel, raisins, soft spice, and fruit.  Taste is a blend of fairly sweet caramel, dark fruit, molasses, a touch of clove, and a dry cocoa powder finish. Finish is slightly tart. The 9% is pretty well hidden, though slightly noticeable in the finish. A pretty good Belgian.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,pants678,4.5,"Popped it open and it immediately spewed. A very cloudy amber with a head that doesn't retain. Sediments settled at the bottom of the glass. That may be due to the sporadic opening.  Smells of toffee and carmel. It's spicy, some cinnamon, gives the nose a little kick to it.  The taste is sharp and complex. There's a whole slew of mixtures to tantalize the tongue. There's fruit, plums, pears that go well with a carmel and brown sugar that, seemingly polar opposite, work in conjunction to soften the blow that could be overwhelming. The subtle chocolate and malts can smooth a brew, but instead of threatening to be boring or too close to a porter, but the sharper notes keep your tongue on its proverbial toes. It stains the tongue with a not too drying middle, and slightly convolutes the following sips. I like that.  The carbonation seems to be just right. It's a bubbly cushion that helps combine and sooth. But it doesn't fall out too easily, which is nice. I don't pay for a beer that is there and gone without even recognizing it.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

The taste is initally of a molasses, spice and then the figgy and fruity flavors kick in with the alcohol flavor and warmth. The alcohol is noticeable, but the beer is incredibly smooth and delicious. The mouthfeel is a little heavier than it's brothers but it still has that carbonation tingle that adds to the body and smoothness of the beer. One of the best beers I've had.

S - Spicy with cloves, bananas and brown sugar.  T - A nice combination of Belgian spices and bready, biscuity malts. Very complex and satisfying.

Bubbles line the glass however congregate in the middle. Appears a dark nearly nearly opaque coca-cola brown. Lacing clings to the glass like soap bubbles with every swirl as I agitated it for smell.  Smell: alcoholic, yeasty with dark malt hues. Fruity and spicy.  Taste & mouthfeel: Dark malt with spicy, chocolate and caramel warmth notes, a dark pitted fruit taste followed by an alcoholic warmth. Rather carbonated but very smooth with a creamy mouthfeel due to the thicker lacing. A very pleasing mouth feel A+  Drinkability: Well due to the high ABV and darkness its not really something you're gonna sit down and have four in a row. You'd be drunk and you're stomach.

Nice sweetness with a hop bite in the finish.  M - Light and crisp with tons of carbonation. Nose tickles.  D - Surprisingly high for the ABV, I will be finishing this with dinner.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,Palmcroft,4.62,"All I can add is that this beer has an incredible finish. Some malty sweet nougat at the end that masks the hop bite.  Actually, its finish is most reminiscent of the Dogfish Head Midas Touch, which uses honey, saffron, and grapes. So, what the heck is Chimay using? I thought it neutralized the alcohol very well.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Nose is sweet dark fruit with lots of spice character. Dark fruit flavors dominate, with a sense of spicy apple cider throughout. Medium to heavy in body, with a thick stickiness cut by lots of tiny bubbles. Tingly, highly carbonated finish. Alcohol shows up--quite strongly--in the second half of the glass.

It feels rather nice knowing that I still haven't opened the third one yet. But here it goes:  A: It pours a dark amber-tone. This cloudy beer with a thick rich head that has a light brown colour (almost beige) looks so tasty.  S: The smell is rather complex, with lots of different smells. It's most definitely roasted, but there is also a fruity smell as well as some hops. This sweet-smelling beer also has an alcohol-tone.  T: It's obvious that this is the strongest of the three Chimays, since the alcohol is present in the taste. This is a roasted beer with some yeast-tones. But there is also fruit (dark) and some hops in it. The taste is very complex. The aftertaste is long with a nice fruitiness, but again - the alcohol is noticeable.  M: Powerful and a bit dry. Even here is the alcohol an issue.  D: It's a great beer (as any beer graded A)! I think this is the Chimay-beer you should prioritize last on your wishing-list. It is a must on your list, but if you have to choose between this or the other Chimays this one is a clear third choice. When I try these three again (I have three of each in my beer-storage) I will change the order and possibly the ratings will change as well (bare in mind I already had two other, rather strong beers with lots of flavours before this one).",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,CHickman,4.06,"Pours dark brown color with a thick 2-3 finger tan head that faded about average to on the faster side and then settled into a nice foamy layer on top. It left minimal spotty lacing.  Smells of bread and yeast to start, followed by toffee, brown sugar, caramel, raisins, dark fruit and almost like a merlot or red wine; the sweetness is on the tame side as the spices and earthy notes let grains and light booze peek through. Almost has a syrup-like quality to it, but the herbal spices keep in pure Belgian.  Tastes malty and spicy with a sweet fruit and yeast finish that's on the dry side; the earthy spices have a mix of pepper, tea leaf, coriander, brown sugar and cinnamon or light cumin, allowing the bready malt to come through almost like French Toast. Seems like floral hops and rye mix in and then give way to toffee, caramel, syrup and a fruity combo including plum, raisins, rotting pear, musty green grapes, cherry and tart apples. A very good beer that's balanced and goes down smooth, yet still has a light alcohol bite and plenty of complex flavors. Chalky yeast and mild funk remind you this is a Belgian classic after every swallow.  Mouthfeel is slick and creamy with a chewy body, mild carbonation and a finish that is spicy with some funky yeast as it ends on the dry side. The alcohol is not a factor, so it's very easy to drink or sip as it warms up and allows more flavors to prevail. Finish is a tad too tart, but overall a very good beer and quite enjoyable.

S: Smell is nice and abundant with dark fruits (raisins, plums, figs) accompanied by a touch of cinnamon, clove, over-ripe banana and mucho yeast spices. Overall, a pretty dry scent and not too sweet.  T: Nice and dry with the aforementioned qualities. Nice dry fruit, prunes (the kind of your grandfather eats), raisins, and abundant spices. Again, pretty dry and not as sweet as I would think.  Overall, a great representation of the style.

The flavor is very much like a red wine to me a huge amount of dark fruits, grapes being the chief of them dominate your mouth .It did get a little warm alcohol wise as it warmed. The brew had a nice full to medium mouthfeel with good carbonation.  I love this brew, it is one of my go to brews.

215,2512,BARFLYB,4.04,"33cl bottle poured into a Chimay goblet, been meaning to try this one again for some time.  A- A loud hiss once the cap was popped, this one is certainly active with rising bubbles. With a very careful pour I still got a bunch of sediment in my beer. A flimsy off white head appeared as I put some distance between the bottle and glass, it did not last long only leaving some white fluff in the middle. The liquid is a murky red mahagony look, it's not blue at all.  S- A very nice Belgian scent coming from blue from all that wonderful yeast. Getting some malt sweetness plus dark fruits. Some additional sugar in this. Some mild spices in the mix as well with raisins. This could have a fuller scent though it was a bit light.  T- Belgian yeast up front giving off a candy taste, cotton candy. Raisins make a bigger step then in smell. Dark fruits with plums. Some residual sugars as well. Getting some light taste of banana and sweet caramel from the malt. Well rounded but kind of light in taste for me.  M- This one is a smooth ride even though the carbonation is high which gets in the way giving off a certain crispness. The body is much lighter than I expected, I would say its perfectly medium bodied. The candy sweetness sticks around a bit, im not complaining.  D- Very drinkable, I kept going back for more, I just wish the taste was a bit bolder. The alcohol is hidden extremely well, I did not sense it at all. I really need to try this and other chimays with their cheese as well, it probably makes the experience better.

Poured from 750ml bottle into a oversized Cabernet wine glass. Yielded a murky dark brown with ruby hues around the edges along with a nice cream colored head with great retention an light lacing.  Aromas that are instantly recognizable are intense cloves, some sugars, and some toasty malts. Nose seemed to be a little too powerful in cloves, which seemed to throw the other scents under the bus.  I really liked being surprised. The nose had me fooled about this being a good beer. Flavor is sweet with sugars and dark fruits being the center of the beer, followed with cloves, and some nice dark malts to really give this beer a backbone. Alcohol presence is just right, giving the drinker awareness that it's there, but really improving the flavor of the beer.  Mouthfeel was good as well. Finish was a tad drier and quicker than anticipated, but was still on par for the style overall.  Drinkability is great with the abundance of carbonation, but the high alcohol makes this one particularly devious.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Belgian yeast is definitely noticeable, along with a good dose of dark fruit and molasses and a touch of spice. It's not TOO rich, though. The mouthfeel isn't all that thick, and it's never cloyingly sweet. There's a touch of hop bitterness on the finish, along with some brown sugar. Alcohol is remarkably well hidden.

Tastes much like the smell hints. Burnt sugar, raisins,and figs, with a noticeable alcohol warmth at the back of the tongue, accompanied, by the slight bite of the hops. Very smooth and delightful.  Mouthfeel is thick with just the right amount of carbonation to aid the smell and flavor of this elixir. Not too watery or too thick.  This is one beer that it should be a crime to drink quickly. I find that if drink it slowly and really keep each sip in my mouth for a few moments; it make each bottle worth ten times more that the $10 price tag. A fantastic brew and my all time favorite.

Lacing is thick and creamy and tan in colour. Leaves a very good lacing.  Smell is a little faint but highly appetising. Caramel, molasses, stone fruits and wild berries. A definite sweet spiciness but also a more savoury malt smell for balance. Overall the 'malt' characteristics are more noticeable to me than the fruity ester characteristics.  Tastes much like it smells, a very smooth malt flavour acts as a nice solid base with the fruits and spices coming off of it. A lot less sweet than I was expecting. In fact less full of flavour than I was expecting, I found my palette feeling a little empty at times. Only a little empty though and the flavours present complimented each other very well.  Mouthfeel was smooth, full and creamy. Didn't find this fizzy at all for the style, I found the carbonation perfect. The mouthfeel was probably the highlight for me.  I mentioned I found the tastes a little faint. I also found my palette was in very good shape after a bottle, rather than being a little tired, and I could see myself being able to sip this all night without my enjoyment dropping.

It was a dark russet brown color with tons of yeast floating even with a slow pour. It had an average sized beige head that slowly settled into a collar with a center foam fed by a carb geyser (gotta love etched glassware). No lacing.  The aroma was raisin, spun sugar, burnt caramel and molasses. Hadn't had this in awhile (was shocked that I hadn't reviewed it yet considering how often I'd had it) and seemed to remember a better aroma. This one is good but a gotta keep sniffing it like I remember. The taste was good but again not as good as I remember. This is a hit and mostly miss style for me as I tend to not like the dark fruit taste. This is more on the hit side but didn't knock me over. Was a bit too sweet and sugary for me. Liked it and definitely would have another but not in a rush to do it.  Overall, a good but not great beer for me. Again, it's not my favorite style so that hurt it but still highly recommend.

Lots of suspended sediment. Head is pretty fizzy as it dissipated rather quickly. Lacing is non-existent.  S: Smell is pretty faint. I get a bit more dark fruit than the other two. Maybe hints of cherry or plum. Malt is there as well. Smells okay.  T: Flavor is pretty sweet. You get more spice in this one compared to the other two. A little dark fruit like cherry and raisin. The malt is there with the caramel and toffee notes I got in the other two. Alcohol is present in the finish. No flavor dominated this beer and everything feels a little subdued and underwhelming. Feels like something is missing. Might be my least favorite tasting of the three.  M: This one is definetly more fizzy than creamy. Medium-light bodied. Seemed a little lacking.  D: I think it is a little too carbonated and fizzy. Flavors are okay, but this beer left a lot to be desired. The mouthfeel isn't as rich as the other two.  I got to say, I am quite disappointed. I was hoping for a stronger, more flavorful version of the Red. This may have been a bad bottle, but I got it in the same sample pack as the other two Chimay beers, which tasted fine.

This wide of a flavor palate rivals a fine Bordeax wine in complexity but at less than half the price on average provides far better value for the money.

Leaves no lacing, but this beer looks like nothing Ive ever seen before! Smells of semi sweet chocolate wafer, grains, malts, caramel & molasses, followed by a dominate fruity apple, cranberry, pair, and blueberry, very much like apple cider or champagne. You can detect some subtle alcoholic notes, but a little more as it warms. Hard cider aroma overall, very mysterious & inviting.  Taste/Mouthfeel - Tastes of mellow sweet, grainy malty notes, caramel & molasses, subtle chocolate, together with dry hard cider flavors consisting of, apple, pair, cranberry, blueberry, prune & apricot. A little dry & acidic, champagne like, alcoholic notes but very hidden, some slight alcoholic burn as it warms though. Has a dominate hard cider flavor profile overall with hardly any bitterness, I haven't ever experienced flavors like this!

Drinkability/Final thoughts - I don't know where to start, first off the alcohol is dangerously hidden, you really got to be careful with this one, and the flavors are something Ive never experienced before! I was expecting a robust bitter beer, but this thing tastes like hard cider, like something I would enjoy over the Christmas season! The experience was amazing, I could put down an entire bottle of this and not even be aware of the dangerous alcoholic contents! Coming in at 13.99$ a bottle in CA, it's very expensive but if you can get your hands on it, it will blow you away. I absolutely loved this brew. Cheers!",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,Maction,4.25,"A: This is an opaque, but not hazy, caramel apple color with a creamy lacey head that dissolves fairly quickly.  S: It smells of dried fruit, French bread, sweet and sour, and is slightly boozy.  T: The taste is sweet and bready, with hints of cloves and raisins, dark chocolate and dry champagne. It's a complex flavor, with traces of raspberry hard candy and leather in further tasting.  M: My mouth feels big sparkling bubbles, but this is hefty with a clean hard alcohol finish.  D: I went through the 750 ml bottle with no problem. This is a very drinkable beer for it's richness and high alcohol.  Notes: A great beer. I suppose that I prefer St. Bernardus ABT 12, but this one is slightly more refreshing, though less dessert-like.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,KickInTheChalice,4.45,"Poured from a 75 cl bottle into my Chimay branded goblet.  Appearance: Chimay Grande Réserve pours a brown sugar color with a nice level of head. The head slowly relents, making the lively carbonation more visible for a while.  Smell: Cherry and dark fruit malt is the primary scent, with a little bit of vanilla and alcohol present as well. A careful, if not hidden collection of smells.  Taste: A smooth, balanced flavor from start to finish. The cherry and dark fruits are quite noticeable, but less dominant than in the smell. Some light spices make an appearance, as do vanilla and brown sugar. For 9% though, the alcohol is very nuanced. The malt is wide and deep; there is almost no hop flavor. A slightly medicinal aftertaste reminds me it is time for the next sip.  Mouthfeel: A very balanced feel on the tongue. Not especially carbonated, but not too thick either. Really it is just the right balance for a beer of this ABV.  Drinkability: Such a great beer, at the end of the glass all I can do is think about the next bottle. A great beer to relax and session.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Up to the light you can tell it's got a red hue. Quite opaque in the center.  Smell - Some cherry, a little raisin. Definitely some yeast in there as well. Possibly a hint of booze as well. Maybe some brown sugar.  Taste - Surprisingly sweet up front. Some of that cherry definitely shows up and lingers on the finish. It has a real crisp tartness, that is surprising. Sweet dark fruit. Very nice.  Mouthfeel - Excellent carbonation and body without being gassy. It's really nice.  Drinkability - Pretty good for the abv, but with so much carbonation it's going to be one and done.  This is a really classic beer. Just solid all-around. Can't believe it's been so long since I last had it. That won't be happening again.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

215,2512,CHADMC3,4.42,"Pours a murky walnut brown with a foamy tan head that patiently dissipates amongst the lively carbonation leaving a thin layer atop the body throughout the beer and only traces of lacing on the inner glass.  The aroma is of dark fruit such as nectarine or plum with raisins, caramel malt and yeast, while a further inspection reveals some brown sugar.  The dark fruits, brown sugar, yeast, and even sweet nuttiness all blend together quite well. As the beer warms, a spicy character develops which is the perfect touch for the slight alcohol burn and I believe I pick up something resembling dark or rye bread as well.  Light to medium in body, with significant carbonation, and an amazing palate to mingle with the generous abv make the mouthfeel very impressive.  One of my favorite styles, and certainly one of my favorites amongst it.

Smell: The aroma, such as it is, is very faint and light and seems to have hints of some fruits and maybe brown sugar.  Taste: The flavor contains some dark fruits and a good bit of brown sugar flavor and some nice chocolate (or maybe cocoa) from the malt.  Mouthfeel: Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and there is light soft carbonation. The finish is moderately long and slides from sweet fruit and chocolate into a light dry bitterness from the hops.

I felt that the carbonation added another layer to the beverage by giving it an effervescent mouthfeel. Be sure to let it rest once you take the bottle out of the fridge so that the multiple flavors are not masked by the cold temperatures. Over the course of drinking this Chimay, I noticed the flavors became more pronounced and complex, making for a very exciting drinking experience. The taste consisted of dark fruits and spice from the yeast. Some malty sweetness and a hint of alcohol. An incredible beer and experience.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,laituegonflable,4.56,"Now obviously I have tried Chimay Bleu twice, maybe thrice, in my formative years as a beer drinker, and never really cared for it. Drinking it today could be viewed as a pivotal point in my reviewing life, as I hereby ask the question: am I yet man enough for the blue stuff?  Pours lighter than I remember, although looks darker in the glass than it did in the stream from the bottle. An umber hue with a burnt sienna head, what a nice complement the colours make. Head starts quite voluminous but fizzes off and sinks to about a finger thickness after a minute. Fairly strong carbonation is feeding it from the bottom, and it leaves a thick, but not very sticky, beige lace residual when tilted. Phenomenal appearance.  Nose has all the dark and brooding phenols of an exquisite cognac. A very phenolic nose, with slight (perhaps too slight) hints of dark cherry, orange peel and nectarine. A suggestion of spicy Belgian yeast, and maybe a touch of white pepper. Smell is mostly sweet though, no burnt or bitter aroma at all. Complex, just slightly too subdued for me.  Taste is complex and uncompromising. Sweet yet dark, spicy and supple. Has a mid-palate full of red grape skins, overripe cherry and blood plum, while this is dusted off by the finish which is spicy in an actual fiery, burning way. A green peppercorn bite with a phenolic tang and the burn of a very mild-flavoured but potent chilli. This is all helped along the way by the alcohol sensation, which is a warming, pleasant sensation all the way down but never overpowering. The beer sizzles in the mouth thanks to that effervescent carbonation, yet the body is full and viscous and slides down the throat like a glob of heartburn medication.  This is a flaming hot crossbow bolt of a brew, explosive in potency yet calming and luxurious. It's a beer that makes you feel like a king. Superbly crafted, flavourful and playful. Simply wonderful right across the board.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

The flavors of dark fruits and a trace of vanilla all blend well within the perfect carbonation. It's taste holds up from first sip to last while the head leaves a nice lacing all the way down.  There are a lot of Belgian strong dark ales that successfully emphasize one partucular aspect of the style's taste. Chimay has taken a more balanced approach and they have pulled it off. Only the high ABV, which you don't taste at all, will keep you from having a second.  World class.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,PatrickJR,4.04,"Poured from a 750ml bottle into red wine glass, consumed somewhere around 50 degrees.  A - Quite murky, the color of a dark tea with orange mixed in. Largish 3-4 fingers of light brown head rise, though retention is fairly short and the head falls to nothingness. No lacing.  S - Mild dark fruits (plums, prunes, and currants) atop a fledgingly bready backbone. Some caramel and molasses make an appearance with a back end of sweet spice; cinnamon and clove stand out.  T - Somewhat bland dark bread hits early palate followed by some light notes of caramel, toffee, and molasses. Some of the dark fruit pulls through mid to late palate with a light sourness, but the flavor is fleeting. A final crescendo of sweetness enters in the form of a pronounced but short note of vanilla/banana. Sweetness drops off incrimentally into an earthy bitterness. Bitter clove and cinnamon take the stage near the end with a hard chalkiness and noticable alcohol pop in after the swallow. Aftertaste is mild to moderately bitter.  M - Medium bodied. Carbonation is moderate to moderate-mild. It's difficult to analyze the mouthfeel in context as this is a subtle and therefore challenging brew. Fairly smooth all in all with a carbonation that doesn't interfere.  D - Grand Reserve is a beer I've had on many occasions, even before I was into good beer as a whole. I'm surprised it's taken me this long to get around to reviewing it, but figured there was no better time due to my recent fascination with Belgians. Certainly a good a beer, though I'm not sure I applaud it as much as the beer community at large. Tasty, but somehow indistinct and unoriginal in the world of fine Belgian beers. In a way, it's a little *too* subtle for a big Belgian beer.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

The trapist brew pours a coca cola color brown with a hint of ruby red in it. the head too a little extra umph to form a nice size. The aroma from this brew is great and is filled with dark fruits, malasas smell with alcohol along the way. The flavor is a great taste of dark fruits with figs and so on balanced with a great sweet malt. The flavor was not extremly complex as to overwhelm the drinker but was perfect to entice the drinker for more. The alcohol level in this brew is tasted but is also balanced well with the dark fruit flavor.

Served: In a bottle, poured into an ale glass.  A: Perfect. As I poured the beer in, the head already started to form, never surpassing 1.5 inches. The body is an unfiltered dark tan color with copious amounts of bubbles. Looks very mysterious.  S: Smells rich with mild citrus and a perfect amount of hops and yeast.  T: Tastes how I described it in a perfect blend. I don't think I could stress the ""perfect"" enough. Incredibly smoothe and leaves you wondering what you're really tasting.  M: With a mild carbonation, it starts out moderately hoppy with a fruity aftertaste. I want to say lemon and orange.  D: With the ABV of 9.00% set aside, I would love to have another one. This beats out the Chimay Red & White, but not to take away from those two either since they are really good as well.

215,2512,Jeffo,4.59,"Got this at the bottle shop down the road.  From a bottle into a Chimay Chalice.  APPEARANCE: Pours a 2+ finger medium looking fluffy tan head with decent retention. Color is a deep dark burnt umber or auburn brown with minimal carbonation. A thick cap remains until the end but leaves minimal lacing down the glass. Nice for sure, but needs a little lacing to make it a beauty.  SMELL: A very bold and enticing nose for sure. Some toasted and caramel malt with lots of dark fruits as well. Raisins and grapes are obvious, along with some prunes and dates as well. Some nice spicy elements too, cloves for sure, and added spices from the bed of Belgian yeast. Strong wonderful scent, certainly makes a statement.  TASTE: Caramel and sweet malt up front, with lots of dark fruits again, raisins, dates and plumbs specifically. Spices make a bigger appearance after the initial taste, with cloves and some spices from the yeast and alcohol taking over near the end. Very nice and complex. The aftertaste is mild and long lasting, including caramel malt, raisins, and spices, with a touch of alcohol and Belgian yeast under it all. Very tasty and complex overall.  PALATE: Medium-thick body with medium carbonation. Creamy smooth on the palate, goes down as such with no bite, surprisingly. The ABV is nowhere to be tasted or felt. Finishes with a great balance between coating and dryness on the palate. Great feel as well.  OVERALL: A real treat of the brewing industry. One of the best beers out there, and fits in well with the other great offerings from Chimay. This one is actually very dubbel like; could be described as a dubbel on steroids. Very drinkable and extremely enjoyable, this one is a must try for all Belgian beer fans. I'll have to make a nice place in the beer cellar for a stock load of these.

215,2512,Buschyfor3,4.42,"Served from a 750ml bottle into a St. Bernardus chalice.  A: Pours a deep, amber-burgundy color; fairly thin but creamy off-white head; fairly opaque, with just the slightest hint of amber highlights along the edges of the glass when held to light.  S: Fairly sweet aroma from this beer - cloves are very prominent in the nose along with a caramel, dextrin sweetness. There is that familiar Belgian spiciness from the yeast - fruit esters, tangy, spicy, delicious. Maltiness is in the back nose, but what you get is a fresh biscuit aroma and a faint bit of whole-grain wheat.  T: Fruity sweetness, maybe a bit of pear, apple, or the slightest hint of citrus fruits. Spicy, tangy clove flavor that closely follows the sweetness. Mid sip, the malt background starts coming forth with a musty whole-grain wheat and fresh biscuit flavor. Finish is slightly drying, with the malt background sticking around with a nutty, slightly buttery finish.  M: Decent carbonation produces a crisp, tingly feel on the tongue; slightly powdery on the finsh.  D: Good drinkability for 9% ABV Strong Dark Ale. I am splitting this bottle with a fraternity brother and it's going down so smoothly that I can probably go for another glass. One 750 on my own though, and I would be good to go for the night.  A good BSDA, and one that lives up to the hype in my honest opinion. Strong flavors, complex and quite delicious. Recommended",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,ThatWineGuy,4.15,"Expiry 2013, so I think this has been in my cellar for about a year. Tan head, two fingers, steadily retreated to an island of tiny-bubble froth that heaved and boiled at centre glass. Since I was a bit anxious on the pour, there is a lot of sediment added to produce a plum or prune puree with lots of suspended particle matter. Good carbonation, only minor lacing.  Smell of dark fruit tort cake, candied fruit, prunes and with air and warming, a minty air about it. Taste is layered caramel, bitter sour fruit flashes, well balanced acidity. Smooth and even mouthfeel with a bitter finish and sour dark fruit aftertaste. Alcohol well integrated. With air and warming came better balance and a more even flavour profile, rich texture yet smooth and tasty. This could be my favourite of the Chimays I've tried, I could easily go for another right this minute if only I had one available.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,prototypic,4.25,"Grand Reserve pours a very murky tea color. It's littered with yeast particles, even after a careful pour. Carbonation is extremely active and produces a light tan head that nearly reaches three fingers. It was very quick to recede, leaving light lace trailing down the glass.  The nose is quite good, but falls short of special. It features a diverse array of spices up front. Cinnamon, pepper, and light clove are most notable here, but there are surely others. There's some light plum and raisin scents, but they're pretty well buried and don't shine as much as they should. There's an overall earthy quality. It's a little grain and grass, but doesn't lean too far in either direction. Belgian yeast is mildy noticeable. Despite its 9% abv, I'm not picking up any on the nose. Overall, it's a good smelling beer, but needs to crank it up a little in the dark fruit and yeast departments.  The flavor is very, very good. I'm waffling a little on the score, so I'll hold that call. It has a nice spicy flavor. Cinnamon, ginger, and pepper are the primary components. To a lesser degree, there's some clove. Dark fruit is much more pronounced in flavor and this beer is all the better for it. Raisin, plum, and fig work like a charm with this one. It is a little malty and sweet. There's a light cocoa-like chocolate flavor. Belgian yeast is noted, but isn't prevalent by any means. Some residual grain and earthy notes are noted throughout. Alcohol is more noticeable here, but doesn't quite reach a warm or hot level. The flavor profile is very deep and complex. That becomes much more apparent with warming. With that revelation, I've made my decision on the score. Excellent, it is.  Its body feels light and too thin. I had hoped it'd feel more substantial with a few more degrees under its belt, but it doesn't. High carbonation doesn't help. It feels buzzy and never reaches a smooth level. I hate to bash it here, but it has a feel that's barely above average. Drinkability on other hand is excellent. The flavor is nothing short of excellent and it goes down like a dream for a 9% beer. It doesn't taste or feel that big.  Grand Reserve is no doubt a classic. It's an excellent BSDA. To be honest, I've had better representations of the style, but this one easily competes with the best of them. The only thing that really holds it back a little is its body. It just feels too thin and carbonation's a tad high. But, it's all around very impressive otherwise. It probably deserves its spot in the bottom quarter of the Top 100 somewhere. How long it will stay there is anyone's best guess. Impressive stuff.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

One beer and that is it. I think the red or blanche is more of a multiple beer. Still, the blue is the best by far. I still think the Orval is a better overall beer but the Chimay is world class.

215,2512,Harfatum,4.5,"The rich aroma matches well with the robust yet very drinkable taste. All in all, this is a very balanced and enjoyable beer. There are, surprisingly enough, notes of balsamic vinegar - this is the first time I've tasted that in a a beer.

Lots of caramel and candy apples in the taste. Also got hints of fruit cake and rum? Carbonation reminds me of champagne. Wow what a great brew.

Excellent.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

The color is really great, but there's some suspended sediment that gives it a weird look. Perhaps I should have left a bit in the bottle.  The smell is great, strong of molasses and dark fruits and alcohol. The taste is amazing, sweet and malty with a cherry and dark with the fruits continuing. Seemed a bit over carbonated when it was cold, but that went away as it warmed. Overall a great beer.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Smells nice and yeasty with hints of fruit and earth. The taste is incredibly smooth and sweet with the fruit presenting itself afterward. Also you can hardly taste the alcohol - it's masked pretty very well for a 9%. Has a nice bready taste in the mouth with subtle notes of sugar and barley. It's very drinkable and savory.  Definitely doesn't disappoint!,Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,BeerFMAndy,4.3,"750ml bottle split and poured into a Chimay Goblet. (I'm assuming) brewed on date of 09/08 on the cork.  A - Dark ruby brown with a good chimney of carbonation. Loose tan head that had some decent retention. *Tulip would be much better for head and aroma here.  S - Sweet malts surrounded by dark, ripe fruits and some fruity esters. Yeast, raisin, some light wheats and banana hints. Bread and a small bit of clay.  T - Strong malty sweetness with some good fruit bouquets coming up. Complex in a very subtle way but not amazing. Towards the end I added some sediment which really made it spicy. *Poured into a Triple Karmeliet Tulip after a few sips. The Chimay Goblet with the metal ring on top imparts a metal flavor making it totally useless...  M - Smooth but with a very slight carbonation bite. Medium to full in body with just a bit of alcohol warming.  D - The alcohol hides well behind a delicate flavor that is an easy drink for this style but in the end it's not overly fantastic to me.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,MasterSki,4.2,"Pulled one of these out of the fridge - haven't had one in a long time. Best before 2013, so about a year old. Served in my Darkness tulip.  A - Two fingers of quick-dissolving tan foam with minimal lacing. Opaque dark raisin-brown color, with streams of tiny bubbles visible at the edges. I wish there was a little bit more retention and lacing, but otherwise it's pretty solid looking.  S - Roast barley malt, caramel, Belgian yeast, berries, candy, and a touch of booze as it warms up. It's a very good-smelling brew, and probably the baseline for the style - it's just that after all the other crazy Belgians I've smelled this seems awfully tame.  T - Lots of caramel and bready malts, but with plenty of fruitiness and brown sugar elements, and maybe a bit of spice in there as well. The alcohol is very well hidden.  M - Lively carbonation on the upper lip and tongue, a little too much for my liking. Medium body, and with a surprisingly dry finish for something so sweet. There's definitely some warming that is quite nice.  D - I'm not sure I'd want more than one, but it's remarkably easy to drink for a 9% brew. Still, the carbonation and ABV would make this an evening-ender instead of a starter.  Like I said - it's the reference point for the style, and while it's been surpassed it's still a terrific and worthwhile brew, particularly in places like Ontario where there are limited options.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Aroma is starts off with a big dose of raisins, spicy alcohol and some earthy yeast blending a nice bit of brown sugar.  Taste is dark fruit (raisins, red grapes), spicy alcohol bite is prominent, and a body that pulls out thoughts of brown sugar-laden spice bread. Earthy finish balances the richness with a nice, semi-bitter alcohol, raisin, and red grapeskin bite after flashes of spicy brown sugar sweetness.  Mouthfeel is creamy, fluffy, beautiful Medium bodied, soft, fliuffy carbonation just slides along the tongue. Alcohol is big in the exhale but manageable, alongside a bit of earthy yeast.

215,2512,ecoastman,4.75,"I wish this beer was available more often in stores around my town. I had this from a small bottle at the Bier Markt in Toronto and then a gift pack from the liquor store. Outstanding and is superior to the white and red labels - by far my favourite of the three.  It pours dark velvet with a dense tan coloured head. Against a light there is some rose hue but the beer is virtually opague. The head recedes but is very well retained with a thin, dense layer. Sadly, no lacing in my new and rinsed Chimay chalice.  Sweet malt and bread along with the characteristic complex Belgian style aromas. Dark fruits in light alcohol and chocolate. All of this and not over powering.  Ultra smooth as the malt hits the palate. All of the aromas deliver in the form of flavour. No bitterness or coursness in the finish. Deception is the description for the ABV - stealth like. Very drinkable but you've got to be careful...  One of my favourites. Reminds me of Avintinus, another one of my favourites...but even smoother.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,BMoney575,3.21,"Sampled on 4-17-09  Pours an excessively deep red color, impossible to see through unless held to a bright light. A fizzy off-white head settles to a nice layer, leaving rings of short-lasting lacing.  Smell is dark fruit, lots of raisin, very clean with not a lot going on. With some effort, I pick up blueberry and a slight vanilla.  Taste is very clean, thin, with an soapy flavor. Not complex, not even flavorful, if not for the alcohol that comes in at the very end. What a disappointment.  Mouthfeel is extremely thin and watery, with quite a bit of carbonation, which doesn't help.  Drinkability is decent, but not what I look for in a $13.99 beer.  Overall, I've wanted to try this beer for a long time, and I was better off before.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,johnmichael712,4.18,"Appearance: Poured out of an 11.2 oz bottle into a Chimay goblet. There is no freshness date on the bottle. This beer pours a dark, rosewood brown that has orange highlights when backlit with a lamp. The gorgeous, fluffy, whipped head is an off-white color and is supplemented by a ridiculous amount of small carbonation bubbles rising from the depths of the glass. The head lasts for an absolute eternity, and a thick layer of foam remains on top of the beer throughout the entire drinking experience, but it leaves no lace behind.  Smell: The nose of this beer has an exceptionally strong clove smell, and it's no secret that both this yeast strain and this beer comes Belgium. There is also an abundance of sweet malt in the nose, and it brings with it hints of caramel and toasted bread. Despite the appearance of pale hops in the taste, they don't show up in the nose.  Taste: Chimay Blue starts out with a rich infusion of pale, spicy hops mingling with the same clove yeast that was so pushy in the aroma. Following this, the toasted malt comes into play, and it is moderately sweet and very rich. There are also notes of raisins or prunes, and perhaps a bit of molasses, and this leads to a strong taste that is very reminiscent of the crust of fresh toasted bread, eventually culminating in a slight alcohol taste and a spicy, clovey finish that is slightly drying on the palate.  Mouthfeel: This beer has an absolutely fabulous mouthfeel, and it is heavenly soft and creamy on the tongue. There is moderate carbonation, but no carbonic acid ""bite""; one of the reasons for the excellent mouthfeel. Medium body, perhaps not as full as it could be, along with a good dose of alcohol warmth, this beer is like a nice, warm bed for the tongue.  Drinkability: Very easy to drink, and these 11.2 oz disappeared much faster than expected. The pleasant, spicy taste and the wonderfully soft mouthfeel make for one easy drinking beer, and when you combine that with the 9% ABV this little guy boasts, Chimay Blue becomes one deliciously dangerous beer.  Notes: This is definitely the best of the Chimay offerings, and it's a damn fine beer. Further tastings of other Belgian Strong Dark Ales must follow this one in order for me to make a claim on if it is overrated like most other BA's seem to think, but right now, on a cool spring night, I can't see how this beer could be called anything but excellent.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

215,2512,xerxes2695,4.6,"I love this beer! Two caveats if you're trying it for the first time. First and foremost, this beer is much better if it's a little warm. I take it out of the fridge and let it come up to temperature for 30 mins or so, probably somewhere in the range of 50%F. Cold, it's dissapointing considering the good reviews and the cost but half warm it's flavore and aroma really opens up. Second is that different vintages have varying tastes. It's not significant, but noticable. Proabably has to do with the bottle conditioning.  The bitterness is primarily chocolate rather than hops. Malty, yeasty, and just a little sweet (but not too sweet even for this semi-hop-head). Light citrus, earth and Caramel. Champagne -like carbonation and thin but always present head. Really good.

215,2512,biegaman,4.24,"Deep burgundy with Kalamata olive tinge. Despite its dark tone, the beer maintains clarity until the introduction of yeast sediment. The head is fluffy and cloud-like and provides adequate covering for the surface. The beer certainly appears deserving of the royal-looking Chimay chalice designed to hold it.  When young, the beer exudes the odor of little else other than fresh yeast. It's one that I found far too simplistic and one-dimensional. This sample, aged the better part of five years already, is far more layered and intricate. There is a tremendously rich base of dark caramel as well hints both fruity and floral.  This is not the same beer when fresh. One sip in, I can now personally testify to the beer's complexities that come with aging. It has become an intricate, sophisticated drink with striking similarities to a vintage port. There is a brandy-like sweetness, a hint of alcohol strength and a bed of wild flowers and dark, dried fruits.  I'm not overly enchanted with this beer when fresh. With the age under its belt, however, I can definitely see the likeness to fine wines or aged port that many have bestowed upon it. I wouldn't consider this a special occasions beer; this would make a wonderful every-day beer to accompany reading, company or a hearty dinner.  Chimay's reputation may have superseded it for me. It is widely hailed as one of the world's finest beers, only now can I agree rightfully so. It's only apt that this is brewed by monks because it has clearly achieved a higher state of being. This is a heavenly drink, no doubt, that should be found in any respectable beer cellar.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

A nice reddish brown color with a tall thin head. So carbonated that it reminds me more of a light pilsner.  S. A sweet smell of yeast with a fruity nose.  T. A caramelized fruit taste that is sweet at first and finishes with a pronounced alcohol aftertaste. This beer is a roller coaster ride for the senses.  M.

Full-bodied and a touch heavy on the palate, here the flavors deliver more depth. And while no heat, you can feel the alcoholic content. Clove, allspice, cinnamon spice and orange peel comes at you first, notes of cola and brown bread as well. The carbonation is very aggressive, although not able to cleanse, more so add to the turbulence. Chocolate powder, yeast, raisin, fig, apricot, peach and banana fruit fit into the groove.

Good dark brown sugar sweetness, dark dried fruit, fig or date, some yeastiness and some chemical alcohol (the latter came out more pronounced as the beer warmed). Pretty clean finish, with a hint of bitterness as your palate clears. Nothing here that is telling you to pace yourself.

Wonderful to say the least. T: Starts out sweet and fruity, and leaves you with just enough hop and yeast flavor. M: A little too carbonated, but maybe I just didn't let it breathe enough.

Served in a Chimay glass at the proper temperature.  What a great looking beer. Think deep mahogany brown, complete with its characteristic variations in depth of color. Not much lacing noted, and the head dissipates to a long-lasting thin foam covering.  The nose is filled with spices, dark fruits, caramel, brown sugar, and molasses. Some yeasty and Belgian funk undertones.  Taste is more of the same - raisins, caramel, Belgian yeast, and malt. An slight hop presence reveals itself over time.  Carbonation is high, something to be expected with a proper Belgian brew. Mouthfeel is full-bodied and creamy, and the finish coats the mouth with a stickiness that seems to cry out for another sip.

Big, light head that sticks around for a while. Heavy carb.  S - It's got that unique Chimay thing going on. Perhaps some herbal notes from the Trappist yeast. Good.  T - Sometimes I love it, sometimes not so much. Really depends upon my mood. Every so often I catch that herbal, clove-like aftertaste that's characteristic of Belgian yeast. It can be somewhat off-putting, but only in the rare instance where the planets align and I get the full force of it. Otherwise, quite good. Alcohol masked very well.

The taste becomes mildly sweet with the carmelized brown sugar again showing up. Some light spices become evident on the way down. A slight alcoholic burn, reminiscent of rum.  Medium to full bodied.

Sweetness up front, getting some bitterness on the sides of my toungue, and then a little of the alcohol in the back of the mouth. Mouthfeel on this is out of this world.

I poured it into a large mug firmly at 45 degrees F.  Appearance: Very cloudy reddish brown with a huge three finger head and hardly any lacing. The head dissapated quickly. Tons of yeast is suspended in this brew. Large chunks settle on the bottom of glass.  Smell: I am not worthy of describing these complex scents. Here's my best shot: The alcohol and hops tickle your nose. I smell honey, cloves, brown sugar, sour grapes, and yeast.  Taste: Hop bitterness, & tangy carbonation. Sweet rasins & prunes. Sour grapes, with spicy hints of cloves and crushed black pepper. An after taste that reminds me of spiced rum.  Mouthfeel: Medium body with plenty of carbonation. The bitterness on my tongue makes me squint.  Drinkability: This well done ale is one of the best BSDA I have tried. It is a sipper not a gulper.

I'm talking some serious chunky monkey Shortly after the pour, you see the turbulence caused by the immense carbonation make the chunks randomly but swiftly rise and fall before it settles and they just sort of suspend in the liquid. Huge whitish head eventually recedes, leaving less lace than I expected.  Scent of figs, brown sugar, and a very faint rum. Some possible clove/allspice in there as well. Really not as heavily scented as I expected in such a strong, carbonated ale though, and I let it warm. Some yeastiness can be picked up as the glass drains.  Getting a prune soaked in spiced, oak-aged rum taste here and me likey. Sweet caramelized molasses coats the tongue as the spice and alcohol cleanse it away at the swallow. Musty, yeasty barnyard funk elbows its way in toward the end. There is a pronounced and slightly surprising hop bitterness that the dry mustiness injects too. Not heavy in the mouth for as strong and sweet as it is either. Goes down too smoothly for the gravity and complexity!  Overall this is truly all it is advertised by style: dark, strong, and Belgian. Definitely a sipper, but much more quaffable than others I have tried. Complexed and yet approachable, this is the perfect night cap.

Visible carbonation, though most of it is derived from the etching in the center of the bottom of its namesake's chalice.  The scents are figgy and a bit of boozy alcohol. A few swirls evoke deep & sweet malts with a hint of nougat. Vanilla and a little sourness creep up as well.  Bold yet soft flavors of pruins and mollases with a slighty acrid with a mineraly, flinty, stoney thing going on. The alcohol is somewhat well-hidden, but it's there a little bit. Some yeasty esters give it a micro amount of tartness too. Some chocolate & lots of spice in the finish.  Mouthfeel is superb. Fine and just the right amount of playful carbonation with a medium body. Spicy and semi-dry flavorful finish.  Drinkability is good. I'm content with my one small bottle though. God help the person who drinks seeral of these in one sitting (emphasis on 'sitting').  I've had this ale many times, but this is the first time in at least 4-5 years (and my first time formally reviewing it). It could be my pallet, but I'm willing to wager this ale has been dumbed-down as of late. I remember this ale bursting with flavor with lots of layers and complex as all get-out. The spiciness is still there, but the richness seems to have waned. This bottle is fairly fresh (I'm guess less than 6 months old) so maybe the ale I remember thoroughly enjoying might have had some age on it?

Light body where a medium body would have been nicer and probably better at masking ABV.  d - Good, for sure. The first glass is hitting strong even after a full meal. Tastes like a 4% ABV for all its 9% ABV strength - top notch there. Just a little too light bodied and over-carbonated to be my top pick over several Ommegangs or a Local 1.

""Trappist"" was painted on the neck and the labels were extra-thick, colorful and without flaw.  Opening it up, The first thing I was hit with was the unmistakable scent of dry red wine. This lasted for quite some time before I noticed smokey oak wood, plenty of barley malt, cherries and a BIG amount of estery alcohol mixed in with all of it.  Taste... All I can think of is the Mormon Tabernacle choir singing ""Oh Holy Night"" where it gets to the ""FALLL! ON YE KNEEE! OH HEARRR THE ANGEL VOOOIIIICCEESSS!"" part.  Oh sweet revelations! Words fail me! This shows itself first as fruity, with grape and cherry notes, followed by the big malt, a mild amount of floral hops with a warming and very present alcohol following through the entire experience.

Mouthfeel: Syrupy thick, and very highly carbonated. Felt like I was drinking soda...don't think that's a bad thing, in this case though.  Drinkability: Definitely a sipper.

Bready and yeasty flavors are very much evident, but not as dominating as in the nose. Alcohol is noticeable, as is a bitter, dry finish. A great example of a Belgian strong sipping ale.

The head recedes quickly, leaving little lacing to speak of.  S: Pez candy and cognac come to mind on the nose. It smells sweet, and floral, but for some reason I can't shake this whiff of what reminds me of Henessey Cognac. Woody, clean, mild and sweet.  T: Once again, pez candy, but the cognac aroma is no longer present. It's become more of a mixture of light fruits and candy such as sweet tarts or pez. Mildly sweet, with just a bare hint of alcohol behind this nice combination of flavors. Floral hops make themselves just barely obvious, mixed with mild grains. Lovely.  M: Initially, it struck me as a little too light, but I was incorrect. Medium bodied, mild, creamy, effervescent and just perfect for the style. A lot more carbonation than I initially thought, and it lends well to the texture.  D: Aside from the mild alcohol warming in the tummy and the price tag, I think this might be one of the most drinkable beers I've ever had. It's got the perfect balance of taste and texture, and even with 9% abv it's dangerously drinkable. I'm glad I didn't buy a bomber, I just might have gotten bombed. In fact, if I knew what I know now, I would've bought 2 bombers and not just 11.2 ounces of this heavenly nectar.

Initially note a malt character then it moves to a sugary/candy sweet aroma. Nice, but nothing exceptional. One inch tan head that settles to a low layer cap. Very fizzy sound as it settles. No lacing. Now the flavor is a different story. Really smooth and not overpowering. Good mix of malt flavors and candy sweetness. Very quickly warms the insides. Rather short finish. The sweetness is really nice with fruit added to the other noted flavors. Enough hops to cut the sharpness some and some drinks finish with a slight hop character. Yum. Minimal alcohol flavor, although it increases some in time, but it's never excessive or overpowering. This is probably a fairly new bottle (considering how it was purchased, but I don't know how the read the dating). Plenty o' bubbles almost make it effervescent. Pleasing smoothness in the body, although it is a little light in body for style. I really like the richness being held back in this beer. This adds considerable to the drinkability (and it's scored relative to style). Good beer, nicely done.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Having him on the superbow pre-game was a nice touch, im glad they let W do that... Oh wait they didnt.  Took it out of the fridge so it could cool down for about an hour before drinking. Popped the cork and there is definitely less carbonation than a champagne bottle. Looks promising!  Appearance: Dark amber color. Almost the color of root beer.  Smell: Very pleasant earthy fruity smell. Nice. No hops.  Taste: Wow. An overpowering sticky sweet malty taste. Not session drinkable at all. Best paired with dinner in smaller servings. Distinct alcohol aftertaste, there is no hiding the alcohol content on this one.  Mouthfeel: Nice, but a bit more carbonated than a beer like this needs to be.

This is the first of the Chimay line I've tried, and I reccomend trying some of the lower strength beers first because I'm sure the alcohol flavor won't be as prevalant.  Other than that, it was a quality brew fo sho.

S - Sweet cherry-plum smell, a bit of pepper in the background and other ""spicy-ness"" I cannot put a word to. Very interesting.  T - Malty sweet cherry and plum, nutmeg, lingering sweet finish  MF - Fairly light bodied for this style. Carbonation is evident and there is a warming alcohol tingle on the tongue.

Only about one finger of head resulted, and surprisingly, quickly faded away as many soda-like bubbles rose from the bottom of the glass. Smell is of ripe grapes, dried plums, and sweetness--alternately brown sugar and chocolate.  The taste of Chimay Blue shines among the Belgians (and Belgian-inspireds) I've tried so far. Most pronounced flavor is dried, maybe candied cherries, crusty rye, and those sweet grapes in the back-end. Mouthfeel is silky and full with a dry finish that reminds me of a light red wine.  The taste is so delicious and the alcohol so subtle that I'd love the chance to sit down with a much larger bottle of this beer.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

(as we live in a pretty small town). We bought 3 bottles and took them back to the house... thus began my love affair with Belgian ales.  Very aromatic dark fruit, raisin, prune, fig, and even a little orange on the nose. Smooth mouth feel and very sharp on the back of the tounge. Pleasant alcohol flavor, that I feel does not detract from overall taste. Wonderful malt flavor and aroma, but not too heavy or overpowering.

The only thing resembling a ""best by date"" are the characters L07-649 (?) on the label.  A Very dark, tree bark body which only direct light can get through and even then the light has to go through very murky, deep reds and browns. The head is a generous inch or so but it dissipated surprisingly quickly.  S Sweet malts for sure but grainier than I was expecting with yeasts, barley smells. No hops.  T Nice, pleasing malts in front with almost no hops until, actually, the beginning of aftertaste (just after swallowing). Very true to the style and the alcohol in this one is well hidden. The sweetness fakes my taste buds out quite a bit. I can taste alcohol but it does not feel like the 9% ABV that is listed. Later, after it got closer to room temperature, the taste seemed to thin out a little bit (or was that mouthfeel?)  M Full like it should be with big malt taste, some carbonation and it kind of dances across the tongue.  D Very good for this strong of an ABV and the style.  Notes: I know that I drank this within the past year but I guess my rating did not quite make it here to BA before today. A very good example of my favorite style. I have now rated each of the regularly available Chimays and I believe that I can say that I would recommend them as a sort of benchmark for their style as far as Belgians.

215,2512,Soneast,3.9,"So you want to drink a Belgian Ale? Well look no further than this beer right here. Chimay; widely available, moderately priced and a damn good beer to boot!  Pours an amber color with mahogany hues. Has a nice, thick, pillowy, cream colored head that has great retention never truly disappearing. Lots of sediment on the bottom so be wary of that. If you don't mind yeast particles, dump it in, otherwise leave that last sip or so in the bottom of the bottle.  Like a lot of Belgian dark ales and quads that I've had this has a lot of dark fruit notes on the nose. Not quite a raisin smell per say, but certainly a sweet rich fruit aroma backed up by a decidedly malted aroma with hints of yeast undertones.  The flavor seems predominated by the sweet malts and brown sugar then followed quite nicely by the dark fruits and baked bread leaving an almost black cherry finish. With quite a bit of booze present. This really warms ya up!  This rich, heavy bodied beer is light on the carbonation, leaving a lot of tongue coverage to help bring out the complex flavors. The flavors really come out as it warms, I'd almost suggest drinking at room temperature.

Bottle conditioning was evident, as foam slowly began to rise out of the bottle shortly after the cap was popped. Poured this eight-dollar delight (though it was free thanks to a punch-card!) into a stemless red wine glass.  Pours dark chestnut with a pillowy tan head that sticks around for the duration of the drink, leaving behind faint webbings of lace on the walls of the glass.  A full, complex yeast-induced spiciness fills the nostrils, with subtle hints of clove and anise; dark fruits peek through a bit, and alcohol becomes apparent as the beer warms, becoming very noticeable as room temperature approaches.  A nice, full body holds surprisingly little carbonation; the great, gorgeous foaming effect seemed to preface a bubbly brew, but such is not the case, as carbonation on the tongue is very soft.  Rich and malty up front, with a great caramel sweetness that gives way to a complex array of raisins, figs, molasses, burnt brown sugar, and a touch of alcohol. Hop presence is quite subdued, nearly undetectable, but present is a spicy carryover from the nose. A light sweetness coats the back of the tongue as the drink goes down, finally finishing with an astonishing dryness that is unexpected considering the considerable malty character of the beer.  Extremely well-balanced, with a high level of alcohol that is, though detectable, well-subdued and none overpowering. The balance makes this a beer that is never cloying in any aspect, but one with a wide array of complex flavors and aromas that co-mingle exceptionally.

If you have smelled Red Man honey chew this has some smells like that too.  T- The malt taste is there up front and quite bold. The fruits are there, but not as sweet and up front like I would prefer. Plus the alcohol taste is too present. This is good, but eh.

Alcohol is also prevalent in the smell. Taste is godly. Starts out with the sweet brownsugar, into dark fruits like plums and raisins (and ive tasted some apple in some sips as well) into a spicyness with a (pleasant) alcohol taste in the back end. Lingering aftertaste of sweet cherries and plums + spices. hell yeah thats good. Gets better and better as the bottle goes on too (probably because of warmth and more yeast). There is also a slight malty bready backbone. However, there is literally zero floral hoppiness readily found. Mouthfeel is sublime. creamy and smooth. starts thick, ends with a tingle from the spiciness. Heaven in your mouth. Drinkability is extremely high for the abv.

215,2512,HalfFull,3.72,"From a 750 ml bottle and poured into a Chimay glass. This beer pours a reddish amber with a nice solid half inch of tan head. A yeasty opaque mahogany against the light. Nice retention, quite an elegant brew.  Moderate yeasts and slightly sweet on the nose, with a mix of fresh and dried fruit. Rather light for the style yet obviously restrained by a copious surface cap, holding the volatile smells at bay. This beer looks better than it smells.  All is good again in the flavor of this beer. Nice complex malt presence with little 'apparent' sweetness save a rather viscous feel. Notes of fig and crystalline brown sugar, some muddled dried dark cherry. A bit thick on the tongue in the finish however.  Firm carbonation yields a nice creamy feel throughout the glass. Yet I think that this beer is excessively carbonated as the taste and smell suffer somewhat by the confusion brought on by said carbonation. (note: I barely contained the cork when opening the bottle, don't know if this is atypical). Drinkability is decent but certainly not exceptional and not nearly as crisp as I would prefer in a strong ale. In the end it tastes a bit like a Cherry Cream Soda(some imagination required!).  Skip the Chimay Chalice and pour this into a large wine glass to allow for better agitation and outgassing of bottle conditioned carbonation, unless all you want to do is look at the beer.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Muddy brown russet with a sticky, long-lasting mellow tan head that settles in and goes nowhere. Opaque and if you pour the dregs you'll get a decent amount of sediment.  S. Rich brown sugar and prunes upfront, lesser dark fruit and a toasty, sweet German black bread malt profile that is quite appealing and hearty. Some warm booze in the nose and a little ester apple bite thanks to the yeast. Hints of pepper-like spice. Good, not mind-blowing. In a nutshell: sweet, deep fruits, mellow.  T. Mirrors the smell quite nicely... what we have here is a rich brown ale with lots of toasty, not-quite roasted malt supported by lots of dark fruit, alcohol, and that Belgian estery-fruity character we all know and love. Rich bread, green apples, candi sugar, nutmeg?, prunes, a touch of orange peel perhaps... it's all pretty good. Well done.  M. Great. Wet, boozy, mid-bodied and pleasingly carbonated to soft perfection. Finish is sweet, fruity and warm with a dry turn at the last. Drinkable as far as these things go.  Chimay Blue is a good beer -- outdone by its more famous rivals, but there is no denying that this is solid stuff and a great beer to start off with if you're about to explore Belgians.

Off-white head has great retention and stickage. Beautiful.  S: Sweet and candy-like initially. Dark, overripe fruits start to sneak in. Plums, raisins, even pomegranate. Some hints of its alcohol as well, in the form of ester notes. Soft breadiness from the yeast rounds it out and holds it together. A symphony for the nose, if you will. Lots going on.  T: Oh my... Where do I begin? Lots of sweet malt character. Lots of complex fuitiness. Some sweet spice up front as well. Yeast character gives the whole thing a nice ""twang."" As for the alcohol... barely noticeable. More of a warming at the back of the throat. Marvelous!  M: Silky smooth. Coats the tongue very nicely. Aftertaste is sweet and pleasant, and the carbonation moves everything around just right. Not too much carbonation, but just enough to be appreciated.  D: Take it slow and savor the flavor(s). This tiny bottle was NOT enough!  Another style that I'm relatively new to, and I can already tell that this will set the standard for future encounters.

You could catch nuances of alcohol behind all of the sweet maltiness.  Taste: There was a spice that I wasn't sure about, could possibly be ginger??? Nice and yeasty with little detectable hop characteristics. The sweet malts sum it up for me.  Mouthfeel: One of, if not the lightest bodied 9% beers I have ever had.

Appearance: The pour is dark-brown with red hues around the edges. There are lively bubbles and an off-white 2 cm head that stays around for a while but then settles into a nice layer of creamy foam. Some lacings.  Smell: Aromas of dark fruits, primarily cherries, are present. There is also a smell of wood, and a slight sting of alcohol hits the nose.  Taste: This is amazing and clearly triumphs the smell of the beer. Up front are tastes of ripe fruit - cherries and apples - and raisins. Perhaps, there are also some notes of spices here. The malts provide a sweetness to the brew. A slight bitterness accompanied by pleasant alcohol characterizes the finish. Towards the end the alcohol becomes more prominent.  Mouthfeel: The beer is medium-bodied. Carbonation is lively and the bubbles coupled with the creamy foam provides a nice mouthfeel.  Drinkability: Very good.

It came as part of a holiday gift pack, purchased in December of 2007, consumed in January of 2009, so it's at least 1 year old. Bottle's been in my DBF probably for at least 3-4 months, maybe longer. . . .  A: Poured from the 33 cl bottle into a Chimay chalice. Holy cow there are a lot of chunks! Not particles, not sediment -- chunks. There's no way to decant this to avoid getting floaties, as they're everywhere and at times large chunks flow forth. The body is dark brown, with a lot of sediment and floaties in suspension. A small off-white head settles quickly, though it's reinforced with some rising bubbles.  S: At first it's not too strong -- ripe apples and fruit in general come to mind. As it warms, however, there's more -- raspberries and dried fruit and alcohol. At times it reminds me of a fruity, light red wine.  T: Follows the nose pretty much. Fruit and raisins and molasses in the body, with a hint of spice and then a drying finish from the alcohol at the back end. Warmth from the alcohol is felt in the belly. As it warms, I get berries and some sugary sweetness even more.  M: Light and spritzy. I write the word ""airy"" to describe the feel, which is affected by the very active carbonation. Call it medium-bodied, though it really feels even lighter in some ways.  D: Very good, especially for a 9% ABV beer. Sweetness is cut by alcohol, which is dry, not hot.  Notes: A good drink, but I expected a bigger body for some reason. An easy drinker and plenty of flavor, but I was surprised by the lighter heft and body of this one.  ***Edit, 1/3/11***  Last week, thanks to MRMOJORISIN, I had the pleasure of sampling the ""millenium"" version of this - a 1.5 liter bottle with a 2000 sticker on it. Afterwards, we sampled a ""new"" bottle. I for one concluded that the 10 year old bottle was preferrable. The smell was very pleasant - toffee malt with grapes that reminded me of red grape juice.

Little to no lacing remained as I drank.  The nose hits very smooth and subtle, and smelled of mixed berries, mild cheese, and a little hazelnut.  This beer fills the mouth, and sparks the tongue into life with its dancing bouquet of nuts, spices, and a hint of filet mignon. The swallow gives away the true nature of this beer: subtlety. Never does this beer overpower, and I expected it to hit me on the swallow, but instead it finished clean, smooth and sparkly with a distinctly understated flavor.  When I poured the bottle into the glass, I emptied the yeast at the bottom, and though it was not recommended to do that by the brewers, I found that it had no major affect on the beer.

It's a rhetorical question dufus...  Appearance: Poured into a chalice (what else?) Chimay Grande Réserve anno '99 delivers a turbid, deep burnt umber colour along with a extremely thick and majestic beige ""latte"" crown which diminishes in a slow pace. The carbonation is vividly appearant for a beer this age, like a maelstrom of small bubbles raising to the surface. and overall it's just magnificent (for a beer that is)!  Smell: Deliciously sweet, plenty of dark fruits, mainly: plums, raisins and cherry in a bold fashion along with a round rum-like scent of alcohol.  Taste: Sweet and pleasingly poised with the aforementioned aromas - and ever so nutty/musky! I've had me a few of this perticular brew before (and I'll most definetly will do so again) but I never felt that nut-sensation so upfront, possbily the age...

Drinkability: This just HAS to be the closest one could come to the ultimate beer, nah what am I saying - it IS the ultimate beer!

T: Dark fruits--mostly raisins and figs-- are predominate. Also a lot of spiciness present. M: Good and thick but not sticky. An alcohol bite at the end, but it mixes well with the spiciness.

Pours a nearly opaque oak, though some carbonation is visible in the glass and toward the edges the colour softens to copper. Several fingers of white, bubbly fizzy head develop then sink to a ring. Bare amounts of lacing left on the glass.  Smells of alcohol, light fruit, plum, with a bready malt backbone.  Taste is remarkably complex, it seems each sip brings something else out. Alcohol dominates early on, but warms more than it burns. Fruit flavours (light: banana and peach, dark: plum and cherry) sweeten the palate. Slightly sweet bread and yeast flavours form a nice backdrop. Some medicinal flavours are tasted early on, but mellow out toward bubble gum as the beer warms.  Surprisingly light in the mouth, with nice bubbly carbonation. Clean and crisp finish that is only slightly dry.  The alcohol isn't hidden, making this a definite sipper, though the light and bubbly body makes this one fairly easy-drinking.  Wow, what a beer. Big and complex, a real experience to drink. Something to savour. I'll have to put a few in cellar and see where they go. Can't recommend this beer highly enough.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Faint bubble gum.  T: Complex, yet no single flavor dominates. Dark cherries are certainly noticable. Caramel and phenols also present. Hops are there in the aftertaste. Dark fruit character lingers on after beer is swallowed. Yeast is more fruity than spicey.  MF: Light bodied. A very dry finish. Impressive how such a strong beer can be so light.  D: Hard to review, but easy to drink. Complex to the hilt, but all the flavors work harmoniously. Never becomes overly alcoholic or harsh.

215,2512,BarkingLeopard,4.58,"Had the July 2008 vintage on Christmas Eve 2008, from a 750 mL bottle split among family.  This is my first Trappist beer and my first of this style and brand, and it certainly won't be the last. The appearance and smell were both good, but the taste... oh, the taste!  There was an element to the taste, something that I just can't put a finger on at all to describe. This element was something that was just on another level, and was not something I ever thought I'd get from a beer, something that is more at home with an exceptional bottle of fine liquor. When combined with the extreme smoothness of the beer, this element of the flavor alone would make me buy the beer again, even if there weren't so many other facets of flavor to appreciate...  Absolutely phenomenal taste, and a beer that non-beer-geeks can also enjoy (though perhaps not appreciate quite as much). This is something that I'm going to buy in the future in place of a bottle of fine wine for hostess gifts or cocktail parties.  Just how good is this stuff? Let me put it this way: I have an uncle who is NOTORIOUS in the family for being very cheap and never picking up his part of the bill, and who (while interested in decent beer) isn't a beer geek at all. At the liquor store Christmas Eve, however, he never hesitated as he reached past the $13 price tag and grabbed a 750 mL bottle of this stuff.

Smell: Bready, yeasty malt with faint hints of clove, toffee, caramel, and molasses-like sweetness.  Taste: Malty, wholesome yeast, yet spiced. Just a bit of sweetness rounded out with the consistency of carbonated brandy. Ends on a slightly bitter note. Truly the standard by which other Belgian Strong Dark Ales are judged.  Overall: I can never get enough of this stuff. It is, for me, the quintessential Belgian brew.  I'm cellaring a bottle of Chimay Bleue every year (for that year's vintage). hopefully I'll be able to crack the 2007 bottle in 20 years or more and review how that turned out.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Pours a deep golden brown, and includes a light tan head that's slightly darker around the edges. Dark, Strong, and Belgian in appearance indeed.  Not much smell at first, though that may be due to a somewhat clogged nose. The overall sweetness comes through, with tones of raisins and generic dark malts, but I'm unable to distinguish any other familiar scents - absolutely unique, but doesn't lead me in any sure directions as far as predicting the actual taste. Again, a runny/clogged nose may be my own shortcoming, here.  The taste is heavenly. Sweet, deep notes of pure cane sugar, molasses, and an ever so subtle hint of vanilla, with banana-type bitter and apple-type tart - incredibly balanced and well-rounded. Doesn't get much better.  Neither springy nor thick in the mouth, leading to a less-than-prime mouthfeel, but incredibly smooth and satisfying, with a great sweet and bitter aftertaste with a hint of saltiness that leaves me rather speechless.

An eggshell white head of a finger or so that stays for a minute and dwindles to a thin coating over the cloudy dark mahogany brew. Spots of lace to tag the glass. Some carbonation is evident but it is gentle.  Smell is an intoxicating blend of raisins, molasses, alcohol, figs, and roasted malt. A hint of clove and white pepper. Apples and grape peek in and out. Banana in the back. You could sniff all day and discover new scents each time as it develops as it warms.  Taste is as good as it gets. All of the players from the nose with the addition of anise and a touch of licorice. Hops cut the fruits short and lead to a drying finish. Licorice makes a comeback on the palate and blends with dark whole grain breads and a soupcon of alcohol heat to warn you of the power of this exceptional brew.  Mouthfeel is silky and sweet to the tongue. A touch of cream in the carbonation. The dryness of the finish adds a quenching aspect that draws you back for more. Just superb.  Drinkability is better than a beer of this abv should be. Of course part of it is you just want to keep drinking it to pleasure the taste buds. Still it goes down way too easy.

Darker fruits also came through which overall, created a sweet aroma.  The taste of this beer was superbly friendly. Yeast, apricots, and grapes came through, which in combination, created a sweet, yet tart flavor. However, to balance out the sweet flavors, there was a slightly funky taste.

215,2512,vikingmike,4.92,"I finally thought I should get around to reviewing my old standby, Chimay Blue. In Japan, this beer is probably THE most accessible of the Belgians (with Duvel a close second). You can pretty much buy this anywhere. Its also relatively reasonable...9 dollars for 750ml.  Appearance: Caramel brown.  Smell: Dark fruits, toffee. Grapes, with a hint of something zesty underneath that I cant quite put my finger on.  Taste: Simply excellent. More dark fruits with an enjoyable, lingering bitterness. Alcohol is very well hidden.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth and easy drinking  Drinkability: A true classic that is deserving of all the accolades it has received.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Powerful and really pleasant smell.  T: Almost exactly like the smell. A lot of spices (pepper, cloves and coriander). Some sweet dark fruits. Also, a kind of chestnut taste.  M: mid to high mouthfeel. Very creamy, which is not really common in those kind of beers. Carbonation is mid here, exactly how it should be.  D: Extremely drinkable. Don't know what to add here.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,Rayek,4.32,"A: Deep walnut brown with good clarity for a bottle conditioned beer. Very active carbonation. Cream head is rocky and firm. Leaves a very generous lace behind.  S: Coriander and cloves dominate. There's a hint of alcohol behind that spice, plus some dark fruits.  T: Spices rule the day here. The spice theme from the nose follows into the flavor. Coriander, pepper and clove flavors give this beer quite the bite. The sweetness of grapes and black cherries holds things together into the dry and spicy finish.  M: Medium-heavy body feels somewhat slick on the tongue. Carbonation level is right where it should be.  D: Those monks know what they're doing. An excellent beer that's best consumed in small doses. Definitely worth a revisit down the road.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Taste also has common Belgian dark taste but its not super up front like you often find it to be. Some dark fruit flavor (dark cherry, etc). Its subdued and doesn't linger long. Its sort of a dry taste, like a dry brute champagne. Its nice that its not too overwhelming. A bit boozey. Mouth is crisp and very carbonated. Dry champagne feeling, again.

215,2512,mbrasi,4.55,"Bottles on March of 2007. Just got around to popping this for the first time today. I thought that this brew ages well so I'm in no hurry to try it out. Well the curiosity got to me tady after staring at this brew for the past 6 months. Appearance is nice deep mohagony with little floaties suspended thoughout. Head is medium to large at first but then dissipates to a clean lace of small bubbles not lacy though. Smell is fantastic floral with spice and a yesty smell that is kind of subdued for many Belgians (too much yeast is a turn off for me along with an ugly face and an annoying laugh).  Taste is great what a great balance of spice, alcohol and malt. Finish is amazingly smooth and clean; a miracle for a beer of this dominant flavor profile. Mouthfeel is equally fantastic medium feel, carbonation, and coating in the mouth. Unbelievable...Not heavy enough for the beer drinker to get sick of it. Just enough to make you want more without being watery. That also sums up the drinkability. What a quality brew, I'm getting more of this one, this one will be aged.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Oh that fruity belgian aroma; bit of alcohol and yeast in the nose.  Taste is excellent, to me pretty bitter at first. Then comes a caramel sweetness and a great malt presence, with some spiciness as well. Aftertaste of roasted coffee, hint of chocolate. Not as grape- or wine-like as I expected, but there are some heavy dark fruit flavors. Extremely fine carbonation, very nice. Slippery, rich mouthfeel. Pretty much a winner in every way, though not as complex as some other strong and dark belgians I've tried.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Something in the aroma reminds me of cinnamon danish! Just a hint of estery yeastiness.  The mouthfeel is light and carbonation medium. Just a bit of alcoholic bite to it.  Taste is very malty, almost brown ale like, but with a sour bite to it. Bitterness is minimal. Bitterness and roastiness help to round out the flavor for an extremely balanced beer. Aftertaste reminds me of some flavor in whiskey! Not sure what this is though.  Drinkability is awesome. Each taste leaves me wanting more, just to figure it out.

The reason I went though was particularly for this beer.  Served at cellar temperature, and slowly decanted into a Chimay chalice to avoid pouring the yeast. A good inch of tan foam with a hint of ruby clings to the side of the glass, and settles down to one half-to-three quarters inch to sit like a rock. The smell is a bouquet of fresh fruit--pear, plum, fig...very complex. Some alcohol is detectable as it warms...So many different things going on with the taste, it is hard to pick them all out...very velvety mouthfeel that just slides on down...alcohol is barely detectable.

I really have learned to appreciate the Belgians beers and thank a buddy Brad for allowing me to taste his Chimay Blanche the other day. I really enjoyed it. (on a later date had my own and will review that shortly) Anyway, I had reviewed Chimay Red early in my involvement in this site and didn't like/appreciate it, at all.  I'll fix that.  Time for an experience with the Chimay Grand Reserve. I really enjoyed it.  It came with the proper Chimay glassware to ensure the proper experience. The head was creamy and off white to tan in color. Pours a dark brown with reddish highlights. Really dark. Not a great deal of lacing.  Aroma was fruity and deep. Some dates, pears, plums and raisins. Get a sense of the malt grains as well.  The flavor really showcased the malt and was rather interesting. Back and forth between some caramel/biscuit notes and the strong dark fruits. The same ones mentioned above with some real date/plum flavors. Pretty deep stuff. This is one that the slower you drink it the more you figure out. I figured out I like it.  Mouth feel was a little thick and a touch sticky. But neither were really negative characteristics. Drinkable in a ""must savor"" kind of way. I'll definitely have this again and really enjoyed it.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Appearance: The body has a beautiful deep dark brown colored body with dark ruby highlights and a slightly hazy body. The head builds up tall and thick with an abundance of small tiny, tight packed bubbles. It has a creamy off white color and good retention as it slowly settles down to a light thin covering. Lacing is very slick and minimal.  Smell: The aroma has an intoxicating mix of sweet malt, earthy yeast and dark fruity esters.  Taste/Mouth feel: Ageing only adds more complexity and character and each sip will reveal different flavor notes. To start there is a nice lightly roasted, almost smoky malt with different layers of dark fruits that is revealed as it warms. Plums, figs, dates, dark and golden raisins are some fruits I noted and all is surrounded buy the presence of a pleasant warming port like alcohol.

Not the best aspect of this brew, but okay.  Fruity booze soaked fruit, plum raisin, dry tobacco, sweet maltiness, spicy pepper, yeasty, caramel & toffee candy like sweetness.  Moderately carbonated, medium to full bodied, rich, chewy.  A rich Belgian strong ale. 2 bottles was a perfect sampling for 1 sitting. For me anyway.  A classic.

215,2512,SIRIUS2,4.68,"Poured from a 750ml bottle into a Chimay chalice.  Rich dark brown brew props up a beautiful off-white cap of foamy bubbles at about a half inch with a reasonably careful pour. Near perfect lacing down the glass with moderate head retention.  Complexity at it's finest with swirling aromas of dark fruit, brown candy sugar, roasted malts, and a hint of caramel.  The flavors are at least as complex as the aromas but the come together in tight fusion that stays bonded through to the finish. The malts combine near perfectly with notes of fig or prune, hinting at sweetness without actually being sweet. Any hops present are for balance and are largely not noticed however the overall presence of the brew is so balanced they must be there. The finish is slightly wine like with a bit of alcohol warming on the way down. A classic.  If you haven't tried this one yet, what are you waiting for?

Caramel and brown sugar play a sweet song, written by toffee. Swirling overripe bananas dance by, barely able to stand, but still present and making a good show of it. Yeast is trying to hold them up but has been drinking Port all night and is now chewing bubblegum, trying to hide it.  Dark fruits and tasty, sweet malts dominate. Caramel and molasses. Nice spicy bite at the end. Good yeasty notes.  Nice and creamy feeling, but abit lacking, overall, in the mouth. Would benefit greatly from abit more 'oomph'.

Interesting complex flavor - definite yeasty component with some spiciness as well as fruity esters and other dark fruit flavors with sweet malt. Medium bodied, fairly light mouthfeel, an alcohol warmth going down and a fairly dry finish.  Overall, a lot going on in this beer - definitely not a session brew you will drink all night, which should be expected when reaching for a 9% quad.

Spicy with sweet caramel malts and tons of dark fruits. T- Just like the aroma tons of dark fruit in the taste (plums, raisins, figs). The sweet caramel malts are noticeable in the taste as well. Also, I was surprised by how spicy the taste was. M- Thick, creamy, rich and highly carbonated.

Initially, I wanted to have some friends over and crack my Firestone Walker 11th for this special pre-day celebration day, but because my wife isn't doing so hot at the moment and doesn't have the capacity to entertain, the 11th will be saved for another day soon!  Presented in a cute, 11.2 ounce brown bottle. The only evidence of a batch or born on date states ""L08-010"". Poured into my St. Bernardus chalice at the recommended 45 degrees.  A: Pours a super cloudy, root beer brown with a medium sized bubbled, fizzy light tan head. As the beer pours, I can hear the champagne-like fizzing. The initial foamy heads dissipates quickly leaving small eddie-like formations of tan fizzy bubble oo the surface as I type - unique.  S: Ahh yes, the lovely smell of a fine Trappist beer returns. Wonderful mix of super white bread/dough yeasts with faint hints of dark fruits and molasses. A real treat on the nose.  T/M: Champagne-like, super light body with high amounts of carbonation throughout the entire glass. Interestingly Light bodied - yet complex variety of flavors including molasses, black licorice, figs and an almost root beet/sassafras quality - a real treat on the palate. Per the label, 9% ABV, but where is it? Ahh, there it is... toward the bottom of the beer, the warmth from the alcohol shows up. I can see how this one would improve with age now...

215,2512,bluemoonswoon,3.14,"11.2oz bottle poured slowly into a St. Bernardus (the blasphemy [SP?] !?!!?!!?!) goblet.  A: Slightly chill hazed, slight bit of sediment made its way into the beer, but otherwise clear and dark, sort of cola-like with just as much head and just as lasting. Sort of dissapointed with the look of this one so far.  S: Doughy sweetness, figs, dates, and cloves.  T/MF: Tight, prickly carbonation, full bodied but quite a bit bubbly, like champagne bubbly. Spicy, not too sweet, there is some bit of it in the close but spice and a mild alcoholic heat take up most of the stage with this beer. Bit of black pepper, more booze that I would care for in a beer. Finishes a bit grainy and leaves the tongue a bit prickly with the sides of my tongue (the sour taste buds right?) acting up.  D: I think the look of this beer may have killed the rest of the drinking experience for me, I was expecting big things and was dissapointed with the end results.  Note: I am getting frustrated with my glassware and/or the way this beer might have been sitting on the shelf for a bit too long. I've got no head and no lacing on a beer that should have tons of both. I hand washed the glass with lots of baking soda and hot water and rinsed and rinsed, still the head just evaporates. I don't think my method of washing is off because this process has worked wonders before, I just don't get what is going on here.

Pours a dark brown, deep amber color with a nice light tan color.  Aromas are of cola, breads, nuts, and a bit sweet smelling as well.  Taste is spicy and crisp up front. Then settles into creamy malts, sharp nutty and bread flavors, and finishes with a dry bitter, almost champagne like crispness. Unlike some other Dark Belgians, this one seems more bold and in your face. And that's not a bad thing... I like it.  Mouthfeel is ok, but not really what I like. It just seems too crisp and carbonated feeling. I just like this style to be a bit more smooth and full feeling.  Drinkability is good. This is an excellent take on the style. Unique, and something every beer fan should try.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

I definitely plan on drinking this beer again. ABV: 9% Serving Type: 750ml bottle poured into a wine glass.  Yes - this is a review of another beer I knew I would like. Why? Well - a number of reasons. One thing I absolutely love about beer is the story and/or process behind it. Chimay comes from a Belgium Monestary, and has been brewed by the monks since 1863 (1+8+6+3 = 18. My lucky number and Chai in Hebrew = ""Life and good luck"". Coincidence?) Anyways, Chimay was one of the first premium beers to my knowledge that started driving the prices of up - and made drinking beer, as sophisticated as drinking a fine wine. So - history lesson aside, this still truly is a great beer. Easy to drink - but don't EVER drink this from the bottle. It should still be cherished and enjoyed properly. This ain't no Budweiser (though - I do appreciate a quality Bud as well). Don't rush through this beer. Drink it slowly, but while it's still cold. Enjoy the sweet and malted scents and flavors. I have yet to meet a beer drinker that doesn't like this beer. It's pretty much a quality standard.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

A: Poured a very rich, dark brown with a finger of off white to tan head that had some decent retention to it. The head didn't last forever though, diminishing to a nice, foamy ring that left some soapy lacing. The oil slick-like consistency really coats the glass and is quite impressive.  S: Smell is of some really nice belgian yeast, roasted malt, nuts, dark, dark fruits and hint of chocolate. A touch of the booze comes across in the nose but it is a sweet booziness.  T: Taste is really nice. Yeast is there with what you expect from a Belgian style, but the roasted malt really adds some nice notes here. Vanilla, nutiness and dark fruit add some dimension in the middle. The finish is not that much unlike a thick, sweet port. Very nice indeed.  M: This has a nice, thick, oily feel that really coats the mouth allowing all of these flavors to be enjoyed. Carbonation is light but still makes the brew easy to drink and somewhat refreshing.

I figured it was my duty to pick up a bottle on the way home and pick up a bottle to write about. I remember trying this about two years ago and not liking it very much, but my palette has since grown. I popped the cork on a 750 ml. bottle and poured a good sample into a Chimay chalice that I got last year in a gift pack. There wasn't much of a head once poured; I took great care not to disturb the yeast sediment resting at the bottom of the bottle. The color was a deep, rusty orange, with very little light penetrating the chalice. The aroma was sublime with hints of dates, figs and yeast. I had read originally that this beer was once only brewed at Christmas time, which does explain why this particular ale reminds me a Barleywine. The taste is sweet, almost like port with deep fruits and a peppery aftertaste. This ale is a champion and should be enjoyed as often as possible.

I drank this for the first time out of a chimay glass. Thanks to my brother for being a giant beer expert and having such handy things just lying around...Anyway when i drank this for the first time i wanted to cry. it was one of the best things i have ever tasted. It was so flavorable and balanced. To me....i could drink 3 750's of this and be a very happy boy. The next day all i wanted to do was drink another one. I jones for this beer everyday i am alive, I feel like a crackhead  This beer was the muse that made we want to learn more and more about beer, and never ever drink a domestic macro brew for the rest of my life.

215,2512,Haybeerman,4.43,"A: Deep, lightly clouded chestnut brown. Thick coarse light-colored chestnut head that fills half the glass settling to a quarter inch holding throughout. No noticeable lacing.  S: Sweet, bready, dark mats; not roasted, more nutty. No noticeable hops, maybe the alcohol aroma masks it - that was more distinct as it warmed.  T: Creamy and yeasty dark fruit (like dates and plums) and nut flavors. Hops are subdued at best. Pleasantly warming finish.  M: Thick, phenolic, mediciny taste follows full body. Carbonation in nice balance to taste.  D: Wow! Don't know about drinking a lot, but complexity, warming finish could take me well beyond what is reasonable to drink in one session.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

215,2512,katan,3.47,"11.2 oz labeled 07-261  A - Pours a hazy light chocolate brown color. Lots and lots of head formed. Dissipating very quickly. The head is awfully dark as well.  S - Yeast dominates the nose in my mind - with a little bit of a grainy earthy aftersmell in the background. Can detect a little of the phenolic notes that are present with a high ABV beer such as this.  T - Starts out a fairly mild sweet malty note. The mid stream has a hair of balancing bitterness, but still awfully sweet. Finishes with a combination of caramel and raisin flavors.  M - The carbonation is strong in this one. As you swish it around, it has a hair of that sting. Once the CO2 has been squeezed, its much more creamy.  D - Halfway through the bottle I would have to say that this one is sitting heavy in my stomach. Just too carbonated. Couple that with the high ABV, and I may not find this that easy drinking.  Not a bad beer at all, just had a few characteristics that bugged me. Worth trying.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,WillieMoe,4.32,"A- Pours a dark-reddish color, with a nice foamy, off-white, head.  S-There's a lot going on in the scent. Primarily I pick up dark fruits,like maybe raisins or dates and cherries (are cherries considered dark? perhaps just misunerstood?). But there is a bready malt undertone present as well, that comes out more as it warms.  T&M- Has almost a roasted, nutty wood flavor mixed in with heavy fruit taste. Has some dark beer quality,with it's roasted malt flavor. Balanced well. The alcohol is for the most part mild, but shows up more as it warms. Goes down pretty smooth as the alcohol remains subdued and does not detract away from the drinking experience. Good work Belgium! I could see drinking this quite a bit, down the road.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,Gambrinus1184,4.55,"Poured from a 750 mL corked bottle into a textured crystal wine glass. Many thanks to Durge and ohoove for sharing libations!  A: Poured a slightly clouded ruby brown color with a thin veil of off white foam.  S: Smell is an interesting bouquet of lush red fruits like cherry, plum, dates and aromatic Belgian sugars.  T: Taste is fruity, sweet and delicious, with a distinct oak wood characteristic. The lush fruits combined with sweet Belgian sugars give this dark ale a really nice, mellow flavor that warms and satisfies. Dates, figs and plum rule the front palate, before a slight wooded smokiness imparts to a semisweet and dry fruity finish.  M: Mouthfeel is medium bodied and a tad chewy.  D: Not one to have everyday, though that'd be great, though probably best suitable for an after dinner cordial or special occasion. Beware the 9% ABV; your brain will crave more, but you body will get you for it later.  Split this between friends, and you'll be the hit of any shindig. Chimay Grande Reserve is the most complex of the Chimays I've tried, however the Dubbel remains a notch higher in terms of drinkability. Great brew, nonetheless.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Pours a dark brown with ruby hues and is topped off with a prolific off-white head that recedes slowly and leaves a thin skirt of lacing behind, while the carbonation works itself out fairly actively. Smells of grapes, plums, raisins, yeasts, sweet bread, chocolates and caramel. Most apparent to the palate are the fruits, chocolates and spices. In the background lurks some esters, malts, hops, and a bready sweetness. A good hint of alcohol heat finishes things off. Mouth-feel is medium to full-bodied and the active carbonation makes it a bit crispier than expected, but a little creaminess still exists.

215,2512,MrIncognito,4.65,"750ml bottle, poured into a tuliped wine glass. This has been cellared now for over 7 months.  A - Big fluffy tan head sits atop a reddish-brown mahogony brew. Carbonation does not appear too visible unless held up to a light. Transparent but dark and hard to see through.  S - Toasted wheat bread with a malty back. Dark ripe fruits (plums and raisins). Sweet alcohol comes in on the back end, but not as strong as I thought it would come through.  T - Where to begin.... Great dark malt flavor followed immediately by a smooth, sweet candy sugar with alcohol following all that carries the taste of rum-soaked raisins. A nice sherry-like flavor lingers with the capability of developing a port-like flavor. The alcohol isn't nearly as pronounced as I expected. Perhaps the alcohol has mellowed during cellaring. Incredibly complex, the beer blows my mind. The beer changes flavors from the initial sip to the last as it warms.  M - Moderate carbonation that keeps this beer smooth yet has a slight drying effect. Slippery from the alcohol, this goes down easy.  So very good! I just love how different this is from any other beer I've had. Has some of the same malty characters as the Rochefort 8 but this has more of vinous, wine-like addition. A great dessert beer that I could sip all night.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

The foam dissipates a bit, but a good half-finger lingers until the glass is empty. Smells of bready, tangy yeast, banana, sweet malt, some caramel, and spice. Flavors of dark, slightly toasty malt up front followed by spiciness. Very light hints of fruit later on. Strong metallic phenols lead to a tongue-curling finish. As it warms it tastes more and more like cola. The alcohol is well masked, with only a slight warming sensation as it goes down. Pleasant feel.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Some say that it is a shadow of its former self- I can't say for sure one way or another, as it has simply been too long since I've had some. I will say that I think it may lack a little sweetness and depth I thought it once had, but whether that is me or the beer I simply can't say. Pours a hazy brown with a decent head. Aromas of spicebox, alcohol, cream, and dark fruit. Not quite seemless, and the alcohol heat is definitely there. The taste is a bit deper, with some breadiness added to the equation and the flavors are more flawlessly integrated than the aromas as well. Nice mouthfeel with a bit of creaminess. Nice, but I think I prefer most of the other Trappist quads at this point over this beer.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

I've had some other belgian strong dark ale's that a really strong anise flavor that really turned me off, but not so in this one. Taste is amazing! Mouthfeel is smooth and moist, not harsh or bitter in the least. Finish is nice, doesn't linger any longer than necessary. This beer totally surpassed my expectations.

Aromas start off smooth and creamy caramel like, raisins and other dark fruits, a vinous alcohol note with a very mellow phenolic ester overtone. On the palate, there's a dense malty sweet flavor that nearly coats the mouth, while nowhere near cloying. Some spicy alcohol notes blend well with the creamy Munich malt flavors. The finish is big and malty but with just enough bitterness to keep it away from being sweet. Carbonation is medium high, could be a touch higher. Overall, this is such a classic beer, perhaps only the second or third time trying, and one I hope to duplicate with my homebrew.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

I also had ample occasion during my visit to sample Chamay from other taps and often from the bottle. This is an excellent brew with a deep color, spicy/hoppy flavors, a nice full-bodied texture, excellent head (some may say excessive - required a knife to crop it off, but I loved it) and a full 9% alcoholic delivery.  I've noticed some difference in freshness and/or quality between the Chamay I've sampled from the US bottled vs. that at the Delerium (but I am a new convert to the Belgians and whatever I can get in the US is still FINE). These Belgian beers are unlike any other, and require an open mind to appreciate the taste but they are of excellent quality and produce a thoughtful, present-tense, pleasant sensation.

Beer itself is very cloudy and brown with no lacing.  Smell- Big 'ol Chimay bready yeast and darker malts but not so much roast. Hops are hardly detectable. Nuances are hard to come by here and the temperature is not a factor.  Taste- Creamy and yeasty with fruity under notes of dates, prunes, and fig. Hops are subdued at best. Warming alcohol is in with the phenols but it's welcome. Cant get past that trademark Chimay yeast too well overall.  Mouthfeel- Thick, phenolic, band-aid like and medium-full bodied.

Sweet and bready, giving way to a complex grain profile thats hard to place. Yeast is almost sour, small notes of fruit. Chewy dates, raisins and a hint of plum. Warming alcohol on the finish.  Mouthfeel is slick and full. The carbonation is soft and gives a nice fluffy feel on the tongue which blasts the sweet malt profile to the edges of the tongue and rounds out the flavor.

Off the start it's definitely a belgian, it looks great in the chalice in which it was poured. Dark; if you mixed purple, black and brown you might find this color. It had a tan/light brown head. Tasted as it smelled with dark aged fruits and spice, mostly clove, very tasty. This was rather drinkable and certainly wouldn't be offensive for even the unexperienced palate. A very high gravity feeling though. It wasn't quite my style. It reminded me of a lighter colored unibroue (which creates belgian style ales). Although I've seen and tried this style, this was my first actual belgian trappist ale. I have more belgians sitting in my fridge (westmalle, st. bernardus). I look forward to them but hope that belgian beers have more versatility, because this sorta gave me what I might have thought it would taste like... it did not deceive my pre-concieved notions.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Pours dark brown with a coca-cola like head that disappears in a phrasing sound. Not very much lacing. An aspect of the old age is that I actually can see some yeast gatherings that I don't remember seeing swimming around in a glass of fresher newer Chimay Blue.  Extraordinary smell of sherry, currants and dark fruits like plums, black currant and wine. Actually I can't tell if I ever had a beer with so great nose before.  The plums are there again in the taste and it is the fruits that dominate. With some malts in the background. Actually the complex taste is almost hard to put your finger on since the mouthfeel is so total. A presence of rough acidic bitterness fills my oral cavity with pleasure.

One-finger almond-colored head at the beginning; a wispy covering later on. This leaves no lacing on the glass.  Smell: Dark and malty, with some faint floralness in the background. There is also a fruity sweetness in the aroma, and some alcohol.  Taste: Sweet (but not too sweet) malts, a very subdued bitterness (really more of a tang), and something a little like cherries lurking in there. Wonderfully balanced. There is a definite hop presence here, but far from the forefront; somehow the actual taste of the hops themselves comes through more than any bitterness imparted by them. The alcohol lends some sharpness to the flavor, and is quite warming. This beer is rich but never cloying or saccharine, and it holds many shades of taste.  Mouthfeel: Silky and smooth.  Drinkability: I could drink this all day. It never gets tiresome. Just got to have a care for that alcohol percentage, though!

Tremendous mouthfeel...one of the best. Lovingly coats the tongue and taste matures and changes wonderfully after the beer has been quaffed. D: Extraordinarily drinkable. ABV is well hidden. A wonderful example of trappist beer. Complex with exemplary mouthfeel and drinkability. I get the sense (from talking to people in general and not from the ratings on this site) that this beer is not as well respected as other trappist beer; and I feel that is more due to the fact that this is the most available trappist beer than any actual experience from tasting.

Not a lot of carbonation, which is not surprising in a beer of this age.  The aroma is peppery and sweet.  The flavor is sadly a little corky, but this didn't ruin the beer. The typical fruitiness of ""blue label"" seems to have faded away with the years, but the sweetness remains. And there's that peppery flavor again. Nice. There's also a hotness which I can't nail down to either alcohol or spice, but it's there and enjoyable.  The lack of carbonation rendered this one a little still in the mouth, which didn't do it any favors.  Amazing that this held up so long and still retains its essential character.

Lot's of delicious looking yeast flakes float around like Christmas in Illinois 2008.  Smell: Malty, strong smell of baked bread, fruity - cherries  Taste: It doesn't have much of a taste initially; more of a feel. Strong malt taste along with either plum or cherries or both. After finish reminds me of original flavored bubble gum and finally a slight alcoholic aftertaste. I like the malts.  Mouthfeel: I think this might be the lowest quality of this beer. Not horrible, just didn't feel well in my mouth. Starts off warm and tingly like Ron Jeremy in many of his films.  Drinkability: Expensive to drink.

215,2512,cvstrickland,4.08,"750 ml bottle poured repeatedly into a Chimay chalice yields a deep reddish-brown amber body with a swirling tornado of tiny roiling bubbles that feeds a creamy off-white head of two fingers. Nice retention at a chunky sheet that leaves thick, webby lacing.  Smells immediately fruity; black grapes, raisins, with a sugary malt background. Hints of tart cherries and brown bread.  Taste is an evolving experience as the brew warms (as does the drinker). Dark fruit and alcohol announce their presence right away, balanced by a nice twang of yeast and an earthy note. An antiseptic quality vanishes as the beer continues to un-chill, bringing forward a deep, rich, brown sweetness (yes, ""brown sweetness""), and a light finishing bitterness that helps keep the drink from being too sweet and fruity.  Just about perfect in the mouth. Medium-heavy and syrupy, cut to perfect quaffability by active carbonation that is really fun to look at in the glass.  My first Trappist offering, and now I want to try all the rest. A renowned beer, not necessarily my favorite flavors or style, but certainly well-done and very impressive.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,chinabeergeek,4.23,"re-review with 750ml bottle, cork dated 11/07:  there is much more lacing this time, which warrants a change from 3.5 to 4.5 on the appearance score. other aspects remain about the same.  paired with blue cheese, cheddar, and pan-seared ham with dijon mustard, not surprisingly also brings up overall drinkability a full point (partly to compensate for the fact that the taste score should be something like 4.2)  it also helps that i've now managed to find a way to purchase it directly from the importer here in china at a slightly cheaper price.  review from 12/20/2007:  brought back a small bottle from a belgian beer bar in beijing. (how's that for alliteration?) poured into chalice.  pours a dark, reddish brown, decent head, but in time fades to a thin layer of wispy beige foam. not too much lacing though.  nose brings an instant whiff of fruits, ranging from apple, cherry, to raisin. hints of spice (cinnamon) and bread/yeast.  tastes fruity, hints of cherry, before slightly burnt caramel comes through, followed by a steady but not overwhleming bitterness. alcohol isn't too noticeable, but is there if you really look for it.  creamy when rolled on the tongue. otherwise slightly thin, but not watery.  enjoyable, but not sure if entirely worth the price. again - look out, as you might not notice the 9% ABV",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Smell is that of fruit and light malt. Alcohol smell is more of a wine than most beers. Slight scent of various spices.  Carbonation is crisp, but compliments heavier fruit like flavors. Good combination of sweet and spiced flavors.  Mouth feel is crisp and dry. The sweet and spiciness hits your tounge the different time.  Truly a brew to savor and enjoy.

Taste: Sweetish maltiness with flavors of dark caramel compounded by a spicy dark candi sugar taste. Hint of breadcrusts. Growing plum and black cherry fruitiness. Spoonful of simple syrup. Slight savory yeastiness. Spice and a medium bitterness try to bring a bit of balance. Drying, cherry-packed finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium-full body. Moderate carbonation.

Very good flavor, can barely taste the high alcohol content.  Mouthfeel is very balanced, no strange aftertaste and just the right amount of carbonation.

Carbonation clings to glass, similar to champagne. Head has life of its own from carbonation.  A great deal of yeast with a faint touch of alcohol. Some ginger, more sarsparilla. A little tin; needs warmth. There's a hint of salt - similar to a club soda scent.  Very clean - a little glove leather, some husky braised/boiled malt; alcohol accompanied with mild spice. Again, some salt in context with carbonation - leathery baked apple feel. This is a bit more mild than expected.  Slightly unbalanced mouthfeel - heavier than expected with carbonation. Needs a little more chemistry. Not what is expected but still pleasant.  By no means unenjoyable - a complex effort. Heavier than desired for mild flavor profile. Definitely sippin' material.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Poured into a normal glass (again, limited by the constraints of studying abroad) which generated a solid two-finger head. Good retention.  S: A tangy mix of fruits mingled with some yeasty notes; malt is also discernable.  T: Reflective of the smell; again, tangy and sweet with strong, dark fruity notes. A tang of bitterness towards the middle. When first poured, the 9% alcohol was easily tasted, but as the beer warms, the alcohol taste becomes less obtrusive and more enjoyable.  M: Crisp carbonation, yet smooth going down. The carbonation leaves a lingering tingling sensation on the tongue.  D: I could probably have a couple of these, but the alcohol content and the overall complexity of this beer would deter me from multiples in one night. Pleasant experience overall; very enjoyable and good for savoring.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Spicy aroma, dark fruit and clovey yeast product. One sided and a little wimpy.  The flavor is heavier on the fruits, like rum currant, some sweetness with good viscosity. Prickly pepper alcohol is all over it, especially in the finish. It's either not as good as I remember, or more likely, it was among the very first strong Belgians I had.  Unimpressed with the mouthfeel, fairly light with just a ton of carbonation.

Poured a brilliant black cherry color with a minimal head but no big deal. Nose had a pleasent dried fruit quality with a mild malts. Tastes was smooth and luscious for a 9 ABV beer with raison notes and a great hop malt balance. I won't get tired of this beer any time soon.,Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

It has an alcohol taste that isn't huge or overwhelming but one that mixes quiet well with the malts and dried fruit flavors. has a lighter version of a soda pop fizz one might find in store brand sodas. Still quiet smooth! Been awhile since I've had this beer. Always a great choice! My mouth says ""drink all day"" but my brain knows how fast that 9% catches up with you.

Carried atop this note is symphony of sweet malts which progreesivley get heavier, almost to dopplebock proportions.

This may be blasphemy, but the bottle clearly calls for a goblet, and this is the only one I have.  Not much in terms of head. Very thin layer that quickly dissolved.  It smelled of sweet, dark fruits.  Taste is phenomenal. I mostly detect raisin and plum. Very, very sweet beer, but the sweetness is not overwhelming.  Halfway through the bottle, I read this beer pairs wells with sharp cheddar cheese, which I just happened to have in the fridge. I now feel obligated to review the cheese well!!  This is such a nice, sweet, smooth brew. It will definitely become a regular in my fridge.  Added 4/17/2008 - This brew continues to be one of my favorites.

A hint of maple, with fruity berries throughout.  Taste: Sweet, fruity with a touch of bitter in the middle. I'm picking up some barrel aged notes. Alcahol warming at the swallow, this is the closest beer to wine I've ever tasted.  Mouthfeel: Zingy bubbles, a good pounding from the carbonation up front, but it quickly melts away. Medium bodies with lingering liquid after the swallow.  Drinkability: Its definatly a sipper. I sould have poured it into a merlot glass instead of a pint glass.

That cork was very tough to get out due to how long it had been sitting in this bottle.  Poured into a Chimay Goblet.  Appearance - Poured a dark brown with a nice thick creamy tan head. Decent lacing.  Smell - First thing that comes to mind is that this beer smells like a really good Port Wine. Smells of grapes, raisins, and caramel. I can't stop sniffing this beer.  Taste - The taste comes in waves. Brandy, caramel, raisins, and yummy belgian yeast. The alcohol has been subdued by the aging process and the flavors are much more pronounced than in a non aged Chimay Blue. This is one of the best beers I have tasted. The aging has done wonders to this beer. I rank it up there with the Westvletern 12.  Mouthfeel - There are waves of bubbles. The amount of carbonation is intense but it adds an amazing sensation to drinking this beer.  Drinkability - I would drink this every day if I could. I am going to start aging my own ASAP and just wait for the goodness that will be there in the next 5-6 years. This is one amazing beer and if you ever get the chance to have one aged this long do it, no matter what the cost. You will not regret it.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

The alcohol level is so subdued, yet the balance of malts and yeast were perfect. The touch of spice and the fruitiness seemed to join forces to arouse the senses. It was sweet, but with a bit of light bitterness. It felt light,medium carbonation and crispy. So high in alcohol and yet so smooth. As it warms the flavors really come out, the creaminess and the all the other wonders of this Ale are revealed.  Note: This beats wines worth twice the dollar amount.

The other two Chimay beers I've had have been neck-to-neck, so will the blue label break away from the pack? Find out after the review:  Poured into an oversized wine glass, this beer is dark brown, alittle darker than their dubbel, with a good head like its siblings. I smell dark fruits like plums and raisins, with a hint of chocolate. Taste: Holy Shit! It melts in your mouth like warm butter. Ahhh! Liquid ecstasy! Mild tone of carbonation plays a big role balancing out the dark fruits, phenols, and other flavors. I'd go as far as saying it's comparable to a fine wine. As much press as this beer already gets, I'd say it's still underrated. Wow, I made a good call getting the larger bottle.  The moment of truth has arrived here in the Chimay invitational, and now to reveal thge wineer. The winner of the Chimay Invite goes to...  Grande Réserve!  The Chimay trilogy is complete.

215,2512,dhd1491,4.75,"This is my first review. Honestly, there are other reviewers on this site that do a much better job describing the specific attributes of this beer, so I won't try to get too fancy.  My chance meeting with Chimay Grande Reserve is why I signed up for BA membership a few days ago. I was on a Cub Scout trip with my 8-year-old to Raccoon Mountain, just outside Chattanooga. The place has some of the greatest caves in the US.  Anyway, we're out of the cave after 2 hours of crawling on our hands and knees and we're muddy and wet and hungry and thirsty. We find this place nearby called Dave's Cafe. The food is unbelievable. I don't know Dave's story, but somewhere the guy learned to cook big time.  I get the half rack of St. Louis style ribs. They are killer, but I need something to drink with them, so I ask Dave. He says this Chimay here was voted Best in the World. I say, Best in the World? Okay, I'll try it.  Holy Crap! That beer with those ribs...it was like a light shone down from above illuminating my plate and glass. The rest of the world went away. God spoke to me. He said: Find out where you can get more of this beer and others that taste like it.  So that's what led me to this site and man am I excited to try some new beers. I will use Chimay Blue as the yardstick by which to measure all others.  ===  Got a 750ml bottle to reaffirm that this beer is as good as it was when I first tried it.  Brown-red color with thick beige head. Sweet with some bitter backbone. Great balance; profound flavor. This is indeed a brew for others to measure up to.  750ml bottle (25.4 oz) $12. 47 cents per oz.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,ewpgolf2,3.9,"No distinguishable stamp date on bottle. Poured into the only appropriate drinking vessel&gt;&gt;a Chimay chalice. I chilled this a little more than I usually do for Belgians but still allowed it to warm for 10 mins. prior to drinking. This poured a hazy cloud with the color of cherry wood. I never got much of a head, which even that, dwindled down to a thin film. I sensed a sweet burning aroma-like that of raw cane. The 9% ABV is almost nonexistant until the taste which doesn't overpresent itself. Just a side note here; I've enjoyed the stronger dark ales for years and have always found something different within the same beer no matter how many times I drink them. BUT, this Chimay Blue has always been predictable. The taste is incredibly consistent which is pleasing and merits revisiting a 2nd/3rd bottle in one sitting. If you could take caramel liqueur and simulate it into a beer; this is what you end up with. The aftertaste is a little sticky but pulls you in to wanting more.

Spicy smell, malty taste with a hint of alcohol but the alcohol taste didn't linger. Usually with a beer this dark it takes me a few sips to get ""used to it"" but this beer was instantly in tune with my palette.  After drinking a third of it my fish and chips arrived and they went surprisingly well together. Even so I think I prefer the Red with something like fish but I'd like to try the Blue with a steak or stew sometime.  I saved the third glass for after my meal and it left me a pleasant taste in my mouth and honestly I was nicely buzzed when I left.

I had it with a nice grilled ribeye steak and the two compimented each other perfectly.  The beer poured a dark reddish/brown with a thick head. The aroma was very pleasant and the taste was perfect. You can taste the alcohol in the beer, but it is not overwelming. For a beer with 9 percent ABV, this is a very drinkable beer.

The first did not include any of the sediment, the second...all of it!  Super fruity and spicy aroma. Alcohol twang in there too.  Bright cherry and plum flavors. Spicy raisin too. Woody.

No lacing to speak of. Smells of ripe dark fruits, raisins, brown sugar, tarry tobacco, bubble gum, black pepper, and a barely noticeable alcohol note. Very carbonated and fizzes quite a bit when lightly swishing. Rich malt flavor that translates into plum, candied dark fruit, cola, caramel, with an alcoholic finish that seems to prevent any cloying affect from the rich maltiness. The mouthfeel has a bit too much carbonation for me but it doesn't seem too out of the ordinary for the style. This may also be part of the anti-cloying. The mild alcoholic finish is nice and warming. There is also some residual flavor and bittness in the cheeks after a few sips. I could have another and would love to pick out more flavors. Quite enjoyable and I would say drinkable for being a Belgian Strong Dark Ale. I would love to enjoy this with a nice aged blue cheese. It has the strength to cut through the sharpness and the complexity to create an interesting contrast.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

215,2512,jeonseh,3.93,"Poured from one of the short fat chimay bottles into a chimay goblet and it is from the 2005 batch.  A - the beer seems to from the bottom of the glass towards the top to be at first a deep, dark, purplish red and then it seems to lighten up as there is an deep orange hue in the middle of the beer. There is a small head that sits on the top and never formed at all. See a lot of carbonation going up to attack the head from all sides and in the middle as well.  S - Smell is a dark grape flavors, also reminds me a bit of a red wine except sweeter and not as big either. That was the prevalent smell that came to me. There was also a hint of bread in there as well.  T - Hmm there seems to be a little bit of everything in here as I get some tart citrus orange and there is also the taste of candied dates that comes in a bit later and also get a bit of a bready yeasty flavor in there as well. Get a nice taste of the alcohol in there as well and with the fruity flavors reminds me of a brandy or brandy soaked dates. The flavor could even possibly be described as rum raisin bread pudding. This gives the beer a bit of a bite in the end of the taste as the alcohol makes itself known. Everything seems to transition together well and the beer is rather balanced.  MF - The beer seemed to have a good bit of carbonation which comes on strong at the beginning and comes with the orange flavor that I found so prevalent. That carbonation really adds some zing to this beer and to the initial feeling in the mouth. It then faded away as the deeper, darker candied, alcoholic date flavor came in. The after feeling is a nice warm feeling in the mouth that just chills out there and not much else.  D- Overall a good beer but not one that really seemed outstanding. It is balanced well and would be good to grab to maybe have with some duck or a dinner party or even to pop open to have with some cheese and fruits.

Mouthfeel is smooth and full-bodied, with a hint of alcohol heat.  Drinkability is average for a strong ale.

Gyser-like bubbles rushes to the surface to create a classic, brown-tinted, tight, soft, sticky three-fingers deep head. Disspates in moderate fashion for the style but leaves plenty of surface foam.  The nose is of sour-fruity yeast, toffee and mild chocolate malt with fresh, veggie, grassy scented hop. Very sweet malt and herbal blend.  THe balance of flavors is sublime. A clean, semi-sweet malt hits first. There's a rich fruity, tanginess from the wonderful Belgian yeast. The hops come mostly in the finish with a very herbal and earthy effect. The malt is amazingly complex, sweet, then sour. Suck a long, lush and soft malt.

Deep, reddish-brown colour, two finger off-white head with surprisingly good retention.  Complex vinous smell; dried fruits, port, burnt sugar, Belgian yeast, and a touch of something I can only describe as cigarette smoke.  Incredibly complex taste! I pick up port, muscovado sugar, dried fruits (plums and particularly figs), maybe a hint of toffe. There is a certain harshness that blends with notes of yeast. Warming alcohol in the finish.

I'm puzzled-- generally this beer's flavor profile is much like its head-- tightly knit brewing. But where's the beef? I mean-- OK, it's not a stout, it's not an Ale, it's a Belgian--- but where's the flavor? I taste a hint of caramel, alcohol's dryness, and a teensy weensy peep from the yeast but maybe it's me-- nothing else to speak of. There's flavor body-- but no ""wart on the miller's nose"". There's a nice clean lasting finish, but once again, I can't coin anything that sparks my imagination-- or my accolades. When browsing the wares at my fave ""packie"" and I see this beer, will I stop and remark ""Oh that one's enjoyable"" or do I pass to the next goodie? So far I move along. I'm still straining to find something to clap my hands over... nice bottle with a cork 'n' cage.  Mouthfeel is congenial. Very nice I keep sipping and straining to taste the Belgian countryside.  Drinkability-- If I were any place other than home, I don't think I'd quaff another pint. Why bother? Well OK, if I was after the side-effects of the 9% ABV but this stuff's expensive.  Maybe the beer's too young to really flower, perhaps a few years in the cellar might suddenly unleash this beer's potential. But generally my sentiments are, ho hum and a yawn... and $11 for 750ml?

First taste, a smooth medium oily body coated the palate with a sweet caramel malty that quickly following. Cola and toffee hid well in the middle with a nutty lemony ending. The ending is accompanied by a long lasting light fruity alcohol flavor. Overall, this brew rocks. Chimay is smooth with robust flavor and aroma that makes this a dangerous brew to drink.

Smell and taste were sweet dark fruits soaked in lots of booze. Pretty standard issue for the style, but it stands out by not being overly sweet or syrupy.

Can't get enough of this stuff.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,jbphoto88,4.23,"A dark amber, the color of caramelized sugar. A soft cream colored head billows up from the beer and then is almost swallowed back into the liquid. Beautiful.  It smells of yeast, fine bread and light roasted malts.  Taste is sweet and malty with a nice warmth from the ABV. The first thing I notice is the smooth characteristics of the brew. Its nice clean and refreshing. A well polished glossy beer.  This is a good beer to have on hand year round. I'd love to try it after a year in the pantry, but who has the will power to keep a bottle of this on hand without drinking it.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,Jwale73,4.1,"Served in my Chimay chalice. Color was a dark, murky brown with burnt red highlights; definitely the darkest of the three ales. Fluffy white head subsided rather quickly settling into a thin consistent layer of foam. Ample, but light lacing with good adherence during the tasting. Immediately presents with a strong nose of dark fruit (plums, prunes, raisins). Taste similar to nose, and much more pronounced than in the Red & White. Mellow mouthfeel with just a touch of carbonation. Alcohol was very well-hidden (deceptively so), making this an extremely drinkable belgian strong. After sampling all three, Chimay Blue comes in a solid second.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,JohnGalt1,4,"11.2 oz bottle poured into my New Belgium snifter.. cost about $4.50.  Big but shortlasting head with little lacing... color is hazy dark brown/walnut.  Aroma is dark malts with caramel and dried fruits.. lightly spicy with dried sweet cherries... light cloves.  very active carbonation.. medium sweetness for the style... dark fruits dominate with light caramel.. dates and raisins come to mind although the raisin notes are lighter... spiciness is more toward the late middle to the finish... as it warms the alcohol is more evident in more spiciness.  I've always loved the blue, but I think there are much better BSDA's out there... nothing really wrong with it, just there are some better ones.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,Gehrig,4.83,"Only the small 11.2 oz. bottle was available in the several stores I checked, so I gladly grabbed a bottle of the Blue. It's nothing short of outstanding, and demands that I grab a couple more for cellaring. Three fingers of tan head rest atop the mahogany body with orange-red highlights--masterful, especially as the head proves very durable. The nose is great--apples, pears, some orange, and a good yeasty whiff. The taste is first-rate--lots of the fruit, yeast, and well carbonated to get the flavors dancing in harmony. Very good mouthfeel helps to make this incredibly drinkable, shadowing the high ABV (9%).  Easily my favorite of the three that I've tried from Chimay, Blue is stellar, a top-shelf Belgian hands down. I'll be sure to grab a couple more of these for the cellar.

If put up to light, you can see quite a bit of floating sediment as well.  S: nice floral hoppiness with caramel malt sweetness and aromas of ripe fruit.  T: floral hops and rich fruitiness up front (apples, plums, cherries, raisins) with an incredibly velvety malt sweetness on the finish and a subtle spiciness. The alcohol is very well hidden and the sweetness lingers for a long while on the palate. Nice and complex.  M: thick and rich with a good amount of carbonation. Finishes smooth and crisp.  D: An excellent sipping beer on a cold winters night. It delivers a nice array of flavours and packs a warming punch with its 9% ABV - although you would have no idea unless the label said so!

A frothy 2 finger head appears and a nice resiny white color stays on top of the beer throughout.  S- Smell was sweet. I detected some caramel notes in addition to some floral essence.

Pours a thick, foamy head leading to a dark brown, prunish appearance... taste had hints of chocolate, prunes, figs, and other dark fruits including a slight brandy flavor... Very rich and deep taste with a good mouthfeel, and a 9% ABV that is so unnoticeable that it will certainly throw you off if you're not careful...

Poured a moderate, somewhat cloudy golden colour with a fairly large, white, frothy head. Aroma was malty, mildly spicey, with slight notes of bubblegum and candi sugar. Flavour is excellent and enhanced by a fantastic mouthfeel. I've had this sitting around for quite a while, but it seemed very fresh and might even have been able to use another year or so of aging.

Sweet fades to tart at finish. Yum again.  M: Incredibly light and bright for 9% ABV, well carbonated. So clean...  D: Highly. You have no idea its packing 3x the alcohol of pre-2007 MN State Fair beer (before strong beer was allowed for sale). Yum.  So glad my bro-in-law got this for me for Christmas.

Smell: I took a few whiffs and noticed some sweet fruity smells; it has a nice aroma.  Taste: A bit stronger tasting than the Triple or the Red, but very pleasant, something nice to sip on. For some reason it reminds me a tiny (very tiny) bit of champagne/wine. Some alcohol comes out as it goes down.  Mouthfeel: Just the right amount of carbonation, refreshing to sip on.  Drinkability: With all three of these beers (Triple, Red, Blue) I could only really drink so much. They are all great but as far as having a lot of it, I can't say that I wouldn't prefer drinking a few pints of another of my favorite brews over a similar amount of the Chimay.

Pours a slightly darker chestnut brown color with a loose, full finger, light tan head that fades fairly quickly. The smell is more reserved yet deeper than the Achel ""Claus"" product that i recently sampled. Visibly effervescent, as evidenced by small pools of surface disturbance with a bit more lacing. The mouth feel is notably creamy, in the same manor as the Achel Claus. The flavor is figgy but less pronounced than expected. The 9% ABV has a warming characteristic that is more noticeable than my favorite Strong Dark Ales. The dark fruit flavor is wonderful yet less pronounced than anticipated.

The fruits and dried fruits up front seem to be a bit sweeter in the aftertaste with a alcohol kick that leaves you wanting more. Malt presence gives some chewiness, great stuff.

215,2512,SMark,4.37,I poured this beer from a 750ml bottle at 49° into what I think is a chalice glass. The beer poured with a slight effervescent head and a lot of carbonation. The beer was a medium mahogany in color.  Noticed malt aromas during the pour and confirmed that as roasted when inhaled. A syrup and candy presence was also detected. I keep trying to figure out what is in the background but cannot determine if they are spices or what. The bouquet is interesting.  A nicely carbonated malt taste hits the mouth first. I do not taste spices in the beer but am pleased with the soft fruit and sweetness detected.  This beer tingles somewhat due to the carbonation. Taste buds perk up and I am sure that those with educated palates pick up a lot from this. Sensations last a couple of minutes with a good feeling throughout the mouth.  This beer is getting better as it warms even more. More malt flavors are coming through with a somewhat pleasant syrup taste which is definitely acceptable.,Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Poured out a dark color, but more noticeable than its color was its high carbonation and frothy head. Tasted very fruity but with an alcohol and malty-sweet kick. I can't quite put my finger on what the fruits were, but it was definitely fruit-sweet with malts. It was almost wine-like in that regards.

Malty backbone here with what tastes like just enough hop presence for balance. Mild alcohol warmth pulls through at the end. As the beer warmed, some of the more pleasant flavor notes pulled through.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth.  Drinkability: The alcohol is hidden pretty well.

215,2512,albern,4.03,"This is a very nice Belgian Dubbel. The beer pours a cloudy, dark, chocolatey color with a light brown head, some retention, not much lacing. You will find that very typical yeasty carbonation from a Belgian, along with some candied sugar fermentation. The smell is okay, not all that pronounced, but you'll get the aroma of plums, cherries, spices, malts, and very typical Belgian candied sugars. The taste is very smooth, fruity, some spices, a bit tart, like green apples, but it is mostly the caramel, plum, cherry flavors that come through strongest. The down side to this beer, and it is a relative shortcoming, is that the consistency is rather light bodied for a Belgian Dubbel. I was expecting a much more robust, hearty, more syrupy beer.

215,2512,beeragent,4.04,"Poured from a bottle into a Chimay chalice. The beer pours a dark amber/brown, forming a thin white head that fades quickly. Light spots of lace on the glass. The aroma consists of a noticeable alcohol presence, yeast and spices. The taste is a complex mix of yeast, light dark fruit flavors, some spices, a good balance of hops and malts, and a light alcoholic finish. Smooth medium mouthfeel. If it werent for the high abv., this would be a great brew to drink all night. The full flavor and smooth taste make for a highly drinkable Belgian.

One also gets a hint of some fruit perhaps. Figs? Maybe grapes? Leaves the mouth crisp and tingly. The mouth feel is crisp, but like the head quickly vanishes, and becomes quite comfortable to the mouth.  Smells of some sort of fruit. The smell matches the taste.

It starts off with a good sized head that settles a top the brew. Good lacing and a deep brown color.  Smells of roasted malts, dark fruits, alcohol, yeast and spices. Everything falls into place wonderfully.  Tastes of sweet fruits with alcohol, spicy and earthy hops, strong malt presence and a warming finish.

Poured a dark mahogany with a nice billowy head, didnt leave much lacing down the glass though. Smell is of yeast, spices, figs and alcohol. Taste is of figs and raisins but has that nice alcohol burn at the end. It really surprised me. Mouthfeel was full bodied with a slight amount of carbonation. Lingered in the mouth for a while.

215,2512,mentor,4.31,"Three finger dead tan head over a cloudy dark grown-redish liquid. Smells sunflower, green raisin, fruity is mild with milder chocolate. Touch of sourish that could be alcohol playing with fruity and malty characters. Phenolic is mild because it's lost in a sea of sweetness. Deep and engaging with just the right amount of alcohol rising up to carry the aromatics. Nice honey-like character I'm enjoying.  Taste doesn't deliver what nose offers. Nice, but not stunning. Honey sweet with olifin waxiness. Drying chocolate rides a woody alcohol driness. Honestly, a touch watery. Nutty. Drying finish with a bit of woody and sun-bleached oak. Sun-baked redwood. Delicate and playrull. Not extreme in any way. Has a canola oil character to the finish that rises retronasal. Alcohol is clean and blended phenomenally well with the malt, dark sweetness. Phenols are thankfully minimal (I hate phenols) and work well with the other dimensions. Interesting transition between the sweet fruity start and dry finish.  Md-light body and fairly carbonated. Quite drinkable, not the ponder-bomb I thought it would be.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

T- Tastes like a bit of brown sugar, cinnamon and earthy fruits, the alcohol is also hidden well... pretty much gone during the exhale.

Etching in the chalice provides a thin layer of tiny bubbles.  Bread pudding, raisin, fig, some chocolate, pepper, and phenols in the nose.  Starts a little sweet with some prune, fig, and raisin. Toffee and rum flavors become apparent in the middle of the sip. The finish is bone dry with spicy phenolics tickling the palate.  Highly digestable offering.

S: Belgian yeasty smell mixed with a strong alcohol aroma. It smelled like it was going to taste fantastic.  T: A very full taste with the alcohol content masked nicely. It has an excellent mix of earthy and fruity type flavors. It has the very slightest of aftertastes which is in fact pleasant unlike many competitors.  M: Feels a little too thin in the mouth to give it an outstanding score here, but it still receives high marks due to a perfect amount of carbonation to tickle the tongue.  D: The excellent aroma and taste makes you want to go back early and often for more of this one. I could really knock these back if my wallet could take it.  This is truly a fantastic beer.

Alcohol is there, but acceptable given the other flavors. Lots of spices and maltiness.  T: Pretty good, even though I'm not a fan of this style. Very alcoholic and fruity flavor up front with a nice alkaline sub-taste. Some great plum and apple flavors after the swallow. Finishes with a bit of yeast and continuing fruit/sweet/alcohol.  M: Medium-light bodied with pretty good carbonation. A little to carbonated for me. Fairly non-astringent.  D: Still a little too sweet for me - I don't think I will buy again.

Tasted like heaven -- chocolate, plum, port, hops. I'm not sure past that -- just deliciousness. A bit too fizzy for me, though -- despite being incredibly drinkable (no idea that it's 9%), the fizz burns my throat a bit.

S: Big whack of sickly sweet malt with an off-smelling red wine aroma. This is starting to look not so good.  T: Sweet malty flavors mixed with chocolate and that off putting red wineyness.

Very thick, off-white head at first but it didnt stick around for long, a thin layer is left behind and no lace. Very deep brown, looks black in low light but more of the rich brown color. Smell is great. Smells of bread, apple, raisin, some yeast, and a little roasted grain (fruit being the dominant smell). Taste is on par with smell. Some fruits, grain, and a touch of alcohol, there is a definite earthy overall taste to it. Moderate carbonation and a somewhat creamy mouthfeel to it, leaves a relatively dry feeling in the mouth.

S: It had a strong rich aroma of roasted malts and dark grainy bread.  T: It had a complex balance of flavors that together presented a sweet warm profile that reminded me of hot chocolate with marshmallows on a cool fall night. Beyond the malty chocolates there was a distinct presence of dark sweet fruits including figs, raisins, and dates.  M: It is a full bodied brew with a sweet fruity front and nice clean back leaving a warm spicy feel in the mouth and a lingering desire for another sip.  D: It was full bodied with a smooth rich balanced presence and a clean finish. This may be best as an after dinner treat or a night cap.

On with the review,poured into my Chimay glass (what else?) a mirky reddish brown color,looks like apple cider. Has a creamy,froathy light tan head that falls into a constant creamy coating that never dies. Extremely tiny bubbles very tightly knitted togeather screaming towards the surface.

Delicate spicyness,very earthy with sweey syrupyness. Slighty tart with a touch of sourness. Finishes dry, with a warming booziness creeps up on you nicely, just enough,but not overbearing,nor does it drown out any of the other tastes of the beer. Perfect!

215,2512,BeardedSquash,4.27,"I've enjoyed this beer many a times before, but this time, I hooked myself up with a little Chimay cheese to boot. So, this is a special double review, cheese and beer.  A: Beer pours a cloudy brown red body into my wide rimmed Chimay glass (yes, I went that Chimay crazy) topped by a 1-1/2 inch light tan, silky head. The head sticks around for a few minutes, but never leaves completely, setting down into a thin lace that constantly guards the prize.  Cheese is a shiny eggshell with a hard orangish hide. Room temperature, the cheese feels semi-soft, a firmer than a cold brie.  S: Beer has big fruity esters, backed by a wave of sweet and spicy alcohol.  Cheese is big, sweaty and salty, slightly sour.  T: Dry grainy sweetness with a peppery fruit swallow. The alcohol follows through from the nose. A slight washington apple tartness presides over the whole drink.  Cheese tastes a double dose of the smell, HUGE. The sour pungency follows all the way down, clenching the tongue will only subdue it so much. By itself, a little overpowering for me.  M: Beer is crisp and dry, very refreshing. Medium/high carbonation.  Cheese is creamy and soft. Holds the flavor close to the tongue and cheeks.  D: This is a very refreshing beer. Full flavored and satisfyingly sweet, while never becoming from being overpowering.  The cheese by itself is a bit much for me. I top out at a good Stilton for strong cheese. But, followed by a slow pull of this beer, the cheese becomes the perfect compliment. A nice combination all can enjoy.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

S- Smells of caramel, marshmallows, with lemony sneaking in from the side.  T- Taste is of caramel, nuts, and spices. I would have liked to give this one the 5 here, but I just can't do it.  M- Mouthfeel is very creamy and malty. Very pleasing to the mouth is this beer. Carbonation is perfect!  D- This is a very drinkable beer. I love this one.

Head slowly subsides to a big thick creamy collar and some lacing is left behind in the glass.  S-Nose is heavy on dark fruit-particularly raisins, and has a big spicy yeast background.  T- Dark fruit, particularly raisins, are upfront with a big hefty spicy yeast backbone. Hints of sugary sweetness also come through. The finish is mostly spicy yeast with a big presence of alcohol. What lingers on the palate is a big spicy yeast profile and hints of alcohol and fruity sweetness.  M- High carbonation and medium weight body heavy on alcohol and yeast. The alcohol is hard to swallow but the yeast smooths it out.  D- I find this more drinkable as it warms. The 9% ABV does not hide in this one at all. It is a complex and enjoyable Belgian ale meant to be treated with care.

A little too carbonated to start, gives everything a ""sting."" Light body and ample carbonation gives the feeling of a fluffy fullness.  D - This is pretty good, but still no Rochefort.

Appearance: Pours a hazy brown color with a 1 finger tan head. The head fades quickly on this one. Slightly red around the edges. There is a little bit of lacing on my snifter. This looks very similar to the others, just not quite as nice.  Aroma: Starts with some dark fruits and a slight alcohol burn. This is followed roasted malts and more dark fruits, possibly cherry. The aroma is more pronounced as it warms, just like the others. Not as pronounced as the others.  Taste: Starts sweet with some nice malt notes. There are hints of cherry and dark fruits. In the finish, there iswarming alcohol and some spicy hops. There is a nice malt background that balances all these flavors.  Mouthfeel: This starts creamy followed by the sweet dark fruits. These flavors hang for a short while.  Drinkability: This is very smooth too. This doesn't seem like 9%, but after a few, you know it is. I could put back about 4 or so of these, but it's best when comsumed slowly and enjoyed.  Overall. This finished last behind the Rochefort 10, Westy 12, and Abt 12.

215,2512,0tt0,4.15,"11.2 oz. bottle, decanted into a Chimay chalice.  Pours a chocolately brown with amber/ruby highlights at the edge of the glass. 1/4 inch of off-white head, loose but sticky. Malt dominates the nose, with the most notables scents being toffee, raisin, and freshly baked bread. A slight, slight citrus note as well. Much like the nose, the taste is of a slightly burnt sugar, raisins reconstituted in dark rum, and something akin to passion fruit. Finish is slightly dry, with some tongue-tingling carbonation in the middle and a medium decay. Mouthfeel is chewy and creamy, almost velvet-like. I am enjoying this one on the porch on one of the first cool nights of fall, and its ideal in these circumstances. Alcohol is extremely well cloaked. Not as complex as others in the style, but its no slouch at all and highly enjoyable given its drinkability. As an added incentive, its readily available at most decent bars and liquor stores, so there is always a terrific belgian close at hand. A consistently great beer.  Side note: I once paired this with some pulled pork and tomato barbecue sauce featuring molasses and it was outstanding. One of the better pairings I've encountered.

This blue labelled 33cl bottle with its best before date of 2012 was taken with a whole round of Chimay cheese, also with the blue label. Both bought in Belgium on a resent visit.  Poured into my 'Forbidden Fruit' chalice glass, it looked fine, I ensured the whole bottle including the sediment got into the glass.  Dark and a little cloudy, because of my pouring, the off white head didn't hang around, pity.  Although some BA's can smell the scent of a randy fox from half a mile, I struggle to smell my own farts sometimes, so it is not suprising that all I can smell is burnt malts and plums in this fine beer.  The taste however is easier to detect, a good blend of malt and plum fruits are there for all to find, this is a flavoursome beer and the 9% alcohol doesn't kill the intermix of quality products this beer is obviuosly made from, allowing them to infuse without ruining them.

T: The same dried darkened fruits leap from the glass, along with molasses and fig. Caramelized brown sugar is mixed with the sweetness of ethanol in the mid and is carried into the finish, which is dominated by port and sherry overtones of raisins, toffee and roasted sugars.

215,2512,LittleCreature,4.17,"Appearance - 4.0 Poured two fingers of aggressively bubbly, beige head, which rapidly reduced to a thin layer. The body is a very solid, dark brown with a little sediment moving around.  Smell - 4.5 Very smooth, alcoholic but not powerfully so. I can smell stewed dark fruits and a little burnt caramel, cloves, vanilla, some malt sweetness, and a tartness that I cannot put my finger on. This had very little aroma at first, but once it had warmed, smelt very good.  Taste - 4.0 A strong flavour, where alcohol plays the biggest part. Other flavours include currants, prunes, caramel and the bitterness of hops. The finish is slightly bitter and rather dry, and the aftertaste is smooth and full of flavour.  Mouthfeel - 4.5 Near perfect. The carbonation quite high at first, but reduces as the beer warms, although it always has tiny, champagne like bubbles that dance on the tounge. Weight in the mouth is moderate.  Overall - 4.0 Very good, I would love to have a second. Now I see why they make it in wine bottle sizes! You need to let it warm to truly shine, though. I can't wait until I have a dinner party and crack open a big bottle of this instead of a red wine! Like many high alcohol beers, my opinion of this got better the warmer it got. Definitely better than the red (which is also very good), overall an excellent Belgian beer.

215,2512,joeskirkie,4.23,"Popped the cork and went for the tulip.  It's a dark brown, completely opaque. Very nice fizzy head. Lovely.  There's mostly that spicy, clove-like Trappist/Belgian yeast scent first, I suspect from the head. Once you drink it and the head dissipates a little, it takes on a more raisiny scent.  When tasting; once again raisins are there, but with some chocolate and cinnamon. Theres a very pleasing burnt, oaky alcohol sensation on the finish with a lingering sugary sweetness and some mild spices. It's simply wonderful.  It's medium to full bodied, with mild carbonation and some detectable alcohol. I think I'm not alone when saying I tried this Chimay last among the red, white, and blue.

S: Fruits are at the forefront, raisins, prunes, some spices are present. Very inviting. Makes you want to drink it.  T: The smell becomes the taste. Fruits dominate the flavor, but not in a bad way. The maltiness of this brew is quite present with some sweetness. Sugars, spices, and a touch of hops balance this one out nicely. Alcohol contributes nicely without being overpowering.  M: Smooth and velvety, with a nice dry and crisp finish.  D: This is a very drinkable beer.

Slight amount of fruity esters on the nose too. Fair amount of carbonation. Goes down the hatch fairly smooth for a 9% a/v. Either this beer is fairly bland or I just have a hard time identifying taste qualities in Belgian beers. I get a little sour tartness and a deeply hidden candied apple taste. I don't get much more.

""Chimay""  poured from the big bottle with the blue label. i uncrowned it and let the cork work its way out until it popped and hit me in the palm of my hand. it didn't even hurt, it felt like puppies, or a gentle summer rain.  A- loud lively buzzing foam formed 2in of off-white active head with masses of bubbles popping and colliding with one another above a psychedelic dark hazy purple-ish brew that showed translucent honey red amber copper tones when held up to the light and still managed to show row after row of sparkling iridescent bubbles rising from the botton of my imperial pilsner tulip. the rising bubbles were similar to fire from a diamond without the red side of the spectrum. their ""blueness"" is what i think made them sparkle the way they do. the head subsided to 1/4in of beautiful moon like wafer that left globs of lace sliding down the glass  S- baker's yeast, fortified wine, alcohol tingles the nose, honey, dark berry, plum, raisin, roasted malt, dark chocolate, and a lasting peppery spice.  T- that prized well water and dark fruit initially, followed immediately by buttery diacetyl and mild raw cocoa mingled with currant, plum skin, and caramelized malt. taste goes on to stage 3 where the cocoa lingers and meets herbal almost resinous hops. the hops stay for second then move out of the way so the cocoa can be sweetened by dried fruits and powdered sugar or even pure sugar, like that molasses sugar cane stuff that comes in a cone shape. but not so sweet that you would call it ""sweet"". the earthy truffle dried raisin plum and black pepper taste along with the bitter cocoa make for a finish similar to shiraz, port, cream sherry, and marsala rolled into one, sherry being the dominator, with its sugary yet dry aftertaste.  MF- absolutely defuckinlightful, like drinking carbonated liquid butter. ok not quite. as refreshing as a glass of fruit punch but heavier on the palate with immaculate carbonation this ale feels oily at first, then u realize that it's not oily at all, it's crisp and dry and you should have bought 2 bottles.  D- i think this goes without saying. uh...YEAH!   note: i know i was generous with the 5's here but i love european water. this shit is quintessential. i dare...no, i double dare anyone to make a belgian ale better than chimay cuz u just can't do it son. the monks have it locked down. see ya in paradise.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Dark, nearly clear ruby body. Dark offwhite head. Fast falling, but with lots of nucleated sites.  Smell is raisins, molasses, sugar cane, and some cocoa. Booze is noticable only on the deepest whiffs. Some hints of fresh hops or other grassy notes.  Taste is sweet and a litte bitter - dark cocoa, no candi noticable. More piney hops. Bready finish after some very warm-climate yeast notes. Mineraly. When warm, sweetens back to raisins a bit. Final notes have some strange bitter, earthy note, like mushroom or mold.

As the top of the head begins to diminish the hundreds of tiny bubbles rising in the tulip glass to the bottom of the head replace what vanishes. The aroma is of malt & dark fruits. The flavor is a dry malty fruitiness with a fizzy medium bodided mouthfeel. Alcohol becomes more noticeable as it warms up, but it's not overpowering. Great beer, just a great beer.

215,2512,basica,4.3,"Chimay Blue (1987 Vintage)  Just before I cracked this one, I cracked my 1991 Vintage Chimay Blue and immediately out sprang a strong pungent smell. I was quite sure that it has gone bad but I took a light sip and the moment it touched my tongue I spat it out and poured the rest of the glass away. What a shame! I wanted to have a beer for the night so I took out my 1987 Vintage praying that it would not be spoilt! A quick whiff after cracking it reveals that it was ok! However I do not think it was very well kept; my guess. This 87 Chimay blue vintage poured out dark red brown with almost no head; it quickly disappears leaving not a hint of lacing. It smells fruity, bready and yeasty but not particularly strong. The taste starts of feeling like slightly expired fruits; this reminds me of the 90s Westmalle that I cracked; the fruity taste seems to be a little ""old"" and expired. The dark malts that I enojoyed from the contemporary Chimay is not as significant as well and that was a little disappointing. The difference now is that the fruity taste was upfront whereas in the contemporary Chimay, the fruitiness is not upfront but instead springs up on the finish. The starting was also more yeasty than I would like but that was ok. Quite a bit of floral fruity notes on the nose too. This fruitiness was made up of plums, grapes, raisins, dates like the contemporary Chimay but seems a little expired; the fruitiness. However in the after taste this fruitiness was rich, slightly citrusy and rather lasting ending off with sightly sourish grape notes which was pretty nice. Towards the end I see some sediments and decided not to finish that up. This Chimay had a medium to full body mouth feel pretty close to the contemporary Chimay and carbonation was pretty apt too; alcohol can be felt on the throat and nose but it was very smooth just like the contemporary Chimay. This beer is mellowed down compared to the contemporary Chimay without losing much of its character but the expired fruitiness kind of disappointed me. I think it is not past its prime but the storing was just not really perfect; I would want to try a properly aged Chimay Blue. For now I still prefer the contemporary Chimay.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

About 2 fingers when first poured  Smell: Sweet, fruit in the background. Spice comes through the more I enjoy the smell...very refreshing  Taste: Hops and malt spice toward the end. Very good flavour. The fruits that you smell toward the beginning do come through while drinking. So to recap malt/hops at the beginning, toward the middle of the drink you get a touch of sweetness from the fruit and ends w/ some nice spice. VERY good  Mouthfeel: Medium body w/ carbonation. A touch fizzy? Very warm at the end  Drinkability: A nice drink to enjoy but not one I'd have every night. This would be great w/ a savory dish. Not a drink to chug or pound down but a nice sipping drink.   Edit: as the drink warmed up some it unlocked some more of the drinks potential. More of the fruit unlocks toward the beginning of the drink instead of just the middle, and the spice picks up a little while the warmth stays!!

The smell was that of sweet malts that was very pleasing. The taste was interesting. Since it was a belgian, I knew it was going to be fairly alcoholic (i.e. the 9 %). The initial taste reminded me of a green apple: a sweet yet sour taste that your palette adjusts to. Once it does, the taste becomes more sweet than sour. Towards the finish of the beer, there seemed to be a refreshing taste to it, almost like the feeling your mouth gets after you have had some mint gum. The body was nice, smooth, and full-bodied. This beer went down nice and easy, but it definitely hit me later. While being good tasting, smooth, and nice to drink, the high alcohol content is almost like a sleeper.

While I've had this a good number of times, I've never had one this old, and damn has time served it well! Incredibly smooth and balanced, the sweet candi sugar slightly beats out the spicy yeast, rounded out with a warming glow of alcohol and a dash of phenols on the finish.

Full, rich aroma, a little musty - in a good way. Plenty of dark fruit, and the alcohol doesn't hold back.  Spiciness that didn't show itself in the nose is immediately evident in the taste. Fruit that seemed carmelized and dark to my nose is coming across lighter and sweeter here. Undeniably good, just not quite spectacular. The spices last all the way through and leave a pleasant ""zesty"" feeling on the tongue. Mouthfeel is great after initial carbonation rush dies down, smooth and warming.

I usually stay away from Belgian Ales for their earthy, yeasty taste, but this offering from Chimay just may have me trying many more Belgian styles.  A- Poured a coffee-like brown hue with hints of amber coming thru when held to light. This was topped off by a 3/4 inch khaki colored head. There was some delicate lacing on the glass the whole time.  A- The nose was very vinous in its aroma. Whiffs of currants, licorice and sweet alcohol were present. Also some floral notes hiding in there.  T- This is was the most enjoyable part of all. Up front I was hit by a sweetness that reminded me of raisins, with a little coffee bitterness. The midpoint was a spicy herbal taste that mellowed into the sweetness of warming alcohol as it left my mouth.  M- This was a very smooth beer. It seemed to coat my whole mouth with every drink.

Alcohol kind of jumps at your nose a bit. Taste is chewy dark malts mixed with banana, orange, and grape. Phenolics are mild and allow the dark malty character thrive. Finishes slightly drier than the middle and ends with some toasty character. Hay-like hop flavor is mild in the end as well. Mouthfeel is not heavy at all, nor is it slick.

Full marks at this point. On the nose the first thing I notice is almost a milk dud chocolate aroma, with a touch of coffee and brown sugar. Really, this beer has the most pronounced chocolate candy aroma I've ever seen, with a touch of Belgium spices to keep it all interesting. This beer is very lithe and supple on the palate, with flavors of chocolate, maraschino cherry and honey. There's just a touch of bitterness and dryness in the finish, which keeps this beer from becoming tiring to drink. Again, quite impressive. Abv. is noticeable, but in a good way for this beer.

Appearance: Served from a corked and caged bottle into a Chimay goblet. The cork exploded out of the bottle champagne-style when I uncaged it. This is a beer that doesn't mess around... Poured cola brown with a light tan 3/4 inch head. Almost completely opaque unless viewed from the bottom. Simply beautiful.  Smell: Allowed this one to warm in the glass a few minutes befroe consuming. The more it warmed the more the aroma revealed itself to me. Smell is sugary at first with hints of chocolate or molasses. Almost candylike, but I can't really tell which candy. Rich malty characteristics finish out this nose.  Taste: Again, this one improves after a bit of warming. I would say this is best a good bit under room tempurature - not right out of the fridge, but not completely warmed to room temp. Begins with a good hit of malt, evolving into light cocoa and dark fruits. Heavenly taste when allowed to mature to the correct temperature. I can't really describe this one in too much detail in fear that I may do injustice to the taste itself.

215,2512,dannon71,4.9,"APPEARANCE: The body of this beer has a rich brown color with a slight hint of red. Cream colored head that starts about 1"" - 2"" thick depending on your pour and settles to about 1/4"" throughout.  SMELL: Beautiful aroma of fruits, malt and molasses blend very nicely together. At first, a complex variety of fruit aromas are evident and hint strongly of figs combined with raisin. Light plum and pear are present here as well. Fruit aromas are quickly followed by the sweet scents of caramel and molasses which linger around the nose for some time. Alcohol is evident but nowhere near overwhelming.  TASTE: Instant flavor of yeast is evident followed by a perfect combination of the spice and fruit pairings. A small hint of bitterness follows then quickly turns sweet on the palate. Taste finishes with a dry crisp that leaves the mouth lingering - no begging - for another sip. Absolutely wonderful!  MOUTHFEEL: Medium body with a definite champagne like carbonation. the finish is nicely smooth and slightly dry.  DRINKABILITY: Very easy to finish the glass due to the complex flavors and uniquely warming qualities of the beer. Very difficult to slow down between sips and to truly savour as this beer warrants. A 750ml bottle is not near as difficult to drink as one may think.  This is by far my favorite Belgian beer. If you can come across a properly aged bottle, which is very hard to do these days, the experience is even greater! There are some exceptional Trappist brews out there but when you consider quality, availability, and cost, this one tops them all!!",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,jmalex,4.33,"Trappist #3 out of 6 for me. I can't believe I haven't had this before. It's about time, and today is a great day for it.  APPEARANCE: Pours an opaque brown with a vague red tint to it. The head started out at a one finger height and dropped to a nice off-white cap which holds to the very end. Lacing, however, is non-existent.  SMELL: It doesn't seem to have very strong aromas, but they increase at it warms. Light smells of Belgian yeast as well as some fruit (peach, plum). Alcohol is only barely detectable, but it is there.  TASTE: Begins with a quick jolt of Belgian yeast flavor along with the same fruitiness in the aroma. It becomes quite sweet towards the finish, and alcohol starts to come out. As a result, the finish is a little hot and dry. But it's such a complex beer. Incredible.  MOUTHFEEL: Medium to medium-light bodied with a fine, champagne-like carbonation. Very smooth, but slightly dry.  DRINKABILITY: A really smooth beer hindered only by the heat (not to sound like a broken record). Really fantastic though. I should have bought the 750 mL bottle.  I see this beer on tap from time to time, but never ordered it. I guess I thought since it's so widely available, it wouldn't stack up to some of the other Trappists in comparison.

I poured it into a goblet to produce a 1"" light tan head that disappeared to a fizzy ring. The beer is the color of dark caramel. Cloudy. When held to light it is a deep red.  The aroma is rich and a bit fruity. Sweet caramel.  OK.... here goes the taste: WOW!.... This is strong stuff! Taste of plum with a big alcohol finish. A touch of caramel sweetness but a good bitterness to balance it out.  Mouthfeel: A bit too fizzy for my taste.... this beer is highly carbonated. Also a bit thin for my taste.... I would prefer a bit more substance. Nice aftertaste and mouth coating.  Drinkability: This is a BIG BEER! 9% ABV. It was all I could do to finish the bottle.... best bet....share with a friend.

Taste, on the other hand, comes out of nowhere and kicks you square in the nuts. A touch of alcohol up front. Prunes and raisins. Chocolate and some light caramel. The only hit to the flavor is that the alcohol keeps sticking its nose in throughout. Body is medium and highly carbonated. A good beer - one that actually.

Pours a solid head, but not as big a head as I am used to from this brew. It settles down to a fine lace, which is odd for a brew normally more carbonated.  Smell is distinctive grapes, plums and prunes which dominated the fruity esters that abound in this brew. The aroma and taste is almost like an old port, sort of reminiscent of a barley wine or an old ale in some ways.  Wow, this beer really ages well. I would recommend setting a bottle of this aside for a year or two the next time you buy some. The fresher Chimay is good, but the older stuff is better.

Snell is good. Plum, raisin and powdered sugar dominate with a pleasing earthy malt fragrance to round things out.  Taste is good. Huge plum flavor, sugary dates and alcohol fumes. Literally like biting into a plum. Luckily, the sweetness doesn't become cloying. There's an earthy, yeasty presence as well. Not extremely complex but well done.  Mouthfeel is good. For the style, carbonation level is almost perfect. Lively in the mouth but finishes a little bit thin.  Drinkability is good. Mostly because the sweetness isn't cloying, the drinkability jumps. One bottle would be enough though.  Overall: Not the most exciting Belgian Strong Dark Ale out there but worthy of being in the rotation.

The complex malt and fruit flavors are just what I expect from this Belgian style. Despite the 9% ABV, the aroma and taste are both less alocoholic than Chimay's red and white beers.

And I have to say that with the benefit of quite a bit more beer experience since my last rating, that I significantly over-rated this beer in my previous rating. Yesterday, I found this beer is extremely mild, and while certainly not unpleasant or bad, I found it to be a bit boring. Of the three varieties I had yesterday, this was definitely my least favorite.  Appearance was a dark brown/almost black color with a decently-formed whitish head with limited staying power. Aroma was very mild and faint. I got roasted malt and a bit of alcohol, but not much else. Flavor was the highlight of this beer, but even that I found mild-mannered and rather unremarkable compared to other dark Belgian (or Belgian-style) beers Ive had. A bit of roastiness and some alcohol, but not much else that you might expect like spiciness or fruit. Mouthfeel was not bad, but unremarkable.  So Im left to explain why so many think so much of this beer while Im the odd-duck whos unimpressed. And my hypothesis is this - that many folks (me among them) try this beer when first expanding their beer horizons, are wildly impressed by the difference, but havent yet revisited (as Im now doing) to compare against the craft/import beer adventures theyve had since breaking out with Chimay Blue.

The label lacked any information as to exactly when it was brewed which might have something to do with the average experience I had with this beer. Upon pouring, I noted an active head, lots of carbonation and thus bubbles, yet the head disapaited very quickly. A bit of a disappointment. Nonetheless, some lace did web the glass and I moved on to the nose which was...modest to barely noticeable. Some whispers of aged fruit (maybe) but really nothing else. This of course had a lot to do with the taste which was very subtle. Notes of aged prunes and raisens but not much else. Sure, some candied sugar caught my attention but what a ho-hum taste. Mouthfeel was as uneventful as the aroma and taste. Watery comes to mind. No viscous blanket to the tongue. Nada. It's drinkable I suppose, but I don't think this is a beer I will seek out again.

Allows very little light through and is full of yeasty goodness. Forms a very nice dirty white head that lasts the entire beer. No lacing what-so-ever. Smell- Sweet candied malts with hints of dark berrys. Has a very candy sweet aroma that honestly, I did not expect. Has a very subtle yet rich aroma that helps hide the gentle alcohol notes. The overall smell is very gentle but pleasing. Taste- Very dark berry notes that are balanced nicely by a sour bitterness. Has a almost cotton candy like tone to it. Light roasted malts peak through helping to balance the very obvious alcohol warming. Finishes semi dry on the back of the tongue with lingering sweetness. Mouthfeel- Like the other Chimays, this beer is quite carbonated. After a bit of warming, it settles to a very nice, subtle bubbling. Pretty thin feel that really allows the carbonation to show. Pleasant. Drinkability- Well, due to the 9% ABV youre probably not going to drink more than a couple, but a treat none-the-less. This beer, honestly, is not what I expected, but was such a treat.

There is that aftertaste I have noticed with Strong Belgian Ales, the sweet alcohol taste that will sometimes linger on your tongue briefly. I did enjoy the mouthfeel. It is a very carbonated beer with a lot of bubbles that play over your tongue. This is a solid Strong Ale with good characteristics.

No noticable fruity smells that are associated with BSDAs. The taste is similar to the smell, Belgian yeast & candi sugar, hints of figs and prunes towards the end. This tastes like a dark tripel.

I got a nice, thick, two-finger tan head that receded fairly quickly into a ring with some foam floating on the surface. The body itself was a gorgeous, hazy hue that transformed between a golden-brown and red as you twirled the glass to the light.  Aroma wasn't as strong as you'd think. Some faint caramel/toffee smells and some alcohol.  The taste was what you expect from the style. Lots of plums, raisins, candied dates. Some grapelike notes. Definitely a caramel presence with a nice backdrop of alcoholic warmth. So smooth. I did, however, experience a somewhat strangely astringent finish that was a little displeasing.  Mouthfeel was full-bodied but crisply carbonated. Perhaps overly so. Because of the ABV, this isn't a beer to sit around and knock back all night. But it's a great beer to savor, which is how it was obviously intended.  Very good representation of the style. I do, however, think it's better from the corked 750 ml bottle. A classic Belgian ale that everyone should try. But if I'm going to play in that league, I still prefer a St. Bernardus 12 or a Gulden Draak.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Generous light tan head.  Amazing mouthfeel. At first I thought it was overly carbonated, but the more I drink of it the beer has a nice silky softness that is really enjoyable on the tongue.  The aroma is not as potent as I remembered (but it could be my allergies that are in the way here).  The flavor is strong. Lots of alcoholic warmth that is enveloped by rich malt and spices (definitely can pick up a little bit of clove). There is a pretty decent amount of sweetness but it is perfectly balanced by the bitterness and strength. I can't pick up very much in the way of hops.  Truly a world-class beer. If I was to pick apart anything, it would be that I would enjoy even more spices on the palate and also the carbonation has a bit too much of a bite unless you sip it very slowly (which is where I noticed more of the silky mouthfeel thing going on).",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Aroma is much like the red to me, ripe fruits, chalky yeast and damp hops. There is almost a vinous smell to it. Flavor is dry maltiness, with a lot of dark fruit and caramel.

Kind of sour, but there are some dark fruits mixed in there; raisins, plums, and some grape leaves. Has a peppery finish, especially as it warms. But it ain't half bad. A bit astrigent to.

Massive head that settled down quickly, no lacing.  S - Raisins and alcohol...but mostly alcohol. That said, not an unpleasant alcohol aroma at all....nice and spicy. As it warms, I get more of the raisin overtones.  T - I know now why this beer is consistently rated highly. I don't have a ton of experience with Belgian Strong Darks, but I can't imagine one being that much better than this. The aforementioned raisins, along with all fruits brown and purple - plums, figs, dates, grapes - seem to make an imprint on the taste buds. Suggested to serve chilled...but I find that as it warms, it's a lot more flavorful.  M - Well carbonated...there's a lot of alcohol in here but it's not overly harsh. I can tell I'm drinking a strong beer, but it's not bothering me in the slightest.  D - Patently drinkable. A pleasure to drink....too easy to devour that 750.

The head foams up nicely but dissipates rather quickly and therefore little head retention. I tried to place the aroma which was very subtle. The best description I could come up with was a little fusel mixed with some banana. The taste itself was subtle although I definitely notices a caramel flavor which was quite nice and the mouthfeel was velvety which contrasted exceptionally well. I came away with a revelation that this style is not my favorite but I would try it again.,Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Beautiful deep ruby brown, about two fingers of head that dissipates quickly. Lacing a little less than I would have expected.  Aroma is complex, but not overly so. Spice, banana, malt, maybe even some saltiness buried in there. Taste continues the complexity without overwhelming. Many flavors to explore without throwing in the kitchen sink - stays balanced. Gets much more inviting as the beer warms, but to me doesn't quite click with the nose. Overall texture and finish is tannic - much more so than the other Chimays, and to me overly drying, limiting the drinkability.  But there's no doubting the care in the making of this beer.

While it smells quite good Im not sure how much I like the banana quality.  Taste: There is an alcoholic character in this beer, and a touch of spiciness and esters. It is good, but I think it is a bit sharp.  Mouthfeel: Thinner then I would have expected with a nice touch of carbonation.  Drinkability: the 9% alcohol is going to make it hard to drink a ton of this.

Decent head, very small bubbles, decent retention. Fl- Smooth light maltiness, really nice bitter side that finishes super clean. Subtle spice of clove/sage lingers on the palate. Citrusy hop in the background somewhere. Very tasty, complex, but well balanced. M- Nicely carbonated being bottle conditioned, very bubble, medium body. Overall - Just a pleasure to consume.

Beer itself is a brilliant dark ruby color, beautiful.  Smell: Syrupy sweetness with dark undertones of molasses and raisins. Slightly sour/tangy and slightly metallic.  Taste: Dark, thick flavors assault the tongue. Sugary sweetness without being cloying. Brown sugar, plums, and molasses. Very slight bitterness at the end, but you almost have to force yourself to taste it. Tremendously complex.  Mouthfeel: Less than average carbonation. Great body.  Drinkability: I love this beer.

Aromas of berries mingle with light caramelfairly subdued per style. Crisp carbonation inaugurates the first sip. Behind it is a toasty biscuit character, a touch of caramel and some mild earthy and citric hop notes. Earthy Belgian yeast notes throughout, a tad spicy at times. Medium body. Fairly smooth once the carbonation dissipates  A bit abrasive at first due to the zealous carbonation, however as it calms down it reaches a fine state of balance and the full flavor complexity comes throughrather than just carbonation. I did not perceive much sweetness in here, with the biscuit taking the lead much to my approval.

The aroma is raisiny with a little fruitiness yet very soft.  The taste is biting with a lingering flavor of dark fruit and dark grains. More so that of the dark grains. This is followed by a very sublte pepper note which could be played by hop bitterness. The flavor is slightly woody. A little sweet but balanced against the flavors and bite. The aftermath is warming.  The mouthfeel is initially soft and foamy then slick.  Definately not a session beer. I would easily have a few glasses of this however.,Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

The aforementioned creamy head and modest carbonation adds to the remarkably soft mouthfeel which stands out as one of the best.  Strong malts come through and a destinctive taste of raisin are the first things I noticed, but its complexity continued to astound me with hints of chocolate and a range of delightful fruits. The aftertaste is spicy, sweet and warm.  There is a very mild alcohol harshness after warmth, but given the ABV this is expected. You could probably drink this all night, delighted with the flavour, but in reality it's definately a sipper and not a session beer.

M: Velvety soft, and luscious mouthfeel. Feels like a coating of whipped cream on the tongue. A modest dose of carbonation is refreshing.  T: While straight-laced at around 40-45 deg. or so with high malts and dark fruit, this beauty opens up once it warms up a bit like a dame should. It is so malty sweet, like maple syrup sweet, with a tasty yeast layer that lingers. This is followed by a little chocolate, alcaholic spiciness, with a little diacetyl as well (butterscotch? Rasberry?) and caramel. Raisins and plums of course are the first notes to mention, but this is a complex, big ale. Not much hop presence obviously, just in the finish slightly. Such a great brew...  A: Incredible. A night-sipper, and it's amazing how subtle it is for a 9% ale. This is one of the best Belgians IMO, and is a gift from the heavens.

My gripe is that this beer is just a tad too conservative and subdued to really work for me. The smell is good but muted. The taste is interesting but lacks pop. I find La Terrible (powerful hops) or Rochefort Trappistes 8 (more complex, bold taste) to be better beers. Understand, I would never turn this beer down if it was offered. It's really good.

Opaque muddy mahogany color, with an off-white head that turned into a pretty decent ring. Very attractive lacing.  Smells like dried fruit and alcohol.  Tastes like... well, dried fruit and alcohol. And yeast (no shit, Sherlock). A little bit phenolic. I can see how other people compared it to Unibroue beers, there's something similar to Maudite going on in it... but I think I might like Maudite better. There's a SLIGHT growing caramelly sweetness as it warms, which is pleasant.  Mouthfeel... tingly, bubbly, super-carbonation. Kinda dry.  I don't think I'd want more than one of these (not that I'd turn down a free one). I pretty much just tried it because I was like ""You know, it's weird that I've never tried Chimay.""

Smell: The nose has dark fruits, light phenolic fruits, sweet malts, and a small amount of hops.  Taste: The flavor profile starts out with semi-sour dark fruit, phenols bring lighter fruit to the middle to go along with a hint of anise, followed up by a spicy, yeasty finish with a touch of warming alcohol.

Mouthfeel: The body is on the lighter end of the medium spectrum. It has good carbonation and warming alcohol.  Drinkability: It's still a good brew, but it doesn't wow me the way it once did.

Keeps me coming back. I'll take this with dinner over a bottle of wine any day.  I've had this one countless times (never have a night at Blue in Bethlehem without it), but have never taken the time to sit down and formally review it.  Appearance: Hazy burgundy pour into my snifter. Light tan head starts out fluffy and gradually reduces to a film. Minor lacing apparent.  Smell: Malts, yeast, perhaps some raisins and brown sugar as well. Alcohol more apparent as it warms in the glass.  Taste: Some of that raisin/date flavor, definitely a tartness to it with a solid malt backbone. Alcohol flavor is there, but it complements everything quite well. A bit dry in the finish, but that only serves to add more complexity to this.  Mouthfeel: Terrific - not too sticky and has a nice, full body. Carbonation level is a little high, but it doesn't hinder my enjoyment of this finely crafted trappist ale.  Drinkability: At 9%, I'd be tempted to knock this thing down, but I have to admit this is one of the few beers I can drink until I can drink no longer.

215,2512,wagenvolks,4.17,"11.2 oz bottle into a holiday-pack Chimay chalice. A generous light tan head atop a dark brown, mahogany ale. The head lasts for a quick minute then leaves slight lacing. Nothing overly impressive here. The aroma is obviously intricate, with fig, apple, grape, and a sharp alcoholic note that compliments it well.  The taste gets a surprisingly subtle, yet complex mix of flavors with a big chestnut and malt bit up front that transitions to a smooth raisiny, citris, and wheat aftertaste. More raisin and plum notes come through as it warms. The feel is of a well-balanced, well-carbonated ale that pleases the palate. A bit dry, but not to the point of losing its appeal. Definately drinkable, with enough here to keep interest through a few beers (if the wallet could take it). Goes well with swiss or brie.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Taste: Much like the red with more alcohol an not as sweet, but very similar qualities overall.  Mouthfeel: Nice crisp texture.

A little sticky  S - This beer smelled of ripe fruit right upfront with a malty tanginess in the back. Further down the glass the alcohol becomes more noticable.  T - Very smooth with a nice malty character very rich with flavor. Ripe fruit is very noticable as well as a milt hoppy bitterness and alcohol.  M - A nice full-bodied beer that was on the lighter side of carbonation level. The malts and smooth texture of this beer gives you a very warming sensation.  D - This is a beer that is meant for sipping but with that in mind it is easily a drinkable beer. The alcohol will settle in time and make this beer more drinkable as it ages.,Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

A - Thick, murky brown (almost like a burnt umbra) body with large, off-white head that mostly diminished and left virtually no lacing around the glass.  S - Heavy on the malt with a light yeasty nose and very obvious sweet/white wine overtones.  T - Initial flavor was lightly sweet with a more acidic finish.  M - Carbonation was quite lively. Had a medium to full bodied palate with a fairly creamy texture. The finish was somewhat alcoholic, almost sweet and sour with quite a bit of effervescence.  D - I'm not a huge fan of Belgians, but this is probably the most drinkable one I've had yet.

Pancake syrup. Lifesavers candy. Raisin bread. Never overpowering. Complex and intersting.  Taste was a prune-like sweetness. Tart. Faint metallic flavor. Rich, but not too much.

Smell: This definitely smells aged. Rich and malty with notes of caramel, toffee, and dark fruit. There are also vinuous notes as well as some alcoholic spiciness.  Taste: Malty upfront with toasty flavors as well as sweet caramel and dark fruit, sweet, but not too sweet. The finish has a light tartness with pepper, alcohol and a very light bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Full-bodied and thick, with low carbonation.  Drinkability: Smooth and full flavored, but mellow.  Overall: This is definitely one that improves with age.

The head dissipates to a nice layer of froth on top of the liquid and sticks around til the beer is gone. Nice lacing on the glass too.  S - Very complex smell from the beginning. Candy sugar, ripe dark fruits, toffee, and caramel first come to the forefront. Just spectacular...the smell is both complex and delighting at the same time. Hard to even take a sip, because I could sit here and smell this all night.  T - Taste is both sweet and peppery with a little underlying alcohol warmth. Pick up the fruity tastes more in the aftertaste, perhaps figs or dates. Maybe even a little apple or pear sweetness coming through. Overall, great taste that will take many more tastings to fully unveil all of the complex flavors.  M - Mouthfeel is very creamy, but seems to be fairly highly carbonated, which takes away from the enjoyment a little bit and makes it a little harder to pick up flavors.  D - I really enjoy drinking this ale and would like to sit around for hours drinking these and pondering life's meaning. Perhaps I should become a Trappist Monk after all.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,Grundle20,3.87,"Appearance: Poured a chestnut brown into the Chimay chalice glass. There was really no head to speak of which made for little to no lacing. I think had that bar I was served the beer at not kept it so cold it would have been slightly more impressive in this aspect.  Smell: There's big beefy scents here of toffee, caramel, honey suckle like esters, a warm alcohol presence, and an obligatory underlying yeast funk. Again I believe a little warming time would have made these scents explode but the beer still managed to wow me with it's depth and complexity of scents.  Taste and Mouthfeel: The beer is built up on a huge crisp malt body of dark caramel and toffee malt flavors. The beer drinks slightly thick and full and coats every corner of my mouth. There's spicy floral character towards the finish which ultimately exits with a full aftertaste of big malts.  Bottom Line: I've had better bottles of this before but this was still respectable. A little aging and some warmer serving temperatures would have served this beer well but I unfortunately didn't have time to sit on my lunch break and let this bad boy breath for a while.

Then the quaff, ummm, what a full bodied, rich wave of the malty mixture of Belgium yeast and candy cane. Nice lil pop of phenolics and spice.  Just a superb sipper for any time  a real winter warmer if you desire. The 9% is well hide behind the loaded malts.

In fact, over-chilled. It's been warming on the counter for over an hour. I'm guessing it's at about 50 degrees.  A - It's funny, as many of these as I've had, I've never really stopped to look. A beautiful dark ruby color. Barely translucent. Not much head, but I tend to pour this one very conservatively. No lacing whatsover.  S - Not much there at the start. A faint earthy plum aroma. A hint of alcohol. As things warm, they start to jump a little. Coffee candy, butterscotch?  T - Wonderful. Deep, rich and full. A good hoppy blast at the forefront that is chased by an earthy malt and yeasty alcohol blast. Very, very, dry at the end.  M - An adventure in itself. Very active across the palate. Muted at first, then the effervescence dances its' tiny bubbles across your tongue, washing everything to the side and making way for the alcohol.  D - Highly drinkable. I flat out love this beer.

From the initial pop of the cork (which startled the inexperienced waitress), this beer was destined to be great. I have had several chimay blue labels, enjoying each bottle more than the last. Poured into a brandy snifter, with a nice release of carbonation and a relatively short lived milk chocolate head. A nice swirl of the glass releases a great casky/blunt tart smell.

T - Much better than I remember it. Again the a soft apple comes through early, but is quickly overtaken by an assertive alcohol that is somehow not boozy. Fruity notes and bitterness seem intermixed, a little like the pith of an orange (but not orange flavoured mind you). I guess if you made citrus fruit out of a royal gala apple, it might taste a bit like this. It's not actually sweet, but the combination of flavours make it almost seem like it.

There just was a very narrow ring of foam laying on top of the dark copper to brown colored ale clinging to the bowl of the goblet. The beer had a slight yeasty, winey aroma. The taste was much like a mild medium to sweet sherry with a rather flat mouthfeel. Almost no effervescence was apparent.

It's really everything you expect. Heaps of sweet maltyness with overtones of fruits. Not too sweet, not too bitter. Balanced really well, with none of the medicinal aftertaste that sits on the back of your palate after swallowing Chimay white. It's just a damn fine taste with no flaws.

Taste: Starts very nice with a rich maltiness, fruity sweet with a hints of fresh bread, raisins, dates and caramel. Yeasty to say the least.

Drinkability/Notes: What a really nice Belgian Dark Ale. Malty sweet with a fruitiness that reminds one of fresh raisin bread. Hops make a subtle appearance in the finish which lends it a very slight bitterness to offset some of that malty goodness. Alcohol. What alcohol?

The palate is even, not overly strong in any one characteristic. The malty characteristics are balanced by the sourness and both conspire to hide the heavy alcohol content. No hint of the 9+% alcohol until you realize that it is rocking your face off.  The sourness of the after-palate is a bit offsetting at first, but blends quickly until it is the taste you anticipate with your next sip.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,HAB,3,"Like a lot of others, I really looked forward to trying this beer. The appearance was a very nice brown with a lace head. The smell was inviting but the taste was too much like wine for me. The alcohol is very strong in the taste.

Gamey richness, creamy, complex spicey mix, with sweet candy tones, and a mild bitterness at the back. Alchohol heat noticable.

Next case will be big bottles.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,cproioi,3.32,Pours a dark brown body with a greyish head that disipated rather quickly and left the signature Belgian style lacing. The beer was very loud it can be heard cracking and popping with out having your ear right next to it. The taste and aroma followed each other. It was a very raisiny sweetness with other dried fruit notes. The mouthfeel was extremely dry and bubbly with carbonation popping on the tounge. This was a slow sipping beer that must be handled with respect.,Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Smell: Complex aroma of fruits and spices, a slight bit of alcohol detectable.  Taste: Again very complex taste as in the aroma. Every sip is an expereince, leaving you to guess what you could taste next. Many different fuits, figs, spices in here, a wonderful treat. The alcohol is subtle but detectable. Some bitterness lends in to help control.  Mouthfeel: Medium/thick in body, creamy and a bit oil as well.  Drinkability: I don't think I would personally want an entire 750ml again, but it wasn't a problem to finish. It's scary how some can really handle this beer, my friend drinks two 750mls in a sitting, I'm not sure why or even if that is respectful to the beer but its obvious he loves, more than I.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Thick head dies out pretty quickly, with very little lacing.  Smell: I can smell this one! Very pearish, with a little hint of roasted chestnut, and anise.  Taste: Black cherry, bananas, cloves. Wonderful. Can barely taste the alcohol, but I'm pretty shur its their.  Mouthfeel: Great malty feel, and very smooth, just a little fizzier than I had expected.

The clove and spice show up in the flavor as well as some bananas. A champagne like alcohol flavor is very evident. Medium to full in body. Dry finish. Good dispursement of flavor throughout the palate.

Appearance: Dim lighting left the beer looking a dark caramel copper color with hints of red and it had a very creamy head that lasts and lasts. Heavy sheets of lacing coated the flute glass the bar tender selected [shrugs] =)  Smell: A sweet caramel malt aroma dominates the nose, followed by a complex web of dark fruits, including figs & dates with a splash of pear and hint of yeast and spice.   Taste: The taste follows the nose to start delves deeper in to the glorious pool of flavors that is Chimay Blue. Dark figs dates and brown sugar are balanced with a light berry tart. Deep hints of cherry and chocolate a simultaneously met with gentle yeasty spices cloves and nuts and finally there is a bit of warming alcohol. As dark and rich as the flavors are, it also lights up in the mouth as zesty and lively.  Mouthfeel: A bit chewy and yet airy and full feeling in the mouth. The beer exceptionally smooth and leads into a beautiful finish and spectacular lingering aftertaste.  Drinkability: This is a very tasty beer. Even though it is a sipper beer it pleasant and easy to drink. This can really be dangerous if your not sharing with someone else. =)  Hope this is helpful.

215,2512,InDreams,4.37,"I have an 18 month old bottle of Chimay sitting around, but before trying it out I had to have a brand new bottle, so I bought one and tried it out.  A: Poured into a Snifter a very dark brown color, with a tan head about a centimeter thick that didn't stick around too long but left a nice crown around the edges and put a tad bit of lacing on the glass. On a second glance I figured I'd also use the word cloudy to describe it too.  S: This was really, really interesting. My first impression was raisins or clove, but then I started to think I caught a whiff of alcohol, something like a white rum, as well as a malty sweetness. Definitely, on further reflection, fruity with some caramel too it, floral and yeasty, and I'd have to say it's got a spice character to it. Lots of adjectives to throw around here.  T: Awesome. Starts off kinda sweet and almost spicy, with a caramel like character, and then follows with a floral, light bitterness, with hints of hops in the background and on the aftertaste. You've definitely got the malt character here, and the apparent spiciness is something that's really got me going. I'd also mention that you can feel a slight alcoholic burn at the back end.  M: Medium-bodied, very, very smooth, with a good amount of carbonation there to make it interesting, but never too much. I'd venture to say that, as part of mouthfeel, you have to include the alcohol that lingers on the backend.  D: Can't talk about this like it's a session beer, so any drinkability comment has to revolve around my willingness to drink it. It looks good, tastes great, and exists as a very complex, interesting beer. It's very enjoyable, but I'm sure that if you had more than a 750mL to yourself, the strength and sweetness of this beer might overwhelm you. I'd recommend it in moderation, so that you can enjoy it more. That said, it's always drinkable.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,Metalmonk,4.67,"Oh, the Trappist ales. Can't get enough of them. The blue-label Chimay pours a thinner head than expected, but that thin layer sticks around awhile. Ample carbonation with a super-dark caramel color.  I thought I knew my spices, in the kitchen and in the beer world, but there's something in this aroma that I can't describe. It's like an Indian spice, a bit sharp, but sweet too. I'll call it clove, anise, cinnamon and ginger, with some raisin and rum in the background.  A strong anise flavor hits the tastebuds first, followed by a light milk chocalate-soaked raisin flavor that lingers a good while. All spice elements noted in the aroma above come through in the mouth, subtle but clear. A creamy, milky mouthfeel takes the flavors to another level, and I just can't say enough good things about this one. Certainly nothing bad. Even the high 9% alcohol is incorporated well enough that you only notice it in context of everything else that's going on. Superb, superb, superb.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,Osiris9588,3.87,"Served from a 750ml bottle, caged and cork. Pours a dark, dark, amber. The tan head was filled with large bubbles, not very thick or stiff, quickly dissipating with only a suggestion of lacing. The carbonation seemed to be lacking a bit, despite of sizzling bubbles through the center. and along the edges.  Gave off an aroma of sweet roasted malt, plum, and a touch of grassy and floral notes. The flavor was full of sweet candied malts and caramel yeast, plum, and a strong presence of alcohol. The spice barely makes itself known, an afterthought.  The mouthfeel is light--too light for a dark ale--sweet and playful on the tongue, smoothing out into caramel yeast, a touch of bright plum, and finally finsihed off with a flare of alcohol.  Despite it's many positive characteristics, it's a bit heavy-handed on the sweetness for my taste, lowering the drinkablity. I'd be tapped out after one--if fact I struggle to finish the bottle. This was out of personal preference, rather than any flaw in the brewing.  Solid but disappointing in respect to the expectations I held for a Grande Reserve. In fact, I wonder what the conditioning of this bottle has been. Perhaps it is just too young and needs more time in the bottle. Perhaps I need to try it again.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Smooth spicy taste with slight alcohol presense as the brew warms up. Back a few months ago, this was my introduction to Trappists, and I was not disappointed!

215,2512,dblinkhorn,4.75,"Poured from 11.2 oz bottle into a tulip glass.  Appearance - Pours a dark reddish/amber copper-brown, but is black when poured completely, unless held up to a light. The liquid is quite clear unless you accidentally pour some of the yeast sediment at the bottom of the bottle. The head pours quite large...about four fingers. It is soapy and light tan in color. It dissipates at an average rate, leaving a velvety (still a bit soapy, in spots) cap on top of the brew.  Smell - Lots of floral scents on the nose, along with a strong aroma of dark ripened fruits. The hops character is clean and crisp, but it is not as strong as the rest of aroma. The malt smells are sweet, rich, and bready. Notes of spice tie it all together, with obvious aromas of clove and a hint of cinnamon. The alcohol aroma is very light, but easy to pick up on.  Taste - The foundation of flavor is the sweet, bready malt. It is very rich and consistent throughout the taste. The floral notes again play a large part of the taste. The hops are hidden in the background of the flavors, but are light in bitterness and pretty clean tasting. The spices are present but also in the background. There is a pleasing alcohol burn throughout the taste, accompanying more malt flavor and a bit of hop bitterness into the aftertaste. This brew has a quite complex flavor, and all the flavors work in symphony.  Mouthfeel - Perfect carbonation all the way though. There is no unpleasant bite on the tongue, but a nice tingle that holds through the entire taste and lingers a bit into the aftertaste. The brew is medium-bodied and as smooth as any beer you can imagine. It massages your mouth and tongue!  Drinkability - With nice levels of carbonation, a well-hidden alcohol presence, and a superb flavor, don't be surprised if you drink a whole 750ml bottle of this by yourself...in one sitting.  Overall, this is a extremely high-quality trappist brew. Of all the trappist brews, this is definitely my favorite. It has such a nice rounded flavor, perfect mouthfeel, and wonderful smell.

Patchy lacing along the edges.  Strong fruity aromas mixed with hints of alcohol. Small grainy-malty notes. The head is loaded with Belgian fruit aroma themes.  A spicy splash begins the show, settling down to a smooth malty wave. The finish is increasingly dry as it warms, with a strong alcohol finish.  Feels crisp and dry on the tongue with moderate carbonation. Relatively full bodied for an ale of this color. Doesn't feel watered down at all.  A very complex and inviting beer which pulls you in then gives you a kick.

Pours a gorgeous brownish black with a dense head of tiny bubbles that sits for quite a while, fed by a steady stream of ""me too""s running up the sides of the chalice. The smell is lovely, the spice from the oh-so-recognizable yeast mixing with notes of raisin and chocolate. The taste is yeast up front, spicy on the tip of the tongue, then melting to a nutela-like mix and a warming alcohol finish. Mouthfeel is very good, slippery on the tongue and maybe just a whisker thin to support the strong malty/yeasty flavors. The carbonation is excellent and balances the dark character of the beer nicely. The drinkability is excellent. It goes down very easily for a 9 percenter.

Smell is of fresh ripe fruits apples with a hint of maltiness and some fresh bread. Taste is very complex tastes like warm apple cider with hints of roasted goodness maybe with some nice yeast touches in there. This was a very good drink the alcohol was very masked and this drink went down very smooth, it stated on the bottle to let it warm up a bit, but I finished it to quickly because of the smoothness of this, I guess next one I drink I will let it warm up a bit to see if another flavor comes out of it.

This pours a deep brown color and there is a lot of evervescence noticeable the entire time. The aroma is fantastic and somewhat hoppier then I expected from a Belgian ale. This beer drinks more like a wine then a beer, and I think should be sipped and savored slowly to truly appreciate it. Very complex flavors, some malty sweetness, a little sourness, and more then a hint of hops present. What I thought was particularly interesting was if you take a good sized sip and hold it in your mouth for a few seconds, you can feel the carbonation on your tongue. Almost reminiscent of the effect Pop-Rocks or champagne would have. Fantastic beer, but I find it a little pricey to drink on anything other then a special occassion.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Taste- immediatelt hit with a raisin/ prune fruitiness followed by a heavy dose of alcohol!! Mild malt tones finish the taste along with spices (pepper perhaps). Mouthfeel- Fruity but the 9% alcohol is just too high for me. Beer finishes off nicely with a good maltiness.  Overall- A beer that has potential.

Has a nice malty, bready nose on the subtle side with some vinegar/olive traces. Taste is vinegar up front, turning malty after the first swallow, carbonation is brought by the third and a nice balance arrived at in the fourth.

Lots of dark fruity aromas and light bready tones. There is also a slight booziness present, but it's a very positive contribution. It smells like this has aged extremely well.  The taste falls short of expectations. It has definitely lost it's edge over time. Don't get me wrong, it does taste just like it smells. Just like a slightly watered down version.

215,2512,Socrates,4.03,"Bottle poured into crystal wine glass to maximize aroma.  Thick head is a tannish color, medium to large size bubbles giving way to small bubbles upon dissipation. Beer is a nice brown color, opacity gives about 1 inch of visibility.  Smell is very light, some hint of spiciness, but not at all an indication of the flavor, which is much stronger, and enhanced by the active carbonation. Notes of cinnamon and brandy fade to a nice lingering memory of maltiness, carrying the edgy presence of alcohol all the way through. Still, the aftertaste leaves one begging for another swig. However, it is not light enough to permit the consumption of more than one.  I would recommend this beer with a meal where some strength can be used to prepare the palate for each bite, i.e., not a spicy dish. Perhaps turkey with sweet potatoes would be an ideal accompaniment, ideal for thanksgiving, perhaps. I don't think this goes well with salty foods, unlike many other beers.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Aroma of sherry, leather, cocoa and alcohol. The mouthfeel is full with a lot of carbonation. The carbonation softens a bit as the ale warms. Dark malt flavor on the front combines with plummy sort of fruitiness. Woody, oaky rum hits midway with the alcohol. No, masking the 9% here. Some feint chocolate toward the back.  This is easily one that could be aged and I wouldn't mind doing so to see how the flavors change over time. Chimay Blue is a sipper... one to sit back with and enjoy.

The carbonation stays with the drink for quite some time. Very little lacing but the beer was kinda cold. The cork says 11/05 but you can smell the alcohol first and foremost.Fruits malt and nuts are the main aroma after that. Malty sweet flavor meets the tounge and a toffee and cinnamon aftertaste followed by a warm alcohol feel in the back of the throat. This is by far the better of the three Chimay's available.

Complex, dominated by roasted malt and sweetness.  A bit tingly on the tongue in the begining, but as it warms toward room temperature, it gets smoother.  A very nice beer for sipping.

The aroma was malty and dark fruit, mostly grapes and alcohol. As the glass warmed, the alcohol became much more evident in the smell. Ditto for the taste. At first, the flavor was slight malty sweetness, and pleasant clove spices. At mid-glass, the alcohol became the dominant taste. The finish, whiile pleasant, was warming and again, dominated by alcohol.  In conclusion, I enjoyed this beer, and it is definitely a classic rappist Ale. I might drink another on a cold winters night (instead of todays 90+ dgree weather).

Beer is a dark brown with reddish highlights when held up to the light.  Aroma is very complex. Lots of dark fruit [plums, figs] and roasted malts. Also has the distinctive sweetness. Perfect.  Taste is of fermented dark fruits and rather ""winey"". Still has the sweetness. Alcohol is there, but light considering its ABV.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a spritzy, cleansing feel. Rather smooth.  Overall, this is an amazing beer that should be had by all [though some won't like the style]. Certainly, for the style it is a classic. Very distinct.

215,2512,thebarracuda,4.7,"first of all, this beer was corked! (vintage Jan 06) which is what interested me in it in the first place. (at over $12 a bottle, I hope its worth it) It pours a dark brown with a tint of red. It has light floral scents, with a smooth taste, low to mild carbonation and lightly sweet aftertaste. its hard to believe that this is a 9% beer as the alcohol bang isnt there.as it warms up, the flavors emerge into an incredible beer. dang, this is a very easy drinking beer! I mean seriously, I enjoy the flavor, its almost chuggable. (but that would be a waste of perfectly good beer) even warm,(above room temprature) this beer has incredible flavor. wow. certainly pick up a bottle of this next time you see it. hell, hunt for it. You will be impressed!",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,mithrascruor,4.97,"750 ml. bottle poured into an oversized wine glass.  **POP!!!** There goes the cork! That's the first sign you're in for a treat...  Appearance: Pours a deep red/amber brown color, somewhat hazy and mysterious. Looks nearly black, or more like a rustic dark brown, without much light. First pour doesn't have much head, but subsequent ones have a nice, thick (1 in.), foamy off-white head that becomes a shallow, foamy film. You can see the carbonation bubbling up on the edges.  Smell: The beer has an aroma of some rich, deep roasted malts, caramel, a bit of yeast, and some spices and ripe, dark fruits. One of the more complex smells that I've found in a beer.  Taste: The dark fruits made the first contact here, followed by the caramel and then the malt. Extremely rich! Very little bitterness in the taste, though there is a bit of alcohol noticable at the end of a sip.  Mouthfeel: There's quite a bit of carbonation, but it isn't really noticable until just when swallowing it. What's always most surprising to me is that this beer isn't as heavy as you'd expect. Seems to float along the tongue.  Drinkability: Despite the high (9%) alcohol content, this beer is very drinkable. It's incredibly rich in flavor, but as long as you aren't stupid and try to chug this you'll be fine.  This has been one of my favorite beers for a long time, so I finally had to review it here. The aroma is quite possibly the best thing here -- so complex and well balanced. Tastes and looks great as well. If you haven't tried it yet, you should! Spoil yourself with a bottle of this... one of those beers that I always look forward to having. Trappist monks may give up their earthly pleasures, but I'd say this one is rather godly!",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,hunteraw,3.98,"Off-white one-finger head atop a rich brown body. Appears to be highly carbonated, constant stream of bubbles rising. Good head retention.  Smell: some malt, and the distinct Belgian yeast aroma, with a hint of spice.  Taste: Spicy, with some dark fruit character but it's in the background. Enough bitterness to balance, this one isn't overly sweet. Dry, slightly woody finish, with alcohol dominating the aftertaste. On the plus side, that means it finishes dry, which always helps drinkability for me.  Mouthfeel: wow, very highly carbonated, so much so that it gets in the way of enjoying the beer. Fairly light mouthfeel, thinner than I was expecting, I think.  Drinkability: too boozy to be highly drinkable. I really wanted to love this one, but I just like it. Didn't live up to my expectations, at least.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,Estarrio,4.42,"Poured into a wide glass from a 2/06 bottle. My best efforts could not thwart the large foamy head. Color was an opaque muddy brown with hints of red and yellow.  Very pleasing, complex aroma. Sweet malt, caramel, floral hops and fruity esters.  This brew has sweet malt and candied sugar flavors up front with lots of dark fruit esters. The doughy yeast really takes over in a tart, bitter and spicy finish. At 9%, there is a subtle initial impression of alchohol flavor, which becomes less apparent in the aftertaste.  Widely distributed, this beer is an excellent Belgian representative. The complexities and flavor really come out with cellaring.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,HimerMan,4.05,"Bottle served in small goblets on 7/22.  Excellent pour with a tanish head and dark brown body that sustains color and smell throughout.  Mild beer with alcohol present at the start, with a mild fig and brown sugar, spices and typical Belgian flavors that make a sweet, almost wine-like feel in the mouth. Very nice malt balance with a clean and crisp taste throughout.  Overall, the alcohol presents a warming, but not at the expense of taste. Very easy trappist to drink, and easily found at liquor stores. Very nice beer.  I would always look for one of these to enjoy with friends, breads and cheeses. Great beer - buy it, its a great priced beer for what it tastes like.  Cheers.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,jhollick,4.72,"Presentation - Served at cellar temperature from a 75cL bottle with a 04/05 date on the cork.  Appearance - Pours a deep ruby with a brown tint with a sizable and fluffy tan head which dissipated after a few minutes.  Smell - An alcohol warmth greets the nose immediately, followed by a treasure trove of smells, including grapes, raisins, plum, cherries...all sweet and very inviting.  Mouthfeel - Medium to thick in body (about on par with other Belgian strong darks), with a tingle that numbs the tip of tongue. Whether its from the high carbonation level or the alcohol isn't for me to say.  Taste - Magnificent! All of the aforementioned flavors come forth with the candied sugars, transforming from flavor to flavor, sweet to tart, dry to slick and back again. Very complex brew. The alcohol is a tad strong at first, but the mouth quickly adjusts. As the beer warms, it becomes even sweeter and darker in flavor.  Overall - This is a spectacular beer, and well worth the hype that surrounds it. Nothing else needs to be said. This is absoultely one of the best beers I have had.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Poured into pint glass with no floaties , good head , not much lacing sticking around.  Smell is faintly hoppy , some alcohol coming through.  Taste has a butterscotch tone (more scotch than butter); although somewhat muted , possibly from age.  Mouthfeel is crisp , I wouldn't say dry , but balanced. Good carbonation for 3 years in the bottle.  Drinkabitly is great , a very smooth beer for 9%. I may need to age more of this.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

It lingered in the glass and lacing was apparent.  Aroma: Smells of dark malt and slight chocolate. Slight hop spiciness and pleasant alcohol notes that warm the senses in preparation.  Taste: The taste is less pronounced than the aroma. Taste is of malt and dark fruits (dates and figs). A slight caramel note. As the beer warms the alcohol becomes more balanced on the tongue.  Mouthfeel: Slightly creamy with good carbonation. A little cloying and syrupy but not to the point that its a negative.  Overall, this is a very drinkable beer. I like the balance of malt and hops.

215,2512,orfeu,4.12,"33 cL bottle, chilled to just below cellar temperature, poured into a silver-rimmed Chimay chalice. A careful pour yields a deep ruddy brown with a skimming of grey-yellow foam. Yeasty sour clove aromas mingle with scents of vanilla tobacco and green lettuce. Sweet caramel-dipped cherry flavors begin the sip with a cinnamon-roll doughiness at the middle. Allspice and white pepper shore up the back end right before an alcohol-bitter finish. Slick and actively carbonated peppery mouthfeel, medium-to-thin body. As it warms, the mouthfeel becomes fluffier, but not enough to make this outstanding for me. Certainly a good beer, but as far as Trappist beers are concerned, I think I'd choose any of Rochefort's offerings first.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

The smell is very aromatic and I haven't even stuck it up to my nose. Spicy and slightly peppery with dark fruit undertones like plum are prevalent and has nutmeg and a slight clove flavor.  The taste is very watered down except for the strong flavor of alcohol. Letting it warm up gives more flavors like that of the smell.  Mouthfeel is very carbonated and a little hard and dry.  Overall it's something I will try more and more as it comes in fresh to get the full affect of this beer.

Nice mellow tan colored head.  S - Released as the head dissipated. A rich aroma of roasted malt with a sweet overtone with the alcohol highly pronounced.  T - Everything the smell led me to believe. Most prominent flavor is roasted malt with a hint of caramel... Which was followed by a pleasant sweet aftertaste of berries, dried fruit, tart green apple, honey, and dates.  M - Made mouth happy... Carbonation was just enough and so not to be overbearing and a nice alcohol warmth lingers upwards into my nose.  D - No quarrels with this beer. Good alone and good with food.

Not much in the way of any hop characteristics.  T: Nice malt backbone and bitterness. Strong underlying sweetness in the form of non-specific dried fruits. A bit too much for my taste. Sweet grows stronger as the beer warms toward room temp.  M: Nice medium to heavy body. A bit sticky, especially as it warms.  D: Avg drinkability. i would enjoy this on occasion as an after dinner drink. However, I would never have more than one per sitting.  Overall, a good beer, but not great.

Taste: Sweet and toasty, very pleasant alcohol warmth, ripe fruit, finishes dry and clean. Citrusy hop notes. Faint unsweetened chocolate. Banana notes after you swallow.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and lightly carbonated, tingles on the tongue and fades, medium bodied. Not syrupy or sticky, it's so clean.  Drinkability: This beer is delicious. If i had a bunch of these infront of me, with a good meal, at %9 ABV I would destroy myself drinking it. It's smooth and complex, my mouth doesn't get bogged down or saturated with the flavor.

Sweet Dark fruit and yeast taste, followed by some bitterness and more yeasty flavors.  M: Just the right amount of carbonation, which is relativly high, and definatly refreshing. Full mouthfeel.  D: Highly drinkingable and tasty. I look forward to every sip, though the IBV makes this somewhat dangerous.  For the taste and the smell, I can't pin everything down in this brew.

Aroma: Sweet and spicy with hints of the alcohol. (It is 9% after all.)  Taste: Extremely complex but so good. I noticed some caramel malts up front that gave way to some fruity flavors that I can't place in the middle. The finish is dry and peppery, the only point you really notice the alcohol.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth, carbonation in excellent balance.

At first, there was a complex malt presence that altered over the course of the beer. The malts were nice and not overpowering, and there was the slightest bit of cloves present. As the beer warmed up, and the pallet built up to the taste, the malts seemed to take on more of an earthy structure.  Mouthfeel: Meduim-heavy bodied, moderate carbonation.

Pours thick and heavy into my goblet with a full tan head that recedes to reveal impressively dense sticky lacing. Color is a mellow mocha that brightens considerably under the light. Nose is heavily fruity and drenched in alcohol. Hints of coriander and cherries.  Taste shows impressive restraint as far as alcohol and is much easier to drink because of it. Thick on the malt flavor but surprisingly clean finish for a Belgian dark with smooth but slightly overcarbonated mouthfeel. Still, a delicious, refined ale with unusual drinkability for nine percent on the booze-o-meter.

215,2512,Beersignal,4.16,"Small bottle reviewed, exhibits some differences from the 750 ml format I have been told but have never taken the time to fully discover the nuances.  Pours a deep maroon colour with hints of garnet glinting as it is held to the light. The foam is initially generous and spritzy and fades suddenly, leaving a dense film of tan bubbles to float statically atop the brew. No lacing.  The aromas are really what draw me into this beer. This is a cellared sample that I have aged for 3 years so some harmony has been gained in the aromas. It opens with a symphony of malty cocoa aromas, and alternates between firm notes of candied sugar, dried plums, some tanned hide, hints of earth and fungi, as well as mild spices like cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg. Let the brew warm and traces of vanilla begin to surface through the complex of fruit, malt, spice and yeast. Very pleasant... I could sit here all night just whiffing this sample.  This sample has dried quite noticeably from the cellaring. The mouthfeel is firm but dry, giving ample space for the flavour profile to slowly develop as the beer gains in temp. I first notice malt and spices that fade quickly into a spiral of yeastiness and alcohol. The fruit aromas do not carry over as strongly into the flavours but are perceptible and lead nicely into the long and slightly sour finish. A lingering aftertaste reminescent of cigar smoke beckons me to light up a Partagas Mille Fleurs (available in Canada) and finish the sample with a smoke.

I've had this beer quite few times, and after enjoying it more every single time, I feel that it is more then worthy of a review. Pours a dark color with an eggplant color, sort of black, purple and brown all at the same time. There was a large white head at first, that soon faded into a small white one leaving no residue on the side of the glass. Smell was of dark fruits: raisins, plums, cherries, some sweet sugars also. When i smelled this one i got a bit too close and actually snorted some by accident, oh well if there was ever a beer that I actually wanted to snort i guess it would be this one. Anyway, taste was very sweet and rich, with sugar, juicy fruit, figs, molasses, honey, literally a huge spectrum of tastes going to and fro throughout this beer. Mouthfeel was also exceptional, as it was full bodied and delicious. Let this one swirl around the palate, and notice how many new tastes come through with each taste. I would love to drink these as often as i can, it is that good. This is my favorite out of the other Chimays. Next time i'm gonna have to cellar one or two of these.

Taste pretty much mimics the smell and finishes with some hop bitterness. Leaves that nice alcohol warm feeling in the gut. Excellent mouthfeel, very smooth, very creamy and full bodied, a bit chewy.

215,2512,asabreed,4.47,"33 cl. bottle poured into a Chimay chalice.  Appearance: It has the beautiful dark amber / copper color that I love, which even gets a little hazier due to the yeast that I poured in (not swirled but just tipped the bottle to the point where it dislodged and some got in). Maybe it's the temperature, as this is a dried glass that's been sitting by my sink, but there's not really too much head on this, and I don't know why. I figure it has to be something regarding the way I went about it. Either way, the scoring's doing a good job of keeping the head at about 1/2""; there just isn't much lacing.  Smell: Dark cherry, plum, slight fig and raisins, candi sugar, faint banana, tons of yeast, and a mild phenolic presence. Lots of stuff going on. I don't get much hops at all, but maybe it's curbing the fruitiness and balancing out the malt qualities a bit. Still very nice and balanced well.  Taste: The dark plum and cherry are at the forefront, with lots of awesome yeast in there too (I'm a fan of everything in the bottle going into the glass). Slight fig and raisin comes in midway, and it finishes with a faint coat of hops before sliding into dark tropical fruit which lingers on the tongue. Nothing extremely experimental with the style, but everything's done beyond right here, and that needs to be applauded.  Mouthfeel: Near perfect level of carbonation that provides a filling burst in a way, but not spritzy. It ends up adding to the body and filling it out, or slightly taking away a bit from the body. Either way, it's doing it's job, and this is a pretty silky brew.  Drinkability: Without a doubt in my mind this is the Chimay brew to drink and I know I definitely will again. This is a fresh bottle (as in I haven't cellared it), so I wonder what would happen over time. Perhaps I'll have to store one away. Certainly a great example of the style; nothing flashy but excellent and balanced and delicious on all accounts.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,rodrot,3.88,"Poured from a corked and caged 750 ml bottle into a Duvel tulip glass, this beer had a murky reddish brown appearance with a huge frothy head. Strangely, I could not pick up much of an aroma other than a little bit of a malty, toffeeish smell. The taste was very nice however, quite malty and spicy with notes of chocolate, maple syrup, dark fruit and caramel. It also had a pleasing alcoholic warmth.

Many of the qualities that I found in my previous tasting still exist, but overall it's a much more mellow beer. The dominant characters now seem to be a pleasing caramel and toffee malt component along with raisins and figs. The yeast has receded a bit, but there's still a fair bit of breadiness. Overall, it's quite smooth and malty - to me it's improved with a bit of aging.

215,2512,jwc215,4.66,"Poured chilled from small bottle into a Chimay glass. It poured a deep brown with a beautiful, creamy, slightly off-white two finger head. The head was retained, with little loss until near the end, when it became a soft lace. The aroma was fruity/berry like, with hints of alcohol in the background. It smelled more like red wine than beer, though. The taste was simply exquisite. It had a well-balanced taste of fruity (though not citrusy) flavor, mainly of raspberry, along with a malty caramel flavor. The sweet and bitter were well-mixed, along with an alcohol flavoring that made it very complex and delicious. The mouthfeel was refreshing. Along with the complexity, there was just the right amount of water to make it refreshing and drinkable. The alcohol taste does come through, but not enough to overpower any of the tastes. This is an excellent drink to have on a cold, cool, or mild day.

The taste was a fine balance between a roasty malt and more yeasty characteristics. Overall, smooth and well-balanced for a beer that's 9 per cent ABV.

The cork popped open with authority. The aroma was wine-like but it still carried the characterisitcs of caramel and burnt butterscotch(?).

I detected a sweet malt quality as well, possibly from a fruit influence.  The taste is very reflective of the aroma, with spice, and very smooth malt flavour. I detected some sort of fruitiness, that I could not describe, there is alot going on there. Suffice it to say, it was still excellent. Good blance, and good carbonation.  Very easy to drink.

Pours a pretty garnet-brown color with ruby highlights, topped by a creamy khaki-colored head that dissipates a bit more quickly than I would like. Aroma of slightly sweet European malt, Belgian yeast, and notes of raisin and bread, with an underlying whiff of alcohol. Palate is understated - sweet, honeyish malt blended with a touch of Euro hops. Notes of spicy yeast, raisins, plums, and very faint caramel are present. Finish is nice and warm, so as not to let you forget the alcohol content. Body is nice and creamy, but also a tad foamy. Still, right on the mark for the Trappist style.

(We paid $21)  Since the place was very dimly lit, I couldn't quite identify the colors but it appeared cloudy, dark and had a good head.  The aroma was distinctly yeasty with subtle hints of berries and other fruits that I couldn't fully recognize.  We were very excited to try this for the first time but once we sipped on this (very expensive) ale, it just fell short of all the hoopla. I am not saying it is not a good beer, it is actually quite refined in texture (crisp, medium body) and balancing of the high alcohol level but just lacked a full or deep flavor. Or, perhpas I should just say that it was a little too subtle for a Friday night at the bar. I suspect the mild sweetness and spiciness will pair well with rich and/or spicy food. I will give this ale another shot with some food this time and see if can identify any hidden flavors that just didn't come out last night.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

215,2512,DaPeculierDane,3.4,"I was in Chateau Lacour in the heights of the Mastiff Central of Ardeche the last time I had this one. I was never much of a fan of Chimay Blue but for some reason, after several cheap bottles of Rochefort 10, I decided to give it another go. I marched up to my buddy at the bar and ordered a 750, wasnt offered a glass nor did I want one. I took a few swigs and returned to the mosh pit where RATMs Know Your Enemy was blasting. After quickly downing the translucent dark copper brew, I realized something. This had been the best tasting Chimay Grand Reserve I had ever had. The previous two dozen times I had considered it vastly overrated trite. Maybe it was just the after effects of the Rochefort messing with my taste buds, but this bottle of Chimay was vastly better then any I had ever sipped before. Heck, it was almost mediocre.  So heres my beef with Chimay Blue. If Im going to pay as much as this stuff costs, I would like a beer that I dont have to age 3 years before I drink it. Every time I drink a bottle straight from the store or at a bar, I feel like it is an underdeveloped, uncomplicated baby of a beer. Sure its loaded with dark fruits, candied sugar, and lovely Belgian yeasts. They just arent very exciting. Liekwise, the body is reasonably depthful and lightly sour but it lacks vitality. Overall, I just cant understand the hype surrounding this brew when masterpieces like Ommegang rival it so well at a fraction of the cost.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Actually this is only the latest time I tried it, I've had it many times and never remembered to rate it.  Pours with a nice thick off-white foam on top of burgandy colored liquid. You can see the floating yeastie flavor particles. Smells bready and yeasty, competing with Westvleteren 12 and St Bernardus 12 for aroma in my opinion. Really appetizing appearance and aroma.  Tastes fruity and complex, with the flavor moving from sweet to slightly bitter as I drain the glass. I like this every time I try it.  By far my favorite Chimay offering. The Cinq Cents is good in its own right I guess, but the red label leaves you wanting something more substantial.

215,2512,akorsak,4.42,"I am drinking a Chimay Bleu, 750 ml C&C bottle, poured into a corresponding Chimay goblet. The ale is at room temperature.  Appearance: The ale pours with a moderate head, leaving little lace around the mouth of the goblet. The ale has a color that reminds me of muddy creek water. That is to say it is it has a deep brown color with a high level of sediment. I am reviewing this off of the last pour so there is an abundance of sediment in the glass.  Smell: There is a heady alcohol smell on first sniff. After that, a fruity aroma emerges, driven by figs and raisins. There is also a light cookie/malty aroma.  Taste: The ale has a full-bodied, deep taste. First notes to hit the tongue are those of a semi-sweet, rich malty flavor, like a good chocolate chip cookie. From there, some of the fruit flavors emerge, including the raisins as well as some esters from the yeast. On top of all of these flavors, the alcohol is clearly evident, providing a warming sensation with each sip.  Mouthfeel: The ale warms the body as one sips it. The overabundance of flavors can, at times, overload the palate. Overall though, the ale is very pleasant to sip.  Drinkability: The ale is severely limited by both the price tag ($11 for a bomber) and abv.

Cork is hard to get out (I used a corkscrew) and pops with some violence, prob 50ml beer or more escapes to my counter and floor.  Pours 33% head. Smells very bready, sweeter than I recall normal blue label smelling. (I have never had the beer in this presentation before)  Mouthfeel is very nice - beginning to get the 'mouthglow' i associate with some aged strong belgian beers. The chimay taste/yeast is distinct but this is much smoother than a green version of their beer, and it is far sweeter. Also a greenish taste character present, not sure what that is about.  Aftertaste is not special but very nice, once again sweeter than i recall chimay products being.

Taste is consistent with the style and quite good ... very earthy, rich, and complex with the yeast/malt interplay. This one (blue label) has a considerable hop profile as well, adding complexity and a balance to the sweet malt and fruits. This ale has a pleasing warmingeffect and is quite ""alive"" with carbonation and alcohol. Finish is silky and well balanced with a lingering warmth. I've always favored the Chimay blue for some reason, over the others. A standard in my book. If you've not tried it, try it. Among the best in the world? No, but very good and worth the price for sure. Among the best ""everyday"" tripels perhaps.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

There are also spice notes throughout. The taste gave me more of the caramel and malts that I enjoy and a goog balance with hops.

Smell is of raisins, plums, figs, cocoa, candy sugar, and yeasty bread with gentle spices swirling in this mix. Taste is of the same aromas but I can't put it down. The nice caramelized sugar and malt, along with the yeast makes this a right on winner. Mouthfeel is a tad zippy with the carbonation but still remains smooth for the most part, hiding the 9% well in the slightly sweet brew.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,GClarkage,4,"02/09/06- Received as a gift for Christmas of 2004 from a friend.  Presentation- 750ml caged and corked bottle. Not sure of the year. There is a mark on the bottom of the label, but I have not a clue what it means. It's at the very least a 2004 bottle. Poured into my St. Bernardus chalice.  Appearance- Very dark amber in a color. Nice full inch head, a tad off white in color. About average lacing.  Smell- Lots of dark fruits in the nose. In particular some plums and dates. Also has a heavy grape scent. Maybe a touch like some Welchs grape juice and some grape Jolly Ranchers. Nice smell with everything combined.  Taste- Pretty much right on the nose with the scent. Almost a tad vinous in nature. Big grape flavor..sugary grape with a heavy dose of plums and a light note of dates and figs.  Mouthfeel- Higher than average in carbonation. Lasting nice aftertaste.  Drinkability- About what I expected. Very good, but nothing spectacular. Worth the money and will probably pick up again at sometime. Definitely worth trying. Very tasty.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

It is moderate as far as complexity goes.and the taste of grain is evident. The alcohol taste is also noticeible and less than ideal. The mouthfeel is a little sharp and not full bodied.

An off-white, soapy head rushes above three fingers then falls to a thick cap of dense foam with good retention. Spotty lacing. Fusel alcohol in the nose, some roasted malt and dark fruit aromas, and belgian phenols. Sweet dark malt flavor, a hint of plum, and a faint grape skin taste make up a complex palate. Phenols are strong in the aftertaste, and the fusels become spicy- leaving the mouthfeel a touch dry. The carbonation is mild, and the body is medium to full- but subtle hops and spicy alcohol give it a delicate crispness. Some phenols will carry into the finish, and bit of residual sweetness from the roasted malt, but mostly clean and very drinkable considering the style. Overall, an excellent balance of flavor that showcases the marvelous belgian character.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

This beer smells slightly sweet, with only the faintest hints of any fruit. Slight scents of figs and perhaps apples can be detected. The palate reveals much more fruit, mostly dark, figs, dates, brown sugar. Feels quite creamy on the tongue, but lacks the carbonation to lift it. Lingers for quite a while.

Smell is of belgian yeast, dark sugar, fruit, and almost a rye or bourbon type aroma. Tastes like it smells; the dark fruit and sugar is ever present and brought out more by the high alcohol content. the little hops there are have a presence at the end of the beer, providing a nice tart closing bite to a great beer.

The taste is outstanding. Cloves and spice are definately there. The alcohol taste is barely noticable. Another one of those beers that can get up into trouble if you have a case of this stuff.

The finish is dry and alcoholic, not very bitter, it actually tastes like Bourbon, suprisingly. The beer has a medium thickness on the palate, is adequately bubbly, but could use some more body.

215,2512,Tupperwolf,4.4,"Crack of the bottle marked 09/05 on the cork itself; Pours a dark mahogany ruby color that glows in a subtle way with red light when held up to illumination. A frothy tan head bubbles up and slowly recedes to a dished concave centimeter-thick, being visibly fed by streams of bubbles appearing in the depths and climbing up the sides. They're doing their best to keep the head up and look to be doing their job.  Plum, citrus peel on the scent; Lazily fruity zing and zip with just a tiny bit of tartness and some crisp malty scents; It reminds me of Trois Pistoles but isn't so in-your-face, and has a little more malt scent, too.  Wow, that's weird... The first thing I think when I sip it is that it tastes... like Trois Pistoles. Exactly like it, actually. Hell, I'll even be so bold as to cut and paste from that review. Sour-sweet flavors on the palte. Citrus peel, sour grapes, plums, rhubarb, raisins, with a gently warming alcohol that doesn't affect taste, only feel.  The carbonation is zippy and swishy, medium-sized bubbles that swirl around... Some syrupy flavors and tastes left behind.  Okay, I'm really weirded out. I keep going back to my review of the Unibroue beer and have decided that these are almost exactly the same. The only difference is that the Trappist version I now hold in my hand holds a better head and has a little less sour, more malty scent.  This is a great beer and I'm reviewing it with the respect it deserves; But my experience has been seriously diminished by the fact that I can get the same thing for less money from a closer brewery than Belgium.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Aroma is very metallic at first in its chilled state, much less so as it warms. A bit of fig, but more of date. Decent peppery phenolics. Rhubarb. The flavor is sweet, with too much root beerishness, probably helped by a vinous quality. Carbonation is also reminiscent of soda, and at the end there is a sugar/alcohol coating in my mouth. Overall a bit hot, yet soda-like. I have had this a few times and, while I don't remember being thrilled with it (I always preferred the red), I do not remember the blue being this lackluster.

Now I've found others I like more, but this is still a pretty good one.  This particular bottle was quite fresh tasting, surprising as it was bought at Beers of the World who are not known for rotating stock quickly.  Poured dark brown with a nice head but poor head retention. I can't see through this beer - very thick and cloudy. Musty nose, pruny and a little winey. Taste is cherry, raspberry, apricot and a tiny bit of raisin. Alcohol and phenols very apparent in mouthfeel, as is tannin. Astringent. Alcohol burn in the back of the mouth. Sugary finish.

Tastes beautiful, raisins and cloves with the classic belgian breadiness and not even a hint of the 9% ABV, which is hidden magnificently. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, and nicely warming.

Well, I've liked others of the style, but this particular offering leaves me wanting. It pours nice and dark. The colour reminds me of a well-made cigar, actually. It smells heavenly, wow, prunes, prunes, and more prunes with a light alcohol lacing. What more could you want? The taste and mouthfeel is where this particular offering falls flat on its face. I mean, the taste isn't bad, just one dimensional. The mouthfeel is thin, very thin. I've noticed this with Belgians in general. Carbonation does not equal body!!! But, alas, I am of the germanic drinking tradition, where a nice thick mouthfeel is essential for a pleasant taste. Heavily carbonated and bubbly, it isn't a bad mouthfeel . . . just thin. No love here. The taste is OK. It makes me long for a Gulden Draak, or any of Unibroue's products. Actually, it makes me want a Korbinian. Man, why do all dark belgians make me want that beer? They are close, but oh-so-far. A good brew, don't get me wrong, but certainly not worth the pricetag!",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Aroma: Rich, malty, evident alcohol, earthy, rum and fruit. It has a very Chimay aroma to it, I love their yeast! Hints of aniseed and chocolate.

It's very dark red and has a rich rich malt with a slight raisin taste. It has that characteristic Belgian funk that really adds to the experience by making it taste and feel more substantial. I don't know what kind of hops were used, but they were fantastic. To top it all off, this beer is 9%ABV and doesn't taste like it at all and probably even adds to the thickness this beer exudes.

The appearance was as expected; burgundy color with a lovely head that stays around. Aromas of plums, grapes, alcohol, and caramelized sugar come out, but they don't seem to be working together. This was my first inkling that I was in for a surprise. The taste was just too much with overwhelming sweetness upfront followed by a moist bitterness that left me not wanting anymore. The aftertaste was more sour and dry than would be enjoyable and the drinkability is low because I didn't want to finish my goblet.

215,2512,andjusticeforale,4.97,"Pours to the top of the letters on the Chimay chalice. Deep reddish-brown with bubbly -fine carbonation, heavy in body enough to produce large bubbles that form just below the head. It looks a lot like Gulden Draak, perhaps a bit darker.  The smell is yeast and bubble gum with clove; banana bread, and a faint touch of raisins.  Upon first taste, and mine was slightly chilled, the carbonation sits right in the middle of your tongue and will not let the beer meander around your mouth. The mouthfeel and carbonation here are perfect; alive, vibrant- yet subtle, and certainly not watery and apple-juice type feel of a stout; this is more like a cross between pepsi and mineral water.  The alcohol present on the first few sips does create a medicinal, and I have read, I must note correctly, a menthol taste. This bitterness balances the sweetness factor. But... as the beer warms, the sweetness wins and the menthol subsides, however, there is always bready-yeasty dryness at the end of each sip; a superb bittersweet hint of apple skin and cappucino.  Compared to the other big Trappist products, the Rochefort 10 and (Ive never had Westy 12) but St. B Abt 12, and the like; I would say that this beer is not inferior, neither by style nor the fact that it is marketed and accessible; There is a subtlety in this beer that makes it tremendous, and an accessibility to the Trappist genre that makes it a great gateway to beer appreciation.  Perhaps what this beer has that some of the huge quadruples cant achieve is drinkability- This is a world class beer with truly high drinkability.

Drinkability: I have always liked Chimay products in general. This is eminently drinkable. I do think that this beer does gain from cellaring.  This bottle was dated 2003.,Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,DarkerTheBetter,4.57,"This beer pours a dark honey brown in the middle, a lighter candy apple red towards the edges and a light gold and cherry around the very edges of my glass. The head is a soft tan film that is instantly revitalized with a swirl.  Smells of honey and pastry dough with a slight walnut and a light carbon dioxide sour sting. Theres also a little bit of alcohol that drifts through, especially when it warms.  Tastes of gooey pastry dough, honey and again, the light CO2 like sting. In the finish a dry mossy oak makes its self known. After a few seconds, a dry and nutty honey flavor is left lingering on my tongue.  The mouth feel is extremely light and it tends to sting just a little.  Very tasty. I wouldnt mind having a case of this lying around.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,Hibernator,4.5,"Chimay Peres Trappistes (Blue) 11.2 oz brown bottle Served in a wide mouthed wine glass  Pours a hazy deep brown color. Spotted sticky lacings all over the glass.  Whiffs of Belgian funk, plums and raisins.  Pressured mouthfeel with a natural, funky Belgian yeast kick. Sweet prunes with a brown sugar blast flavor and a clean finish. Very, very drinkable and a perfectly constructed beer.  Great beer. Complex in different flavors and very tasty. What else can you say? This is a real beer. It's a landmark in craft brewing. One of the best Chimay has to offer and worth seeking out. Recommended.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

215,2512,Weizenmensch,4.02,"From 330mL bottle 2004 vintage, best before 2008 (no specific date available on bottle. Served slightly warmer than usual.  Appearance: Warm mahogany colour with a trace of red inside. Good head retention, particularly given the high serving temperature and ABV. Looks good in a Chimay chalice, some fine sediment at bottom of glass. Seems to have low but consistent carbonation.  Smell: Rich and fruity. Christmas pudding (possibly due to rum, raw sugar or stone fruit esters), molasses, dates, and maybe some rye. Festive!  Taste: Immediately, what tastes like refined sugar, or maybe it's raw sugar of some kind with the souring effect of the carbonation. Not as complex as the smell, and more watery than expected (though this again may be due to the serving temperature). A faint but long lemon sweetness on the tongue, lasting onto the palate. Mildly bitter hops add a nice complexity. Generally sweet and rich but rather thinner than I would have expected. I guess that's mouthfeel though.  Mouthfeel: Disappointingly thin for such a rich-smelling ale. Some sharpness is imparted by hops and sour esters, but it's generally not as full-bodied as I remember. Maybe it's been served too warm and might have gone a little flat as I write this. Not bad but not great.  Drinkability: On a cold night, great. If you can afford it, a few of these would go down well. Not a huge session beer for summer, though... one as your second beer would be best, if at all. Full of flavour, but not as gelatine-thick as some other strong Belgian ales.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,sinistermadman,3.53,"Pours a cloudy prune juice color with a nice foamy lace. Smell is of ripened fruit and yeast.  Taste is received first by the malts. Very creamy malt flavor followed by alcohol warming and a wet newspaper taste. Hop bitterness is not as evident as the astringency of the alcohol. Not bad, but not that memorable in my opinion.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,wingnutter,4.45,"Corked 750ml, 6/05 vintage. Drank from a Chimay goblet.  Pours a nice dark caramel color, nice fluffy head that laces nicely.  Smells like toffee, fruit, malt. Very sweet smelling. Not much else.  Taste: Smooth as can be. Sweet malt with a fruity background. Very complex. Like candy in a bottle. Very tasty - caramel, peach, apple, maple, and a hint of yeasty, nutty goodness. I didnt detect any alcohol until it warmed up - its VERY well hidden.  Mouthfeel: Soft, silky and buttery. This is one of the smoothest beers Ive had. And I mean SMOOTH. Slides down my throat with a nice ever-so-slight hint of alcohol and warmness as it gets closer to room temperature.  If I didnt know betterI I would have never believed this was a 9% beast. It actually got sweeter as it warmed. Maybe I got lucky and got a superb batch, but I dont remember it being this good when I first tried it about 6 months ago. I will revisit again when a new shipment comes in and see if it holds up to this one.  Drinkability is great, but dangerous with the ABV. I could drink this all night, any night, every night.  One of my new favorites, and Im a hophead. One of the few non-hoppy beers I would NEVER turn down. The price is steep, but good beer is the one indulgence I dont mind spending money on.. At $8.00 a 750ml (about $4.00 a 12oz), I think its worth having a bottle or 2 on hand at all times for special occasions or when you just want to treat yourself to a world class brew.  Excellent, excellent beer. Simply brilliant.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,burnstar,4.7,"Shared a big bottle of this at Zeno's. This beer is a nice dark, cloudy, and maybe a bit dark red. Nice big tan head which leaves some excellent lacing. Aroma is very sweet malt with lots of fruit complexities- apples, cherries, and strawberries can all be detected along with a bit of nice yeastiness in the background. Taste is malt again with tons of fruit complexities and some spicyness and yeastiness . This stuff has some nice bitterness to balance it all out as well along with a hint of alcohol- there's really a lot of stuff going on here and I like it. Has a nice full-bodied, not overly carbonated mouthfeel. Very warming and pretty drinkable for such a huge beer. Awesome stuff overall.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,whartontallboy,3.28,"Pours out cloudy brown with ruby highlights and a generous brown/tan head that holds okay, but doesn't leave a ton of lace.  Smell is dark fruits, bubblegum, alcohol, and a little bit of maltiness. The yeast is pronounced, too.  Taste is interesting, it's certainly got a nice little spicy kick to it, some bubblegum flavors at the front, liquor-soaked dark fruit, but overall, the flavor has a bit too much alcohol in it and is a little too hot at this young age for me. It's okay now, and it might turn positively fantastic if I'd aged it for a few years. But...I just thought this one tasted okay. Especially in such a fantastic style, I'd much rather pick up a 750 of Ommegang for basically the same price as what I'm paying for a small bottle of this. The flavor just doest settle out, and the thin mouthfeel is less ""spritzy"" and more, well, thin.  Overall: Not terrible, but I can't see ever seeking this one out again. I thought the red and white were not-quite-stellar, but I far preferred them to this one.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,TastyTaste,4.28,"750 mL bottle opens with a satisfying POP and some foggy smoke rising from the bottle.  Apearance: Christens my Chimay goblet with a huge frothy tan head, about 2"" after an aggresive pour. Head fades rockilly and unevenly. Body is hazy and dark maroon, with lots of carbonation rising from the shield emblem etched into the bottom of the glass.  Smell: Sweet toffee and dark fruit, belgian yeast funk. Bubblegum and strawberries. Smells good.  Taste: Sharp and tangy, orange and grapefruit are immediately present, somewhat sour and funky. Alcohol provides a sharpness. Slightly drier, vinous flavors finish. Somewhat raw, could be laid down to mellow for, oh, a decade.  Mouthfeel: Alcohol is strong and provides a warming sensation. Full and goes down slick.

Appearance is damn amazing , has lots of floating bubbles and does stay fresh along time after pourn into chimay cup. Somewhat cloudy and dark but overall nice.  Smell is pretty decent has a good belgian sence with a bit of a darker side due to it being ""Bluaw""!  Taste is good , did remind me of a good wheat beer but a had to been a bit sour or something.  Mouthfeel is pretty good you can drink this and not mind it for awhile.  But drinkability if another factor ... goes down sour with a bunch of old chimay yeast floating in the bottle's.

215,2512,becktone,4.88,"When poured into my glass this beer has an amazing appearance. The color is a dark brown/dark amber color and has a very large head. The head would have been bigger than 2.5 inches but I wasn't paying attention while I poured and my glass started to overflow. The beer appears to have a very full body. It also has excellent head retention, the head never gets smaller than a quarter of an inch. The head doesn't remind me of soap like any macro brew would, instead the color of the head is more of an off white/tea stain color. Its appearance also is much creamier than most heads on beer.  The smell of this beer reminds me of sparkling white grape juice. I also detect a hoppier smell behind the prevalient grape smell. As the beer warms up it is definitely easier to detect other smells and tastes, so here I wait. After waiting a bit I notice that the aroma of the beer has not become any stronger or changed that much, however it still smells extremely good.  The taste of this beer is amazing, I recommend this beer to anyone who loves beer. I can almost guarantee that you'll like it. The first thing I notice when I drink this beer is the slight bitterness that I feel on the back of my tounge, this bitterness is perfectly balanced by the sweetness/flavor of grapes that is left on the front of your tounge and in the entire mouth once the beer is swallowed. The taste of this beer is very complex, I really can't even begin to describe it except that it is amazing. Besides the sparkling white grape juice flavor and the bitterness there is a third flavor that is coming out now that the beer is getting warmer, maybe a butterscotch flavor, I can't really tell but it reminds me of the overall flavor of Leffe Blonde. I really think that this is the best beer I've ever had.  The beer feels great in the mouth it has a full body that fills up the mouth and the carbonation of this beer is perfect. The feeling of this beer is very satisfying in the mouth.  I will most definitely be buying more of this beer in the near future. I am very impressed by this beer, can't wait to buy some more of this stuff. I am very happy that I bought the one pint 9 ounce bottle after buying and drinking the small 11.2 ounce bottle. I just hope that the store I got the pint from still has some in stock. If I could I'd drink this all the time.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,WTexas,3.85,"Served from a 750ml bottle with 03/05 stamped on the cork. The champagne-like pop set the tone for my drinking experience. This ale had a small but pleasant head that remained throughout. Initial aroma was pungent and sour (yet intriguing), not unlike a lambic. Taste was smooth with the presence of alcohol becoming more prominent as the ale warmed. Mouthfeel was agreeable with the carbonation never overwhelming the omnipresent fruit-like flavors. Easily drinkable, but at $7.99/bottle, its one to be saved for special occasions.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,Bitterbill,4.18,Poured a beautiful golden bown....one of the nicest beers sitting in a glass ever.  The head was fairly huge but calmed down after a few minutes to a fine layer with wonderful lacing. The smell was a nice fruity-malty thing going on that I enjoyed spending some time doing.  The taste is malt and fruit with just a slight hint of cloves and the 9%abv is pretty well hidden. Good stuff.,Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Smells like it looks, a dark heavy Belgian. About 1.5 to 2 fingers of head, laced alright.   Taste almost has a hint of wine, just as the beer leaves the tongue, then dissipates fairly quickly. Nice and crisp, in this sense.   Drinkability...I wouldn't recommend having too much of it at once, it is a 9% alc/vol beverage. But if you're with discerning friends, then popping the cork on this one is more than worth it (yes, the bottle I got had a cork).",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,Naes,3.71,This one pours a murky dark brown with a large off white head. The aroma is malty sweet with hints of dark fruit. Its flavor is quite similar to the aroma. Dark fruit character and malty with just the slightest hint of alcohol and a bit of spice.

215,2512,EStreet20,4.45,"I've always loved this stuff. 750 ml bottle poured into my Chimay Chalice.  A - What a Belgian strong dark should look like in my opinion. Dark brown with a tiny red tint and a nice thick head that shrinks a tiny tiny bit. However after shrinking to a centimeter or so the head goes nowhere for the rest of the drink and leaves a nice lacing on the chalice.  S - A sweet malt smell with some Balgian yeast. A bit of a smicy kick at the end of my ""sniff"" as well. Raisins and some other sweet fruits in there.  T - Sweet malty flavors. Some hints of berries coming through here. A bit of a spicy finish, like a peppery character you get in a lot of belgians. A great tasting beer overall.  M - Very smooth, a beer you can ""chew on"". The carbonation gives it a bit of a tingle too. Not much of a warming sensation, as the alcohol is masked in the feel as well as in the flavor.  D - A great sipper. As far as Belgian strong ales go this drinkability is full speed ahead, but it's obviously not one to pound due to the 9% ABV.  Notes: Basically my banchmark for this style at this point. Can't wait to pick up the Rochefort 8 and compare it.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Impressive. Aroma of yeast that has been sitting, dark fruits, and some roasted nuts. Taste was along the same lines; Flavors of earth, herbs, spices, malt and yeast are noticeable, with nuances of roasted nuts and aged tobacco. Mouthfeel was smooth and rich, giving no indication of the 9%ABV. Drinkability for some reason doesn't seem all that high, as I think this brew is one you'd only want every once in awhile.

Balanced slightly toward the sweet side, bitterness provided by the dark malts, no appreciable hop flavour.  M: Moderate body, moderate to high carbonation.

Smell: Definitely a lot of caramel and some darker fruits, dates and raisins.  Taste: Follows the smell, lots of fruit and caramel with the trademark Belgian malitness. Dryer than some other similar brews.  Mouthfeel: A lot more carbonated than I was expecting. A medium-bodied brew for one of the darker Belgians I've had.  Drinkability: Obviously, the ABV and cost of this brew will limit me to drinking a max of one bottle. Definitely a sipper and a brew to share, especially if you plan on driving in the near future.  Overall a nice dark Belgian that's definitely got some unique traits.

I'm not getting as much as I expected here. Could be that I just stored/served the bottle too cold.  Rich flavor with plenty of component flavors to consider. Fruity, wine-like, but with a definite malt presence. Spicy like many Belgians I have had, but not as sweet as I expected, based on word of mouth, other reviews etc. I get some brown sugar hints, but it's much more about spice than sugar. The alcohol is there, but not obtrusive, mildly warming.  Mouthfeel is smooth, but mildly chewy. Not heavy, but certainly no light lager, either.  Drinkability is good overall.

215,2512,SaCkErZ9,4.3,"Poured from the draft into a Chimay wide mouthed goblet. A light grape like amber color with a perfect head that stays throughout the entire beer. A very pleasant looking beer on a rainy North Carolina autumn day. Excellent fruitiness and hoppines in the aroma. Smells a bit like berries, maybe raspberries and blueberries. Terrific spiciness to the hops with citrus aroma and a touch of peppermint and molasses. Raisins rear a head as well. Quite a hoppy beer. Great balance between the fruitiness of the hops and the power with the fairly strong alcohol. The alcohol doesnt really become an issue until the end of the beer. But at that time it is welcome as it has changed flavors once again; melding and changing and evolving more and more after each sip. Hops are not as strong at the end where the alcohol is, but the malts and the fruit flavors are enhanced quite dramatically. This beer is best at the end or served slightly cooler than room temp. Wonderful nouthfeel with the hop bite and the alcohol to soothe. Very pleasant. I would drink this beer all day if I could.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Sticky and arrogant all the way down. This bitch has an attitude.  Huge dark fruit complexity that is balanced by caramel and a slight bitter twang. Warming is not shy and welcomed for this brew. Smooth creamy mouthfeel thats not too rich and fairly drinkable when taking the style into consideration.  Notes: For the price tag this is one of the premiere beers in the world.

Sweet with maple and raisins... allspice, apricots, fig brown sugar, molasses... absolutely brilliant.  The alcohol is in the forefront on the palate... it smoothly trickles back to a malty finish. Sweet and fruity. After the third drink I remembered I had fresh figs... wow. This pairs so nicely with the fresh figs. Tasted of dried fruits and very slightly nutty.  A good mouthfeel, as well.

Very rich, very bready, malty sweet, almost like a cola. Brown sugar, cherries in syrup, maybe a touch of brandy and cigar flavors. A twinge of yeast at the end. Not much bitterness to be found.  Mouthfeel is lively despite its heft, well-carbonated. Alcohol flavor is not apparent but this is a sipper, nice for winter. Not bad, but I've found better in this style; I'd be curious how aging affects this one. Would pair nice with a cigar, as it might balance out this beer's sweetness.  Small 12-oz bottle.

Had to pour half a glass at a time, as the other half of the glass would just be foam for ages.  Smell - Hints of citrus, and mostly a dark malt, and roasted nuts.  Taste - Man, this is a complex brew. When it's colder, you get mostly malts and a hint of roasted nuts and dark fruit. As it warms, a sense of raisins/dates comes to the front, and the nuts take on complexity. Extremely tasty, and very rich.  Mouthfeel - This is definitely an unfiltered beer. You can feel the thickness of it as you drink, lots of malts have gone into creating the effect. A pleasure to drink, but so rich you have to take your time.  Drinkability - As wonderful as this beer is, I challenege you to finish a bottle in an hour. It took two of us the entire length of a movie to finish a half bottle each.

Little to no lacing as the head was big bubbled goodness; not sticky.  The smell held funky malts. A twang of the suitable Belgian aroma yielded a light presence of barley malt. Deeper whiffs uncovered a sense of baked banana bread.  Flavor was malty and nutty, with more of the suitable Belgian funk. This brew was rich in taste and feel. A light bitterness in the finish created incredible balance for the never overwhelming sweetness. For its dark presence, it was remarkably light in the mouth, carbed perfectly.

Mouthfeel has very good medium body, creamy with noticably carbonation.  Taste is complicated but very smooth. Fruit and spice balance each other nicely, achohol is noticable but not overpowering. Fruit is more on the Estery side. Rarely does a beer overwhelm my tounge the way this beer does. It hits every part, sweet, salt, bitter, sour, but in a way that does not overpower any part.  Overall this is a serious beer. Powerful, potent, tasty, but balanced. I look forward to trying more Trappist style beers soon.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,Dithyramb,4.55,"I've neglected Chimay for quite a while, basically since I noticed that I could rather enjoy Ommegang for only $5). I was in the mood for something special last night, after wandering into Chesapeake Fine Wine in the mood for antipasti and pizza. Poured heavily into a thick Chimay chalice, you get a beautiful dark reddish brown brew with a fluffy off-white head. Could have used a bit better retention or lacing, but that could have been the glass. Delicious malty aroma that was both fruity and nutty. Creamy, malty, delicious fruits, nuts and berries dance around with a perfect combonation of carbonation. Highly drinkable, the 750 didn't stand a chance. The only thing holding it back is the price here in the states...",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,cracgor,4.36,"Appearance: Dark cherry red with a light tan rocky head. Tons of carbonation. Good retention.  Smell: A burnt fruity smell. Estery with bananas, cherry, apple, and a sour note.  Taste: Very sweet up front. The fruity smells do not translate to the taste, but it is an excellent balance of a roasted malt and a less complex ester flavor than the smell would hint at.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied. Not alcoholic in the mouth at all, but definitely feel warmth in my stomach. Quite a smooth feel to it.  Drinkability: I love beer like this. Can sit around drinking it and thinking or have it with a nice meal. Very versatile, but I wouldn't go around getting hammered off this stuff.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,fisherman34,4.29,"Dark brown in color with an off white head. A delicate and complex brew. Smells of mint, a just-opened box of wooden matches, spices, and yeast. Intricate flavors of yeast, subtle berry fruits, caramel, and toasted oak. Full mouthfeel with a fair bit of carbonation. Quite important to drink this one at a slightly warm temperature to get all of the aromatic and flavor nuances. WOW!",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,thesilverhand,4.33,"Sits beautifully in the Chimay chalice. Deep, deep, hazy chestnut brown. What little light escapes at the bottom of the glass reveals nice red tones. It is capped by a massive dome, peaking well above the rim of the glass, of creamy, foamy, yellowed beige foam. It's the colour of old paper, and leaves a nice lace as I drink.  My nose brings images of dark, sweet fruit - raisins. The alcohol is also much more obvious than I expected.  Deep malty complexity - sweet, again with the raisins. It's a bit vinous. I get a sense of grape skins. Coupled with the alcohol, the finish is dry, much like a dry red wine. There is a light spiciness that sets this treat apart, though. Can't quite place it.  For the depth of colour and flavour, this sits quite lightly on the palate; I suspect this is thanks to the active carbonation which provides the long-lasting head of foam. Very enjoyable.  While it is largely a matter of personal taste, this is by far my favourity Chimay...this is a beer I will happily and heartily recommend.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Aroma is a nice blend of fruits; i detect apple, pear, fig and plum as well as candy sugar, and light hints of chocolate, phenols and herbal hops. Flavor is very complex and the profile changes as it warms; first you get a big fruit flavor with hints of apple, pear, fig and plum as well as slight hints of chocolate and a nice candy sugar sweetness, then there are some phenolic flavors and a lightly bitter hop flavor (grassy, hop tea and mineraly) that dries out the brew for the finish and balances quite well. Mouthfeel is smooth with a medium to heavy body and a moderate carbonation that increases drinkability. A very nice brew, complex and delicious...another winner from Chimay.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

The head was nice and thisk with good lacing that lasted the duration of the tasting, and being that this was a 750, thats pretty damn good. The smell is heavy with cherry/chocalate, coffee, hazelnut, and alcohol. On tasting, the sweetness of this nectar honed in with sharp esters of chocalate, plums, coriander, orange zest and butter. The body cleans up with the subdued alcohol taste. The mouthfeel is a dream with subtle carbonation that stays in line with the creaminess.

Glass was nicely laced. S: Had a wonderful complex aroma. I could smell mixed fruits and a sweetness. T: Taste was very complex and changed as the beer warmed. Very bitter and hoppy, yet fruity and sweet at times. First beer that I could actually taste the alcohol. Best if slightly chilled. D: Not a beer you could drink a lot of or drink often. Can't imagine drinking it with a meal b/c of the complexity of it's taste. But certainly a beer worth recommending and trying. This is a beer to sip and savor.

Thank you to our legislators here in NC for popping the cap and allowing us the opportunity to enjoy beer greater than 6% abv!  Color, flavor, aroma, and drinkability were all great! The depth and complexity were amazing and at one point I wondered what my life might be like as a monk in Belgium.

The head subsided, but never departed entirely.  Nose: Brown sugar, molasses, a freshly opened bag of marshmallows, hints of banana and cedar.  Palate: Big and sugary, balanced with spicy notes. Tones of cocoa and banana with just a bit of a mineral backbone. A subtle, Campari-esque bitter tinge at the end of the lengthy finish.  Those Trappists.

Leaves a nice edge layer with nice lacing. Very little light gets through my glass as I attempt to look through it.  Dark malts on the nose with a bit of fruit (grapes possibly) and a bit of oak. Nothing fancy; not what I expected.  Sipping, I get a sweet caramel flavor with grapes and even some oak wood flavors mainly throughout. Maybe a rasberry chocolate flavor?  Sharp carbonation, I expected it to be a bit softer on the palete, along with a bit of alcohol drying on the finish. Not too shabby, but I did expect a bit less carb.  Overall, a nice tasting full bodied brew, that only has one knock- the amount of carbonation that killed my palete.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

I can smell this as soon as I begin pouring. A smell like ripe fruit.  A slight roasted malt flaovr with strong fruity sweetness and and a very slight sourness. As it warms the beer got drier and fruityier, with less sweetness.  Very smooth with lively carbonation and moderate body.  For as dark and strong, this is a very drinkable brew!",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,SkeeterHawk,4.05,"Appearance: Deep mahogany color that is a tad cloudy. The beer pours with about an inch of off white foam that looks like it is going to stick around. The beer is so dark that you can't really tell if there are any bubbles rising. You would assume that there are because the head lasts so long.  Aroma: Perhaps my senses aren't in the best shape right now, but the aroma is really mild to me. I get a bit of toasty aromas along with a tad of raisin or plum, and that is about it.  Taste: I am probably going to have to edit my review and give this beer another shot with a fresher palate. Right now I get a resiny /syrupy impression that is made much lighter by the adequate carbonation. There isn't one flavor that is noticeable above the rest, so that is what makes a world-class beer...right?  Opinion: I am a bit shocked that my palate is so blasted. I have been drinking Saisons tonight, so this beer is really smooth and clean in comparison. I have drank this beer on many occasions, and I'll plan to score it according to how I know it to be.

Quite a lovely head... it just seemed to stay forever (well, for as long as we could keep liquid in the glass).  It had a beautiful nose. I couldn't quite break it down to individual fruits, but it was fruity.  The taste kept changing... it hit you when you first taste, then returned different flavors until the long aftertaste.  It's mouthfeel was very BIG.  I don't believe that I could drink this all night, but I'd like to try. I well made beer by all respects, just with the ABV, I'd be finished before it was through slapping me around.

215,2512,danielharper,4.42,"Purchased from Woody's Smokes and Brews, Franklin, TN.  This one pours a nice dark brown color with purple and dark reddish overtones. It has a thick off-white (almost brown) head that dissipates over time into a fine white foamy lacing on the top of the glass.  The scent reminds me more of a dopplebock than a Belgian -- kind of malty, roasty, mildly-hopped aroma with just a hint of alcohol. I find myself drawn into the beer because the aroma is so unexpected.  So strange is the disconnect between aroma and flavor here -- it seems like the beer alternates between tasting like a dark Belgian and some sort of heavy bock beer. At first it has a bitter flavor with the malty elements mentioned earlier, then it moves on into a sweetier, much fruitier and balanced flavor, and upon swallowing it moves back the other way, leaving a bitter aftertaste. Very strange and intruiging behavior for a beer, and the complexity leaves me wanting more.  Mouthfeel is good, moderately thick with low carbonation. Swishes around the mouth nicely but doesn't coat like some other beers. Quite enjoyable.  Overall drinkability is fairly high -- for a beer that's this high in alcohol, it goes down smooth and does not give me anything of an unpleasant aftertaste. At $5.00 a bottle, this beer isn't something I can afford every day, but it's almost one that I _wish_ I could afford every day.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

I did enjoy this beer, but I thought there were many similarities to Chimay Red and it wasn't quite as complex as I thought it would be.  Chimay Bleu pours a dark murky brown color with two fingers of tan foam that last for about 5 minutes. Very appetizing appearance. The smell consisted of some ""dry fruitiness,"" yeastiness, and some spice-like qualities as well (reminded me of cinnamon a little bit). Overall, a pleasing semi-sweet aroma. The mouthfeel was smooth on the palette and had some light carbonation. The taste itself was somewhat sweet, as the maltiness had a ""dark fruitiness"" to it. The spice-like flavors carry over too, and some light alcohol flavors appeared as well. Seeing how this was bottle-conditioned, it has a distinct yeastiness here too (very Belgian tasting). The overall flavor profile reminded me of the Rood, but this is a bit more flavorful and a bit dryer too. The fruity aftertaste lingers on for awhile as well as the dryness, and it finishes up with a good alcoholic warmth.  This was a smooth, flavorful beer, but I did expect a little more out of it.

215,2512,BEERchitect,4.53,"Any opportunity to enjoy a chalice of Grand Reserve is a special moment for any beer drinker. I don't take these lightly as it as regal and reverent as any in the history of the world.  Dacanting the beer, a dance of growing effervescence and rich barley-soaked elixir separate with a dark ruby liquid that settles underneath a blanket of creamy and lightened tarnish foam. Retention and lacing are utmost prominent as both are displayed as well as in any beer consumed. Hazed with a vale of yeast, the beer is nearly as mysterious as it is handsome.  A world of aromas are displayed as each visit of the nose to the glass reveals wave after wave of aromas that include dried fruits, peppercorn, vinous grape, candied malts, alcohol zing, and thirst whetting acidity. Every swirl of the glass gives new impressions of aroma time after time.  Strong and sweet, the power of the beer is firm and proud while boasting a candy-coated taste of fruitcake, ripe berries, pitted fruits of dates and raisins, red wine must, red grapes, tart apples, and a plethora of candy-sweet fruit that go on and on. Balanced by the most simple hop additions but more so by the yeast-derived spices of freshly cracked peppercorn, white pepper, cinnamon, and a hint of hazelnut give the beer companion to its fruitiness and a reprieve from the candied sweetness.  Tremendously robust as the culmination of rich malt and explosive carbonation engulf the mouth with a sensation of alcohol warmth, powdered sugar, and hoppy/peppery zeal. As the beer seemingly dissolves before finish, it seems that the beer whimsically disappears on the palate for a fulfilled sip that ends in uninterrupted dryness yet full vinous flavor in aftertaste.  A special tasting of a well aged 16-year old versions (1996 vintage enjoyed in April '12) at the cellars of the Chimay monistary reveals less hop bitterness, less peppery bite, but heightened sherry-like vinous quality that melds together wonderfully with a smooth powdery finish and surprisingly creamy yet low-lying carbonation.

There isnt a real dominant maltiness or hoppiness with this beer. It does finish slightly sweet but not sticky. Pretty tasty actually. Mouthfeel is better than average for this style.

As I was tasting this beer for the first time, I wasn't sure if it lived up to the expectations but as I look at my ratings for the five categories, it really was a great beer.  This is a great looking beer, especially poured into the right kind of glass. Big, healthy head with a dark chocolate color on the beer. I expected it to look lighter but this one poured dark. The smell is lightly sweet and malty. Nothing too much but simple and pure, with perhaps a bit of flower fragrance.  This beer feels great in your mouth. You notice the carbonation but only because it is there, not because it gets in the way. The bubbles are very fine, like champagne, and add to the feeling. It is smooth and chocolatey, a great malt flavor when it first hits your tongue. As it moves back and you swallow it, the light, dry hops add some bite. This is the reverse to a lot of beers I've had where the dryness leads and the malt finishes. The alcohol content wasn't noticeable, either. It blends in well. And since it is a beer you want to slow down and savor, it shouldn't be a problem as you enjoy it.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

I guess that's a good thing considering the quality of the beer.  A truly beautiful appearance, creamy head that took a minute of so to setting. Gave off wonderful aromas- peach, clove and that unmistakable Trappist trademark of alcohol esters. Tremendous lacing.  Phenomenal taste. I find myself inhaling the vapors before every sip. Each sip starts robustly and ends smoothly, tickly on the mouth. Warming me on a miserable late spring New England afternoon.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

The smell is awesome, quite strong and you can instantly smell malt and fruit. The taste is very smooth and strong with hints of fruit. Mouthfeel is smooth and nicely carbonation.At first I didn't really care for this ale, but after just a few more sips it grew on me rather quick. The only thing that might turn some people off is the amount of yeast in the beer.

This pours into a Chimay glass with a big frothy light brown head. The head is long lasting and has good lacing. This pours with a light cloudyness.  It has a mild aroma of malt and some alcohol.  Thhis is a malty full bodies beer with a creamy mouthfeel and soft carbonation. It has an average flavor duration with a moderate to heavy sweetness. Light acidity and bitterness offset by the sweet malt that has a caramel flavor that lasts as a nice aftertaste.,Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Dark amber, like maple syrup, only all hue-y, like it's lighter at the bottom of the glass than it is at the top and it's not just a trick of light because I've gone all over the place with this glass and it keeps doing the same the thing.  Smells like malt, fruit, and flowers. Grape and daisies. There's no smell of alcohol, which is great.  Tastes wonderful! Grapes upfront, plums in the middle moving into grain and a fantastic fruity zip at the end. This is so smooth I cannot believe that it's 9 percent ABV. Complex and fantastic.

First sip brings a floral and spicy onslaught with hints of cinammon and cloves. There's a nice candy sugar sweetness with some fruitiness and a tasty yeast profile. Almost champagne like with the carbonation and body. A tasty brew..but I was expecting a bit more.  Mouthfeel is fairly light with a hefty amount of carbonation.

I found the smell to be a disappointment. There's some bread made with dark fruits back there, but you really gotta reach/sniff for it.  Tastes much bolder than it smells. Fruity with a decent malt backbone, quick notes of sugar and spices with a mellow hop finish. No alcohol detected.  Has a mouthfeel that is perfect for what I prefer in this style: Full but not sticky like an Impy Stout. The abv and price (I paid $7+ for an 11.2oz!!) hurt this one on drinkability.

The alcohol is incredibly well hidden, and the beer is balanced very well. The mouthfeel is way too thin, and isn't satisfying.  Drinkability and Overall: A classic ale that may be a bit overrated.

A bit more bitter and a a lot less complex than I was expecting as well; much less sweet than other trappist ales I've had, which can be good or bad depending on your mood.the lack of cloying sweetness is appreciated. Perhaps burned or almost burned caramel is a fair comparison as far as flavor goes. The alcohol is too noticeable in my opinion and the mouthfeel is pretty flat.

Nose is quite strong and fruity but seems less than spectacular I must admit. I was initially a bit let down upon first taste, it seemed quite smooth and rich but a tad one dimensional. As I sipped further though the intricacies and subtleties started to become apparent. There is a nice woody character to the brew with strong fruit tones that are difficult to differentiate from each other. Overall quite smooth and a pleasure to sip but it lacks any certain ""wow"" factor, so I would say it's rather understated in character. It's a bit thin yet refreshing thereby making it rather easy to drink and the ABV isn't noticable at all, it just adds a nice and cozy warming factor.

Aroma of roasted malt, butterscotch, sweet corn on the cob, citrus notes, chocolates, caramel, raisins. As the brew warms, more and more of these hints show themselves. First taste brings roasted malts and stewed fruit. A little sense of Sarsaparilla follows, with a mildly bitter herbal flash at the end. The center is juicy but not overly sweet. One is left with a slightly bitter, very satisfying malt lingering on the tongue. It's not as full-bodied as the appearance would have you believe, but very smooth and silky.

Small was nice, slightly floral with a crispness to it that was matched with the taste.  Taste was indicative of its 9% ABV but not over powering. Well balanced flavors. Very malty and crisp as well. Strong carbonation, but easy to drink and smooth to the finish. Alcohol kicks in, but does not detract from the other flavors.  Rather thin on the palate and quite carbonated.

215,2512,Cwrw,4.5,"Looking at my reviewed beers, I was surprised to find that I had not reviewed Chimay Blue yet, as it is probably the Belgian I drink most regularly. When I get a bottle, I just want to sit down and enjoy it with friends, not sit in front of a computer and rate it; and I suppose that is just the type of beer this is: a sociable, delicious and truly enjoyable drink.  The simple but attractive blue-labelled Chimay bottle with a best before of 2008 on the back right corner poured a dark chestnut liquid into my chalice, topped with a head befitting for a Trappist. A dark beer, untransparent, dense and full looking. Held to the light the red becomes apparent, as does the caramel-tinged edges. Against a purely white background though, this beer is dark rosewood or chestnut. A very light brown head, dark cream coloured. At first it was a good mixture of medium and small sized bubbles; after a few sips, the head formed up and became dense and solid, though not exceptionally large. From above, this beer could pass for the top of a moccha coffee. Swirling the glass creates a lighter-coloured swirl, like a hurricane seen from the top. Fine screen lacing that fragments quickly. The nose is all fruits and malt at first. I get some green apple peel, figs, prunes, red grapes(red wine for that matter), and raisins. The malt translates as light caramel, fresh yeast, extremely sweet chocolate, but NOT the same chocolate character as in some stouts. The mustiness of the yeast is also present, but only behind the sweet malt and yeasty esters. As in all complex beers, there are some aromas that seem to defy identification. Little hop presence in aroma, or taste. The taste is sweet, but less so than the aroma may have led you to expect. Instead, the alcohol is quite noticeable, gently abrasive to the tongue. Grapes and malty sugar at first on the tongue, the phenols in the middle, and some metallic maltiness in the aftertaste, also leaving some unexpected bitterness, but it does not taste like hop dryness--this is more metallic in nature, like iron or some wines. Indeed, the finish is slightly bitter in a red-wine manner, leaving a red wine taste on the palate quite strongly. A medium carbonation, perfect for the style, sufficiently creamy but tingling in the mouth; and for a strongly flavoured Trappist, the drinkability is magnificent. This pairs agreeably with aged cheddar, or even medium cheddar. This is a Trappist that needs to be tasted repeatedly, as all the nuances can simply not be detected on the first try. In addition, different food pairings can make this beer exciting and different almost perpetually.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,RenoZymurgist,4.25,"Had a 2000 magnum taking up space in my cellar so I decided that 5 years aging was probably enough. Poured a dark, reddish that is very clear and a white two inch fluffy head that subsided to a thin ring. Aroma was dry with a nice mineral character mingling with dark fruity esters. The flavor is very smooth and clean with more of the malt flavor dominating than in a fresh example. Rich dark fruit flavors interplay with a subdued dry malt flavor that is more balanced in the aged version. As this bottle aged I believe that it attenuated a bit more which resulted in an overall cleaner impression of the flavor. CO2 levels are high but the beer still remains smooth with no carbonic bite. Overall a very enjoyable ale that having been aged takes on a smoother more drinkable nature while also gaining a touch of oxidation which imparts a subtle raisin flavor. The flavor seems more round than a in a fresh example and having had this one I would recommend that all chimays of adequate strength be aged for at least a year.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

It was not as complex as other Trappist ales, but was quite satisfying in its own way. Full bodied and sticky, with a lingering spicy dry aftertaste, and just a touch of grassy hops.

215,2512,neonbrown82,4.33,"The beer pours an initial golden pilsner color and darkens into a darker color as the liquid fills. The head is slightly off white, about an inch thick, and sounds louder than a bowl of rice krispees. The head very slowly recedes to a half inch and stays throughout the glass.  Both the smell and taste were somewhat yeasty, the taste moreso than the smell. The smell, aside from the potency of the yeast, was delicious. Smells kind of orangey and malty. The taste was very good too, but quite yeasty (not overbearingly so).  I might consider buying another to see if perhaps this bottle was skunked somehow, but other than that, if I spend large amounts of money on imported beer, I will stick with the Rochefort 8's and ABT 12's. Perhaps the red will be less yeasty, in which case I will definately have to try another in case of flaw.  edit: I finally gave this beer a second try last night after sitting on the 750ml bottle for quite some time. I noticed that the spiciness I didn't like about it before was much more mellow after the beer warmed. Last time I had it out of one of the small bottles, so it didn't have a chance to warm to room temp like this bigger bottle did. Once it reached room temperature, this was actually quite delicious even with the subdued clove flavor.

Drinkability: The 9% ABV is a plus, as I like a little kick to my beers, but lends the drinkability an average rating.  Overall, I'm obviously dissapointed, and kinda pissed off. I mean, some Belgians I've had have been superb, and some have been not to my liking at all. I read reviews and it's hard to tell because everyone has different tastes. When I originally started drinking more hoppy beers, I didn't really like them much, but now I adore them. However, I really don't think this is a taste I will become accustomed to. Spices/cloves are something that I think should have their place in food, not in my beer.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Light to medium bodied. Nice carbonation. The taste mirrors the smell with the oak barrel aged flavor.This brew didn't age as well as I'd expected. Still not bad, though.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,bashiba,4.35,"What a great beer used to kick off my New Years Eve!  Poured a hazy caramel colored brown with a several inches of thick creamy head that seemed to last forever.  Smelled strongly of sweet malts with flavors of toffee, dates, and some earthy spices.  Taste is great. A nice mixture of date, toffee, plum, raison and other dark fruit flavors with a sublte hint of wood with a very nice mild earthy hop finish - very balanced and good.  Mouthfeel is full and creamy with a nice warming and a heavy carbonation feeling - great!  Drinkablity is Very good, especially for a beer this big. Finished a 750ml and would easily start in on another if I had one with me. Great Beer!",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,mgdeth,3.99,"Appearance - Dark amber or light brown in color (it is about the colors of raisins). The head recedes quickly. Yeast from the bottle made its way into the glass.  Smell - Rich raisin/plum/prune and malty smells dominates the aroma profile. No hops are present.  Taste - The taste is a blend of malty sweetness, raisin/plum/prune, and spice. Alcohol taste is clearly present, and hops are not present at all. Pretty good.  Mouthfeel - This beer is really thick, so its name is well deserved. Anything thinner just would not seem right.  Drinkability - The alcoholic flavor is not particularly to my liking, as it makes the beer a tad rough. Otherwise the taste is good, so this tends to make the beer desirable.  Comments - This beer is definitely worth a try. This is not one of my preferred styles.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

I can remember the first time I had the Grand Reserve and always look for an excuse to indulge in the next.  The color is primarily dark walnut but a little on the ruby red side. The head is white, bubbly , and sturdy as it leaves traces of it's sticky residue on the sides of my Chimay chalice.  The complexity of the smell and flavor is overwhelming. Floral, fruity, yeasty, esthery, wine like, malty, and sweet, with hints of ginger bread, cinnamon, and clove. The moutfeel is creamey, smooth, and inviting.

Pours a dark reddish brown with an excellent head. Very nice lacing on the glass. This is definately one that should be enjoyed from the suggested glass. It helps to enhance both the aroma and taste. The slightly sweet taste helps to mask the high alcohol content. The overall drinkability is very smooth with great mouthfeel.

215,2512,Paddez,4.75,"Pours a murky brown brew with a decent-sized, dense, tan head. The smell is fruity, complex and rather sweet with raisins, bread and some earthiness. The taste is deep, dark and complex: plummy fruits, grapes, wood, bread and some notes of alcohol and malts near the end. The mouthfeel is very nice, the beer is smooth, well carbonated and although the alcohol is traceable it's well hidden. Very drinkable too considering the high ABV and complexness of this beer.  Overall, this is an incredibly solid beer that I often go back to, one of the best trappist brews there is in my opinion. My favourite in this style.

On the way home, a lady proclaimed me to be a sinner, citing my beer as evidence, and demanded that I not stand near her. I explained to her that I was disinclined to acquiesce to her request, so she mumbled and made creepy hand gestures in my direction for the rest of the trip.  After a mini-adventure like that, how could I not enjoy this beer?  Appearance: Very dark brown with a big foamy off-white head. And loud. It sounded like the head was full of a certain snappy, crackly and poppy cereal.  Smell: Surprisingly little smell for a beer of this style. A hint of dark fruits, perhaps, but that's about it.  Taste: Yummy. Dark fruits, hops, caramel. Nice, big mouthfeel.  This is a fine beer. Hopefully there will still be some left next time I go.

So I went out and got some. 750ml corked bottle. Pours a transparent brown color, not too dark, nice and smooth looking with a huge tan head full of swiss cheese like holes. Smell is very inviting, very rich. Smells of sweet toasted malts and spiced fruits, perhaps a little dark rum thrown in, with a dash of mustiness. Taste is fabulous. Lots of flavors, lots of complexities. Very bready, but not like your standard loaf. More like pumpkin bread or banana bread or something else sweet like that. A tad woodsy too, with Belgian spices and a touch of bitter hops. Medium bodied but very smooth tasting, not light but not too heavy, despite the brown color. I would drink this beer all the time if it didn't cost as much.

Pours very dark, an almost opaque brown with amber highlights. Very rich head of monstrous proportions that left a residual eggshell lacing.  Smell: A very subtle, poignant smell of creamy smoke and fire followed by a dusty woodiness.  Taste: Lovely hops are noticeable at first, followed by the warm, musky tang of over-ripened fruits. There seems to be layer upon layer of unique tastes here that beg to be explored!  Mouthfeel: A good amount of carbonation is the perfect contrast to the pleasant warmth of the 9% alcohol content.  Drinkability: This is the most perfect beer that I've ever had...and probably the closest to perfect that I'll have for quite some time. An unfailing choice, really.

Nice hazy brown with a decent head that lightly stuck to the glass and left a nice amount of lacing on the surface all the way down.  Smell was of dark, ripe fruit with a nice malty backbone and a bit of the 9% abv.  Taste was good. I was expecting something a bit stronger but the sweetness and fruit were balanced nicely. Reminded me a bit of Trois Pistoles.  Mouth was smooth and rich. Left a bit sour but not dry, good carbonation takes care of the finish.  Overall a good choice to be had.

215,2512,CarolinaCardinals,4.5,"Original Review 12-12-2004. Picked up an 11.2 oz bottle at Papago Brewing for $3.50 back in September.  This is a ruby brown ale that poured a 4 finger head that is leaving a bit of residue. It is cloudy with plenty of yeast sediment-4.5. Nose is of spicy Belgian yeast-4.0. Taste is of dark fruity malt to start fading into a smooth slightly detectable alcohol finish-4.5. Mouthfeel is good, lively but not overly carbonated-4.0. Overall drinkability is good-4.0 . This is a very well put together brew. The high ABV and cost will limit me to 1 sampling but two samples are very doable! (Overall Average 4.23)  Had a couple of snifters of draft on 8-6-19 from the Glendale Westgate Yardhouse for the happy hour price of $7.50.  Beer poured a burgundy with a beautiful white head that had some great hang time-4.5 Nose was perfumed with esters of plums, figs, and currants-4.5. Taste was awesome, very wine like. Figs and currants dominated with a touch of nutmeg. Each sip was delightful!-4.5. Mouthfeel was light bodied and extremely smooth -4.5. Overall a wonderful wonderful beer. I forgot how good this is...maybe the draft version is better. Plan on tracking down bottles in the near future!-4.5.  1-19-2020 Bought a 4 pack back in August from TW Arrowhead for $23.

The head never faded away completely and the drink leaves some lacing as it goes.  Has a black pepper and cherry type smell. A little bit of alcohol apparant in the aroma.  Taste is sweet up front with a spicy alcohol finish. Dark fruits to begin and pepper at the end.  Mouthfeel is good, full bodied enough and not over carbonated.

The aroma is of dried dark fruits dusted in cocoa powder, fresh plums and caramel malts. The taste is malty with a clear dark candy sugar flavor. Theres and chocolate and all spice flavors, maybe some cloves as well. Hoppiness is very minimal and the alcohol is subdued for the lofty ABV.

215,2512,gentlebubbles,2.09,"750 ml bottle. Bottle-conditioned. No sign whatsoever of a vintage date. Perhaps the code LAM - 088 on the back means something?  Despite the enticing pop of the cork, only a reluctant tan haze briefly passes for a head. The beer itself is a deep chestnut with an amber glow at the bottom and a hint of ruby at the brim.  Strong unpleasant yeasty smell, like a starter of baking yeast. As it warms the alcohol comes out in powerful winey port with overtones of raisins.  Hardly any flavor to fight off the alcohol, just a bit of sweetness up front more like maple syrup than malt. Thin and fizzy and that yeast taste pops up again in the finish.  Supposedly it benefits from aging. It could only get better.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,BuckeyeNation,3.83,"Tobacco leaf brown with an infusion of orange. The beer contains a great deal of yeast and a wealth of vigorous carbonation rushing up to an expansive, ecru colored head. The foam is so soft and pillowy that I'd be surprised if much lace actually sticks to the chalice. There's very little as it turns out.  The nose smells overwhelmingly of clove. There's an undercurrent of musky, dark fruit that doesn't really have a chance to shine due to the olfactory spiciness. Blue's mouthfeel is lighter than expected; a sensation that is heightened by a generous amount of hyperactive carbonation. If I can get past the physical sensation of the beer in the mouth, this is a pretty tasty BSDA, although I've had better.  The flavor profile consists of sweet dark fruit (currants and dates) that has been soaked in a mixture of dark rum and molasses. It isn't overly sweet beer, but there is a light viscousness underlying the otherwise airy, active mouthfeel. Alcohol isn't masked all that well; not a deal breaker by any means. Whereas clove spice dominated the nose, it's much more subdued on the palate.  Grande Reserve is my favorite of the three Chimay beers (as I was pretty sure it would be), but I can't help feel that it doesn't quite deserve its reputation. The best thing about it is that it's pretty widely available. There are quite a few BSDAs, however, that I like a whole lot more.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,connecticutpoet,4.35,"This was a cloudy brown ale with a good-sized foamy tan head.  The aroma was of medium to dark malts, overlaid with slightly floral aromatic hops.  The flavor was of rich, slightly musty malt. There were traces of oak and toffee. There was also a lovely warm afterglow, which seems to be a hallmark of Chimay ales.

The aroma was a little more subtle than I expected. The aromatics I did pick up were mostly slight hints of grainy maltiness and a little bit of raisin and fruit. The flavor was dominated by a complex maltiness, with a hint of caramel and some slight fruitiness and an alcoholic warmth. Some hop bitterness was present to balance but overall this was a malty beer. Some herbaly, wood-like notes at the end of the tasting add a nice touch.

The belgian yeast spiciness was prominent and a slight bready/biscuit flavor was hiding in there somewhere. A definite alcohol warming was present and a caramel impression accompanied it.

Yeast funk, spice, red apple and plum; sweet and a bit sugary overall with a slight hint of rum alcohol.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Again, it's correct, adaquate, but not particularly compelling. There's yeast, spice, earth, perhaps a bit of tobacco, and a caramel apple fruitiness. It's surprisingly citrus/hoppy bitter at the finish. Also a surprise is its thin body, although there's a pleasant creaminess. Carbonation peeks in at the finish.  Drinkability: It's a nice enough beer, and lighter than its 9% ABV might suggest.  I'm not overwhelmed by this beer, which is surprising, because I'd always counted it among my favorites before I tasted it objectively. I should note that this bottle was fairly fresh and the less desirable 11.2 size.  I'll come back to this one, no doubt.

If I didn't know better i'd think I was looking at a glass of bourbon. The off-white head dissolves quickly but leave a few bubbles around the edges resembling a glass of Pepsi or Coke. The scent is apples, pears, grapes and cinnamon and the flavor is the same with caramel and a great malty taste. The mouthful is tinglingly perfect. Light but not thin.

215,2512,heidelbeerg,4.2,This is a great beer. Better than the red label Chimay. Poured a nice deep mahogany color with a good creamy head. It is loaded with flavor and very balanced. A very delicious bready/yeasty malt flavor with a just barely discernable hop character. This is a great brew. The 9.00% ABV is hardly noticeable making it very dangerous because it tastes so good.,Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,SilentSabre,4.35,"I've heard from alot of folks that Chimay is over-rated. I'm afraid I'm going to have to dis-agree. While not absolutely staggering, earth-shattering good, it's a very fine brew indeed, worthy of the reputation that it holds. Regretably, however, I have a little bit of a stopped up nose at the moment. As such, my sense of smell and taste are a little bit impaired. Even still, I can easily smell the yeast and spice, so typical of this style, emanting from my glass. Quite strong. A dark ruby, murky rust colour, this stuff had a nice three-quarter inch slightly off-white head on it when I poured it. Now it has subsided to little more than a frosty haze over the surface. Excellent thick, sticky lacing coats the sides of my glass, and the smell of yeast and spices is only amplified when you take a drink. The mouth feel is quite smooth and easy to drink, inspite of the carbonation level being a little bit higher than I would have anticipated. The fact that this is a 9.0%abv is well disguised. It does have a little bit of a warming sensation as it goes down, but not even close to being unpleasant or overpowering. This is my first ""baptising"" with Chimay, and now I'm even more excited about having the white and red label ones. Certainly I will have this again. Very Impressed.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,stangbat,4.12,"I found this for $8.99 a bottle when visiting my mom. Cork is dated 11/03. This is my first experience with a true Belgium ale and I'm not disappointed.  Pours a dark golden brown with minimal to no lacing. A distinct toasty aroma, very nice. Has a nice full mouthfeel, seemingly due to the high carbonation and/or alcohol. A nice toasty taste, however I can't really detect the fruity flavors others mention. I don't notice any outstanding hop flavor or bitterness, hence a nice balance and no real aftertaste.  I think I'll definitely pick up one of these every so often when I'm in Lawrence.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,Rio,4.28,"11,20 oz bottle. Poured dark, almost a dark mahogany color, with a towering head. the head has receeded fairly quickly, but it hangs around. Kind of a stale sweetness to the smell, perhaps a bit of a fruity tone in the background.  The grape juice taste noted in the Chimay Red and White isn't so prevalent here, more of an afterthought, but it does remain. More of a sweeter fruit comes to the forefront of this one. A tiny bit of a metallic after-taste/feel follows up this beer, that has a bit of a dryness to it on the tongue, and a feeling of bubbles popping on the back of the tongue as the brew is washed down.  A very fine brew. Very tasty, without any tastes that are too over the top. Pretty smooth and subtle, I think, but impressive none the less.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,zjungleist,4.57,"One of my favorites. Rich, malty/yeasty smell and taste to start, turning hoppy and floral as it breathes.  I tried it with Chimay cheese for the first time tonite... which was an experience to be sure. Amazingly well paired, highly recomended. Definintely brings out the brown sugary sweetness in the beer, and takes the top off of the floral bite.  A bit on the pricey side though, not an every day beer.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,kosmoraios,4.75,"This ale is a special treat for me. Served in a 7.5dL corked/caged bottle and poured into a Duvel tulip glass with exquisite care. The appearance is fascinating, a darkly tan amber color that refracts the light into reddish hues. The head is thick and tenacious. The aroma is heaven - darkly sweet bread with raisins, plums and perhaps a hint of mango laced with molasses or brown sugar. The yeast is evident also, moreso as this delectable nectar warms to nearer room temperature. Taste is exquisite. The perfectly-balanced hops compliment the slight yeast flavor as the sweet dark fruit courses through your palate. The head traps the volitiles and lasts for the length of the glass. The taste becomes more and more complex as the ale warms. The mouthfeel is crisp and peppery for such a dark ale, in part due to the perfect carbonation. This beer is very drinkable because of the excellent taste, but you'd be inebriated after the second one.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,BJ1833,4.32,"Date on cork was 03/03. Pours a deep brown/copper color with a three finger head. The smell is malty with strong fruit and spice aromas. This beer is highly carbonated, but not overcarbonated. The first taste brings out a strong spice flavor followed by an overripe fruit flavor. A slight orange peel flavor is present in the finish. A medium body beer with a very faint copper-like, metallic finish.  Overall, I like this beer the most of the Chimay brews. A great beer and very good example of an authentic belgian beer.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,TagoMago,4.4,"Presentation: 750 ml. corked bottled poured into trappist goblet.  Appearance: Creamy dark brown with a slight red hue. Pours with a very vibrant and lasting head. A decent lacing is present.  Smell: Malty sweetness combined with a fairly strong alcoholic presence. Some esthery grape-like elements are also noticed, combined with a musty, yeasty character.  Taste: Intense carbonation with a full-bodied smoothness. This is very sherry-like in quality. Malts combine with fruits (grape, plum) and alcohol. A very musty Belgian yeast flavor is present. Belgian candi sugar is present in the flavor as well, providing much of the beer's sweetness.  Overall: Simply put, this is one of the best Belgian ales - let alone one of the best beers - in the world. It is every bit worth the $10 for a 750 ml. bottle. It's almost flawless in every way - a real treat. Highly recommended!",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,Dukeofearl,4.28,"33 cl bottle. Pours a murky dark brown, with a lack of ruby/red/purple notes that I have seen in other similar brews. Has a very nice looking tan head (1"") that has a slight (very slight) brown-red tint to it. Overall looks very rich and inviting. A pleasure to behold. Aroma- bready, dark fruits (plums, cherries, prunes). Yeast is subtle, with a slightly off-smelling component. Really hard to pin it down, but there is something organic that is slightly unpleasant. Overall aroma is good, but there is one component hidden that isn't right. Flavor- very rich, complex, more than I can describe. I like this stuff! Slight alcohol presence (much more subtle than some I have had, which I think is a good thing). Sweetbread, port, with a sharpness from alcohol and hops overlying it. Nicely balanced. Mouthfeel rich and chewy.  Overall, I really like this nectar of the gods- my favorite Chimay (now that I've tried them all). This did not give me the wow factor of something like the Rochefort 10, but still very good.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,nomad,3.45,"2002 vintage  This is one of a handful of beers (mostly Belgian) that stole my interest away from wine. A wonderful introdcution to the complexities of beer, and easy to find, I've never put down my growing sense of this product. Many bottles later, I decide to use a bottle that I aged for two years as review fodder. Lovers of Chimay Blue say two years is a great point...  Pours a murky brown with a light notion of amber, but lacking the clarity of some dubbels. Carbonation is quite fizzy building a foamy head that dies away quickly. Left behind is a lump of bubbles in the middle of the surface from the carbonation stream living off the small flat circle of the chalice's bottom. Lacing is eventually strong and dripping all over, but cannot counter the lackluster color and fizzy head.  Smell is a cheap version of prunes, dark malts, toffee, and spices. Yet, these spices are neither distinct nor appealing. In time, all of the above weave into a vinuous character that is what you might call the backbone of the beer's scent.  Amazing how as your palate grows, and as you enoy much superior dark Belgian beers the night before, Chimay Blue can be so unimpressive. Woody with bare grape flavors accompanied by tannin-like dryness, the malts are as thin as the mouthfeel. The carbonation is terrible, as fizzy, sharp, and flavor-destroying as a warm soda can be. I guess I'd say there are some fruity flavors and sweet-ish malts in the mix, but this beer pales in comparison to recent experience with Gouden Carolus, St. Bernardus 12, and even Old Jubilation as better dark Belgian-like brews.  Years later, this beer is passable. Dare I say its a beginner's beer? That is pretty much what it is for me.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,Dmann,4.72,"This is an amazing brew that I have held of on trying for far too long! This one poured a dark brown color with a very bubbely white head that settled on top of the beer. The smell was of bananna and spice and a subtle hint of mustyness as well. The taste was so fucking good with its perfect blend of bananna, clove spices and a touch of pepper flavor in the finnish. Hops are next to nothing in here but there is much flavor to this beer regardless. My bottle was dated 07/03 so after being aged a year, I'd say it tastes pretty damn good! Try this one if you have not allready and rediscover it if you have not had it in awhile!",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,Gagnonsux,2.79,"Bought this in a 3-pack which included one of each Chimay variety plus a glass for around $11.00. Yesterday, I tried their Tripel and didn't really like it. I like this Blue better than the Tripel, but I can definently tell Belgian ales aren't my thing. Appearance is really dark, not quite coffee colored, but close. Head is moderate height, but quite creamy. The head never quite goes away and leaves a thin layer on top of the beer. Smell is of spices, slight apple smell. Taste is mainly of spices, reminds me of something I'd have around Christmas. Smoother than the tripel I had yesterday, but similiar. 9% alcohol is barely tasted, but noted by a warming of my stomach. Overall, I now know this isn't a style of beer for me, so I probably won't get it again.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,faernt,4.55,"I've been cellaring Grand Reserve for about eight years now. I try to save it for at least five years before I open one. I think Michael Jackson said it starts to take on a ""sherry-like"" qualities after then. So, in honor of that concept, I decided to drink a relatively fresh 750 to appreciate the change. I also plan on revisiting this review with my findings on subsequent years. The one I'm drinking now has a cork date of 10.03.  It pours with a whopper of a head. It's two inches tall in this chalice. I have a 12 oz chalice and this 750 is going to fill it three times. ( Is 750 a beer geek equivalent of a 40?). The bubbles are small and the head slowly subsides into a thin layer that has little foam islands floating in it. It's a foamy archipelago in there. The beer is the color of figs.  The smell is Chimay....(I've been drinking this for years)...it's a little spicy and I can't separate the spices to say what they are. I'll have to read the reviews of other, more nasal sensitive BAs. Not being able to pull it apart is fine with me. Mystery brings me back for another try.  The taste is bitter and sweet and spicy with the mouthfeel not being as heavy as I expect from a beer like this. I move the glass and the foam returns. One other thing about bottle-conditioned 750s is the way they change if you work with the yeast. The first pour is clear. The second pour has a little yeast disturbance. The third is the big yeast hit. Each of the three glasses of the same beer from the same bottle is different. I like that.Chimay yeast is spicy.  This is why it's so drinkable. Change is good. I will amend this review with future tastings.  02.11.05  Ok, I'm drinking a bottle with a cork date of 02.99 today. It's Friday and I've had a dense week. It's time to relax with a reward for getting through. I choose the Grand Reserve.  It opens with an optimistic pop. The white smoke of a good beer swirls sinuously out of the top of the bottle. I look at the cork to check the date of 02.99 and it's there. I have to peek at the corks when they are in the bottle and sometimes I can see the date and often I can't.  Earlier, I'd pulled it out of its resting place. It was kept in a horizontal position since '99 when I bought it. I put it in the refrigerator very carefully to avoid an explosion and overflow. It worked.  It tastes musty and that's good. The body is medium heavy and the head is varied from pour to pour. It starts as a one inch head. The second pour has a two inch head. What a taste. I don't get this idiosyncratic taste out of beer that has been freshly put into a 750. Is this cork or what? It is good. I will have to pin down this aspect of taste. It's great.  02.16.08  I've just opened a bottle with a cork dated 11.99. It pops and smokes, but doesn't overflow. The pour nets a decent head with bubbles that are slightly large and small. The smell is musty and the taste is seriously cork. The bottom of the cork that was inside with the beer is bumpy and irregular. It looks like taste buds.  The head subsides and the cork taste remains. It's almost too much. The sweetness makes it through with the cork. It still tastes like Blue but the cork is coming on strong. I'd drink this before now if I had a choice. It's still good, but the preoccupation is cork. It's a bit out of balance with the cork override. The beer is great otherwise.  03.01.08  This bottle is 05.01  It opened well with a serious pop and the happy swirlly white fog. No overflow happened. It poured well. I'm drinking it with a thin wedge of Stilton which is working well. The taste is not as dominantly corky as the last bottle I had. This actually has a medium body and a very balanced taste. It's not too sweet, but yet, a little sweet. I still taste hops. This beer is nearly seven years old and it's very lively.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,tjd25,4.32,"The head is very dense and silky; the way it fades into a thin collar is incredibly smooth. The beer pours an opaque dark brown color with some notes of orange and purple. The smell is nicely yeasty with toasted dark malts and a light banana aroma; some hints of cream and butter too. The taste shows some fruity aspects, bananas and apples, but is mostly yeasty, with a very round and full maltiness that gives the beer a very nice bready aspect. Like cereal bread, partly melting in the mouth. A very warming alcohol feeling circles the mouth, and maybe some light nots of citrus. A very good beer, although there are some better examples of the style.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,FormatKid,4.5,"Picked up a stubby 330ml bottle from Bacchus in Chattanooga. Pours out a lovely vision into my trusty goblet. A nice deep shade of translucent brown, like weak coffee. A rich creamy head overflows the goblet without breaking and spilling over the side. Teeny-tiny carbonation bubbles are apparent on inspection, but you have to look for them.  The smell is highly evident of that delicate, musty yeast. A spicy-alcohol aroma also tickles my nostrils. Rich malty smell is apparent as well as a mixture of fruits, grapes with an over-ripe tone is what strikes me the most. This all blends into an overall earthy yet dainty and delicate aroma.  The taste is excellent first of all, just the overall flow of it before I attempt to break it down into its components. Big musty presence throughoutlovely. Very sweet and malty up front, this leads into the fruity part of the flavor. Plums and dried figs are apparent in the middle as well as residues of candy sugar. Tight and tart with vinous alcohol flavors at the end, this shares the finish with a delicate ballet of spicy European hops. The mouthfeel is creamy and really gives all those flavors a chance to hang out and be known.  Once again, I have no complaints about any of the beers I have tried from Chimay. This beer is delicate and still rich. The complexities of the beer take you on a beautiful voyage from sweet to musty to tangy to spicy.

215,2512,UnionMade,4.02,"Served in a Chimay glass, out of a cute little 12oz stubby bottle. The beer pours a deep red, suspended flecks of yeast creating a dusty haze. The bottle hadn't been disturbed since i got it, and I poured as to not disturb the sediment. A thick crop of ivory foam forms on the pour, very even bubbled, settling quickly into a large, thick island bordered by a thin collar. A plume of carbonation bubbles vigorously feeds the head. The head actually seems to grow as I drink, a solid, 1/8"" coating about halfway through. Rather impressive. Some speckled lace. The aroma is thick with molten caramel sweetness. Lots of candi sugar, with huge amounts of fruity esters. Hints of apple, pineapple, melon, banana and mango. A slight alcoholic tinge, with a faint yeasty mustiness. Phenolic clove and some plastic-like scent. Very strong, but with a gentle touch. The flavor starts incredibly sweet. Rather saccharine, chunks of candi sugar smothered in blonde caramel. A bushel of assorted fruit is added as it starts to simmer, adding hints of banana, melon and plum, along with lighter notes of sweet strawberry and apple. The sweetness continues into the finish, a mild phenolic flavor creeping in, adding some spiciness. Rather clove-y, with a bit of plastic band-aid, the kind that pulls off the hair on your arm when you try to peel it off. Perhaps a dash of herbal hops, but it's mostly suffocated by the sweetness. Vague peppery flavor right in end, with a bit of softening, slightly musty yeast deadening the alcohol. It's almost undetectable, save a light burn on the back of the throat. The aftertaste features moderate clove and a lingering candi sweetness. Very fizzy, active carbonation, like drinking a bottle of warm soda, with much finer bubbles. On the medium end of full bodied, with a soft, gentle mouthfeel. Very nice stuff, perhaps a bit too sweet for me. Not quite cloying, but almost there. I liked it much better than the tripel, but the carbonation was definitely a surprise. I like a bouyant, assertive carbonation in belgian ale, but not quite this much. The mouthfeel is still very smooth, which helps. My girlfriend thinks it's ""pretty good"". Certainly recommended by myself.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,Hunter,4.97,"2nd Chimay in as many days for me. Cinq Cents is my personal favorite, so I'll save that one for last. Grande Reserve is supposedly Chimay's ""big brew"", the one the monks themselves brew and drink infrequently. Whether that's true, or the stores here believe the hype, this is the most expensive of the three, at $9 for the large. At those prices I could be drinking at a pub! But these beers are worth it. As I said in my Red review, DON'T buy the smaller bottles - something's lost in translation. Chimay's website almost admits as much when it mentions that their beers take on special characteristics when the secondary fermentation after bottling is allowed to work in larger volumes.  The Blue cap pours a dark garnet color, with a long-lasting head the color of beach sand. the head easily regenerates itself with some gentle agitation. Some bits of yeast and sediment will find their way into your glass with all but the most careful pours, but it's really a minor complaint. Nice, steady carbonation in thin threads from the bottom of the chalice.  The aroma is at once more complex, and more muted than the Red. What's hiding in there? Clove, candied fruit, and...mystery. There is a light slap of alcohol (and at 9% it would be unavoidable) but it's more of an inticement than anything else.  The first thing to hit the tongue is a crisp wine-like essense, carried on a silken mouthfeel. If autumn had a taste, it would be this. Dark, earthy spice, oak, berries, and plum. Reminds me of a November sunset, bracing with the promise of frost. (The alcohol must be taking over - I'm rhapsodizing here ;))  Too hard to judge after only one, as it shows you something new each time. This beer is like a beautiful woman - she won't give up her secrets readily. I love this beer, and it's only due to the prohibitive cost that it's not a daily thing for me.

After it settled down, a nice 11/2 inch thick, tan foamy head remained. Tasting the beer through the thick foam was a delight. The first taste was very impressive. For 9% abv, I expected a stronger alcohol taste, but it was suppressed very well.  This is a fabulous beer, one that I will buy many times.

In the begining it seems rather yeasty or maybe nutmeg it then turns to a spice and finishes with a slight hint of grapes of some sort of fruit. The taste was very pleasing and very smooth. It starts with a sweet flavor of malt. Then you taste some spice or pepper like flavor in it mixed with a dry feeling that coats your mouth and tingles from the alcohol. As I got to the last 3-4 sips from the chalice it almost seemed like there was a different smell, maybe from the warming of the beer, that seemed to me was like rose pedals or some sort of flower.

A brief head ends up with only a few stray bubbles around the edge. Unique look for a brew.  Aroma - spicy yeast, some light fruit sweetness at first, then everything kind of dissipates. After a few moments any smell is completely gone. Bummer.  Taste - light malt, lots of bready, yeasty taste, a bit of sweetness, and plenty of alcohol. The active carbonation gives it a sweet/salty blend. A vinous swallow, like a medium red wine. Finishes with a bite, a little background hop grapefruitiness, and alcohol warmth in the back of the throat. Not as impressive as I anticipated, but some decent dimensions and tasty.  Mouthfeel - bubbly, of course, somewhat dry, but leaves a thin coating. Well done for this style.  Drinkability - I don't remember what I paid for this some 2 years ago, but to look at it as many times as I did before finally opening it, I gotta say I had higher expectations.

This is another beer that can have it's young 2 dimensional character changed slightly by cellaring for a year or more but it would never get to be that old in my cellar ;-)  Poured a dark slightly clouded amber with a smallish off white cap. Aromas of dates or figs or dried apricots. Started with a surprising big mouthful of sweet bready malts before the expected complex/layered banana-fig-hop undertones took over. As the beer sits on the palate the hop accent builds until the finish is surprisingly drying.  A very delightful strong ale but every time I've tasted it fresh and it has appeared slightly different each time.

The beer itself looked great in glass, and smelt pretty good, i could taste everything that was there (i think). I was suprised to find i couldn't really taste the alcohol much in it.

215,2512,Globetrotter,4.01,"Wandering down the streets of Kazan, Tatarstan, some 600 miles east of Moscow, I decided to stick my head into the local supermarket just to see what they have. Sure, good selection of local and national brands, then I turn around and find a BA Top 50 beer staring me in the face. Naturally, I buy it. Brown 750ml wine bottle with cork and cage, plain blue and white label. Vintage 2003. Sugar is an ingredient. Best before 2008, I popped it on 4/30/04.  Very attractive pour - cloudy deep brown with a hint of burgundy under a 2.5 finger that showed some nice contour at first but settled to smooth creaminess a bit too quickly. I see only spots of lace on the glass. The nose is not as strong as I would like. What's there is fruity with yeast undertones and just a nip of hops astringency. The mouth is champagne prickly and fairly light - I had hoped for more body. The taste is nice, mild cranberry and cherry, with some definite fruity yeast flavors to open, followed by a reserved but noteworthy hoppy bite to finish. The aftertaste nicely combines the sweet fruit and the hoppy bitter in an impression that keeps dragging you back for more. Am I blown away by this beer? No. But it sure is very, very good.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Somewhat sweet, with an incredible smoothness. Yet another re-rate. This one was bottled in 01/03. I have to agree with some of the others who have noted the decline of this beer. It is still very good, but I just can't call it exceptional anymore. Some of the subtleness and complexity has left it.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Two finger, tan colored head is tightknit and leaves beautiful, Brussels lace all over the St Bernardus goblet. Nice aroma, with bananas and raisins battling a strong coriander note for supremacy. Barnyard yeastiness is also prominent. Mouthfeel is similar to most dark, and pale, Belgian ales, with a fizzy, explosion of carbonation. Taste is fruity malt, with figs and raisins in the forefront. Cloves, corainder, and rosemary provide the compliment of aggressive spiciness. Nothing conceals the alcohol here, but why worry when you're enjoying a big Trappist Belgian dark ale. Finish is very spicy, with coriander. Not my favorite Chimay, nor does it rank up there with my favorite Trappist ales.

The smell is fruity and spiecy. A little burned smell and smell of brown sugar. The taste is lovely, with some sweetness and not much bitterness. A little roasted taste of fudge.

215,2512,Trentonator,4.9,"This beer has opened my eyes to what great beer should really be like. Drinking this beer is like a religious experience (appropriately, since it is brewed by monks). Unbelievably beautiful and majestic appearance, with a thick creamy head that dissipates ever so slowly leaving an enticing lace. Constant bubbling, and an aroma that can only be described as sensuous. Tastes like nothing I have ever experienced before. Smoky, almost cognac like, it is a beer to be savored and cherished. A bit pricey ($ 12 for a 750 ml), but well worth every penny. This beer will also sneak up on you very seductively, with it's 9% ABV, and before you know it, you will be inebriated, but HAPPY.

The color of...an empty beer bottle, or a nightcrawler's back. very large, bubbly white head, that fades eventually.  smells very strong of cloves, fruit, and sweet alchohol, as in champagne.  taste of cloves dominates, with some wood, and sweet alchohol flavors. Huge clove aftertaste. I'm not a huge fan.  mouthfeel is full in texture, but light in weight. good. acceptably drinkable for a 9.0. This tastes very unique and...formal - like it would be appropriate whenever a bottle of wine would be. if i was blind folded, i would not know this was beer. an interesting beverage, but i can't say ""clove"" is one of my preferred flavors, and i don't forsee myself drinking this beer often.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

The tastes were maybe not as complex as, say something from Ommegang or Unibroue, but still a good representation. Ginger, clove, malt, leather, lemon, and caramel all swirled around on my happy tongue. The mouthfeel was light, with small, fizzy carbonation. It finished up with clove, caramel, and leather. Very tasty, indeed!",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Alcohol, fruits, light sweetness and almost raisin-like aromas come through.  Nice full body, medium carbonation. Almost red-wine like flavors. Slight alcohol notes with a light fruitiness, but not citrusy.  Slight lacing down the glass, an excellent beer.

215,2512,HardTarget,4.5,"750 ml bomber with 07/03 on the caged cork. Aroma: A wine like smell with a strong dose of yeast, pepper, alcohol and a bit of malt. Appearance: Dark brown/black with ruby edges in backlight. As the level dropped a more clearly brown color took over. Tan head that formed a short lasting largish sized bubble froth before dying down to a thin coat. Got an odd head pattern in my goblet, the very center had an active plume of carbonation, which after sips formed a distinct eye shape with a bubbling iris. Ok, it IS 9%, but that&#8217;s what it looked like. Flavor: A red wine like taste, again with the strong yeast flavor and a small dose of plum. My description isn&#8217;t adequate to describe this wonderful beer. The yeast taste is a cousin of the Unibroue line and complements the fruit tastes nicely. Mouthfeel: Perfect medium body with a slight prickle before it vanishes. Nice and dry with a silky smoothness. Overall Impression: An amazing beer. It improved as it warmed, so I suggest starting off near cellar temperatures. This has wonderful mouthfeel and a very enjoyable taste. The high alcohol rules this out for any kind of session beer, but as for drinkability, I was disappointed when the bomber was gone (and more than a little inebriated). Not a lot going on in the aroma and it&#8217;s not exactly easy on the eyes, but I&#8217;ll be stashing more of these babies away next beer hunt.

Hops come through as well and give it a warm smell.  Taste: Sweet in mouth. Flavor is strong with grassy notes. Grain comes through along with some mild bitterness in finish. Overall it's good but not as good as I would expect.  Mouthfeel: Carbonation levels are good. Coats tounge well. Overall feels really nice.  Drinkability: I was a little let down by the flavor of this. Alchohol content is high and you can taste it.

Terrific sales on Chimay at the local store so it's hard to resist, and there's really no point to trying. A year ago, I preferred the red. Now, I like this one (Blue) much better.  It pours a very dark reddish brown with a thick, tannish head. Very nice lacing throughout the drink. The aroma is malty with definite fruity undertones. The taste is exceptional even for a Trappist ale. It starts with a sweet maltiness that has real grapey undertones. The taste ends with an alcohol hit that is ameliorated by the fruitiness. One of the few beers that I rate a 5 in taste. It feels almost perfect in the mouth with some real body, nice carbonation, and a lingering taste of fruit. I rate this down a little in drinkability just because of the alcohol content.

Taste is sweet with plums and dark grapes mingled with a hint of alcohol for a nice warming effect with each sip. The mouthfeel is full is body and there is a nice crispness with each sip from the fine carbonation. Drinkability is okay, but the high ABV certainly creeps up on you quickly.

The smell was very musty and yeasty. Also quite fruity. The taste was less sweet than I expected considering some of the other strong dark ales I've sampled, but that's not disappointing in the least. Dried raisons and plums and wild musty yeast flavors filled my mouth and nose, followed by a generous amount of warming alcohol. Quite pleasing. Mouthfeel was very creamy and thick, also quite carbonated and filling. Drinkability was hampered by the richness, although I still say it's good considering I'm almost done with the 750 as I write this. An amazing offering from one of the big 6 true Trappist Abby's.

Pleasant, but not exquisite aroma-wise.  Taste: Anise twinged sweet dark malts with clove aftertastes. Not a very complex taste, but still pretty tasty.

215,2512,Foxman,4.33,"It pours an opaque milk chocolate brown. There's an explosive, hellacious off-white head, like a pillowy mousse, that comes and stays for a good long time, with just awesome retention. There's descendingly thicker, winding ribbons of rich lacing.  The aroma carries a heavy malt backbone, along with a yeasty sour note, delivering a grainy, doughy aura. There are lighter notes of clove and cinnamon, with a distant dry citrus at the end, all wrapped around an indistinct vapor of alcohol.  The flavor is malt first, and substantially so, with an earthy sweetness rounded by a mellow caramel note. The yeast lends a biscuity character, and a light, dry grapefruit note mingles with cloves to compliment and mitigate a considerable alcohol presence. The finish is a swirling melange of all the flavors, fading slowly and luxuriantly.  It's medium bodied, clinging across the tongue and mouth, making a strong name for itself. It seems to be an ideal compromise between light and heavy, coating just long enough.  It's a long-time standard, and justifiably so. The flavor and aroma are full and balanced enough to really grab and hold your attention, but not so busy as to lose its identity at any point. This is one of my wife's favorites, and it always puts a smile on her face when I bring it home. In spite of the strong ABV, it's drinkable because you just have to taste it again.

Color is a nearly opaque, deep mahogany.  A gorgeous bouquet greets my nose. Rich, hearty malt sweetness, surrounded by savory fruit -- I pick up hints of raisins, prunes, dried figs -- and there's a refreshingly earthy undertone, like a forest after a rain storm, with a tinge of yeast.  The taste opens with bright notes of the fruity, earthy malts so blatant in the nose, followed by a pronounced hop kick along the circumference. Aftertaste is malt and a very balanced alcohol warmth.  Mouthfeel is creamy and leaves no stickiness on the palate -- clean.  A high ABV is the only reason I'm not giving drinkability a 5.  I'll definitely try this again, along with the other Chimay brews. It's perfect for a rainy winter evening, like tonight.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,theo692,4.1,"A wonderful beer, from the moment you decide to take it off the rack until the last sip. Opening it is a ceremony in itself, like deciding to crack open a fine champagne. The aroma hints that it will be a heavy beer, as do the dark color and dense head. But the taste surprises - a hint of malt, to be sure, but it's not cloying in any way. A smooth flavor that warms as it goes, and a clean finish.  I have tried other beers of this type that attempt to replicate Chimay's remarkable flavor and balance (while packing quite a wallop). I won't name names, but I've found them to be far too aggressive in their flavors (nutty, oaky, or just plain alcohol-y).  Remarkably, this beer feels at home on a night before the fire or a spring afternoon; with a strong cheese or by itself; one or several.

The carbonation gave the mouthfeel almost soda pop-like resemblances, and it seemed to leave a coating on the palate that lingered after swallowing. The flavor was sweet and yeasty, with sort of a toasted highlight. It's a pretty beer and everything was good, but it didn't leave me wanting another one immediately, so it lost a few points in the drinkability department.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

215,2512,joecast,4.63,"wow, what a beer! crack open the top and watch it work. its like the yeast gets into overdrive and starts working again (ok so its probably only co2, but its cool to watch), to the point that the sediment gets disturbed and redistributed throughout the bottle.  a head starts forming in the bottle forcing me to pour before i am finished admiring the action of whats happening inside. pour into what i think its a sufficiently large glass. no, the head is enourmous! and that color. beige always seemed like such a dull color before.  the aroma is mesmerizing. sweet malty and faintly of concentrated fruit syrup (berries?). maybe some brown sugar as well. the beer itself is a deep mahogany color. just light enough to see the sediment floating around at the edges of the glass. almost a dark ruby color when held up to light.  again a sweet malty taste, and strong, but not a harsh alcohol flavor for 9%abv. just a warming finish at the back of your mouth.  easily the best beer ive ever had (yet). everything about it is just done right, not too much not too little. more please???",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Smells fruity, yeasty and of alcohol. Good malt and hop presence in the aroma too.  Taste is good. Alcohol soaked fruit, a hint of licorice, candied something. There's a little bit of an astringent taste in there though.  Mouthfeel is pretty standard, a rush of foam then clear bubbly beer.  Drinkability - not worth the price, but a good brew.

215,2512,Boilermaker88,3.7,"Presented in the signature stubby brown bottle with the blue label, Chimay's top-of-the-line beer had a murky dark brown hue and a compact, resilient off-white head that grudgingly faded to a small cap, leaving behind wispy lace. The smell was an understated blend of bready malt, candy sugar, and some alcohol-soaked dark fruit. A hint of nuts briefly surfaced after it warmed a bit. The taste had an earthy maltiness and some raisin and candied plum notes for a sweet opening. A yeast infused nut bread flavor and light chocolate and toffee also played across the palate. Unfortunately, a harshly astringent alcohol flavor grabbed the back of the tongue, resulting in a rather unappealing metallic taste, something I noticed in all of Chimay's offerings. The feel was medium-bodied, well carbonated and dry. Well, I've had all three of the Chimay brews I've seen and none, including the Grand Reserve, have shown me anything to make me get all excited over them. This beer definitely gets better as it nears room temp but never quite reaches the mark for me. Maybe it should have sat in my cellar longer. Somehow, I don't think that would have helped all that much.

Tasting revealed a smooth, complex ale with a nice, bitter kick and a sweet, alcoholic finish. Sooo good.  Every time I taste this beer, I'm surprised yet again by how good it is.

Color is an unimpressive muddy brown. Head is big, poofey, brown and gorgeous. It lasted the whole glass leaving a this tihck lace.  A most aromatic brew, the smells of Belgian yeast, with a touch of sweet. Theres more complexity there, but my snorter is a bit dysfunctional.  A beer that makes my mouth feel like a regal king. Smooth, spicy, flavorful, full bodied, never heavy. Just magnificent. More details; as the beer passes the lips a flavor of bittersweet chocolate, followed by that slight wheatiness of Belgian yeast. Both of the flavors are preseant when the spicy hops hit the tounge and wrap the etire package together. Overall some hints of banana and just a perfect amount of bitter make this beer astounding.  The beer feels a touch watery in the mouth, but the amazing flavor seems go deeper than the taste buds, adding a kick throughout the whole mouth.

215,2512,DagFishHead,4.7,"Appearance: Interesting amalgamation of brown, bronze, and amber colors... cloudy like a dark apple cider with suspended particulates. Thick, khaki meringue head fades to a persistent 1/4"" capper with minimal, but creamy lace. Smell: Semi-sweet toasted malt, peppery, earthy, dark/ripe fruits, astringent alcohol and yeast blast. Taste: Light sweet toasted malts with raisin, plum, fig/date dissolve to a pleasant yeast sourness in the middle, then apparently concluding with a crisp dry citrus finish.. but, then a warm alcohol flourish. Combined with the ethereal mouthfeel, one hell of a ride. Mouthfeel: Champagne bubbly carbonation, full yet surprisingly light.. like a mousse, full bodied but vanishes leaving a pleasant ghostly memory. Delightful. Drinkability: Deceptively drinkable high ABV brew. Crack this open as an alternate to champagne for your next celebration.

It has that sour-ish fruity flavor, mixed with some sugary sweetness and it doesn't taste too boozy and isn't thick, so the drinkability is very good. You can forget yourself.

I would love to sample this beer in the proper glassware, but I do not have any available at the moment...  The aroma is strongly of yeast and fruit, with a bit of an alcohol undertone. The appearance is dark reddish-brown that just barely allows a bit of light to sneak through it. As I drink this beer, it forms a persistent lace down the side of the glass.  The flavor is excellent. An initial sweetness assaults the tongue, with a strong carbonation sending the flavors fizzing all over the palate. It settles to a rich fruity and spicy taste, and leaves a sweet, malty coating on the tongue. There's an understated bitterness that keeps the sweetness from becoming cloying.

The 1991 bottle poured just like a current bottle would minus the head of course. Alot of woody notes in the nose as well as the fruitiness of cherries and raisin with a pinch of spice. While there were many of Chimay's ""beer"" qualities in this bottle, you knew you were drinking something aged for 12 yrs. The beer as a whole was much more mellow and smooth...refined might be a good word. Still an excellent beer.  The 1981 version on the other hand was much different then a current bottle of Chimay. And what can expect after being cellared for 22 yrs? Much like the 1991 version there was plenty of grape, cherry and raisin in the nose, except this time there weren't ""hints"". This time everything was much more pronounced. The aromas and flavours jumped out at you. Grape & cherry sweetness. An oaky woddiness. A toned down spiciness. Exceptional smoothness. You could really tell the difference and make no mistake between the 1991 & the 1981.  The finsh lingered nicely but almost faded a little too quick. It left me always wanting more. While this beer taste less and less like a ""beer"" the more it was aged, it was still exciting to see how a beer can change in complexity and become a more refined drink.

Settling in with Chimay is such a blessing, and a wonderful drinking experience.  After pouring my 11.2 oz. glass into my Orval goblet (forgive me Father Theodore), I was immediately struck by the lovely creamy head that poured out. As I took several looks at this lovely brew before tasting, I noticed the deep mahagony color (just barely translucent), and begin to sip.  Yep, never a letdown with Chimay Blue. The mouthfeel was just right, with enough body up front, but particularly in the finish. I did get some citrus-y notes, too, but the taste of raisons also came through in this sample.

Nose is dull and kinda light, not much going on besides some light lemon peel citrus and yeast, a touch smokey and meaty upon bigger wiffs.  Taste is short lived and a bit boring, complexity is not very forthcoming from this offering. Very dull citrus of melon husk and majorly dulled lemon and peels, lightly sweet malts and subdued spicy yeast with some strange uneven texture that I didn't care for all that much.  Feel is medium bodied with a weird texture I just couldn't get past. Where's the smooth? Where's the creamy? Blah, boring, yuk. Not impressed. The Chimay Red was much better. I'm not sure if I have a bad bottle or what, but I've been saving this bottle, plus a few others for nearly 4 months hoping a bit of aging would make for an interesting session, but nope.

Everything blended very well together, and all I could make out were notes of alcohol and biscuity malts. A bit overwhelming. This was part 3 of a 3 part vertical Chimay tasting.

Cherries and citrus orange, a bit woody and spicy, yeasty booze resonance. It's quite inviting.  The flavour is bold and heavy, yet not overpowering, sort of like Baby Bear's porridge: it's just right. The taste of spice and wood chips is the first to make an appearance, a bit smoky in the middle with a boozy citrus finish.

As good as it looks, it gets better when you lift the glass and catch the nose which really starts the tastebuds to wake-up. The mouth is very full but doesn't overwhelm you with the alcohol which comes on more in the finish.

Had a bit of sherry in the nose, which I attribute to its age, as well as some dark caramel overtones. The taste was still quite chimay like (imagine that). The body was a bit thinner than younger version, and it was much more mellow with much of the esters, fruitiness, and bitterness having aged out. Overall if I had to guess I would say that a well cared for 8 year old must be fabulous.   33cl Bottle, Sampled December 2004 Pours a fairly clear, deep ruby-amber-brown color. It is topped by a tan head and is pretty well carbonated. The aroma is fruity and musty, with notes of prunes, alcohol, and raisins. The taste is sweet up front, with a rich malty center that moves to a fizzy rich finish. This is actually quite a bit better than I was expecting it to be. It is fairly light on the palate, especially given its strength, but it does have a slightly lingering rich malt note to it. It is pretty fruity with concentrated notes of raisin and fig, as well as some spicy yeast notes that hint at ginger, cardamom, and clove.

215,2512,RoyalT,4.23,"I tasted this right after the Premier for comparison purposes.  Appearance  Dark, rich brown color with a full, lacing head. The cloudy hue that comes out of this bottle makes your mouth water.  Smell  Opened up to a nice, fruity malt aroma and a brief ABV warning.  Taste  To my tastes, this is exactly what a Belgium Strong Dark Ale should be. The classic tobacco flavor compliments the huge malt and yeast. It all plays exceptionally well over the tongue. Of all the flavors to be found here, I enjoyed most the current, caramel, and dark toffee blend that seemed to kick in at the end, especially as the beer sat.  Mouthfeel  The conservative carbonation was suitable for the style. However, the foamy up front feeling was not to my liking.  Drinkability  This has to be one of the smoothest, easily-drinkable 9.0 ABV on the market. Again, the fizzy front end slowed things down a bit, but once I picked up the body is was quite drinkable.  Comments  I hate to go overboard on a brand available in half of Americas grocery stores (at least here in Seattle it is), but this beer is terrific. If I had the money, I would sip this every time I tasted another Belgium. IMHO, this is the standard by which all others must be judged.  Update: The 2004 vintage is more of the same.

The taste was very flowery sweet. Mouthfeel was slightly heavy and it was well carbonated. Drinkability-wise, I'd have as many as I could afford!!!!  This is easily the best beer that Chimay produces. I was lucky enough to get mine for $10, but I would pay twice that for something of this quality.

The smell was of dark malt and was not astringent in any way compared to the beers overall darkness. Tasted exceptional with a thorough maltiness and subdued hops that kept it in a somewhat balance but the malt is the predominant flavor with alcohol not being apparent at all within this elixir. All together a very drinkable beer that I find to be rewarding experience each every time I drink. Only problem I find with this beer is that it is much to drinkable given its high abv.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

215,2512,feloniousmonk,3.76,"""Pop!"" goes the top, the resounding sound of cork's release a tease of what lies in store.  Color, a ruddy brown, tawny and opaque. Head is off-white, fuzzy and activley bubbly.  Aroma: playing it quiet, actually spare, arid, I'm getting nothing at all! Light echoes of nuts and toffee, wafts of maltiness. Not too happy with this aspect.  On first sip, a big blast of hops, with malt following immediately on it's heels. We find that this is a brew that must be allowed time to open up, give it a little time and space...shows off earthy, nutty, chocolatey flavors, with a generous amount of zippy, zingy spark on the palate. Taste becomes better, richer, more complex and fruity. Excellent effervescence, featuring that special Belgian spark and yeasty taste. Smooth, though before long the alcoholic component kicks in and rides tall in the saddle.  I've neglected Chimay for quite some time, perhaps after encountering Ommegang, a better tasting ale, in my opinion, when fresh, and at 1/2 the price. Perhaps I've got to try this cellaring business to see what an older sample might offer up to us.  On this tasting, a pretty nice drink, but didn't blow me away.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,kindestcut,4.7,"Well, I thought I should probably get down to reviewing my first favorite Belgian beer since I've moved so far beyond just drinking Chimay. I may have strayed from the Chimay fold quite a bit but this beer is still one of my favorites, especially of this style.  The Chimay Blue pours a rich, dark amber-brown. The beer glows around the edges. The off-white head is tall and very active. As a classic Belgian beer should, the head left a sticky lace as it retreated. The beer just looks like it tastes good.  The aroma is quite complex, a heady mixture of sweetness (brown sugar, malt), fruit (plums, carmelized apples) and distant alcohol. The flavor is very much a continuation of the aroma, dominated by a heavy sweetness and fruit that almost completely hides the alcohol. This, this beer gets a high drinkability score from me.  I know there are more ""perfect"" Belgians out there and Chimay gets a bad rap from some who are not as enchanted with it as they used to be, but this beer to me is a classic. The king.  Ultimately, it tastes damn good and I can't think of a better recommendation than that.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,marburg,4.92,"I've waited until now to review this beer, despite the fact that I've had it a few times since I joined BA, for a very special reason. I had, up until last night, a magnum of this. Figuring that it might be more fun to review this from such a unique bottle, I waited until I had an opportunity to share it with a few friends. So last night, we broke into 1.5L of pure bliss...  The cork read ""03/93,"" so I was quite overjoyed since I didn't think I'd ever had anything much older than a year previously. I was ready to go, and there certainly was no disappointment. What a fine, mellow, subtle beer this has become. Definitely lighter than I remember Chimay Grand Reserve being, the contents of this bottle were an almost red-wine color -- a slightly off shade of brown that sees a great deal of light shining through the murky territory found beneath the half inch or so of fluffy off-white head -- a head that disappears very quickly.  The aromas coming off this beer are subtle and very well blended. Very sweet-smelling notes of candi sugar, raisins, and just the slightest tingle of an alcholic aroma. The flavor is a magnificent continuation of the aroma. Sweet malts, light notes of prunes and raisins blend to a *very* slightly bitter middle-to-end -- the alcohol and potential hop bitterness have been reduced to a slight bitterness reminiscent of the skin of a plum. Exceptionally mellow and easy to drink. I had a little over half of the bottle myself and left the rest for two friends to share.  This was an absolute treat -- and something of a surprise. I didn't know this bottle was going to be ten years old. But I'm sure as hell glad it was!!! Great experience.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

There is about 1 finger of head that has a pretty good retention, leaving a bit of lace on the glass. The aroma is very spicy, mostly cloves. The taste has a pretty good spicy bite to it, but it could use a little bit more hops. The finish seems to be a little weak. The mouthfeel is only average and the drinkability is not too high. Not too bad overall.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,Mitchster,4.03,"$9.99 for a 750ml corked and caged bottle. Originally reviewed 5/4/03, re-reviewed 8/24/10.  Pours out to a cloudy mahogany, forming an effervescent light tan head which forms a 2"" peak above the rim of the glass after the pour. The head is of a soapy thin meringue consistency and sits atop small to medium sized bubbles with excellent retention and delicate lacing. Little bits of yeast and debris are mixed in the head and frantically dance in the brisk carbonation, reminding me of spice sprinkled on a pumpkin pie. The aroma is sharp, with a distant smoked cheese & clove aroma, raw applejuice which is starting to ferment, and distant seared meat. I am not picking up on any fig, prune, date, raisin or anything of the like mentioned in other reviews. Mouthfeel is cidery and effervescent with a medium-light body despite it's strength. Taste begins spicy, with lots of phenolic cloves, perhaps nutmeg...the malts are bready with a moderately-strong cookie sweetness. The finish is lightly yeasty, and semi-sweet with a very mild bitterness and cidery, lightly cloying, semi-dry mouthfeel. Distant metals linger in the finish. I still fail to detect any dark fruits here. Alcohol is never perceived in flavor or aroma...a mark of quality at this ABV.  A well-crafted brew. This isn't an amazing beer, as there are better examples of the style, especially for the price. For a few bucks cheaper, Unibroue's Trois Pistoles is just as good. However, this is my favorite Chimay out of the three. What is interesting is that after having had these three beers (the red, white, and blue), I have a very high index of suspicion that Unibroue uses this exact same yeast strain. The similarities are uncanny.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

I honestly don't think I would have appreciated the beer to nearly the degree I (now) do.  First pour shows a very dark beer with slight auburn highlights and a truly gorgeous creamy mocha head that diminished to a dense, sticky head that persisted to the last drop and lace that coated the inside of the glass.  Aromas are incredibly complex, with strong oak-aged madeira notes and hints of wheat/grain and some classic banana to balance it all. Now THIS is the way a beer should smell. My god - true perfection. It's hard to even think about tasting the beer as you suspect it simply cannot live up to the expectations set by these aromas.  Initial taste shows you wrong. This is an outrageously complex beer. Trying to describe it ends up with you sounding like you're a wine dork. ""Initial flavours of oak, leather and firm tannins soften to reveal deep cherry fruit."" But seriously, that's how it tastes to me. I taste hints of sherry, of chocolate, some solid phenols and banana leading to the hot alcohol finish. There are just SO many things going on on the tongue with this beer. Wow.  Truly one of the greatest beers in the world. A brilliant brew and a must experience for any fan of fine beverages.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

I smelled a sugary, syrupy, almost molasses type aroma.  Taste is smooth, a candied sweetness that does a remarkable job of hiding the alcohol.  Other folks picked up a few different flavors, but I really only got a sugar and syrup.  Would like to try again in the larger bottle to see if anything else is going on.

The murky liquid poured out into the glass like a rich molasses with less fullness. After several attempts at identifying the huge aroma that wafted freely from the glass I finally concluded that it is mostly like a prune smell - full and rich and wholesome. The flavors, of course, are quite complex and balanced. In attempting to grasp the predominant flavor, I bounced a sip on the front of my tongue for several seconds. The affect was simply amazing. There was an enormous sense of hot pepperiness. Not unpleasant, in fact, quite the opposite. There was an element of dried fruit in the taste along with almond oil, nuts, and roasted grain.

The complexity in smell and taste are unmatched by any beer I've sampled (I do have a Westvleteren 12 yet to be tried). Pours dark garnet in color with an initial sizeable sand colored head. I can smell the sweetness of the malt mixed with the floral Belgian yeast aroma. I also capture a hint of the alcohol contained in this magnificent beast. The carbonation is rather lively on the tongue and lightens the beer quite a bit, expecially for a beer of this gravity. At first, it is sweet followed by a balanced sourness. The alcohol bite demands quick attention. There is a bready/biscuit-esque quality to the taste. The Chimay yeast provides the benchmark Belgian yeast flavor addition. Floral, estery, malty, sour, slightly hoppy. This beer runs the gamut of the beer desciption. Finishes somewhat dry.  Just an incredible beer.

RE-review - As time has passed, and I have grown to appreciate beers like Rochefort and Westleverten, I have not enjoyed Chimay as much.

Appearance: Deep amber that poured a nice, fluffy off-white head. The head dissipated quickly, but left a tenacious ring of lace behind.  Smell: If this beer has a shortfall, it would be the smell. Heavy alcoholic nose, tempered by an oaky, earthy smell.  Taste: Very fizzy splash on the tongue, met with fruity, bitter wild cherry notes. Slight tongue-tingling numbing due to the high abv, but pleasantly warming. I can slightly taste cork, and the earthy tones again, with a slight and enjoyable sourness at the back of my tongue.

215,2512,Longstaff,4.82,"This is my 100th review and some might be thinking that this beer isn't special enough for such an occasion, but it is for me. Before I drank this for the first time, I used to be into so-so beers that I thought were great at the time. Beers like Harpoon, Redhook, Bass, Guiness, and Becks were regulars and I would occasionally drink Bud and Miller products. But after my first sip of this beer that my roomate introduced me to, it was like an epiphany, complete with bright lights and singing angels. I thought, wow, beer can taste like this? This was so unlike any other beer I have had up to that point that it changed my opinion of what beer is and what beer can and should be. After this experience, I never looked back at macros, and started to seek out other great tasting beers - which lead me to homebrewing and eventually the Beer Advocate website. Now my life has been changed forever -- all thanks to this great Belgian beer.  This review sample came from a 750ml bottle with a cork dated 03 2002.  This is very dark bodied beer with a hint of chestnut highlights and it poured out with a 3/4 inch mocha colored head that compacted down to an 1/8 inch and stayed until the last drop. Each sip produced a ring of lace that attached itself to the side of the Chimay goblet. Woody, sherry-like aromas with a touch of wheatish banana aromas mixing in. Up front you notice leather, wood, and sherry flavors mixed in with wine-like tannins. As the beer sits in the mouth breifly, wheat like phenols start to take over changing quickly to a cherry covered chocolate flavor. It has a sweet finish that lingers on the tounge with a slight banana and bittersweet chocolate flavor that mixes very well with the whiskey like vapors. When this beer warms I detect some black current flavors and the alcohol vapors seem to get hotter.

Not an everyday brew but one that I will return to over and over again.,Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,UncleJimbo,4.1,"Presentation: 11.2 oz amber bottle poured into a Chimay goblet.  Appearance: Cloudy, very dark brown with nice tan foam that dissipated fairly quickly to leave a trace on the surface.  Smell: The aroma was of sweet, dark malt. The smell benefitted from warming (the initial pour was cold from the refridgerator, but as it warmed in the glass, the smell became stronger).  Taste: Not an overly complex taste. Sweet malt dominates, with the flavor of alcohol noticeable. Slight flavor of floral hops. Moderate carbonation.  Mouthfeel: Sweet, thick, warming. Good.  Drinkability: Good. The subtle flavor grows on you.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,HossMcGraw,4.38,"I'm not yet sure if this was worth 10 dollars a bottle yet, but it is definitely the best of it's style that I've had to date. Pours a massive head that reduces to lace in about a minute. It's got a very dark appearance for a medium bodied beer. The aroma is very sweet and complex, with a strong yeast presence. Same goes for the taste. It's also got some ripe bananna and apple flavors with a slightly bitter aftertaste. It's a bit harsh due to the high carbonation and ABV, but after a glass or two of this, you'll be too buzzed to notice, not that I condone using this beer as a means of getting drunk (unless you can afford to. I sure as hell can't). Anyway, after drinking more of this throughout the process of writing this review, I would have to reccomend at least trying it. It's certainly a damn good Belgian.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Roasted malts dominate the nose with spruce undertones. Great mouthfeel. Feels heavier in the mouth than it looks. Nice alcohol warmth. Smooth hop bitterness plays around in the back of my mouth. Really great balance. Caramels & mollasses too. Well carbonated and creamy.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,TAMU99,4.35,"This is a great tasting, dark, wheat beer. It pours to a very dark brown with quite a bit of cloudiness and moderate head. Smell is average with balanced hops and malt. However, taste is exceptional. It has a deep, wheat body and a slightly sweet molasses flavor. It's not extremely complex but it is a very good beer! The only drawback is the price. At $10.50/ bottle reserve for special occasions but do not hesitate to try this one. Definitely one of my top recommendations.   Update: 10/24/03 After this young grasshopper has traveled the beer world, I have learned much. This excellent beer deserves a better rating.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,mzwolinski,4.8,"Dark brown in color with a finger-thick, off-white foamy head, which quickly settles into a nice creamy top. Aroma is fruity and spicy, with evident alcohol notes. Flavor is malty sweet with a creamy body -- quite luxurious. Malt takes on a slightly roasted flavor mid-palate, where it is complemented by a variety of spicy notes, a slight apple-like tartness, and the warming sensation of alcohol. Finish is just hopped enough for balance, and is slightly smoky in flavor. Aftertaste is a bit sour. Reading back on this review, those descriptors (smoky, sour, apple-like, roasty) don't seem to go well together, but it is the wonder of Chimay that it manages to pull it off with style. A classic Trappist ale and well worth buying a number of -- some for now, and some to cellar for later!",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,CharlesRiver,4.08,"Dark brown in color with that typical Chimay white fluffy head that lasts and lasts. The first thing that hits you is the bubbles, this one is very effervesent. Malty and sweet in smell. Spicy, peppery and malty in flavor. The end aftertaste is much the same with a hint of alcohol that gives that warming feeling.  Now that I have sampled all three Chimay beers I think that I like the Red the best, followed closely by the Blue. All three are very good, I am just a bit partial to the Red.

Very clean and drinkable for a darker belgian. The mouth smooths as the brew warms in the goblet. At 9% it does the trick. Smooth yet crisp this is a great selection with food during the fall months.,Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,Wildman,4,"This beer poured a very dark amber color and formed a bubbly off white head that left trace lace. It had an aroma of malt, currents/plums and citrus. The flavor was of malt, caramel and cirtrus. The body has a nice slightly creamy aspect to it and the finish just hints at the alcohol and a slight carbonation feel to it. This by far the best of the Chimays and worthy of it's title Grand Reserve.

What a nose, would make Jimmy Durante proud, large in malt, sweet, hints of caramel and yes, maybe yeast, down right sniffable. Begins malt sweet, the top middling in feel, the finish beautifully hopped, majestically carbonated and the aftertaste as dry as the Arizona Desert.

215,2512,aaronh,4.73,"This dark brown ale has amber highlights and pours with a beautiful head that appears to have two distinct layers. The lower 2/3 of the head has a medium density bubble, while the upper 1/3 has a very fine bubble density and looks very creamy. The head retention on this beer is fantastic, and it leaves an enticing lace. The aroma has a maltiness to it, but also exhibits many earthy tones, as well as a hint of orange peel. The flavor is simply an explosion of taste. Definite citus notes, very heavy on the orange peel, but followed by caramel sweetness. The alcohol is noticeable. There also seems ot be a spiciness to the beer, with pepper and maybe a hint of coriander in the finish. There is so much going on it is hard to isolate the flavors, which blend together into a beautiful kaleidoscope of taste. The mouthfeel is superb, with a slightly thick feel, yet not overpowering. I wouldn't mind drinking this beer regularly, but couldn't have many in one sitting. Having tried this, I now know what many American interpretations of the Belgian Strong Ale style are attempting to present. Where many fall short, this beer comes up big. Obviously a classic that I should have enjoyed sooner.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,hyuga,4.43,"Pours into the Chimay goblet a deep, dark wood-stain amber crowned with a large white Belgian head, which stays beautifully like a blanket of snow. Wonderfully complex and immense aroma of freshly cut oranges with a little banana and other subtle fruit, possibly strawberry, along with some spicy dried fruit and a hint of pepper. What a flavor! First, sweet caramel with a spicy outer shell rolls in. The next wave hits in the middle of the palate, pepper rides in on the edges of fresh fruit, tangy orange, sweet banana, and berries. Alcohol warms the mouth near the end, and is noticeable in the aftertaste and with retro-olfaction. Caramel malt is again present in the finish. Due to the malty backbone, the mouthfeel isn't totally dominated by carbonation as it can sometimes be in other Belgian-style beers. However, that big backbone also makes it slightly less drinkable. The keyword there is ""slightly"". I'd like to stress that this is a true masterpiece of a beer that does not need high drinkability for enjoyment, especially since you'd only want to drink one or two of these at a time due to the high alcohol content. Not that you won't be thirsty for more of this mouth-watering elixir. I'd love to have some Chimay cheese to pair with this. I picked this up today in a gift pack containing this and the other two widely known Chimay offerings as well as the signature chalice for only $10.99. Great deal, considering how much the singles cost, it's like getting the glass for free.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,Morris729,4.5,"Pours a rich deep brown with a cream-colored head that dissipated much quicker than I expected but did a nice job of clinging to the sides of the glass while drinking. The aroma is dominated by yeast with hints of fresh fruit and flowers. The flavor is a combination of roasted malt and dried fruit. As the beer warmed, it seemed to take on more of a woody/earthy flavor. Very nice. For a 9% brew, it is deceivingly smooth in the mouth. It would be quite easy to have a few too many of these, if not for the steep price of $7.99 for a 750ml, that is.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Pours out thick and brown, with a fair amount of head. Really quite amazing to look at. The smell hinted at some fruit, and a nice mellow flavour. The taste followed up, as everyone says, with fruit, berries, etc. Smooth and tasty, yes, but where's the bite? It was great, but lacked something distinguishing, something to hook me. What I got was a smooth, good beer with no edge.  Me, I like a bit of edge.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,cokes,3.21,"Dated 09/01. Throws a nice-looking glass that is both golden-amber and hazed dark brown, depending upon which part of the glass one is viewing. Sizeable head fades out somewhat quickly...sticks around though. Aroma mostly of cardboard and other paper products. Dark fruit lies below this. But there is alot of recycling to do before the fruit hits. Taste is intially of the dark fruit, with raisin and plum standing out. Sour grapes are pushes back, but are evident. Yeast is a big soggy monster. Musty and dank. Sometimes I find that attractive, but not here. Mushy, and wet after the fruit burst. Like bread soaking in water. Spice is not up to what I expect. Lightly clovey. Otherwise not much. Let me go on record as saying that I hate whatever yeast strand Chimay uses. I'll go off the record and say that Chimay may be the most overrated brewery on the planet. Mouthfeel is once-again musty. Spritzy up front, but fades rapidly. Like a mouth full of potatoes....with just as much pizazz. Alcohol is a nonfactor...so if that is your key to drinkability..then this is sublime...however I would fall asleep first from boredom rather than the ABV. Though, I must say that this is my favorite Chimay offering.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,aracauna,4.44,"The beer pours with a lazy, quick disipating head, which is surprising. I'm used to having almost as much head as beer with belgian strongs. What head did form is a pale tan with gray notes.  There's a strong yeastiness to the aroma, almost like bread dough just as it starts to bake. The aroma is also very grapey/winey. It reminds me immediately of the wine the church I went to as a child uses for Communion. Below the yeast and wine I noticed a smell making me think of Rollos and Caramel Twix with light chocolate and caramel malt aromas.  The flavor is an exercise in the melding of light and darkness. The bright flavors of bubblegum esters, yeastiness, the very faint sourness common to the style, chalk and the alcohol (very faint and only at the end) made for a very bright character that both contrasted and complimented the dark tones of the chocolate and caramel, a slight burnt bitterness and an even fainter smokiness. I was especially surprised to pick up on the burnt and smoke flavors, two flavors I've never noticed in any of the Belgian strong dark ales.  The palate is surprisingly carbonated considering the wimpy head but lacks the cottony carbonation that many of the lighter strongs (including Chimay Red) have that turns me off. The carbonation here balance the slightly creamy mouthfeel nicely.  I was really surprised by this beer. It's probably one of very few of the style that I'd actually buy on a regular basis.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,Dogbrick,4.27,"2001 version. I have been looking forward to trying this one for quite awhile (thanks to a trade with an Aussie gent!). Definitely worth the wait. Chimay Red is a real letdown compared to this. This isn't the best beer I have ever had but it is definitely up there. I only wish I had a fancy goblet to drink these Belgian ales in. Healthy, lively head over an earthy dark brown beer. Fruit, caramel and toffee in the aroma. As with the Westy, the flavor seemed to morph as I drank it, something like liquid Grape Nuts. The flavor came out more and more as it warmed, so the beer got even better as I drank it. A true classic.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

215,2512,TheLongBeachBum,4.18,"Cork Date = 05/01. In its grown up bottle, Chimay Bleue (Blue) is called Grande Réserve. Well presented in the 75cl bottle, I do profess to dearly missing the old style Chimay labels, that had the larger Peres Trappistes Fleur-De-Leys. Oh well, thats progress I suppose. The cork has one function, to protect the contents on its quest  to wherever and whenever it may be. With the golden steel cap and cage removed, it performed its task to the death, with Bodyguard devotion. It really took some extracting, and when it finally gave in, the beer slowly gushed forth, with a brown well-aerated and carbonated head similar to the effects of opening a warm bottle of Coca-Cola - in fact the head looks strangely similar. I opened and served the beer at 62 F, well towards the upper end of the suggested scale but I like it that way. A lovely deep, rich ruby, translucent color, with some floaties, but only a few and they do not detract whatsoever for me. The head settled quickly to a thin patchy uni-bubble thickness that grasped the sides with a feverish capillary action to give a brown halo-head all around the Goblet at the interface between glass, air and beer. Aromas are feint at first, but built up as the beer warmed. A sweet, lightly roasted, malt nose. Mouth feel is good, and I was immediately reminded of alcohol soaked dark dried fruits that my Mum would buy at Xmas; Dates, Figs, Raisins, etc. A woody (Oak?) malt finish with some sweet-dryness. Strong lingering flavours in the attenuation. For a 9% ABV beer, it does have a very mild warming as it travels, but it is not harsh, and quite pleasant. It has a marvellous finish, long toasted woody malt residues with some soft spiciness. An extremely well balanced, accomplished easy drinking strong beer that is of the highest quality and pedigree. Chimay Blue, as I will always refer to it, is a favourite of mine. Now that it is widely available, some people like to knock and snub this beer in favour of the other harder to find Trappiste Beers. This is still a Very Good Strong Beer in my opinion; Commercially available, Trappist or not!! Highly Recommended, and best after 2-3 years in my experience.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,Jon,4.13,"Chimay pours a dark brown liquid with a fluffy off-white head that clings to the glass. Smell is quite sweet and malty. The first sip reveals a huge fig character, followed by candy sugar and ending on a note of vanilla bean. Very interesting. Possesses a lightly carbonated mouthfeel and seems to be a touch thin.

Flavor begins sweet with malt, and fig. Becomes slightly bitter in the middle, and finishes with a vanilla flavor and noticable alcohol. Body is thin for the style, and carbonation is quite high.

215,2512,BeerAngel,3.41,Cork Date: August 2001. Pours a very dark tea color that is slightly hazy. Produced a three finger head that is slightly off-white with staying power. The smell was very faint with the only detectable aroma being a slightly sweet yeasty smell. The taste was definitely remnant of old as it had a musty book smell type taste with raisins and yeast. Very well balanced and the higher alcohol was not even noticeable by taste. Bless the monks! Op uw gezonheid!,Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,MAB,4.83,"I've had and appreciated the ""red cap"" Chimay for years, but recently got some ""blue cap""- and it blew me away! The color is incredible- deep opaque red brown, almost as opaque as a stout. The smell is wonderful; yeasty and spicy. It has a lot of head, and leaves the ""lace"" as it is drank down. Besides being malty, I detect a sort of clove-like flavor that I can't get enough of. Of the two, the Blue is my preferred version, but it is so different from the Red, that I can enjoy the Red just as much at other times.

215,2512,beernut7,4.1,This deep dark Belgian brew pours into the goblet with a color like an abyss. The foamy beige head dissipates rather quickly but gives off an earthy aroma with hints of Belgian yeast and the scent of raisins. The flavor literally crescendos from the first sip from a light bubbly earthy flavor to a deep raisin and dark malt with a warming character that rivals a bonfire after a day in the freezing wilderness. The finish is clean and slightly fruity. The aerated mouth-feel does not at all harsh the brew. I am really developing a love for Belgian Ales.,Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,NeroFiddled,4.79,"750ml bottle, corked & caged. Hazy with yeast & sediment in suspension. Dark tawny copper with reddish highlights. The slight head is made up of very fine light tan bubbles that cannot hold. Lace is limited as well (probably linked to the high alcohol and youth of the bottle). One would hope that a greater head will develop with age. The aroma is rich with dark fruit, candyish notes, alcohol and a toasted maltiness. The body is medium with a lively but gentle effervescence from tiny bubbles, giving a zesty-spritzy mouthfeel that compliments the spice and pepper notes of the beer. The flavor is sweet with a soft, fruity character that's reminiscent of all the Chimay beers, and delicately balanced by bitterness and spice. Swirling flavors of dark fruits, spicy complex alcohols and soft chocolate-like malts combine in a light, but impressive display across the palate. The alcohol is not overly aggressive but still quite noticeable in this, Chimay's strongest beer at 9%. The finish is somewhat thin with a slightly dry lingering aftertaste. At times I've considered each of the 3 Chimay beers to be my favorite, which I see as a great tribute to the monastery. This particular vintage is a bit young at present, but it's still quite unique and very enjoyable as it is. A year of cellaring should improve it greatly.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95

Rich rum soaked fruits hit your taste buds, first, then some yeast middle. Lots of subtle tastes present. Alcohol is noticable, and makes for a thin feel.

Either this beer is fairly bland or I just have a hard time identifying taste qualities in Belgian beers. I get a little sour tartness and a deeply hidden candied apple taste. I don't get much more.

Suspended aggregates of yeast from the bottle conditioning. Yeast esters are surprisingly mild, consisting of mild clove and peppermint are perceptible along with pleasantly mellow tart fruit.

Caramelized dark candi sugar notes are also present, but aren't assertive. Mid palate dryish chocolate malt coupled w/ the light hop bitterness lend a bittersweet note and tart fruity esters akin to unripe plums emerge.

215,2512,John,5,Presentation: 33cl (11.2oz.) capped bottle. Exceptional brew all the way around. Gorgeous dark and hazy appearance. Big malty sweetness blends with peppery yeast spiciness and pleasant alcohol warming sensation. A brew to savor on a special occasion.,Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,bk3nj,4.36,"This is one beer that will make you silly quicker than you would ever expect.. It's STRONG, but it tastes so good (very complex fruit notes), you'd never realize what it's doing to you.. This is made by monks?!? They must have a wicked sense of humor..",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
215,2512,mmthompson33,5,"This beer demands respect. To fully appreciate it, it should be drank at the proper temperature, and hope that you have a good bottle, because the quality can vary. But if you get one of the good bottles....it's heaven. Incredible head and aroma, with a surprisingly light, fruity complex taste for its dark color. And some serious 9% kick. Drinking this beer at a campground near the brewery in Chimay, Belgium (where a 750ml bottle is $2.50) was a religious experience.",Bières de Chimay,Belgium,Belgian Dark Strong Ale,95
