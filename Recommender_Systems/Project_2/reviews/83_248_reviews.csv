83,248,Profundobaso,3.87,"Look - 11.2 fl oz bottle poured into a tulip glass. lemon yellow in color, hazy, with a beautiful two inch head and excellent lacing retention.  Smell - Belgian yeast, with orange peels and coriander. typical scents as expected from a wit.  Taste - moderate wheat flavor supplemented by the orange peels and coriander, both noticeable in the taste. a bit thin on feel, and finish is fairly clean with a bit of residual wheat flavors.  Feel - medium bodied, though on the lighter side. medium high carbonation. appropriate in ABV for the style at 4.9%.  Overall - despite being owned by AB, this is really a very decent representation of a Belgian wit. a tad bit too thin on the mouthfeel, but otherwise gets everything else spot on.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

83,248,MikeWard,3.83,"330ml bottle into a pint glass. Best by 5/26/23, so plenty fresh.  Looks nice in the glass. A glassy pale yellow body with a small white head, shrinking to a ring and covering.  Strong banana, wheat, yeasty aroma.  On tasting, confirms the nose. It's very strong, maybe a little too strong.  Mouth closer to full than medium, finish wheat, yeast, and a faint bitter note.  Overall, pretty decent witbier, maybe a bit too strong to be considered refreshing, but a nice enough drink.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

83,248,1009,3.84,"As summer comes to an unofficial close this weekend, this is a good time to remember a nice summer time brew. We picked up a pack of Hoegaarden a few weeks ago and enjoyed them in rapid succession on a nice rooftop night. This beer is Allagash and Blue Moon with some balls. Great spice to these suds with lovely orange notes and a real spice kick. Both RC and myself had never had it before and I'm sure it will be revisited soon.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,gjdgjdgjd,4.73,"One of my top beers. It is amazing that something bursting with so much flavor is so inexpensive relatively.  Strong wheat flavors, mixed with something herbal or botanical.

The head recedes to a thin cap. The aroma is mild with coriander, wheat malt and vague citrus peel. The taste is all of that with a nice injection of clove / bubblegum yeast flavor.

83,248,TheBricenator,4.25,"Look: Cloudy bright yellow and even my fairly gentle pour brings on a huge pure white head that swell and holds as a silky pillow, slowly pulling back and leaving great lacing behind Aroma: Wheat, lemon-orange notes, coriander, wafts of grass, some spice notes, and yeast Taste: Spice, coriander, and the lemon-orange citrus note kick it off as waves of wheat malt come crashing in and soon are dominant in the mix. Yeast is present throughout and prominent after the initial hit and closes with wheat, spices, and citrus Mouthfeel: Full, silky smooth throughout, medium-high carbonation, and a soft and fairly clean finish Overall: This is delicious stuff. I enjoy Witbiers a lot, especially in the warmer months and it had been years (sadly) since I had the O.G. of this style so it was an easy purchase. Very tasty and true-to-form – plenty of wheat, coriander, spices, citrus, and yeast all with a killer mouthfeel that really solidifies its place at the top.

I've read that it's the archetype of said category, and after having sampled (cases) of both domestic and import variations of said category, I can believe it's the original.  Nice cloudy amber with a nice amount of head that stuck around for a while. Not much lacing. Nice ""full"" mouthfeel with moderate carbonation, not too bubbly. Subtle notes of orange and fall spices.  Served cold on a hot day and you'll be hooked. Great drinkability.

Yes, some 10$ micro brews achieve the same result , but when I open a 10$ per bottle local brew, I expect it to be better, otherwise what's the point. European beers will still beat any US brews at any time of the week when it comes to flavored line of product. It's in the water, it is simply better water in EU.

The head started fluffy white and prevented me from getting a full bottle into the glass in a single try, even on a fairly light pour.  Nose is as expected with banana and an somewhat earthy sorta spice - coriander. There's a little bit of mineral to soapy note like some say of cilantro, but it is missing the herbal aspect of the leafys. Taste brings the mineral water backed by the coriander, with the wheat banana note being a very light platform for these to dance across. A little bit of white pepper joins by mid-taste, and I think it sorta counters and quells an slight increase in banana flavor.  The feel is fairly thin, and there's more carbonation than I expected. There's more heft and smoothness than a seltzer, but my mind did drift to that drink as I tried to figure this beer out. The back end is actually pretty dry.  Lighter overall with a nice aroma the taste (and feel) don't live up to for me.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

83,248,kookajamo,3.48,"It's hoegaarden, if you haven't tried one you definitely should but don't expect it to be the best Belgian wheat beer you've ever had. A few decades ago before the craft beer surge this was probably an upper echelon beer, but in the last decade brewing has come a long way and left InBev beers like this in the dust.  Pours a slightly hazy straw gold. Well carbonated and spritz-y. Traditional flavors of coriander and orange peel are present but muted, probably InBev's doing. Finishes light but watery. Aftertaste doesn't linger long. This is significantly better than comparably priced beers such as Miller or Bluemoon, but that's not saying much. Surprising to see so many 4+ reviews on this, even some perfect 5s. Not to sound overly snooty but anyone reading who would rate this in the 4.5-5.0 range should do themselves a favor and try some real craft beers.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,Steve555,3.87,"Drank from a massive 750ml bottle. Cream coloured body with fizzy white two finger head that sparkles noisily then settles to a permanent half finger head. Taste of wheat, lemon (as I added a slice of lemon to it) and hint of spices, , touch of clove, very little to no bitterness and is full bodied and hearty but like a lot of wheat beers is slightly bland. Whilst added lemon or lime to lager is a sin, citrus definitely enhances the flavour profile of this beer. Finish is vaguely citrus acid and dry, slightly cloying when drunk quickly but not unpleasantly so.  It's a pleasant easy drinker and definitely a must try but I'm sure it was a bit tastier 20 years or so ago when it was all the rage with Cardiff metropolitans. You were always disappointed if they ran out of the special Hoegaarden glasses and served it to you in a regular pint glass.

Citrus and fruit (banana, pears) smells with spice and then the sweet wheat come through. More aromatic than the Paulaner hefe i had before it. But there is a hint of metallic smell, im sure is not from the cap.  T - First impression of bright citrus, fruits, and then sweet wheat. Evolves into spices, yeast, some grass, honey. Then ends with a malty / bready flavor that lingers for just a bit.  F - Bright and crisp, may be sharp for some. strong carbonation though not visible in the glass. A dry finishbut otherwise a light and easy drink.  O - I was surprised to like this more than the Paulaner Hefe, but is not as smooth. This has more of a bright, edgy and summery character with emphasis on the citrus and spices, but with just enough sweetness.

Stimulates the underside of the tongue and the back teeth vs any of the taste buds. One of my favourite bar beer mixes is to order a black and white (Guiness and Hoegaarden) if the mood strikes me.

83,248,Ozzylizard,3.95,"Not on my receipt from Total Wine, Selma, TX, so free beer! Reviewed 10/12/19. Marked “Best before end: 08/12/19” on back label. On shelf at store, stored and served at 42 degrees. Appearance – 4. First pour – Very light yellow (nearly colorless), slight haze. Body – Light yellow, murky, opaque. Head – Large (Maximum eight cm, aggressive center pour), meringue-like, average duration, diminishing to a stable eight to ten mm undulating crown and thick complete cap. Lacing – None. Aroma – 4 – Coriander, yeast. Flavor – 4 – Flavors less distinct than the nose would indicate, but then this is past the BB date. Coriander predominates with less yeast phenols than expected. Slightly sweet. No alcohol (4.9% ABV) flavor or aroma, no diacetyl, no dimethylsulfide. Palate – 3.5 – Medium, slightly creamy, light carbonation. Final impression and summation: 4. A trip down memory lane for me – I first had Hoegaarden in a little café in Toronto before I ever joined BA. What was that waiter’s name? RALPH! Or something equally mundane. And, much as I liked it originally, I haven’t had it since joining BA until now. So, a decent Belgian Witbier, even though in the clutches of INBEV.

After that the beer over time become less awesome and seems lose very quickly the big carboration. The taste become more and more lighter but still the beer is ok and higher from average..

Also this beer has little more water than usual and i don't notice some great after taste.. Overall a great and cheap beer to drink in the summer..

83,248,FBarber,4.04,"Pours a cloudy bright straw colored yellow. Thin velvety white head with excellent retention. Surprisingly effervescent even through the haziness.  Aroma has notes of wheat, pepper, coriander, nutmeg and a hint of citrus.  Taste has notes of wheat, a hint of orange peel, coriander, spicy pepper towards the back end and through the finish. Very light, airy flavors. Flavors die off quickly on the palate.  Feel is light and drinkable. Spritzy carbonation.  A straightforward Belgian witbier that hits all the notes for that style quite well. Its a great beer and worth having if you like the style.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,augustgarage,3.99,"Poured from an 11.2oz bottle into my Hoegaarden tumbler.  Cloudy pear body with a fast-dissipating ivory crown; vague lacing; poor retention.  Floral/spice character from the coriander, and a touch of bitter-sweet tang in the nose. Faint sourness in the background. No real hop presence.  Light, vanilla-tinged grain character with a lingering citrus-kissed sweetness. Sort of watery mid-palate, with a brief vitamin note giving way to a floral, medium finish. Some yeast character, and a slight pucker from the wheat.  Soft, not-quite pillow-like mouth-feel - gently but fully carbonated.  Hate to support AB/In-Bev, but this is one of the style's progenitors with few superior examples available in my neighborhood.

Small bubbles arrive up from the bottom moderately.  Wheat, orange peel, banana, and coriander are the main notes in the aroma. Other notes of white pepper, clove, biscuit malt, and spices.

83,248,defunksta,4.02,"Pours a hazy lemony color with a light, but crispy white head. Smell: Aroma of spicy belgian yeast. Pepper, coriander, some orange. Followed by a biscuit malt and banana aroma. Taste: Strong flavors of belgian yeast, coriander and some lemon/orange citrus. Strong biscuit malt and banana flavors. A crisp, clean and dry finish. The flavor is so well balanced between the citrus, bread and banana sweetness, but with a yeasty, dry finish. Feel: Lighter bodied. Strongly carbonated and crisp.  Compared side by side to Ommegang's witbier: This one has more of a belgian yeast quality. More yeast, spice, coriander, banana. Less citrus overall. Less orange, but more of a lemon flavor. Similar light bodied and carbonated. Maybe slightly lighter bodied and less carbonated, but close nonetheless. I prefer Hoegaarden over Ommegang due to the nice representation of Belgian yeast flavors and spice.  Overall: An absolute delicious summertime brew. The coriander and belgian yeast complement each other perfectly into a dry finish.This is the gold-standard of the style. Well-balanced and deserves some serious respect.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

It has a slightly floral character and it is extremely mellow.  Mouthfeel: It is smooth and easy to drink.  Overall: It's an outstanding beer with a pleasant and gentle character.

The presentation of the wheat beer is much like any European beer. Very classic bottle and label. Not over done or underdone with the artwork. The nose on this beer is some-what like a typical ale. Nice aroma with just the slightest hint of oranges and faint Banana. The taste is dessert-like without a over sweetness. Right away, the top end is sweet with a classic ale front. As you take a drink, you get a balanced flavor of orange and spices along with some tart qualities. The malt seems to be underlying and more for the body. The finish is semi-dry so you'll go back for more. It ends with a nice coriander spice note. The feel is medium with border line creamy texture, super drinkable with smoothness.

It is refreshing, and has a mouth-feel somewhat higher than it's actual 4.9% ABV. O- The spice is over-dominant to me; I don't drink beer to get mouthfulls of coriander this intense. I remember when this beer seemingly first hit the scene back in the 90s, it was so fashionable and of course relatively expensive. I hadn't drunk it in years and TBH it seems OTT/unbalanced to me now; defintely lacking subtlety .

Interesting to say the least. Taste - Wow. Well-made product is immediately my first thought...extremely smooth for a wheat beer. A hint of banana. No fake orange flavor and spices aren't dominating, a very smooth tasty blend, no one flavor stands out, which is good i don't want to drink orange peel with coriander. Not too much carbonation. Very drinkable, it's not harsh in any way and it isn't too filling. A bit of malt backbone. Not too sweet.  Overall, just a tremendous beer.

Aromas of grass, apple, lemon, candy sugar, as well as pea-like suggestions common to many Belgian beers. Palate is even more Belgian, dissimilar to many American variations on the style, downplaying the fruit and sugar though still fair amounts of both, even some blueberry starting around the middle, but showcasing the wheat and yeast equally if not more so, again with the grasses and greens. A little tart throughout, rich and sweet and complex in the middle, acidic in the back just before a drier finish, barely detectable boozy pepper notes in retro-olfaction.

83,248,Mindcrime1000,3.94,"Poured from a single-serve bottle into a wheat tap glass  The look may be the paragon of the style. Beautiful hazy/milky pale gold, like wheat straw. A fine foamy/rocky head the gives way to persistent lacing throughout the quaff.  Ester and yeast/grain aromas very forward but not overwhelming, with a floral note, and a hint of sourness that provides balance.  The flavor is estery sweet at the front, well-rounded by grains and yeasts, and finishes extremely well with a touch of lemon sourness and excellent carbonation at the end.  The mouthfeel is maybe just a shade watery even for the style, but it is still an excellent feel with a fine crisp finish.  Overall, this may be regarded as a mass-produced shadow of its original self by some, but I still find it to be my favorite wit--clean, simple, pure, straightforward. No orange slice necessary. Highly recommended.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

83,248,Tohibii,3.65,"This is really quite respectable for a Macro-Brew. Main complaint is just the seltzer like mouthfeel, which is heavy handed and inelegant.

Aroma is very fresh and clean, light floral notes, but an inviting brew.  Taste is a touch too florally for me, coupled with a slight carbonate sensation, makes it a little difficult to enjoy. The alcohol content is fairly low, so perhaps a hit would do it some good?  The feel is pretty good, nice and smooth, and aftertaste is a little on the tart side.  Overall, just ok.

83,248,Pantalones,3.87,"Bottle #7 from the twelve-pack I randomly picked up when a local grocery store had it on clearance. The listed ""best before"" is a somewhat shockingly distant date of December 1st, 2018. Yep, that's 20*18*. I wouldn't have thought to age a witbier for two years, but after seeing that date I almost want to hold on to one or two just to see what happens.  The beer is a hazy golden color, with an abundance of rising bubbles and a nice layer of fluffy white foam on top. The haziness makes it look a bit darker in color than it actually is, though shining a flashlight through it reveals that it's actually pretty pale. At a thin point in the glass it really does look almost ""white"" with the light shining through it, or at least as close as a beer is ever going to look.  The smell is predominantly yeasty -- I described it as a banana-like thing when I first had it, but I'm not sure that's the best word for it now that I think about it. There's a yeasty funkiness and something like pears, and maybe something else mixed in that might be a little banana-like. Maybe a bit of a spiciness in the background, and a bit of a tart citrusiness back there too.  Taste is milder than the smell, which kinda surprises me -- I've had a lot of beers where it's the other way around. The wheaty malt is more present in the taste than the smell, however, and it's pretty nice. The yeastiness from the smell is also present in the taste, though not as strong. This is definitely a beer that benefits from being drank in large quantities -- I'm noticing that with a bigger gulp I get more of the yeasty flavors and I can taste that bit of citrus too. Toward the end of the glass I'm noticing a bit of a spicy/herbal thing -- I know witbiers generally include coriander, I'm guessing that's what this is?  Mouthfeel is really great -- it's light and drinkable, smooth-feeling rather than prickly despite the tons of rising bubbles making it seem like it's pretty highly carbonated. As mentioned above, this is a beer that benefits from being drank in big gulps rather than little sips, and the mouthfeel definitely helps out with that.  Overall, this is a really nice beer, especially for a hot day when you want something lighter and refreshing. My feelings toward it have shifted around a bit between the first bottle and the most recent -- I was feeling somewhat disappointed by it during some of those in-between bottles but for some reason it's really working for me today.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

I can see why people don't like it, however, I can understand why people love it. It's that kind of beer, it divides people, you either love it or hate it.

The bitter hops used in this taste, as put by BA user sjccmd, 'floral and grassy'. I find this a particularly accurate description. This is followed by tones of citrus and coriander. The feel is light-medium bodied, well carbonated, and crisp. My only one complaint is that I found it a tad cloying near the end.  This beer was refreshing on such a hot day. Probably wouldn't be the best choice in the colder seasons.

Coriander seems a bit stronger on the palate, but flavors do mingle well. Juicy and citrusy. A bit of lemon/lime soda...literally like Sprite. As I'm drinking this, I'm beginning to feel either my palate has changed, or this beer has lost some of its subtlety over the years.  Medium light body with medium carbonation. Crisp but with a decent oat slickness.  Again, my palate has likely changed over the years, but I remember this beer having a subtle hint of orange peel and coriander.

Taste is a refined combination of a scented (again, orange and coriander) wheated brew. Flavor and scent align in a subtle, almost ephemeral way. This one flits about on gossamer wings. Supporting these taste sensations is a tight, tart structure that's tasteful on it's own but heightened by the spicy citrus influence.

Not much of a day trade, to be sure, but they made me a ham and cheese sandwich (no lunch menu) that was the best I've had, and I drank my first Hoegaarden along with it! Years later, a Swedish woman I worked with took me to a pub in Stockholm where I had another Hoegaarden in a large, octagonal glass.

83,248,akdo,4.51,"Because I saw this beer on many list of top Belgian beers, I didn't mind buying a case of six bottles. Once I was home, I paired one bottle with an orange.  From the bottle came a pale golden beer with a head that stays on top for a while. If you follow the instructions on the bottle's label, gently shake your glass if the head starts to fade. The head will get a little bit of its vigor back. All in all, the beer has a nice visual identity.  Speaking about the taste, I initially took one sip without biting my orange. Because of the orange peels inside the Hoegaarden Original White Ale, the taste more or less like a lightly bitter homemade marmalade jam made with enough cups of sugar, a dashes of hops and some tweaks (coriander?), which is not a bad thing.  Once I kept a slice of orange meat as well as its juice in my mouth, I took another sip. The orange's juice merged with the beer and lightened the beer's bitterness. The orange juice did not overpower the beer in that the bitterness was not sacrificed. For a fleeting moment, I even was under the impression that the Hoegaarden came close to the taste of a dubbel, which is supposed to have a certain sweetness.  In short, to get the most out of the Hoegaarden, drink it with an orange. As for the pairing this beer with seafood, I will try it in the future.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,pat61,4.06,"It has a wonderful creamy head (that disappears quickly) and a pale, cloudy straw color. It’s almost white. They add coriander and Curacao orange peel to it but these flavors are very subtle as is the clove from the yeast. The flavors of the orange peel, coriander and the wheat malt are a little more independent in the Hoegaarden and not as balanced. Some of this separateness of flavor, lack of creaminess, and thinness may come from AB InBev’s use of high gravity brewing to make Hoegaarden.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

I wonder if it changes how it pours or the texture. The head is thin and quickly flows back down the sides. It says it is brewed with spices (coriander and orange peel), and there's just enough for a brightness without overpowering the wheat base. My favorite part of the beer is the smooth feel due to being unfiltered. I expected pulp but the cloudiness doesn't lower the drinking experience as I expected it might. It's a mere 4.9% but it carries a history from 1445 and it's authentically imported from its namesake, so I can respect it.

Appearance - Pours a hazy, golden yellow color with a one finger, soap bubble head that is retained for about a quarter of the drink. No lacing to speak of. Cool packaging, love the classic German/Belgian look. Little bit of carbonation coming from the bottom of the glass.  Smell - The nose is phenols, spices, a bit of orange peel, and some big wheats. Smells like a Continental European beer. Hopefully it tastes like one!  Taste - Exactly what I hoped for. Well balanced between the wheats, which come at the front of the drink, and just a touch of spice and bitterness in the back . In the meantime, there is a definite banana/phenol/orangepeel flavor in the middle. Very well balanced, quality.  Motuhfeel - Finishes clean, smooth, with a hint of funk.

83,248,UrbanCaveman,3.9,"11.2 oz bottle, poured into a tulip glass at approximately 45 degrees F.  A: Pours a pale straw, and is amazingly cloudy, to the point that I can scarcely see the shadow of my fingers on the opposite side of the glass. Formed an immense head of white foam, that quickly fell away to a ring and several patchy islands of cap. No lacing to speak of, alas.  S: Fruit and wheat spring out of the glass at first whiff, laden with nigh hefeweizen levels of banana and coriander spice. There's a tang of citrus underlying the primary aromas, and an overall sweetness that beckons to my hop-averse palate.  T: The flavor profile has a definite core of sweet wheat, around which the fruit and spice notes are wrapped. Citrus notes abound through the beer, ranging from orange to mandarin and clementine, and the spice tones include coriander and just a hint of clove. Tinges of white pepper waft through the background, and a faint whisper of banana skulks about the shadows of the ester flavors.  M: Rather thin and watery, moreso than expected for the level of cloudiness in the glass. While I'd expect most any wheat beer to be light-bodied, this beer lends itself to a quick flash of flavor across the palate, and then a lingering watery aftertime.  O: For a witbier available at my local grocery store for a reasonable price, this is quite tasty. A little more strength in the body, and I'd call it a regular.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,SmashPants,3.54,Bottle: a standard 330mL brown bottle with a stylish macro label.  Appearance: pours out a strong cloudy yellow with a half-inch of white head that drops to a thin cap. Plenty of lacing down the side of the glass.  Aroma: some citrus and spices accompanying Belgian yeast and light wheat.  Taste: pretty much follows the nose - a decent macro-orientated Belgian witbier. Citrus and wheat take the fore here.  Aftertaste: the wheat and yeast last the distance beyond the citrus and spice.  Mouth feel: lighter to moderate in feel with a moderate carbonation. A touch dry on the finish.  Overall: a decent and very drinkable Belgian macro witbier. A reasonable price at AU$58 a case of 24 x 330mL also. I'll definitely have it as funds permit.,Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Aroma: A strong wheat/citrus smell with just a bare hint of cloves on the back end.  Taste: Definitely a wheat beer with strong citrus tones and a nice, solid, yeasty crisp aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Creamy and even sultry, with a little carbonation on the tongue. Medium body.  Overall: I felt compelled to try this after a reviewer on this site claimed that once you've had one, you never go back. well, that might be overstating the case, but this beer is not bad. I really like Franziskaner, and therefore I think I admire the yeastiness of this one too. I am not sorry I bought it.

The smell is classic of the style with Belgian yeast, coriander and orange zest on top, plus some more spices in the background. Tastes of orange juice, coriander, white bread, hints of white pepper. The mouthfeel is smooth and a bit sirupy, with a light to medium body. The sweetness is balanced as it dries up and some kind of tartness builds along the sip.  An ok beer that i will have again if nothing better available. It was beautiful in the hot and humid Singapore back in the days for example, when it was this or Tiger beer. Not near as exciting as St. Bernardus, Blanche de Namur or Blanche de Bruxelles, which remain on top of the style in my opinion, but yet tasty and refreshing.

Some malt notes of white loaf in the background. Orange is subtle and melds nicely in with the other aromas.  S - The fruitiness is pronounced, and just not too dominating. Taking some air with a sip the coriander comes through more. Finish is dry, which balances nicely up against the sweetness of the fruity esters.  M - Light body, with a smooth creaminess. Medium high carbonation. Suits the beer well.  O - A nice wit. I like the use of coriander and orange peel, which is perfectly blended into the rest of the beer.

I will start this review off by saying if you have not tried Hoegaarden, make it a point to buy some as soon as possible.  Appearance (4.5) : A tall pillar of foamy and creamy head that stays with the beer as you drink it. It's about four fingers tall and when it eventually recedes it leaves nice webbing and rings around the glass. The body is pineapple colored with a 30% opacity leaving bubbles lining the glass with sediment settling at the bottom.  Smell (4.5) : Sweet orange slice and orange spice, harvest wheat, coriander, morning dew. A ton of character and very pleasing to the olfactory.  Taste (4.25) : As I said, this is the king of Witbiers. It has a creaminess and fullness that rivals porters, yet drinks like pineapple juice. The taste is of harvest wheat, fresh orange slice, herbs, and various citrus elements (lemon, lime, tangerine). Creamy and simple with no bitterness.  Mouthfeel (4.75) : A floating, creamy mouthfeel with a medium to full bodied texture. It's truly luxurious. Mildly carbonated which keeps everything balanced.  Overall (4.5) : Hoegaarden is one of those simple pleasures in life that cannot fully be explained in words. It's a Belgian beer and man do I love those Belgians.

Belgian witbiers are poured in a manner identical to German ""hefe"" (i.e., yeast) beers. You pour three-fourths of the bottle normally, swirl the last fourth to activate the yeast and stimulate CO2 production, then dump it in the glass to produce a nice head. Works for me.  S: OK. There's not that much going here, but that's to be expected given the zero hop characteristic and light malts (wheat and Vienna malts). Slight banana and orange-peel smells apparent.  T: Lovely. Perfect for a nice summer day. Light tastes: banana, orange, bready Belgian yeast, coriander, white pepper and light spices. Good protein content, too, given the yeasty presence.  M: Nice and bready, like all Belgian bottle-conditioned beers. Thick mouthfeel owing to the presence of Belgian yeast and excess proteins.

83,248,taxandbeerguy,3.81,"330 ml bottle served cold into a pint glass. Purchased as part of a six pack from LCBO for $13.75 CDN.  Appearance - Pale weak yellow color, with a few orange hues. Exteremely hazy and a nice 2 finger head is poured, subsiding down to a half finger of foam before beginning a glacial descent from there into wispy strands of foam. Beer is semi-transparent in the narrowest regions of the glass.  Smell - Very bready aroma with some coriander and light orange citrus smell. Some of that Belgian funky yeast smell and overall rather on the sweet smelling side.  Taste - The Orange and coriander shine through here more and the funkiness from the yeast is not nearly as prevalent as it was in the nose. On the sweet side but not overpowering, it actually smells sweet than it tastes. No booze is perceptible either.  Mouthfeel - Medium to light bodied, with moderately low carbonation. Keeps the mouth fairly coated, but again because the beer is not too sweet it is not cloying. very refreshing on a hot summer's day or even a temperate spring one.

The smell is a very light coriander lemon combination with a bit of sweet orange  The taste is a very crisp wheat flavor. I've heard some say they think it has a banana flavor to it but I believe there is a more citrus flavor to this beer.  This light thin beer is very drinkable but has a very high level of carbonation that make you sip it.  I've had this in bottles and on tap and would highly recommend it.,Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

It pours a light but hazy yellow with a nice white head. The smell is full of citrus and Belgian wheat. The taste is light with a bunch of citrus flavors like lemon, orange peel, and a hint of banana that add to the wheat flavor and give it a nice crisp finish. The mouthfeel is the only problem for me as it was a little too light for the winter but I can see this being a staple of the summer.

Pours a hazy golden 'lemon' in color with a about a 3-finger white foamy head that stays around for a while before settling down to about 4-5mm. Some sediment is seen in the bottom of the bottle after the pour. A decent amount of lacing is seen with each sip. The aroma is of wheat, grains, lemon with orange peel and spice. The taste is about the same with the mix of orange and lemon zest coming through first with some spice for the finish. Semi-sweet also. Medium-bodied with perfect carbonation.

Soft coriander, wheat, lemon, and orange peel dominate the aroma. There's a grainy sweetness accompanying subtle floral hops.  Lemon, tangerine, wheat, and coriander open the flavor profile, becoming bready mid palate, and finishing with a hint of pepper. Orange zest and banana esters add complexity in the aftertaste.  Body is fairly full and creamy, with carbonation a touch low.  Great yeast esters, with more malt body than I recall. Not my favorite style, and the skunky notes are slightly offputting.

83,248,Beric,3.88,"Serving: Bottle, from the bottle Served: 5 January 2014  Appearance: Unfortunately had this one out of the bottle due to no glassware being available. Bottle looked good though. Lighter brown glass allows you to see the haziness in the beer from the suspended yeast as well as the head. I tried to drink this one pretty violently at first to stir up the yeast in the glass and it worked out okay, but almost volcanoed out of the top. Definitely going to use a glass next time I have this one.  Smell: Smells of banana. Not picking up any notes from the coriander or orange it says its brewed with. Smells a lot like a hefeweizen.  Taste: Tastes much like a hefeweizen (banana tastes) but with a little more edge.  Mouthfeel: Good carbonation and very refreshing mouthfeel.  Overall: I could drink this one by the gallon. Good, assertive taste from the wheat and yeast without being overly spiced like some wits. My favorite wit that I've had so far. Would make an excellent summer beer.

83,248,CalgaryFMC,3.5,"Had on tap for the purpose of this review. This was a grad school staple however and I am quite familiar with this classic witbier in the bottle as well. A hazy banana yellow beer with a decent amount of white head and ample carbonation, Hoegaarden smells of fruity yeast esters first and foremost, along with some dry bread and phenolic spice notes like allspice or dilute clove. I remember this beer being hugely fruity and fairly sour as well, less spicy, and my memory was indeed pretty accurate. A little dry popcorn malt and lots of bubble gum/tutti fruity esters along with some banana, the spicy phenols take a back seat but there is a sour backdrop that evokes a little raw pineapple or maybe unripe apples or pears that prevents the sweetness from being cloying. The coriander spice shows up in the finish along with a pleasant lemony sourness but is fairly downplayed, to the betterment of the beer itself (drink this and then try a Rickards White or another mainstream US or Canadian wit and you'll see what I mean ... The Europeans use this spice more strategically and do not carpet bomb the taste buds). Mouthfeel is a bit chewy and there is some residual sweetness but the body is still fairly thin and watery, I guess its a witbier after all. If there is a standout flaw, said flaw is too much carbonation that masks the fruit and spice flavors more than is necessary. Still, any wit fan should know this icon.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

S = bready yeasts, coriander, wheat, a touch of banana and cloves, citrus  T = floral and spicy, peppery, crisp... there is a lingering sour note that is rather pleasant. not as sweet as some other wits I've had, but the spice and floral character is awesome in my opinion  M = medium carbonation accents the spiciness of this beer well, and there is a creaminess to the mouthfeel.

A little bit floral and a little bit spicey.  Taste: Aside from the wheat and coriander flavors, there's quite a bit of lemon and pepper. There isn't much as far as complexity, but it's a clean taste with a pretty good balance between the wheat, citrus, and spice.  Mouthfeel: Very thin but somehow just creamy enough to not taste too thin. The carbonation is quite high, complimenting the pepper flavor in the taste with its crispness. This goes down very, very easy, making it a safe choice for a summer day.  Overall: It's hard to complain about this since it is often considered to be the standard witiber, although it's certainly not the best. It's a refreshing beer with good flavor, but it's also not that interesting either.

It pours yellow-white with a really large amount of head - the standard sort of thing for wheat beers. It smells quite predominantly of orange and coriander as they advertise. The citrus thing just is not really what I enjoy in a beer, but it does smell a lot better than other crappy white beers I've had. The taste is citrusy and almost resembles a cream ale in terms of texture. It's definitely got some body to it and is definately a sippin' beer.

In my tasting notes I contrasted the bitterness that stays behind with the orange peel produced bitterness against a hop-produced bitterness. Orange peel bitterness is a great pairing with the coriander spiciness and it doesn't stick to your tongue like a hop bitterness does.

83,248,VictorWisc,4.05,"I bought two 12packs of Long Trail Belgian White (LT) and Hoegaarden Wit (HW) and have been doing side-by-side and successive comparisons over the past several days. The result is a review that contrasts the two of them that I'll try to post under both (with the numbers being different, of course) until someone smacks me down for doing that.  Both beers claim to be made in the tradition of Belgian witbiers, with similar spicing and process. Hoegaarden is basically the prototype for the category, albeit clearly not the best one. LT states it is ""modeled after the original Belgian Witbiers brewed in monasteries"". As such, it is not a very good model.  Both beers were sampled from 12 oz bottles (HW is actually a slightly smaller 11.25 oz). Each day they were poured in different glassware, although both were poured in identical glasses on the same day. They were given the same amount of refrigeration as well.  HW pours cloudy with no through visibility. Head is white. substantial in some glasses, moderate in others, gradually reducing to a thin layer. Carbonation is moderate. Color is pale yellow, that of a long-whipped egg yolk, which the liquid resembles in appearance.  LT is cloudy, but less so, with very moderate and quickly disappearing head and slight but noticeable carbonation. Color is darker yellow, closer to commercial apple juice.  Both claim to have been brewed with orange peel (from a variety of oranges) and coriander, but the nose and flavor could not be more different.  HW has a characteristic winey yeast odor of a Belgian ale, with a faint coriander aroma along with some sweet citrus. LT has faint yeast smell with strong coriander overtone. If there are any hops present, they are not noticeable in either glass. There is some faint smell of roasted grain in LT.  Taste is radically different. Hoegaarden continues with the strong yeasty flavor, supplemented by malted and roasted grain, with notes of coriander, cloves and sweet orange, gradually transforming into a sweet Dutch licorice finish that lingers for a few minutes but eventually dissipates.  LT has an overwhelming coriander flavor, with sour, but not citrusy yeast notes and some roasted wheat undertone which quickly turns sour in the mouth. The sourness lingers for a while, even after a moderate consumption. Using sugary beverages to get rid of it did not help -- the sourness persisted even after a glass of Coke. A glass of water did eliminate the aftertaste, but it required some effort.  HW is better balanced, with no alcohol feel in the mouth. Although lacking balanced flavor, LT does not taste overly alcoholic, but there is more alcohol feel in it. Both are light and, under the right circumstances, refreshing. With right foods (e.g., Thai and Indonesian curries and Indian food that is not overly saucy) LT can be a very serviceable beer, but the strong coriander flavor and odor make it unsuitable for most occasions, including everyday drinking. HW is a perfectly reasonable everyday pour, especially in the summer. Original or not, it likely would not survive a comparison to some of the better American varieties, such as Allagash, but it can certainly hold its own. Long Trail, on the other hand, has a long learning curve ahead of it as a brewery. Even their best products (pale ale and IPA) seem to offer only a single taste note, where competitors offer a bouquet of flavors and aromas. Hoegaarden does pretty much only one thing but it does it rather well.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Most appealing component of this beer. T: Honey, spices, banana, yeast. Some roasted wheat appears shyly in the background. Well balanced. M: Light body and profound carbonation.

The head had a moderately good level of retention, fading over time to give decent lacing on the sides of the glass.  Smell – The aroma is heaviest of wheat and citrus with the citrus being of lemon and grapefruit. Mixed with these aromas are some lighter spicier aromas of a coriander and some lemongrass, producing overall a classic wit aroma  Taste –The taste begins with a wheaty and lemon flavor upfront. The taste sweetens quickly as flavors of tangerine and banana come to the tongue. Along with these sweeter flavors, so to comes a light spice flavor of coriander. These tastes take the taste to its end, leaving a sweet citrus flavor of orange and sweet white grapefruit as well as some wheat flavor to linger on the tongue.  Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is on the slightly lighter side with a carbonation level that is a tad on the higher side. The overall feel is rather nice of the style as it makes it quite easy to drink and suits the sweeter and citrus flavors quite well.  Overall – Quite an easy drinking and refreshing wheat and sweet citrus brew.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

When it comes to the taste the spices come out in the front with the citrus moving to the background, a background well framed in by the wheat. Also perceivable is some yeast character but overall everything is a bit overshadowed by the coriander spiciness. The mouthfeel is acceptable with high levels of carbonation combined with a light body however I would have preferred it to be a bit crisper with a cleaner finish.

83,248,dougbassett,3.88,"One of the ""1001 Beers You Must Taste Before You Die"" -- #22 of the ones I've reviewed here.  I think it's neat that beer in America has gotten to the point where something like Hoegaarden is reasonably available, at least in cities. Heck, I know a strip bar that carries this, and they sell a fair amount of it, too.  Looks fantastic, just like this style should, a very pale yellow with a resistant head. Nose is light but evocative, sweet orange juice and spice. ""The flavors are actually, I think, quite complex, the hops and spice are more into play and while there's still citrus, we've shifted to lemon peel/lemon oil. Finish is sort of a gentle wash of hops that is quietly assertive without getting out of hand, if that makes any sense at all.  I like this beer -- particularly in warm weather it's very nice indeed. As is often the case I could stand for the mouthfeel to be more assertive, to provide a better foundation for the flavors -- it's a little too light, I think, for my taste. But all in all a classic that deserves it's standing.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Thin in the mouth, but bubbly somehow. I was really thirsty, and this beer hit the spot. I loved it so much, I decided to brew my own version of it!

A dab of banana and clove, maybe, but maybe I'm just imagining it due to what's typical for this style of beer. Strike the banana.  M - Pretty light, kind of a soapy feeling (but not taste, that would be bad). Bit of an odd aftertaste, but it's coriander-related, whatever it is.  O - This seems like a love-it-or-hate-it.

A: Cloudy, pale yellow/white which fades into a lingering head when poured. S: While typically served with a lemon (or orange) slice in some locations when it's on draught, banana can sometimes be more prominent. Near total lack of hops helps bring out the fruity, almost ""smoothie"" scents. T: Hints of several spices, but not as prominently as comparable Witbiers (particularly domestics). Easily paired with most foods as the palate isn't overpowered. Try it with hummus that's received a light squeeze of lemon juice for an interesting appetizer. M: Smooth but not especially crisp, however it breaks down if held on the tongue for too long. O: The beer that will convince almost anyone who ""hates beer"" that there's more than light beers and IPAs to choose from. A good summer beer best enjoyed neither too cold nor too warm.

The coriander and citrus are dominant but the orange flavored citrus comes through more on the taste then in the aroma. Bready malts and little hop flavor or bitterness make for a mildly sweet beer but not cloyingly sweet. Aftertaste is not very pleasant however but is not to noticeable.  M: Easy and crisp drinking with the aid of the high carbonation. The after taste is a bit annoying however.  O: I bought a six pack a while ago when I was first experimenting with new beers. This is a pretty decent macro honestly. A bit bland but fairly sessionable and ,imo, better than some of the other belgian whit macros like Shocktop and Rickards white.

83,248,falloutsnow,3.63,"From: Binny's, Champaign, IL Date: Best by 06/10/2013 Glass: New Belgium globe glass  Hoegaarden is unquestionably refreshing and enjoyable, and its aroma and taste are just below the threshold where a bit more presence from each would bring this to a much higher plane. That being said, this is a reliable, perpetually available, and affordable witbier to enjoy when desired.  Pours a substantial 3cm tall head of clean, white bubbles that are medium to small in size, creating a mass of foam that is a bit spongy-looking. Retention is above average, lasting over two minutes in its decline to a 0.5cm cap atop the body of the beer. Lacing is present, but minimal, a few thick blobs and splotches scattered across the insides of the glass. Body is an opaque, cold yellow hue, with light bringing out a very pale, cloudy yellow color. Carbonation is visible streaming along the sides of the glass, apparently numerous and modestly active.  Yeast, lemon citrus with faint tartness, coriander, and a mild herb potpurri. Altogether good, but somewhat wilting: could be bolder and benefit.  Front of palate is sweet with wheat malt flavor, citrus peel, coriander, and faint banana ester. Mid-palate has stronger citrus (lemon) peel flavor, coriander, creamy wheat malt sweetness, faint bitterness. Back of palate picks up sweet wheat-focused malts, coriander, and banana ester. Aftertaste of yeast, banana ester, faint citrus peel, coriander, and a wheat-centered malt base.  Beer is medium-light in body, with plentiful, but soft carbonation that results in a soft, foamy mouthfeel that is quite enjoyable. Closes semi-dry, with light stickiness lingering across the palate.

Poured into a straight pint glass - the closest thing I've got to the chunky Hoegaarden glass. Swirled to resuspend the yeast. A very hazy pale straw colour with low carbonation. Yields a massive head of creamy white foam that lasts for a while before subsiding to a surface layer. Aroma of light, grainy malt with notes of banana, coriander, orange peel, faint clove, earthy yeast esters and mild spice. Nicely balanced - it smells great.  Tastes of yeast esters with a subtle fruity/spicy character and a dry finish. Notes of banana, coriander, spice, orange peel, mild clove, earthy yeast and light malt. Slightly sweet. A mild finish upon swallowing - no bitterness to speak of. Mouthfeel is smooth, light and tingly, with faint spiciness and good body for the style. Undercarbonated and rather flat; I was hoping this would be spritzier. Slightly astringent, with an aftertaste of fruity yeast esters and spice.  Nice - a decent Belgian wit that I find to be highly drinkable. It looks good, and the aroma/flavour have well-judged notes of fruit and spice. Was expecting higher carbonation, but this is a fairly trivial point. It is possible that Hoegaarden has become somewhat muted through AB-Inbev ownership, but it still comes across as well crafted.

Wispy white head forms and quickly dissipates into nothing but a small ring around the edge of the beer. Smell hits first with apple skins, wheat, peppery notes, VERY slight kitchen spices (oregano?), pears, lemons, and some earthy notes. The taste follows through with a heavy clove and banana taste which surprisingly went nearly undetected on the nose. The pepper is noticeable all the way through, and it finishes with some apple skins, lemon zest, and wheat. A bit watery and very light on the body. Lots of carbonation, with a refreshing, crisp finish.  Decent witbier, refreshing and easy on the palate, this is something that would be very sessionable.

Taste-a nice crisp wheat taste to begin with a very smooth middle that was quite satisfying, you get a small, light bit of orange and malt on the end into a very subtle aftertaste.  mouthfeel-tasted a little flat on the carbonation (probably due to the fact that that it was not a chilled glass) overall very full giving off the different types of flavors as it moves through the mouth and throat.  overall-very nice beer, extremely satisfied considering the price (paid about $8.50 for a six-pack)",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

T - Follows the nose with equal balance, too much so such that no flavor really grabs your attention. More spice than I anticipated which adds some nice character.

Little hop flavours, not very bitter, a small sour note, very fresh, a little bit spicey, but really just a tiny bit.  M: Very nice carbonation, thick and creamy mouthfeel.  O: A beautiful widely available Witbier, lacks some characteristics of the style, although very balanced taste which makes it very refreshing on a hot day.

Pours a hazy pale gold with tons of lively carbonation. Head is a huge, 4-finger, frothing white mass. Head stays intact to nearly the bottom of the glass, leaves behind a few blotches of lacing.  S - A generous amount of wheat malt and musty yeast with a dose of orange peel and coriander. The spices come out even more in the glass. Very inviting.  T - A little bit of wheat and almost watery upfront. The body has some light wheat malt notes mixed in with slightly sour yeast and lemony hops. Orange peel and coriander spices round out the flavor profile. A flash of yeast flavor as the beer passes over the pack of the tongue leads to a slightly sour and musty orange finish.  M - Very thin bodied and with plenty of carbonation. Could stand to be thicker and maybe more carbonated.  Finally picked this up to complete a 6-pack in San Diego. Although this is probably the quintessential benchmark of the style, I feel many U.S. brewers have passed them up. Although the appearance and nose are pretty well nailed on this brew, the flavor was marginal at best. At times I was vividly reminded of those Emergen-C powder packets that you mix with water.

It just does the bare minimum of what witbiers are supposed to do. There's some light coriander here, maybe a trace amount of white pepper. The citrus presents itself not so much like orange zest as it does lemon zest. There's light crackery malt too. It's pretty average for the style, and I don't mean that negatively. You can say the same things about Hoegaarden's flavor profile. It's very light and refreshing and not particularly impressive.

The wheat is gentle in the nose, a drying supplement to the base of orange and lemon citrus, caraway, coriander, cinnamon and dried yeasts and baking dough, apricots and pears underneath, bare whiff of banana without impairing cleanliness, subtly steady length. Medium-bodied, semi-sluggish and apt to just plop down on the tongue, even allowing for a slight prickle from the carbonation. The anise, coriander, cumin spice supplemented by vanilla bean, these elements contribute to a sweetness throughout that lemon, orange citrus. Peach and apricot pulp, maybe melon or apple too.

I can believe it now as I have a foggy yellow glass, chilled yet I still think the bartender got this from a guy who visited the mens room while a bit dehydrated. The head is a pure white, like the clouds that takes a bit of time to dissipate. The flavor is smooth yet overwhelming. I taste sausage, sausage, and more sausage. Now that you mention it I have not had a traditional European breakfast for an extended period that very much out stretches the length of my own sausage. Its almost salty, which is not a bad thing, but very much would go with my garlic seasoned sunny side up eggs. And perhaps a piece of the toast, with the real butter from next door and not the grocery. There is a medium carbonation, and the lace is still apparent. It would be much more pleasurable if it was the morning, as it should be waiting for me whenever I roll out of bed.

Smell: Love the smell of this beer. Similar to something like Blue Moon, but more subtle. The orange and coriander aromas are the underlying smells, but you also get the wheat smell with a hint of lemon and other citrus smells.  Taste: The first taste that hits you is the orange. Nothing overwhelming, though, which was a nice surprise with a witbier. Throughout the taste, you get to taste the wheat, hints of lemon, and then all of a sudden you get a great grassy taste to finish it off.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth, coats your mouth nicely if that's what you're looking for. It's got some carbonation that is definitely noticeable, but that didn't ruin it for me. Leaves you very satisfied.

It's watery, bitter, fizzy and reminds me a lot of Alka-Seltzer, or at best an unpleasant ice cream soda. Incredibly ill-balanced and no depth of character. Leaves a sour, yeasty flavour on my palate - not the hallmark of a good beer.  O: I try not to talk dirty of beers I don't like but I'm not exactly kicking a dead puppy by scorning this multi award winning macro travesty.

83,248,BerkeleyBeerMan,3.9,"The brain child of one Pierra Celis, innovator of the witbier revival. This truly is the original 20th century witbier even though the style began in the 15th century. Unfortunately Celis and his purchaser InBev had a falling out and though this beer may be less craft belgian it still maintains predominance in the global beer market.  The appearance is good. Hoegaarden pours a cloudy golden straw (100% unfiltered and mainly wheat malt). The head is thin creamy ivory white but too delicate to last and produce belgian lace. That's okay as this beer really is a hot weather refresher. Mild champagne bubbles keep the head afloat for nearly 15 minutes.  The aroma is of moderately funky barnyard wheat malt. Grainy and sour wheat interacts with Belgian yeast to back a bouquet of esters, lemon and definitely orange curucao rind. I don't detect coriander but I am not familiar enough with the spice's aroma. The hop profile is of delicate floral and fine perfume.  I taste a sour light creamy beer with faint dry grain texture. The fruit additions are the main player. Bitter orange rind and a light citric lemon bite gushing in my mouth. Distant white champagne grapes emerge in the back of my tongue.  The mouthfeel is light and delicate with a slight grainy coarseness the balance is nice but sacrifices hop character.  A good example of the witbier style but I plan on exploring more audacious offerings in the style as well as modern classics like St. Bernardus which has brewmaster Celis as an advisor.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

83,248,KimenTshom,3.49,"The first time I ever had Hoegaarden was while the band I sang for was on tour in Europe. We were added at the last minute to a music festival in Belgium, and our compensation was all the beer we could drink at the beer tent. Luckily we played first, leaving the entire rest of the festival for us to drink and drink and drink and... you get the picture. At the time (some time in the early '00's), Hoegaarden was a revelation. I had never had a witbier before. That, coupled with the unique setting in which I first tried it, created an almost mystical aura around this beer for me. I had it again a few years later in a small pub in Oxford, England and again was quite taken with it.  Unfortunately, since those experiences my affection for Hoegaarden has steadily deteriorated. I don't know if it is due to loss of character and flavor because of the transport from Belgium to the U.S. or because I have now had several other excellent witbiers. Regardless, Hoegaarden no longer impresses me the same way. Sure, it still stands as the hallmark of the style and I'm not sure I've ever seen such a beautiful, pale white glow in any other beer... but now when I drink it the beer seems to be too watery and thin and the unique flavors seem to be far too muted.

83,248,StonedTrippin,3.85,"everyone tries to copy this white ale, but it still stands distinctly alone as the original for me. cloudy and citrusy smelling, with a big pillowy head. has notes of spice and orange cream as well as a mellow floral hop profile. lighter body makes it a really easy session, but only when its super cold. i find this one gets a little bitter and funky yeasty when it warms up, so best to guzzle it down well its still chilly. too expensive for what it is, but a great white!",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,frankiepop,4.5,"I compared this beer straight up with the American Ommegang White Beer and France's Amadeus. Hoegaarden is an attractiive cloudy beer. The aroma of white beers are rather irrelevant to me so let's talk taste.  The taste is a wondrous mixture of lemon, orange & spices. Amadeus is less sweet & a little drier with slightly more spices. The lower carbonation adds a little smoothness and chance for more taste that the Hoegaarden.  The Ommegang is one American brewery that completely mastered the Belgian experience, & Ommegang's white beer is no exception. It's a wonderful white that is very similar to Hoegaarden. Ifind a little more sour tartness that really reminds me more of a lemony after taste than Hoegaarden.  Hoegaarden goes down with they best though. I recommend a Keith Jarrett solo piano recording: I would go with Koln or Lusanne-Bremen releases.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

It was a hazy pale straw yellow and a bit watery at the edges. A small bubbled thick foamy head crowned the top. My wife said it looks like meringue which seems appropriate given the lemony color of the beer and the citrus notes. Not a lot of lacing and the foam receded to a thin blanket.  The fragrances were as expected; citrus rinds, orange peel, spices lead by coriander.  The flavors were herbaceous, slightly spicy led by the coriander and maybe hints of nutmeg, Citrus rind was bright and up front.  In the mouth it was crisp, refreshing and cleansing.

83,248,mrfrancis,4.13,"A: Pours a hazy yellow with frosty white highlights and a creamy white mousse. Though the head retention could be better, Hoegaarden's appearance is unique among witbiers.  S: Gentle on the nose with aromas of orange, lemon, wheat, cream, and pepper. The spiciness is noticeable, but not over-the-top.  T: More complex than I initially expected. Notes of cream, vanilla, wheat toast, orange peel, coriander, banana, and white peppercorn swirl across the palate. I also detected faint traces of nutmeg and clove, though the beer does not contain these spices. The finish is spicy and quenching with notes of pepper, coriander, and orange peel.  M: This is my only real complaint with this beer. Light bodied, dry, and gently carbonated, it comes off as being a bit watery. It's not awful, but it needs a little more heft.  O: Though the quality of the bottled product can be variable, I still think Hoegaarden is an excellent Belgian witbier. I've been drinking it for several years and have not been able to detect the so-called loss of character that other reviewers have claimed to notice.

T - The yeast dominate the taste, but with less distinct notes. Banana, faint citrus and a crisp wheat bite. Extremely watery on the climax through finish, though, which is a bit disappointing.

S: There's nothing strong about the aroma, but citrus is primary, with wheat and spicy notes.  T: The taste is not potent; even for a witbier it's pretty light in flavor. Mild, sweet malt and grassy wheat are the first flavors, followed by pepper and tartness. Bitterness is an afterthought.  M: Very light on the carbonation, but with a little crispness.

Coriander that is well rounded - herbal with just a touch of pepper and a soft lemony aspect. Pretty good amount of yeasty spiciness. Sweet and grainy wheat – just a hint bready.  T: Coriander is herbal mostly with just a touch of lemon. Orange is floral / fruity without hardly any rindy bitterness. Orange and coriander are very nicely balanced. Whole package has a soft flowery, even sweet, aspect to it that blends in great with the doughy, sweet wheat base. Softly spicy yeast phenolic note in background, but quite clean with minimal actual yeast flavor. Perhaps a ghost hint of leafy / herbal hops at the end.  M: A bit under medium body with soft , creamy, finely-textured carbonation. Very soft and smooth mouthfeel while still being notably refreshing.

83,248,Pintofbrown,4,"App- This beer is a pale straw yellow, with a very airy one and a half finger head. It is an almost unbelievable white, only some lace as it degrades.  Smell- Tons of clove, coriander and some sweet musty fruit notes are present in the nose. It is pretty good, and definitely makes one think of a witbier.  Taste- It is a light drink when it comes to flavor. Not as pronounced as the nose, although most smells are now in the glass. There is certainly the clove and maybe a little of the coriander. It is citrusier in the drink, maybe some orange in the finish, and there is wheat there too. It could have been bigger, but still not bad all the same.  Mouth feel- It is borderline light in the mouth. The carbonation keeps it this way. The finish is just a little dry, but not too bad. I was honestly expecting it to be more medium bodied, but how it is does fit better than I would have thought.  Overall- Witbiers aren’t my favorite style, and this one certainly is subdued. It smells great, as most Belgians do, but it doesn’t transfer to the taste very well. Would I get it again? Maybe, but I think I will be more inclined to try more witbiers from here on out.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

The aroma is of orange and coriander, mostly.  Tastes the same...slight malt underneath the yeast, orange, and spices (coriander/clove). Somewhat herbal hops are quite muted, not bitter at all. Just a bit watery and will likely seem a tad bland to the experienced drinker. The yeasty notes don't pop as much as I'd like them to.  As I said before, highly drinkable, sessionable even.

The aroma is particularly spicy, leaning towards the peppery side (I really wish I had coriander laying around so I could see what that smells like) with a pronounced citrus smell that smells more of lemons than of oranges. A crisp wheat and yeasty twang is also apparent. The taste is very zesty and sweet at first, with a profound lemony tartness, before fading into a nicer malty blanket that smoothes everything out. Some very faint herbal hops way in the background. The added wheat is very pronounced, but the malt complements it nicely and adds to a solid body that's not too heavy. Spritzy carbonation adds to the fantastic crispness. Lasting wheat finish that's a little dry.  My –and a lot of other people's, I'm sure– go-to witbier.

And just at the edge is something I can only describe as smelling like a cherry Jolly Rancher.  On the tongue, the coriander and orange peel are heavily present, and those flavors continue into the back of the throat as the beer is swallowed. Other spices seem present in the beer as well, though subtly so and in a melange that makes them difficult to pick out individually; they're present as the result of the fermentation/brewing process, and not because other flavors were externally introduced. The malt contains light Grape Nuts cereal flavors, mixed in with an equally light layer of flowery, bitter hops.

Minimal frothy white head that leaves trace amounts of lacing clinging to the inside of the glass. Smell has a prevalent amount of citrus notes, along with hints of coriander and other spices. Definite wheat component to it as well, along with an almost palpable breadiness in the nose. Mild and sweet malt notes round out the end.  Taste has the same essences as in the nose, just a little bit more subdued, which is both surprising and a little disappointing. I guess I was expecting a certain level of robustness and I didn't get it. Still, there are notes of citrus and spice to provide the major components of flavor, along with a twangy, slightly sweet wheatiness. A little bit of an acidic kick in the finish. Mouthfeel is pleasing, with a reasonably medium body and a finish that leans a bit to the dry side, but not all the way. Some zingy carbonation provides a bit of a tart pop at the end.

83,248,doktorhops,3.74,"Okay so as we all know by now that according to my personal opinion a beer (or anything for that matter) shouldn't be called ""original"" unless it is, well finally today I'm tasting a beer that IS the original of its style; Hoegaarden [sic] original white ale!  Poured from a 330ml bottle into a ""chalice"" type wine glass (yes I cleaned the glass well).  A: Well first off it looks pleasing with a cloudy yellow/gold body, like pineapple juice, and a bone white dense 1cm head that dissolves to a thin lacing.  S: Coriander and orange peel make an interesting addition to a brew that has some classic wheat beer aromas (cloves, banana, sourdough). There is a hint of sweetness like honey in there as well, however this is a background aroma.  T: This is where Hoegaarden really wins me over; spice & pepper flavours in the foreground overlay a bold grain character with fructose and sourdough back-notes... it has changed though... its definitely been watered down to some extent compared to how it used to taste... not sure when it happened but I suspect it had something to do with the recent price drop as I've had it before (late May '11 in fact) and it was much bolder in the flavour department.  M: Not as rich and creamy as a traditional wheat beer. Medium bodied, light Champagne frizzante with that oppressive wateriness reminding me of its former glory.  D: Still very drinkable however I am disappointed by whatever has happened with this fine ale. Given the choice I would easily pay extra to get back the flavour intensity it previously had. Oh well, c'est la vie!  Food match: I'm gonna put it out there; grilled salmon with a light salad and a fried potato cake... thats right.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Thick, foamy, white head with excellent retention and nice lacing.  S: Strong aroma of grassy wheat, doughy yeast, banana and white pepper.  T: Wheaty yeast with a cane sugar sweetness up front, yielding to a peppery finish.  M: Just a tad on the watery side, but a very pleasant finish that gives you spice and carbonation without drying the mouth.  O: A very good witbier.

Hard to evaluate the appearance of a beer in a plastic cup, but it looked run of the mill pale orange with some cloudiness and a decent head. Lemony smell was evident. Beer was crisp and very drinkable with powerful lemony/citrusy flavor for a white beer.

Wheat lightens it up a bit and the lemon gives it a little kick. The candy like sweetness I was picking up in the nose is almost completely absent. Almost the complete opposite of the smell.

83,248,magictacosinus,3.6,"Poured in a pint glass as followed by instructions on the bottle. Freshness date is listed as 2/13/12.  Appearance: Cloudy (due to the yeast) with a pale, yellowish color. It poured a giant head that slowly shrinks.  Smell: A great sweet malty and wheat smell. Some notes of clove and citrus in there as well. Any fresh wheat-based beer should smell like this.  Taste: It tastes as sweet as it smells with cane sugar malt flavors, and contains an herb-tinged finish. The nice tasting yeast is actually the main factor for drinking this beer. The beer is quite watery, which is normal for beers of this type, and allows it to be a refreshing drink. However, for my liking, this is a bit to low on hops or even the extra kick of sweetness aided with more malts or alcohol.  Mouthfeel: Not much to really say, other than it is refreshing, easy to drink, and perfect for any time of the year - especially the summer.  Overall: This is still a good, classic example of witbiers and am happy to see that it's common to find in any average corner store. After revisiting this beer, however, I'm far more interested in trying the grand cru version that is only found in Belgium, as I've read that it's an unreal tasting experience!

I also got a light bready/grassy aroma.  Taste: Slightly sweet citrus, but with a sourness to it. I also get a mild spicy wheat flavor. This is a pretty tasty beer.  Mouthfeel: Nice lively carbonation which allows the flavors to really shine. This is a crisp light Witbier beer, but a little on the watery side compared to other Witbier beers I've had.  Overall: I enjoyed this one but found it to be lighter in flavor to my two favorite Witbier beers: Allagash White and Southampton Double White Ale.

The color is very hazy, cloudy golden with a thick 2 finger white cap the lace sticks ok and bead is very fine. The smell is good there is gentle wheat aroma with mild yeast esters, not forceful aromas, but not the style for that either. The feel is good, lots of creamy yeast and wheat smoothness with subtle spice and tanginess from the yeast which also works with the high carbonation level. I like how the sweetness is gentle and balanced by the spice with a semi-dry finish.  The taste is mild with some good flavors from the wheat which is cereal like -toasted and lightly sweet. There is a mild citrus tinge and hint of pepper from the yeast but overall this is flavored primarily from the wheat which has a nice fresh, clean flavor. The yeast adds to the beer without being to full to make it feel bready which I like. This is a good wit, not the best but it is an originator it has lost some footing to others in this style which I prefer like Allagash. I would not hesitate to drink this, since it is pretty widely available.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

The beer also looks carbonated in the glass… let's see what this brew tastes like.  Whoa! This beer punches you in the face, and that carbonation that I was talking about is still there. It's actually almost too carbonated. But it settles down as you move into the aftertaste. Speaking of the aftertaste, it sticks around. It lasts for a while actually. This beer would be a good summer beer. Hey, it's summer… makes sense, right?  The label is actually pretty cool too. Not sure what it means, but when I was sitting at the bar the lady beside me made a comment about it. (I actually used to see her all the time when I went into Kinko's.

But the beer seemed to have a bit of sweet and sour mix itself. The first thing I did was pitch the orange slice they put in it. This isn't Corona, it doesn't need any help.  I was taken right away with how light a yellow this beer was with a very nice white head, but this is my first time trying a Witbier. It was a touch cloudy and produced a nice lace.  It was hard to get much of a read on aroma, as it was served up in a pilsner glass, but I primarily got fruit and corriander.  The taste was similar to the smell, but I got more hops at the midway point of the drink. The citrusy taste along with the spice and hops made a nice combo.

D- 4 All in all, a solid offering and a standby due to its high availability, Hoegaarden is a classic of the style and should at least be tried by all. Though not supremely complex, it boasts good flavor and it is definitely consistent. It is not so heavy and I could put down this brew with ease. It's not my favorite style, but when in the mood it is a good one to fall back on.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

The beer had a very nice blend of spices that you can definetly tell are present, but not too over-powering. They give the beer a great flavor, and help it to finish nice and crisp with no unpleasant aftertast whatsoever. Also tried in a bottle. The spices in the bottle are a little more prominent, but still a great drink. I'd would say the beer is slightly better on tap when compared to the bottle version.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Taste: Refreshing apricot with a clean, zesty crisp finish. Citrus notes throughout.  Mouthfeel: Light and bubbly with a lot of carbonation. Tapers off to a smooth creaminess. Leaves the tongue refreshed and clean.  Overall: This is my first white ale. I came with lower expectations but the refreshing citrus and floral notes makes this a good beer to clean your palate when eating lighter foods. Great introduction to white ales.

Sm: Lemony esters abound, backed by other fringe citrus notes.  T: Lemony body; maybe too much zest. The citrusy notes do come through on the climax, though not like they do in the draught version. Built simply but well. Kind of defines the style.  Mf: Fizzy but smooth, and wet and refreshing. I don't like the finish texture, which is sort of dryly irritating and almost choking.

Pour a hazy, pale yellow with a nice white head that retains rather well. Light wheat aroma with citrus notes. Light orange and lemon zest taste, with smooth bready malts that are somewhat overcome by the general wheat beer harshness; acidic, with a bitter aftertaste.

M: Nice slightly chalky mouthfeel. The beer has a nice presence to it in the mouth, even at a very light 4.9%.  O: Overall, this is a can't miss classic when I'm in the mood for a witbier. Although Allagash white is maybe a bit more refined, I find this much zestier, and more flavorful in general. This beer is extremely refreshing and is a summer classic. As much as I find myself skeptical of it sometimes on the shelves, it never fails to satisfy. And at 8.39 a 6 pack here (compared to 9.99 for an Allagash 4 pack) I can't fight purchasing.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,ILessThan3Brett,2.66,"First off, RIP Pierre Celis: resurrected Hoegaarden in 1966, a time of Belgian white dearth, left around 1988 after forced takeover by what is now ABInBev, died a month ago today.  I'm really writing this review because the last few Hoegaardens I've had (all from bottle, all poured into hexagonal Hoegaarden glass) have really hammered home that this is an ABInbev product. This makes me sad because Hoegaarden was one of the first beers I ever really liked. I feel that its quality has dropped off since I first had it in 2006. In particular, it now has that special distinction common to mass-produced beer: it when slightly warmed, it has a chalky, artificial taste that makes it drinkable only when very cold. Overall, I still very much appreciate the seasonings added to this beer, but something has gone wrong here with the wheat, yeast, hops, or fermentation, and I see myself heavily, heavily favoring beers like Allagash White over Hoegaarden going forward.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

83,248,axeman9182,3.43,"Bottle served at the Cloverleaf Tavern with a six sided Hoegaarden pint glass.  Hoegaarden pours a hazy straw color. My first thought was that it looked like a very cloudy glass of lemonade. A solid three fingers of frothy white foam top the beer and come up to the rim of the glass, before slowly creeping back down towards the body of the beer. Lacing is a bit spotty. The nose is surprisingly coriander forward, but has a solid orange-citrus presence as well. Finally there's a touch of sweetness from the wheat to complete the picture. Everything that should be here is, but for my money the proportions and ratios are just a little bit off. If the nose is just a little bit out of whack, the flavor takes that imbalance a little bit further. It's not quite like what I'd imagine downing a bag of crushed coriander would be like, but it's approaching that territory. It takes me a few sips to make it past that and enjoy the small citrus flourish that's present as well. There's no real support from wheat or any other malt to rein things in either. The unquestioned bright spot here is the picturesque light body and active carbonation full of small, precise bubbles. I don't recall the draft pours of Hoegaarden I've had seeming so aggressively coriander dominant, but I don't think I'll be reaching for a bottle of this any time soon.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,Reznick,4.18,"Hoegaarden has been my go-to for quality, commercial available whites.  Appearance: Pours a hazy, cloudy orange that is common for whites, but seemed to have a richer appearance than other whites I have encountered.  Smell: Definitely sweet, and the combination of coriander and orange peel come out, and the banana that is so prominent in the taste of the beer also seems to be present in the smell.  Taste: I find this beer to be delicious. The wheat flavor is present but not overpowering, and it is accompanied by a rich combination of coriander and orange that is the first part of the taste. This is followed by definite but not excessive banana notes, and follows with a pleasant and more subtle clove flavor. Finishes and lingers sweet.  Mouthfeel: Quite pleasant, somewhat creamy in a distinctly Witbier way (but obviously nowhere close to that found in quality stouts) yet balanced. Very smooth as well.  Overall: I have a soft spot for this beer. This is my favorite of the widely commercially available whites, and is an incredibly pleasant yet subtly flavorful drink. Well recommended.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

S: A sweet wheat base with hints of lemon, orange, and clove spices.  T: Great wheaty and spicy character. The beer has a full flavour but remains a bit spicy and light as well. I like the coriander/lemony flavours in the beer the best. It is very refreshing on a hot day  M: Medium body with a good carbonation which complements the spicy characters of the beer.

Not as much spice as I typically like in a wit, but the flavors that are there are strong, well rounded, and delicious.  M – Soft medium/light body. Light sweet finish with just a hint of cilantro bitterness.  O – I haven’t had a Hoegaarden in years, and this glass was much better than I remembered the beer being.

83,248,MaltsOfGlory,3.65,"Pours a nice one finger head, looks very frothy, maybe even creamy. The head is completely white and the body is a hazy, clearish-yellow color. It's a very very VERY weird body, it looks like carbonated lemonade, I mean its cloudy, but at the same time it's see through, it's like see through for only so long, and then the cloudiness kicks in. It has hues of orange, but when you hold it up to the light it looks way more yellow. The head is also interesting, it reminds me of what the top of a mocha or latte would look like, so that's good, because it looks creamy! Overall it looks super weird, but pretty good, and the head is still hanging around a little bit. This bee also has a very unique smell, I don't think I've ever smelled something as unique as this, it's just bursting with citrus. There is clearly citrus, oranges, probably lemons, and definitely coriander. All the citruses are there, and they are pretty recognizable, but they smell a lot different than say a blue moon or something else that uses the same ingredients, maybe they use more of them, or just better quality, not sure which, but it smells really good and really unique. It also smell really clean, super clean and probably really refreshing, overall a very nice aroma. Very tasty, I don't know if it deserves a 4 for taste, but either way it is super tasty and super unique. On some sips there isn't much flavor, but on others it's just bursting with flavor, you get all the flavors that were indicated on the smell, orange, lemon, coriander. Not much in the way of hops, a tiny bit of malts, but who really cares when this beer is so tasty! The only reason I don't want to give this a 4 is because it is a little light and watery at times. It's super tasty, but I just don't think it deserves a 4. Mouthfeel is decent, nothing too outstanding there. Drinkability is pretty good, I mean it's a belgian white, so it's not going to be hard to put away. Overall the two things that impressed me about this beer is how unique it is and how well the smell represented the taste. Pretty damn good beer overall, not perfect, and not an outstanding beer, but a good beer that I have very little to complain about.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,Groomsy,3.22,"12 oz. bottle with ""best before"" date of December 2011, poured into a tall pilsner/wheat beer glass. Picked this up as a single in a mix-six pack. Review taken from brief notes.  Appearance: One of the palest beers I've seen - nearly yellow/bright straw body - hints of bright orange - with some haze and sediment in suspension. Topped by a large frothy head of bone-white foam which recedes fairly quickly to a small cap of foam. No lacing at all. The glass was clean as a whistle when I finished.  Smell: This may be an old bottle, so this review is by no means objective. (I may get a fresh batch and re-review.) All of the standard witbier smells are there: Spices, citrus, and fresh wheat; but this beer also has some hefeweizen-esque notes of banana and herbs. Pretty refreshing overall, but there's a slight note of skunk lingering in the background. (Old bottle?)  Taste: Not as much as I expected; maybe Sierra Nevada's Hefeweizen spoiled me, or maybe I need to find a fresher six-pack. It follows the nose in the most linear way possible. Fresh wheat sweetness hits the tongue at first, melting into a note of spices and citrus in the middle, followed by a snappy finish of banana and some fruity tartness. Very little hop bitterness to be found here. Not bad, but not great. The flavors overall are rather dull and somewhat watery. Fairly average witbier.  Mouthfeel: A little thinner than I expected, but still refreshing. Snappy carbonation makes it go down smooth and there's not a lot of flavor in the finish, so if you don't want to really think about what you're drinking, you might enjoy this.  Overall: Good place to start for wits, but maybe not the be-all end-all. Again, maybe I need to find a fresher batch and re-review, but I wasn't terribly impressed by this. Or maybe wheat beers just aren't my thing, as I'm discovering. It's worth a try, but it's not fantastic.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

I was expecting something similar to a Blue Moon, lots of orange and such, turned out to have far more spices than anticipated, highly pleasant. The orange was subtle, mostly it was spices and yeast.  Decent beer, decent drinkability. I'm personally undecided on how much I like the spices, but far from an unpleasant beer. Rather good in fact.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,ant5431,2.16,After reading the other reviews I see Im in the minority NOT A FAN! Had seen this beer around forever finally gave it a try seeing as its on the list in my beer club all I can say is it was a challenge to drink the whole glass! Was my first and can say last! Its appearance was unimpressive. The taste was just bad & left unplesent taste in mouth. The smell was the nicest thing I can say about this beer and even that didnt jump out at me!,Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,Ryanm1,3.42,"The appearance of this beer is bar none. It is the typical cloudy wheat yellow beer. The smell of this beer is great with orange peel and corriander stereortypical of most other wheat beers. This beer usually comes with the perfect mount of head. If pouring this from a bottle use the instructions found on the side of the bottle stating how to pour the last 1/8 of the bottle into your glass after rolling it on its side. The mouthfeel is descent. Incredible drinkability. In Rome my friends and I used to have a bar in Campo De Fiori that we called the Hoegarrden Bar as it would serve incredibly sized drafts of this delicious nector for only five euros. This was a steal at the time in 2005 as most other drafts, including american imports were at least 5 euros as well.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

83,248,KajII,3.62,"[Best served in a Tumbler or Weizen glass]  Poured a hazy pale yellow with an average sized white fizzy head that was mostly diminishing and had good lacing. The aroma was heavy with a leathery yeast scent, light flowery hops with notes of orange and allspice. It tasted quite yeasty with a mild acidic flavor at first and finished about the same except for the hints of orange on the tongue left , to linger for a nice while. Mouthfeel was light to medium in body and was suprisingly very creamy in texture. Overall a very tasty wheat beer, definitley worth drinking a few.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Cloudy and even cloudy enough so you can't see through the beer. Started with a white head that has settled to a thin foam covering the whole beer.  S- smell is faint But enjoyable. Typical Belgian yeast and fruity smells of mostly banana and pear.  T- taste is a direct clone of the nose. The fruits play the biggest role and the yeastiness is a good tasty distraction. Well balanced beer that is good for the style.  M- light to light medium bodied. Great feel. The only downside is whenever I drink Belgians the yeasty taste is almost a chore after the first beer. Weird, but it happens.  D- very light and tasty. This is going down easy but the banana could be a bit much after 3 or 4  Good Belgian beer.

Taste: Quite wheaty with a touch of lemon and pepper (as reflected in aroma). The lemony twang strikes early with a slow descent into wheaty smoothness. Aftertaste persists for some time. These flavors are just a tad muted in comparison to other wits in its class. Mouthfeel: Medium and smooth mouthfeel. Drinkability: Very drinkable and enjoyable in a session.

Nice but too sweet  T- The wheat malts are actually very weak, and hence the body is thin but refreshing. Citrus is dominant again with some banana and pepper to back up. Not much, the taste is all on your tongue, the palate feels empty and demands some flavours  M- Yes, this is very refreshing, but it is so thin that flavours just do not hook up with the palate. Quite an empty mouthfeel actually  D- Really drinkable and sure a thirst quencher.

Some peppery hints and a big bubblegum style aroma toward the back end with a hint of alcohol.  T- Banana and citrus comes in the front with a bitterness that comes from a light wheat undertone. Some peppery notes toward the middle of the beer help the wheat body base shine for a second. Bubblegum like flavor toward the backend with hints of clove and alcohol.  M- Medium mouthfeel. Carbonation is good for the style. Banana, wheat, and citrus flavors left on the palate. Aftertaste is more alcohol forward, with hints of clove and wheat. Medium drying on the palate from the alcohol. Flavors were well balanced for the stlye. No off flavors were present in the beer.  D- This beer is a wonderful example of the style.

My friend brought it over, I thanked him then asked him what kind of beer it was. He said a Belgian White, and I said huh. End of story.  The trademark color for a Witbier. Nice n' foggy lemonade looking beer that pours a big white head with moderate retention and lacing.  Quite pungent in it's soapy/coriander area, with some twang of lemon and citrus notes. Tis nice to sniff.  Tis just as nice to sip. For myself, Witbiers tend to smell and taste almost exactly the same. And this is no different. A tasty mouthful of citrus and fresh soapy goodness hit me like a slap. Has a soft bite and lays surprisingly heavy in the mouth. Has a great aftertaste, and a beautiful smelling belch that asks you for more.  Hoegaarden is in my opinion the number 1 go to beer to persuade people to start trying different beer. It's foreign, tasty, nice to look at, and readily available. With it's all season taste and look, sexy lookin' bottle and funny name, this has become a favorite of mine, and a beer I'll be drinking till the day I die.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

I can't tell how much carbonation is there due to the haziness and there seems to be a fair amount of lacing. The head lasted for around 3 minutes before it began to dissipate.  Smell - cloves, breads/grains, lemons, coriander  Taste & Mouth - The beer has a lot of carbonation and it feels very light and lively on the tongue. I can taste lots of breads/grains, cloves, and lemon juice. Also some notes of coriander. It finishes with a bready clove/coriander aftertaste.

T - Taste is dominated by spice and citrus character. Spice is a bit much for my taste. Not very deep. Strikes me more as a spiced Pilsner than a wit.  M - Thin and highly carbonated.

The head dissipated moderately and eventually formed into a thin halo of lace. The initial aromas were of Belgian yeast, citrus, and varied light fruits. The initial flavors were yeast, fruits, lemon and some breadiness. This brew had a light body with light to medium carbonation.  Overall, this was a nice light beer.

83,248,ZenAgnostic,4.35,"A - Clean white 2 finger head with visible bubbles. The hoegaarden bottle recommends swirling the final 1/3rd of the bottle before pouring it. This helps give it a denser aromatic head. Soon dissolves into a lasting paper thin head.  S - Lightly complex with subdued spices and hints of orange.  T - Could be a little more complex, but the subtly increases the drinkability for more unsophisticated AAL palates.  M - Very creamy with very hidden alcohol.  D - Drinkability is where this beer really shines. It's a great starter beer for people who are used to drinking American Adjuncts. It offers complexity without being overwhelming to unexperienced drinkers.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,TheBrewo,3.47,"We pour a hazy, straw colored brew which holds a white head of two fingers. The head rumbles actively and disappears rather quickly, leaving no lace as it goes. The carbonation looks to be quite active. The brew is hazy throughout, but no yeasty aggregates are visible. The aroma is rich with wheat and malts. The remainer of the nose is taken up by clovey phenols, soft fruity esters, and orange and lemon citrus. As we sip, the flavor starts lightly, with wheat, a floury grain, and bitter citrus rind taking center stage. Phenols promptly take over through the middle, which continues the front's theme of being reserved in flavor. Esters also appear here, affording faint sweetness. The middle sings through right to the end, without any abrupt revival of other ingredients, or inclusions of stronger ones. The aftertaste breaths with a bit of clove, but mostly clean malts and an obvious wheat shine through. The body is on the lighter side, and the carbonation is fairly significant. The mouth is left wet, but not satiated. This is, in part, due to the watery feel and lack of any general creaminess to the sip. The abv is standard, and the brew drinks with simplicity.  Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was its roundedness. The pour revealed a simplistic looking brew, with a straightforward aroma, and a light, and crisp taste. While it is not exemplary for the style, this brew served its purpose and quenched our thirst.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Notes - Don't know if it's the same in the US, but it crowds every supermarket shelf here in the UK, it would be nice to have a decent Belgian witbier available.

One look at this unique fluid, and you will understand why it is called a ""white beer"". Hoegaarden has a unique head, and translucent whiteness to its coloration. The flavor is another worldly experience as well. Very light, smooth and refreshing. Be warned, it is less like beer than a drink all its own. A must try beverage.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,crayolahalls,3.34,"Served in a pint glass at Winking Lizard tavern in Akron. A slice of orange was mounted on the side of the glass. Was a follow up to a Three Philosophers and accompanied a spicy chicken sandwich with fries. This was certainly not the right way to enjoy this beer, but it was the first Belgian White I have tried and was not sure what to expect.  Appearance - Sunny yellow. Cloudy. Very think white head formed from tiny bubbles. Looked almost like a smidge of meringue on top.  Smell - Not really strong. Couldn't pick up much of anything. Better than Bud, but hard to describe. I think the taste of the hot sauce was strong enough to diminish the main smell.  Taste - Was very light, slightly tart. Kind of refreshing. The orange served in the glass almost overpowered whatever was there to discover. I did notice a slight alcohol flavor. NOT a good pairing with hot sauce.  Mouthfeel - Combo with hot sauce made me pucker. Was very light in consistency.  DRinkability - Actually had a hard time drinking it. This is one I would like to try again while outdoor in the dead heat of summer.

Not really picking up much.  Taste - Honestly this beer seems somewhat absent of flavor. It hints of wheat and white beer qualities but very little comes through. Some slight straw/Euro hints but again, very subtle.  Mouthfeel - Fairly smooth and silky in mouth.  Drinkability - Low alcohol and mild flavorings make this somewhat drinkable.  Overall - I'm not a big fan of Belgian Whites. I mistakenly bought a single of this to sample in haste without reading the style (I thought I grabbed a Belgian Pale Ale). If you like easy to drink Belgian White's I'm sure you'll enjoy this one. Just ok for me though, not being a big fan of this style.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Like a lemon/orange zest. Typical witbier yeastiness with wheat/cereal.  Mouthfeel: Feels great all the way through the bottle. Very clean, dry finish.

I used to drink this alot before I really got into beer and never really noticed how spot on this is for the style which is very refreshing since it's so popular.  T - Lot's more of that sweet spice mingling with some great lemony/orangy citrus. Very refreshing and tasty. Citrus really comes out in the finish while the spice is sublte at the start while mixing with some crisp breadiness.  M - Good amount of carbonation with a light to medium body. Very smooth.

83,248,Bouleboubier,4.3,"Eh, can't help but look to this as the benchmark of the style - had Blue Moon a few times in high school and thought it tasted like suntan lotion - hated it. Was hesitant to try this for a long while after hearing it was like said Luna Azul (hmm, like that name mejor). Anyway, once I finally tried this, I was surprised and delighted by its quality and its charms. I've come across a few examples of a wit more enjoyable and flavorful, but each random time I come back to this, I'm hardly disappointed.  Observations:  Cloudy, moonlight yellow with an imaginary green tinge. The snow white head springs up about an inch, excellent retention (textbook), sits compact foamy and maintains a soft cap down to the last sip. Very nice.  I wouldn't say the smell is in any way ""perfumy"" - vaguely floral, maybe - but it sho' is kicking with coriander, bordering extreme. Bready? Yeasty? Grainy, for sure - a little musty, with a mellow creamy citrus zest.  A big flavor component is something quite herbal, almost a chamomile thing. The malt is doughy, biscuity, and lightly sweet. The citrus flavors fall somewhere in between orange and lemon, and a tiny tart tingle is found in the aftertaste. Not peppery or stinging - at all.  What really makes this drinkable is the fact that, while the body comes across slightly husky - above medium - in line for what I'd expect from wheat - it's just light enough, due in part to the way the foam bubbles collect and pop on the tongue, softly scrubbing it along and finishing a good bit dry.  Yeah, Hoo-gaarden is verrry drinkable. Excellent taste and balanced nicely in spite of the zealous infection of coriander.

Probably a good reference point for me, in venturing past my ""safe zone"" of dark craft beers. While there were no dominant flavours of citrus and or coriander, this subtle, refreshing, yet creamy beer is the smoothest and most drinkable of its type that I know of. Perfectly balanced. Not even a hint of sourness as many other white/pale/wheat ales go. The aroma was cologne-grade pretty, of subtle citrus, with no metallic or glassy smell.

83,248,Jadjunk,4.15,"#40. Big landmark review... not. Hoegaarden Witbier-biere blanche. I've been looking forward to trying this out for a while as I enjoy Witbiers and this one is a popular and common choice.  Poured from a 11.2 oz. bottle to a mug at room temp.  (Appearance) Wow. Some rather light pouring yielded a volatile massive four finger head! Pour with caution! The head is dense foam but recedes rather briskly. The beer is a light cream yellow, some grey tones, one step away from lemonade, and is certainly very hazy and cloudy. Carbonation is quite active. The beer looks alright. 3  (Smell) Hmm, a grassy odor is quite strong here. Beyond that, some wheat and grainy aroma builds up a faint malt and I also pick up a mellow smell of some orange flavor and perhaps some honey, a little more bold and up front than in other Witbiers. This beer seems to be pretty well rounded in aromas. It has a pleasantly sweet smell. 3.5  (Taste) Good. Wheat is subtle followed by the orange peel or a lemony tone and some spices that grow bolder as the drink warms. I can't help but feel that I'm tasting honey or something else that is very sweet in this beer. Finish drones on the taste of sweet wheat with a bold spice kick in the final moments (coriander?). Really interesting, very easy to consume and quite enjoyable. 4.5  (Mouthfeel) Incredibly smooth. Carbonation is very low in the mouthfeel and this is a very smooth drink with little bitterness in the aftertaste. Barely a dry taste to be had here, very Light-Medium body, not even watery. Good stuff. 4  (Drinkability) Highly drinkable. I could easily consume several of these back-to-back. The flavor is subtle and enjoyable with enough complexity to keep me guessing. ABV is low and mouthfeel is great. Those who love a wheat beer bordering on the fruity end with a subtle spicy whiplash will chug through a six pack of these without remorse. 4.5  Verdict: One of the most interesting things about this beer is the spice kick on the end, which grows in intensity further into the drink, with big sips and as the beer warms. I guess this must be the coriander which is really interesting and enjoyable. It's almost like a holiday spice. This beer should sit well with a large portion of the drinker's crowd, old and new to the game. It's a lighter bodied drink than the average beer, but the flavor is wonderful and full of surprises.

Think Blue Moon without the citrus. This leaves so many meal-paring possibilities. As one fella, said salty foods would be amazing with this.

Some retention on the 1 finger head but mostly medium sized bubbles that have some staying power, but not completely. There is virtually no lacing on this beer.  Smell is a dominant fake lemon almost bottled lemon juice, with some orange citrus. Faint weak bread characteristics masked by the fruit. Somewhat actually sour but for the most part nothing offensive.  Taste is of a spring time lemonade, and orange juice quality, with some chewey texture but mostly wet mouthfeel. A little bite to the finish which is kind of surprising.  I could have another but I'd probably want something better.

Citrus lights up my mouth and slowly moves into fermented fruity yeast leaving the palate wet not sticky.

(though as the standard of beer in Belgium is generally much higher - being the bud isn't such a terrible thing really)  The head on this beer can be hit and miss depending on your luck, some bottles are good, some or sadly flat and disappointing.  Very smooth citrus taste and a lingering after taste that is quite mild, not too bitter - even at the end of serving it remains, I think this consistent taste + the easy drinkability that makes this beer popular.  A good beer to have with a friend who isn't a fan of strong tasting beer, or to share with lady-friend - It seems to be (from my own experience) that beer female beer drinkers all have good things to say about this beer in general.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

There was a nice carbonation. This brew has a nice little tanginess to it, that gives it a nice flavor. This representation of the brew is pretty good, not the best I have had, but always a good one to pick up at local bar.  This brew is very easy to drink.

Carbonation aggressively rises. The head slowly settles leaving no lacing. It looks spectacular.  The scent is heavy on wheat, though coriander is present as well. Alcohol is slightly noticeable. It's pretty straightforward on the nose, though perhaps a bit on the watery side.  The taste is light and refreshing. Wheat character comes through without dominating. The coriander is very noticeable, as is the mild orange citrus. Hoegaarden is not my favorite example of this style, but it's pretty much the standard. It's not going to throw you any curveballs but it is always a solid and enjoyable brew.  The mouthfeel is pleasant. It's deceptively heavy but you don't really notice. The carbonation still looks like it's going crazy, but it's actually quite in check in the mouth and maintains a counterbalance with the weight of the brew.  This is a tasty brew for sure and at 4.9% ABV, the alcohol is fairly in check. Personally the coriander is a bit overbearing for me to want to put more than a couple of these back in a sitting.

Poured into a ping glass from a 330 ml. bottle, Hoegaarden shows a hazy lemon pour, almost white in color. Half an inch of foam offers moderate retention.  Aroma is a major step up from the draft version and offers notes of lemony orange, yeast, and mixed spices along with a touch of sweetness. Touch of sourness after some exposure.  Flavor improves as well yet seems somewhat artificial. More orange than lemon, slightly sweet and viscous for the style. A good carbonation supports the feel reasonably well. A bit of a spin brings back a cap of foam and a myriad of smells. Finish is short with a bit of lemon bread. Decent drinkability though nothing special and the spices seem a bit overdone.

I was far away from the bar in the pub and it was a busy night so the head was mostly faded by the time I received it.  A - Cloudy whitish yellow. It kinda looked like a nice glass of hazy lemonade. About a half a finger of white head when I received it which reduced to a lasting thin cover. Lacing was moderate but I wasn't really paying attention due to the next factor.  S - This is what really threw me off on this one. I LOVED the smell of this beer. Heavy coriander aroma with some pepper and citrus.  T - Its quite what I expected it to taste like given the smell. Pretty sweet from the citrus but the majority of the flavor and aftertaste comes from the spices. A unique experience in my beer-tasting thus far. I squeezed a few lemon drops in for the last few sips but made that pretty much made it more of a hard lemonade XD  M - The mouthfeel was kinda sticky and sweet but carbonation was about right enough to make it a wonderful thirst quencher.

The most mellow belgian beer, possibly on the market. Tastes like a light beer to the taste buds, but feels like a loaf of bread in the belly. Beware.

I also have to give thanks to Pierre Celis for reviving the witbier style with this one.  A: Paler than straw yellow, and hazy (although more light and clear than I remember). A two-finger, ghost-white head rises to form the head. Little lacing is left from the foamy, moussy cap, but the retention is remarkable.  S: The aroma is crisp, tart, and grassy. Sour, zesty fruit notes emerge, like those of a fresh orange peel (shocker!) The nose is very well-balanced, and clean, with a just bit of a punch from the coriander.  T: The flavor is refreshing, delivering a light sweetness along with a touch of lactic sourness. No surprises, just a plain, straightforward beer. Orange peel and coriander subtly blend with the soft malt.  M: Light and effervescent, the carbonation is perfectly matched to the creaminess. Hoegaarden's mouthfeel is smooth and slick, with a sour tang that sticks your tongue to the roof of your mouth.  D: Medium drinkability.

Im very happy with this because the coriander and orange peel are not overpowering the actual taste of the beer and the wheat is just right! Carbonation, i dont really notice it, its pretty weak but its perfect! nice lacing of course ( kinda expected from a big belgian beer ) and it goes down very very well. On a hot summer day pounding back a few of these would be amazing! I cant wait! Cheers!!",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Smells of wheat and some cloves (phenols?). The slightest hint of fruity esters that don't resemble any actual fruit.  Tastes follows smell. Some wheat, cloves and white pepper, and perhaps a hint of banana esters, but i think that's a stretch.  Mouthfeel is super light. Well carbonated and some spice.

To this day, on the rare occasion that I can actually find it in the store, it is a must buy.

The color is yellowish and very hazy. Good lacing initially but kind of gets thin quickly. Decent look overall.  S- Typical witbier aromas of citrus, spiciness, particularly of cloves and coriander, sweet malts and fresh crispiness. Strong smelling and well balanced aroma overall.  T- More of the same here....the spices really hit the palate first, followed by mellow orange and/or grapefruit rind. The refreshing sweetness of the wheat malt balances out the tartness/earthiness of the aforementioned qualities. Finishes crisp and with just a slight hop presence.  M- I find this medium to full bodied for a wheat beer, as it is very smooth. The carbonation is subtle and doesn't scrub the palate either. At the same time, the finish leaves a clean and crisp feeling beer.  D- At first, this comes across as a potent flavored brew and might be hard to want a bunch, but after getting about halfway through my sampling here, it gets much mellower as it warms up a bit. It is refreshing and would really cut through a spicy Asian dish well. On it's own this makes a really nice hot weather brew.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Maybe the malt could be stronger but it's a stretch to say that. Step above American versions of this style I have tried (Blue Moon)as they tend to be too heavy on the coriander and loose the flavor balance.  mouthfeel; nothing special, not watery and slightly thick but not too many complexities, just average.  drinkability; definatly a drinkable beer, tasty but not so good that it would be a disservice to the beer to drink in quantity and lose flavor.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Similar to the scent, not strong but a bit spicier notes from the yeast flavors, feint bit of citrusy notes and hint of wheat malt flavors.  Mouthfeel is pretty good, mostly balanced, but the carbonataion bites the cheeks and tongue, somewhat expected for a light wheat beer.

A little funky and spicy with notes of pepper. Smells very similar to a saison ale.  T - Slightly spicy up front gives way to citrus, banana, and dry earthy hops. Very well balanced. I've always noticed the flavors in this beer sort of come alive as it warms up a bit.  M - Light bodied and well carbonated. Very smooth.  D - While I could see myself sessioning this, it is kind of pricey and therefore remains an occasional treat for me. Great sipping beer though, especially in the summer.

The smell approaches onto saison territory.  T: It's not as sweet in the taste as it is in the smell. Slightly spicy at the front, the overall profile is pretty mellow. Lemons and sweet citrus dominate the palate, with mild coriander spice and sour hop flavor cutting through occasionally. Very balanced, very good.  M: This beer is deceptively thick, though not really filling. It has a certain stickiness and fairly aggressive carbonation.  D: I can't argue with the name ""orginal"" white ale.

It was light on the palate with low carbonation. Overall it goes down very smooth. This might have been due to the lackluster intensity of the flavors and aroma present.

Appearance: They're not kidding about this being a white beer. This has to be one of the palest beers I've ever poured. It's a cloudy light yellow color with a hint of orange and brown to it in the core of the glass when held up to the light. The foam is a persistent white dense 1/8"" thick, with islands and sheets of foam on the glass here and there as I drank it down. There are lots of bubbles coming up through the beer. If it wasn't so pale I would really be amazed at this one - but it's supposed to be so let's move on.  Smell: Grain, cloves, a hint of banana, orange and some spiciness I can't place (I know they say coriander on the bottle, but it doesn't quite smell like coriander to me). This reminds me of a hefeweizen beer, except stronger in the orange and clove department.  Taste: The taste is remarkably weak in this beer. I get a wheat beer/grain flavor combined with a weak bit of orange citrus and a mild spicy, but not bitter, finish. It's a very smooth and beer, but it's not leaping out in flavor. It's still refreshing though.  Mouthfeel: For all the carbonation you see in the glass, the carbonation on the tongue is very muted - just enough to cleanse the palate, but otherwise not a lot. The beer is thick and smooth at the same time. Nice.  Drinkability: Very drinkable on a hot day. I had this before during a baseball game and thought it was pretty good in the bottle. In the glass it's still very drinkable and it quenches the thirst very well. Went well with a meal then (burger) and now (asiago and orzo chicken) and I wouldn't mind having another one.

83,248,Perrumpo,5,"My favorite Witbier. Drinkability on-tap is amazing with this one.  This beer has just the right amount of spice for a witbier. The light, somewhat-cloudy appearance and the wheat & citrus aroma are appealing during the hot summer days. The taste and mouthfeel are even more satisfying. The spice and citrus are prevalent enough to give this beer a mouthful of flavor, but not too strong to take away from the wheat and yeast. Smooth as can be, patricularly on-tap, Hoegaarden has the perfect balance for summer - or anytime you want a witbier.

Finally a random check in southern NYS found it  Appearance: cloudy white  Smell: not very noticeable, hard to detect.  Taste: fantastic wheat beer. not over-the top wheat flavor that makes you feel like you're eating bread, but hints of wheat and citrus. The citrus also doesnt make it taste like lemon-aid has been added (like some beers). It's a calm beer with slight but distinctive tastes that just makes you smile when you drink it.  Mouthfeel: smooth. light, but not watery like a ""xxx-light"" beer.  drinkability: great, I could drink this beer all night or have it with dinner. It's a versatile beer that I was very pleased with. couldn't stop drinking it actually.  Edit: after some more ""research"", I did find one six-pack that tasted different. It was a bit stale tasting or like it had been frozen and thawed or something. It wasn't as bright and clean tasting as it should have been. If that was the first hoegaarden I had experienced I would not have bought another six-pack. The next set though from the same store at the same time was great. Not sure what happened but reading a few bad reviews among many good reviews tells me there are possibly some quality control issues with this beer. 5/6 good six-packs for me so far.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

There was a strong taste of lemon and cinnamon. A slight hint of cloves but bubblegum taste was not present  Mouthfeel: Very nice. Lightly carbonated. Balance was pretty much bang on.

Speaking of which, I have tried this beer with a slice of orange or lemon in it, which seems to bring out the sweet citrus taste in the beer even more. In a bottle, poured into a Hoegaarden hexagonal glass, produces a beautiful head, and on tap is even better, although very difficult to locate a place in Australia that has it on tap. Try it with a slice of lemon or orange. Beautiful!",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

83,248,Colleen219,3,This isn't a bad beer but I think I expected more because its so popular. It tasted more like a lager than any of the other Belgian Whites that I've tried. Its still a good choice on a hot summer day but honestly I'd rather drink a Goose Island Matilda or a Blue Moon White Ale.,Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,vazy,3.17,"A- an extremely white yellow cloudy color is poured. Reminds me of white cranberry juice. Spects of what seems to be orange peel sit on the head.  S- it is filled with spicy tones. Orange peel or even grapefruit notes are very present. Coriander is the most predominant spice with some wheat and malty undertones.  T- Its soft and malty with some spiciness coming from the orange peel and coriander. A somewhat lemony bite at the end of a sip makes me wanting more.  M- Its not very thick but easy to drink  O- Its enjoyable and crafty. Everything from the color to the spects of orange peel that lace the head make me want to like this beer.

It pours a cloudy pale yellow, much like a real lemonade. Very little orange in it, nothing like Blue Moon.  It smells wonderful, kind of like a lemon scented candle or something but with a little spice to it.  Served with a lemon which always enhances the citrusy notes that come with this beer. Had it without lemon as well and still tastes like it has lemon in it. I dont get the orange peel that others do. Lemon and orange definitely have different characters and I catch the lemon. I agree with the corriander and wheat malts that come with this unfiltered beer.  This beer is very light, clean, and easy to drink. Not much carbonation, so it doesnt fill you up. Be careful as its easy to drink this like lemonade, rather than beer.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

The aroma is muted with a sour grain off note, citric acidity, light wheat spice and some spicing. The flavor is quite boring. It's a bit too acidic and the grain doesn't have a good flavor. Some grassiness and spice. There's just not a ton going on. Mouthfeel is fine. Not bad but not something that I'd care to order again.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Not as citrussy as I thought it would be and that's good. No bitterness at all, though it is a tad tangy. Leaves a fruity taste in the mouth.  M: Fairly creamy with a bite of carbonation.

Smooth, orange-lemon citrus tea flavor with yeasty, French bread overtones and piquant spice in the back of the palate after the fizzy carbonation subsides. Solid wheat presence.

83,248,GRPunk,4.13,"Bottle (best by 16/01/11 which seems a little long shelf life for the style) poured into a Hoegaarden Hexagonal glass. My wife loves this beer which is part of the reason I actually have the glass. I actually have a greater appreciation for the vessel. It has a nice heft and bulky shape.  A- A pour, swirl, and dump makes for a 1-1/2 finger, white head atop a cloudy, yellow body. There's moderate to heavy carbonation. The head falls to about a 1/2 finger before settling to thin, foamy film. There are awesome sticky spots and rings left on the glass.  S- Right away you get hit with the orange and corriander. It has plenty of the wheaty and yeasty characteristics that make for a pleasant, musty aroma. I'd call it a really ""soft"" scent, overall.  T- A great representation of the style. There's that wheaty/yeasty flavor that's quite refreshing. The spice gives a gentle jab throughout as the orange really comes through in the finish.  M- The moderate carbonation creates a slightly foamy feel. There's that chewy characteristic I expect from an unfiltered brew.  D- I haven't had one of these in a while. After finishing my first, I'm very tempted to crack another (and just might). It's a great warm/hot weather thirst quencher and works well as a morning/afternoon/session beer.  I consider this a benchmark for style. It's so hard to rate a beer that really defines the style (like Duvel's done for the Belgian Strong Pale). Are there things I might tweak? Sure. But what other beer jumps out at you when somebody says Witbeer?",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

83,248,zoso493,3.92,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pilsner glass.  Appearance: Pours a pale yellow color that is just a little bit too pale for me, but still has the right gist. Atop the beer, is a two-finger head that's all foam and which dissipates quickly, leaving no lacing as it goes.  Smell: Wheat is the predominant smell in this one, with some clove and just a touch of banana to be found behind all the weisse scents. There is a touch of graininess and I think the scent could do with a little more.  Taste: This a good tasting beer and bears a strong resemblance to a hefeweizen. It's not going to blow you away with flavor, but it's nicely put together with some nice weisse flavors, clove and banana.  Mouthfeel: I know the style calls for a lighter body but the mouthfeel is maybe just a touch too thin for me. It's still highly carbonated, though, and it goes down pretty smoothly.  Drinkability: This is a very nicely drinkable and pretty refreshing beer. It's very low in ABV and would make a nice beer to drink on a hot summer's day.

This beer pours a pale hazy yellow with light carbonation and looks like someone mixed lemonade with some soda water.  The nose is almost non existent but does have traces of lemon and some spices.  The taste is quite different than what I'm used to. It is quite fruity but with an artifical aftertaste that is pretty dry as well.

This beer had a strong clove flavor but not so overpowering that the delicate beer flavor was hidden. There is no bitter taste and the aftertaste is very pleasant. I was surprised at how pale in color it was. I tried it with both an orange and a lemon. The lemon was definitely more appropriate.  I really enjoyed this beer for it not being too sweet and for its spiciness. It is wonderfully unique that I will enjoy occasionally.

Poured into a bottle-sized Hoegaarden bucket glass. An opaque, light yellow brew, almost like white grapefruit juice. Despite following the bottle's instructions for pouring - the ol' pour, shake and pour - the foamy head didn't last long, nor did it leave much lacing.  The nose is a milder version of the usual witbier suspects: orange, lemon, banana, a bit of spice. Something oddly 'medical' in there.  The taste is light and refreshing, absolutely perfect in the summer. Citrus, banana, light cloves and spices.  Mouthfeel is a bit watery, with low-medium carbonation.  It's definitely not the primo example of the style, nor is it my favorite, but nothing beats this brew in the summertime.

Lower bitterness to this, with plenty of spice and dryness lingering on the palate for a good long while. The mouthfeel is light bodied, with a very smooth and easygoing nature to it, yet this still stays fairly crisp and lively in the mouth. That sub 5% ABV works just perfectly here.

83,248,medic25,4.1,"Served in an Ommegang Witte glass; pale golden color, hazy due to the yeast, with a thick white head. Lemony aroma, ""Belgian"" aroma for lack of a better description. Taste is a delicate wheat flavor, a little spicy with a bit of citrus. Mouthfeel is clean and fairly dry.

83,248,letzgo86,4,"Appearance: The bottle shape and label design is instantly attractive, and lets face it: Before you taste it, that's all you have to go on! When poured into a glass, the beer produces a decent creamy/foamy head. The beer itself is a translucent cloudy Wit that gives an attractive pale yellow/vanilla color; it visually invites you to drink it.  Smell: The smell matches the description the bottle provides-You can instantly smell the orange, lemon, and corainder which is refreshing and quite pleasant. It isn't overpowering.  Taste/Mouthfeel: The taste very closely matches the smell, which is welcoming. Quite refreshing, and relatively low carbonation allows you to drink without feeling bloated; this beer goes down quite easily! The mouthfeel is also intriguing, as it gives you an initial tartness/bitterness, but finishes smoothly, and somewhat sweet.  Drinkability: As I mentioned before, high drinkability due to the low carbonation mixed with the pleasant flavors and balanced mouthfeel.  Overall: Very enjoyable and drinkable beer. Some may consider it a ""summer"" beer, but as I drink/review this it is currently 22 degrees, and it tastes great!  Note: Forget the orange/lemon that some people add. This beer is tasty and complex enough without it!",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Head is rather minimal with no lacing. Looks like a good Belgian Wit.  S/T: The aroma is pretty typical for a Belgian Wit. Spice, citrus, and yeast. Taste is also very traditional. Very light, clean, and refreshing. Extremely balanced with the citrus and spice upfront. The yeasty and bready notes intermingle on the palate as well. Not the best Belgian Wit I have had, but very nice and balanced.  M/D: Very light bodied and extremely refreshing. I could slug these down on a hot summer day. Probably the best session beer I have had to date.  Not much else to say about this classic. Its one of the better Belgian Wits out there as it has a very nice and balanced flavor while remaining light and refreshing throughout.

D - Gives up a fullness for a beer, typical for its style. I wouldn't want to drink a bunch of them, but I love busting out the Hoegaarden when I want to fulfill that wit need.

Taste is light and spicy with a bit of citrus(orange), maybe some hints of clove, some occasional hints of banana. Mild pepperiness, maybe white pepper.

Once in the glass, I didn't smell that anymore. Smelled strongly of clove and coriander. Pretty potent nose on this one.

Thin watery mouthfeel with low to moderate carbonation. This is your prototypical witbier.

A: Cloudy yellow with a thick and heavily foamy white head which dissipates quickly.  S: Not as strong as Blue Moon, but noticeable citrus - a nice compliment to the flavor.  T: Very creamy for a wheat beer, with subtle hints of citrus, particularly lemon.  M: Very smooth, probably the smoothest beer I've had.

Appearance- Pours a cloudy yellow with a puffy whiteish head that is a little weak in the knees. It falls into a slick almost instantly. Very minimal lacing.  Smell- Smells like a proper witbier should. I am getting that wheaty, citrusy, and coriander blend.  Taste- For slightly light brew this packs a bunch of flavor. It packs all that witbier essence into a very drinkable concoction. The coriander and citrus notes are very prevelent.  Mouthfeel- Very clean and refreshing. It has a medium high to high carbonation to it which in the case of this beer works in it's favor.

Excellent depth of flavor for this style. Has a nice peppery flavor throughout, well balanced and slightly sweet with a dry finish.  Mouthfeel- Heavy for a witbier but not bad.

I haven't had this in so long that I forgot to swish the remaining 1/3 of the remains in the bottle, so I did not get the head I was expecting. Still an unique and appetizing brew.  S: Lemons and wheat with a peppery background with some hints of coriander. For such a light beer this has a relatively complex scent.  T: Such a refreshing brew. Citrus and wheat with a slight pepper background. The flavors are balanced admirably. For a relatively light beer with a complex taste, this is still quite a quaffable brew.  M: Moderate carbonation with a somewhat weak but creamy finish. This is definitely a beer that can be drank during a hot summer's day and be quite refreshing. Ironically, I'm drinking this during the beginning of winter. Go figure.  D: A beer that can be sessioned, but even without a high ABV, the somewhat complex taste might wear thin after awhile.

Using the specified swirl and pouring method displayed on the label, it presented a cap less than half a finger and was gone before I even took a sip... There is no lacing to be found at all. Even with an agitating swirl and slosh, nothing.  The aroma of this beer is a mixture of yeast, clove, slight banana and a little bit of citrus that is faint but I am guessing is the usual coriander and orange combo.  Taste includes all the aromas captured in the nose except the orange and coriander is a little more evident. Feel is light, carb is high and tingly on the tongue. Drinkability is great.

Aesthetically it appeared to be a bit thin, and head retention was mediocre at best.  There was no apparent aromas during the initial pouring process. After a swirl there is a peppery fragrance from the yeast that attacks the nostrils, the signature of a wheat beer. After the pepper starts to fade there is a hint of lemon, bringing back memories of Sam Adams Summer Ale.  The initial flavor of this beer is a pepper flavor that is common in this style of beer. This is followed up with an almost un-noticeable sour flavor that actually compliments the peppery tang of the yeast quite well. Several seconds after the initial mouthful there is a lingering bitter taste, reminding me of the taste after eating a sour patch kid.  Very pleasing mouthful, the carbonation is very typical of this style of beer and greatly balances the body, which is semi chewy, very much what I would expect of a wheat beer.  Overall a very drinkable beer for anyone, there is nothing harsh or flavor that stands out in this beer. There is a peppery flavor that is complimented by the texture and style of the beer.

83,248,jeranbrews,3.71,"Appearance - 1.5 fingers of bright marshmallow white head. Very cloudy. The color of the white mud around a thermal vent. Visible clumps of yeast in the clouds, but even after time has passed the cloud color remains. Head clings to the glass well about 2 sec.  Smell - This is by far the greatest point of this beer. As soon as your bring the glass to your nose you notice strong combinations of many smells Lavender, rose, magnolia, tangerine peel, and a bit of fruity hand soap. Strong yeast aroma and a mild malt aroma.  Taste - Initially a sweet sour yeasty taste. A bit of crystal malt. The balance isn't quite as nice as I'd like. The impressive barrage of smells initially leaves you thinking you will get an equally complex taste. But the tastes are more simple. The aftertaste reminds me of sweet-tart candy and lime.  Mouthfeel - Crystalline, almost gritty at moments. Crispy, tingly, medium average viscosity.  Drinkability - Great for dessert. This beer makes me think of vanilla ice cream with a slice of cake. The sourness of the beer would offset well right before or after dessert.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

83,248,MikeBrandman,3.96,"Heard plenty of good things about this beer. Plenty of hype for something this commonly available (got it at a grocer( made it impossible to pass up, even for about $11 for a 6 pack.  A - Yellow haze with a rich, white, 3 finger head. Pours with a great amount of carbonation and good amount of lacing. Looks tempting, but something about the color is a little offputting. Almost looks too yellow to be real.  S - Smells like bananas and alcohol. Interesting combo. Good amount of wheat and malt smell to it as well. Carbonation and rich head makes the aroma really stand out on this. However, the alcohol smell is really brings it down a notch.  T - Taste of bananas and wheat really pulls through. Almost enough to mask the alcohol, but still reminds you this is a beer, not a soda. Almost nutty taste too, maybe from the wheat. Good taste, just a few things could have made it better, namely masking more of the alcohol taste  MF - Great texture. Creamy from the unfiltered yeast, but smooth and bubbly from the carbonation. Compliments the flavor really well.  D - Good drinkability. Would have been better without the alcohol taste.  Maybe I'm a little soft, but the alcohol taste really stands out for a 4.9% ABV beer.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

The head is slow to fade and leaves nice lacing on the way down. S- The typical wit here, yeast, banana, candy, and a hint of some spices. I never get tired of smelling this beer. T- The bubble gummy candiness is pretty prevalent. Also there is some banana and a little bit of spice with some good yeasty background. This is my benchmark wit that I really compare all other to even though it is technically a macro. M- It is a thin bodied beer and I think could be a little heavier but then again that is why this is a great thirst quenching summer beer. D- This one goes down the same every time, great.

The ""wit"" part is quite obvious on this one. THe head is sticking around ok.  S: Wheaty and with a definite Belgian smell. No malt, maybe a little hops, but they're hidden. Also a little bit of spicyness. I can see why this beer is popular both with geeks and commoners alike. It's bold without being obscene.  T: Hmmm, at first touch it seemed like the taste bombed, it seemed like nothing was there. But there's something. Definite banana flavor, complimented by some spicey. No sweetness. It's a very smooth flavor, and consistant. I'm now about halfway through the beer and still getting the same flavors.  M: Smooth, even with a touch of sour. The sour maybe gives it just the slightest kick as it leaves the mouth. But all in all very light.  D: Sessionable for sure. Nothing stellar, nothing to keep louring you back, but sessionable.

The smell is slightly citrus, I suspect the hops are the cause of this. It's a subtle scent and quite pleasing. There are also some small hints of malt in the smell.  The taste is a bit of bitter malts and a slight balance of hops. I've tasted a bit better for this style. It's good, but not as good as I expected.

A minimal white head quickly turns to a light skim over the surface and a ring around the glass and leaves minimal lacing.  Nose is alot of spice profile and that classic belgian wheat yeast aroma. Coriander and orange peel like spices are prominent.  A nice soft classic witbier. Belgian yeast and citrus zest are the clear center of attention. A nice soft wheat flavor. The finish is crisp and provides some slight green apple and soft peach notes. Zest and yeast linger in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is slightly higher in carbonation than most belgian brews, but it works very well here, as it would in a hef.  Drinkability is quite solid. Could easily put down a sixer or more of these on a hot day, or just whenever.  Overall really a classic example of the witbier. As typical and common as it is, it really is nice for a drinkable wit. Nothing mind-blowing or crazy exciting, but just a solid, flavorful session beer.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

The coriander is complemented with a nice pepper tone. The citric notes from the smell are also present in the taste. Yeast is noticable as well as the wheat.  M: The aftertaste is rather short, some sweetness though. Medium body and a tickeling sencation from the small bubbles.  D: Nice, really nice refreshing summer beer.

83,248,PBoegel,4.27,"Simply what a Witbier should be.  There a dozens of American made (particularly at brewpubs) which hit to style as near 5.0 across the board, two versions from across the pond are considerably near perfect, the InBev controlled Hoegaarden and the Pierre Celis Signature White for St. Bernardus.  Not coincidentally Celis had his hand resurrecting Hoegaarden from certain extinction.  The style and this particular breweries version a perfect for quaffing on a warm summer day or as an aperitif for a fine meal.  The aromas are lemon and tangerine citrus with mild peppery notes from the fine yeast strain. Occasionally one can pick up some DMS characteristics, but they are slight and usually in my opinion a confused sense with the other spices and yeast character from the wheat and oats in the grist.  Refreshing and extremely drinkable this is a world classic that has not been beaten down by the bean counters quite yet. As a wit should an nice silky smooth mouthfeel. Delicious, if you don't like Witbiers, get into practice they are a great style.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Smell: very pleasing full-bodied wheat aroma with a slight hint of citrus and spice.  Taste: really delicious wheat taste with just the right amount of citrus tang. Not sure if they used coriander in this, but if they did, they limited it enough to not get that fruity Pebbles thing going on. Just spot-on for me.  Mouthfeel: relatively light body but the right amount of carbonation so it is very creamy. Love it!  Drinkability: I just bought one bottle of this but now I wish I'd bought a sixpack.

A - Light straw color and cloudy... when it tells you to swill the bottle its going to be cloudy. Small white puffy head that leaves decent lacing.  S - Heavy in the spice aroma. Assuming it is brewed in true style with coriander and bitter orange they steeped the coriander longer then I prefer.  T - The coriander is complimented well by the peppery yeast flavors and the light hops help balance it out.  M - Smooth and light with little aftertaste  D - Nice summer brew.

The smell of this wheat is what I love; a sweet smell with citrus and dancing notes of coriander.  The taste is different for first sip and all the rest.

83,248,laituegonflable,3.84,"Pours surprisingly fizzy, comes out very sparkling from the bottle, like a vaseline model's teeth. Champagne-coloured with a pleasant dusty haze through it, minimal but steady bead, but the notable exception here is the head. None. Very little lacing as well, quite a letdown for the Belgian team. Thank God for the cloud.  Nose is tangy, with a lot of citrus and a strong phenolic alcohol character, almost Cointreau-esque, really. Odd saltiness as well lingers at the back as well as a candy sweetness. Light herbal notes pepper the back, very grassy and coriander-blessed. Pleasant nose, seems different every time I sniff.  Taste is very citrusy, a lot of orange, mandarin and cumquat flavours, blending with a fresh organic funk and notes of a light herbal character - pleasant coriander with a slight capsicum touch to it. Taste is predominantly fruity, with the tart citrus notes dominating the front and more phenolic, juicy notes on the back. Does verge on too sweet. Light phenolic lick as it goes down, probably from the yeast - quite cagey and pleasant.  Mouthfeel is quite hot, as in spicy on the tongue, but with a nick slick body behind it.  I've always considered this the master of the wit, but it feels someone subdued, like I've been exposed to wild, untamed examples and this here seems too polite and mild. I can't mark it down though because it's well balanced and unpretentious, and very drinkable.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

S: Straight orange peel, lemon, coriander, and some wheaty tanginess.  T: The wheatiness of this brew is bolder than most in the style, almost to the point that it could qualify as a hefe-wit. I like the tanginess as it glides together cohesively with the lemon zest and orange peel flavors which coexist cleanly and distinctly. The coriander note is also more prominent than many other highly-regarded wits (see Allagash White, Southamptom Double White), but I like the more heavy-handed flavoring in this brew. Clean aftertaste of citrus and coriander. More wheaty but still possesses the ethereal, estery quality of a good witbier.  M: The feel is exceedingly crisp and body is firm medium. Carbonation is right on par, right in the middle, and the sum is very quenching.  D: A really, really good witbier that brings more flavor to the table, mainly in the vein of wheaty tanginess, which seems to not do as well with BAs.

Mouthfeel is nice and silky, with a creamy body that is also light bodied and refreshing. This beer was on tap at a restaurant below my hotel room when I went to on vacation, and it was all I had for the 4-5 times I went there. Never got tired of this beer, and it was very versatile with the food served there.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,secondtooth,3.33,"Pours a faint, pale, opaque yellow-gold, with a rich and immaculate white head. No lace, though, oddly.  Nose is spicy sweet and lager grainy, with hints of orange and a little spice.  I get plenty of light citrus/orange hints among a little spice and a little wheat maltiness. Not a bad beer, but just somewhat thin on both body and taste.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,solstarr,3.88,"The head of the beer wasn't very thick, and it dissipated rapidly. It consisted of very tight bubbles, and there was an effervescence of bubbles from the bottom of the glass similar to champagne. It is a cloudy, light amber color.  There is not a very pronounced smell to this Hoegaarden, but there are easily detectable smells of grain and yeast.  Upon sipping I get a burst of flavor on my lips, tip of my tongue and gums right behind the teeth. With slow, measured sips the Hoegaarden moves around my mouth, and I can feel the carbonation kick in and boost the flavor by sending smells up the back of my throat and into my nose. The beer finishes with a pleasant bitter flavor on the back of the palate/throat. There is a not unpleasant tingling left in the mouth after swallowing. If consumed more quickly the carbonation doesn't build and all that is experienced is a nice sip of beer with a bitter remnant on the back of the throat.  Hoegaarden has a very slick mouthfeel and it slides very easily around my mouth. If the beer is held in the mouth for a moment the carbonation really kicks in and gives the beer a totally different mouthfeel - it builds foam and tingles the tastebuds.  I think this beer is very drinkable - particularly when consumed quickly without pondering the taste. When enjoyed as most people enjoy beer, it is very crisp and clean with a nice beer flavor left in the mouth.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Oranges and a hint of spice. A little bit sweet.  Sweet bread and tangy lemon continue on the palate. Slightly peppery. If this were a hefe instead of a wit, I'd swear I caught a little bit of banana in there. Very mild bitterness toward the finish. Orange comes forward as it warms up.

Sweetness, coriander, and citrus notes are very bold in this whitbier.  M- Very light carbonation, almost creamy. The best attribute of this brew in my opinion.

The banana is missing, which I always like in a wheat brew, but coriander adds spice.  Taste: Again, more than what I was expecting. The wheat is prominent, and the lemon citrus from the smell is replaced with a slightly tart orange. The coriander spice also comes through in the tail.  Drinkability: The drinkability is high.

83,248,BeerBelcher,3.56,"How is it possible that I've been rating beer this long, but I've yet to rate this beer? I know Pierre Celis is some sort of beer luminary who revived the witbier style. But, now there's so much more to the story...Pierre Celis's Texas brewery sort of sucked, now that beer is brewed in Michigan (it still sort of sucks), Pierre is in his mid-80's, and now the witbier is a style that has been sort of over-done into an entry-level craft beer targeting light beer drinkers and a female palate by the likes of Blue Moon and Spotted Cow. So where does that leave Hoegaarden?  It's pretty good! Definitely not over-done, it is superlative in some pretty subtle ways. It isn't overly sweet like some American imitators, it is brightly yellow with a nice meringue head. Aroma and flavor is slightly sweet with a pleasing amount of Coriander and I dare say offer something that I think is wheatiness. Pretty good, but probably better a generation ago...the same way the first DIPA must've been revolutionary...now that every craft brewer has one, I'm a little less impressed.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

The taste isn't overally sweet as I perhaps expected from the smell, it's actually a slight bit tart, but the overwhelming flavor profile is a mix of a lot of orange and spice character here. The finish has little hop presence at all and has a lingering of the oranges and spices on the tongue. This is definitely a wit that has chosen the oranges over tartness, that's for sure.  Despite the fact it isn't all that tart, it is very clean and gives no cloying sweeetness on the finish. If anything, a little spice seems to hang around a bit but not for long.

It hits the back of your mouth first with the citrus taste. The label lists orange peel and I almost taste the dryness of the peel rather than the pulp of the fruit.  No lacing.

On the nose one is presented with a very sharp pull of wheat and the strong presence of citrus--mainly orange. There are also hints of clove and spices. Very fresh aroma.  The taste is relatively tart with a nice fresh wheat presence. There is a good deal of citrus (orange and lemon) acidity. A bit of peppery bite at the finish as well. There is a lot going on here. Despite the host of flavors, Hoegaarden's mouthfeel is pretty thin, though there is some sharpness. Pretty high carbonation.  Overall, this is a pretty drinkable beer.

I am never crazy about the smell, kind of citrusy with a hint of orange and bananna.  All that goes out the window when you take a sip, or more likely a huge gulp. This beer is so drinkable and with the low ABV is a great afternoon beer. They don't fill you up and you can still function after a few.

This beer arrives on the bar in a monstrously solid broad rimmed 'pint' glass, the kind I would want in any kind of bar/street fight, for sho. The cute and earnest bartendress noted its heftiness by proclaiming that 'you know it's a German beer, when the glass is so big!' Anyways, it appears a rather cloudy medium golden yellow hue, with one finger (easily two on a standard vessel) of puffy, and pleasantly creamy dirty white head, which leaves no lacing as it recedes.  It smells of grainy pale malt, light unripe banana esters, mild muddled citrus, white pepper, and yeast. The taste is more gritty bananas, sort of marshmallow-esque in their bearing, plain pale wheat malt, aerosol creamy citrus, a hint of indistinct clove/coriander spice, and earthy, dry yeast.  The carbonation is quite soft and frothy, the body a decent medium weight, perhaps a touch mealy, but generally smooth. It finishes off-dry, moderately fruity, and yeasty, as ever was.  Quite refreshing, overall, and decently balanced for your summer drinking needs.

The review is essentially the same, but I found the aroma and flavor, while basically the same, to be a little lighter than I recalled. The balance is just a little off because the hops aren't as prevalent as well. Otherwise it's the same, and still a good brew.  This one pours a hazy pale golden-yellow; label explains that the haze is a natural effect, since it's an unfiltered brew. There is actually a little improvement in head retention and lacing than I got from the bottle. On the nose is lemon with some light, zesty spices and a yeast / wheat smell. It's not as strong as I got from the bottle, though. From what I've read and tried thus far, this one's very true to its style, though perhaps with a bit stronger lemony sourness. A wheat twang, coriander with some other gentle, peppery spice, and zesty citrus flavors of lemon and orange peel are most strongly on the tongue. The hops bitterness is less pronounced that I remember. An obvious herbal flavor lingers on the tongue and the finish ends drier. Again, the flavors are the same but not as strong as I enjoyed from the bottle. The mouthfeel is more of a smooth than a crisp, though it is that to a point.

The rich frothy collar rests atop the yellowish cloudy brew and suggests a white aurora towards the bottom of the pint glass. Aromas are reminiscent of orange Creamsicle, coriander, and some faint Big League Chew original bubblegum in the back. Citrus (lemon and orange) flavors mix, pale wheat, and clean hop tinge create a wonderful and refreshing beer, perfect for a wedding or a day in the backyard with friends.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,drunkboxer1,3.97,"Had on tap with some frenchfries. Pours a hazy yellow color with no head. Lots of Lacing. Smells nice, a lot of yeasty esters and citrus. Definitely some coriander. Tastes like it smells -the yeast shines thru and there's a lot of character from the wheat malt. The high carbonation makes it refreshing and very drinkable.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,Shikitohno,3.42,"Hoegaarden was my first foray into Belgian white ales, and I rather like it. It's a wee bit light for my tastes, but still manages to be a flavourful drink. It pours out with a moderate head, most of which goes away fairly quickly. Some remains for most of the time you drink, however.  Upon sniffing it, there's definitely a note of citrus in the odour. There's also this vague scent I find somewhat characteristic of white ales. It has a sweet taste, with a hint of spice. Unfortunately, the citrus seems to be more prominent in the scent than the taste, as I notice it only very occasionally.  Hoegaarden is also a very light beer. It's not very filling, so it doesn't take much to knock a couple back, unless you've got some food around. Even though I haven't got one of the Hoegaarden glass, I must say that it's key to have some sort of glass, otherwise the sediment makes the last sip gross. Of course, I know someone who enjoys the taste, but it makes me cringe every time I forget about it and drink a bottle without thinking.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

83,248,Offa,4,"This is a good witbiers, but it's a style which I often find tiresome and this beer, too can get very tiresome.  Gold, slightly hazy, it has a medium white head that dissipates steadily to a thin, permanent foamy top.  The aroma is pleasant and interesting, among the better witbier aromas out there: wheat, grass, banana, hints of citrus zest, flowers, orange juice, and banana. It is stronger in the grain and wheat than many witbiers.  The taste is also good, dry but not overly dry, a bit fruity or perfumy without being overly so, very light citrus or banana qualities, with a hint of 7-up. The feel is a bit zesty and tingly.

A: Pours a not very attractive murky yellow (Keep in mind this is unfiltered) with a lovely, solid, white head which rapidly dissipates into a thin but ever present foam. Mild lacing.  S: Sweet citrus and pale wheat hit the nose first. Coriander, white wine, and apples make their way up after stirring the beer a bit and exciting the volatiles. Lastly a hint of alcohol wafts around the glass.  T: It has a yeasty unfiltered taste with zest and wheat first. This soon turns into a slightly spicey/herby taste (Brewed with coriander) with a sublte hop bitterness then ending with dry, tart, apples.  M: Effervescent, however not crisp. A gentle amount of carbonation, but I wouldn't mind more to keep the beer interesting.  Overall a well balanced beer, very drinkable, perfect to cool off but lacks body and intensity.

T: Following the taste buds, lays down a nice ground flavor of straw and banana in the initial taste. Transitions to a sweet and sour blend of orange and lemon in the mid-taste. The finish sees an introduction of spicy coriander, with a little tingle into a sweet finish.  M: Light-bodied, with crisp and active carbonation that supports the style well.

Just the appearance and smell alone were enough to make me want to drive right in.  Taste - Smacks you in the face with some hops and wheat at first drink. Afterward you are left with a nice smooth mellow taste.  Mouthfeel - Aftertaste is practically non existent. It's a very smooth brew.

Aroma was banana, orange, cloves and lemon. Mouthfeel was much thinner than I thought it would be with little carbonation. Taste was like the nose, adding some along with hard sugar candy sweetness. Drinkability is low. Overall this is a mediocre beer which I did not particularly enjoy. I feel it does not exemplify the style. There was no crispness as there is in other wits I have tried, just a syrupy candy sweetness. Maybe it has something to do with it being on tap.

More of the same on the palate; orange peel and spice are lurking there somewhere, but the wheat and yeast are so prominent as to take on an almost soapy character.

I couldnt understand him so i pointed and said Hoegaarden referring to the tap handle. He asked in english small or large and of course i said large. It cost me 7.00(euro) which is about 10 bucks. Kinda steep but it was worth it i was worth it. I fell in love with craft beers then.  A- not as pristine as a perfectly poured hoegaarden, but extra cloudy. Thick white head that didnt seem to go away the whole way down.  S- wheaty yeasty smell, maybe the corriander scent is what gives it its defferent aroma. Non comparable to a bottle.

Pours a hazy straw colour with about a finger and a half creamy white head. Decent retention and decent lacing. Some sediment is visible and rising with the carbonation. I'm not a big fan of that, but doesnt take away from the beer. Smell is a bit milder than I hoped; banana upfront, clove and spice backing it up. Taste identical to the smell with a bit of a buttery finish. Carbonation is really nice; nothing too offensive.  This mild, fairly watered down witbier makes it perfect for a large target audience. There was nothing bad about this beer, but at the same time, nothing really jumped out to distinguish it from others. On the other hand, it's very refreshing and definately sessionable.

This beer has the expected unflitered cloudy appearance with a nice creamy white head and some lacing, and the smell is of some orange and coriander. The taste (not to be ruined by an orange slice) is a delightful mix of the smells. You cannot taste any alcohol in this beer. This beer can be quite dangerous as it is very, very drinkable.

Compared to Allagash White this is thinner and has a MUCH more prominent fruit essence. I would drink this over AW any day; I noticed a weird iron flavor to the Maine brew.  Open it up, pour it into a hexagonal glass (remembering to do that ""3/4-empty swirl"" near the end) the beer is a white color made slightly strawlike from the malt. The head is pure virgin white.  Smell is a benchmark for European White ales. It's mainly the wheat malt plus a ton of oranges and lemons, but together it works so perfectly. I wish I could get it in a Yankee Candle CarJar.  I've drank well over 400 beers (so I guess that makes me a newbie, hahaha) and a lot of that was focusing on the wheat beers. I've drank them from Belgium, Germany, USA, France, England... and Hoegaarden is my favorite taste:-) The taste comprises of an intense sweetness that isn't syrupy whatsoever and clean as the driven snow, then *BAM* the lemon/orange flavors hit. Some complain of a lack of hops in this beer. Who the hell wants hops in a white ale? I love IPAs and barleywines but I understand that whites aren't supposed to be hoppy. Instead, the orange, coriander and lemon are the ""spice"" of Hoegaarden.  Drinkability is dangerous, because you can pound these for hours and get wasted- and fat- quite easily.

This is a very good witbier, and is extremely drinkable. I know that a lot of people would disagree with me, but I don't really think that this is far superior to Blue Moon. It's certainly better, but it doesn't blow it out of the water. I personally feel that they are both exactly what I am looking for when I drink a witbier, light, crisp and refreshing.

Mouthfeel: Light, highly carbonated... maybe too much? or maybe the carbonation feels like its too much since I burned my mouth eating fresh pizza.

The beer pours a slight half inch, bubbly head.  The beer has a spicy, citrus smell to it. Brewed with corriander, and orange this beer provides a zesty mix, and hearty example of a witbier.  The beer mixes spice and citrus well. Garnished with a wedge of lemon/orange provides an additional flavor that seems to awaken all of the dormant citrus character.  The mouthfeel is nothing impressive, but it does manage to move well in the mouth.  The beer has an easy level of drinkability to it. It can easily be enjoye, and provides an excellent stepping stone into the consumption of witbiers.  Final Thought - Definitely a popular brew that deserves a look. Great flavor, and easy accesibility means more people should give this a shot.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,fullsweep,3.8,"330 mL bottle poured into a glass.  Smell is unusual (although this was my first witbier), with some slightly sour notes and some sweet grainy aroma as well.  Thick white head sits atop a very cloudy, very pale shade of beer, similar in color to the non-alcoholic beverage, ginger beer.  Taste is pleasant--a sweet/sour (only slightly) flavor, with mild hints of grapefruit bouncing off the grains.  Very nice.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,biegaman,3.75,"An anemic, sickly yellow that is just about as pale as any beer will ever be, the bottom section appears just like squeezed lemon juice. The haze (which is to be expected for the style) blurs transparency but doesn't obstruct all clarity. The head is generally bound and in abundance but this particular sample leaves a bare center and less than thorough lace.  The smell is of a zingy, zesty orange peel with crisp straw, grass and hay to back it. This sour lemon scent is a far departure from the sweet, sometimes caramelized malts of your typical ale. This has a peppery spice (or more accurately, coriander spice) and a tangy, acidic, fruity persona that typifies the witbier. This isn't the best smelling example I've come across but it's a safe bet that if you don't like the smell of this you probably won't like the style as a whole.  The taste is quite dry and very upfront with the things it should be upfront about: stale coriander and dried orange peel that combine for a spicy, zesty, zingy taste. The predominance of wheat rather than barley is quite a contrast. If you've never tried a witbier before be prepared for something different. I find Hoegaarden fairly tasty (especially for a macro offering) but I can think of a number of others I'd favour having in place of it.  Hoegaarden was the first beer witbier launched to market since before the Great War. Considering it reintroduced the style and succeeded in reinstating witbier's rightful place in Belgium's beer culture. Eventually, it would inspire a generation of ambitious craft brewers from all over the world and turn an entire generation onto this zesty, fruitier wheat based style of beer. For all this it deserves full credit.  That being said, this itself isn't the beer it used to be since being bought out and commercialized by giant mega-conglomerate InBev. I won't take away from what InterBrew has done to pry the witbier style into mainstream beer culture but just as much praise (if not more) is due to the man actually from the town of Hoegaarden, the man originally responsible for the recipe: Pierre Celis. If you like this beer than do yourself a favour, take the next step, read up on and seek out the St. Bernardus Pierre Celis Signature Witbier.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

I refuse a lemon with this, its not needed. Nice smooth mouthfeel. Can drink plenty of these at a session. This is what a Wit should be. Clean and smooth to drink with a great wheaty/citrus kick. Perfect summer beer.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,TheHammer,3.98,"Appearance - Came in a nice, Hoegaarden glass that I'd consider buying myself and a slice of orange. Odd cloudy pale yellow/white color that almost made it look like a smoothie. Has a good inch of head that both laced and sustained well. I think a bit of cloud is suppose to be normal for this style, but I don't think that much. That's really my only complaint.  Smell - Citrus like with Lemon and Orange smell, mixed with banana, coriander and hints of wheat in the background. It smells inviting but it is a little bit too subdued. Still, for the most part it is pleasant.  Taste - Starts with a citrus like, unsurprisingly but light and doesn't get carried away with it. Then turns into a wheaty beer with traces of sweet barley. Finishes off with a slight spice of coriander and a smooth refreshing taste that does not linger. A bit on the sweet side, but not overdone.  Mouthfeel - Aftertaste is practically non existent. Not very carbonated but that is good considering how sweet it is. Head sustains very well, and is quite smooth. My only problem with it is near the bottom of the glass, I seem to be getting an unappealing grainy/citrus fruit pulp.  Drinkability - It goes down smoothly and is light on the stomach. However this beer is a bit sweet and off the beaten path. This beer doesn't really go well with food, nor does is it something I could drink all night at anything but a coco cabana. It's a nice change of pace for sure though, and is good for the summer or if you only want one beer.  Final Thoughts - As my first Witbier, I was impressed. Yes the flavor is a bit strange, but I enjoyed it up till the very end (when I got a mouthful of pulp). Frankly, I'm shocked that this beer comes from Belgium, as I'd expect it to come from a tropical location given the flavor. I'd get it again on tap if I wanted something weird or something fruity to cool me down in the summer, but I wouldn't buy a case of it though.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Taste - Tart citrus. Almost lemon. Then some real funk. Lots of those spice notes as well. Pretty sweet overall. Almost like cloves, sort of peppery as well. Pretty well balanced, but missing a little something.  Mouthfeel - Very nice carbonation. Very crisp and smooth. I love the way this dances on my tongue.

M: Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with a sharp and aggressive hop spiciness.  D: With a modest ABV and a formula tested by time, Hoegaarden is considered to be the ultimate Belgian wit. That said, I do find some American versions to be a bit more palatable and complex, boasted heartier malts and smoother balances of spiciness.  Wish I had my hexagonal glass with me for this one.

Over the past year I've learned top enjoy the light, spicy nature and the yeast like flavor... (at least I perceive it that way)  The beer was served in the classic Hoegaarden glass. No head at all... Cloudy light yellow in color.. with no lacing at all. Beer was too cloudy to detect visible carbonation.  Aroma was of clove, lemon, a bit earthy.. yeast like and some light fruit.  Flavor was coriander, light citrus..(lemon) slight white pepper, subtle sweetness and other fruits.. slight earthy/sour flavor from the yeast... obviously a Belgian flavor comes from the yeast used. I can see why this is popular in the summer. Of course, I'm drinking it on a January night.. Quite crisp and refreshing. Slightly tart/sour... but not too much...  Mouth feel is decidedly light bodied and delicate. Total summer session beer.  Very drinkable... I turned down the slice of fruit... Ugh...

There is a definite kick of fruit in the taste. Now I can distinguish the orange peel. Hoegaarden gives you that acidity that I had expected with the citrus flavor.

The Hoegaarden has a nice mouthfeel - bubbly, but not overly so, and not too heavy. I liken it to a heavy champagne feel. It was sweet on the swallow, and the aftertaste was the same until about a minute later when it turned bitter. I caught a distinct flavour of fruit, although it wasn't orange I have to admit. After the sip, the head dissipated to about 1/8 inch.  Here's the kicker: the flavour didn't change after that first sip. I didn't find any improvement or backsliding, and even the head stayed about the same. I took about 20 minutes to drink this beer, and throughout the experience I didn't find any development. This would be fine if Hoegaarden was outstanding, but I don't think it is. I was slightly disappointed - I had hoped it would develop more through the session. This may be an issue of white beers and my own taste, but I finished the beer without being too impressed. I expected more out of it, to be honest.

83,248,nd5282,3.43,A light and citrusy white beer with a hefty amount of spice mainly apparent in the after taste. This beer was very easy to drink and came in a thoughtfully designed bottle and six pack holder. The bulb at the neck of the bottle helped to ensure a better pour and the top of the six pack holder provided the phonetic spelling of Hoegaarden to help with pronunciation. The attention to detail and thought put into this beer is top notch.,Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,nothingxs,4.18,"Bought this at a local Publix in Miami in my quest to find beer I'll like, since I'm new to it in general -- but boy did I pick right.  A: Was headier than my first beer, about almost half an inch (1cm?) or so of foam that settled quick. Pale, golden and hazy. Little bits of yeast floating about. A bit bubbly.  S: Smelled a bit fruity, very light. Like orange, maybe? I'm bad at smelling things.  T: My untrained palate didn't detect much of a wheaty taste in this one (I noticed one in Shock Top, in comparison); however, there was a light citrusy taste that I could feel in my entire time drinking it. Very refreshing and enjoyable.  MF: I'll be honest -- the first few times I had it (this rating is for my third, one every other day this week), it was a little bitter. But now it starts off just slightly bitter and smooths out quickly. Good amount of carbonation in the beer, not as much as the only others I've had. Surprisingly light to me considering what I've had before.  D: At first it wasn't much for me, but now that I've had a few more and let things grow on me, I've established it's fantastic. Tasty, smooth, I'd have a few of these in one sitting.  Take my opinion with a grain of salt, since this is literally my official ""third"" beer (not counting whatever I had when I lived in Mexico) since I've been searching for something I'd like. I'd definitely buy this again, and I plan on bringing it whenever someone asks me to bring drinks to a getty again.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Beautiful hazy yellow color, small particles of yeast floating throughout.  S - Smells of wheat and citrus fill my nose with this beer, pretty pleasent.  T - One of the greatest parts of this beer, very tasty and very wheaty, love the aftertaste.  M - This bottle didn't seem to have too much carbonation since I didn't get much head but it seems very carbonated when in the mouth, interesting, but still enjoyable.  D - Pretty good drinkability, I could enjoy a six pack in one sitting, really good taste and not too heavy.  Still one of the better belgian witbiers.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Usual wheat beer smells with some spice, not much coming through on the hop or malt side.  First taste is of light malts with some spice, clove or allspice. Pretty much typical witbier taste. Nothing out of the ordinary.  Mouth feel is light and smooth , slightly watery. Not too over carbonated, Easy on the palette  Beer is very session able , easy to drink.

Smell is very fruit. Main smell is bananas. Taste is similiar, but there is more of a hoppy taste involved.  Mouthfeel isn't very pleasent. Starts out bitter and then eventually ends smooth after a while.  Overall, it is a decent brew for something so popular.

I'm not convinced that Hoegaarden, Stella and Leffe really qualify as best of Belgium, but still, can't complain about beer as a gift.  A: Typical somewhat hazy yellowish white with a fluffy two finger white head that fades to a decent film with monster lacing. Plenty of small bubbles rising from the bottom.  S: A bit of crisp wheat a malt is quickly overpowered by a big hit of coriander, cloves and citrus peel. Smell is spicy and sweet overall.  T: Clean malt/wheat bill...the spices are more subdued in the taste than the smell, but pretty much the same idea. Maybe a bit more orange peel in the flavor. Nothing overpowering.  MF: Thin and perhaps a bit watery. Quite bubbly, but a good level of carbonation for this style. A touch of warming but really not much to speak of.  D: Good drinkability, the flavor is nothing out of the world but it's solid. Tastes fine without adding any oranges, which makes it better than Blue Moon at any rate.

83,248,SmokeMonkey,4.57,"i love this beer. the only complaint i have about this beer is the price.  it smelled nice when it was in the bottle and smelled great after i poured it. it smelled crisp, kind of acidic, a hint of citrus, a smidge of yeast.  it looked good and a smidge darker than i was expecting, it gave me the appearance of having more substance than other wits ive had (blue moon and sunset wheat). nice and cloudy, i swirled to get the yeast out of the bottom of the bottle and made the beer a little darker. head was small and disappeared pretty quick.  the taste reflected the look and smell, kind of citrusy, crisp, hoppiness was very low IMO. a smidgen of acidity which i really like. not sure i really tasted any spice, if i do its VERY subtle. alcohol didnt seem to stand out much at all to be honest, its stealthy. not as yeasty as i was expecting. the sediment didnt seem gritty on the palate either, a plus for me.  mouthfeel was good, didnt seem watery at all. carbonation was very good, not too much and not too little either, no CO bite but did fizz on the tongue. aftertaste was virtually non existent.  i could drink this all day long every day if it were not for the cost. its very drinkable.  it costs too much to be an every day beer but it is a very good beer and im glad i bought it. i'd buy this again and probably will in the future.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Some pungent spice, probably the customary corriander/orange, but it's quite subdued. Overall clean and crisp, slightly tangy/tart/acidic.  Mouthfeel is on the light side for a wheat beer, but fuller than your average light lager.

Appearance: Pours a light cloudy straw color, with a moderate stark white cap which sticks around for a bit. Tiny bits of yeast in suspension.  Smell: Citrusy, quite fruity, and a little tart, with nice coriander notes as well.  Taste: Lemony tartness combined with a mild sweetness and spice and Belgian yeast. Almost a hint of bubblegum in there as well, which kind of surprised me. Much drier and more tart than Blue Moon or a lot of the American takes on the style.  Mouthfeel: Quite crisp and refreshing.  Drinkability: I could put this away all night.

83,248,yesyouam,4.46,"Hoegaarden is a hazy, pale pearish yellow beer with a small, airy head that quickly dissipates. It looks quite lively and has nice dense lacing. The bouquet is spicy and citrusy. It smells a lot like starfruit and coriander. The sweet fruity tone rings like a bell. It's so smooth and solid in the nose. It's smooth and foamy in the mouth. It's on the light side of medium-bodied. Refreshing and soothing. It has a dry finish. The tart, fruity tone of the yeast hands things off to the sour dough malt and then to the lemony hops. A sweetness lies beneath Wow! It's smooth, assertive, quenching and clever. It's so easy to punish pitchers of this! This is what a Witbier should taste like!

T: The taste is very similar to the smell. Lots of citrus, yeast, and coriander... there's even almost a minty flavor in there somewhere. The taste is far superior on tap, so get it there if you can. However, if you get a bottle, make sure you pour it right!  M: This beer is exceptional on the tongue; it's light, but still has some substance. The yeast really lends this beer some extra character, very happy to see they didn't clean filter it.  D: This is honestly one of the more drinkable beers for me, especially on tap.

Hint of citric oils/orange. Doughy taste, again with a hit of tangy orange, which makes for an interesting experience. For some reason boiled vegetables came to mind while drink this beer, which was a little off-putting. Flows round the mouth smoothly with notifiable carbonation.

The creamy white head has delicious aromas of cloves, bananas, and lemon citrus. It tastes initially tart and then sweetens to light grains, citrus fruit, and spices.

The color of the ber is light/pale straw. There is a faint cloudiness that is typical of Belgian White beers. Overall quite interesting, if not a little light in color.  Smell: The odor has a typical wheaty fullness. Perhaps a little ""bready"" but not over powering. From the aroma, one expects a flavor light on hops but heavy on grain.  Taste: Wheaty white beer fullness. There is perhaps a faint banana or light citrus touch. The flavor curve is a little sharp on the front end and tapers fairly quickly. The overall presence if not forceful but there is a little initial zing. This is an easy brew to drink.  Mouthfeel: Very pleasant taste. The bready/wheaty presence is soft but not delicate. I liked this brew.  Drinkability: Overall this is a quite pleasant beer. It would go well with pork or just about any white meat. Alone, this is an ""easy"" beer and is quite acceptable for serving to guests. It sits light on the stomache and leaves the drinker wanting another. :-) And isn't that the whole goal of a brewer?

That was even before I found about BA and started to become a beer geek. Now on to review an old favorite...  Poured from a classy bottle... I love the silver logos and multiple ""coat of arms"" logos, even imprinted in the glass. Color is a very pale yellow that seems clear up close but cloudy from an arms length. I don't know what causes that. Lively carbonation bubbles rise continuously. Don't pour this one too fast, an extremely white head starts out tall, but falls fairly fast and leaves just traces of lacing.  Aromas are strong and unique. Lots of coriander and spice, with some citrus and maybe just a bit of wheat grains in there. Also noticing some fruity/spicy/funky yeast aromas that are also there in the flavors.  I like complexity in flavors of beer, and this one does that well, without going overboard on any one. I think the malts could be beefed up a little bit, but I still detect some wholesome grains along wiith the abundant spice, citrus and yeast flavors going on.  Carbonation is lively and matches the light, airy flavors very well. Makes this a very refreshing beer with a pleasing, lingering coriander aftertaste.  Way drinkable, especially on hot days. Today was cold and rainy, but I still enjoyed it. My local grocery store has this beer for only $7.99 for a sixer, which seems like a great deal to me. Nearby on the shelf is Corona for $8.69.

Out of the bottle the liquid was a milky, straw gold color with a bright white head. The foam both retained and laced well throughout. The aroma was classic, orange zest, coriander and tangy wheat. The flavors were similar, though the first taste was floral hops and malt sweetness followed by the curacao orange zest and lemon flavors as well as coriander and cloves.

No astrigency at all.  4.0 M: Medium body, really smooth, good amount of carbonation.  4.0 D: Not bad at all, but not all that exciting.

Smell of very strong banana and clove. Can smell the wheat. Very sweet smelling. A little strong for my liking.  Taste is a little more balanced for a witbier. Some of the others I've tried were a little too tart. This one doesn't have that tangy tart tast which is nice. I can taste the wheat for sure. Not bitter, not sweet; just kinda there.  Creamy mouthfeel. Drinkable brew considering the style, but I just can't take the smell. Smell effects taste, and this one ruins it.

The taste is also dominated by the coriander which gives it a little too much spice. The balance of the tartness of the lemony citrus is thrown off because of it.

Initial ingestion yields coriander with clove and some mild other spices. Orange peel is also lightly present.  Smooth with medium carbonation.  Very tasty brew.

I bought a 12 pack of the stuff in bottles. I poured it (as directed on the bottle, lol) and was left with a nice gold coloured beer with a nice head on it. Took one sip of it and was like, wow, this is what a belgian white should taste like. Totally blows blue moon out of the water, maybe even into outer space. Mouthfeel is exceptional.

The taste of wheat was there & the finish was kind..not too bitter. Mouthfeel was good too...creamy & not too carbonated. Drinkability: not really a session beer for me due to the spices feel, but definately a nice beer I very much enjoyed. A 'try something different' beer for sure.

Its creamy and the citrus is rather gentle, balancing well with the coriander spices and the wheat. Light and refreshing.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, I usually swirl this around in my mouth for a little bit to get all the flavors.  Overall a very drinkable beer, but its much more than that. The mouth feel and taste are excellent and it goes down very smooth. I know some bars put a wedge of lemon in it, but I usually have mine straight up. And if you get it in a bottle, pour it.

It is the witbier by which I judge all others. With that in mind, my review follows.  It is a light hazy golden yellow color. Hazy enough to nearly be opaque. It reminds me of a wheat field on a nice summer day. It's minimal head doesn't stay around long, at all.  Smells of spicy citrus notes. Little yeasty bread-like notes in there, too. Not much else, just keep it simple.  Taste is very good, indeed. The not quite sweet citrus flavors are so finely balanced by the spiciness of the coriander that this is harmony in a glass. Light yeast notes follow along bringing a delicate banana flavor to round out the end.  Very good creamy mouthfeel, here. This wouldn't work without the proper carbonation level and fortunately, this has it.  For me, this is a great session beer. Nice and easy to drink with a moderate enough ABV level. It would score a 5.0 for this except that it runs about $10 a 6-pack, so you have to kind of monitor your intake, for financial reasons. (Someday, when I win the lottery, I'll bathe in this stuff.)

Light and clean malt character with the straw and bread-dough yeast characters common with Belgian suds.  Easygoing mouthfeel with a gentle carbonation, soft viscosity, and slight fizz at the end.

Taste is similar to the aroma. Starts off with some sweet wheat flavors then the coriander and some phenolics kick in and it ends up finishing dry.

Smell is crisp; and by that I mean not too sweet or overwhelming, but very enticing...definitely not an overpowering sweetness that turns me off about some wheat beers.  Taste is on the clean side for a witbier. Same wheaty, yeasty flavors as in the aroma, slight taste of orange, maybe even lemon zest, and some spices. Finishes crisp with just a slight hoppiness that gives this beer a nice balance.  This beer is extremely drinkable...light, yet flavorful, a great easy-to-find choice for the warm summer months.

A- Nice translucent golden yellow beer with a light foamy white head that stuck around for a few minutes after pouring.  S- Sweet orange peal and coriander with a hint of light fruityness.  T- The orange peal and coriander really stand out in this brew along with the sweetness of the malts. The hops are completely overshadowed with only a tad astringent bite at the very end.

D- This is an easy brew to drink but the spices added to beers like this prevent me from haveing more then one or two at a time.

It's as close to a white ale as I've seen. Tall 2-finger foamy white head that stays around pretty well. Few foamy bits of lacing left on the glass during consumptions. Some yeast sedmient left in the bottle after pouring. Overall a beautiful-looking brew.  S: Lots of spice (coriander), clean, soft wheat malt, breadiness, a hint of hay, and very,very light citric (orange) notes.  T: A clean, unbelieveably soft wheatiness, like a wheat pillow on your tongue. Moves into a bit of coriander and spice before ending with soft wheat flavors, and a hint of lemon/orange rind. Definitely above average for the style.  MF: As I've said, very soft due to the wheat and yeast combo, but can get a touch spicy from the coriander. Decently well carbonated, as you'd expect from a bottle-conditioned beer. You'll either love the softness or hate it, I feel it's far better than average.  D: The beer is soft, smooth, and highly drinkable. I would have liked more character from the citrus and a tad more spiciness, but the cleanness of the wheat itself defines drinkability. Very good for the style, I've had the high-and-mighty st. bernardus wit, and find few differences between it and hoegaarden.

Small globs of thin lacing remained on the glass only momentarily before sliding down to rejoin their brethren. Personally I prefer slightly more body in appearance to my wits. The smell is nice, reminding me of straw and flaked oats. The coriander and curacao are prominent with maybe a slight phenolic edge at the end. This beer tastes similar to its smell, opening with light straw and wheat before moving on to coriander and curacao. The curacao seems more subdued in taste than in smell however. Mouthfeel is also a little light for my tastes. I realize that this is a light style but prefer the body of Allagash White or Mendocino White. Overall this is a pretty good beer.

Citrus, fruit juice, yeasty, coriander, esters of banana and pineapple, faint bitterness towards the end. Thick and crisp. There are plenty of weak wheat beers out there but this one makes you feel like you a drinking clouds of rich spices and juice. I'm on cloud 9 with this one.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Taste: light and refreshing taste of wheat, pear, bananas, orange and some apricot, some spices and sweetness too.  On a hot summer day, nothing beats this beer. It has a great appearance as well, with a nice yellow color and a white foam. Easy to drink, with nice smooth flavors. Cheap, too.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,Brianmerrilyn,3.65,"This is another beer and wit in paticular thatI've been consuming for years and one of the first after moving beyond the mass produced stuff. For one reason or another, I have not reviewed until today. Poured into pint glass at Tracks in Penn Station Manhattan whilst waiting for my LIRR train to celebrate my Mothers birthday. After taking out the lemon the barkeep placed on the pint. Partially hazy golden with a half finger head and decent lacing that faded to a half cap very quickly. Bottom half is almost clear. Nose is mild yeast and lemon and estery dash. Taste is moderate yeasty with lemon accents. Mouthfeel has spiced crispness at the start but weakens much to my chagrin.0r more succintly, it gets watery. Kinda chewy to start and carbonation remains with the legs. Unless my pallet has matured vastly or as many others have mentioned, th taste and body are not what I remember. Do recall reading they went back to old brewry and recipe but not sure. Not to say this is not a fine brew by any means and would recommend to all geeks and neophytes alike.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Obviously there's a flood of Belgian wits or styled wits out there. This is not the best, nor is it the worst. There are far batter American made variations (there are also far worse).

This is not as strong as some other witbiers that I've had and in my opinion is just slightly watery. Mouthfeel is solid with the spices lingering on the tongue.

Smells slightly citrusy from orange peal not hops with some spicyness coming through from the corriander.  The taste is spicy and dry. Some malty sweetness, but the wheat drys it out quickly. So ness with corriander in the finish.  Some what thick in the mouth. Some puckerage from the wheat dryness and the sour orange peal.  This is any easy drinker. Could be a session beer, but I'd only consider one in the mix of a session.  I liked this one a lot more when I didn't like beer. It realy blew me away my first time.

Smell is zesty wheat with a twist of orange and coriander with a peppery zip.  Rich wheat flavors, sweet and mellow, dry and toasty, greet the tastebuds, followed by a nice fruity orange note with a nutty, dry finish featuring just a kiss of earthy hops.

T: Opens with an overwhelmingly strong band-aid flavor, followed by a solid wheat foundation, and balancing notes of coriander and orange zest. Extremely dry with a slightly bitter finish. Pairs awfully well with mussels & pommes frites.  M: Light-bodied, crisp and refreshing. Well carbonated.  D: Good.  Note: A band-aid off-flavor is often indicative of infected yeast.

83,248,Getinthevan,4.42,"Like most wheat beers that followed afterwards, Hoegaarden is top notch stuff. The color off the bat is a strong, cloudy yellow which gives way to a great bubbly head. The beer alone is a pleasant view to look at as the bubble rise to the top along with the cloudiness.  The smell is very pleasant and possesses a strong aroma that almost acts like an air freshener, as the smell lingers in the air far after the beer's been consumed.  Taste is great, with a nice punch of bitterness right in the aftertaste. It goes down exceptionally smooth, and is very nice and filling as well. Definitely a ""go to"" beer any given time.  Mouthfeel feels well satisfied and the overall flavor is highly complex, mixed with orange and yeast flavors. Definitely worth savoring a few seconds before it travels down the gullet.  Drinkability is a must. Hoegaarden is a great beer to quench thirst with, but also a fun beer to drink at dinner and at live concerts.

Also a touch of citrus scent there.  Taste was a good example of why they call beer liquid bread. Very strong yeast notes, and then the citrus and spices hit you. Not an overly complex taste, but one I quite enjoyed.  Mouthfeel was ok, was a touch thin, the taste did not linger long. The carbonation made its presence known, but a bit on the light side.  I did find this one very drinkable. It's not a heavyweight beer, so easy to drink more than one at a sitting. I find it a good beer for just enjoying and not having to worry much about high alcohol content, or being so heavy it feels you up. This is the kind of beer you drink with friends just for fun, and want something better than a mass market brand.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

T - apricots, oranges, light hops, a touch of malts, breadiness, and a tangy aftertaste  M - light bodied, medium/heavy carbonation. Somewhat watery  D - very drinkable, a good session beer  Overall - a decent buy. This was on sale for 7.99/6 pack at Wegmans.

The aroma is a clean and strong lemon and nutmeg, really a bright and unique masterpiece for the nose. The flavor is wheat and light citrus, fairly aqueous and very drinkable, but it also has a great creamy quality, like milk. Very fine carbonation. This seemed so much better than the recent version I had from a bottle. That was OK but this was really a tastey treat to me, and I don't typically go for witbiers particularly.

It's like the Fifth Element girl when she absorbed the world's collective experience: WHAT just happened? Pepper, citrus, yeast, and clove--oh my! This is unfiltered heartiness, for sure.

The spice and orange are there, but not prominent. The overwhelming taste is that of pale wheat and sweet yeastiness that adds a mellow-banana flavor (similar to Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier, to me at least). The finish is dry, but barely so.

Two finger head that dies down to white cap with some decent lacing.  S - Some faint citrus notes, but overall I smell the coriander and wheat malt. Very inviting.  T - The coriander is immediately noticable, though it is quickly balanced by the somewhat sour wheat malt and citrus aspects. Finishes with grain that perfectly compliments the flavors.  M- Light bodied, and a little prickly. I could use a little less of the carbonation.  D - Not hard to put back quite a few of these (as I have done on occasion) but after the beer warms and after repeated bottles the grainy taste is more evident.

On the palate, things become quite a bit more zesty, as the spices truly are all over the place. Herbal menthol notes really dominate, followed by citrus, chamomile, and coriander.

Taste is light but flavorful with an orange-lemon citrus thing going on. Some clove and a light medicinal quality. A little bit of a fresh-cut flower aftertaste.

I understand to some people this is the Bud Light of Whitbiers but you like what you like.  It pours a very cloudy yellow with a frothy inch and a half pure white head that sits there unmoving waiting for the first sip. Minimal scattered lacing throughout the glass.

Lots of active carbonation - tons of tiny bubbles rapidly making their way to the surface. Color is hazy yellow - reminds me of lemonade. Although this is an unfiltered beer there are no large peices of yeast - but it has a haziness - likely due to very fine suspended yeast. This really looks like a refreshing beer.  Smell is very light and subtle. Smell of funky yeast, lemon zest, light malts.  Very refreshing. Tastes of light malt. Citrus, particularly lemon zest with a little hops bitterness in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is crisp and light. Carbonation is fine and champagne-like.

Bleach white head on a lemonade body, a very nice looking bier. Okay lacing, head didn't last as long as I would have liked, but optimal presentation upon pour.  S- Soapy, lemon zest, lightly hop-citric. There is a bit of pear in there, too.  T- The taste, like the last reviewer said, is slightly soapy, but like the way lemon soap smells, so it is rather pleasing. Very light, crisp, wheaty, no great hop trace. Very citrusy (lemon/small amount of orange, no grapefruit), so you don't need a lemon in this, please, please don't.  M- Thinner than I remember, or would like it to be. The pour is slightly deceiving, looking quite carbonated and acidic. Lightly acidic in the jowls, small tang on the tongue, rolls down the throat smoothly, almost making me feel thirstier.

83,248,ElGrecoVerde,4.04,"Appeared a cloudy and active light yellow. The bottle has a bulge at the top that reminds me of Placido Polanco's head.  Smells of spices and lemons. Spice aromas ranged from pepper to seasonings like rosemary.  The taste carried these flavors of the aromas well, adding some additional fruits to the party. All of the flavors are generally mild, but there's a lot of them to keep up with.  Mouthfeel started a bit pulpy, and finished somewhat dry. Some of the spice flavors stick around, but the aftertaste is surprisingly nice.  Solid all around beer. It's not too hard to find, and always enjoyable.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Aroma is bready, with slight spiciness and banana. Taste is yeasty with a slight banana twinge to it. Mouthfeel is fuller than expected with a dry finish to it. A very drinkable brew. Definitely wont be the last one I drink.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,KodyBrannon,4.05,"Poured this beer into a pint glass, It poured a golden yellow color with a white head that dicipated quickly, But had a good amount of carbonation. The smell of this beer is wheat,wheat,wheat and yeast. The taste is also very much wheat. But for a witbier, it is very clean and crisp, doesn't leave much of an aftertaste. The mouthfeel of the beer is very light and watery, but with a clean aftertaste. The drinkability of this beer is very drinkable. I could use this as a summer sessionable all summer long.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,Hatch,3.85,"12oz brown bottle with pry-off cap. Freshness date located on label.  Pours a cloudy, very pale yellow. Hazy from the unfiltered yeast. Forms a fluffy, off-white head, decent retention. Not much lace going on here, but it's appropriate.  Smells of light sweet spice, some sourness from the yeast, and sometimes you can pick up some hints of banana. Not very aromatic, but for what you can detect, it smells good.  Notes of sweet and sour in the taste. The sourness coming from the yeast, but it's not ""sour"" in terms you normally think. Taste of mild spiciness, some hints of lemon zest and banana. Light citrusy hop taste, with some faint bitterness coming through in the end.  This brew is mild and easy to drink, as are most witbiers. Mouthfeel isn't thin, as some people might suspect, but isn't thick; it falls somewhere in the middle, and is somewhat chewy. Good amount of carbonation; would call it crisp but not a sharp crisp.  Notes: A great witbier that's easy to drink, and pretty delicious if you enjoy the style. The only drawback is that it cost a little more than it should. I also hear that if you drink it in Belgium that it has more of a flavor kick that in does here. I guess it loses a little something on the plane ride over here. Nonetheless it's an enjoyable witbier.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,CortexBomb,3.53,"Hoegaarden pours out murky yellow, opaque, not a lot of head, but some. The smell is lightly wheaty with a skosh of banana, not a lot going on.  The taste is a simple, smooth yet enjoyable wheaty malted tone with hints of lemon and some spiciness. This is not aggressive by any stretch of the imagination, but it is a nice, pleasant Belgian white.  The mouthfeel on this, modestly good. Some fullness, some tingles, but not a lot. The drinkability is also a shade above average, a smooth beer, but a bit more expensive because it's imported.  The bottom line: I have Hoegaarden on occasion because bars which are slightly upscale tend to carry it. It's not one of my favourites in the style, and it won't shock you in any way, but it's a perfectly tasty, and serviceable example of its style. Just be sure that you get the lemon out of the beer ASAP if it's served that way.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

The appearance was a little cloudy but that taste ever so makes up for it.  Smell was very wheaty and when i first had one of these beers i knew i was going to enjoy it.  I prefer to have this beer on tap because it makes it that much better and drinkable but a case is also nice. A good price as well.

Compared to the on-tap that I had in Belgium, this is much more enjoyable, and less carbonated (which may be the hidden key, here since some on-tap places over-carbonate).

T: A refreshing combination of yeast and lemon, sporting a nice thickish mouthfeel. Taste is not particularly strong, carbonation is medium and bitterness low.

It had a nice crisp, refreshing taste. Leaves a pleasant aftertaste. It reminded of sponge cake for some reason. The beer itself didn't feel too heavy nor too light.

Large bubbly white head leaves some lacing. Aroma of spice (coriander) and lemon. Crisp grainy taste with citrus accents, packaged in a fairly light body with moderate carbonation. Refreshing, but far from spectacular.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Smell is of banana, some spices, maybe a bit of lemon. Nice but unremarkable.  Fairly mild flavor wise -- it has some Belgian funky yeastiness, followed up by tart fruit and a tiny bit of hops. Alcohol is nearly completely hidden.  Mouthfeel is light, perhaps a tad too light. Has a spritzer-like quality to it. The lightness, and the mild flavors, make this highly drinkable.  All in all, a solid wit.

I won't buy it again, because I don't really like this style (I have discovered), but I appreciate that it had flavor and did well what it was trying to do.  M: Crisp and clean. Good carbonation.

For the review I even did the little twirl at the end of the pour (like it instructs on the label) and actually had a octagonal pint glass. This left a two finger head and a very clody yellow/white body, but the head desisted quickly. The smell is one of cirtus fruits, most notable an orange (note: I do NOT and will NOT have an orange w/ my wit beer). The taste is citrusy w/ hints orange and peach, and the wheat sediments make it very smooth, although it is not a complex flavor at all and the spices, which overpower the wheat, are still barely noticable. Because of this you can just sit back and keep pouring it down your gullet.

Head retention was light with trim around the glass, updated regularly by large carbonation bubbles. Yeasty and floral aroma, can't smell the citrus very much. Spices are supported by the carbonation and overpower the wheat. The carbonation fades, and the flavor left behind in your mouth is the citrus and banana.

Let's see what this smells like...ok, not nearly as bad as the appearance. Some orange, maybe a bit of banana. That's about it, and even those scents were not very prominent. Not a strong smelling beer.  Taste was slightly better. Again it was a very mild banana and orange flavor and that's all I could pick up. Bordered on watery.  Mouthfeel was acceptable. Not as thin as it appeared, and slightly more carbonation than appearances led me to believe.  Overall I wavered between a 2.5 and a 3 on drinkablity and I gave it the 3.

The glass was filled with a very pale, hazy yellow and capped off with a foamy white head. The head could have stuck around longer for a wheat, but still nice, and left a ring and and small patches along the side. The aroma is citrusy, like lemongrass, and spicy/ bready. The taste follows similarly. Light, citrus sweetness hits the tongue first, followed by a very balanced and mild bitter bite. The finish is somewhat refreshing and the aftertaste is again a sweet, malty lemon flavor. The mouthfeel is light, but not watery and the carbonation is very fitting, not very heavy. Hoegaarden is very nicely balanced, light and refreshing enough to be easily drinkable. It's a good representation of the citrusy, wheaty characteristics of the Witbier style.

A subtle malty sweetness is present amongst stronger flavors of orange peel and coriander. The spices give some character to what would otherwise be a rather ordinary and bland beer.

Also a lot more sweeter i think than when poured from the bottle  T: Tart with the citrus but also a delicate sweetness, i found it hard to distinguish what the sweetness was in the smell but in the taste i feel its very much spice, well balanced which makes it light and refreshing  M: Light and spritzy on the tongue, fluffy almost!

S: Exciting aromas of citrus maybe orange or lemon and hops. I have not smelled a beer like it yet. T: Just like it smelled, there was an orange taste but complimented with a black pepper/clove type of taste that I presume is the corriander that was dexcribed on the bottle. I have never had corriander so I ma unsure iof this taste but do plan on going out and buying some after this beer. M: The carbonation felt like what you would find drinking a carbonated water.

Cloudy pale starw colored beer raises a nice crisp foamy white head which recedes to a ring. Very nice look, perfect witbier appearance.  The aroma is very nice, lemon-orange with a hint of coriander, very fresh. On the palate the active fine bubbles convey the crisp, refreshing, clean wit taste well. There is a good balance of orangey and spicy notes, a clove-y tingle lingers in the finish. Very clean and refreashing, flavors could be a little less restrained...I got a little bored.

Great blend of orange and coriander make this one of the most drinkable and enjoyable beers. I enjoy it with an orange peel, which helps bring out and accentuate the citrus-like taste, although drinking it alone really helps you appreciate the exceptional taste. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is a fan of white beers. From what I've heard - and not like this makes much of a difference - it has won the beer cup in its category many times - a consistent winner.

I would consider it more translucent that cloudy, being that i didn't see differences in the opacity of the beer while drinking. The head stared out as soapsuds and dissipated quickly but only to a ring around the collar that fell with the drink. Was supprised at the mildness, expecting a more robust and forceful taste, but was not under whelmed. The orange tone comes threw very well and mixes well with the taste of other botanicals. Smell was a bit lacking to me, though present.

I think a beer should taste naturally without the help of a piece of fruit. Just my opinion though.  T: Milder than some, but a full bodied wheat beer. I really like its balance.  M: Slightly acidic, but gentle.  D: Very smooth, yet nicely carbonated.  It has good balance. Smooth wheat and carbonated, but not over done on either end.

Aroma: Defining characteristic of this and other Belgians is that distinctive yeast character (sour? vanilla?). Orange is very evident along w/subtle coriander. Reminiscent of potpourri while the head lasts, malt and citrus linger in the glass after the beer is finished. Taste: Bright, citrusy and spicy but dominated by the tart yeast character. Highly carbonated and refreshing. Mouthfeel is very light, spritzy and becomes almost watery as the beer warms. Dry in the middle, lingering tart citrus and spice in the aftertaste.  This is a great summer beer but is so drinkable, complex, and versatile I'll be drinking this year round.

S: A deep and strong yeast and sour grainy smell that stays with the nose.  T: Smooth, light taste of grain that is constant from the first sip until the last without complexity. A refreshing and light taste.  M: Light carbonation makes this smooth and simple to the palate and is consistent with a dry aftertaste.

Smell is not overwhelming, but is like one would expect from a witbier - coriander and cloves with a hint of citrus. Somewhat weizen like. The taste is much the same as the smell -sweet with spices and citrus, but not as enjoyable as some others of the style. Mouthfeel is pretty light in body with minimal carbonation.

That sour mustiness of good wheat beers is also in the nose.  Taste is lighter than the smell would lead you to believe, but the flavors are sublime with nothing overpowering the other. Citrus and spices with a very nice peppery bite. That yeasty sourness is prominent also. A great balance of flavors!  Mouthfeel is good... chewy with about a perfect level of carbonation.

Strange also, its one of my favorite styles.  Pours a very pale yellow color with a slight haze. A nice fluffy white head was created through a vigorous pour. Decent lacings left behind.  The aroma is simple. A little citrus fruits, a little of that wheat ale smell. The taste is also remarkably simple. A few hints of lemon and on the yeasty side, theres really not any large standout flavors in this one. There may be a few remnant flavors of some spices floating around in it, but nothing noteworthy.  Mouthfeel is crisp, dry, and refreshing. A light bodied beer, but I'm impressed with the refreshing mouthfeel and adequate carbonation.

T- The basic wheat taste isn't too strong in this one with bananas strong in the opening. The lemon flavors work their way up and take over in the finish. Very little spiciness in here, it's sweet and a bit watery.  M- I like my witbeers a bit heavier than this. It's a little bit watery and a little bit chalky. Not terrible, but not great.  D- This is a nice and drinkable beer that I think few would find offensive or difficult.

The end. ...well, not so fast.  A: Cloudy, yellow, small particulate, looks like pineapple juice. Little head but nice lace.  S: Subdued Jucy Fruit, not as fake, but there was an industrial hint to it, which detracted slightly.  M: Chewy, foamy, mouth left you wanting another sip, overall like you've just chewed the gum.  T: Light, banana clove taste, not very overpowering, orange hints, but the star is the thick wheat overtones that makes this beer. Serve it with a slice of orange! Come on! Serve it! When you've graduated from the Trix cerial flavor of Blue Moon, come have a real example of the style. Not the best, but damn good.  D: Yep.

The smell is of wheat, banana, and clove.  The taste is some nice wheat flavour, very light clove, and even lighter banana. Very lightly flavoured over all but what is there is good. Just needs to be a bit more assertive. The mouthfeel is light, the carbo is light, and it finishes on the watery side.

On this tasting, the pour was into a low Hoegaarden glass and the cloudy musty look of the beer was very attractive. Generous head to the beer. The smell of citrus/coriander was intense and lasted throughout the drink. However, I dont think the taste held up quite as much as there was a bit of a soapy aftertaste that followed each sip, especially toward the end.  On this time that I actually looked to drink in order to review it, I was more apt to notice that I really didnt enjoy it nearly as much as I first thought.

Orange peel galore, subtle hints of lemon up front segueing into a nice peppery, spicy uber-Belgian finish.  The mouthfeel was very crisp with a lot of carbonation.

Whereas the first batch (I presume brewed at an earlier date in time) had delicious citrus hints, comparable to Blue Moon, probably better, this batch (a fresher batch) lacks a lot. The citrus hints are almost completely gone. All that is left is a dull banana taste and rather offensive spices. I might be grading a bit harsher than I normally would, but I am aware of what this beer COULD be, so I am disappointed.

This is in fact the beer that led me into the world of craft beers but I am posting a very late review on this one. The Hoegaarden pours out murky golden with a generous head retaining pretty well. Good carbonation's also visible through the walls of the hexagonal glass. The smell is wheaty, citrusy and spicey (coriander). The taste was a nifty blend of the citrus and spices with a firm wheat backing; some orange and banana on the nose. A very smooth entry for the taste with a nice refreshing finish constantly with a good and strong wheat backing and aromatic spices on the nose. The mouthfeel was about medium bodied and carbonation was tuned aptly to create a very slick mouthfeel; very smooth and ever so refreshing to drink. Thirst quenching is going to be quite an understatement for this Witbier. The after taste starts of spicey and the wheat quickly kicks in with subtle banana aromas on the nose. The after tastes finishes off orange and citrusy and lingers for a while before slowling fading off. A great yet simple beer that I could really enjoy and the great thing is, this one's as easy to get as the Heineken and Tiger (popular local macros). It is no wonder the Witbier is literally the beer I drink the most often but would not get sick of it.

Mouthfeel: Crisp and Dry.  Drinkability: While I vowed I wouldn't drink another wit beer I got stuck with this during a pairing event. After having tasted a couple of American versions, this was definitely an improvement and from what I can tell, a good example of this beer style. Flavors were better balanced. The coriander (celery flavor) didn't dominate like the American version I've tasted, but still not my cup of tea though.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,micahgoldfus,4,"Served to me with a light rim of head that did not go anywhere for a long time. Color was a thick, deep, cloudy yellow. Smell was great: bananas, citrus, and yeast. Taste did not dissapoint: pale malts, very little hop presence, and sweet flavors of orange, spice, and maybe even some banana. A delicious, refreshing witbier. Served to me quite cold, which was refreshing, but the flavors really came out when it warmed up a bit. Little carbonation and a medium body. Quite drinkable. A full beer that is not filling.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

S: A perfume like mix of Belgian spices, soft citrus like orange and lemon, with a hint of lime.  T: Smooth citrus flavor, with some slight bitterness from the hops and coriander. A bit of wheat malt comes through, with a pasta-like consistency. A light, refreshing beer that is tasty and easy to drink, oustanding.  M: Smooth, spritzy, slightly acidic, just what you want from a witbier.

Very light, but at times overly sweet, which impairs to some extent the drinkability on this otherwise easy-going 4.9 ABV brew. Sweetish, bready, hints of clove and lemon close the package, but all too mild/light.

When I ran into it at the a national grocery store I was very glad to see that a relatively quality import (and the original witbier) was enjoying mass market appeal. I have found that sense Hoegaarden's growth into a national grocery staple the beer has changed. The last several six packs I have bought were not completely cloudy as they should and clam to be and the taste seemed to be watered down.

Smells of banana, orange peel and lemony yeast. Very refreshing scent. The taste doesn't match the complexity of the nose, but hints at lemon and banana. Very light, refreshing, and drinkable.

Spices fade away gracefully and cleanly. Dry, clean, and refreshing.  Light, tingly mouthfeel. Extremely drinkable.

Lively carbonation was observed at the base of the of the glass well below the layer of density which obscures any visible carbonation in the bowl of the glass. A gen-u-ine nose of bannana and clove assend from the glass along with some minor notes of lemon and young yeast. On the tongue, wonderful flavors of creamy banana laden key lime pie, smooth, rich and way rewarding; all this from a light colored blonde brew! Quality ingredients and careful production scream from this very well balanced and delicious beer. This beer has all the characteristics that many producers try to emulate while attempting to duplicate this style, and unfortunately often failing miserably.

83,248,muddyriverduck,3,"I puchased this brew as a last resort at a new ""beverage"" center owned by a guy who had a camel double-parked out front. I say last resort because it was the best offering at this locale and I've always been suspect of beers that Bud Light drinkers consider ""good"". When Bud Light drinkers here in Toledo talk about getting a good beer, they almost always seem to be talking about Hoegaarden or Blue Moon.  First off, there is very little I can can say that hasn't already been said in the 717 previous reviews. Being a big Belgian fan, I didn't find this beer all that complex. In fact, at this moment I would liken it to a Budweiser with a twist of lemon and some orange flavoring added. This view may be skewed at this moment because I just finished a plate of Bangkok Spicy and a bowl of Thai soup, but nevertheless, not impressed or ""wowed"".  Do I find Hoegaarden objectionable? No. Would I buy it again? No. I paid $7.49 and I'd much rather spend that much on a 4-pack of Duvel or a couple bombers of Ommegang.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

83,248,LittleCreature,3.87,"Appearance - 3.5 Although the colour is like dirty dishwater, this is actually not a bad looking beer. The head poured a rather dense three fingers, which then steadily reduced to one where it settled. Colour is above mentioned, murky and pale.  Smell - 4.0 VERY interesting. A perculiar mix of malty sweetness and a cinnamon like spiciness. Not lacking in strength either.  Taste - 4.0 Definitely perculiar if you have not tried a witbier before. However, the taste has definitely grown on me the more I have drank it. The taste is actually more sour than bitter, but certainly not in a bad way, there is something lemony about it. I can also taste apples and white bread among other things I cannot put a name to. Perculiar to say the least.  Mouthfeel - 4.0 Possibly the strongest aspect of this beer. It has a lot of body for a beer of moderate alcohol volume, carbonation is moderate and it feels relatively dense in the mouth, although never syruppy.  Drinkability - 3.5 While this beer goes down rather easily once you get used to it, I would never want to have more than one. Perhaps it has a little too much character?  OVERALL - 3.85 This is a really refreshing beer, and it goes down in a way somewhat similar to lemon squash and certain scrumpy ciders. The acetic bite is far more noticeable than any alcohol taste. It is an interesting beer, and I will continue to try it on occassion, despite the relatively high price.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Thought a wit would be a nice one on a hot day. Pale, cloudy yellow with no lacing or retention to speak of. Faint wheat and citrus aromas. This beer is limp and watery.

The appearance is the cloudy fizz that is associated with a witbier, and the smell--its best attribute in my opinion--is citrusy and bright. But the taste to me was sour & harsh--just not enjoyable. You can taste the citrus and wheat, but the overwhelming sourness just made it totally unenjoyable.  Not a fan.  ***Edited 9/14/07*** Still had one of these in my fridge and was nearly contemplating tossing it, but decided to give it another try. I was pleasantly surprised to find it wasn't as bad as I remembered. Still has an overall ""sourness"" to it that would really not make me desire having more than one, but its crispness *was* refreshing. Smell is still its best quality, imo.

The beer poured a cloudy pale yellow, with an enormous head, I am beggining to think this is normal from light Belgium beers.  The nose was dominated by bitter hops and wheat. Quite a sharp and unpleasant bitterness, possibly with a slight hint of lime/lemon to add to this bitterness but it was not at all pleasant.  However once I tasted this, the beer won me over instantly. A pleasant, refreshing hoppy taste with a slight hint of citrus in the aftertaste and a good ammount of wheat throughout. This felt like a beer on the mouth, nice and full with low carbonation, nice to taste a light beer that is not ruined by bubbles.  I thoroughly enjoyed the bottle and would definately drink it again.

T: salty-sweet flavour of yeastiness, a sharp citric, almost woody, edge, and a tinge of dryish-sweet hoppyness surround the mildly sweet bready and wheat-ish taste of malts; at the back of the palate a dryish spiciness as well as a sourness of wheats and yeastiness lingers.

83,248,Jcdolan,3.68,"Purchased a bottle with a ""create your own six pack"" deal. Sometimes deals like this just mean the store is trying to get rid of old beer that might not be good anymore. Seemed to be alright however.  Appearance was a cloudy yellow with a build up of yeast on the bottom of the bottle that was swirled and poured into the rest of the glass. The yeast at the the bottom didn't seem to dissolve fully into the last 2/3 of the beer and I received a few noticable lumps or small chunks in my glass. Could this indicate that the beer was indeed old?  Smell was very intersting. Sents of delicious spice and orange citrus can be detected. Reminded me and got me in the mood for some fall pumpkin brews.  Taste was very unique and unlike anything I have ever come across. Citrus and sweet with a perfect undertone of spice sweeping across the tounge.  This beer has taken me off guard and I am very pleased with my purchase. The taste is natural and mild when compared to a Blue Moon and I would recommend this over a Blue Moon any time.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,kajerm,3.6,"Bottle at the Mundelein beer tasting-- I really can't believe I've gone this long without reviewing Hoegaarden.  Pours cloudy pale yellow with a big white head. The smell is yeasty bananas and malted wheat, with citrus and coriander; maybe some light malts.  Tastes exactly like it smells. The bitter orange, combined with the other characteristics of the beer makes it refreshing as hell.  The mouthfeel is light with brisk carbonation. This is a classic style example-- and a good beer.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Pours a hazy gold/yellow with a ton of white head that thinned out to a light coat.  Smell is yeast and lemon juice, not real good smelling, but not bad either.  Taste is sort of sweet and lemony, it's a refreshing taste.  Light, crisp, refreshing beer, good mouthfeel, pleasant after taste.  Overall this was a fine example of the style and I think I will be drinking much more of this beer during the summer months.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,BretSikkink,3.85,"Ultra pale, hazy appearance, though no nearly as cloudy as with a good yeast sediment swirl out of the bottle. Lots of head bursts from the tap, threatens to overwhelm the Hoegaarden glass which is barely able to reign it in.  Yeast is all over the nose; phenolic peppers and a little springy citric flavor.  This beer tends towards the earthy side focusing on wheat, touches on cloyingly sweet, heavy carbonation leads it into a creamy mouthfeel. The yeast is just peppery enough to be interesting, more citric hop from the nose. Not quite bready, there's a peculiar dryness and a little tart punch at the end.  This is the benchmark summer beer, a perfect six pack companion for dog days. I would love to have tried Pierre Celis' original recipe, I can guarantee that it was not half as watery as this brew.  Particular to having this on draft: I think it loses some of its characteristic flavors when served from a keg, this has a tendency to strip bottle conditioned wheat beers of taste as it is essentially decanting the yeast sediment without allowing it to really get at the beer. I think of Hoegaarden, other wit/wheat beers as being ""filtered"" when on tap.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

The beer itself is murky when poured with a finishing swirl and light straw color.  Smell: The scent is a little muted but it's crisp. There are mellow tones of banana, orange zest, and a little detergent like funk. I would say the scent is pretty spot on with style but not really hitting the ball out of the park in terms of strength.  Taste and Mouthfeel: The beer drinks a little thin albeit crisp and refreshing. There's notes of unripened banana and a little bit of bitter orange zest but the beer drinks like a fine fizzy wash of flavor, not much rich and sustained flavor to speak of. With that said, the finish is obviously clean and the aftertaste as well.  Drinkability: For a wit I feel as if this beer has traded off flavor for drinkability. It goes down really easy and I have been known to get right sideways on this beer at a bar.  Bottom Line: One of the more accessible craft beers in America these days and it's pretty good given that fact.

The 12 oz brown bottle poured into my pint glas to form a nice frothy 1"" head. The head settled to a thin cap leaving pronounced lacing down the glass. The appearance was a cloudy pale yellow-orange.  The scent was typical of a wheat beer with hints of banana fruitiness and slight spice.  The taste brought out the spicyness right away.... more than most wheat beers. The second thing I noticed was a subdued fruit taste.... not so much of bananas but maybe some apple.

On the palate, it's just as spicy as you'd expect from the aroma mixed with sweet wheat flavor and again, a bit of citrus behind the coriander with a very slight hop flavor on the finish. The mouthfeel is actually somewhat thin, which is uncharacteristic of how filling it is. Altogether, it's a drinkable brew, though spiciness is what I look for in my whiskies rather than my beers, but it is oddly filling, not unlike a good stout.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Citrus and corrianders grain flavors with a little spiceness and enough tartness to keep the mouthfeel exciting.  Lightly in body and highly carbonated, a little fizzy on the palate.  Hoegaarden simply is what it is: a architype for the witbier style. Its not designed to wow the taste buds, but the flavors are far from offensive.

Poured a hazy yellow into a tulip. Swirlled around the last bit in the bottle to top of. Small nice head goes down rather quickly, but a little swirlling brings it right back up. Nice smells. Bready and just a touch of citrus. Don't really pick up a spice profile. The citrus and spice are very subdued in the taste as well, which is an inoffensive bready/ wheat goodness. Neither sweet nor bitter.  Great mouthfeel. Medium carbonation makes this one very easy to quaff. The low alcohol percentage doesn't hurt either. Great session beer. This beer is an absolute staple.

But this review isn't about ""around the house"", it's about how wonderful Hoegaarden is on-tap. Served in it's hexagonal pint glass, it's a fantastic looking beer.

Spices, I'm imagining coriander, come through as well. When it hits the tongue, lots of citrus presence with no sour qualities. Wheat presence is huge, obviously, but helps it go down oh-so-smoothly. Hints of coriander also prevelant. Slightly creamy, and finishes with no bitter qualities. Carbonation is medium, not overwhelming by any means.

Head retention was excellent; the bubbles were slow to fall to thin, soapy cap. The subsequent lacing was spotty but prevalent enough to take note. This beer is lovely to look at.  The nose offers a wheaty-yeasty slurry with minimal spiciness. I detect faint traces of lemon and orange peel with sensible kisses of cloves and coriander. Moderate potency fairly chatty; the nose is quite nice. I had my first couple Hoegaardens last night and I wasnt too impressed but as I sit down to review this and really deconstruct it I have to say I am enjoying it much more. Classic nose. Inviting.  The palate is a tad restrained, IMO. I like the wheaty-yeasty flavors; delicate spiciness, lemon zest, orange peels, coriander, cloves, with a hint of ginger. Sweet in the middle, kind of flabby; Id like to see a tad more hops to balance the sweetness. Wheaty-spicy finish, which dries out the aftertaste I am thankful the sweetness is broken as I dont think I could handle it from middle through aftertaste. Solid palate overall.  Almost medium in body, the carbonation is moderate and fitting for the flavor profile. The mouthfeel is nothing special but it plays the part well enough.  I think a part of me expected a better beer and a part of me wanted to hate this beer and a part of me got the exact beer I was expecting. I am happy this beer is good.

The head when poured was 2 fingers of white creamy chunkiness. The head stays put for awhile. Looks like a white should.  A solid dose of coriander and clove come through first and mingles with the spiciness of the yeast. There is a sprinkling of bitter orange peel in the background. A wheat twang is the base for everything else.  The coriander, clove, and spicy yeast mix together nicely without one overtaking the others. Twangy wheat cools things at mid-palate and there is a mild white pepper spice on the finish. the coriander makes another small appearence on the swallow.  This beer has a nice light body without being watery. It's smooth going down and the carbonation awakens the taste buds with the tingle making it an enjoyable brew.  Drinkability is good. I'm drinking this the wrong time of year. It's cold right now but in the summer Hoegaarden is hard to beat when it's nice and cold.  Hoegaarden, in my opinion, is the base for many white ales.

83,248,BBM,3.55,"The beer pours a very pale yellow, almost white, and cloudy. There is a nice bubbly white head on top. Smell is of sweet fruits (bananas) and a hint of spices.  The taste is almost like the smell, but seems more muted. Banana and spices, a bit of hops. It's not an overwhelming flavor, nor very interesting. Not offensive by any means.

Light and nice without being pointless. No unpleasant overtones of alcohol, not too fizzy. The yeasty taste really is this beer's forte.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

I just love suds!  Mmm smells of oranges and just a little bit of hops and is that lemon along with something spicy probably the coriander. Nice smell I wonder if they sell a perfume like this for my wife?  The taste is good but I was hoping for something that grabbed me and smacked me about like only an orange peel could. However everything here is mild mannered orange, lemon, and coriander with an undertone of hops. I also noticed the standard bread taste you would expect in a wheat beer with a hint of cloves.  Mouthfeel is creamy and just a bit sticky with nice carbonation.  This beer is very drinkable it was so mild my wife even liked it. I was hoping for a little more kick in the taste buds.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Nice color, very pale golden, good head. Tastes of banana, citrus, and pear. It seems near the end of the glass I noticed a more spicy flavor. Coriander was more prominent than other beers. Also, compared to Blue Moon, the mouthfeel seemed more full, more substance. Overall it was a nice, light, satisfying beer. If you like Blue Moon, definitely try this one out.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

This is a very tasty beer. Spice and lemon are most evident. Minimal hop bitterness. It is both sweet and sour like lemonade. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with mild carbonation. Very drinkable and refreshing. I tried this in November but I bet it goes down even easier in the summer. Overall, a very enjoyable beer that can be a nice change of pace.

Head is much bigger, creamy, with good retention, and lacing which lines the glass. Highly aromatic (as in the bottle) with citrus, coriander and clove. On palate sweet and sour, with clove and banana on finish: perhaps more intensity of flavour than in the bottle. The lovely sweet-sour finish is lasting. Carbonation is more balanced on tap, creating a pleasant mouthfeel. Few beers could be called more refreshing. Superbly drinkable (particularly now that the weather is getting warmer in Australia).

I have had many a bottle or draught one, before I joined this site, but haven't reviewed them.  Poured a pale yellow with a full white head.  Aroma of nothing at first, but as the beer warmed up, citrus, mostly grapefruit smells came through.  The taste was slightly sour and grapefruit from the start, with other citrus flavours joining in as the beer warmed and the head reduced in size.  A summers day drink, not for winter nights.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

I can smell the lemon right away, with a little of the hops too.  The taste is rather interesting. I can pick out the malts and the lemon. Fairly sweet but not overpowering. The hops aren't so bitter but I can taste it.  The mouthfeel is a little strange. It feels gritty for some reason. It reminds me of malts and grain. The carbonation is rather light.  This is a very tasty beer that I highly recommend. However, I won't be drinking a whole bunch of it in large quantities.

83,248,micro108,4.21,"Hoegaarden (pronounced whogarden) is one of the worlds best examples of a Belgian wit, or white, style. It is a light, crisp beer containing barley and wheat, and spiced with coriander and curacao orange peel. It is produced by Brouwerij van Hoegaarden in Hoegaarden, Belgium, for InBev. The brewery includes oats in the beer, which along with secondary fermentation in the bottle, results in a thick, white creamy head. The yeast causes some slight cloudiness, but does not take away from the flavor. It is an excellent summer beer.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Refreshing yeast taste with a pineapple aftertaste.  Mouthfeel- This brew is a smooth silky drink. With every sip you take you keep wanting more of it. This cold brew and a hot summer day is a great mix.  Drink- Easy to drink. One of the first beers that opened my eyes to the real world of beers.

Pours a beautiful yellow into my standard pint glass. Cloudy, but not completely opaque. Nice white head that slowly dissipates into a ring around the liquid, leaving sticky lacing.   S - Banana, lemon, somewhat spicy, definately fruity. A hint of clove, I think. Lots of different scents.   T - Beautiful. Everything I smelled, and more. Banana, a bit of lemon, even come pepper. No trace of alcohol flavour.   M - Again, excellent. Just enough carbonation to make it interesting, but not over-carbonated. Right on the border between thin and heavy.   D - One of the smoothest beers I've had. This is at least my tenth bottle of Hoegaarden, but I never reviewed it until now.

Smells of citrus and spices, again true to it's style.  A wonderful taste to behold. Semi-sweet and chewy. Pepper flavors and nice hop create harmony on your taste buds. A real twist to this one is a slightly sour pucker you get which is odd. A dry finish and it stays hoppy throughout the whole brew.  Honest to goodness one of my favorites.

This was only my second witbier (first being Blue Moon, which I enjoyed) but I thought this made Blue Moon almost look foolish. The taste is very enjoyable with a citrusy fruity wheat flavor. The mouthfell was light to light/medium. I really don't think I can give this beer justice with my words, but needless to say I hope to have it again very soon.

The taste is enjoyable, consisting of some sweet malt, a citrusy hop flavour, and some wheaty sourness. There is also an overall spiceyness which complements the individual characteristics. Hoegaarden is exceptional in its mouthfeel as far as im concerned. This beer is crisp and highly refreshing and has a light/medium body. I also think drinkability is high, especially in hot weather. This was the first wit i ever had many years back, and even though i've had a few which surpass it, i'll always hold this as a benchmark for the style.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Definitely a fruit-flavored wheat. Very ""wet"" compared to some other witbiers (Victory Whirlwind, Middle Ages Swallow Wit, e.g.).  Slightly fizzy feel on the way down.

This one is very zesty and zingy. I taste herbs, lemon rind, dry yeast, green grass, and hay. Extremely refreshing and awakening!

A treat for the nose.  Taste: You can taste what you smell, but with definite smokey finish.  Mouthfeel: The finish can throw you off, but once you get into the beer, you start to drink it down smooth. Good level of carbonation.  Final Statement: This beer is refreshing if you want it to be.

Very little smell, some sweets and err... banana. The taste was well balanced, fresh sourness combined with a light sweet yeasty flavor.

Second, if I could take an IV of Hoegaarden Wit directly to my brain, preferably in the back so I can snake it up my shirt, I would die a happy death.  A- Light yellow cloudiness, expectant of the style. Hard to get a single finger head out of the bottle to a glass, but existant corbonation makes up for the lack of head staying power.  S- Smells of corriander and light orange, maybe even lemon.  T- clean start with a crisp wheat taste. goats don't get this close to wheat. The corriander is hard to identify, but a citrus taste at the end of a sip in apparent. Fairly lightly hopped, but still balanced taste. This ain't no yellow fizzy macro brew!  M- Mouth feel starts with a crispy carbonation. Clean  D- I could personally put away one of those 5 liter party kegs (Fassdosen, Partydosen) if I knew where to find one.

83,248,doppelmeup,4.3,"Had this right after having a Blanche de Chambly, and was able to compare the two beers.  This beer had a creamier head and very nice appearance. Pale, lemony yellow, cloudy, nice fluffy head.  Stronger aromas of orange, coriander and yeast.  Flavor also had more hints of orange and coriander. Very light and thirst quenching.  An excellent beer. I think that I like the Blanche de Chambly just a little more, but this was a worth opponent and I would certainly dirnk more of these. Extremely drinkable brew and hightly recommended.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,demcorhip,4.27,"Appearance Cloudy, wheat straw coloured beer with a decent white head which disspated into nice lacings. The beer was poured as per bottle instructions, pouring half into the glass then swirling to mix in the yeast sediment.  Aroma Lemongrass accentuated with brett tanginess on top of wheaty bready aromas with just a hint of wheat nuttiness.  Taste The bready and nutty wheat flavour came through and was overlayed with a hint of clove, citrus and brett tang.  Mouthfeel Nice light tangy beer. Good balance between wheat flavours, citrus from the orange peal and coriander, and the hint of hops. The carbonation was a nice compliment to the mild zestiness of the beer.  Drinkability This is a very drinkable and refreshing brew. Perfect for a hot summer's evening when wants to quench their thirst, cool down, and have an interesting brew. Ill drink it again sometime for sure.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,BeerSox,3.95,"12oz. bottle, silver label. Bubble taper in neck.  Pours as a cloudy yellow gold color with lots of rising carbonation. Thick foamy head as an off-white color. Plentiful lacing from good head retention.  Lots of fruity aromas consistent with yeast. Hints of banana, peach, and other sweet fruits are available.  Strong fruit flavors with small hop definition, slightly sour with very clean finish. More sweet notes are available with the aromas.  Light-medium bodied with high carbonation. Sourness lends a little bite. The finish is a little dry.  Definitely a nicer beer. Goes down smooth, finishes clean.

83,248,Lancer211,4.17,"Poured from a bottle into a weizen glass. (Yeah, yeah, I know, it's not a hefe)  A - Unfiltered, cloudy pale orange-ish gold. White, foamy, very fine carbonation, excellent head formed almost immediately, initially about one finger, settled in a few minutes to about a 1/8th in head that persisted throughout the life of the beer. Somewhat decent lacing.  S - Not overly strong, yeasty and cirus zesty.  T - Sweet, moderate yeasty flavor with a backhand of citrus zest... the citrus flavor is sweet like an orange but also more bitter like lemon. Wheaty, peppery with hints of other spices as well.  M - Smooth finish, tasty aftertaste.  D - Not a light or simple beer by any means but quite drinkable, excellently thirst quenching.  Overall a delicious brew.

Fizzy carbonation accentuated the white fluffy head. Lacing was sticky. Smell was citrus, lemon zest, a bit grainy, Belgian yeast and a light spiciness. Taste was a tartness up front, citrusy lemon, sugar and Belgian yeast in the middle with spicy corriander and mild hopping in the finish. Cliche though it may be, crisp and refreshing. This is surely one of the finest examples of the style out there. You have to try this one.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,maven2k,4.52,"I'm very new at this but I feel that I am finally developing my taste and this site is a great help. I tried this beer at the Winking Lizard in Canton, Ohio because it was the beer of the month and you get to keep the huge glass (can always use more glassware). The beer came with a really nice white frothy head and the liquid was a nice cloudy yellowish gold. The head stuck around for quite a while and the lacing really sticks to the sides of the glass. The first mouthfull is really interesting, it hits you with a fresh zesty, citrus hit and goes down really smooth. I hope I am describing this right but my friend and I both thought that the after-taste was very much like clove. I really enjoyed this beer and it went well with the popcorn and loaded nachos ( I know, not the most sophisticated accompaniment), and it really hit the spot on a hot humid day. I would definately order this again.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

83,248,headlessparrot,3.9,"Here it is, the original wit, a beer that any self-respecting beer advocate should long already be familiar with. Though it's flavour profile has gone downhill a bit recently, it's still a great brew and will most likely forever be the marker of the style for witbiers.  Hoegaarden pours from a non-standard bottle (with a bulbous neck that allegedly increases flavour) into the hexagonal Hoegaarden glass (a miniaturized version of the hilariously oversized Hoegaarden pint glass) an unusual colour that is perhaps best described as half-macro lager/half lemonade, though quite cloudy. It's topped by two fingers of head that recedes fairly quickly, but maintains about a half-finger for most (if not all of) the drink. Considerable lacing fills out the appearance, making this an unconventionally attractive beer.  Smell is what we've come to expect from witbiers, very zesty and spicy. Some unmalted wheat makes its presence known, faint banana notes. The nose is dominated, however, by coriander and curaco orange peel, with a touch of other citrus fruits (lemon? tangerine?). Very pleasing.  My brother, a bit of a beer nerd (though he lacks the real vocabulary) describes the taste as ""hot dog water"" - he means this, of course, in a good way; as confusing as it may sound, I can also see where he's coming from with that description. Taste is largely unmalted wheat, perhaps a touch of indistinct hops. Fairly peppery, but the coriander shines through most of all, augmented by orange peels. Surprisingly creamy, it finishes crisp and a tad dry, with a touch of fruit and wheat aftertaste that's quite pleasing.  Mouthfeel is also good. Carbonation is fairly lively, though not obtrusive, and it's a very natural sort of carbonation. Body is creamy, fairly light but not watery, making this a pleasure to drink. Drinkability is also fairly high, though in practice I've noticed that more than two or three in a sitting make me feel somewhat ill. I'll also deduct points for the absurd high price of this beer; Unibroue's Blanche De Chambly is fairly comparable and about a dollar cheaper per six-pack, so I'd hesitate before selecting one of the other.  Ultimately, though, what can you really say about Hoegaarden? Downhill or not, it's still the original, and it's still a very tasty, very delicious brew, and an excellent accessible introduction into a world of beer that most haven't evne begun to explore.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Coriander like spice comes to the fore after a minute of nostril stretching!! Nice smooth spicyness..i know that seems like a contradiction but its what I get, yeasty, apricots, some hints of papaya..and a nice mellow bitterness at the end.

83,248,ColoradoBobs,4.25,"On tap at the Falling Rock Tap House in Denver, CO, on my 30th Wedding Anniversary.  I LOVE cloudy beers, and this one was very cloudy, light yellow, under a small, tight white head that lasted very well. (BTW, they now how to pour a beer at Falling Rock!!).  Smell is orange, clove, slight maltiness, citrus hops, slight apple fruitiness. Crisp and nice.  Taste is clove, orange, coriander, wheat-malt: WOWOWOWOWOW! Dry peppery finish. I mean WOWOWOWOW!  Mouthfeel was surprisingly full from the soft carbonation.  Very, very drinkable. If you can get this on tap, give it a try and enjoy!  EDIT, AUGUST 3, 2006 Bottled version is just a notch down in smell and taste, which drops the drinkability a bit as well. Otherwise much the same. Hence . . . A 4.0 S 3.5 T 4.0 M 3.5 D 4.0 yielding an average of 3.85.  By the way, this goes great with spicey food.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,becktone,4.08,"The beer pours a bit clearer than I expected. It is very light gold in color, almost the color of watered down mead. To be honest this beer looks exactly(with the exception of carbonation and head) like a korean drink called Shi-Kay(its basically rice water, very good.not sure about the spelling on that one). The beer begins the pour with a very large a rocky white head. However, the head does deteoriate to become a much thinner whtie head. Though the size might not be very impressive the retention is quite good. The size could be due to the cleanliness of the glass so I will not let it influence my rating.  To the nose this beer is just about above average. It smells good, however I think that a stronger nose would improve the aroma of this beer. It would make the complex aromas much easier to smell and appreaciate. It is reminescent of oranges-very much in the background-, also apparent are some spices, also reminds me of lemons/citrus aromas.  On the tongue this beer is very refreshing. The first and most apparent character of this beer that I taste is a spicy flavor. Next comes a huge lemon/orange/citrus taste. Other flavors in the foreground are a citrus and orange flavor. The beer is sweet on the front of the tongue and is nicely offset by bitterness from the hops. Other than being used to balance the malt sweetness I taste no other hop influence.  This beer is light on the palate and is very refreshing. The carbonation does not get in the way of the complex flavor of this beer. It finishes dry and in my opinion there isn't anything that can beat Hoegaarden or any other wheat beer on a hot day. This is a beer that I will definitely be coming back to. It is definitely worth a try. It goes down easy and is very refreshing.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Taste : Ok now we are getting to the good stuff. Not very hoppy if ya ask me, the bitterness is almost not there. Citrus flavor is present is a tart or acid form. Almost like lemons oddly enough. Very mellow, crisp flavor.  Mouthfeel : Very smooth and doesn't bite at your tongue too much. Not too watery and not too thick.  Drinkability : Ok i'll put it this way, you can drink it in the summer because of it's smoothness and refreshing lemony tones or even in the winter as a beer with enough body to make you feel just right.

Smell: Some bits of citrus, yeast, spices, etc. I'm very impressed by it, though it might be because I'm new to the smell.  Taste: Lightly sweet, with yeast, mild citrus, spices (including mild pepper) and maybe something like banana bread. Fairly refreshing. The flavor isn't too strong, though possibly it would be overkill if it were stronger.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with a feel not unlike a hefeweizen. Smooth with low carbonation.  Drinkability: A very drinkable beer, fairly low feel of alcohol. However, the unique flavor may be a bit of a hinderance to drinking more than a couple.  I've never had a white ale before, so this was something new. I was quite impressed. I like the look and the flavor, but I'm not sure how likely it would be for me to get this again. Something about it's look/feel/taste make it seem a bit like a novelty.

83,248,jettjon,3.63,"Highs: Drinkability Lows: None within style  Not being a huge fan of the style, I really wanted to enjoy this Belgian white. Following the instructions on the bottle (laugh) yielded a characteristically cloudy yellowish-orange pour (described by onlookers as cloudy urine color) with very few bubbles and visible sediment. The pillowy white head quickly faded to nothing, leaving no lacing at all. I guess this is par for the course for white ales/witbiers. Nose was dominated by orange, but since I had opted for the orange slice, Im sure it was more due to that than the beer. Otherwise nose contained notes of spice, mostly cinnamon. Taste was again dominated by the orange, wheat/yeast, along with an enjoyable clove flavor. However, that was about it for flavor complexity. Mouth was characteristically watery and bubblynot much to write home about, but again characteristic and again not my favorite style. Drinkability was good as with any decent-tasting witbier: its easy to drink and unassuming, and pretty tasty to boot.  Overall: I assume that Hoegaarden represents one of the better witbiers out there. As such, I must admit that I am not a fan of the style.

83,248,Westsidethreat,3.61,"A: America domestic meets lemonade. Very light and cloudy with a snow white head.  S: Subtely attractive aroma of citrus, orange peel and clove.  T: Light and refreshing. Flavors of anise, honey suckle, sweet wheat malt and spice.  M: Touch watery and thin.  D: A well balanced beer, as always",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,asabreed,3.83,"12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. Best by 5/21/07.  Appearance: Huge foamy white head. It took me a while to pour the rest in after the swirl, which I certainly do with a Wit. I've had this before on tap and it's never been like this. Hazy tinted light yellow body with a nice amount of bubbles cascading around the glass. Lacing's spotty but covers a lot once the head dissipates.  Smell: Heavy Belgian yeast, slight coriander, citrus, lemon grass, and light cream. I wish there was more of everything, as far as everything being more discernible and harder edged, but it's fairly nice as it is.  Taste: I wish this was spicier and less subdued; that's why I give it the 3.5 rating. It's way too tame for a Wit. The citrus and Belgian yeast strains are there, and there are some spices, but there could be much more flavor.  Mouthfeel: Pretty creamy, a nice amount of carbonation to the body. Maybe too creamy? Still, I dig it. Maybe more flavor would mean more carbonation. But I'm not sure about that at all and am probably wrong.  Drinkability: This is one of the best Witbiers you can buy for the price and availability in my opinion. And after all, it's summer. For around $10 for a 6-pack and for how much food you can enjoy with this, not to mention the ABV being fairly low, I'll be drinking Hoegaarden again.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,gbarron,4.15,"On tap, 5/18/06. The original revival beer of the white beer style. Thank you Pierre Celis.  A - color is a beautiful neon yellow, almost like lemon curd. Head is bright white, almost blinding, and rocky. Very cloudy and virtually opaque.  S - wonderful aroma of spices, fruit. Can definitely smell the corriander, some fruity/sugary esters come off from the Belgian yeast and wheat content. Light, fresh background of spicy noble hops as well.  T - extremely tasty and refreshing brew, and I'm not normally a wheat beer fan. Light flavor of wheat malt, slightly toasty. Strong flavor of corriander, citrus (orange peel). Slight hints of cotton candy, bubble gum, tart lactic acid. Firm but subtle hop bitterness balances out the belgian sweetness.  M - very light bodied, carbonation is a bit high for my taste, but on par with style. A little dry.  D - definitely a beer you could put back many of in an evening and not be too worried about the effects. A perfectly balanced beer, light and refreshing.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,Cresant,3.26,"Poured the Hoegaarden from a 12 oz. bottle dated 19/4/07.  A pretty frosty, cloudy white/pale yellow body capped by a nice 2"" head.  Mild malty, grain-like smell. Faint metallic odor.  Hops on the palate first, then the light sweetness, finishing pleasantly tart. Refreshing, subtle, delicate. Sweet-tarts and coriander.  Smooth, thin mouthfeel. Hidden alcohol. Low carbonation.  Easy to drink, yet not challenging enough to want more that one.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,shererjt,4.07,"Poured a hazy, very light yellow with good carbonation and a firm, rocky, long-lasting head. If you didn't know what you were looking at, this one would throw you for a loop. Aroma was primarily coriander. I have no idea who came up with the notion of putting coriander in beer, but I'm sure glad they did. The orange was also very notable. Otherwise, maybe a bit of wheat and that was it. Light body but bursting with flavor. Lots of spice; not a whole lot of malt but enough to keep things in balance. More wheat in the flavor than in the aroma, though. Mouthfeel was lively and the drinkability was quite good.  This is possibly the quintessential lawnmower/thirst quencher, and a personal favorite. Yum.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,Phocion,3.85,"The first time I had this was on tap, and it really left a bad impression on me. About a month later I picked up a 6-pack, and it's been one of my favorites ever since. I'm convinced that my first experience was killed by the lemon they served with the beer.  Poured into the hexagonal Hoegaarden glass with a very cloudy light yellow color with a small head. The hazy effect is something different, and always a little interesting.  It actually smells a little tarty, but some sweet fruity undertones popped through as well.  Lots of citrus tastes. Like the smell, both sweet and tarty. Not much for hops.  Fairly light-bodied feel, moderate carbonation.  This is a very drinkable beer. It goes down very smooth, and there's few things better on a hot day outside than a 6-pack of Hoegaarden. Incredibly refreshing.  This is an excellent hot-weather drink and fairly easy to find. I almost always keep at least a couple in my fridge. The only downside is that at around $8 for a 6-pack, it gets kind of pricey as an every day drink.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,Orrshow,3.33,"Appearance  Pours a very hazy yellow reminding me of lemon meringue pie. The head is not very present and is off white.  Smell  Smells tart, sweet, grassy, and of citrus. Not bad but a little on the weak side even when I let it warm.  Taste  The taste is semi sweet with a bit of grass flavor. I dont sense much wheat but it is there. I also taste some citrus flavors. There is a sweet tart aftertaste with a touch of bitterness.  Mouthfeel  Barely any carbonation at all. Almost flat. The beer was thin too but I wasnt expecting a lot.  Drinkability  Goes down easy but its not one to savor as its lacking in flavor (that rhymes).  I wasnt overly impressed here, but not disappointed either. Its an average beer that would work for a sunny day.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,CarolinaCardinals,4,"Had this on-tap after a day of touring London in early May. Have had it on-tap in the U.S. on several occasions.  Beer appeared as a pale yellow and was served with a very good head. Nose was of spices and maybe a hint of banana. Taste was wheaty, spicy up front. Hops were definitely not prominently there.

83,248,ablaze,4.2,"Served in beer mug out of 330 mL bottle.  Pours a cloudy yellow with creamy white, lasting head.  Smells of lemon and citrus, clean smell.  Tastes creamy, almost buttery, with lemons, honey and coriander. A nice finish of light wheat and fruits. Malt and hops well balanced and delicious. Alcohol tastes very light and well hidden.  Thick in mouth, and again a creamy trait. Liquid silk.  Can definitely enjoy several with no trouble, and it only gets better over time. A rich beer but very refreshing.  Hoegaarden's classic white beer is a favourite of mine in the summer and is relatively easy to find. Goes well with poultry, particularly turkey. Definitely recommended.  Plus, that Hoegaarden glass is just magnificent!",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,goochpunch,3.53,"Pours out a cloudy lemonade with a fluffy white head. Smells phenolic with the wheat snap. Hardly, if any, spicing. There are the yeasty and wheaty characteristics in the flavor, but it seems muted. Kind of like club soda in the finish. Mouthfeel is pleasantly carbonated and lively, but is too watery. All in all, it's rather refreshing and drinkable. A light wit with little to no spicing.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,audiojon,4.33,"I was overjoyed to find that my favorite local bar (not a beer bar mind you) has this on tap permanently now. That said, this review is of the bottled variety. The weather has recently become very hot, and this afternoon I found myself craving a nice light summertime brew. I headed to BevMo and spent some time wandering the aisles trying to figure out what would fit my craving, when I noticed a 6-pack of Hoegaarden wink at me from inside the freezer case. What's this- they have Hoegaarden already chilled? Done. I grabbed the 6er and headed home. This beer, while maybe not the most unique beer out there, serves a very fine purpose. Total refreshment. This is a staple in my fridge, and is delicious any time, but especially if the sun happens to be shining on ya and it's a relaxing 85 degrees outside.  Highly recommended.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

I pick up on coriander, clove, banana, orange.  The flavor is very refreshing. There are a lot of fruity esters along with some spiciness like clove and coriander. There seems to be that spiciness you get from Ardennes Yeast strains.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation.  This is a very drinkable beer. It is very refreshing and not to much for the pallate to handle. I will definately revisit this beer.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

83,248,IPhantom,4,"Serving type- 12 oz. brown classic bottle poured inexpertly in to some kind of glass. First beer cracked after a long finals week, might I add.  Appearance- Pale yellow with effervescent highlights, like a Notre Dame helmet under the lights. Pristine white head a full 3 fingers thick at first pour, diminishing to about half a finger with a nice landscape of lacing.  Smell- Wit-s aren't really my thing, aroma-wise, but this one is nice. Kinda like grandma's bread dough before she has you knead it because of her arthritis...but maybe that's just me. Lemonade-y citrus highlights in the background.  Taste- Again, not a big wit guy, but I like it. Slightly sweet/sour with the wheat to back it up, like chasing a bite of toast with orange juice. Nice amount of dry hoppiness (with something like a raisin subtly suggested) on the end keeps it fresh.  Mouthfeel- Light, bubbly, champagne-like, very refreshing.  Drinkability- Hell, I'll drink another one right now.  Overall, a very nice introduction to wheat beers (and beer reviews).

Color is a pale lemony yellow , and the ale is very cloudy.  Aroma - coriander, and some bready malt.  Taste - just like the aroma, spicy corinader and hint of bready malt. But mostly just a delicious, tingly, coriander flavor.  Mouthfeel - full, a little bit chewy, and a surprising amount of carbonation ( which is a lot, and surprising because the densely cloudy apprearance of the ale completely obscures the carbonation visually).

The unfiltered nature of the ale is clear. There is a slight ring of lace around the glass.  Smell: The ale smells of orange peel, a sweet citrusy aroma (not a hop aroma, mind you).  Taste: The coriander and orange peel dominate the taste of the ale. I was hoping for a bit more of a wheat presence, but the spices are smooth and pleasant.  Mouthfeel: The ale is sweet and smooth, very pleasing on the palate.

No aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, lightly effervescent.  Drinkability: Not bad due to the beer's light character and ease on the palette.  Overall it's not too bad of a brew. Unfortunately, it seems short on the good malt flavors and creaminess, which would definitely bump it a bit in the taste/mouthfeel.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

However back then I would only drink it when I could anything but crap (IE when I came home from school and Dad bought the beer). It really halped turn me on to other Belgians which led to my obsession with craft beer in general. Thus, this one will always have sentimental value.  12 ounce bottle poured into a pilsner glass.  A - A nice translucent white color with a little yellow tint. Lots of effervescent bubbles feed a decent sized white head. A bit cloudy, as I know this is an unfiltered brew.  S - Big yeast on the nose along with a banana smell. A bit of a peppery smell hangs in there too. A nice aroma for a wit.  T - More of the yeasty, wheaty taste up front with the bananas and peppery spices in there as well. Not bad at all.  M - A fairly light feel with some nice carbonation hitting the tongue.

Ends with some sourness.  T: Mildly sweet and almost immediately with a mild sour from the wheat. Still carries through with the same flavor profile as the nose. May even have some touches of anise in the background. Finishes a bit tart. Aftertaste lingers with spices. Some mace prick. Some pepper bite.  M: Bracing. Evervescent carbonation. Refreshing. Has a bigger body than I'd expect from the color, but isn't heavy at all. Finishes with a dry touch.  Overall: Really enjoy this beer and the fact that it's supremely drinkable enhances its appeal.

83,248,Gueuzedude,3.8,"This beer pours quite hazy with a straw color that almost has a tint of green to it. The head is initially three-fingers thick and is a pale, almost white color that sticks around for a fair amount of time. The aroma is almost bready with a yeasty note and there is a tart, green apple note here as well. As I delve in deeper that characteristic, earthy coriander spice note asserts itself, as well as some soft citrus notes.  The taste has a certain fullness to it, though overall it is quite light and refreshing. There is lots of spiciness here as well; definite notes of coriander, and citrus peel, as well as other notes of ginger, pepper, and clove. There is a fair amount of sweetness here as well, it just hides or sort of melds with the spicy notes. The citrus character, in combination with the light tartness, reminds me most of lemons. There is a nice, light tartness here that keeps this beer quite light on the palate. There is a certain, almost chewy grain character here that is only accentuated by the impact on the palate of the slight body fullness from this beer.  I am a sucker for Wits, especially on warm days (it hit 90*F here for the first time this year here), where I find them refreshing and invigorating. I have not had this in a long time, but I am quite happy to drink this beer, it is certainly much better than quite a few American interpretations of this brew (of course a lot of the American interpretations are better than this), which is a pleasant experience from this once only example of the style.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

It's does have a white-ish yellow color. Head retention is minimal but is a great white color. Has sort of a spicy smell to it. You can smell the hops and some honey. Taste: a bit unusual. This really does fall into it's own category. Not for the beer faint of heart. It is not bad, nor is it insanely bitter, but it does not taste like an ale or even your typical lager. So, heads up! Anyway, it is very citrusy and I can usually taste a bit of honey. Not very bitter but enough to give it some flavor. Mouthfeel: Light and bubbly. Good carbonation and washes down cleanly.

The smell is full of citrus, with orange zest and lemon drops on top of a grassy wheat aroma. Digging deep there is a hint of bubblegum type sweetness in there.  The beer enters the mouth tasting watery, but goes on to finish with a fair bit of orange zest and lemon tartness.

While not my favorite beer, this beer is good and worthy of buying an other bottle in the future.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,custardcb,4,"Followed the instructions in my proper Hoegaarden glass to achieve a nice fluffy white head. Bubbles are pretty large and retain their structure, after a while it reduces down to a nice lacy film across the top of the beverage.  The nose is a little sweet with citrus, wheat, and lemon grass immeadiatly popping out. Very nice balance of aromas here that isn't too overpowering but builds the anticipation.  The taste is more from the nose but with a nice close presence. It is very smoothe and clean tastey that leaves a pleasant feel in the mouth. The ABV makes it a good session beer on those hot summer nights.  Always one of my favorites and mixes well too. For those who aren't too found of beer doing half this with half lemonade is fantastic, little trick I learned in Germany while drinking wheat beers a few years ago.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,Phatz,3.4,"This beer is not just 'called' white beer it literally is a WHITE beer. It pours a slightly off white color and has white head with a very short retention. Quite heavy lacing.  Smell: Very potent! Yeast, Lemon, citrus rinds and wheat fill your nose with lots of strong pleasant aromas.  Taste: The taste is similar to the smell. It is very active. There is a significant spicy hop character creating the flavor of cloves lemon peels and pepper. It is not overly bitey though, because the cool watery center carries a light yeasty sweet whit bread character through your mouth washing the tart citrus away as quickly as it developed. Mildly interesting but overall average for the style.  Mouthfeel: Something about the mouthfeel creates a strange stall for me. This beer is somewhat smooth but just before swallowing it stalls for a moment. Basically it does not slide down easily. I am not sure if it is the peppery character of the beer or the hops but it tickles my throat causing me to need to think about swallowing it. Strange.  Drinkability: This beer feels cool and refreshing in the mouth but did not seem to finish smoothly. It may have just been me today so I will try it again. For now I will say it is a fine Witbier and suitable for a hot day.  Hope this is helpful. Cheers!",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Mouthfeel: it feals refreshing, good carbonation and smooth.

83,248,geexploitation,4.16,"So supposedly this is the benchmark witbier... or, according to some, it used to be until it was bought by InBev. Pours a very hazy pale straw colored, tinged with green. Decent head, but the green tinge is a bit off-putting. The nose is centered around coriander, with a basis of citrus (lemon/orange, some kind of hybrid)... very warm smelling and appealing. The taste is dominated by carbonation up front, then the coriander and a late, lemony taste in the back of the throat, oddly enough. The taste structure and mouthfeel is very light -- like the wine spritzer of the beer world, but in a good way. This is one tasty, eminently quaffable beer, whose reputation is justifed IMO... although I'd love to taste the older version of this beer, if it's actually different like people say.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

83,248,Metalmonk,3.98,"Pours a lasting bright white head with very light yellow body color. Moderate carbonation, light lace, and that feature of many witbiers: a lovely swirly haze. A good-looker.  Smells are faint, with yeast, spices, white pepper and banana all coming to the nose.  This is a smooth, easy-drinking witbier with plenty of character in the flavors: banana, orange zest, some less obvious fruits, some sharp spices in the background and a bit of a bubblegum sweetness.  Creamy, zesty mouthfeel, plenty of carbonation but it's not obtrusive.  At a low ABV (as with most witbiers) this is an eminently drinkable, enjoyable, thankfully easy-to-find brew. It's always good, but the one hesitation I have with it is I've found it to be one of the more inconsistent beers. My previous experiences with it have varied widely from tap to bottle, and amongst all the bottles I've had (dozens) I've found it somewhat temperamental to all the usual beer variables (more so than most): heat, cold, sunlight, darkness, temperature served, glassware used, amount of sediment swirled into the glass, etc. It's never been bad, just often varying a few degrees one way or another. Not sure if it's me or the beer, I'm guessing the beer, but I thought I'd mention it.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Ginger and clove come out in the mouth, with a sort of citric edge to it - I like the mouthfeel; it's like cotton candy, very light and effervescent.  This isn't really a thinking man's brew, I wouldn't say, but for a hot summer's day, I think it's a great pick - think spiced fizzy lemonade. Yum.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Light-bodied, but full-flavored.  Drinkability: Really couldn't be any better. This brew goes down super smooth and easy and I could easily have another, especially on a hot summer day.

The liquid looks the same as the Celis... slightly lighter than the Unibroue.  S: Plenty of aroma. Earthier than the Celis.  T: More clove than the other two. A little earth, citrous, bubble-gum & bready malt, nice rounded flavour.  M: The body and carbonation fit between the other two, but it seems to be the creamiest!  D: Very good.

83,248,SkeeterHawk,4.12,"Appearance: Initially pours a really cloudy pale yellow color with almost a half-inch active white foam on top. The head was just a small ring around the top of the beer within a minute or so. The beer is so cloudy, you can hardly tell how many bubbles are rising.  Aroma: Dry grainy/wheaty aroma with a hint of light lemon citrus. It has a bit of a tartness to it that I would expect to find in a Berliner Weisse (which is what this beer looks like). Among all of this citrus, there is a subtle floral note that plays a significant part of the whole wheaty meld.  Taste: The flavor is not disappointing with regards to the aroma. There is a dominant dry grainy wheatbread like flavor that mostly dominates. These flavors are supported by the lemony notes. The floral is a much bigger part of the flavor than it was in the aroma, and it starts to take over to lead you into the finish. The finish itself is rather wet and refreshing. The beer is well attenuated, but the hopping is low enough to let the malt win out in the end. Since it is so attenuated, it leaves you with a clean palate for your next sip. The sourness that I perceived in the nose is not apparent in the flavor...or is obscured by the lemon. The carbonation should be more aggressive to really make this beer shine.  Opinion: I am really enjoying this beer. It has a light but complex flavor profile that tells me that I can put these away all night. The wheat takes a bit of getting used to, but I like the fact that they aren't accompanied with a bunch of cloves and bananas like you get just across the border. I have had this beer on tap before, but that was before I was really working on my palate...I would like to drink this beer more.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Had to grab my quadmate and show him this interesting hue.Its creamy clear with a slight yellow tinge. The smell is pretty decent, coriander and citrus dominate, smell is on par with what I was expecting. Taste is pretty good, coriander really comes through strong with a crisp refreshing aftertaste. This is a fairly smooth brew, the flavors subside quickly in the aftertaste. As far as drinkability goes, I can see myself drinking a ton of this in the warmer months to come.

Head dies down to a thin layer of suds with lacing going down the glass as I drink. Hard to detect much of a scent, it's there just pretty faint.  Spicing is evident up front, followed by a mix of fruity esters and yeast. Goes down crisp and easy, very quaffable, I could drink many of these and not get sick of them or regret it the next morning.  I like the way this beer tastes, but I also find it to be very bland. At 5% abv I don't expect this beer to be a powerhouse of flavor, however judging this against the best witbiers that I've had leads me to the conclusion that this beer is just lacking in the flavor department. Hence I can only rate it as average for taste. I do like the way it looks though. This is the first time I've had a wit in a while, and I forgot just how pale these things are.

The mouthfeel is light and crispy, yet creamy. It's very refreshing and easy drinking.  Now, once and for all, it's pronounced ""who-garden,"" not ""ho-garden.""

Basically, this is a half Duvel, or slightly less aromatic Saison Dupont. If you know those beers and like them, you should try this too. These are all readily available at most decent liquor stores.  Not as heady as Duvel, in either conotation, but foamy enough. The head doesn't sustain itself for the whole drink. Sublte spring smells and a crisp flavor. Drinks very nicely, plenty of bubbles, but should be chilled. Letting this up to room temp, even a little puddle, creates the smell of a frat house. That's pretty amazing actually becasue that little puddle doesn't taste too bad even room temp, but not recommended.  This is good in every respect.

The aroma is a yeasty bread aroma with a lemon twang to it. The mouthfeel is very light with zesty carbonation. This taste is light and refreshing with a heavy wheat flavor than ends with a slightly bitter citrus bite. The aftertaste has a slight medicine and hops flavor. This of course is the flagship witbiere. I like it but there are some serious contenders out there. Hoegaarden is better on tap in my opinion.

Tasted initially of a powerful banana with a slight cherry sweetness and a little bubble gum. Some fruit flavors then made themselves noticed with some coriander and dark sour cherries.

A wonderful pour and sight to behold - the same straw color that I remember. Very opaque and cloudy with a wonderful head, and of course, ya gotta love the yeast on the bottom. I did swirl the bottle and watch as it helped the head fill up the top of my pint glass. Very malty taste, with hints of banana, clove, and a bit of bubble gum. It's addicting, never quite the same twice, and neither boring nor too ""out there"" to turn off the novice drinker. I consider this a good spring beer, just because it has the anticipation and excitement of the changing of the seasons brings along with it.  I enjoy the Allagash and Sam Adams White Ale's as well, and this to me is a bit more ""tried and true"" than they are.

83,248,JudgeRoughneck,3.13,"I got this one on tap because I was curious about how it would be different. It came to the table extremely cloudy and that did not change as I drank. It was a translucent but bright yellow to white color, bar was kinda dark. I basically felt like I was looking at a lemon-sorbet or frozen lemonade in the process of melting. There were a few mottled spots floating on the surface but otherwise no head and no lacing. Possibly because it was served with an orange wedge? Thats a new one.  The nose was fragrant and fruity, but slightly artificial. My friend said it reminded him of a ""freshly waxed floor"". I agree. The strong yeastyness no doubt contributes to this affect.  Though this pint is somewhat lacking in other areas, it more or less has it where it counts, taste. First few sips were overpoweringly yeasty, but soon I was getting citrusy orange and lemon with a slight zest. This gave way to more rich bananna taste with a little mango, strawberry, or orange sliding in before that yeast comes back to finish the job.  Mouthfeel was thick, a tad waxy, and grainy even at times.  What makes this beer fun is that almost no two sips were really the same. Unfortunately it also left the palate rather exhausted after one which is definately going to hurt drinkability. Normally I would suspect this beer was spoiled, but I've had it from the bottle a few times and its not that far off, just a bit old maybe, but I chalk it up to the great and mysterious difference between bottles and draft.

A massive snow-white head over three fingers reduces to a tight, long-lasting cap of foam; but produces minimal lacing. Strong belgian phenolic smell; like crayons and cloves. Extra pale malt and wheat aromas in the background. The taste is sweet, lots of wheat and pale malt, with a powdery yeast character. A subtle clove and coriander spiciness provides a delicate balance without need for much hop influence; which are almost totally absent.

83,248,Kulrak,3.92,"Pours a pale and very cloudy yellow color with no head at all. It looks very intriguing. The smell is yeasty and a little estery, like my own home-brewed ales. We're off to a good start. The taste is.. unusual, even for a witbier. I like the style, and I like this one, though I'm having trouble describing it. It just tastes like a nice yeasty ale. Mouthfeel is heavy, almost like drinking juice with a lot of carbonation. All in all, it's very drinkable, not really a session beer, but as a treat, it's a great beer.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

83,248,trevorwideman,4.05,"I have a long history with this beer, which makes it strange that I haven't reviewed it yet.  Poured into a goblet, very pale yellowish off-white unfiltered brew. Very lovely, nice carbonation, and great medium head that sticks around for a while, pretty lacing. I always liked the look of this beer, even when I knew nothing about beer and beer styles. Smell is of cloves, coriander, and lots of citrusy notes. Taste is a bit bready, with a refreshing lemony zestiness, very clean, but not too complex. Seems a bit weak in the mouthfeel, and I find it a little soft on the palate, but it sure slides down easily. This is a solid witbier, and still one of my perennial favorites.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Appearance: cloudy, pale yellow with a pillowy white head that sits nicely on the glass, better retention than the last few witbiers I've had. Smell: Cloves and citrus Taste: I still get an unusual taste from Hoegaarden that reminds me of the first time I had it in Belgium. It reminds me of cheap bubblegum (but in a good way). Mouthfeel: Palate cleansingly fizzy, yet delicate. Drinkability: I can drink this all night quite happily. This is the standard by which I judge witbiers, and my fallback beer when I want something to quench my thirst.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,Naes,4,"This beer is a very pale yellow, almost white in color with a huge white bubbly head. The smell is quite aromatic. It is yeasty and has a citrus nose as well. Its flavor is a wonderful match to its aroma. Yeast and a bit of citrus on the tongue. There is also a bit of clove presence with a slight lemon flavor. Quite good for a witbier. Mouth feel is light bodied and moderately carbonated.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,arguemaniac,4.4,"Pours a very pale and quite hazy yellow with a creamy white that reduces, but never disappears. Citrus and clove in the nose. The palate also includes an acidic citrus bite and a peppery clove spiciness, but there is some mellow grain flavor as well. Light mouthfeel with a mild carbonation tang.  Almost universally regarded as the prime example of the style, and with good reason; its light, refreshing, and easygoing but it also features a spicy acidity that keeps it interesting. All in all, a very drinkable combination. Highly recommended.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,Gaben,4.04,"Bought about a 6 pack/12 oz bottles for this was around ten dollars and ended up getting it again the next week.  The appearance is great! by far the best looking witbier Ive pourn so far, very cloudy and white ""as for they did call it:White Cloud!""  Smell is witbierish but it does have a weird aroma , kinda like lavander or soap. As for the taste that would have to be the same as how it smells and may I say thats the great thing about this brew. Very clean and crisp , even with that taste of soap makes this brew a booming choice.  Mouthfeel is nice as well, very goot and solid but not so rough, like most white ale's, very wheaty, tangy, and always something to look forward to.  Drinkability is a downfall , I did drink about 4 of these in an hour and a half , but I wouldnt want to have more then 2 of these in a night if I did have a choice. So yes white cloud is a nice beer to check out and if you havint had it before , it will be a must have for you to taste test for yourself.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Smell - fresh with some citrus and spice right up front.  Taste - Crisp and clean, lemon flavor really come through  Mouthfeel - Carbonation really comes out in the mouth, almost acidic. Really needs some fatty foods (heavy in butter and cream) to really bring out the nature of this ale.  Drinkability - Overall an easy drinking white ale.

The aroma has big fruity notes: banana, orange and lemon rind, along with some spice (corriander and clove) and a wheaty twang. The flavor begins with some nice banana and citrus notes, then some light spice (corriander, clove, anise), some wheaty sourness, bread dough and some more fruity esters. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing with moderate high carbonation. Drinkability is excellent. I realize it's unfashionable on here to praise inbev brews, but as far as i can tell this beer tastes about the same, and its pretty tasty.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

I find it to have a much cleaner taste than ""Blue Moon"" which is billed as a ""belgian white"". It has a good mouthfeel to it, although it can get bitter after a while. All in all it's a good beer.  I agree with another reviewer, though, that for Belgium...there are better beers.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,danielharper,3.68,"Purchased from Great Spirits, Huntsville, AL.  Pours a white-yellow body with a thick, thick, thick white head. I'm having to use two or three separate pours in order to get all the beer into the glass at one time. Body is very cloudy, so much so that the beer isn't even really translucent -- I can't see objects on the other side of the glass. Still, no visible yeast -- it appears to be all in suspension.  The aroma is decent. A very strong dose of a bland ""wheat"" nose at first, with a top level of various spices and compounds that I can't quite place. Reminds me more of a dessert than a beer.  Taste is interesting -- a bit of tart up-front to assault the taste buds, with a soothing spiciness at the back end. Leaves a touch of astringency on the palate, but nothing too severe. When consumed fairly warm, an interesting Belgian funk becomes present.  Thin, watery mouthfeel. No real presence to speak of, and nothing to coat the palate.  This was one of the first craft beers I ever tried, and I haven't had it since then. This is a reasonably decent beer, one that I'll have from time to time but can't call a personal favorite.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

The appearance certainly let's you know that this is not your average beer. Very pale. Like watered-down lemonade. Cloudy [since it is unfiltered]. Quite startling to look at. A nice white head. Good retention. The smell is also unique: Orange. Bananas. Clove. All sorts of spices jump out. Sweet. The taste follows the smell: spices, tangerine, banana. Refreshing. I found the mouthfeel quite refreshing. There is ample carbonation which gave it a very cleansing on the palate. Overall, a very drinkable beer. Nice and light for a warm summer day.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Taste is slightly bitter, oranges, pepper...nice twangy slightly hoppy aftertaste. Really full and refreshing taste. Mouthfeel is a little light. Taste like a Duvel just a bit lighter bodied and without the alcohol warmth. Not bad at all, drinkability is good but maybe not great.

White with a splash of yellow and cloudy. Some lacing throughout the glass.  Smell is yeasty, but spicy. Can't put my finger on what spice though.  The taste is really quite interesting. Yeasty and spicy thoroughout. No malt of hops really evident. A bit of wheat character towards the end of the glass. The mild aftertaste reminds me of drinking club soda.

83,248,Litterbean,3.93,"After trying a few American interpretations of the Belgian White Ale, I decided to get one from the source itself.  White Ale, indeed. Pours a pale, pale yellow but with the yeast it turns almost white. A nice fluffy head sits atop it.  The smell is potent and pleasant, with a yeasty character all over. Hints of bananas and citrus fruit, plus sweet candied sugar.  Sweet taste, but with a hints of yeast. More bananas and a dry character rounds this one off. Not as complex or as bold as other ales of the style, like a Celis White and especially Allagash. Still, it's delicious and should be tried by all.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Appearance - This beer is very murky and cloudy, an off golden colour with a very smooth white head that looks like shaving foam. Millions of bubbles going up inside the glass add to the great appearance.  Taste - The taste is mix of citrus, spices and then an aftertaste hint of sugar and bananas. A very nice beer to sup of an evening. Despite all these flavours, the beer is still very easy to drink.  Mouthfeel - Fairly fizzy and bubbly but in a good way, goes down nice and easy.

Sweet notes cheer up tastebuds, and hops bite on the tongue. Light body.  I am not a big fan of wheat beers, but it is such a nice change on a hot summer day. This review is of a bottle, but I do order it occassionally when I want some light to relax.  Here is an interesting tidbit of information: This review is based on a bottle I received as a gift from Israel. It probably goes down so nice there in all the heat.

83,248,daliandragon,3.85,"I'll be honest. I've had a crush on Hoegaarden White ever since I travelled in Belgium five years ago. Not even just the beer itself, but even the trademark and glassware. I treated myself to a 250ml sampling at the 3 Alley Pub in Itaewon, Seoul this past weekend just to record this classic for posterity (and drink a rare good beer in Korea). This is a beautiful beer..cloudy yet still bright, with a massive fortress of thick head. The pleasant wafting of citrus, wheaty, goodness envelops my nose without overpowering it. Even forgetting its taste, this beer is outstandingly refreshing and light, with a texture somewhat reminiscent of lemonade. The full flavor sits on the roof of the mouth and soaks in, which is brilliant. This is a beer of no small complexity, every sip seems to offer a little something different. Ironically, despite my fondness for Hoegaareden, I mark it down slightly for drinkability simply because I enjoy it so much I consider it a special occassion beer. I rarely have more than one at a sitting and it seems to mix well with others, which can't be said of all beers. Regardless, this is a quality beer I've enjoyed all over the world.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

83,248,NClifestyle,3.62,"In a sense, it has the great qualities of beer and, in some ways lemonade. It is light, but has body to give. Drank on tap and poured into a thick, 6-sided Hoegaarden glass, the beer has a hazy yellow, almost fluorescent color about it. The draught did not allow for much foam, but what head the beer had was made up of big, white bubbles. The aroma of this beer is quite nice, with hints of fresh grass and flowers, along with the expected lemon. Hoegaarden starts with a sweet taste of yeast and maybe banana, followed by a lemon and citrus taste. You do notice some tart flavor near the back of the mouth, although it offers a crisp finish. Mid mouth, a fruit and spice character is noticeable. A definite bittersweet finish is present. As it warms, a honey taste arises from the ale. This wheat beer has some bubbles and thickens as you drink it to a perfect creamy medium with a fresh mouthfeel; Smooth and creamy, but not thick at all, and not overly yeasty. At 5% ABV, you will know its not a light beer, but its not so strong that you cant drink a few. Possibly the easiest drinking wheat beer, and is easy to find on tap.

It sets the bar for any witbier produced since, and if this were the standard of judging beers by, I wouldn't doubt this beer would be worthy of a perfect 5.  It pours to a glowing light yellow color that almost looks white through the light. It produces a nice delicate and crispy white head that settles to a millimeter. Carbonation is nice and active.  The smell is enticing. A great blend of unmalted wheat, coriander, and orange peel, with a bit of a clove ester. The bouqet isn't quite as strong as I would have liked, but it is quite delicious.  The taste is great. Light and malty with a little bit of a wheat bite. Orange peel and coriander have a strong showing in the initial taste as well as the finish. A bit of a bite in the finish, as well as a nice yeasty flavor.  A bit dry, but it serves to bring me back in for another quaff.

83,248,BEERchitect,4.45,"There seems to always be a distinct pleasure when drinking a beer that basically defined the style. As originator of today's witbiers, it's hardly arguable that there are any better.  With a soft glow of canary yellow color, the haze of wheat protiens and yeast are evident. The protiens allow for a froathy, cotton head of mousse-like proportions. A very elegant and initing appearance.  Citrus, spice, and floral aromas are a careful blend of corriander, sweet orange peel, and a soft peppery scent; all of which rests on a wheaty scent of light breads or bread dough. Lemony esters and mild malted milk scent give a sturdiness to the nose with zeal and zest.  Lemon flavor with curaco take the early command with an assertive citrus taste. Fresh winter wheat and pilsner malt flavors give a soft bread impression along with mild powdered sugar sweetness and crisp grain flavor follow up and easily govern the middle palate. Crisp lemony notes close the flavor along with a refreshing lactic tartness and malted milk whimsy.  Creamy and somewhat expansive early with a fleeting, spicy finish that reduces to near-watery feel with semi-dry character.  Hoegaarden is the opidome of refreshment with high character and quality. Where the flavor and aroma profiles carry enough complexity with effortless ease, the body might make too quick of a transition and surpasses refreshment into a slight empty or watering ending. Still, nearly an ideal session.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

83,248,GCBrewingCo,3.9,"The beer poured into the chalice hazy pale yellow golden with a white and tall frothy head which retreated to the surface and then lasted to lace the glass.  The aroma was deeply citrusy with bitter orange peel all around coupled with a strong coriander spice presence. The aroma also contained a nice wheat backbone and a slight peppery sense of being.  The flavor was less dramatic than the aroma. The orangey citrus peel flavor was slightly present and more lemony in nature. The spice was low and was mainly coriander.  The finish was dry with lasting wheat, and then slight citrus and slight coriander impressions that fade out into the aftertaste. The body was medium light, but just a bit watery in nature. Very nice aroma, wish the flavor had backed up that promise.  12 ounce bottle, best before 17/05/06 on back label.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Poured into Hoegaarden tumbler in the manner directed on the label, including the final ""swirl and pour"". Appearence was already very cloudy before adding the sediment. Cloudy honey colour with nice white head.  Immediate release of citrus smell. Taste was fresh with a definite citrus peel tang though with a certain sweetness. Had a ""sharpness"" to it that Iliked. Mouthfeel quite smooth and a little syrupy, even a bit soapy.  The head diminished to a 1/2 cm but never disappeared. I have been drinking this beer fairly regularly over the years, it is a solid (lowish alc) offering that is consistent and is a refreshing summer cooler, or middle-of-the-day beer.

There was a tiny head on it that was very white. The aroma consisted of mostly lemons and a little bit of pepper. The taste was even more lemony. It reminded me a lot of lemonade with a lot of carbonation. Very smooth, silky feel to it. This beer is one of a kind and a definite thirst quencher. Perfect for summer. I am not a fan of witbiers, but this is probably the best one I have tried to date.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,BuckeyeNation,3.97,"Blurry, almost milky, pale straw that is as clear as a bell when viewed through direct sunlight. Indirect light truly does give it a 'white' look. The head is white as well: bright, bleached white devoid of even a hint of color. It's also impressively large after the pour, although its inherent softness keeps it from maintaining its size for long. It also prevents much lace from sticking to the glass.  The nose is wonderful, with all of the witbier essentials. You have your sweet orange zestiness, your spicy coriander and your tangy wheatiness that holds it all together and binds it up into a neat little package. It could be a mite stronger, but it's still pretty snazzy.  Hoegaarden is a good wit, not a great one. As in the nose, everything that should be present is present (more or less), but nothing really stands out and demands to be noticed. Coriander is probably the most prominent. Orange peel is now in the background, despite the fact that I'd prefer it to be in the foreground. Subtle is the operative word here.  The beer isn't all that sweet, it isn't hoppy bitter and it isn't wheaty sour. I guess that means it's balanced. The finish leans toward dry without even approaching arid. The same spunky carbonation that created the massive head keeps the mouthfeel hoppin' and is a good fit for the beer as a whole.  Hoegaarden ('The Original Belgian White Beer' according to the label) isn't the best of this style that I've ever tasted, but it's pretty good all the same. While it's a little too laid back for me, I did enjoy all twelve ounces.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Not a strong aroma but pleasant none the less.  Taste is pretty mellow. Not overly sour and very well balanced with a very slight bitterness along side the grainy base. Very clean. Slight spice, possibly corriander.  Goes down very nice and refreshes the senses.

83,248,AlexJ,4.2,"One of my favorite brews for hot weather sippin, always refreshing.  Extremely pale straw yellow color with a dense head of pure white. It is relatively clear until I do the traditional swirl and pour, unleashing a cloudy burst of yeast which hazes the beer wonderfully.  Nose is a nice balance between sweet and sour. Sweet oranges, spice, and unmalted wheat countered by lemony zest and green apple.  Flavor is similar with a superbly refreshing sweet and sour profile. Oranges, honey, grass, green apple, lemon, and sweet spices make this a classic example of the style.  Body is medium light, with a smooth and almost creamy texture. So refreshing and thirst quenching, I think I'll have another. There is a subtle nip of saazy hops in the finish that provides a nice touch of floral accents.  I guess I should thank my Father for introducing me to this beer, he buys a few cases every summer, God bless him!",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Although the mouthfeel is very light, the taste is quite full. Malts are big and bready, serving up some banana sweetness. Hops are a little spicy, with bitter lemon and orange peel characteristics. Lower carbonation than expected allows the flavor to come forward that much more. Finishes slightly fruity with some cleansing citrous.

The bready, yeast aroma accented with a bit of freshly cut grass. This beer has a very delicate mouthfeel and a light body. A wheaty, bready flavor dominates with a subtle, grassy, spiciness mixed with some notes of lemon. Hops are played way down and the finish is just shy of being too sweet and accented with coriander. This is a very easy drinking beer. The spiciness is less distinctive than I remember it being, but the last time I had this beer, I had it on tap -- perhaps the reason for the difference? The wheat flavor is huge in this beer. If you don't like wheat in your beer, your not going to like Hoegaarden.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Initially a bit tart but the coriander and carbonation produce a dry crisp finish.  Mouthfeel: effervescent - crisp and dry, light bodied.  Drinkability: a great afternoon beer, my lawnmower beer of choice. An ideal ABV lends itself to making this a great session beer.  Overall: Hoegaarden makes one helluva wit.

Beautiful witbier appearance cloudy, and inviting. The smells aare a bit lacking, very faint for me, a little too subtle maybe. Flavor comes up a bit short ,i like a little more up front in a beer like this, it seems a little watery, almost as if i was using a frosted glass to drink it .

The smell is a little sour with nothing really taking precedence over anything else, its all well balanced. Initial taste is like a crisp Pilsner again with no forward taste. When you begin to swallow is when the texture really comes out. The lemons are definitely at the forefront of the taste, with carbonation taking it all down.

A beautiful balance between the sweet malted wheat and the coriander spiciness, with a beautiful lingering dryness. Better every sip. It's just so mellow and drinkable, but with enough subtleties to keep you interested. Mouthfeel is smooth, cleansing and refreshing.  A truly wonderful beer.

83,248,Bierschenker,4.4,"*Can: 33cl *Alcohol: 4,9% *Place beer was reviewed: Op kot, Lange Ridderstraat 19/3, B-2800 Mechelen  Hoegaarden is one of my favourite beers. It is a very drinkable beer (read: I can have a lot of them before getting pissed! Because come on, there is a time of reviewing and a time of drinking). You will see that though it is available throughout the year, most Hoegaarden will be sold during the summer. On very hot summer days you will see a lot of people enjoying an ice cold Hoegaarden with some lemon and ice cubes floating in the beer.  Hoegaarden is a classical Witbier, but nevertheless one of my favourites because of its richness in flavours. When you pour it in the real Hexagonal glass it will give you a very wild and foggy white-yellowish beer. Even with al the sparkling activity of this beer, the true art is getting a beautiful head. The odour gives you a very warming and fulfilling feeling. It has some spices and lemon in it. Your first taste gives you a storm on the tip of your tongue, its a very carbonated beer. Then a refreshing flavour of citrus, hop and spices follows. It also gives the feeling of being creamy. This is also caused by the fact that the beer contains yeast. I personally find this beer most enjoyable. I have had a lot of them in the past and more is yet to come. On-tap this beer is enjoyed at its best. But the cans and bottles are ok. The problem with the Witbier on-tap is that it has to flow very regularly. In summer this not really a problem. The yeast is still active, and it works at the end of the installation. When the beer is left in the system for several hours, it can give you a foul tasting brownish beer. Thats why when you pour in a Hoegaarden on-tap, you should let the first beer flow away. A lot of bartenders dont do this. Money above the love for the beer.  Ut vivat, crescat, floreat!",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,spikemoves,4.35,I had this on tap in London last month and it was divine. It is served with a lemon which accents the spicey and citrus tastes. The smell is of spices and lemon or orange peels. It came in the Hoegaarden Hexagonal serving glass which accentuates the experience. In the glass it is cloudy white with a little bit of yellow mixed in. The smell is of spices. If poured correctly (a technique which I have since mastered with my own Hexagonal glass and the Hoegaarden bottles I get at my liqour store) the head just hits the tips of the glass adding about half an inch to and inch at the top.

I find it on tap occasionally, too, and this is the serving style this review focuses on. The main difference is that the nose is slightly stronger on tap.  That nose is bright and highly citrusy. A slight musk is present, but it is not unpleasant. The color is quite nice  pale yellow and cloudy. The head is about ½ inch and is snowy white.  The spice characteristic of this beer is quite strong: cloves, pepper and nutmeg are all evident. There is a heavy orange citrus that blends perfectly with the spice. A sweet bubblegum flavor balances out the heat. The mouthfeel is heavy but well carbonated.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,cncbofh,4.5,"On tap at Sole Restaurant in Philly Town.  An opaque white colored gem with a miniscule head. Smells of lemon and yeast were immediatly noticeable, followed by apricot and sweet honeycomb.  The taste was sweet and sour - lots of traditional wheat characteristics with nice malt and yeast. A spicy fruitiness is followed by a sour aftertaste that lingers for quite a while. Neither thick nor oily, it was a very pleasant session beer. Highly recommended.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,Opethsprite,4.42,"This beast pours a foggy wheat color with a white head that diminished substantially, but didn't completely evaporate. The bottle denotes that this cloudiness is to be expected, as it is unfiltered. The nose is strong in grains with a bit of acidity and fruits. It tastes of yeast, hops, and a modest sweetness on the end. This is a gem, in my book anyway. Enjoyable year-round!",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,Citadel82,4.3,"On tap at MJ Grill in Lower Manhattan. Served way too cold. Had to let it warm up a bit to really enjoy.  Arrived at the table with a wedge of lemon which I discarded. I finger of creamy head. Sunshine yellow and very cloudy. Brought back memories of summer on a very cold day in the Big Apple.  Aroma of fresh cut hay drying in the morning sun, some orange citrus scent mingled with some subtle floral notes. Summer evening on the front porch with friends.  Taste is smooth, bready, cracked wheat with some mild malt taste not too sweet and some peppery spice. Ffinish is mild hop bitterness. The overall sensation is a softly balanced brew.  Light in body and very drinkable. Pair this with spicy Thai or Indian food.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,Beastdog75,3.9,"Ah... Hoegaarden, the beer that brought the witbier style back from the dead. I think we owe much to Mr. Pierre Celis for resurrecting this style, as it is one of the most quenching styles of beer imaginable while still being quite flavorful. This may be an InBev beer now, but it is still probably one of the best wits that I have had to date.  Hoegaarden pours a very pale yellow color with a haziness that is intensified when the yeast sediment is added. If held up to a light, the beer almost looks like an off-white color, true to the ""White Beer"" name. A nice creamy looking foam forms and retains very well, leaving some sticky lace behind. A nice spicy aroma eminates from the beer. Obviously the corriander attributes much to this, but I thought I detected some light cinnamon qualities as well. Some wheaty smells are also present. The mouthfeel is smooth, with a low-moderate level of carbonation. Dangerously drinkable. The flavor is both fruity and spicy, sweet and (mildly) acidic. The corriander presence is probably the most distinguishing feature, although some clove-like notes show up. The fruity flavor is citric, a bit like a mixture of lemon and banana. A wheaty twang is present, and there is some light dryness in the finish. The aftertaste is surprisingly clean, but some of the orange peel flavor comes through. A light, lingering spiciness remains with no alcoholic warmth in the end.  I would have loved to try this beer before Interbrew/InBev got its hands on it. Still a world class beer in my opinion. When I eventually get to Belgium (I'll do it sometime in my life) I'll have to give it a try to see how it compares. Very refreshing and very easy to drink, which epitomizes a witbier.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,CVC,3.86,"Came in a slim 12oz bottle; served in a pint glass. Pours a cloudy pale yellow with a thin pure white head, which dies quickly with thin lace. A mild smell of citrus, lemon, and yeast. Tastes very zesty and lemony with a thin mouthfeel. Extremely drinkable.  This beer is the supposed king of white beers. Besides it's impressive history, I can see why, too--a very drinkable and tasty lunch beer.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Apperance- Huge fluffy head, decent lacing and nice cloudy lemonade like color. More white-grayish than yellow.  Smell- Different spices, pepper, citruis, lemon, orange. Lots of good stuff here.  Taste- I'll have a glass of corriander please. Along with other different spices that I can't describe, plus lots of citrus goodness. Kind of sweet, but kind of sour too. Odd, but very good.  Mouthfeel- Moderate carbonation. Kind of filling. Still goes down super easy because of the yummy taste.  Drinkability- This has always been one of my favorites.

83,248,Biffster,4.15,"The beer pours with a fluffy generous head that slowly drops, leaving a lace around the glass. The beer itself is light straw colored and somewhat cloudy.  The aroma is citrusy and spicy. The coriander and orange peel are evident. There are also floral honey notes, mingling with a touch of malt and bread. There are little estery notes in this sample and no hop aroma, but on the whole, the aroma is balanced and pleasant.  The start is clean but slightly malty. Very little sweetness is evident, and the tartness quickly follows. The beer is spicy, grainy and tart as it follows through and it swallows with a crisp tart finish. The tartness and spiciness linger in a pleasant and not overpowering way.  The mouthfeel is light and fluffy, as to be expected from a Wit. The carbonation is medium/high, but there is a distracting astringency as it finishes.  Wit is one of my favorite styles. I am quite familiar with the style and brew it often myself. This is a fantastic example of the style; much better than I remember from past years from this brewery. It is crisp and tart and refreshing, with only a hint of astringency to mar an other wise perfect experience.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,oracle,3.31,"I had two pints of this at the company x-mas gathering yesterday. The difference in appearance between the two pints was dramatic. The first arrived with about 1/2 inch of head so dense and creamy that I suspect it was a nitro pour (although I've never heard of a belgian wit using nitro). It left pretty decent lacing. The second arrived with a faint wisp of a head and left no lacing.  In all other aspects, these two pints were the same. Beer was light yellow and very cloudy, as typical of unfiltered wheat beers.  Smell was average. Mild ripe bananas and sweetness.  Taste was crisp and clean. Again, a hint of banana and lemons over a mildly sweet malt.  Mouthfeel was light. Low carbonation and minimal aftertaste.  Very drinkable. Probably would have had another if the boss hadn't been sitting there.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,moocey,3.96,"I haven't yet had 100 different beers, so this takes the title of Oddest Beer to Ever Cross my Palate. Is this bananna flavored lemonade, or is it beer? Took me forever to try this one since It's sandwiched between a bunch of shitty imports at my local beer-buying location. Anyway, this beer is unfiltered. I love it when I can't distinguish objects when looking through my pint glass, so unfiltered beers get a high appearance score in my book. I've never seen a yellow unfiltered beer, so I'm giving Hoegaarden a five. It smells wonderful. I must have sniffed the white, frothy head about five or six times before I even took a sip, just because it smelled that good. This beer tastes like bananna-flavored lemonade. What I recognize as malt cannot be found in this beer. Just esters, hops, and yeastiness. (I tried one without yeast, then one with yeast since the back label says you should dump the yeast in.) I didn't notice anything about moutfeel one way or the other, so I give it a score of average. As for drinkability, this is a highly-flavorful light beer that a person could have quite a few of in a drinking session. Four for drinkability.   So, anyway. I don't like the taste of this beer and I""ll never buy it again. However, I do recognize it as a solid beer, even though it doesn't suit my taste.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,tatterdash,4.3,"Pours a cloudy yellow with a foamy white head that laces well. Aroma was a strong citrus smell with some spiciness as well, very different than other beers. Taste was refreshing like most witbiers, though this one tastes a little watery. Very citrusy and some coriander, definitely pleasant but use a little more ""oompf"". Light mouthfeel, but refreshing. I prefer this on draft on the bigger (20oz.) glass, but you must be careful, as many bartenders insist on adding a lemon wedge to it... It is much better without (of course).",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

It forms a decent head, though it doesn't take long to settle.  I'm usually looking out for an off-taste in a white beer. That will make it one to avoid. But this beer taste like it should: a natural water source, wheat and yeast.  I can imagine this beer pairing well with a variety of foods. Perhaps the toughest being poultry.

Starts off with primarily lemon and orange flavors, but quickly develops into spiciness and finishes with some balancing bitterness. A very well-executed intermingling of flavors, if perhaps a bit timid compared to past years. Light and creamy body which is appropriate to the style but not particularly distinctive. A very tasty and refreshing witbier which can be especially enjoyable on a hot summer day. Too bad it's less flavor-full than it used to be.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Smell: Typical of the style, aromas of cloves, Belgian funkiness and traces of sour fruits.  Taste: Fairly shallow; not a whole lot going on here. Flavors seem watered down as compared to others. Basically, what you'd expect of a witbier... cloves first then light sour apples and a drying, bitter finish that coats the mouth. Maybe even a little alkaline in taste.  Mouthfeel: Crisp with medium carbonation. Body is medium to light bodied.  Drinkability: One of the easiest beers in the world to drink loads of.

Moderate corriander spiciness with a bit of lemon and a touch of diacetyl. Very promising aromatics.  Mild buttery diacetyl aspect complimented with a bold corriander spiciness. As the carbonation cuts through the wit at midsip, a watery quality appears and takes away some of the ale's natural flavors.  Light bodied; thin, slightly watery and certainly very fizzy on the palate.  Easily consumable; very pleasant drinking, nothing spectacular in terms of flavor but a nice witbier nonetheless.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Nice nose of spice (pepper and clove) and fruit (orange peel and apple).  The taste is tart and refreshing. I like the way the spices work with and offset the fruit flavors. A very nice combination. No bitterness present at all, I wonder what the IBU rating of this beer is.  The mouthfeel, at least for me, seems a bit stretched. Perhaps this is a more delicate beer than Im used to, but I have had some witts that are more chewy. Easy drinking beer here.

There's not a bit of watery-ness to it, unlike most beers I've had that are this light-bodied.  Very light bodied. Not a meal in a bottle, but a great beer to have on a hot day.  This is highly drinkable. I could down many of these in a session. Unfortunately, I've never seen this in bottles in my area. Otherwise, I'd keep this in mind for accompanying summer grilling.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,cypressbob,4.24,"Served in a hoegaarden glass  The head is pure white, thick and fluffy  Body is light yellow, very cloudy  Smells akin to almonds, to a lesser extent than the grand cru and with less of an alcohol whiff  Taste is very refreshing. Its fruity and fragrant, with very little alcohol kick  All in all, a good beer, easy to drink and good with a variety of food  Goes down very easily, very little alcohol apparant, much better on tap, but a great treat for the summer",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,shapudding,4.33,"Fresh from the tap, cloudy and pale yellow. Reminds me of lemon juice or lemonade. Had just sat there and watched them tap the fresh keg, so this first pour came with a ton of head that reduced quite quickly to a light head, then nothing at all. Lattice lacing. Such a great aroma of bananas. I love the lemon with my wheat bears, just feel it is part of the whole experience, I love citrus. I love the scent of the banana and lemon intermingling, and the flavor of them together. This has such a clean and fresh flavor to it, so very refreshing and light. Mild and mellow finish. Perfect for days in the sun, but so perfect for anytime of the year too. Just a great session beer.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,necoadam,4.38,"On-tap at Eli Cannon's  I liked this beer from the bottle, but on-tap, this is killer stuff. Hazy light yellow for a color with a nice amount of carbonation. Smell consisted of oranges, lemons, some ginger in there as well. Taste held up to form as well. Slighty on the sweet side, but it balances it out with the ginger which you can taste all the way through the aftertaste. Again, killer stuff on-tap.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,Dithyramb,3.85,"Cloudy, yeasty, yellow pour. Smelled very citrusy. Taste was a yeasty bomb goodness. Drank quickly and well. I didn't try it with the lemon slice, so that I could take in the overall flavors. I definitely dig the overwhelming yeast taste, which allowed it to pair well with pizza and sample a few other beers without being overwhelmed.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,HTX,4.38,"Agreeing with everyone else, It has a strong citrus taste with hints of lemon. Heavy on the yeast, light on the hops.  Most bars serve it with a slice of lemon (which is a mistake, in my opinion because it doesn't need it).  Appearance is very cloudy, can't see through it and light yellowish.  Smells agree with taste - yeasty and citrus",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,tjd25,4.05,"Opaque hazy yellow golden color. Lots of citrus, wheat and yeast come to the nose. Sweetness. The taste is of peach, citrus and wheat. Fruity, sweet but not excessively, almost iodated. Hops aren't really noticeable. Very drinkable. Maybe lacking some complexity in the mouthfeel but definitely drinkable. A great summer session brew.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,henrysunset,3.41,"cloudy yellow/straw with white lacing. Looks great.  Scent is sweet and wheaty, with a sulfiric tone to it.  Taste comes across too sulfiric to me. I also sense a bittersweet apricot taste,  It does feel good in the mouth though; very smooth with fine carbonation.  Overall, okay, and rasonably drinkable; i'd just prefer a flavor not clouded wit a sulfiric tone.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,chugamugofsud,3.9,"Hoegaarden was my favorite beer before I got heavily into beer tasting. This beer is an unfiltered wheat that is combined with orange peel and a little bit of a peppery taste to make an excellent white ale. This is essentially the grandpa of that style. It drinks easily, pouring with a medium thickness white head and hiding its biterness until the very end thanks to the citrus flavors. Most anyone who has had Hoegaarden enjoys it and it comes recommended. It does seem to have less to it when you drink this beer on tap, though, so I recommend the bottles. (odd, isn't it?)",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,Zorro,3.5,"Pours a milky off white brew, almost too clear to be a beer.  Smell is spicy and medicinal, lots of clove flavor.  Taste is sweet and spicy with a bit of fruit. Fairly mild flavor.  Mouthfeel is OK I guess.  An OK brew I like stronger stuff normally, I prefer Duvel.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,jvajda,4.08,"Appearance: Cloudy yellow, with a one inch head, just what is expected. Smell: Strong wheat smell, more than expected. Taste: Again, more wheat than I expected, yet still refreshing. Very subtle orange peel and spice nuances. Mouthfeel: Smooth, with a perfect amount of carbonation. This white is welcome in the mouth. Drinkability: I think there are better whites than this, but it is still very good and I think that one could drink this every day.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,Skidz,4.35,"Pours out the palest of all yellows, almost completely clear, but sits a cloudy, pale gold in the glass. Big fluffy white head achieved with almost no effort.  Smells of sweet wheat grains, citrus (lemon, orange), and a nice hoppy layer on top. Great smell overall.  Tastes bitter up front and is accompanied by sweet grains, mild peppery flavors, just the slightest dash of citrus and an over-ripened, starchy, sweet corn flavor that really keeps it all together. The yeast picks up near in the middle, but lingers on well after you swallow. Good amount of bitterness, but fairly mild.  Mouthfeel is smooth and rich, superb carbonation that tickles the tongue, but doesn't bite. Utterly delicious brew, a six pack would be a blast.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,garymuchow,4.5,"This is an exceptional brew. Fresh hop, phenol light fruit. An absolutely delightful aroma. Chalk white fizzy somewhat firm head. Cloudy of yellow gold. Light fruity malt moves to pleasing phenol qualities. Middle is somewhat neutral with a soft fruit (lemon) taste with just a hint of malt dryness and closes with a mild pleasing hop bitterness on the finish. Tingley smooth soft yet crisp. Very thirst quenching. Soft bubbles. Wonderful mouth feel. Deserves all the credit it gets.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,jed,3.83,"Presentation: Comes in a brown, 33 cl bottle. The back of the label has information about the beer, including detailed pouring instructions. Best if consumed by 7/13/05. Poured into a pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a nice, cloudy yellow color with a big, fluffy head. Head has the consistency of whipped egg whites and average head retention. Moderate amount of lacing as the head disappears. Not much in the way of carbonation. There's so much yeast in this beer that you can actually see it sliding down the sides of the glass after your pour.  Smell: Nice, sweet wheat aroma followed by a hint of pepper. Mild sweet citrus notes.  Taste: Sweet wheat nose followed by a wave of mild hop bitterness. Pepper lingers, along with corriander. As with the smell, some citrus notes follow the main flavor. Finish is slightly dry, with yeast flavors that linger on the palette, and a final hint of hop bitterness. Very clean flavor.  Mouthfeel: Very mild carbonation and a very clean flavor. Nothing amazing, but definitely above average.  Drinkability: The flavor gets a little bit boring after more than two of these, so it probably wouldn't be a good session beer. Still, a nice one to enjoy with good drinkability.  Almost as widely available in France as Kronenbourg or Amstel, the venerable Hoegaarden is much better than both. Even bars that have a weak selection of French macro lagers carry this, so it's been my salvation on numerous nights out. Not amazing, but very solid  the perfect introduction to the witbier style for new drinkers.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,donnebaby,4.06,"A frozen pale yellow color. Cloudy and slightly active body. Very controlled fine bubbled head that never completely goes away. Perhaps a little too controlled. Reminded me of velcro. Very presentable all in all.  The smell is wide and citrusy. Light though.  The taste is by and large contiguous with the smell, citrus and coriander. With the light carbonation, and overall feel of creaminess is achieved, which gives this beer an excellent drinkability. Well-balanced, with a small, sweet finish that echoes of creamy pumpkin pie. Yum.  This beer feels somewhat controlled to me. I think I'd prefer a wilder witbeer, with more character in the smell and taste, and a more aggressive mouthfeel. Great beer to drink though.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,LarryKemp,4.32,"This is a text book Belgian White Beer. While reviewing the BJCP guidelines, everything was nearly to style. The beer poured a slightly cloudy, bright golden. The head was white and fluffy but melted faster than I had expected. The aroma was somewhat fruity and the malts and hops were overpowered. The flavor was full but more subtle than I expected. The fruitiness came through and the bitterness - not from the hops - bit my tongue. I was expecting more a raucous flavor palate but was good. The mouthfeel was a little more than light and the carbonation and acid did play with my tongue. I find this a very drinkable beer and would recommend it for someone looking to try their first wit beer.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

The front is spicy/peppery with a touch of schpoenck. But then it disappears. Very subtle body. Finishes dry, nicely bitter with some butter. This is a pretty good, tasty, dry wit.

83,248,granger10,4.33,I followed the directions on the back of the bottle on how to pour this beer and the result was an extremely cloudy lemon color beer with a large frothy white head. Looked like carbonated real lemonade. Lots of lacing. The nose was tarty and acidic but in a very good way. The taste was really nice. Citric fruits with some sweetness were upfront accompanied by a peppery spice. The middle lost its sweetness and become tartier but was still fruity in taste. Coriander seemed to come into the mix there. There is also a wheat precense that seems to come with a clove flavor that reminds of a good hefe. Yeast provides a background and mixes well with the fruity flavors. Acidic finish lingers in my mouth. This is a beer that I could drink all night!,Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,Trentonator,4.4,"Wow, this beer is silky smooth, has a great coriander/orange aroma and a wonderful mouthfeel, very soft and inviting. So much more subtle and tasty than any other Belgian White I have tried. Too many other beers of this genre overdo the spices, this one gets it just right. I could drink these all night, but I would probably fall off my barstool. I think this beer would go wonderfully with some spicy food, or with something that has hints of curry.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Unfortunately the custom glasses are mostly glass and only contain 500 mL of actual beer. The beer looks average in regular glasswear, decent head retention nice pale colour, but nothing special. The real strength of the beer is its mouthfeel. This beer seems to dance on your toungue. The taste is of citrus and spice and is interesting. Would I have another? Probably one, but this i wouldn't drink this all night.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Anyway, Hoegaarden has a decent head and a nice cloudy, flaxen color. It's pungent odor is sweet with hints of clove. The beverage itself has a creamy yet dry texture and has a well balanced mix of clove and citris flavors. The carbonation is just a bit on the high scale but I'm splitting hairs here.  All in all a highly recommended, reasonably priced weissbeir. Cheers!",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,slitherySOB,3.98,"Ahh, the original Belgian witbier. The bottle has directions on how to properly pour it. Basically, pour half, swirl bottle, pour rest. So I did. When all the beer was in my pilzner glass, the beer was a hazy, dark yellow. Like good lemonade with sediment. Massive, three finger head that disipated down to two. Nice, real nice. Hmm, what a smell. Big aroma of bread/yeast, floral citrus, various sweet peppers and spices, barley and wheat malts. Terrific taste. The sweet malts, spices and peppers are balanced well with the citrus and hop acidity. The mouthfeel is a little chunky. One of the negative effects of the yeast, perhaps. Delicious, terrific beer nonetheless. I wonder how long the remaining four bottles will last?",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,Foxman,3.88,"It pours a hazy, lazy lemonade yellow, looking perfect for sippin' on the porch on a hot summer day. A stark white head had pretty much disappeared by the time it got to me, but a thin ring on the glass gave evidence to perhaps a finger's worth at its zenith.  The aroma was rather thin at first, as the beer was a touch cooler than I preferred. As it warmed, there were notes of citrus and spice, perhaps coriander or clove, and a touch of understated malt, but as a whole, even when warmer, the aroma was a bit too sparse to be able to truly specify the components.  The first sip brought a peppery, dry citrus to the tongue, with notes of banana and mandarin orange, but without a great deal of sweetness. The spice essence was more clearly coriander in this incarnation. The malt asserted slightly in the middle, but again, it was more of a flavor component than a source of sweetness. A gentle yeasty sourness edged forward toward the end, and the finish gave another glimpse of the fresh peppery character.  A little more than light bodied, the carbonation set the palate glowing, which, combined with the flavor elements, gave this beer a genuine sense of existence in the mouth.  The color intrigues, and the flavor carries through on that initial impression. It's spicy and fresh, making it a thoroughly drinkable and enjoyable affair. The fun flavor and frivolous nature make this beer one that can be enjoyed during the warmer times, while the savory character make it a cooler weather quaff as well, quite a four seasons kind of concoction. And the overall lightness of being make it something you can pretty much indulge as much as you'd like. I will gladly have this one again, no matter what time of year, and I'll look forward to that time with a Mona Lisa smile on my face.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

83,248,SaunaKing,4.42,This is a great beer. I was surprised to see the wedge of lemon in it when I was served but what the hell - pretty small lemon wedge in a massive mug. The fist thing you notice is the cloudy appearenace of the beer and the thick dense white head. The head really lasts a long time and adds to the appearence of this beer. A very different smell. Corriander and Orange is what i notice most and definetly not what I expected from a beer. The smell really threw me off as what to expect from the taste. I was pleasantly surprised by how smooth and creamy it was. The taste was quite fruity and pleasant. I could drink these ma's indefinetly i think. Cheers,Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,claytri,4.63,The beer pours a wonderfully creamy light gold topped with a thin white lace. It smells of malt and citrus fruits. The taste is light and pleasing with dash of malt in the start and citric bite in the finish. It is slightly oily and carbonated. This is a wonderful beer to drink. It is not too heavy or too strong and has a taste that you will always find fits your mood.,Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,filabrazilia,3.97,This beer looks like a hazy lemonade with a near non-existant white head that leaves generous lace on the glass.  The smell is citrusy and grassy and invites you to drink this beer like a thirst quencher.  The taste is sweet and tart with a hint of lemon sweetness.  The mouthfeel is thin but very pleasing on the mouth. Carbomation tickles the tongue as I drink.

Grapefruit, banana, white pepper, coriander, cloves, and cinnamon are all jumping around on the palate. An earthy yeastiness reminds you that this is unfiltered. Finish is crisp and clean.

83,248,UnionMade,3.52,"The beer is a hazy lemonade color, that slightly yellowed, whitish opacity. Despite the absence of a lemon or any fruit garnish, no head forms at all. A bit of agitation generates a thin collar that dissipates slowly, leaving the beer naked again. The aroma is a soft wheat malt, slightly yeasty, with mild coriander and sweet orange peel. A bit lemony, even though there's no lemon in it. Fairly standard fare for a white ale. The flavor starts with what I can only guess to be pils malt. Slightly bready, with that distinct pils malt flavor, blended with wheat malt that contributes an airy sweetness. A bit or coriander spiciness comes through the middle, with a bit of peach and lemon fruitiness. The coriander continues into the finish, meeting sweet orange peel, blending into a mild, pleasant tanginess. A bit of sourish wheat malt adds some depth, finishing rather dry, with a powdery mouthfeel. Very little aftertaste, perhaps a faint coriander spiciness. Moderate, unassuming carbonation. Lightish body. I guess this would be the standard for belgian witbier, and it honors that distinction by being a well made wit, not deviating from the style definition at all. Extremely easy drinking, without any bitterness that might turn away your average macro drinker. I'd recommend this to anyone looking to explore the world of beer. It makes a fine transitional brew that's different enough from typical adjunct lager, but not too challenging on the palate.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Actually, after the first surprise of the aroma, it is actually quite wonderful.  Flavor- The aroma follows through with a very nice, light mouthfeel, but with a series of grassy/herbal flavors.

I had spent most of the night drinking Miller Lite and Yuengling Lager until a friend bought me a $5 glass of Hoegaarden. Nice glass. I got one off of ebay later on.  I first wondered why beer was cloudy. Next, I wondered why there was a slice of orange floating in it. How dare someone drop fruit in my beer. Keep that for the edge of your mixed-drink hurricane glasses. The initial taste was one of mostly citrus, and I haven't really tasted much else since then. I know there are other flavors but not as prevalent. A friend of mine drinks this instead of lemonade.  I remember the night being humid, so the taste was refreshing and light. I enjoyed the spicy scent as well. It's perfect for a hot, sunny day by the pool or for a sticky night in the city.  We all know what Wit brews are like, and Hoe is one of my favorites. One negative is that it can be watery from time to time, especially in the bottle.  Incidentally, I've tasted a concoction that mixes Hoegaarden with Lindemans Framboise. The name: A Dirty Ho. Not for me. A little too sweet.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Flavor starts a bit sweeter and more peppery than most wheat beers I've sampled; almost along the lines of a light belgian ale.

83,248,JamesBerry,2.93,"Even taking into account the natural pallor of white beers, Hoegaarden's appearance was disappointing. It was nearly impossible to pick up on any subtlety or nuance in its light-straw color through the thick wheat haze. This beer had a hoppy, clean smell with just a hint of hops and citrus. Bubbly and crisp, its mouthfeel overpowered the almost candy-like textures of the beer. Oddly, though, the aftertaste is much maltier than expected, with a fading bitterness.

83,248,bark,3.63,"This is a pretty different beer  When you get the over-sized tumbler glass (especially designed for Hoegaarden) it looks like you just got a glass of over carbonated, fresh squeezed apple juice: A cloudy white-yellow liquid with white, half-thick, long-lasting foam.  Then you smell the beer and discover a mix of sweet lemonade, apples, ladies perfume, paperhangers paste and soft soap.  The taste is enormously fresh and the carbon dioxide sparkles in your mouth like it is going to explode, but then it just fades away leaving lots of tastes to explore: Sour apples, bitter almonds, hints of leather and white bread.  The aftertaste is as complex and unexpected as the smell and taste: A taste of caraway and other spices used in dark bread is followed by a fresh and refreshing flavour of sour fruit-drops and almonds.  Not like any other beer that I have came across, not even other white beer comes close. A break when you dont want to have just another beer, and my first choice when I want to be refreshed a hot summer night.

83,248,mwrseeley,4.35,"Brouwerij van Hoegaarden should be recognised for the role it has played in introducing many beer drinkers to a world far removed from the familiar confines inhabited by Miller, Molson or Fosters. Hoegaarden Original White Beer is not the pinnacle of greatness, of course, but it does stand as a doorway, or as an introduction, to more adventurous brews.  The unfiltered orangey paleness of the beer is quite attractive; an initially large head soon gives way to a persistant ring and there isn't a lot of lacing. Some people might find the appearance a little off-putting, say, like greasy dishwater, but I rather liked it.  Hoegaarden's aroma is a kind of peppery yeast mingled with citrus fruitiness. I would have preferred the aroma to be just a bit stronger.  The yeastiness comes through with the first taste. Cloves and bananas. If you enjoy Hefe-Wiessenbier you will know what I am talking about. The aftertaste is gentle and slighty dry. Very nice.  Hoegaarden is very soft and smooth on the palate; it couldn't get much better. The brewers got the carbonation level just right. Good job.  What a refreshing beer!

83,248,BierManVA,4.35,I aquired quite a taste for this recently while traveling though London and Paris this last year. The quality remains the same either from the tap or cans or bottles.  A very refeshing light taste that reminds me a little of carbonated grapefruit juice. The appearance is quite similar to that as well. Fully effervescent and light. Quite fruity in both aroma and taste.  An excellent morning beverage or after a hot days activity.  John,Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,koolk,4.12,"Pale hazy yellow that looks like cloudy lemon juice.  Superb nose that is spicier that the bottled version. Cloves, cinnamon, wheat, peel and yeast all are present in large amounts. Very nice.  Good dry and tart palate that is long and creamy. Same flavours of peel, wheat and spice are apparent, again in large amounts.  Kegged version seems to have a bit more to it both on the palate and the nose. Good to see this popping up around town at non-belgium bars.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,Charthepirate,3.1,"Pours a hazy white. One of the first white beers I have ever tried so it's appearence seems unnatural to me. Lots of head, very creamy leaving a nice lace.  Smell is sweet and wheaty. Touches of lemon.  Taste balances far too heavy towards the malts for me. All I taste is sweetness and a touch of wheat. Leaves my mouth feeling coated with yeast and sugar. Ick.  Mouthfeel is poor, too sticky sweet for my tastes.  Wheat beers aren't my favorite, but there are far better than this.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,Globetrotter,2.62,"Comes in a distinctive 33cl brown bottle with a bulge in the neck. The label is pretty plain - dare I say ""low budget""? ""Orange flavoring"" and coriander are listed as ingredients. Best before 11/12/04, maybe I opened it a year too soon, on 11/7/03.  The appearance is gorgeous - cloudy yellow with a small white head that lacks contour but retains extremely well and leaves some lace. The nose is outstanding - fruity, tangy, wheaty. The mouth is light and prickly, as it should be. Some much for the nice things I have to say. The taste was, well, the diplomatic term would be ""subdued"". I struggled to find anything, and came up with wheat and citrus. There are no hops, no malt, no redeeming qualities. The taste of this bottle was surprisingly bland, even tasteless. I was hugely disappointed in what turns out to be the Corona of witbiers. No thanks.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,ToneControl,3.97,"This is a good beer, especially given that it's mass produced. I assume it was better before it became a commodity, but I'll never know for sure now.  It's hazy, and there's no mistaking its wheaty characteristics. In trendy UK bars, it's a good choice from the tap or bottle. However, at home, it's not the best, it's just ""good"". I think this beer is better with food than alone. Certainly a good summer thirst quencher.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,francisweizen,3.8,"A very nice brew. In a can in Brussels!:-) The appearance and aroma are each docked a notch, as this canned version lacks in those two departments. This beer smells wonderfully like lemons, spices, and wheat and the taste is more of the same, unfortunately the aromas and flavors are subdued in the canned version of this brew. However, this stuff is still immensely refreshing on the pallet, and a good summer-time quaffer if ever there was one. This has a creamy mouth feel as well and a very high drinkability(especially in those warm summer months....or on a cold winters day, perhaps....)A classic white ale, and one hell of a brew. I just wish that I could have tried this a long time ago before Interbrew changed it. I have heard that it was once even better than this. cheers!, F",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,PZuke,4.12,"A nice hazy straw color. Kind of looks like the frozen lemonade with the little bit of hazy going on. The glass filled with about an inch head and the aroma of wheat and citrus. The first taste is of citrus, clove and coriander. It is very nice going down with a little hint of spice that is not overpowering. This beer is very drinkable. Would be perfect for a summer day or like me year round. An all around good beer that I would never pass up if offered",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Very wheaty, and you can physically feel particles of wheat in the beer which remain in the aftertaste.  Note: This is my second Hoegaarden. The first one made me sick, so I wanted to stick it out and try another to insure it wasn't just a bad batch or something. But this one still just tastes nasty to me. The wheat taste just is nauseating to me. I know the reviews are supposed to be relative to it's style, but I haven't had many other white beers to compare this too, and the ones that i have had were not so sickening to me. Perhaps I'm allergic to the style or something, but I just can't recommend this.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

On tap, it is a classic Belgian white. In the bottle, there are American whites that I find superior. It had less color than I expected with little head or aroma.  It tasted good, and it has a nice feel to it. It is a good beer but not as special as the price.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,Andreji,3.56,"Oooh well this is a beer that doesnt really do much for anything really....  Pours an extremely pale golden cloudy tone that almost blends with its perfect white foam head.  The smell, weak and short lasting is rather wheaty but has no special notes to it and doesnt really embrace when tasting.  The taste makes things no different either. The weakness ruins it because it appears as though the pale tone of the beer is caused by someone adding too much water to it and making it less tasteful. But, oh, well, a decent beer anyways.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,byrd,3.63,"Pours a very pale cloudy yellow color - the description white is very appropriate. A snow white head of small bubbles sits lightly on top of the brew until receding to a thin lace. The aroma is citric with noticeable orange and lemon notes. The mouthfeel is fairly smooth with a zesty bite towards the end. Orange and lemon notes from the aroma, along with yeast notes, are quite noticeable on the palate, with the orange tending to come though a bit more in the finish. A touch of spice is also evident, although I cant pick it up quite as much as I would have expected to. This is definitely a refreshing beer with a fairly light, crisp mouthfeel. Im drinking it in October, but it seems that it would make a great summer brew.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

This beer is exceptionally drinkable and should be in your regular rotation of summer beers.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,chilidog,4.07,"Picked up in England by a friend. The benchmark ""IMO"" for the wit beer style. Im not a big fan of yeasty brews but enjoyed thisone much. I poured the bottle into a rather large, oversize Hoegaarden glass, he also brought. It poured a cloudy straw pale color with a carbonated white head. Lace was not a factor. The aroma was of citrus lemon. The taste was fruity with a lite drying hop finish. Clearly the zest of lemon and coriander stand out most. The mouth feels the soft carbonation or foam like texture, left alittle dry. This was more than I expected for a wit, while also living up to what I expected a Hoegaarden to be! Good stuff!",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,moulefrite,4,"A classic no matter how you slice it. Perhaps the most widely known of the style here in the states and the best selling (ya want to not like it!) as well. But, the bottom line is this is a very nice beer! I love the pale pastel lemon/yellow color and the textbook snow white head. The aromatics are focused and distinctly fresh orange zest and coriander in a very nicely balanced package. The mouthfeel is at once refreshing and cleansing-light to medium bodied. Flavors are very much orange, especially orange zest, and malted wheat. Spice notes trail on the finish and add dimension. This is an amazingly drinkable wit that I will continue to enjoy and look forward to drinking.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,PiratePete,4.12,"Pours out a cloudy off-yellow with a very serious head (and I mean big) - well, its a wit. Suddenly no head and hardly any lace at all. Smells of yeast, malt, my wife's bread and some fruit. And like everybody says it is nice and spicey with a serious sense of a mouthful. Don't gulp. Drink and savour and enjoy.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

It's good. It was better before Interbrew, though (at the risk of sounding trite). I just think there are some other far superior wits out there. Two that readily come to mind are Blanche de Chambly and Wittekerke.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Like the bottled version, it was light and bubbly, with mellow tones of wheat, citrus, and coriander. Again, not much to add, except that the draught version is slightly superior all-around to the bottled (though neither in the U.S. can touch the draughts in Belgium).

It was a light yellow color, as the name might indicate, and was very cloudy. It was served with a lemon wedge, something that annoys me. It tasted like a hefeweizen with a hint of fruit flavor.

Yes, its a light ale in some ways but it has a powerful taste thats not so easy to explain. I've tried tasting bananas and clove but it works best for me just laying an orange slice or two on the bottom of a frosty glass and pouring this cloudy brew slowly and its best for this beer to be really cold, the citrus combination lets the flavor grow as the beer slightly warms over several mins.

Aroma was slight and of cider. Taste was also disappointingly mellow. Slight malt, dominating cider taste, though dominating is an awfully strong word to describe the taste with, as it was not an impression maker. Similar sweet, sugary and malty flavor with a candy feeling left on the tongue. Easy to drink and a nice after working beer.

My impressions were two fold as I will explain. The first beer was great. Nice hops, almost a wheat like taste. It went down great. I wanted more. Now the rub. It seemed to ""weaken"" as I drank on, almost begging for a lemon wedge. No, I thought, don't give in to the evil citris wedge.

Taste  Nice, light, yeasty taste with some spices that I cant identify. You wont need to plop a lemon in this one  its already there.  Mouthfeel  Very typical of the style.

You can't expect every 20 something bartender to know the customs of serving a belgian beer. anyway) Ho pours the most unique looking pint of beer I've ever seen (sadly, the bar I frequent does not carry the right glass for it, so I take it in a pint glass). It has a lemon yellow body with a very hazy efferfescent look. Atop sits a tall fluffy head of white lace. Smells of citrus immeadiately predominate. The first taste is delicately sweet with a very refreshing mouthfeel. The aftertaste allows you to notice the spices used in flavoring the brew, most notably corriander and some clove. Orange, banana, and the taste of yeast all combine to make a very interesting taste, but one that is not strong at all.

On tap the taste and aroma seem much stronger. There is a much clearer lemon-citrus taste, unless it was tainted by the lemon wedge. All in all much better on tap.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,Loki,4,"Pours a cloudy, pale yellow with a small white head that fades fairly quickly. Aromas of coriander, orange, citrus, and faint pepper. The nose follows through to the tastes of orange, coriander, wheat with a light sweetness that pairs with the slight peppery spice. Finishes slightly dry with a mild bitterness. Great Hefeweizen. My fiancee's favorite and everyday beer. Even better on draft.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,feloniousmonk,4.57,"I've been enjoying witbiers since I've been aware of their existence, and yet this is my first time sampling ""the original"".Color: a cloudy, almost opaque pale yellow/bright white. Head: thick, lacey, white, fluffy as a cloud, slowly tumbling down. Aroma: uplifting, light and lovely! Full of citrus, spice, lemon/orange...wide open, spacious, airy, friendly and hospitable. All that in an aroma? Yes, Indeed! A great big barrage of hops charges the palate at first, along with the gritty, grainy wheat texture. After that attack, very smooth and mellow. Light in body,and feeling, but rich in flavor, character, and soul. An utter delight every time it touches the tongue! An overall honey flavor dominates the remainder of the drink, and the delicious hops, the texture, the spice, continue to dance on the palate and provide for a richly rewarding refreshment. When other folks talk of ""nothing beating a Bud Light/Corona/generic yellowy water"" on a hot summer's day, they would be wiser to wrap their lips around a glass of Hoegaarden. Wiser, happier, more improved in all aspects as a human being! What a beautiful beer!",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,86MonteSS,3.97,"I never really understood wheat beer till I tried this one. Hoegaarden does it so subtly and so well. Light, cloudy, and yellow in color with a tall pure white head. The grainy tastes begs for you to add the fruit but it's better without it. A solid beer, and the first bottled wheat I'd buy again (yeah, I realize I ought to try a few more).",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,BierReise,2.86,"First off, I have to say that I'm rating a bottle and not a draught Hoegaarden. They're almost like two different animals. The draught is far superior and I don't understand why. At any rate, the beer pours nicely and looks beautiful in the glass. The problem is that it doesn't live up to it's reputation in my opinion. The flavors that come out in the draught are hardly present. It tastes to me like a pale wheat beer. The draught is far superior for sure.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,Mitchster,3.91,"Bought and drank this one in Cannes, France. Cloudy, white, straw-golden brew forms a large whipped white head atop small bubbles with excellent retention and lacing. Carbonation is moderate, despite the huge head. Aroma is immediately yeasty with clove and very faint banana notes. I don't notice the orange peel or spices. Mouthfeel is soft with a light body. Taste begins with spicy phenols, a light rubbery note, crisp wheat malt with very little bitterness and no discernable hop flavor or aroma. Orange is just barely perceptable in the flavor. Alcohol is not discernable. Finish is lightly astringent just on the back of the tongue. A good, delicate, light, easy to drink beer, but not overly distinct or exciting.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,mickeymac,3.72,It looks a bit like a cloudy glass of yellow lemonade. The smell is on the light side but slightly peppery.

It just looks the way it's supposed to!The cloudy pale, off white, tinted yellow color reveals a light body. Clove and hop aroma with a trace of alcohol. High in complex bitter hops with citrus undertones. Extra Dry. Fine Carbonation with a fizzy head and fine lace. Very sharp and spicy.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

83,248,dmarch,4.12,"I always wonder about having Belgian Wits on tap. I thought it was important to swirl the rest of the yeast and pour it in the bottle. Still, it was rather good. Pale cloudy yellow in color with a dense creamy white head. Strong lemony aroma, which is probably mostly due to the lemon they served it with. I would have turned down the lemon, but it seemed to compliment the beer well. Taste is citrusy and coriander. The perfect beer after cutting the grass on a hot summer day,",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,EmoBeerGuy,4.58,"Drank a ton of this on tap during my semester spent in London. This was my introduction to White Beer, but really it was my introduction to real beer, that is non-Lager. Loved this from the first time I tried it and though it was considered a ""girly"" beer by some of my American friends (yeah, but that Carlsberg isn't?) I loved it and it opened the door for so many other Belgiums.  This one was a bottle though. Pours with slight head. Apperance is white on top to a honey gold on the bottom. Don't forget to swill!  Taste: Classic White Beer flavor. I still like this one better than Allagash altough I may be alone on this one. One tap it, overseas especially, its even better, but this one is all citrus, clove, and coreander. Nice zing. Don't let them give you any lemon though, this has all the citrus I need Brewed Into the Beer. Great on a summer day, or, as a treat tonight, to ring in spring!",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,tavernjef,4.23,"On tap baby, oh yeah..... poured out into the glass very hazy yellow, lots of mixing of whites and yellows, like watching watery latex paint mix. A huge creamy, thick, foamy head grew over and beyond and was quite a thrill to see. Smells right away of the orange and lemon, extremely citrusy. Nothing out of the ordinary for this Belgian beauty, but good non the less. Tastes of a citrus brew, very citrusy with orange and lemon strongly presented and felt, with a hint of spice, coriander I believe. Quite the drinker this was, I drank it to fast and gave me a buzz.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,marburg,4.25,"Hoegaarden was the first wit I ever had, and it definitely turned me on to the style. I've had a couple (Celis, Blance de Namur) that I like better for sure, but this is still just a great beer. It's certainly not as complex as something like Hitachino's white, but it simply fills the niche of a refreshing, spritzy, tasty beer. No ifs, ands, or buts about it.  Pours dish water yellow -- hazed and alive-looking -- with a rocky, poofy, yet creamy-looking head. Aroma of orange peel can hit you from its resting position on the table let alone as you drink it. All the usual suspects are there in the taste: lemon, coriander, orange, etc. Total citrus brew.  And it's easy to drink. It's very light and simple, nothing too brain-bending about this one. I've made this a summertime session beer before, and I'll probably do it again.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

83,248,tang214,4.24,This is an excellent wheat brew. It pours bright cloudy yellow with very little head. Served with a lemon. The beer in itself was quite citrussy. It had a fruity flavor that did not overpower the wheat malts. Cirtrussy in the mouth but very drinkable. Very good.,Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,UncleJimbo,3.88,"Sampled on tap at Redbones.  This wheat ale poured a very cloudy yellow color with modest white foam. The smell was lightly fruity (bananas). The taste was fruity (bananas), with the flavors of wheat, pears, apples, musty grapes, and some citrus-like tartness. The mouthfeel was smooth and clean with low carbonation and light to medium body. The drinkability was good. This was a light and refreshing ale, probably better suited to warmer weather.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,philipt,3.7,"This beer is bursting with different qualities.  First of all, this beer is a very pale yellow, hence ""white ale"" right? It has a perfectly white head that has good initial size and has staying power. I smells highly citrusy, almost like a fruit juice. Taste is spicy, citrusy, and sweet at the same time. Grapefruit (sweet grapefruit) and banana stick out. Slightly metallic characteristics too.  Not my favorite style, but good nonetheless.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,Rocko,4,"This wheatbeer pours hazy light yellow, it looks almost like lemonjuice. The frothy head grows quickly but settles quick too leaving only a thin lace.

Pours a cloudy, pale yellow with small yeast particles dancing around in the heavy carbonation. A thick, fluffy white head presents itself upon pouring and slowly dies down leaving a beautiful lace on the glass. Aromas of lemon and coriander are very prominent. The flavors of yeast, citrus and spicy coriander engulf the taste buds all at once. Leaving you mouth begging for more. A clean and refreshing taste is left on the palate.

Taste is zesty, with a tart start, yielding to a somewhat spicy (corriander?) mid-palate, a finish of moderate floral hops, and a gently sweet aftertaste. Finish is slightly dry, body is medium-light, and the flavors are very well balanced and blend into each other oh-so-smoothly. Very refreshing and drinkable.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

But I tell you, without the (required for style) cloudiness, this beer would look quite funny -- pale, pale, pale. Nice head atop and I was careful not to let any lemon touch the inside (if I use lemon at all, it is in the summer, and only after I have tasted many offerings). Taste was super, as was its mouthfeel and drinkability. Nice subtly spicy, sweet flavor. Decided to sample this one even though the bar was a chilly temp. Will be saving this stuff for the summer.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Taste: Sweet, citrusy, yeasty, slighty spicy, but all of the flavors are light. Not overly complex and very clean.  Mouthfeel: Nice carbonation, almost soda like.  Drinkability: This is the best part about this beer. Perfectly refreshing. When I order these, they do not last long. No huge ABV either.  Simple tasting and delicious. Well balanced flavors. Always hits the spot. Whenever I'm out I always manage to order one of these if available.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,BeerAngel,4.2,Pours with the look of a sparkling champagne except with a white fizzy head that stays a just a tad longer. The color is a very pale hazed yellow-stained water. Light aromas of a light sweet fruit and a hint of yeast bellow out of the soda-like head. The light yet sophisticated flavors of light yeast and fruit and a slight note of a lemon twang make up a nice refreshing beer. The mouthfeel is light to medium and finishes nonchalantly sticky.

83,248,WVbeergeek,4,"Came in the new bottles that have just been released by Hoegaarden. A staple for any true belgium beer drinkers, it pours a classic pale hazy unfiltered yellow with a superb white head carrying all of the yeasty goodness this beer has to offer. The aroma is clove and banana laced, with other spices and coriander what a treat. More refreshing than a lemonade, in my opinion. A lighter bodied beer that has citrusy tone to it and then mellows out to form a great yeasty finish. Full of so many flavors with out over doing it, this is an amazing beer that I will never grow tired of. Yes it is drinkable on every level for quantity and enjoyment.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85

Highly carbonated and virtually non-existent head that is visible only around the edges. Very interesting ""remnants"" escape the bottle right at the end of the pour, destined to be included in the wonderful taste.  Very lemony-fresh aroma. The beer offers a light and refreshing taste, something you could really enjoy during the summer. Mouthfeel is crisp and dry, almost champagne-like. Virtually no aftertaste whatsoever. I would love to try this on tap sometime.  An excellent Belgian white.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,OatmattStout,4.15,"Same review as in bottle with addition: the tap version seems to have a bit more fullness, depth and body in taste and mouthfeel. Seems that the flavores of malt element come through more and bottle though great seems thinner and more watery for lack of a better term. Plus it's poored from a great looking tap and they cut the big head off with a knife dip the ""Hoegaarden"" glass in water to clean overflow and serve.  Bottle review: This is a great wit beer one of my favorites. Head it good if poored firmly out of bottle and does disipate quickly. Good clean lemon smell. The color is pale yellow and cloudy. I always swirl the yeast into the glass cause it gives it more depth and flavor. Has a little dry citrus flavor and some floral sweetness. This beer is one you can have alot of and is my go to beer when I'm having many.

Aroma is very light consisting mainly of coriander and wheat. Has the typical flavors of a wit... cloves, coriander, yeast, and a touch of lemon. Has a light body and a prickly mouthfeel.

The taste is a very refreshing, slightly sweet and sour mild lemon flavor. Its very smooth in the mouth and goes down very easily.

83,248,brewdlyhooked13,4.4,"One of the collateral goals I'm trying to accomplish by sampling lots of different beers is to try and expand the horizons of my wife, who, as of a few years ago, was woefully hooked on American lagers. Not a slam on Bud or Miller, but with the Hoegaarden she had a breakthrough. Maybe it's because this beer is unfiltered and closer to 'raw' beer, I thought she'd wince or make a face and proclaim how awful it tasted. Happily, I was surprised when her face lit up at the first taste.  This really is an ideal Belgian to start out with, if you're new to this area. A creamy, smooth head, an unintimidating and inviting aroma. A wonderful slightly lemony sourish flavor, but not anywhere near pucker-invoking. There's just enough sweetness to balance it out. How do they *do* that?!?!  This beer feels so good in the mouth, so smooth, you could salt away 4 or 5 with little effort. We rarely have a tasting where we will drink 2 of the same thing, but I swear if I'd had a 2nd bottle of this, we would have done just that. She made a statement about Genessee Cream Ale, but it's been ages since I had that beer. Genessee may compare in mouthfeel and overall zero likelihood of having any offensive components, but I don't think it could reach Hoegaarden's taste at all. As Marty Brennaman says when a baseball player swings at a pitch waaaay out of the strike zone, 'He couldn't havef hit that with an ironing board'. That's Genessee's chance of out-flavoring this ale.

Hay in the distance. Starts off on the lemon note. Swings from sour to sweet. Always mild. Never tart or overly sweet. Hay is observed again. Grassy hues towards the middle into the finish. Ends pretty dry. Pleasant all around, but little backbone to speak of. More of an exoskeleton. Light bodied, actually fairly thin. Quenching and crisp. Drinks without any effort at all.

The aroma is quite lemony and orange-like with some gentle spice in the background. The body is light-medium with a zesty carbonation that bristles but then warms to give an airy, pillowy soft mouthfeel. The flavor is sweetly malty and gently fruity, woody, and spicy. It's very well balanced. It finishes gently, and semi-dry with a lightly mouth-coating malt and spice that leaves a tingle on the tongue.

Huge orangey fruity aroma with some decent peppery spiciness in there as well. Smooth yeast flavors as well as some fruitiness that floats in the background. The spiciness is very vague and subtle and I wouldn't mind it being a little stronger. Slightly thin but still very creamy this is still a very drinkable brew.

83,248,jreitman,3.8,"Hazy pale gold with a pleasing aroma. Sweet flavors start off and finish with a slightly sour bitterness. Classic belgian yeast taste. A good beer, but not my favorite Wit.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,goindownsouth,3.53,"Not bad. This is probably the one I would suggest for someone looking to get started in sampling Belgian biers. It is a murky brew with a lacey head. The aroma gives off a bit of citrus and spice, but not nearly as much as most other Belgians. The drinkability is a high factor here. Without the superior Belgian alcohol kick, one could have more of this bier and get away with it. It took me more than one of these to get a good feel for it. I concur with a previous reviewer, ""A good summer bier.""",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,jackndan,4.43,"Hoegaarden: in the bottle (bottle conditioned). Pure white head, with a cloudy pale yellow body. The head dissipated very quickly, but the beer itself was highly carbonated. Very light and refreshing, with a classic Belgian/yeast taste, but with hints of lemon grass. I&#8217;ve had this on tap, and it was terrific; it was good in a bottle, but on tap it was great.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,Wildman,4.14,"This beer poured a light straw color and was slightly cloudy with some carbonation. It formed a white head which subsided and left very little lace. It had a nice citrus aroma to it. The taste had citrus and some hops, and the carbonation created a slightly tangy finish. A good summer beer.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,frank4sail,4.1,Very pale with a slight yellow haze and tint. The brew is soft in the mouth with melow flavors of citrus and slight fruit. The smooth coating finish leaves you with a fluffy feel. And the finish has a slight spicyness in the throat. A excellent session beer and awesome with food. I could drink them all night. Very drinkable...,Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,proc,4.38,"What an enjoyable beer. Pours out to a very pale, hazy gold in the glass with a cloudlike, puffy, foamy head. Taste is that of wheat, yeast, citrus and very light clove. What a tasty beer!!!",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,IrishRedRock,4.2,"Yeah this stuff is excellent. On tap in the big Hoegaarden glass...oh yeah. Cloudy yellow, almost white, head sticks to glass all the way down. Delicious spicy yeast flavor. Mmm.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,marc77,4.15,"Cloudy straw hue and topped by a thick, ivory white sticky head. Soft coriander and light citrus in aroma w/ a touch of phenol and yeasty mustiness. Slightly tart upfront, but a mellow and pleasant sweetness follows. Citrus and coriander spice flavors are understated and well integrated in the flavor profile. Soft all around on the palette w/ a very smooth mouthfeel. Finishes clean and sweet with mellow coriander flavor lingering on the tongue. Has Hoegaarden White been changed ever since Interbrew took over? Maybe, but this is still a fine and well balanced wit.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,ebraun,4.92,"After the rat bastards at Miller sank Celis, I tried to seek out a replacement for their Wit. Well, it took me far too long to get around to it, but I finally bucked up and grabbed a bottle of Hoegaarden (Pierre Celis is the former brewer). Golden in color, sticky glorious head, the aroma immediately tells you that this is something special. The coriander and orange peel hit you followed by the mellow sweetness of the wheat. Its mouthfeel is smooth and velvety with a little zip on the end. The blending of the spices with the highest quality wheat make for an over-the-top experience. To me, this is really the benchmark for other Belgian whites. It's probably to rich to have too many at one sitting, so probably not the greatest session beer ever.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,Reverand,4.15,"Excellent white beer. Cloudy appearance with nice head, citrus aftertaste. Light and refreshing definitely a beer to keep stock in your refrigerator.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,kunzbrew,4.42,Hoegaarden is one of the best Wits i have ever tasted. It is so smooth tasting with out a bitter after taste. I found no matter how many you drink you will never get a hangover. We all should plan a trip to this brewery to find the secret of Wit. Happy drinking,Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,ADR,4.17,"Deeply clouded, ""frosted banana"" color. Small-bubbled head that's pretty persistent. Lots of estery banana and nutmeg aroma. Good balance between satisfying sweet malt that tends toward creamy and a touch of pepper and a slight hop cut. The label says ""a balance of sweet and sour"" but I noticed a thankfully minimal amount of lemony sourness (this issue always crops up with me and Belgian styles). Light, refreshing and setting a standard for the style. Wits are always a little lacking and thin to me but this is a great example.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,Anonmatel,4.42,"Very Refreshing, citrus taste is very prominent, but not overbearing, Champagne like, it's more of a beer to have with a meal than a session beer. And at $8.50 a bottle for it down here thats probably good it is not a session beer. Probably the best Wheat beer i've had to date.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,packetknife,4.2,"After being introduced to 'Wit bier' with Blue Moon I was shocked to find a beer _that_ much better. The only complaint is, for a reason I can't quite touch, I can't have more than two/three bottles of Hoegaarden before I get bored with it.  Spicy with hints of Citrus. The foggy appearence is classic.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,WilliamPhilaPa,4,"A bottle of this with my lunch (at Nodding Head Brew Pub) was pretty much my introduction to the Belgian White. This brew pours a cloudy pale gold, with an average sized white fluffy head that doesnt stay around long before it becomes a thin strip of bubbles floating on top of the brew. Thin to medium body. The heavy earthy nose is mostly of malt and suggests cereal and caramel, with hints of flowers, and citrus. The flavor though not overwhelming is very balanced with moderate levels of sweetness and acidity with a hint of bitterness. The finish is quick and clean. Overall a very refreshing and interesting brew that I enjoyed very much! Good stuff but I don't think a could drink more then two in a row though...",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,aracauna,3.64,"Despite an interesting color and ok head, I was initially disapointed with the taste. For the past couple of months, most of my beer have been stouts, porters, brown ales and darker Belgians. Compare to those heavy bodied beers, this came across as kid of tasteless. It took me a good quarter of the pint to get to the point where I could appreciate the subtleties. Not as much coriander and orange in this as some of the others I've had and the body was still a little light for me, but not bad. Definite warm weather beer.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,Bighuge,4.28,"Nice frothy white head. Cloudy white appearance as the name suggests. I get wheat on the nose, but surprisingly, no spice. Nice easy drinking wheat based bevarage. This would be a great summertime beer. I was hoping for a little more orange/coriander/spice in the taste, but it tastes very good as is. There's that nice zesty, tangy character that goes great with pools and sunshine.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,Thrasher,3.38,"This is a luscious refreshing white, good for a sunny Sunday brunch. Nothing extraordinary but decent, indicative of the style. Doesn't get superb marks from me because I inherently distrust Interbrew. Their beers suffer from the enormity of the company, and their costs are prohibitive. I once paid $9 ($10 with tip) for one of these in an annoying Manhattan bar/lounge, so I decided to keep the glass.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,rastaman,4.08,"very good white beer, i'm sure it had more complexity once upon a time, but it continues to be very good, it has never let me down.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,mattmaples,4.4,Great citrisy flavor form the hops and orange peel. Nice head and wonderful wheaty flavor. I only put 2 other whites ahead of this one but Hoegaarden definately has the best value.,Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,Jason,3.6,"Presentation: 12oz slim Euro-style brown bottle.  Appearance: Pale yellow, cloudy (this is a non filtered brew), with a bitty cream pure white head.  Smell: Peppery, hints of lemon zest, with a mild horse aroma.  Taste: The brew is sweet, mildly dextrinous, with a smooth semi-chewy mouthfeel. The yeast creates a pepper flavour that complements the light hop (lemony), sour flavour -- unique to this style. The aftertaste dries, from the unmalted wheat, and a slight bitterness escapes at the very end.  Notes: The original White Ale, and grandfather to many a Summer-style white ale. Seems to have less character lately, though if you have it over in Belgium it is better.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,John,4.66,Anyone who's had only American interpretations of Belgian Wit(white) beer before needs to try this. A real treat with a unique texture. Very flavorful.,Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,AaronRed,3.7,OK. Went well with Chinese food,Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
83,248,Brent,4.4,"There are a couple I like a little better, but this is certainly a classic example of the style. Very smooth and tasty.",Brouwerij van Hoegaarden,Belgium,Witbier,85
