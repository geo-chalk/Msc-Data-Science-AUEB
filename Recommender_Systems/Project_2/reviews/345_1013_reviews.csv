345,1013,MadMadMike,4.05,"12 oz botle into a snifter. Pours Midnight black, tan foam, good lacing. Smell is deep dark cacao, dark toast malt, Cuban coffee, almost burnt malt. Taste goes dark chocolate, rich espresso, a fine bold hop zing on the side of the tongue that’s unexpected. Feel is medium carb, medium body, medium slick. Not syrupy at all. Overall, this is a good little Stout with no barrel required.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

345,1013,DrOfGolf,4.44,"Poured this into a glass. Poured out a ritch and dark black with a hop, malt, and slight chocolatey smell. The taste was different to me, since this is my introduction to this type of beer and it wasn't quite what I was expecting. The ABV (9.1%) is apparent and the added hop flavor is just right. I like it and will be having it again, for sure.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,SABERG,4.16,"Poured from a botle dated BB 10/22/22 into the test glass A - Solid black color, excellent tan, tight knit froth, lacing with each draw. S - Bakers chocoalte, char, a bit of espresso, pine. T - Again with the bakers chocolate, add a hint of orange rime, and piney, coffee with flourless chocoalate cake. M - Medium in body, start is semi sweet then rolls toward and stays on the bitter side. Finish is ashen dry. O - A new favorite for me, assertive, edgy, and with all the pieces of an American RIS. Thankful to have this in our area.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

345,1013,Brutaltruth,4.02,"From the 12 oz bottle in a snifter. This classic pours a dark blackish brown with a fantastic head of khaki foam that settles to a thick fat layer with excellent lacing. Nose of dark cocoa, pine touched hops, dark coffee, and moderate char. Flavors follow the nose nicely with dark bakers cocoa, char, coffee, and floral as well as pine touched hops on the rear. Nice mouth feel; medium full body, smooth, lightly creamy, and finishing with a char and bitter malt note balanced by strong hops.  Overall, a solid brew, a touch more hops than I remember, but solid all the same!  Cheers",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,moodenba,3.94,"Victory Storm King is a well balanced stout, with elements of malt, roasted malt, and hoppy bitterness. The 9.1% alcohol content is well hidden. The flavor is more assertive than a Guinness Stout Nitro. I recently tasted a Carlow O'Hara Stout that was more aggressively flavored than Storm King, even having half the alcohol content. All things being equal, I'd prefer to drink two of the O'Haras than just one Storm King.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

345,1013,irs,4.37,"Label says best by Oct 22, 2022. Interesting since an imperial stout can get better with age. reviews i've read lead me to expect something different in the nose, but the sweet, dark candy smell, betrays nothing about this being any different from any other Impy stout. The opaque blackness topped with a thin, offwhite foam also seem normal. The only deviation is the additional bitterness of the hops, which only appear to me in the taste, rather than in the smell. Its noticably drier than I'd expect, and the alcohol is well hidden. Hops dominate later in the taste. Its a nice change, but, to me, a minor flourish rather than a major deviation from the style. The mouthfeel is light, but chewy. Overall, very nice, and at a comfortable price point for an imperial stout.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Dustin015,4.29,"L- jet black tan head with moderate lacing  S- herbal hops up front with a sweet roasted malt and vanilla back drop  T- strong citrus and herbal hoppy flavors with some chocolate and char.

I would almost consider this a black IPA though",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,jonphisher,4.13,"Pours black with a nice light brown head. Not much retention but a nice thin layer of creamy light brown persists.  Citrus hops, dark chocolate, dark fruit, and dark roast black coffee.  Very much similar to the nose, the hops really show a grapefruit citrus without any of the sweet. The coffee also really shows on the finish.  Full body, moderate to low carbonation, a hint of alcohol, nice big bitterness.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,harrypowers,4.1,Pours a near black color with a small short-lived tan head and light lacing.  Smells and tastes of toasted malt and coffee. Sips are lightly bitter from start to finish.  Medium body with light carbonation. Clean dry mouthfeel.  This is a good imperial stout that probably would mellow well with some age.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Wattie83,4.42,"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Looks dark brown to black with a khaki head that falls off to a thin cap. Smell is a nice mix of dark malt, roasted coffee, cocoa and a bit of bright floral hops. Taste starts with roast malt, a bit of fruit (raspberry), hops. In the middle I get some bitterness from the hops, more fruit, and a cocoa powder flavor. Finish is hoppy, cocoa powder, and coffee. Very balanced between sweet and bitter. Mouth feel is medium-full, rather soft and creamy even with a tight carbonation present. The alcohol is hidden pretty well. Overall, I'm glad they brought this back. For some reason I always passed this one up years ago. This is a great stout and a nice change of pace from the barrel aged and super sweet stouts that dominate.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,John1985,4.29,"Very dark almost opaque, beautiful one inch that dissipated into a foam cap with lacing. Aroma of dark malts with hops.

This is definitely to savor and enjoy.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

345,1013,hman43,4.2,"Look: It pours black with a brown head. Head retention is excellent.  Smell: It has strong roasted aroma with citrus. There are some low expresso notes in the background.  Taste: It has strong roast and coffee flavors with citrus notes integrated in the malts. There is very low pine and a hint of floral.  Feel: It has a full body and slight alcohol warming.  Overall, although this is more like a black IPA to me, it has great flavors and finish.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

345,1013,Rug,4.12,"Best by 10/14/22  So this is one of those classic beers that everyone in the forums talks about quite often. All that talking must've done some good, because Victory decided to bring this one back for this year. My last beer to close out a wonderful Chirstmas I just had. Let's crack it open  Pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing  Upon first whiff of this, there's no question that this an old school Imperial Stout, just loaded with bitter roasty aromas. I'm picking up on aromas of charred toast, dark chocolate, roasted malt, acidic coffee, earthy hops, and light toffee  Oof, it's possibly even more roasty in taste. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting dark chocolate, bitter coffee, earthy hops, toffee, and light grapefruit rind. The swallow brings notes of char, caramel malt, toast, dark chocolate, herbal hops, pithy grapefruit, and acidic coffee  A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a roasty and bitter beer. Finishes mostly dry with a huge roast character  This beer is definitely a product of the time when it was popular, and it's pretty damn good for that. Drinks easy for what it is",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,nizzle8287,4.24,"So this stout is very interesting to me, since it uses European malts and American hops. I read some reviews about this stout that were much older, stating that it tasted more like a black IPA than a stout, but I disagree with this assessment. It tastes like a European imperial stout to me, with cocoa, slight coffee, a bit of bread, and a little bit of a hop bite, but really can't tell that the hops create any outstanding bitterness. Certainly not a thin beer, but certainly not the thickets beer I've ever had, and quite dry on the aftertaste.. I really enjoy it, but it's not as good when warm as some other thicker stouts. Overall, great stout, but better when served up slightly on the cold side. If you want something to drink at room temp, this probably isn't it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

345,1013,PathofChaos,3.93,"Appearance: The type of brown called to mind by an untamed forest, thick with brawny tree trunks, swallowed up in the darkness of its own, impermeable canopy; nightfall immersing it in sightless black. Oh, it has a head too… Right. Got a little carried away there. It’s a lush, wonderful head of pale, sandy froth with long-lived retention and lace that starts as a sheet, then breaks into cobwebs.  Bouquet: Smoked oats, coated in a chocolate that’s never even heard the word “sugar,” let alone mixed with it. The backend yields dark malts and miniscule, earthy hops, pulverized into powdery dryness.  Feel: So plush and thick, it’s like chewing on a satin quilt—but in this case, pretend the quilt is edible and chewing on it is not the result of mental derangement. A weave on low carbonation provides a bit of fiber-like contrast to the texture… Hmm, I’m not really selling you here, am I? Look, its good okay. Full bodied and smokier than a volcanic plume. Drink it and instantly gain +100 Manly Points.  Taste: A billowing cloud of woodsmoke engulfs the palate, leaving the tongue to blindly trip over dark, earthy hops, bang its shins on blocks of raw cacao, and fall, gratefully, onto a pillow of soft oats at the end.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,DavetotheB,4.12,"From a 12oz bottle dated best by 10/7/22 into a pint glass.  Pours an opaque black with about two and a half fingers of tan head. Great retention, great lacing.  Smells mainly of roasted/smoky malts with a hint of coffee and baker's chocolate.  Taste is bitter dark chocolate with strong roasty/smoky notes. Touch of coffee in there too.  Mouthfeel is a bit thin for the style but still pretty full-bodied. This is a different kind of IS than the RISs I'm used to. Strong bitter aftertaste that lingers for a long time. Low to medium carbonation.  This is really a decent beer. A little different than what I'm used to but a great change of pace. Glad Victory brought this one back.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,GlenFarclas,4.92,"Perfection incarnate for me. This is exceptional - seriously. I think one of my favorite beers has to be Alchemist's Luscious. I don't get up to VT more than once (maybe twice) a year. I have a couple stowed away to enjoy this holiday season from a summer trip - I love that stuff but this is so reminiscent. Stylistically, profile, aesthetic. It's quite a surprise for me. What I'm trying to say is, this to me fills the luscious void in a sense. Price point is excellent as well. Man, what a beer. Big, bold, bitter, luscious stuff. I suspect there's something of cascade in here - that hop just becomes what you need it to. I dunno, this is wonderful stuff though.

345,1013,Knoght5191,2.55,"I’m not sure how this beer gets such a high rating. Ether I’m wrong and need to study beer more to understand it or everyone else is wrong. Or I can just simply have a different opinion which is probably the case. We will go with the last one I guess. I get nothing on the nose other than a slight burnt toast scent. The taste is of burnt soap or a semi cheep cup of coffee. Mouth feel seems non existent. I think Victory can do better than this by a long shot.  After I wrote what I said above, I saw a comment below saying that it is more of a black lager and yes!!! That’s it!! The post even said if it is a black lager than it is a good black lager! This is indeed a wonderful black lager and not a stout. Shame they call it a stout. It is the hops that add too much of a bitterness for a stout without the maltiness, yet for a black lager it is perfect.

Glad I found this one. Bought a 6-pack of 12-Oz bottles and went back for the case. In PA this one is $40 per case of 25 or $10.49/6-pack, and an exceptional deal. Appearance: Black, tan head, good lacing. Taste: Strong coffee, caramel, malts, balanced bitterness to offset the stout sweetness and clean finish.

That said, the crafting of the beer was good, the color and aroma promised malty goodness and the coffee bitter (in the aroma) didn’t put me off at all. But the taste- started out wonderfully and smooth and then the hops slammed into the party. Some people I am sure would call that “balance” but to me it’s just harshness in an otherwise excellent beer.

It’s 2021 and it’s “throw as much hops in the beer as you can find.” I loathe this trend and Victory has become a leader in it. Once upon a time, Storm King didn’t taste like a dyed black IPA. The whole black IPA thing is so oxymoronic and, frankly, idiotic, that I can’t even begin to explore it here. Oh and it feels as disappointing as the taste. Feels like a once decent stout and brewery have been sacrificed on the hip alter of fad. Which means neither were worth preserving to begin with, obviously. Should be a one but I am fair.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

345,1013,jrc1093,3.88,"Enjoy by 8/2/2023 (possibly bottled on 8/2/2018)  Pours a beautiful black body with hints of light revealing a faint light brown at the surface; about a finger of creamy light beige head with decent retention that results in a thick collar of froth and walls of uniform lacing coating the walls of the glass.  Aromas huge hops and plenty of roasted barley are overpowering at first, but some milk chocolate and faint dark roast coffee sneak in as the beer sits; very light tones of vanilla beans and toasted nuts come through intermittently.  Taste follows the aroma, bringing huge hops and bitter herbal notes leading to big roasted barley, raw coffee and dark chocolate that all smooths excellently as it warms; faint bits of toasted wood and a fleeting vanilla bean tone are invited in sparingly on the back end; hoppy edge is never abandoned, though.  Mouthfeel shows a robust body that nears hearty if it weren’t for a tinge of bitterness taking some of the heft away; balanced all-around but still burly, with minimal alcohol presence and a very dry finish that suits this stout’s profile nicely.  Burly hoppiness even for a straight-up, old-school imperial stout, and that was clearly the point. Admittedly, it’s overpowering at first, but increasingly welcoming as time passes and it warms. Well-done as an aggressive stout; I feel like I’d enjoy it even more with a few years of age on it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,ManapuaMan,3.92,"Finally picked up a bottle to enjoy. I always look forward to visiting beers with rich history and were once considered bombastic examples of American brewing.  Charcoal with a khaki head that lingers. Ruddy brown on the edges when held toward the light.  Aroma is char, rich dark fruit, roasted malt, dark coffee grounds and bitter chocolate.  Taste hits me with more of a Russian Imperial Stout as the dark fruits - plum, raisin, figs - are more prominent followed by bitter chocolate and coffee grounds.  Feel is thick but not chewy; it's a mouthful but nothing too heavy.

Mouthfeel is not quite fully full but definitely fuller than medium. Its got a drying finish I assume from the amount of hops used. Overall this reminds me of fresh yeti, very hoppy and bitter. But I think I like my stouts better without as much hop presence. Maybe this will be better in 2-3 years once the hops fade.

345,1013,JWT3,3.87,"Its dark stout beer with a tan head. Smells smokey but there are also some floral, pine and citrus aromas too. Upon first sip the beer is abrasively bitter in a hop forward sense. There's little toasty cocoa and coffee flavors until the beer is allowed to warm. Once this beer hits 47-50 degrees it is at the sweet spot and the hops and stout qualities balance. Would like to try it on cask.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

There's some bitter chocolate and light coffee notes. The coffee strengthens on the finish.  F---Not as thick as expected, but still full bodied.  O---This is a good one.

One finger of light tan head settles and sticks around as thin cap and thicker ring. Leaves behind some strings of lacing. Aroma is roasted malts and floral hops. Has some chocolate and dark fruit smells. Taste is roasted malts, some mild char, dark chocolate, and prominent floral hops. Some sweet dark fruit and vanilla participate. The end is, as described, the espresso darkness, not really bitter, but rich and thick. Medium to full mouth feel. Good carbonation for style. Quite smooth throughout. A hop heavy, rich tasting stout that provides some complex layers of taste. It has been a few years since I sampled this, but previously, this was my favorite heavy hopped stout. The experience is as I remembered.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

The head is meager, but stays along to the end. The nose is incredible with dark chocolate, dank root cellar, licorice, and coffee beans. The taste is all of the above, plus a surprising hop bite that comes across as a bitter espresso on the tail-end. The mouthfeel is a bit thin for a imperial stout. Overall a great brew.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Nass,3.73,I put off this beer for a while because I heard it was too hoppy. I decided to be a little brave & give it a go to see how hoppy it is. This is actually not terrible hoppy at all for an imperial stout. The flavors are a little mild. I am getting some roasted malts and a little dark chocolate presence on the backend. Maybe they have improved on this beer over the years because I actually like it. Cheers! B,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Picked it up without really knowing anything about it or a canned on date. Usually two no-no’s for me. Hoping to be surprised. Thought I liked Victory a little more until I just looked at my ratings. Only one of my eight previous reviews had at least a 4 and it was exactly a 4 (Headwaters Pale Ale). Quick look and most of these reviews were in 2011, my first year starting. Would certainly like to try a few of those again. Anyway, bottle read, “A thundering hop presence collides with massive espresso and dark chocolate notes in this full-bodied imperia stout.”  Poured a pitch black color with 3-to-4 fingers of khaki tan frothy head. Could see a few bubbles sneaking up along the sides of the glass. World-class spiderweb foamy lacing. Excellent retention. (Sight - 4.50)  Smelled dark chocolate syrup, mocha, malt chocolate, caramel, hazelnut, espresso, char wood, burnt coffee, roasty malts and crayon. Had me wanting to try it. (Smell - 4.00)  Taste followed the nose for the most part, but no hiding that 9.1 pct. ABV. Got dark chocolate, roasted coffee beans, char wood, toasty hazelnut, burnt coffee, dark cacao powder, roasted barley, anise and burnt popcorn. (Taste - 4.00)  Full body. Sticky texture. Average carbonation. Abrupt bitter finish. (Feel - 3.75)  Just a solid double stout. Outstanding.

F: Light, watery, crisp, lingering roasty dryness.  O: Meh.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,HorseheadsHophead,4.38,"The appearance is pitch black. A semi-aggressive pour yields a huge two-finger creamy tan head. The retention is moderate--after a few minutes, the head dies down to a thin half-finger tan film, but plenty of lacing is left behind. The nose is big, roasted, and bitter. It smells of unsweetened baking cocoa, beef broth/soy sauce, wet dirt, black licorice, pine, star anise, coffee grounds. The palate opens up with dark chocolate, a bit of toffee, blackberry, and molasses--just slightly sweet--before a massive wall of roasted malt and hop bitterness overtakes the palate. The dark chocolate transitions into baking cocoa, black licorice, star anise, and black coffee. Super hoppy as well, there's a ton of earth and pine. Slightly metallic as well, like copper. There's a bit of soy sauce and umami, but the massive bitterness steals the show, with the bitterness of black coffee, dark chocolate and pine leading long into the finish. The mouthfeel is medium-full, nice and well-rounded, mostly full, but the lively carbonation makes it quite drinkable. Overall, a really good stout. Dangerously drinkable.

T: Dark fruit and berries come through really strong on the flavor, espresso, roasted malts, finish is dry with lots of espresso lingering in the aftertaste, as the beer warms the dark fruit and berries do recede but the flavor is still there.  M: Full bodied with very little carbonation, moderate amount of coffee-like bitterness, finish is very dry.

There's a strong wallop of fruit and umami, as well, maybe a flash of licorice, and then a hint of coffee, chicory and wood mid-palate. Chocolate/ coffee bitterness lingers in the aftertaste.

The body is too dark for any carbonation to be seen rising. Some nice spotty yet spider web lacing speckles the sides of the glass. The smell has a spectacular blend of nice roasty malty with a slightly hidden sweetness that has a slight sugary brown molasses with some nice hops.

The smell is wonderful! Smells of perfectly roasted malts with some chocolate and and dark fruits. The roast is so close to perfect on the nose!  The taste is roasted malts and lots of hop bitterness with some rich coffee coming out. The hops are very prominent on the taste.  Mouth is medium with a wet finish that seems to leave a lingering hop bitterness on the palate.  This beer is not overly bad but does seem to have a clash of hop bitter that I did not care for. The perfectly roasted malt and coffee bitter were indactive to the style and greatly appreciated.

Smells good, though more like maybe a red ale or a bock with some toasted bread and moderate hops coming through. Also chocolate and coffee notes, as expected. Taste is similar, with hop bite and slight toastiness definitely coming through on the end. Feels slightly creamy with alcohol burn in the throat going down, though no offputting burn on the tongue.

I'm not so sure about the feel either, this one's a bit flat, which may be contributing to the difficulty drinking. Sorry Victory, this one didn't win me over. *UPDATE* Storm king is very enjoyable, more so at room temperature with a bit of aeration. I catch hints of dark black cherry and roasted wood.

Pitch dark black beer with a coffee, roasted malt, chocolate smell. Delivers as expected on the taste, giving you a decent bit of carbonation to make sure all that booze (9.1%) and intense flavor (detectable hops) goes down smooth. One of my favorite stouts to date. Killer buzz, killer beer, amazing brewery. Thank the stars they ship out to Texass. Warms my bones in an awesome, thought provoking way.

This quite possibly might have be the blackest of them all, truly black, as in it poured black and it stayed black even when held up to the light - impressive in my book. The smell was a sweet booziness that honestly made my mouth water. Though it was more carbonated that I would have liked, it was certainly smooth and the carbonation wasn't as strong as it got warm. This could have been an opulent brew, if it were not for the hops they used that gave it a slightly metallic tang (and an even stronger one as an aftertaste.)

345,1013,Nugganooch,4.05,"12oz bottle to my Barrelhouse Brewing snifter glass From notes – 11/15/15  A highly hopped RIS that barely clinches a balance to the burnt and roasted malt character.  Fairly viscous on the pour revealing a dark black-bean colored body with just a smidge of dark brown to the edges. Pulls out any light none the less. Thin blanket of creamy beige whip cream over top that subsides out to ring the glass. Presents a few small dots and streaks of lace. Bittersweet chocolate and equal parts coffee roast on the nose with some dark bread, berry fruit, and nutty caramels. There is a distinct fruity pine and herbal spice hop note along with some modest alcohol presence. One of the hoppiest stouts encountered yet and I rather enjoy it. Has a nice fruity element that compliments the coffee berries and cocoa powder. Further balanced with some toasted grain and brown sugar sweetness. The body is thinner than expected and this has a moderate amount of roast bitterness that creeps in by the finish lifting and drying into a lasting aftertaste of coffee, spice hops, and dark roasted grans. Alcohol is lightly rapping on the door.

Aroma after opening the bottle is all hops, which was a let down, not at all what I want to smell in an imperial stout, (unless of course it's billed that way). Taste is way too citrus and thin for being an imperial. I could taste the espresso and from what I could tell, the malt was a little over-roasted. Let warm for a bit, still way over the top hops for an imperial stout for my taste.

345,1013,LeRose,3.94,"I can only rate this in the here and now, but the bottle has a best by date of February, 2017. Dont know what that translates to in terms of bottle date.  Poured into a tulip an inky black with a bit of beige stout type head that fell to nothing.  Aroma is certainly absent any hop character. It is fig/date brown dried fruit, molasses, coffee, roast malt, and a note I cant pick out from the smell alone.  The taste is quite smooth, coffee, dried sweet fruit, brown sugar, molasses. There is an aftertaste that becomes easy to pick out as the beer warms, and it is licorice. Generally not a flavor I like in a stout, but this is in the aftertatse and it is clear but not overwhelming candy. More like licorice root or fennel.  The feel is oily, minimal carbonation, slick and smooth with the spicy note of the licorice livening things up.  Overall,this is a very good stout as consumed. I cant comment on a fresh bottle. Very good and would not hesitate to age this one even further.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Benish,3.28,"Appearance: black but with little translucence in the light. The head is a off-colored white that is thin and dissipated quickly. No lacings around the glass.  Aroma: hops, hops, and more hops. I do not pick up the common notes of coffee or chocolate. Just very earthy forward hops.  Taste: hops comes in fierce but there are subtle chocolate malt in the back. Overall, very bitter and earthy. Very strong bitter hops in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: medium bodied with the right amount of carbonation.  Overall: this beer takes after a black IPA, not an imperial stout. I've tasted beers labeled ""black IPA"" that tasted more like a stout than this beer. I would say go easy on the hops but since this beer has been around forever, clearly people like this and I'm in the minority.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Jacob_Hargis,4.13,"Poured in a traditional spiegelau glass. First time trying this beer, and I enjoy sampling imperial stout styles. Pours a dark brown to black body with a two finger frothy tan head with visible carbonation bubbles on the top. Initial aromas of roasted malts, fresh hop fuitiness, and burnt coffee. Subtle notes of dark chocolate when doing several of the smell tests. First taste, that fine roasted dark malt sweetness, significant whole cone hop profile that zings you right away which I found to be kind of surprising. Well blalanced though, and bitter/dry on the end. The mouthfeel is the winner in my opinion.. especially when the beer warms a bit more. This beer should NOT be drank super cold. Smooth, lightly carbed, and dry/bitter finish that you can really taste the addition of the whole cone hops for sure.

Aroma hit chocolate, roast, coffee notes.  This one floats seamlessly through the genres of stout, some irish dry aspect, the lactose in a small way of a milk stout, the heft of an imperial stout, the dark fruit of a russian imperial stout.

The first sensation is a very strong coffee influence. The texture is less then the look or aroma has lead me to anticipate. The bitterness is way up front with a moderate coffee followup.

Sweet burnt sugar or molasses is the heavy scent up front, ending smoky and a bit roasty as well, its hard to take your nose out of this guy. Sort of reminds me of coffee and pecan pie. The taste though, has almost none of the characteristics of the smell. The flavor is almost exclusively burnt malts, with hardly any sweetness or smokiness. Not much depth to the taste; I was honestly a bit underwhelmed. The mouthfeel is fine, medium to slightly thicker.  I was excited to try this when I saw it, being a stout/porter guy (and a fan of Victory), but truthfully, I wasn't really impressed. Not that it's bad in any way, it's a fair beer in its own right and it smells like heaven, but the taste leaves a lot to be desired.

345,1013,beercam,2.54,"Ouch, a very harsh beer. There are remnants of something big here, a overlooked work of high art, a great dream... but no more than remnants.  It begins with the visual claim to and bold evocation of the form of the imperial stout. Perhaps ,to some, the imperial stout is unsurpassable, known as a grand effort and gesture in brewing, the longest throw. Storm King's owl icon art paired with the Victory Brand label deliver a formidable nod in this deep, dark beer tradition and aesthetic, one shared and partaken of by many, as evidenced by the thousands of hads on this drink. This beer is opaque, dark, black. It fills any drinkware quickly, and like oil. At pour, a 3 inch, tense, dense, slow boil of foam appears, tan-brown and perpetually lingering. Smell-wise, there is much promise here. Familiar, metallic, astringent aromas bound forth, heavy hops and malt, very complex and balanced, leaning here towards Russian Imperial style in figgy, oaky, vanilla smokiness yet still aggressively hoppy. Taste is where it all goes down for me in this Pennsylvania beer, and not necessarily in a good way. The flavor, if you will, comes on very well, very strong, porter-esque and buildling, and then just kind of flops. Pine, hops, malt, and brazen, syrupy, molassesy, yeasty, worty tastes take center-stage here. Unfortunately, despite summoning all of these exciting notes, what came next to tongue and mind was a seriously unpleasant, out-of-control black pepper, and way over-roasted malt. Now, again, I like the olefactory elements of this beer, which pulled the taste up from a serious 0 to a 1.5, but where the smell promises, the taste under-performs. The alcohol scrambles and overwhelms to compensate and fails. The taste itself brings nothing to enjoy for me over the course of one of these 12 oz'ers. The flat, thin, sourness both introduces and gives way to a slick, pulpy, rind-y mouthfeel, with a bit of an elmer's glue problem of an after-presence.  Speaking of bottles, considering the notably low carbonation of this beer, I thought if poured into a nice new can-glass (maybe foolish), maybe it would mellow out towards something like a nitro feel? Nah, it just went flat :(.  By now you may have gathered that I didn't love this beer, and after a 4-pack, I didn't really have any beatific experiences to relate from or while drinking it. But look, just because I don't love it, doesn't mean I hate it. In fact I even like it, because I like all beer, but in this review's frame, I would not considerate to be among the pleasurably drinkable strong beers. Overall, this is not really a recommendable imperial stout, by me, at this point in time. Maybe tweak this one, Victory?

Tan 1.5 inch bubbly, creamy head from a moderately agressive pour that recedes slowly, lumpily, leaving thick lacing, eventually becoming a thin collar. Overall, an excellent looking stout. Aroma is sweet fruits, a hint of chocolate, coffee, roastiness. Thick feel with little carbonation. Taste starts out with dark fruits, roasty malts, and transitions to a nicely balanced bitterness in the finish. It is true that the level of hops bittering is greater than would be the style standard, but it works very well in this big beer. Moderate booziness remains in the back of the mouth and the throat. This is a very tasty, wonderful imperial stout. Well balanced between the sweet dark fruits and roasty malt and hops bittering.

F: Smooth, creamy. Only complaint is the beer is really astrigent, which isn't as nice with a heavy beer like this. O: Good beer, definately will drink again but its definately a sipper, not something I can toss back like water (like most beers).

Strong coffee flavor gives way to some malty sweetness and ends with some hoppy bitterness.  F: Smooth to drink. A little lighter on the mouth feel than I was expecting. Prepared myself for it to be a little more chewy. Coffee and bitterness linger around after a moderately dry finish. Very little to no alcohol burn for an Imperial Stout clocking in at 9.1% ABV.

345,1013,hoptheology,3.43,"Served in a large snifter.  Appearance : Initially a brown pour from the bottle which turns into a dark chocolate colored body with 100% opacity. The head was almost gone by the time I sat down (which was about enough time to snap a picture and load it to Photobucket for WBAYDN; a 60 second procedure). It started out at about a finger high, which wasn't impressive to begin with. It has almost entirely dispersed across the top of the beer, and is even nonexistent in some places. Unfortunately I'll have to rate this just below the bar for par, normally a 4 for me.  Smell : Molasses and cookie dough. Burnt barley malts. Hint of hop leaf. Final note is scorched chocolate. The aroma overall is not really rich or decadent, but more funky and bizarre. Quite a few off-notes here.  Taste : Very roasted. The definition of roast in a stout. Coffee, torched chocolate, some hop oils, a pinch of tobacco, and a big finish of fresh coffee grounds. Set all of these flavors on fire, mix them together, and you have a good idea of Storm King. (edit : As it warms a bit, it becomes completely undrinkable. I'm pouring the rest of this one.) (second edit : had another one and it was burnt beyond drinking, dumped half of it. Adjusted scores accordingly.) 3rd trial : a bit better but mostly astringent with coffee and cocoa .  Feel : Fairly dense, mildly chewy, with a creaminess and zaps of carbonation to keep it lively.  Overall : This was not particularly enjoyable for me. The head on the beer disappeared quicker than the T-1000 regenerating from an injury. The aroma was not horrible, but was off in places. And the taste, while very big, was a bit too roasted and hoppy, taking away from the smoothness of an otherwise warming beer style. Once the beer had warmed a few degrees, a whole calvary of off-flavors surfaced and now it just tastes like fermented fruit and a mouthful of quarters soaked in motor oil.

345,1013,DabblinWiscCraft,4.2,"Picked up a single bottle as part of a build-your-own-sixer at my local Stein's Liquor. The enjoy by date suggests it's still good for almost four years. Poured at cellar temperature into my Samuel Smith pint glass.  L: Pours a deep coffee black with about three fingers of dense tan head that sticks around for a good while and leaves considerable lacing on the glass.  S: Roasted, toasty, and sweet caramel malts are all in play in the bouquet. On top of all this, there are definite citrus and (more sublte) pine hop notes. There's a bit of spice to this one, as well. I'm picking up some anise and the faintest sarsaparilla.  T: Sweet and roasty at the front end, with a very inviting malt profile. The middle brings on some of those hop and spicier notes from the bouquet, including the anise and sarsaparilla. Those hops work tremendously with the malts, proving some great complexity without losing balance. The back end has more of the hops, which provide a good bit of bitter on top of the sweeter malts. There's also just the slightest amount of clear alcohol coming through, but it's covered remarkably well by the lingering hop bitter aftertaste.  F: This one is pretty firmly medium-bodied. It has nice creaminess thanks to a good level of carbonation; it finishes with a bit of lingering bitter, but it's far from syrupy. If anything, this one could be a little thicker.  O: I haven't had a Storm King in some time, and I can't for the life of me figure out why. This is a great-tasting, complex stout that brings a good deal of ABV in a very unobtrusive way.

345,1013,Shade1951,3.07,"I'm a BIG fan of Victory Beers. In this case, I am somewhat disappointed. This is an okay imperial stout. As others have noted in various forums, there is a ""default"" Victory taste profile. Hoppiness dominates that profile, regardless of the style of beer.  The outstanding imperial stouts I have had do NOT have a very hoppy profile. I love hops in beer, but there is a time and place for using hops. In this case, the highly hoppy taste works against the style overall.  The look is about as good as anyone can ask for - almost pitch black. But the smell exposes the high hops content. The bitter hops overwhelm any other smell - such as coffee, leather, and so on that one often gets in such a beer.  The taste isn't bad. It just doesn't taste much like an imperial stout. It tastes like Victory's brewmaster's take on an imperial stout - which may be exactly the intention. I just wish Victory would tone down the hops character in the case of this beer. Hops are great, but they don't make EVERYTHING taste better.  I bought a case of this, and I will enjoy it. It's far from drain pour. It's just not, in my estimation, an imperial stout.  UPDATE, 9-17-17 Tried this again. I'm still not wild about it. In fact, I like it less. Now the taste also has a ""dirty"" flavor to it. Dirty as in soily.

345,1013,Redneckwine,4.38,"12oz bottle into tulip  Appearance - Black as night, no light penetrates. A two finger dark tan head persists well and leaves lots of sticky lacing.  Smell - Really nice and hoppy up front, but not in a very distinct way - sweet, fruity, a little piney. The hops are blending very nicely with the mild roasty coffee and cocoa notes in the background.  Taste - Follows the nose very closely. Pretty big hop burst up front... Very IPA-like with plenty of sweet, juicy fruit (even a bit tropical in nature), citrus, a little piney and grassy. Hops balance well and provide some light bitterness and dryness. On the back end the stout complexities come into play with roasty malts, a bit of char, dark fruits, plenty of earthy coffee and cocoa suggestions. Booze is very well hidden. Finishes off-dry with some moderate resin hop bitterness. The hops and dark malts definitely play nice together.  Feel - Ample carb is super smooth and creamy, which suits the full body perfectly. Feels thick and rich, but not heavy. Drinkability is high for the style.  Overall - Pretty killer stout here... Or is it an IPA? It's definitely hopped up to IPA levels. Stout IPA?

Lacing follows, but slowly leeches into the stout.  S- roasted malts, notes of vanilla sweetness, citrusy hops.  T- dueling tastes of deeply roasted malt and spicy hops. Malt sweetness compliments the tangy hop character. Some vanilla notes throughout the malt sweetness. Hop forward stout. Spicy hops linger through the finish. The beer improves as it warms; the hops mellow slowly as the sweetness asserts itself more.  M- sharp carbonation, thick and oily feel. Well balanced.

345,1013,do_ob,4,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter. Pours a heavy, deep, dark brown in a well lit room. Damn near black. Head is khaki in color and slow to form. Tops out at about a finger's width and disappeared altogether after about 3 sips. Low carbonation. Decent aroma of dark fruit, roasted malt, baked nuts, chocolate, coffee, and maybe some cinammon. The initial taste introduces strong hints of chocolate, hops, and roasted malt. There's a hevy presene of chocolate and baking spices, along with notes of light tropical fruit. Has a decently smooth finish. Aftertaste put me in mind of black coffee (slightly bitter but also sweet).  This beer has a moderate alcohol taste, as well as an overly-hoppy profile for an imperial stout. It's a good beer, just a bit different from the norm. As has been stated in other review, more of a Black IPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

345,1013,Beer-Revelry,3.83,"Poured into a Duvel snifter glass.  A - 4.50 - Pours jet black with a decent head potential, forms a finger of medium tan colored head. Low head retention, dissipates quickly. Spotty lacing left on the glass. S - 4.50 - Malts, dark chocolate, currants, black strap molasses and a touch of coffee. T - 3.25 - Too much hop profile, needs to be aged out. Medium sweet malt, chocolate and currant upfront which is pleasant, but quickly fades into a black IPA reminiscent hoppy bitterness that lingers for quite a long time on the palate and in my opinion, quite frankly has no place in an imperial stout. Really takes away from the experience for me. F - 4.25 - Good mouthfeel. Decently thick. O - 3.75 - Fresh, this thing drinks more like an triple imperial black IPA than an imperial stout. It has the qualities of a stout upfront, but sadly the hoppy finish really takes over. I feel this one needs a lot of time to age out that hop profile and may be revisiting this review a year or two down the road from now.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Originally capped with a medium-blend coffee roast colored head, which subsides down to a thing and sustained ring around the top. Lacing is small bands around the wall of my snifter.  Aroma: Roasted espresso beans, bright hops, a whiff of booze. It’s a great combination, like a Wilson to Walters pass, with protection by Malcolm Smith and Bruce Irvin.  Taste: Throughout the entire oral experience, I taste the hops. Espresso notes from the malt play along, and it ends with some heat and more hops. I saw somewhere this was originally meant to be a dark IPA (or I like to call them Cascadian Dark Ales). I completely understand, but because of the espresso qualities of the malt roast, and the abv, I can see why they settled Imperial Stout.  Feel: Medium body, tiny bubbles. A touch filmy or oily, which is fine. I want a little coating with my stouts.  Overall: Like their other boozy offering I tried recently (Dirtwolf- seriously, what took me so long to try that?)

345,1013,teromous,3.59,"(from the label) Enjoy By: 10 JUL 2019 C442 P  Appearance: Black body with a narrow foamy light tan head. Fades quickly to a ring.  Aroma: It has an oak barrel aroma and some strong caramel scents. The bottle doesn't say anything about barrel aging but it has that woody smell. There is a bit of pine in there too. All of this is very subtle, but if you take the time it will really come through.  Taste: Interesting. It has a very strong pine and mint quality, backed by this acrid smokey charcoal flavor. It's a lot like what camping in the woods would taste like. It probably sounds funny but that's what it is to me.  Mouthfeel: It has this sharp bite that kicks you in the pants. It can be pretty harsh if that's not what you're looking for in a stout. It's the type of beer you'd want to drink with some sort of snack to cleanse the palate. Nobody would ever say this beer is boring.  Overall: It was a beer that was worth trying. It had a strong presence that really does define what I'd expect from an American Stout. Lots of flavor and palate-shocking presence that makes it worth drinking.

There is a bit of alcohol on the back end as well, but not overpowering, pretty subtle. Mouthfeel: I thought the mouthfeel on this one was a bit thin, and somewhat dry on the finish. Overall: This is a very good brew, pretty hoppy for an impy stout, but definitely not in a bad way.

Appearance: Pours a beautiful, completely opaque, pitch-black color with a quarter of a finger of caramel-colored head that quickly dissolved into an extremely thin lacing of foam that partially covered the top of the beer.  Aroma: I’m stuffed up at the moment (I know that being in that condition is not ideal for reviewing a beer) but even so, I can still smell very strong aromas of roasted malt, some subtle smoke, and dark chocolate.  Taste: Strong flavors of roasted malt up front, imparting notes of roasted coffee beans, followed by some subtle smoke, some brown sugar-like sweetness, finished with some well-balanced hops. Delicious!!  Mouthfeel: Chewy and pretty smooth, as there is some slight carbonation. With an ABV of 9.1%, there’s quite a bit of alcohol on the palate, imparting some very pleasant warmth.  Overall: Damn, this is another excellent imperial stout! It has great flavors of roasted malt, sweetness and balanced hops. While not exactly world class like Bell’s Kalamazoo Stout, Founders Imperial Stout, Great Lakes Black-Out Stout and Oskar Blues Ten Fidy, it’s almost up there, and I’ll certainly keep some of this in my cellar!

Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, caramel, toffee, toast, dark bread, citrus zest, pine, floral, grass, light smoke/char, and floral/roasted earthiness.

Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth, creamy, and lightly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish.

Appearance – A super dark black amber with a moderate head and moderate lacing. The head diminishes to a thin layer fairly quickly.  Smell – Wow, a very robust, super malty scent. I’m not smelling the hops that others noticed, likely because of the aging. Semi-sweet chocolate as well.  Taste – A wonderful malty flavor. Again, not much hop flavor, but that’s a big plus in my opinion for a stout.  Mouthfeel – Thick, creamy, nicely carbonated and smooth. No bad aftertaste.

After warming the malt, roasted, and chocolate tones become more noticeable. Could be some sort of oxidation or alcohol but extremely faint and very much masked by the hops.  T - Lots of delicious flavor having nice robust character with a malty, roasty, chocolaty, and some sweetness but the hops stand tall. Probably the most hops in an imperial stout that I've ever experience. The bitterness from the hops is definitely present but not overpowering.  M - Full mouth-feel with moderate carbonation. Not an oil slick but not a light feeling beer and a nice bitterness that makes it a great beer for occasional drinking.  Overall, this imperial stout is really good. I enjoy the hop backbone that isn't typical of RIS's. It isn't as heavy as some RIS's either but is a very tasty brew. It's not quite a black IPA but it is enough hop to make you wonder if it still fits in the Imperial stout category.

She coaxes you from your littoral home with hoppy succulence, then drags you into the abyss with a dusky, violating tentacle of bitter cocoa.

Appearance: finger of dark brown head, dissipates quickly, black, opaque. It's an imp stout....standard stuff  Smell: baker's chocolate, cocoa powder, bitter dark chocolate, little bit of hops (floral).  Taste: lot of roastiness, dark chocolate, black licorice, burnt espresso, huge amount of bitterness in the finish that lingers on the tongue and back of mouth. There is no creaminess or unusual flavors. The front and middle is fine but the finish is so overpoweringly bitter that it ruins the beer.  Mouthfeel: oddly thin for such a big 9.1% beer. Carbonation higher than usual for a stout.  Overall: sorry to say another disappointment from Victory. Not understanding the hype for this beer or the brewery.

Dirtwolf out of a bottle also has that soy sauce smell and taste. I only like soy sauce on my rice and sushi. The taste is also of soy sauce, but some of the other traditional stout tastes make me forget about the soy sauce in my beer. Really, the taste is of light roast, mocha, vanilla, and soy sauce.

M: thick, like an RIS should be, and somewhat explosive from the hops, though still pretty smooth.  O: a solid imperial stout. Not one of the greats, but nearly so, and much more affordable.

Nice, complex with a good balance & most of the alcohol hidden.  Coffee & a chocolate sweetness. Strong dark malts taste very faint alcohol. Dark fruit start & some hops plus some good roasted flavours.  Smooth, creamy with the alcohol pretty well hidden. Full bodied with medium carbonation. Easy to drink, frighteningly so with some bitterness & a dry finish.  A good imperial stout with a pleasantly sweet taste & a good combination of chocolate &coffee initially. The hops were a great addition & it proved easier to drink than a 9% abv. beer should have done with the alcohol well hidden for the most part.

345,1013,BaalDagon,2.85,"As I popped the top and gathered the aroma, I was excited to experience this brew by Victory. According to the brews that I had listed, I was advised I would appreciate this suggestion. Watching the wonderfully viscus, onyx in appearance, liquid flow into my glass, I felt that I was in for a real treat. I watched in anticipation as the head developed into a beautiful caramel in color froth. Next, I brought my glass to my lips, fully expecting the chocolate/coffee notes that the brewery assured me of on the label, and that's where things went south. I chalk up what happened next to my inexperience with stouts because I was overwhelmed with one taste... espresso, BLACK ESPRESSO! The next thing I could taste was alcohol, which left me with a rather sour experience. If high grav stouts are your thing, then I guess this might be right up your ally, but for this ""Aspirant,"" I will have to go back to the drawing board. I might come back to this beer at a later date to give it another shot as my palate evolves, but at this stage...

A lot of Victory's are fantastic and there are, literally, 1000's upon 1000's of reviews on each one so my review and all others are sort of lost but I'd like my 2 cents on record for what I deem the best of the lot. Being from Philly, there are a lot of Victory's everywhere. The best place is the Victory Beer Garden down where the Spectrum used to be. It is an amazing place with what seem to be, dozens of the big ""V"", tap handles along an enormous bar. I've had this beer there too. It has a kick to it and has a large, magnificent coffe-ish colored head. When I pour from the bottle I use a Duval Tulip glass and the head fills the upper end of the 22 oz glass. Quite impressive.

The bitter hangs on for a bit but is slightly offset by that ineffable dark fruit. Mouthfeel: Oddly gritty. Does hang about in the mouth for a long time. Overall: The sum of the parts are greater than the individual components on this one and it is a good solid stout.

Head fades slowly. Lots of fine, slow carbonation to sustain the head. Smell is a little smokey, some black licorice. Maybe lots of black licorice. Some kind of light, plummish aroma.  Taste is coffee and plums and smoke, in an interesting and fairly successful way.  Mouthfeel is nice, not too heavy or too light, not too sticky or too thin. Overall, this is a very good beer. Originally: 3.75 | 4.00 | 4.00 | 4.00 | 4.00 --- 2021-11-18 12oz bottle sent to me by @jonphisher. Served in a footed pilsner glass, pretty cold. Label is stamped: Best By Oct 07 22 PBG 21280 2008. Hoping that's packaged on the 280th day of 2021, which would be October 7th, which would make sense for a one year ""best by"" date. Jon told me that it's a different experience fresh.  Pours black with a nearly one inch thick, dense, creamy head that collapses to mostly a thin skin with some thick spots, and a remarkably even skin of lacing on the side of the glass. Smell is tons of dark roast and some anise. I could describe it as smokey, but mostly I get really dark roasted coffee aroma. Taste is...well...delicious, to start with. I was expecting something almost harsh from the aroma, but it's not. I get the dark roast coffee flavors front and center, but not tasting burnt or overwhelming. I get a lot of anise too, but also not overwhelming. I get almost a meaty / umami sense from it, but it's more of a background accent, and definitely not a flaw. Almost a burnt brown sugar sweetness, maybe molasses. And something creamy. Mouthfeel is thick, rich, satisfying, creamy.

There is a 1.5 finger mocha head which dissipates fairly quickly although some of it remains on the top until the end; very light lacing.  This brew smell like old socks. There is a light roasted malt smell along with a very faint coffee and nut smell but the old socks smell dominates; perhaps I got a skunked batch.  The taste is as lame as the smell, there is an old socks/musty taste along with some roasted malt and burnt coffee. There is the tiniest bit of chocolate taste in mix. No real discernible hop taste.

Very good head retention and huge globs of lacing clinging to the sides of the glass.  The first thing that strikes me about the aroma is that there is a very distinct powdered cocoa/maple syrup note that seems odd. There is some pine that sneaks through underneath but it is predominantly malt showing through.  The flavor really carries nothing of this maple syrup and cocoa note as the piney hops are the key feature. Coffee and roasted malt is in the background with a hint of chocolate but hops really rule. Fairly high bitterness throughout but a somewhat watery mouthfeel.  Overall, this is somewhat of a cross between an imperial stout and a black ipa.

345,1013,fps_dean,4.7,"I've been trying a lot of Victory brews lately, the latest being the Storm King Stout.  I poured this into a glass from a bottle. It poured with minimal head, and appears jet black, with a slight transparency if held up to a light, hinting that it is not as thick as most imperial stouts.  Smells of piney hops, coffee, chocolate, and malt.  The initial taste is coffee and chocolate, but over time, with the bitterness from piney hops following. While definitely a hop heavy imperial stout, it's very well balanced and there's nothing offensive here.  It goes down extremely smooth for any beer and especially for an imperial stout, and is not nearly as thick or as strong as most imperial stouts are either. I was expecting something much thicker from an imperial stout, and I will say it was quite a pleasant surprise.  Overall, this is a great, unique imperial stout I will definitely buy again. It's not too far from a black ale because its extra hops and not as thick as most imperial stouts, but still definitely an imperial stout, and a very good one at that.  It's also higher in alcohol content. The official ABV is 9.1%, but it goes down like something around 7% would and like most Victory brews goes down smooth so this is one to be careful with. Overall, I really like this one and due to how easy it goes down, it would not seem too out of place drinking this on a hot summer night.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

The flavor is; thankfully, not as subtle as the nose. It is a rich blend of coffee, smokiness, vanilla, leather, alcohol heat, and a pleasant sweet caramel undertone.

O - Whole cone hops give this beer a different flavor profile compared to most Imperial Stouts. This hop and chocolate malt combination makes it a little more bitter than I would normally prefer.

345,1013,KYGunner,4.1,"This poured with a relative thickness but still kept a lively carbonated look. The color was deeply opaque with a khaki head that was more film than foam.  The nose holds a bit of dryness but despite this there is some marshmallow sweetness. Mostly chocolate malt meets the nose but tones of smoke or ember, Graham cracker, mint and toasted oats also are found.  The taste follows the nose for the most part as a dry smoky or roasted chocolate malt is prevalent. Smoky ember, toasted oat, dry coffee and charcoal meets up with the maltiness.What I like above the nose is the assertive nature of the flavor. Mostly dry roast or toasted qualities the flavor holds the palate throughout. This does end with a hint of bitterness that influences feel. As with the feel an alcohol warmth creeps in.

Hints of chocolate are present but minimal.  T - This is one of the hoppier stouts I've tried. The open is bitter, but coupled with dark dried fruits, like raisins, combining with burnt toast. The middle opens up with the sweetness, even more heavily raisins, but also plums and prunes. Closing adds in more dark fruit, but with a hop finish. A stout with hop drying isn't your typical stout. Honestly, the chocolate here is more in the texture, a point beneath the ebb and flow of what is out front.  M - As mentioned, drying is present. The beer is not a silky smooth experience. It remains a drinker rather than a sipper, which means the balance isn't completely out of wack. There is no risk of cloying sweetness here.  O - This beer is something of a bull in a china shop. There is depth here, with a variety of flavors flashing over my palate, but one aspect of stouts I generally value is the silky smoothness. Plus, I am a big sucker for coffee chocolate notes in my stouts, and their absence is something missed for me.

Right away I'm hit with the smell of charred wood, then when I lean in closer I get citrus hops, subtle chocolate, sweet malted grains, and coffee.

Epic lacing coats literally every inch of the glass. Make no mistake; this is one good looking beer.  S - Strong aroma of black coffee, chocolate, and charred grains.  T - Big espresso/coffee taste forward, so much so it's like drinking an espresso bean. Hint of bakers chocolate in the mid-palate brings a touch of sweetness, but then burnt grains, yet more coffee, and some earthy, tea-like hops bring back the bitterness. Not terribly complex, but the flavor is excellent and the components balance one another well.  M - It is here where the increased hop presence really makes it self known; somewhat acidic and slightly ""rough"" on the tongue. Medium bodied. A little over carbonated (medium). Some flaws here.  O - A very good Imperial Stout overall, and a must for those ""really bitter stout"" lovers. (I personally tend to favor more dark fruit flavors in an Imperial Stout). Could be improved in the mouth feel (could use more body and smoothness) but would definitely drink again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,jpd026,4.63,"Is this a stout or a black IPA? That's what I and I'm sure you will be asking after you try this for the first time. I was afraid after having a Cigar City Jai Alai and a Cpt. Lawrence Seeking Alpha that I wouldn't be able to appreciate the taste and hopiness my coworkers said it had but lo and behold, it's the hopiest beer I've had all night.

345,1013,hopflyer,3.77,"Aged 2 years  Pours deep black, thin tan head  not overly deep smells of anything but the roasted malts are there, coffee and a touch of earthy hops. Something else I can't quite get, almost cheese like.  Taste up front is balance of coffee, faint chocolate, and bitter and earthy hops. Not the robust stout malt wise since the hops disallow any smoothness the malt bill may attempt.  The hops in this really set the tone for the feel of this. They seem to cut thru the creamy viscous stout that just wants to make itself known. Unusual in that it's almost dry, but not really. The carb is low to moderate.  I love victory's beers and this one is solid from them. I kinda like my hops more subdued in a big stout but I like combo they went for on this one.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,JJKBeerLvr,4.1,"Sampled April 2014, and poured from a bottle into pint glass.  Appearance: Very dark almost black, with nice dark head. The head lasted a very long time, and left a nice coating on the inside of the glass.  Smell: Pleasant, with a nice balance. Can smell both the hops and roasted malts, but surprisingly for a Stout, the hops dominates.  Taste: A nice mix of hops, coffee, and malts. The hops are a little more prominent than other stouts. There are hints of some sweetness like chocolate, but the hops dominates the flavor. There is a nice mix of hop and malt influence in the after taste.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, and with an average body.  Overall: This is an interesting stout, and I would buy another case.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Re-Sampled November 2018, also from a bottle into a pint glass. The aroma was prominent from when pouring the beer. It was a nice mix of sweet and hoppy aromas. I enjoyed the prominent taste of hops more this time.

345,1013,ThePaintedGrey,4.39,"12oz. bottle poured into imperial pint glass.  A: Admittedly, I'm a bit aggressive with my stout pours. I'm a big fan of excessive head (tee hee). A nice three-finger khaki head retains for several minutes before dissipating to a dense, creamy cap. A very nice amount of lacing shrouds portions of the glass. iPhone flashlight test reveals that this stout is nearly completely black, with very minimal shades of blood red highlights towards the bottom of the glass. Just how I like it; black as night!  S: Black medium-roast coffee with a spoonful or two of sugar, some dark chocolate, and a slight hint of dark fruit that I almost want to identify as raisins. Unlike a lot of stouts, I'm also picking up a track of hops. A very slight hint of orange citrus? Truly a wonderful, aroma, however.  T: Dear lord! Tons of roasted malts upfront. A huge coffee profile, leaning more towards a medium-roast rather than dark roast; however, it still provides a glorious amount of dark bitterness. The roasted bitterness is quickly balanced out by a short wave of brown sugar and semi-sweet chocolate with an ever-so-delicate touch of licorice. Luckily for bitter-buffs like myself, the chocolate dessert-like profile is squelched in the finish by a resurgence of roast coffee and a touch of rustic hops.  M: This is my favorite part of imperial stouts, and Victory delivers with a gold-medal body. This brew is absolutely full-bodied with a divinely creamy texture that coats every nook and cranny of your mouth with its malty, roasted greatness. The alcohol, with the exception of some cheek-warming qualities, it absolutely blanketed. I could sip this slowly all throughout the week!  O: Call me insane, but I personally herald this as one of the greatest stouts on the market. It may not be overflowing with unique complexity, but gosh darn it, this is one hell of an enjoyable brew! When it comes to Victory Storm King, it's not about how unique it is... it's about how flawlessly Victory executed flavors that other breweries have failed to deliver in the past. Chalk this bad boy up as one of my favorite stouts to date. Anyone who's a fan of the style NEEDS to experience this, if they already haven't.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,timfelix,3.85,"very good product, for this type. Lots of flavor: hops, and malts abound. This is one strong brew- not for everyone. But if you enjoy a strong, hoppy stout- it is top notch.

345,1013,barczar,3.84,"Pours a deep brown, opaque, with a frothy cappuccino head that slowly dissipates, leaving sticky lacing.  Malted milk balls, toasted malt, and coffee form the initial aroma. There's a hint of dark fruit and floral hop character.  Coffee and roast malt dominate the flavor profile, which finishes bitter and charred. Underpinnings of chocolate and raspberry offer respite. Bitterness is dominant and lingering.  Body is fairly thick, with minimal carbonation and moderate alcohol warmth. There's quite an astringent finish.  The astringent and bitterness really kill this for me. Perhaps, with age, it would mellow a bit.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,LambicPentameter,3.94,"Enjoyed out of a 12 oz brown bottle with an etched-on freshness date that reads ""enjoy by Mar 4, 2018"". That's right--four years from now. Seeing as how I've had this bottle a few months already, my best guess is that Victory uses a five year lead time for this beer. Poured into a small Belgian snifter glass.  Appearance - So far, so good. This looks like a classic imperial stout, with a deep darkness that seems to suck in all light. Only when I put it in front of a flashlight do I see hints of burgundy around the edges of the glass, and even then I'm surprised by how little of the light beam gets through. It's like a black hole of beer. Atop the pitch black body sits a generous two finger head the color of rich chocolate truffle that eventually dissipates to a healthy-looking film that varies in thickness across the lake of motor oil. Decent sheets of lacing are interspersed along the sides of the glass and remain for the duration of my enjoyment of the beer.  Smell - What the... if I'm not mistaken, that is the distinctly pungent aroma of hops. Hoppy to the point of overpowering a lot of the more traditional stout flavor profiles. Loads of citric acidity soar over much more subtle notes of baker's chocolate and roasted malt, along with more hop presence in the form of tree bark and freshly-churned wet soil. The aroma has taken a surprisingly pleasant left turn from the appearance after this looked like it would be a straightforward imperial stout.  Taste - Again, the hops are leading the charge, but now they pull a caravan of rich flavors behind them. Dark fruits, licorice, more bittersweet chocolate and charred caramel storm over my tastebuds. But they are not to be outdone by the in-your-face astringency of the citrus and resiny hops. There is a lingering bitterness on the palate like you might expect from a piece of toast that spent just a bit longer than it should have in the toaster oven.  Mouthfeel - This is the first point at which I feel a tad let down, as this beer lacks the viscosity and body that I prefer in my big, bold stouts. Body is full, but closer to medium, and carbonation is medium to low. Finish is bitter.  Overall, a very well done beer, and certainly unique amongst imperial stouts. I've never had one that was so hoppy--and it's hoppy to the point that if someone had told me this was the beer that inspired the oxymoronic term ""black IPA"", I wouldn't be surprised in the slightest. I personally prefer this style to be much more easygoing with the hops--especially of the citric variety--but I can't in good conscience write this beer off due to my personal preferences. It is very well crafted.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Pours basically opaque black with white head. Yep, imperial stout. The nose is where it changes because its hop heavy. The taste is the kicker because front of the mouth its ipa hoppy but back of the mouth its malty stout deliciousness. Awesome beer and inexpensive. Great stout for hopheads. They should call this a black ipa. I would love to try a bourbon barrel version of this",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,lechap,2.75,"Poured very flat with little head. Cut to the chase, I just don't enjoy these heavier/stronger stouts. It's not the higher ALC but an unpleasant aftertaste. I read that imperial stouts were originally exported to Russia. That may account for the rumors of Russian women being overly hairy and their success as weight lifters. I'll settle for a good dry Irish stout or oatmeal stout any day. They are just so smooth when compared to imperials.

Smell: You can tell this will be a quite bitter RIS with the floral hop notes. Roasted malts and chocolate aromas are secondary, which is not typical for a stout in general.  Taste: This is my favorite aspect of this beer. The hops seem to open up every characteristic which dance a number on your tongue. Between the chocolate, roasted malts, and smokiness, the hops keep it all in check and keep you begging for more.  Mouthfeel: Medium carbonation for a RIS and more bitter than I am used to from this style, but the flavor makes up for it.  Overall: A very unique take on an American Russian Imperial Stout, which could be for better or worse, but for me I really enjoy it and the flavor alone keeps me coming back.

The smell is very complex, with coffee, char and chocolate fighting some strong hops. This may be the strongest hops precense that I've ever encountered in a Stout. The taste is intense as well, the hops forward and fighting the deep roasted coffee and chocolate charecteristics, oddly enough to a draw. This could have been a bitter disaster like many Black IPA's that I have tried, but been totally underwhelmed by. One could say this is well balanced for all the competing flavors creating a tumultous harmony. It's silky too, a bitter aftertaste, but pleasantly bitter like you expect from a good Stout.

Flavor is more appropriate to the style. Big black coffee notes, with powdered cocoa and roasted barley. Tons of hops, but they really provide bite and bitterness more than flavor. Earthy hops and pepper, if anything, with some sweet citrus on the very back-end.  Feel is silky smooth, with nice balance and bite (both from hops and from the roast). Fantastic retention and aftertaste. Could use a bit more thickness, but it's far from thin.  This is an excellently balanced beer, full of surprises, but ultimately a very good and drinkable stout.

Moderate retention keeps the tight bubbles afloat long enough for them to grip the glass' walls.  S - A certain level of oxidation has affected the beer but, due to it's age that's inevitable. Slight wet cardboard notes aside, Storm King is brimming with warm alcohol and a conglomerate of roasted malt characteristics; chocolate covered raisin, thin molasses, and a tickle of acrid bitterness behind the smooth caramel notes.  T - Smooth milk chocolate dribbles over raisins and collects lightly roasted, ground coffee beans along the way for a voluptuous flavor of malty goodness that's not so infiltrated by oxidation as the aroma displays, finishing out with just an ever so slight nod to earthy hops within.  M - Moderate carbonation allows the otherwise medium-bodied beer a fuller feel as this smooth stout glides down the throat with warming alcohol in tow, finishing with just the right amount of bitter balance.  O - It's been a pleasure to enjoy this one six-pack over the past few years but I'll openly admit that I remember nothing about it fresh nor it's development; the only thing I remember about Storm King is that I've always liked it.

345,1013,SerialTicker,3.89,"Enjoy by July 5th 2018. Poured into a shaker pint. $2.49 single.  Appearance: Well, it's basically pitch black -- no surprise there. The great thing about this beer is the lacing. There's a two finger creamy, tan head on it, but it doesn't last long... but the lacing's fantastic.  Smell: Man, I don't know. The best way for me to describe the smell is wet cardboard. That sounds absolutely awful, but it's actually... not. I figure it's the variety of hops that they use mixing with the dark malts, but I don't know how else to tell you what this beer smells like.. at FIRST. As the head slowly goes entirely away, coffee opens up, and the beers smells more like, well, a beer with a solid amount of roast. Still, Storm King never smells mouth watering.  Taste/feel: A mouth watering, almost tangy character is the first thing I notice... this beer really is chock full of hops, as many people have said. A lot of earthy character brought on by them, and that works very well with the roasted notes. There's a bit of alcohol flavor and warmth on the finish, but not as ""hot"" as many other RIS's I've had. Pretty nice mouthfeel, as I had hoped for, given the style.  A very good beer, but not great. Honestly, I expected a lot more. This seems to be a favorite amongst craft beer drinkers. I like the addition of extra hops to make this a hoppy RIS, but the other characteristics aren't there as much as I'd like. Yeah, it has a nice body to it, and the roastiness is pleasant, but I guess it's just not as... pungent? As I was hoping it would be. I'd have it again, as it's a very good beer, but there are definitely better options. Still, try it for yourself to experience an unusually hoppy tasting RIS.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Scrapss,4.45,"A: Opaque and dark. Not very active. Thin tan head reduces to a ring. This one has minor legs.  S: Big phenolic malts with roasted chocolate. Raisin, figs and fruit-must notes are very indistinct. Some bready-yeasty notes are hiding in there. Tobacco and vanilla playing and dancing.  T: Big malt bill says HI! Chocolate-malted milk balls and vanilla. Dark fruit and sharp fruit must. Figs. Some minor hop notes like Noble maybe. Almost too subtle when presented with such a huge malt bill.  M: slick, medium-full and SMOOOTHHH all draught long. The carbonation is there where appearance did not say it was present. Creamy. Pungent vanillan/oak breath. Side of tongue has spicy/carbonated activity. Roasty chocolate is very pleasant. It's like chocolate liqueur bon-bons.  O: This is crazy good.

345,1013,Act25,4.33,"Storm King's reviews are all over the map. My guess is because it's highly original, complex, bitter, and high alcohol. It's like storm king itself, a bulbous head around which any weather may come. Image follows: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_King_Mountain_(New_York)  A: Storm King pours black into a pint glass with a mocha-colored head that lasts the length of the session, and leaves much lacing. It's thick and opaque.  S: The nose offers complex aromas of dark roasted malts, fig, syrup, espresso along with notes of alcohol, espresso and floral hops. There's a slight solvent flare which lowered the score for me. Definitely an after dinner stout.  T: The taste follows the smell with myriad flavors of dark roasted malts. There's the very hop bitterness and the brew rides into the satisfying bitter, drying, and longest lingering finish. Still a complex paradox of alcohol/cask like, almost a cognac with prune, fig, fruit, coffee.  M: Definitely full-bodied on the palate with much warming from the alcohol. Outstanding body, wine-like. Best finish.  D: I cannot make my mind up. I need to let it warm. and also return to it. It's more memorable than ten fidy, but still too odd to score higher now. Definitely a must try.

345,1013,Mongrel,3.93,"Enjoyed from bottle to tulip. Visibly thick and viscous with half of finger of khaki head that recedes to a film after a couple minutes. Decent frothy lacing.  Smells cool and hoppy with just a faint whiff of milk chocolate.  Taste is a mirror image of the nose. First impression is cool, piney hops, followed by just a hint of milk chocolate. To me, this beer drinks more like a full bodied black IPA than a stout. It's definitely more of a showcase for the hops than the malts. As the beer warms I can taste some watered down coffee and a little more chocolate, but hops still dominate. There's a semi-sweet caramel center, but on the whole this beer is very dry.  Mouthfeel is nice and frothy and coats the tongue. Very dry. Not as thick in body as I was expecting from the viscous pour.  Overall, this would be a nice entry in some kind of double black IPA category, but as a stout it's a little disappointing and doesn't live up to the hype, in my opinion. Perhaps some time in the cellar would take off the hoppy edge and let the malts shine through a little more.

345,1013,Vonhinx,2.64,"I should start by saying that I am a fan of big malty beers and less fond of overhopping.  Sadly, this beer doesn't stay true to the RIS style or I would be giving it a much better review. This is more of a black IPA with a little extra ABV.  It poured into a standard mug nice and dark with about an inch of light brownhead that didnt last too long.  The smell was the first sign that things were going to be odd. Alcohol smell was expected at over 9 percent. The strong hop smell was a little surprising though. It overwhelmed any malts, which should be the main aroma with this type.  The taste matched the smell. Hops first, then alcohol, then the chocolate/coffee taste you would expect from this type, but hidden deep in the background. The flavor did improve as it warmed up, but not enough for me to ever buy it again.

Smell is good, really good. Lots of dark roasted malts. Plenty of fudgy chocolate and some hints of fresh brewed coffee. After that there is a nice hop aroma, pretty hoppy for a Russian Imperial Sout. Digging it.  Taste is equally as excellent as the smell. There's initially a nice sweetness from the chocolate, it's sort of a milky semi-sweet chocolate flavor. Slight flavors of Coffee or postum but not as strong as the smell. There's some over roasted, not quite burned malty toastiness as well. It's hoppy, but a nice present yet subtle hoppy that meshes really well with the malt flavors.  Mouthfeel is good, pretty much nailed it. GOod carbonation level. Really, really smooth and not much from the 9.1% ABV, wouldn't have expected it. Nice sweet start with a nice fairly gentle bitter finish. Everything meshes really, really, really well together. Everything is well balanced and super drinkable.

345,1013,Kuaff,4.49,"From a 12-oz. bottle in my cellar it goes, into the snifter. Do I really still need to say it? I'm thinking I should just put a note somewhere on my profile that reads ""all reviewed beers are served at cellar temperature in a snifter, unless otherwise noted."" I mean I say it at the start of almost EVERY review. JEEZ... But I digress.  The Storm King has an abnormally big (for an imperial stout) three-finger, light brown cloud of a head that has some awesome retention. And it's dark enough to be called black.  Right when I cracked the bottle open, the aroma flew out like a hurricane gale and I could smell it immediately. Roasty charred earth, coffee, chai black tea, some hops, and some citric fruitiness. And there's also a delicious milk chocolate aroma. An eclectic mix. It smells great, though! The black tea in there is something I haven't smelled in any other beer.  First sip and I'm hit with an immediate zing (like lightning) of bitter hops, but then a ponderous, smoky roastiness imposes itself on my palate. Then a (tasty) clash of coffee and citric fruits ensues. The finish kind of oscillates between the two sides of this ale - the typical (for a RIS) malty chocolate accompanied by roasted maltiness, and the atypical DIPA mix of bitter hops and fruity citrus. In other words, it's very much like a black ale, or what some call a black DIPA. I'd call it either a hoppy RIS, or a malty black ale... it's kinda in between the two.  Medium viscosity and moderate carbonation. Feels kind of thin for the style, but nothing feels wrong or out of place.  A very fine ale. It's not the most chocolaty of stouts I've had, and although chocolatiness is pretty much my number one desire when I'm drinking an imperial stout, this one has other attributes. The best thing it has going for it is how unique and distinctive it is, whereas some other awesome craft beers might not blaze much new territory and just follow established guidelines (often REALLY WELL, though). Anyway, I can appreciate both approaches. And I gotta say again... the smell, what with that nearly exact rendition of a chai aroma, is someting pretty special.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

345,1013,Cyrion,4.32,"Poured into a tumbler that is clean and dry, which is more than I can say for myself. No date available, which also pertains to myself.  Appearance: Dark, opaque brown, practically black. The one inch head is a dark tan and begins fading almost immediately, leaving a decent ring of lacing that keeps me company during my drinking bout.  Aroma: Chocolate, caramel...perhaps a bit of fruit that is grapey more than citric. In spite of this, I cannot use the word 'raisiny' for this stout's aroma.  Taste: Malt and chocolate up front, competing for my attention. A bitterness is detectable, shy and reclusive, but this is merely the coffee roast and the orange hops that I failed to detect on the nose. The four flavors- malt, chocolate, coffee, and orange work together in an easy harmony to create a delicious depth to the stout. About one third of the way through the bottle, the alcohol introduces itself very subtly.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and creamy. A slight drying is felt as the beer goes down, but this is the alcohol, which is well disguised, considering the ABV.  Overall: Friendly and extremely drinkable, despite the forbidding name. Unlike some other reviewers, I had no problem with the presence of the hops, which I assumed would appear at some point anyway. A tasty chocolate dessert, working well as the final drink of the day. I will seek this out again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Stevedore,4.29,"12oz bottle, from sometime in 2012 and has been sitting in my fridge since, poured into a Goose Island half-pint glass today 7/19/2013.  Aroma: A good bit of deep dark malt sweetness- molasses, chocolate, mocha, burnt sugar. And of course a ton of hops up in here.. I want to call it floral, but perhaps there is a bit of citrus also. I could swear I smell some dark fruits in here too- ripe blackberries even. Complex and pungent nose.  Colour: Pours a very dark brown, not far from black, with a dense 1cm tan head that dissipates slowly into a thin film and collar. It already leaves lacing as the head recedes, and leaves more as the beer slowly disappears into my stomach. Very prototypical of a good Imperial Stout.  Flavour: Its heavier on the malts here than the hops. Plenty of mocha, molasses, a little bit of roasted dark chocolate. Showcases the dark malts here very well. The hoppiness in the nose is more subdued here as it seems to be replaced by a straight up roasty bitterness. This beer has a great roasted malt presence for sure.  Mouthfeel: Thicker end of medium, not quite motor oil but it feels so smooth and creamy. It's easy to drink, but it can certainly be a sipper. Not much alcohol presence which is good. Aftertaste is mostly a roast malt bitterness with a tinge of blackberries which finishes a bit dry, but not overly so.  Overall: Tasty imperial stout that showcases both dark & roast malts along with a good helping of hops. Historically this beer has been considered to be one of the best imperial stouts, and I can see how it came to be considered so highly yet it has become a bit underrated in the present day and age. It is a very good beer and I am glad it is readily available. Highly recommend if you've seen it on the shelf a lot but keep passing it over due to its availability (I am guilty of this too).",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

345,1013,Immortale25,4.3,"Poured into a snifter. Bottleneck says Enjoy By Nov 28 2017.  A- Pours an impenetrable black color with a 3/4 inch dark tan head that retains very well before eventually reducing to a thick ring around the edge of the glass and a tiny bubbly patch of surface foam. Semi-resilient lacing leaves a thick sudsy ring behind on the glass.  S- Sweet aroma that shows more hops and fruit characteristics than it does roasted malt. Actually has a chocolate orange type of thing going on. There's also some mocha, caramel and a hint of booze. Great stuff.  T- The flavor is more straightforward with a heavy dark roasted malt leading to a hoppy bitterness mid-palate and finishing with some chocolate and char. The alcohol is pretty subdued allowing all the other flavors to move around and show off their combined complexity.  M- Semi-creamy but also somehow a bit chalky and dry as well as sharp from the hops. Medium carbonation with a thick and chewy body. So much going on.  O- A great go-to RIS when you're browsing the beer aisles.

Smell is roasted malt, coffee, chocolate and a lot of hops for a stout. Very intriguing. Taste wasn't a surprise given the nose - roasted malt, coffee, a little more chocolate, and a slight bite of citrus hops. The mouthfeel on this one is at a different level than most beers I've tried - extremely thick and creamy, and hefty enough to carry everything that's going on in this beer. Like others have mentioned, there was a slight chalkiness to it, but nothing too significant.  A delicious beer all around, but one will typically be enough for a sitting. Also, I drank what I know is a fairly flavorful porter afterward and it tasted like water - the hops and coffee flavor of Storm King linger, so don't follow it with something comparatively meek!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

It's sweet to start, a bit cloying and syrupy, but the the bitterness of the beer is was lingers on the palate. It coats and lingers for a while after the beer is gone.

345,1013,bobtopich,4.83,"I appreciate the dedication of those that can write such detailed reviews. I will apologize up front for not going in that direction. I am simply going to say that right now, Storm King is my favorite beer.  Since the summer, I have been sampling a variety of stouts and porters. Had the pleasure of hitting up Deschutes in Portland this summer and enjoyed their Black Butte Porter and their Nitro Obsidian Stout. Can't find them here in Pittsburgh or I'm sure I'd enjoy more of them.  Some others have been Old Dominion Oak Barrel Stout, Bell's Expedition Stout, Kona Pipeline Porter, Wolaver's Oatmeal Stout, Rogue Chocolate Stout, Sam Adams Maple Pecan Porter, and more.  Storm King just tastes right for me. I'm not sure about all of the malts and hops and whathaveyous but it's just tasty. I love to pour it into a snifter and let it warm naturally. It has a great aroma and is very heavy and full-bodied. Like Lays chips, there are times that I can enjoy just one. Tomorrow watching the Final Four will not be one of those evenings!  Bell's Expedition is equal...the difference in price will keep me coming back to Storm King. If you haven't tried it I will tell you to try a six pack and hopefully enjoy it as I do.

Chocolate seems to be muted in this. 3.75  Taste-hops come out a lot stronger than I would expect for this style. Citrus right up front,roasted coffee also stands out at first. Milk chocolate brings out the sweetness. Really surprised how hoppy this is and it's not exactly a good thing.

It's too bitter and just when you think you are going to get some sweetness it get muddled together with more bitterness.

345,1013,Jugs_McGhee,3.8,"9.10% ABV confirmed. 12 fl oz brown glass bottle with standard pressure cap served into a 5 oz taster glass in me gaff in low altitude Los Feliz, Los Angeles, California. Reviewed from notes taken about a month ago.  A: Pours a one finger beige-khaki colour head. Nice cream and thickness. Pretty good retention (~2-3 minutes). Body colour is a solid dark ruby-black. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show. Nontransparent. Opaque. Right on the money for an imperial stout.  Sm: Chocolate/cacao dusting. Caramel. Dark malts. Chocolate malt. Cream. Mocha. Hazelnut. Miky. A moderate strength aroma. No yeast character or alcohol is detectable. Good for the style. Appealing. I'm excited to try it.  T: Chocolate. Some bitterness from the chocolate too. Cacao. Caramel. Mocha. Cream. Dark malts. Balanced, if imperfect. Not a whole lot of complexity here, but it's damn tasty. I like it. Milky, with light hazelnut. Burnt - a characteristic I quite like here. Not great depth of flavour, but the flavour that does come through is enjoyable.  Mf: Smooth and wet. Good thickness. Good carbonation. Suits the flavour profile well.  Dr: Drinkable and enjoyable. Hides its ABV well. I could drink another; this is tasty stuff. An impressive beer from Victory. I quite like it. I'd definitely get this again. Exceeded expectations.  B  *** 12/10/16: I've wanted to revisit this beer for years, so I picked up a 4-pack in Brooklyn for $10.99 USD.  Pours a classic khaki tan colour head. Creamy and soft with an impressive 10+ minute retention - not too shabby for a 9.10% ABV brew. Body is a true to style opaque black. A nice coating of lacing clings to the sides of the glass as the head recedes.  Aroma brings a lovely mix of potent roasted barley, charred malts, burnt sugars, chocolate (malt), black patent malt, and espresso-redolent bitter roasty coffee grounds. No traces of booze at all. Contrary to most imperial stouts, this does feature some hop aromatics - primarily floral. Aromatic intensity is average for the style. Suggests a roasty dessert beer more in line with a Russian imperial stout than an American imperial stout per today's style conventions. I dig the commitment to roast .  Taste: Classic imperial stout flavour. Roasted barley harmonizes with specialty chocolate malt and dark malt (schwarz malt/black patent malt) sweetness to good effect, with burnt sugars and charred malty harshness bringing a leveling balancing bitterness to all that malty sweetness in tandem with a surprisingly forward floral hop presence. The result is a beer that hangs in delicate balance in spite of its big bold flavours, and a beer that in hindsight was evidently the blueprint for almost every imperial stout that's followed (American or otherwise).  Showing up fellow tried-and-true classics like North Coast's brilliant Old Rasputin or Great Divide's now downtrodden Yeti, Storm King is a titan of a beer in terms of its inspiration and effect on contemporary expressions of the style, but can still run with the best of the contemporary big dogs. Hearkening back to an era when balance and harmony of flavour were enough and you didn't need the excesses of vanilla bean bourbon barrel aged coffee espresso marshmallow fudge explosion (or whatever extreme adjunct flavour the kids are deeming in vogue) to brew a good beer, Storm King is a must-try for any discerning drinker and a cornerstone of American craft beer. Many may dismiss it now as the worse-for-wear crotchety old grandfather of imperial stouts (or skip buying it because it isn't part of a limited release), but for my money it was a hell of a beer when I got into beer and it's a hell of a beer now.  Yet, there's room for improvement in terms of intricacy of flavour. With such a delicate balance already in play, it's hard to imagine being able to add more vivid deep flavours without ruining it, yet other imperial stouts have succeeded.  It just works, ladies and gentlemen.  B+ / VERY GOOD",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,4DAloveofSTOUT,4,"poured into tulip glass.  Appearance: black bodied beer with two fingers of brown head. spotty lace. beer drops to a thin cap  Smell: roasty and bitter. Chocolate and a hop heavy stout(mostly pine and citrus hops).  Taste: roasty malts, black licorice, and milk chocolates. Pine and citrusy hops hit pretty hard in the middle of the beer pretty much knocking out the malt profile with large amounts of hoppy bitterness. Finishing with a moderate hop bitterness that all about resinous pine cone and grapefruit rind.  Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer with low end of moderate carbonation. This beer feels just a little thin for the abv, but its not too far from where it needs to be. Carbonation feel just right for this beer. The beer feels a little creamy and silky. Smooth beer with no booze noted. The hops dry the beer out just a little bit.  Overall: This is a nice beer by Victory. I think this beer would be really nice after about 2 years of cellar time to allow those aggressive hops to settle down. I think this beers' hop profile just wipes out the malts of the beer and this beer has a complex malt flavor profile that deserves more attention. I would say that this beer would taste best after the hops are faded with aging and it would allow the malts show themselves off more.

A: Poured an inky black color, with absolutely no light passing through whatsoever. The head was mocha-colored, webby, sticky, splotchy, and quite robust.  S: In the center of this malty, dark beverage, there is a rather aggressive fruit component. Seriously, I got some pineapple and grapefruit wrapped up inside a malted milk ball.  T: Very bitter and cocoa-like, with the citrus playing second fiddle. Here recently, I had a brew on-tap at FFFs call ""Blot Out the Sun"" there and this one reminds me of that one, only not quite so assertive (or good). I definitely got Victory's signature ""yeasty"" taste profile in there.  M: Not extremely thick, but still heavy enough, therefore the drinkability on this was through the roof once one take the ABV into consideration. Ridiculous lacing and pretty high on the carbonation ladder considering the style and octane.

Taste: Starts with dark malt and a very light citrus bitterness. Transitions into a middle section that gives more moderate bitterness levels and then a charred coffee and chocolate finish. The roasted bitterness sticks around on the palate for a long while though the 9.1% ABV is never noticeable. As it warms a little there are notes of fig and dried apricot in the flavor. A slight sweetness also develops with the slow rise in temperature. A tad underwhelming when all is said and done.  Mouthfeel: Just above medium in body which I tend to consider a little on the thin side in terms of the style.

Look: Poured a super black color with some dirty brown tinges along the edges. Initial head was 2-fingers of a frothy tan foam. Some spotty lacing, but nothing too crazy. Carbonation level seemed sort of low.  Smell: I could smell the hops right after cracking open the bottle. Sweet juniper and a sharp sassafras hop note. Also a roasted coffee character was behind the hoppy bouquet.  Taste: First up was an herbal hoppiness that gave way to a coffee-like bitterness. The bitterness continued into the finish where some malt sweetness seemed to set in. The aftertaste was fairly dry with the hops returning with that sharp resin quality.  I would consider this beer more of an Imperial American Black Ale instead of a RIS. The use of hops basically dominated both the aroma and the palate.

A hop kick up front that quickly dissolves into a much more sweet taste. Good.  M - Fairly smooth in-mouth. A little carbonation does not disturb the sweet flavor. A little aftertaste, which is pleasant.  Summary - A pretty good stout. A little scary to start off - the hops aroma and the kick at the start of the sip had me worried, but it really balances out the more you drink it. I enjoyed not having such a roasted kick as in some other stouts. Enjoyable and powerful, I'd drink it again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,MickeyBeer,4.19,"12 oz bottle poured into a pint  A- Pours a dark black with about a finger and a half of light brown creamy head. When held up to light it is essentially opaque, only letting a little bit of light in around the edges. Left some beautiful lacing on the glass.  S-Aromas of coffee and chocolate. A sweet malty smell with a hint of alcohol.  T- A delicious chocolaty coffee flavor with roasted malts. Very sweet with some hop balance. Aftertaste is dominated by a roasted/smokey taste with a bit of coffee.  M- Full bodied and light in carbonation. Smooth all the way through. Has a decent amount of chewiness to it like a good RIS should.  O- This is a great Imperial Stout that I have been drinking for years. It is very tasty and has never disappointed me. It is full of complex flavors, has a great mouthfeel, and packs nice punch at 9.1% ABV. Grab a six pack if you get a chance.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,CloudStrife,4.19,"12oz bottle poured into a snifter. Enjoy by Apr 09 2017.  A: Pours a dark black with a 1.5 finger sort of puffy light tan head. Sticks around for a few minutes dwindling to a thin covering and leaving a spot or two of lace. Light gets through about 1/8"" of the beer when held up to the light.  S: Roasted malt and a fermented dark fruit characteristic. Chocolate is also pretty strong. A fair amount of hop bitterness. Just a hint of booze.  T: Starts off with a mild stoutish flavor and a decent hop bittering kicks in. Some alcohol taste combines with a raisin/fig flavor in the middle. Real highlight in the aftertaste with a strong roasted malt. Coffee comes through pretty strong too.  M: Medium bodied stout with a good velvety or creamy mouthfeel. Fairly clean finish, isnt sticky or anything. Warming but the booze isnt too hot.  Overall a very impressive RIS. Although its no longer in the top 100 beers of fame, I am glad it was still on my list to try. Would recommend to any stout fan.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Lemke10,4.28,"This pours a dark brown color with a foamy, light brown head. The scent is very robust filled with malts, toffee, coffee, and just a touch of hops. The flavor is rich and bold beyond belief for such a reasonable 6pk price. There are lots of roasted malts and caramel malts in the mix as well a crisp bitter finish. This is the way to make a good, complex brew at a reasonable price. It’s a “Victory” to say the least!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,LinusBohman,3.98,"Thank you adrock7309 for including this as an extra in our trade!  Served into a snifter at room temperature.  A: Black as the dark side of the moon. The head is very fluffy, almost a little jellyish in it's behaviour, cocao coloured it is. The king quickly loses his crown though but leaves plenty of lacing on the sides of the glass and a thin blanket of foam on top of the black liquid underneath. No apparent bubbles.  S: Wonderful smell! I get chocalates, coffeebeans, dark bread and wort.  T: The first tastes that comes to mind are dark chocolate and coffee. The hops have nice combination of bitterness and fruityness. The aftertaste is bitter.  M: I perceive the body to be a little thin for a RIS. It's quite bubbly and dry on the palate.  O: Delightful beer that has a nice combination of dark roasted malts and generous amounts of hops. The lack of body brings down the score a bit but I would very well like to drink this one again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,KFBR392,3.46,"Appearance: Poured a very dark brown stout that was pitch black when attempting to see through the glass. Carbonation was very present throughout, probably the most I've seen in this level of a stout. Appropriate amounts of lacing stuck to the glass as this beer was drank. Enjoyed out of a snifter.  Smell: The aroma gave a mysterious mask for this beer. The hops are in the front but the roasted malt character is buried. You can tell other characters of this beer are trying to burst through in the aroma but cannot overcome the hops.  Taste: An incredibly powerful hop attack out of this stout. I feel like the hop character is trying to be like that of Nightstalker from Goose Island but to me is not on the same level. The aroma leads the drinker to expect a creamy hop lacing but comes off as over the top bitter. The darkness of this beer is hidden. Very little malt or coffee/espresso presence in this beer.  Mouthfeel: The sticky hops hand around for a long time with this beer. The creamy texture is there but at the same time leaves me wanting some more. Hops create a dryness which clings to the palette  Overall: Not a memorable stout. Its direction seems lost on me. I had high expectations for this beer and it did not live up to them. Worth a try but for the price tag I would recommend many other Stouts.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

345,1013,ColdWaffles,4.06,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a standard pint glass. Kinda always surprised me that this makes it to 12 oz bottles. I've had this on draft before too. Russian Imperial isn't usually my jam, but I'll leave that at the door.  Appearance: Pure black with a nice huge tan head that took a long while to die.  Smell: Citrus, maybe anise/licorice hops, sweet malts, alcohol on the end. Not bad, but it always surprises me how much I pick up the hops here.  Taste: I guess it always surprises me how much I pick up the hops here too. Very much everything I picked up in the smell. So, citrus, anise/licorice, sweet malts and a decent amount of alcohol on the end, but nothing big enough to turn you away.  Mouthfeel: Stylistically, probably a little lighter, but not mistaken for anything less than medium to heavy. Light carbonation, but what is there helps me drink it from a more casual perspective. Draft was tough for me, personally.  This is an oddly hoppy stout. It manages to hide its strength impressively, but that comes out a little more in the bottle. I remember it being almost... dangerously hidden on draft. Not really a beer I need to drink more than a few times a year.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,d1ckvanswype,4.15,"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass.  A: Aggressive pour results in a finger and a half of espresso crema head on top of a pitch black liquid. Great lacing, this beer has some serious legs and glass-staining potential.  S: Surprisingly hop-forward, juicy bitter citrus (limes, tangerines), darkly roasted caramel, sweet, bready malts.  T: Wow this is a really hoppy stout! A hit of juicy tangerine-lime at first, swallowed up by the briefest sweet malty caramel and tons of aggressive hop/roast bitterness. Somewhat medicinal/asprin-y in the aftertaste, which builds with each sip.  M: They do an excellent job of hiding the alcohol (9+%ABV!), which only shows itself in a slight warming burn in the back of the throat, but make no mistake, even with great, smooth even carbonation it sits like motor oil, with a hoppy, resin-y stickiness.  O: Not exactly what I think of when I think ""stout"", but I suppose since it's Imperialized the extreme hoppiness has its place. I wouldn't reach for it if I was looking for something with more roast and less bitterness, but it does come across very satisfying. Successful contender for one of the best, more character-forward stouts I've had.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Smells of chocolate and coffee, roasted malt and sweetness. Pretty standard RIS smell. Taste is spot-on for an RIS; big roasted malt, coffee and bitter chocolate, with lesser notes of sweetness and some crisp hops cleaning up the aftertaste a bit. Mouthfeel is clean but very full, nicely done. Overall, a great RIS. To-style, balanced, and simple.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

T: Light sweetness and moderate bitterness. Mostly hops then some roasted malt.  M: Medium bodied with soft carbonation. Not warm going down, but sticky.  O: This Russian Imperial was very hop forward and lacked the roasted complexities I appreciate so much in other Russian Imperials.

The head is Brown sugar in color; breaks up nicely with some thick lacing. Heavy aroma notes of coffee and malt. Smaller notes of dark chocolate and prunes. Color is thick and dark. I cannot see through this beer even when holding it up to a light. This is a heavily bodied beer that is guaranteed to satisfy stout lovers. Flavor notes are coffee, dark chocolate and but a bit of the alcohol comes through.  Conclusion: An excellent stout, one of the best in the world.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,FreshHawk,4.11,"A - Very dark mahogany/nearly black color. Average sized, smooth, creamy, fluffy, cafe colored head. Good retention leaving a nice lacing.  S - Enticing aroma. Citrus and piny hops compete with dark chocolate and sweet fudge for my attention. The bitterness of the hops and the bitter roasted malt aromas meld together wonderfully at the end of the whiff. Lively and mouth-watering aroma.  T - Starts with a slightly bitter citrus flavor with a touch of pine. Touch of mild coffee that persists as an undertone flavor. Some dark chocolate flavors along with a slight creamy and fudge-like sweetness. Finishes with a dark chocolate and earthy bitterness. Nice balance.  M - Medium body. Average carbonation (maybe slightly above average for the style). Creamy with a slight bite and tingle on the finish.  D - Easy to drink beer. Alcohol is well hidden. Flavors meld very well together (especially the hoppy and roasted bitterness). I had no problem finishing the bottle and enjoyed doing so.  Notes: Very hoppy stout; still didn't seem like a Black IPA to me though. Flavors meld very well together. Great mix of hops and stout flavors. Everything just worked for me.

345,1013,kaseydad,3.95,"Shocked to find this at a local Whole Foods....as the Storm King has been elusive for some time.  Pint glass pour and I am met with black/dark brown ale with a decent size brown (not even beige) foamy head. Lotsa lacing.  The aroma is roasty, toasty dark malts and a good amount of leather. Mild fruit in the background. Smoke. Light caramel.  The taste is bitter, roasted coffee, hoppy, bittersweet chocolate. Slightly boozy as the tummy warming sensation is present. Delicate dark fruit aftertaste with more bitterness and leather.  The mouthfeel is hoppier than I was expecting. Not bad, but distracts somewhat.  Overall I will say this has improved from the ""fresher"" bottle I consumed when purchasing the six pack a few months ago. The fresher version was fruitier while it has integrated to a roasty beast with minimal fruit hints as it ages. I prefer the aging version.

345,1013,Triglycerides,3.97,"A: Black with a mocha head which leaves nice lacing. Definitely true to RIS form. Leaves some lacing along the side of the glass.  S: Great citrus hop profile among the strong notes of roasted malt and molasses. Wee bit of booziness hangs in the background. Definitely a lot hoppier than some of the other RIS I've smelled, but it's a really nice change.  T: First a big wave of heavily roasted malt with some dark roasted coffee lingering about. Finishes dry with a piney hop flavor, which mellows out a bit as it warms in lieu of a more balanced (but still rather hop forward) play between the chocolate malt and hops.  M: Pretty light and creamy(fluffy?) for a RIS. Drinkable with a just right level of carbonation.  O: Another great offering by Victory. Packs quite a bit of flavor for a fairly nice price point. Seek this out if you are a fan of RISes.

Fine beer for a hardcore night - tend to like my beers a bit smoother these days.  Best by: 12/10/15 - Reviewed 24FEB11 - 3.5/4/4/3/3.5-3.78 A: Pours a deep brown with limited translucency which illustrates at the edges only with tilt. Single finger, dark latte head dissipates quickly and retains a thin sheet of the same. Lacing is limited. S: Very resinous hop nose cloaks the chocolate malts, coffee, and lightly sweet backbone. This combo allows and convinces me the beer is both ready to be consumed now, or can stand the test of time in the cellar. T: Again, the hops are immediate in this as they were in the nose. Almost a thickened ABA. Great coffee, cocoa, black charred malts again in the backbone. M: thicky, sticky, tacky, lip-smacky. Resonates with heavy body and moderate carbonation. Maybe a hare more spritely than I would prefer in the style, but nonetheless, above average. D: Very good beer, I venture to say I would enjoy it even more with a year or two on it.

Made a one finger chocolaty thick head with really tiny bubbles that died off relatively fast. Lacing is average on this one.  S - On the nose I get creamy bitter chocolate right away, some black licorice and a bit of hops in the back end. I almost feel like I'm sniffing a dark creamy chocolate bar.  T - I get the bitterness from the hops right away with the nice chocolate malt, coffee, toffee, cream; in the back this leaves a lingering after taste that has an astringent flavor which I believe is from the hop variety used.  M - This brew i full bodied with a soft pillowy feel not to mention a bitter bite from the hops and a prickle on your tongue from the carbonation. Wow a lot going on here in the mouth, Amazing!  O - A really nice sipping RIS that is to be desired at the end of a cold night. If you like RIS you need to at least try a bottle of this, with its uniquely great qualities. I will definitely be cellaring some of these to see if that astringent flavor fades, will update wit an aged version in the future.

The smell (for me) was mainly alcohol. I'm sure there are many more subtle aromas present, but the alchol just seemed to overpower them. Taste is toffe, molasses, caramel, licorice, dark chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, and a warm finish with a little bit of alcohol present. That's the part that throws me. The alcohol is very up front in the smell, but well hidden in the taste. Mouthfeel is pretty good. It's thick but not syrupy and not a lot of carbonation.

Head retention is low. Dissipates quite easily. Excellent lacing, which sticks together with the beer.  Smell is as rich and complex as it can get., not literally but still awesome. Smells from at least six inches away and you get the good feeling of what you are going to drink. I really like beers with such an inviting smell. Smell is the foreplay before the real stuff. Everything in there, roasted malts, some coffee, hell ya much hops and alcohol. Hops are much more IPA like. Earthy, some grassy and a little piney. Very upfront hop aroma. Roasted barleys are little subdued. Tinges of coffee but not a lot.  Taste is very much like nose. Very hoppy and bitter upfront. Not IPA/DIPA bitter, but yes good enough bitterness for a stout, so much so that you do not feel the roasted coffee stout like taste for a good time. Malts are very subdued and sweetness is extremely well mixed with its bitter hops and presents a distinct flavor. I like it, very much. It is warm, not due to malts, but due to its alcohol. Leaves a dry taste in the mouth.  Mouth feel is full bodied. Heavy, you feel it very well in your mouth. Carbonation is mild and the beer does not hurt unless you are put off by hops.

345,1013,Converge,4.1,"355ml bottle poured into a 16oz tulip.  A - As expected, this brew pours black as night into the glass with a thick, creamy mocha head. A touch lighter than what I usually see for the style. Decent head retention, with some sticky webs of lacing branching up the glass.  S - Surprisingly hoppy upfront, with earthy hops being quite assertive. An inviting base of charred malt and roasty coffee notes, complimented nicely by cocoa, anise, and an unapologetic boozy character. Not exactly a complex nose, but a very well rounded, yet still aggressive aroma.  T - Monster flavor here. Deep charred malt and coffee upfront, with a slight touch of sweetness and cocoa. Finishes with a pronounced alcoholic character, as well as some assertive hops, resinous and earthy. Notes of booze and anise linger in the aftertaste. There's an odd crispness to it that doesn't quite jive with what I look for in a good RIS. The roasty character is certainly present, but not as bold as I prefer. The hops really take over the finish here, and mixed with the alcoholic character, make for a slightly abrasive flavor profile overall. Not bad by any means, but not my ideal imperial stout.  M - Thick and creamy, like a good stout should be. A touch more carbonation that I prefer, however. Finishes slightly dry, with a peculiar crispness. Fairly sticky.  D - A great brew in what I would consider to be my favorite style.

345,1013,theHoff77,4.17,"Poured into a snifter  A - Black in color and barely had a dark khaki head even with an aggressive pour. Spotty lacing.  S - Smells sweeter than I was expecting. Malts, coffee, and toffee.  T - Taste is on the roasted end for imperial stouts. Malts, coffee, and dark chocolate. Upon first sip to after taste it changes quite a bit with flavor. Starts off malty and roasty and ends up being more coffee and bitter at the end.  M - Medium body, slightly bitter, sweet, and well balanced.  O - It was alright, but am glad I had it. I was expecting it to be really sweet from the smell but the taste is quite a contrast. As far as a RIS that is more affordable this was good, and I think I'd rate it above Old Rasputin for personal preference. I wouldn't go out of my way to buy it, but if it was on tap somewhere I'd go for it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

S - nothing here really. I don't get a ton of character, maybe a little malt, but no alcohol or hops (the bottle really boasts the hops for some reason).  T - I definitely enjoy the taste. Very malty bite at the beginning, but it finishes with delightful coffee notes. Deep, drinkinable.  M - nothing special here. The 9% doesn't really hang out in the mouth, but the MF is a little empty in comparison with the taste.  O - I like it.

Clean bittering hops are present making this beer well balanced and very tasty. M: Lower medium body.

Smells of licorice, chocolate, coffee, anise, and some big hops for the style. I pick up on some faint nutty, spicy notes as well.  Very deep, roasted barley characteristics... it borders on burnt. This isn't helped by the big hop bitterness. Definite coffee notes. The black licorice notes are there towards the back. It's definitely a bit hot but not as bad as some other 9+% stouts I've had before.  Mouthfeel is nice and full, well carbonated, and pretty smooth (minus the alcohol and hop bitterness).  Overall, a pretty decent imperial stout. Having had the various Founders, BCBS, Darkness, Black Note, etc., this one has a lot to prove.

A crisp, almost metallic malt. Slight fruit, slight chocolate. Doesnt really smell like a stout to be honest.  T- The first thing I get is a slight bitterness from the hops. Followed by a citrus fruit flavor. The malts in this beer are quite strange. There is almost a crisp pilsner malt, a very crisp flavor profile. There is a unique wood flavor that really reminds me of a cigar box. This beer finished up with roasted malts that linger on the tongue.  M- Big beer but the flavors aren't too overbearing. slight alcohol burn. Roasty finish.  O- This is a good RIS.

Smell: Very hoppy smelling for a stout. Balanced with the hops is plenty of malt and chocolate.  Taste: An absolutely wonderful Russian Imperial Stout. Lots of chocolate/coffee/espresso flavors. But cutting across that is a burst of citrusy hops that creates an enjoyable balance.  Mouthfeel: Incredibly full and thick. This is beyond creamy in the mouth.  Overall: This is by far one of my favorites of this style.

Smell - Ooh! Lovely smell. Reminds me a bit of Shakespeare stout. Notes of smoke, deep roasted malt and citrus hops. Slight sourness.  Taste -Deep roasted malts with coffee and chocolate notes with just the right amount of peat smokiness. Hits very briefly on black liquorice and then, unfortunately, there's a a lot of funky soapiness near the finish that I'm not too fond of. It's hard to overlook, and it builds the faster you drink.  Mouthfeel - Full bodied, and silky smooth. But again there's a slick, soapy feeling that comes in even on the mouthfeel.  Overall - So close to near perfection, but so far away. The hand shows four aces, but the soapy character in this stout revels nothing but a two-pair. Disappointing.

Solid three fingers of tan creamy head that slowly recedes into a thin creamy layer. Leaves a lot of lacing.  Smell: A very deep, roasty, and fairly sweet aroma. Dark roasted malts with big hints of chocolate, coffee, burnt caramel, chocolate milk, toffee, and dark bread. Quite a bit of molasses and burnt sugar. Big hop presence for a stout with some quite noticeable hints of earthy, herbal hops and a little spicy pine resin. Also some subtle dark fruit with hints of raisin, fig, and prunes. A very rich and thick smell.  Taste: Like it smells, big sweet roasted malts with a nice hop bitterness. Dark roasted malts with a big taste of dark chocolate, burnt toast, coffee, chocolate milk, caramel, toffee, molasses, and some burnt sugars. Nice undertones of sweet dark fruits including raisins, prune, and fig. A fairly sharp hop presence with a big taste of earthy hops. Also some spicy hops. The hops do a nice job of balancing some of the sweetness of the malts and sugar. A really big and good taste.  Mouthfeel: A fairly heavy body with a moderate level of carbonation. Very creamy, chewy, and somewhat slick. Hops have a drying effect towards the finish. Alcohol heat is fairly low.  Overall: A really great Imperial Stout.

The coffee taste is more pronounced in the flavor than in the nose, and some dark fruits also come out, with some nice toasted malts and earthy, floral hops. There's a little malt sweetness in the front. Finishes with a nice hop bite that mixes with bitter bakers chocolate, with just a trace of alcohol warmth.  Mouthfeel is pretty on point for the style.

Medium carbonation.  Overall:  Victory has created a aggressive toasty, sweet, bitter imperil stout.  This Beer drinks like an IPA with all the roasty malt sweetness.

Good retention and lacing, but it is quite light for a stout.  Smell - Hops galore. The hops cover up most of the stout. A fair bit of coffee emerges behind. The hops come off as rather vegetal.  Taste - The taste is extremely hoppy, but markedly better than the nose. Not as vegetal. Still hoppy, but more chocolate and coffee come through. Not much of the boozy comes through.  Mouthfeel - Thin. Quite thin. Not boozy, but exceedingly bitter. The aftertaste is hops, not stout.  Overall - It's not bad, but it's so aggressively hopped that it's lost.

Smells of booze, anise, and burnt malt  Tastes: light aromatic hops, charcoal, anise, and a smooth boozy finish.  Mouthfeel: heavy, and elixir-like.  Overall, this is a swell beer that is less booze-forward than Old Rasputin. Although this is not as sensational as Stone's RIS, this comes in as a close second.

Smell: Subdued roasty malt, bitter chocolate, maybe some coffee.  Taste: Really hope forward. Makes for a combination of bitter chocolate and espresso. Balanced with a very roasted maltiness. Hop bitterness lingers and mixes with the malt bill to give a raw cocoa.  Mouthfeel: Rather light for the numerous flavors that come out. Slightest alcohol presence as it warms, if at all.

Today, I realize that the flavor is much deeper than just the char, but it's still one of the most straight-up burnt I've ever tasted. It's seriously the taste of burnt popcorn, drizzled with some dark chocolate.

The taste is strong and roasty. Can taste some bitter coffee and dark fruits. Also a strong hop character that makes this one interesting. Gives it a slight citrus character.

The smell is rather faint but features roasted notes with a touch of fruit and alcohol. The taste is way better than i was led to believe by the smell, maybe my nose isn't working today. The roasted malts are nicely balanced by the bitterness of the hops, followed by the taste of fruit and alcohol. Really yummy.  Overall this is almost my perfect imperial stout.

345,1013,brureview,4.53,"Updated review 8/23/14  It's been over two years I've had this beer. After drinking it tonight, I will be drinking it more often. Tonight's tasting was in a snifter. It's a preferable glass for the style and better than a British pint glass. I actually tried the beer in both glasses and I prefer the snifter. This time I got more licorice notes, fruit, chocolate, and very dark roasted malt. I'm not sure if the recipe is changed but I notice a lot more nuances since I tasted it last. It's a singular approach to the style. .... 7/11/12  Poured in a pint glass.  I was pleasantly surprised by this beer. I saw a review of it on youtube, and decided to buy it. It's relatively inexpensive.  It pours a beautiful deep coffee color. A wonderful lemon-coffee smell. The mouth feel has nice carbonation.  The taste is deep coffee-espresso, which is enhanced by warming. There is a slight bitterness; otherwise, the finish is quite balanced.  Overall, a wonderful beer, and not expensive.

345,1013,BedetheVenerable,4,"Presentation: 12oz brown pop top, cool label, best by March 11, 2014. Picked this one up on our honeymooon in 2009, before we could get it locally. Been holding onto it in not the most ideal conditions, so I figured tonight I'd give it a try. Poured into my Chimay goblet.  Appearane: Black as sin itself; this is one of the most beautiful obsidian brews I've seen in a long time. A fluffy light tan head sticks around nicely.  Smell: Nice mix of malt, juicy dark molasses, fruity American hops (though at this point this isn't particularly citrusy anymore)and just a hint of burnt malt. Overall, pretty nice!  Taste: This is certainly less hop-forward than the only other time I had it (which was quite a bit fresher) but there's still a strong hop presence. It's fruity/American but again, any citrus notes (which I think I remember from the fresher sample) have faded now. This really shows a nice blend between fruity hops, sweet (but not cloying/heavy, and lacking the metallic notes I generally don't like) molasses, and bit of mellow, dry roasted malt on the finish. Not a ton of depth, but this is really, really nice. Strong, clean, firm bitterness. Mild, pleasant, warming alcohol burn.  Mouthfeel: Medium/full.  Overall: This was described by the head brewer of Victory as somewhere between a black IPA and and a well-attenuated RIS. Well-attenuated, yes, but certainly at this point in its life not a black IPA. What we have here is a really tasty, bold, but somewhat balanced (between alcohol, hops, malt) American-style Imperial Stout with a bit more emphasis on the hops than is typical. I dunno if this still sells for around $12-13 a sixer but, if it does, this wouldn't be at all bad to pick one up every couple of years to let the bottles age.

Smell: Tiny bit boozy, grapes + fruity esters upon swirling. Some citrus hops in there as well.  Taste: Strong roasted malts, espresso, strong bitter finish at the end with some pine and citrus. Alcohol notes towards the end of the sip as well, but muted. Very much on the bitter side of flavor, but countered with just enough malt to prevent it from being too much.  Mouthfeel: Thick, a little bit creamy. Nice carbonation.  Overall / Drinkability: While I think this would be best during the winter, it's not a bad beer to have at the end of the day to slowly savor. One is enough though. The alcohol is well hidden but you know its there, just noticeable to tap you on the shoulder and remind you its a strong beer, but not so strong that it knocks you on your ass later.

More of a roasted coffee bitter than hops, though there is some citrusy character at play. Almost a burnt taste going on in this brew, though it is pleasant. Chocolate and roasted malts ever present though always behind coffee. Hops are way more noticeable in the aftertaste along with some warming booziness. Delish yet complex.  Mouthfeel: Definitely a bit on the thick side. Coats the mouth and lingers on and on lovingly.  Overall: Always has been one of my favorite stouts and will likely continue to be.

Aroma is primarily chocolate and coffee, but there are some fruity hops in there as well.  Flavors are all over the place, but in a good way. There is an unexpected burst of hops and spice. Certainly the alcohol makes his presence felt. Roasted grains are there. Through it all is a thick, malty, sticky sweetness you would expect with the style. However, the hops break up the palate party in such a way to really help drinkability.  You could make the argument that this was the original Black IPA. It delivers everything you would expect from an impy stout, but the floral hop notes really take this to another level of complexity.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Stocean1,4.38,"Poured an ominous pitch black beer, crowned with a thick mocha foam head; mixed, patchy and sticking lace. Retention, excellent. The head slowly cascades as if it can regenerate indefinitely.  Quite subdued in the aroma. Notes of citric hops, big earthy nose, some coffee and leafy hops.  The mouthfeel hits me upfront. It's thick, lush and silky smooth character is complex with roasted, molasses, coffee, dark chocolate, and earthy. Sharp hop character breaks through and is nicely wedded to the malt profile. Flashes of citrus rind and herbal hops provide the bitterness with a hint of carbonation. The abv is devilishly hidden.  This is a tremendous RIS that is complex and supremely drinkable, definitely my favourite in the category.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,BigCheese,4.62,"12oz single, based on drink by date its about 5 months old.  A: Opaque, Ink blaCk, cardboard color head, about 2/3 cm. Barely any lacing, thin cap goes stays on top.  S: Loads of deep chocolate roasted malts, some roasted coffee beans, molasses, and a hint of maybe honey/candy apples. As it warms some hop scent comes through.  T: Loads of Dark Coco, Chocolate Syrup right off the bat, some french roast coffee there too, theres a bit of a mango/piney kick from the hops actually, pretty robust. Finishes a bit more floral and earthy. Malt bill is rather timid for a RIS, not overly roasty. More up my alley, a bit different for the style. Very smooth/clean finish shockingly.  M: Not super heavy relative to style, lowish carbonation which is about right for the style. ABV is well integrated. Has a nice creamy/syrupy balance.  O: Drinks more like a Baltic Robust Porter, which I prefer personally. Decent drinkability, good price for what it is. I'm no veteran to the style, but I know what I like.

S: roasted, milk chocolate, dark chocolate, some vanilla, caramel, sweetness. no hops to speak of  T: some grassy and citrus/grapefruit hops upfront, crazy the hop taste on this considering it is about 7 months old. Chocolate and roasted malts, burnt malt along with some bitter roastiness. Slight sweetness and vanilla. the citrus hops and bitter roastiness hangs around after the other flavors dissipate.  M: full bodied, but not too sweet. excellent carbonation, balanced with sweetness and carbonation to cleanse the palate.  O: about as good as it gets for an RIS.

The darker the berry...  Quite the enticing smell of big roast notes and coffee, chocoalte, leather and some earth.  ...the more roasty and bitter the juice...The hops impart an enjoyable aftertaste. This reminds me of drinking French Roast. Just a tad too much of that roasty thang going on for my liking.  The body seems a little light for a RIS.

Smell gains potency as the glass warms. This smells like a tried and true malt bomb.  T - Intense flavors of chocolate, rich malts, and a hint of whiskey warmth that gives the finish a slight burn. Really could give many of the acclaimed chocolate stouts a run.  M - For such a rich and complex stout this is very drinkable, and actually went well with a meal. Does taste syrupy thick.  O - Was very impressed with this one. Right there with many of the best stouts.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

345,1013,notalagerlugger,4.28,"This is my favorite imperial stout. You could call it a Black IPA if you want, even though I do not belief in this new term. It has a dark color with a dark head. You can smell the toasted and roasted malts as well as the hop bitterness. The taste is sweet at first then followed by the hop flavor. Drinking water while enjoying this beer helps to clean the taste buds to taste the sweet flavor of the first sip. My brother calls this beer liquid bread, I agree it has a chewy mouthfeel. This beer is not a creamy sweet stout; as a hop head I enjoy this beer. It is a stout that any hop head can enjoy or a transition for malty lovers to leave the dark side and switch to the diverse world of hoppy goodness.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Flavor is rich and strong, but smooth. The cocoa seems most prominent, with a deep roasted malt character appearing. The finish brings a wash of hoppy bitter bite.  Ultimately, a complex and highly satisfying imperial stout.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

345,1013,ThisWangsChung,4.33,"Poured into a tulip glass.  A: Pours a textbook borderline pitch black color with vaguely visible carbonation trails. The head is a touch lighter than I like (then again, maybe I'm spoiled by Ten Fidy), as it's only a lighter shade of tan (three fingers high), but it's retention is almost frustrating. Nice lacing, too.  S: LOTS of chocolate and roast comprise the smell...but so do a LOT of piny hops. Schizophrenic in a good way.  T: The first sip surprises with its strong hop bitterness that's very piny in nature. At first, I wondered if I would even like it. But after a while, the hop profile only becomes a complementing note, allowing its RIS character to shine through, with lots of roasty bitterness, chocolate, coffee, saltiness, soy, wood, and a touch of dark fruit, with all of the flavors balancing themselves well. Unbelievable drinkability for a big stout, though it could seemingly pass for a black ale at times.  M: A little thin bodied for a RIS, and very drying, though it manages to avoid feeling like a porter, thanks to its high stickiness. High carbonation for the style, too. Aside from the bitterness, its hoppiness help imparts its drinkability factor.  O: On the very first sip, I wondered whether or not I would even like this. After that, though, I can see why this was so well hyped back in the day. This would have (somehow) been even better if A) my bottle was fresh, or B) my bottle had a year or so of age on it. Even with the hops in an uncomfortable 'gray' area (they're in the stage where they only provide a generic bitterness), I was very much impressed with this. Awesome stuff.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,neophilus,3.8,"Thick mocha head on top of a beer as black as a moonless night. The head falls but leaves some good lacing.  Furity, floral hop aromas greet me which I was not expecting. Hints of malt sweetness underneath. There is some roast in the aroma but nearly covered up by the spicy, hoppy bouquet. It nearly overpowers the rich malty base.  Bitter roast flavor on the tongue, the roast flavor mellows out though and takes on tones of candied plums and dark fruit. A mild acrid roast lingers underneath. The beer is so dry it is nearly astringent but it cleans the sticky fruit and malt flavors up.  The medium mouthfeel has just enough body to carry full bodied flavor without being cloying or too dry. Still though the dark roastiness seems to be at war with the fruity, floral hop bouquet leaving a confused taste on the palate.  Definitely full bodied flavor, lots going on and packing a punch. Still suffers from a mild identify crisis, would like to see less character from the hops and more from the malt.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,spicelab,3.76,"355ml bottle thanks to Chris@Slowbeer.  Black with a dense, brooding mocha head. Good retention and strong lace lattice.  Sharpish floral and herbal hops lead, with vague tropical and pungent hop aromas behind it. Roast character is blunt and moderate, with caramel malts more prominent. Touch of booze.  Vegetal, herbal and slightly spicy hops dominate. Coffee roast builds increasingly along with resinous pine. Still plenty of caramel sweetness.  Body is light for 9.1% and doesn't do a lot to make its presence felt. Slight carbonation vibrancy, but could be more assertive. Mild dreamy lingering bitterness.  Maybe I'm losing the plot but this seems closer to a Black IPA than a Stout to me. Either way, it's pretty yummy, solidly done and I'll definitely be seeking it out again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

I also had a lot of confidence in the quality of this beer since I enjoyed so many different beers from Victory in the past.  I poured this beer into a snifter to enjoy sipping. It is very dark with a minimal tan head. I actually swirled it to bring out more foam and aroma.  The smell and taste is of coffee, malt, and strong amount of booziness. This beer packs a punch, which isn't a surprise for the style. This beer is very well balanced.  I recommend this beer. It may still be on the shelves.

Grainy malts. Sweet with a solid punch of cocoa powder. Roasted malts. Burnt malts. Day old fire that's been watered down. Touches of new leather. Charcoal.  Taste: Smoke and an ashtray. Big charred charcoal flavors. Burnt malts push flavors of dark cocoa, old coffee grinds, and burnt meat edges (without the meaty component). Pure char. Lingering sweetness and a touch of roasted malts round out the back, but it's all about the char. Faint hints of citrus on the back. Alcohol asserts itself, but mildly.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and creamy without ever being full. Carbonation is minimal and works well with the burnt malt assault.  Overall: Every time I try this beer it reminds me of a fire or an ashtray. It's easily one of the most burnt tasting beers I've ever encountered. This is by no means a bad thing. Loads of flavor, but finishing a whole bottle becomes taxing.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

345,1013,SickGnar,3.56,"A: Jet black & totally opaque. Large just slightly dark tan head that dimples as it settles and does a nice cascading effect right after the pour. It retains okay & leaves decently good lace. Basic look, but very solid.  S: Dry roasty malts. Herbal hops are strong and forward. Hints of dark fruits, dark bitter-sweet cocoa, & molasses sweetness. Okay, but surprisingly minimal.  T: This is a touch better. Sweetness is a bit more forward & richer. Molasses, burnt toffee, scorched sugars. Dark fruits are more richly prune and raisin. Roast takes on a chicory note with hints of true coffee and then some burnt and ash notes on the backend. Still just a hint of bitter-sweet cocoa. Hops keep an herbal base but get very grassy, and also quite spicy with a touch of earthy & resiny pine. Hop bitterness is very firm. The finish is super long lasting. Grassiness from hops gets to be too much & clashes with other aspects.  M: A bit over medium body but not that much. Carbonation is fairly under-matched yet soft. Silky and wet. Not as thick as some big stouts. Just a few sugars and dextrins. Lots of roast drying. The hint of alcohol warming grows with each sip.  D: Not the most complexity ever, but nice depth and richness. Very well hidden abv, so be careful. It may be heresy, but I dare say that this has too much hop character – at least the grassy almost vegetal type. Nothing really stands out as amazing, but overall this is quite good. If just a bit rough at the edges.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Body is black and opaque..no signs of light through this one. A good amount of lacing from start to finish.  S: Dominated by earthy floral hops. Also getting some licorice and anise. Dark roasted malt is there but not nearly as pronounced as I’m used to in a Russian Imperial.  T: Surprisingly not as complex or intense as the nose indicated. It helps to aerate this in your mouth a bit to get the full experience. Starts thin and the flavors sort of build up. Initial hit of floral resiny hop bitterness followed by more bitterness, but this time from the dark roasted malt. Finish features the dry roasted malt. Alcohol is very well hidden throughout.

It's as black as can be, no light penetrates it at all.  S: Some milk chocolate notes. Some roasted coffee. I'm getting something akin to hops but it's muddled with the malts. I'm having trouble picking up much else.  T: Whoa! There's a distinctive hop profile! It's a bit jarring but interesting. The flavors start out as a smoky, roasted coffee and turn to that milk chocolate. It finishes with lots of hops. A bit muddled and confused but ok!  M: Slick and medium to heavy body. Light carbonation. Could use a bit more.  O: This beer is closer to an Imperial Black IPA than a Russian Imperial Stout in my opinion. Maybe slightly more malt forward instead of hop forward for a Black IPA though. That being said it was definitely interesting but if I'm looking for a beer along these lines I'll reach for a black IPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

345,1013,kemoarps,4.01,"I had heard good things so I decided to give it a try.  it poured an espresso black/DEEP brown, with a two finger headthat FINALLY melted down to about a sixteenth of an inch for the rest of the drink, left great marking down the glass  the smell was... ok. didn't seem that great, but then again aroma smell has never been my strongest sense. big chocolatey aroma with some espresso undertones.  The taste would have been surprising had I not read reviews prior. It's good, let me say that. The rating will attest to that, it's just not exactly what I expected. A slightly higher hop profile than I'm used to, especially in a beer like this. I'm not usually a huge hop fan, but it works here, as the malts (my personal preference) are still able to make themselves heard. The chocolate tastiness is very welcoming.  It has a more forgiving moutfeel than a lot of comparable beers I've had. not nearly as coating, and smoothe, amazingly smoothe.  Drinkable. not as filling as some deep beers like this. A little more bitter than I would necessarily go for continuously, but hey, there's no accounting for taste right?  overall, a very enjoyable beer. Recommended, but not necessarily the end all be all some of my friends had made it out to be.  Edit: (originals: 4.5/3.5/3.5/4.5/3.0) So, in coming back to this after not having drank it in over three years (and the accompanying change in my palate and preference), I figured it was worth revisiting (especially since I have a six pack in my fridge right now). In re-reviewing this beer I would add to the flavour profile in saying pointing out the presence of the alcohol flavour. It's not unpleasantyly overpowering, but it is certainly there. I don't know why I wasn't more prepared for the hoppy bitterness (oh the follys of youth...), but it's not out of character for an RIS. Reading back over my previous review, I would highlight the mouthfeel. This is silky smoothe for an RIS. You can taste the fact that it is 9% but man oh man, it has such a creamy silky smoothness to it, and just disappears down the hatch beautifully (and joyfully).  I stand by my summary: this is a very well crafted beer. It is delicious, and a good entry into the style. Drink this beer. Try it at least. HOWEVER, it is not the panacea that I had it built up to be. Don't take that as a negative: THIS IS OBJECTIVELY A VERY VERY GOOD BEER, AND SHOULD BE DRUNK.

At the very edge of my glass I can see rising carbonation. The rad is tan, almost brown and stands a half inch tall. The aroma is sweet and with bits of toast smell as I open the bottle. My nose was truly fooled into believing it was breakfast and my toast was ready. I get more of a chocolate smell after the beer is in the glass though. In the taste I first get a quick punch of bitterness right in the front of the tongue, followed by a smooth bittersweet chocolate. I also get soem roasted malts. The initial pop on the tongue confuses me, not sure if I like that or not. As the beer leaves the tongue I am left with a lingering bitterness.

S: Earthy floral and pine hops are very bold and present, especially for the style. There is some nice roasted sweet malts, brown sugar, molasses and bitter chocolate as well.  T: The hops really provide an aggressive balance for the huge malt presence, making this at once a big beer but also a very drinkable one. Nice dark chocolate and sweet caramel flavors, a hint of smoke fight with the hops all the way through to the finish.  M: Smooth and creamy with moderate carbonation, but the hops really add a ton of piney bitterness to the end.  O: I was really blown away by just how much of the earthy pine hops and bitterness there was in this beer.

T: Flavors are dark roasted malts, coffee, and chocolate with a pleasant amount of bitterness in the finish. The flavors are deep and complex.  M: Medium to full bodied with some creaminess and warmth from the alcohol present.  O: For a beer with a relatively high ABV, it is extremely well hidden both in the smell and the taste. This beer is extremely drinkable and is a nice tailgating beer late into the football season here in the NYC area (where it can get quite cold) due to the robustness of the flavors.

Background tastes of dark fruit and coffee, but they aren't as prominent as I would expect in a RIS. Slight alcohol burn, although not offputting. Great toasty, hoppy, imperial stout.  M - Nice carbonation. A little bit chewy with a moist finish.  O - Very good RIS with a balance and drinkability for the ABV.

345,1013,ManuelHerrera,4.17,"Poured from a bottle, my token good beer from my Bevmo mystery box, was a fairly pleasant experience. Dark chocolate brown, but not quite black in color; with a thin hear and visible carbonation. Not as visibly massive as its brethren.  Dark, heavy aroma consisting of toffee, dark chocolate, bourbon barrel aging, syrupy prunes, dates, a little bit of fig. The palate is boldly flavored with thick bourbon and coffee, underlying alcohol cutting through thick chewy layers of malt. Flavor opens up nicely to a lovely hoppy pine taste that adds an herbal quality. Chewy without being too heavy, it's a challenge for novice beer drinkers, but not the best imperial stout on the market. Still, a very good beer with a taste with some dessert.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,tlazaroff,3.81,"I get everything I expect from a nice RIS: roast with underlying fruitiness, and a bit of dark chocolate comprise the beautiful malt profile. I get a slight floral note from the hops.  The beer looks fantastic! Its black as a moonless night - no light penetration what-so-ever, and the head is a thick dark mocha froth that sticks around, as well as to the sides of the glass.  In the tasting, I get big raw espresso bean flavors, and very little chocolate. The bitterness comes in on the finish - again floral notes linger afterwards until the next sip brings forth the coffee flavors again. I feel as if it's a tad on the bitter side for my tastes, but only slightly.  Storm King is quite a full bodied beer with moderate carbonation. It is slightly astringent which actually works for it.  Overall Storm King is quite enjoyable and surprisingly highly drinkable. The single bottle price was worth admission to try it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Upon pouring, the tan bubbles sweep up through the dark brew giving it an almost nitrogen driven pub brew appearance. Quite beautiful for a bottled beer.  Smell - Was a bit weaker then would have been expected for the deep color and known abv. Dark dried fruits are the first to be detected followed by some mild roasted dark malts of chocolate and coffee.  Taste - A roasty coffee and chocolate flavor first meet the tongue which then mixes with a sweeter more dried cherry and raisin taste. A very little bit of hoppiness works it way in toward the end and rounds out the beer quite nicely.  Mouthfeel - A creamy brew with a very nice level of carbonation. A little chewy but in a good way. A nice body for this ~ 9 % abv brew.  Overall - A very good beer for the price you pay.

S - Sourdough bread, vegetal, cheese, some hop cones. Not real strong and kind of weird.  T - Definitely not the expected RIS taste. This is pretty well-hopped, which sits atop a spicy well-toasted grain base that has some chocolate malt sweetness. The lingering aftertaste gets its bitterness both from the roast and the hops.

It leaves behind a very nice line of lacing throughout. Quite simply a beautiful beer.  The smell is hard on dark cherries or raisins, or some other dried fruit, and a rich, boozy smell that pokes through, with some definite chocolate and malt hints. Fairly pleasant.  Taste is of deep, dark chocolates and coffees up front, followed by warm, boozy/mildly fruity hints and a finish of mild hops. Aftertaste of burst, smokey nuts and malts. Really very tasty and quite complex.  It's a thick beer, with only a mild bit of carbonation, so it doesn't go down especially easy, but it works.

The taste is heavy on the coffee end, with a really pleasant hoppy bitter finish. Clean on the palate. Mouthfeel is dry.  I like this beer a lot. For such a big brew (9.10% ABV), it's not boozy at all. It's especially nice in the winter, as it warms the insides gradually. A subtle Russian Imperial Stout, if there is such a thing.

The foam being more on the lighter side but not quite white. The beer itself was black as night, much darker than a negro modello.  As for the taste, I thought there was a hint of cherry. Much like other stouts very malty and slightly oaty. Roasted malts Not bitter in taste even thought it is around 53 in IBU measurement. I didnt pick up espresso or whole flour. It says it uses American hops too.  Victory has a habit of making quality beers, but this one for me doesn't really stand out on their product line.

Smell is of dark cherries or raisins, sweet boozy rum bread. The barest hint of coffee/bitter chocolate is in there.  Fortunately, it's not all fruity in the taste, as it's bitter coffee up front and in the middle, has a strange fruity hop finish and a great bitter chocolate aftertaste.  A medium heavy body, slightly chewy feel, and low carbonation make this right on style, yet I had a hard time finishing it, almost cringing after each drink.

Acquired from my local beer specialist a while back, and stored in my fridge.  Poured into a Duvel tulip. A jet black hue - no light penetrates this stout. Produces a massive head of brown foam that lasts for quite a while before subsiding. Aroma of dark, roasted malt with notes of coffee, cocoa, molasses, dried fruit and stewed hops. A hint of pine and a whiff of booze in the background.  An intense flavour sensation. Tastes of roasted malt with powerful notes of coffee. Subtler hints of cocoa, brown sugar, dried fruit, stewed hops and a warming hit of alcohol. Faint notes of piny aromatic hops. A very bitter finish. Mouthfeel is pleasingly smooth and tingly, with good body. Quite astringent; dries the palate. Aftertaste of bitter roasted malt and coffee.  Very nice - a flavour sensation. The aroma seems less forward than might be expected, but the taste makes up for it. The body is also good, though I can't help feeling that it could have been thicker. The only problem with this beer is my impression that it's good but not great - there's a missing dimension to it. Lots of flavour but a lack of depth.

S: Roasted dark coffee with hints of chocolate.  T: I tasted a decent amount of hops in this one. It has a pretty bitter aftertaste.  M: Medium bodied. Alcohol is well hidden.

345,1013,Cenosillicaphobe,4.52,"First review here...sort of a preface to my forthcoming Dark Intrigue review. I am olfactararilly challenged, so the nose of beer is lost on me, as noted in my profile.  Poured rather violently from a 12oz bottle into a Dogfish Head signature glass, which happens to be my weapon of choice, in most cases. This pours a midnight black, with a two-tiered head of mocha and khaki. Fairly rapid dissipation with minimal, yet stubborn lacing.  I'd be lying if I gave you any sort of impression of the nose. As you will come to understand, I can't really smell a damn thing.  The flavor is all dark chocolate, black coffee, and piney hops. Perhaps a hint of dark fruit as well, and some licorice as it warms. In many ways both typical and atypical of the style. Sweet, but not cloyingly so. Bitter, yet not overwhelmingly so. Many would rule this a bit hop forward, but the balance works for me.  Overall, honestly, this is my go-to imperial stout. I probably actually like the North Coast Old Rasputin a wee bit more, but SK is cheaper, and it appeals to my inner hophead.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,J23hc,3.9,"First time trying this. Pours avg darkness, generous mocha head that fades relatively fast. Strong malt presence, mint chocolate, olive oil in the aroma, with some hoppiness. Taste hardly matches, coffee, chocolate and dark fruits primarily blueberry up front and a bitter and burnt finish. No alcohol to be noticed. Drinkable and good.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Rhettroactive,3.78,"From 12oz bottle to Bruges hybrid glass on 11/22/11 *From notes  A: It certainly looks good. It's a rich, creamy brownish black. A standard pour yields a frothy 2.5 finger head. Really impressive lacing and retention.  S: Dark chocolate, roasted dark coffee, dank and a pretty wicked hop bill for an RIS.  T: Rich and toasty up front. The moment this hits the mid, the hops kick into gear and really take this to a place not many stouts go. It's like the richest damn Cascadian Dark you've ever had. The finish is quite bitter from the hops, yet charry from the dark chocolate malt.  M: A bit on the thin side. Call me picky, but I like my RIS's like used motor oil. This, sadly, isn't anywhere near said consistency.  O: Victory's done a nice job with their Storm King. It's certainly taken the road less traveled, and I like that. I'm excited to check out the BA version of this (Dark Intrigue), and though I don't foresee me reaching for this often, I quite enjoyed it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Not a lot of hops or chocolate or anything really, a good, one dimensional aroma.  T- Once again, just a really good iced coffee. I don't think very much else stands out. I guess some hops on the finish. Tastes good, just not a lot going on.  M- Thin. Maybe a little over carbonated for what it is.  O- It's a good not great beer. I would drink again. Probably wouldn't cruise over to my local Binny's and pick up a six pack or put it on my wants list again...",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Smell of roasted coffee and perhaps a bit of chocolate  Good tasting stout...kind of sweet, a bit of hops on the back end and a bit of a black licorice taste, I guess this might have been the wee bit of alcohol.

Dark brown almost black opaque body, no visible carbonation due to hue, 1/2 finger light brown head, fairly quick dissipation with decent lacing. Nose features roasted malts, coffeeish, some chocolate and a wee bit of smoke, with citrus and floral hops for balance. Taste mirrors nose, I thought this was pretty roasty upfront and became more hoppy as it warmed. Mouthfeel a bit on heavy side of medium, not sticky, good effervescence. A bit flat on the pour, may have been a capping issue. Really drinkable, the ABV is well hidden. A solid RIS, good interplay of citrus and roast, worth a try.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,CrookedStill,3.5,Poured into Dogfish Head signature glass.  Pours oil black with a thick 2-3 finger mocha head that leaves a nice lacing as it falls.  Lots of chocolate and roasted malts upfront. Fairly straightforward.  Follows the aroma. Roasted and hints of chocolate hit first and then hops make themselves present. Finishes slightly bitter. No trace of the 9% alcohol.  Medium bodied with med/low carbonation.  Overall I'm glad I've tried it. Wouldn't go far out of me way to pick it up again.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Flounder57,3.8,"12 oz bottle was poured into an imperial pint glass.  Appearance: The beer poured a one finger mocha head that has reduced to a thin layer and left minimal lacing on the side of the glass. The beer is also a nice pitch black with no clarity or signs of carbonation.  Smell: roasted coffee, chocolate, molasses, dark fruits, and earthy. Might notice the hops when i have a sip.  Taste: Same as above. Some smokiness going on too, which is very interesting to me. Bittereness from the hops and a litle biscuity too. Alcohol is not even noticeable. Very scary.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied, medium carbonation, smooth, dry, and a little chewy.  Overall: Not a shabby RIS. A good beer by my boys at Victory, but would like a see a little more sweetness, hop presence, and less smokiness.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Two finger head, creamy brown colored with moderate lacing.  S: Malt sweetness, coffee and raisin.  T: First a bit of roasted malt sweetness that I would expect, followed by some decent hops and some smokiness. There's a lot of a coffee bitterness in the mix. Tiny bits of dark fruit sweetness in the beginning, but it's more subtle.  M: Some alcohol burn from this at 9.1%. It could be a bit bigger however.  This beer tastes like a RIS with a bit of a DIPA mixed in. It has many characteristic flavors of the RIS, but a hop profile reminiscent of a DIPA. At times, the hops and malt seem to be fighting each other, but as it warms up, they work together a little better.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Big loops of lacing hung around the sides of the glass throughout.  s: Piney hops. Pretty much just piney hops. It's a nice scent.  T: Piney hops, into a crisp, light chocolate/corn syrup flavor. Charcoal/carbon aftertaste. The bitterness really lingers a long time after each sip, and becomes unpleasant about halfway through the 12 oz serving.  M: Dry and crisp but smooth as butter.  O: I guess this just isn't what I think of when I think of a stout. I like my dark beers sweet and unhoppy. Will gladly stick with others that better suit my tastes.

345,1013,Zimbo,3.68,Irony roasty nose in the bottle and gives a constant half inch medium mocha magnolia head once coaxed into the glass. In the mouth there is a very slight fizz and a carbonic quality at the end though this tends to be dominated by a pleasant dry earthy taste which really coats the mouth but is rather limited in development and complexity.

345,1013,MasterSki,3.81,"Can't believe I've never reviewed this beer, so I figured it was time. Best before June 6th, 2016. Served in a Surly Darkness glass.  A - Pours with a finger of dark than foam that slowly settles to a thick, creamy, cap, leaving behind glass-coating lacework. Body is black, with maybe the faintest dark brown shade to it.  S - There's a lot of hops here - plenty of earthy pine and grapefruit character. Underneath, there's some semisweet chocolate, caramel, roasted malts, licorice, and a touch of char.  T - Taste is a mixture of tobacco, baker's chocolate, caramel, roasted malts, and a hefty dose of herbal hop bitterness in the finish mingling with some espresso and char. The transition from sweet mid-palate to bruising bitterness is somewhat abrupt.  M - Carbonation is too high - please turn it down. Body is medium, and somewhat light for an RIS, although it's not unreasonable for a 9.1% brew. Otherwise the texture is smooth and the finish is sticky, with some obvious resinous hops lingering as well. Light warming alcohol presence.  D - I imagine this was really unique and provocative six years ago. Unfortunately there are many Imperial Stouts that do the same trick better these days. Easy to drink, and certainly one of the 'classics', but Victory seems a bit like a dinosaur these days.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

T-Tastes of dark chocolate,espresso beans,a slight hop bitterness to go along with slightly charred toast and some fruity alcohol notes.Finish is amazingly strong espresso flavors for a beer not actually brewed with coffee.

345,1013,MrELovesBeer,3.7,"An aggressively bitter and roasted stout. Slightly thin mouthfeel but well carbonated. Tasted notes of caramel and coffee. That bitter flavor is just everywhere, up front and lingering afterward. Alcohol starts to sneak up on you halfway into the glass as the beer warms up.

It's not an overall huge stout, but has enough flavor and depth to not be wimpy. Alot of the other imperial stouts can be over the top in thickness, flavor, etc, this is not one of those. It is very smooth, clean and little to no alcohol in the taste or mouthfeel.

My glass looks like it was dipped in light brown soap suds.  Dark chocolate up front scent...roasted malt...and maybe some bitter earthy hops as well. Interesting for a RIS, but good.  Taste follows scent...the hops add an interesting flare to this one. Good, but I'm just not sure about the combination for a RIS.  Wow..it's certainly smooth. Super smooth...like velvet baby. Goes down easy, not much booze detection either...a dangerous combo.

I had to push hard for it to manifest but once it started, the bubbles were pretty full. It’s definitely thicker than standard stouts.  S: The aroma carries strong hints of caramel sugar, some licorice and coffee as well as lingering nuttiness, all in great balance.  T/M: It’s softly carbonated with a potent sweet malt flavor. Roasted and chocolate bitterness help balance the residual sweetness. Best of all, the 9.1% alcohol is well disguised. It’s not quite as thick as the pour looked, but it still coats the mouth well.

Nice cappuccino colored head which started at about 2 fingers and gave some good lacing. Body is pitch black.  The Average - Smell is burnt roasted malts and slight caramel. Also smells light even though the mouthfeel doesn't match up to this. Taste is of dark chocolate and is bitter.  The Judgment - A decent 6-pack for the price, but would rather spend a couple bucks more for a good 4-pack. Just too many better beers out there.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

It has some coffee tastes and a little bit of alcohol.  M: The beer is pretty smooth with a tiny bit of crispness. It also has a great amount of carbonation.

A: pour is opaque black, thick tan head that fades fast  S: roasts and malts, cocoa  T: demands comparison to North Coast's Old Rasputin, as it has some similarities, but this is a far more bitter beer; less sweet, but still as hearty and tasty. Sharp, earthy, mocha.  M: clean for a stout - soft coat with bitter afternotes; espresso aftertaste  O: really good.

Grape juice, mocha, a hint of alcohol, earthy mineral, more grape juice, then herbal hop at the end.  Appearance: Dark, dark opaque black/brown body. The thickest tan head I've seen on a stout in a while. Great retention and excellent lacing.  Flavor: A grape-like sweetness up front, some strong dark chocolate, earth, smoke, mineral, and a nice bitter finish that sticks around.  Mouthfeel: A medium-thick body, with medium-low, velvety carbonation. Hops are just slightly drying.  Overall: A good, solid RIS, but not for those who prefer a sweeter rendition of the style. Very interesting how the hops, malt, and esters work together to emit a grape-like aroma and flavor. The price (~$12) is also a strong selling point for this one.

Slightly roasted and bitter aftertaste. Can not really pick up on the fact that this beer is 9.1% ABV.  M: Medium/heavy carbonation on mf, plus addition of hops creates a multi-faceted sensation. Chewy, hoppy, malty, a lot going on and it all works together. Slight bitterness accentuates depth of taste perception.  O: At its base, this is a good stout. What makes it exceptional is the complimentary and yet contrasting addition of hops and the roasted/bitter component.

Smells super hoppy and oily. Barely getting any malt character at all on the nose. Getting dark malt scents now that i've let it breathe for a bit. Head is really really sticky in some spots. Not a bad looking brew.  Slight malty sweetness up front with touch a caramel but besides the mouthfeel, the rest of this beer tastes like a double ipa. Lots of oily and citric hops present on the back of the tongue along with a good amount of bitterness.  The hops actually lend to a good deal of the beers flavor, i'm getting grapefruit and even pineapple notes. Alot of flavors are present, but i dont think they all blend well at all.

The tan head is a modest one finger, but given the alcohol content is not a surprise. Retention is low but there is a good amount of lace.  Powerful, aromatic hops of pine and woods, plus a heavy amount of roast in the malts.  Big flavors of burnt, roasted grains, as in a strong coffee. This is a very bitter brew, between the hops and the roasted malts, to the point of being astringent. The alcohol makes itself known as well.  The mouthfeel is highly carbonated, with a medium body.

This beer looks like a stout - dark brown, but mostly black in color with a tan head that fades just a little too quickly. Nose is heavy on roast, without much other character - even a little alcohol burn would be nice in this nose or taste.  Taste is primarily roasted malt, definitely get some chocolate and coffee in there, but it just lacks a little bit in the breadth of flavors - it certainly has the depth. Nice full bodied drink, with just a touch of hops balance.

I regret the decision to finally pick this up the other night, but I am very thankful I only picked up one, rather than the whole six pack.  The beer looked good enough: dark, nice head  The beer smelled only slightly better than it tasted. Smelled like charcoal, alcohol, and maybe a hint of berries (which is the reason for the extra .5 over taste).  The beer tasted terribly - I choked this thing down. Alcohol and charcoal awfulness.  The beer had mouthfeel that was disappointing- much, much too thin for a stout of this alcohol content. I might be scoring it higher here, since he taste and aroma were so bad and the mouthfeel, by comparison, was much better.  This beer was just not good.

345,1013,jegross2,4.2,"2011 vintage self-served in a tulip glass. Drinking this after a glass of Great Lakes' ""Blackout Stout,"" so I guess I am in a Russian Imperial Stout mood tonight.  Appearance: Black as night, though some light penetrates the outline of the beer. The beer pours a 1.5 finger creamy head.  Aroma: Very subtle licorice and red wine nose. Sweet chocolate, and perhaps a very faint oak scent. Interesting hops aroma as well.  Taste: The flavor is led by a subtle fruit taste that quickly gives way to a strong espresso and a bitter, roasted malt flavor. Slightly hoppy, which is a bit unexpected but welcome. Roasted coffee flavors become more pronounced as the beer warms. The beer finishes with a flavor of dark, unsweetened chocolate with a lingering smoaky/oaky coffee flavor. The finish reminds me of eating a dark chocolate candy at an upscale restaurant after a steak dinner that is followed by coffee for ""dessert."" Very balanced.  Mouthfeel: Rich, smooth and full bodied. The beer is slightly creamy and warming (no doubt from the 9.1% ABV), though not boozy in the least. The finish is sweet, and the flavor lingers.  Overall: a very drinkable Russian Imperial Stout. The flavor is not as enticing as the Blackout Stout, but the aroma is much more pleasant. Storm King's bitterness is a unique quality that works well to balance out the expresso flavor and complement the chocolate tones. This is a beer worthy of the Russian Imperial Stout style.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Hops oils come flying at my nose, strong pine resin, carob syrup, chocolate and coffee malts arrive in the back. Anise, earl grey tea bags, bitter dark chocolate, and piney hops bombard the tongue, the full body which carries it is accentuated by it's spicy dryness and mild carbonation.  Overall I am surprised that such a big beer warm and full bodied comes at a cheap price. 10 bucks for 6.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Smell is citrusy grassy hops, some roasted malts, and a hint of tobacco. Taste is all of those things with some expresso and a hint of grapefruit and pine, and it really works some how. Mouthfeel is on the thicker side, but not the chewiest. Plenty of carbonation and very easy drinking for it's abv.

Film of island-like retention. Good chunky rings of lace all the way down.  S - Sweet chocolate, roasted malt, coffee. All elements seem to strike a balance. An oak note perhaps as well. A slight floral note.  T - A strong roasted malt note with espresso. A definate hop note is there with a little floral element. A chocolate/hop balance is there that works quite nicely.  M - A hop bitterness is always a welcome addition to a strong stout. Tingly carbonation, thick, full body.  O/D - A good stout. The gentle hop addition is nice. There is no overly sweet element and the alcohol is perfectly masked. No flaws, and just short of excellence.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Settling, but sticking with crazy thick lacing.  S: Actually quite nice. Not over-powering. Basic stout smell, roasted malts and sweet to me. Nothing jumping out at me.  T: Wow. Very sweet and roasted. Chocolate. Malts. Taste is kinda how strong brew coffee smells. Not overpowering, but lasting. I can still taste my last sip (a few minutes ago) as I write this. Don't notice the alcohol all that much. As it warms I get more hoppy bitterness, again nothing too strong. Again warming and sensing some alcohol taste now, with some fruit at the very beginning.  M: Thick and creamy. All over the mouth and lasting. Smooth throughout with a chalky aftertaste in a good kinda way.  O: My new favorite of late, preferred over some other ""highly rated"" stouts.

Lots of spruce/pine initially in the flavor. Sweet, dark roasty malt flavors come in and dominate for a while, before handing it over again to the hops which contribute tons of bitterness. The bitter hops and dark malts combine for a slightly astringent finish. Alcohol warmth finishes things off and persists for a while in the throat.  Mouthfeel is velvety and rich, with sweetness and bitterness melding together nicely, but with marked strength in both areas.  Very drinkable for a RIS. The American hop character is nice, and keeps things fresh and vibrant in an otherwise thick beer.

It has a big, frothy mocha colored head with good retention that retains a decent sized layer on top. Small bubble streams make their way up the sides of the glass giving it a lively appearance.  S: There is a good balance between flowery, piney hops and roasted malts. Some subtleties of coffee and espresso add their aromatic hints to the aroma.  T: The taste is very similar to the smell with a near perfect balance of hops and roasted malts. There is less of an appearance of coffee in the taste than the smell.  M: It is medium bodied with a carbonation level that complements the feel and aids in bringing out the strong hoppy flavors. It has a sticky and chalky feel as well.  O: This is a very good stout and probably one of the best I have ever had. I will certainly be checking this one out again when I can get my hands on it.

A lot going on here with a plethora of complex flavors. Specifically the roasted dark malts that blend nicely with citrusy hops. This is a rich and outspoken imperial stout and the tangy hop profile blasts away any trace of alcohol. A somewhat dry aftertaste of roasted malts, chocolate, and coffee.

Bitter finish from the hops, almost hard to taste anything else.  Medium to full bodied. Sharp, snappy carbonation. Super dry finish from the hops makes me thirsty and crave for another sip.  Good stout. I think they over did it on the hops a little bit. This is difficult for me to say considering I love hops, yet there needs to be a balance.

T- Taste is very bitter as well. Wasn't expecting a lot of haps and I'm not sure if thats what this is or if this is just a bad bottle. If this doesn't improve I likely won't finish the bottle. Edit: As it warms it does get a little sweeter and tasty but still rather bitter  M- Best part of the beer, smooth and creamy and if the taste was better I'd love it because it lingers on the palate  O- I know this is a good stout and representation of it's style.

Estery and alcohol forward with some similar qualities to a doppelbock. The hops are floral. The malts give off smells of dark fruits, plum and fig.  Taste: Very dry with roasted smokey malts. Fruits such as plum and cherry are noticeable. The overall impression is of espresso with a bitter finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium and chalky with a great balance between hops and malts. The malts and hops make many subtle impressions on my palate. Nothing is too cloying but rather the flavors make their impression and then fade into a decent bitterness.  Overall: Good price and amazing drinkability for a beer of this strength. It satisfies without being too think or heavy. Lots of character in a European interpretation of the imperial stout.

345,1013,Pahn,3.28,"12oz bottle into Duvel tulip. ""Best by June 6, 2016"" printed on the bottle.  Appearance: Free pour yields a two inch, frothy tan head that dissipates slowly leaving a wall of lacing. Pours a solid black with red brown highlights and leaves sprawling continents of lacing.  Smell: They're not kidding about the Pacific Northwest hops. Heavy American hop aroma, pungent, piny, citrusy, tropical fruity. Underneath is an almost equally strong note of caramel and raisin. Very nice.  Taste: First sip: maximal hop bitterness along with a well-melded flavor of citrusy/piny hops with cookies and caramel, resolving as roasted malt with a long, hot finish. I like the blending, but the hops and malt each come across as pretty one-dimensional. The bitterness is definitely pushing it.  Later sips are dominated by hop bitterness and piny, somewhat dank and citrusy hop flavor. If this bitterness is supposed to keep the richness in check, it succeeds... but it also obliterates all the deep, delicious malt flavors I want from a Russian Imperial Stout. Some nice flavors show through occasionally, but in general it's just one hoppy punch to the face after another.  I wanted to give this more points due to the brewer's intention being to make a hoppy imperial stout, but this fails when compared to both standard RISs and that very intention. It's so unbalanced... and every time I sniff the glass, I perceive exactly what the beer *wants* to taste like, and every time I sip, I'm disappointed.  Mouthfeel: Full side of medium bodied. Overcarbonated; the heavy carbonation combines with the giant IBU to clear out any semblance of subtlety or depth. Bitterness considered on its own is quite nice though. Lingering heat is also pleasant and appropriate.  Overall: The beer isn't as unappealing as I'm making out perhaps, but it definitely commits the cardinal sin of smelling *way* better than it tastes. It also takes a style often ridiculed for its boldness and rather than marrying those extreme flavors and making them sing, just blasts you with bitterness. While there's some decent flavor underneath, I can't handle the imbalance.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,thebrood1987,4.95,"Getting huge aromas of that whole flower fruity almost cherry or in this case blueberry smell. A bit piney as well and then underneath you get the subtle coffee, chocolate and sweet dark roasted malts.  It's sweet up front with the chocolate and coffee and sweet dark roasted bitter malts up front and then the piney, fruity hop resin taste. You get a bit of the alcohol in there as it warms. When it does warm the hops subside just a bit and the dark roasted sweet malt and the chocolate coffee taste comes through a bit more.  This beer comes in two phases really. When its cold its all about the strong bitter hops with the stout flavors residing a bit behind it and then they come out more as it warms with the hops still playing a good role. Its almost like a black IPA in my mind which I dont mind at all because I love IPA's and the taste of Pacific Northwest hops.  What I like the most about this beer is definitely its hoppy character for a stout but not only that but how they meld the dry bitterness from the dark roasted coffee chocolate malts with the whole flower hops so well. The whole flower hops definitely give it that more hoppy flavor than you'd find in a stout but it really is quite a beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Smell - Dark fruits, molasses, roasted coffee, burnt toffee, a touch of soy sauce, hint of dark breadcrust.  Taste - Starts dark fruits and juniper, some black coffee, molasses at the center of the tongue. Finished with some dry breadcrust and some grassy hop flavors. I'm also getting a few spots of unsweetened black cherries in the corners of the mouth.  Mouthfeel - Smooth mouthfeel, carb seems up a bit for the style, which gives an unexpected tingle and sharpness on the sides of the tongue, but some may like this. Very drinkable, but carb keeps this from being a more creamy and mouth coating RIS.  Overall - I really like the balance and complexity, but I would like this more with lower carb - potential depth and creaminess are decreased as a result.

The roasted coffee is definitely there in the flavor, not much chocolate coming out. There tons of roasted goodness that lingers on your tongue after every sip though which I really like. Its on the bitter side for sure. The alcohol isn't overpowering but its still there to remind you that its an imperial stout.

The hops really stand out in the smell; something a little different than I'm used to. Roasted malt and bitter black coffee accent the hops.  The thing that really sets Storm King apart from the other stouts Ive tried is the hoppy bitterness. The way the hops and bitter coffee interacted was actually kind of refreshing somehow. It really feels like a black, heavy DIPA. Its not as heavy as I would like from a stout, but the addition of hops flavor really make up for it.  Feels really light on the tongue (with big bold flavors somehow). Leaves a bitter hoopiness and coffee flavor in the mouth.  A really solid stout.

S: Bitter dark chocolate and huge piney + herbal hops. More like a Black IPA (or whatever you want to call it) than an RIS, but not a hop profile that I find terribly attractive. Meh.

Similar to the nose very robust. Medium bodied. not very easy to drink.  O: a super solid stout. Can’t recall tasting anything better from this style.

345,1013,Rifugium,3.94,"First had: ? (various)  Pours an opaque black-brown with a nice-sized tan head that retains and laces well. Roasted malt aroma, coffee and cocoa, some dark fruits and hints of citrusy hops. Nice full-bodied taste, nothing you haven't had in a stout before, aside from probably more hops than you're generally used to from the style. Dark roasty malts, coffee, dark chocolate, licorice, and brown sugar, with notes of citrus and floral hops. Modestly complex, tasty, and very drinkable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Smells like dark sweet, roasty malts, chocolate but it has a hop presense to that leaves it fairly balanced.  A glance of hops is overrun by the dark malts in the smell. Finish with a light bitterness that melds with some of the malt. Good mouthfeel, smooth carbonation. Nice hop spice.

S - Bitter chocolate, licorice, touch of dark fruit.  T - Bitterness its you first, a little hot booziness mellows to bitter chocolate, a touch of licorice, a little dark fruit, then a dry hoppy finish.  M - Medium High carbonation. A little too much for this style. Wanted it to be a bit creamier.  D - Medium Low. Bitterness and alcohol taste doesn't make this go down real easy.  This beer is all over the place for me.

Taste: Dark malt flavors, chocolate and roasted coffee. Slightly bitter hoppy finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium body and medium carbonation.  Overall: This is a smooth and tasty stout. The smell immediately after pouring from the bottle was kind of strong and boozy which had me a little worried.

345,1013,tobelerone,3.67,"Not much head here..just a thin band, with lacing of frothy little bubbles falling quickly down the sides of the glass. A black beer through which no light escapes.  Aroma of roasty, burnt malt and faint booze. Taste is dominated by hops rather than by roastiness, malt sweetness, or bittersweet chocolate, all of which remain on the perimeter. This bottle is nearly a year old but carbonation and hops are still strong.  A really different stout overall - strong, crisp, bitter. Mouthfeel lacks any sense of creaminess. Stands out from the crowd but not necessarily loving this one. A stout for those who gotta get their hops at all times. A bit unbalanced and one-sided for my palate.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Hopfenpeter,4.03,"The beer poured dark brown, almost black and produces a nice brown head about two fingers high. It leaves a nice lacing after dissipating. The smell is coffee, toasted malt, coffee, yet there is also a citrus flavor, which probably comes from some fine hops. The taste up front is surprisingly rich on hops, which give a citrus flavor as a start, but mingles immediately with some roasted malt and coffee. In the middle there is dark chocolate. The finish again has hop character and adds some fruit flavor, yet produces some bitterness. A very interesting combination. The beer is nice and thick and has great stout character. A very good example of it's style, great job!!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

It had a pronouced head, though small and it dissipated quickly. The color of the foam was a golden amber. It left nice lacing on the glass.  Upon smelling the beer it has a nice roasted coffee sent, hints of cocoa and toffee and it smelled sweeter than it actually was.  This was a hop forward stout, the bitterness from the hops filled my entire palate. There was a smokey coffee flavor with hints of citrus peel that you get from hoppy beers. The chocolate flavor was mild. It had good carbonation.  Overall this was a good beer, actually based on other reviews I would say a really good beer. As a stout, I was not expecting as much hops as this beer has and was surprised by that.

Overall the smoke flavor killed everything else for me and I didn't love this as much as I hoped to.

345,1013,output01x,4.37,"Poured from a 12 oz. capped bottle (Enjoy By 06/06/16) into a snifter glass.  A vigorous pour yields a 2 1/2-finger tan head that slowly recedes to a thin but clumpy dusting and thick foam ring. The body is a nearly perfect black. Some light lacing can be noticed clinging to the glass throughout consumption.  Oddly, spicy, floral hops strike the nostrils first. Dark malts with notes of dark chocolate, roasted coffee beans, and caramel are also noticeably present, giving a more classic stout quality to the nose.  Dark malts start each sip with dark chocolate, caramel, and sweet, dark fruits. As soon as the beer is swallowed, a roasted coffee beans flavor comes out but is accompanied closely by grassy, herbal hops. The hops flavors of course bring a decent bitterness that matches the dark malt flavors nicely.  Medium to full bodied with decent carbonation, this beer is very drinkable for the style. The body is thick and slightly sticky. It coats your mouth well with an almost syrupy quality. The carbonation isn't very noticeable as it is not very fizzy, but it is strong enough to prevent this beer from losing drinkability.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Smells of dark fruits, roasted malts, and come caramel; most emphasis is on the fruit, which I find surprising (well, unexpected). Tastes of dry, roasted malt before a burst of dark fruits (raisin, date, plum, touch of dark cherry) takes over. Ends with some caramel and toffee. Mouth is very dry and sticky, and feels slightly under carbonated. Ultimately, it reminds me of a toned-down, much fruitier Old Rasputin; that said, I’d probably prefer an Old Raspy if given the choice.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Appearance (4.0): Black as night, with a huge, four+ finger head that fades to a one-finger, pock-marked and slowly bubbling, fine head of dark khaki foam, like a cappuccino. Some lacing all around the glass, as well.  Smell (4.0): Sweet, roasted barley with a healthy licorice scent in there. Light coffee scent below that. Sweet and roasty, but not too bitter. More char in the nose as it warms.  Taste (4.5): First is a bitter (but not overpowering) coffee note, with a nice floral hop bitterness to accompany it, all balanced out by this sweet barley base underneath. Doesn’t taste like a wad of caramel or sugary malts underneath it, but more like a full, kind of earthy flavor you might get in something like a bran muffin or Cracklin’ Oat Bran. As it warms up, the bitter, floral hop presence becomes more noticeable, helping to balance it so it’s not overly sweet. And, during the whole thing, there’s hardly any alcohol on the palate whatsoever.  Mouthfeel (4.0): Smooth. The body is actually on the light side for such a big stout, like a solid medium but nowhere near “heavy” by any means. The carbonation is smooth and constant, making it almost creamy on the tongue. This is just smooth, smooth, smooth. Maybe could be thicker, but this is fine by me.  Overall (4.5): Balanced, smooth, rich and full, all without being “too much” of anything—drinkable as can be for its size and strength. Dark and stormy never tasted to smooth.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

345,1013,BarryMFBurton,3.93,"Victory must have a very wide-spread distribution, because I see them wherever I am; HopDevil and Prima Pils, especially. I could always go for an Imperial Stout, though, so I’m happy to start my relationship with this brewery as such.  Not quite sure how old this is, but there’s a stamp on the bottle that says “Enjoy by March 26, 2016,” so it seems rather fresh.  A: Whoa, this head is fantastic. As soon as I poured, I knew it was going to be thick, but what happened next totally surprised me: the head stayed in place at the size of half my glass. It didn’t appear to be moving at all. So I went and made a phone call, and, when I came back, there was still quite a bit of head to go. Official time: seven minutes to move from half a glass to two fingers! Incredible! And the lacing, too – superb. Add in its midnight-black color and this one has got to be one of the best looking Imperial Stouts I’ve ever laid eyes on.  S: Remarkably fresh: both the hops and the malts come off as “green,” in a way. As far as grains go, I can sense some fresh wheat fruitiness, as well as a nice undercurrent of lightly roasted malts. The hops are there in a very natural way, with a leafy punch instead of a resiny, bitter smell. Then, with a few twirls of the glass, I can smell some big, syrupy chocolate beneath all the organic scents; it’s very decadent. One other oddity that really sticks out to me is the water. It gives off a bitter, mineral aroma, much like something you’d find in an English pub-style brewery like Samuel Smith. It’s different, and I like it.  T: The mineral taste is first, followed by a quick blast of grainy malts. You can taste a hint of chocolate malt for a moment, but there isn’t much down time before the hops arrive. They come in a huge, bitter resin taste that absolutely wallops you into the aftertaste. The presence of hops in this one, especially because of the mildness of the nose, serves as more than a little surprise; even more so since that’s all you get. The aftertaste has a very small grainy taste to it, but the majority of what you’re feeling for the minutes afterwards is a super-piney dryness. I like the idea of a hop-forward stout, but when you leave room for very little else, you’re kind of pushing it.  M: Very brightly carbonated, though I wished it wouldn’t have been. The hops have enough kick as it is! Even so, I can feel a bit of that same pub-style thinness to the body, which adds to the drinkability at least a little bit.  O: When it comes to this beer, I like where Victory’s head is at. Lots of hops, some dark, natural malts, and a handful of British character should be a winning combination for a Russian Imperial Stout. However, it feels a little rough around the edges. You can taste that it has character, but the hop profile just comes off too big. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, though – I mean, if you’re going to brew beer, you’d probably rather have the problem of too much taste instead of not enough. And between those two choices, Victory clearly has the upper hand.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

S: Bitter licorice, spice aroma of anise, piney hops, espresso, sweet caramel, and faint dark chocolate notes. Smell of hops is quite noticeable in this RIS style. Everything blends quite well together considering the varied aromas.  T: Not surprisingly from the smell, bitter hops are at the forefront of the taste with a faint malty backbone kicking in after. Licorice and anise add further to the bitterness. There's a slight sour tartness to this which is a little like grapefruit. Espresso is faint, and really no evidence of that dark chocolate (rats!). Alcohol well hidden.  M: Not as thick/viscous as I would prefer in this style, with a little too much carbonation for my liking.  D: A decent RIS but not one that I would drink again.

This covers the gambit of RIS notes.  Dark, earthy, leather, tobacco, and espresso notes. Noticeable grain characteristics as well with a bittering hop finish. Alcohol is hidden well in the finish.  Too much carbonation for me. It fizzed up on my tongue so I could not enjoy the full body of it as much.  Overall, bang for the buck this is a great RIS.

The bitterness at the finish is one of the things that makes this stout unique- much more pronounced than others that I am familiar with. Some pleasant alcohol at the end. Nice taste.  Body is the weak part of the beer for me. Full bodied, but has a strange carbonation to it that makes it feel very ""hollow"": seems to have a lot of space in it. Aside from the weight, feels a bit like soda. Unusual feel, and not my favourite. I could see how others would enjoy it, however.  Overall, very good beer.

Just a trace of citrusy/piney hops.  T - Loads of bitter roasted malt and strong espresso. In the end I get a tiny alcohol bite and some piney hops. I'm not getting any chocolate notes though. Savory and complex. Nice full mouth feel and adequate carbonation.  O - I've had a lot of RIS's that have very similar aromas and flavors. This sticks out a bit.

Could smell hops during the pour, but not much is present after the head dissipates. A bit of mild pine is present. I could not detect any alcohol via the smell.  Flavor: A heavy dose of roasted malts. Bitter coffee, followed by sweet chocolate. Usually it's sweet before bitter, but it's not a bad thing here. The bitterness is only moderately high. The finish is slightly dry, sweet and roasty, semi-sweet chocolate. No alcohol taste present, it is wonderfully masked by the thick roasted malts and slight bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Full body, silky smooth. Just enough carbonation.  Overall Impression: I've had this one several times, just now finally taking the time to complete a formal review. Not quite what I remembered, or what I expected from an American brewed RIS. More sweet than bitter, for sure. This brew only gets better as it warms up, all the way to room temperature.

T: I get tons of dark chocolate. Subtle hints of dark fruits on the first few sips, but they soon get overrun by the roastyness. Plenty bitter, in fact probably the most bitter RIS I've had. Burnt malts. Alcohol blends well with the flavors; it lets you know its a pretty big beer. You can feel a warming sensation in the back of your throat. Finishes dry with lingering char. As it warms it gets sweeter, of course. Simple, but hits the spot.  M: Pretty heavy feeling in the mouth. Sticky, syrupy, yet slick and oily and with just the right amount of carbonation.

Nice tan head that dissipates fairly quickly. Aroma is a medley of smoke, roasted malts, dark cocoa with hints of roasted coffee. Taste is a very interesting blend of bitterness, which is definitely hop based. Interesting notes of bitterness akin to some seriously dark coffee mixed with the hop bitterness. I have to admit, this is probably one of the most hoppiest RIS I have had so far. This is an interesting concoction. The alcohol makes it warm presence felt halfway through the stout. Nice lacing along the insides of the glass. Overall, I would say this is a stout worth trying. Probably one of the most complex RIS. I am thinking I will age this and see how it evolves.

Smells of coffee, some roasted malts, mostly coffee.  Tastes like coffee, mellow roasted malts, some bitterness and a touch of sourness but those last two aren’t overwhelming.

Slightly sweet smell but thick, rich and warming smell.  T-- Carmel, lactose sweetness and coffee. Sweetness drops off pretty quickly and changes to coffee bitterness. Slight bit of hops in the taste but they drop off quickly.  M-- Slick and oily with a lot of coffee bitterness. Medium feel and low carbonation. Mid back palate get bits of Carmel sweetness again. There are some sharp hops in the back of the mouth to offset the coffee and the sugar taste.  O-- Solid. Not outstanding but solid. Fresh this must be a hoppy creature.

345,1013,zac16125,4.05,"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass Best Before: 3/25/2015  A: An opaque, jet black, as is expected. Poured (apparently too aggressively, as I had to stop midway through the pour ) to give a massive 4 fingers width of bubbly mocha colored head that takes forever to dissipate down. A solid 5 min passes before the head dissipates down to a level that allows it to be drank, about a fingers width, which then remains throughout the drink. Leaves nice, spotty lacing all the way down the glass.  S: Strong roasted malt aromas, along with some chocolate. Hints of dark fruit, and a subtle smokiness, as well as an alcohol presence.  T: The first sip is a big roasted character up front, which continues all the way into the aftertaste. There is some sweetness in the form of a milk chocolate flavor, as well as an espresso character. About 1/3 of the way into the drink a big bitterness comes out on the back end. It is very prominent and masks some of the flavor complexities. The rest of the drink consists mostly of a big roasted flavor up front, followed by the bitterness on the back end. It doesn’t make the taste bad, and I’d certainly prefer a hop bitterness over the heavy alcohol flavor that is present in a lot of stouts, but I do think the bitterness tends to come out a little strong and dominate the flavor profile. That being said, the taste is quite good. It just could be better.  M/D: Medium bodied, with an oily mouth feel that also leaves the lips feeling sticky. There is a pretty significant amount of carbonation for the style, so its not as smooth as some of the other RIS I have had. However, it is very easy to drink and does a nice job of masking the almost double digit ABV. Better drinkability than most beers of its style.  O: Overall, a pretty solid RIS. It is not my favorite one, but it is better than most I have tried. Putting it side by side with Old Rasputin (which I tried just a few days ago, and seems to be the prototype RIS), I think Storm King slightly edges it out.

Smell and taste were of coffee with some hopiness. Was fairly sweet. Did not taste the alcohol much.  Mouthfeel was smooth but full bodied. Lingered on the palette awhile for a while and left the lips a bit sticky.  In my limited experience with RIS' this was a great one.

Totally opaque. Pours with a beige colored, one-finger head that fades rather quickly. Loads of sticky lacing left on the side of the glass.  S - A burnt or roasted malt aroma. Smells pretty hoppy, too.  T - A combination of burnt malts, chocolate and a bit of coffee. This is a rather hoppy and bitter stout. Not quite as sweet as other stouts I've had but still pretty tasty. The flavors really show through as the beer warms up. The alcohol is well disguised.  M - A medium consistency. A nice coating of flavors is left after each sip. Slightly bitter aftertaste.  O - A pretty good stout. Not up to the same level of Old Rasputin, in my opinion, but a very enjoyable brew. I'd purchase again which is my barometer if a beer is good or not. Recommended.  Cheers!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,genitempo,3.93,"A: Pours on the heavier side, just right for a stout. Black-bodied, tan head (about an inch, on a good pour). Heavy rings on the lace, so much it almost creates a wall (expected with a beer over 9% ABV). Presents well.  S: Dark chocolate and heavy espresso push. Definitely can smell the roasted elements of the brew, as well.  T: Shows it's hand early. Very complex arrangement of espresso and hops. Mid-level carbonation. The alcohol shows it's face on the tail.  M: Cream and carbonation. Let the drink sit of a bit. Still very well done though.

T- Chocolate starts out the flavoring, but a sweeter taste. Roasted coffee notes blend nicely in the background. Some bitterness creeps in at the end but doesn't deter from the flavors to much. Basic flavors detected, nothing over the top, but very nice.  M- Not quite full body. Moderate carbonation. Slight bitterness to it that sticks with you.  O- Very nice middle of the road, solid RIS.

Pours a rich mahogany color with a frothy tan head that results in delicate, spotted lacing on side of glass. Complex aromas of raisins, plums, roasted malts, floral hops, coffee and caramel.  Opens big with assertive notes of dark roasted malts and, unusual for the style, dominant flavors of bittering floral hops. Full bodied with an ultra-creamy mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. Hints of buttered pumpernickel, dark chocolate and espresso surface. Suggestions of molasses, toffee and caramel emerge, followed by a hint of brown sugar. High ABV kicks in as it warms. Finishes slightly dry with a kiss of bourbon.  So many interesting characteristics combine to form this unique taste profile, making Storm King one of my all-time favorite beers within a style I'm seldom enamored with.

Tastes a lot like the smell. Roasted malt and rich chocolate. A little coffee mixed with some faint alcohol taste.  Thick, rich mouthfeel. Bit of carbonation, but I pick up more the thickness of the beer.  Overall, a pretty serviceable RIS.

345,1013,StoutHunter,2.86,"I bought a bottle of Victory's Storm King Stout last weekend for $2.19 at The Lager Mill. After trying a couple different beers from Victory with them all turning out good I decided to really put them to the test and see how their RIS stands up to the rest. It had a best enjoy by date of March 2nd 2016. Poured from a 12oz brown bottle into a imperial pint glass.  A- The label looks good, the hawk or eagle wearing a crown is pretty eye catching. It poured a dark looking motor oil black that didn't let any light through. It had four and a half fingers worth of fluffy light brownish tan colored head that died down to a thick layer that stayed till the end and it left some nice rings of lacing.  S- The first thing I noticed about the aroma is that it is a little on the sweet side. The sweet roasted malts stand out the most and impart some black coffee, milk chocolate, a little bit of brown sugar, and a very slight amount of dark fruits. There was also a mild amount of grassy hops at the end.  T- Thankfully the flavor is not nearly as sweet as the aroma led me to believe. It starts out with a large amount of dark roasted malts that have just the right amount of sweetness to them. The coffee and chocolate flavors are there but they aren't as bold as I was expecting and the dark fruit flavors were barely there. The finish was pretty heavy on the grassy and earthy hops and it made for a pretty bitter finish, I wasn't thinking this was going to be that bitter and I think I would like it better if the bitterness was toned down.  M- Smooth and medium full bodied, its full but it isn't sticky and heavy. The carbonation was a little out of hand in this brew and could have be toned down a couple notches.  Overall I thought this was an Ok stout but it really can't hang with any of my other favorite RIS's. It's a solid RIS, but to me it lacks the balance and complexity of some of the better RIS's. This beer was going in the right direction but I feel like those dark roasted malts could have been more robust and the bitterness was just too much for this brew and that threw it off balance. It went down fairly smooth but that excess bitterness would prevent me from grabbing another one, the over the top bitterness of this beer doesn't make for good drinkability. I don't think I would buy this again, even though it is pretty much available year round to me I would much rather have an Old Rasputin. If you like hop heavy RIS's this may be your thing, but it wasn't my cup of tea. This beer just wasn't on the same level as their other beers that I have tried, maybe since it is one of my favorite style I am being a little to critical but compared to all the other RIS's on the market this one fall shorts. From my experience Victory has a heavy hand with their hops and in this case it didn't make for a great beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,MicroBeerMan1980,3.95,"A: Dark black and rich. Head is tan with mild retention and decent lacing around the glass.  S: Tons of malt, milk chocolate and notable roasted malts. Oak, vanilla and carobs chips.  T: There are a lot of wonderful black/chocolate roasted malts in this beer. The hops are very well balanced with the malt. There is a slight bite on the palate, but I think a lot of this comes from the dark malts. I'm thinking I should pair this with a 2003 Fonseca Reserva Especial.  M: It's round and slightly palate heavy. However, it's not chalky or over bearing. It's like the first time you turn on the heat for the winter.

In the background are a light smokiness and some mild hop tones.  T: Consists mainly of a smoky espresso flavor supplemented by a mild chocolate aftertaste. There is a noticeable amount of hop bitterness even behind the strong coffee flavors. The aftertaste is moderate in length and fairly bitter with a noticeable alcohol flavor.

S - Some light chocolate and bitter roasted malts. Get some light smokeyness and maybe some hops too.  T - Surprising amount of hop bitterness. This is drinking more like a black IPA than a RIS. Theres some nice espresso and chocolate malt notes, a bit of charring to, but the hop is throwing me off.  M - Not heavy or syrupy, nor is this thick and creamy. Its somewhere between creamy and refreshing. The ABV is hidden rather well.  O - Overall this is a fairly solid stout that is readily available.

345,1013,rickyleepotts,4,"The head on this beer is thick… and dark. Very dark. But that’s a good sign for a stout. I like that we have been able to try some authentic Russian stouts on this journey. Not beers from Russia, just the style. A Russian stout is MUCH more powerful on the nose and the tongue, providing a much better experience for the person lifting his (or her) glass.  I have had some beers from Victory before, just not this one. But as dark as this beer sits in the glass, I am excited to try it. Plus, it smells amazing.  You are hit with flavor immediately, and as the beer climbs it’s way back your palate, the flavors just begin to explode in your mouth. Then, out of nowhere, is a little sweetness to settle with a dry, bitter aftertaste. It’s like a joy ride through my mouth. And that aftertaste sticks around… for a LONG time. Which is completely fine with me, as this beer has a huge ABV.  This is a great beer; well done Victory. To read that a brewmaster likes to experiment, and be creative with his beers… well, you can experiment on me anytime. I love trying new beers. And this one is no exception.

An amazing balance of grapefruit/citrus hops and roasted malts. Coffee and grapefruit don't intuitively sound good together but it's a top notch brew. A bit of smokeyness too.

Pretty much black, totally opaque, a nice dense 1.5 finger creamy beige head that lasts for a few minutes and leaves some lacing in its wake. Aroma is surprisingly full of floral hops with some roasted malt and alcohol warmth, also picking up faint hints of root beer (?). My kind of RIS. On the sharp and bitter side, with dark roasted coffee and cocoa up front, hints of vanilla and tobacco in the middle and finishing with a crisp bitter kick from the slightly floral and spicy hops. Full-bodied with moderate yet slightly prickly carbonation which accents the hoppiness of the brew, but may detract from some of it malty complexity. This may be my favourite interpretation of the style thus far. Far from the richest RIS, it still delivers a fair degree of complexity and considerable flavour with an absurdly high drinkability.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

It has a tan coloured head of foam that clings to the glass after pouring to a depth of one finger before slowly retreating to film.  Smells initially of dark fruits, before piney hops come through. A little bit of coffee too, making an appearance.  The taste is relatively hoppy, tinged with some oak, chocolate and roasted malt. An interesting mix throughout. The alcohol seems relatively well hidden amongst everything else that is going on.  Nice mouthfeel, not overly thick and syrupy. Body is well suited to the style, but certainly not as big as a Dark Lord or Ten Fidy. Smooth, with the hops always making themselves known. Nice bit of bitterness to finish it off.

Even some dark fruit, maybe dark figs, and molasses, oak, and brown sugar seem to make an appearance. As it warms, lots of high alcohol & tarry rum-like aromas. Lots of roastiness in the flavor with some burnt character. Dark cocoa & chocolate flavor also persist. There are some hops in the flavor but they're layered underneath all that dark malt character. Mouthfeel is good. Appears like a medium-full beer that doesn't really show its ABV. A little acidic, maybe acrid tasting. A decent brew overall.

Taste: Big roasted malt tones and earthy bitterness. Hops are evident in the flavor, pine, citrus, alittle fruity, American variety for sure. The astringent charred malt, alcohol, and tobacco notes all meld together and deliver a woodsy earthy flavor. Dark, bitter coffee. A complexity seldom found in a typical stout. As it warms, the malts are more dominating, and the coffee flavor comes out more fully.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, smooth, carbonation is right for this beer. Exhibits a fine effervescence.

Eventually dissipated to leave a coating. Very dark opaque brown in color.  S - Malty tones in the smell, nothing really special though.  T - Strong roasted malt flavors.  M - Strong bite on the back of the tongue but very little warming for the ABV.  Overall this was a really good imperial stout. Nothing really special to me though to make it stand out. Solid beer none the less.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

The smell is amazing mostly hops like a black IPA a little malt an some coffee. The taste falls a bit short the hops are really hiding behind the bittering coffee. I picked this brew up because I was looking for a hop forward stout. It's good but not great. Good carbonation and mouthful not too oil-like. Alcohol really gets noticeable as it settles. Not a bad beer but there are more complex stouts that are cheaper.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

The hops are present on the finish to go along with an alcohol burn.  M- Nice creamy texture that came alone with great carbonation.

Nice brown head and decent head retention.  Roasted malt backed up by a decent amount of hop character. Dark fruits, grapes, chocolate all mixing well for a pleasant aroma.  Roasted malt, burnt coffee, caramel, bitterness from the hops and grapes. The aftertaste is a little acidic and metalic.  Medium body, light carbonation, leaves the lips sticky. No alcohol burn whatsoever.  Average taste and slightly above in the mouth feel. The aroma is the true winner in this brew. I feel the tastes were subdued by the aftertaste of metal. I feel like the flavors were trying to reach out but fell short. Even though it was a average tasting Stout, the rest of the factors keep this from being an average brew all around.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

A- thick dark (almost) black body (subtle hints of brown); foamy 1&1/4 finger tan head which very slowly reduced to a thick pasty lace. I poured this bottle fresh and cold fromthe fridge- but let it sit 10 minutes to warm a bit prior to drinking. During that time the lace never got thin enough for the black brew to poke through the surface.  S- sweet malts- hints of caramel, dark molasses, alcohol.  T- thick and malty up front- but the alcohol sneaks in from the rear and manhandles the finish.  M- nice full body, good tart grip on the palette- nice fizz.

The pour results in a solid obsidian topped by a finger of tan foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, molasses, maple syrup, cocoa, light smoke, and a touch of cedar. The taste brings in more of the same, but with a more pronounced hop character: pine and balsa provide a hoppy foil to the darkness surrounding them. The body is a stolid, heavy-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a relatively smooth feel. Overall, a very nice stout, one that deviates from the completely roasty and chocolatey path, but not entirely, opting instead for a best-of-both-worlds kinda thing.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

345,1013,Jeffo,3.07,"Pops originally picked this one up for me in PE a while back. Thanks dad!  From a bottle into a snifter.  APPEARANCE: Pours out dark brown, transparent, and yields a small, medium looking, beige head with decent retention. Black body, slightly transparent, with no carbonation evident. A slight ring remains until the end but leaves no lacing down the glass. Pretty average at best.  SMELL: Roasted malts, some pure coffee beans, perhaps some hints of espresso, and some crisp, citrus hop notes. Very hoppy actually. Some dark chocolate notes, but quite bold and hoppy for a stout.  TASTE: Some roasted malt, espresso notes and some sharp citrus hop flavors. A good dose of bitter hops at the swallow and a stronger, boozy finish on this one. Quite hoppy with some citrus and grapefruit notes under the roasted base. Aftertaste is bold but short lived, with roasted, bitter citrus hop flavors and some boozy qualities. Alright, but a little too boozy for the ABV.  PALATE: A little light, with a lighter than average body and higher levels of carbonation for the style. Creamy on the palate, goes down fine and finishes slightly dry on the palate. A little too light and slightly too much carbonation for the style, but not off putting.  OVERALL: A decent and enjoyable imperial stout, but not nearly as good as everyone makes it out to be. Quite a strong hop presence on this one, and a good roasted, malt base as well. A little too boozy and too light of a palate to make this one memorable, but enjoyable non-the-less. One worth checking out. Thanks again for the hookup pops.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

There is also a nice hop character and some dark fruit notes as well.  T - The taste is of dark roasted malts and coffee up front. There are some notes of chocolate, toffee, raisins, and some caramel as well. There is some hop bitterness that comes in towards the end and melds with the roasted malt bitterness. The finish is roasty and hoppy, with some lingering bitterness. There is also a touch of booziness as well.  M - This has a medium to full body and moderate carbonation. It has a rich and creamy feel to it, and goes down easy. There is some hop bitterness that sticks to the palate in the finish. Also, there is a touch of alcohol warmth.  O - This has good drinkability. I'm sure I could knock back a few of these over the course of an evening. I think this is another solid brew from Victory. I recommend giving this one a shot.

S: Hops, milk chocolate, maybe some coffee as well. Not a terribly complex smell, but its really appealing nonetheless.  T: Bitter hops up front, a bit of raisins, dark bitter chocolate, and a bit of alcohol heat. I must admit that even as a confessed hop-head, the aggressive hop profile seems oddly paired with the strong stout flavors.  M: Medium bodied, lots of crisp carbonation on the tongue, and while finishing dry, the taste leaves a long aftertaste of bitterness and some chocolate.

Smell - chocolate, malts, coffee, smoke  Taste & Mouth - The beer has an above average amount of carbonation and most of the taste consists of chocolate, smoke, coffee and malts. There is also lots of hop taste that I didn’t pick up on when smelling the beer. The beer finishes with a chocolaty slightly bitter hop aftertaste  Overall – The alcohol was very well hidden on this beer and it is dangerously drinkable.

T-Charred malt with hops (citrus) lead, a bit of coffee, dark fruit and chocolate in the middle. But the malt and hops stay throughout. Hoppier than most stouts I've had.

I sincerely enjoyed to give this beer a chance becuase I now I know that this beer caused most of the things Black Xantus gets blamed for... Thanks Jeff!  From a 12 oz bottle.  Opens with a big hiss. Hooray we've got carbonation. Comes out Coca Cola black with a tan half finger foam that doesn't do much.  Loads of hops on the nose. I like. Little bits of caramel and or dark fruits.  On my first sip is where I get dissapointed the most. This baby has no body at all. A bit creamy it is and plenty of carbonation with a dry finish and something I have to discribe as emptiness.  Flavors are of hop biterness, roasted coffee and chocolats. Nice flavors actually....  Aftert the first sip I can really relate to my sons feelings on Christmas morning when he opened a present that held clothes instead of a toy...

345,1013,zeledonia,3.11,"Bottle 22 Nov 2010.  Pours very dark brown, not quite black but close, and completely opaque, with a bubbly medium-tan head that recedes pretty quickly and leaves good lacing.  Smell is surprisingly faint for such a big, thick beer. I get mostly dark roasted malts (chocolate) with a fruity hop aroma (orange) coming through behind it. Also pick up a bit of the alcohol.  The flavor, however, is not faint. Not by any stretch. Rich and heavy, with a pronounced bitterness. Bitter chocolate, followed by bitter hops, then char, with a hint of unpleasant grapefruit rind sharpness. Very little fruit besides that, though. This is all on top of a strong dark roasted malt frame. The char bitterness lingers for a while, sliding above and below the line between good and bad.  Mouthfeel is fairly heavy; probably in the middle range for imperial stouts. Thick but smooth, with a bit of fluff from the carbonation that lightens it up. Quite good; except that it keeps that unpleasant bitterness on the tongue for far too long.  I mostly like this beer. It looks good and feels good. Smells decent. Definitely on the hoppy, bitter side, which is fine. Lacking a bit in complexity. But mostly, I can't get past this sharp citrus rind / charcoal bitterness. My opinion of it declined steadily as I made my way through the glass and that flavor asserted itself more.

The initial aromas were of dark fruits, hops, coffee beans and caramel. The initial flavors were of a deep roasty character, specifically composed of coffee beans and burnt caramel. The finish was a burnt and roasty lingering flavor. The brew warmed the nose and was full bodied with light carbonation (simply perfect.)

I do get the earthy hops in the middle of this one but only for a second.  M: Full and creamy  O: Looked pretty good, smelled pretty good, but was just too burnt in the taste for me.

Not overpowering to the nose.  The taste, however, is overpowering and complex and big. Right off the bat, big roasted malts hit you like a hammer followed by way more hops than you would normally expect out of this style. It is, in fact, very hoppy for any style. But it makes it work. Like the bottle says, it's very robust. The hops work at balancing out the malts, but in the end it actually seems like the hops win out. Ok by me because I'm a hophead, but for some stout lovers, this may come as an unpleasant surprise. Mouthfeel is creamy at first, but crisp in the hoppy finish, resulting in a nice, full-bodied beer.

In the end of the sniff there is a sweet liqueur or bourbon smell.  T - Lots of citrus hops flavor up front, followed by coffee and roasty notes that turn acrid. In the end there is some vanilla and then more hops, smoke and coffee in the aftertaste.  M - Moderate body. Strong burning hop bitterness combines with burnt notes to give a very astringent mouthfeel. Unexpectedly dry finish.  D - Overall a very drinkable Imperial Stout, which is usually an oxymoron.

Light coffee, sweet chocolate, roasted malt and molasses round it off. Has the musty quality of a dark English ale. Nice smelling RIS..different, but good.  T: Wow. Sweet molasses and chocolate quickly give way to those citrus hops. There's actually quite a lot going on in the after taste for me. Roasted malt, coffee, more chocolate, citrus and that musty taste.

But, the head generally sticks around as a foamy top over the body.  Roasted malts, chocolate, and some minor notes of coffee and hops make up the aroma. Smells good, like a RIS.  Tasty blend of flavors that follow the aroma, and tends toward the sweeter side in this pour. The chocolate is prominent and smooth; the coffee is understated but adds to the overall blend, and the hops in the background give just enough balance to create a good overall mix of the flavors.

Smells of roasted malt, cocoa, coffee, toasted grains, caramel, chocolate, light floral hops, grass, cardboard or wet bread and faint alcohol; there is a charcoal aroma that indicates this is a strong beer.  Tastes of roasted malts, cocoa, burnt coffee, toasted grains, caramel, chocolate, light floral or citrus hops, grass, burnt toast, brown sugar, tea leafs, grass or other earthy notes like straw, light vanilla and alcohol like rum. The hop presence was very weak and the toasted malts dominated the palate, and the bitter finish is like a strong coffee.  Mouthfeel is creamy and oily slick with a heavy body, yet it slides down easy with little carbonation and very tasty feel since the malts, coffee and cocoa flavors wash over everything at first and set the tone for this beer.  Good drinkability for an imperial stout, even though the alcohol is present, the roasted complex malt combo made this a very enjoyable stout for me.

Sweet but dry finish. Additional notes of chocolate and earth, as well as dried fruit when its nice and warm. Smooth, dry finish. Complex but easy to enjoy.  In the relative ballpark of one of my ""go to"" Russian Imperial Stouts -- Old Rasputin. I think this hides its alcohol a bit more than Old Rasputin but misses a bit of the depth.

T - A nice tase, very well balanced with some extra carbonation taking away some of the heaviness but still a roasted taste throughout.  M - Feels good in the mouth, kind of covers the whole pallet with some chocolate sweetness, roasted flavors and a very light ale feel as well.  Overall a good beer. It seems to strike a balance between an Imperial Stout and a few of the Black IPA's I've had. I think you'll either love it or hate it, I would try it again. I bet it would be even better on tap.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,bucklemyshoe,4.03,"12 oz bottle at 48 degrees into a Stone IRS tulip. Best by: 12/14/2014 (Bottled 12/14/2009).  A: It pours pitch black with two fingers of tan head that holds and laces very well.  S: It is very hop forward (cascade?) with notes of espresso, chocolate, and enticing caramel.  T: The aging has actually produced a negative effect on this. The hops have faded quite a bit and the caramel maltiness is a bit stronger than I prefer. Dark chocolate, smooth espresso, and sweet dark fruits round it out.  M: The body is bit thinner and the carbonation is heavier than expected.  O: Due to the ""malt bomb"" effect of the faded hops, I'd certainly prefer this fresh. It is a quality brew either way.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Bunkles,4.29,"One of my favorite beers, cracked one tonight after work and decided I should finally get around to reviewing it.  Storm King pours almost pitch black with a tiny head that fades almost immediately. In short, it tells you right up front it's an imperial stout. Smell is wonderful, strong aroma of malts come bursting forth, with another scent I can't quite place. The taste is what keeps me coming back to this beer time and time again. Absolutely wonderful blend between the malt and hops on this beer. (definitely one of the hoppier stouts out there) Dark, deep taste that comes out of the strong malt presence, but followed up very nicely by a hop burst that keeps the beer in check. Mouthfeel is great, sits on the tongue wonderfully and doesn't feel thick or heavy at all.  Overall, one of my favorite beers, and one of the best values of the Imperial Stout world. Whenever the inevitable ""best imp. stout for the money?"" threads comes up, Storm King, Old Rasputin, and Brooklyn BCS tend to run away with the topic. I put Storm King first of these values.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,azdback,4.03,"Thanks to turfy for this one. Poured into a large tulip glass. Deep dark black color. I can't get any light through this, not any highlights at all. Large three finger, coco colored head. Sticky and I'm sure the lace will stick around. It did, in patches like Chester the Molester's hairline.  Smell is kind of tart, with some coffee and chocolate coming through. Molasses sweet.  The taste is kind of tart up front, like a dried cherry and turns into a deep rich roasted black cup of coffee. Some chocolate and sweets come out at the end. Not a hint of alcohol at this moment. I'll let it warm and report back ... Nope!  The mouth is as expected for an RIS. Rich, full, not as chewy as I would like. It's kind of dry at the end.  Overall this is a good RIS, but not a great one. This has become such a crowded style that I have to save my elite scores for the elite brews. I do recommend if you get the chance to buy it.. buy it!!

A - Pours black with a creamy light brown 1 finger head, leaving little lacing.  S - Has the aroma of dark, roasty fruits. Rasins and plums is what I'm getting off of this one.  T - Has a very unique flavor for a stout, almost sweet, but still kinda citrusy. Almost like a chocolate covered orange. This is really hard to describe. It is almost like a hybrid of an IPA and a stout. Malty, but still hoppy. Alcohol taste is present as well.  M - Medium mouthfeel with good carbonation.  O - What a unique brew this is.

345,1013,otto251068,2.78,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Rochefort chalice. ""Enjoy by Nov 08, 2015"" printed on the bottle, making this bottle (according to my research) about six months old.  Appearance: A very dense, dark, chocolate brown head rises to about the width of a finger. It really takes it's time to fade, but once it does there are only a few blotches left. The beer itself is pitch black, and only a sliver of dark brown is detectable when held up to the light. A ring of foam clings to the inside of the glass.  Smell: A little surprised by the level of hops, the first thing I smelled when I cracked the top. Once I get beyond the them, there are the toasted malts. After the pour it really opens up, similar to what is mentioned before, only more aromatic and noticeable. The hops have a bit of grassy, outdoors, wheaty characteristics. A touch of sourness makes itself present.  Taste: Charred malts completely take over, really dominating the flavors from the start to finish. Once I get beyond them there is some dark, unsweetened chocolate, and some coffee bitterness. Some of the bitter, grassy hops eventually fight their way to the front.  Mouthfeel: Medium body with a high carbonation level. The body is pleasant, maybe just a touch on the thin side. The carbonation level becomes very foamy inside the mouth. A good bit of bitterness lingers after the swallow, really sticking to the back of my throat.  Overall: Heavy and harsh charcoal through out, from start to finish. This beer has a good aroma and looks great in a glass, but the burnt flavors are simply too overwhelming for me, although, it does completely hide the alcohol. A bit of a chore to finish this 12 oz bottle.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

T: Bitter up front with a sweetness that gives way to the charred, smoky and more bitter characteristics. Aftertaste is dark chocolate, burnt toast and bitter black coffee.  M: Mouthfeel is medium and creamy. Carbonation is low. Alcohol is barely noticeable.  D: Medium. As with most RIS, I need to take my time and only enjoy one of the course of an evening.

Head is sticky and thick, and takes forever to settle.  Aromas of sweet chocolate, with hints of roasted coffee. Some plum aromas. Floral hops. Loads of dark malt scents, and some alcohol aromas.  A DIPA amount of hops hits you in the face, with flavors of pine and citrus. Espresso bitterness. Semi-sweet chocolate mid-palate leads to some more hop bitterness and a very biting, alcoholic finish.  This beer is screaming for balance. The finish is overly alcoholic and off-putting for me. It's almost at rubbing alcohol levels.

The smell of this one is rich toffee with some rich dark raisins and chocolate mixed in.  The taste of this one is a small hop assault on the palate at first but nothing more than a subtle ambush followed by the nice roasted malts and finally a little expresso flow going through to the aftertaste which is a coffee tinged hop bitterness.  The mouthfeel of this one was a wet medium feel during the drink that ended in a dry finish.

Might be some coffee flavors in there too.  Mouthfeel: Feels real thick, with probably a medium carbonation.  Drinkability: Very satisfying experience overall.

S: A little citrus, followed by huge whiffs of roast, coffee, chocolate, licorice, and a little dark fruit. A slight whiff of alcohol as well.  T: As the nose goes, so does the taste.

345,1013,Allpe45,3.63,"Purchased during my travels along with some others that aren't available in this state. Enjoy by July 15, 2015  Some light permeates it during the pour, giving it a reddish hue, but it appears jet black in the glass with glorious mocha-brown head which rises all the way to the top of the snifter, despite a semi-gentle pour. It dissipates shortly to leave thin spots of lacing in various shapes and sizes all around.  Extreme hoppiness, combined with roasted malts and undertones of coffee, makes for a very interesting smell.  Just like in the smell, the taste of hops really asserts its dominance over everything else. This is definitely the hoppiest tasting imperial stout I've ever had a chance to taste. Starts off earthy and citrusy, with roasted malt and burnt espresso poking their heads in, and hop bitterness carrying all the way through and residing long after each sip.  Medium bodied with light carbonation, fine, but there's an intense lingering feeling, like the entire inside of my mouth is puckering. Must be the bitterness.  The 9.1% ABV is very well masked. The lingering mouthfeel makes this pretty hard to drink for me. It's an interesting brew with its brutal hoppiness. It is fairly drinkable but not quite what I was expecting. There is a time and a place for this beer, and I would gladly drink it again, but not until I get to that time and place.  I wish black IPAs (I mean cascadian dark ales, I mean American black ales, I mean American style India black ales, I mean lol) were more similar to this beer, rather of the wave of hoppy porters that have been coming out.

Still, it has enough force behind it to punch a hole through the remaining shell of a New England winter. Good color; the dull-sheen blackness here is on a scale with a fistful of black Twizzlers. Its weighty, malty stoutness is nicely offset by a light-handed hoppy edge, bitter enough to dry things out but not enough to offend.

345,1013,GarthDanielson,3.95,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, this beer has an amazing cascade on a center pour. Giving me a good vibe early on! The beer is an opaque brown-almost-black coloring with a chocolate milk colored head that appears to be light, airy, and bubbly. The head condenses down to around a 2 finger mark by the time I start drinking, and the retention is very decent. Also, this beer is leaving an impressive lacing on the glass as it goes down into my belly. The nose is a tad bit boozey, which is fine by me, as well as a little chocolatey and a lot of molasses. Further smells give off a mocha-type aroma. The beer is light and dry in mouth, carrying strong coffee flavors immediately onto the tastebuds. That bitterness of dark roast is counteracted by a slight choco-molasses sweetness that is extremely subtle. The alcohol is present in the taste as well, but again, very subtle. There are also some brown sugar/vanilla hints buried in there. The beer is quick on the tongue, and the finish is crisp and sharp with the bitter coffee aftertaste. This is a tasty stout, and I would imagine would be great in the northeast winters. Very tasty!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

The sweetness from the sugar and fruits comes in immediately on the tongue, but quickly succumbs to to roasty malts, coffee, and a very nice quantity of hops. The aftertaste is wholly bitter, primarily from the earthy hops and coffee.  The mouthfeel is full-bodied with a fairly high level of carbonation from the style. It's also quite drying.

345,1013,russwbeck,4.28,"As always, my official numbers represent the freshest version of the beer I've had, the others are just for reference.  3/05/11 Review  A: Black pour with a big, fluffy, sticky, brown head. Retention is wonderful, as is the lacing. 4.5  S: Far more hops than I expected. Roasted malts, with a hint of coffee in the background. 4  T: Hops are much less noticeable in the taste. Roasted malts and perhaps some chocolate up front give way to a nice coffee taste. 4.5  MF: Dry aftertaste, medium carbonation and bodied. 4  D: Alcohol is hardly noticeable, dryness keeps you coming back. 4  2011 and 2012 enjoyed side by side on 9/21/12  2011:  A: The 2011 has a much larger brown head, but that might have been due to a better pour. Fluffy and strong, not unlike chocolate milk on top of a black pour. Lacing and retention are phenomenal. 4.5  S: Molasses and dark fruits have come out big time on the aged version. Chocolate and booze rest underneath. The hoppiness of the fresh version is nowhere to be found. The aroma overall is much more assertive, but less balanced. Really interesting progression between the two. 3.5  T: The taste could not be more different from fresh Storm King. The dark fruits and molasses, like in the aroma, are huge on the 2011. The roast is the second biggest change as it basically tastes like I'm eating coffee beans (which is actually something I enjoy...especially chocolate covered espresso beans, yum). It actually makes the underlying chocolate as enjoyable. The booze is pretty pervasive. I'd say I enjoy the taste of the 2012 version better as this is a bit all over the place...but I can say this might improve with a little more age. Certainly changing into a completely different beer that I'm excited to try again next year (as I put back a full 6er and this is only #2 enjoyed). 4  MF: Heavier body than the 2012 with much less carbonation felt on the tongue. The beer is velvety smooth on the palate and has much less of an aftertaste. The beer is a bit easier to drink, but doesn't quite satisfy me as much. 4  O: Not really that great of a beer, but I certainly wouldn't turn it down. As I said, I'm really excited to see this one develop further, but I'd say if you're aging a few...don't drink it after one year. I'd bet this gets better.  2012:  A: The head is a bit less impressive than the aged version, but still is top notch. Dark brown on top of a black pour, how I believe a Russian Imperial Stout should look. 4.5  S: Very nice chocolate, roasted malt, and fresh hoppiness. The booze is not nearly as noticeable as it is on the 2011, but some of the dark fruits are. Much more balance, and more inviting in my opinion. 4  T: The taste is as deep and balanced as I remember it from the first time I had it a year or so ago. The hops that permeate this beer fresh are really impressive and I'm sure have faded with time. The taste starts off with chocolate up front which is followed by a smack of hops and is finished with some roasted malt that resembles coffee. The combination of roast and hop bitterness linger on the palate for a good long while. 4.5  MF: Medium body with an above average amount of carbonation that tingles the mouth. For me, the balance and depth of the flavors make it a really drinkable RIS. That, combined with the 9.1% ABV that you can hardly taste makes this a winner all around. 4.5  O: Honestly, it's better than I remember it and probably one of my favorite non-barrel aged RIS. Can't believe something this good is sitting in bottle shops across Pennsylvania, which is typically a beer wasteland. Don't skip this next time you pass it. 4.5",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

345,1013,TCgoalie,4.15,"Finally got around to reviewing this. The pour is lovely, featuring an off white 2 fingers of head across a large oversized snifter. Black in color of course.  Oak, vanilla, chocolate, brown sugar, and pine hops are in the smell. The hops are much more pronounced that in most stouts.  Much like the smell, oak is a large player in the taste. Some dark chocolate and maybe a pinch of vanilla creep in. In come the hops after that, a large amount of pine hops to be exact.  The feel is nice being medium-full-ish in the mouth. I enjoy the soft character and efficient carbonation.  Overall, this is a solid stout worthy of a try from all craft drinkers.

345,1013,JohnQVegas,4.19,"Bottle into The Bruery tulip. Best By date of Oct, 2015. Heh.  Pours impenetrably black, none more black, black as the abyss, black as... you get the picture. Makes other black beers look pale. Two-finger brown head on top settles quickly into a dense, creamy cap that has ridiculous retention. Nice, delicate lacing. This one looks simply amazing.  Nose is full of citrusy hop aromas, grapefruit coming through most prominently. Lightly roasty with a bit of baker's chocolate. Really though, the massive, lightly astringent bite of the piny, grapefruity hops dominates.  Taste starts with the same massive hop presence. Big, floral grapefruit over a moderately astringent rindy bitterness. Underneath, smooth, intense roast melds with mellow baker's chocolate, so dry and deeply roasted it's almost a bit ashy. Intense but refined, this one is an edgy blend but still manages to avoid being to coarse or brash. Alcohol is nicely reserved. Finish is long, packed with citric hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel is full bodied, creamy, a bit cut by the massive citric hop presence.  Nicely drinkable. Big, bold, and intensely hoppy, but not hard to drink at all. Alcohol stays largely hidden, flavors are smoothly balanced, though with this many IBUs and level of roastiness, there's only so much smoothness that's possible.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,cmq103,4.2,"Appearance: As with most RIS, the pour is dark and thick. If you pour from the bottle with a purpose, you can generate a moderate medium brown head, though is quickly dissipates to a thin ring. Moderate lacing clings to the side of the glass.  Smell: I read a lot of the reviews prior to actually buying this RIS. I agree that the hop presence definitely dominates this one. Mild chocolate & malty caramel, fading to a faint citrus aroma. Both the aroma and taste benefited as the beer warmed.  Taste: A ""right in your face"" bitter roasted chocolate hops. The bitterness follows through to the very end. Not in a bad way. Kind of what I expected and wanted from a fine Victory beer. The alcohol is hidden well with this, but make no mistake it's there to bring you to a happy place both in mind and taste. As mentioned before, the taste, for me, improved as the beer warmed.  Mouthfeel: Moderate carbonation, with a pretty amazing hop bite for a RIS. I do love the combination, as IPA and Stouts are two of my favorites.  Drinkability: Hell yeah, but a sipper for sure. I could easily see myself having a few of these on a quiet night where I just want to ponder the goodness the world has to offer.

A finger of light brown soapy head that slides back to the surface with a few large bubbles. Some light lacing that slowly slides back into the glass when swirled.  Nose is some milk chocolate, some roasted malts, slight licorice, and some earthy hops.  Taking a sip, milk chocolate on the tip of the tongue, slightly lactic, licorice is still there. Dark roasted malts and hop bittering lingers on the tongue after swallowing.  Medium bodied with lots of soft carbonation helps to provide a decent creaminess in your mouth. Flavors are well balanced, but not as bold as I like in an imperial stout. Fairly easy to sip on this, and the light warming effect helps on a cool evening here at home.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,carolinabeerguy,4.28,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a Cigar City snifter. Enjoy by November 8, 2015 printed on label.  Appearance: Pours a motor oil black with a 2 finger densely creamy mocha brown head reminiscent of a chocolate milkshake. Excellent head retention and lacing.  Smell: Chocolate and toasted malt, molasses and a hint of citrus and pine hops.  Taste: Bittersweet chocolate and resinous hops up front followed by toasted malt and caramel in the middle before ending with a blast of bitter citrus at the finish. Aftertaste is bitter hops and burnt toast. Very hoppy flavor for a stout and I like it.  Mouthfeel: Full-bodied and very creamy with a high amount of prickly carbonation. Excellent combination of the two elements.  Drinkability: High drinkability. While having multiple bottles in on sitting may not be ideal, you'll definitely enjoy the one your having. It's a sipper and one to savor.  Overall: Excellent beer overall. One of the best Russian Imperial Stouts on the market. I would highly recommend trying this one.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Smell is real nice with a pronounced hop aroma, followed by a fruity, specifically blackberry precence. Taste is fresh-like, dark burnt malt, a bit of alcohol, with a bitter finish.

Absolutely beautiful. Smell is of dark fruits, sweetened coffee, and cocoa powder. Taste is of burnt espresso/coffee, bittersweet chocolate, and slightly sweet cherry/plum. A lingering bitterness on the back of the tongue after each sip that stays with you for a while. Carbonation is good and does not take away from the thick, creamy feel of this beer. Overall, this is an absolutely delicious RIS that I will be revisiting again. I am glad this comes in 12 oz. bottles as the 9.1% ABV can sneak up on you.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,CASK1,4.31,"Happy Birthday to me! Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. About as black a beer as I've ever seen; truly opaque. Light tan head is dense and thick, with decent retention. Aroma is dominated by the roast malt. Coffee, dark chocolate, burnt toast are all evident. There is a low malty sweetness, and a subtle resiny, piney, hop aroma.  Flavor Is complex and well-balanced. Lots of roasted malt presents as coffee grounds, bitter chocolate. More malty sweetness than the aroma would suggest, with toffee and molasses. Hop bitterness is moderately high and builds in the finish. Some dark fruit esters show up that were missing in the aroma; fig, raisin. Low resiny hop flavor completes the flavor.  The mouthfeel is medium-full with medium carbonation. Despite the heavy initial mouthfeel, the beer finished fairly dry thanks to high hop bitterness in the finish and some roasted grain astringency.  I wouldn't want to put down a sixer at a sitting, but this is about as drinkable as a RIS can be. I will add this to my standard RIS lineup.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,droomyster,3.96,"12 oz bottle poured at cellar temperature into a red wine glass. Pours an impenetrable black with two fingers of brown head with excellent retention and an attractive frumpiness. Aromas are roasty and sweet, like a bunch of dark fruits that have been charred in a fire. Maybe a whiff of coffee grounds and dark chocolate if I use my imagination, but not to the extent of other members of its style. The complex flavors and weighty body redeem the simplicity of the nose. Flavors of intermingling roastiness, burnt sugar, dark chocolate, and bitter smoke amount to a winning combination. All in all, Storm King lives up to its name by offering a tasty and (given the high abv) efficient way to withstand the winter chill.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,VMWhelan,4.45,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Sierra Nevada tumbler.  Pours black with a one finger mocha head. Good lacing.  Smell is bitter hops, roasted malt, some toffee, and some dark chocolate.  Taste is very similar to the smell. Bitterness from the hops all around. A great coffee/dark chocolate and roasty flavor to back that up. The hops bring a nice citrusy fruitiness that goes very well with the roasty flavors. Very awesome.  Mouthfeel is on the heavier side of medium. Carbonation is just right. A little dry in the finish but not too substantial.  Drinkability is excellent, almost too much so. The alcohol is still there, even if it's hard to detect and it will knock you on your ass if you aren't careful.  This was the first imperial stout I had a good while back and I still come back to it occasionally.

Roasted malts are nice and strong, a bit of coffee comes through.  T - It's actually decently hop-forward before fading into a very roasted taste. I taste a decent amount of an espresso on the finish. As a coffee fan, I think it's great.  M - Not a ton of carbonation, but can feel it more in the throat than the mouth. Not entirely creamy, even a bit dry from the hops. Just a small burn from the alcohol.  D - I was impressed by how drinkable this RIS is, especially at 9.1%.  Overall - I actually really enjoyed this one, it's not the best RIS ever, as I desire one a bit more creamy, but I thought this was complex and well put together",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

S - I smell heavy dark chocolate and espresso. I also pick up a distinct cherry.  T & M- This is where the beer shines. Dark smooth malts throughout. You can find chocolate, coffee, caramel, molasses, and strong earthy notes. I rather enjoy the chocolate up front mixed with the coffee nose and then the carbination finishes off the taste by bringing in the fruity notes. Excellent full flavor and exactly what you want in a stout.  D - The alchohol is well balanced and I think it helps warm up the chocolate and earthy flavors.

Pours a lovely nighttime black color with a slow forming three finger head which is slow to rise, slow to fall. Abundant lacing.  Smells of chocolate and coffee, aroma isn't too enticing.  However, the aroma is deceiving as the beer certainly explodes on the palette. Chocolate and coffee mix with a strong leafy hop note and it all ends with a bitter and roasted aftertaste.

A lot of roasted coffee, chocolate, and burnt sugar/caramels. Very little bitterness with light carbonation and some flowery hops are slightly detectable. Thick, a bit chewy, but not syrupy or sticky at all. No detectable alcohol. Overall I really enjoy balanced RI stouts that are under 10% alcohol so I can enjoy more than one. I was amazed when I found this for $4 a pint at a local hole in the wall watering hole. Definitely recommended whenever you find it.

Nice roasty chocolate with a good, not over powering, alcohol flavor. Some hops and vanilla.  Mouthfeel- Good mouthfeel. I might like it a little thicker, but this is good how it is.  Drinkability- At 9.1% it is good that this is in a 12oz bottle, but I could easily drink a bomber and be satisfied.

345,1013,Jesse13713,3.29,"Appearance - Pours a thick and solid oily black. Not much head at all. It laces to the glass quite well and looks like your traditional imperial stout; only without a creamy head.  Smell - A hoppy coffee smell. This bitter of a smell isn't something I'm accustomed too in stouts. Smells quite malty.  Taste - Malty, chocolaty and hoppy. A delicious combination. Not sticky or milky at all. A little maltier than I expected for not being a coffee stout.  Mouthfeel - A little skunky but can hold its own. Medium to heavy bodied.  Drinkability - Perfect to sip in the dead of winter. A true imperial stout.  Verdict - While holding its own in many ways, I felt a little underwhelmed by the lack of complexity in this beer. It's taste was good, but not fantastic.

345,1013,AgentMunky,3.93,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a cervoise glass. Best by 28 September 2015.  A: About halfway through pouring, head erupts from nowhere, almost filling the glass. It's tan and thick, tiny bubbles looking almost crystalline. It fades fairly quickly, content to meld into the fearsomely dark body. No light is making it through this monster, even at the edges. Some sticky lacing. Blacker than night and impressive as hell.  S: Quite strong; it makes it way from the table in front of me to my nose. Sweet alcoholic topnotes, supporting espresso smells, and an odd soapiness, the only unpleasant element in the whole mix.  T: Odd. The soapiness reveals itself -- more pleasantly, I might add -- as heavy hopping. This first indication of flavour is quickly belied by the other tastes: chicory, chocolate, and coffee. A queer mix of flavours makes for one of the more intriguing (and definitely the hoppiest) imperial stouts I've come across. It took me a while to get used to it, but I have concluded that I like it. For me, the biggest criticism is the aftertaste, dominated by somewhat-less-than-pleasant hops and largely lacking any other sort of bitterness.  M: Not as thick as I might like, but good. The aftertaste is drying and the main body is smoothish, with brief patches of roughness and an acceptably-balanced level of carbonation.  D: Drinkable for an imperial stout, but not if you don't like hops. It's a well-made beer that (I feel) barely works. However, it *does* succeed, and it makes for a good glass.

Roasted flavors throughout. it's much like an Export stout is described.  M- Carbonation level is about perfect. there is more of a hop bite than I care for in an Impy stout, but it isn't offensive, actually comes out kinda nice. has a lingering bitter effect on the tongue.

345,1013,grover37,4.5,"12oz bottle with an Enjoy By date of 1/28/2015. I think that means it was bottled in January of last year so it's about 13 months old.  Appearance (4): Pours black with light brown around the edges into a DFH snifter. One finger of dark cream head with lots of bigger bubbles reduces to a thick ring and a big, mostly covering patch. Some sporadic patches of lacing.  Smell (4): Very pine forward hoppiness even though it's an aged bottle. A faint roast and still some ethanol.  Taste (4.5): Milk chocolate up front with pine. Very resinous pine in the middle and especially in the finish. A bit of char and definitely the roasted barley in the finish as well.  Mouthfeel (5): Creamy and full bodied with medium to low carbonation. The resinous hops coat the mouth and leaves an almost minty, strong fir flavor. The mouthfeel is great and the hops are stronger than nearly any stout I've ever had.  Drinkability (5): This is one of my favorite stouts. It is very drinkable for 9%+ with the alcohol being barely evident in the nose but not the taste. This one is even better fresh I think with the pine hops just bursting. I can't believe that they are still so forward over a year later.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Head is ochre, just beautiful, thick and dense with large bubbles on the top and sunk to a decent crown. Lace is quite nice, and sticky. Yeah, cracking imperial stout look.  Smell is really nice, but an odd character is hanging around, like some hobgoblin. Smells dark and roasty for the most part but a nice hoppiness to it as well, citric mostly. Touches of blackberry on there and a mild bready note. Makes for a fruity as well as dark and pleasant nose. Good.  Taste is nice; lots of dark roasty notes but they're not dominant or overexuberant at any point. Starts with a pear character that quickly turns darker, touches of espresso with some distinct blueberry flavours late on the mid and some cocoa and cola characters coming through as well. Mint, black pepper and a mild soapy touch make an appearance late. Pleasant palate with lots of good flavours.  A bit harsh at times on the mouthfeel, but a good body and good texture.

In the glass, it's pure black, with no light coming through, with brown edges to show it's not truly black. The head is very nice and large, about 2 fingers, with a very nice milk chocolate color. Fades down to a khaki wisp with time.  S: Smells of coffee (espresso), slight caramel, slight esters, and slight scent of alcohol soaked cherries, there is also a strong chocolate, but not so overpowering. Very complex, and inviting.  T/M: This is a truly interesting beer. The rush of hops to the palate immediately reminded me of a DIPA, with a nice citrus quality. Suddenly the onrush of dark chocolate, espresso, and a roastiness and slight smokiness. A delightfully complex brew. The citrus and chocolate flavors remind me of chocolate orange candy. A very slight warming sensation comes in from the alcohol, but it disappears just as quickly. There isn't a lot of carbonation, but a slight prickling appears. The mouthfeel is spot on, not thick, but sits perfectly on the palate. It is absolutely delightful.  D: Such a fantastic brew, well crafted, and delightfully complex. There are so many subtle nuances to this beer, its hard to appreciate it on it's first try. Not to mention, it hides the alcohol pretty well, and it goes down surprisingly well.

Pours a deep and dark, almost opaque black, with just a slight curling of brown at the edges to prove that it's not actually crude oil. Head is foamy and incredibly chunky and solid, leaving 3D images of cave structures on the inside of my glass. Looks very good indeed.  Nose is dark and roasty, but with a very pleasant and extremely unexpected hop fruitiness coming through. In fact, instead of the aroma reinforcing the darkness I expected, it leavens it, giving a wonderful mix of dark grains, and dark fruits. Plum, black peach and heavy raspberry. It's quite delicious.  The taste moves this away from the lightness and fruitiness of an IBA or ABA, giving a true astringent black roasted character to the mix. Here, the dark characters take centre stage, giving a slightly smoky, roasted and charred bitterness. Still, the feel is surprisingly light, and there is a character that leavens it from being thick and heavy. Feel is surprisingly light. Indeed, I think a heavier body would help the beer.  It's a very good beer, and one which interestingly exemplifies the American approach to the big styles. This one gives some unusual characters where they're not expected, and ends up with a fascinating and complex brew.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Smell is good, but I'd like something more out of it. Dark, smoke and malty aroma for the most part.  Taste is amazing. It has a very bold, dark chocolate bite right up front that mixes well with the carbonation. What's interesting is that it has a dry tail with that same dark chocolate taste, only faint.

345,1013,mrbeermug,4.14,"A - Pours a nice deep inky dark color befitting a proper Russian Imp Stout. Creamy/frothy caramel colored head that lingers with large bubbles.  S - Dry biting hops come through with a dark roasted malt earthiness and just a touch of currant or other earthy dried fruit. Not too complex or strong of a smell, though.  T - Deeply roasted, chocolatey, burnt, earthy bliss. The hops catch the burn malt backbone to create a nicely blended, dry, slightly bitter flavor with the roasted malt lingering forever on the tongue. No sweetness at all.  M - Soft and substantially-bodied without having any syrupy chewiness.  D - Incredibly well-balanced beer whose hops and malt come together in unison. Not hot or overly powerful either, so actually very drinkable for such a substantial and high ABV brew.

S - Good, but not as exceptional as some other heavier stouts. Rich chocolate mixes with a certain freshness that the booziness gives off. Subtle hints of coffee are also infused in the other two dominant smells and accents them nicely. T - Much more coffee is present in the taste. The coffee tastes bold and black, with a very roasted flavour. Notes of dark chocolate also add to the overall bitterness. M/D - Both score well.

345,1013,Auracom,4,"From notes. 12 oz. bottle on January 29th, 2011 in a Sam Adam perfect pint glass.  A - Super dark brown and completely opaque, half-finger tan head that never quite dissipated completely into lacing. Looks mighty fine.  S - Roasted malt notes. Definite coffee character. Nothing in the smell that attributes to any hoppy presence.  T - Surprise! Bitter qualities upfront. A stronger coffee flavor, espresso. Malty sweetness takes over and carries through to the end. A little bit of alcohol but not at all overly hot.  M - Thick, chewy, quite smooth, very nice carbonation for the style.  D - Really enjoyed it. The espresso notes were a bit subtle which I totally dug, Victory incorporated this element better than say Great Divide's espresso oak-aged yeti which just hammered me in the face with the coffee flavors. It's not super complex but the intended flavors and smells, particularly the bitterness, makes this a memorable brew for me. It's also not too difficult to find; always a huge plus.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of roasted malt, dark chocolate, caramel, dark fruit, and tobacco. The flavor was of roasted malt, dark chocolate, caramel, dark fruit, and alcohol. It had a heavy feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall this was an excellent brew. Had a nice aroma going on here, but I am quite unsure about the tobacco smell it gave off. Great balanced flavor that seemed to tie everything all together. An absolute must try.

345,1013,mavbrew,4,"Poured into DFH signature glass, best by 1/10/2016.  A: Pours a deep dark brown color with a nice frothy dark tan head that slowly dissipates and leaves some nice lacing down the side of the glass.  S: Smells of roasted malts (a bit of a coffee scent to it), slight hints of chocolate and some hoppy characteristics. I also some a tiny bit of citrus trying to poke out through the hops.  T: The up front taste has some roasted/coffee characteristics that linger in the palate for a while. There is a bit of a smokey flavor from the roasted malts. Following the smokey flavor is the slightest bit of hops, not as much as expected but subtle and nice.  M: Full bodied with nice carbonation, roasted feel with a bit of bitters (subtle, but still noticeable as mentioned above).  D: I've got to say, I was expecting more out of this stout. It has serious roasted flavor, but I didn't notice the citrus and hop presence that so many reviews point out. There was a bit, but they were very subtle. I'd like to see what some age will do to this beer.

345,1013,wcintula,3.43,"This was pretty nice, poured into a small glass coffee mug with a black body and a big brown head. Smells of strong roasted flavors, it has a good hop bite to the flavor. I was a little disappointed with the mouthfeel because I found it a bit too carbonated. Too prickly for an RIS in my tastes. All in all, a good beer, gets nicer as it warms and as you drink on, but I found it with a high acidity as well.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,patriot76,4.4,"12oz. bottle served in a pint glass  A- The stout pours as black as night and looks thick and full bodied. The creamy medium yellow head foams to about an full inch thick which retains for a while. Not much lacing as the beer progresses. Nice looking.  S- In the nose you get very full and strong elements of roasted hops,coffee(more of an espesso),chocolate, barley and even some cherries. There is a very inviting alcohol scent throughout that makes you realize, this is 9.1 percent.  T- The first sip is a very nice burst of taste. You get the coffee espresso, chocolate and roasted malt and hops that you got in the nose. A bit of a deviation from a traditional stout due to the amount of hops, but I like it. From start to finish it is very smooth with nicely balanced hop bitterness that lingers until the next sip, which for me wasn't too long.  M- Very nice creamy, full bodied mouthfeel. You know your drinking a serious beer here.  D- For the fact that this is an Imperial Stout, it is remarkably drinkable. This nice offering from Victory could get you in trouble due to the fact that you know what a wallop it packs starting off the bat, but after a couple of sips you forget, it's so smooth. Look forward to my next one already.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,RBassSFHOPit2ME,3.9,"Received in a trade from dogfishandi. Thanks Man!  Very interesting take on the style and unique brew for the style. I was conflicted on how to rate this beer.  A - Standard black stout - good lacing and head retention was OK but was expected. Good.  S - I say good. Roast coffee, orange flavored chocolate and hops. Lite smoke. Smells a citrussy stout.  T - I've read other reviews saying this is too hoppy for a stout, too much citrus for a stout, Blah Blah Blah. I expected this to be similar to what Bigfoot is to barleywines...Hoppy. Deal with it. ANYwho...follows nose. Stout qualities are there with the roasty coffee, bitter chocolate...yes this beer is hoppy for a stout but what makes this beer interesting is the flavor of oranges from the hops that blend into all the other stout characteristics. I can see how some may find it offensive but I found it pleasant...different and not used to it in my stouts, but not offensive by any means. I've heard this compared to Black IPAs and I see the argument, but this is a Stout first and foremost. Just a bit more hoppy than most with some citrus notes added. Interesting. I want to give it a 4 but as staying true to the style, I just can't. Don't get me wrong though, I like this beer.  M - Good. Nice finish but I will say as it warms, it's more so as if hop resins are what's lingering on the finish but I like it. Again, interesting.  D - Very good. If this were a bomber I'd have NO problems with it. Easy drinking 9.1% Stout. A sipper *OR* one you could polish off quick if this beer is your bag.  Final Thoughts - As this beer warms it get's resinous like a DIPA. Again, very interesting. But the Stout Characteristics are at the forefront, but IPA-ish as well. I''d drink this again. I'll commend Victory here for brewing out of the box and not staying conventional to style. Well done. EXCELLENT extra.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Some carbonation evident on the bead but not a ton.  S: First smell is of heavy roasted almost coffee like aroma. Great malty notes in the nose and really strong profile.  T/M: Good medium body beer with huge roasted malt character. Wonderful flavors of almost oak but not quite. Really nice cocoa background flavor as well. The palate is very good here with good texture and smoothness.  D: This beer is incredibly drinkable and really easy. Love the strong profile and great character of this beer.

S- Dark cocoa, roasted coffee, hints of licorice, and slight booze touch.  T- They hide the alcohol well but it touches the tounge in a nice way, licorice laces itself throughout this chocolate, caramel, and toffee heavy beer. Nice notes of roasted coffee in the back. Some earthy notes of hops. Very nicely balanced and complex flavor profile.  M- Creamy and thick  D- Very tasty, but heavy and thick with high alcohol makes it a definitel sipper.

345,1013,BennyL1,4.38,"Picked up this with a mixed six, poured into a New Belgium globe. Really looking forward to this one.  A - Pours a wonderful black color which is not letting any light through even when put up to direct light. A very nice fingers worth of tan creamy head forms at the top which makes the beer look ever so inviting. The lacing is great as well, making all sorts of patterns along the glass.  S - Aromas of dark roasted malts bombard the nose with some dark chocolate in there too. A nice floral hop scent in there as well makes for a wonderfully deep and inviting nose. This beer is just screaming drink me, so that is exactly what I'm going to do.  T - This is awesome. Very dark roasted malts with a wonderful coffee/espresso flavor is just superb. Bitter cocoa makes its presence felt as well. What really sets this beer over the top is the hop character. It balances out so well and finishes with a great bitter kick. Just phenomenal all around taste.  M - Full bodied with the perfect amount of carbonation. Nice and smooth, they nailed the feel of this beer.  D - Considering the abv and the style, I probably won't drink to many of these in one night. That being said, I will absolutely be picking this one up again. I'm kicking myself for not picking up a few of these. No matter, a great beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Thanby,3.93,"Okay, this looks like a serious stout. Let's go.  Pours a rich black with a finger of foamy brown head that hangs around and sticks to the glass. So far, so good.  The nose is, of course, big on the roasted dark malt. But there's much more than that happening here. For one thing, it's estery. There's bitter cocoa, and the raw coffee smell that you would expect. But the hops are noticeable, too. Lots of straight-up bittering hops with a high AA is what I'm thinking. The malt is complex, a mix of different dark roast grains and maybe a bit of caramel malt too. There's an impression of muted dark fruit, fig and raisin, but it's blended in pretty well. Definitely one of the more complex RIS's I've seen.  First taste is just as potent as I expected. Lots of roasted coffee and bitter cocoa. This isn't sweet by anyone's description. Again, the complex malt shows itself with a whirlwind of flavors blending seamlessly in the body. The bittering hops fit in perfectly, balancing the bitterness from the malt. Obviously some very strong/fresh hops.  Full body, strong as all hell, and deliciously complex, this is a serious RIS. I love it, though it's definitely not for everyone. But if you love strong stouts, this is your ticket.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

D - This is too hoppy for my liking in this style.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,gillis,3.68,"Super dark, literally opaque once I poured it into the pint glass. Quite a lot of creamy, light brown head on top; about two fingers' worth. Retained some head the whole time I was drinking it.  I smell a little bit of chocolate and coffee lurking behind the maltiness. Smells sweet and perfumey, with a hint of bitter hops aroma.  I am a little surprised at the bitterness of this beer...probably one of the bitterest stouts I've ever had, but not in a bad way. There's especially quite a bitter aftertaste. Up front, I'm definitely getting a lot of a coffee flavor.  The mouthfeel was quite nice...thick, but not unpleasantly so. Almost chewy. Nice amount of carbonation that kept it from being unbearably heavy. Smooth.  Considering the high alcohol content (9.1%), this is pretty drinkable. I'd really like to age some of this and see how it affects the taste. Hopefully it would mellow it out a little and make the hop flavor a little less biting.  Overall, quite delicious and I will definitely have some again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,KickInTheChalice,4.5,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. Bottled April 8, 2009. Part of a side by side with Great Lakes Blackout Stout and Expedition Stout  Appearance: Storm King is a foreboding and black all the way through. A contained creamy brown head looks great out of the bottle and exhibits nice retention. Over the course of the glass, spots of lacing stick to the glass.  Smell: A very complex aroma. On my first try, I definitely could not nail down all the aromas. Anise, a bit of raisin, roasted and chocolate malt, espresso, cocoa, a bit of smoke, and a still-generous citrus hoppiness.  Taste: There is a strong sweetness to start, with molasses and dark chocolate working together with the heavily roasted malt. Some dark fruit steps in, I am getting mostly raisin, and then a blast of anise. The flavor builds up and releases some spicy notes and leads into citrus hops that mostly taste like orange rind. The finish is chocolate, espresso, and orange. Sweet and bitter.  A smooth espresso flavor builds up with each sip, leaving the smooth roast bitter flavor to linger as well.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied, with above average carbonation that actually gets creamier as it warms. Lightly sticky sweet, but not syrupy. They pretty much nail the mouthfeel, the stickiness is what takes away half a point.  Drinkability: The complexity is what really pushes this beer over the top. Even with some time on it, the hops are still present and still creating an interesting dynamic. Espresso to chocolate to orange zest makes for a pretty outstanding beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Satchboogie,3.3,"12oz bottle (Best by 12/10/15) poured into a snifter  A: Pours black with almost a finger of frothy mocha head that slowly dissipates.  S: Roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, fairly strong hop character with some citrus.  T: This has to be the hoppiest stout I've had. While the roasted malts, chocolate, and coffee are all there, they seem to lack depth and just fade rather quickly to the hop bite. Hops are strong on the back end and are mostly floral and citrus, which seems to clash a bit with the roasted malt character. A little more sweetness and creaminess might help balance the hops. Tastes more like a Black espresso/choc bomb IPA than a RIS. After taste is almost leafy and grassy, maybe even a little mint... in a stout...  M: Medium carbonation, medium to thin body, just a little chewy, resin. Body seems to thin and there's just too much resin and hop bitterness and it kills the texture, it's nothing close to smooth. After taste has a bitter roasted leafy thing going on.  D: The taste isn't ideal and the 9% ABV certainly doesn't help the case. Don't think I'll be having anther one anytime soon.  This was a real shocker for me. When I first tried this a couple months ago I absolutely love it, but after having some great stouts, this just doesn't hold up against the rest. Way too hoppy.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,DovaliHops,2.98,"Pours a pitch black color that lets no light through whatsoever. There is a small tannish/off-white head that disappears quickly. Scent is chocolatey and VERY hoppy. I have never had a stout smell this hoppy before. I also get aromas of citrus and roasted coffee. Taste is...WOW...This has to be the most citrusy/hoppy stout I've ever had in my life! I've heard of hoppy stouts before, but this one is overwhelmingly hoppy. I definitely get more orange, grapefruit, and bitterness than I get chocolate or coffee. I don't know if it is because this bottle is super fresh or what, but it's just not what I'm used to or what I enjoy in a typical RIS. Maybe hoppy/citrusy stouts take some getting used to. It's a real bummer, because I've heard such great things about this stout. Mouthfeel is full bodied and not overly thick or viscous. Drinkability would be a lot higher if it weren't for the off-putting citrus and hoppiness in what I was expecting to be rich with chocolate and coffee flavors.

345,1013,MrHirschybar,3.66,"From a 12oz bottle into a New Belgium globe snifter  A - Big Mocha colored head that stuck around for a while. Beer was a pitch black color - no light through even when held up to the light. Left a bit of lacing and a small floating head the entire time.  S - Chocolate, malts, and bitterness.  T - Chocolate, malts, light smokiness, light bitterness with a sweet edgy finish. Have had this a couple times and sometimes get a light metallic taste to it that's not too pleasant.  M - Medium heaviness, medium mouth coating, light carbonation - not the heaviest stout, but not the lightest - right in the middle, could drink a few and not have too much residual mouthfeel...  D - Could drink one or two minus the sometimes present metallic taste that comes through - maybe an off bottle here or there or something else coming through due to variable. All in all, a nice stout for the price - SoCal this cost $11.99-$12.99 on average for a 4-pack.

Unfortunately missing is every typical aromatic attribute inherent to the style, and present are the undesired characteristics.  T- Dark over-roasted coffee, charred malt and harsh hops. The finish is bitter without a counterbalance of any kind. The char and bitter hops are all we have here, and that is not what comprises an enjoyable stout, in my opinion.

C'mon Victory, dates are useless if they aren't readable. At any rate, I can't see this stuff going bad too quickly. Rather, I'd think it would be a good candidate for aging. Served mostly cold in a chilled pint glass.  I've had this brew many times but not for quite a while. It is nice to revisit an old favorite. Surprised to see that I hadn't reviewed it. To the best of my knowledge this is the only 6-pack RIS available in these parts.  A: Thick pitch black brew lets no light through, not even when held to a light. 1"" of thick mocha-colored foam takes a minute or two to settle to a thick stable cap. Spotty lace is left on the glass.  S: Thick chewy malt body with a bunch of dark roasted grain, some smoke and astringency. Has a moderate sweetness like dark stone fruits, cherry and plum. Warm cocoa and floral hops.  T/M: Thick rich body. Lots of burnt malt mixing with earthy and herb hop cuts cleanly through the thickness. Sweetness of dark candied cherries and cocoa powder. Finishes dry and balanced with nearly the whole palate lingering for quite a while. A tiny bit of alcohol heat resides at the back of the mouth and in the finish, becoming more prominent as the brew warms.

345,1013,Kegatron,4.15,"On cask, via hand pump, @ the Victory Brewing Company (Downingtown, PA) on 1/15/11. Served in a pint glass.  Pours a straight black in the glass, with a finger of tight foamy mocha colored head. This retains with about a ¼ finger of creamy froth, which holds tight across the top and drenches the sides of the glass with a solid sheet of lacing the whole way down. The aroma smells burnt with a roasted coffee nose on it, along with some green citrus character. There are sweet notes of chocolate and caramel present, which feels like they want to sit in the nostrils with some stickiness but the overall sharpness of the roast and hops keeps thing crisp and tight in the nose.  The taste is roasted and bitter across the tongue with a forceful mix of coffee and citric hop flavors. A balancing mix of chocolate and caramel malts help balance this out across the back but the cask really brings the aggressiveness of this out, as this finishes burnt and roasty with some lingering green bitterness. The mouthfeel is fuller bodied, with the cask lending this some lightness that is equal parts crisp and creamy in the mouth. The alcohol his mostly well hid here, with no hot flavors per se, but it does contribute to the overall intensity of the flavors and feel.  Wow, the cask conditioning really opens this sucker up, so that you get the full Storm King experience. Whether your ready for it or not! The roasted malts and hops are just in full effect here, to the point that they get to be a bit much towards the bottom of the glass. Yeah, this ones a bit of a rager but still damn tasty if you like aggressive beers and that cask body does help smooth things out a bit.

The aroma was fairly typical, rich roasted malts, some grains and a trace of hops. There was a bit of an alcohol scent. The flavor was about what you'd expect, bold rich roasted malts, that trace of hops, a bit of grain and a slight coffee finish. The alcohol was apparent, but not overpowering.  The body was solid and full, yet somehow not as full as I expected. Drinkability was good for a beer this big, but I probably wouldn't have more than one at a time.

Tastes very similar to how it smells. Smooth roasted malt and dark chocolate flavors kick things off and are joined quickly by large amounts of pine hops.

The initial taste is pretty solid, like coffee with a chocolate creamer but I really don't like the after taste. It's like straight soap, almost bitter. Very sudsy and unappealing. It's also very thin for a RIS. This beer started great but went downhill from there. I wasn't impressed.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,BarrytheBear,3.4,"12 bottle into a snifter. Black with a short lived tan head that settles to a thin ring along the edges. No lacing and emaciated supermodel legs make this sort of weak eye candy.  Initial predominant scent is rubber hose. Picked up from numerous bottles, this doesn't seem to be an anomaly. After a few minutes of time spent in the glass this off scent fades mostly to the background and what remains is bittersweet dark chocolate and dark roast.  Leafy and slightly sour hops dominate up front. There is a tree bark and lime quality that lingers long on the back end and overshadow much of the chocolate qualities promised from the nose. Maybe my memory is faulty, or my palate has changed, but this seems quite different from the bottles that really pleasantly surprised me a few years back. Seems at odds with itself.  Medium bodied with soft carbonation that manages to hide the bite well. Still, there's something off in the way the core aspects of this beer seem to battle each other more than seeking to live harmoniously. Am I alone in thinking this is a shell of what this beer once was? Verdict: uncertain.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

A: Big and black with one-half inch of foamy dark tan almost brown head after an aggressive pour and left a moderate lacing on the glass.  S: Lots of rich, roasty malts balanced with the juicy hops... As it warms I'm getting both coffee and dark chocolate in the nose but it is well balanced with the hops.  T: Constantly evolving as it warms... Rich dark chocolate, bitter coffee, a bit of something I couldn't put my finger on until reading other reviews and I think it was tobacco. The richness of the malt is balanced by lots of citrusy, bitter hops.  M: Not as thick as other RIS but the viscosity is matched with appropriate carbonation that fills the mouth without overcoating it.  D: Could probably have a couple of these before the ABV would kick me in the face, but pretty high.

345,1013,AlexanderSelby,2.27,"I'm sorry, but I think this beer smells like poo. The aroma is sweaty and sour and unappealing. With that said, the flavor overwhelms that aspect and somewhat recovers it. Storm King's smokey, belly-warming flavor is pleasant for a few sips, especially considering it's high abv and heavy-handed hopping. The pallet is graced with a few good flavors, such as burnt coffee, smoked meat, but there is a serious soapy off-flavor present which taints the whole experience.  The flavors all seem to fight for top spot on your palate instead of work together to give you a well-rounded experience, which is that is exactly what you need from a robust, boozy imperial stout. I probably will not purchase this beer again unless I'm craving an imperial stout and I'm broke and it's on-sale.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Bitter and sour are predominant. A bit woody? Alcohol only really hits on the finish  For being relatively light on carbonation it's got a great fizz. Light and doesn't coat your mouth.

Looks and smells great. Roasted malt, espresso...maybe more espresso than normal. Taste is more of the same...there is a definite hop presence.

A: Completely black in color with very slight reddish highlights reflected in the glass. Pours with a rich, frothy, three-finger head of tan foam which holds nicely, leaving a creamy cap on the brew and nice webby lacing.  S: Sugary, fruity and roasted malt aromas blended with the scent of licorice, smoked peat and resinous, herbal hops.  T: Creamy, roasted black malts up from lend characteristics of brown sugar, molasses, bittersweet chocolate, oats, coffee and charcoal. A spicy, fruity and floral bitterness builds to a very roasty, earthy and bittersweet finish that ends with notes of slick, oily hops, alcohol and spicy, burnt tobacco leaves.  M: Smooth, creamy and full-bodied with a good pull from carbonation, alcohol and oily hop resins. A little slick and coating in the finish, but no complaints really.  D: A very complex, roasty and enjoyable RIS clocking in at a brutish 9.1% ABV. A fine sipper and good accompaniment with the German chocolate cake I've paired it with for dessert. Also nice to chase the chill off a bitter cold New England snowstorm, which I'm sipping one through currently.

Taste: starts a bittersweet chocolate, finishes with a hoppy bitterness that I was not expecting in a RIS. Reminds me quite a bit of the finish you get with an IPA. In fact if i were to try this blindfolded I would guess that it is a DIPA. No hint of alcohol which surprised me for a beer with more than 9%ABV.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied, creamy texture but a bit too fizzy. None of the alcohol feel I was expecting.  Drinkability: Very drinkable. If I were to try this without knowing the ABV I would guess somewhere in the 4-5% range.

Very earthy  T: Lots of wood in the flavor. Bitterness is high, bittersweet chocolate, toffee, light molasses, and coffee. Pretty damn hoppy.

Holds a good foamy cap and leaves some rings/walls of lacing.  Aroma is dark roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, citrus & pine hops, anise, dark fruits, and a bit of a lactic kick. Good strength.  Flavor is rich chocolate and lots of it, espresso, roasted malts, caramel, toffee, lightly sour dark fruits, brown sugar, molasses, vanilla, minimal alcohol. Very complex and rich.  Mouthfeel is full, creamy, low to medium carbonation.  An excellent Imperial Stout...I've had this numerous times over the years and surprised to see I hadn't reviewed it yet.  However, I have a feeling something is slightly off on this batch. I didn't care for it at all when fresh and while it has greatly improved with a year, there are some signs of infection (huge head, touches of sourness/lactic). Will probably go ahead and polish off what I have left and get another fresh sixer to stick in the cellar.

T - big on chocolate mostly, dark malts and caramel with some coffee and licorice. Not a bit of alcohol taste, very well disguised.  M - thin with a bit too much carbonation. While the carbonation makes the appearance, it hurts the mouthfeel. Not really overpowering twang for the hops tasted either.

Taste is again roasty and has a heavy presence of black licorice, which I usually dislike but found rather pleasant here. A hint of hops as well.

The tan, of course, is a thick yet porous foam. It's like a sloth or something as a slime-like wall laces the glass upon settling. Oh, yeah, and it's totally black.  Nothing special on the nose. I like to think things like leather and tobacco can surface to the top on a beer like this, and I, therefore, detect those two things here. Maybe a little toffee as well. Still, the smell is hardly characteristic of anything. I get maybe a touch of coffee. Subtleties exist, but nothing stands out.  Solid but plain. In an era when even the smallest breweries break out their ""special release"" bourbon barrel-aged beer bombs, is there a place for Victory Storm King? I remember when this beer was a big deal. In my first sent trade, a guy from Alabama was wowed by my including a Storm King extra! I want to be fair. I want to be objective. But damnit, it's just a roasted malt stout--hops faded on this one. And I get it...some old espresso beans. I guess on a hopped-up coffee stout I was wrong to put it aside for so long (still: ""enjoy by Nov 13 2014"")! It really hasn't been that long...but why is it so blah and plain?  Mouthfeel's got nothing. I'm most taken by carbonation, and for a big-boi Russian Imperial, ""fizzy"" shouldn't be an upstanding component at the forefront of feel. :-( It's a Victory Storm King, so it's got to be ""drinkable"" worthy...right??",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,LacquerHead,4.23,"Drank this while playing A--Hole. Poured it into a Sam Adams pint  I was practically pitch black with a roasted tan colored head.  The aroma started off as a blend of hops and robust malts. At first this had a hoped smell that reminded me of something murky. Later as the beer warmed up a bit the malts took over and it had a robust smell.  The taste was in line with the aroma. It started off with a hoped flavor. It had a bitter taste that gave it a nice paleness to kick things off. The hops flavor mingled with the robustness of the malts. As the beer warmed, however, the hops began to subside and the malts took over. It had a coffee like flavor followed by something nutty. There was also a dry flavor that stayed more or less consistent through out.  Conclusion: This was a really good RIS. I liked the hops profile on this one. I didn't think it was a robust as other RIS, but it was still very good.  Luckily I had this beer during two rounds of A-Hole when I got a bunch of good cards and served two terms as president.

I am picking up some citrus hops that are fairly strong with some dark chocolate hidden in.  Quite an interesting flavor. There are various chocolates noticeable immediately with a small bit of coffee. What is amazing is the amount of hops in the flavor. After a couple of seconds the citrus hops become overpowering.

345,1013,Khazadum,3.89,"Blind beer labeled #9! These have all been top notch choices so far. Tonight's beer is to be served in a snifter. After an eight hour shift today full of whiny yuppies, I think I need this one. Hopefully it doesn't bias the review too much ;)  Vision Tiny bubbles, many of them, generate a full finger's worth of russet brown head. Doesn't last too long. Dies down to a thick half finger collar and soap scum center. About a half dozen carbonation beds are seen from the top view and it cascades up the edges of the snifter endlessly. Lacing is minimal, and the collar itself dies within a five minute span.  Bouquet Boozy? Not in the bourbon barrel aged sense, but in terms of sharp ethanol character wafting upwards. Lots of burnt and roasted grains in the middle after the chocolate liquor aroma dies down. More burnt notes than anything else dominate the closing argument.  Again, as it warmed up a hop profile began to jump out. Pine and citrus middle surrounded by everything I've ever called a stout.  Flavor profile Similar to the nose, it opens sharply. We have a spike of iron that disintegrates instantly, thankfully, but it leaves room for a sweet middle. Caramels and cane sugar notes here. Really malty in the middle here. Slowly it saturates and leaves me with a mild dark chocolate and burnt grain finish, perhaps even a dark fruit or two overwhelmed by all the harsh flavors.  As it warmed up, the hops began to play a more pronounced role. In fact, they dominate the malty middle and do war with the burnt grain finish. This is surprisingly hoppier than I would expect any RIS to be.  Oral Sensations Medium bodied. It definitely has a chewy characteristic that I'm digging. I'm really digging it actually. Carbonation tingles gently on the opening, but never bubbles up further than that. Lingers, lingers, lingers. Everywhere. Lips, tongue, teeth, soft palate, I'm pretty sure if I could lick my uvula it would be there, too!  Conclusions This is a nice RIS. Pretty simple. Not too much I could call gimmicky. The burnt notes don't turn me off from drinking. The hops don't cause me to cringe and hold off on sipping consistently. Decent offering. It definitely warms me up in my ass cold apartment, and for that I thank it. I'm 100% sure it is a RIS... never had this one before.  Without a doubt, the hop presence takes this beer from mediocrity and elevates it to a fun level. It barely broke a 3.5 in some categories without that delicious hop balance.

A good mouthfeel to match the depth of the stout.  D - this is the hoppiest RIS I have tried to date.

Bitter grapefruit up front followed by a faint coffee flavor trying to break through. The balance of malt and hops is very interesting and we'll played.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Ghenna,3.26,"Pours a motor oil black. Big billowy latte colored head.  Big roasted malt smell in the nose, and a bit of alcohol.  Flavor is pretty much of burned malt, and a little uncomplex otherwise. Yeah, that is pretty much it.  MF is surprisingly light given the abv and style, with a creamy texture. Easy to drink actually.  I've usually been pretty pleased with Victory's offerings, but this is just ok. Nothing special actually, given the price I'd just as soon snag their old horizontal, as it seems to be a better executed beer at this ABV level.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

It smelled mostly of coffee and alcohol.  T - Good! Coffee taste with hints of alcohol. Malty, and quite sweet for a stout.  M - Great, great carbonation. This beer is excellent for mouthfeel.  D - Drinkable, I could see myself drinking a few of these, which is different than other RISes I've had.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,hopstradamus,4.12,"A. Pours a viscous, opaque, black accompanied by a tall milk chocolate head that fades quickly to reveal intricate, large lace.  S. Heavy roasted malt flavor, it smells sweet and there is a heavier hop profile than I expected. There is also the slightest hint of both vanilla and caramel.  T. Heavy, peaty, roasted malt flavor, almost burnt. The bitterness from the hops are an excellent balance to the malt that should completely overpower them.  M. Decent mouthfeel, it is chewy, but a little thin. Appropriate level of carbonation, but I wouldn't mind more.  D. The malt is a little too roasted for me, almost burnt, but I would still have another.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Smells of toasted malts with a nice balance to hops that give it a little bitterness to the nose. Taste is sweet roasted malts. Theres lots of dark coffee flavors.ith Also a slight alcohol taste in the middle. It then ends with a nice roasted bitter hoppy flavor that lingers for a bit. Very well carbonated. Nice thick mouth feel. Super smooth super soft on the palate. Highly drinkable. Its one of those beers that you just want more and more of. Try hard and just sip this one.

The head is thick, foamy, and almost a burnt dark orange in color  Smell: In all fairness I had this refrigerated and only gave it a few minutes to warm up before popping this open. The aroma definitely opened up and the bouquet was more apparent as the beer warmed in my snifter.  Taste: dark toffee, coffee grinds, and a bit of dirt. Absolutely love the earthy aspects of a dirt taste.  Mouthfeel: Thick as midnight, heavy like oil, but silky on the tongue.

345,1013,micromaniac129,4.2,Cellared one year  Pours deep brown/black with a small tan head that maintains through out this session as a small wispy veil in the center of a small foam ring. Aromas of roasted malts and a slight hoppiness. Sweet malt tasting with some hop bitterness. The hops seemed to have mellowed out as I expected. Malts have a chocolate espresso flavor. A rich full bodied beer that has some grittiness on finish. The flavors after a year have mellowed out nicely. A nice rich stoudt beer with a good dose of hidden alcohol. After reviewing I finished the beer off with a couple chunks of smoked gouda. They went together nicely.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,wrightro07,3.7,A: This RIS pours black like an RIS should. The head is a creamy tan but not much head retention. S: vanilla coffee malts with a bitter hoppey smell. T: The taste on this beer is quite good for an all the year round RIS. I was pleased. It is not on par with the brewery release RIS like Darkness but as I said before as a RIS I can get all year round when I have a craving it is really nice. The flavour has that rich coffee maltiness that I love and it is has not too harsh of a bitterness from all of the hops. M: The mouthfeel is average in my opinion. It was a little too carbonated and the soft fuzzy feel in the mouth was not up to par as in RIS like Teddy Bear Kisses. D: the overall drinkability is good. For a RIS that is served all year round I am very happy with Victory's Storm King. I could drink a few of these in one night.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Dark dried fruits are prominent. Hops are not excessive but are detectable. Dark chocolate mixed in as well.  T-Huge roasty coffee flavors blitz the taste buds. Sweet toffee hits hard as well. Bitterness rises quickly and sticks around. Hoppier than most stouts. Too hoppy, though.  M-Thick but not incredibly thick. Not too much carbonation which I kinda like. Silky and creamy.  D-Yeah this beer is a flavor bomb but it is quite drinkable. The alcohol leaves some burn but it is not a detractor.  Exceeded my expectations.

A: Pours a pitch black with a thick fluffy dark brown head that slowly faded into a thin oily film that, while it lasted, left a network of sticky lacing all the way around the glass. S: Sweet notes of chocolate malt, vanilla and a touch of alcohol. Hops poke through the back along with notes of molasses and coffee beans. T: Very rich and dark tasting. Big notes of bitter-sweet dark chocolate dominate with sweeter notes of caramel, and molasses. Coffee flavor lends some acidity to the brew. Aftertaste is surprisingly bitter. M: Full-body, fairly thick mouthfeel and relatively smooth going down. The carbonation is a little prickly however. Alcohol is present in the finish. D: Super drinkable, delicious, and very rich RIS.

345,1013,Smakawhat,3.46,"Served on tap into a snifter.  Why do I bother with the appearances. It's a stout. It's black.. moving on.. okay but seriously folks... The bubbles on this one are actually kind of a soapy consistency the fall at a decent clip buy not too fast. The bubbles are a faint brown.  Aromas of faint malt and a strange almost dare I say watery wetness, a ""clean"" sort of smell as if you were smelling just opened tap water from your kitchen sink. That's the only way I can describe it.  Taste improves after the bouquet even thought the watery sense comes forward. A 'soft' tobacco chew like comes in the taste almost like... chewing tobacco, leaving a bitter dark chocolate aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is actually good with a small bitterness balanced by the easy wet taste.  Drinkability I'd rate just a fraction above average, there are things worth exploring in the stout, it is not a waste of time to have one.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Little color was escaping this glass as the beer is black as black can be. I let it sit on the bar an warm down a little bit as I enjoyed my nachos.  The smell of this stout is amazing. Nose has a sweet smell to it, with maybe some vanilla and fruit coming in somewhere. The taste followed the nose, and I can feel a little bit of heat on the back end of it from the booze. The roasted malts come in great and blend really well with the chocolate flavor thats present in this beer. A really excellent stout and my favorite beer that has come out of Victory.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,DrinkingDrake,3.83,Poured a thick black with a nice tall brown head that dissipated slowly and left a layer of thin lace which clung to the glass. A hop aroma cuts through the toasty chocolate malt and there is a very faint hint of the alcohol. It has a thick and smooth texture that gives a quick bite but instantly mellows into the chocolate and roasted malts. The chocolate transforms seamlessly from mellow and almost milky to a nice bitterness that lingers. This is a nice hearty beer with a lot of character.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Beautiful sheets of lacing down the sides. Looks amazing.  S:Get a slight hop kick up front which gives way to some roasted grain. I also get a little chocolate and a slight hint of the alcohol.  T: Lots of roasted flavor up front. This transitions to some chocolate and molasses and finishes with a heavy hand of coffee flavor. There is a little bit of dark fruit in the middle somewhere as well. Has a bitter finish.  M/D: Very thick, but smooth. Overall very enjoyable. THe abv is not noticeable at all, and I like the hoppiness it has for an RIS. I like this one a lot.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

A - Pours black as night with a strong one finger brown head that leaves minimal lacing down the glass.  S - Plenty of dark, roasty, aroma's in this one. Coffee, chocolate, and other earthy flavors and most prevalent. Faint hints of herbal hops and a bit of booze hide well but are present. Even a bit of spice?  T - Dark goodness. Similar to the nose with coffee, chocolate, oak, black licorice, and plenty of other earthy flavors. Finish is dominated by tons of dark roasted flavors. A little bit of booze creeps in once it begins to warm up a bit. A very nice stout.  M - Heavy body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Very smooth feel with a strong roasted finish.  D - I like this version a little bit more than the normal version. The feel of this one is much better than the normal version and it seems to help bring all the flavors together into a more well rounded offering.

The aroma is simply rockin' on this one! Big roasty malts right up front with dark fruits (dried plumbs come to mind) and a kind of grassy aroma probably from the hops and a bitter espresso undertone. Really nice flavors to follow the aroma. Big and roasty, kind of a semi sweet bakers chocolate flavor. Dried fruit, leather and espresso round out the flavors on this. All what I really want in an imperial stout. Solid mouthfeel, decent carbonation, smooth robust full body. Enjoyable all around. Honestly, I'm really enjoying this one, but I get a bit of alcohol burn going down and I've been nursing this for quite a while now and haven't gotten very far in it. Definitely a sipper.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,musicforairports,3.82,"This is a pretty fresh bottle, best by September 2015.  Pours black, with a brown head that leaves some good lacing.  Smells like chocolate and roasted malt, as well as some other piney or metallic scent i can't quite pinpoint. Kind of strange.  Taste is very much that of a stout, but there's a mild citrus hop twang to it. It doesn't get in the way of the roasted chocolate flavors, though, but they're a bit subdued for the style. Taste has substantially more of a bite to it than many other imperial stouts. I expect this beer would taste a lot different a year or two from now, as the hops will have fallen out.  Slightly creamy mouthfeel, seems like more carbonation than is typical for the style.  About as drinkable as a 9+ percent ABV imperial stout will ever be. It's not so heavy that it's a complete sipper.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Slight citrus sweetness up front. Then the bitters hit with the carbonation. The carb level is quite high. Immediately after, the coffee pinch kicks in and then a velvety malty, chocolate finish. Very complex brew. Very tasty. The timing of the carbonation and the coffee spice don't hit at the exact right moments. Perhaps with age the carbonation will lessen and this would be a bit more smooth. There is a harshness that could use some mellowing.

Great retention and collar, leaving patches of tan lacing all over the place.  Semi-sweet chocolate, coffee, dark malt, and a bit of nuttiness in the nose.  Heavily roasted malt up front with caramel, notes of mocha and coffee with some chocolate sweetness. Bits of molasses and a hint of booze poke through towards the middle. Finished with a pleasant splash of bitter hops and a slice of alcohol.  Full body, incredibly velvety smooth feel with silk touches and superbly pleasant on the palate.

This beer pours a solid black, a light vacuum - no edges, nada, with two fingers of thick foamy dark beige (ok, tan) head, which steadily settles, leaving some nice striated lace around the glass. It smells of citrus hops, roasted malt, a bit of chocolate, and some faint coffee grounds. The taste is big sweet roasted chocolate malt, more of a bitter cocoa than the confectionery sort, a soft underlying cafe au lait essence, and bitter citrus and pine hops, double-dipped in the aforementioned chocolate. 9.1% ABV, and it barely registers a warming tickle - wow. The carbonation is very soft, the body full, dense, slick and creamy. It finishes clean, the sweetness ebbing a stitch, allowing the doused hops more room to maneuver.  A warmer that does not come across as one, beyond being big everywhere else. As for its actual style, it succeeds on all counts. Tasty chocolate, big, and well integrated hops and alcohol - what's not to like here?",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,CliffBrake,3.22,"Wow - I don't think I have ever seen such a dark beer. Essentially opaque with the darkest head I have ever seen. Light lacing.  The balance of hops and roasted malt in the aroma is enticing, but the flavor is a bit too much for me. The aggressive hop bitterness and the roasted flavors seem to be fighting with each other.  My sample was a bottle dated with best before July 15, 2015. Maybe I robbed the cradle and should have waited?",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,BBP,4.04,"A- Pours black with good carbonation, impressive full creamy head and good retention. Laces nicely as well. I thought this was exactly what a good RIS should look like.  S- Roasted malts. A bit of cocoa and coffee as well. Far too light of an aroma however.  T- Bittersweet cocoa from the beginning. Notes of coffee accompany this. Has a ton of cocoa flavor to it, but not in a chocolate way. It's in a dry spicy cocoa way. There's a smoky flavor initially in each sip which quickly leans into a very burnt flavor. As a kid I remember making chocolate chip cookies, and ever now and then a chocolate chip would fall off a cookie, and cook on the oven tray. This is the best way I can describe the taste of this beer. Burnt chocolate.  M- Fairly dry mouthfeel. Just on the verge of being sticky. Medium/full body leaning towards medium, and good carbonation.  D- Considerably drinkable, especially for a 9.1% ABV beer. The only thing that lessens the drinkability is the dry/burnt aspects of it. Aside from that I could easily drink a few of these in no time. All in all I was excited trying this as it was one of the top 100 beers, and it didn't live up to it's hype. It was still a good/great beer, but I don't think it should be on the list.

345,1013,TheBrewo,3.66,"We pour a syrupy brew of the deepest brown color, with the half finger head only a few shades lighter. The head dissipates quickly, but leaves a fair bit of creamy lacing. The primary component of the aroma is hops, which masks the subtle hints of burnt coffee and suggestions of roasted malts. The taste takes off with an immense, coiny hoppiness. The sip peaks with dark coffee and an apparent alcoholic warmth, quickly descending to carry those flavors into the aftertaste. The brew is highly carbonated and thickly full bodied, leaving the mouth a bit dry. The unexpectedly huge hop character and high abv make this a slower drinking brew.  Overall, the deep rich color of both the brew and the head make it an attractive prospect. The most surprising aspect of the beer is certainly the dominance of the hops, which pushes many other desirable flavors to the back.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,TCHopCraver,4.05,"Reviewed from notes made on 11/3/10.  A: Into a giant snifter, Storm King pours black with just a hint of brown, with a two-finger dark khaki to light mocha head. Retention of the head is splendid, headlined by puffy clumps. The lacing forms in various shaped clumps.  S: The aroma is very unique and distinct. A heavy roasted malt smell harmonizes with a pretty fresh hop bitterness. This results in myriad aromas - espresso, dark chocolate, plum, cherry, roasted peanut, soy, vanilla, and caramelized sugar. This is a sharper aroma than most RIS's that I have had.  T: Roasted malt lands firmly on the flat of my tongue while bitter hops work the sides of my mouth. There are obviously a ton of hops in this beer - probably far more than style average. Notes of bitter coffee and mocha chocolate emerge as the beer warms. There is a decent amount of citrus bitterness playing off of the darker malt flavors, as well.  M: The feel starts medium to full and creamy and finishes with a biting hop bitterness. The carbonation is on the low side.  D: Storm King is certainly an interesting take on the style and one that I will be trying again. The large amount of hops made it maybe a little less drinkable then other RIS's of this caliber.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,cratez,4.37,"12oz bottle from a six pack purchased at Ryan's Party Store in Port Huron, MI.  Pours a completely opaque, midnight black with a thin mocha cap and generous webbed lacing on the tulip.  Smell is baker's chocolate, fig, burnt grains, dried fruit, doughy yeast, liquor, mild estery note, and floral-resiny hops.  Taste is an intense onslaught of fresh ground coffee, espresso beans, dark unsweetened chocolate, roasted malt, oak wood, cream, warming alcohol, spicy and bitter hops, and a sweet, chalky palate to end.  Silky mouthfeel is full bodied, rich and smooth, syrupy middle with a pleasing, bone dry finish.  This is similar to Bell's Expedition Stout but not quite as robust and flavourful. Nevertheless, Storm King is one of the best impy stouts I've had and well worth the price tag. Awesome stuff.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,UTCengOwl,4.57,"Served out of a 12 oz. bottle poured into a Great Divide balloon glass on 11/14/10.  This beer pours very black with a nice tan head. The head stays around for a while, but it's not quite as creamy as I'd like to see.  The dominant aroma is roasty. Some hints of coffee and chocolate. Maybe a bit of milk? Also some American hop notes.  The taste is incredibly well balanced. The hops, roastiness and booze are all fighting to be the dominant flavor, but they end up being fantastic complements. This reminds me of a thicker India Black Ale, with appropriately restrained hops.  This beer is far, far too drinkable for how big it is. Did I really just finish that bottle? This was an excellent beer and I wouldn't mind having another in the near future. I'm a native Coloradan and I'd reach for one of these over a bottle of Yeti... which is some darned high praise for an imperial stout, IMO.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,stonermouse,4.27,"I pulled this one from the cellar after a year of aging. Poured into a Sam Adams glass.  Appearance is quite nice. Nearly black as night, as expected. Really nicely-colored head; chocolate brown. Dwindled more quickly than I would've liked.  Smell is potent, and has an unanticipated fruitiness to it. Otherwise there's a slightly smokey malt aroma. Nice.  Flavor here is a wallop, and is seriously smooth. Toasty and mildly sweet malts, and none of the fruity sort of flavor that came out in the aroma. There's a little alcohol warmth, but it's perfect for the style and compliments the flavors.  Mouthfeel is really nice. Dense and not at all syrupy. The flavors envelop the palette, and the soft malt sweetness is the only flavor that hangs around for a while.  Drinkability is high, if only because I can think of many different times I would love to have this beer. As a dessert beer, or while celebrating Christmas, or while sitting inside during a snow storm. Not my personal favorite style, but the flavors in this beer are beautiful.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Taste 4/5 There's some sweetness in this beer, yes, but it is mightily crushed by the huge roast and hoppiness that is the USP of this beer. Tastes like heartily roasted coffee beans covered in the darkest of chocolates; so dark a roast that there's no acidity perceived! Finish is medium with subtle alcohol warming.  Mouthfeel 4.5/5 Silky with low carbonation which might be because of the warm serving temperature too. Could use some more body, seeing as the bottle I had is quite fresh.  Drinkability 4/5 Good.

Pours an opaque black color with a fine-bubbled brown head. Retention is average and lacing is terrific.  Nose does not show much sign of oxidation and the hops are still kickin like a chicken. Roast, chocolate and licorice make up the malty portion of the aroma.  Mmmmm, oh wow. Two years on this beer has done absolute wonders for the beer. So smooth, chocolate flavors really starting to shine and there is still enough hop bitterness to have a 'fresh' taste. Not much oxidation, maybe just a touch here and there. Some mild, dark fruit adds to the complexity. Just enough sweetness and body is medium-full.

Upfront it is tasting sweet, a bit vinous, then roasted tones, nuts and licorice.  Small carbonation, a big and complex body, a dry finish.

Lightly roasty, woody, and yeasty.  4.0 T: Less hoppy than regular (or perhaps my palate has changed since I last had the regular a couple years ago). Decently roasty and rather sweet. Healthy bitterness, woody, and yeast.  4.0 M: Medium body. Lowish carbonation, creamy, and smooth.  4.0 D: Could use a bit more carbonation even for cask, but that's the nature of the beast.

345,1013,Bouleboubier,5,"I've been drinking and adoring this stout for countless years now. One of the best moves Victory made was moving this from a seasonal offering to a year-round celebration. Storm King has so much going for it - a striking display, a bold aroma, a dynamic, complex flavor, and highly competitive ""drinkability"" (can we come up with a synonym for ""drinkability""?...considering it's mainstream reference point)  What a perfect beer to enjoy from my favorite serving type - the growler (on-tap/cask, I love you, but I can take growler home, it looks hot, and I can have my way with it - without peeeeople around). This might pour one of the most gorgeous, busty heads I've laid eyes on - uber-full, chocolate(-colored) mousse-creamy, filthy-thick stains of lacing spattering the middle-man (pint glass) - stark-dark onyx. Ultra-smooth, lightly bitter cocoa/roasty, blue-green fresh-pungent hop aroma - pounds the sinuses with sultry loveliness. Other notes in the scent - black licorice and booze - carry over into and explode in the taste, which, with all said descriptors combined, plus a soft coffee undertone and a silken cream liqueur feel and Irish dry finish...(pause)...make quite possibly the most all-quality-encompassing strong stout in existence. I've gushed over this on-tap, on cask, from growler (3 times), from bottle, and siphoned from the belly of the storm king bird itself.

Herbal and a touch of bubblegum citrus notes are quickly matched and taken over by roasted nuts and sweet brown sugar.  Definitely a flavor explosion going on! The taste buds are sent into a frenzy of astringent burnt malt flavor, sweetness, and a powerful bitter finish. In what ever order they hit, they battle throughout the aftertaste. Burnt coffee and nuts eventually break into sweet molasses and caramelized sugars. Some ripe fruit notes and a grassy dry finish add to the excellence.  The body doesn't seem all that heavy, but it really is pretty thick and sticky. The carbonation is mild.... perfect. How can a beer with this much spunk be so easy to drink???

With any luck I'll figure out what I'm doing before it's all over.  2010 brewing poured into my SA perfect pint glass.  A: Poured a dark brown with good head retention. Well carbonated. S: Getting a sweet and roasty nose with a hint of chocolate. T: Pretty hoppy that turns to a roasted flavor with hints of chocolate (maybe bitter chocolate). As the beer warms, I notice that the hoppiness fades a bit, leaving the more of the roasted taste. M: Well-bodied and balanced. Good consistency. D: An enjoyable beer and great for the price point.

Poured almost jet black with a tan 2 finger head that dissipated slowly leaving a sticky lace around the glass  I smell coffee and something that has a roasted or char bitterness to it.  Coffee favor up front followed by a roasted bitterness and some hops to round it all out, the alcohol adds a nice bite to the overall flavor  Its pretty smooth and its quite thick but very pleasant overall.

The taste is of dark fruit, chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, molasses, and roasted malts, alcohol is not very obvious.  Full bodied, very smooth and very creamy, also a little thin.

S - roasty, malty, cooked cherries,raisins in syrup, a hint of dark chocolate. The overall aroma is ""in your face"".  T - Very similar to the smell. Rich and malty upfront, cooked fruity esters in the middle, and then a sweet, slightly hoppy, aftertaste that hangs around. The alcohol is hidden well.  M - Near perfect!

Fairly thick.  D - Excellent. I will buy this again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,mattgreger,4.07,"This brew pours a rich, dark black color. It poured with a nice tan head that was pretty lively on the pour, that fades to a nice mocha colored cap that holds, and retains well on the top of the glass. A nice following of lacing remains at you sip throughout the glass.  The hops aroma is stong on this one. Its a nice almost roasted/burnt coffee aroma that hits the nose first, but is followed up with a nice roasted malt, that gives way to a wonderful hoppy/chocolate hops aroma that lingers in the nose.  The flavor is great, at the front of this brew the hops grab you and give you that nice bitter flavor, something you might not always expect with a brew of this nature. A sweet, chocolate and roasted malt flavors come next, followed by just a taste of a nice roasted/burnt coffee flavor that really round of this stout  The mouthful is actually full-bodied, but not overwelming. Its a nice creamy mouthful, which isn't always expect from the style. The bitterness is strong on this one, but the other flavors that effect the tongue throughout the brew, allow it to still be very enjoyable throughout.  The drink on this one, really depends on the drinker. Stout drinkers, maybe be able to take a few of these and still enjoy the brew without to many issues. The bittterness is a little harsh, and some drinkers might have some problems doing more then on. However, the flavor is great.  As I have read through the reviews, and now finally tried this for myself, I see why this is regarded as one of the higher quaility brews in the US. The balance is great, and is a wonderful stout, but still has its own unique character that actually leaves you wanting to have another brew. I will definitly seek this one out again, and store some to see what kind of flavors come from some well aged brew",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Poured black with a faint brown tinge into a tulip with a finger of slow-rising mocha/leather head that faded rather quickly to a thin film. Mild roasty aroma of coffee, licorice, and dark chocolate is balanced by a distinct hop character with spice and a bit of pine.  Moderate to slightly high carbonation and a crisp, dry mouthfeel -- very refreshing feel for a stout. Intense roasty flavors up front with cocoa, dark fruit, and molasses. This slightly sweet malt character gives way to coffee, smoke, and hop bitterness on the long finish.  A really nice stout with a great interplay of flavors and excellent drinkability (the alcohol is extremely well-masked). I think the lingering bitterness on the finish helps to counter a mouthfeel that would otherwise be a little thin.

D - a bit too bitter for me to want more than one.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Lots of lacing, my only gripe is maybe its just a little too wild in terms of bubbliness.  Charred malt aroma with a detectable hop bitterness and almost grassiness to it thats intriguing. Chocolate notes very apparent as well. Almost like a blacker Black IPA.  A sweet lactose and chocolate start with a nice malty middle. Charred yet hoppy bitterness finish that lingers. Nice balance and flavor overall, just not as big as some stouts. Very pleasant.  Very smooth and creamy feel. Excellent.  Very drinkable for an imperial stout.

345,1013,Bobby12many,4.08,"What a fantastic looking stout. Massive rocky cocoa-brown head that just dances up to the rim of my glass with a distinct liveliness. Moderate lacing with just a touch of surface head that retains itself easily between sips. The hops really linger a bit and give this a unique bitter finish that doesn't seem to adversely affect the creamy mouthfeel, which is a bit thinner than the dark and viscous appearance had led on. The hops really come through in the finish and seem as though they could become harsh after anything more than pint or two. Even with the load of bitterness this is still very enjoyable. The burnt bitter finish is a bit overpowering and lingers for quite a while after each drink and really takes the overall experience of this one down. Hopefully time will smooth that out a bit.  Its easy to see why this is such a highly regarded beer in the US. It is a well balanced stout that has a unique character which leaves you yearning for another sip. I would not hesitate to buy it again, and look forward to seeing what a year or two of cellar time will do with the flavor profile.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

S - Slight bitterness noticeable at the premier wiff. Burnt coffee and chocolate notes too.  T - I love this. Bitter, multiple hop flavors in the initial sip. The coffee and roasted malt middles out the tasting, and the chocolate flavor from chocolate malt finishes this bad boy.  M - Well carbonated. A little dry, but the flavor lingers, in a positive manner.  D - No burn or alcohol notice here. At 9%, this beer is beastly. The complex hoppiness and roasted malts keep you coming back for more.  O - This is a beast of a beer. I have been missing out for years, this great treat.

S - Not a strong aroma but what is evident are scents of Coffee and Roasted malt, with a slight hoppiness.  T - Roasted Malt is dominant but a strong hoppy bitterness follows. The bitterness becomes increasingly stronger as you drink this beer - the taste of coffee fights for its part.  M - Medium bodied and smooth, with little carbonation. The bitter roasted flavor was overwhelming though and stays with you long after your last sip.  D - The bitterness was to much for me - overwhelming.

345,1013,njbcmatt,3.63,"A- Pours an opaque black with small tan head that doesn't really linger or lace. Not an issue in my book  S- Coffee and diesel fuel notes predominate, some dried stone fruit perhaps, a good bit of resiny hop comes with it. The diesel is a slight putoff for me.  T-The alcohol seems rather masked for 9.1%, strong hop bitterness on the end, very dry. Bitterness seems to come more from hops than dark roasted malt. Leaves me thinking more imperial black IPA than RIS.  M- Quite nice, good viscosity.  D- Leaves quite the bitter aftertaste for a stout for me and again, it's a hoppy bitterness, not a roast barley, coffee-like bitterness for me.  In the end, I am still a big fan of Victory in general and will continue to try whatever they put out, but not my favorite RIS.

345,1013,mweso2000,3.9,Pours a dark black with thick three finger tan head that dissipates into a one finger lace that says with the beer. The smell is a rich toasted malt smell with chocolate and coffee. The malt is the predominant flavor with a chocolaty coffee hint. Hops and a slightly bitter taste hit you at the end. Medium mouth fell with good carbonation. This beer is a little bit too bitter for my taste. I prefer a sweeter creamy stout. Also tastes lightly burnt but not in a terrible way.

S: Roasted malts and hops make up the majority of the aroma with slight hints of dark fruits, bitter chocolates and dark roasted coffee beans.  T: Roasted malt again is a pretty dominating taste here. The hops was not as present as the nose would suggest but they are still there. A little bit of bitter coffee was present, but that was pretty much it.  M: Feels somewhat similar to a heavy cream, thicker but also creamy and a slight bit silky on the finish. The feeling goes well with this medium-light bodied beer. The taste left in the mouth is definitely one of hops and a little bit of roasted malt character.  D: The ABV is definitely not as present as you'd think, so for a 9.1% ABV, this is quite drinkable. You might get carried away if you weren't careful. Quite drinkable again, I'm not sure this would be my go-to beer for a Russian Imperial Stout, but it's definitely on the ""to-buy-again"" list.

A-Pours a deep, dark brown almost black hue with a one finger tan head with decent retention and lacing.  S-Roasted barley, vague dark dried fruits, coffee, and a hint of chocolate, all of which was too faint for style.  T-Taste is predominantly bitter, astringent, and alcohol. This is not even close to style. Should probably give it lower than a 3. The worst RIS I have ever had. Odd. This highly rated beer is very disappointing. Some chocolate, coffee, and caramel malt are present but no where near developed enough.  M-Too thin for style. And a tad flat due to inadequate carbonation. No where near rich and creamy enough.

The malt flavor in the background much more subtle then I'm used to. This brew definitely leans more toward the hop than malt.  M - more carbonated than usual, lighter than most RIS i have tasted.

Looks amazing.  s - Smells of coffee, roasted malts, and light sweet chocolate. Also some hops in the smell. Pretty enjoyable.  t - Tastes of bitter chocolate, hops, coffee toasted malts, and roasted malts. Hints of alcohol. Pretty good but a small step down from the smell in my opinion.  m - Medium to full body and moderate to high cabonation. Body is pretty creamy. Wish it was a little less carbonated.  d - This is a pretty good RIS, but not one of my favorites. I would have liked more sweet chocolate in the taste and less alcohol, as well as less carbonation.

Rich roasted espresso laced with grapefruit hops. The grapefruit comes in bitter and adds a citrus quality that switches up the profile completely. It finishes with a roasted citrus flavor that dances on the tongue.  M - Full bodied and creamy.  Awesome! The hops turns a sharp corner and is a surprise for sure but really balances out the rich chocolate malt profile. Mouthfeel is spot on and it keeps you on your toes.

Good sniffin' beer. I sniffed some fruit, some hoppy goodness...but I'm struggling with the chocolate. Maybe the old shnozola is off today. Oh! I think I smelled it...way in the back.  Just like it's appearance, the taste does not hold back; strong. It's akin to the smell, but way stronger. The smell is pleasing, whereas the taste may push you over. That doesn't mean bad either; it's just very punctual. A punctual punch. It's a roasted brew for sure, with just a lot of harsh, dark characteristics; coffee/chocolate/wood. Serious aftertaste as well.  The mouthfeel is a beast as well. It stays. And if you're not digging the beer, you'll have to wash your mouth out. Medium body that's creamy and smooth. Feels like I drank a charred beer of old time goodness.  The drinkability, for me, is very mood defining. If I'm having a good time, and looking to drink it up, there's no way I'd choose this. But if I have a pal who's looking for a new Stout to try, Storm King is the way to go.  Bottom line is the beer is solid, heavy and likable. And would you guess it! It fits incredibly well while listening to the Pittsburgh Death Metal band of the same name.

I was quite pleased to visit this old friend as the wind howled outside my window, a great stout for these chilly autumn nights. Storm King is pitch black in the glass with frothy light brown head that coats the glass with spotted lacing. Surprisingly, there is some sweetness on the nose but I mainly smelled lots of roasted coffee. As an imperial stout, the prominent hops also come as a bit of a shock. Really nice roasted malts flavors upfront that wash the tongue with a pleasing creaminess. I got lots of bitter flavors, both hops and then bitter chocolates. After a few sips the alcohol starts to warm the back of the tongue and throat. I also get some burnt coffee notes which sounds unpleasant but it works here. A really nice balance between hops and malts which is a unique take on the style.

Smell: Not really what I expected after watching this one into the glass. There's some nice toasted malt character there, but also a surprising amount of hops. I'm getting some nice coffee bitterness, but not as much of the deeper aromas one might expect.  Taste: The toasted malt force is definitely strong in this one. There is a great nutty character as well, lots of coffee bitterness, and not as much hop presence as the smell suggested.  Mouthfeel: Fairly creamy up front, with a lighter body than I anticipated. The finish is dry and bitter.  Drinkability: Hides the ABV pretty well. Not too heavy or overwhelming.

The combination of these masks the scent of alcohol completely.  Taste- My goodness, this is amazing. Roasted coffee, chocolate, and butterscotch are tasted on the way down. Very little bitterness is involved here. Light carbonation is noted throughout each sip An existence of flowered hops is also noted in each sip. The presence of a hoppy taste in this brew is a great addition to the overall stout characteristics.  Mouthfeel- Delightfully thick, a bit chewy, but without any unwanted residue left behind. Not syrupy at all and holds balance throughout.  Drinkability- Wow. Honestly i am blown away by this beer and how it didn't seem to sit in my stomach like some heavy stouts.

The flavor is a fantastic balance of bitter grapefruit and citrus with roasted chocolate. In the finish there is almost an element of burn grains. Traditionally those burnt grains might sound off-putting, but they help build the character of this beast. The mouthfeel is rich and creamy with subtle carbonation.

345,1013,nhindian,4.45,"12oz bottle poured into a Perfect Pint.  A - To start with this is just a really cool bottle. The body and neck labels are dark to match the night-time feeling of this beer coupled with an owl with a crown standing as the Storm King. Very cool and matches this style extremely well. As with most other RIS's, Storm King pours an obsidian black that swallows all light. Built a nice 2 and a half fingered, tan, foamy head, but it disappeared fairly quick which is to be expected for a beer of this alcohol. Minimal lacing but some spots here and there.  S - The nose is what really surprised me about this beer. I get smells of figs, roasted barley, and... hops? In my Russian Imperial Stout? It's more likely than you think and it works really well in my opinion. The combination of this dark beer with citrusy notes is a unique combination that works wonders for this beer.  T - This mix comes together fantastically in the taste. When I first tasted it, it was fairly cold and the hops dominated this beer, but as it warmed up, the flavors mellowed and I could taste chocolates and coffee after the initial rush of pine. Kind of as if you get two different beers with this one based on temperature. A definite shock to the palate! Only thing I can detract from this beer is that the hops sort of overwhelm, which is fine, but I purchased a RIS, not an IPA.  M - Storm King feels light to medium bodied and not a ton of carbonation. Feel doesn't follow the look of this beer at all!  D - This beer is insanely drinkable. Victory did a great job in masking the alcohol in this one and it's tough to pinpoint any trace of it at all.

Good beer to chill with.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,SkunkWorks,4.2,"12 oz bottle with a best before April 1, 2015 printed on the side (couldn't find a bottled on date) poured into a pint glass.  Look: black beer with some carbonation in it. The head in exceptionally thick especially given the style and it retains forever and leaves a lot of lacing behind.  Smell: pretty calm in terms of taste. I get some sweet malt and roasted chocolate and brown sugar smells.  Taste: coffee, dark chocolate, molasses and some earthiness are present in the taste. There's some hop bitterness but not too much. Generally, its just very sweet.  Feel: very smooth and enjoyable. Not much bitterness and no alcohol bite.  Drink: very high. I think if I had blind tasted this that I would have identified the style as a normal stout rather than a RIS because the drinkability is so high. I could very easily go through a few of these.  Overall, a nice accessible RIS. Definitely give this one a try.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,TheSupremeAJ,4.33,"Appearance - Very dark coca-cola like color. Large head with lots of bubbles. Poured from 12oz bottle into pint glass. Very inviting and attractive stout.  Smell - Sweet, malty, and roasty with a chocolate/brown sugar thing going on.  Taste - Coffee and dark bittersweet chocolate. Hops are shown through and really balance out this beer, as if they are dueling each other across my taste buds. Each characteristic is present, not too over or under powering each other.  Mouthfeel - Very smooth and well carbonated. A real treat.  Drinkability - I could drink a few of these. The ABV is well hidden. The flavors do not insult my palate in a way to not enjoy two or three.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,zhanson88,3.93,"Appearance: Storm King Stout pours black, but not necessarily the thickest RIS I've seen. Regardless, there is a full 3 fingers of dark tan head that has awesome retention. Lacing is nice and open and there is a ton of it that remains for the duration of the beer.  Smell: Roasted dark malts, coffee, bitter dark chocolate and burned toast stand out quite nicely.  Taste: Roasted dark malts and coffee show up on the front end, as well as a charred, smoky taste. There is a very nice hoppy bite on the back end. I was pleasantly surprised to find this amount of balance in this RIS. Not an overly complex taste, but still solid.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Mouthfeel is pretty medium bodied, a bit thin and not overly impressive for an RIS. Overall this is a very solid RIS and absolutely worth a try. For 9.1% ABV it hides it's alcohol very well. Not disappointing at all.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,stimulus,4.4,"I've already had a few of these bottles as well as a pour at the brewpub on cask. Very good both ways, but I'll review the cask after the next time I try it, as I did not take notes last time.  Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a snifter.  A: Pours jet black with a one finger tan head that leaves lacing all the way down. S: Chocolate, malts, brown sugar, and a bit of hops on the finish. T: The taste begins with chocolate, follows up sugar sweetness, and finishes with a competition between malt and hops, almost as if the aftertaste goes back and forth between the two. M: Very smooth and well carbonated for such a heavy beer style. A second would certainly not be out of the question. D: It comes in sixers, but buyer beware, after a few you may end up on the floor.  As a side note, I really cannot wait to see how this ages, and at $11 per six pack and produced year round, this may be the best value for an imperial stout brewed in the US any time of the year. I'd say it's right up there with Weyerbacher Old Heathen, Great Divide Yeti, Hoppin Frog BORIS, North Coast Old Rasputin, and Lagunitas Imperial Stout, having tried all of them in the past month or two. And unlike everything besides Old Heathen, this one comes in six packs AND has a bottled on date so you can taste vintages later.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Transatlantic,4.28,"A - Burnt motor oil black with a nice creamy head that slowly dissipates, leaving very good lacing.  S - Roasted malt character, with only a slight smell of chocolate. There really isn't too much more after that.  T - Actually quite good. At first note, the bitterness comes in quite lightly with the roasted flavor dominating the taste. As it goes down, the bitterness really starts to kick in and you find somewhere in it that dark bitter chocolate that's lurking around, not showing itself quite as well. I want to say there's vanilla in it somewhere, but it could be the sneaky chocolate, tricking my taste buds.  M - Typically thick full bodied, as an Imperial Stout should be. The bitter roasted flavor stays with you long after your last sip.  D - Though the bitterness can be a bit overpowering, drinking this with a piece of a chocolate candy bar or some other sweet dessert to balance out the bitterness makes this beer soar over the top.  Overall, it's a pretty average Imperial Stout, but that's not to say it isn't good. Imperial Stouts are practically the crown beers, so saying it's ""average"" isn't an insult.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,onefiveseven,3.84,"This beer pours a jet black, reminds me of the Goose Island Bourbon County's. Smell is average, roasted malts and alcohol, none of the usual oak/bourbon/chocolate you usually find in an imperial stout.  The taste is good if not a little lacking, again, I know its not an impy but we've come to expect big flavors from our stouts these days, that being said, it's still delicious. I wonder what I would of thought of it had I not experiences a BCS or the like, it certainly disguises itself as a very high quality imp stout to those new to the style.  Drinkability is average I find. I usually can have about 2 and i'm through. Leaves a smoky aftertaste on the tongue which is hard to get past after about 1 1/2, tastes a lot like I just finished smoking a decent cigar.  That being said, the accessibility of this stout makes it pretty easy to pick up again (and I will) if just for the high quality of a good ol imperial stout that I can get on my walk home from work at a real reasonable price.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Smell - Roasty, smoky, coffee, cacao beans, some spicy smelling flower.  Taste - Extremely balanced. Initial bitterness, some alcohol burn, then changes to sweet chocolate then finishes with a bready bitter sweet chocolate.  Mouthfeel - Slightly chewy with light carbonation.  Drinkability - Goes down pretty smooth, if you drink it too fast you will feel more alcohol burn. It has pretty good drinkability for the alcohol percentage, I could have two of them and be content.

AROMA Deep....nutty,smoky,fruit (raisin + prune) hop buds,roasty,toffee,coffee....a LOT happening.  TASTE A Robust Malt lead that then seems on the border of Darkest Chocolate and darkest coffee. The Hops are there and as the malt side fades,there's a rich resinous hop finish.  with Storm King,sweetness is only suggested. The Malt side is doing DARK THINGS, robust things,there's a flash of brown sugar or a stray raisin but the hops and the blackened malts step up to keep it serious. Like a Storm. Not my first visit with this King,so I'm less surprised this time. The Hop side is big and zingy for a stout. As it warms the chocolate/malt side does gain and dominate. If you lean to the Hops/Dark IPA side,do it colder. It's then a different beer...also exceptional. As it warms up the malt side,a few sweet touches show. The Malts and Hops tend to merge into a flavor like those fancy high cocoa % chocolates...and then theres a lingering hop finish All good.  Mouth...this is 2 beers in one. I like to start it cold and not hurry. THAT is the magic of this one. It starts of as a cold and intense DIPA and a few minutes later is a different brew as the malt side tilts the balance and eventually comes to dominate.  plenty of body here. Big finish of deluxe hops with the bitter dark roasty malts adding to that. Quite the Hop Wallop but also a Black Hole of big Maltiness.  Drinkable? To a point...obviously I like it but Storm King is as ""over the top"" as a Stout can get without messing up. In it's rather nice price bracket,Old Rasputin and Northwind execute the classic,textbook Imp stout VERY nicely.

Big malty aroma. Surprisingly fruity, with some standout boozy sugars. Deep dark chocolate aroma in there too.  Hard to describe. For an imperial stout there are some really complex flavours, I mean it's not just a booze and coffee bomb. Dark alcohol soaked fruit on the tip of the tongue. Rolls over with some nice bitter chocolate. Finishes up with some wonderful roasted espresso and a hit of bitter hops just to kick it up a notch. Hot aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is wonderful.

345,1013,Phelps,3.61,"Poured from a bottle picked up during a recent trip to San Diego and into a tulip glass. No freshness date, though the bottle does advise me to enjoy it by Feb. 18, 2015. I'm a little ahead of the curve, apparently.  Looks: mountainous. The beer flows from the bottle a deep mocha brown that coalesces in the glass to inky blackness. A massive, craggy head the color of cocoa powder rises from the depths and placates itself atop the liquid for several minutes before falling to a tacky half-finger crown. Lace grips the edges in soapy explosions.  Smells: chocolatey. Bitter dark chocolate bars and cocoa nibs, toasted sourdough, some raisins, earthy hops. A bit of coffee emerges as it warms, melding with the cocoa flavors to create aromas akin to mocha lattes.  Tastes: roasted. Charred, even. Acrid, like burnt toast. A tiny bit of dark chocolate sneaks in as the beer closes in on room temperature. No hint of sweetness here; it's been torched away by the kiln.  Feels: like steady improvement. The body never really hits its true form until i'm about 3/4 of the way through the glass. But when it does, it's lovely: the carbonation is subtle, the beer is medium-bodied, and it feels nice and creamy about the palate. A bit of warming alcohol travels down the throat like mild heartburn.  Drinks: it's decent, but forgettable. For a 9 percent beer, it goes down pretty easily, but I like my stouts with a little more sweetness and a lot more complexity.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

The taste starts with a bit of chocolate before fading into the dark coffee. The beer finishes dry with a slight hoppiness. The presence of oak is also noticeable.  Storm King is nicely carbonated with a decent mouth feel, but it feels a little thin for an imperial stout. Not a huge deal, but I expect a little thicker mouth feel from an imperial stout. Because it is slightly thin, it is very drinkable. A little more body might make this a sipping beer, which a good imperial should be in my opinion.  A good, solid beer, but not completely what I was expecting from an imperial stout.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Pretty easy to drink, really tasty, and low enough on the alcohol to drink multiples.

If you look closely the bubbles in the head are very tiny at first, then grow exponentially bigger as the head airs out unleashing the beers aroma. Zig-zag patterns of lace outline the glass.

Transitions nicely into a dark roast coffee(my favorind kind of coffee). Gets dry towards the end. The malt backbone which is present, but refuses to show up until the end of the sip with a heavy roasted flavor. Alcohol becomes very warming on the way down.  M- Medium to full bodied. Every tastebud is drenched as the beer seeps into the palate with each sip. They do a good job of keeping the high abv from drying the mouth out.

Slight reddish hues can be seen on the rim while drinking. Checkered lace is left randomly on glass. The head holds retention around rim for the length of the glass. S : Not as over powering as I would have thought. With subtle notes of caramel and oak, the notion of a malty brew is in store. A burnt sweetness I scamming through. T/M: A sweet malt forward taste is what is presented on first sip, but complexities are found of dry hoppniess. A finish that displays good hop use, makes this a overall great stout. Great classic flavors, set this an imperial standard. Mouthfeel is a creamy sweetness, that ends and leaves e mouth slightly dry. D : A great stout indeedx, but very typical of the style, not to say that it is not up there with the top in the style, but nothing screams out super outstanding.

There was a hop presence but the barley taste overpowered it. Oak and coffee finish.  M - Nice. A little carbonation flirts with the tongue as the bold flavors whack at it with their presence in the form of a deceiving heaviness that stays on your tongue after you've sent the current gulp south.

Some alcohol peeks through. The hops are nice and fresh and their is a bit of a coffee presence with the toasty malt. The aftertaste is very toasted.  Not crazy about the feel of this one. The carbonation is too foamy and frothy and the body feels too thin for the style. Not horrible, but not top tier in the mouthfeel department either.  Drinks well enough.

On top is a creamy and thin mocha-colored head with thin sheets of lacing on the glass. Head retention is a few seconds before thinning away into a cap. Aroma is chocolate and coffee-oriented with a thin malt presence in the background. There's a bit of pungency, which I'm guessing is from some burnt coffee beans, as well as a good amount of alcoholic fumes towards the end.  Well.. first of all, the boozyness smothers the whole flavor profile completely. From start to finish, the palate is emerged in heat. I had to really attempt to discern the individual components. Some chocolate, malt sweetness, hop bitterness and burnt coffee astringency. I'd recommend putting some age on this to smooth out the flavors, especially the alcohol.  Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and drinkability is low to moderate, depending on how boozy you like your beers.

S: The aroma isn't what a stout should be. There isn't much chocolate or coffee notes, however this brew is very roasty like a porter. The hops in this brew are evident, and you can almost pick up a little fruitiness. Notes of anise are present too.  T: This is a hoppy stout. Chocolate pokes through and rushes your pallet as the beer warms. Hops do add a slight citrus, but the roasted barley malt is the main hitter in the flavor profile. Anise is also present.  MF: The mouthfeel is surprising smooth considering how hopped up this brew is. The body is medium.  D: Drinkability is good too. Definitely will improve with age.  Overall, Storm King is an above average stout at best. My bottle is somewhat fresh, I would suggest aging this beer for 3+ years, and letting the hops mellow and the chocolate to shine trough.

Watching the lacing decend was awesome, too. I kind of felt like a geologist analyzing sedimentary rock strata for bit, but then I took a sip and snapped out of that silly ass daydream.  The huge hop aroma was promised on the bottle, but I didn't think it would really deliver quite like it did. Very bright, sharp hops with the coffee and roasted malt aromas lurking underneath.  The hops are very aggressive, with grapefruit and piney flavors really coming to the fore. The roasty malt, burnt toast, espresso, and bitter chocolate flavors really took a backseat on this beer.  The body is a lot thinner than what I would have expected, and the clean bright bitterness made this almost refreshing, but it's so intense that it's not very quaffable. The booze is there, but not obtrusive. This could be more than a sipper if the hops were a little tamer, but it would get damn dangerous, so that's kind of a good thing.

I imagine the girlfriend will hate it though since this combines two things she abhors, imperial stouts and hoppy beers. More for me, I guess :)",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Bubba83,3.53,"Well then, I suppose I'll finally review a beer I've had at least 10 times, Victory Storm King. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Snifter at around 50 degrees.  Appears jet black with a dark tan creamy head, about one finger width. Good retention and really good lacing.  Coffee, chocolate, roast, smoke, and rubbing alcohol. Maybe some faint hints of vanilla. Lots of hops finish up, seems almost like simcoe in nature.  This stout is extremely hoppy. So much so that I think it detracts from the beer. Where I'd expect to get a good hit of chocolate and coffee, I get huge spicy hops instead that just mask everything. It's still pretty good, but I'm just not getting what I look for in the style. Finishes up with a good deal of alcohol heat and medicinal cherry alcohol.  Mouthfeel is really quite good, oily and big, decent amount of chew here, with the right level of bubbles.  Drinkability is hindered by a medium level of heat and too much spice from the hops. It's not hard to drink, but it isn't easy either. Overall still a classic, but there's just a lot better stuff out there now. And if you want a hoppy stout, Old Rasputin is a much better choice.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,GarrettMD,4.15,"A - Pours a nice jet black with 2 fingers very foamy dark tan head. Head stays around for quite a while, lacing coats the glass.  S - Roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, some vanilla, everything you expect from an imperial stout. Fairly sweet smelling for the style however. Very nice balance of all the aromas. Slight alcohol note in the background, but not much at all.  T - Rich roasted malts dominate the flavor, chocoalte and coffee alternate being the dominant background flavor. Vanilla makes a slight appearance at the end along with some slight alcohol flavor. Hops are also not completely dominated by the malt as is the case with most imperial stouts. There is a nice earthy hop flavor near the finish as well.  M - Heavy bodied definitely, wasn't too thick of a pour but it is definitely a thick beer. Creamy on the tongue. Finish is bitter with some alcohol.  D - Good drinkability, I couldn't see myself drinking multiple of these in one sitting just because of how heavy it is, but the alcohol doesn't come through much at all. Very easy to drink.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Naugros,4.15,"I have reviewed so many stouts to this point that I thought about not reviewing this one at all. Why? It looks like, smells like and tastes like a stout. But just saying that doesn't do this justice. It is exceptionally well-executed and remarkably balanced. All the keys markers for a stout are there and it doesn't try to overachieve. There are no cocoa nibs, cayenne pepper, coffee, smoke or a double-digit ABV. It's just a really, really nice beer and this one has an amazingly smooth body that is the consistency of velvet. This one is incredible in its standardness...yes, I know that's not a word, but it fits.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

T - Sweet balanced with malty with a kick of hops. There is no alcohol burn with brew.  M - Mouthfeel seemed a little light for a RIS. A more ""chewy"" beer was expected. Overall it made it seem like a smaller beer than it was.  D - I enjoyed this beer especially the hop level.

Forms a thin head of small brown bubbles and larger ones that cling to the interface of the beer and the glass. The head breaks quickly leaving some lacing on the glass. Looks good.  The aroma is mildly sweet and roasty. No alcohol in the nose, which is good. Smells pretty good, not very complex.  Beer is medium bodied and has some nice carbonation on the palate. Its sweet and smooth with high roast in the back that shows up as almost an aftertaste. Overall the beer is smooth and highly drinkable. Its kind of sweet, very roasty, very good.

Body of the beer is just about black with the tiniest bit of light creeping though around the edges.  S: Toasty malt. Lots of sweetness. Milk chocolate and just a little coffee. Some cocoa powder. Overall the aroma is pretty restrained.  T: Not as hoppy as I recall. Lots of sweet dark fruit. Mild citric hops. Sweet, creamy coffee. Chocolate syrup. Stiff bitterness in the finish.  M: Smooth and slick, just slightly powdery.  D: Moderately high. Not as interesting as others in this style. Alcohol is very well hidden.  A classic that sadly, when revisited, isn't as good as I remember. Storm King is a great example of how far craft beer has come. A few years ago this was a world class example of the style, today it's an afterthought. This is a thoroughly enjoyable beer that is harmed by it's ubiquitous availability in an era of one-offs and brewery only releases.

If i didnt read the bottle first, i would have said this beer is 5-6% abv!  Mouthfeel - Very nice,smooth, it didnt burn my tounge, i can drink a porter or a oatmeal stout right after this one.  Drinkability - I could see getting into trouble with this beer. Its so smooth and tasty for high alcohol beer, i could drink 4-5 of these in a sitting. Another great beer from victory.

345,1013,TheStove,4.32,"Firm consistent pour into a snifter.  Instantly received scents of malt and chocolate once beer started to pour. Repeated placement of nose in glass rendered similar experience with the flavors of the beer evident on the palette before tasting.  Poured with a nice 3 fingers of foam, slowly giving away to a consistent finger for at least first 10 minutes. Nice and opaque, like a frosty glass of crude oil.  Excellent mouth feel, mixed tastes of toasted malt, chocolate and molasses with a slight hop bite near the end. After swallowing, nice notes of coffee and chocolate stay on the tongue. Bitter with a bit of dryness remains until successive sips.  Found the mouthfeel slightly odd at times, fluctuating at times from thick to fluid however it wasn't enough to detract of the enjoyment of this excellent beer.

Bought at Bevmo in LA/Hollywood. Damn that was some nice tail that weekend.  Massive jet black, great cherry cola head, perfect 1.5"" thick, recedes slightly. Good aroma, slight chocolate and lesser coffee.  Great taste, aspects of an Irish Dry Stout and Milk Stout here, dry, then alternates creamy, still a good hop bitterness to the beer despite being aged. Aging really smoothed out any alcohol, wasn't noticeable in the slightest way. Chewy enough, but not trying to be the super massive style (10-20%) of IS. Give it a little cherry topping, as that comes out. This is a great, more available alternative to KBS. I'd take KBS first, but not by much.

Pours a dark black color with more than a finger of mocha colored fluff for a head. Really good retension as the head sits uneven in the glass from sporatic bubbles and crators where a solid layer of foam previously resided.  The aroma has a surprising amount of citrus hops, slightly herbal and grassy along with a solid presence of alcohol sting in the nose.  Taste includes all the described hop characteristics that were introduced by the nose. Dark burnt grain flavors indicating coffee and alcohol are evident in both flavor and warmth. Half way through the experience, more grainy sweetness comes through like chocolate.  The body of this brew is medium to full with a moderately low level of carbonation. Very drinkable and it would be a crime not to enjoy for only $2.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

S - roasted malts, fresh hops, faint coffee, caramel and chocolate, earthiness feeling to the aroma. Take a second to swirl the glass around and the piney hops come alive in a big way, very refreshing, especially in a stout  T - sweet beginnings, chocolate and coffee come together in a mocha-like presence, almost like a milk stout. Hints of caramel add to the sweetness and linger on throughout. Turns over to a decent bitter in the finish due to the roasted malt presence. Good hop presence, carbonation is prevalent but nowhere close to being overkill. Good balance in this stout.  M - thick. Chewy. Coats the mouth well, leaves an aftertaste of fresh mocha, chocolate and roasted malts.  D - surprisingly affordable, not hard to find in the Philadelphia area. Hides the alcohol well while delivering flavor and good transition. Different flavors, scents, hop presence and roasted maltiness make this this a complex beer.

Decent head retention and lacing on the glass.  The aroma shows a bit of roasted malt, chocolate and coffee mixed with an herbal hoppiness. The herbal flavor seems to come through particularly strong, especially for a stout.  The taste starts with some sweet chocolate and roasty flavors. It starts to take a turn for the worse in the finish though. I'm getting a very harsh herbal, burnt, coffee, dry, bitterness in it. It's almost like a burnt hoppiness that is extremely dry. It leaves a herbal smoke like flavor on the palate. Not pleasant at all and not at all what I was expecting from this beer.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied at best and carbonation is moderate. Drinkability isn't good for me, I really didn't think the flavors meshed well and it left a harsh, burnt, chocolate, hop flavor in the finish that I didn't enjoy.

Served in small tulip  A- Nice looking beer. Great big brown head, cascaded beautifully down to a thin layer. The rest is black and if you look hard enough you can find some brown in the edges.  S- A nice hoppiness is what I first got but got quickly replaced by chocolate, a little bit of coffee and alcohol. Some milkiness to it all too.  T- Whoa this is deep. Very roasty coffe and cocoa. Almost like burnt sourdough rye bread. Ends with some green and grapefruit hops which fits in nicely. Quality whole grain bread after-taste. Reminds of a few smoked beers. As you get used to it, the hops come more and more out which is okay for me right now because I'm kind of in an IPA mood.  M- Thick liquid but not that big a mouthfeel. Very low carbonation.  D- Very good. Very satisfying, very tasty. A six-pack is a bad (9.10%) but possible idea. An easy to drink Imperial stout which still packs a whole lot of substance. What more could you want?

345,1013,ToasterChef,4.68,"Served cask'd, in a tulip glass, at the Great Lost Bear. It's an opaque dark brown liquid, with a big tan foam head. There is lots of rising carbonation in the glass, that slowed and finally disappeared. Some clinging carbonation remains on the sides of the glass. The aroma isn't as strong as I expected it to be. It can detect some roasted malts and some chocolate. Perhaps the cask format has limited it's aroma? Wow, what a stout! I can see why this used to the top ranked beer here. It starts out creamy and slightly sweet, with a kiss of chocolate. I swallow, and the bitter malt flavors come out. It's not a coffee bitterness, per se, but more of a roasted whole grain flavor. After swallowing, there is a coat that has a dark chocolate combination of sweet and bitter that lingers on for a long time. This is a very smooth medium bodied beer. Not too much carbonation; at least it isn't overbearing. There is a lot of coat left behind, which can sometimes be a problem if it is sticky or too sweet, but this really works well. Overall, this is a very drinkable beer. The high ABV is completely hidden, as is the sweetness put off but the amount of malt in this beer. This really is a great beer, and I'm very glad I could try it on cask. I've passed over the Storm King bottles for other stouts a number of times, but no longer.

A nice dose of hops make their way in to balance things out. Alcohol is apparent.  Taste - Very hoppy for an imperial stout (Ah, I now appreciate this). I taste the normal qualities of an R.I.S. with some roasted malts and chocolate flavors with a nice balance of hoppiness. Better than I recall overall. Pleasantly nice, but not nearly as good as some other imperial stouts.  Mouthfeel - Unexpectedly low bodied and smooth considering the amount of flavor and alcohol.

345,1013,Ryan011235,3.65,"Poured into a snifter on 12/22/09; cellar temperature  Very dark, scorched brown settles to black. Impenetrable, even when held to the light. Poured a billowy two finger dark tan head. Good retention & lace for a while. Thin retention throughout; nice swaths of lace.  The nose seems a bit muted due to the quantity of foam, but it's still reasonably potent & smells enticing. All things considered there is an intense aroma of roasted malts: chocolate, touch of cocoa, toffee & dark sugars. Hints of figs & nuts. Wisps of smoke. Faint earthy notes & a mild booziness. Burnt/charred undertones. Notions of citric hops.  Bittersweet chocolate upfront with the particular kind of bitterness only a spot of coffee or espresso can provide. Hoppy bite around the edges; maximizing the bitterness of the beer without being overbearing. While these three flavors are dominant hints of roasted/burnt malts & dark bread are also to be had. Not particularly complex.  Full bodied with smooth & creamy carbonation. Some alcohol heat is apparent, especially for the first few sips. Nice grittiness. Roasted malts & bitter coffee linger.  This is a pretty solid sipper. The nose suggests much more complexity than the taste is able to muster. Even still, it's tasty. I suppose I shouldn't complain too much.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,jporf911,4.48,"Appearance- 5 out of 5. This stuff looks great; it's like peering through a mocha-curtain into the blackest night, as if the sun itself had been washed away by a thick tide of dark, mysterious beer many years ago. The beer pours with an deep brown ocean of three-finger head that is retained throughout the entire drinking experience, and the lacing is so thick and sticky that it practically coats the glass even once the beer itself is long gone.  Smell- 4.5 out of 5. This beer smells as powerful as it looks. A smell of burnt sweet molasses malt, charcoal, strong hops, and moderate citrus dominate the nose, along with an undertone of solvent alcohol. It's interesting; very interesting.  Taste- 4.5 out of 5. This beer taste even more powerful than it smells! The only thing holding it back from being a 5 is that it doesn't taste much like a Stout at all. All of the component tastes are there, but they come together to form something entirely different-- and delicious. The sweet malt strikes the tongue first, quickly followed by dark roasted malt, chocolate, and more citrus than I've ever tasted in a Stout. It almost reminds me of one of those chocolate oranges. Not bad, but unusual. There is an undertone of pine and other earthy, notes that are soon replaced by the bitterness of the slightly spicy hops at the end. The aftertaste of unsweetened chocolate and sweet roasted malt is thick and sticks around, much like the lacing. If you're numbed by the sheer number of flavors I've mentioned, your tongue won't be; instead, it will revel in it like skinny-dipping in the midnight sky.  Mouthfeel- 4 out of 5. The feisty carbonation wars with the thick, full body of the beer. Not as crisp as Guinness and not as creamy as Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout, it bridges a pleasant middle ground but offers a sharper alcohol sting than the other two.  Drinkability- 4.5 out of 5. This is a mysteriously brooding, immaculately complicated beer that is supremely drinkable considering its full body and 9.1% ABV. I could easily make a session out of this. Stout lovers be warned: this isn't traditional, but it is exceptional. Definitely a Victory in more ways than one.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,djmichaelk,3.71,"12oz bottle courtesy of Bucwild (thanks Dave!), into a perfect pint.  A - Very dark brown, with reddish edges. Three fingers of mocha head, receding to a solid cap after a minute or so. Pretty good legs emerging after a quick swirl. Very nice looking beer.  S - Hmmm. Very sweet aromas coming from this brew. Dark roast coupled with dark chocolate, raisins, and burnt sugar. Maybe some toffee at the end. If I didn't know any better, I'd think it was a blend of a RIS and a quad.  T - Very sweet tasting, with plenty of chocolate cake and brown sugar up front, some dark roasted malt in the midpalate, and finishing with more chocolate and a slight nuttiness. Alcohol is noticeable but somewhat welcome.  M - Not quite as thick as I'd expect for the style. Carbonation is not very refined, and fights against the thickness of the beer. Large bubbles make it dance, but this is not what I necessarily want in a RIS.  D - The abv is definitely there -- I'm feeling it a bit after the one. The taste is nice, but I can see where the sweetness could maybe get to me after a couple. I like the alcohol burn, but it's probably not for everyone.  O - This is a very nice beer -- especially for the price. While it has its faults, I wish I had this readily available to me.

345,1013,strangefate,3.74,"Pours a beautiful jet black with a thick tan head which leaves nice lacing throughout the beer. The smell is not very prominent (as in I accidently got beer in my nose because I got too close), and it's mostly nutty. The taste is a bit coffee, a pronounced hop presence for a stout, and a hint of smokiness. This is more carbonated than most Imperials and is pretty smooth and somewhere in between medium and full bodied, yet I personally don't feel that that translates into much better drinkability.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Slatetank,4.13,"I had this fron the first cask served at Al's of Hampden -served cask temp in a Nonic  A - an opaque shiny black like an eight ball - the head quickly drops and is medium brown but settles to a ring with small beading. The lace is decent and the beer is nice to look at in the glass  S -The smell is good with bittersweet cocoa, burnt caramel and mild spice with a hint of pine from the hops and slight deep roasted coffee. There is a mild fusel element in the alcohol aroma with malt having a lot of toasted and an almost cinnamon-like woodiness with the scent of the dark sugar verging on molasses with it aroma  M - The feel is good on cask, a bit smoother than normal c02 draft, but just as bitter with lots of roast and mild sweetness in texture. The acidity is downplayed and only light astringent notes from the dark grain is detected with light smoke tinged and spice hanging in with the warming alcohol that lingers in the long bitter finish  T - I attribute the flavor to a high good amount of high alpha hop combined with a modest flavor of citrusy coffee with the dark caramel notes leading into a high cocoa content chocolate taste which has a slight amount of alcohol in the flavor toward the middle while the pine notes from the hops criss cross back and forth on the buds.  D - I probably haven't had this for at least 4 months or so and before that at least a year, but it definitely exceeded my expectations. This is a very good tasting and stout and having it on cask is the way to try it.

A very enticing aroma.  Lots and lots of dark roasted malts. Piney hops and dark fruit flavors. Very well balanced, not as bitter as I was expecting it to be but not as sweet either. A pleasant alcohol presence as well.

345,1013,SpeedwayJim,3.17,"Thanks to Mag00n for this one. Poured from a 64oz. growler into a Duvel tulip.  A: Standard pour yields a semi-coarse 1 finger light mocha head that dissipates quickly. Beer is opaque and black as night. Lacing is spotty and sparse.  S: Nose is liquorice laced with sweet booze and onion? Faint chocolate, toffee, and rusty metal in the background. There's also a bit of unripened plum and copper in there as well as grassy hops. A little odd but strangely enticing.  T: Roasted malt and black coffee upfront with perhaps one of the biggest liquorice flavors I've had in a stout to date. Alcohol lingers in the background but is well subdued and never takes over. No fruit, chocolate, cocoa, or any flavor that I usually associate with a stout. Metallic and oddly oniony. Finish is liquorice and dirt. Aftertaste is a sour hop bitterness.  M: Medium bodied, good carbonation, with a smoot, yet lively mouthfeel. Not oily in the sense that an Imperial Stout usually is. Finish is messy. Aftertaste lingers.  D: This beer is really unlike any other imperial stout I've ever had and in this case, I don't mean it in a good way. Just... very weird overall and I can't get past the metallic- liquorice taste combination. Also a bit thin bodied for me. Let's just say I'll donate the rest of the growler to a friend who might appreciate it a bit more.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,SterlingNass,2.08,"Had a very nice head that stayed until the last few drinks.  Had a very nice nutty coffee smell to it. Head was a dark milk chocolate look to it.  First taste had a very coffee hops bitter taste that gave a very hard kick to my taste buds, probably from the 9.1% alc. Every drink after that became much more bitter to where I couldn't almost finish the last few drinks.  Seemed very thin and had no point to the bitterness.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,dwilson01,4.5,"Obtained courtesy of an SD buddy, thanks man!!  poured from a 12oz into my arrogant bastard pint glass the dark tan mocha colored head brims the glass with a perfect 2 fingers of creamy froth. dissipates evenly and slowly leaving lacy fingers along the glass.  The scent is strong coffee, definitely intense enough to be considered espresso, it has toasted malt, definitely smooth enough to have crystal malt, and there is chocolate in there as well as some molasses. In spite of all the heavy scents I also pick up a lighter more refreshing aromatic hopping as well, not a distinct smell but you can tell it's hopped up.  The flavor, I can't say enough about it and it's for sure an ""onion"" type beer with many many layers and stages to the profile. Initially I get the floral hops and a small amount of sweeter vanilla combined with a woody pine and oak (makes sense to me...pine~hops, vanilla~oak). This goes straight to the malty flavors I initially smelled, creamy chocolate and coffee although the lingering vanilla combines with these to make a taste which reminds me of a vanilla cappuccino. The finish is where the hopping really shines and rounds this bad boy out, a tiny amount of bitterness, first you think from the oak but it stays with you and I swear to you, bittersweet orange infused chocolate.  The mouthfeel is another great aspect of this particular brew, it's a heavy stout in general and lets you know it's there with the imperial stout full body characteristics. But the difference, and highlight is due to the massive hopping which initially lightens, and at the finish refreshes the palate with an uplift of flavor.  I could sip on this beer for days and be a happy man, bottom line this is not a great brew, this is a bomb brew that has me stoked on life right now. For 6 pack sold imperial stouts I have had this ranks top 3, if you see it I highly recommend grabbing it especially if you're on the west coast as I have only seen it in one location in my entire life.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,alleykatking,4.3,"Poured from 12oz bottle.  A- Pours a inky black color. One finger darker tan head falls to a light cap on the beer. Some light lacing on the sides of the glass.  S- Roasted malts right off the bat which is to be expected. Light chocolate notes with a sprinkle of coffee. Also, some light floral hops in the backend of this one balances out the malts a little bit.  T- This is where I think the beer shines. Roasted malts right off the bat on this one. This melts into a light chocolate sweetness for a short second before turning into a coffee feel. The coffee taste isn't dark but more espresso. Light bitter hops in the back end smooth out the entire malt front.  M- Heavy mouthfeel. Carbonation is good for the style. Oily feeling left all over the palate. Roasted malts left on the palate with a chocolate style aftertaste. Clean flavors overall. Flavor profile is good and flavors burst.  D- I see why this is a good stout and I see why people like it. The ABV is kind of limiting on this one along with the heavy feeling. Good rep on the style and this one ages well.

Storm King poured black with a thick milk-chocolate colored head that dissipated quickly leaving thin weak rings of lace. It's incredibly delicious. It has notes of bitter chocolate and espresso and leaves a lingering smooth velvety feel on the tongue with a slightly bitter finish.

Very robust espresso with dark cocoa and a light hoppiness to complement the overall coffee flavors. Alcohol is well blended; almost unnoticeable. Kind of foamy mouthfeel and fairly thin for the style.  For all the coffee descriptions, this really didn't leave a feeling of drinking a coffee stout. It's very smooth and blended with a very rich malt profile. I didn't care for the foamy mouthfeel that much but I suppose it did try to reinforce the overall taste of the beer.

M: It feels medium- to full-bodied on the palate and there is some warming from the alcohol. D: This beer does a very good job at hiding the alcohol from the smell and taste.

345,1013,Phillyphilms,3.96,"A very well balanced RIS. I think the hop additions makes a nice balance with the extreme malt and the alcohol bite which can be tasted up front.  It's a black as the ace of spades with a nice brown head that hold strong for a while and laces nicely as you drink it down.  Smells of coffee, chocolate and the 9% ABV it contains.  Has a nice balance of malt and some hops to keep her honest. Toffee and chocolate and coffee in the mouth and a finish that stays put for a while.  Is a full body, almost alcohol and waxy on the tounge but in a good way.  I think it is a great example of a Russian Imperial Stout. Not as tasty as some others but considering the 9abv its an easy drinking bigger stout. Will try again and again.. and probably again :)",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Maybe a little peat far off.  Tastes of deep dark coffee and waxy crayons? Very good. The small amount of detectable hops keep the dark chocolate flavors from getting too powerful. Roasty and good.  Motor oil all the way. Thick and syrupy with the alcohol giving off a little heat.

345,1013,trevorjn06,3.88,"Pours a thick, rich, almost black. The 2 fingers of head is brownish tan and it sticks around for a few minutes. The aroma is dark roasted malt, chocolate and coffee with some up-front hops. The hops are resiny, piney and herbal and I pick up a bit of alcohol aroma that reminds me of a martini in a way, salty.  Taste is quite full-bodied, rich roasted malt and dark chocolate with some alcohol warmth. It starts with dark chocolate, a bit bitter. This transitions into a grainy feeling espresso flavor and finishes with some roasted barley bitterness and hop flavors. The finish is a bit warm on the alcohol but also has a long, lingering dark chocolate and espresso taste, overall quite nice but I wish the alcohol warmth were less prominent. As the beer warms it gets a bit more smooth and easy drinking, though still quite powerful and strong.  Overall this beer is a very nice imperial stout, drinkable for a beer of it's strength with a nice finish and some wonderful chocolate and espresso flavors. The odd salty/martini flavor is a bit off-putting. Don't get me wrong, I love martinis, but this saltiness is a bit out of place.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Maybe a little bit of citrusy hop goodness is detectable as well.  M - Pretty thick body with a fair amount of carbonation.  D - Pretty drinkable for the ABV and style.

The flavor profile replicates the nose, with the moderate sweetness countered nicely by a goodly amount of bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel is pretty good, with the beer showing a long, smooth, full finish. Drinkability is OK, though there's a bit of heat in the finish that doesn't play well with the sweet licorise.

S: Toasted malt and dark bitter coco. Slight burnt toast and some sort of earthy/fresh smell that I can't quite put my finger on.  T: A malt bomb with hops! Huge toasted malt flavor takes over from the start. Dark bittersweet chocolate and a touch of coffee ads a little bitterness. No sweet malt to be found, but its not dry by any means. Floral hops are present throughout.  This is an odd RIS, its good, but it seems like RISs and Imperial Stouts are sweeter. There is no sweetness to be found here, but this is not a bad thing at all, just different. Its like an imperial oatmeal stout...  M/D: Full body, great thick and very smooth mouthfeel.

345,1013,busternuggz,3.11,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass, an opaque black color with a thick 3/4"" light brown head. The head subsides soon but retains a thin presence, leaving some lacing. The nose is subtle with a faintly unpleasant plastic-like smell and masked cocoa and molasses. The taste comes on aggressively potent, bitter, and moderately boozy, mellowing slightly into an espresso flavor and a little bit of very dark chocolate, like baking chocolate, with a somewhat unpleasant long-lasting bitter finish. It's huge and oppressive, which is kind of admirable but a little wince-inducing, and it's not very complex, mostly gigantic and bitter. As it warms the plastic smell leaves and it is a little less punishing on the palate but little else comes forward, maybe a little more roasty malt character. It has a pretty nice texture, a little viscous. Not highly drinkable though, one is more than enough for me. I'm wondering if I got a bad bottle or something, but the label says it's good until 2014. A formidable beer, and certainly a memorable one, but not my favorite. I like more richness and maltiness to my imperial stouts.

The malt kicks in to smooth things out, then there is a nice cocoa bitterness on the finish. Definitely complex and a bit different given the category. Less malty than others like this for sure.  M: Perfectly complex. I like the bitterness, and I also like that it lacks spiciness found in some other bigger stouts. Perfectly complex and perfectly balanced.  D: Very Good.

345,1013,jwhawkins81,2.93,Aroma - Tons of hops with a malt backbone in there some where  Appearance Very dark with a big light brown head. This beer is good looking enough  Taste - Way over hopped for my tastes and maybe for the stout style. I'm a little flavor sensitive to hops and I couldn't get past the hop bitter flavor. So past that I can't talk about roasted malts or any real non-hop flavors  Notes - I put the rest of these in the cellar for at least a year. I suspect a little age will help my outlook but I can only recommend this to a person looking for a very hop forward stout.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

The smell is of coffee with rich roasted malty notes, also fairly hoppy.  The flavor starts out with a surprising amount of hops, as in thr nose though it does start to smooth out with some chocolate and roasted malt notes towards the finish and a very light warming finish from the alcohol.  It has a very nice thick full bodied mouthfeel with a nice amount of carbonation.

S: The first thing I picked up on was valerian root, which I can't exactly say is pleasant. Smell is bitter, with roasted malts and cocoa in there as well.  T: Similar to the smell, there is a hoppy bitterness to this brew not often associated with the style. The bitter herb profile is still up front, and follows the chocolate into the finish.  M: Carbonation is fairly low and this brew is actually quite a bit thinner than it appears.  D: Not a bad beer, but far from what I would call an exemplary representation of the style. The bitter herb profile is too much for me to handle.  Worth a shot, but nothing special really.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Smell - Dark candied fruit, molasses, subtle roasted malt and dark chocolate, and a big hop character.  Taste - Big roasted malt and citrus hop entrance. Molasses/brown sugar sweetness. Leads into a nice bitter (hop/coffee/chocolate) finish that lingers long after the sip has passed. The hops are by far the most prominent aspect of the flavor profile with the roasted malts playing a more subdued role. Dry finish.  Mouth Feel - Medium bodied with an overall smooth feel although not the smoothest imperial stout out there. Carbonation is creamy on the tongue. I would prefer a slightly heavier body.  Drinkability - A nice hoppy imperial stout although I prefer imperial stouts that are a little more full-bodied.

Looks good, real good.  S: Muted chocolate notes and some deep roasted malts. Slight floral sweetness. It's got a good amount of hops in the nose, sets you up for the taste.  T: You can tell this is from the same brewery that created HopDevil. This is one of the most hop-forward imperial stouts. This also a bit of espresso and unsweetened chocolate in finish.  M: Full, quite carbonated, and real warming. Definitely one made for small sips.  D: Like I said before, not quite hot, but there's a definite warmed in each sip. If you take it slow you'll hardly notice the +9% ABV. That in mind, this could be a killer if you tried to make a session of it.

T - Intense coffee flavors, very smokey, some burnt chocolate with a bitter coffee finish like espresso. Taste lingers forever.  M - Decent carbonation, actually makes it feel a lot lighter than I thought it would be, but it's not disappointing at all. Creamy enough. I'd say it's color is deceiving though.

345,1013,vroney,4.52,Just enjoyed a bottle of this beer i got from Bottleworks (in seattle) that was bottled in 2007. I'm a huge fan of stouts and porters but i do not believe I have ever had any that have been aged over a year. I just want to say WOW! It had such complexity that had been blended together so well over the year. I plan on buying a younger bottle of this soon and giving it a full review but i just wanted to say....

The nose is a complex mix of malty base flavors in the form of burnt coffee, chocolate, anise and toffee as well as citrusy, resinous. The taste is equally complex and maybe more so. Lots of upfront malty sweetness of the flavors previously described, transitions to a slight acridness coming from the burnt chocolate/coffee taste and a strong alcohol finish. The hops are present in a citrusy way but seem to be more for balance than anything. The mouthfeel is full bodied and chewy, the carbonation is thick and pillowy. The finish is acrid and dry.

Strong smoky malts, and minimal coffee flavors. Alcohol flavors are not hidden that well.  Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied with a strong alcohol bite.  Drinkability: Another good one from Victory. Good color and good flavor, definitely on the smoky side. Not exceptionally smooth, due to the burnt malts and high alcohol, but very pleasing nonetheless.  Buy Again?

Enjoy by Jan 8, 2015, cause it will be crap on Jan 9?  Appearance: Pours with 2 1/2 fingers of medium tan head. This settles slowly, eventually collapsing to a thin yet complete coating of foam with a raised ring around the edge and an island of foam in the middle of the glass. The beer itself is very dark brown, almost black, and completely opaque. Some sediment in the bottle.  Smell: Amazingly strong smell drifts up as the glass sits on my desk.

As it warms, hints of chocolate covered cherries and other dark fruits appear as well. A lot more hoppiness than I was expecting, which makes this quite an interesting stout.  M: Medium bodied, which is kind of light for a stout, and quite a bit of carbonation, also quite different from a normal Imperial Stout  D: Very drinkable for an imperial stout, I could definitely have a couple of these in one sitting.

345,1013,Kinsman,4.11,"Poured from 12oz bottle into snifter. Best Before Date: 12/31/14  Appearance is blacker than black, and with an aggressive pour gives a thick and creamy tan head. Ample head retention slowly fades to leave a spotty lace around the glass.  Smell hits the nose like a dark coffee roast with more subtle hints of dark chocolate and even a bit of spice. Aroma overall is rather subdued, but slowly opens as the beer warms.  Taste starts off with a bitter chocolate and black coffee flavor, reminiscent of chocolate covered espresso beans. I'm used to my stouts being all malt, but with this one the hops like to greet your palate with a slight spicy herbal note, providing a nice balance to the roasted barley.  Not as chewy or full bodied as some of the other Imperial Stouts out there, but certainly holds it own. Can be a bit rough around the edges, but with age I suspect this will work itself out.  Mmm, one of my favorite dessert beers.  Second Sampling:  Cracked open a second bottle from this batch, now almost a year old. Has seemed to smooth itself out a bit and is quite a bit sweeter, but seems to fit the old review perfectly otherwise.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,SpdKilz,3.98,"New Beer Friday!  Appearance - Poured into my Sam Adams Perfect Pint with an absolute black composition. Held up to the light, none gets through, not even around the edges. Over two fingers of mocha colored head dissipate relatively quickly, however, they leave great looking lacing on the sides of the glass.  Smell - Bitter roasted coffee is at the forefront. After another few whiffs I get a slight hop characteristic, bitter chocolate, and some light booziness.  Taste - Lots and lots of dark roasted malts. Not as bitter as I was expecting it to be, though not as sweet either. Pretty balanced but more so bitter coffee grinds. Additionally, despite my smelling chocolate in the nose, I taste very little of it in the actual drink. Oddly, there is a slight hoppy taste after the initial kick of dark roasted malts. An interesting beer.  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied, honestly lighter than I was expecting. Finishes with a somewhat odd coating of the mouth yet a bit dry?  Drinkability - For the abv, pretty drinkable. I honestly can say I did not taste the alcohol in this. Despite that, I do not see me having more than one of these at any given time. A good beer but just a tad too bitter/hoppy for my liking for a RIS.

There is enough going on here that it is somewhat complex, but is noticeably;y plain in comparison to some other RIS I have had. Still a good RIS.  M - Light to medium body with a little more carbonation than I like in a RIS. The finish is bitter and dry.  D - This is a good RIS, but not a great one.

Has a very hoppy aroma with pine, some grapefruit and mix of earthy aromas. Underneath that is some roasted malt and some charred aromas and little peat.  Very hoppy like the aroma with some resiny pine, earthy and woody flavors. Has an almost acrid burnt/charred flavor with some astringent/medicinal flavors, which went away as the beer warmed up. Some earthy and peat flavors and deep roastiness as it warmed up. Some of the alcohol does come through all these intense flavors. The acrid charred flavors and intense bitterness are a little too much for me. Let this one warm up a little first.  Medium to full body with lots of prickly carbonation. Only slightly warming. A very long dry lingering finish.  The intense hops and acrid charred flavors make this a very challenging beer. Give it a little time to warm up and these flavor subside a little moving towards more deep roasty flavors.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,BigDoug,4.27,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass.  Pours out pitch black with a super nice foamy tan head that falls down to a nice cap on top leaving decent lacing.  The aroma is like POW! Super hoppy! Almost reminds me of their Yakima Twilight. Very hoppy with a slight chocolate malt aroma under all the floral hops.  The taste is like the smell. Big hoppy punch. Light chocolate malt flavor. Not that malty considering the style. So hoppy it almost doesn't even seem like a stout at all.  The Mouthfeel is a bit thin. Not very creamy or chewy. Carbonation is a bit high for the style. Still quite enjoyable. Just a bit thin and prickly feeling from the higher carbonation. A simple swirl around the glass brings the head back up to a big creamy tan head and also makes the mouthfeel a little more creamy. I say, it's a pretty nice mouthfeel but just not very stout-like  The drinkablity is pretty good considering the high ABV. The strong hop flavor is nice and the high alcohol is hidden quite well. Still after about half the glass, I start feeling the burn of alcohol a little in the belly. Very good cold night warmer. But the thing I like about this, is for being a big hophead and not a big stout drinker, it is like a perfect halfway point. This is like a super big hoppy Imperial Stout. Definately hoppy and I'm not talking bitter hops I mean floral aroma of hops coming through the dark malts. It does have a nice bitterness as well but the floral hops definately come through this beer. Like they used some strong high alpha acid finishing hops in this. Kind of weird but surprisingly good.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,xanok,3.08,"Tried this beer once in my early craft beer days and was sort of indifferent on it then. This is my first time having it since. 12oz bottle poured into a stone RIS tulip.  A-Pitch black body. Head is about 2 fingers, very foamy, and tan in color. Good retention. If I don't sip it, the head will be there all day.  S-Coffee and roasted malts. Surprisingly hoppy. Relatively unimpressive.  T-Coffee up front with roasted malts as a close second. Background consists of dark chocolate, piney hops, and some dark fruit. Not necessarily a bad taste, just not bold enough imo.  M-Pretty heavy carb. Body is bordering thin to me. Odd combo. Taste lingers in the mouth a bit.  D-Fairly drinkable. ABV is well hidden. I could drink a few of these, if I actually liked it more.  I don't see the big deal about this beer. I've been exploring more year-round RIS's, and this one falls a bit flat.

M: Creamy, lightly carbonated, very nice.  D: Overall, a damn good and very drinkable RIS. I could definitely have a bunch of these, though at 9% ABV, it could really sneak up on you.

Deep, dark purple/black body with a foaming tanned head, looked good. The head turned turtle and only a thin collar was visable towards the later part of the tasting.  Raisins, un-sweetened dates and prunes seemed to be the smell I got, no hops but dark malty aromas came as the beer warmed in the glass.  Fairly well carbonated, not fizzy, but the fizz is there for all to feel. The actual taste is of burnt/roasted/toasted malts with a hint of alcohol, which considering the ABV shows it is a well balanced beer. The dried grapes and plums (raisins and prunes) found in the smell are also in the flavours, but have swopped places with the malt smells in strength.  Easy to drink, the alcohol does start to appear as the mouth dries, which adds a new dimension to the tasting, one that I enjoyed.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Can taste roasted malts, and a floral hop that really gives this stout a nice kick. Has a coffee/espresso aftertaste. A very, very unique taste and blend of flavors. Only strike against would be the mouthfeel, I prefer a creamy mouthfeel in stouts.  Wow this is a very good brew, Victory loves their hops. This is a brew to savor. The alcohol is masked nicely.

Enough hops to cut through all the roastiness and impart a grassy, piney, herbal character to the nose.  T- I always heard this was a hoppy take on an RIS. All that talk was true. Starts with loads of cocoa powder and black coffee and tons of roasted malts and finishes more hoppy, bitter, citrusy and floral. The prevailing flavors are still of rich dark chocolate and coffee beans.  M- Thinner than I had hoped. There is a lot of carbonation too. Usually I like my big stouts super full and low carbonated for that super creamy effect.  D- A good RIS no doubt.

345,1013,feelmefoam,4.45,"Pours a dark, black coffee color with absolute opacity and no highlights to be seen anywhere. The mocha head, full of rocky bubbles and foam, is only about a finger tall, but lasts a pretty long time. Nice thick rings of lacing cling to the glass as I drink. Very good looking Impy Stout.  The nose has some awesome ingredients in it, but needs a bit more power behind it. Dominated by dark chocolate and toasty malts, a distinct dark fruitiness and floral hoppiness make themselves known as well. A bit of rummy alcohol creeps in towards the end of each whiff as well. The complexity of the nose is nice, the components all work together to come up with a very unique scent, but this could've easily earned a 5 had it been just a bit stronger. Maybe I'm greedy, I don't know.  The flavor is complex as well; a bit of dark chocolate shows up first and is quickly ushered out by a lingering bit of roasty dark malt flavor. After the malts comes the combo of dark fruits and floral hops that give this a distinct bittersweet character, different than if just hops were present. Still, very hoppy for an impy stout, which is NOT a bad thing. A bit of bitter coffee bean and rumminess finish the flavor up. All of these flavors, like the nose, seem to work together with one another, none really beating the others down. Very flavorful.  The mouthfeel is on the thicker side of medium, but not quite as thick as I'd like. There is a slight bit of chalkiness as well, but it's pretty hard to find, I'm probably nitpicking. The carbonation is relatively low but works well with the alcohol to provide a smooth, warming feeling in your mouth, not crisp or hot. If only it was a bit thicker and more syrupy I'd be happy.  Overall, this is a very solid RIS, not the best I've had so far (so far that honor goes to Oaked Yeti) but very good. The complexity and hoppiness of the flavor is very respectable, and my biggest beef is with the mouthfeel, but even that is probably me being a bit greedy.

A huge creamy dark brown head builds and quickly becomes rocky and takes several minutes to fall leaving heavy torn curtains of lacing behind.  The aroma is of deep roasted malts, sweetish dark chocolate with a bright grassy hop scent behind it all.  The flavor has tons of hops but the dark roasted malts are front and center. Bitter dark chocolate reigns here, slightly sweet with fudge and hints of coffee and toffee. There is a bitterness in the mid-taste that lingers into the finish. Warming brings the flavors together nicely and hides the alcohol.  The mouthfeel is full and very chewy, somewhat creamy and medium in carbonation.  Storm King is very drinkable, this bottle is fresh but it is not as raw and hot as some beers of this caliber can be.

345,1013,EtOHMD,3.94,"Had been raining like mad in Boston so when I stopped at the store yesterday, this beer spoke to me.  Poured from a bottle with freshness date of 2015 (!) into pint glass. Deep black with dark brown foamy head with good lacing. Very nice appearance.  Honestly not picking a lot up on the smell.  Hits up front with a bit of warming alcohol then smooths out into nice combination of coffee, chocolate, hint of fruit (? cherries). Excellent taste.  Creamy, warm mouth feel. Nice on a rainy dreary day.  Overall alcohol was well hidden but definitely feeling this one after one beer. Two at most at a sitting.  Overall, an interesting and very good stout.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Flashsp2,4.33,"Storm King Stout, into Stone RIS tulip  Pours extremely dark with a giant, fluffy, medium beige head of mostly tiny-creamy bubbles. The head is so big it took two pours to get it all in the glass. Nice sticky lace down the glass. Some medium brown highlights around the edges.  Aroma is mega-roasted malt and coffee, grapefruit/citric hop, and high percentage cocoa dark chocolate bar.  Taste follows aroma almost entirely. Big roasted malt hit, some heavy roasted coffee, citrus and oily hop bitterness on the finish. A little raw grain/hay thing going on as well, somewhere around the middle.  Mouthfeel is actually on the thin side for the style, especially at 9% or so. The carbonation is what makes the mouthfeel feel thin, it is pretty forceful and breaks up the density of the brew.  Drinkability is moderate, in my opinion. I'm not huge on highly carbonated stouts, but other than the carbonation the flavors have a great balance and the grapefruit/chocolate/coffee combo is surprisingly tasty. The mouthfeel does improve a bit as it warms/rests over the course, and becomes a bit less course and good deal more on the creamy side. I was a bit concerned that I wouldn't like this beer, but it's a very nice change from the IRS that I am accustomed to drinking",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Daniellobo,3.85,"Nice stout, offers a good and slightly fruity standard for an RIS  Presentation: 12 oz capped brown bottle. Crowned eagle head label design. Narrative on the side notes intent, and main ingredients. Shows beer freshness date (Dec 18 2014) and Alc. by Vol (9.1%). Poured into a snifter.  A - Black pour, with an average 1/4"" head, small retention and little lacing.  S - Rather faint, it is there... But alongside a subdued roastness there is a characteristic hoppy, fruity touch. Nice but a bit too shy.  T - Here the brew takes front stage with a nice range of roasted notes, and that lingering fruitiness. Chocolate, coffee and a floral bitter sour melody to it.  M - Full to medium/full mouth, with good carbonation. Crisp finish.  D - Nice RIS, not so much a sipper, it can be enjoyed a tad quicker and works well.  Notes: Another brew I was looking to revisit after it opened a few years back - and alongside others - my curiosity to US craft brewing. Remains good, and rather solid, but it is not one that I would necessarily look for given the average choice. Interesting feel of fruitiness that is very close to the flavors found on their Old Horizontal barleywine.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Its flavor is good: Sweet and roasted notes finish with a nice bitter bite. This is a more subtle Russian imperial stout.  The body is creamy and smooth.

Fragrant fruit aroma arrives afterwards from the hops.  Flavor is intensely roasty. Notes of bitter chocolate predominate with coffee and dirt in the background. Fruit comes forward mid swallow with bitterness from malt and hops on the finish.  Fairly smooth for the weight, I would say the carbonation is about right. I think one bottle would do it for me.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Mix of tiny to huge bubbles and a sweet lace. Pitch black.  Smell - Sweet, caramel with spicy hop aroma coming through as well.  Taste - Licorice and burnt coffee mix together for a pretty powerful blast. The aftertaste stays around forever -- it's hoppy and alcoholic and is dry enough to pucker your mouth. I love the hoppy imperials, and this hop character overpowers all else in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel - Low carbonation and lighter than I expected. A little sticky.  Drinkability - Warms you up for sure. Drinking two in a row would be a stretch for me, but I'm not at all turned off by the aftertaste.

There is something great about the warm tones that bubble up through the inky depths, the intensely clean wealth of flavors. While the hops are huge, they don't overwhelm the balance, and the burnt and roasted malt rises to meet the occasion. Let the IPA apostles learn from this one. Reminds me of a Tawny Port with the improbably alcoholic taste.  There is a fudgy flavor that emerges too. The mellowness of a Sugar Daddy with the bite of a bitter orange.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,jmerloni,4.05,This is great imperial stout. Real balanced and tasty and the high ABV is masked by stellar and solid flavors. Good toffee malts and a nice bitter aftertaste that doesn't kill your tastebuds. The mouthfeel is the best part of this brew and it excels in this area where a lot of imperial stouts are deficient.

345,1013,urwithdave,3.98,"On tap at World of Beer. Poured into a pint glass.  A- Pretty darn black. A inch of a creamy tan head. Serious retention and crazy lacing left on the glass.  S- Dark chocolate, dark fruits, sweetness maybe vanilla? A hint of coffee. A earthy pine smell...hmmm oh yeah, that's def hops.  T- Hops in a stout?? Yup, very much so! A little suprised. Not the typical flavor from a stout, but nevertheless, it's still pretty yummy. However, the malts aren't as prevelent as I would have liked. The alcohol leaves an impression for sure. It's a little hotter then I would expect from a 9 ABV. It's almost like ther's an unbalnced chemical balance.  M- It has almost a syrupy thickness to it. Decent level of carbonation that brings out the hops here.  D- It's just different. Still a good beer that I'll revisit. I don't know if I'd drink more then 2 of em in a row.

Take me 20 pours to get into my pint glass. Frothy, chocolate mountain of a head.  S: Nice citrusy hard hitting hops. It really compares to their Hop Wallop. Bitter roasted chocolate malts in the background. I don't get the usual sweetness like in most RIS's and that is a good thing in a different way. Very much coffee like here.  T: Oh my! Very hoppy. Very bitter. I am another hop head that does not care for it in my RIS but this is really nice. The bitterness is like chewing on a coffee bean. Any chocolate sweetness is out in left field.  M: Creamy and frothy. That head still hasn't died down. Even the bottle took on a head. Probably the thickest RIS ever.  D: A lot of beers this style can be hard to drink sometimes due to overwhelming sweetness or off bitterness. This one is near perfection.  I avoided this one for awhile because review seemed a bit low. The reviews seemed to step up and caught my eye. I see now I have been missing out. Victory has a taken a bold step in a different direction with their RIS. In a sea of many this will stand out as breaking away from the style. Do we really need every RIS to taste like swiss chocolate and cafe mocha?

345,1013,hopsbreath,1.86,"Short and dirty..did not like this. I love Impy stouts and this one disappointed. There was too much hops on the front and bitterness with no point. The malt was in its own right one dimensional. Coffee came through a little bit but was overwhelmingly beat back by bitterness and alcohol. Not pleasant and very hard to drink. Of all the Stouts I have had this was my least favorite. I tried to give it a chance, but after choking down four of these in an attempt to better appreciate it, I gave the final 2 away to a friend of mine who is a macro drinker because he will drink anything to catch a buzz. Not only will I not seek out again, I will advise against trying it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,willPS21,2.95,"A solid beer. I'm not going into too much detail beyond that. I did find some more muddled and unrefined metallic notes that weren't desirable. The flavor definition was poor compared to others. The stout category simply has some really fine names in it, so this was towards the bottom of what I've tasted for imperial stouts. Makes me feel like I was too hard on the Ten Fidy. A while back I had the pils from victory which I really enjoyed, so this was a bit of a disappointment, for that and because the rating is high (A- very respectable to me). I'm just doing my part in smoothing the bell curve to bring it down to what I consider its rightful position in the B/B+ area.. yes 87% from me. Something about that A- caused me to expect more, a 92% perhaps, and therefore led to my disappointment.

After a quick whiff, smells very caramelly, and also of coffee. Absolutely beautiful scent. After the first taste, very strong...you get used to it after awhile, and can enjoy the tastes of very dark chocolate, caramel, and coffee. Very light in the mouth, doesn't feel heavy at all. It has a pretty high ABV however, so you won't be able to put back more than a couple in a night.

Mixed in the back I can taste malts, oak, and very faint chocolate. Would be better if the flavors balanced better.  M: Thick and very syrupy. Medium - high carbonation. Not bad.  D: Would go down easier if the flavors were better balanced. Good, but not great.  All in all, if you love hops and want a hoppy stout, this is your holy grail.

345,1013,NewGeneric,4.05,"100th review. Hadn't reviewed in a while but got inspired. Thanks to tweidman420 for the generosity. Bottle stamped: Enjoy by 1/23/14 Poured into my Delirium tremens tulip.  A: Pours pitch black. Absolutely no light penetrates. Anywhere. In fact, this beer allowed my glass to reflect everything as clearly as a mirror. Beautiful, thick, dense foam with bubbles so tiny you can barely even notice them. Almost like yeast cake. There is considerable, sticky lacing all over the glass except in the area where the top layer of foam is desperately clinging for dear life to the top of the glass. That area is simply caked with lacing. It just will not let go! Magnificent.  S: Wow, this is the part that really inspired me to write this review. I noticed it before I even poured. Beautiful mix of fresh piney hops, roasted malt, caramel, sweet mint, and hints of fruit, spices, chocolate, and coffee. Not exactly what I expect from a stout, but beautiful nonetheless.  T: Taste is a minor letdown, but it does come through rather nice in the finish. Up front I get a lot of that hops, sweet mint, and fruitiness, with a big bold roasted finish. I'm also finding just ever so slight a hint of coffee. Actually reminds me a little bit of Nogne #100, but a little more subtle.  M: Pretty nice given the amount of hops I'm noticing. A little bitterness up front, but really settles down almost immediately. After that, it's smooth sailing with the carbonation hitting just a touch more than necessary. Relatively dry, but not overly so. Finishes almost like an IPA/DIPA. Wouldn't mind a little less bitterness.  D: This is a tough call. I'm enjoying this beer, but I'd be hard pressed to give it high marks here. While the abv is hardly noticeable on the palate, the hops definitely are, and with each sip it becomes more noticeable. And simply put, while this is a good beer, it's not what I look for in a stout. I could probably drink another one if I had one, but no more than that.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

T- The taste on this is pretty well layered. starts of with a traditional coffe and chocolate roasted maltiness, then followed by a quick hint of some dark fruits, and finishes with an unusualy amount of that earthy/piny bitterness for a stout.

T - the taste is extreemly similar to the smell. Basically coffee with a hoppy bitterness. Now stouts usually don't have this high of hoppyness but it it mighty tasty.  M - full bodied. Medium carb.

M - Great mouthfeel with a full creamy body, and a little oily across the tongue.  T - This is my favorite part of the Storm King. Starts out with loads of dark roasted malts, with some caramel coming through, then the taste swirls into a nice, strong bitter hop finish with some earthy tones like pine resin and even some tree bark flavors and dark chocolate.

345,1013,footy802,4.2,"A - Poured midnight black with the facade of a nitrogen cascade. There was a browned toast colored head three fingers in height with a long duration, and light frothy appearance.  S - It has all the workings of a stout but with a more aggressive hop aroma. This is well balanced with the rich roasted malt fragrance that makes for hearty stouts.  T - Somewhat complex, with a few distinct profiles. The Intro is a rich almost sweet malty taste that that surrenders to a well balanced hoppy tang and then back to a malty black coffee-like finish as the slight bitterness subsides. The intensity of the hops really adds an important dimension to this imperial stout offering.  M - Not your typical creamy or heavy stout instead it has a slightly lighter feel, i.e. not a meal in a bottle. The most impressive quality is the persistent carbonation; at no point was it still. The best way for me to describe the beer in terms of genetics would be a stout that got it on with an IPA.  D - This is a stout for the hop lovers. The beer has no harsh taste, just a hoppy nuance that adds to the drinkability and complexity. It has an ABV of 9.1% which was honestly surprising to find. This is a versatile offering because it has a hybrid, or nontraditional stout taste.  Very impressed with this beer, I've been drinking some imperials recently in preparation for ""Kate the Great,"" and this was a standout in my personal opinion.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,jeffthecheff,4.2,"Best by Oct. 2014.  Storm King is pitch black, with a dark brown head that has a fluffy consistency at first but then dies down to a thin lace around the glass.  The aroma is nicely hopped with a citrus and pine character. The dark character comes in next with the smell of a charred cooking surface, espresso coffee, and dark herbal notes. You can tell now that this is going to be a raw, rugged, and rough beer.  The taste is bitter from the hops with a strong finish that includes pine and fruits. There is also an extremley burnt roast character with some astringency. This makes me imagine eating the ashes of burnt American hops. It has a rough character all around, but I like it. Anyone who likes coffee would like this beer, whether they drink beer or not.  The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with a medium carbonation. The finish is towards the dry side with a mouth coating, roasty astringency. I had this beer with an incredible brisket sandwich from B.T's Smokehouse. The charred meat flavor matched up well, but I think this would do better with a chocolate dessert.

Some yeast notes, some light roasted barley and chocolate. Midstream shows the light amount of hops. FInishes with an extremely bitter, almost acidic bite with only a hair of bittersweet chocolate. Strong aftertaste of burnt flavors.  M - Thick and strong bodied. Carbonation is also well conveyed in the mouthfeel, leaving a sting to the tongue. Bitter oily texture hangs around long after finishing the drink.  D - Moderate drinkability. RIS is manageable but high for the style. A bit filling due to its carbonation.

No light makes it through the blackness, yet the head and the collar it leaves behind are surprisingly milky light.  S- Nothing too intense, but a faint coffee roast floats in on top of a subtle undertow of fruity hops. You really have to search to find a hint of the alcohol that tells you that this stout is imperial.  T- The floral side of the hops hit you up front, not at all unpleasantly, and the bitters get you in the end. In between, the coffee roasts and malts take you for nice little spin. Again, the 9.1% abv does a clever job of hiding behind the flavors. Overall, one of the hoppier stouts I've had, which is the farthest thing from a complaint that I could lodge.  M- Not as thick or heavy as some of its contemporaries, the refreshing lightness of texture mixes with a pleasant fizz.  D- This is a beer you can really have a nice night with. You can put a few of these down before you switch to something lighter. I get the feeling that this is one imperial stout that you could actually spend some time with during the hotter months.

Nice depth.  M - Plenty of effervescence. Medium/heavy. Oils. Substantial texture.  D - Expertly crafted brew. This beer is a stout drinker's stout.

Hops come on pretty strong on the back end, with a bitter black coffee effect on the aftertaste. Chewy texture, lighter carbonation appropriate to the style.  Alcohol is pretty noticeable, but pretty good drinkability for the style. I think that if I hit the entire six pack I'd be pretty well hammered.  Did not go very will with a pizza with a slightly sweet sauce. I'd pair it with mole and mildly spicy food or grilled meat with a spice rub.

345,1013,mempath,4.5,"wanted to have this during Blizzard #2, but figured that would simply devastate...so, the day after and alot of shoveling, settling in to this monstrosity.  pours nearly black, monstrous head that rises way too fast and curdles over...a slight red tinge refracting from the bottom of the glass. splotchy lacing. really nice.  smell isn't being too forward, but something here smells unique. can't figure it out. it's like an oddly herbal/mint sense. strange. another swirl and the nose deep down, i get some toasty/roastiness. interesting. might have to try it again on another day and see if it comes out the same.  taste: ok, maybe that smell is indicating some grassy, oily hoppiness in an imperial stout. not what i expected, but if that's what it is, i like it. creamy chewy but not 'thick' or cloying. rather clean for all that's going on, yet not dry. quite drinkable for palates that can handle it. quite recommended and another victory for Victory. nearly exceptional on all counts.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Chico1985,4.6,"Ah, Storm King. My first stout ever, led me down the path of my love for Russian Imperial Stouts. Pours as black as..well..a storm, great fluffy tan head. The smell is so great - strong espresso, chocolate and dark fruit. Taste is amazing, incredible coffee taste, dark chocolate, dark cherry, generous amount of hops. Seems to have a big roasty coffee profile. Mouthfeel is good but I prefer a little more thickness. One of the most drinkable RIS's, maybe even sessionable. Alcohol shows through a bit in the finish but other than that it's very hidden. Maybe nostalgia is playing a role here, but I love this beer. Underrated in the tough competition of this style.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,oceanman,4.35,"Enjoy by date is completely illegible, but this beer tastes fairly young - one year or less.  Hop aromas really dominate atop more typical chocolatey notes. The beer gives off a spicy sense of heat, which merges nicely into an espresso-type aroma.  There is a big hop-bitterness here, without detracting from the smoothness of the beer at all. Some of the fruitier hop characteristics also interact with the bold stout flavors in interesting ways. Starts like chocolate, then the fruit comes in, and finishes bitterly like espresso.  This tastes kind of like someone poured a dash of Arrogant Bastard in my Expedition Stout. Works for me.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

345,1013,DawnL,4.03,"Jet black - no light could penetrate this brew. The head was tan with great lacing.  There was definitely a lot of coffee and piney hops on the nose.  The flavor was of deep coffee. There was a resinous quality to the brew. A little pine came through on the finish.  This was definitely viscous. It was a pleasure to drink this beer. It was almost chewy. There was substance here that came through with every sip.  I was surprised that the beer was as drinkable as I found it. It went pretty well with the cheese plate I was having. The cheddar paired really nicely - the blue cheese not so well, and the Delice de Bourgogne got lost in the hops.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,cbutova,4.33,"I know I like aged Storm King more than fresh stuff. Got this bottle in July so the bottle is somewhere between 5-7 months old I'm assuming. The last bottle I had at 6 months was great. Beer starts out great with a very nice pitch black pour and a nice tan head between two and three fingers. The retention is very good and the beer leaves behind a very thick coat of lacing as the head dies down. The head was creamy and a nice cloud is left on top of the opaque beer. This is the looks any stout should be aiming for. Smell has a ton of roasted malts right up front. Cocoa is also picked up from the malts along with some earthy hops. The nose has good strength and a decent balance. The taste is different from the nose. The hugely roasty malt backbone is still in tact and is almost smoky. There are some cocoa notes from the malt. The hops are much bigger in the taste than the nose. A good amount of flavor and bitterness comes from the hops. They are mostly earthy but a tiny bit of pine seems to be present. Even after around half a year the hops are still a bit harsh for me, the bitterness lingers and is strong after the beer is swallowed. The best thing that comes with age in this beer is the loss of the harsh alcohol. Any fresh Storm King I have had has been very aggressive in hops and alcohol. I would say this would be perfect after about a year. Right now it is an excellent roast malt flavor with a bit too much hops (they feel unbalanced). Mouthfeel is nice. The beer has a thick body, nice creaminess and goes down very smoothly. It leaves behind a roasty cocoa and hoppy aftertaste on the tongue. The carbonation is moderate and suits the thickness and flavors well. A bit less bitterness would be nice and is the only thing keeping this from a perfect MF. Drinkability is nice for an imperial stout. The 9%ABV is hidden dangerously well. The price is very, very good. The taste and quality is great and is worth the money. The only thing keeping this from being highly sessionable is the harsh hops. I would still consider this one of the only sessionable imperial stouts. Hooray for cheap imperial stouts and hooray for a beer that ages very well. Very nice roast malt backbone also.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,cdpike,4.65,"Pours jet black with modest, dissipating off-white foam and a bit of lace. Nose is slight ale fruitiness with a good amount of espresso backed by alcohol. Fairly full-bodied and ultra smooth, there is a TON of flavor that leaps out immediately with this brew. Plenty of espresso is backed by very dark chocolate with a very faint fruity complexity. Again, quite smooth and a bit slick, there's an astringency and lingering bitterness that balances all the big malts. This is definitely one of my favorite beers regardless of style. Excellent!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,BatDaddy,3.39,"A - Pours a dark solid black with a strong brown head. Lots of lacing and head retention.  S - Smell is a bit faint. Some citrusy hops and faint roasted malts.  T - Taste is a bit rough. Burnt roasted coffee and some bitter citrus hops. Seems like it could be better balanced. Strong, but almost harsh.  M - Mouthfeel is nice. Smooth, full-bodied, and creamy.  D - High abv paired with some unbalanced flavors probably means I won't be having too many more of these.  Notes - A decent beer for a cold winter's night, but there's probably better ones out there. Just seems a bit off.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Naugled,2.8,"Pours with a nice dark brown thick head and an opaque black body. Chunks of sediment came from the bottom of the bottle.  Smell is a bit vegetal up front sweet and hoppy second.  Flavor is very bitter and harsh, way too much, either a bad bottle or it needs to age and mellow, there was no date on the bottle to know for sure. It's hard to get a good malt profile because the hop bitterness is so dominating.  Mouthfeel isn't bad but long aftertaste.  Not a very drinkable beer at this point. I may buy another and let it age. I'll update the review afterwards. But as is, not a good example of an imperial stout IMO.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,afausser,4.15,"A: Pours an opaque dark leathery brown with about a finger of head into a 22 oz snifter. The head looks like it belongs to a latte both in color and consistency, and has very nice retention. There is little to no motion evident unless the brew is held up to the light, revealing some tiny carbonation bubbles moving towards the foamy, creamy head. A very fine sheet of lacing almost instantly turns into a much spottier pattern.  S: Smells very metallic, with coffee and dark chocolate notes, as well as dominant earth and smoke. There's also some subtle fruit notes that aren't completely swallowed by the heavier flavors--they come across as strawberries while the beer is still cold, and sweet raisins as it warms (though this is quite different from the dark raisiny scent in many beers). A couple sweet, syrupy notes and anise as it warms. Additionally, the metallic taste becomes more minty as it warms, which is nice.  T: The taste, again, is very heavy in metal, oak, leather, and earth notes, as well as some hoppy pine. There is a bit of coffee present, but even more than that I'm tasting a bit of molasses and caramel, which provides a nice counterpoint to the more abrasive tastes. Malty, but definitely burnt malts. The aftertaste is quite metallic and bitter, and hoppy as it warms. Fresh and minty. As it warms, there are raspberry notes. The more it warms, the more extreme the hops become, and the aftertaste becomes more and more like a broiled grapefruit with brown sugar. Very nice.  M: Quite warm in the mouth, though not abrasively so. It's really, in fact, quite warming and pleasant and goes down more like a 6 or 7 percent than a 9.1%. Smooth and creamy, if a little metallic in the aftertaste. The very fine carbonation bubbles are done, well, perfectly, and lift the flavors up to your mouth while at the same time not popping too much and ruining the feel for the style. The only thing I can complain about, aside from the aftertaste (which I find to be a little much, personally) is that it's a bit foamy. But other than that, it's just so smooth and velvety that it's easy to give it a high rating.  D: quite drinkable for the abv, and exceeded my expectations and first impressions as it warmed. It's one to sip and drink slowly, but the drinkability is certainly impressive for the style and ABV.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,MOB210SA,4.1,"Enjoy by: Dec 18 2014  Bubble 1 finger quickly fizziling quickly away molasses/tan head. A menacing almost completly black darkness-only a small dark brown/reddish rim is visible when held to light. The head died fairly fast to a modest ring. Maybe not much head and lacing but I like the looks of this beast.  Lots of coffee and burnt maltiness. Not so much on the usual chocolate as coffee in this one. Smells rich and has a hard alcohol kick that comes through. Warming me as I drink.  Mostly a coffee/expresso domination, with lots of roasted maltiness and a lively hop taste and bite. This is a rich, flavorful and certainly enjoyable. Not the best RIS but its a keeper.  Relatively low carbonation, but has a nice low bubbliness to it. Full bodied and rich. super smooth and a little too drinkable.

There is a lot of hop aroma of pine, which follows with nice, roasted malts - mostly chocolate and coffee. The flavor is hop dominant as well, again mostly pine notes. The malts take a back seat, but comprise dark chocolate notes and some bitter coffee. The hops fade in the finish, leaving nice dark chocolate flavor with a slight bitterness.  The strong hop profile, roasted malt, and high ABV create a very full bodied beer. A lot hoppier than I woud have preferred, but that makes me anxious to see what this does with a year or more of aging.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Head retention was about average and ther ewas a light amount of lacing at the top but not all the way down.  Smell is chocolate and heavily roasted malt. There is a heavy hoppy kick to it as well, making it fruity with a scent of currant.  This is one hoppy stout. Dark roast up front. My favorite is the finish, which is juicy raspberries and chocolate.  Mouthfeel is good, but just a tad thin to me. Finish is bitter and sweet.  The abv is mitigated well and this has very rich flavor. For a big stout, this drinks pretty light.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Definitely doesn't feel well-balanced as far as the traditional style; however, I recognize the intent behind the hoppier notes in the beer.

Nice head retention. There's no light getting through here, pitch black. Deep and malty looking.  S: Huge roasty, bitter chocolate smell. Coffee is huge, so much going on here. The hops are super present for an RIS, nice touch. Sweet vanilla and oak are also present here. This is one RIS where I can smell the hops and expect the hops on the palate.  T: Hops don't necessarily hit first, but boy do they hit hard for an RIS. Nice luscious chocolate taste precedes, but the bitterness soon follows. Very well balanced hop/malt profile, although I wasn't expecting so much hops on the tongue. Still stays very robust and roasty, with a Victory hop ideal. Absolutely delicious, and I'm sure this will fare well in the cellar.  M: Smooth, thick and velvety. Carbonation is well muted, yet still very present. Great stout mouthfeel.  D: I've heard some say this is undrinkable fresh, some beg to differ. I believe it is fantastic fresh and aged, two completely different beers. Huge and boozy, not a beer to keep grabbing another of.

Head is a nice burnt umber and a fat one finger, admirable for an imperial stout. Lacing is noticeable but not heavy.  Smells of piny hops, malt, dark chocolate, coffee, citrusy hops and a note of the high ABV.  Flavors are sweet, tangy, piny hops, bitter chocolate, and coffee. Afteratstes include anise and leather.  Full body, chewy even with ample carbonation and a dry, though lingering finish.  Drinkability is quite good.  I liked this beer.

Feels silky smooth in the mouth with a nice tight carbonation.  Tastes intially of coffee and roasted grain...some nice bright citrusy hops in the middle...and finishing with a bitterness that remains on seemingly forever.

A huge, two-finger plume of glossy mocha head forms and lasts very well while slowly settling to a tight, half-finger cap of foam. Nice lacing.  S - Grassy hops, with suggestions of burnt malt, coffee, and bitter chocolate.  T - Strong grassy hops up front, then a touch of roasted malt. A dry, harshly bitter, hoppy finish with a hint of coffee and alcohol astringency. Too harsh, and sorely lacks a roasty malt balance.  M - The beer is only medium-bodied and carbonation is a little too high for the style, causing the beer to lack the rich, velvety nature of a RIS. Warming alcohol reminds you of the ABV.  D - Much like how you can't judge a book by its cover, you can't judge a beer solely by its appearance. The flavor of this brew is too unbalanced for the style - it's almost like drinking a dark IIPA.

M:Feels light for a RIS, lightly carbonated  D:Very smooth and drinkable for the ABV and much lighter and less filling than other stouts.  I would recommend this to fans of Guiness as a good upgrade, with a few similar characteristics.  Coffee lovers may also find reason to like this beer.  On account of it's high drinkability and light composition in comparison to other stouts this may be a good entry level stout but the grassy bitterness may deter some that are not accustomed.  As a matter of personal taste it wasn't entirely what I was looking for in an RIS but I enjoyed it none the less and may have found a good choice for a stout that I can throw back on social occasions (Beware the ABV don't let the smoothness fool you).",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

The first thing you get is obviously a huge hop prescense, but behind it are some nice and mellow notes of roasted malts along with a fudgy maltiness with a small sling of chocolate at the edges. A nice combination, but it gets a little sickish in the long run.  Taste starts off brutally with lots of sweet grassy and resiny hops, but seamlessly over into an almost as huge, but not as sweet, roasted malt-onslaught, with dark bitter chocolate and fudge and a hint of liqourice.

T: Lots of bitter, unsweetened chocolate with a malty and hoppy background. I was expecting a sweeter profile, but this is pretty good anyhow. Just not exactly what I expected.  M: Highly carbonated and dry with a slight prickly finish, probably due to the high ABV.  D: I could drink a few of these, but after three I'd probably look to drink something else.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,beerwolf77,4,"On tap at Romans. Poured into my pint glass the beer is pitch black with a small one finger chocolate colored head. Moderate lace rings are left after settling.  The aroma is rather hoppy. Once past the hops you get chocolate, coffee, molasses, dates, figs and maybe a touch of dark fruit.  The flavor is very hoppy. more hops then I'm used to in a RIS. A decent amount of chocolate and coffee. There's a flavor in here that I just can't discern. It's not bad but it's something I've never tasted in a RIS.  Medium to full body. Almost no carbonation if any. Lightly chewy.  Overall a decent RIS.

S= huge roasted-roasted malts with bold hops florals, some fruit and citrus plus occasional brandy-esque alcohol whiffs.  T= bold dark-dark dry roasted malts, great bold hops florals, occasional toffee hints on the sides of the tongue, sometimes some sour brandy alcohol hints and some nutty-ness.  M= very chalky dry, with light sweet toffee syrup effect, dry enough to make my lips stick together but not astringent.  D= drinkable for maybe a few but it's so bold and also high in ABV% that I couldn't tolerate much more at one sitting. Definitely worth having one or more, though.

Color was almost pitch black and opaque, good two finger head that lasted a while leaving lacy rings on glass. My taste buds may have been killed by 30 years of smoking so I can't tell if it was chocolaty or malty but it was good. After having one I could feel the buzz, will not drive for a while.

Color is an opaque dark brown to almost black. Aroma is interesting; malty, roasty, good hop, yeast, old cheese, dark ripe fruit,& burnt sugar. Flavor's much the same except I really pick up the alcohol, mmm maybe more in the warmth than the flavor. Body is there, but not too heavy and certainly not light.

Comes off a bit plastic-y, but I think it's the roasted / leafy combination... other RISs and black IPAs do that combination better though. Taste: hop forward... grassy, leafy, lemon rind... that seems to be the Victory hop profile no matter what the style is... milk and baker's chocolate, slightly astringent roasted character. Soft carbonation, astringent finish. This really comes off more like a black IPA than an RIS... maybe aging will change that. I did enjoy this one and I'll probably pick up more, but it doesn't seem to fit the style well at alll.

345,1013,wheatyweiss,3.9,"Poured from a bottle into a goblet.  Pours midnight black with a cocoa colored one finger head that recedes by half. Head looks rich and creamy.  Aroma opens with dark roasted grain, chocolate and charred meat. Middle brings dark sweet fruit, caramel and molasses. Tail end of smell is creamy and slightly vanilla.  Flavor is dark roasted grain to open. Grain is coffee and caramelized sugar, molasses and burnt smokiness. Creamy and doughy breadiness. Middle is hop, straight hop. Hops are not prominent enough to pick out the type, but the bitterness comes out of no where. Finishes bitter and clean despite the sweet aroma. Surprising, to say the least. Booziness is very muted for the abv.  Mouthfeel is crisper and thinner than the appearance. Carbonation is soft and lush and the booze comes through at the swallow, warming slightly.  Pretty damn good, and not overly sweet for a RIS.

S - Hops is strong in this one along side of some coffee, chocolate, and fruit nodes. T - Coffee and dark chocolate blend to a bit of heavy roast which is then taken away by a bitterness from the hops. Finishes rather dry. M - Dry yet alcohol is well masked. Still one of the more hop forward RIS's I ever had D - I would like to try this with some age but I don't believe this is the best rep of the style. More body and less hops.

Tiny and clumpy bits of lacing that remain fade quickly as well.  S- Whiffs of fermented grapes up front, hints of leather and earthy grassy hops.  T- Alot going on, namely sweet grape jelly and brown-sugar muffin up front crashing head-on into tea-like hop bitterness and earthy roots in the mid-to-finish.  M- This was the nail in this beer's coffin for me. Weak carbonation and a thin mouthfeel. Tannic and astrngent, literally leaving the palate nearly bone-dry on the finish.  D- Flavors abound, but clash with eachother more than complement. Was done after the 12 oz for sure.

I actually had to drain pour most of it because it just wasn't hitting the spot. The hops are way too overpowering in this stout. Don't get me wrong, I love some great bitetr hops in a stout, but not the fruity strong citrus kind... this stout to me is much more like a black IPA. Bitterness was great, but not the fruity and earthy notes... the malt backing was just kind of blah too and not very much depth.  - Carbonation was great, and somewhat medium bodied... little chewy and sticky.  - Overall this wasn't drinkable for me... the hops sometimes put off a 'B.O.-like"" aroma and taste... and was just too fruity and citrusy....

Notes of citric hops, big eathy nose, some mustiness and a softened roasted grain. Nothing special going on here, and certainly not when compared to the rest of the beer's characteristics.  T - Deep dark roasted malts and grain with hop bitterness. Fairly complex and difficult to describe in the background, but I taste traces of unsweetened taffy and chocolate-covered-caramel as well as some licorice, toasted nuts (pecan and chestnut), and just a hint of spice.

First you're hit with a burst of hops, which I didn't expect with over a year on the beer. Then roasty notes appear with interesting lighter undertones. I don't know how to describe them, but they are dry notes.  M - I would put this at a medium-full body and medium carbonation. This is a beer that lends itself to be heavily carbed, so I would like a little more.  D - Oh Storm King how you are overlooked.

Taste hits all the same notes - rich burnt/roasted malt, a hint of hops, the typical coffee/chocolate notes and booze. Full bodied and moderate carbonation. This thing definitely sits in your gut. Very enjoyable, but didn't really seperate itself from the stout pack, in my opinion. I don't have any negative marks against it really - it just didn't necessarily stand out as special.

345,1013,corby112,4.65,"Sampled at Resurrection Ale House on 12/04/2009. I've had this beer many times in bottles but this was the first time I've sampled it on cask.  Pours pitch black and completely opaque with very faint mahogany edges and a one finger foamy chocolate brown head that slowly settles into a lasting cap which leaves streaks of lacing behind.  Roasted chocolate malt aroma with a surprisingly prominent hop presence as well as some roasted coffee bean, bitter sweet dark chocolate, booze, caramel, toffee and more chocolate.  Silky chocolate malty body that again is surprisingly hop forward. Much more so than in the bottled version. Very smooth and well balanced with a lot of silky malt flavor and subtle roastiness. Hints of caramel, toffee and subtle roasted coffee bean accompany the luscious lactic creamy darrk chocolate flavor and the subtle hops up front provide a nice balance without providing too much bitterness. A lot of Imperial Stouts I've had lately have been way too aggressively hopped taking away from the creamy sweet maltiness that I like so much but this one is balanced perfectly. The cask conditioning gives this body an incredible quaffale smoothness that takes the roughness off of the bottled version. Dangerously drinkable with an almost undetectable high ABV. I had to slow myself down because I was drinking it entirely too fast. Highly recommended in any version but especially if you have the chance to sample it on cask.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Taste= Burned maltinesss overpowered by the hops with lingering for minutes after wards, WOW!! Some hints of chocolate and coffee-like flavors. Very nice.  Body=Medium to full-bodied, with minimal carbonation. The subdued, minimized carbonation really helps, as too much carbonation would kill the flavor. Unlike other Victory beers, they actually kept the carbonation level low here.  Outstanding!!!

S - The Aroma isn't too powerful or anything. Hints of dark chocolate and coffee. After awhile there came through sort of a sweet, dark fruity aroma. Something like cherries or black raspberries maybe. Sort of reminded me of a fortified wine.  T - Quite a few flavors seem to come through. Dark chocolate, roasted coffe, and some hop kick to it. Tastes rather bitter long after swallowing, and is a little dry. Could have maybe used a little something to balance out the bitter dark chocolate.  M - Fairly nice.

345,1013,hreb,3.65,"Cold 12 oz bottle poured into tapered pint glass. Beer pours black with a gigantic brown head which slowly falls, leaving thick tan lacing behind. Aroma of hazelnuts, coffee, and burnt caramel.  Tasting the beer yields a much cruder beast: alcohol and spice. The mouthfeel is finely carbonated and crisp, not creamy. A rush of citrusy hops at the end.  The bottom line is that this is a truly divisive beer. There are those of us who believe the complexity of a strong stout comes from layers and layers of barley, with hops added only to balance out any unwanted sweetness. Others believe that any high-alcohol beer can stand up to a heavy dose of wet hopping, reaching a balance, if at a precarious height. This beer is brewed for those in the latter camp; I'm in the former.  Don't get me wrong: I think this is a very good beer in some respects, but it's quality presents itself entirely upfront: it's beautiful, the smell is rich. Inhaling through the mouth brings in wonderful, roasty vapors. And, as it warms, more coffee and chocolate come out in the middle. But its IBU assault and high alcohol really limit its enjoyment.

345,1013,donteatpoop,4.17,"Really dark in color, unable to see through the brew at all; a nice foam of a dark brown accumulated at the top and quickly receeded until only a ring of lacing clung to the side of the glass.  Smells of roasted malt and dates/raisins, yeasty fruity notes and some floral hops.  The taste is strong, very impactful; first you are hit with the roasted malts and the dry hop, but soon a raisin and coffee bean combination dominate the palate, the coffee taste lingering upon swaallowing.  Mouthfeel is pleasant, a thick and creamy beer that goes down easy. Excellent imperial stout, I'll be drinking this one again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,dbtoe,4.2,This is one great stout. I am very impressed. I couldn't sip this beer it was gone way to quick and I could get in real trouble if I had a lot of these around because I'd drink them. Look is very dark and the head is nice and thick and about a half a finger stuck around until the end. Smell is roast and flowery hops. Taste is amazingly smooth with a complex balance of roasted malts and flowery hops. Feel a medium body with perfect carbonation. Rich and creamy Drink Wow this is drinkable. Even with the high ABV the beer just begs to be drank and open another and drink that one too.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,bound4er,4.01,"My first Victory beer.  A - Very dark brown to black appearance. Big, fluffy 3 finger head upon pouring that settles to a half finger. Leaves tons of lacing.  S - Somewhat muted - mostly roasted grain, faint coffee and a floral character from the hops.  T - There is nothing sweet about this RIS - a good dose of roasted grain is quickly followed by a nice hit of hops. Not a beer for the faint of heart but I like it. Quite different tasting from others in its class.  M - Medium bodied - on the lighter side for a RIS.  D - I find this highly drinkable. It isn't heavy or plodding on the palate and the hop profile really cleans up the back-end nicely - inviting you in for another sip. If it weren't for the 9% ABV, this would be pretty easy to session. As it is, one or two in a night is enough for me. Time to pick up another 6-pack and keep a few around for aging.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,magnj,3.88,"A - Very dark and viscous pour. Little color to be found even when help up to bright light. Brown head forms from an aggressive pour but falls quickly leaving only a little bit of lacing behind.  S - Roasted grains dominate. Fruity yeast character present. Hops are hard to pick out if they are there. Reminds me a bit of old coffee grinds and fresh cocoa nibs bit those are both subtle, otherwise roasty would sum it up.  T - Big dark burnt roasted grains. Somewhat stale even though this is a fresh sample. Hides alcohol well, goes down easy but not for the weak. This is a full fledged RIS and would be a shock to the untrained palate.  M/D - Thin body, not uncommon for the style. Easy to drink but rough on the head, the 9.1% catches up fast. I like it but really bought it to cellar and look forward to how it progresses.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Nearly black, with a 3 finger light tan, bubbly head the settles to a finger then a ring that leaves scattered lacing. Smell of roasted malts, bittersweat chocolate and coffee, nicely complimented by flowery hops, also a little bit of cinnamon raisin in the backgrounf. Tastes as complex as it smels. The hops come through more peppery. The alcohol is complimented nicely by the bitternes an sweet mocha flavors. Thick and creamy to the mouth and leaves a little burning after taste.

345,1013,TheJollyHop,4.28,"A thoroughly impressive beer:  Black with a strong head formation that releases scents of roasted malt and dark chocolate.  Has a roasty character amidst the flavors of dried fruit, coffee, and molasses. There is a quick hit of bitterness followed by a sweet aftertaste. ABV is hidden very well. Nicely balanced. Body is chewy and is mouth coating.  Exactly what I wanted out of a RIS. Nice malt character with just the perfect amount of bitterness. Very drinkable for the style and definitely a beer to savor again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,sweemzander,4.48,"12oz. bottle poured into a snifter. Enjoy by Jan. 30, 2014.  (A)- Pours dark and pitch black. Produces a large 3+finger tan fluffy to bubbly head that has great retention; is sticking around at about a 1-finger size. It is also stuck to the sides of the glass in thin, tiny webbings.  (S)- Roasted dark chocolate with potent raisin and nutmeg bread. Has an allspice/cinnamon nuance behind the breadiness.  (T)- Seriously rich dark cocoa with a roasted raisin and molasses. Bits of coffee and cinnamon bread in the background. Comes and goes in richness, bitterness, and sweetness as it warmed up.  (M)- Very rich with a good potency and carbonation level. Complex within its classic RIS characteristics. Rather smooth actually even with how rich it is. Great abv integration.  (D)- A fantastic RIS that I feel is always overlooked by some of the more popular brands out there. I always look forward to having this again and again. It must be able to age for forever: Best by 2014?! Has great balance and complexity to it. Surprising drinkability in a style that isnt usually great in that regard.

Its hard to tell when the hops stops and the bitter chocolate takes over, but its really nice. Long finish.  Mouthfeel: Very big and creamy. Goes down very smooth.  Drinkabililty: A very different kind of RIS with all the upfront hops smell and flavor. Its really good and different, but not necessarily what I want when I'm in the mood for an RIS.

345,1013,ricke,3.98,"A: Almost black with a thick pale brown head that settles into a nice lid of lacings. Looks good.  S: A very hoppy smell. The peppery and citric hops almost overpower the plentiful aromas of roasted malts in this one. Notes of chocolate. Hoppy imperial stouts are always impressive, but underneath the hops and roasted malts, I don't find much of anything in this one, and therefore it gets somewhat boring after a while.  T: The taste is really good. I have a thing for the combination of roasted malts and powerful hops it it's made in a good way, as it is here. Of course, you have the usual suspects of roasted malts, coffee and chocolate. But they are almost muted by the fresh citric and peppery hops in this one. Nice notes of hop resins. There's a lot of sweetness going on, and the citric hops actually add to this. The finish is very bitter with some sweetness and lots of hops. Hints of anise and powdered chocolate. No sign of the alcohol.  M: Rather light body but still in the full body range. Medium carbonation. Quite a boring texture. This part of the beer is somewhat of a letdown.  D: A tasty beer. Lots of big hoppy flavors. But unfortunately, the hoppy character also makes the beer slightly unbalanced and one-dimensional. I actually think the hops take over to much after a while. But either way, overall it's good.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Roasted malts with the bitterness of piney hops and a warming sensation from the alcohol, but nothing is overpowering.  M- Sits on the tongue with a smooth mouthfeel.

345,1013,GitcheGumee,3.93,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. This is the first time I've tried this beer. I also don't have much frame of reference when it comes to Imperial Stouts.  Appearance: Storm King has a solid black appearance. Very nice looking beer. The head is thick and long lived. The beer also has nice legging on the glass. Looks the way a stout should look.  Smell: Very intense smells here. You definitely know it's a stout when you breath in...lots of rich malt scent. There's also some chocolate, coffee, and nutty scents. The alcohol is also noticeable by smell, but not overwhelming.  Taste: The malt flavor was noticed first. Very pleasant taste up front. There is a hint of sweetness at first sip as well. I sensed strong coffee and chocolate in the mix, which pleased me. The hops comes on late, but STRONG. It definitely dominates the end of the sip. There's also a lingering resin flavor...not bad, but I kind of wish it wasn't there. The alcohol is out there in the open, but I wasn't bothered by it.  Mouthfeel: Feels heavy on the tongue, but what do you expect?! It's very fitting for the style of beer. Carbonation feels just about right. Not too much to complain about here.  Drinkability: As I stated before, I haven't sampled very many imperial stouts. However I do know the theory behind the beer, so obviously I don't expect it to be a beer that I can drink throughout the night.

345,1013,apbarwood,4.56,"It pours almost jet black with a huge caramel colored head of foam. Pour this one very gently because it will erupt out of your glass if you're not careful. Nice lacing and great head retention. The aroma features a strong roasted malt quality with some bracing hops to balance out. I definitely notice some bitter citrus notes. Flavors of roasted malt with a bittersweet dark chocolate taking the front and a bit of roasted coffee laced throughout. Also seems to be a nice smoky roasted note up front. This leads into a dark fruitiness like a dark chocolate covered cherry. Finally, closes with a nice clean hop flavor with a bitter grapefruit and orange peel combo. A nice medium body about it and the complex flavor palate works to hit all of my taste buds simultaneously and lingers for a while on the finish. This is a great RIS that drinks very well when reasonably young but would probably age very nicely. There's a phenomenal amount of complexity that makes it a true pleasure to drink.

Looks like a nice cup of Italian Roast, held up to light has a mild red hue. Nice mushroom cap billowed up in the center, frothy, and beautiful, looks like a mousse. Slight lacing down glass.  S- Warm, alcohol, sweet bitterness, cocoa, cream, deep rich maltiness.  T- Big roasted malty backbone chocolaty, sweet caramel, alcohol in the background, but doesn't over power at all, just lets you know it's there, nice warming feeling. Can definitely pick up the hops as a balancing ingredient to the bold malts. As it comes up to room temp it really starts to get interesting, the hops appear a bit more at the front, the bitterness is nice, deep rich chocolate is rich and full.

345,1013,Ralphus,4.22,"Is there anything more enjoyable than free beer? There is, free and excellent beer. I have only had the opportunity to experience this once and my Victory Storm King was it.  I was seated at Pizza Paradiso in DC enjoying a fine night of drinking when I requested a Storm King. While taking a break the waiter came over and told me they didn't have in the cooler and would be ok it was set on ice until I returned? I was, and when I returned and the waiter poured it I was told that it was on the house. I don't think I've ever had wood so close to a man before.  Storm King poured an attractive jet black. The tan head receded to a cap of foam that provided ample lacing. I really enjoyed the nose on this one.. lots of dark fruit, espresso and smoke flavouring. Wonderful. The taste was also a standout. Rich dark chocolate and espresso in a near perfect balance. No taste of alcohol was found.  Mouthfeel was just ok though. I found that it lacked the velvetty smoothness I was expecting (and found in other world class imperial stouts), but all things considered this is a minor nitpick.

Appearance: Pours an ominous jet black with a brown one-finger head that doesn't stick around long.  Smell: Some chocolate and coffee tones, with touches of molasses and alcohol.  Taste: Roasted malts and some chocolate and espresso really comes. This finishes with a pretty harsh hop bitterness, though, that, for me, really detracts from the quality of the beer. This could definitely do with some cellaring, I think.  Mouthfeel: Pretty thick and full-bodied. Definitely what you're looking for in an RIS. The only thing that's holding it back is that lingering hop bitterness.  Drinkabillity: Really isn't too heavy but I'm not sure how many of these I would really want in a night.  Overall, this is enjoyable but as I'm in Europe now I'm questioning the freshness of this brew. The hop bitterness this brew has though is really detrimental (I think) to the quality of this RIS. It might do better if aged for awhile, but there are a lot of other RIS's I will reach for fresh rather than this one.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

(4.0)  T - Roast barley, dark chocolate, bitter espresso, some citrusy hop flavor and crushing hop bitterness that lingers on into a very long finish.

This is definitely a beer with potential, but I don't feel that it has enough malty goodness for balance. (3.5)  **ONE YEAR OLD BOTTLE**  Complex fruit aromas and flavors are emerging.

Smell - Roasted, espresso like character, with bold hops and even some floral notes. Almost reminds me of a cross between a stout and some barley wines I've had.  Taste - A bold hop profile is quickly accommodated by a nice, malty espresso flavor. The hops bring out a bit of a floral touch to this brew. Slight alcohol burn going down.  Mouthfeel - A rich, full body with a creamy mouthfeel. Very good!  Drinkability - This one is a sipper, due to the full body and high ABV.

I had sampled a small amount of Great Divide's Yeti in the middle of several other Great Divide offerings, but that's my only other Imperial Stout Experience.  I guess I was expecting something more complex and was disappointed that the 9+% ABV was so obvious. The look of Storm King on pouring was nice and fit my expectations for the style, but it was basically downhill from there. The smell has some bright hops, fruit and roasted malt notes, but the dominant aroma is alcohol. The alcohol is even more dominant in the taste, giving Storm King an unpleasant, astringent bitterness that overshadows the other elements in the brew.

I don't give many beers a 5 for appearance, but this is gorgeous. Great lacing too!  Smell: Roasted malt, deep espresso and rich dark chocolate. Maybe a bit of dark fruitiness as well? Smells great.  Taste: The usual imperial stout flavors, but in such a great balance. Roasted dark malts with the same coffee and chocolate character as was on the nose. Fruit comes through a bit more on the palate, with a nice alcohol flavor to boost it. Strong hoppy bitter finish, perhaps just a tad too much so.

Its a completely opaque black hole abyss that swallows up any rays of light's chance at entering. The head was ludicrous in the sense that it was a gigantic 3.5 finger length soapy frothy of a tan head that leaves legs as it walks all over my pint glass. Looks like an over boiled pot of pasta with a tan hue.  Smell: Somewhat predictable for a stout and somewhat weak which rubs me the wrong way. What is present is a mix of very roasted malts with touches of fresh espresso bean. The backbone of the whole aroma is a bittersweet chocolate and dirt notes that ties together all its nuances as subtle as they all may be.  Taste: It is quite astringent and ridden with diacetyl. The typical stout flavor really is not there. It tastes almost like alcoholic black coffee with a flavorshot of dark chocolate.The extremely present harsh bitterness is unpleasant from my standpoint and it could be from the hops, alcohol or pungent coffee flavors but none of it really does it for me.  Mouthfeel: Robust and creamy as a stout would be expected but has more carbonation then its appearance led onto.  Drinkability: Not exactly a sipper but certainly not a sessioner, falls into the category of.. drinker. Drink away but remember that it packs a punch with its abv cloak its wearing.

Rubyish highlights when held to the light.  Smell: Smells like burnt coffee grounds. A hint of dark chocolate, but not much. Nothing really impressive to note.  Taste: This is where this beer really lost me. The two dominant flavors are roasted coffee and alcohol. Not a good combo. None of the chocolate sweetness found in many RIS. Very, very bitter finish. I love hops, but not to the point where I want them to have a major influence on stouts. I have to say the taste improved slightly upon warming, in that the bitterness gave way a bit.  Mouthfeel: A little highly carbonated for a stout. Not creamy like you'd expect. On the lighter side of heavy for sure.  Drinkability: I don't think I've ever had a stout that I disliked this much. The alcohol flavor makes this one almost unbearable in my opinion. I held off on my review until I'd had a second bottle on another night thinking my taste buds could have been off.

Taste: big imperial stout flavors: roasted grains with coffee and chocolate components, a little bit of apple, and some nice estery and alcoholey fruitiness. Hops aren't huge but there is a nice undercurrent of bright, citrusy hop flavor (perhaps that's all that can make it through the huge malt flavors) and a strong bitterness.

Lots of roasted notes, definite chocolate and coffee flavors. Finishes with a little astringent twang. Not much in the way of dark fruit flavors which I like in a RIS.  M - Nice mouthfeel, creamy, little carbonation tingle with some alcohol warmth, finishes pretty clean. Wouldn't mind a touch more body.

345,1013,berserker256,4.2,"The bottle tells me to ""enjoy by: Jan. 8 2014"" That's almost four and a half years from now. This Imperial Stout would be a good doomsday-basement-storage beer along with the bottled water, cans of corn and Spam, and loaded 30-round magazines for your AR-15. It pours out the color of strong coffee. Basically black. I hold it to the light and can't see through the glass whatsoever. The light brown head seems to last forever and looks like it could sustain the weight of the bottle cap placed upside down upon it. I'm unwilling to risk sinking the cap to the bottom so I don't attempt this. Smokey and sweet malty, almost like molasses, kind of aroma. Second sniff reminds me of a tub of prunes, also. Remarkably smooth at first sip. Great creamy texture. Almost lactic. light carbonation. Alcohol warmth hits you after several seconds. Light bitterness. Heavy lacing left on the glass as I sip it down. Well roasted malted barley with hints of smokeyness, coffee, and bourbon barrel. Maybe the heavy warmth of alcohol is tricking me into detecting bourbon barrel but I swear it's there. Wow... Lots of warmth. That's what I like about Imperial Stouts. This is a good one.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,bfields4,3.97,"This could be the darkest beer I have ever drank. Most seem to have a slight hue something to give away a tint, but I guess the storm king is about dark as night. Coming along for the ride is a nice frothy mocha brown head.  Dark fruit come first and foremost with almost an apricot twang. Roasted malts and dark chocolate form a nice body.  Dark chocolate follows through to the taste. A nice hoppy bitterness cuts the chocolate and gives way to a espresso and roasted to almost burnt malt flavor.  Rolls down the tongue maybe a tad much on the carbonation smooth, but I'd have to say that I have had smoother. The alcohol bit is nice though with the dark flavors.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

S- Rich roasted malt aroma with coffee and dark chocolate. A touch of caramel and smoke accompany the slightest whiff of alcohol.  T- Full roasted flavor with loads of dark malt and coffee. A nice wave of smoky espresso and bittersweet chocolate with a bit of hop bitterness in the finish. Alcohol level is hidden quite well.

345,1013,popery,4.2,"A very good Imperial Stout with a hoppy aroma and a fairly balanced character. It's honestly a bit of a disappointment given the beer's big reputation, but that's common with the more popular beers and it's still quite good. Storm King pours black and opaque with a thick, creamy beige head. I don't really know what Imperial Stout would garner a perfect appearance score, much less a 1 or 2. Anyway, the aroma is quite hoppy with a mix of floral and grassy/citric notes. There's a touch of roasted, chocolate/coffee malt in there, but it's a bit weak. The flavor is more satisfying. It's clean and relatively dryly sweet, err... not sticky or cloying anyway. Again, the flavor is a bit dominated by hops, but there's a decent malt backbone lurking in there. I've heard that the malt comes forward with age, which would probably push this beer above a four for me. The feel is slightly thin. I think that I've cracked this beer too early. It's only about nine months to a year old and could probably use another year or three.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,bcastine,3.11,"poured from 12oz bottle into my Portsmouth Brewery Tulip Glass  A: huge head that slowly dissipates, leaves lots of lacing, to the light this beer is more dark brown then black.  S: Burnt malt, coffee, dark chocalate, hops but you have to get your nose right in there to smell anything.  T: Again Burnt malt, coffee and the dry dark chocolate, lacks any oak, dark fruit flavors i typically enjoy from the style, really dry overall with no sweetness. This RIS really lacks complexity, maybe the most boring imp stout i've ever tasted. If this wasn't overly hoppy to mask the lack of depth in the malt, it would be a mess.  M: Holy carbonation, thin, thin, thin, by no means is this full bodied, far from what I expect from an RIS. I 've had oatmeal stouts that deliver more body then this, largest area of disappointment. I'd be curious to know what the OG was of this beer, not much thats for sure.  D: It is rather drinkable, its not a bad beer, just imho doesn't fit the style. I did find myself drain pouring the last remaining sips of the 3 I had, something i never do with RIS, most are good to the last sip, not this when warmed and lost carbonation it really fell apart.

Smells strongly of dark fruit, more specifically raisin and maybe some plum. Chocolate definitely hiding in there.  Taste and Mouthfeel-Taste was roasty with nice subtle bitter sweet chocolate. Some alcohol warmth which lingered along with the hop bitterness in the finish. Great balance overall.  Drinkability- I really liked the stout overall. Could manage a couple of these in a sitting.

Big three fingers of mocha brown head appears, receedes to a half inch, retains well, and leaves some great lace. Impressive.  A: Earthy hop forward, followed by graet roasty, chocolate, and coffee flavored malts. the balance between the sweet and savory scents is supurb.  T: Again, very nice. Chocolate and roasty nuts dominate, but the agressive hop profile balances the brew nicely. Very, very, good flavor.  M: Smooth for a heavy body. Good amount of carbonation. This one feels great.  D and overall impression: Drinkability is huge! Great balance, increadible flavor. Not your typical RIS. I usually get a sourness from the dried fruit in a RIS, but there is none to be found in this one. Overall, just a great beer. Almost an American Double Stout not an RIS.

A slight stink of alcohol and a think sweetness are present. Yep, smells strong and robust.  Glug glug glug  First thing I taste is creamy chocolate followed by a burst of hops that comes with a roasty and much dryer malt profile then I expected. The balance between this makes this a warming spicy kind of IS. As the hop taste begins to settle, the sweetness becomes a bit stronger providing the already complex brew with another dynamic. The booze is noticeable in this but certainly not over powering and definitely adds to the overall complexity. Pretty good, not as deep and smooth and sweet as the Old Ras but different, which is nice to see, less fruity and a bit more heat, while still somehow being less complex.

Smell - Considering I don't like anything overly hopped, I picked up the hops in this right off the bat. Malt, chocolate and coffee were present like most RIS, though once again, the strong hop presence caught me off guard.  Taste - I didnt enjoy the bitterness of this, it was almost a hop bitterness. Roasted Malt and coffee were present. Alcohol did come through some, but not bad.  Mouthfeel - Carbonation was somewhat high for the style. Was heavy, but not as heavy as others.  Drinkability - Being a RIS, drinkability isn't a strong suit, though this one isn't as heavy as others, bringing a drinkability factor to the table that others don't have.  If I liked hops, I would probably like this. I just didn't like how strongly this was hopped, especially for the style, confirming once again that everything I drink from Victory seems to have a strong hop presence.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Pours a rather deep brown/black into a wine glass and offers a full inch of mocha head. Decent retention of some bubbly goodness.  Chocolate and alcohol on the nose, touch of cocoa and some rich dried fruit. Quite endearing though a bit subdued for an RIS, yet offering a decent hop nose nonetheless.  Breaks down a bit in the flavor department as the smokey notes overwhelm. Feel and drink remain strong however, as the 9% is quite elusive on the palate.

Mouth-feel is excellent - full bodied, creamy, smooth and slightly oily. Finishes dry and bitter with a definite astringency - I'm not certain if it's from the hops or the bitter roasted malts - probably both. The high ABV is very well concealed.

Sometimes you see threads about value and how it plays into how you review a beer. While this really isn't in the same boat with a bourbon barrel aged RIS, the hop profile and the PRICE make this a more than worthy beer that i will DEFINITELY purchase again.

There is a clingy soily aftertaste.  M - Smooth, silky, and full bodied.  D - I had heard a lot about this Imeprial Stout and was expecting a lot, unfortunately it hasn't delivered. The taste is far too bitter, and the soily aftertaste is not too pleasant. There are better Imperial Stouts out there, e.g. Samuel Smith, Great Divide Yeti, Stone Russian, etc. The hops in Storm King are too powerful for my liking, and they ramp up the bitterness to levels that don't compliment the heavy malts.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

The first thing that hits the nose is in fact come piney sort of grapefruity hops. After you dig just a though deeper the typical imperial stout smell comes through more. A little coffee and a little dark chocolate. Even when i focus more on the darker deeper notes the hops still tickle my nose and make me forget its a stout. T= Hoppy like the smell up front but that doesn't last as long as it does in the nose. Its a little piney up front. A nice creamy smoothness washes it away though. The middle is more of a caramel malt taste resembling a brown ale. The finish however is imperial stout all the way. Tons of coffee taste lingers throughout. A little dark chocolate comes in but its mostly a coffee finish. M= a little bit more prickly than I like but not bad at all. Upon further investigation I notice a smoother thicker taste as the beer passes through my teeth. quite heavy. D= Pretty delicious. The only problem is after just a few sips I can feel the warmth in my belly and I don't know how many more I will be able to take. Very good beer though.

Slightly sticky.  D- Taste is not overpowering, texture is good, high ABVs are the only thing keeping me from another.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,DiverDan88,4.25,"A- Incredibly dark, with a nice mocha head when poured from the bottle. Held up to a light, impossible to see through, very thick, very dark.  S- Smells like chocolate and coffee, and hops.  T- Very hoppy for a stout, but altogether really delicious.  M- Thick, really hangs on the tongue.  D- Somewhat drinkable, but after two of these in a row, I'd probably be ready for something else.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

S - Roasted malts and hops.  T - Some hop flavor along with an overall bitter flavor. There's some roasted to go along with that.  M - Thin to medium, high carbonation.  D - Did not enjoy this.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Finn,4.37,"This bottle has been in my basement for about 3 years.  Poured into a wide-mouth chimay glass, this beer is quote dark. held up to the light you can't see anything throuhg it. A very thin but creamy tan head lingrs on the surface. Aroma is of dark chocolate milk, and mild fruity esters that compliment the chocolate quite well. I take a sip and it starts off with sweet chocolatey goodness, followed by a pervasive roasty flavor from the dark malts, and the a bitter hop finish blends in towards the end. The beer is full-bodied and smooth and silky, with just the right carbonation. You'd swear there were oats in this beer, to account for the creaminess. The drinkability is excellent, especially for a RIS, as they tend to get pretty robust and hard to handle much of. This is a unique RIS, as it isn't over the top, but is still a big beer with much complexity. I'd take it for drinkability over many others.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,petroos,3.95,"A: Pours almost completely opaque, dark chocolate brown with a dark tan 2 finger head. The head takes a couple of minutes to dissipate, and leaves some serious lacing. No carbonation to be seen through the hazy brew.  S: Rich dark flavors. Coffee, caramel and chocolate. Malts come through with some creaminess and a bit of alcohol on the backend. Smells almost like a cafe au lait.  T: Upfront bitter dark chocolate, then coffee overtakes the palate which is rounded out by burnt sugar and caramel and vanilla. The midpalate is cream and figuey sweetness with some red fruit. All coffee on the finish, with bitter hops coming through. I wish there were a bit more malt character.  M: Round, full mouthfeel. Has a lot of creaminess that's nice and the alcohol is well hidden. The carbonation is perfect.  D: Very nice drinkability, especially for an Imperial. The beer makes me want to come back for more, although I not crazy about the finish.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,COBeerBuff,4.63,"Appearance: Pours the darkest of blacks with absolutely zero light coming through. A gorgeous fluffy mocha colored head rests lightly above the storm below. The light fluffy head contributes wonderful lacing down the sides of the goblet. God, this looks yummy!  Smell: Sweet chocolate and coffee malty goodness. The roasted character is highly prevalent in the nose, and it smells delicious. Some hints of alcoholic esters fade in and out as well.  Taste: Roasted coffee and espresso goodness be found! The sweetness is well balanced by the bitterness of the coffee and the roasted malts. Some twinges of oatmeal also are present.  Mouthfeel: Thick and chewy. This is definitely a solid RIS. It coats the tongue and mouth, and leaves a very strong coffee and espresso aftertaste.  Drinkability: Its 9.1% ABV is on the lower side for some of the richer RIS's, and its coffee flavor is definitely on the high end as well. If either of these factors are not high on your list of wants, this might not be the RIS for you. Personally, it's exactly what I want from an RIS: rich, creamy, chewy, malty, bitter, yummy goodness!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Beejay,3.77,"A: A dark as motor oil black, with a head that gracefully shows up after an aggressive pour, then retreats slowly like flood waters leaving the plains.  S: Dark chocolate, bitter, with just a little bite from the alcohol. This must be what Willy Wonka smells like after an all night bender.  T: Not as sweet as I would have guessed. Bitter up front, followed by a burnt coffee aftertaste... This one could mellow out a bit and I wouldn't mind.  M: Thick, chewy, and coats the mouth. Thick.  D: Overall not my favorite stout, was looking for something a little smoother, and sweeter. Still good, and I bet it could make some killer half and halfs.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,kegger22,3.76,"Very dark beer with a tiny head that didn't last long. Once again, I got very little aroma (I'm going to have to see a doctor about my sniffer). The predominant tastes were bitter, burned coffee; not horrible, but might be better if it lightened up. The feel was heavy and rich, but you're not going to drink many of these. Not a bad beer, just up against some heavy-weight competition in the Russian Imperial Stout category. Note: It did warm up nicely in regard to taste.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,pd360,4.08,"This beer pours dark, almost completely black with a thin caramel head that lasted for the whole tasting. I was surprised by the lack of aroma, it had just the faintest scent of hops. Upon tasting, the first surprise is the pine hops flavor followed by a more familier coffee and bitter chocolate stout flavor. Overall a very nice beer that I would drink again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,SykDoc,4.33,"2008 edition, poured from a bottle into a snifter. It pours a very deep, dark brown and forms a 1 inch mocha colored head that sits around forever. Opaque when held to the light.  The aroma is good but a hair mild. This in one of those beers with a unique combination of piney/citrus hops up front and then a healthy blend of bitter coffee and dark chocolate.  The taste is quite good, again with the citrus/pine hops up front and then followed by a good dose of coffee and dark chocolate, and a bit of caramel. Just a twinge of alcohol is noticeable.  The mouthfeel shows a full body. Carbonation is just a little foamy to me. A pleasant dryness lingers at the finish and although sturdy as all get out, still smooth.  This is an easily drinkable beer although it would be hard to have more than 2 because it is strong and masks the alcohol well. Pleasant and flavorful, I will save the next for a winter 6 months to 1.5 years from now. Very good.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,eat,4.45,"Part of a trade with ritzkiss...thanks!  An aggressive pour yields an equally aggressive head; mocha coloured and thick like whipped cream. Great retention and lots of lacing. The beer itself is a deep, dark, opaque brown; not quite black, which is nice for a change.  Its complex nose includes espresso, caramel, molasses, cream, minerals and hops. Smells like a great cup of cappuccino.  Woah! This is awesome. Tons of quality, bitter espresso, strong dark chocolate and a solid showing of hops rounded out by sweet caramel malt in the background. It tastes very much like coffee without being overwhelming. Amazing. You can feel the alcohol in there but in a good way; it's only complimenting the other flavours.  A little thin in the feel for my preference though still a solid medium-bodied stout. The light carbonation is well-suited to the feel.  This easily ranks as one of the best stouts I've had. The ABV isn't listed on the bottle, but if this is really 9.1% it's incredibly drinkable for its strength. I could down a few of these in a short period of time. The only bad part about drinking this beer is that this is my only bottle.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,nicnut45,4.2,"Appearance- pours a jet black color with a brown head. There is about a fingers worth of foam. Reminds me of coca cola with head.  Smell- I smell vanilla, bourbon, tobacco, maybe even a bit of soy sauce. Smells great very well done  Taste- A bit bitter then what I expected almost too much as it over powers the malt. This beer showcases the harsher things in life that we love. It is salty, there is some whiskey flavor, oak, soy, and bitter dark chocolate.  Mouthfeel- this is thick and musty. More then you would expect a pleasent bitterness lingers on the mouth  Drink- Its a bit rough for me but nonetheless complex and flavorful. I bet this would go great with a cigar.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Arbitrator,2.7,"Chilled bottle into a glass. Courtesy of a trade with Uwftke26.  A: A brown-colored body that pours a pitch black in the glass. Has a huge, foamy tan cap that recedes into thick clumps on top of the brew, and leaves substantial lacing with register marks down the glass. Exquisite.  S: Chocolate, espresso, smoke, and rotting citrus. Yuck.  T: Starts off with huge espresso, smoke, and roasted malts. Remains mostly bitter, although the mid-taste sees a slight sweet contribution of dark chocolate. The finish is again smoky, with citrus hops rounding it out. Leads into a bitter espresso aftertaste. Wow, kind of a clashing taste.  M: Full-bodied. Slightly high carbonation that prickles the tongue a bit. Well hidden ABV.  D: Surprisingly hoppy for an imperial stout, and the hop variety isn't one that blends particularly well with the traditional RIS flavors. I could see this aging into a well-rounded stout in a year, after the hops fade a bit. But it's fairly harsh as a young brew, and the experience is not spectacular enough to make me seek it out again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,thekanna,3.43,"A: Pitch black with a moderate tan head which rests on top and slowly dissipates.  S: Strong dark chocolate and roasted malt aromas. Charcoal and a generally burnt wood presence are also detected.  T: Extremely strong espresso and dark chocolate notes. Malts seem like they went through a smokehouse and just escaped, scathed, from the other side. Body has an undeniable sourness of prunes. Ends with an extremely strong, powerful, hop bitterness.  M: Thick, rich, and heavy.  D: This was more an assault to my palate than an enjoyable brew. It would be noticeably better if it weren't so rough around the edges.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

S: Roasty and chocolatey aromas that unfortunately have to fight for attention with the citrusy hops.  T: Typical coffee/chocolate notes, but again, the hops are a bit too prominent. They become more bearable as it comes closer to room temperature. Rather complex, but not necessarily enjoyable.  M: As thick and syrupy as it should be.  D: This definitely has potential, but it's a bit harsh this fresh. This might really be something about a year out.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Not much visible carbonation at all.  S - Highly roasted and burny malts with chocolate undertones followed by a sweet alcohol presence.  T&M - Very much like the smell. A bit more chocolately in the taste and the hops really shine through here. More bitter than expected with espresso bean notes. Alcohol provides a smooth mouthfeel with some warmness. A bit sticky on the lips and tongue.  D - A very nice beer but I'm not sure I could have more than one in a sitting. Not only is the alcohol high but the beer is a bit sticky and leaves a bitter taste from the burnt malts. At some points the aftertaste is quite like eating coffee grounds.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,kdoc8,4.28,"Big thanks to kkulacki for finding this one. Question though: did anyone else find that their 12oz bottle of Storm King Stout contained noticeably less than the expected volume?  Anyway, hopefully some bottling error hasn't affected the deliciousness factor.  The appearance is dark black with a thin bubbly head. A little flat, which makes me wonder about this bottling aspect further. In any case, it smells great - very sweet with mostly chocolate tones being prevalent. The taste is not as sweet as the smell would indicate with a lot of bitter coffee taste up front and then almost pure roasted flavor on the finish, with a very small touch of alcohol taste. The aftertaste is pure coffee.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

This stuff may stain my glass it is so dark.A small tan head forms and settles quickly. The Aroma is black coffee and semi-sweet chocolate combined. One sip and already I am supprised with this one.Not the smooth creamy flavor that was expected.yet not at all dissapointing.a slightly bitter bite most likely due to the 9.10%ABV mixing with that roasted coffee and chocolat I mentioned earlier.

Deep black pour with a stiff mocha head. Good lace and retention. Roasty nose, with lots of cocoa and coffee, but with a good splash of citrus. Flavour is solid as all hell, with coffee mixing in with chocolate providing a decent base and citrus hops providing the laurels. Full body and low carbonation.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

After a couple minutes the head goes down but still has some good retention and leaves some lacing down the glass but not to much. The smell is coffee, some chocolate, and some roasted malts. Pretty typical of an RIS, pretty good but it doesn't stand out as being really great but it could just be me. Taste is pretty good. There is some chocolate but mainly I taste coffee especially in the aftertaste. Pretty good, and has a good mouthfeel as it's pretty thick. Has a high ABV but it's still quite drinkable. I probably wouldn't do more than a couple in a night but those would be drinkable.

Alcohol spice and dark fruit/wine flavors  M- very creamy and full  D- Not overpowering but the high alcohol makes it prohibitive to drink more than a couple",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,NODAK,2.08,"Aroma is of hops and very thick, coffee-like malts.  Hoppy upfront with a dose of floral hops smacking the palate at first. This gives way to the aforementioned roasted, coffee malt that was on the nose. However, the malt is pushed aside by a burst of hop bitterness on the finish surprisingly...leaving the palate with a bit of grapefruit, astringent bitterness that slowly increases in intensity and hits the back of the throat. I must say I was expecting a beer that leaned more to the malts versus hops here and am somewhat surprised. Also, the mouthfeel is thinner than I thought for style.  The aftertaste, as was mentioned, is rather bitter...the sides of the tongue want to pucker for quite some time after the swallow. The malts, by that time, are a distant memory.  I just don't find this to be very drinkable at all. I wanted to chew the rich malts here...I wanted a thick, creamy mouthfeel abounding with malty goodness...and I just didn't get it. The bitter finish and aftertaste detract from drinkability and really, this isn't something I'd drink again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

A slightly over-eager pour results in 3 fingers of mocha head that drops down to a nice blanket on the top of the beer. Some light lacing.  The first smell I get is surprisingly a hint of dark fruits which quickly fades in a dark roasting malts, hints of milk chocolate, definitely some ethanol.  Man, this beer enters smoooth. But the entry is quickly forgotten when the bitterness of the roasting/burnt malts kicks in, followed by a leathery, herbaceous hop bitterness and then continues on with the heavy-handed malts. Hints of espresso and a fair bit of bitter chocolate weave their way through, a faint sweetness is also there. Some alcohol warming in the finish. This is a serious beer and I am thoroughly enjoying it but it doesn't have the nuances of some of the other big RIS's out there.  Nothing fixes a dreary, rainy day like a big stout.

S- Coffee/caramel malt smell, it does however hit you with a moderate amount of hops.  T- The smell definitely translates to the flavor, I taste a coffee flavor with a tiny bit of caramel tossed in there. Hops are very present in this drink especially towards the end, just when you think the hops are going to overwhelm you it subsides quickly and finishes semi smooth.  M- Creamy but not a thick stout by all means.  D- Overall great flavor especially if you like a stout with a good amount of hops, 9.10% alcohol makes it just that much better.

345,1013,bamadog,3.9,"Big thanks to Beerman207 for hooking me up with this. Poured from the bottle into a tulip.  Appearance: Pours very dark brown/near black with a big two finger head (yeah, I may have poured this one a little hard) that is a very deep tan; head has pretty minimal retention but that's about what I'd expect from an RIS; body is opaque. Leaves a pretty thick, yet uneven, lacing.  Smell: Smell is of chocolate malts - deep, dark and roasty; hints of coffee/mocha; a slight hoppy bitterness is creeping around in the back as well.  Taste: Pretty much right in line with the smell - nice chocolatey malts and some hint of burnt roastiness; there is a slight bitter hop presence that has just a slight tinge of citrus, but I wouldn't want to venture a guess as to what (hell with it, I'm going to guess orange peel)...  Mouthfeel: A pretty smooth and creamy body that is just a tad on the watery side, still very nice. Leaves a moderate coating in the mouth, especially on the roof of the mouth; there is actually a pretty lively carbonation as well.  Drinkability: A nice offering from Victory. A solid RIS that has it's ducks in a row. I would definitely pick up another one of these. The ABV is of course a little on the higher side due to the style and being a stout it does sit a little heavy so I probably wouldn't want too many in a row, but definitely worth picking up.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

S: Bitter, dark chocolate and toffee with hints of tobacco. Some earthy, grassy hops as well.  T: Some coffee, maybe a hint of chocolate, but also rather grassy/earthy on the front, finishing with a pretty good dose of earthy, hoppy bitterness..maybe even a touch of grapefruit. Definitely heavier on the hops than many in its genre.  M: Medium body...pretty crisp and carbonated for a RIS. Doesn't have the ""engine-oil"" mouthfeel of a lot of the others I've had lately.  D: Goes down pretty easily for a 9+% stout.

345,1013,homebrew311,4,"Poured from bottle to Chimay chalice...  A: Pours this and dark with a tan head. Decent head retention for an IS.  S: Wow, the first thing on the nose is an assault of earthy hops. The hops are complemented by nice chocolaty roasted malt undertones. Reminds me of the aroma from Old Rasputin with a tad more hop presence.  T: There is a lot going on here between the fresh hops and the malt backbone of this beer. There aren't too many imperial stout where the hops stand out like this, but the flavors harmonize quite well. The bitterness from the hops is undercut by the bold malt profile.  M: A little thinner than I am used to for imperial stouts, but it still has a heavy body. The mouthfeel isn't is a little sharp from high carbonation, would love a creamier texture here.  D: Excellent aroma and taste make for another solid brew from Victory. This is certainly one of the most hop forward stouts I have tried to date.

Color is about as close to black is you can get, with half a finger of tan head.  Taste is mostly hop bitterness, with maybe some alcohol in the finish.

Wow.  Smell is very strong amounts of alcohol drenched dark fruits as well as a definite hop aroma that provides a bit of a citrusy kick along with some chocolate candy bar and dark roasted coffee scents to boot. Lots going on and constantly changing.  Taste is one that matches those smells quite well. Raisins , dark roasted coffee, bitter chocolate, citrusy hops and a very chewy resiny malt profile. Excellent complexity!  Very smooth drinking RIS, definitely one of the better ones I've had. This one fresh reminds me a lot of the Smutty Imperial Stout.  I am glad they are still making RISs in 12 oz bottles!

345,1013,taylorhamrick,4.26,"Pours out a very dark color, black, with a bit of ruby/brown highlights on the edges. A cm thick brown head sits on top, looks fairly dense, but falls away kind of quickly, leaving only a little bit of lacing. The smell is filled with roasted malts - chocolate, coffee, even a bit of smoky meat or burnt toast. There is also a note of dark, overripe fruit - plums, blueberries, and a very nice caramelly sweetness. A tiny bit of earthy hops still remain in this one. The smell is pretty strong and pleasant, exactly how I like it. The taste delivers as well. I can't tell whether I want to give it a 4.5 or a 4, but very solid. A huge roasted note hits first, with heavily roasted coffee, roasted and burnt so much that it starts to remind me of the black ends of BBQ or maybe even charcoal. Backed up with a mildly hoppy body, though it lacks heavy bitterness and without too much aroma or flavor. There's a nice finishing sweetness, that makes keeps it from being too dry and acrid. Very good in my opinion, not really estery or too dried out like many other impy stouts. The body is nice and full, with a hint of a burn - either alcohol or extra roastiness. Nice. And this one doesn't hit you over the head or pound you into submission. It's pretty easy drinking, and I would recommend it to all who might be interested into a widely available RIS.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Nice sudsy finish to the pour as the bubbles float from the bottom of the beer to the top.  Smells of espresso, maple, dark chocolate and roasty grains with a burnt brown sugar syrup touch.  Tastes like Old Rasputin. That is my first thought. I mean very close almost like a clone with a slight metallic twinge not noticed in Rasputin. Roasted coffee beans, burnt sugar, dark and light chocolate with a marshmallow hint in the finish.  Chewy caramel mouthfeel. Big bodied and heavy but nice and chewy too.  Very good RIS, not great.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,morebeergood,3.85,"Ordered a bottle at Cornwall's before the Sox game this weekend. Poured into a standard pint glass. Dark black color. Very carbonated for an RIS, as a huge head formed. Smelled like espresso or high octane coffee. First thing you notice with the first sip is the alcohol. It really seems to attack you. The flavor is also quite powerful. Chocolate, coffee, and malt dominate. But the alcohol certain leaves its mark on the flavor and the throat. Slight bit more than I prefer in a stout. I feel that this beer could be stellar if it was a tad bit more easier to drink. Otherwise, this is a great RIS.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

By the time the waiter brought it to our table the head had all but disappeared, I'm assuming the top 3/4"" of the glass had been foam. At 9.1% ABV I was expecting a little more kick but I was pleasantly surprised at how smooth this pint was. The pint had a very nice opaque black colour but and the remnants of the head were dark cream. The roasted malts were very complex, no real single overbearing flavour and it drinks more like a porter than a stout. Feels very good in the mouth.

345,1013,wnh,4.43,"On-tap at The Bavarian Lodge in Lisle, IL. Served in a 12 oz. snifter, filled to the brim.  Pitch black, with no noticeable highlights, even when held up to the light. A solid two fingers of foamy tan head, taking its time subsiding. In a nutshell, exactly what I want in an imperial stout.  The first whiff took me by surprise. Sweet, piney hops up front, which took me a few moments to pinpoint. Notes of bitter, slightly sweet chocolate underneath, and sweet malt in the background. The alcohol finally releases, presumably as the beer warms, followed by some delicious citrus hop notes on the tail end.  Follows suit on the tongue, with piney hops up front followed by bitter chocolate, both brought back into balance by a strong sweet malt backbone. I was disappointed by the overall lack of complexity--more chocolate, coffee, etc. was expected--but I'm favorably impressed by the sheer hoppiness of this brew.  Thick and rich on the palate, with a smooth mouth-coating effect and accompanying lingering flavor. My third beer of the night, so I can't say for sure how well-hidden the alcohol is, but my hunch is that this is an exceptionally drinkable beer regardless. A strong, unique version of the style, and one I'll be seeking again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

345,1013,photomike,3.56,"Close to pitch black with an explosion of beige head. Sticky lacing all the way up the glass, and infinite retention on the eventually short head.  Smell is hersheys syrup and espresso. A bit boozy.  As I go in for the first taste, I see an antelope standing up. Reminds me of this: http://www.deanj.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/anteater.jpg  This beer, with 1700 reviews seems to be saying ""FUCK YOU IM VICTORY STORM KING STOUT YOUR REVIEW DOESNT MATTER""  Regardless, the taste is of bitter chocolate, booze and black coffee. Very malty, very dry. Like a boozy porter.  Somewhat light in the body for an RIS, but this thing is velvety and smooth. Warm and boozy finish. Light carbonation.  The booze in this is noticeable enough to make me take pause about continuing beyond a single 12oz bottle.  A great beer, no doubt, but somewhat of a letdown with all the fuss about this beer.

From the damn near pitch black coloration to the strong, wonderfully bitter finish - I'd like to use one word. BOOM! Most definately packs a punch. I really like the malty, thick, coffee taste it has goin. Something to note - poured from a bottle into frosty mug - as i drink it, i can look at the side of my glass and count the ""head lines"" to see how many drinks it took for me to finish my beer. I would mark that as an outstanding quality, (if i was taking notes in my beer journal.) Another good quality - I've only drank two so far, and I'm buzzin nice.

Good blend of coffee and chocolate malts, nice finish with some piney hops. Reminds me of a lighter/less robust FFF Black Sun Stout. Some wood notes too. Slight hints of citrus can be detected.

Not what I was expecting at all.  Taste - grapefruit peelings, white pith, burnt coffee, and burnt malt. Tastes more like a Black IPA, and not a very good one either. Where are the flavors associated with a RIS? There is no chocolate flavor at all, or dark fruit. No sweetness. Just harsh bitterness.  Mouthfeel - High carbonation, light bodied, and dry. Too thin for a RIS.  Drinkability - Not worth seeking out, disappointing for a RIS.  Not sure how this can be an RIS. It doesn't taste like one at all. It also does not get any better as it warms.

Initial aromatic impression of hops, with some almost burnt black malt underneath. then some sweeter, saltier chocolate and light berry-fruit. First sip is quite hoppy, a bit salty and smokey in a meaty way, bitter as well. Initial burp tastes of hops. The flavor mellows as the beer warms. It becomes sweeter, with dark caramelized sugars, vanilla, light coffee, and a bitter piney finish. The mouthfeel is definitely light for the style, and in the medium range overall. This is honestly not quite like any imperial stout that I have had before. It drinks small, but has a good balance of flavors. There are more flavor and aroma hops than maybe any stout that I've had, but they work well to balance the typical malt sweetness of the style and make this really drinkable.

Moderate carbonation, slightly slick, as it should be...overall.  D-This is decent, but a letdown overall. If I want a stout, I'll take a Founders, or a Stone. There is something rather appealing about the sour wine characteristic of Storm King that I cannot discount, and it is a bit of a changeup in this style, but probably not one that makes it worth coming back to...at least for me.

Lots of alcohol present in the nose as well.  T= The front end was all sweet syrupy malts and roasted grain bitterness. Dark chocolate, treacle, molasses, and chocolate covered cherries all made an appearance. The hops are a bit too much for the style IMO, but they do cut the malt sweetness quite a bit. Finish was slightly dry and showed more roasted grain bitterness.  MF= Super heavy body with a very thick and viscous mouthfeel. A real tongue-coater.

And to top it off, 9.4% and barely a hint of alcohol!  The mouthfeel is oddly fitting for a hoppy RIS, whatever that is supposed to mean.

345,1013,sweetbrew82,4.23,"12 oz. bottle/ Best by Oct. 16 2013  P: The deep leathery brown liquid exits the bottle to form a jet black pool of delicious looking beer in my glass. The 2 fingered head that sits atop looks exactly the same color as wet sand. It's thick and creamy with good retention, settling to a thin sheet while leaving strings of lace behind. Good looking Stout!  A: Deep roasted barley, chocolate, coffee, molasses, and citric hops underneath. There is some alcohol present as well.  T: First of all, this needs to be imbibed at as close to room temperature as possible! Drinking this too cold is doing it a major disservice. The deeply roasted barley is sweet, but has a burnt bitterness to it as well. Chocolate, molasses, and charred wood are all present, but the hops are what makes this stand out for me. It kind of reminds me of Big Bear Black Stout in that sense. Being a certified hophead, I can definitely appreciate their citrusy goodness. Sweet and bitter engage in an epic struggle, but the bitterness wins out in the end thanks to that huge hop bill, slightly burnt barley, and some black coffee that really comes out on the tail end for quite the dry finish. The alcohol is a bit hot, but isn't detrimental to the experience.  M: In my opinion, Storm King's mouthfeel is just perfect! It's a full-bodied, viscious beer with a thick & creamy, rich & oily-feeling texture that almost feels like an old-fashioned chocolate milkshake in my mouth. Having said that, it still manages to stay light on its feet, if that makes any sense whatsoever.  Notes: This is a great beer! From my understanding, the best before dates are 5 years after bottling. This would mean that this beer was bottled only 6 months ago. For such a young RIS, it feels really refined and delicious. With some time to hibernate in my cellar, it could be out of this world! Highly recommended",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

S - Roasted/toasty malts and an almost berry sweet smell were present initially, definitely the reason I loved this beer the first time I tried it. Definitely chocolate, but of the darker variety. Distinct and interesting for sure.  T - Very moderately sweet from the malts balanced with a balanced bitter aftertaste, like baker's chocolate. Even a bit sour and a definitive alcohol is present, at least after it warms. Finish is present and average to somewhat long in length. Not overwhelming, with lots of potential for food pairing.  M - Light to medium body (not filling whatsoever for such a complex beer). Texture is dry, but not too dry, and somewhat watery and a bit of syrup stickiness left on the palate. Very softly carbonated and the alcohol is noticeable at higher temperatures.  D - Well, due to the ABV alone, not very.

With the high ABV I could only drink one. I can see how people would love this, but the taste on this one did not agree with me. I do not see this as being as complex as others I have tried.

345,1013,TheMistler,3.9,"Dark, dark brown, basically black. Not as thick or viscous as some Imperial Stouts... is it weird that I'm slightly disappointed by that? Pours with a good amount of dark tan head, millet-y, composed of rather large bubbles. Settles to thick, creamy cap with a hearty ring and lots of sticky spider web lacing.  Tangy chocolatey bread nose. Grains. Light roasted notes. Hops.  Dark chocolate notes interact with cocoa nibs. Coffee comes in, subsiding only to be replaced by a nice, unique roasted hop flavor. In fact, there is a bevy of hops in this here stout. Leafy, and pretty bitter. Some alcohol drying at end. Everyone seems to mention the balance of malt and hops. This is not what I'm looking for in an RIS. I'm looking for malt heavy, and this beer is that. It is also doused with a good bit of hops, however.  When cold, the carbonation is quite crisp. Upon warming, this is a creamy, medium to full bodied brew. Maybe not ""easy drinking,"" given the heaviness of the flavor, but the ABV is well hidden and it goes down easy.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

A- Pitch black with a big chocolate-tan head.  S- not much. Some roast and coffe, some hops. I actually tried so hard to smell it , that I got a nostril full of beer.  T- Very dry for a RIS. Dry roast, black coffie, strong hop bitterness, slight astringency. Malt became a little more pronounced as it warmed. Some noticable heat from the alcohol.

This stout just has it all - perfect hop and malt balance (both ends being rather extreme) - chocolate, coffee, vanilla and a touch of smoke (to name a few).  I have to say that this is currently my favorite stout. Awesome label design too. It's got a mules kick in terms of ABV, but its complex and rich flavors mask it well.  This is a ""must-drink"" beer to try for those that like complex stouts.

Deep dark brown to black color with medium brown one finger head. There are simultaneous nutty and hoppy smells emanating from the glass. Once it warms the subtleties are released and include notes of chocolate and caramel. Are you sure this is a imperial stout? There is such a hop presence in the tasting of this, if it was a blind tasting, I would've said black IPA. Brilliant balance of malt and hops, it adds a punch of bitterness on the palette. This does have an ever so slight grit to it but doesn't take enough away from it to be a problem.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

I love the bottle  Smell: I get mostly coffee notes and some molasses smell, a little bit choclatey, very nice  Taste: More chocolate and molasses than I expected interesting balance with the coffee flavor. The alcohol is definitely noticable, finishes with some coffee, mostly molasses and maybe some raisins?  Mouthfeel: Lightly carbonated, hold it in your mouth and let it warm up, fairly heavy but not very thick.  I bottle at a time is definitely enough, but I could be satisfied with 2.

S: Lots of roast, coffee bitterness, alcohol, hint of floral hops.  T: Big bad roast, very burnt tasting, with some floral hop, dirt, and an unpleasant harsh alcohol astrigency. Reminds me of my first homebrewed porter.  M: Medium bodied, with enough to carbonation to make it sharp on the tongue. Where da viscosity?  D: Rubbing alcohol and meets roasted dirt.

Very well balanced, but it doesn't have that one standout feature to put it over the top  M--Relatively thin but the carbonation feels great on the tongue  D--Didn't take long to put away the 12 oz. bottle and could see myself drinking a few of these in a sitting",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

First taste was a heavy roast malt with hints of coffee. Aftertaste is a dry hoppy feeling which I usually don't like but wasn't overpowering in this beer.  I wouldn't have more than one or two at a time, but is a nice one to mix in.

Head was large and in charge powered by a dense lather of mocha colored foam. My glass was littered with mocha colored slabs and rings of foam  S: smells of dark chocolate syrup, open fire roasted malts, and espresso all with adamant smells of green flaky cones. The greens smell of the citrus and floral type, very clean and earthy hop smells  T: within my glass exists an absolute contradiction...is this possible? This beer houses dark, I mean dark, chocolate notes swirled with burnt caramel crusted fire cooked malts. Flavors are of a dark pungency like no other. Great roasted flavors also portray a splendid espresso bean penchant that is top notch. The flavors are powerfully dark and in control, never to much. The hops play a huge role in keeping things from getting out of control and provide a soft tangy finish that my mouth begs for more drink. This is by far the best interplay between hops and a rich 'n' tasty stout that I have ever had  I remember having this beer some time ago, before my BA days, and I never really thought much about it. Not sure how that is possible? this beer is a monster! Imagine this with bacon and eggs in the morning or even late night with a bowl of vanilla bean ice cream, wow!  M: this has to be one of the best bodies for a stout to date. Creamy, rich, succulent, and smooth. It is very heavy and maintains a viscous character throughout. I want to say ""syrupy"" but that always seems to take a condescending vibe, but it is damn close. Chew me please!  D: an absolute monster stout of great proportions.

The hoppy aroma overpowers any other aroma and I didn't expect it at all. After letting it warm a bit, I can smell chocolate and a bit of coffee and the hop aroma has backed off.  T: Roasted malts hit your palate first, as expected. You can really taste the hops in the finish and aftertaste, which I'm not sure I like in a stout.  M: A bit thin in the mouth.

And I don't get more than that.  Tastes of a very dark chocolate, charred malts and coffee. It's hoppy for a stout, but I don't mind, it fits well with the burnt flavor. Bitter, real bitter and it lingers. A tough beer.  More carbonation than I expected, but that's okay. It's harsh but not off-putting.  Drinkable, despite how bitter it is.

Smell of roasted malt and chocolate, slight coffee and lastly some hoppiness. Taste was very appealing. Unable to really taste the hoppiness right away, reminds me of something other than a stout.

I understand it's all relative, but the heavy darkness, the way light just can't escape it's clutches like a collapsed star ... it makes my mouth water just thinking about it. A dark brown head compliments the swarthy complexion just right.  Smell is pleasant. A nice coffee tang prepares the tastebuds for a wonderful journey.  Taste is impeccable. Always a nice pick-me-up when chasing the Storm King.  Acceptable mouthfeel, if not slightly watery for an Imperial Stout.  Drinkability is up there with the best of them as an Imperial.

345,1013,Hoagie1973,3.73,"The first time I tried this I didn't much care for it, but after a year or two I found that I liked it much better.  Poured pitch black with a HUGE initial head that came out of nowhere. I had to back way off my pour and let it settle for a minute. Rocky coffee-colored head that retains excellent and leaves thick clumps of patchy, sticky lacing.  Aroma of bitter chocolate, espresso, and of course, strong floral hops.  Starts off with a roasted malt bitterness including hints of cocoa and coffee. Floral hops show up in the middle and dry out the finish. Hoppy bitterness lingers in the finish a bit too long. Alcohol is well blended and lends a nice warmth. Missing is any real sweetness to balance the insane hop level. Malt presence is good and flavorful, but lacks the sweetness that I look for to offset the hops. Without it the hops seem a touch harsh and overdone. Still good, but could be better in my opinion.  Mouthfeel is nicely creamy and full. Retained enough carbonation even with an overzealous pour.  I'm cellaring a few of these and looking forward to the results.

If I put HopDevil and this side by side, I might not tell the difference. Hop all around.  T = Surprise. Strong coffee and some hints of chocolate burst out front. But just when you thought ""well the smell was misleading"", bam!!, here come the hops. Hops kick ass all the way through. At first I thought, this isn't good, but once my mind opened up a bit, it actually grew on me. Something about the stark contrast of beginning to end appealed to me. I think maybe Victory is forcing the creation of a new beer category. Maybe Hop Stout or Flower Stout or something.  M = Pretty thin for a ""stout"". Carbonation was low to medium. Not bad, but could be a bit meatier. But what the hell is this beer anyway?  D = Extremely drinkable if you keep this in the stout category. Honestly, like a nice IPA.  In retrospect, why would I expect Victory, in their well established hop expertise, not to dominate their stout with the flower of the Gods?  Would be interesting to see what cellaring would do to this brew. Honestly, it may be a detriment to it. Without the hops, I wonder what would be left?  Very interesting take on the stout style.

A: Pours very dark, although not overly thick for this style. The color is near black, and the head is quite large and caramel-colored. Almost opaque on the pour; opaque in the glass.  S: Not terribly strong smelling. Hints of cocoa. A little bit of hops. Dark malt. On further sniffing, actually quite hoppy for the style.  T: Hints of black licorice. Quite a bit of hops for the style. Some malt, and actually quite spicy.  M: Very thin in the mouth. Slightly spicy with a good amount of carbonation.

But unlike many stouts, there are definite hop notes to be found here.  Taste: Huge roasted malt body with lots of big semi-sweet chocolate and roasted coffee notes. Definite hop splashes at times, a very welcome addition. The alcohol is hidden rather well under the big malt body, but raises its head from time to time. Lots of coffee and some nice hop bitterness in the finish.  Mouthfeel: A very thick body, almost reminiscent of a milkshake. Perhaps a little chalky at times, but it works. Medium carbonation with nice alcohol warmth in the mouth.  Drinkability: As you'd expect from a Russian Imperial Stout, this is firmly in sipper territory. A beer to be savored.  Verdict: A very solid Imperial Stout with a unique hop flourish that really sets it apart. Well worth the hype, this is a beer that delivers (especially at this price point).",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,johnmichael712,4.28,"Appearance: Poured out of a 12 oz. bottle into a Chimay goblet. Freshness date on bottle is December 18, 2013. This beer pours a dark, dark black with a beautiful dark khaki colored head that is much larger and more easily formed than other Russian Imperial Stouts I've had. The head doesn't appear to be very sticky due to the high ABV (9.1 %) and doesn't stick around too terribly long, which is just fine with me because I'm ready to drink this beast.  Smell: Hops. This is definitely the hoppiest nose on a stout I've ever smelled, and while I don't know the IBU's of this beer I'm assuming they're very high. The hops are very citrusy, very grapfruity, and are well balanced with the aromas of roasted black malt and chocolate. There is, however, a bit of solventy alcohol and blackberry that are off-scents and keep me from rating the smell of this beer higher than a four.  Taste: This beer starts off with a wonderful chocolate and malt flavor with a hint of espresso (the usual chocolate/espresso flirtation that Imperial Stouts have) and finishes with a prominent citrusy hop flavor. Just as I assumed from the smell this is the hoppiest tasting Russian Imperial Stout I've ever had, and I must say that I really am enjoying the dry, lingering finish. Unlike some of the other dark beers I've had that are lower on hops the prevalence of the hops here acts as an aperitif, allowing one to drink this beer much more rapidly than other in its class.  Mouthfeel: The brewers at Victory have left no stone unturned with this brew, and the mouthfeel is no exception. This is one incredibly creamy, rich, and full-bodied stout, and it is a real pleasure to drink. It has the creaminess of an oatmeal stout, which is damn impressive. The carbonation is also very low, which is nice.  Drinkability: There is absolutely no taste of the 9.1% alcohol the bottle claims this beer has, and I could definitely see myself drinking a few of these in a night. Considering the fact that it's Saint Patrick's Day, and that this is one of the smoothest and most delicious stouts I've had, I just might have to do that!  Notes: At the time of my review this beer is sitting at number ninety-one on the best of BA list, and it honestly deserves to be ranked at least this high, if not higher. In my opinion this is one of the best Russian Imperial Stouts money can buy, and I'm falling in love with the beer with every sip. The fact that this beer is a year-round release gives me all the more reason to always keep this one stocked in my fridge. Supposedly it's even better with some age on it, so I'll be going to the store soon to pick up another six-pack to throw in the cellar.

I wasn't paying attention and poured a little too fast and had to let the head settle for a long time - good retention. You can clearly smell the hops and roasted malts. When I got around to drinking it the initial flavor was all hops followed by burnt coffee that lingered long after swallowing. Only a faint hint of the alcohol, but it's not surprising given how overwhelming the hops and burnt coffee is. I wish I could say I tasted something else in this brew, but I really didn't. There's little to no balance in it. It's sort of cross between a DIPA and stout/RIS, but I think fails at both, because the hops are really strong for a stout/RIS, and the malts aren't sweet enough to underpin hops like a good DIPA.

Looks a little thin for an RIS though.  Smell is not what I was expecting. It smellss pretty yeasty and there is a slight hop smell. Some roasted notes come through too but it is not very aromatic for an RIS.  Taste is a little different than what I was expecting but very good. It's not as toasty and over powering as alot of others in it's same category but that makes it very sessionable. It's like they didn't use alot of chocolate malt or something. Can't put my finger on it. There is a huge toasty aftertaste.  Mouthfeel I wish was a little more viscous but carbonation is good.  Overall a good beer.

345,1013,Ohiovania,3.55,Really looking forward to trying this one. It smells great and looks fantastic. The head laces very nicely and takes a bit to go down but it the rest of the beer doesn't lace well or maybe I was too thirsty. Feel of it was a bit too lightly weighted for an imperial stout. Hardly any alcohol taste what so ever so it's easy to down these things and not realize it. Taste is a little sweet with some lightly roasted coffee and just a vestige of bitterness.

The smell is burnt caramel and licorice, balanced with some mild hoppiness ( I wonder how many hops lost their lives to be sacrificed to the storm king?) some warming alcohol is wearing a chocolate scented suit. The taste is the same, slightly bitter on the front of the tongue like dark chocolate, followed by a punch of tempered sweetness. Delicious balance of flavor.

345,1013,BringusKilkenney,3.9,Appearance- Had a great look out of the bottle depending on how you pour it could get a big foamy head of just a little bit of nothing both are a dark woody brown. Smell- The average imperial smell chocolates and alcohol the only bad part about this is the alcohol is a little overwhelming in the smell. Taste- As far as imperials go nothing to special dont get me wrong it is a good beer and i thoroughly enjoyed it. Had chocolates and alcohol for the strong points of the taste with a nice malty finish. Mouthfeel- Very smooth and easy to take down the alcohol may overrun some of the other aspects but is very unnoticeable in the mouthfeel. Drinkability- This is a great imperial to just sit around and drink while i feel it is a little average i will continue to enjoy it as it is readily available and accessible.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,zminor,4.23,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Duvel tulip glass. Small amount of cappuccino head dissipated quickly.  After reading a lot about this stout I had some really high expectations - thankfully I was not disapointed. Upon the first smell I knew I was in for a great beer - strong aromas of espresso and coffee were clear. The taste was fantastic and matched that. Lots of espresso, chocolate, and some toffee.  Maybe it was my bottle, but I felt like there was a little too much carbonation in the mouth feel. None the less the alcohol is beautifully hidden.  I definitely plan on picking up a few bottles to keep in the cellar - I think this will age quite nicely.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,bbothen,4.15,"12 oz bottle poured into a snifter. Bottle says ""best by 9/13/2012"". Hmm.  Pours a pitch, tar like black, no light coming through, with a small 1 finger deep thick tan colored head. Head quickly disappears into a small bubbly ring around the glass.  Aromas of sweet malts, toasted/roasted aromas, some coffee, faint smoke, and a nice fruity hoppiness coming through.  Taste is great. Toasted malts, nice hop bitterness, roasted coffee, cocao, plum, raisin, faint booze.  Full bodied, tad too much carbonation for me, still smooth and creamy.  Drinkability is good for %9 imperial stout. Could have 2-3 in a sitting.  I'm a fan of this one. Really like the flavor here. Will be seeking out again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Coffee, malty taste, some nuts. Some alcohol on the back of the palate. Hoppy bitterness present. Pretty easy to drink. More alcohol bite as it warms up, stronger coffee.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,goatgoat,3.68,"Pours a nearly impenetrable black. Garnet gets through the edges. A thick (3+ fingers) coffee head falls slowly leaving sticky lace along the top of the glass. Aroma is dark fruit and a big alcohol bite. Pretty good citrus and grapefruit coming through as well. It's a pretty fresh bottle. Taste is far more malty than the aroma. More dark fruits and chocolate leading to a bitter coffee finish. That sharp alcohol shows up again. Somewhat full bodied, but not as much as I expect.  I enjoy the base flavors more than most other RIS, but it's just too harsh right now. I can see why folks age this and I might try that.

Produces a brown head, which quickly dissapates leaving a little bit of lacing. No carbonation as far as I can tell.  Aroma is strong on roasted malts and bitter chocolate. There is also a small portion that reminds me of dark fruits, as well as molasses. I get a faint alcohol smell here as well.  Taste is largely what you would expect from the mouthfeel. I'm not trying to downplay the taste at all, it's very very good. A strong roasted character is about all I get at first. After it warms a bit I'm starting to get a more pronounced coffee flavor, as well as dark fruits. Leaves a slightly bitter aftertaste. To my unchallenged palate, this tastes similar to the other RIS's I've had.  Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. It's a little lighter bodied than I'd hoped, but thats a minor annoyance.  Another great offering by Victory. I'm very pleased with this. A sipper for sure, but a great one, none the less.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,drtth,4.6,"Slighly chilled and poured into Duvel glass. Glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically. Bottled 17 Aug 07 and consumed 3 March 09.  Appearance: Deep dark brown, almost black with half inch brown head that eventually fades away leaving behind some intricate lacing on the sides.  Smell: Initial impression of semi-sweet chocolate malt with traces of dark molasses but with no real hop presence.  Taste: Almost a burnt and semi-sweet dark chocolate flavor from the roasted malt. An undertone or hint of dark molasses but again no sign of hops, they have completely receded leaving the almost burnt flavor of the malt to carry through with the bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied with light carbonation and a medium long finish.  Drinkability: This is one of my favorite imperial stouts, possibly my favorite, and I could sip my way through more than one of these in an evening, but slowly.  This stout is more than one beer. When younger the hops dominate and as it ages they recede to be replaced by the bitterness of dark roasted malt and dark molasses flavors.

Smell is typically very heavy on roasted malts and chocolate, although this one reminds me a lot more of hot chocolate than anything else. A little coffee aftertaste.  Taste is of very dark chocolate and a little bit of coffee bitterness near the end. Very roasted flavor.  Mouthfeel is very interesting. I love the thickness initially, but the carbonation is pretty heavy after that, which is not my favorite.

345,1013,Phillyduke,3.85,"1-year old aged bottle from the 2007-2008 winter enjoyed on a snow day in my DFH snifter.  A: Pitch black and completely opaque. A 1+ finger head of mocha-colored foam caps the glass after a semi-vigorous pour, and quickly recedes to a fine surface layer. Alternating fine and rocky lacing rings the edge of the liquid. Not much cling. Some mild viscosity tints the glass brown as the liquid moves around the bowl.  S: Chocolate pokes through a heavy roasted malt nose. Notes of coffee and some faint hop character. Some sweetness (molasses, perhaps?) as well. A faint whiff of alcohol is noticeable as well, and becomes more so as the beer warms.  T/M: Smooth and creamy on the palate with a surprisingly prevalent hop character for a year-old stout. A bitter dark chocolatey/coffee character and a nice roastiness from the dark malt are the real stars here, though, with the taste alternating between the two. A subtle underlying sweetness provides a second layer of complexity, but there is some balance here. Finish is definitely on the bitter side and lingers for awhile. Alcohol is noticeable, but only just barely so. A bit on the lighter side body-wise for an RIS.  D/O: I wish I had reviewed a bottle last year when this was fresh, but if memory serves me this has definitely gotten better with age. Not as terribly rich and complex as some of the better RISs out there, but certainly a fine example of the style and one of the first to inspire a new generation of devotees. The smooth, creamy mouthfeel and pleasing flavors make this easy-to-drink stout a must-have every winter. Sipping on one of these is a perfect way to spend a snowy winter's evening. I have two more from this batch to try in '09-'10 and '10-'11.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,jim102864,4,On tap at Blind Tiger during my recent visit. Cask ale served in a mug. Dark black with a thin pond on the surface. Sort of a buttery nose. Some mild chocolate notes. Nice roast creates a coffee espresso flavor. I like the bitterness that prevails up front and lingers on the tongue with each pull. I only wish they'd serve this in a larger glass. Bitterness milds out somewhat as it warms. A nice brew.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,BigMike,4.45,"This is my go to stout. A very quality example from Victory. Pours very dark. Almost black with close to two fingers worth of tan head. Smells of espresso and chocolate with a suprising fruitiness to it. I find this complex for an RIS. Not only the presence of chocolate and coffee but also fruity, sweet and bitter at the same time. Mouthfeel is almost milkshake like. The over 9% ABV. is well hidden and this finishes quite smoothly. This is a must try.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Two finger chocolate brown head leaves sheets of lacing. Creamy, but doesn't retain well.  The nose is quite interesting. This is the hoppiest smelling stout I've come across. The nose has all of the typical RIS scents, like roasted black malts, dark chocolate, coffee, yet the commanding scent, to me, is citrus.  Wow. This is an unbelievable stout. It's got a body like a milkshake. Tons of chocolate and espresso, and then here come those hops. Citrus and pine in a rich, thick Russian Imperial Stout. Who knew?  The body is excellent. Rich and thick, full and creamy. Just amazing.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,solargoat,3.38,"Poured 12 oz single into a large snifter. Looks and smells good enough. Very dark, smells of malts and coffee. Taste is off for me, surprisingly bitter like old coffee.

345,1013,KBoudreau66,4.22,"Picked up a 12 oz. bottle and poured it into a point glass.  Pours black, but not motoroil black like some stouts with a short light brown head.  A ton of different smells going on in this brew. Burnt coffee, mocha, herbs, band-aid like smell, smells almost like my novolog insulin, a fruit, and a hop smell that I wasn't expecting, and alcohol.  Taste is similar to the smell. Tastes like coffee that's been on the burner for a little bit too long, dark chocolate, that herb like flavor comes through. There is a pleasant hop to it that is really good.  Mouthfeel is full bodied, but not as full bodied as some stouts. Lighter in texture then some.  Great offering by Victory. It's a very drinkable stout because of it's lighter texture. The alcohol is hidden well. Well balanced.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

It contains all the balance I'm looking for while still being able to bowl me over with flavor. It looks as delicious as it is with a dark opaque body topped with a thick gorgeous mocha head that sticks nicely to the walls of the pint glass. Smells and tastes of tons of chocolate and coffee with cream. Balanced awesomely with a good bitter finish as a great counterpoint to the malty backbone. Smooth and creamy without being flat, and hides almost 10% abv very well.

345,1013,jimj21,4.35,"Bottle poured into tulip glass. Pours a viscous dark brown/black with one finger of mocha head which fades fairly quickly. A bit of lacing. Hints of ruby near the edges.  I can smell hops, coffee, and chocolate. Pretty hoppy for the style, but that will likely fade with some age. As it warms, the hops fade a bit and the chocolate and coffee aromas come through more.  Taste is much like the smell. Tastes quite hoppy/citrusy, both in the start and the aftertaste. I can taste milk chocolate in the middle, and more bittersweet, dark chocolate on the finish. There are also some roasted coffee notes throughout.  Mouthfeel is fairly creamy. Carbonation is maybe slightly to high, but it doesn't detract. Full bodied and a little chewy, as well.  This one is very drinkable. At 9.1% abv, the alcohol is barely noticeable, save for some slight warming in the throat. I am going to see how the rest of the 6 pack tastes with some age on them. There are definitely a lot of hops for a stout, but then again, hops make things delicious.

Complex with tons of herbal, medicinal, and spicy flavors from the hops. Lots of coffee on the finish, bitter/smoky aftertaste. Not a whole lot of chocolate. Mouthfeel could have been better I thought-- it was lighter than expected, but still chewy. But the carbonation was perfect-- fine, subtle bubbles-. Very easy to drink for a heavy, alcoholic beer.

I've seen it a few times a while back on the shelves but always went for the hop devil or hop wallop but now am glad i've tasted this beer.  A dark, black beer with a brown tint and a lightly laced brown head that doesnt hold very long.  A mild hoppy aroma, almost a hint of rum. The alcohol really stands out in the smell making this hard for me to identify any fruits or malt that might be in the smell.  This is a good and heavy beer, very creamy with a pretty smooth mouthfeel, is a little heavy going down. Nice malty texture with some dark chocolate in there, nice coffee taste as well. There may be some berries of some sort, most other stouts i've had have contained more figs, plums and raisens but this has more of a berry taste which is a nice change and holds up well against the others.  So overall this is a great tasting stout with for a pallate for the sweets.

345,1013,thekevlarkid,4.12,"Finally, while wandering Maine, I came across some Victory product that for some reason never makes it to VT. So I bought a couple of these famous bad boys and dragged 'em home. Out of a bottle this RIS was a dark, dark brown color that approached but did not quite make it to opaque black. The one-finger head was mocha-colored, displayed decent retention and lacing that was quite good, starting in sheets at first that broke up as the sample continued. The aroma was of roasted malt, chocolate, brown sugar, a little dark fruit and coffee with cream. The flavors were not quite as sweet as the aroma, starting with roasted malt it then proceeded into chocolate malt, wood and a pleasant bitterness from the hops. The finish was lingering and coffee-like. It leaned more to the espresso-like side of the spectrum as far as RIS's go, compared to the more chocolaty side that Kate the Great or The Abyss leans towards. Still, the complexity of the malt was impressive and it was very well balanced by the acidity of the hops. It also hid its 9.1% marvelously well. The mouthfeel was smooth, the body full and the carbonation soft yet not understated thereby helping the body feel flush.

345,1013,BARFLYB,3.16,"12oz fresh bottle into a regular snifter. Best drank by October 2013.  A- Victory SKS pours dark deep black color with a dark tan almost brown two inch head. Within ten minutes it widles down to mearly nothing leaving nice lace stains. Some traces of brown are seen in the body upon closer inspection while some bubble action on the surface.  S- Out of the many stout's i've had over the years this one has the most hops in the nose hands down. The whole flower hops used dominate while a bit of roasted malt follows. A bit of chocolate is barely detectable. Coffee espresso notes also.  T- Storm Kings main focus is in the hops as the whole flower american hops are undeniable, but it's not what i'm looking for in my stouts unfortunatly. The bitterness is unappealing while the malts are present but fail to compliment the hops. The espresso like taste is pleasant & needed. Some chocolate is noted in the finish but barely makes a dent. A small amount of anise is there.  M- Storm king is very full bodied and robust with some bittering aspects in this fresh version that is somewhat overpowering. This has a dry aftertaste with the hops lingering a bit to long. Not as creamy as expected for a RIS. The acidic notes were also distracting.  D- With all the negatives i personally I got from this it's still a great winter brew to drink to warm up. And at 9.1% this will get the job done. This is just not as thick and cramy as I like with way to much hop focus. I will update with an aged bottle to see if things come together.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

T: rich (but not thick), complex, and quite bitter from both the hops and the dark elements. Again likely to be polarizing.  M: virtually no carbonation, dry finish.  D: very enjoyable specialty beer. But you can taste the ABV pretty easily.

A glowing bulb was not visible through the full glass. I loved the body, but the head was a bit light and sudsy and dissipated within a minute or two.  The smell is a strong whiff of dark sweets and smoky wood. I was instantly reminded of molasses and an almost pine-like wood smell, African Blackwood, for those that know the smell. Some thick fruit syrup, or dry fruit, apricot I think. The smell was exceptional, I was content just to smell the beer for some time, before even tasting.  The taste followed the smell, with more thick fruit molasses and syrup, very strong, offset with equally strong bitter malt and hops. Very pleasant and thick on the palate, almost oily, but this did mean the drinkability was low.

T: Pleasing espresso with dark chocolate notes, finishes clean with a hop bite. Hop bitterness lingers, but not uncomfortably.  M: Medium bodied imperial stout.  D: For me, very drinkable.

It looks like pouring syrup and chocolate into a glass with a mousse head. The head dissapears with in seconds though. Im finally appreciateing a good head...ON A BEER. Mind out of the gutter people.  The smell is aromatic, almost smells a bit like vodka to me. With a mix of maple and chocolate.  Taste is a bit harsh at first, but it mellows in your mouth. Definete taste of coffee, malt, chocolate(faint) and maple?...A very hoppy beer, but the other tastes tone it down after it hits the buds so its not super bitter. You know the hops are there, you think it should be bitter, the bitter hits you then fades into the backround. Either im improving my taste buds to like hoppier beers, or the hops fades away. Aftertaste is a definete coffe hops taste.  I love the mouthfeel of this beer, nice and thick but with no residue left behind like some other beers.

D - Very much so, the high alcohol content is masked well in the front, but comes out in the finish.  I did have another oak aged stout earlier in the night which blew me away, so perhaps this didn't get the proper attention I would give it if it was a start point.

There is a lot going on in here but I can pull out some sweet chocolate. There is a bitter finish which is actually pretty pleasant.  Mouthfeel: Not as heavy as a traditional Imperial Stout. Medium to heavy but pretty smooth.  Drinkability: No hints of alcohol here, the bitterness can wear on you after 2-3 of these but overall it is a pretty smooth Impy stout.

Pure black in color, virtually no lightening anywhere. The nose displays a measure of restraint and slowly offers up the milk chocolate, creamed coffee, toffee scents which are not keen on stealing the spotlight, allows the grape, plum, cherry fruit to step forward, same for the soda bread, barley and quieter orange peel accents. Full-bodied, close to heavy through the attack but sheds excess weight admirably as it moves forward. The carbonation level is high yet does not prevent the dark bitter chocolate, Vienna roast coffee bean, toffee and heavy cream from accreting. Adds in a spring water freshness and higher orange peel presence. The hops do not coalesce into distinct flavors but do add a general dryness and structure. High degree of drinkability.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

The taste of this brew is absolutely amazing now. The flavors mend together perfectly. What's cool too is the hoppy bitterness is still going strong and hasn't skipped a bit.

Alcohol come out as it warms  T: Citrusy bitter hops from start to finish. Its almost like an IPA with roasted malts. Definitely unique. Layers of coffee flavors covered by hops. A bit of age would really bring out the stout in this. Only a little alcohol presence. Almost candy like at times.  M: Smooth with a hoppy bite.  This beer is all about hops.

Chocolate, caramel, some ash, booze, brown sugar, and date all characterize the aroma. Caramel, chocolate, burnt malt, hints of citrussy hops all comprise the flavor, with a dry burnt astringency dominating the finish and aftertaste. Rich full mouth-feel with moderate carbonation. While this one is more of a sipper (as it should be), it goes down quite easily and quickly. In my opinion, the burnt character could afford to be scaled back a bit.

This beer is milky, chewy, but not overwhelming all at once. Fuller in body, medium carbonation, but overall very pleasant.

The nose is full of lightly roasted chocolate malts, very rich, yet balanced by a hefty amount of hops. The hops come off smelling grassy and floral. Slightly spicy hint of anise hidden beneath it all.  Very smooth feel with a warming presence. The bittersweet, roasted and at times acidic chocolate quickly gives way to a full hop experience. The hops come off floral and sharp in profile. Bitter dry finish.

Nose is creamy, burnt barrel and bakers chocolate that opens up into caramel, toasted malt, and brown sugar sweetness. Notes of pine appear as well.  Silky on the tongue. Initial taste is french roast mocha, roasted malt and cream. Mouth begins to dry and the hops say hello with a nice numbing effect. After taste is a wood-caramel with a mild alcohol burn down the throat. The mouthfeel finishes with an oily glaze; nice.  This goes down as one of my favorite RIS.

Awesome lacing throughout my glass. Great looking.  Smells of rich, chocolate roasted malts and sugar-coated raisins. Oh, very nice. Splashes of expresso, dark chocolate. Even a very tiny whiff of hops as well - slight citrus. Awesome.  Taste is totally not what I was expecting - good, however. The typical RIS flavors - the chocolate, maltiness, expresso - are backed by a wave of citrusy hops. Very different, and I'm not entirely sure if it's for the better or worse yet. There's also a pretty evident sense of warming alcohol that I didn't detect in the nose.  Mouthfeel is kind of light for this style, but I guess with the hops infusion it fits fairly well. Alcohol is definitely evident. Carbonation is on the higher end, as well. It's very creamy though, and it's a great and very unique and interesting sipper.  note: the hop presence, in my opinion, makes this brew very interesting and more enjoyable. Might just be the mood I'm in, but it's refreshing to have an RIS that isn't just heavily infused with coffee or chocolate.

Was poured from a cask into a nonic pint glass with a tan, finger-wide head that left sheets of lacing on the glass. Was served at room temp, which is warmer than I usually drink it. This accentuated the chocolate flavor and caused the roasted flavors to be more subdued. Chewy and thick mouthfeel with balanced carbonation was similar to bottle, and aroma was virtually the same although more pronounced (due to warmth?). Overall the drink was amazing.

Slight undertones of piney hops. Not as prominent as in the nose.  Smooth. A little weak, though, IMO. I like my Stouts, especially Imperials, to be quite abit thicker and full-bodied than this. Not near the level of creaminess that I would expect.  Yes, it's pretty drinkable. On the other hand, I think it's for a select group of people.

Aroma is really quite underwhelming. There's a lot of hops in it coming across as citrusy and piney. Besides that there's not much else besides a bit of a vinous quality.  Taste was similarly underwhelming beginning with a bit of chocolate tones in the beginning and the vinous tone coming in somewhere around the middle. The finish is very hoppy with a lingering coffee aftertaste, but it's not all that pleasant.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, nice soft feel that is just short of being creamy. A touch more carbonation and it would be ideal.  Not that great of an Imperial Stout, I'm surprised at the A rating.

345,1013,cdkrenz,4.39,"A - Intimidating dark brown and frothy head standing two inches tall. The body is thick with black. The lacing is very nice too.  S - Chocolate with a hint of coffee.  T - Long roasted malt revealing a chocolate flavor that is smooth and soft. There is also a hint of coffee outlining the cocoa taste. Both flavors lay on top of a feather-bed of malt.  M - This stout is the smoothest I've ever enjoyed. It walks its way through my mouth across my gum and tongue before strolling down my throat.  ~ If my memory serves me right, this is the best stout I have ever had. I am disappointed I have only one. I will certainly be on the look for this in the future.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,vitamaltz,3.93,"This bottle was cellared for about a year. There's nothing wrong with it now, but I'm going to let the remainder of the sixer chill out for a few more years and see what happens.  A- I can't ask for anything more from a RIS. It is as black as anything I've ever seen and pours with two fat fingers of rootbeer float-colored head. The persistent lacing is intact from the top to the bottom of my empty glass.  S- Much better than an average stout. I got hits of toffee, very roasted (but not burnt) barley, and alcohol. Some reviews have claimed they didn't smell any of that. The nose on the beer was strong until the head dissipated in about five minutes, after which I couldn't really smell anything.  T- Doesn't quite match the smell. The hoppiness is still prevalent and the alcohol slightly noticeable after a year. A deep cocoa undertone is there. I don't mean chocolate. This note is more like a bar of +85% cocoa than typical chocolate-mess. I think this is because the hops artificially create a bitter cocoa taste.  M- Hops and alcohol numbness stays with me after the swallow. It's medium-bodied, but in this case, that's not a bad thing.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Great mouthfeel...thick, viscous, but very light carbonation.  Bitter, kinda smoky, rich espresso at the back with...a hint of...cigar?

Smell is quite subdued, but I do get a hint of charcoal and slight alcohol whiff.  Taste starts off a sweet but the alcohol levels it out. It finishes off with a dark chocolate or mocha. Slightly chewy and goes down pretty easily for the ABV.

345,1013,StarlightSeraph,3.39,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter  Appearance: Very dark brown with a creamy light brown, two finger head. Very nice, and just how I would like a stout to look. A decent bit of the head lingered for most of the glass, with a high amount of lacing.  Smell: The alcohol is definitely evident in the aroma. Fruit seems to be the dominant aroma, but I can't place it exactly (maybe plums?). Hints of hops - must less than I expected, considering the taste.  Taste: Fruity, bitter, and sweet. A very nice hoppy kick in the aftertaste. Coffee also comes through. The taste doesn't linger nearly long enough, however. Despite smelling it, I don't taste any of the 9.1% ABV. Hops are the most prevalent flavor, and become more dominant as the beer warms. A tiny bit of the alcohol kick also comes through as the beer warms. Not very balanced.  Mouthfeel: Surprisingly thin. Highly carbonated, but a very thin mouthfeel.  Drinkability: Dangerously easy to drink, as the alcohol is masked very well. It did warm my stomach after awhile, even though it didn't come through in the taste. However, I was kind of disapointed by this. It has the hoppiness of an IPA, the color/alchohol content of an imperial stout...but doesn't really succeed at being either.  This was my first really 'hoppy' dark beer, so maybe I'm just not that in to the style - I would prefer either hoppy or dark, but not necessarily one at the same time.  For me, this was a case of looks being decieving. It poured beautifully, but that was the most enjoyable part of this beer. I doubt I would buy it again, but I wouldn't necessarily refuse it. It wasn't bad, but I guess it's just not a beer I prefer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Stickiest of sticky lacing, absolutely clings to the glass.  S: Dark roasted malts, bitter dark chocolate, citrus hops.  T: Initial hit of bitter chocolate malts leads to quite a blast of orange/citrus hops with a dark and dry malty finish. Not realy what I was expecting.  M: Thick and creamy. Quite a punch of hops make my tastebuds tingle. Quite dry.  D: Drinkability is ok. Very smooth, very little alcohol detected. I can see why many people prefer this one with some age on it.

Rush of sweetness then bitter on the back end. Some dark fruit notes. Roasted grain character carries throughout but it is very mellow considering the nose.  MF: Medium body moderate.

S: Roasted malt, citrus hops, chocolate, and a hint of pineapple. T: Citrus hops first pop out. Then chocolate roasted malt comes through after a few sips. Can barely tell that there is any alcohol in here...dangerous. The balance between the fruity citrus hops with sharp, crisp bite and the smooth tones of the roasted chocolate malt is exquisite. M: Very soft and smooth overall with some nice sharp bite from the hops. D: The definition of drinkability...and you don't find that most of the time from a strong russian imperial stout. These typically are sippers...this one doesn't have to be. In a blind tasting, I would guess it had half the alcohol content that it does.

It's got a great chocolatey finish and the alcohol is definitely there too, but not in a bothersome way.

S - clean, lots of citrus hoppiness, smooth chocolate roast, very inviting  T - lots of cocoa, burnt toffee, woody, not a lot of hop flavour, lingering bitterness, aftertaste is hops, roasted malt, and smooth alcohol...mmm good.  M - not overly heavy, medium body, very creamy, alcohol warmth is quite evident, but soothing like a warm blanket.  D - this is delicious and very well executed, the bold flavours and alcohol do slow you down, but that just gives you more time to savour this fine drink.  This is a bold RIS, but if you're into this sort of thing, you'll find it has an incredible smoothness that takes the edge off. Excellent use of American hops, with a great aroma and long lasting bitterness. The malt is quite roasty, but also manages to come across as smooth. I usually have no trouble hammering through 12ozs of 9.1% beer, but the Storm King forces you to take it slow (the only other RIS I can think of that matches this intensity, in fact exceeds it, is Bell's Expedition).

We have had a lot of success with Victory beers. The head slowly disappated, but it took a while and lace was left all over the sides of the glass.  The aroma was dark and smokey with a nice bit of toasted barley and chocolate malt. The color was black and smelled perfect for its look.  The chocolate malt really comes through while drinking this beer. The roasted dark malts really make a nice beer. A great example of Russian Imperial.  The beer is pretty heavy and thick while drinking. Very smooth and complex.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,hoplover82,4.53,"This substantial stout is very robust.  My first sense that got a kick was my sense of smell. I smelled a lot of heavenly hops coming from the bottle before I even poured the beer! I think I like it already. Plus a hint of darkly roasted barley.  Then I pour this amazing ale into my favorite beer drinking glass. It looks just like a good espresso.... but it's not, it's beer! I hold it up to the light... and nothing. I can't see anything. Dark black all the way through. A beautiful sight for sore eyes. The head is a dark brown sugar color, and it gives off a lot of hop aroma at first then that fades off to a strong barley aroma.  It tastes just like it smells. Great! The flavor of hops jumps out first, quickly followed by the onslaught of roasted malts, strong notes of coffee and molasses.  Despite all these onslaughts n' stuff, it's not overwhelming on the palate. It's smooth! Even at 9.1% abv it's not even harsh at all. Smooth on the way down, and it gives a nice warmth.  Very drinkable. But kinda pricy. My favorite from the Victory Brewings. The Lord bless the hop harvest.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,adamette,3.88,"Poured from a bottle with enjoy by date of Feb 13, 2013. Wow, 4 years and two months ahead of time! Poured into my Cooperstown Beverage trail clean, clear pint glass.  A Great looking dark black body, absolutely no light gets through even with direct light behind it. Head is light brown and great. It took two minutes to dissipate and had nice lacing after it did.  S Not an intense smell, a subtle dark malt smell with some alcohol. It has been my experience that Stouts do not have a strong smell. This one goes along with that trend. I might smell some nuttiness but the dark malt is mostly what I smell.  T Big stout taste of dark dark malt and bitterness (hops). This strikes me as a ""classic"" stout taste which is great since that is what it advertises to be. The taste was a bit more basic than I had expected after so much positive press.  M Despite the big tastes this beer thins out reasonably soon (10 seconds) in the mouthfeel. I don't get much carbonation in the feel despite its generous and lingering head. Overall the mouthfeel is huge though.  D Not great with high ABV, big, full taste and feel.  Notes: I had heard so many good things about Storm King prior to trying it tonight that I went into this review ready to be blown away. I was not blown away but I do think that it is a good to great stout. I think that I am spoiled since I had Old Rasputin on nitro tap recently. I will cellar the remaining 5 bottles that came in my sixer and then see if they improve with time.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Soneast,3.73,"Pours dark black with a thick, creamy, 3 finger, tan colored head. Good retention with some real nice lace on the glass. Good amounts of bubbles feeding the head.  A mild roasted malt aroma on the nose with some dark fruity esters that ends with a pretty strong spicy hoppiness. Some bitter dark chocolate as well.  An overall decent roasted malt, bitter coffee flavor with a hint of molasses, all this followed up by an almost citrus hop bitterness, that is actually quite a good balance to the up front sweetness. Leaves a fairly strong bitter chocolate taste on the palate.  Fairly thick, with a pretty minor carbonation factor. All in all not bad, the alcohol is well hidden, the flavors balanced and the price is right for a sixer of this. Granted there are better options in this style but for the price you can't go wrong.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,LilBeerDoctor,3.55,"Reviewed on 7/8/08. Bottle. Pours black with a small tan head that dissipates quickly. Aroma of roasted malt, bitter hops, and coffee. Flavor of weaker sweet roasted malts, bitter hops. The mouthfeel is nice and full and richens as the beer warms. The flavors are a bit weak for a top notch imperial stout. Rather bitter as well. The first time I had this beer I wasn't particularly impressed and the same holds true in this revist. It lacks the rich intensity of the great imperial stouts and reminds me of a regular stout with a full-bodied palate. Still a good beer to try, but it's nothing great.  Update 7/10/08: Had this beer again on gravity keg at Blind Tiger. The flavor is completely dominated by coffee and roasted malt. Very roasted. A little tastier than the bottled version, but there's still not a lot going on here.  8/4/6/4/15 (3.7/5)",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,yesyouam,4.28,"This beer is opaque black with a fluffy brown head. The head has some rainbow bubbles in it! The aroma is of dry dark roast-- french roast coffee and dark chocolate. There is also some bready grain and piny hops. The palate is full-bodied with a soft dry finish. The flavor is well-blended. The black coffee/dark chocolate flows right into the aggressive piny hops. It has a pretty long aftertaste that eventually ends up as dark chocolate. Wow. I want another one of these!

345,1013,MacDomer,4,"Picked this one up a few months ago while travelling for work. Shared a few with some coworkers at the time, but didn't get a chance to review it then. We have a big snowstorm rolling in tonight, so I figure it would be appropriate to open up my last Storm King.  A - Holy crap this guy develops huge head on a pretty soft pour. Like half the glass! After a minute or two it receeds. Pretty dark, not black, with some rocky light foam floating around for the entirety of the beer. There's some lacing, but nothing to write home about. Appears a bit thin on the swirl.  S - Not very strong here, but smells good. Notes of milk chocolate, light roast fresh brewed coffee, some dark fruits hiding out and finally a hint of citrus zest from the hops.  T - Not as rich as I remember, but quite tasty nonetheless. Upfront I get some chocolate malts, a bit of cafe au lait, some roastedness, followed by a grassy citrusy finish with some nice bitterness.  M - A little thin for the style. I'd call it medium bodied. I'm almost done with my beer and haven't noticed the carbonation much, but I'd say on the finish it is just shy of being agressive.  D - A good beer, for sure. I don't see it too frequently around in my local stores, and the RIS category has lot of really good alternatives, so I probably won't seek this out. Would be happy to drink one if I came across it again.  It's a bit of a different take on the style given the thin body and higher level of hopping - I can appreciate that and enjoy it for what it is.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,magictrokini,3.93,"When I picked this up, I was so happy this had finally made its way to San Diego. Pours opaque black with no head. Nose of baker's chocolate, raisins, and some roastiness. Mouthfeel is too watery for this style. Mostly roasted malt, alcohol, and hop flavors with some cocoa. The hops may have killed the chocolate or coffee I was hoping for.

Very thick with good retention from start to finish.  S-Fruity esters, mostly dark fruits. Some heavy roasty and chocolatey malts. A little bit of alcohol in the nose.  T-Roasted malts and bitter chocolates, over a smooth, light alcohol flavor which grew as the beer continued to warm. An assertive hop bitterness, also paired with a bitter black-coffee flavor. Some distinct hop flavors emerge near the end of the flavor, earthy and dank.  M-Some warmth materializes in my stomach after the first sip, letting me know that I'm drinking something strong. Appropriately low carbonation helps give this full-bodied beer a silky feel as it dances on my palate. Also a slight graininess is evident.  D-Very good beer, very good drinkability.

345,1013,PDXHops,3.09,"02/09/09. Editing my review as I seem to have unfairly reviewed a bad bottle originally.  A fairly vigorous pour into a brandy snifter produces a beautiful puffy 2-finger tan head. The beer itself is not opaque and almost black. Good lacing. Very nice looking in the glass. (2/9- nothing changed here- good looking brew).  Pretty straightforward nose- dark roasted malt, tiny bit of chocolate, bit of hops. Smells good, just not too exciting.  Flavor is also on the bland side. Dark malts accompanied by a bit of chocolate, a bit of coffee, a bit of hops.  Body is on the thinner side of medium, but the combination of creaminess and moderate carbonation hides it pretty well.  Smooth and about as sessionable as an RIS can be. Not sure if that's such a great thing, though, since there's none of the bold flavors I'm looking for in an RIS.  Overall impression: Very drinkable RIS at a good pricepoint, but lacking in the robust, bold qualities I'm looking for in a big stout.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

345,1013,Morbo,4.28,"Pours black with a thick mocha head that slowly reduces to a collar and leaves lacing all the way down the glass.  The nose is sweet and roasty, with chocolate and coffee fighting a strong herbaceous and floral hoppiness for dominance. A bit of alcohol just barely comes through.  Rich dark roast coffee and bittersweet chocolate are right upfront, with flavors of molasses, walnut, and oak soon following. The dry finish leaves woody/herbal hop bitterness lingering for quite a while.  It falls somewhere between medium and full bodied and is not very highly carbonated, which makes for a smooth and creamy mouthfeel  I wouldn't drink a six-pack in an evening, but the smooth mouthfeel does make this strong and flavorful beer easy to drink.

I couldn't drink many though due to the high ABV and the heartiness to it. As the brew warms a bit it mellows out to a nice chocolately flavor. Slight roasted bite at the end.

Aroma: Dark fruits and bitter coffee/espresso. The alcohol and hops aromas were present more than is typical for a stout, even an Imperial stout. Not particularly impressive.  Mouthfeel: More medium bodied than the full body I was expecting. It did have some creaminess, but the carbonation kind of overpowered the creaminess.  Taste: This is a dark fruits and bitter espresso stout. The alcohol taste was way too present for me and gives this thing a bite. I felt the overall flavor was way too bitter and not nearly balanced enough.  Overall impression: I have had this in the past and remembered it being a lot better. It's not BAD by any stretch, but it doesn't measure up to some of the best stouts I've had.  ETA: reading some other reviews, it looks as though this beer might have slipped in recent years.

Very little alcohol presence. Some lacing as it disappeared from the glass.  M - Less creamy than expected, probably due to recent tastings of nitro stouts and porters.

345,1013,GatorBeerNerd,4.28,"12 oz single purchased from Total Wine in Kennesaw, GA poured into a standard pint glass.  A: This is just about a picture perfect stout. It is a completely opaque black. It has a finger thick frothy brown head. The only reason I knock it down from a 5 is due to head retention not being excellent. The bubbles that do not dissipate leave sheets of lacing with each sip.  S: Roasted malts, hops, and a nutty aroma mix together to make this one pretty pleasing to the nose.  T: Roasted malt sweetness as you would expect from such a dark beer. It is balanced well with floral hops and dark chocolate flavors. This one is very balanced and tasty.  M: It is very creamy and smooth with a medium to thick body.  D: Most RIS beers are sippers for me. With the perfect balance and excellent taste I could easily drink a few of these. The alcohol is very well hidden.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Casey10,4.28,Very good Imperial stout. High alcohol content makes this a beer that you want to take your time with.  Smell is chocolate mixed with raison. Taste is heavy and strong. Not a bad beer and if a stout type beer is what you are looking for this is not a bad choice at all !!,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Gish,4.04,"Pours black with no head whatsoever which I thought was a bit odd. The smell is a deep rich chocolate with a strong undercurrent of spicy hops.  The taste certainly does not disappoint! Roasted malts with a slight sweetness blends into hop bitterness. Definitely a unique beer. There is a bit of warming alcohol at the end, but overall a very tasty RIS!  Mouthfeel is a bit too thick and syrupy for me, it seems to clog a bit in my throat. However, the carbonation is well balanced. Storm King is a bit more drinkable than any other Russian Imperial Stouts at this alcohol level.  Storm King is a bit of a strange beer. Very enticing in some aspects but it just doesn't blend into true greatness. To be honest it reminds me more of the Okocim Baltic Porter I had a few weeks ago then other Russian Imperial Stouts. Still worth a try, a nice hoppy RIS to have occasionally for sure!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,BierFan,3.55,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a tumbler glass.  Appearance: Very large(for the style) thick chocolate-milk colored head and a black body. The head drops kinda fast. Once the head disappears I'm able to see small bubbles erupting from the surface, so it has good carbonation.  Smell: Alcohol and roasted malts. Not as smooth as other RIS's I've had.  Taste: Roasted and burnt malts and some alcohol.  Mouthfeel: Mouthfeel is kinda thin, but I expected that with the poor head retention.  Overall this feels to me like it's more of a baltic porter than an RIS.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,superdedooperboy,4.1,"A freezing cold night brings out this 9.1% Imperial Stout.  Poured into a snifter glass, this one pours a deep dark nearly-opaque brown, setting off a great thick, creamy tan head. Retention is superb and lacing is decent.  Aroma is surprising -- instead of the expected roasty, chocolately malt notes, there is a big fruity/herbaceous hop bouquet, with more surprising notes of clovelike spiciness.  Body is medium-full, with a flavor that mimics the aroma to a certain extent, beginning with a roasted malt character up front with a faint suggestion of dark chocolate moving into a middle of mildly bitter hop flavors, finishing off with more sweet, chocolatey, roasted malts. Though high in ABV, the alcohol is very well-masked and never makes an overt appearance, even as the beer warms closer to room temperature.  The nice, balanced character of this stout, combined with its well-hidden alcohol, makes this a rather drinkable beer, but that can be a dangerous thing as the 9.1% will eventually kick hard, and drinking a few of these would certainly be a knockout.  Oh, but what a way to go.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,biegaman,4.37,"Enjoy by date of January 24, 2012. Sampled November 2008.  A sooty, lusterless black that gives into light only around its edges which brighten to a roasted chestnut. It is largely opaque, minus that top part of its trim. You might not notice those light tones, however, due to the thick sepia stained crown which it adorns.  Judging by smell, I would guess the brewing process went something as follows: the barley was first heavily roasted, just shy of the point of singeing. Boiled until it became as sweet as possible, the malt was then basted with hot fudge, smeared with scorched caramel, tossed with dark berries, sprinkled with hops and finally mixed into a pot of strong java.  Taste and mouthfeel are both exceptionally mellow considering the character of their contents - one might imagine these flavours of dark caramel, bittersweet cocoa, black licorice, and roast espresso to lean to the intense side but they are actually quite delicate. What adds more soothing sensation are generous notes of hop cones and a savory hint of dark currants.  Roast, bitterness, and alcohol are all curiously smooth at first, but do enhance throughout the tasting. I definitely enjoy the beer better with a couple more degrees of warmth into it; the alcohol and flavours both gain a little more body. It drinks near sessionably. This isn't overly rich for a RIS, but it doesn't leave too much more to be desired either.  When I first tried Victory's Storm King Stout I thought I had found the best stout ever (which I'd wager is a fairly common reaction). Although I would continue to consider it so for some time after, I've long since found other stouts to better fulfill my need for indulgence. I doubt there's room anymore for it in the highly competitive group of favourite Imperial Stouts.  That said, there will always be room for it in the cold cellar where it certainly earns a spot. There will also always be a found memory of the first time I tried this beer, which I had saved for the first true snow storm of the year, after spending a cold day walking through my city, smothered in white mist and slowly then sipping it while watching the white flakes fall outside.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,antilogic,3.98,"Aged several months in my cellar, this beer pours asphalt black with an impressive tan head. The aroma was inviting and smelled of a little hops and a little nuts and biscuit. The taste was crisp, but surprisingly bitter with some citrus and a kick of hops, and not overly sweet.

The scent is of coffee/espresso and roasted malts aroma. The taste has roasted malts, dark chocolate and gives a very chocolaty and expresso like impression. Good bitterness at the tail end, and some slight acidity. The alcohol is apparent but not overwhelming.

Aroma, this is good nice roasted and chocolate malt aroma's which are par for the style, nice floral and citrus aroma hops come through well. Taste goes down to an average RIS for me, much of the same roasted malts and a touch of chocolate. Hops are mostly floral with a hint of orange peel. Mouthfeel is full, but not oily which is the way I like an RIS.

S- Very nice dark sweet chocolate, graininess, cocoa notes, graham cracker, sweet cream, balanced hopiness. I'd recommend a snifter for this one. When your nose isn't right on the beer, the nose is quite tight.  T- Starts out with notes a light chocolate and coffee, some earthiness, and plenty of hop oil notes. The finish is mainly hoppy notes with a bit of residual dry chocolate. Alcohol can be felt on the finish.  M- For this much alcohol I would have like quite a bit more body. Low carbonation.

345,1013,Finkel,2.69,"It pours very nicely and is an attractive looking beer. The beer is onyx in color and is topped with a chunky, milk chocolate colored head. Lace surrounds the glace when swirled and retains nicely. Although I am not a stout guy myself, I have to admit that it looked very pretty.  The nose was much weaker than I thought it would be. Chocolate and toffee as well as a fair amount of hops were identifiable, but were not powering in any way.  The taste was a crescendo of flavor and grew progressively stronger as it went down. Hops were definitely noticeable as well as a burnt popcorn flavors at the end of each sip. The strong coffee aftertaste is gross to me, which is the reason why I'm a tea drinker.  The mouth feel was clearly thick, which is one characteristic of stouts that deters me from drinking them. Furthermore, I disliked that it was astringent - it made me feel slightly dehydrated.  Admittedly, I didn't finish the beer, which was only delight to my friend. My rating will definitely be skewed due to the fact that I'm not a fan of this style.

Heavy funk that was very off-putting.  Taste was big on the warm alcohol, with the roast and chocolate holding their own. The bleu funkiness was only mildly detectable on the tongue, but the aroma spoils at the start and finish of each sip.  Chewy mouthfeel, not very creamy.

Something that I will have again and again. I did enjoy this beer much more the warmer it got. Became more enjoyable as it approached room temperature. That is not saying much since it is 25 F on October 27 in Southern Minnesota at the time of this review. One thing that this Imperial Stout has going for it is the alcohol is not present in the taste at all. Very well hidden. I did like this quality.  Sip time....excuse me for a few seconds...  Ok. Back to the review.  Yes, it definitely gets better the warmer it gets. I am now going back and changing my taste to 4.5 on the BA scale. Much better. I wonder if I could speed the process up using the microwave....just kidding other BA members. I would never harm this beer.  Mouthfeel is excellent. Very thick like a good stout should be.

T- As expected from the smell, burnt coffee/espresso, and vague hints molasses, alcohol, and a tiny citrusy bite. Sweetness is fleeting and subdued. Not bad, but not really grabbing my attention either.  M- Carbonation bubbles are tiny and plentiful. Reasonably smooth.  D- OK.

Aroma has wet cardboard, stinging hops, and roasted malts. Bland chocolate and musty dark fruits in the nose as well. Taste begins with strong roasted coffee beans and cocoa powder followed by molasses and caramel. Booze and sappy hops midway with a dry spicy wood finish on the tongue.

The malt balances well with the burnt coffee/toffee flavoring rather than the coffee overpowering the balance as I thought upon smelling. Has a definite hop bitterness that enhances the flavor rather than detracting from the balance and drinkability. Chocolate is hinted at but doesn't come right out, it's a layer below the toffee flavor. This is a pretty easy drink for this kind of beer, all things considered. A pretty smooth yet full mouthfeel.

345,1013,djeucalyptus,3.78,"a. 12oz bottle with an average pour yielded a very billowy two+ finger head of a creamy mocha color sitting atop a very dark and murky near black with only the slightest hint of amber and ruby at the edges. The head partially deflated leaving some heavy lacing around the top, which failed to follow the remaining ring of foam (with some definite staying power) down the glass as cleanly as I'd hoped.  s. not bad, but I was hoping for a bit more. Malt with some definite cocoa undertones, and hints of coffee. I kept waiting or the aroma to pick up as it warmed, but I only got a bit more of the cocoa along with some figs and sour cherries. The roastiness also got a bit more intense, but nowhere near what I'd like given the darkness.  t. Roasted malt initially, with some strong, almost sweet hops following closely. Subtle hints of coffee with a more pronounced cocoa bittersweetness through the middle. Unexpected notes of sandalwood and oak chips played into it nicely, with a finish of hops, figs, raisin, and just a hint of the 9% abv peeking through.  m. Mouthfeel is confusing and intense. Carbonation of fine bubbles thins out the chewy and syrupy qualities fairly nicely. There's a bit if a bizarre hoppy, almost chemical bitter numbness on the sides of my tongue - not necessarily bad, but fairly unique.  d. A pleasant drink that hides the abv well. There are a few funky and undefinable flavors playing in there, which is nice, but when I open an Imperial Stout, I'm hoping for something strong and mindblowing. Unfortunately, this didn't really provide me with either. It's a solid stout, and a good introduction to imperial stouts, but I honestly don't really have a burning desire to have another anytime soon. Not really one I feel the need to write home about.

This reeks of fresh hops and it's interesting because I had one a few weeks ago and really enjoyed it. Don't get me wrong - still a good stout but definitely too much hops for my taste and for the style in my opinion.  A: dark with little light penetration. Fairly sudsy head throughout drinking - looked very 'fresh'. S: quite hoppy for an imperial stout, with chocolate, coffee, walnuts and cake undertones T: again hops in the beginning with undertones of mocha, chocolate and then a strong hop finish - slightly bitter. M: decent texture but a little on the light side. D: fairly drinkable if you are into fresh hop beer - myself, I would limit to 1 maybe two if I had some accompanying snacks to cleans my palate.  Like I had mentioned before - having this after the aged Java Stout definitely reduced my impression of the Storm King Stout.

S - Big coffee overtones with chocolate malt hints  T - Roasted coffee malts up front followed by smokey and hints.. and what... what's this.. hops? yes a slight surprising hop finish. Unique.  M - Thick body coats the palate well and leaves a coffee after taste.

345,1013,itcomesnpints,4.67,"I finally got to try this one, and it was better than I expected. I never truly enjoyed a RIS until Storm King came along.  The pour is a dark vacuum with a feisty tan head that quickly dissipates. Lacing is minimal. Right out of the fridge the aroma is mostly refreshing hop bitterness, but as it warms, the smell consists more of roasted coffee and dark chocolate. The taste is simply perfect. Deep roasted coffee and chocolate, followed with a crisp bitter hop aftertaste. A full-bodied brew that feels just right. Storm King Stout easily deserves all the hype.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Good size fluffy, bubbly head that laces the sides on its way down. Aroma is hoppier than I expected, but its nice. There's also some roast and chocolate and some alcohol in the smell as well. Taste is bitter roast, a hop bite, and more chocolates and cocoa. A bit boozy and finishes dry. Medium body, ample carbonation. Nice Nice stout.

345,1013,oriolesfan4,4.62,"A damn good russian imperial stout. Not much to say about it then to say it's almost perfect. From a beautiful black with a tan head appearance, a very aromatic nose, and full of flavor to the smoothness and balance of the beer overall. It's a great beer and I'll be warming myself up in the cold winter months with this stuff.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Seanibus,4.33,"A delicious, smooth Imperial Stout.  Pours black with a thin but frothy off-colored head. The smell is strongly roasted malt, with hints of chocolate and a little nuttiness. The flavor is smooth, strong, chocolate and nutty, with a little woody character and a good bite of alcohol. The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth and viscous, with a sting of carbonation that highlights the smoky, roasted malt character of the beer.  Incredibly drinkable, but be careful - this beer is so smooth that it can fool you into drinking more, despite the 9 percent ABV",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,maddogruss,4.13,"Got a pint of this on cask at the brewery.  A: Pours a dark brown body with a thick, tan head with excellent retention and excellent lacing along the sides of the glass all the way to the finish.  S: A sweet, malt smell with some roasted notes and some alcoholic undertones.  T: A robust, roasted taste with a smooth and slightly earthy aftertaste. A hint of sweetness to it, but not much. A nice tasting beer.  M: A very smooth and full-bodied mouthfeel that was very good.  D: Definitely a very drinkable beer. Excellent combination of mouthfeel and taste. An excellent stout overall.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,BamaBeerBuff,3.73,"A: It's black with some ruby on the edges. Head is stiff and rather sizable with a milk chocolate color. Some decent lacing, but the appearance isn't as great as some other beers in the style.  S: Honestly, I'm not that blown away. There's a good bit of dark chocolate mixed in with some hops, but I find the complexity and boldness a bit lacking. Still a decent aroma, but not what I'd expect from such a highly regarded RIS.  T&M: Rather hoppy in taste, as well. Hops mainly make their entrance in the latter part and finish, which I don't mind as much, but there's a real dearth of flavor in the front end of the beer. Some dark malt, but no real explosive flavor or complexity. Another let down. The body is rather full, but not as creamy, oily, and heavy as I'd expect.  D: Well, it goes down easy because of the lack of flavor. When I drink a Russian Imperial Stout, I want it to be big, bold, and something to sip on. This one is more like a ""stout-plus"" than a true RIS.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,DeepSix,4.05,"Black. Poured with a dark brown head, about half finger thick. Not much lacing here.  The smell was the usual for Imperial Stouts coffee and chocolate malts.  The taste continues the same as the smell, sometimes these stouts all taste alike...I'll have to get a couple different bottles of em next to each other and drink them back to back to really be able to tell the difference. I'm not saying that's bad, I just wish I could say off the bat ""that's this one!"" But as of now I can't. But shit, they're all good. Thick in the mouth, with the taste of chocolate staying on the palate. The alcohol not so noticeable in here, surprising given the ABV.

Very dark black with a thick tan head. Nothing you wouldn't expect from this beer. Smell... Some chocolate, a hint of coffee, and very faint burnt toast come to mind. Right on in terms of what you expect from this style. Taste follows the smell -- all of the above aromas are present, and there is a nice alcohol warming as it goes down. Not outrageous and overpowering, but you are immediately aware you're drinking a big beer. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, definitely better as it warms up a bit. Drinkability suffers in my opinion due to both the 9% abv, but also the relative thickness of the thing. Not surprising, and not the kind of brew you'll want to drink more than a couple or three of anyway.

345,1013,beachbum1975,4.11,"To celebrate the change of seasons (first day I wore a long sleeved shirt to work this summer/fall), I decided to try a big stout.  I tried this one on tap at Fox & the Hound a few months ago and really enjoyed it. I saw it in a single 12 ounce bottle format at Jungle Jim's, so I grabbed one. Bottle states ""Enjoy by Feb 13 13"", so I guess I am drinking a pretty fresh one. I left it outside my beer fridge to warm up for about 30 minuntess before cracking...  A: Pours the expected dark, rich brown almost black with a dark tan to almost true brown big, bubbling ½ inch head. I can't see anything but brown highlight around the edges of the glass when I study it under the light. Great big and thick lacing patches the walls of my pint glass as it settles.  S: The nose was a little lighter than I expected. Rather than a burst of aromas, I got mild-to-moderate hints of heavily roasted coffee and floral hops and maybe some caramel. Nonetheless, the aroma was very nice and inviting over.  T: Wow, now that's what I was expecting. What was mildly lacking in the nose came through on the mouth. A big, bold blast of carbonation and coffee hit my tongue following by smoke and heavily roasted malts. The drink finished with a pleasing bitterness (but not over-powering) provided from the floral hops. This one definitely hides the 9% ABV very well. No real taste of alcohol until the finishing of the pint.  M: Highly carbonated, medium bodied and full flavored.  Crap - if I had planned better, this beer would have been perfect outside with a fire in my chiminea!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Serendipity is more like it.  Dark black with two-fingers of dark brown head. Good head retention and lacing. Chocolate and toast aroma with subtle hoppiness. Perfectly balanced malt/bitter flavor with some mocha notes and slight fruitiness in background. Creamy mouthfeel with some small bite. Pleasant mild alcohol burn. Exceptionally drinkable.

Some burnt flavors and a malty sweetness wrapped in coffee. Slight hop bitterness.  D: Pretty good. Not the most amazing RIS, but very worthy and drinkable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,ncvbc,4.33,"A beautiful creamy tan head that fades very slowly to a ring, leaving sticky lacing that clings to the glass throughout. The nose is enormous on the hops, even up front. It masks the malt just a bit much but still adds another level to it. There is some chocolate and a dose of coffee along with the peppery citrus hop character. Taste is of bittersweet chocolate, cooca, a touch of toasted caramel and coffee. A light nutty flavor as well. All of this is complimented by a spicy hop character that adds a certain bitterness to the finish. Very nice. Extremely creamy mouthfeel that is silky as can be on the tongue and going down, despite the big hop presence which does give it a slight bittering dryness in the finish, also keeping the brew from being too full. I get hop burps like crazy from this brew. This is in the black IPA territory almost. Certainly not overwhelming in terms of hops but moreso than other RIS tend to have. It does detract a bit from how drinkable this one is. If there had been a bit more malt and a little less hop I'd boost it a notch. All in all, an interesting experience and I found some differences in this and the bottled version. The hops were definitely more raw and gritty here...I'm a hop head, though, so I won't complain.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

S- intense smokey, coffee, and dark berries, cocoa, and what seem to be cascade hops. sweet caramel and floral notes come out along with the bitter burnt aroma and creamy chocolate mousse. blackberry, blueberry, currant, milk chocolate, anise, mocha, pipe tobacco, charcoal, with an underlying confectionery sweetness.  T- massive on the palate, fuel and solvent give way to burnt grains and deeply roasted espresso. alcohol is persistent throughout. bitter cocoa and burnt grapefruit hops also play major roles, as this things seems to have 5 levels of bitterness. a subtle dark berry fruitiness holds on quietly to the coat tail of roasted burnt and toasty malt and alcohol esters. each swig nearly sends a shiver down my spine like taking a shot of espresso followed by a shot of vodka followed by a shot of hop oil. what a combo. beat that, jager bomb. some instances of licorice and tobacco here and there, but mostly like liquified burnt wood with an herbal extremely hoppy finish. and i mean that in a good way.

The head was nearly vacant but surprisingly light in color; this effect made a nice color contrast, forming a halo around the brim of the glass with little hurricane swirls in the middle.  I was surprised that the first smell from the bottle was hops. Later smells from the glass revealed the characteristic toasted malt flavors.  The taste is more toasted malt but very crisp and direct. Sourness is there, but I was pleasantly surprised by a hint of pine and a slight astringent bitterness; from smell to taste, hops played a great role here.

A - Black body with chestnut highlights and two fingers of dense, creamy mocha-colored head that settled into a quarter inch of retention and left thick, ornate lacing all around the glass.  S - Dark roasted malt goodness abounds with some apparent chocolate/cocoa notes as well. Only a hint of alcohol at first, despite the high ABV. However, the alcohol really opens up as the liquid approached room temperature. Some earthy hops provide a nice contrast to the general sweetness of the aroma.  T - Dark bitter chocolate and earthy hops dominate the flavor profile in this RIS, with the dark roasted malt character also competing for the spotlight. A mild coffee aspect also emerges with a touch of black licorice to spice things up a bit. Finish is quite earthy and bitter.  M - Full bodied, rich and luscious texture that is extremely smooth and silky. Mouthfeel is absolutely heavenly. Finish is bold and bitter on the tongue. Outstanding mouthfeel!

M - This is where it lacks, ideally I was looking for more body. Overall it was too thin for me.  D - Because of the lack of body, I kick the drinkability up a notch, though with the 9% tag its difficult to judge. Ah the hell with it, give me another, its good enough.  edit: also, one thing I noticed is that after months of having this beer, there is nothing left in the bottom of the bottle after opening.

Some fusels are present which really ruin things. Finish is long, bitter and burnt.

Essentially black against the strongest light I could find in the establishment, this beer has a one-finger tan head that quickly disappears into nice lacing.  Aroma is boozy and marked by a sweet cherry character. Dark roasted malts present in nose as well.  Thick as it enters the mouth: just short of silky. Flavor is bitter, over-roasted malts with some sweetness for balance. Some coffee and chocolate notes. Fairly straightforward. Some alcohol character on finish.

Smell: Dark chocolate, sweet cream, caramel, oatmeal maybe?, vanilla, and some hop bitterness. A touch of alcohol at the end as well. Not overpowering, but surely inviting.  Taste: Semi-sweet chocolate and mocha are the first things that come to mind. Burnt malts, oak, vanilla, and charcoal with a good dosage of hops. First bottle tasted and smelled sweeter than the second.  Mouthfeel: Very milky feel with pretty high carbonation. Good amount of mouth-numbing going on. Full-bodied yet smooth, especially for an R.I.S. Wish the carbonation were a bit lower though.  Drinkability: A really smooth Russian Imperial with a nice (yet not outstanding flavor). This isn't my favorite R.I.S. by a long shot, however I would say that it's easier to drink than most beers of this style.

Taste follows suit, but bittersweet dark chocolate prevails, while the coffee notes are more subdued. Mouthfeel is quite pleasant-- chewey thick, and smooth going down.  Though the alcohol is masked fairly well, there's a satisfying warmth that permeates once the glass has been set down.  Subsequent sips offer greater enjoyment as the beer warms.

The malts are perfumed with spicy alcohol combined with a very interesting cinnamon tone reminiscent of Churros. Hops are quite fruity, grapefruity to be precise, though the bright citric quality also calls to mind limes. The sweet-spicy-booziness of it all reminds me of brandy or port.  Taste: Mmm... loads of coffee and chocolate, plus a lovely smoky/burnt flavor. Not as fruity as I anticipated, just supremely rich and dark. Molasses, honey, and prunes round out the sweetness, while mellow alcohol (with a whiskey-like burn) and pithy, zesty hops fence everything in.

Flavors of roasted coffee and dark chocolate fade to a pleasantly bitter finish that's moderately dry and warming.  M- The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with lively carbonation, slightly coating the inside of the mouth. Just a tad thin for the style.  D- This is one of the easier drinking imperial stouts that I've had. The 9.1% ABV isn't exactly well-hidden, but it doesn't detract from the drinkability.

345,1013,JBuff41413,4.42,"This beer was highly recommended by a friend so I had to pick up a 6 pack.  A- Oil spill in a glass with a small head.  S- Coffee, slight chocolate scent  T- Coffee, Bittersweet chocolate and roasted malts  M- Medium to medium-heavy mouthfeel, VERY creamy  D- With over 9% ABV I could not find the alcohol. Very drinkable.  Great RI Stout, definitely worth a try",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,RixBeer,3.85,Pours a nasty oily black with a creamy caramel colored 1 finger head.  Smells of robust dark malts and espresso as the prominent aromas. There is also a nice rummy alcohol in there.  This beer has a nice bitter taste with a smooth lingering plum and raisin aftertaste.  This is a very smooth and easy to drink beer.  Yeah 3 is good. 4 is better. 5 is gonna hurt. 6 will tuck me in for a good long nap.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,InsolublePancake,4.38,"I've seen this on cask several times at the Capital Ale House and finally decided to give it a try today.  A- Very dark with a big tan head that takes its time going down. Copious lacing adorns the sides of the glass as the head recedes.  S- Big chocolaty and roasty malt character in the nose with a nice pine sap edge.  T- More roasted malt goodness, with a flavor reminiscent of chocolate cake and coffee, along with hints of black strap molasses. Oh, and of course there's that nice piney bitterness in there as well. There's quite a bit of bitterness on the finish, but it's not overwhelming and it helps to balance out the huge malt profile.  M- Full-bodied and very smooth, almost creamy, thanks to the cask conditioning.  D- Very good considering what a big beer it is. The alcohol is noticeable, but not overly so. Plus, its smoothness makes it glide effortlessly down the throat. It's not one to chug, of course, but it's extremely drinkable for the style. I downed it much quicker than I do most Imperial Stouts.  This happened to be my first experience both with Storm King and with cask conditioning. Needless to say, I was impressed by both. This was an extremely tasty Imperial Stout, and I believe the cask conditioning did great things for its mouthfeel and drinkability. If you happen to see this offered on cask somewhere, don't hesitate to try it. Highly recommended.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

The main flavour in this imperial stout is the coffee notes, followed by a nice bitterness.The coffee hints and bitterness from the hops make an interesting mixture. Nice thick mouthfeel, a bit too carbonated, and incredibly drinkable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Very dark with light mocha big bubbled head. Fair retention.  Smells of coffe. Persistent yet not overpowering. Scent of alcohol.  Taste of coffee and surprisingly some hop bitterness. After warming a bit, the alcohol becomes more pronounced. I dare say black licorice.  Nice medium body, creamy,  So it's a fairly nice brew. I think Stone IRS may have ruined any other stout for me.

Smells strongly of milk chocolate and dark malt. Dark fruits and some brown sugar. Dark chocolate in the taste, with heavy toasted malt. The sweetness that's present is overshadowed by fairly strong bitterness. Very slight alcohol taste with a warming sensation at the end. Still surprisingly hot for the age.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,CrellMoset,3.96,"Casked at the Innsbrook Capital Ale House. Served in a traditional pint glass.  Appearance: Deep, deep brown with a great big, even, solid, foamy chocolate head. Leaves huge sheets of solid lacing. The cask effect really makes this one look great.  Aroma: Light and earthy, mild even. Dirty, grassy coffee, faint lemon, some caramel and toffee.  Taste: Great toasted malt foundation here - equal parts lightly roasted coffee and milky but not overly sweet chocolate. Some smoky sweetness and milky cream, faint dark fruit notes - currants, perhaps, and raisins - light hop spiciness and bitterness with hints of muted orange and leafy tobacco, only the faintest hint of alcohol. A really light RIS.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and very full, immaculately creamy. Very chocolate milkshake-esque.  Drinkability: As I said above, a very light RIS, so a very drinkable one. At the same time, the lightness makes it not as tasty as many examples of the style, but it's still damn good. Not sure how much the casking did for the appearance and the mouthfeel, but I've had this one before from the bottle and still enjoyed it. Recommended as a light, easy-going RIS.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

A light pour produces a deep black thick looking beer with a one finger tan head that leaves some good lacing but dissipates to a small ring of head with a central tan island floating in the middle.  Smells are bittersweet chocolate morsels, charred bread, and molases. The taste mirrors the smell with waves of maltiness balanced by a good hop flavor that adds to the roastiness and sticks around on the tongue for quite a while. The mouthfeel is moderately thick with light carbonation. A good amount of mouth coating occurs as well.  I got lucky and found this bottle on sale for $1.

App: Black and dark, 1/2"" head, tan/caramel color, light lacing, esp for a RIS  Aroma: Roasted malt, coffee, slight hint of alcohol  Mouth: Med heavy body and sits full on the tongue  Taste: Good! Nice roasted coffee flavor but no real alcohol flavor that you get from many RIS.  I think if this beer were served warmer, the flavors would be far more pronounced, esp the alochol and chocolate, which I really like in a RIS.

345,1013,Ben4881,4.25,"Storm King Stout Victory Brewing Company  Thank you to drxandy, another quality brew through trade.  Appearance: The Storm King has an opaque black color, looks very thick and very dark. A small tan head with decent retention emerges then slowly fades to leave a few snowflake patterns on the surface. The king leaves spotty lacing all the way down the glass.  Smell: The first aroma that slides through the nose is high in malt character an smells of sweet, toasty, roasted nuts. As the fragrance passes, slight alcohol notes are present and somewhat sour smelling.  Taste: A deep, bitter dark chocolate flavor hits the palette up front accompanied by a sweet caramel malt flavor. The finish is contrastingly dry, but consistently bitter. The finish has the big and bold flavor of roasted espresso beans. The brewers did a great job masking the alcohol flavor. The aftertaste is mildly bitter, with a hint of piney hops.  Mouthfeel: A thick heavy body accompanied by a decent amount of carbonation keeps it from being too heavy. Overall, the body is heavy to medium. A nice warming sensation at the back of the throat accompanies each delightful sip.  Drinkability: The well balanced, big and bold flavor makes this beer a worthy sipper. The thickness and heavy body hinder its long term drinkability and restrict it to a delicious sipper.

345,1013,BrewerB,3.49,"Thanks to tpd975 for the hookup!  This beer poured a deep black color with a 1/2 finger, tight, medium-tan head. Some reddish highlights when illuminated, it left a pleasant lacing when swirled in my half-pint glass.  Aroma included plum-like esters, deep roasted grains that focused on dark chocolate and espresso. Mildly nutty with a lower-than-expected amount of floral hops. Missing some oxidation/sherry like qualities that I find pleasing in other examples of the style.  Flavors of burnt malt, coffee/espresso, and chocolate. Bitterness was moderately-high and lingered on into a dry finish. An unwelcome level of astringency is present and lasted into the finish. Needed to have a second beer to clear that up. Malts are overly focused on the burnt character. Harshness from the dark malt and dry finish really detracted from what is typically one of my favorite styles. Missing out on some counterpointed sweetness.  Medium-full bodied, moderately carbonated. The astringency from the dark malts was a detractor.  Overall, the harshness from the dark malt astringency and dry finish combined to drive down the drinkability on this beer. Lacked some residual sweetness that would have helped. Oxidation could have brought in some sherry-like qualities to increase complexity. Missing the dark-fruit type flavors I find in other examples of the style. Clean fermentation, appropriate level of bitterness and coffee-chocolate character. It just lacks the drinkability of an Old Rasputin, Black Chocolate Stout (Brooklyn), Expedition Stout, etc. One of the rare times I'm hesitant to finish even a modest 12 ounce serving.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,OlieIPA,3.67,"This beer pours a huge head (be aware) and embodies the rich dark appearance that most imperial stouts encompass. The smell & taste exhibits chocolate and coffee malts. The mouthfeel was okay along with its drinkability.  The only problem I had with this beer was the extreme bitterness I encountered. I wasn't expecting it at all. My suggestion is to wait until this stout (along with most stouts) is a little colder than room temperature (55-60 degree F) before tasting it. If you follow this, the overwhelming bitterness seems to calm down a bit.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

It pours a thick dark brown almost black color that is impenetrable to light. The head is just grand. It pours a really thick, creamy, foamy dark brown head that is luscious. The beer laces and retains quite well. This is a pretty full bodied beer and is almost a meal in itself.  The aroma is pretty mild considering. It has a bit of a milk shake aroma, some oily hop in the background, some metallics, and some grainy caramels are also present. Then we get to the taste. Wow. This beer is making a definite statement, and is probably the most hopped up stout you'll find. There is a tinge of metallic in the taste and for that I kept it out of the 5 range, but for everything else, it is just a delight. The beer has a nice charred cherry flavor, some burnt molasses notes, definitely oily and estery hop, some roasted malts, and some sweetish fruitiness hidden underneath. This is a complex beer with a high ABV that is well hidden.  The mouthfeel is oily and full bodied; the aftertaste is a bit charcoal remnant, a dark toasted malts, and some lingering alcohol.

The aroma is a little subdued compared to most Imperial Stouts. It is rich and thick with a very straight forward malt characteristic, not very complex but I like it. As I sip on this marvelous stout it's full bodied flavor starts to impress my senses. The malts are roasted beyond reason and this leads way to a wonderful flavor that is unlike any other Stout that I have sampled. Tremendously smooth on the palate, this strong dark beer is easily consumed. The alcohol is hidden extremely well. Good seasonal brew, great Imperial Stout. 5/13/06 well I had the last one from my cellar and I have to add that this is the most hopped Imperial Stout I have ever had, that's what makes this one special.

I think I'm tired. The smell is, honestly, a little off-putting, sharp & acrid & faintly bitter.  Goes down with a dash of coffee & malts. Not much else. The smell is toned down in the mouth, but there's still a faint burnt coffee roaster smell; not the clean coffee taste I prefer, but with a bitter edge to it.  Mouthfeel is OK. I prefer my RIS to be silky smooth, with the cut of alcohol slithering down into my tummy. This one is much more aggressive, almost slick, nothing subtle, & little depth/complexity.

345,1013,beachian,4.1,"Hooray for my first review!  Ordered this in a bottle. I knew it was an Imperial so I was a bit prepared going into it but I had not had an Imperial before. The beer was poured into typical restaurant glass so there wasn't much going on there. It poured a deep black with slight lacing and to be honest I was expecting at least a little bit more. The smell was nothing too exciting. At 9% there was the tiniest hint of alcohol but to the extent that it added some flavor to the aroma. Other hints were chocolate, coffee, and a bit of malts. None of these were hugely evident though. The tasting was where this beer really started to shine. The feel was just thick enough that it allowed each flavor (chocolate, malts, alchohol, my friend said ""toast"") to slightly linger before being washed away. This beer got better as I kept drinking it. This might be related to the 9% alcohol content. Overall, this was a very drinkable beer. I thought strongly about ordering another but wanted to try more on the menu.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

A-Jet black body with tan, almost brown, one finger head that settles to the rim and laces all the way down.  S-First aromas you are treated to; roasted grains, smoky, burnt sugar, chocolate, caramel, and coffee. Underneath all this is a hint of fruitiness that keeps the beer from being too harsh. There is a good balance between all of them with the burnt sugar being the main character. The smell makes me salivate and want to start drinking.  T/M-Wow, this one is spot on. The coffee is most prevelent for me. Taste like coffee that has been on the burner all day but it sure is damn good. There is a spiciness to the finish of the beer, a combination of the alcohol and hops. My only complaint is it could have a little creamier mouthfeel.

On to the beer:  The semi-tan head is about a finger thick, the body jet fuel black. Lacing was dissapointing. Aroma is tame and not very strong; mostly charred chocolate. The taste is big on bitter flavors; bitter dark chocolate with a high level of hoppiness. It sweetens up as it warms; from thisn comes a release of dark choclate, molasses, and subtle fruity flavors. Giving it time to warm up makes a big difference in this beer, otherwise you're left with a bitter black beer.

Head is tan and about 1 finger which quickly dissipates. Nice lacing left on the glass. This was a bit of a cold pour, which probably explains the lack of head.  S: Big smells here, really permeates the room. Closer inspection reveals toasted malt, coffee, bitter chocolate, and a surprisngly strong bit of bitterness. Doesn't really smell hoppy...but I don't know what else the bitter would come from.  T: Toasted malt and coffee are prominent in this brew. Other flavors are pretty mild...but there is definitely a hop kick at the end. Fairly resiny, although I don't imagine you'd be able to taste much real flavor character over the darkness of the brew.  MF: Thick and chewy, but not the thickest I've had. It's actually quite a crisp feel. Carbonation is higher than probably a lot of RIS's. Decent warming although it took a few minutes before I really noticed anything.  D: This is a nice RIS, although not as rich and flavorful as others I've had. I really like the bitter character in the end, although it does seem a bit odd for the style. Nice drinkable brew, although at 9% I couldn't drink too many in one sitting.

Tan head is about 2/3 inch thick when poured before settling to a nice thick ring lining the inside the glass along with a very decent surface covering. Excellent lace. Aromas of roasted malt, coffee, and dark chocolate are present, along with a nice hint of alcohol. A bitter roasted coffee and malt flavor hit my palate upon taking my first sip, followed by a bit of sweet caramel and perhaps a hint of chocolate. Rounded out with some hop flavor, but this is more of an afterthought I suppose. The main bitter flavor here seems to come from the coffee flavor more than the hops. Has a sort of dry lingering after taste. Has a very smooth and creamy, frothy fullbodied mouthfeel with moderate to heavy carbonation. Easy to drink, especially considering the high ABV here.

345,1013,travloh,3.9,"admittedly I am really too much of a noob to do this review justice. I have only had a handful of RIS, but I have to season my palate and taste a few more of these before I tear into my bottle of Kate.  I pull this out of the fridge and pour into a goblet. It pours a thick black with a 2 finger head that is the color of wet sand. The whole thing looks frothy and creamy. If you look at the stream as it pours it looks like pepsi.  Its got a roasty coffee smell with some hints of spice and chocolate. Those are generic terms for this style, it seems, but hey thats what I get. Alcohol is faintly present.  After the first taste I remember the tip to let this warm a little.  After 10 min, here we go. Thick, spicy coffee alcohol. Slightly bitter aftertaste that lingers on the center of my tongue. Not unpleasant. Nice. After a few sips the taste in your mouth is bitter and slightly dry. I am liking it.  Halfway down the glass the head and lacing are fighting with the liquid. After every sip the liquid tries to pull all the foam back but the creaminess punches back with some very nice lacing.  The mouthfeel is creamy and thick and I love that ever-so-slight numb feeling you get from the alcohol...this stuff is yummy.  The first cold drink was very different than the warmer midglass gulps.

The head was tan and thick. It stayed for a while the transformed into immediate sticky lacing. There is lacing everywhere.  Aroma is of molasses, dark roasted malt. It has a slight burnt quality to it and you can detect the higher alcohol level.  Taste is rich, creamy and smooth. You start with a warm roasted taste that reminds me more of a French roast coffee or perhaps espresso, but the mouth feel is even bigger. Then you get a whiff of the alcohol before the hops come in and lead to a nice lingering hop bitterness to balance the other flavors. It really has a nice warming effect as you drink it. While I love drinking this right now (July) this reminds me of sitting in front of a fire after a day of skiing. I will have to create that situation in the future.

Not a lot of head presentation; maybe a quarter inch that quickly went away. While it lasted, it was a dark, caramel brown color. You can really smell the coffee and chocolaty malts coming through.  Taste is is exceptional. True to the style, it packs a LOT of flavor. But it's all balanced so well that it isn't overwhelming. There's a lot of chocolate and coffee on your first swig, but then the hops make their presence known. Smooth and creamy. Some other Russian Imperials I've had were good, but there was almost too much flavor thrown at you. This one is perfect.  Alcohol is very well hidden. It's 9%, but it doesn't taste it.

Creamy mouthfeel with a sweeter than dry finish but with a bit of a hop bite in the aftertaste. A big beer, but the 9.1% ABV is well hidden - no hotness or astringency.  Overall, a very nice imperial stout. Big and bold, but not over the top. Recommend for sure.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,FreightTrain,4.46,"Pours absolutely pitch black; even held up to a bright light there is not even a hint of transparency. Small tan head that quickly dissipates to a nice, thin, sticky lacing. Looks like you could eat it with a spoon.  Very mild smell of roasted malts, cherries, and hops. I'd consider this the one place this beer doesn't excel. It was a struggle to even write that sentence.  Taste is roasty, black coffee, and bitter chocolate up front. Bitter but not overwhelming hops on the back end, leaving a pleasing bitterness on the palate that lingers. Smooth but very flavorful.  Exceptionally smooth mouthfeel. Very nice carbonation consisting of small bubbles that really coat the mouth. Creamy and full. Almost the consistency of an oatmeal stout.  A very drinkable Imperial Stout. If I were the kind of guy that had a nightcap every night (or a Russian Czar), this would be my everyday nightcap, like a lawnmower beer but for the evening (a beer geek's evening.) It's immensely flavorful, highly alcoholic without really even hinting at it in the taste, and satisfyingly filling. An excellent beer that always deserves refrigerator space.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,ralree,4.6,"A: Completely opaque black with a dark tan head. Pretty foamy. Laces really nicely, retention very high. Doesn't get better than this.  S: Lots of chocolate and spices, pretty powerful roasted malt, hints of coffee, maybe a little dark fruit.  T: Coffee and chocolate with a background of heavily roasted malt is the main flavor, followed by a nice shot of delicious hops. Pretty sweet and very smoky for the style. More chocolate after swallowing. A definite coffee/carbon bitter flavor sticks around after swallowing, reminding me of a campfire. Alcohol barely detectable under the rich flavor, amazingly.  M: The texture is to die for. Heavy-bodied, chewy, carbonation is good, slight astringency. It's a little syrupy, as expected.  D: Very hard to drink a lot of, and very filling. A good beer to sip. I don't think I could handle this one too often, but when I want an imperial stout, I'll have to find this one again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,cvstrickland,4.23,"12-ounce bottle with a mean-looking bird-of-prey face on it poured into a pint nonic yields an ebony body crowned with three fingers of thick, creamy mocha foam that retains at a fat sheet that leaves swaths of webby lacing on the glass.  Smell is hop chocolate. Yep. That's what I said. Like 'hot chocolate' only with spicy, evergreen hops and a smutty, roasty note of burnt nuts.  Taste is fruitily-hoppy and chocolatey with caramel balanced by the a dark, dark black dry malt bitterness and piney, bitter hops riding a solid sensation of alcohol into the homestretch. Hoppy.  Smooth, spicy, and warming, this drink is completely inappropriate for Greenville on the hottest day lately. Think I'll turn down the a/c a notch. There we go. Great drinkability.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,cjgator3,4.25,"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a pitch black color with a nice tan head that leaves a good amount of lacing around the glass. The aroma is very nice with roasted malts, alcohol soaked fruits and a touch of chocolate and coffee. The taste is very nice as well, with dark roasted malts, a nice bitterness from the hops and a quick bite from the alcohol in the finish. The mouthfeel is oh so smooth and creamy, just perfect! Overall, Victory Storm King Stout is a very good RIS that is spot on for the style! I am not really craving the bigger beers right now since it is June and hot as hell in Florida, but this beer was well worth it! Highly recommended!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,DmanGTR,4.67,"A - pitch black with very slight garnet hues in the light with 1/2"" tan head that left a ring of bubbles and laced minimally in my pint glass.  S - dark chocolate, coffee, slight waft of burnt toast and smokiness. Somewhat floral.  T - very dark malts, chocolate, and coffee with a mild breadiness. No alcoholic taste detected despite the high alcohol content.  M - full bodied, light/medium carbonation. A little chewy and thick on the palate. Quite pleasant.  D - very drinkable. Extremely smooth but the alcohol may catch up to you.  Overall - This is in my opinion one of the greatest stouts available out there. It is rich, flavorful, and you do not need to drink a lot of it to be satisfied (even though you'll want to slam down a few of these in one evening). If the alcohol wasn't so high I'd say it would make an excellent session beer, much like Guinness Extra Stout, but since it is quite potent, I'd like to savor one or two of these on a cool evening with an irish cream cigar.

345,1013,perfectkaos,4.5,"i havent had this beer in almost five years. it used to be on the 100 beer list when i did my first two trips, but was taken off for whatever reason. back then I wasnt big on stouts and I probably didnt give this one a fair shake.  anyhoo... pouts a dark black color with a quarter inch tan head that dissipates down to nothing, leaving some nice lace on the glass.  hops are present on the nose as well as coffee  big taste of hop up front and some dark chocolate bitterness moves in shortly after. Alcohol is hidden perfectly. had i not known about the 9% kick, I wouldnt think this thing was all that strong.  this is a great beer. i cant believe i went so long between storm kings",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,akorsak,4.32,"A hand pull at the brewpub.  A: The stout is dark, black as night with a cream colored head. Like a roach motel, light may go in but it doesn't come out.  S: The aroma is coffee and hops. The coffee is bitter and acrid, swelling with dark roasted malts. The hops are strong but not overpowering, allowing the malts to shine.  T: Coffee and roasted malts, what a great combo. The dark, burnt malts have toast and charred grains but the coffee bite is surprisingly strong. The java intensity is roasted and smooth. Hop bitterness rears it head near the end of the sip and sends a citrus blast on the way out.  M: The stout does quite well in the cask, allowing more coffee and roasted malt flavors to emerge. The stout is formidable, a taste that doesn't let you down.  D: At an abv over 9%, this is a drinker beware type of beer. On a cold wintery day I can see down several bottles. On a cool summer day, one glass is sufficient.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

S - Roasted coffee, caramel, some butter, and alcohol. Some herbal hops pulling through.  T - Coffee hits initially with some leafy hop flavor, though it's subdued by the roasted malts. Bitterness grows until throughout the finish, and lingers for awhile.  M - Full bodied, with some moderate carbonation. Semi-creamy mouthfeel.  D - Pretty good, but I wouldn't have another. I'm not sure what all the hype surrounding this beer is about; I found it a little dry and less complex than other RIS's. I prefer a slightly fruitier component as opposed to the intense burnt flavor.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Nesued,4.45,"It took me by suprise that I hadn't already reviewed this beer. Can't let that continue.  Poured from a 12 oz bottle, with a ""enjoy by Jan 27 12"" stamp on the side. About a year ago I bought several six-packs that I've stored for a bit. Poured into a Delirium tremens glass.  Appearance - A thick viscous pour. Little head formed at first, but after increasing the flow, a two-finger dense tan head filled the glass. Lots of lacing remained as the head resolved into a marginally thin ring.  Smell - Even after a year, the hops are still present to the nose. A fresh clean smell coupled with an almost milk-chocolate aroma. A roasted malt presence is there as well.  Taste - Starts out with a bit of a light fruit body which quickly is overtaken by a hop presence. Moves into a roasted malt end-game. The bonus is the clean finish that leaves you wanting more.  Mouthfeel - Dense and chewy at the onset with a warm full-bodied presence that really lends itself to transporting this brew around your mouth. The carbonation is present, but it isn't the backbone for how this beer rolls around your tastebuds. I did notice a bit of a thinning as the tasting continued, would be my only down mark.  Drinkability - What a sipper! This is an excellent stout, especially if you like some hops with your typical roasted coffee/malt offering. Hold it in your hands to warm it up, you will not be dissappointed. I'm going to let more of these age for a few years, see if the hoppy presence mellows some more.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,everetends,4.17,"12 oz bottle acquired from Redwood21. Thanks, buddy. Poured into a tulip.  A: Poured a black, thick pour. Built a small brown head that appeared after the pour was completed. I would have appreciated more head, but it did produce some good sticky lacing with what I got. Still a good example of what a RIS should look like.  S: Smelled of heavily roasted malt, nuts, dark chocolate, and there was absolutely hops there. Much more hops than I expected but it brought a good nose together. Smells great.  T: Taste was great. Dark chocolate with notes of caramel, roasted malt, almonds, coffee and cream. Once again the hops hit you. If this beer is too cold, the hops bring forth an insane bitterness to this brew. Let it warm and it smoothes out. Once it is proper temperature, the hops are there but not overwhelming.  M: Rich and creamy big bodied brew. Really coats the mouth and lets you know what is in there. Real pleasant after tastes linger and allow to explore this one.  D: Very accessible for an RIS. Could have easily had more than one which is a difference compared to Ten FIDY, Rasputin or Sammy Smith's. Very nice balance and creaminess to this beer in mouthfeel, taste and nose. So happy I got to try this one.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Pours a motor oil dark with a nice two finger brown head that vanishes like sands through the hourglass.  Cant get much of a smell of it, dont know why. Sometimes this happens to me. What I can smell is alcohol, hops, dark malts.  Tastes at first of straight up bitter hops, then the tongue warms up to espresso, chocolate, cherries, just overall really fricking good.  Lingering sweet aftertaste. Dry, cocoa. Really tongue smacking tasty. Leaves a burning alcohol taste shooting down your throat.  Really good beer. Much better than Counting Crows Rain King song.

Nice frothy head of fine bubbles, dark tan, that dissipates and leaves thin lacing all the way down.  Aroma is harsh and indistinct, with some hops, some toffee and caramel, lots of earthy wood, and some higher alcohols. No dominant chocolate or roast.  Flavor is strong with caramel coupled with a strong burnt note. Alcohol evident, leaves an aftertaste of charred coffee. Cola aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is thinner than expected, salty on the lips. No roast, no big sweet body.  Not bad, but not one I'd bother to buy again. Kind of homebrew-like. Great appearance set the bar high, but it was all downhill after the pour.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

345,1013,Buebie,2.95,"Purchased at the Cellars in Roseville. Poured from a 12 oz bottle.  Off the pour I'm wondering how this is going to be, as it appears watery, not thick and creamy like most Imperial stout's. Its pitch black alright. Head retention is not there, laceing is present, but not there either as far as stouts go.  Smell is average for stout's, this one is a bit more hoppy is smell. Again its average, smell is not potent for this style. I get wiffs of grain and some chocolate malt.  Taste is robust malt character, bittersweet chocolate, tobacco, grassy hops, burnt caramel, oak. Some chalky dust like overtones. Mouthfeel is medium in thickness, some creamy textures. Carbonation is quite a bit higher then I'd like, it really takes away from the creamy textures of the beer. I wont buy this again. It was an average, to less then average Imperial stout. Ten Fiddy was much much better.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Brad007,4.63,"Color: Pours a jet black color with the consistency of motor oil with a decent mocha-brown two finger head.  Aroma: Roasty with strong coffee aroma. A hint of chocolate and licorice in the aroma as well. Hops stand out well but do not seem to be overpowering.  Taste: Starts out with a decent roasty bitterness followed by flavors of coffee, chocolate and licorice. Hops are just right and seem to add to the smoothness of this.  Mouthfeel: Roasty, bitter and thick with a creamy consistency. Muted coffee/chocolate flavors. Little hop bitterness.  Drinkability: Very smooth and simple. A straightforward RIS that hits it on the spot for me. Alcohol is just right too. I would recommend this as an introduction to the style. I would also rate it higher than McNeils RIS because the hop bitterness does not overwhelm the palate.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

All provide balance and even some grainy taste in the finish to combine with a sweet-bitter finish.  Notes: This one was not as aggressive as Brooklyn Brewery's RIS. Easier to sip and I did not feel as though I needed to cellar it. The ABV did not bother me,but I would not have more than one at a time.

Surely a dessert in a glass.  Smells chocolaty sweet with nutty, coffee-bean like aromas.  The flavor is malty smooth from the start, finishing hoppy amd sweet in the end. I really thought the brew smoothened out quite a bit as it warmed a little.  A packed body with a lot flavor going on. Suculent richness salavates the glands after every swallow.

Chocolate is also there, some dried figs as well- every part of it has a great strong roasted flavor and aroma. Among the best smelling brews Ive experienced.  T: Flavor not as exquisite as the nose but still tight. I enjoy the bitterness of this imp stout matched with the deeply roasted malt. The layers of flavor from the cask are even more balanced and sublime.  M: Viscosity of motor oil. Sweet and bitter complex flavors confuses my tongue a bit but it surely is complex.

S: Dark roast coffee smell with some burnt chocolate notes and a nice hops smell. Not the same hop nose of the normal C02 I had at the brewery, they seem muted a bit.  T: A deep roasted earthy flavor with coffee, dark chocolate, dark fruit, slight vanilla and toasted malts. The beer has a nice earthy hops bitterness to it, but as I noted the hops seem muted more in the cask version. Very creamy and smooth with some slight sweetness. Nice lingering bitterness on the finish with that deep roasted flavor. Very, very smooth on cask, almost illegal.  M: Creamy smooth but with a nice oily resiny feel that coats the mouth nicely. Lingering bitterness.  D: High, unfortunately. I say that because these go down so smoothly and with 9.1 abv it will kick your ass in no time. The cask version is superb, simply superb.  Overall Storm King is one of my favorite Impy Stouts and it's even better on cask. I would have liked just a tad more hops, but it's damn near perfection.

I've had as many as four 18oz servings of these in the past (when I had a sixtel tapped in the home bar), and can tell you that this becomes a little TOO drinkable after #2.

Little less than average light brown head. Good lacing.  S: Great smell. Dark chocolate, coffee, caramel, fruit, vanilla, and a slight woody smokiness.  T: Naturally a lot like it smells. Sweet maltiness with a nice hop aftertaste to balance things out. A nice chocolate/coffee aftertaste going on as well.  M: Very smooth with the right amount of carbonation.

345,1013,clayrock81,3.93,"Had this on-tap and my pint glass was filled with a dense, black body that had a brownish head that was two fingers high and never really went away. I picked up some good malt smells in the roast and coffee department, but not much else in malt or anything like hops or sweetness. Rather bland smell. A very smooth beer is the first thing that strikes me, but it also contains a heavy coffee taste mixed with roasted malts, chocolate and some caramel and/or honey, as there is some smoothness and sweetness tucked in there. Also hints of cherry or some tart fruit and spices, although the malt is dominate. Thick and heavy-bodied but not too syrupy, this has a dry backbite due more to the malt characteristics and spices than the ABV, which I didn't even realize was anywhere near that until I did this review (i would've guessed 6% or something). Even with that knowledge, I would still relax with a couple of these at the bar again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Smell is strangely of bitter hops up front, and then dark fruits, roasted malts, and bready sweetness.  Taste is of dark roasted malts, hops bitterness, bitter chocolate, peppery spicy alcohol, and light undertones of espresso.  Mouthfeel is sharp, nicely carbonated for a stout, thick and chewy.  A good stout! It's very strong and seems a bit too bitter and hoppy for this style, however.

On the finish was a noticeable dark smooth roasted coffee grind fade.  M: full bodied, very viscose and syrupy with a nice roasted lacing that lingered on after the swallow.

The nose was filled with scents of bitter chocolate, coffee grounds, burnt caramel and campfire smoke. The palate was concentrated yet light on its feet with balancing bitterness and was smooth throughout. The finish was very long with the bitter chocolate and coffee lingering on and on.

T- Lots of chocolate and coffee finished off with figgy sweetness. The alcohol is there but only slightly and warms you nicely  M- Amazing, soft and creamy.

The smell is of roasted coffee and a fig-like dark sweetness. The feel is thin but smooth, with a burst of carbonation upon drinking soon after the pour but not much later on. The flavor is likewise dark but more of a burnt-toast flavor than coffee. There is a rather dry hop finish with a lingering flavor of bitter chocolate.  Overall, it isn't a bad brew but it seems like the aspects are a bit unbalanced.

Roasted malts, just a hint floral hops.  Flavor: Definitely get tasty floral hops off the top, that rapidly goes to burnt espresso. The alcohol is there... I've got to be honest from the appearance I was expecting a more of a big maltiness. I do enjoy the chocolate hoppy finish. But it still dies off pretty fast.  Mouth Feel: It sort of feels like a liquid chocolate covered espresso bean that's been liquidated. It coats the month and stays their for a while. Definitely a redeeming quality to this beer.  Drink ability: I will happily split this beer with anyone who wants to try one out of my cellar. But it's not a beer where I'm going to get excited about and look forward to drinking.

The aroma is slightly acrid but it has ample wafts of espresso, dark chocolate, caramel and alcohol which all comes together with a slight whisky edge. This follows through in the flavor with some dark roast coffee bite in the mouthfeel. This somewhat detracts from the enjoyment of the beer but it's still very solid and one I'd like to try again.

I've had quite a few imperial/strong stouts lately (I needed to do my research before brewing my own a couple of months back) but I would not rate this as one of my top 5.  It pours very dark, of course, and I won't go into what shade of black it is or isn't. A nice amount of head for a stout and lacing lingers on the glass. It has a rich malty mouthfeel with smokey aftertaste. There is definately some hoppy fruits in there but they are dominated by the roasted/smokey flavors.

Dry finish with warming from the alcohol.  m - full and creamy with some carbonation. Good balance here.  d - This is a great stout. It's not obviously complex, but if you pay attention you can pick out a lot. The strong acidity/hoppy finish and alcohol content will keep this from being a huge hit for me.

Some nice lace is left behind. S: Not a very strong aroma, but pleasant non the less. Bitter chocolate, coffee, malt, and some hops. T: Roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate flavors again. A ton of hops that give the beer a harsh bitterness. Not really what I was expecting. M/D: Medium body (in a relative way for a RIS). Not as heavy as I thought it would be. That is not a bad thing, I just like my RIS to give a huge coat of the mouth. This does not. At just over 9% ABV, this is a sipping beer. Given that, the bitterness makes it a little harder to drink.  Kind of a sub-par RIS in my book.

Taste: Espresso hoppy malt with a little anise sneaking in, bittersweet chocolate when left on the tongue.  Drinkability: For me the hops overpower this one.

S: It had an aroma profile that led with the espresso and dark chocolate. There was a dark roasted malt smell and whiffs of ripe fermented fruits (figs, plums).  T: It was a rich complex balance of flavors that feature a thick, black expresso that is reminiscent of Turkish coffee (without the bitterness) and oily bitter-sweet bakers chocolate.

345,1013,SurlyDuff,4.5,"Holy cow, bit of story here first. Had my buddy, WVBeerGeek send a bottle of Storm King to me from back East. I hadn't had any in 3 years...going through withdrawl.  Then poof! Two days later I find it on tap at one of my favorite beer bars. I've never seen SK out here at any bottle shops, let alone on tap!  Oh well.  This review is for the glorious chalice that I had poured for me at Blacksmith Bar&Restaurant.  Dark with no light escaping it. Dark thick head.  A nice hop profile awaits, hidden...nestled perhaps...beneath armomas of coffee, espresso, and rich candy sugars. An alcohol aroma too, similar to brandy or cognac.  Light carbonation in the mouth. Sweetness of chocolate and esperesso is nicely balanced with a hop presence. Roasty, then finishes with a bitter mouthwatering mouthfeel.  Yum, very drinkable and very good!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,bloberglawp,3.83,"Alright, big thanks to ncvbc for this bottle.  Pour pitch black, dark foamy head, soft brwonish-white lacing. Nice.  Aroma of dark chocolate and a citrus/fruity hop presence. Flavor id all bitter roast and chocolate malts, light coffee tone. Dry finish and a bit chalky. Alcohol is very well cloaked. Faint and very slow warming effect. It has the taste and mouthfeel of a a very full and well rounded light alcohol session stout.  Good stuff.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,hoppymeal,4.22,"Bottled Sep 05. Pours black with a small pumpkin pie dark tan head that recedes to a ring. Aroma is sweet dark fruitiness and aged maltiness, some prunes and raisins, also a bourbony twang of alcohol, hints of chocolate and a grassiness as well. Taste follows with some dry chocolate blending with the dark sweet fruitiness, grapes and raisins, dry bitter roastiness is almost smoky and chocolatey, a grassy bite in the finish along with a warmth of alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium in body, tingling carbonation, and fairly dry mid taste to the finish. Decent bitter bite. Very good, I had never reviewed this particular beer as when I first tried it fresh (from this same six pack in 05/06) I wasn't crazy about it and just decided I'd tuck it back in the cabinet and see waht happened. It's improved imo and may go longer, though ageing can go both ways, this was a definite winner.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

345,1013,mvanaskie13,4.46,"Received a case of this as a present, then went and picked up another 6-pack this past weekend on a beer run in south jersey because it is such a tasty brew.  Pours from the bottle a thick, viscous black with creamy tan head a finger thick that dissipates, but lingers on the glass.  Smell is a coffee/espresso, chocolate, nutty mixture that is not as strong as the appearance and pour lead me to assume.  Taste is roasted malts and a bit of hops, with smooth earthen, espresso finish.  Mouthfeel is creamy smooth upfront with a bit of carbonation and an alcohol twinge on finish.  Drinkability is dependent upon your mood. Since I had a case of this I had few nights where I could have a few of these and others where one fills me up. Either way it is very drinkable.

Pours a deep black that has shades of red at edges with light. The crown overflowed the glass, a good 2 fingers high. Thick an frothy khaki colored. Laces nicely up the walls of the glass.  Aroma is roasted chocolate mocha latte. Chocolaty and chewy, with a bit of earthy bitterness.  Lots of roastyness to the flavor, strong like a shot of espresso which blends with malty sweetness and dark chocolate. Nicely balanced with a touch of hop bitterness after the initial maltiness. Complex, roasted malts in a somewhat dry finish lingers.  Good solid body to this beer and a very nice mouthfeel. Surprisingly the alcohol is masked pretty well, aside from its warming effect.  Excellent Imperial Stout with great drinkability and lots to explore.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,lightindarkness,4.2,"This bottle courtesy of abankovich.  Pours a deep dark black with some ambery brown edges. Tan head doesn't last long but leaves some nice lace.  Nose is filled with roasty goodness, dark roasted grains, toasted bread, bitter chocolate, and earthy root. Some dark fruits hide in the earthy roasted smell.  Taste is very round, with big full maltiness and some very subtle vanilla sweetness. Big dark flavors of toasted wheat bread, coffee, and chocolate fade into a well controlled resiny bitterness that holds on to the grainy taste through the finish.  Nice full mouthfeel with a good dose of carbonation. Slight dryness at the finish is momentary inside the sticky smooth body.  Besides a little heat, the alcohol is very well masked by the nicely balanced flavor of this stout. I like that it had very little sweetness, leaning more towards roasted tastes and some resiny hops.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

I've had the Abyss and was impressed, but with the rarity of it and the cost, Storm King is just as amazing if not smoother then the huge Abyss.  Pours jet black. Nice brown head that fades to a wonderful lace. Some hops are actually detectable in this complex flavor of chocolate roasted malt and with very little bitterness at all.

345,1013,brewdlyhooked13,4.38,"Bottled 11/11/02  Kudos to pimpp who hooked me up with a *new* release of this as a *toss-in*, woo hoo! It inspired me to start cracking a few of these vintages open, starting with the first one I bought during the initial year of my BA-ship. Thanks for the nudge, Patrick! :-)  Appearance - pours quite black, a thin head of mocha sets up and falls readily back to a sparse partial cover and lacy, bubbly collar.  Aroma - vinous notes on the pour, changes to a pleasant but faded roasted grain.  Taste - good roast level on the grain, not overly charred but fully roasted. There is a very interesting flavor mid-palate, like orange circus peanuts or Pez candy. St. Josephs's aspirin, that's what it reminds me of. Could be the result of muted sweetness after five years in storage. or maybe a trace of hops. The swallow is deep and roasty, the hops still showing some ability to balance. The aftertaste is more of the candied aspirin and roasted grain flavor, some bittersweet chocolate emerging on the lengthy finish.  Mouthfeel - well weighted, the carbonation has held well but doesn't interfere. The residue is very nice, making for a prolonged flavor.  Drinkability - I couldn't find much of the 9.1 abv in this. Maybe a touch down in the belly. Delicious. Now onto a fresher sample for comparison...",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,skillerified,4,"A deep brown color straight from the bottle. Lovely dark tan head, milk chocolate in color really, short but with nice lacing. Sort of looks like a crown on the side of the glass. Fitting.  Strongly scented in both hop and malt department. The hop side seems to take the lead with a strong flowery scent. Theres a cola-like bridge to the malts, which lend a chocolatey sweetness, though not quite the actual scent of chocolate. Some coffee, but not harsh. There is a definite dark chocolate covered fruit scent in there too - cherries I'd say. Complex, but not quite deep. Still very good though.  A lot of hop and a little roasted malt. The malt comes in a cola like flavor. Again with the dark chocolate covered fruit, though less cherry-like than the scent. There is a coffee like burnt flavor in there - not really my kind of thing, but not entirely undesirable either. The hop wallop rides over top of all of that with a strong fruity and vaguely piney/grassy flavor in every sip.  Bitter bites first - a little brash even. Seems to be a better beer at warmer temperatures, so make sure this one has time to sit before drinking it. Gets a little creamy with time on the tongue. A little off balanced and a little burnt tasting. Maybe a little too aggressive in this area. Just my opinion though, I could definitely see where someone would like it this way. Well hidden ABV though.  I guess I prefer a little more smooth and a little less overwhelming power in a beer, so the drinkability suffers for me. Still a great choice though. Watch that sneaky ABV.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,erosier,4.32,"This beer pours a deep brown/black color with a tall and thick tan head that laced the glass heavily on the way down. It smelled of deep roasted malts with a small amount of hop bitterness at the end. Underneath is a faint hint of some sweet chocolate, but not too much in the aroma. The taste is excellent for an imperial stout. It tastes of very deep roasted malts followed by some caramel, chocoloate, and then a hop bitterness at the end that rounds out the beer really well. It has a nice smooth and warm mouthfeel with the perfect amount of carbonation. The drinkability is very good for a beer of this magnitude.

Smell is roasted malts, smokey earth tones, slight hints of chocolate and alcohol.  Taste is malts, coffee, very slight chocolate, a hop kick on the back end, maybe a little too much of an alcohol taste going on.  Thick and creamy, a slight oily feel after the fact, medium carbonation.  All together, a fairly well done stout.

Maybe I didn't get a good whiff, but this didn't excite me overly much.  T - A hodge podge of flavors, not all of them good. Some deep earthy tones and complexity that I can't quite pin down, but it's all overpowered by a harsh or alcoholic taste. I'm not a very big fan, and for all the good reviews, this beer just left me wanting for something with more defined flavor.  M - Pretty good, actually. medium-heavy carbonation doesn't leave the taste flat, so that's a plus.  D - I can sip on this, but it just didn't leave me wanting another sip. ""It's Storm King, so I better finish it"" is about the best I could muster.  Overall, I'll pass this beer on to someone else. Maybe I got a bad batch, but I think the brewers might want to re-evaluate the direction they've moved in with this beer.

Pours black and rises quickly to a light brown coffee colored head which rises up to the top of the glass prior to finishing what was a mellow pour. The head is already lacing the glass before the first sip.  Smells of dark roasted malts, chocolate, coffee and mellow earthy hops. The nose really lines up this beer to a ""T"". Big roasted malts up front that transition to huge malt sweetness that is almost syrupy, very coating. The malts coat the mouth and alcohol tinges rise off the tongue right as the hops make a brief but more than expected assertive hit.  This beer is thick and rich and feels like it's got a slick of rosin or oil on top that continually coats the mouth.

The nose of this brew is a wonderful blend of coffee, chocolate, caramel, and a nice alcohol spice as well.  I was expecting just a big, huge brew that overwhelmed the palate, but I was pleasantly surprised with a beer that that first hits the tongue with a wonderful creamy mouthfeel, as one would expect from a stout and then a good dose of carbonation at the end keeps this beer well out of the range of being too creamy. Ditto for the flavors, as they are actually somewhat subtle up front, with chocolate, coffee, a little caramel that rides through to a good dose of bitterness that does a wonderful job of keeping this big old stout from being too sweet. A nice bit of alcohol flavor meshes perfectly with the hops to help this brew finish nice and dry leaving you wanting another sip.  As far as I'm concerned, for a big beer, this one has it all. Full of flavor, as one would expect, but unlike some big brews, this one doesn't try to overdo things. It's balanced, but still big and bad, and oh man is it drinkable.

There is a roasted malt flavor as well but its overshadowed by a rough alcohol taste. Not a great mouthfeel, its average at best in fact it leaves me with a dry almost chapped throat feeling.

345,1013,JDV,3.68,"Bottle courtesy of DrBayern - Rich thick nicely viscous black pour in a snifter with a short lived brown head. Smell is of some dark roasted malt, but the big hoppiness of this came off as extremely metallic to me. As it warmed this lessened, and it was more roasty with a sharp hoppiness. Taste was fairly hopped, dark and roasty with very little sweetness, and with alcohol only lightly noticeable, but pleasant. A mild tasting finish with a good bitterness and a nicely thick pleasant mouthfeel. As far as stouts go, I'm starting to think I enjoy the sweeter and/or less hoppy stouts, because to me the dark roast character and the big hoppiness seem to clash. Rather than the citrusy, light, aromatic floral qualities as present in Pales, IPAs, etc.. I rather find the hops tasting bland bitter and metallic if predominant in bigger stouts. Not bad at all, but just not my speed.  Re-rate - enjoyed on draght and really liked the dry roastiness to it. Solid mouthfeel and body and an enjoyable flavor all around.

345,1013,wheelinshirt,4.18,"12 oz brown longneck bottle poured into a snifter that was sampled by a couple friends. Bottle is marked best before August 2012, so this one is about 6 months old.  First of all, this is one dark beer, so black with a milk chocolate colored head that sported pretty good retention and lacing. I have seen this in a pint glass and it looks fantastic.  Smell is, obviously, roasted malts, chocolate, some coffee, some alcohol coming through but it is nicely tempered, which is a welcome change from RIS alcohol bombs. There is also a pleasant hoppiness that just peeps through all the dark malts to remind me that this is, after all, a beer, and one from victory nonetheless.  Taste is dominated by dark roasted malts, chocolate and coffee, some alcohol and some hoppiness. Pretty much the same story. This one is good, and pretty smooth. Not too bold so as to be harsh, not to tame so as to be boring.  Mouthfeel was full without being syrupy or cloying, medium low carbonation keeps it just lively enough. Very drinkable. 9% is up there, but not so high that i would have passed on drinking another right then and there. Delicious and fairly cheap.

T-Complex malt character, with coffee, chocolate, molasses and a nice earthiness. A bit more hop than expected breaks through, along with a hint of citrus. Nicely balances the beer. A little cherry and chocolate subsides to a dry roasted malt finish.  M-Nice mouthfeel. This is a thick, smooth beer that coats your mouth. A nice level of carbonation plays with the palate.

345,1013,steelcutoats,4.24,"The bottle of Storm King that I am reviewing today was given to me by a representative of Victory Brewing Co. at a beer tasting that I recently attended. While I have had Storm King before I figured now would be the perfect time to sample this high gravity stout seeing that its 14 degrees outside.  The beer poured into the usual tasting snifter with a small head that quickly vanished. The lacing on the inside of the glass was minimal. The nose was sharp with hints of coffee, chocolate and caramel. Although this beer boasts a 9.1% ABV it is very drinkable, and it doesn't leave you with a harsh, alcoholic aftertaste. I am planning on taking a trip to the Victory brewery, hopefully sometime this spring. I'll definitely be sure to bring a few bottles back for aging.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,coalcracker,3.75,"Appearance: Pours virtually pitch-black with brown head.  Smell: The scent of sherry comes to mind immediately. Mild roasted aromas surface.  Taste: Burnt and bitter tones- slightly astringent, bite initally. The roasted malts are quite evident, ushering up notes of coffee and dark chocolate. Taste lingers for awhile on the palate. An alcohol warmth is also very perceptible throughout the tasting. Fortunately, as this beer warmed, these harsher elements seemed to mellow a bit.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with a moderately slick feel.  Drinkability: Good for a single serving, especially if paired appropriately. Not a serviceable session brew.  Overall: The bitterness and 'burnt' properties seem to be a bit too forthcoming here. Seems like this could be a much better beer if its overall aggressiveness would be turned down a notch. Perhaps a little time in the cellar would tone this down some...",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Aroma of bitter chocolate, semi sweet cherry cordials, some far off roasted malts and/or coffee. The taste is warm with alcohol throughout, but with sweet cherries and dark chocolate, roasted malts and robust arabica beans. Some lingering hop bitterness in the finish.  This RIS is big and viscous. Smooth and creamy in the mouth.

Aroma is complete heaven, Roasted grains, malts and semi chocolate. Nice!! Taste is phenomenal. Nice coffee and chocolate attack with flanks of chicory bitterness and hoppy piney finish. Mouthfeel is a very pleasing malty but not too thick and syrupy feel.

Lots of flavor as soon as it hits the palate, like espresso coffee, roasted malts, and some hoppy bitterness, actually quite complex. Mouthfeel is oily smooth, medium-heavy body, the finish is definitely bitter. Mellows a wee bit as it warms up a little. Excellent stout, Nice cold weather beer.

345,1013,GRPunk,4.52,"Bottle with a best by date of January 2, 2012 poured into a tulip glass.  A- It poured a jet black with a thin tan head that became a light lace in the middle of the glass and around the edges. It left nice sticky rings.  S- Initially, it was on the hoppier end of the RIS spectrum. The hoppy scent was well mixed with sweet chocolate, coffee, and raisin tones.  T- It had great flavor. There was a well blended mix of roasted coffee and sweet raisin flavors combined with a nice hop touch. The alcohol is well masked.  M- It had a good thick feel as expected for the style that left a slight coating effect. There was a little bite from the hops.  D- It's a nice full-flavored sipper. I'd look forward to drinking it again.  Overall- Storm King is a great cold weather beer.

345,1013,BeardedBoffin,4.43,"After a quick pour of this pitch black beer had a large, creamy tan-colored head. Piney hops waft above this beer and dominate the nose. The feel in the mouth is full bodied and coats the palate. The taste of chocolate and espresso manage to make an appearance through the dominating hoppy bitterness. The beer signs off with more lasting bitterness. This is a complex beer. The strong bitterness is nicely complemented by the roasted malt flavors and the mouthfeel of the beer. One of my favorites.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,HopDerek,4.32,"Pours a pitch black color with 1 finger of creamy tan head, good retention, and some lacing, though only at the top. Smells of dark chocolate, roasted malt, dark fruits like raisins, coffee, and milk chocolate. Taste starts out with some licorice, followed by a creamy milk chocolate, raisins and other dark fruits, and a bitter coffee finish. Medium in body with good carbonation, smooth, but with a nice bite in the finish. Very drinkable for a RIS, presents with a fairly nice balance and would be a good brew to try to venture into the world of Imperial Stouts.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Junnila,4.42,"Pours a dark black hole color with light tan head that dissipated quickly. Smells of a typical RIS, dark roasted malt, chocolate, molasses, bread, etc. Taste is superb with smoky hints of everything I smelled and more. Mouthfeel is also very similar to many other RIS I have tasted, full body and sense of alcohol but not too dominant. Drinkability is very high for an RIS in my opinion. I will be trying other Victory selections as they become available based on their RIS.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,BiereBlanche,4.77,"12 oz bottle ""enjoy by sept 2012"" into a working glass.  A- It's just black, no seeing through it, black. Gorgeous, huge creamy tan-chocolate head. No lace work, sadly.  S- Very rich, lots of cocoa, dark chocolate notes at the forefront with generous helpings of sweet coffee, dark berries. Hops are minimal and might have mellowed since fresh.  T- Sweet and smooth up front quickly grows into a heavy dose of roast darkness - bitter cocoa and chocolate covered coffee beans, espresso along with the right amount of acrid bitterness. Grapefruit hops come with plenty of flavor and a well balanced bitterness. Alcohol is muted for the ABV, but present. Finishes dry with a lot of lingering bitter roast character. All the elements of a great RIS are here and balanced to make a very drinkable stout.  M- Full, but could still be a bit heavier for my likings. Low carbonation.  D- A great sipping stout, never overpowering, but with all the great, rich and heavy elements I was looking for. I think this would be great with any amount of aging. It's great right now, and I imagine it had a stronger hops presence a few months ago. I'm looking forward to trying this for years to come.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,pmcadamis,4.03,"A - Pitch black brew with a big three finger heat that gets really rocky and chunky on its slow journey down to one finger. Nice retention and foaminess on the head! Lots of really foamy lace in stuck to the glass.  S - Milk chocolate, tootsie roll pops (chocolate), a hint of mint, and whipped cream. No where near as roasted or dark chocolate focused as I expected. This smells more like mint chocolate chip ice cream. Its also not quite as assertive as it should be...being an 'imperial"" brew and all.  T - Licorice, mint, and herbal tea in addition to the expected milk chocolate and espresso. This is actually very delicate and complex. It's not the big bruiser that I thought it would be, but it's still got quite a bit of coffee bitterness.  M - Big bodied, thick, and viscous as hell. This is a very buxom brew! Middling carbonation fades to a really dry and herbal finish like green tea. Wicks all moisture from my mouth!  D - This is a very good beer, but I do think that it's a bit overrated...or it could be that many of the nuances found here (green tea, mint chocolate chip) are not my favorite flavors in the world. I was craving some bitter dark chocolate, whisky-like booze, and espresso bit this took things in a whole new direction for an imperial stout. Originality is a good thing.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,SIRIUS2,2.87,"Sharp hop nose with secondary malt aromas. Virtually no head on the pour of this nearly pitch black brew. The flavor is sharp and warm, with heavy malts coming in afterwards. It finishes very hoppy and warm all the way down. The alcohol is present and is hardly masked by the intense flavors of the hops & malts.  Oof. I know Storm King is probably representative of the Russian Imperial Stout style but it just isn't my speed. Apologies to those that enjoy this style but I had a hard time with it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,deltatauhobbit,4.06,"Thanks to EGledhill for the chance to try.  Pours a dark brown/black with a good size tan head and lacing to match.  Smell is surprisingly hoppy for a RIS. Can't seem to make out the roasted malt as easily as I can other stout since the hoppiness covers most of the other aromas.  Taste is very creamy and smooth, roasted malt upfront but is quickly replaced by a hop bitterness (with slight coffee hints) that lingers long after. After warming up, the roasted malt sweetness begins to have more of a presence though. Certainly one of the more accessible RIS's that I've had.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,allergictomacros,5,"A - Pours out a thick, opaque liquid with a thick brown foam. Excellent stickiness and retention.  S - Smells incredibly hoppy for a stout - grapefruit first and foremost, followed by some fruitiness. After a while lots of chocolate start coming through as well.  T - Very bitter, some molasses sweetness up front, big juicy citrus/grapefruit in the middle and finishes quite dry and bitter with a distinct cocoa flavour. 2nd sip is bittersweet chocolate up front, citrus middle again, and a hoppy finish. Take 3, more roastiness coming through but still as hoppy. Alcohol is showing more now as well.  M - Chewy but with a fresh menthol character that lightens it somewhat (I think it's something to do with the hoppiness).  D - This is really &lt;any expletive&gt; good. Apparently this is my 401st review, and the first full ""5"" rating for me.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,KodyBrannon,4.38,"Poured this beer into a pint glass, It poured an opaque black color with an orangeish/tannish colored head that dicipated quickly. The smell of this beer was very strong, and consisted of roasted malts, with a hearty helping of coffee and just a touch of dark chocolate. The taste was as strong as the smell, Coffee hit first, then roasted malts, but it ended with a slight aftertaste of chocolate. The mouthfeel on this beer is thick, but not so thick that it makes it chewey. Just thick enough to really feel it. All in all this beer was very easy to drink, But as you reach the bottom of the glass, you really start to feel that 9% abv. I couldn't drink an entire 6 pack in one sitting, but one or two of these beers and I'm going to be happy. This is a great winter beer to keep me warm during the cold winter months. I only wish I could have this year round.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

This pours a solid black with a very slight head that disappears quickly. If it had a good head on it, i would have rated the appearance tops. The smell is almost like a nutty coffee but isn't overpowering. The flavor is like a rich coffee and dark chocolate. In fact, eating dark chocolate with this beer brings out the flavors in both.  I highly recommend this.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Tasted hot, dark fruit (fig?), coffee, malty, and more hops that i would prefer myself.  Was thick and pretty creamy, nice smooth mouthfeel  Too hot for me, which some cellar time might improve. I guess these higher abvs for me lack drinkability because of the heat, seems very few are well masked or balanced.

345,1013,SpencerT,4.27,"A black coffee body with creamy short latte colored head. The lacing was very good. This pint looked as good from the pour to the bottom of the glass. The aroma was a mix of chocolate and smoke that was a very pleasant to the nose. The taste starts with the smokiness and finishes with the sweetness and bitterness of a high quality dark chocolate. The thick and creamy feel is pleasant. The smoothness of this stout is a great trait, almost a cream stout feel. I would consider this one of my top Imperial Stout choices after this bottle. I recommend this Stout highly.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,jdubjacket,3.26,"Purchased a six-pack of this at Jax in Sandy Springs.  Pours a pitch black color. Smell and taste seemed somewhat confused as I couldn't hone in on any one flavor exactly. Maybe some roasted malts. Unfortunately it tasted a little metallic. I thought maybe it was just the batch. But when I bought it again a few weeks later to double check, it still had the same taste.  Mouthfeel and drinkability were about average. Overall, this isn't a bad beer, but I've definitely had better beers from Victory & better RIS's.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,stephens101,4.12,"Highly anticipated brew not native to my area. There's something about a beer you can't get to every day that makes it intriguing. Pours mahogany with a slight and quickly dissipating head after a light pour. Molasses, caramel, roasted malts and dark chocolate float up to the nose. Tastes of strong coffee, burnt wood, big malts and some bubblegum in the back, with the alcohol heat almost covered up by syrupy sweetness. The hop presence is nice and perfectly matched. Carbonation is decent. Mouth-feel is more on the crisp side as opposed to other brews of the genre. A bit drier than I'm used to, and not as full-bodied as expected, but that's not to say this isn't a drinkable and sharply presented RIS.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Lothar666,4.13,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a shipyard pint glass.  A- A creamy, two finger thick, dark coffee almond brown head was set atop a dark, black body through which not a speck of light passed. This is what a Russian Imperial Stout should look like.  S- A fairly weak nose, actually, but then again I rate my imperial stouts more on taste and mouthfeel than smell. Slight coffee, chocolate and dark malt notes were present.  T- Now we're talking. Dark malts backed by a strong, robust, almost nutty coffee and chocolate flavor balanced by an absolutely perfect bite from the strong alcohol and hop bitterness in the finish. This beer is one of those that form the standard by which other Russian Imperial Stouts should be judged.  M- Thick and chewy with the spent motor oil texture that I love in an RIS. Creamy texture that coats the tongue well and lingers in the mouth long after the initial swallow.  D- Best enjoyed as a sipper, this beer is so drinkable that one is easily tempted to guzzle or chug. It is a pity that more bars don't serve this beer, as it would quickly replace both Guinness and Sam Adams as my stand-by bar beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Pools of tiny bubbles augment the creamy looking surface. The smell is aggressive. A surprising hoppy character blasts through the soft roast malt and chocolate aromas. The mouth feel has a whole bunch of complexity to it. Lightly carbonated, a tangy hop and alcohol note over the smooth and creamy textures. Full flavored, I experience a warming barrel-aged like cherry-vanilla character from the hop. The roasted malt aspect of the taste is right on target. A creamy mocha caramel flavor dominates and lingers appropriately. It is really a wonderful drinker, but you better not have to wander far after a couple of these bad boys because the 9.1%ABV is REAL.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Smoke and charcoal flavors are also distinguishable.  M: Thick, light heavy body, mild sweetness, with sharp carbonation.  D: Well disguised 9% abv, but continuous roasty espresso flavor persuades sipping due to acidity.  Notes: Very tasty winter beer. I'll definitely be drinking this beer again before the winters end.

Aromas noted are roasted malt, and coffee with a slight hop in there also. Taste is a thick combination of coffee and chocolate flavors, with notes of caramel, nuts, and a small, yet pleasant hop bitterness. Syrupy m/f on this one, ABV hurts the drinkabilty.

T: Tastes of roasted malt, expresso, grassy hops, a fair amount of bitterness on the back end with some alcohol warmth. Hints of chocolate also emerge in the finish.

Absolutely jet black, huge fluffy caramel colored head, shelves of lacing down the glass.  It smells rich and chocolatey with some coffee and malt. The wonderfully rich, creamy taste of this brings out chocolate, coffee, malt, and a slight hint of hops.  This is really an excellent stout. In fact, it's one of the better ones that I've ever had.

Smells of coffee and roasted malt-very deep rich aromas.  Roasted malts and coffee aromas are present right away in the first sip along with some hops and some sweetness, like a molasses maybe. A bit of chocolate kick as well makes it well balanced for my taste.  Lots of body and fullness in this one-nothing thin about it.

Typical RIS smells: burnt malts, unsweetened dark chocalate, has a nice floral sweetness, which I think is from the hops. Taste is similar to smell and I really like the nice spicy hops bite, which really comes through in the after taste.  This one fall about middle of the road in body for RISs. Solid, but not as full as some. Carbonation is medium as expected for the style.  Alcohol is well masked and the malt/hops are very balanced, making this a really drinkable RIS.

The fusels have mellowed massively and a whole new layer of rich chocolate sweetness has emerged.  The pour is not as black as th blackest of black can blackly black, but its still black, black. Nice tan head with mediocre head retention and larger imperial stout bubblies.  Nose is roasty sweet like toasted marshmallows. Not too much coffe for me in this one. Of course it i there some given the style, but not overwhelmingly. Chocolate however is assertive. A smokiness in this beer I've never noticed before. My friend pointed out some smell that reminded him of hot dogs. I'm veggy, but I rememeber hot dogs and I totoally pick up on what he is describing.  Flavor- Roast unsurprisingly jumps out immediately, however a nice sweetness of dark chocolate balances this with some tingly carbonation to clean the tongue for the next sip. A hint of smoked spicy meat in the flavor. The finish is definitely full of roasted barley but not as loud as some other examples of this style, or as some of the winter malty warmers I've been drinking lately. Overall, much improved. I'm aging three bottles to see how another few years treats them.  Delicious hot roast to this beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Bittersweet chocolate / molasses with a roasted coffee and black malt bitterness. Piney hops round out the edges. The mouthfeel is full and creamy and will not disappoint. This is a great offering from Victory. It doesn't have quite the flavor profile to match up with my favorites, but it is very damn good nonetheless.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Ineedabeerhere,4.23,"my first review, so be kind-  Out of a bottle into a pint glass- pours black as black can get... i mean, really black... it was around 4 o'clock in the afternoon and held it up next to the window, and no light was coming through this puppy! The head is a nice tan color that compliments it nicely. Very good looking stout. average to small sized head, that still remained when i was taking my last few sips.  The aroma was great, above average for this style, lots of chocolate and and coffee flavors, however hops are surprisingly noticeable, i almost felt the aroma had a little bit of a sweet quality to it. The taste is great, and right on par with the aroma. Contrary to other reviews, i didn't feel as though the alcohol flavors were too overpowering. The mouth-feel was as good as it gets for this style in my opinion. Obviously, for a 9.2% stout like this, the drinkability isn't going to be too high.  I will definitely be purchasing this again in the future, and am curious to see how it will age over time, and maybe my store was overpriced but i paid $10.99 for a 6 pack, just as comparison. Hopefully my first review ever was on par somewhat. Bottoms up!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Dark tan head that was fluffy with tight bubbles that fell slowly and left an impressive lacing down the mug  S - A thick dark roasy malt smell...nutty and with a hint of mocha and a nice hop profile in the nose..thought it was enticing  T/M - The taste was much like the smell only more assertive and pronounced..the malt taste was balanced well with a mocha and nutty flavor and then balanced out nicely with the hallmark Victory hop profile  D - Overall it was a very good beer..as with all RIS it's best to have at the back end of a night drinking..a little heavy to have these all night,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

345,1013,woodychandler,4.72,"This arrived with a thick, medium-tan head with almost nitrogen-pour qualities. It had a rich, chocolate nose with lightly smoky notes. The color was really dark, almost cola/carmel colored. The mouthfeel had a better-than thin but less-than-full quality. Lots of dark chocolate and a little charcoal flavor in the mouth. Finish was rich, slightly smoky and redolent with chocolate. Pass me the brownies.  A re-review following GEN Sutter Cask Night on F, 24 Apr 2009:  Gee, I thought that I had not had this from a cask before, but my reviews prove me wrong. Whoops!  Coming off of a gravity pour, it had a deep-tan/light-brown soapy head with mild retention. The nose had dark chocolate, raisins, plums, coffee, and tobacco. The color was a deep, dark, impenetrable black. The mouthfeel was slick and oily, although a little thin in its density. The immediate taste was of smoking a maduro cigar on the fantail of the Self-Defense Test Ship (SDTS) in 1995, following evening chow, so a cup of mess decks coffee would have been a natural accompaniment. Ah, the memories ... The finish had a slight heat that gave 'way to a lingering smoky flavor.  I'll be frank here, and earnest, too. RIS just is not my preferred style. This was a terrific iteration, but I simply do not get the charge from it that others seem to. Call it the ""Blind Man at the Movies Syndrome"".

Pours impenetrable black with a very large head. head fades slowly leaving tough lace. nose is very espresso malty, with unusually strong hop tones. Good hop flavors throughout but with a clear malt presence. Espresso, molasses and coffee bean flavors dominate but the strong hop presence is extraordinary. Good bitter bite on the finish.

There is no garnet hue, or glimmer of hope, into the depths of total despair we leap... I sure hope they serve peanuts on this flight.  The puny head that does settle on top is colored like coffee cake. One could make quite the statement serving coffee cake with Storm King. Work efficiency would surely rise, akin to the jolly workers at Google, who get complimentary foot massages while they go about business aboard their personal bidets. They, are happy people.  Once I finally get to dipping my nose in, I take in a strong breath of alcohol saturated prunes, almond, & cream. Around this time last year, it was mostly alcohol & spent charcoal. All these months spent tripping over the case in the closet, & the subsequent shin bruises have apparently been working. If the rest didn't go to work, I'll really be disappointed.  Diving in, a lot more almond & a quite tasty fill of oatmeal, minus the body. There is a roasted character there, but thankfully, it isn't more coffee, which makes its way into almost everything I drink these days. The alcohol melds into a lettucy bitterness that just barely settles in the finish laying with the soft taste of white bread. Much, much better then the burnt coffee & soot I had to put up with when it was new.  The carbonation has dropped, & it feels a littler thinner then one would expect out of such a saturated brew. Maybe a little sticky, but it doesn't full on coat your mouth.  A year has passed, & the alcohol has genuinely take a back seat to everything else.

It's hard to put a finger on it, but the chocolate taste is there. The roasted coffee taste is there. But there's more... a fruity undertone (raisins, plums) that makes this stand out. The high ABV prevents you from downing these en masse, but that's not what this beer is meant for. It's for special occasions, like 3-day weekends, the first snowfall of the season or a college basketball double-header.  At $12/six-pack, it's a little on the high end, but well worth it.

Hops contribution is hefty with leafy bite and longer floral tang which is a great complement to the fruity and toasted flavors. The alcohol presence in taste is less than in aroma.  M: Creamy and substantial without being dense or heavy. Pleasant raisin and hoppy aftertaste that is not acrid.  D: Delicious if you like stouts on the toasted side with a substantial leafy hops bitterness.

Still looks great with dense 1-2 finger cocoa colored head. Nose is more tame and less boozy but still plenty hoppy with a wallop of espresso and dark chocolate too. Flavor reflects the nose with a pleasant berry fruitiness that is matched nicely with strong but not acrid roasted maltiness cut with solid leafy hoppiness and a big dose of espresso and bitter dark chocolate. The hoppiness is decreased from the fresh I've tried, but still pretty large for the style. Smooth feel with a light tickle of alcohol and char. A great beer -- I'm going to get more to put away and try some younger and older than this one. But it's pretty hard to beat, especially for the equivalent bomber price of $3.85.

A good amount of leafy hops and espresso linger on the nose.  Rich and decadent. Thick, creamy milk chocolate and mocha coffee. Super roasty with moderate/hight sweetness for a RIS.

A two finger cocoa head rose slowly on the pour and stayed at the peak for a couple minutes before falling to a thin swirling. The head left some very nice drink lines together with sheet lacing on its way down the glass. A good looking stout to be sure.  The aroma kicks off with a nice helping of cold coffee. Roasted barley, dark chocolate, and a mild heavy cream come through from middle to end. After a few deep whiffs I can finally pull out the hops and spicy alcohol in the background.  The flavor is similiar to the aroma. The roasted barley seems a touch more pronounced and bitter than in the smell. There's a hint of dark fruits here and there in the background. The cold coffee comes through nicely and everything seems to be in balance. This is a good stout by anyone's standards, just not one of my favorites.  The body is on the hefty side but not exactly creamy and thick like a stout of this caliber should be. Mouthfeel is slick and rather quick moving. Slight heat on the swallow adds a welcomed touch.  This is a sipper just like every other RIS you come across. An easy one to put away with the slick mouthfeel. The alcohol will catch up pretty quickly though.

Taste is also very rich, full flavored, with an assertive roast, loads of chocolate, coffee, sugar and caramel, with minty hops and a clean boozy, firmly bitter finish. A fantastic RIS, vintage and world class.  Mouthfeel is full and luscious, smooth as silk. 1 year of aging and these are just getting started.  Drinkability is supreme for me.

Best by Mar 22 2012  APPEARANCE: Pours into my Ommegang tulip a pitch black with a small creamy brown head. It drops to a smallish collar and a few splotchy bubbles on the surface.  SMELL: The smell is fantastically balanced and robust. A nutty coffee character comes out immediately accompanied by chocolate, and some mild fruity esters. A firm hop bitterness shines equally and strikes a perfectly achieved balance.  TASTE: The hops show themselves first and prepare for an assault of malty goodness. Chocolate, coffee, nutty, and toffee are prominently featured as the beer crosses the palate. A slight fruitiness comes on toward the finish as does a minor alcohol bite. Everything is here and it's all around fantastic.  MOUTHFEEL: Thick and slick. The carbonation is on the low end making this beer drink like motor oil. And that's a good thing.  DRINKABILITY: Good. It's a big beer and would be tough to have another, but it's nowhere near out of the question. The alcohol is detectable but doesn't show itself more than it should.  Excellent beer.

I have to drive across town to get it, and it's well worth it.  Although drinkable, this beer is worthy of being sipped, as the taste and mouthfeel evolve rather than simply fading. The initial vanilla hit fades, followed by a noble cola/coffee bitterness truly worthy of the stout designation, followed by alcohol. The head could be darker for an imperial and it could last longer, but the taste is solid and full, on par with what a stout should be. Unlike some other popular imperial/Russian imperial stouts, there's nothing overdone about Storm King. Because Great Lakes' Blackout Stout is seasonal (Feb/Mar), the Storm King is my stout standard for ten months out of the year, when available.

Another great offering from Victory.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Gehrig,4.5,"After getting the kids to sleep, I grabbed a bottle of Storm King, fittingly enough on the first night we've had actual, durable snow here in Champaign, about 1 1/2"" of powder. As a transplanted Western New Yorker, this was a modest but welcome sight.  Storm King is a welcome beer, but far from modest. Its appearance is impressive--bold, black, with a finger of mocha head, lots of latticed lacing, nice. Much confronts the nose and palate--clearly chocolate and coffee (dare I say espresso), some caramel, and a distinctly hopped taste that I like. The flavors really explode as it settles into a slightly warmer temperature, bringing out its roasted quality.  I'm definitely impressed. The texture is very smooth, hiding the high ABV, and the hops linger to the finish. This is well worth grabbing a six-pack, for it is not to be passed up. A perfect way to cap a snowy Midwestern night.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,tfuchs,4.08,"Bottle I picked up at Total Wine in Annandale. Poured into a heavy 14oz mug. Had this on Dec 5, 07 - 74th Anniv. of repealment of probition AND DC's first snowfall of 07/08... perfect night for this one.  Pitch Black with a healthy (1"") tan head.  Smells like Chocolate and, seriously, salted ham. My family grew up on VA salted hams, and their smell is unmistakable - strong, meaty, with a fistful of salt and pepper. It took me a minute to figure out, but it was the smoked flavor coming through - just like a big 'ol smoked ham.  Umm, the taste was a let down at first, but as I let it warm the flavor really filled out. After 5 or 10 min warming on the coffee table, the full depth came out to play - coffee, chocolate, cream, and caramel. Delicious, smooth, with just enough bite. I'm going to get more of this and age it.  The texture and viscosity were excellent. Thick enough to justify its imperialness, but without being syrupy.  Especially drinkable for a 9.1% ABV. Dangerously drinkable when very cold. But, I much prefered it nearer to room temp.  All-in-all, an excellent stout. Not sure it's an excellent imperial, but very good. Either way, IMO, it's deserving of the high marks it's gotten on BA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Mdog,4.03,"Appearance: Totally black, good head, good lacing.  Smell: Dark chocolate, coffee.  Taste: Strong dark chocolate and black coffee bitterness, not overpowering in bitterness. Leans a little more towards chocolate than coffee.  Mouthfeel: Not overly thick or coating.  Drinkability: Strong, but hidden alcohol means care should be taken. A couple of these is enough for a sitting.  I hadn't had this one in a while so I bought a single. It's better than I remember it being, with a nice dark chocolate bitterness. Good stuff.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,cswhitehorse,4.38,The Storm King pours as dark as night with a two finger foam head and some nice lacing on the side of the glass. The aroma is roasted malts and chocolate. I also get some nuttiness as well. The flavor up front is a little hop bitterness and finishes very nicely with a complex espresso taste. In the mouth is lingers well and really leaves the coffee aftertaste in the mouth. Very impressive Russian Imperial.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,fitzy84,4.45,"Had in its bottle at Moan and Dove. The appearance was incredibly delicious looking: dark body, medium-dark brown head that thinned out quickly. The smells of coffee-like malts were very heavy and enticing. The taste was utterly delicious: a great mixture of espresso-like flavors and malts. A crisp carbonation wraps this heavy body in an almost refreshing status. In general, this was an incredibly delicious, thick drink. A great Russian imperial stout!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,clemsonbrewer,4.55,Pours black with a dark tan head with a fair amout of retention. Less lacing than I expected.  Largely hoppy nose for a stout. Rich roasted black coffee nose. There's quite a bit of alcohol as this one is very fresh.  Huge black coffee that turns the mouth very dry after swallowing. Still very green with prevalent hops and loads of warming alcohol.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Dalem,3.68,"It's damn near black. The head was even darker that most dark beers and reminded me of a chocolate malted. The smell kinda threw me off though. It didn't remind me of any stout I've had before. Sure, it was smokey and you get whiffs of the alcohol (but at 9% ABV how could it not really) but had also had that hoppy citrus scent going on too. Ain't no doubt about it that Victory doesn't ever skimp on the hop and it's no exception here. It's an interesting tasting one too. A roasted nutty flavor intertwines with a coffee like bitterness at first, then the malt and a bit chocolate comes through with the hops and alcohol rising up strong in the finish.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

345,1013,irishkyle21,4.3,"Pours with a deep tanned head that eventually drops to a mere reflection of its former self. A lot of lacing is left behind after each comforting sip. Has a dark ebony color.  Smells of roasted coffee/malts, espresso, chocolate, molasses and the hops barely come through.  This RIS is very smooth and balanced.

S: Chocolate and malt up front. Some hops in the background. Slight piney smell  T: Simply awesome. I have been on a big imperial stout kick lately and this stands out. Coffee and roasted malt up front just like the smell. Goes neutral for a second then the second rush starts with a slight citrus taste then to a bitter finish. Everything is really well balanced.  M: Full bodied for sure but not very thick. You know what this is but it is not like trying to drink darkness.  D: I am enjoying my bottle and find it more quaffable that other examples of the style. I have one more in the fridge and 4 aging. I think I might need to get some more for the cellar. Excellent beer.  12-28-07 From a 12oz bottle into my glass.  A: Jet black with 2 fingers of tan head with minimal lacing.  S: Roasted malt, some chocolate. not much else. Little booze.  T: Roasted malt into coffee with a sweetness to it. You get a faint hop taste in the finish.  M: Med body with good carbonation. Slightly silky.  D: Split a 12oz bottle and I want another. Really great bang for your buck.

After much searching and many a sleepless night, a good buddy and I finally grabbed a case of Storm King from our neighborhood distributor. It definitely did not disappoint.  It pours out like melted chocolate; black as night and super rich. From the smell of it, coffee and nuts are definitely involved, but this tasty flavor is nicely balanced with a killer alcohol warmth and a particularly awesome aftertaste.  High quality stuff from start to finish and one of my favorite stouts, but I recommend it from a glass 'cause it loses some of its essence out of the bottle.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Spotty lacing.  S: strong roasted malt with some strong chocolate notes. Espresso and alcohol in the background.  T: alcohol up front followed closely by strong toasted malt, again with chocolate and espresso undertones, toasted aftertaste with some slight hop/alcohol bitterness.  M: very smooth despite the abv and strong toasted flavors. A little on the thin side, but just barely. Not much else to say, really.  D: very drinkable minus the slight alcohol/bitter aftertaste.

A 5 year best by date printed on the front(May 30, 2012)  A: Straight black with a good 2 finger tan head. Head full of millions of tiny bubbles. Head dies to a good 1/4 and stays there. Nice lacing.  S: I could smell this before the cap was all the way off. First thing I noticed was huge coffee notes with a definite burnt sugar backbone. Further inspection shows a good amount of bitterness from very high cocoa chocolate and sweetness from molasses. Very complex. I'll try a snifter with my other bottle.  T/M: MMmm so nice. At 9.10%, this leaves nearly no alcohol punch. With a clear road the coffee and chocolate are unhindered to spread their wings. An extremely well balanced hop bitterness keeps things in check. Maybe a touch more bitterness would enhance the coffee side but I really can't nit pick. Full bodied with low carbonation.  D: Very high.

Dark, bittersweet chocolate, more hints of raisins, and then some more fusel alcohol at the end. It's definitely hot.  M: Full-bodied, followed up by the heat of the alcohol.  D: Ok for now.

Poured a jet black liquid not as crude oilish as some others IRS but still nice and think. It created a mocha head about a finger thick that lasted a few minutes. Smell of coffee smoke and chocalate. Taste of a coffee ,slight bitter coco flavor with a mellow alcohol warmth. Mouthfeel is full body more on the dryside..

It was fairly daunting at first sip, as I didn't realize this was an imperial stout and had myself prepared for something a little smoother.  This has a bitterness to it that you might expect from a dark imperial stout, and actually started tasting better the longer I let it warm up (I tend to start my beers off very cold and let them come close to room temperature before finishing them).  Not a bad beer by any means, though I'm not the biggest fan of the imperial stout to begin with so my opinion is pretty skewed.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

My nose picks up a sweet coffee chocolate roasted barley blend that is superb. Most of these early hints are followed through in the taste. There seems to be just the right amount of carbonation and the 9.1% abv is barely perceptible. Aftertaste continues to please with the roasted feeling staying with.

Aromas are full of toffee, chocolate, roasted grain, and some slight caramel; with little to no hop presence. Body does not come across as heavy as most with this beer, moderate to high carbonation for style. Very bright and intense flavors, quite fruity, reminds me of a good high cocoa chocolate bar. Almost gives off a flavor of lactose but I doubt any is used, just has a very smooth sweetness in the finish. Roasty or hop bitterness is nowhere in this beer putting it a little out of ""balance"" for an American version.

You also get a bit of the alcohol.  M: Full bodied which adequately stands up to the bitterness. Good carbination keeps everything in check.  D: The alcohol is present but that didn't turn me off at all. It is very bitter and high in alcohol so something that would keep me to two or three and only if I wasn't driving.

Still pours an impenetrable black with a small tan head that melts quickly to a ring of dark tan bubbles.  Aroma is now much more mellow....dark toasted malt, candied dark fruits, tobacco, mild and smooth chocolate, and still the alcohol. I notice a very faint sweet fruit as well that I want to say smells a bit like cherries.  Mouthfeel is slightly thin for all that is going on in here.  Taste is an incredible improvement with age. Dark burnt roasted malt....bittersweet dark chocolate....some creamy dark candied fruits like prunes with lots of sugars, a hint of espresso, some dark, dark cherry, and then again the alcohol.

Bottles on date says Nov 14, 2005  12 ounce bottle, snifter glass  A - Brew has a vicious black color allowing no light whatsoever to pass through. About two fingers of tan head up top.  S - Big malty smell. Dark chocolate sticks out the most on the nose.  T - A very nice taste here. The hops that are very prevalent in young Storm King have faded, leaving the chocolate flvaor as the lead. The chocolate is followed by some residual sweetness. Finally, a bit of coffee like bitterness pokes around and lends itself to a nice aftertaste.  M - Nice feel here. Not as huge and full as some Imp Stouts but a good firm body.  D - I am loving this brew, and am probably drinking it too fast. This has really held up well. Tastes great and goes down way too easy for 9.1% ABV.

Roast, raisins, a tiny breath of alcohol, sticky bitterness at the back of the throat; I can't believe I haven't tasted this beer before.

345,1013,morimech,4.4,"A black as night stout that swallows all light like a black hole. A one fingered tan head tops off this mysterious looking brew that settles to a light cap. As it is consumed some spotted lacing is left behind.  The smell makes this very appetizing. Roasted malt, chocolate, espresso, and floral hops all are evident. It smells delicious.  The taste is just awesome. And I don't even drink that many RIS (the best I have ever had). Malt, chocolate, coffee, and hop flavors are perfectly balance to make a complex and big beer. Alcohol leaves a slightly warming effect as it slides down the throat. Medium bodied, lightly carbonated, and feels extremely smooth. The high alcohol is the only thing that will keep a person from drinking several of these in an evening.  Edit: 03/03/12 A beer a batch earlier than the one I reviewed in 2007. Best by date of Sept 13, 2012.  Definately looks like an aged beer at this point. Still dark as night but a slight head forms and quickly settles to a skim of suds on the surface. Light lacing is left down the glass during consumption.  In the aroma the hops and alcochol have died away. Replaced by black licorice and an earthiness.  Not hot as fresh either. It does not benefit from age as stouts like Expedition Stout, but it definately has a distinct flavor. A lot of anise and chocolate. The hops and alcohol have definately mellowed. Slightly oxidized.  I would lower the body score. More recent stouts offer fuller bodies. Aging has no effect.  Without the hops this beer is not as good as I remember it.

It subsides, leaving spots of lacing down the walls of the glass. Roasted malt in the nose, with an undercurrent of dark fruits, and a healthy floral hop note offsetting it just enough to remind you that you are not in Siberia. When cold, the astringency is more prominent, with a healthy carbonation anchored by the roasted chocolate and coffee base, a touch of figs, and an earthy bitterness that lightens the mouthfeel. Clean, and thin, but when warm, gets more complex, with notes of vanilla and stronger fruit, the hops fully emerging yet subordinate to the malt. Finishes very crisp for a stout, with coffee lingering like a halcyon memory.

Very prominent and distinct nose. Smells like a Belgian...dark fruits (plum and dark cherries) and raisins. First taste is like a Belgian, astringent, dark fruits...but mouthfeel is thin and watery. Second sip corrects all this. Taste starts out the same, but the coating on the tongue and tastebuds show this to be a rich and flavorful beer. As you drink, the malt characteristics come out and the beer seems less astringent and more crisp and malty. Drinkability is good for this high level abv.

It's cold, too cold for a proper tasting - but I can't help but dive right in. Patience has never been a virtue of mine.  The cold, biting brew conjures images of being plunged into a glacial ice crevasse -- the palace of the Storm King. It's slick, with strong bitter chocolate and earthy charcoal. It may be the temperature (and the astringency), but this is the ""cleanest"" tasting stout I've ever had. It's like a dark, bitter blizzard -- but I'm hooked.

345,1013,ballenc,4.58,"Just cracked a bottle from last winter's run - all I can say is WOW! When I had this last winter (Jan-Feb 2007), it was a good imperial stout but now, with just a few months of aging, this stuff is much better than I recall.  Pours an intense black/dark brown with a nice tight tan head that recedes slowly with moderate lacing lingering on the glass.  The aroma is powerful (as an Imperial Stout should be!) with primarily licorice and coffee mingling with a definite alcohol punch. After the licorice and coffee subsides, a nice roasted caramel malt lingers on the nose.  Taste mirrors the smell - almost an anice/licorice flavor with dark roasted coffee complexity - malty with a bit of hoppiness to finish with a very nice balance. Probably (with a bit of aging) one of the best Imperial Stouts I've had in several years.  Nice and weighty on the tongue - not overly thick but noticeable density. A pleasant creaminess that lingers.  I am intrigued to pick up the new season's Storm King and compare it with last year's version. I definitely think a 6-8 month aging has allowed this big stout to mellow a bit but don't let that fool you - these aren't beers to drink all night but a couple in one sitting are a definite treat.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

345,1013,OWSLEY069,4,"Pours black with a small tan head. Aromas of coffee, dark chocolate and a toffee-ish alcohol. In the taste, a dry coffee and a bigger alcohol presence than in aroma. A smooth malty mouthfeel and a bitter chocolate malt aftertaste. Nice hop presence and fantastic.

345,1013,tkarsies,4.03,"Have had this bottle a few months and since the weather started to get cold, decided to open it up. Served cool in my trusty pint glass and allowed to warm up. The appearance is coal black. A small tan head fades to lacing that lasts forever. I cant see through it at all even when holding it to the light. Smells of hops as well as roasted malt. Smells like a Russian Imperial Stout should. Taste is initially strong of roasted malt with some hop bitterness. Later, the hops show up stronger although in the end the roasted flavor wins out. Minimal carbonation with medium mouthfeel. When fresh, the alcohol dominated the flavor, but now it is not very noticeable and just provides a nice warming sensation. For a RIS, it is easy to drink. The strong roasted malt and hop flavor limit me to a couple bottles. This is not my favorite RIS but it is very good.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,BreadSlicer,2.8,"Appearance: I was very excited on the first pour since it lived up to it's exceptionally dark and bold image  Smell: Typical RIS smell but more to the hoppy/nutty side  Taste: WAY too alcoholic for my tastes. The only other stout I've ever had that had a more dominating alcohol character was a Yeti IS which I hated. It makes every little sip a bit too far on the harsh side for me personally. Almost like drinking a brandy. But if you like drinking brandy...  Mouthfeel: Nice. Nothing special, but nice.  Drinkability: For me its barely drinkable enough to keep me from pouring it down the drain due to the 'way too alcoholic' character. There's actually a very good stout behind all that alcohol though.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Stoneman78,4.08,"A- Pours a very deep and dark black hue with a tan creamy head that leaves a wide swath of lacing around the glass S- Nose is of dark roasted malts with a heavy coffee/espresso emphasis, some subtle sweet caramel and earthy tones, subtle alcohol and floral hops T- Taste is dominated by very sweet and sugary malts and cocoa backed by a range of citrus and pine hops, coffee picks up midway through and caps up the finish along with some bittering hops M- Full-bodied IRS with a very creamy and smooth texture, nicely carbonated D- Very smooth and creamy IRS that is well-balanced and easy to drink even at 9%abv, but I think it still can't quite hang with the big, bold, and complex west coast IRS offerings, I may or may not pick this up again in the future",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,hellcatsjg,3.37,"Appearance: Good dark stout look. A fingers worth of light tan head and a small bit of lacing as you go.  Smell: Scents of caramel, roasted chocolates, a bit of coffee, and a touch of hoppiness.  Taste: Doesn't do much for me. A split second of good stout flavor quickly gives way to an overly bitter taste that sticks around for too long. Not what I was looking for in a stout.  Mouthfeel: Good thickness. Flavor coats your mouth and sticks around for a while, too boad it's not the flavor I wanted.  Drinkability: Would be much higher if the taste was better. Not too offensive tasting, but not something I would try again. Surprised, given the high rating.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

T: Roasted malty goodness... all the earthy flavors are present (think coffee, chocolate, licorice, and molasses) and are interupted with what i believe to be an orange peel rush before returning to the roasted malts  M: Delightfully thick yet surprisingly smooth  O: You would never know this stout was hitting the scales at over 9% with the way this goes down",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Very nice milky mouthfeel, with a little tingle on the tip of the tongue. Mild, smooth finish, with not as much of an alcohol aftertaste that I have experienced with other imperials. This is one of the best imperials I have tasted. Would love the opportunity to experience on tap.

345,1013,wanker,5,"[my review is updated for the 2007 release]  I rated this beer 4.1 when I tried the 2006 release. The 2007 release deserves a new review and my first 5 rating.  For 2007, the hops have been toned down a bit and the chocolate has been turned WAY up. I love chocolate stout, so this is a good thing.  This beer deserves a new category, ""imperial chocolate stout.""  The hops are there and come through in the smell. But the taste is so perfectly balanced that no one component dominates. There is something in here for every stout lover: some hops, some malt, lots of chocolate, just a hint of vanilla - a bit of everything.  This would be a great beer to drink with dessert.  The mouthfeel is perfect, not syrupy at all. Velvety.  Run, don't walk, to get some of this beer!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,BigJTrucker,4.43,"Recieved this bottle as part of my Summer Spper BIF 2007.  Bottled on December 16, 2004.  Poured a deep dark almost black color with hints of mahogany around the edges. Tan head settled fairly slowly to a thin layer of foam. Aroma is a nice blend of coffee, and some flowery hops. Coffee flavors predominate, along with a very faint and mild hoppyness to it. Mouthfeel is very smooth and full bodied. A very good, drinkable stout. It has aged very well, flavors/aromas blend together well, making this one a pleasure to behold. My only regret is this was my only bottle and i should have saved it for a special occasion. Well, the beer was so good it made this night seem fairly special indeed.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,younger35,4.76,"Brought this monster back from my recent trip to Chicago. This is the last of the 3 or 4 that I brought, DAMN!! Comes in a pretty cool bottle with a best by date of March 9, 2012. Drank from my Dead Guy Ale pint glass.  Appearance- Pours a super deep dark black with almost blood red hues mixed throughout. Super creamy one finger head recedes fairly quickly leaving no cap but a nice thin collar. Leaves very little lacing that quickly follows the beer down the glass. Smell- Dark roasted malts have a sweet burnt caramel like quality. Very gentle cocoa powder and espresso beans show through along with some alcohol. Not as big of a nose as Ive smelled in other IRSs but still nice. The only weakness (minor*) in this beer. Taste- Dark roasted French roast coffee with an instant kick of bitter bakers chocolate. Nice blasts of citrus that seems like it should be out of place but blends in perfectly. Hints of molasses and smoke show at times but for the most part this beer is dominated by the chocolate and fruit. Finishes with a bitter coffee aftertaste and amazingly at about 10% ABV, the alcohol shows almost zero. Mouthfeel- Big, thick and creamy. Feels like this beer should feel like. Silky smooth with very little carbonation. Drinkability- This beer is a couple chocolate chips away from being a brownie in a bottle. Its so freaking good. Goes down so easy and smooth despite the big ABV. I really wish I had more access to this brew. When I eventually move back to Chicago this beer will have a permanent spot in my beer fridge and cellar. Great stuff!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,surlyseth,4.6,"A: Pours cola to coffee color with a nice khaki head.  S: Oooh. Chocolaty coffee. Is this a cold mocha latte with some hops!?!  T&M: Wow! This is silky and espresso-like. Super smooth. Loving the low carbonation and obvious presence of hops. Choco-notes with a full coffee flavor. I'm tempted to substitute this for morning coffee. Sweet with a hoppy finish.  D: High ABV, but you really wouldn't know it until it gets in your bloodstream. The hops must be the thing that make this stout such a treat for me.  This is an incredible brew. A great pairing with peanut butter cups!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Overlord,4.5,"After loving the @$% out of the resplendent hop wallop, I was extraordinarily hyped for this brew.  Pours a dark black with a nice tan head. Carbonation and a small head lingers for the entire drink, a facet of mouthfeel I'm beginning to appreciate more.  Taste is bitter, bitter chocolate with coffee (not as espresso-ey as other stouts, this is more like a normal black coffee). Some vanilla rounds out the flavors. Not much, if any, dark fruit or hops to it, although others have noted that they detected it. A hint of grapefruit hops (particularly if you let it linger on your tongue) ... but this is mostly roasted malt and a delicious coffee/chocolate combo.  This puppy has a serious bite in both alcohol content and flavor exhaustion. Two twelve oz. bottles and my taste buds were burned out.  Delicious.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,number1bum,4.22,"Part of NEPA BC split #6.  Pours pitch black, thick as motor oil, with two fingers of rich and creamy coffee colored head. Recedes to a thin lace and leaves just a little bit of stick on the sides.  Smell is big chocolate and roasted malt, coffee, a bit of boozy alcohol and just a ton of sweet and enticing malt.  Taste is much like the smell, with chocolate and roasted malt, some coffee and molasses flavor, and a semi-sweet roasted finish. There's a peep of fruitiness in there, as well, and the alcohol sneaks into the flavor more than I'd like. As it warms the alcohol becomes less noticeable and it really smooths out.  The mouthfeel is exceptionally creamy, full-bodied and luscious in the mouth. Drinkability takes a bit of a hit because of the ABV and because the alcohol is too noticeable. Definitely let it warm.  Overall this is a top notch brew, although not the best RIS I've had.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,MrBen,4,"This is a very nice Russian Imperial. The only aspect that kept me from giving it a higher rating was the lingering hop notes in the aftertaste. I definitely detected hop body in the drink, which is okay, but I would have preferred a malt-dominant beer. That said, hops were not way over the top.  Pour is nearly black/opaque, head is a nice tan color that fades into a creamy dusting on the surface. Body is full and rich, pinched a little by the hops, but otherwise malty and toasty. Taste overall is quite good. I plan to try this one again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,bigeyedfish,4.37,"A beer I've waited so long to try- not sure if an almost cannon-status will be good or bad for this beer. 12oz bottle from a case that says drink by 12 July 2012. Guess that means it's a 2007 release.  Appearance- a thin, espresso head forms, and quickly dissipates on top of a squid-ink-darkness-level-body which failed light penetration test from three different distances on multiple lights. So yeah, pretty dark, deathly looking beer.  Smells like chocolate for the most part, the dark almost baker kind with a hint of something stronger, more potent in the end(probably coffee).  Tastes like, wow, ok, yeah. Almost like hearing for 5 years how good Crime and Punishment, Fathers and Sons, et al is, and then having it be even better than everyone said. Chocolate, carbonation, some more chocolate. A late developing, lingering espresso (almost of the dark roasted Nicaraguan/Panamanian or even a nice Pacific Island Single Origin).  Mouthfeel is quite complex and remarkably enjoyable. Starts out with a nice bit of chocolate(again, of the dark, almost baker's varietal). progresses to a nice little bit of alka-seltzer-like carbonation coming from the back 2/3's of the tongue to the roof of the mouth, followed by a quick retreat of carbonation and a full on encampment of coffee and more chocolate, which seem to weaken/strengthen with little rhyme or reason, except that the dance is both amazingly free-for-all and remarkably waltz-precise.  the drinkability for one bottle is very good; it is smooth and pleasing and a beer that you do not want to end. however, the high abv is less than friendly in facilitating an all night drinking of this beer.  to sum up, wow. it's tough to hear so many great things about one beer; eventually it stops being something you enjoy and something you do because everyone else says you have to (ala reading all the classics). for once, it is nice to see that the hype falls short.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,sleazo,3.88,"Been waiting to try this one for awhile, I hope it delivers.  A-Pours a jet black, virtually no light gets through. A nice coffee coloured head settles down into a foamy slick. Great lacing.  S-hits all the typical notes for the style, coffee, dark chocolate and alcohol. Slightly subdued.  T-First thing that hits you is the roasted coffee/malt bitterness. A bit of dark chocolate is then hinted at along with some dark rum. Trypical for the style but I suppose nothing really stands out here to differentiate it from the tons of other Russians out there. As it warms a bit of pine and black pepper come through.  M-Very good, thick and syrupy without too much of the chalkiness that negatively effects others of its style. Good carbonation too.  D-what sets this stout apart is the carbonation which cuts through the rich tasting viscous liquid. Taste wise it is good but not great for the style. An enjoyable beer one i will probably have again but too be honest I think i am burning myself out on the heavy stouts.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

S: big, clean roasty smell with big malt. signular, not overly comples, but just good.  T: roast continues witha chocolate nuttiness, no coffee, unitl a bite in the aftertaste that complete the flow over the tongue.  M: medium to heavy, but not a chewy stout. Not think or waters in any way either. Just smooth.  D: very easy--too much for a stout.  Overall: one of my favorite stouts.

345,1013,cdrummer,4.33,"A: Like a black hole. Not only does it not let light through, it simply absorbs all light around it. The ivory head stays around for a while, sticking to the sides of the glass all the way to the end.  S: Like baker's chocolate and a hint of the alcohol soon to come.  T&M: Hits crisp, strong, and tad floral due to the hops, then slowly brings on the malty, thick, toasty, dark chocolate goodness. It transitions into a strongly warming finish, reminding me of chipotle pepper chocolate gelato because of the way it coats the palate, allowing the flavor and viscosity to linger.  D: This is an easy beer to drink. The high abv and sheer thickness of it make it a nice sipper, yet I find its crispness refreshing in addition to its objective bitterness. Dark chocolate goes well with this (obviously) but it can hold its own if you're not in the mood for all that sweetness. No kidding, I even tried it with a toasted peanut butter and jelly sandwich and it was fantastic.  Overall, I really enjoy this beer. It's one I've introduced to several friends who are also stout fans and easily sits in my top 5 stouts.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Beerzebub,4.13,"Cheers to Michael Jackson.  Almost black. Small, finely textured tan head. Nice blotchy lace.  Smells mildly but pleasantly of sweet caramel, coffee, and breakfast cereal, with a bit of banana and some booze.  Tastes like espresso, with dark chocolate, moderately sweet, well balanced with assertive citrus and pine hop flavor and bitterness. Some licorice and mint. Some mild acidity. Some alcohol. Long hoppy finish like sweet citrus rind, with underlying roastiness and hop bitterness. Powerful and very enjoyable.  Fine carbonation, excellent mouthfeel, and quite drinkable.

Some of the great scents that are cultivated from an Imperial stout, coffee, cocoa, toffee, they are very subtle in the nose hope that they pick up in the taste. The taste of this one is not as strong as I was hoping. The toffee, and chocolate are present but they seem to be overpowered by the dried fruit taste that leaves almost a chewy presence in this thick brew. Moutfeel is smooth leading to a slight warming presence in the beer as it is sipped.

A: Pitch black with a mocha coffee colored two inch head that was achieved thru a decently quick pour. It bubbles down to about and inch with sticky lacing clinging to the sides of the glass that later fades into a thin cap until the finish.  Sweet dark fruits from the hops tied with a decent coffee and chocolate background, burt sugar. Damn inviting.  T/MF: Like the Old Rasputin this is one I don't even want to swollow. Not much carbonation but I wasn't expecting much. It starts out with a black coffee bitterness but then as it warms in the mouth the brew opens itself up and befcomes rich and fruity with a creamy smoothness, bitter chocolate to close with a bit of an alchohlic kick and in the end leaves the mouth sort of dry from the hops.  D: The only problem I found with this beer is that it is a bit too bitter for my tastes in this style category. The hops seem to take precedent here and after a few sips the hop oil coats the tongue enough to mask less robust flavors.

Looks like an oversized espresso in the glass. Deep dark black coffee like appearance with a thin dark khaki head found on only the best Cuban espresso. Some of the head sticks to the glass as I consume this bad boy leaving behind some lacing.  S: Very dark and earthy. Deeply roasted malts, fresh ground Cafe Bustello Cuban Coffee, Bakers Chocolate, and grassy hops.  T: Very nice. If this baby was coffee it would be a double espresso. There are tons of deep earthy flavors in the taste as well. Hershey's cocoa, espresso, dark charcoal roasted malt and quite possibly the most hops I have ever tasted in a stout. Very Interesting.  M: Medium bodied with a creamy quality about it.  D: Goes down rather smooth for an RIS. The taste clings to the mouth and throat letting the charcoaled taste linger.  Overall: This is my second Victory brew and to quote Borat it to is...Very Nice. The brew is big on flavor deep dark black flavor. This beer screams night everything about it is black. There are coffee, chocolate, and charcoal notes in both the aroma and the taste. It is a very nice tasting brew. If I had my way they would add a little sweetness to this one though.

This beer was a letdown 6 months ago, and I feel the same way now. There just doesn't seem to be much of that robust character that I love so much about my favorite Imperial Stouts. Rising above any chocolate or coffee flavors, is just an off-putting aspirin like bitterness. It just dominates.

Rich chocolate & caramel malt, spectacularly balanced with plenty of hop bitterness. There's more going on here than my palate can identify - but whatever it is, I love it.  M: Full body w/ carbonation just right. Smooth with just a slight hint of alcohol (warming w/ no burn) that doesn't interfere with the taste. Roasted coffee/expresso notes to go with the bittersweet chocolate in the great aftertaste.  D: This is too good to be slowed down by the 9+% abv. A truly fantastic beer. I will never tire of this.

Damn appealing appearance, overall. Nose attacks with the cocoa, some burnt sugar, a bit of port wine, and some very strong berry. So far so good. Big hit of chocolate (bittersweet) that fades into a a quick hoppy burst. Hang on, that hoppy bitterness sort transfers, as if by magic, into a roasted malt bitterness. Crazy. Mouthfeel is wonderfully full and creamy, though I might like a tad more velvet-like quality. As for drinkability, its practically gone. I'll be visiting this guy again soon.

Taste: The malts in this one are roasted something dark a great mark of a great Russian Imperial. Espreso notes show through so very well. Although it does taste somewhat traditional when it comes down this style. It has suttle qualities like few do. It's very full bodied and or wondefully heavy. The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth like melted dark chocolate.  Notes: This is the first brew I have ever had from Victory let me tell you this was a great first beer to try from Victory. If other beers from there have as much flavor for each of there repspective styles that they brew. I can hardly wait to try more. A great beer to be enjoyed certainly during the fall and winter months. But very nice all a cool night during the summer.

345,1013,SPLITGRIN,4.06,"I was able to pick up this legendary stout on a trip to Portland OR of all places even though I live only 6 hours from Penn.  A beautiful huge foamy milk chocalate colored head sits on top of this perfect jet black body. Heavy lacing is left as the head fades. Nose is a sweet cola induced malty feel with smokey notes that are almost meaty. Slightly thinner than I expected as I take my first sip. Slight hop bitter meets dark burnt malt bitter. Yerns for a bit more richness. Alchol is very well hidden until it hits the belly. Silks out overall, but the bitter stays strong. Mouthfeel stays along that same line. This is a drinkable stout, but I have many other prefrences in this stellar catagorie.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,rborthwick,4.52,Beer pours very dark and retains a tan creamy head. Some lacing present. Substantial mouthfeel that starts off with an fairly intense coffee taste with a fade to bitter chocolate...but not to bitter. This is a very tasty beer with a heavy malt taste that is well balanced with hops at the finish. You can tell this is a strong beer when you taste it but it has exceptional drinkability and you can get in trouble with this one if you get carried away.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,stemcell001,4.7,I had bought a six pack 6 months ago and cellared it. I decided to start trying it now before it got hot outside to drink too many heavy stouts. It pours a very dark body with a dark tan head. The smell has some very strong coffee aroma and a hint of bittersweet chocolate. The taste is very robust and yet pleasingly mild compared to when I last drank some of this a couple of months ago. There upfront taste has a lot of strong coffee notes with chocolate in the aftertaste and some hints of anise. I'm torn between finishing the six pack and waiting to see what this beer would taste like with a couple more months of cellaring.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,lonestar4lunch,4.35,"This is OUTSTANDING and very unexpected. Pours dark, pretty much black. Nice brown head that hangs around for a bit. Smell the roasted chocolate, coffee, hops and a bit of sweetness. Wow, can't wait to try this thing once the head sits down. Taste starts with the malt and finishes with the hops. From beginning to end is delicious. Has a rough feel but finishes very smooth and dry. Really leaves a roasted malt/hop taste that is really good. For 9% this is WAY to easy to drink. And for a RIS, I don't think it can get any better than this. Going to get a sixer this time and put some away. Very good. Was not expecting this at all.

Flavor does not disappoint - it is decidedly stouty with strong burnt overtone and coffee hints. Drinking this is almost like drinking spiked cold coffee.

I strongly recommend it to all stout lovers.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Dark Dark Dark black- when held to the light I could not see through to the other side, Pitch black ;) exactly how I like my stouts. Centimeter of creamy tan head- lots of carbonation- minimal lacing.  Smelled of roasted coffee beans and roasted nuts- some chocolate notes as well.  This is just how I like my stouts- lots of hops with the combination of coffee and dark chocolate. This is done perfectly. The ABV is well hidden in this although the warming is evident even with small sips.  This is just fabulous- will buy this over and over again.

S- Deep roasted coffee with hints of dark chocolate.  T- Good balance of malt, coffee and dark chocolate. Very bitter aftertaste that reminds me of strong coffee. Warm alcohol lingers.  M- Nice heavy body and medium carbonation. This is well done. Big and robust.  D- Its 9.1% ABV and you can tell. This would probably be a good breakfast brew or nice on a cold day.

The mouthfeel is appropriatley thick, but the hops cut through and make it way to drinkable for a 9% beer. The flavor is a great combination of malt and hops. The dark coffee and toffee flavors roll into the hops and it is just too good.

S- Thick strong coffee with hints of chocolate....roasted toasted malts that feel slightly burnt. Slight but crisp and assertive spicy resiny hops. Really an amazing scent. T- Roasted chocolate , and thick dark coffee....as thick as a really fine espresso. Resiny american hops help to lighten the beer....they really have a dank plant like feel and this is a difficult thing to do for a stout. The hops pick up in the middle of the body and carry on throughout the finish. M/D- Tick and heavy, but the american hops bring a unique side to this stout that I have not found in any other...the hops actually make this really dense alcoholic stout lighter and extremely drinkable. I have heard recent debate about this being some sort of an imperial brown ale, but I really feel that this is one of the finest stouts around,and coming from an east coast brewery too(this was a recent discussion on the BA message board).

The head never lasts as long as I would like it to;-)  Smell - Roasted malt, and a slight bit of alcohol. A little bit of hop smell too.  Taste - Delicious. Tastes very much like it smells. Coffee, bitter chocolate, roasted malt and hops.  Mouthfeel - Fantastic, medium to full bodied. Nearly perfect carbonation level.  Drinkability - One of the easiest drinking RISs I have had to date. I could easily drink two or three at a time, but I like to save my RISs for the last beer of the evening, that way a sixer will last through the week.  This is definitely my favorite RIS at this point, but I haven't had that many in my beer drinking career as of yet. I doubt my opinion of this beer will change much once I have tried other RISs, but one thing I can safely say is that this is Victory's best offering, and you should try it if you haven't yet.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

345,1013,tapman,3.85,"The thunder god of American Russian Imperial Stouts, I had a very enjoyable time with a six-pack of these beauties.  This brew poured an inky dark body with a brown head consisting of super-thick bubbles, not tiny ones like in lower quality beers. There is an awsome lacing and the brew stays pretty crisp even after 15 minutes drinking the same one as to enjoy i more.  True to the label, this beer is very malty, which I dig. If anyone has every been to Germany and have tried a Vita Malz (its like a non-alcoholic malt beverage for kids) then this is very similar in smell.  The maltiness pervades. Roasted mats five the beer a coffee flavor mixed with some sweet, tangy hops. Think an espresso while enjoying a plain biscotti; a honey-rye bread with your morning coffee. Notice I have yet to say it is alcoholy. It is more salt than alcohol I taste and I guessed a 7% before I saw the 9.1% on the label. Masks it very well.  The mouthfeel, however, is not as thick as I would have guessed it to be. Was expecting something thicker.  The lighter body actually helps when having a couple of these.

Poured from the bottle to a jet black with thick tan head that lingered well and left good lacing along the glass. Aroma was a very pleasing blend of malty chocolate and coffee, with alcohol scent entering around mid-glass. The taste was initially coffee, turning quickly to chocolate, all finishing with a sweet warming sensation and very good aftertaste.  Great job Victory!!!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,onehomesickalien,4.61,"This is one of the best imperial stouts you will find! If full bodied strong beers (both alcohol and flavor) is not your thing, then don't bother with this one. If they are... this is about as good as it gets.  A - Perfect pitch black like an imperial stout should be. Nice thick creamy head (but not out of control) that lasts most of the way down..  S - Roasted malts, coffee, very light raisin or date scent, and a presence of alcohol.  T - Awesome with every sip. Coffee, light hops, a somewhat bitter roasted malt along with a warm alcohol aftertaste. What makes this one so nice is that it does not knock you over with its flavor, just a solid, excellent beer.  M - Decent carbonation as well as maintaining an overall thickness. Beer sticks around, but not overwealming.

Pine and chewy grapefruit are front and center. Dry coffee and bitter chocolate provide the drying finish. Medium-thick body is a bit over-carbonated.

No one flavor over takes another. The roasted malts, The coffee. the hops, chocolate, caramel, licorice, and dark black rasberries.

Nice espresso crema head that forms pillowy with large bubbles on top, slow dissipation with some serious legs. Head holding upwards of 10-15 minutes, this one is staying around. Ends with a nice mocha-colored covering with nice lacing that decorates the glass. S: Espresso, brunt wood, smoke, sharp hops in the background. Coffee is fairly dominant. Very hoppy - citrus notes on top of the malt are wonderful. T: Stunning. Melted chocolate, dark chocolate, espresso all dominant. The hops really sharpen it, keep it original. Finishes a bit bitter, not quite as clean as I'd like. Alcohol is not apparent - 9.1%, no way. M: This is a really creamy, wonderful stout - with the head on top its initially the same sensation as drinking an aerated milkshake. Nice and sharp finish, really creamy body that is so smooth. D: This is a great stout, and I'm excited to have this brewey now distributing in GA. Creamy, espresso, chocolate and hops - what else do you want?

345,1013,czechsaaz,4.08,"Smell is not what I would look for in a stout. There's some chocolate and coffee notes but really no roast malt character at all. On the fermentation/yeast side I get ripe fruit but not plums or cherries like I'd expect and more like peaches and tropical aromas. In fact, aroma wise it seems more like a Belgian ale. I sampled bottles in 2 different settings and sources before reviewing this, my third and they all smelled that way. I like the aroma but it's out of the ordinary for RIS.  Deep, dark and held up to the light, nothing gets through. Very small head that appeared on pouring disappears right away leaving not much behine except a small island of tiny bubbles in the center of my glass. (Big head is not necessarily a negative in this style.)  Nice flavor and here's where I find some roast malt. It has a complex smokey roast flavor but with significant sweet malt and molasses backbone. Nice level on the bittering hops, assertive but not enough to overwhelm the malt. Lots of fruity fermentation flavors and again more in line with what I'm looking for. Little bits of chocolate flavor rounds it out. Nice complexity and overall flavor profile is really good.  Big full bodied with a pretty strong level of carbonation. Creamy on the palate.

Smell is sour malt, bitter chocolate, espresso, roasted malts. I was surprised by the pronounced sour smell. Not bad, just not what I was expecting.  Taste follows the smell spot on, with a notable roasted malt bitterness. Notable and pervasive long metallic hops bitterness from this first taste through the finish.  Mouthfeel is a bit thin for an RIS. Carbonation is smooth and fine.  On the low end of the alcohol scale for an RIS, so it's pretty drinkable.  Overall, this seems to be a ""Lite RIS:"" not as robust as others in all aspects. Pretty good, but not what I was expecting based on the numbers I saw in the other reviews. Due to the heavy hopping this seems more like an ADS than and RIS, which I was expecting would be much syrupier. Oh well, live and learn.

Below, the body shows the barest bits of ruby when backlit, but is otherwise opaque black. The nose is full of toasted chocolate maltiness, with some coffee interplay. Straightforward, but intense. The taste is a bit mellower than I remember, but pretty much echoes the smell. It's fairly sweet too, and invites another sip. Not overly complex, but it works. The mouth is thin for an Impy, but it works well with the lighter flavor profile of this beer. Low carbonation, too.

Taste: Roasted coffee and dark chocolate accompany the nuttiness from the aroma. There's some underlying hops, not as much as many american ris' but they provide a nice citrus aftertaste to accompany the coffee.  Mouthfeel: Quite bitter and not as creamy as some.

The appearance if phenomenal, with that dark black color, surrounded by caramel colored head. After settling, the head completely disappeared.  As far as the taste, it has the chocolate coco flavor with smoked malt, somewhat woody flavor. It's obvious from the first sip that it is well crafted. It's certainly bitter, but it's appropriate for the style.  Overall, Storm King reminds me of a cross between Brooklyn's Dark Chocolate Stout and Weyerbacher's Old Heathen.

The flavor is much more hops-centric, but I'm left wishing there was more malt. There's a chocolate liquor aroma. The taste is dominated by biting, citrus hops and tinge of something like alcohol. As my beer warms up, more chocolate is starting to come through. This reminds me of Surly's Darkness quite a bit, but I wouldn't say Storm King can stand up to it.

A: Poured a thick dark reddish brown that I'd call black if not for the hints of color on the edges of the glass. Thin brown head dissipates somewhat disappointing quickly, leaving minimal lacing and a very small crown.  S: Roasted malty sweetness with a coffee/espresso and chocolate character. Definite hop character. Floral hops to be sure, just as the bottle says. What I'm getting is not very aggressive by itself, but when the beer hits your lips it's much more evident. I'm thinking that without the head, I'm missing out on something. Bad batch perhaps...  T: Really, really rich and chocolately. Dark roasted malty sweetness with tons of that espresso character and immediate hoppy bitterness. The hops are pretty well balanced, contributing very well to the flavor and offering just the right amount of bitterness, I'd say. Certainly leaves an interesting and enjoyable mix of flavors on your tongue. Also probably want to mention that the alcoholic aspect is expertly concealed by the other flavors.  M: Now to be honest, it's been an enjoyable beer but I'm definitely thinking I've got a bad batch here. Didn't see much head, so smell wasn't as prominent as I'd expect, and the mouthfeel is almost...bland? Not much in the way of carbonation at all, so it's pretty smooth, and it's got a medium body, but I feel that it should be fuller. I don't know, something really off about the feel. Tastes good, but lacking in other regards.  D: Well, flavors are nice, I can't pick up on the alcoholic content, and this particular example is smooth and not as full, so it's drinkable. I just feel like something's off, that this is a misrepresentation, 've had much better RISs and if this was really what Storm King was all about, I wouldn't choose it over other examples.  Pity.

The aroma and tastes are filled with dark roasted espresso and chocolate and there is a little hoppy aftertaste that is enjoyable as well.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,dickieb,4.26,"Poors as Dark as anything i have ever seen, with a thin brown head, that kinda hangs onto the glass. Quite the aroma, with some coffee, chocolate, and i pick up som soy sauce. Taste is equaly as complex, starting with the coffee and chocolate, and a really good hop finish. The mouthfeel is light for the style, and it works out to be about a quite drinakble RIS. This is cirtanly the beer that turned me onto the style",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,guinness72384,4.38,"Ahh...the Storm King Stout  Picked up a 6-pk last weekend to see what it was all about. I was not disappointed.  Pours extremely dark with a 1 inch head and great lacing. Smell is exceptional, dark roasted espresso, with strong chocolate aromas. Taste is great as well, very malty with that strong espresso flavor, not quite as smooth as I hoped for but very, very good. Great texture and flavor, definately a highly drinkable beer. If you are a stout fan you will not be disappointed.  Happy Drinking!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,jdg204,4.62,"Finally got to review one of the original brews that intro'd me to great beer about 9 months ago. Victory's RIS is one of the best and deserving of the high praise it receives.  Appearance - Beautiful pitch black color with a nice coffee colored head.  Smell - Fantastic sweet, coffee, raisiny, chocolately, spicey odor. The all blend together wonderfully to create a classic brew.  Taste - The sweet, coffee flavors come through at first and most strongly, but then they are followed by a very significant roasted/hop bitterness which provides a complimentary aftertaste.  Mouthfeel - Very nice mouthfeel with good consistency and a very nice aftertaste which leaves the drinker quite comforted.  Drinkability - An excellent brew to be sure, though I have to say I remember it being a bit less hoppy and bitter the first time around. Still this RIS is amazing and Victory has another winner in my book. I look most forward to reviewing the rest of the line from my fav brewers in Downingtown.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,MiScusi,3.55,"Poured from a 12oz bottle with an enjoy before date of 3/22/11  Pours a deep deep black brown with a tan frothy 2 finger head. The smell jumps out quite nicely with lots of roasted barley and lots of chocolate too. A thin tan cap stays for a very long time.  The taste has lots of roasted bitterness, and lots of hops up front too, and a coffee finish. Alcohol is noticeable right away and kinda lingers in the finish with some acidity.  The mouthfeel is medium but surprisingly not too thick, which I think works well for the flavor profile of this beer. This imperial stout is more ""stouty"" than other imperial stouts I've had, with Storm King being more heavy on the roasted character and less on the chocolate and coffee. As far as imperial stouts go this wasn't my complete cup of tea.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,brdc,3.33,"It pours a beautiful black with a very foamy head that disappears very fast, although leaving some sticky lacing behind. The nose is surprisingly hoppy and almost unidimensional, since the minimal malts, mostly chocolate-like are overpowered by the hops. A similar thing happens on the taste, which starts hoppy, evolves hoppy and finishes hoppy. Somwhere in there, chocolate and coffee, but these are overpowered by the hops. It is a medium-bodied, somewhat pleasant brew that is unfortunately poor balanced, with little malts to face the hoppy explosion. You might like it, but it is not a good example of a stout in my opinion.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,drseamus,4.28,"This beer pours jet black with a very thick mocha colored head. The head hangs around for a long time and leaves a bit of lacing on the glass. I get a bunch of coffee aromas off of this beer with some malt in there too. The flavor is a lot smoother than I would have expected, especially for a RIS. It has a very roasty flavor with some sweetness from the malt. That sweetness is balanced by the bitterness of the hops. It is a good full bodied beer and all things considered, a good beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,SkeeterHawk,4.64,"Appearance: Pours super dark black with a small 1/4"" head of tight tan bubbles. The beer has quite a few bubbles rising, but this doesn't maintain the head. The head falls within about 30 seconds to end up as a small ring around the top of the glass. Later the beer looked pretty still.  Aroma: Wow! I get clean chocolate malt along with some roast and a good dose of floral hops in the mix, and this is only the first sniff. There is some serious alcoholic notes coming out as both spice and a oxidative plum-like effect from the malt. As you swirl the beer, there is some alcohol as well as a good bit of fruitiness, but the beer doesn't have an overly acidic edge as some Russian Imperial Stouts do.  Taste: The flavor doesn't hide the strength as it gives you a warming effect pretty much right away. There is a good bit of roast as well as some toasty notes in there, but the alcohol is probably the biggest player here. There is a bunch of hops in this beer. They come across as lending a dry bitter edge to the finish as well as a bouquet of floral flavors that fade in and out throughout the flavor profile. After the hops get through, there is some alcohol that warms up the finish and stays a contender long into the finish.  Opinion: This is an excellent beer, and I am so glad that it is available in the Houston area...at least for now. This beer has complexity and balance so that it is pleasing to the palate at just about every turn. It is very difficult to come up with any flaw in this beer. If you were to twist my arm, I would probably think that the hops should play a bit smaller role and that some toasty malts should take its place...other than this, I have nothing to contribute and I would drink this beer just about any time the opportunity presented itself.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Damian,3.62,"Drank from a 12 fl. oz. bottle purchased at Julio's Liquors, Westboro, MA Bottle label read ""Enjoy by Jan 02 12""  Poured a thick, translucent, pitch black with no head but rather a thin, bubbly, coffee-colored film of lace that quickly disappeared.  Aroma was mellow and smooth, and quite subdued initially. Roasted malts, coffee ground and some dark chocolate were noticeable. A touch of crisp hops hid in the background. As the beer warmed, the aroma changed drastically. Oaky and boozy notes became progressively stronger, as the nose took on an almost bourbon-like quality.  Taste was bold, intense and super hoppy (even for an imperial stout). Some roasted malts were present up front before the hops took over. Charred and burnt flavors became noticeable mid-palate but they were quickly overshadowed by the hops. The hops crescendoed into the incredibly long-lasting, intensely minty and piney finish. (After every sip, I felt like I had just brushed my teeth.) Alcohol was remarkably subdued at 9.1% ABV.  Mouthfeel was huge, thick, viscous and chewy with a spritzy effervescence to liven things up. The liquid coated my palate like a blanket.  Overall, this beer was somewhat of a challenge to drink. The mix of charred malts and astringent, bitter hops was a bit overwhelming. I felt like the beer could have benefited from more balance, preferably by means of sweeter, richer and more intense malt flavors.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,bahumutx,4.42,"Served from a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. This particular bottle was bottled on October 12, 2005.  Appearance: Poured very dark. Hardly any light shines through. Had a very small head.  Smell: Coffee, Toasted Malt, and sweetness. Slight hop aroma.  Taste: Starts with a coffee like tastes and slight hint of hops. Finishes very sweet but not too sweet. The hops of blended well into this beer as it as aged and compliment the sweetness very nice now. This beer aged great and I wish I had some more from this bottle date.  Mouthfeel: Smooth but thick Mouthfeel with the right amount of carbonation.  Drinkability: Very drinkable after being aged. I could have a few of these in a sitting  Great beer to age. It only gets better with time. Great job Victory!!!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,beersarang,4.8,"Had this at a beer festival,  Poured a near black with deep tan head that left generous lacing. Did not appear as syrupy as some Imperial stouts can be.  Coffee and chocolate aromas come in strong, jump out of glass. Alcohol plays with chocolate, very pleasant, true to style.  A deep sip brings a firm malt character that fades into bitterness from both the hops and the coffee character. Finishes with chocolate and sweet alcohol. Wonderful.  Medium bodied but gives a definite creamy sensation. Excellent mouthfeel without the slick alcohol.  Very drinkable, and very dangerous.  A solid and one of the best Imperial stouts.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,prototypic,4.5,"Appearance: Pours a dark, dark brown color (almost a jet black) with a thick and creamy two finger head. Good retention and lacing.  Smell: Mostly smells of espresso and dark chocolate. After swirling, a nice malty aroma emerged along with toasted nuts and a smoky smell. After really digging around, a faint hop smell shines through.  Taste: Mostly tastes of coffee or espresso and dark chocolate. It actually has a creamy taste to it, which really adds something for me. It does have a slight bit of a toasty or smoked taste. Nice malt presence. Again, hops are faint.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's medium bodied. But, it's very creamy and smooth. At 9%, it's very easy to drink. Too easy. Alcohol is masked extremely well. Overall, this is a very, very good imperial stout. Highly recommended.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,GimpyCane,4.5,"Finally found this gem at Andersons in Columbus. Vigorously poured, that created an 8 inch (no lie) creamy mocha brown head that cascaded into a jet black liquid with a caramel light shinning through. The head left an excellent amount of sticky lace all over the glass. The strong scent of coffee comes screaming at you with a nice blend of dark bread and roasted caramel in the middle. I could also make out vanilla, molasses and alcohol. The initial taste was malty sweet with a long dark chocolate and espresso coffee bitter aftertaste. Aside being rich and smooth, the body felt medium to full with a creamy almost syrupy texture, soft carbonated and slight alcohol bite to warm the body. Overall, this brew rocks. Enjoy",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,techdiver,4.68,"Pours a dense brownish black with nice two finger head that leaves nice lacing behind.  Not much nose to it. What's there is usual roasted malt with hints of coffee and licorice.  Taste is right up there with Expedition, and Stone. Well balanced with just the right touch of sweetness.  Mouthfeel is so smooth and carbonation enough to add crispness that makes it feel lighter.  Drinkability quite good as well, probably the most drinkable IRS I've had.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,TexIndy,3.51,"Poured from a 12oz bottle with a best by date on the front label. It was a solid black with a thick brownish head that stuck around for a long time before settling to a thin foam. The smell was very weak and without any dominant trait. Even the dark malts were muted. The taste was good but nothing stellar. It had a pretty bitter end that kept my score down. It's my first RIS so maybe that's the style but missed the mark for me.

345,1013,Redwood21,4.09,"A: awesome jet black color with a coffee colored head. The head seems to stick around and is forthy.  S: There is an aroma to this beer? could have fooled me. usually stouts are more fragrant, this one is lacking in that regard. It seems to have a slight coffee chocolate aroma, but so faint its hard to pinpoint.  T: Reminds me a bit of anchor porter. smooth slighty coffee, chocolate. not sure, very nice though. The higher alcohol is somewhat noticeable, but not as much as one might think.  M: Very creamy nice, a little drying of the room of my mouth, but nice regardless  D: One of the most ""drinkable"" stouts ive tried. very easy to consume considering the abv.

345,1013,udubdawg,4.13,"12 oz bottle, best by 2011 - I think it's still safe.  Pours black with an impressive but not lingering dark brown head. Nice lacing throughout.  Nose ranks well behind the taste, but what there is is full of coffee, heavy roasty malt notes, and liquorice. Just a suggestion of the hop bitterness to follow.  Nice taste. The bitterness is notable right away, but perhaps this is because it isn't everyday you see this. Behind the loads of dark roast coffee and chocolate richness, besides the hint of vanilla, is a lot of residual sweetness - almost fruity. No, not almost - it IS fruity...berry? More big sweet coffee bitterness in the aftertaste. This'll be with me a while.  Really nice full mouthfeel with a wicked smoothless. Carbonation on the low side. Alcohol warming, but not unpleasantly so.  Quite drinkable for the strength, but if fresh I'll stop at one. Let it age a year and I'm likely to have more.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,YankChef,4.72,"Poured out of a 12 oz. bottle with a label indicating enjoy by nov. 1st, 2011... Into a snifter.  Appearance: pours a pittch black with a respectable 2 finger burnt orange colored head that sticks to the glass well.  Smell: Sweet smells of chocolate, toffe and espresso. Also of leather  Taste: Wow, and to think i made a car bomb out of this in total ignorance. (which was fantastic tho by the way) taste of bitter sweet chocolate, roast espresso beans and a definite hop presence that is superbly balance by a very strong malt. Lingering taste of burnt sugar and almost a tannic flavor.  Mouthfeel: I would rate this as somewhere between light and medium bodied and it certainly coats your mouth with flavors of roast espresso and burnt sugar  Drinkability: I rated this lowest of all for the burnt linger flavors and high alcohol content tend to push this one out of the realm of a ""session beer""  Overall: Truely an excellent beer from Victory and a frequent in my fridge.

345,1013,IgnatiusReilly,4.56,"Poured from 12oz bottle into snifter. Home.  A: Pours a thick, syrupy pitch black liquid with a tan head. Slow cascade as it settles in the glass. The head is only about one finger thick and settles pretty quickly. Little lace down the side of the glass, but doesnt hang around long . S: Some mild hop aroma with a little nutty grain. Nothing significant really jumps out at you. T: Delicious. Tastes like my coffee on steroids. Lots of roasted coffee/espresso flavors with a pretty strong bitter hop balance. Some malt sweetness comes through, with some fruity blackberry tones, with some charcoal, earthy, grain notes and dark chocolate bitterness as well. Finishes with a nice alcohol glow. Long after the sip, the hops linger in the mouth with a notable bitterness. M: Very low carbonation. Thick but not overly viscous. D: Very, and with all the complex flavors its required to have more than one to see everything thats happening in this beer.  Very good stout. Great for a cold, winter night.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,RidiculedDisplay,4.22,"Ah, my first review and first craft beer in some 30 days. Excellent.  Appearance: Pours with a quarter-finger's worth of tan head, which is milky in its bubble pattering. Settles into a surface haze of the same color. Lacing is a fine mist-like thing, with spots covering the sides of the glass. Not particularly impressive, but it gets points for a) existing and b) being consistent throughout each swirl. The body is a rather uninspiring shade of stout dark brownish black, which is not particularly solid given how large of an RIS this is supposed to be.  Smell: Deep boozy dark fruits, including plums, raisins, along with notes of bread, some mild oakiness but a more general undefinable woodsiness. Dark chocolates pervade the chocolate profile, with some bittersweet and hints of smoothness suggesting milk varieties. Dried cranberries, some grape and apple qualities. Alcohol, which is very present, at least in the nose, but does not, remarkably, overpower the individual aromas. I detect little in the way of coffee or espresso in this nose, personally. It's there, in a bitter sharpness on the back end, but it's a bit of a reach, in my opinion.  Taste: Wow, this is a bad ass stout. I was wondering when I would taste the hop flavors others were noticing, and there they are. Deep bitter orange rind and lemon zest with a bisection of pine. Just absolutely bitter on the tongue. There the espresso shines through, the bitterness registering more on that scale than on the hops IBU variety. Additionally, the back end reveals more of this. Absolutely delicious flavor, like an Italian espresso or Turkish coffee it's so strong. Very bitter dark chocolate. A little dried raisin and cranberry on the upswing. This is a very powerful stout with better balance than other stouts in its ""weight class,"" so to speak, but it still manages to miss the balance mark ever so slightly, I think.  Mouthfeel: Thick and bitter, with a fair amount of carbonation. Liqeur-like almost.  Drinkability: A definite sipper.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,BuckSpin,4.08,"Presentation: c.2004 11oz bottle (Bottled date of 12/23/04) cellared in my possession for 2 years, in a classic conical pint glass  Before the review, a little story:  In March of 2005 I joined BA. During that month I went to Philadelphia for software training. On my way back I stopped at Victory and bought six 6 packs of various Victory beers plus a few wiretops. The Storm King I am about to enjoy and post as my 199th review is the lone remaining survivor of those original 36 beers. It has been cellared for 2 years, plus survived trips from Philly to Western PA, then to midcoast Maine. Its time...  Poured thick but not viscous, slick, oily. Nose is still hopped very nicely, sticky pine resin, warming alcohol, soft grapefruit, warm raisins. After resting & opening, faint, dull malts are noticeable, slightly mineral, lukewarm leftover coffee and even leathery tannins, the citrus fruits ripen and sweeten as the hops fade some. Head, even after all this time and the inherent high ABV, did not disappoint as it was a beautiful 2 fingers of tight, various sized latte hued foam that lasted for minutes before settling to a 1/8"" covering that laced nicely in rings, very sticky. After a while it reduces to just a glass ring and sporadic lacing.  Color is almost black. Imagine the darkest blood red rose you've ever seen, and now imagine trying to see it by moonlight and thats close to what the glass edges barely review. Interior is opaque & black in a good mood, uber dark burnt umber.  Oh, this is nice. The hops have taken on a lovely grapefruited-citrus, oily, sticky quality. The tangy bite (not obnoxious but definitely demanding attention) rides over a pleasing, warm raisin quality. I can tell after one taste this is going to require, ney, demand a slow sipping session....cool. Mild bitter coffee tones are also present on the tongue, but the oily, citrused hops are the star. As it warms on the palate the hops give way to a very pleasing black coffee & milk chocolate taste (not mocha, but both noticeable and unique) that is welcomingly creamy and almost dairy like.  With some more blooming the initial citrusy hops become sweeter, amazing qualities of warm semi-sweet apple (Macintosh), overripe apricot, but in very hushed tones. The palate continues to get creamier and sweeter with chocolate, earthy malts, even some nuts.  The finish is odd yet nice - a wet, slightly syrupy, hand in hand joining of the initial oily hops and the semi-sweet, creamy chocolate palate. The sensation is unusual yet pleasing (chocolate & citrus go surprisingly well together). Aside from the alcoholic echoes each swallow induces into my sinus cavities, its a pleasing, very warm, coating and chewy bittersweet sheen covering my entire mouth. A final comment is some noticeable sediment on the glass bottom.  Very unusual & very enjoyable. Its amazing after 2 years the hop profile remains such a dominant role, but its evolution into the oily, citrus style is very nice. Cellaring certainly didn't hurt this in the least, and I am very curious as to how it would handle longer cellaring periods. Based on this one I feel pretty confident it could go 3-5 no problem, and it would be interesting to see how long before the hops do tone down to really allow other flavors to shine. A fine Imperial Stout, and excellent candidate for long term cellaring.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,cichief,4.58,"Purchased six-pack of this.  A- It poured jet black, with a half inch of brown foam. It poured as if was quite thick.  S- It smelled of roasted barley, coffee, and chocolate.  T- It explodes in the mouth, tastes of coffee and citrus. Surprisingly, no alcohol burn for a beer of this strength.  M- Very smooth, it covers the tongue and engulfs the mouth, almost perfect.  D- This beer, with the alcohol strength, could be dangerous, it is so tasty.  In the past week I have ran a mini taste session of Imperial Stouts, Old Rasputin, Brooklyn Black Chocolate, and finally, Storm King. I would say, Storm King is the winner, with Brooklyn second, and Old Rasputin third. I will seek out a few more to add to the next tasting.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,karengarys,3.83,"This pours darker than the oil in my car (changed every 30,000 if it needs it or not...). Leaves little head. I predict this is a thick brew....  Smells malty with a bit of citrus...  Taste is rather... interesting... Grapefruit peel, malts, molasses, and a bit of an edgy thinner like flavor - alcohol I take it, but it is a bit sharp.  Mouthfeel is amazing for a beer like this - creamy.  Finish is clean, leaving a touch of that thinner-like flavor I didn't like in the taste.  This is a quite drinkable beer. It hides the alcohol flavor TOO well. I recommend giving this a try!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,session1979,4.42,"12oz bottle - Glass was a Ridel brandy snifter.  Appearance: Black as the night sky with a nice dark 2 finger head.

Dark chocolate and espresso on the beautifully long finish. Fantastic.  Mouthfeel: Very nice mouth, medium thickness, nice creamy texture. Very nice carbonation level, not overdone.  Drinkability: Very drinkable for the style. Don't be surprised if you have a few..  Overall: This is one of the best, if not the best ""6 pack"" stouts I have found to date. I always keep this on hand. Great beer!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,demcorhip,4.38,"Appearance Pours black as coal, the body is too dark to allow any light through. A decent two finger head much like espresso crema formed on a standard pour. A fine yet full ring of lacings rings the glass, the lacings are slightly sticky and cling forming a web like pattern.  Aroma A good amount of grapefruit and other citrus evident from the hops, dominating the nose of this brew. Creamy nuts, chocolate, some espresso, and a strong roasted character with anise and smoke present.  Taste Tasting does this brew more justice than the nose alone, as some of the flavours hidden by big juicy hop aromas reveal themselves, along with the depth and character of this brew. Somewhat strong hints of anise and smokey roastiness, mochaccino, and some nutty treacle quickly morph into the more bitter west coast grapefruit hop bitterness, as well as a more floral and earthy hop character.  Mouthfeel This is a big, full bodied stout and is all around rich, from its malts, roasted character, and its hop bite. The hops really manage to assert themselves, even through the rich malt backbone. The grapefruit hoppiness blends nicely with the roastiness, exaggerating the flavour of anise, as well as providing an almost lingering hop bitterness.  Drinkability Very enjoyable and drinkable for such a big brew. The PNW hops work great with this stout. Perfect for a cool wintry night, or for calling the first thunderstorms of the year on the first night of spring as i did last night. Would recommend familiarity and appreciation of IPAs and RISs before taking on this storm, with its bold depth of flavour. Will gladly drink this one again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,nickfl,4.47,"A - Totally black, a slight hint of amber/ tan at the bottom when held up directly to a lightbulb. Pours with a small, but very dense, dark khaki head. Head retention is good for a high alcohol beer, drops down to a thick film and leaves behind dense laceing.  S - Chocolate, coffee, roast malt. Biscuity aroma, really smells of baked goods and dark chocolate.  T - Sweet, dry chocolate flavor, with a smooth, velvety hop finish. Malty, bready caramel, and an odd minty note.  M - Smooth, thick, and maby just a little bit oily. The body on this beer is close to perfect for an imperial stout.  D - Despite being an intense and interesting beer, this may be the most drinkable imperial stout I have ever had. The heavy hopping gives it a little harsh bitternes, but it is necissary to balance the flavors and it works perfectly to bring out the intense dark chocolate flavors.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

345,1013,kpantz,3.98,"Executive Summary: Victory brewers are masters at their craft, and you need look no further than Storm King as solid evidence. Not only is the Storm King an imposing imperial stout (""imposing"" is a requirement in my book)...it is a flavorful, quite drinkable adventure that makes it one of the few in this style that could pass for a session beer.  Appearance: Pours a viciously opaque deep brown/black into my tulip. Fluffy tan head, resting at about a finger thick. Nice lacing.  Smell: Roasted malts, coffee, molasses, licorice.  Taste: Deeply roasted malts with some associated sweetness give way to a slightly acidic coffee flavor, followed quickly by a nice hop flavor and associated bitterness. No noticeable alcohol flavors, even as it approaches room temperature.  Mouthfeel: Not as chewy as I remember previous incarnations, but pretty thick in its own right. Slightly sticky as it warms, with a lively but not overbearing carbonation level. Very, very smooth.  Drinkability: Highly, highly drinkable for an impy stout. Good balance of malt, hops and adjuncts make this an interesting brew to play with to see what new flavors you can discern. 9+% ABV is well hidden in this one, so be wary - it can sneak up on you.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

345,1013,stereosforgeeks,4.79,"Appearance: Poured a gorgeous dark, near-black into my pint glass. There was minimal head present when I received my glass from the bartender.  Smell: The bar was crowded and smoky but the beer still persevered through the smell and the roasted chocolate and coffee. There seemed to be some faint dark fruits present as well, but they were hard to distinguish.  Taste: The chocolate and dark fruits explode in the mouth. The cofee presence helps balance the alcohol across the palate and it finish with a nice hop bitterness. The aftertase seems to be of some bakers chocolate.  Mouthfeel: Not as heavy as one would expect but with enough depth to coat your mouth with flavors.  Drinkability: I ended up drinking a couple of these at the bar tonight to the detriment of my sobriety, but I couldn't help myself.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,kajerm,3.55,"Pours with a thin, dark tan head and a little lacing. There is no way in hell that a single photon is passing this monstrous black gravity well of a beer.  The nose is alcohol and strangely astringent hops. This is going to be interesting...  Very tasty beer, very poor style example. It tastes dry, shockingly hoppy with some phenolic character-- unusual to say the least. There is a solid dark malt backbone that sits in the background owing to the powerful hop flavor. There's some very slight mid-palate biscuity flavor; so slight that I might be hallucinating it. Finishes strong, with hop bitterness. Not what I expected from an imperial stout, but holy shit, it is delicious.  Mouthfeel is surprisingly thin and carbonated, but it's somehow fitting for the beer, especially given the strong hop character.  There are about a thousand reviews of ""dangerously drinkable"" beers. At 9.1% ABV, this beer borders on a date rape drug in its drinkability.  RERATE: Apparently this review was written back when I valued style over substance. The truth is, this review liked the beer way more than I did-- it actually turned me off hoppy stouts until Darkness came along and rocked my palate. I saved a bottle for over a year now with one, and only one purpose in mind-- ruthlessly kill all the hops in this beer. So down to business.  The aroma tells me one thing-- I succeeded. It's coffee, chocolatey, and sort of musty with a heavy background of dark malts. No lupulin in evidence. Flavor profile opens up malty, and finishes a bit more astringent than I would have liked, but nowhere near, say, Old Rasputin or Nogne Ø. Every flavor has mellowed out nicely-- this beer tastes like an imperial stout that has gone into retirement. It's not bad at all, and pretty drinkable. My main gripe would be with the body, which is closer to beer than molasses-- not what I look for in my impies.  This isn't going to become my favorite beer anytime soon, but if I ever happen to get a hold of more, now I know what to do-- lay it down.  (Damn, I'm a wordy bastard today.)",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,goochpunch,2.95,"Best by 2011 or something like that.  Pours out a beautiful pitch black with tawny port hues on the edges of the glass. Head is a chocolatey brown and maintains rather well in spite of the size of the beer. Viscous. Smell is at first of pungent hops like this was a DIPA or something. Lots of citrus oils and alcohol in the nose. underneath this I get some chocolate and dark roast coffee. With the taste, again, big hops up front but it works better than with the smell because the chocolate flavors mix well with it. Finish is all hop oiliness and astringent burnt malts. Unpleasant lingering bitterness. The weight of this beer in the mouth is solid, but the carbonation needs to take it easy. I'm not crazy about it, but if offered to me, I wouldn't turn it down, I guess. HYPE.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,khiasmus,4.67,"A- Looks like thick coffee. Pours a dark brown with a light tan head that settles to a thin lace quickly.  S- Wonderful. Piney hops with thick, sweet malt that leaves a heavy sensation in the nose, one that makes you want to smell it and savor for hours before you drink it.  T- The only reason this doesn't get a 5 is the slight metallic note. That's the only reason. Strong hops, strong malt, perfect balance but dense and intense.  M- Well carbonated but smooth, thick but light. This mouthfeel is perfect.  D- One of the easiest imperial stouts around to drink. Dangerous for the alcohol content.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,atsprings,4.47,"Poured a dark opaque black with a decent light tan head. The aroma was of dark chocolate, roasted espresso and roasted barley, very true to the style. The taste was a very great blend of coffee, cocoa and roasted barley, also very true to the style, but much better than most. This beer is very smooth on the palate for one so strong. The carbonation is very tolerable and the alcohol well hidden. This is a great beer on a cold night or even a mild early spring evening.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,sethmeister,4.33,"12oz into my rapscallion goblet, at cellar temp  Pours black with a finger of soft taupe head. A bit of lacing as head quickly recedes.  Scent of bitter dark chocolate, cold espresso and alcohol.  Unsweetened bitter dark chocolate, cold espresso and roasted / burnt flavor. No aftertaste and it clears the palate quickly. This beer is not sweet at all. A bit more bitter than I might ideally wish for.  The mouthfeel is what defines this stout for me. Intensely full, thick, rich, creamy and lush. Has an impressive weight and density. I honestly can't imagine a more delightful mouthfeel.  This is really a nice Imperial Stout.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,TheWhaleShark,4.43,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.  A: Poured black with a dark tan or chocolate head, about 2 fingers. This dissipated into a nice lacing that stuck around.  S: Chocolate and coffee all the way, along with a lot of dark roasted scent.  T: Dear god, this is good. Hoppier than most RIS, in that they're fairly pronouced up front but then give way to the coffee and chocolate flavors. The malt is surprisingly sweet; I would've expected a bit more bitterness in such a dark beer. The finish is more of the same, though it is somewhat astringent.  M: This is the definition of full-bodied. It's not syrupy or cloying; it simply has presence that dominates the palate. Excellent overall.  D: Very drinkable, though alcohol content limits the practical amount of this you can drink.  Possibly the best RIS I've tasted so far.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,notoriousdav,4,"I have to agree with the Alstrom bros on this one: this beer has gone a little out of whack. It pours a beautiful black and has a nice creamy carmel head, and it smells like the real deal. But, unfortunately, this beer has become really bitter (emphasis on really). I don't think I could drink more than one a night, and I love bitter. For some reason, I remember this beer being a little more in balance when I tried it a few years ago.  **edit**  After giving the rest of this six pack a try, I have grown to really like this beer; yeah it's bitter as all hell, but once you start to embrace that, other stouts seem flat-out week. In fact, I wouldn't drink another stout within the same week to avoid making the others seem bland. I guess you just need to get your taste buds up for the challenge on this one.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,StoutPiper,4.19,"Beer has a one to two finger head that dissipates quickly.  Mouthfeel is v ery sharp, heavy carbonation for an imperial.  The taste is very strong, espresso and hops. Mellows into a wonderful complex aftertase that makes the stout exceptional. Majpr flavors of mocha, nuts, hops, and caramel.  Make sure to serve rom temperature.  This is by far my favoite imperial stout, a stout lovers' beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,leedorham,4,Pours a dark brown to black with a 2 finger head. Strong lacing.  At first sniff the aroma seems dead then very hoppy on closer inspection. Strong biscuity malty undertones.  Very full hop flavor that is more up front than a typical impy. The hops are definitely the star of the show. Good full flavor. A little more watery than I was expecting.  Strong offering and a great value in an imperial for my price.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,MICAMD,4.42,"Bottled on October 31, 2005  A- Poured a black liquid with a surprising amount of carbonation that gives way to a caramel colored two finger thick head. Quite a few tan floaties eventually make their way to the bottom of the glass. Some light can get through the edges of this one.  S- Hops. Wait a second, this is a RIS. Interesting. Delving further, I pick out some chocolate, coffee, and a good amount of roasted malts. Even after how long I have let this sit, the hops are still extremely present.  T- Same as the smell, but I pick up on some smokiness and some caramle in there too.  M- A little on the thin side for this style. Could be attributed to the amount of carbonation of this.  D- This is a good unique RIS. The hops and thinness of the mouthfeel are the only thing that throws me off on the drinkability.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Budlum,4.18,"Pouring this beer produces one and one half inch of creamy tan head. The body is a deep black color allowing only small amounts of light to pass through at the bottom of the glass. Head retention and lacing are very good.  The nose of this beer is faint but it presents excellent qualities. Rich cocoa and espresso smells blend simultaneously with a salty, roasted barley aroma. Hops are quite strong backed by a sharp smokiness.  A powerful wave of strong, smoky barley flavors lead this stout with quite a punch. The hop flavors of this stout present balanced bitterness. This batch of Storm King seems to have a stronger hop presence than previous years. The finish features fading hops blended with a background of espresso and more strong barley tastes.  The mouthfeel is very good. The level of carbonation and thickness is right on. The strong hops and alcohol content provide a lively feel as well.  Drinkability is very good. The balance leans a touch to the hoppy side but for a stout of this caliber it is just too easy to drink. This is a very sessionable stout.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,stevegamburg,5,Pours black with a semi-thick head. Smells of black malt and dark fruit with a noticeable hop aroma. The taste is huge and complex with a larger hop presence than most Imperial Stouts but it is very well balanced. The finish has a nice hint of espresso.  I can't understand some of the low ratings.  Take it from someone who drinks stouts almost exclusively: This is a spectacular Imperial Stout - One of the best that I have ever had.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,jackorain,3.37,"Let me start by saying that I love to support my local brewers. Love Victory, Troegs, Lancaster, DFH, etc. That being said, this one doesn't live up to my expectations. It is not a bad beer of course. But it is in the top 100 here on BA.  A-Dark brown almost black, no light gets through. No head to speak of formed just a thin ring. S-Smells nice, coffe, choclate, rasted malts and green hops T-overwelmingly bitter from the roasted (almost burnt tasting) barely. Green hops come through as well. Alcohol esters really carry to the sinuses, very boozy. some coffee and chocolate also come through ont he finish M-creamy full body D-Too boozy and bitter, I can only drink one per session. I will continue to give this beer more tries though.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,wcudwight,4.55,"I've reviewed this beer aged a couple of years so I thought I would review one fresh for comparisons sake. Pitch black with 1/2"" hot chocolate covered head. Lot's of sticky lacing clings to the beer and the glass. The hops are really noticable in the aroma. Lot's of dark fruit smells. Man this is so good. The flavors in this are all very rich and bold but still mix and balance very well. Most RIS have a coffee flavor to them but Storm King has espresso flavors. Most have a mild hop flavor in them, but in Storm King they attack your taste buds like a DIPA. Most have some chocolate in them, but Storm King taste like a rich Belgian chocolate. Mouthfeel is full but not as syrupy as some others of the style which is a good thing. I remember the one I had that was aged a couple of years as being extrememly drinkable. This one is not but it is still very drinkable considering the style and gamut of flavors that your tastebuds have to endure. Final thoughts: Cellared or fresh Victory Storm King is the best RIS and one of the best beers period that I've had.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Mebuzzard,4.35,"Found this at Mountain Sun's Stout month. Couldn't wait. Smooth pour, black with a little burgundy on the edge. Slight off-brown head, they know how to pour these. Smell of coffee and baked cocao, a bit of dry hops, some black fruit. Tastes really good. Smoothed out coffee and chocolate, some roasted malt comes through and the hops dry it out nicely. The alcohol is hidden until the next sip, then I can feel it. I'd go for the tap over the bottle on this one.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Dizzy,4.08,"Pours opaque, as dark as any beer I've seen. Creamy tan head leaves some lacing on the glass, good retention. Aroma is hops up front, then alcohol and roastiness. Taste is bitter, malty and some chocolate. Alcohol is very prominant. Full bodied, alcohol burn is present as well. Overall a good beer, I wouldn't want more than one in a session though.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,mwearl,4.21,"Poured into a glass I observed a very black beer with a hearty head. The taste is heavy and bitter, finished dry and a little dark chocolate. The might be the most drinkable heavy, high alcohol content beer I have ever had. I would normally stop at one beer of this class, instead drinking two and would have had three if I was at home. Just a great beer all around dark beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,beeragent,3.89,"We finally got this in Texas!!! Poured from a 12oz. bottle, into a pint glass. The beer poured a jet black, forming a very thin mocha head, that left light lacing on the glass. The aroma is rich roasted malt, with a slight hint of coffee. The flavor is mostly of the roasted malts, strong coffee sweetness, with a little alcohol. The mouthfeel is thick and smooth. Overall, a highly enjoyable RIS. Definitely the best brew Victory has to offer. Check it out if you get it in your area.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,ArrogantB,3.61,I poured this 12 oz. best before 03/2011 bottle into my snifter (as I almost always do). It was very black but had a cream colored head. The smell was very doughy and kind of unpleasant. The flavor was still very hoppy but had some nice roastiness to it. i really couldn't get past the dough flavor of the beer. I liked this when I first bought it in August and when I had it on tap but it didn't wow me this time. Maybe aging was not so good for the ol King.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,beerphan,4.5,"12oz bottle -&gt; nonic Enjoy By Sep27 11  Pours black with a 3 finger tan head off an aggressive pour. The head recedes quickly to a fine film of chocolate milk suds. Thick lace spiderwebs the glass.  Nose: Roasted malts, oily juicy hops in the background, alcohol, tobacco leaves.  Taste: Smooth chocolate malts, dark fruits, alcohol, piney hops with a mild bitterness with some bite. I bet this will age well, as its flavor seems a little raw.  Creamy smooth mouthfeel, feels a little thinner than usual, but chewy nonetheless.  One of my go to stouts every year since i first had it. (okay last year was the first year.) One of the easiest drinking RIS that i've ever known.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,guitarmage,4.67,"Appearance: One of the blackest beers I've seen, a coffee tan lacing sits on top, foamy, thin, inviting.  Smell: Clean and crisp, gentle roasted malt, coffee, unsweetened chocolate, some aromatic herbal or spiciness, pine and cream.  Taste: Big nuttiness and coffee beans, brown bread, fresh baked, then comes the herbal hops, medium intensity and balanced out with a milky creaminess, hops hang on the tongue.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied and creamy, carbonation is very light, but the beer is very drinkable and goes down easy.  Drinkability: Delicious, one of the best stouts hands down, very complex, not too sweet, tastes like a meal. I'd like this with a hearty meal.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,largadeer,2.33,"Appearance: Black with a quarter-inch chocolate-colored head.  Taste and smell: Malty and roasted, espresso, brown sugar, surprising hop kick in the finish. Pretty acrid and harsh.  Mouthfeel: Not as chewy as other Imperial Stouts; somewhat thin. Medium carbonation.  Drinkability: Not a fan of this beer, it's rather acrid. I recall it being enjoyable a couple years ago, but I can't say that I like it anymore.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,penguinjive7,4.28,"Pours an excellent pitch black, with about two fingers worth of brownish tan head.  Smells of roasted malts, and a hint dark roasted coffee.  The roasty flavor hits first, followed by an espresso-like tinge. There is definitely a strong presence of hops towards the end, but it is well balanced. After taste almost has a hint f extremely dark chocolate.  The mouthfeel is perfect. Viscosity is just what I would expect from an imperial stout and the carbonation is perfect.  This was a scrumptious imperial stout. Definitely among the best, in my opinion. I could not drink more than one at a time, but for this style that is a good thing. If you like imperial stouts an haven't had this one, you are in the dark.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Bobikel,4.35,"Appearance - Poured aggressivly into a half liter goblet, this extremely black beer grows a nice medium thick, brown/tan rocky head that dissipates rather quickly. Lacing is good.  Smell - Alchohol, plum, yeast, and just a touch of bready roasted malts. A small amount of spicey hops come through.  Taste - Roasted coffee entwines with nice hoppiness to create a VERY well balanced Imperial Stout. Alchohol is nicely hidden, and unless you had prior knowledge of the ABV, you would probobly never guess.  Mouthfeel - Thick a little creamy and just a little chewy, slightly higher carbed than most stouts, but not overly intrusive.  Drinkability - Definetly no lightweight, but an easy drinking, interesting ale that can warm you in the middle of the darkest coldest winter with one or two sips.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,briman,4.03,"Served from bottle into standard pint glass.  Pours dark brown, almost black. Mostly opaque, but maybe some little bits of ruby around the edges when held up to the light. Nice half-inch brown head. Excellent retention, lots of lace.  Aroma is roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, and citrus hops.  Flavor is roasty. Dark roasted malts, dark chocolate, and coffee come through. Finish brings out grapefruit rind hops that mesh with some black malt to give it a moderately bitter finish that lasts well into the aftertaste.  Medium-full body, moderate carbonation. Smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Balance is good, and you definately get strong and clear doses of both malt & hops. Alcohol hidden well in the aroma & aftertaste, but does makes its presence known with some warming. High ABV keeps this from being a session beer, but still one worth having again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Melchizedek,3.63,"Pours black as Norwegian heavy metal, with a big lively tan head that subsides into a cap, leaving sticky, regular lace along the sides.  Surprising dose of hop in the nose, resin combining with caramel and roasted grain to produce an aroma less rich than I might like, but surprisingly sweet and fruity. In the mouth, the roasted grain comes back to take the fore, combining with a surprisingly dryish (though rich) mouthfeel to give an impression not unlike spiked Postum. Alcohol is a pretty distinct presence, lending a spiciness to the flavor, and hops bring in a subtle bitterness, especially in the finish. Carbonation just right. Hard to pick up some of the notes promised in the aroma, though - not quite enough richness to make up for the harsher side.  This is an impressive beer, but I have a hard time really warming up to it. I think some of the flavors need to blend and mellow a bit before this can be the stout I want - I would love to age a bottle or two and see what I get in a year or so.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,emerge077,4.18,"Wow, the 1000th review...or does BA stop counting after 999? Guess not.  Well, this hefty stout pours black into a chalice, an inch of dark tan foam rises to the rim of the glass. Head is dense, fairly aromatic notes of hops and roastiness.  Taste is burly, rich burnt malts, bitter baker's chocolate, and dry bitter hops linger in the finish. Alcohol is expertly hidden. Mouthfeel is big, not exactly viscous, but getting there. Coats the palate going down.  I've got a couple more lined up, this is a perfect winter sessioner. 3"" of snow in Chicago, and I feel like hibernating with some of this...  '99 vintage courtesy of Steve, thanks man! Really amazed by how this has held up. Very rich and chocolatey, somewhat mellow but remarkably no signs of age. Still massive, bittersweet chocolate fullness, some tobacco, just sublime. Age this beer!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,oakbluff,4.05,Appearance is a murky dark- wicked milk chocolate head. Nose is subdued- hint of coffee there. Taste is very roasty. Espresso flavours are there but not in your face. Chocolate malts are very nice and carbonation levels are bang on. A very drinkable RIS.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Avagadro,5,"A: Beautiful appearance. This brew has a black velvety body in which no light can pass though, and a mocha colored, two fingers of foam that stick to the sides of my tulip. Very creamy looking. Good head retention for a RIS. Drink by sep. 27, 2011. That's 4 years from now.  S: Very strong aroma. Sweet with dried fruit, vanilla, toffee, and caramel. This smells great.  T: Wow! Fruitiness, hoppiness, spiciness. This beer has it all. Sweet caramel malt followed by dried fruits, then hops, nice roastiness, and finishes with a spicy alcohol note. This is definitely a must try brew.  M: Thick chewy mouthfeel. Low carbonation, with a nice velvety mouthfeel. Slips off of your tongue and leave an excellent feel.  D: This is a must try if you're a fan of any kind of stout. I could drink these all night. Another great brew by Victory.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,peppertopher,4.47,"Poured from an amber bottle into classic glassware.  Appearance - Pours dark , not totally black but a deep tinted amber. Spotty head that lingers the length of the drink.  Smell - Wow! Smells fresh and delicious, right from the bottle. Malt and hops blend magnificently. Chocolatey, earthy undertones are magnified. I hope this tastes as great as it smells.  Taste - Taste most definitely backs up the smell. Starts with a burst of hops, followed by that tasty malt. Chocolate, burnt but not too much. Coffee undertones as well. Extremely hard to believe that this is 9.1%.  Mouthfeel - Perfect. Not too thick, yet smooth enough to drink repeatedly. Very delicious. Slight carbonation releases bursts of flavor which linger long after the last drop has been swallowed.  Drinkability - This beer could be a bit of a problem. It's way too easy to drink for such a high alcohol content - but it's too damn good! A perfect example of a magnificent imperial stout. Well balanced and tastes great.  Excellent beer!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Rich and very full, but a bit abrasive on the tongue. Alcohol is definitely noticeable - the flavor is simply not concentrated enough to cover it.  A hearty he-man brew, but too rough for my regular rotation. It's too bad, since I've loved every other Victory beer I've tried.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,JMH_,3.75,"Pours a deep brown to black colour with a creamy off-white head that dissolves a bit faster than anticipated. The body itself appears a bit thinner than one would expect for an Imperial Stout, but this one still looked pretty nice for the most part.  The aroma is a bit faint but a decent mix of coffee, chocolate, earthy malt, a bit of alcohol and a touch of berry throughout.  The flavour hits with fullness that the aroma missed out on. Coffee hits first and mixes with some general malt and then moves into a bit of chocolate/cocoa toward the middle. The finish hits on berry flavours for a second and then ends with a very nice burnt/roasted malt flavour. Alcohol peeks through here and there but is fairly well masked overall. Mouthfeel is full bodied and a touch slick.  This one is good overall but I don't understand why its so highly regarded. I've had many better within the style (and have had a lot more that are worse at that). There are no major flaws but nothing really stands out as awesome about this one. Tasty for sure, just don't necessarily expect one of the greatest brews you've ever had...",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,mobud,3.88,"Served in nonic glass; chilled but not real cold.  A- Beautiful dark color poured into a light brown head that slow disolves into a slight ringat head.  S- Trace roasted malt. Not overwelming.  T- Well-roasted but not burnt malt flavor with very little alcohol taste.  M- Smooth is the key here. Malt and slight coffee with some bread like notes that go down real easy. Not an abundance of aftertaste, but the roast malt element does remain. Alcohol taste is present but so hidden that it is a non-factor in the delivery.  D- This is what I like in an imperial stout. I have been a fan of Victory for years, but this is the first stout of theirs that I have tried. This is definitely a one and done (in a session) for me; but I will grab several more to try in the future.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,ByTor2112,4.37,"Oh the hype with Storm King, but Victory never disappoints! Wonderfully bittersweet aroma, very rich dark roasted malts come through, a slight sour aroma reminiscent of a Milk Stout, but barely. Bold Stout flavor all the way. Subtle coffee flavors with a killer dark roasted malt flavor profile. Some stouts get a burnt taste which is not a bad characteristic but this RIS stays just above that. There is a nice hop bitterness that is evenly matched to the malt profile. Alcohol is well hidden to me. A nice froth on the palate livens up the hops and releases some tannin flavors. Quite quaffable for an RIS. Finishes clean for me, not too dry and lightly coats the palate. This was great!

345,1013,BeerSox,4.31,"12oz bottle into snifter.  Impossibly black light brown head that holds for several mintues until it settles to a bubbly cap and a thin rim. Sticky and string lacing coats the glass.  Highly roasty malts along with some bitter hops. The alcohol is present, but not overpowering. The overall aroma is a little more subtle than others in the same style.  Standard roasted malts start off the brew, but unlike others the hops seem to take a bit more of a hoppy approach, with the bitterness settling in well in the back of the mouth. A creamy dark chocolate comes through in the middle. This one is full bodied with good carbonation and a little bit of a spicy hop zing at the end. The finish has a faint chocolate taste, some of the roasty malts, and a lingering hop bitterness.  I've tried several Russian Imperial Stouts, and this is the first one I have found that has such a strong emphasis on hops. Although most are packed with hops, the malts almost seem subdued by them. All that being said, it's a great beer, and one I enjoyed. I appriciate the 12oz sampling rather than a bomber that seems to dominate the style. I like being able to finish a RIS on my own. This brew by Victory an interesting twist, and it's something everybody (espcially stout lovers) to try. Recommended.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,wagenvolks,3.97,"Dark coffee color with a light tan head that dissipates within the minute and leaves no lacing. Aroma is surprising, with sweet hops, coffee, hazlenut, and chocolate and alcohol notes all present.  The taste? Wow. Packs quite the flavorful punch. Strong, chocolatey coffee notes surprisingly well balanced with an earthy hops flavor. Can't say it't overly enjoyable, but definately original. Mouthfeel is thick and gritty yet has an element of velvety smoothness to it. An acidic bite finishes this thing off...dynamic and interesting, but again, not exactly what I'm looking for (Disclaimer: not a huge stout fan). I can't say that I'll have another of these, but I'd definately give the go ahead to all my stout-loving friends.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Backer2004,3.38,"I have nothing more that the other 990 reviews probably say but I'm giving my 2 cents anyway. Pours so opaque you cannot even see the carbonation. Small beige head that stays around only around the edge. Smells of caramel, chocolate, fresh hops (this one had not been cellared at all). Too hoppy, without a malt balance. A bit on the burnt side. Medium body and though drinkable, it disappointed me.  I'll still keep the others cellared for a while and re-edit as necessary.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,peabody,4.28,Pours out black as night and with two fingers of brown suds leaving lots of lacing around the pint glass. Smell is wheat and chocolate with lots of maltyness. The fruit smell is that of like plum or raisin? Taste is malty sweetness followed by a dark coffee bitterness then the alcohol burn. There is a fruitness here but I can't put my finger on it. This is one mellow nice beer. The aftertaste is of bitter chocolate/coffee. This dark malt sticks to to the inside of your mouth. Not a session brew but still a very nice beer. Too bad I can't get it around here.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,SkinnyElvis,4.5,Doing a little side by side with Great Lakes BO Stout. Hmmm... I can get Victory Storm King at any time and I prefer it to the brew I got in a trade. This is a fresh bottle. Dark in complexion with a malty nose. The difference between the Storm King and most RIS is the bit of hops thrown in. Very drinkable despite the ABV. Is there a better RIS that distributes widely (so DL does not count)? I would vote Storm King.  Cheers.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,markgugs,4.72,"Poured 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass  A: Pours a gorgeous dark, near-black (or maybe roasted brown) color, not too much head that dissipated quickly and left minor lacing.  S: I'm biased as hell, cause Russian Impys are probably my favorite beer style, but this just smells like the best coffee/roasted chocolate you've ever had. It's a big smelling beer, which just makes the mouth water in anticipation.  T: No doubt, this is a huge beer, the initial sip is a gigantic burst of flavor, all the roasted chocolate and cocoa/coffee tones you'd expect. There's an ample alcohol presence that quickly warms in your mouth and is covered up by a glorious finish, like bittersweet baker's chocolate. There might even be some dark fruit flavors hidden in there (raspberries mostly, or maybe cherries), especially as the beer warms. Absolutely delicious.  M: Very well balanced carbonation. The beer is not light by any stretch, but it's also not so chewy that it's difficult to swallow. It's quite pleasant and I find myself going back for additional sips quicker and quicker (probably not a great idea for a 9.10% ABV brew).  D: If I could possibly remain in control of my motor skills, I could drink these all day and all night, but that's just not possible. An absolutely perfect winter beer and one of my favorites, period, let alone of the Russian Imperial style.  Highly recommended.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

345,1013,jamie2dope,4.13,"Though I can find this beer in most stores, I was pleased to see a case of it sitting in the packy across the street from me. Anyway, it pours a damn near oil black color, with a small, but sticky tan head. Smell has traces of earth, a bit of coffee, and lots of milk chocolate. Taste was very similar with the chocolate flavors going off the charts. Despite the sweetness of the chocolate though, it did have a certain bitterness in the back of it. Mouthfeel was on the heavy side, but for some reason, I can drink this beer like it is nothing. I usually can down a sixer of this and feel fine. Oh well, either way an awesome beer to have around. It seems like on of those offerings that they would normally have in a bomber as a special release. Nevertheless, I think I like the fact that it is in six packs much better.

345,1013,theformula,4.22,"Okay I've heard so much about the great reputation of this brew...I'm anxious and excited, admittedly.  Pours a dark, satanic opaque black; like oil. Decent tan head w/ okay retention and pretty sticky lacing. Means business by appearance...  The aroma is rich and very complex...thinking of dark chocalate, rum-soaked dark fruit/prunes, a little alcahol and some hops as well but they are faint.  Taste is complex as well. Takes over initially with a very rich chocolate/molasses character, darkly roasted malt and some coffee essence. From there you get a big grassy, hoppy bitterness and some spicy fusels. The very rich chocalate/dark fruit is the pilot here, with the delicious hop profile noticeable and balances it well.  Very warming stout and unique. I truly enjoyed the hell out of this I.S. Sip it slowly as it warms. The finish is dry and very long, and retains the roasted flavor. I swear I detect raw peanuts...but this could be an herbal/grassy note from the hops...who cares this is awesome.

345,1013,mrbowenz,4.13,"I was introduced to Victory's Storm King Stout a few years ago by a Victory representative outside my local beer distributor ( God Bless Pennsylvania ) . As was the case I was headed in to purchase 3 or 4 cases of something else , when the young man said ""here try our Imperial stout"" ! , An oz or two of Storm King on the ususpecting palet is not the most exciting experience to say the least, However there was something different and complex about this beer that said "" try a case of me "" , so after picking up my other beers, I loaded a case and headed for home. that was Oct 2003...As is often the case with higher ABV beers, I will let them age in my wine cellar for a year or more. For some reason I had just let this case sit until Thanksgiving 2006 .

The smell of hops are the first thing you smell.  Chocolate and Coffee,hops are evident in the taste as well.  mouthful is slick and slightly carbonated,it leaves a dank taste on the back of your palate.  I'm starting to really have a love for stouts and the darker beers now and the first time I had storm king was at Victory and it was love at first taste.It was so good that I had to get a case of it.I plan on leaving a 6 pack of it for the rest of the year.I recommend this beer to anyone that wants to drink a damn fine stout.  ***2006 bottle drank 01/09***  Ive been waiting to have one of these bad boys and tonight seems like a great night to have one.I got a case of this stuff on my birthday in 2006 and saved three bottles and my birthday is three days away.Lets see how it taste.Drank from a snifter at a cool temp.  Still pours a sexy brown head that falls fast to a nice ring.Not as coffee tasting as fresh.Still taste the roasted malts and some mild hop bite I think.Smells a bit boozy.It also smells a bit fruity.I'm not sure if I like this better aged or fresh.Its awesome fresh.It also taste like the mouthful broke down some with age.Not as slick as fresh either.This beer taste almost Belgian.I smell some oxidation now also.I may have to revisit a Storm king fresh to see how it is. :)",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Nice Roasted coffee like taste, very full bodied and thick, almost a meal. Perfect for desert. Slight hoppy finish with a bite! Excellent stout, yummy and full of flavor. Will definatly turn to this again!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Absumaster,4.35,"Got this beer from a trade with dogfooddog, thanks again!  Appearance is an ink black beer with an off-white, creamy head.  Smell is burned with coffee notes and some liquorice, finished with a good hoppiness.  Taste of burned malts, liquorice, espresso coffee, lots of dark tastes, pretty complex. A nice bitter and hoppiness from typical American hops. Carbonation make the beer sizzling on the tongue. Aftertaste is dry and lingering bitter. In my mouth this beer is less viscous than the beer appears when it was poured into the glass.  A great combination of US hops and black malts give this beer a great balance and complexity that very few beer can match.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,HoustonTX,4.7,"Storm King Stout pours a beautiful opaque black. Sitting atop is a large rich brown head. A couple shades darker than mocha. The lacing is extremely sticky and the carbonation looks well done. The smell is really a barrage of flavors. Ultra complex, to say the least. Huge dominate malt tones. Coffee, caramel, chocolate, and cream. Strong fruity esters including bananas and strawberries. Along with a large presence of piney hops in the background. The smell is crisp, clean, and complex. Highly dominate and worthy of a crown. Does this smell come in cologne?  Now for the first sip of this magical brew. Mmm, once again, high on the complexity scale. I am starting to understand all the hype on this one. Large coffee and chocolate presence upfront, with a permeating roastiness that lasts throughout. With a large bitter dark chocolate note following closely behind. Shows a bit of caramel sweetness at first, but fades to extremely bitter on the far end. A surge of hops hits about midway, providing some excellent bitterness to the mix. It blends with the dark chocolate bitterness perfectly and balances the malt well. Finishes crisp, and chocolaty, with a coffee espresso punch. The hops don't let go either, as they are strongly present in the finish as well.  Storm King is almost flawless, with it's amazing flavor depth and complexity. It's keen sense of the style and it's incredible hop profile. You really can't go wrong here. A world-class RIS.

345,1013,andrewmartin,4.23,"Picked up a sixer of this at the brewery while visiting Philadelphia (I think the wife was a little concerned about my sanity when a visit to Downington was the highlight of the trip). Anyway, the enjoy by date on the bottle is 3/22/11, so a few of these are going to be squirreled away in the cellar.  A: Pours a deep chocolate, almost coffee collar with one of the tannest heads I've seen in a while.  S: Rich malt notes intermingled with some hope aromas (can't place the specifics of the hops)  T: This is where it gets really interesting: Raiseny brandy sweetness in the front, notes of chocolate and coffee soon take over. There is a hoppy finish, but it doesn't start until late, after the beer has slid down the throat. As it warms it picks up medicinal notes as well. The assertive hoppiness (hoppy for a stout, the hops are quite restrained) really intermingle nicely with the roasted malts.  M: Plays across the palate a lot more than other stouts, probably due to the hops.  D: I have to say that I was a bit worried about the reputation this beer has as a hoppy stout, but I was pleasantly surprised. This is definitely one that needs to be taken slowly to be appreciated.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Tyrawlings,4.3,12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass.  A: Black as night. Creamy brown head that pours two fingers thick and leaves some retention. Thin lacing.  S: Smells of roasted coffee with some chocolate wafers. Earth like or tea leaves with dark fruit.  T: First sip reveals burnt astringent coffee beans followed by dark bitter chocolate. A nice hop bite pricks the palate and is smothered with the taste of caramel or toffee. This beauty finishes with a black current or sherry like aftertaste with a hint of smoke.  M: Syrupy thick. Subdued for the style and alcohol involved. Dry red wine finish.  D: Storm King is a sipper for sure. A once in awhile treat after a long days work or on a cold winter evening. I have had this on tap at the brewery and I thought it had alot more flavor and was very subtle. Good none the less!

345,1013,adammills,2.5,"I poured this beer into a brandy snifter at cellar temperature. Very dark brown to black with a large brown head that persists. This beers nose is underwhelming. Some roast, slight burnt coffee, some boozy hints (anise?). Big roast up front of the palate, with some chocolate and what appears to me to be a substantial hop bittering backbone. Some warming alcohol and a touch of anise again. The bitterness lasts well into the finish. This beer leaves me wishing it had a more substantial mouthfeel, more creamy, with a touch more residual sweetness. Perhaps that will come thru with some age as the bittering drops.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Kendo,3.87,"Label says ""enjoy by Mar 03 11"" so I assume they believe this can be aged for another 4 years. It's been in my cellar for about a year, I'd guess.  A: An aggressive pour into a pint glass yielded a midnight-black body with a fluffy 2-finger head the color of Yoo-Hoo or a chocolate milkshake. The head settles slowly and leaves some rings of lacing at the top of the glass. No more lacing on my way down, however.  S: Immediately I smell licorice and dark chocolate, with a hint of spicy alcohol. More roasted coffee notes as it warms.  T: A roasted coffee bitterness dominates early, but as it warms it tastes more of charcoal. Surprisingly one-dimensional in that aspect, as I expected more going on given (1) the nose and (2) my past experiences with this beer. Alcohol warmth isn't noted in the mouth, but I feel it in the belly.  M: The first word that comes to mind is ""chalky."" Despite the look, it's actually more medium-bodied and even slightly watery. Again, I was surprised.  D: All in all not bad. It went pretty well with a cannoli, but it was lighter in the body and less flavorful than I expected.  Notes: It's probably been at least 2 or 3 years since I'd had this in a bottle, but I remember being awed the first time I had it. And my experience with it on cask this past summer was more positive as well. Maybe my tastes have changed; or maybe the recipe has; or maybe cellaring this for a year has weakened its character. In any event, I found this to be a decent RIS, but a bit too one dimensional and lacking complexity. I wouldn't turn this down in the future (and I still have plenty in the cellar to drink), but I remembered this being much better.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Creamy chocolatey 1.5 finger head which remains around the rim and small marble size bubbles on top. Smells of sweet and dark chocolate, mocha, roasted malt, coffee, and alcohol. I have a small cold so I cannot get the nuances.  Tastes of chocolate, malt, and coffee with a even bittery hop finish. Very nice beginning bubbly hit with a bitter aftertaste that lasted for at least 2 minutes. Alcohol so well hidden I cannot pick it up anywhere but, in the smell. This takes the cake for me!

Reminds me of some of Victory's other beers. BItterness fades and chocolate flavors make their way to the forefront. They are accompanied by roasted almonds and finishing punch of alcohol.  Mouthfeel: Malty and bitter. Smoothe feel and an alcohol warming burn is pleasant.  Drinkability: I could probably only drink one of these in a sitting.

The beer is to opaque to see any carbonation rising at all. Lacing clings in spots around the glass.  An average strength to a pleasent aroma. Smell of dark plums is the most prominent scent. Malted grains have a light quality of roasted oats. A very nice balance of hops finishes the noseful.  A storng coffee flavor hits the back of the throat. A very sweet fruit blend imixes the taste of plugs, dates, and figs. Decent alcohol quality is warming but not overpowering.  A nice thick clinging consistancy. A low amount of carbonation lets this one sit on the tongue for a while before shifting flavors slightly.  A great example of the style. Perfect beer to be sipped by itself after a meal.

Smells ashtray dry roasted malts and flat hop with some grassy character. Wet sweet and lactose smoothness. Caramel and toffee with a tempered coffee roast. Smells delicious.  Tastes wonderful. Wet sweet, roasty malts, chocolate, and toffee/caramel supportive. Alcohol burn is present, but clean and a nice addition. Hops are wmette-like bitter and grassy with mild bitterness. Hops in the flavor are not as strong as the hops in the aroma. Creamy sweet undertones rise up for notice and are a key for the sucess of this beer.

345,1013,instrumentality,4.4,"So black you'd think it was left behind by an Exxon Valdez oil tanker, this brew made a bold statement as it crouched within my Stone Imperial Russian Stout tulip glass. What started off as a hearty two-finger creamy brown head settled to a bubbly lace with an attractive halo encircling the edge.  The odor was a rather potent mix of roasted coffee beans and toffee with the slightest hint of a dry red wine.  I inhaled deeply as I took my first sip and found that the odor was merely a sneak preview to a highly rewarding flavor. The initial bite of roasted coffee was followed by a mix of dark chocolate and a mild sweetness reminiscent of the aforementioned red wine aroma, rounded out with a remarkably smooth finish of burnt malt.  This is actually the third or fourth bottle I've had of this stuff, but it's the first time I didn't think it was overrated--perhaps because it's been given a chance to age several months since I initially tried it. I consider RISes to be one of those styles I really have to be in the proper mood for, as I tend to find them intense, not only because of their high ABV but because of the massive bitterness of coffee beans mixed with the tannic quality of red wine. This brew definitely packs a punch, but it at least has the decency to slip on a glove before it begins to pound away at my palate. Each sip goes in smooth, builds up in intensity, and then finishes clean with only the mellowest of aftertastes. This last feature, the mellow aftertaste, is something I hold in high regard, and something which I've found to be incredibly rare in the more intense and complex brews. The aftertaste tends to linger longer as my consumption continues, however, which bumps the mouthfeel down from a perfect 5 to a 4.5.  This is no session beer. It's more accessible than other RISes, but it's still not one I'd want to have every day, as one thing it's not (and I wouldn't expect it to be) is refreshing. On the other hand, I'd take this over the standard ""winter warmer"" any day of the week as a comforting way to wind down at the end of the day.  This brew has reinvigorated my respect for Russian Imperial Stouts. It's just unfortunate that most other examples of the style fail to measure up, and that this one is so hard to find and so hard on the wallet when I do find it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

The smell is an array of dark fruits, some chocolate, and sweetness.  The taste is even more complex, with a real nice hoppy bitterness at the beginning, and then a rich, creamy, espresso aftertaste that balances it out like few beers I've had before. Each sip gives you a new experience, lingering on the tastebuds and waiting to be explored. It's like a West Coast Stout, Sweet Stout, and Imperial all mixed into one.

Smell: Smells sweet. Not picking up the roasty aromas I usually pick up in stouts. Seems almost fruity in the nose. Odd.  Taste: Syrupy sweet. For me this is just too sweet for a stout. Followed by a large amount of hops. A lot of bitter and sweet, but IMO not very well balanced. There is a medicine-like taste in here too, actually reminiscent of cough syrup.  Mouthfeel: Decent medium body, low carbonation. Would like to taste more carbonation here.  Drinkability: counldn't do more than one. It's just too sweet for my tastes. Overall, I'd like this beer to have a more roasty taste, a little less hop character, and tone down the sweet maltiness quite a bit.  Was looking forward to drinking this one, but it just didn't do it for me. Overall, I'm a big fan of Victory brews.

Intense malt flavor followed by a strong hop bitterness. Thick mouthfeel with the roasted malt flavors lingering on the tongue as the carbonation expands into the nose.

Smell is rather fruity, with none of the coffee and roasted smells that are normally a hallmark of a RIS. I can slightly detect an almost berry smell. Actually welcome for me, it's a nice change of pace.  This is a rather hoppy RIS. The first taste I detect is hops, and then a bit of a coffee flavor, with a sweet, smooth finish. It threw me off at first, but upon my second sip I rather enjoyed the difference that this RIS brings.  for a RIS, this is kinda light. Easy to drink, but a high ABV keeps this one on the ""Sip and enjoy"" list.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,uconnalum2,4.32,"Pours black with a thin tan head that quickly disappears to a ring around the glass. Smell is of delicious dark chocolate and hops. The taste is very nice: coffee, dark chocolate and some hops. Alcohol is barely evident in the taste but is surely noticeable in its warming effect. Mouthfeel is full bodied with some carbonation. Drinkability is limited a bit by the high ABV and heaviness but its tasty enough to want to have more than one. Overall, a very enjoyable beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,hckyfn9999,3.35,"Pours an opague black color with some ruby hues towards the top of the glass when held to light. There is a small tan head that doesn't last too long and leaves a little lacing.  Aromas of dark fruit, chocolate, espresso, some hops, and a faint cigar like smell as well as a little alcohol.  Taste is pretty complex and a little harsh. There are notes of citrusy and piney hops, some roasted (perhaps burnt) malt, blackberry, coffee, and some charcoal.  Mouthfeel is full and a little more carbonated than I would prefer.  The harshness of this stout takes the drinkability down some.  In my opinion this stout doesn't quite live up to the hype.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,BeerBelcher,4.5,"This beer pours about as dark as it could possibly be. I held it up in front of a lamp and nothing came through. THe head is abundant and a dar shade of tan. A very attractive appearance.  Aroma is very strong, and of dark malt, coffee, and chocolate.  Flavor is more of the same...extremely strong flavors of caramel and coffee. I should also add that it is delicious.  Mouthfeel is extremely smooth. Carbonation is wonderfully fine and perfect.  Drinkability-wise, I could have a few of these.  A wonderful product, and I highly recommend it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Aroma is roasty and piney, a little chocolatey.  I like this much better than the other bottle I had. The hops are upfront and piney. Roasty, coffee flavors round out the flavor profile. There may be a touch of anise as well. Mouthfeel is good, not as thick as some big stouts.

345,1013,CharlieMopps,4.05,"A: Not much head at all, what was there dissipated somewhat quickly, and there was a deep black look to the beer itself. Sort of lackluster in the appearance department, but hey, nothing's perfect.  S: A toasted malt and coffee scent with sweet-smelling chocolate aromas blending in, with perhaps a licorice or dark fruit style undertone.  T: An invigorating rush of sharp hoppy flavor across the palate, possibly aided by the well-masked alcohol. Low chocolate tones come underneath, smoothing out the taste along the tongue, and slowly fading into a lingering finish of the best roasted malt flavors in there.  M: Thick and mealy, appropriate carbonation for an almost syrupy stout that has great composition.  D: Despite the alcohol content, this one can be enjoyed consecutively (maybe just one more) due to its ability to entreat the tastebuds and not terribly overpower them. But still, with an abv like this, tastes can be deceiving, so moderation is the key.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,rayjay,4.38,"Via trade with akorsak, bottled on 10-31-05. Thick and black with a nice size tan head. Of course, I poured it into my Storm King pint glass. For a beer this strength, it has great head retention and lacing.  A year has tamed this beer very nicely. This is the first time I've had it aged, and it's almost a whole different beer. It's not the assertive beast it used to be. The malts are very rich and the hops have learned some manners. Some bitter and burnt flavors, but mostly sweet rich chocolate malts galore. Smooth and bitter aftertaste that lingers for a bit, with a subtle faint sweetness.  Awesome mouthfeel once it warms a bit, like drinking liquid silk. Alcohol is barely noticable, but adds balance the bittersweet body. Drinkability is high on this one.  Apparently the secret to this beer is in the cellar; I've always loved it fresh on tap at the brewery, but tonight I saw a whole different side to this beer.

Rich malt, chocolate milk, espresso, and burnt sugar in the nose, with hints of pine and sweet tobacco.  Right up there with the finest stouts I've ever tasted. Incredibly rich coffee, chocolate, and malt flavors, yet somehow not heavy or overly sweet. Nor is there too much heat from the high levels of alcohol. Touch of bitter hops in the finish keep it honest. (I keep saying ""Wow"" to myself with every sip.)  Rich, thick, and creamy in the mouth, with the right amount of carbonation and citrus to keep things balanced.

Ther is plenty of roast, dark coffee, dark chocolate flavor, but the hops works great here. It is also pretty full bodies. The is a harsh tingling sensation over the tongue.

345,1013,MuddyFeet,4.48,"Picked this up two days before my wedding allong with a Brooklyn BCS to share with my brother while my (now wife) and his girlfriend went out for the bachelorette party. We started with a bomber of Highland Mocha Stout before moving onto the BCS (which is quite amazing this year) before starting on the Storm King Sixer. This is on of four bottles remaining ater the honeymoon.  Pours an almost impenetrable midnight chocolate brown in color. I say almost because when I hold the glass akilt and up to the light some rays are able to sneak their way throught the brew. Finger depth foamy head that dissolved to a few stray tracers and a ring of brown foam around the glass. Just a little bit of spotted lace. Nose is a Mecca of sweet and botter chocolate and some slight wafts of coffee. Piney hops try to rise to the surface but subside to the sweetness of the malts.  Flavor slowly builds to a crescendo of a deep dark cavern of chocolate, coffee and toffee. Each one is trying to overpower the other before another takes the lead but no one ever seems to win the race. Snipping around the edges is an ever-so-slight hint of dark, dark cherries. But almost unnoticeable. Mouthfeel is very full and expansive. Definitely not a beer for the weak of heart or palate because it spreads and changes in flavors throughout the time it takes from opening the bottle to finishing the glass. Smooth as freshly sharpened skates on ice and perhaps one of the most drinkable beers I have tried to date.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Rich, powerful smell is parts roasted malt, dried fruit and light citrus hops.  Exquisite divergent dancing sweetness and hefty, tasty burnt coffee and hop bitterness. I do love a balanced beer. Thick and creamy in the mouth, and very capable of supporting more carbonation than the average Russian imperial stout.  A real luxury. So disappointing to hear it's a seasonal, so necessary to stock up. Buy it. Put it away. I'm nervous that I only have a few left, and my friends have had a taste. We may just turn on each other...

A faint scent of chocolate, but it's pretty hard to make out. The taste is a bit bolder, with the chocolate coming out again. Almost no noticeable hop flavor, but there certainly is a bite from the alcohol. Leaves a nice creamy taste in the mouth.  I felt it was a good stout, but I've found a few others that I certainly like more.

There is sticky tan lacing all over the glass. Scents of black patent malt, subtle toasted character supported with easygoing hop aroma. No real fruit qualities to this, maybe some bread from the yeast, but a nice mix of aroma all the same, especially as it warms up. The flavor has just the right amount of chocolate malt balanced with hop bitterness. The toasted character and black malts are definitely the showcase, supported then by tasty hops. This is so far one of my favorite R.I.S, however I am new-ish to the variety, but I stand by my evaluation. Its a strong tasty brew with medium body (nothing thats going to weigh you down, but its surely got body and strength).

Not sure about impst status though. Some alcohol finish.  Nice carbonation for the style. Might be a little more bland than expected for some tastes. Feels nice overall.

S - Bouquet is a nice rye & dry malt sweetness. Hops are more prevalent here than in any other RIS stout I've had, but it creates an added dimension and more complexity.  T - Very similar to the scent but seems to be not quite as potent. Very dry and sweet with a clever floral hop balance. Very mild chocolate with slightly stronger coffee notes. Alcohol is not noticable at all.  M - Smooth and creamy with light carbonation and an extremely drying finish.

Decent head, big and bubbly but dissipated to nice lacing with larger head around the glass. left a nice residue around the ring. very dark beer (black),but almost looks red when held up to light.

As I have said in other reviews, of my favorite offerings from this style, the chocolate and coffee flavors are perfectly balanced with a nice subtle hop bite.

A - dark. dark. dark brown, basically black. looks like very dark coffee. pours a small, one finger head that sinks into thick bubbles and clumpy clacing down the glass  S - a very pleasing aroma. take an IPA or DIPA (citrus hops) and mix it with chocolate and roasted coffee.  T - whoa. the hop content of the smell is lessened up front by the big malty flavors (chocolate, roasted grains, earthiness, and mild sweetness). after that, the hop bitterness, with hints of lemon or orange (perhaps, might i say, grapefruit?) rind, kicks in and pushes the sweeter flavors from off the palate, but a hint of dark cocoa powder remains in the finish. high amounts of gut and throat warming from the alcohol.  M - not as thick as i would have thought - i'd say this is perhaps even thinner than the big DIPAs (such as moylan's beers), but it seems to gain more volume in the finish, becoming somewhat syrupy (which is good, i think, for this style and other big beers). the carbonation is a bit strong and burns the tongue, but it isn't awful.  D - very high. besides the slightly-overdone carbonation, i can't think of much wrong with this beer. another A+ from victory. i wish i had more, but, with the 10% ABV, maybe it's good that i should lay back; got to get up early tomorrow, afterall.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,daliandragon,4,"This is one of those beers I've been meaning to try for a while, and with 11-1 being the unofficial start of stout season, I'm letting her rip.  Body is completely black as far as I can see, which is good, but the head doesn't last more than a few minutes, which I frown on. Nose has two major influences: roasted malt and alcohol.  Surprisingly strong hopping in this beer to match, and at times, overpower the coffee malt, which finally gains the upper hand in the aftertaste. Alcohol is also very evident. Carbonation is also just a touch overdone.  Maybe I'm being a little too picky, due to the exemplarary reputation of this brew, or maybe I picked a subpar bottle, but this is a very good RIS that didn't blow me away the way I was expecting (for example, the way my first bottle of Old Rasputin did). I like the hoppy dryness and balance but the alcohol isn't as well masked as I would hope.

345,1013,EvilKeith,4.32,"Presentation: 12 ounce brown bottle. Bottle on November 18, 2005. At the time of this review this bottle was roughly two weeks short of being one year old.  As Storm King poured in to my tumbler it was the color of vanilla extract. In the glass it could easily have passed for black. Suspended yeast granules could be seen in the glass. The head began as a finger of sandstone colored creamy foam. The lace was patchy, but sticky. The smell brought to mind dark chocolate, dark roasted coffee beans, caramel, charred wood, green grassy hops and peppery alcohol. The taste was roasted and toasty, sweet caramel, unsweetened cocoa, and espresso. I found it to have a surprisingly hoppy presence and moderate hop bitterness. At the end of the swallow alcohol warms with a pleasantly dry finish. This was very nicely done, complex contrasting flavors playing off of one another and everything balancing nicely. Not too sweet, not too bitter and the roasted characteristics are reminiscent of a Porter, but do not feel out of place here. The body was medium-heavy and the carbonation was moderately active. The mouthfeel was creamy and inviting. Now I have to decide if I should continue cellaring the rest or find it fresh. Decisions, decisions",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Doomcifer,3.9,"Pours a rich, pitch black with a huge caramel colored head that retains excellently. Great lacing all over the glassware is left behind throughout the enjoyment of this brew.  Aroma is of sweet, dark malts, ripe dark fruits, raisins, plums, prunes, a little bit of milk chocolate, and mild alcohol fumes.  Taste is of very sweet dark malts, raisins, figs, and brown sugar. Finishes very roasty but still sweet, with coffee flavors, and a touch of hoppiness. This is a very complex beer. Perhaps a little too sweet for my liking though.  Mouthfeel is rich and creamy with a decent amount of carbonation. Great mouthfeel for an Impy Stout.  Drinkability is slightly above average. Very sweet and high alcohol levels make it less drinkable. I like my Impy Stouts to be a touch less sweet.

Also some cherry, tiny bit of bitter chocolate, and happy funness. Seriously, it smells like a fun time. Has a mellow flavor that develops and builds to a crscendo, then slowly melts away on the palate. Had great bitterness and sweetness, balance like crazy yo. On a side note, how does Jake Bussey keep getting acting jobs? Sorry, back to business. Finishes heavy, a litle onthe bitter side, with soe slight anise and blood (kind of an iron meaty flavor I call blood).

Some fruitiness in there as well.  Very quick from start to finish. Initially a coffee-bean bitterness with a chocolatey ""melt"" that hurries you to the hoppy finish. Aftertaste is bitter. Alcohol is definitely present throughout. Some cherries and plums as it warms. Kind of chalky and ashy as it warms. White grapes in the finish.  Medium bodied with light carbonation.

The nose is kind of metallic alcohol, not too pleasant. Some chocolate hints are present, but overall, I'm disappointed here.  Taste is roasted coffee, alcohol, chocolate, and hops... more hops than you normally see in a Russian Imperial Stout. The start is very strong, and very stout-y, but the finish is bitter hops. Interesting, and makes for a nice contrast on the next sip.  The mouthfeel is good. This is a well-carbonated stout, and that adds some heft to it, but not too much.

Smell was milder than I expected (also could be due to the allergies/cold I have). Malts and alcohol primarily. Coffee aroma appeared much later, as it warmed.  Tasted of bitter cocoa powder. Bitterness from hops countered by sweet roasted maltiness. Medicinal, cough syrup flavor. Complex, interesting, and strong. Alcohol was very well hidden.  Mouthfeel was smooth and full bodied, without being tiresome. Mild carbonation. I will let the others I have sit awhile and revisit them later. I don't think I'll be disappointed.

When you factor in not just taste and drinkability, but also price and availability, you have a beer I would call ""damn near perfect."" Nothing flashy or fancy, this beer blows many bottle-conditioned corked Imperial Stouts out of the water.  As said before, not much else to say. It's gorgeous, smells great, hoppy yet malty, sweet yet complex and the alcohol is not just hidden, but necessary to add to the complexity of the package.

I'm a hardcore stout fan, don't like my stouts hoppy, but we'll see how this one goes. Taste is thick, hoppy, and a little heavier on the carbonation than I expected. This is a nice change of pace to the stouts I usually drink. This is very drinkable and a nice difference to my other choice stouts. Taste is hoppy, alcohol and some hints of coffee try to make it through the hops. It's a good drinking stout, but not the upper echelon of stouts.

345,1013,BassAssassin,4.47,"--2006 Vintage--  A: Almost pitch black in color with a tan, creamy head. Head is thin and dissipates rather quickly (not surprising considering the high ABV).  S: Roasted malts and a hint of raisins. This is followed by an underlying scent of fusel alcohol, reminiscent of a fine whiskey.  T: Big hit of roasted malts mellowing into a pleasant coffee flavor. Hints of sweet raisins are also present. All the malt is easily balanced by the big hop profile. This is quite a hoppy brew. However, bitterness is well calibrated. Finishes dry with a warming alcohol. Highly complex.  M: Full bodied and round. Minimal amount of carbonation. Smooth.  D: Well done. I could drink more than a few of these in one sitting.

The mouthfeel has a full body and smooth carbonation.

345,1013,kmudrick,4.51,"Poured into a Troeg's pint glass. The cellar it was stored in was 49 degrees at the time of the pour. Drips a thick, and deep opaque hue, reminiscent of used motor oil. Leaves a 1/8 inch of dirty foam with light lacing that hugs the sides throughout the session. Immediate smells of molasses are apparent with a light alcohol-splashed, roasted-coffee scent. I detect very subtle hints of a slightly tart and sweet, yet earthy fruit - perhaps a mild berry of some sort. First swig brings an immediate rush of a stinging, bittering hop flavor, followed by noticeable waves of roasted malt. Not as much chocolate presence as the tint and scent would suggest. Not as thick as Stone's offering - lighter than expected from the consistency. The carbonation is very noticeable, with lots of fizzy pop dancing on my tongue. I get a mild range of alcohol burn, more present in the back of the throat. The finish is bitter, like a shot of espresso. Delicious and suprisingly drinkable, the complexities in the taste definitely hides the high alcohol content. Not so sweet that you get sickened by the end of the serving. I could most definitely enjoy more than one of these in a single sitting. Overall, I find it very warm and inviting - seems like it wold be the perfect beer for me to relax with after a cold day snowboarding. Definitely Victory's best offering.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Aroma is excellent, lots of roasted malts, some chocolate, hints of coffee and a touch of brown sugar and molasses. Taste is roasty, chocolately, sweet, and bitter. Initial roastiness gives way to a malty sweetness. In the finish there is a pleasant bitterness accompanied by coffee and some chocolate with a strong roasted malt presence. Decent balance, maybe a bit too roasty and a little light on the hops. Mouthfeel is good, full bodied yet somewhat velvety, with moderate carbonation.

Again dark roasted malts are in the forefront with bittersweet chocolate and coffee also present. Hints of dark fruits at the end. Great mouthfeel, relatively low carbonation and a solid body without being too thick. Drinkability is exceptional for an 9.10% ABV Imperial Stout.

345,1013,yelterdow,3.72,"Bottled on Halloween, 2005... this one's been sleeping in the cellar for eleven months, and now the time is right for imbibing.  Served at between fridge and cellar temperature in an oversize brandy snifter.  Appearance- Pours a deep, chocolate red into my glass... the light tan head only rises to about a finger, then subsides to a layer of various sized bubbles and foam. There is plenty of lacing, though it decorates very sporadically.  Smell- Notes of espresso, cherries or blackcurrants, and a hint of wet newspaper... then some big hops leap into the nose. The aroma is huge and thick, although the alcohol is restrained.  Taste- After about a year mellowing out, the hops no longer blast the tongue with its pistolwhip-type aggression. The malts are forward, displaying roasted coffee and some chocolate, and then the second slapping takes hold. In the middle and during the swallow, this beer dropkicks some serious hops at the sides and inside of the mouth, leaving a bitter history. Long finish, it goes on for minutes.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Barely prickly upon entrance, the effervescence grows smoothly and elegantly into a very attractive mouthfeel. For a 9.1% beer, it's relatively light-bodied but still packs a wallop and warms the arms and chest quite well. Even cellared, the hop profile is enormous and presented nicely... this is definitely a brew to wrap the night up and take to bed with you.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Appearance - Pours with a small and tan half-finger head that almost immediately dissipates to a very patchy layer of faint lace on top of the brew. No head, no lacing. The beer is opaque black.  Smell - Metallic oily hop scent up front with a very thick and rich roasted malt aroma. Some chocolate and coffe notes are present as well. Very simple smell, but quality. Smells like a ""good ol' fashioned"" imperial stout.  Taste - Chocolate and coffee dominating the intitial flavors. Very oily but subdued hop character. Strong and rich roasted coffee-like malt character. Some spiciness from the alcohol. The aftertaste has some lingering oily hop sourness with a slight earthy presence, along with rich chocolately/roasted malts. Probably a perfect no ""bells & whistles"" exammple of this style.  Mouthfeel - A bit more carbonation I like for a stout such as this, but still not overpowering. Full-bodied with great smoothness.  Drinkability - Quite strong flavors and a full, heavy body.

Flavor is bold as an imperial stout should be. Very chocolatey, with a hop profile that is very green an lingers.

S- Sweet fruity malts at first followed by floral hops.  T- Slightly bitter hops at first, floral hop notes in the middle, maybe lavender? Very nice malt sweetness balanced well by the hops. This is not a malt bomb at all. The hops used balance the malts very well but it is a kind of harsh balance. Maybe a year or 2 in the bottle would help mellow it a bit.  M- Slightly thin and dry.

345,1013,numenor1,4.5,"Oct 31 05 bottling. I bought a case of this when it was released, drank about half immediately after purchase and have been holding the latter half, periodically trying one. I must say, as it's just shy of a year since the bottling date, this is really starting to come together. When released it was more primal, with biting hops and with more prevalent alcohol, but now those two aspects are smoothed out. While I love it fresh, it's a different animal now.  Still pours very dark, not as viscous as some other impy's, huge tan head. Smells of dark chocolate, mocha, caramel and toffee with berry esters(previously the fruitiness of this beer was masked). Instead of being raw, this starts off roasty, yet sweet and smooth, midway developing a distinct cherry character, which then couples again with french roast coffee (dark almost smoky, incredibly deep but not acrid or sharp, rich and wide). There's a vague earthy undertone of hops, which has definitely receded over the past 11 months, letting other characteristics shine. This has even taken on a vinous quality. Very round flavor. While still dry, as far as impy's, this is now showing off its sweetness, and remains very well balanced. Mouthfeel is medium-full and carbonation energetic, yet very soft. Much more drinkable than it was at release. Terrific, and worth the wait.  This is up there with founder's breakfast and yeti as the best american styled impy's i've had yet.

(dust) But I can say that it must be black as night because I held the bottle up to a 300 watt construction spotlight and there was no sign of light. This is when I decided through precise calculating that this bottle contained a black hole.  A- Dark, kinda really dark. Foamy head, big bubbles, little carbonation.  S- The first thing that came to mind was robust, then I read the side of the bottle and they used the same word. This is so rich and bold that I can only imagine how fast it would fill the room if I had poured it into a glass. Espresso, caramel, burnt, charcoal, etc.  T- Just like the smell, it's potent. It floods the mouth with rich, bold, burnt taste. A little bitter, but overpowered by a strange sweetness. I drank it at room temperature, of course, so the alcohol started shining through about 3/4 the way through it, but I didn't mind. This is great.  M- A little thick and syrup-like, but the alcohol thins it out a bit. Definitely good for drinking a few.  D- This is a little strong to be pounding, but if you want to give a cocky guest something that will quite him down for a while, throw em one of these puppies.

345,1013,MusicalBeers,4.45,"85 deg in LA is Winter enough for me after weeks of 100 deg in Texas, besides this beer isn't imported to Texas with the TABC SS in charge. Purchased at the Beverage Warehouse in LA which I highly recommend.  Pours nearly black but tinged with deep brown around the edges with an almost non-existent almond head which quickly becomes truly non-existent. Hearty aroma, meaty, reminding me of Celebrator Doppelbock: Worcestershire and molasses, hardly sweet but bit of dark chocolate is present. Taste starts out like the aroma, reminding me of Worcestershire, not remarkably fruity but instead of dark-roast coffeee and again only a bit of chocolate sweetness.  Oh, and I recant everything I've ever said about a beer with ""balance"". This is the King, no pun, just an aptly named beer. I usually lean to the malty side (the dark side?), it takes a really good IPA to swing me around. But this stout starts out with a brief creamy malt tast before steadily building the hoppy intensity until by the finish you almost wouldn't guess this started out as a malty stout. But even at the height of the hoppy finish is are the undertones of roasted malt, chesnut and coffee beans.  ""Height"" is an apt word too because rather than the often flat/lifeless finish of some stouts which achieve a heavy flavor and creaminess but are fairly one-note, this beer keeps building and building, remaining alive with the changing flavor to the finish. Mouthfeel to me also changes somehwhat, starting creamy and finishing thinner but still velvety, never astringent.  Overall there aren't many (or any) more drinkable beers with this high ABV, which is an achievement. It's hard not to reach for another even when I've said this is my last one. Good thing, I've got a great excuse to drink all six since I can't take them back in my carry-on anymore! Almost makes up for the fact I had to buy toothpaste here but not really.

Poured pretty much totally black. 2"" thick mocha colored head, the ""eye"" or direct middle of the head is very bubbly, active and very thick, like a gyser. The Head looks like a satalite piture of a hurricane the way the eye is formed in the middle with swirls and circular patterns forming around it. The froth would subside to just a fine covering.  Smells of sweet and roasty malt. big vanilla and old english leather, smokey with coffee notes, dark roast for sure, and black licorice with a courage-like herbal hoppiness, with a grainy-herbal effect...almost spicey in the back. very aromatic overall.  First hit is a smooth and thick herbalized-chocolate brownie. A smooth bitter, fresh, green hop explosion then roasty malt, smokey like it was oak-barell aged. Roasty coffee bean, and a deep malt flavor, but I'm mostly intrigued by the major-league hop effect. The finish is very herbal and spicey underneath a very complex malt and a slight wet-cardboard taste that is not as potent as oxidization. The heat is actually pretty mild within this malty body, but the warming effect and buzz only adds to it's complexity. a dandy stout.  It's strong in the way of ABV% but it's sooo good you don't really notice any heat. It's actually more drinkable than some of the heavier RIS.

I could taste some citrus hops which was a surprise and a good one at that. Has a bitter aftertaste but still has the roast character in it as well.

345,1013,Domingo,4.5,"Victory has made it to Colorado, so Story King was an immediate purchase for me. Pours a ""typical"" (at least for an RIS) black-hole dark with a moderate to small brown head. It's not the darkest or lightest I've seen, but right in the middle. The smell is what immediately grips you because it hits you with hops immediately and then follows up with a bitter dark malt, and booze. The hops smell is actually stronger in this brew than any other dark beer I've had. It's almost IPA level. The flavors set this one apart. While similar to others, it has a really strong coffee backbone that keeps coming back. The hops are also a nice compliment. It doesn't have the druit fruit character you might exepct, but the coffee, chocolate, and hoppy zing more than make up for it. This beer drinks like a porter, which is nice. It's not quite as thick and makes a nice afternoon relaxer that doesn't have to be sipped as conservatively as you might initially think. I really, really enjoys this beer and the nice thing is that it's priced right. I can get a full 6-pack of this for the price of some bombers or 4-packs, and Storm King is as good as any other Imperial Stout on the market. In all honesty, even though it's not my highest rated of the style, I could see myself choosing this brew over others simply because it's a little unique and I think I could end up craving that flavor specifically.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

The alcohol clearly emerges with a bite.  Creamy and fairly full-bodied. The alcohol slightly wiped out some of the flavors, but they re-emerge.  It wasn't bad at all.

Love all of the beers from Victory Brewing I have tried so far, and was reluctant to try Storm King since stouts aren't my favorite. 12 oz. bottle into regular pint glass. This is a very dark stout that pours with a nice milk chocolate coloured head that quickly dissipated.  The bitter taste of dark roasted coffee permeates even after the sweetness has subsided. Light black licorice flavour can be distinguished which I believe is a mainstay of the imperial stouts.  Carbonation is nice and light and allows the flavours to hit the tongue. A small carbonation ring remains around the edges to show it's not dead.  After sipping half the glass, the numbing effect of 9.1% starts to release tension and drinkability increases.

A sweet, dark cherry taste also comes into play and was my favorite aspect of the beer. As it warms up, the burnt coffee taste comes onto the palate stronger. The body was thick, but not as thick as some other Imps I've had lately, namely Stone.

Taste - Roasty aroma with a good deal of 'toffiness'. Mostly burnt, not at all sweet, beer doesn't taste thick otherwise. Lingering bitterness. Not as impressed as some of the other readers--check out my other reviewed brews for better tasting beer.  Drinkability - Not really drinkable, and not really worth the $3/bottle. I would still recommend this to others (since so many people have tried it and recommended it), but there are much better and more drinkable beers out there for a better price...",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,MuenchenerKindl,4.27,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle to a steamed glass. Very nice deep dark colored liquid with light carbonation. Smallish dark tan head fades to a slight lace.  The smell is big bold dark fruit with coffee and a chocolate note or two.  The taste is very deep dark toasted bread, quite a burnt taste, could have some more complexity too it, but this is quite a fresh bottle, I will age the rest a little more. Some faint notes of fruit and black coffee. Great bitter hopy finish, very well done.  The mouthfeel is very good, thick rich coating. Nice Indeed.  Drinkability is very good quite an outstanding beer. MK",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,dancinwillie,4.18,"12 oz. bottle from a 6 pack, poured into a pint glass. Looks black as midnight in a monsoon, with a 2 inch caramel colored head. The head slowly drops to a mere covering, and my patience is growing thin. Storm King has left a lovely lacing. The beer itself looks dark and foreboding, much like many a summer storm, but even so, I seriously want to drink this beer. Raisin and plum seem to dominate the nose. Very, VERY, mild chocolate is also detected. My first swallow: I'm letting it warm upon my lucky tongue...a bitterness is there, I don't know if it's the hops, but it may be. A fair amount of plum, not so much raisin, and a load of bitter sweetness. I don't know if that makes any sense, and I wish my palette was more evolved, so I could pin it down. Almost like when you find unsweetened chocolate as a child, but you don't pay attention to the ""unsweetened"", and just chomp away. A bit sweeter than that, and a bit less bitter. Also, a slight impression of the alcohol coming through, but nowhere near the ABV in this high gravity brew. Could sneak up on you VERY quick, like the tornado come to take you to Oz. Mouthfeel is a little course, but as I mentioned, for a 9.1% beer, what do you expect? Overall I'd say this delicious brew can weather even the most beastly of storms. And I'll be drinking it, just as often as I can get it. A well balanced, frightenly drinkable brew.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Toddv29424,4.45,"I've been hunting down this beer for a long time, and I finally found it at a new vendor near my house. Pours a very dark brown color (not translucent) with a minimal head. Smell is intentionally sweet, but then the alcohol overpowers and takes control. The taste is huge, and surprisingly cohesive for such a big beer. The first taste is of toasted malts and grains which also have a bit of nut to them. There is also a touch of sweetness to it, like brown sugar or cinnamon. About 3/4 of the way through the alcohol takes hold and mixes with the other tastes of the beer nicely. The finish is again sweet, mostly consisting of the brown sugar-alcohol mixture. It goes down surprisingly easy for such a big beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,JohnnyM2002,4.3,"Got lucky and picked up the last bottle at the bar the other day...it was stashed behind some HopDevils. Color was a dark reddish-brown with a thick head. Smelled of roasted toffee and chocolate. This stout had an aggressive kick - not enough to turn you away, kind of like a strong iced coffee; the alcohol taste was definitely there, but again, it wasn't overpowering. It really goes down like a hard iced mocha (maybe more on the espresso side); leaving for a very drinkable beer.  My favorite Victory is still the Golden Monkey, but this is another top quality product from them!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,cproioi,3.68,"Aha I finally found a bottle of Victory's Storm King Imperial Stout. As I pop the cap I pour with great anticipation, I have heard so much good things about this beer I was very excited. As this Beer pours out into the glass it pours a pitch black body that seemed like a black hole in a glass. On top layed a lovely Brown head that stood long and proud. I plunged my nose into the glass and inhale deeply. At first I pick up the basic bittersweet and espresso aromas that are signature in this style then I pick up something different. It was an aroma of apples, it reminded me a great deal of British styles, such as Saumuel Smith's Taddy Porter. The taste was such a treat. It had everything the smell was but at first a slight smack of hops that woke up the tounge. It was thick but not syrupy more like a froathy explosion in my mouth. After I finished that first beer I wanted another. It did not disappoint me and I will definitely be getting this one again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,HimerMan,4.48,"On Cask 7/21/06 at Stout in NYC, served in their cask beer glass (typical small mug).  Very nice pour - black, ruby highlights in the light and a slight syrup-like stick to the glass when you move it around.  Awesome taste - as a stout should be, chocolate notes, mild coffee and a small taste of alcohol that peeks through after some sips. About half way through the beer develops a caramel-like flavor with a bit of cream, of course mixed with the overall chocolate/coffee overtones.  Absolutely excellent to drink, first time ever on cask for me, multiple bottles enjoyed (Nov 04 batch my favorite to date). I think this was a bit too cold from the cask; but if you let it sit for a bit - it comes out perfectly.  Try this while you can at Stout - awesome beer, and great bar.  Cheers.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Smell is sweet, chocolate, toffee and cherry notes, alcohol, pine/floral hops. Taste is super roast chocolate and coffee, very rich, some caramel/toffee through the middle, more chocolate in the finish and some pine and floral hops, little bit of alcohol in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation. A nice imperial stout. Definately drinkable for being pretty big.

345,1013,bluejacket74,4.21,"Served in a pint glass the beer pours pretty much as dark of a brown as you can get (close to being black), with a good brown head as well (but goes away quickly). It smells like roasted malt, some hops and a slight alcohol smell. The smell isn't very strong at all. It tastes like roasted malt, chocolate and coffee, with a slightly sour, hoppy bitter aftertaste. The aftertaste sticks around a while! As it warms, the taste gets better. It's very smooth and creamy, and even with the bitter aftertaste it's still pretty drinkable. Just the right amount of carbonation too. Even with the high ABV content, you can't tell it too much when you're drinking it but it does hit you after a while. Overall this is a pretty good stout, I'd definitely recommend it to others.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

I bet this would make a great salmon marinade.  T: Wonderfully pungent and uniquely sour. Not puckering but certainly astringent. From the beginning the burnt roasted barley/coffee kicks of the journey with bittering hops playing a part. The sourness, sort of like an attractive sour chocolate milk aged in oak, hits the center of the tongue and tickles before settling and and lingering thru the remainder of the process. The bittersweet chocolate notes become more apparent as the aftertaste settles.  M: Silky, oily, dope.  D: Totally unique.

345,1013,DaveFL1976,4.75,"Pours about as close to a black you can get. Topped by a frohy, tan head that likes to stick to the sides of the glass, but settles down in a few minutes. Very well balanced smell for a stout. I can make out the roasty, toasty barley, the sweet malty backbone, as well as some bittering hops. Nice! Very nice! Taste is big and bold. Starts a bit sweet. Like a morning coffee with lots of sugar. But then it gets more expresso-like. Dry, and slightly bitter. Great balance on this beer. This is 9.1% alcohol? no way! It's almost as drinkable as chocolate milk. For this much taste, I'm amazed at the ralative thin mouthfeel. The big taste, combined with the easy-on-the-tongue mouthfeel makes this one scary-drinkable brew. Oh, it's good.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Schwarzbart,4.05,"Appearance: Poured close to motor oil appearance which was sort of weird because I just changed the oil in my car about an hour ago. Not much head, but a nice little tannish brown ring around the glass and ok lacing. Smell: Very distinct hop aroma which I didn't expect. There are fruit aromas that mix with the hops nicely. The combination yielded an aroma of raisons and oranges. Roasted malts round out the aroma and fill the nose along with some hints of alcohol. Taste: Roasted malts spring on the palette quickly followed by a strong aggressive leafy flowery hop taste. The malts have an earthy coffee taste. As the beer is swallowed the alcohol is quickly apparent, but not overbearing. Mostly the hop sticks around and makes the biggest impression. A little bit of orange rind flavor in there also. Mouthfeel: Smooth, but thick and creamy. Drinkability: Good stuff from a bottle, but it was much better on tap at Kclinger's in Hanover, PA a couple of weeks ago.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Aroma of nice roasty bean, coffee, sweet chocolate, molasses, brown sugar, very very nice. Taste begins sweet with chocolate and brandy perhaps, then comes the espresso and a bittering from just enough hops and almost too agressively roasty malt. Also, there is some dark fruit, like a brown sugared apple or something. Basically, the mouth is the greatest feeling under heaven, smooth, creamy and the slightest carbonation and pleasantly warm down the throat. This is one of those rare, wonderful beers that you take a sip, swallow, then continue to 'drink' it as you swallow the residue in your happily salivating mouth.

345,1013,nyjets1248,4.08,One word....Black. Another word...Great! Pours black with a average one finger width tan head that dissolves down to a thin cap that reamins for the duration of the Beer. The aroma is subtle coffee and chocolate. The subtleness disappears with your first sip. Roasted! The flavors are solid roasted coffee and chocolate there is a hint of sweet malt. These flavors fade to the Hops that clean things up a bit and stop your tounge from being roasted as well. There is a slight burnt bitterness that lingers in the aftertaste and although it has a fairly high ABV it does not interfere with the taste of this Beer. The medium to thick body contributes to the success and the drinkability is high for an Imperial Stout. Storm King has just become one of my favorites.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

I am a devoted stout lover and this is the number one stout (especially available in a 6-pack stout). I could drink this all night. The only item I rated less than a 4 was the smell at 3.5 as it's nose isn't the greatest and I have had occasion where one has smelt a little like a wet dog.  If all RIS could be this well crafted, balanced, and tasty there would be no wars, famine, etc. OK maybe I'm exagerating.  The taste is a hoppy, roasty, coffee, creamy, mixture of delicousness.  Mouthfeel is great.  Drinkability is high. I have enjoyed 3-4 in a night althought the ABV does catch up to you.  If I had to have one keg on tap at my home or local bar this is the one.

This has a ton of roasted malts and coffee, as well as molasses and baker's chocolate- the standard issue stout flavors, as well as citrusy hops which are quite bitter for the style, even after a year and a half.

Little to no head apparent, which was a little disconcerning. I love the smell of this beer, it fills the nostrils with malty aromas of coffee and chocolate, with a noticeable hint of alcohol, and lingering hop scent. The taste from start to finish is very good. A slight biterness finishes this stout, after a strong presence of malty characteristics to start.

It was a very deep chocolate brown color with a decent head and lacing. In my opinion, the smell didn't do justice to the wonderful taste.

Had this one after my Memorial weekend bbq dinner. Poured into a nice room temp pint glass and it poured perfectly the whole way through. Nice dark toasty color with a small 1-finger off-white head.  The smell was full of nice toasty malt and sugar in the chocolate tones.  Taste was nothing less of perfect for this day. Just excellent chocolate, coffee tones. So close to a dessert, I couldn't believe it.  Mouthfeel was smooth and the taste lingered, so every sip was a happy moment.

It's now May, so the beer is a bit on the old side. I don't know how it was stored, probably on the shelf in the store the whole time, so I don't know if this had any effect on the taste. If it did, then a fresh one of these would really be awesome!!)  I had to drink it in the hotel room, so didn't have a nice glass, just the standard lowball glass that came with the room. Even so...  Poured a very rich, dark mahogany with a 3/8 inch creamy head.  Smelled of mollasses, caramel, malt. Very little hop aroma.  Taste was exceptional. Just the right amount of sweetness, molasses, maltiness and balanced by a great bitter finish that left the palate nicelly cleansed. I definitely agree that this is a top ten beer. The alcohol was extremely well hidden.  Mouthfeel was not overly thick. There was enough carbonation to keep it refreshing. But enough body to let you know that you've had a great beer.  This beer is scary drinkable. I could easily down a couple of these in a row, but the ABV would probably knock me over if I did.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,heyitsbyron,4.09,"Poured a single bottle ($1.35) into an English pint glass.  Dark brown, but not black. Average head, but it wasn't dark enough nor did it stick around. Shame.  This smelled hoppier than the Double Cream Stout I just finished. The smell is almost exclusively hops and dark purple fruits. Slight booziness.  Taste followed smell, perhaps a bit more malt. This was exceptionally hoppy as opposed to sweet and malty. I like that, but it needs a bit of balance. I like the fruitiness and the hoppiness, but I want to taste a bit more of the malty booze.  A bit over carbonated at first, but then gets nice and smooth as it warms. Not slick like other imperial stouts, but rather like a smooth IPA.  Just a bit too bitter and heavy to be had in any sort of quantity, but hey, it's not a bad beer. Booze is well hidden.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,dfried,3.77,"This is a pretty darn good imperial stout. It is a very deep and black with some brown around the edges when held to a light. The head is small and deep in color, but doesn't stick around for long. The smell is characteristic of a robust stout, roastedness is dominating, but you can tell there are some sweet carmel malts too. The taste was much of the same, I was however impressed with the use of hops in the brew, they brought some zest to an average, creamy stout flavor. Mouthfeel was average for an imperial stout, which I feel is naturally a little tough to palate with the lack of carbonation, and a lot of booze. These were great to drink one or two of while playing cribbage on a sunny saturday afternoon, but worth the $10.99 I paid for the 6-pack, I think not.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,beercat11,5,"Just happened to see this on the shelf at a local beverage supply outlet. I have always enjoyed the Imperial Stouts out there although there are not many. The first thing I noticed upon popping off the cap was the unbelievable aroma coming from the bottle. If I had to smell this blind folded I would have guessed it was some sort of coffee/chocolate (mocha) style ice cream soda. The beer poured thick and black with a very dark head. The first sip of this brew floored me. It did not taste like I had anticipated. My long description would be a Hopped Chocolate malted coffee espresso deluxe with the essence of roasted almonds served in a chestnut wooden mug!! WOW!! The finish is smooth with a hint of bitterness that disappears very quickly from the tip of your tongue to the back of the throat. Carbonation is perfectly balanced because of the initial hoppyness experienced upon contact. I think this beer would even be enjoyed by those who typically don't drink this style. If you ever see this, try it. I could drink this every day if it wasn't so potent at 9.2% abvr. I Love this one and will try out the remaining four bottles during this years Holiday season. I am sure it will age very well.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,MagicLantern,4.26,"Poured from bottle to a pint glass  A: Two fingers of head. A dark tan head slightly darker than Old Rasputin. Even thick lace coats glass and make beer look good.  A black beer, held up to light one can see a slight red translucence. I think this beer is actually darker than Old Rasputin.  While a nice head and lace, they weren't as pronounced or as long lasting as Old Rasputin and for that I'm not marking it has high. Still a great looking stout.  S: Slightly roasted smell and malty. The smell wasn't very powerful or distinct and that's why it recieves the lowest score in thie review.  T: Strong! Sweet, coffeesque, roasted chocolately taste. Bitter. Complex. I'm told to try it after Old Rasputin and that's just what I did. I had some cheese and water to neutralize OR, and then had this beer. This is a great tasteing beer, but I don't know if it tastes 'better' or even more complex than Old Rasputin. It's simply uniquely different. I'm going to give it the same score as Old Rasputin, a 4.5. It's a great tasteing Stout, that's all I can say.  M: The carbonation in the beer isn't visually noticable, but it is heavy and pronounced when agitated. This provides a burning sensation not found in less carbonated stouts. This compliments the flavors and probably is responsible for the beer coming to life.  Smooth and balanced. I'm coming to think the secret to a great beer is in balance. This beer is balanced. Toasty roasted, sweet and bitter, clean, it's all there.  D: Again, the balance of the beer makes it incredibly easy to drink. The roasted chocolate aftertaste doesn't get old. It's in fact very inviting.  The higher carbonation may lead to a full sensation more quickly than in other stouts, but I haven't put that many away to test this idea out. I was told to compare this beer and Old Rasputin and this review details some of that. I think they are both great beers. I don't know if I could pick one over the other. Perhaps I'll have to go back and have a showdown!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,TheManiacalOne,4.8,"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a pint glass.  A: The beer pours a deep dark brown with a small brown head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.  S: Rich chocolate, malt and espresso with a little bit of hops mixed in. Nice blend.  T: Roasted coffee and dark chocolate to start off, then a decent hops bite for the style. It’s an excellent combination of flavors that battle each other for dominance as you drink it. You taste some sweetness and some bitterness, but not an abundance of either.  M: Extremely smooth with medium-to-low carbonation and a medium-to-heavy body. It doesn’t leave a strong after-taste or a sticky film.  D: This beer is as drinkable as you can get. Very smooth and very flavorful. You notice a little bit of the alcohol but it’s almost an after-thought, but I’m sure as you consume a sixer it wouldn’t be an after-thought for long. This is just flat out an excellent beer.

I couln't really tell the color of it since it was in a brown bottle and I didn't recieve a glass or ask for one. I did enjoy this beer, but mostly because I am working on a program of tasting beers that I heard about call the Gullifty's 130 plus beer challange, and this was just another one to knock off my list.

APPEARANCE: The color was that of soy sauce. Held it up to the light and saw not one photon shinging thru. Beautiful opaqueness. SMELL: Light chocolate, mellowed by time under the sink. Silky malt with toasty notes of lightly burnt fruit, perhaps apricots, peaches. MOUTHFEEL: As smooth as butter. Glides over the tongue with glorious sensuality. Kisses the roof of the mouth with the gentle persuasion of roasted malt. Rarely have I had a better experience regarding mouthfeel. DRINKABILITY: It is strong, but so mild (at least aged 3 years). Mild in overall presentation, though not in spirit.

This beer is a dark black that lets no light through. There was a nice tan head. The smell is of malts and alcohol. The taste is of roasted grain and a bit of subdued alcohol. The mouthfeel is very smooth for the style. A good alcohol aftrtaste. The beer seems to be a very tame example of the style. I could drink more of these but I expect they would sneak up on you.

345,1013,artusory,3.93,"2004 bottle. Pours black with big, creamy, tan head that quickly fades to a cover. Aroma is hop dominated, pine and some grapefruit, stout aroma underneath, coffee, chocolate, a touch of alcohol. Flavor is half IPA, half stout. Initial hops bite fades to coffee and chocolate. A lingering taste of grapefruit remains through out. Finish is medium length, texture is smooth, but this feels thin in the mouth for an imperial stout. Also, carbonation is a little higher than I would have liked. This is a very nice beer, but if Im in the mood for an imperial stout (when am I not?), Ill take an expedition or siberian night over his.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Smell-not much at first, a minute to let it rest and a little stirring reveals alcohol and chocolate in massive amounts along with a substantial hop aroma  Taste-WOW, incredibly smooth, chocolate rises up along with coffee and hides the alcohol incredibly well, the alcohol does show itself but for a beer of this strengh it is well hidden, wow. Goes down nicely, aftertaste is dry and of alcoholic fumes.  Mouthfeel-light for such a thick stout, alcohol at the end mostly, a little chocolate on my next sip, great stuff.  Drinkability-Deviously drinkable but this will knock you on your ass if you have too many, still it is so good, so chocolately.  Overall-hands down the best stout I've ever had, so chocolaty and flavorful masking its uglier alcholic side while keeping all the strength this beer has aged well and lived up to its reputation, what a brew!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

S: It smells bitter, oily and somewhat alcoholic. Some citrus & pine with a dark, burnt, maltyness.  T: Dark, bitter chocolate. Orange and pine from the hops. A little molases with a slight spicyness, like jaggery. Dark fruit (raisin and prune) with some dark, burnt caramel. Slight acidic tartness in the finish. The bitterness and hop flavour are assertive, but they're not over-powering. The alcohol is apparant, but it takes a back seat to all the other flavour. I really like this one... though I do think it would benefit from some more fruity esters (from a British yeast).  M: Thick, somewhat syrupy body with a chalky finish. Light to moderate carbonation.

345,1013,ClearDog,4.9,"I've been enjoying Storm King for a good part of the winter season, but am only now getting around to rating it.  Appearance -- Black ink in color with a strong two-finger khaki head. The head has some staying power and leaves a foamy lacing on the sides of my imperial pint glass when it weakens. This stout is absolutely breathtaking to look at!  Smell -- Roasted malts, but with a great hop presence. The hops in the beer are what make Storm King such an endearing stout for me. One of the best smelling beers IMHO.  Taste -- Malty with an aggressive hop finish. Hops are pretty prevalent in this beer, but you can definitely tell this is an Imperial Stout.  Mouthfeel -- Heavy and creamy. Almost like a think shake.  Drinkability -- For a RIS the drinkability is very good, although I'd recommend stopping after two. I absolutely love this beer and recommend it to all craft beer enthusiasts! I plan on buying at least a case before the summer.

The foamy tan head did not last long at all. The aroma is an amazing blast of fruit, piney hops and roasted malts. Maybe because of the food I was eating but the special thing about this beer that gets me is the sweet fruity taste, malt flavors, and piney hops that combine for such a well balanced yet complex taste. Some roasted malt and choclate hints also. The mouthfeel was perfect ,nice, thick and full.  I saw this for 11 bucks a 6 pack at Wegmans I plan on picking it up and adding some stuff via re-review.

Nose - wow! deep roasted malt, sort of like espresso, and smokey; also, some pine and alcohol. Taste - as in the nose, deep roasted espresso all over, some smoke,some piney citrus counterbalance (hops), and an alcohol burn., followed by aftertaste of smokeyness and espresso, and some acridness from the roast (smoke), - this is rich stuff. Mouthfeel - very full and smooth, except for alcohol burn and slight acridness from roast, but still went down pretty good, leaving some slickness coating. Drinkability - this is a good brew, but very rich- I could go for maybe another but no more in one sitting. Also, I dislike the alcohol burn and roast byproduct acridness- but I also realize that this is probably one that improves with time, and all the components will work in harmony after aging as opposed to some of the still raw characteristics doing their own thing as a young brew (just like wine oftentimes- ready to drink when you buy it, but it's much better if you let it sit for while before enjoying.) - really good stuff nonetheless.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Smell is of ultra strong espresso, hints of dark chocolate, iceberg lettuce and vapors of alcohol...very nice.  Sweet alcohol that quickly turns bitter as the dark roasty malts do their stuff and the hops re-inforce to the finish. The taste is much the same as the smell with a medium body and smooth mouthfeel.

At first i thought it was BB 1/11/03, but it's actually BB 1/03/2011. They give this beer a 5 year expiration date.  Appearance: When poured into a Snifter, it was black as motor oil with hardly any light coming through it. I just got a little skim of tan colored foam that dissipated fast leaving very little fizzy rings and no lace.  Smell: When I first popped the cap, the aroma of hops came gushing out. When it settled the hops were still there as well as some roasted malt, dark chocolate, and some dark fruits in the background.  Taste: It had an excellent taste of dark chocolate and dark roasted malt in the front, some dark fruits in the middle, and the end there was a nice bitter pine hops taste. I did notice that after all those flavors there was slight alcohol taste. I knew that it had to have somekind of alcohol aftertaste since this beer clocks in a 9.1 ABV.  Mouthfeel: Thick, full bodied, and with this strong bitter taste that doesn't seem to want to leave. It could be either the bitter chocolate or bitter hops.

On the palate, this beer starts off strong and sweet, then gives way to roasted malts and an intense alcoholic burn.

345,1013,Vibbly,4.77,"This one is from memory, but I've had enough Storm King that it should work out alright:  The labeling is cool, and it pours ridiculously dark and thick, with decent head that sticks around for a while. The smell is extremely rich and almost fruity, like a liqueur. It's hard to describe, but it almost smells smooth. The carbonation is at a great level, and so the mouthfeel is neither too fizzy nor too thick and syruppy--it tastes smooth too. It's not a chuggable session beer by any means, but it's not something that gets harsh or abrasive as the bottles pile up.  Taste-wise, it's almost hard to describe, because it's almost an elemental thing to me--it tastes like storm king. But since I have to try: it's very rich without too many burnt flavors, and sweet (cherries, maybe) without being at all cloying. it's very hoppy, but the bitterness dosn't push the other flavors to the side.  Basically, I'm just adding my voice to the chorus of Storm King supporters. As far as I'm concerned, this is Victory's best, and that's saying a good deal considering the beers they put out. It was one of the first things that got me into beer, and it's becoming a longterm favorite.  Side Note: I've had this on tap (at Victory's brewpub) and it tastes sweeter, syruppier, and generally less complicated. It's still delicious, but if you go to the brewery--and I recommend it to anyone that can manage the drive--I would recommend getting stuff that you can only get on tap.

It drinks like a 6 percent beer but hits like a 9 (since it is a 9). Pairs well with beers that mesh with a shitload of hops. This is the hophead stout.

I had a sample of this on tap at D.B.A. in New York and it won me over enough to buy a six pack the next day. It's so smooth. The steak I paired this with for this pout brought out the intensity of the roasted malts, and the genuine sweetness. Mouthfeel is full, and just carbonated enough...not too syrupy in body, decievingly light in mouthfeel for the intensity of flavor.

This very robust flavor starts off as sweet caramel toffee, coffee and chocolate. Transforms into a very biting citrus hop bitterness.

345,1013,RJLarse,4.23,"I picked up a Storm King Stout at a local specialty shop to taste and review. I poured this beer in to a pint tumbler. .  Pours a jet black brew and is opaque. One finger of beige/brown head is fairly resilient, but dissipates to a quarter inch film and produces some lacing on the sides of the glass.  The smell is fairly strong and sweet. It smells a little like coffee with fruit elements and a hint of alcohol (spirits) as well.  The taste is quite rich and robust. The flavor is very complex. There is a decided bitter charcoal flavor, and also a smoky and slightly sweet coffee and chocolate flavors. There is a mild hop finish, which takes the flavor full circle back to the bitter charcoal flavor. The flavors are reasonably well balanced, but it may be a little over-hopped to the exclusion of the malt. The aftertaste is remarkably short-lived, taken over by the hops and is slightly bitter.  The mouth feel is a little thick and heavy. The beer is very mildly carbonated.  This is a drinkable beer, but with its higher ABV (9.1%) Im not sure Id want to have more than a couple in a sitting (especially at $2.75 a bottle), and I wouldnt want to drink them very fast. But this is a outstanding stout, and a beer drinking experience well worth having. I would definitely have a Storm King Stout again. Ill look for an occasion.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,SilentSabre,4.53,"This will be my second review on this beer. The reason for that is simple. My first review was on a fresh sample. This review is on a bottle with a date of 18Nov 2003. This aged specimen is very similar in appearance to a fresh sample. Black, cream coloured head; nice lace. The smell seems a bit hoppier and a bit less malty than a fresh one. There's also more fruit present. It is still very enjoyable, just different. The taste is substantially different IMO. The chocolate that is present in a fesh sample is very diminished. There is, however, a toasted sensation on the finish that is very pleasant. The mouthfeel is smooth as silk. Incredible!! This is certainly a beer that ages well (if kept properly, of course), and even at 9.1%, the drinkability after aging this long is amazing.

345,1013,Sixpack595,2.98,"I don't get it. This beer isn't very good. Tastes like a burnt American style IPA. Yea, the guys who brew this really like to add hops... Sadly it tastes like thats about all they did. Dumped a bunch of hops into a kettle of middle of the road stout. Roasty, burnt, astringint taste. Flat, very little head. On the plus side it hides the high ABV quite well, and the mouthfeel was medium bodied. I'm really disapointed in this one sinve the other Victory brews I've had are better. Overhyped.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,macster,4.2,"Bottle served at 55*. Pours black and opaque as night while developing a dense tan head. Didnt appear as viscous on the pour as other big Imp Stouts. Moderate nose of dark roasted coffee, dark chocolate, charred wood and hops. Palate was creamy and smooth, without being slick or oily. Attractive taste of espresso coffee and lots of charcoal notes with a minerally dryness mid-palate. The hops certainly make a strong play here keeping any cloying sweeetness at bay and providing a notable crisp and pleasant hop bitterness to the long finish. A very well balanced Impy Stout which keeps the alcohol well hidden. Top notch!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Metalmonk,4.15,"Looks like any good stout should: Impenetrable darkness with a tan head. Head doesn't retain well but the lace is abundant.  Aroma is full-on hops, kind of grassy/earthy, a bit lighter in smell than the heavier chocolate/coffee you get in most stouts. Toffee is there, with a dark grape fruitiness far back there.  For an Imperial Stout this is a seriously refreshing taste, one of few Imperials you could drink year-round. Not too heavy in the mouth but still hugely substantial. The flavors feature piney hops (I've noticed this aspect seems to diminish over the years...it's either my palate being more used to hops or the recipe changing...), followed by grape, toasted malt, espresso, cream/milk (in smoothness and flavor), followed by a piquant and bitter aftertaste that leaves the mouth happy with a pleasant tingle. Nice frothy sizzle in the mouth.  A drinkable big stout, deserving of all the high marks and raves, but there are better in the style.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,jamesdergen,4.07,"Appearance: Pours a dark, opaque espresso black with a minimal fizzy tan head that disappears rather quickly.  Smell: Nice aromas of caramel and toffee.  Taste: The first thing to hit is a rich coffee/toffee flavor that quickly gives way into a massive wall of resiny hops. The rich, roasty malt background remains throughout. The hoppiness was a lot more intense than I was expecting, but it somehow fits in incredibly well. The only detractor here is that weird overcooked vegetable taste that comes into play towards the middle of the hop invasion.  Mouthfeel: Pretty highly carbonated and a heavy mouthfeel, but that's not too surprising from an Imperial Stout.  Drinkability: A bit too intense, heavy and carbonated to drink more than one. The alcohol is well-hidden, however. This one is a sipper, and a delicious one!  A big thanks to Christian down at Cellar's for recommending this one to me. It's a great brew with huge flavors and massive complexity the likes of which I have never tasted before. A great brew.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,ricodewey,4.25,"Being a Victory fan for many years, I can say this year's Storm King batch is superb.  I must comment on the mouthfeel. Let is sit in your mouth for 30 seconds. Inhale and breath deeply the pungent cherries, dark coffee feel. At a potent 9% abv, the alcohol is clearly evident but extremely drinkable. Goes down smoothly with tones of coffee on the tongue. Goes very well with any dessert. I have been enjoying this beer for 5 years and this years batch is top-notch.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Golden2wenty1,4.28,"Picked up a single at Riley's here in Madison. ""Bottled Nov 18 05""  Pours your standard RIS black with several fingers of frothy tan bubbles and a bit of lacing. Nose is much more subtle than I was expecting - dark fruits with hints of roasted malt, coffee and milk chocolate. Taste is on the mellow side as well with caramel and toasted malts, espresso/chocolate with a hint of plum/raisin. Mouthfeel is fluffy and smooth. Alcohol is barely noticeable. I was a little disappointed that this wasn't intense and in your face, especially after the Bourbon County Stout I had this weekend, but this is still a damn tasty RIS, and insanely drinkable for 9.1%. I don't know about #8 in the world though....",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,petemoss14,4.42,"12 oz bottle. Dated Dec 13, 2005.  Been a lot of flack about this beer lately. Shall we...  Pours a dense opaque. Completely black. Two finger tan head fades to nice lace.  The aroma is quite fruity and intriguing. There's some underlying coffee, molasses, and chocolate, but I must say the overrinding aromas are those of blackberry, current, and licorice. Notes of floral hops and mild alcohol esters  Tastes of dark fruit, coffee, chocolate. Mouthfeel is disappointing at first -- seemed thin and undercarbonated. This improves greatly as the beer warms. It becomes silkier. As for the hops, they are there -- defiant, but not overwhelming. They in no way overwhelm the beer or seem out of place. And I am certainly no hophead.  Can't say that I am all that familiar with previous bottlings, but I was impressed with this one. Very drinkable for a beer of its strength. Curious to try different batches...",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,normZurawski,4.62,"This was one of the first beers I tried when I started getting into craft beer. My initial thought at the time was, ""I guess stout really isn't my stlyle."" Skeip ahead 2 months and that's changed. I find this winter I enjoy nothing but stout and the occasional Dogfish Head offering, usually the IBA. And among the stouts, Storm King is head and shoulders above the rest.  Everything about this beer is well done. The aroma is excellent, and this beer drinks as smoothly as you could hope for. Given the high ABV, it does an excellent job on the delivery, having a rich malty finish worthy of any Russian emporer. I also get some hoppiness in the finish, especially as time passes. The finish on this is really long, lasting damn near a minute after you've put the glass down, assuming you put the glass down. Very good beer, try it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

The nose is complex with scents of marcipan, smoke, caramel, burnt coffee beans and chocolate. Hops are strong but still well balanced. Nuts and roasted coffee beans up front dark chocolate and black cherries fading into the aftertaste which is a blend of dominating spiced hop flavors, sweet thick malts and a dry finish. Solid and thick as expected. Good coating. Highly drinkable just beware of it's strength.  -Oelergud",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

The body is deep, dark brown almost black. Mild coffee and acrid roasted malts back up with some citrus hops lurking around. The mouth feel isn't as big as I anticipated. Mild coffee, dark fruit like prunes and the roasted astringency are what I initially come away with but the finish is much lighter combined with the alcohol warming effect left me hanging a bit.

Good taste with the main flavors I noticed being coffee and roasted malt. Noticible alcohol taste and hop bite, but a very enjoyable drink. Medium thickness on the mouthfeel. Not a chewy stout, but it stays with you. A drinkable stout that will set you back after a few. While strong tasting it WILL sneak up on you.

345,1013,BEERchitect,4.45,"Has all of the ingredients for the perfect Stout. An Ideal color with a viscous texture and strong head retention. Ideal blend of espresso and bittersweet chocolate and a lightly powdery roasted grain quality. Enough in the nose and flaovr to demand respect. Enough heat to recognize it's potency. Still, no off balanced characters at all. No fusal alcohols, dominating hops, astingency, harshness, or accessive acidity. It grabs the throat a bit on the way down, but to be expected. Very clean for style. Difficult to criticise.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,DaggerEyes,4.53,"12 oz Bottle, dated October 31st, 2005  Pour a rich dark brown, that borders very closely on black. The rich browns are really only present when tilting the glass and holding it up to the light, and even then don't think you're going to be seeing your fingers on the other side of the glass. The beer poured with a thick head which disolved quickly leaving a delicate lace behind to hug the edges of the glass. Very thick to the eye with great retention.  The alchohol is present on the nose, as well as mild smokey and sweet scents.  This beer has a very bold taste and is very bright on the front of the tounge. Slight smokey and burnt taste, yet very pleasant. A simple and strong taste often reminiscent of Licorice. Despite it's heavy syrupy appearance this is more of a chewy medium bodied beer with a pleasantly strong ammount of carbination .  Thought the abv might prevent you from putting back a bunch of these in a night, it is none the less a true pleasure to drink",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,supernaut,3.88,"A - Poured out the typical pitch black, but with a nice creamy 2 finger head and some mild lacing. Not much initial retention though, and ends up looking kinda flat unless swirled around a bit  S - A peculiar sweetness eminates throughout the nose. Not quite sure what to make of it though.  T - Mild coffee, chocolate, licorice, and possibly some faint butterscotch (is that the sweetness I sense?) seems to poke through initially. A tad oily, with a burnt(emphasis on the burnt) caramel/malitness toward the end. The alcohol is not that much of a factor until the end, and even then it mingles decently.  M/D - Not quite as smooth and creamy as I would have envisioned, especially with the wee little dry kick at the end provided by the alcohol...(still pretty mild all things considered). Pretty drinkable despite this (especially given the ABV), but just not quite as silky as desired.  O - I noticed a discrepancy between older and newer reviews. I also noticed that I happened to sample one of the batches garnering less enthusiam (12-13-05). So maybe this batch is an outlier of sorts???  Outlier or not, this is still a very good stout.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,falloutsnow,3.82,"A: Pours a deep, dark brown in color, nearly identical to a pool of molasses. Impenetrable darkness allow for no light or visibility to occur within the beer, how mysterious. A hard pour produces a dark tan head about 1cm in height. The foam quickly dissipates into a thin field of bubbles around the perimeter and a small island in the middle of the glass. S: Strangely, the most apparent smell is of sharp, citrusy hops. As the beer warms, however, this descends into the darkness with aromas of roasted espresso beans and faint, mild milk chocolate. Hints of raisins can be smelled and become more apparent as the beer warms. T: A fine balance between citrusy hops and malt sweetness is immediately apparent from the first taste and lasts throughout the beer even as it warms. Subtle hints of burnt coffee with a sharp alcohol twinge and hop bitterness at the end. The malt backbone and alcohol presence seems to become more dominant and overpower much of the other flavors as the beer warms. M: Heavy, thick mouthfeel with well-set carbonation levels making the beer have a smooth, flowing feel. Dry finish from the hops and alcohol. D: A fine example of the imperial stout with what I feel are some unfortunate warming characteristics, the bigger alcohol burn and malt punch. At 9% ABV, this is a pretty hefty beer and the alcohol burn does not really add to much in this beer; perhaps it would be better with some aging to mellow it out. All this is, of course, tempered with a great mouthfeel, complex aroma, and good taste.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,crwills,4.52,"Not much to say about this one that hasn't already been said. I think I've had this about four times at this point, and it's always impressed me for the most part.  This particular bottle was consumed at home (the rest were elsewhere, from what I remember). Poured pitch black with a nice sized interestingly-dark head. Head faded fairly quickly, but left a lot of lacing.  Smell is malty with a lot of coffee and toffee and chocolate, but some definite (noble?) hop presence in there unlike some other sweeter Imperial Stouts. Also hints of fruits (plums and raisins), as well as a bit of alcohol bite.  Taste is very dry and bitter dark chocolate, with some serious smokiness. Almost dries out the mouth with its strong unsweetened cocoa presence. Dry chocolate aftertaste.  My only criticism of this beer is that, from my experience, it is a bit light in body for such a big beer, and compared to some other beers of the same style that I've had. It was significantly improved, however, by having a couple of pieces of good, 85% cocoa dark chocolate as I drank the beer. I highly recommend this as an experiment sometime if you can manage it.

Smells like espresso and there's some chocolate in there, too. Taste is excellent - espresso, dark chocolate, and the bitter hop finish is something I haven't experienced in many stouts (although, I haven't had that many). The alcohol is noticeable, but not in a bad way - it has a nice, warming effect that would make this perfect for a winter's night next to the fire.

I don't know if I'm drinking beer or a cup of some of the best coffee I've had all week; crisp, balanced, and punchy. It has the body of a dry, bitter stout and the noted 9.1% ABV on the label is not detectable in the mouthfeel, smell, or taste.  A truly fantastic stout.

Minimal lacing.  Aroma shows dark caramel, complex malts, burnt coffee,and a bit of bittersweet chocolate. Upon the first sip, this stout coats your tongue like motor oil, and is possibly the best balanced stout I have ever tasted. It is very heavily roasted without being astringent. Coffee, malt, caramel chocolate, burnt sugars, all held together by a solid hop back-bone. Perfectly balanced.  Like I said earlier, it coats your mouth, and the flavor lingers for quite a few minutes. Alcohol seems to be extremely well hidden, with no warming at all.

345,1013,kkipple,4.35,"Victory Storm King Stout pours an impenetrable near black, with a nice Guinness-tan foamy head that quickly subsides, leaving tons of tiny, lacing bubble on the glass. Looks rather like motor oil, and somewhat intimidating.  Put your nose to the glass and you'll be smacked in the face by a huge malty, hoppy smell. It's intense, and more than enough to get your mouth watering. This is one aromatic beer.  Taste? Well, this is simply a superb hoppy Imperial Stout. There's the heavy, deadening malt hit, you know, the bittersweet cocoa and coffee flavor, followed by an equally delightful hop bite, and finishing off smoothly, with a warm glow left by the 9% alcohol. Oh yes, this is tasty.  Mouthfeel is initially sharp, this beer certainly has a ""bite"" to it. It's eventually warming and pretty slick, with a pleasant carbonation and mildly dry finish.  Drinkability? For me, this is pretty much a ""one and done"" beer. It's just too rich and filling and alcoholic. *Maybe* two over the course of a long night, but I'd be hard pressed to even do that. This is hardly a knock against the beer, as it really saves you money in the long run. :) Storm King remains a superb Imperial Stout, and one that you should make a point to try if you enjoy the style.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Bitterness is just right followed by a slight sweetness of cocoa and berries to mix it up a bit. Despite the high alcohol content, the alcohol did not seem to overpower the other tastes.

Within the first few sips, you pick up some coffee flavor. A few sips later, this flavor becomes more evident, and bitter like bittersweet dark chocolate. It's creamy too. Further along in the glass, a burnt sensation stays with you constantly. A little bit more and it would be too much. Not unlike a cup of coffee that needs two more lumps.

A slight alcohol is definately present in the nose. So is a smoky, charred fruitiness.  In the mouth, this is a real strong contender. Smooth and warm going down - with a nice sweet maltiness on the back of the tounge. The alcohol is highly present. The hop character is hard to define - it seems to be trying to be something more than its not. The finish is too medicine like.  Musings: I would have to say if I reviewed this 5 years ago - I would be discussing a different beer. The hop nature of this beer now is all over the place - it has no direction at all.

Smell: Mocha, chocolate, deep hop undertones intermixed with classic stout aromas.  Taste: Wow, where to start with this one? Certainly an interesting hop profile for a stout. Mild oil hops are interlaced into a malt character of chocolate, coffee, toffee, caramel. The presence of alcohol was interesting. It almost tasted as if the boys over at Victory had soaked some chips in bourbon and mixed them into the brewing process. Probably not, but certainly an interesting touch.  Mouthfeel: Very slick, I'd even say a buttery diacetyl character, but used very effectively (I'm a fan of this feeling anyways). Slight carbonation.  Drinkability: For 9% this is great, certainly could have a few of these, but be careful.  Notes: Let it warm up to add to the complexity. Personally I'd say lay a few of these down and let 'em age to take out the harsh hop complexities. While now it seems that Victory gets criticism for this, and how its not how this beer used to be, I have to say I like it, and that it lives up to the hype. I don't know though, I never tasted one from the past, unfortunately. If its better, I'd be amazed.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

345,1013,JWFokker,3.96,"I'll admit, I'm not the biggest fan in the world of stouts, but the Storm King is pretty good stuff regardless of whether or not stouts are your thing.  From the bottle it pours great, jet black with a nice light tan head. If you hold it up to the light, it's completely opaque. This is serious stuff. The nose is rather mild, nothing offensive or exceptional. The palate is quite good, well balanced between hoppiness and maltiness - a definite roasted malt flavor without getting too burnt tasting like some stouts. The higher than average alcohol content is not at all intrusive. The mouthfeel is smooth as hell. Almost creamy. Altogether this adds up to a very good, well balanced beer and better than most stouts I've tried.

345,1013,JoeyHotrod,4.47,"Ah first time having The Storm King (or any Victory brew for that matter) and it no doubt won't be the last. The Stout had a bottled on date of Dec 14th of 2004.  The Stout poured into my Guinness pint glass with a small tan head, that faded somewhat quickly, but left a nice lacing through the duration. Truly a beautiful beer to look at. Black as the night, with not the slightest hint of light showing through.  The smell was a unique mix of roasted malt, alcohol and hops. To my surprise the hops stood out the most of the three. All in all a unique smell and somewhat more hoppy than what I'm accoustomed to in most stouts. The smell was inviting me to taste and what a treat I was in for...  Again the hops stood out from the get go. Wow this is truly some good stuff here guys! To a lesser degree there's the traditional rosted malt, more than a hint of dark chocolate and a definite coffee taste. All in all quite complex and definitely not a disappointment given the hype the beer gets.  For being a 9 plus percent beer, this stuff could come back and hurt a person a little too quickly for comfort. If what some claim and this used to be alot better, I must admit to being somewhat jealous of those who were able to drink the 'better' samples. If this stuff was distributed in Missouri, I would buy it on a regular basis.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Smell is superior for a stout. The best I've experienced. Floral hops are present - along with hints of espresso, chocolate, and strong coffee. Smell of alcohol is faint considering the ABV. Taste is superior. Mouth feel smooth. Slight bitterness up front and finishes very clean. Taste is a mixture that starts like coffee but finishes sweet and hoppy. Unbelievably delicious. These go down dangerously easy.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Mitchel,4.32,"Storm King by Victory pours a dark, dark brown with a bulky mocha head which rapidly dissipates but leaves sub-par lacing. It smells like dark chocolate, blackberries and a hint of vanilla. Just a modest quantity of alcohol tang in the nose.  There is a lot going on here, but nothing overpowering. There are some muted hops peeking out from the burnt malt and alcohol tastes. I will say that this beer is creamy and smooth though. It tastes like burnt chocolate, molasses and is slightly earthyalmost woody. In the end, there is a bit of sweetness that shines through the calm spicy darkness.  I like it! It is good and goes down smooth! Lots going on here and lots to take pleasure in. This is one of the best if not the best stout that I have ever had. Hey Guinness drinkers, eat it!

345,1013,johnniemarg,4.5,"From a 12oz bottle into a delerium tremens tulip. The bottle says enjoy by Jan 3, 2011...cellaring obviously an option. Pours an opaque black with a nice brown head. Nice lacing. I read someone else not impressed with the lacing, but it's nice on mine.  Smells fantastic. Dark chocolate and espresso, with an underlying toffee caramel sweetness. It smells like a Scharfenberger (San Francisco chocolatier) mocha chocolate bar tastes. If you can find one, try it.  Taste is mostly the espresso and caramel. The chocolate is there but not as strong as in the nose. The caramel malt is so smooth throughout.  Nice thick and frothy mouthfeel. One swish in your mouth and it's almost like whipped cream. Wow.  This is so good. I have had this on draft before and don't remember it being this good because on draft I thought it tasted somewhat chalky. I must have gotten one out of a bad keg before. Becaue that's not the case right now. I recommend this in the biggest way. I gave this 4.5s across the board as I think maybe I'll give the DFH WWS a higher mark here or there.

345,1013,bearrunner44,4.08,"Appearance- Pitch black, with a tan head. The color of the head is similar to that of cookie dough, and the pour creates a nice cascading effect.  Aroma- Contains the usual roasted malt characteristics, but it also has a hop profile that's unusually big for the style. Rosey, sweet alcohol scents are detectable in the background.  Taste- Wonderful, silky-smooth mouthfeel; it slides effortlessly around the mouth. Mild malt flavors up front, providing a caramel sweetness without the usual stout dryness. Big, juicy hop finish. The high ABV is definitely noticeable up front, but the citric hops cover it up in the finish. It's ""softer"" than most stouts. The overall bitterness is subdued, and most of the bite comes from the hops and alcohol rather than the malt.  Verdict- Supple, smooth and juicy; an interesting take on the style.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Consistency of warm honey.  Terrific aroma. Lots of fruity and citrusy hops. Alcohol aroma and chocolate. Huge coffee aroma as well. This is a wonderful smelling beer that makes me very eager to jump in and drink this little piece of heaven.  Where to start. Fresh hops taste. Huge on the coffee. Chocolate. Dried plums. Very fresh tasting. A wonderfully tasting and complex beer.  Perfectly creamy body and nice hop bitterness. High alcohol content but extremely drinkable at 9.1%. Glad I bought this.

It poured with an opaque, almost black body and a sturdy and attractive dark, fluffy and consistent head. The nose is sensational for an imperial; malty at first, but accompanied by a grapefruit/citrus background. The mouthfeel is full and robust, asserting itself that this is a beer to be reckoned with. At first, it appears nutty/chocolatey. Then a wave of IPA flavors hit. But its not overwhelming, it is complimentary in the rudimentary essence of the word. The citrus and grapefruit flavors do such justice. The finish is almost like an IPA as well, with a bitterly dry puckering aspect. The grapefruit sits at the back of the palate for good.

345,1013,grandq,4.33,"Ok, a first review. And I'll qualify the following as this is following a couple of cream stouts, so pardon any taste bias/ inebriation.  A - Black as night, or a storm as might be more apropos. Tornados likely  S - Espresso... and citrus? a tiny bit smoky, a tiny bit of licorice.  T - Great! Much hoppier than my usual favorite Imperials (Stone, Southampton, North Coast), but a nice change. A bit of fruitiness to it (fig?) and the hops have a nice coffee-esque profile. As it warms, i get a bit of caramel, nicely balanced with the coffee/espresso.  M - Exactly what I look for. Thick without feeling oily, dissipates off the tongue slowly and leaves enough dry bitterness to prompt another sip. I could repeat the cycle ad nauseum. And am doing so as I type.  D - Very high, but again, my preference lies toward the lower IBU range. Occupies a nice spot between stout and ipa.

Floral, piney hops sting the nostrils right away. There is a roasty chocolate and coffee scent down there somewhere, too, but I think it's drowning in hop oil. Brazen hoppiness dominates the flavor throughout and throttles a newborn roasted espresso malt bill, leaving it twitching in death throes on the sticky floor. Assertive alcohol notes. Spicy with so much hoppiness. Prickly carbonation and hop spiciness cover over what I'm certain with time will become a beautifully slick and oily mouthfeel. RIS purists may find the ridiculous amount of hops in this beer to be sacrilege. I freakin' love it. But what do I know? I'm in love with hops.

Body is straight black with no light coming through. Head is tan with some nice lace down the glass.  Scent is dry and hoppy. Spices, chocolate, and an underlying alcohol element.  The flavors include roasted malt, coffee, spiced chocolate, and hops. As with just about everything Victory makes this has more hops than it's style usually would boast, which is fine by me.

Very slight tinge of alcohol flavor.  Mouthfeel is medium, not nearly as heavy as other stouts. Has an astringent quality, a little oily. Would probably benefit with lots and lots of aging.

The taste is smooth and very complex without the overstated hops that imp stouts are known for. This beer is easy to drink which at 9.2% ABV is not necassarily a good thing. The price point ($11) and accolades on the box kind of go overboard touting this beer. Yes it is good, yes it is complex, but I was left wanting a little more mouth feel.

T&M- Smooth and creamy, great mouth feel. Touch of fusel alcohol, muted fruitiness is lost within the alcohol character. Kiss of oily hops in the middle. Boarderline astrigent burnt flavor with a modest malt sweetness undetneath. Middle to end are waves of harsh burnt malt and faint alcohol.  D- Not as pleasing as it used to be, pretty damn harsh and not as complex either. I'll have to make some strong black and tans to go through the rest of the six-pack.  *** OLD REVIEW *** 09/10/2001  Presentation: 12 oz brown longneck bottle, no freshness date but this beer's strength alone gives it a very long shelf life.  Appearance: Pitch black liquid with a slow motion cascading effect after a hard pouring, the hard pouring yielded a dense and rocky light tan head that faded away as fast as a glacier moves.  Smell: Fresh hop leaf similar to tobacco cigar leaves with a bitter hop oil within, black currants and fresh ground espresso in the aroma also. A very mild rummy alcohol smell is noticeable, smells of chocolate cover rum soaked cherries.  Taste: Thick and creamy with a full and flexed body, smooth with minimal carbonation from the hard pouring ... even with a normal pouring there probably would be, at most, a moderate carbonation level. Roasted bitterness flavour draws long as well as the demanding hop character. Heavy hand of sweetness from front to middle with sweetened espresso and a black berry fruitiness. Hops kick in hard and flail around flavours of citrus, earth and leaf ... as soon as it peaks the roasted gives a one two punch of charcoal and dark chocolate. Roasted flavours intensify in the finish with a hitchhiking hop bitterness that just won't let go. After taste is endless.  Notes: This one goes down as one of the greatest, not just one of the greatest Imperial Stouts but as one of the greatest beers in the world. As close to perfection as you can get.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Hops dominate the nose but there are also various burnt aromas with some malty caramel sweetness. The rich, intense palate includes a complex variety of bitter burnt flavors (definite roasted coffee, but also bakers chocolate and more) with a touch of malty sweetness. All of this, however, is balanced nicely by a robust hop profile. Mouthfeel is moderately thick with decent carbonation.  The combination of rich burnt flavors and intense hop bite make this a brew with some forceful, but delicious bitterness. Surprisingly drinkable for a beer with 9% ABV.

Poured into my Duvel tulip.  Appearance- Maybe the most black pour I have ever seen, as well as the thickest. Not quite motor oil thickness, but definite texture in the pour. The top of the brew looks as if there is a reddish hue, maybe like a zinfandel port or something. Off white, brownish head at first, which soon fades. Light lacing left.  Smell- Coffee, chocolate, alcohol and deep roasted malts.  Taste- Pretty sweet flavor with a coffee and chocolate mixture than comes into play. Not super dark malty, which I was expecting. Maybe it has mellowed out. Good hop bit for sure, and a light smoked twinge to it.  Mouthfeel- Lower carbonation, thick and sticky. My lips were sticking together after this one.

Taste was quite unexpected, malty and full in the style but a lot more hoppy character than i bargained for. This is like three beers in one, starts off like any good stout...malty slight chocolate and coffee. Next a round of hop piney, and tart takes over the palate.

When I saw it in the store I was pleased to see something new, so I gave it a try.  The first pour showed me that I was up against a true stout with an impossibly dark body. A fine tan head formed with a touch of lacing. My initial sniff reveal my fears. Hops and a lot of hops. I like the smell, but get tired a big taste of hops so I was concerned. Further smells reveals hints of smokiness and coffee and chocolates. I'm impressed with the smell.  My first taste gave a some hopiness along with the expected smokey stoudness. This is soon followed by a decent amount of bitterness in the back of the mouth. Alcohol is evident too which is expected. The hopiness is perfect. It is ubundant, but necessary for this brew. Further tastes provides great depth of flavors already described.  I drank the first brew with a burger and fries (left overs). What a combo, this is truely something goes well with food. It also goes well on it's own as well as on it's own as my second glass showed me the next day. This is a near perfectly drinkable beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,cubedbee,4.67,"12 oz bottle bottled 9/27/05. Pours a dark oil black, absolutely opaque, a thin beige head, some small amount of lacing. Nose is a combination of roasted malt, chocolate, caramel and big floral and piney hops, very appetizing. Taste is more of the same hoppy roasted goodness, espresso, dark chocolate, roasted malt, chocolate covered cherries, lots of great stout flavors, all infused with wonderful resinous bitter hops. I've just gotten into hoppier dark roasted beers, and this is the best balanced of the lot I've tried (Alpha Klaus, Black Sun, Yeti), really showcasing the hop flavors, but still allowing the dark roasted stout tastes to showcase. Excellent beer, can't believe I haven't tried this local stuff before, need to stock up immediately.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,becktone,4.88,"The beer is black, pitch black. It forms a nice creamy tan head. The lacing property of this beer is also very appetizing. I don't think they look much better than this. Head retention is good as well.  The smell of this beer is that of chocolate and roasted malts. I can also smell a hint of alcohol. There is something in the smell I can't put my finger on. In addition to that the aroma of this beer slightly reminds me of a RIS. Perhaps there is also a dark fruit aroma and flavor to this beer as well.  This beer tastes great. There is a big malt influence here. The sweeness on the front of the tongue is followed by a big chocolate and roasted flavor near the back of the mouth. There is also a very familiar taste accompained by that as well, however I can't put my finger on it. Perhaps it is the hops. This brew has a lingering aftertaste of the roasted flavor. Even when I burp the taste of that is exceptionally good as well. This is some high quality beer. I really don't get any bitter notes from this one, but I could be wrong. In any case this beer is great.  Storm King Stout has a nice full bodied mouthfeel to it. The light carbonation compliments the style well. I don't think that something that tastes like this should be highly carbonated. Just doesn't seem like it would mix to well. The beer is smooth and easy to drink. This is one beer that I will probably buy every season.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,cooncat,4.7,"Serving from a bottle, dated 11/2005, and served at about 60 deg. F.  The pour is done with care, in order to keep the head to a manageable size. Tan head lasts quite some time, and after it has diminished, a swirl of the glass brings beautiful lacing. Color is DARK - Opaque! Like looking into a black hole, no light escapes.  The nose is incredible. Chocolate, coffee and licorice are abundant. A slight fruit aroma adds to the intrigue.  The first sip explodes on your palate, with intense flavors as mentioned above. In addition, a smoky flavor adds to this awesome brew. Yes, there is a noticable hop bite present, even with the intense flavors continually exploding on your tongue. Considerable alcohol presence is also noted.  To the end, this is a remarkable Imperial Stout - World class in my opinion. The mouthfeel is so rich and warming; you want to savor each sip for several minutes.  This would be the perfect beer to highlight the end of a perfect day. It could be a meal in itself ... or a dessert. This is one brew that will not disappoint.  Cheers!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

The aroma is of cream, and crackers with undercurrents of roasted malt and bitterness. It is rather weak, however, for suck a big brew. The taste lives up to expectations. It is big and bold, but not abrasive. It is malty and bitter, with a nice alcoholic aftertaste. The mouthfeel is exceptionally smooth and creamy, with perfect carbonation.

Very good roasty toasty flavor of caramel, chocolate, and toffee with a dry bitter, black coffee finish. This beer is very balanced and delicious.

The flavor has a strong toasted malt backbone which is simultaneously sweet, bitter, and quite complex with espresso and chocolate flavors. Also there are plenty of citrusy hops which I like quite a bit in this brew. This beer is very full bodied and coats the mouth very nicely. Pretty drinkable and the alcohol is not really evident at all. Overall this is an awesome and tremendous beer- worthy of great respect.

Simultaneously sweet and bitter. Rich. Very dark tasting, thick, malty, sticky (not quite cloying), with toasted malt flavors. Take the time to let this beer warm up, and out come the mocha flavors.  In the finish, there is a lingering dryness at the back of my tongue, I like.  This beer hides its 9.1% alcohol very well. It tastes strong but not from the alcohol.  Full bodied, moderate carbonation and exceptionally drinkable for how full it is. This is one good beer.

345,1013,SacoDeToro,4.34,"Poured a deep black with a minimal tan head that dissipated quickly. The aroma was heavy on the dark malt and alcohol with hops in the background. The flavor was bold and roasty, but relatively dry for this style - malty, yes, but not on the sweet side compared to many Russian imperial stouts like North Coast's Rasputin and Avery's The Czar. Maybe that's why it's been categorized in the ""American Double Stout"" category. It really doesn't have that British yeastiness that many Russian imperial stouts have. Although the hops are somewhat there in the aroma, they really dominate in the finish. This is an intense beer, but if you like ""mad flava,"" it's one for you. Think of it as analagous to an American Double IPA.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Mouth is rich, long bitter smokiness int he finish. A definite coffee aftertaste. Really good stuff. A nice afterdinner sipper.

345,1013,JerzDevl2000,4.3,"Heard a lot of good things about this beer, and I tend to like Victory's offerings. Bought this last week with a lot of anticipation in mind, and for me...this was quite interesting, to say the least!  Beer poured amazingly well. Nice and dark, smooth, and over two finger's worth of head. It nearly overflowed from my pint glass! The lacing on the side is reminiscent of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and every sip got better and better as it warmed up. Lots of hop bitterness, but there isn't a single flavor that dominates. Notes of espresso, chocolate, currant, cherries, and licorice can be found here, and contrary to what some people said on here, the 9.1% ABV can very subtly be tasted, but it does not detract from the flavor or the overall ambiance of this brew.  This was a good beer, but I have had, in my opinion, better stouts. Still, one could not go wrong drinking what is arguably Victory's greatest concoction, although I would not recommend this as an introductory stout. Instead, I would warm people up on less complex versions of this style and then bring them to this. It would be well worth the wait and quite the reward for the experienced stout drinker...",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,jp32,4.46,"Pours black as night, with an enormous, thick, brown layer of foam. Quite possibly one of the best looking beers I've ever poured. The tan bubbles of carbonation look magnificent rising along the sides of the glass.  Aroma is of sweet roasted malts and subtle hops. A touch of bittersweet chocolate and coffee top it off.  The flavor is much more complex than the nose leads on. It has all the characteristics of the smell, along with honey, espresso, nuts, black licorice, and maybe a touch of cherries or other fruits in the finish. Very nicely balanced beer. No single flavor jumps out and dominates the beer, which I feel happens all too often.  The mouthfeel is terrifficly full and heavy-bodied with supreme smoothness for its style and high abv. Very smooth.  Drinkability is great. It would be real easy to down these in a hurry without noticing its high alcohol content. Very nice beer. I really cant say enough good things about it.

345,1013,gotbeer,4.16,"Finally getting around to reviewing this one. The bottle reviewed was brewed in Nov. 2005.  My favorite memory of this brew was truly historical. I was drinking Storm King on the night of a full moon when the Red Sox ended an 86 year old curse. I literally had one in my hand when Keith Foulke flipped the ball to Doug M. for the final out in Game 4 versus the Cards. I now believe this beer to have some sort of special powers as drinking a lesser brew probably would have allowed the Sox to have a historical collapse.  Anyway, the smell of this beer is not overwhelming. It doesn't set you up for what you are in for. Some roasty malt smell and that's about it. The beer pours black as night with a dark colored head that fades somewhat quickly.  The taste blows you away. The mouthfeel is thick and syrup like. Cherries, coffee, roasted malt, and a bite of hops and alcohol on the tail. Incredible complexity and flavors.  The drinkablity would be high based simply on taste. Of course if you can put away a few of a beer with this ABV you have a higher tolerance than I want to know about.  This is truly a world class beer, and one of the best stouts out there. I also believe it helped the Sox win the World Series. Cubs fans everywhere should be buying this stuff by the case.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Roasted malt body holds up chocolate, coffee, what I think is vanilla, some dark fruit thats reminiscent of a beglain strong dark. Body is medium, finish is dry with traces of tobacco.  M: Super creamy and luscious. This beer is like a melted malted milkshake in your mouth. Just delicious and one of my favorite aspects.  D: A nightcap sorta brew for me, though not as thick and heavy as other imperials. Great to have in the fridge and enjoy on these snowy New England nights.

The smell was quite herbal, a cross between raw cookie dough and wood stain, the first sips were undrinkably thru the roof hoppy.The mellowing came and the consistency turned into sweet grape soda. Then it taste like drinking coffee out of an oak cup.  I am not knocking this beer by rating it just around four- but the hops are just too damn much for what I consider a stout.

345,1013,HogHill,4.05,"Purchased as a single from Colonial. Poured into a Stone Russian Imperial stout glass.  Appearnce: dark brown, not quite black. A short tan head is reduced to lace in moments.  Aroma: roasted malts, a burntness as well coupled with some chocolate.  Taste: Very malty, definitely has that burnt roasty flavor. Feels substantial to the palette, low carbonation.

345,1013,RedwoodGeorge,3.6,"Pours a thick black with a reasonable dirty tan head. The foam breaks down very quickly and leaves no collar or lacing on the glass.  The nose is quite nice - some very deep roasted grains with just a touch of toffee and vanilla. Perhaps a suggestion of hops but nothing prominent in the nose. There are, however, hops in the flavor. Still in the background but some reasonably aggressive bitter resinous notes that help dry out the stout nicely. Primary flavors are roasted coffee notes just this side of burnt toast with no hints of sweetness or chocolate to be found. I trust the label when they say there's 9.1 % ABV in there but no sweet alcohol flavors and no burn at all. (Plenty of evidence when I stand up though!)  Mouthfeel is good. Surprisingly light bodied with minimal carbonation - where the bubbles might clear the palate the job is instead left to the bitter malts and the noticable hop character. No oily residue and a pleasantly clean, dry finish.  Overall rather disappointing. Even if I disregard the high esteem this beer is held in I'd have only rated it a middling Imperial Stout. It's okay for a dry stout but frankly Black Hart has a much more interesting, aggressive hop profile. It doesn't compare well to the sweeter Imperials (Rasputin, Black Bear, Fat Dog, Yeti) so that just leaves a good but unexciting stout.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

345,1013,Phatz,4.5,"I had this on tap today right form the source, sitting at Victory's Brewpub, and it was fantastic. Appearance: When the waitress brought it to the table it looked jet-black. Tipping the beer in the glass is the only way to make it look any less then midnight black. It is completely opaque. Absolutely no light getting through this beer. I did not get to see the head on it this time because (as I said) I was waiting on a waitress and by the time it got to me the head was gone. However I have had this beer a number of times and as I recall there is usually a moderate head.  Smell: The aroma is not at all an overpowering one (a bit subtle for a Stout) but there is a noticeable bitterness combined with the sent of coffee makes me want to have this with my breakfast. After the coffee aroma I get a bit of chocolate and dark fruit buried in a bit of alcohol dangling in my nose.  Taste: Instantly I think of classic roast coffee, followed quickly by a thought of black espresso as I swallow. (it must be the semi-bitter) Then I notice the chocolate, but not a sweet chocolate taste maybe more of a dark semi-bitter chocolate. It is hard to describe this flavor. It does give you a lot to think about, yet it is easy drinking. For a Stout, this is not an overly sweet beer. It has just the right amount of hops and bitter to be able to notice them but not to be overwhelmed by it either. I really enjoy this taste.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is full; very full, but not heavy and chewy. The carbonation is just enough to lighten the dark thick flavor and leave you with a very pleasant feeling on your tongue.  Drinkability: DANGEROUS! For a Stout this does go down remarkably easily. I have taken a Growler home and ... well I'll just say I got hurt! ;) So be careful. You do NOT feel the 9.1% ABV until ... later. After a few of these though, it does start to sit heavy in your stomach so don't plan on it for all night drinking. Enjoy!  Hope this is helpful. Cheers!  BTW {additional notes: This is a beer that is definitely best on tap or growler. The bottles for some reason seem to have a little less of the same smooth creamy feel as it does on-tap. Also, although it is the same beer, it seems to have a stronger hop characteristic in the bottle. Point, I recommend visiting Victory if you get the chance.}",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Aroma is primarily of piney, spicy hops, with undertones of rich chocolate malt and a whiff of alcohol. Some notes of hearty bread and mocha are also to be found. Palate is rich, complex, and well-balanced between the boatloads of spicy aromatic hops and the rich, assertive chocolate malt. A slightly sweet biscuit character emerges right up front, but fades quickly. Notes of coffee and dried plums linger on the finish. Body is rich and creamy, yet leaves a relatively dry finish.

345,1013,VoodooBrew,4.7,"I found this in the beer store by my parents' house in Maryland. I like Victory so I had to snatch it up.  I'd say the most pleasant aspect of this beer is its big hop character. In most cases it seems that your Double/Imperial Stouts feature huge malt and alcohol that totally dwarf their hop profiles. Well Victory found a way to showcase all three without the beer falling out of balance. As a hop lover, I was most pleasantly surprised by this. Furthermore, I found Storm King to be much more drinkable than many of its peers. Lots of beers in this style have so much (dark) malt that they coat your palate and are hard to enjoy more than one or two at a time. I won't say that Storm King had a thin mouthfeel by any means, but for a Double Stout, it comes darn close to being downright refreshing.  BA indicates this is a top 5 beer. I'm not quite sure where it fits in the global echelon but this is a very very very excellent beer and to date probably the best Big Stout I've had.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Zorro,4.78,"This sample was bottled Sep 27, 2005 and sampled at cellar temperature.  Pours a jet black beer with a TALL brown head that almost overflows the glass.  Smell is a little sweet with a powerful load of hops that would do a hardcore Double IPA justice, but this isn't any IPA. Notable alcohol vapors accentuate the spicy smell of the hops, only lack of complexity keep this from getting a 5. Lesser scents of coffee and chocolate sneak past the hops but this is a hop heavy beer.  Taste is thick creamy chocolate and coffee with a vanilla aftertaste to begin with. Sour and bitter flavors develop next mostly from the dark roasted malts, but the oak aftertaste is all from hops. Pleasant stomach warming appears rather quickly just to let you know this is stronger than it tastes, alcohol is completely hidden in the flavor. The sour flavors soon develop in to the sour wine like snap you get from a good Latin American coffee served black. This is quite an interesting stout emphasizing a different take on the style; tart black coffee not roasted to death in the Italian style. This is more like a pre-yuppie cup of black coffee with no pretensions on being European this or that; this is American.  Mouthfeel is good, but not thick.  Quite a drinkable strong beer here. I do recommend this to anyone who likes stouts, as this is both good and unique.

345,1013,Winter,4.63,"Review #400.  Victory has come to Wisconsin and the arrival of Storm King was the one from the line that I was looking forward to finding most and finally being able to try. I had already sampled Hop Devil, Golden Monkey and Old Horizonal after finding them in Chicago a few years ago, but it was Storm King that elluded me until now.  A thick brown head sits atop a body that's as black as a moonless, starless night sky. Aroma of expresso, cream, sweet cocoa with hints of dark fruit and alcohol. The mouthfeel is full-bodied and luscious. Introductory flavors of sinful dark chocolate and burnt malt. Expresso coffee and cocoa follow. Assertive (but balanced) hop bitterness towards the back sets this apart from most other Imperial stouts. The 9.1% alcohol is barely detectable which makes this an even more dubious offering. One of the best, for certain.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

The taste begins with some big roasted malt notes (expresso and dark chocolate), big hop character (floral, grassy, citrus), some blackstrap molasses, dark fruits, mild alcohol and chicory.

The head didn't appear to be very creamy but still exhibitade some lacing. The aroma and taste definitely got more acute and impressive with time and an increase of temperature. It had the aroma of very dark fruits and sweet dark malt. Lots of hops and dark chocolate. I was eager to give it a try and as I said, tried it while too cold; don't make the mistake, serve it slightly chilled, not icy. Anyhow, the taste blew my mind....bitter chocolate, dark candied fruits, alcohol (yet not overpowering), mild roasted coffee, malts and hops. It got so much mroe chocolaty as it warmed, and the taste grew generlaly more complex and enjoyable. It finished slightly acidic-tasting, like chewing on a coffee bean, but still remained smooth. I have to admit, this lives up to its rating. This is one of the finest examples of an Imperial I have ever had. it was smooth, warming and had a complexity of flavor I rarely find.

345,1013,ALESwhatCURESya,4.53,"2005 Batch  Appearance: Deep, burnt black that was completely opaque. Although the darkness was very powerful, you could see that the body would not have a creamy, thick feel. The mocha head left traces all over the glass beautifully. A thin layer was present until the last drop.  Aroma: Huge hop presence right off the chute. Hop oils blended nicely with the small roasted, coffee-like hints in the background. For a double stout, this was a little over the top on the hops, but at this point I am stripping the classified ""American Double Stout"" from my mind and just judging by taste.  Taste and Mouthfeel: WoW is this beer incredible. Like the aformentioned dismissing of style, this beer is unlike any others I have come across. The buttload of west coast hops just plays with your tastebuds but mellows out beautifully in the finish where the stout characteristics come through. A roasted, ground coffee flavor is evident along with a bittersweet chocolate. And just as those rich flavors come though, another round of hops coats the mouth with perfect balance.  Drinkability: With a blindfold, I would have a hard time distinguishing whether or not this was an IPA or not. The flavors, color, aroma, all come together wonderfully. For a 9.1% abv, this goes down dangerously smooth. I could, and plan to, have a keg of this on tap at home for the fall and winter.

Poured rich in color of a black mohogany, and formed a small head that lasted about 5 mins or so. I started off drinking and got nothing but bitterness and a strong alcohol smell. So, I let it sit while'st I played a few rounds of Call of Duty 2. After about 45 mins I tried again and wow what a difference letting your stout warm up makes. Now I could easily taste the malts, smell the bit of floral hops and could detect espresso, dark chocolate and carmel.

Average head forms, even when poured rather roughly (upwards of 18 in. above the glass) which quickly dissipates, though it's understandable given the style and ABV.  Smell: Predominately dark roasted malts smelling of fine dark chocolate. Hops are... floral, coupled with an aroma of roasted almonds and with a stark alcohol fragrance lingering behind.  Taste: A brash beverage, very asserting in all its flavors: dark chocolate, coffee, floral hops. Some molasses and tobacco (although, I think I'm going to be the only one proclaiming ""tobacco!"" on this one). This is not a stout that relies on a charming sweetness, instead opting for more ""floral"" components with a playful combination of mint, licorice, and I still contest there's tobacco in there! Why won't anyone listen to me?!  Mouthfeel: Pleasantly full, without ever being painfully thick or obnoxiously syrupy. Carbonation is spot on for my tastes. The alcohol is not overly assertive, but instead is rather relaxing. Is it just me, or does anyone else feel like they've just come out of a two-hour college lecture after drinking one of these? Yawn!  Drinkability: The Storm King is a lot like life. One minute it's there, and the nex  .  Huh.  Well, in trying to fully and completely analyze it, I seem to have exhausted my modest supply of 12 fluid ounces. Drinkability seemed good; I've had other heavier, denser stouts that I've easily gulped down without a second thought.  *Thanks to AndoBrew, my friend, for generously sharing this one with me.*",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,jaluria,4.33,"Dark black color with tan-colored head that is thick with moderate retention and excellent lacing. Aromas of dark chocolate, alcohol, and cocoa are apparent. The taste is of bitter-sweet chocolate with lingering caramelized sugar flavors that blends into a hoppy bitterness. The aftertaste is smooth and bready with a warming alcohol sensation.

345,1013,waldowin,4.12,"Poured from a bottle with ""Bottled Nov 18 04"" stamped on the side. This is one of my favorite of all-time beers, I'm definitely anxious to see how this stuff aged!  Pours a thick, roasted black, with no highlights. No head at all was visible, but some carbonation managed to work its way through the soup.  Smells very strongly of cherries. Cherries, chocolate, and alcohol all smack you in the nose when you lean over this glass, almost like a subdued Worldwide.  Tastes of chocolate and cherries throughout, with grapefruit splashing through in the end, almost hiding the alcohol. This is tasty stuff indeed! The alcohol is very apparent in the finish.  Mouthfeel is thick, viscous, and big, with just a hint of carbonation to help it move through your mouth. Leaves salt on your lips, and cherries in your mouth, just perfect for another sip.  Watch the ABV on this one! It's so smooth it's easy to just knock it back. Definitely worth taking your time and savoring.  Thanks to IrishRedRock for this one!

345,1013,masterkush,3.96,"Bottled on Oct. 13, 2005. Poured into gold rimmed pilsner I got from Scotland.  Poured a nice vicous black. I can hold this up to the light and see some red hues coming through. There is not much head on this one, although it does produce some nice lacing.  Slightly hoppy nose, more than I expected for a stout. It comes through in the first taste but finishes off with a nice creamy texture that coats my mouth and throat.  This beer pours excited and its hard to get a feel for it in the first few sips. I really enjoyed this beer after letting it settle for a bit and warm up. Then the true character comes through. It reminds me of drinking a good cup of coffee, right around the time it cools down enough you can enjoy it but before it becomes too cold.  It has a complex flavor, bold upfront and smoothing out at the end. it leaves you with a taste that you want to let linger but you also want to try it again.  Drinkability is high on this one. it makes you keep coming back. The high ABV is well hidden, so don't let this take you by surprise.  A quality beer, Victory comes through on this one. Not the #1 on my stout list, but it is definitely a beer I would like to have around on a cold night.  --The Kush Man",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Faint hints of chocolate and light coffee, along with roasted malts and some hops.  Taste was of coffee, bittersweet chcolate, a nice roastiness from the dark malts, vanilla and a mild hoppy finish. The hops lingers on the tongue. The alcohol is very well hidden.  The mouthfeel is mildly carbonated, smooth, with a fairly thick body. A very good balance between the hops and malts.

345,1013,bunn4funn,3.43,"11/10/05 bottled on 10/31/05 (fresh) reveiwed in my favorite snifter with my brother.   A- Black poured with a one finger head dimishing quickly to a slight oiling effect on the surface. nice little ring that stays ever so present all the way down. I also had a good amount of sedements floating around in the bottom of the three that i drank .  S- roasty malts is the first thing that comes to mind, brown sugar or something sweet in the background maybe it was a dark fruit like plums or something, coco , as the beer warms i definatly smell alcohol, thats about all i get out of it after a little over half the glass.  T- Whoa !!! That was a bitter kick in the mouth, didnt waste any time pronouncing the hops were present, this bitterness is then played down in the middle by a nice warm alcohol fuzzy to the sweetness and roasted malts taste. Very complex, as the taste comes on in chapters, bitterness goes away to sraight warm feeling everytime i take a sip even the last. Of course the roasted taste is still there but the alcohol is a lil to defining for my taste. This brew needs to be aged, I will set some aside and come back to it, but my first impression was ill stick with the Oak Aged Yeti (Great Divide).  M- Slick, heavy, and warm, slightly carbonated  D- Two was enough almost to much definately a night cap beer or for those cold bone chilling nights.  Overall- The Storm King is just that, Comes on like a raging storm then subsides to a shaken calm, nice brew very complex but ill seek out others before i try this one again, like i said maybe the cellering will help balance this out a little too.

The smell is full of roasted malt, chocolate, and hops. Hop content is assertive without being dominant. There's plenty of other flavor to strike a balance with. The taste starts off malty, turns to chocolate, then finishes with hops and more roasted malt. The mouthfeel is solid and pleasing without being too heavy.

Smell; floral hops stand out the initially, coffee, bittersweet chocolate and just a litlle bit of alcohol.  Taste; you get those hops right up front, but not as powerful as the smell would lead you to believe. There's some of the coffee, and chocolate sweetness in there, with just a hint of some dark fruits. Mouthfeel is medium to full, and much creamier that I was expecting.

345,1013,BitterBrian,4.77,"I love beer. Sometimes, I come home from work and try a mediocre beer and enjoy it even though it might not really impress me that much. Other times I will drink something that I am very accustomed to. I still enjoy it, but since I drink it so often, I might not appreciate it as much as I should. Times like this, I feel the need to profess my love again, sort of like a renewal of vows.  It poured a DARK brown, almost pitch black, but still had a brown hue. Natural wool colored head (Doesn't that sound delicious?). The head didn't stick around too long and there was only light lacing. The smell was faint, a hint of alcohol and chocolate. But then. . . The taste.  I love stouts. The more chocolaty and coffeeish, the better. I have never had one like this though. It's like a nice mellow coffee, licorice tasting imperial stout (with a bit of alcohol taste) was minding it's own business, walking down the street when, WHAM, it was hit by an 18 wheeled hop truck. When the smoke and carnage clears, the storm king stout is in its place.  The finish was a mixture of the stout and hoppy tastes. A testament to the balance of this beer. I think a case is in order.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Terp96,4.42,"My first stout of the season and I was not disappointed.  This pours a deep, dark amber/brown. No light gets through the pint glass. The head doesn't stay around that long.  The aroma is filled with chocolate, coffee, raisins, and a touch of alcohol.  Taste follows through with the same chocolate, coffee, raisin and alcohol notes but this time the hops come through in the finish.  Mouthfeel is hearty but not as thick and syrupy as I expected.  This is a very drinkable beer. The alcohol is there but masked with a host of complex flavors. This one is good all the way threw.

345,1013,veggiemafia,4.36,"Bottled on Sept. 27, 2005 a few hours east of here.  Dark black with almost no transparency, even when held to direct light. Creamy dark khaki colored head the color of the foam on espresso. Moderate sticky lace and a constant ring til the end of the beer. I think this beer made my apartment a little darker.  Smell is kind of alcoholic, which covers a few of the subtleties of this brew. Other than that, all bittersweet chocolate and really good espresso. Tiny hop presence here that only serves to make this smell very fresh and clear, not mucky at all.  Holy crap...coffee, espresso, smooth dark chocolate with a sweet finish. Definitely very smoky/roasty, alcoholic presence in the background, but by no means is this overwhelming nor does it detract from the flavor. Big big beer, but still very manageable, very complex, keeps me guessing. Almost a citrusy hops thing somewhere? Maybe?  Smooth, viscous, maybe a little bit on the thin side, but that's fine with me, still REAL sticky and thick.  Far and away the most drinkable double stout I've ever had. This would've gotten a 5, but if you've been following my reviews (and I seriously can't imagine why you'd follow my reviews, you weirdo) you'd know that I tend to take off .5 or so just for being high abv.

The nose was big on roasted malts, chocolate, alcohol, and bitterness. The flavor is of roasted malts, coffee, licorice, bitter chocolate, and sports a strong bitterness level. Alcohol is definitely noticeable, but it compliments the overall flavor.  Medium / heavy in body. The mouthfeel is smooth with a touch of crispness at the start.

I'm getting some black cherry, molasses, coffee, with a bit of alcohol.  Taste: Much smoother than I expected for a brew this strength. Thick and creamy with an initial sweetness of dark malts and a bit of cherry. The hops quickly dominate the taste, with plenty of citrus and floral notes. Carbonation is a little light. Although a hefty brew at 9%ABV, the alcohol is barely perceptible, just a bit of warmth. Finishes nicely, with a bitter, malty finish and aftertaste more like a normal stout.

345,1013,nlmartin,4.14,Served from a bottle to a pub glass. Bottled on January 14th 2005.  Appearance: Pours nearly a perfect blackness. There is a ruby colored opaqueness when held to the light. The head never really rose more than a fingers width but had a nice carmel coloration. No lacing in evidence.  Smell: This is definately the low point for this beer. Smells like citrus and alcohol grassy. Nothing unpleasant just not better than average.  Taste: A bold tasting stout lots of coffee on the front with a great chocolatey back taste. The hops play nicely with the roasted malty goodness.  Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: I really enjoyed this beer. This is what I am talking about when I want a stout.

Modest but noticable lace pattern.  Very vinous roasted malt base sits atop reedy alcoholic vapors compounded with prickly cascade hop cones. Grassy. Chocolate lingers on the palate with a clanging, discordant roastiness.  Initially chalky and grainy - somewhat clunky - receding into a bracing wall of bitterness with a chocolate and alcohol afterglow.  Weird, out of place carbonation bites into my tongue and palate. Makes everything seem strangely thin; none of the chewy viscocity I crave in RIS.  Drinkable? Yes. Outstanding? No. I don't think age will do much to this as it is so thin already.

Bitter hops up front, Floral boquet that is squashed by charred wood. Slippery mouthfeel that finishes quite dry. This has a great mix of all the essentials without a big winner. Some coffee charectaristics, marginal choclolate, burnt qualities, Rich body, but in balance and well put together. Alcohol is well hidden and really an afterthought. Mild warming on the finish.

Aromas of coffee, roasted malt, nuts, grain and mature hops fill the nose with anticipation. Taste is complex and rich; flavors of coffee, caramel, malt and some hop bitterness is nearly overwhelming, yet still totally enjoyable.

345,1013,PatYoda,4.58,"Bottled Dec. 7, 2004.  Appearance is very dark brown with a nice grayish tan head that actually leaves a ring around the glass that doesn't go away. Smell is a tad fainter than I would prefer but very nice nonetheless. Roasted malt, chocolate, coffee and citrus are all in there. Taste starts out like the usual American Double Stout with a boatload of roasted malt and some dark fruit, but that's just the beginning. As it makes its way through your palate, you pick up a very strong coffee flavor, that citrus that was in the smell with a little pine needles as well, and some chocolate. There is a definite vinous characteristic throughout. And then the finish...DOES it finish? I really wouldn't know because I still have a little left in my glass and even once when I was forced to take 3 agonizing minutes between sips, I could still taste it. The finish is full of strong bittering hops backed up by a nice dark chocolate and coffee flavor. There's even some vanilla in there. And the roasted malt lingers as well. Simply incredible. At first I had the taste at a 4.5, but as it warms this beer really opens up with flavors you didn't find before. I think I even tasted some cinnamon.  It's like Victory just threw whatever they had around in there and it somehow merged into a beautifully balanced stout. Like the brewmaster said, ""Here's some roasted malt...hey Bill you using these cascade hops? No, ok I'm throwing em in, how about this chocolate? Or these spices? What about this hamburger...? Oh you're still finishing that. Ok never mind."" Anyway, I'm glad they didn't throw the hamburger in, though if you've ever had the hamburger at Victory it is DAMN good. To this day I have not had a better burger. But anyway, I think the alcohol might be getting to me a bit in this one as I'm almost finished. 9.1%? I can't taste it at all. Mouthfeel is excellent, perfect for this creation. Nice and thick and creamy - exactly what you would want without being too heavy. Drinkability is off the charts. I may have 3 or 4 more!

345,1013,DarkerTheBetter,3.01,"Updated Review: 2-06-2010  This one pours a clear dark black with a creamy tan film of head that leaves some nice lacing along my glass.  Smells of sour grains, sweet chocolate syrup and a funky sour cough syrup rounded off with a disconnected piney hop.  Tastes of sweet root beer and distant chocolate that fades into a sour cough syrup. This then awkwardly falls into a piney hop that lingers long in the finish with red grapefruit peels. The balance here is pretty bad.  Feels clean and airy with a soft swarm of carbonation that seems to avoid my tongue.  A mere shadow of what this was five years ago. This is pretty gross, in my opinion. I regret buying a six-pack.  Original Review: 10-04-2005  This beer pours nearly black with a slight obsidian glow. After a hard pour, the head looked like tiny copper ball bearings that faded to white and collapse all together in a few minutes.  On the nose, there's a subtle cocktail of coffee, hops, pineapple and plumbs. There's also a tiny bit of alcohol that I had to really sniff out.  The flavor is absolutely amazing. Big sticky black malt with only a slight roasted flavor that transitions into fruity hops. To further explain the flavor of this beer, it seems that the sweetness of the malt blends into the sweetness of the hops. But wait, there's more. In addition, the dryness of the roasted malt blends into the dryness of the hops. So, you get a blend of caramel and chocolate malt sweetness, that is seamlessly blended with citrus and port-like hops. On the dry end, the coffee notes blend easily into the tart plumb skin-like dryness of the hops. I find this to be truly amazing and unique in beer. My favorite aspect of this beer is that in between the transition of malt to hops all sorts of fruity port, plumb, prune, red grape flavors make themselves known only for an instant. It really boggles the mind to drink. I'm disappointed to only give this category a 5.  This is a very viscous beer with minimal carbonation. What little carbonation helps with the dynamics of the drinking, perhaps delaying the onset of the fruitiness related to the hops. There's a good thick body that just slides down your throat.  I'm the kind of guy who, on the hottest day of the summer, will still reach for a stout first. That's just me. I'll have to say, this beer is hands down my favorite. Not too much coffee, and some delicate sweetness with some mystical guest appearance of subtle flavors that appear out of nowhere. That, and the price is right on for a stronger beer. Here's to Victory!  As a side note, the beer is far hoppier when it is cask conditioned at the Victory Brewery. There are big pacific north west hops flavors that dominate the roasted malts. This is an absolute must for the hop-head who wants to take a trip to the dark side. However, the hoppiness of the cask detracts from the subtle blend that I rate so highly.

345,1013,klewis,4.89,"A: A respectable tan head slowly arose after a hard pour and then subsided to a frothy ring. The brew, a dark brown, is actually lighter than most stouts of this stature. The goblet is covered with lace by the end of the drink.  S: It hit my nose as soon as I popped the cap. So much going on here... roasted malt, beautiful hops aroma, coffee, chocolate, and honey(?). Delicious.  T: Tons of wonderful hops flavor is balanced surprisingly well with the malt and flavors of dark chocolate and espresso. A blast of hops bittnerness in the finish completes the experience. The alcohol is very well hidden in this one.  M: Nice and heavy with a very smooth carbonation that is perfect for the style.  D: This is a stellar beer. This one doesn't have the motor oil-like mouth feel of the Stone RIS, but its taste is smoother and for $8.99 a sixer, you just can't beat the value. Not even with a stick.

The pour was a dark midnight color with limited color deviations on the side or if you tip the glass. A respectable head light tan head and decent lace remains with the beer. Impressive even the lace has a tan tinge to it.  The smell has big hints of strong malt and coffee flavors. Some other aromas confine of figs and a little bit of brown sugar. Not really sweet but more of an off sweet smell. A good roasted presence but not really any strong phenol smells. The taste if very rich. A big malt sweetness hello matched nicely with a caramel toffee taste to it. Hints of roasted and stronger rich chocolate tones. A very complex malt flavor that mixes well with a pretty ample hop flavor. More then typical, I would say.  Impressive about this beer is a great body flavor and the big ABV is easily masked. A smooth and highly drinkable taste.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,MDekker,4.41,"A touch of transparency in the pour, as a dark dark brown, but impossible to see through in the glass. Nice bit of fine-bubbled light brown head, forming nice lacing on the way down. Has that dark roasted stout smell. I can pick out a coffee aroma at the least. Tastes great, with a dark roasted flavor and smoky, malty aftertaste. Nice and creamy and smooth.  After trying a bunch of stouts a few days ago, this measures up very well, although I still favor Founders Breakfast Stout over this one (but only by a little).",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Beaver13,3.96,"12 oz bottle, bottled on 11/21/03. Pours an opaque black with a medium sized creamy brown head that retains well and laces the glass some.  The aroma is milky chocolate, coffee, anise, dark fruits and some mintiness and sharp alcohol.  The flavor is sweet and very milky chocolate, a little more mintiness and anise, and a bitter and roasty coffee finish. There's a touch of alcohol, but it is well hidden. The mouthfeel is medium to full with soft creamy carbonation.  Overall, a very fine beer. I was expecting a bit more though. I would like to try this fresh sometime to compare.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,malty,4.26,"Bottled on Jan. 14 '05  Black color with a blossoming khaki head. Mucho lacing.  Scents on plums and molasses, reminiscent of a barley wine. Not much else comes through.  Whoa! Theres a lot going on here. Obvious dark roasted malts with perforated bitter edges compliments on the generous use of whole hops. Dark baker's chocolate rears its chalky head somewhere in the middle. Malted milk sweetly finishes things off.  Mouthfeel is extraordinary. Super silky soft and somewhat oily. The full body keeps moving along thanks to it's fine and well suited level of carbonation. Finish is veeerrryyy long, full and a tad bitter.  Drinkability is dangerously high for such an arsenal beer. Definitely an ale to be content with on a snowy Michigan weekend, even though its currently 82F and I'm smiling ear-to-ear. A winner from an exceptional brewery.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Dukeofearl,4.16,"Victory brews finally hit California in early-mid-2005, and the Inland Empire a couple months later. And it was only a few cases of Storm King, HopDevil, Golden Monkey, and V-12 at my local store. Once those cases went away, Victory was gone. But I was lucky enough to get a sixer of HopDevil and Storm King, and this is the review of my last bottle of the stout.  Beautiful rich deep mahogany brown-black that actually looks thick; has a brown root-beer head that drops to about 1/8th inch where it hangs for a while.  Aroma is rich, malty, slight chocolate sweetness, bitter espresso (when the beer is a little warmer), quite nice. Aroma is good, but I expected it to be stronger and more ""in my face"". It's actually subtle, and kind of weak. Not a bad aroma, don't get me wrong, I just wish it was more like some beers that I can smell from a foot (or more) away.  Flavor makes up for it though, with rich malts, espresso, cream, slight honey (very slight), perhaps some vanilla, and a nice bitter end. End also has a distinct alcohol presence.  Mouthfeel is very nice and comforting, not as creamy as some, but more so than a simple stout. The alcohol ending detracts from the overall mouthfeel, and reduces its drinkability.  In summary, this is an excellent stout (OK, double stout).",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Knuckles,4.47,"Storm King... You make my heart sing... you make everything... groovy... oh Storm King...  Storm King... I think I love you... BUT I WANT TO KNOW FOR SURE... so I guess I'd better drink that second bottle...  Appearance: Actually, a bit lighter for the style than is typical. I'm accustomed to imperial/double stouts possessing a heart of neutronium, a black so dense it absorbs all light and matter that comes its way. This beer, on the other hand, doesn't do that. Ruby red highlights around the outermost edges, almost makes it look like a standard stout. The color belies the badass ABV.  Smell: Chocolate and port, my homies, and hops my ass. I know they are there, but this 9.1% beer is the one with the wallet in the bag that says ""Bad Muthafucka"". Malts rule the day here, kids. Smell it and love it, or get the fuck out. Me, I'm staying.  Taste: Dark chocolate, port and just a mere hint of bitterness around the edges of my tongue. It's almost like the beer is daring you to come out and play.  Mouthfeel: I have a six year old son that loves to let ice cream melt, mix the crap out of it and then drink it. This beer feels like that in my mouth.  Drinkability: Well, if you're a big fat guy like myself, you can drink the crap out of it. And I would if I had more than two. However, I don't, so I'll have to jealously guard my next one.

345,1013,TongoRad,4.45,"Disclaimer: this is a seasonal brew but it has been well cellared and in good condition for this review. This can be seen as a snapshot of how this beer will age.  It pours a rich opaque ebony color with ruby hints at the edges and a lasting dense tan one-finger head. There is some real depth here.  The aroma is powerful- it can barely be contained. It hits my nose the second the crown has been popped. Citrus hops are first on the scene, but they can barely conceal a mountain of roasted malt and caramel. Some spices also come to the surface (vanilla, anise, sassafras) as well as some berries and figs, and even a touch of butter. It seems at first to have a straightforward aroma but it becomes more complex the more it is examined.  The palate is full yet dry, though the flavor falters in comparisson to the nose. It is mostly the coffee-like malts and caramel but little else. Bitterness is pleasingly high. The finish is long and it is there that a touch of the herbal/spiciness shows its head. Unfortunately the fruit has not carried through.  I really do like this beer and anticipate a re-review when fresh.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,hero27,3.69,"Bottled Jan. 14, 2005.  Pours jet black, with a frothy, beige head...leaves thin sheets of lacing. Absolutely impermeable darkness. Faint smell of roasted malts..nothing too overpowering. Tastes are more subtle than I expected them to be, however, it is fairly complex. Finishes quite bitter, even for an Imperial Stout...more of a roasted coffee taste mixed with a nice hop finish. The alcohol could be a little better hidden. At 9.1%, I could definitely taste it. With the Old Horizontal (11% ABV) I had the other night, I could barely taste any alcohol at all. To be honest, I'm a bit surprised this beer lands in the Top 20, but then again, I'm not a ""stout expert"" by any means. I'm going to set my 2nd bottle down a year or so and compare the two.

345,1013,UncleFlip,4.58,"When I set down this bottle on my computer desk, my rather large stuffed penguin fell down and tumbled to the floor.. I hope that's a sign of this beer's power. :)  OK, here we go. Nice satisfying sound as the cap comes off, and a mist rises out and blown away by the ceiling fan. Just a hint of the aroma reaches my nose before I even pour.  In the stream down to the glass, it looks cola colour.... There's a nice strong tan head (three fingers or more- and I have big fingers) that slowly disintegrates, leaving thick wet lace behind. Below it is a VERY dark, VERY clean liquid, mahogany at the edges, and also mahogany when held to the light- no opaque haze, just a nice clean, clear stout.  The aroma is lighter than I expected, a little sweet and hoppy, with malty qualities that also carry some alcohol aroma. There's a strong yeasty kick to the smell.  Wow... I can't quite put my finger on the flavours right at the first sip! There's a woodiness at first, along with a dark maltiness- but the malt is not cloying or overpowering. The woodiness continues, with some spice building into the finish. There's a bit of hoppiness up front, but it dulls a bit and combines with the spiciness, then hangs in the back center of your tongue.  The mouthfeel is a little fizzier than I really like in a stout, but that doesn't distract at all. There's a low, tight carbonation that couples nicely with the medium-thick body of the beer. The liquid is nice and round and unobtrusive. Very pleasant.  Not the most drinkable stout I've had, but I still give it high marks. I could down a few of these in one night with no complaints.

The topping of this baby is two fingers of dense tan foam with lots of staying power.  The nose is comprised mostly of alcohol esters and deep roasted malt with hints of chocolate and coffee.  Entry is highlighted by the immediate discovery of a wonderous mouthfeel; velvety smooth, light...yet filling. The taste is a seven course meal consisting of roasted malts, expresso coffee,sweet toffee, melted chocolate, smooth yeast, and alcohol esters. Suddenly the entire dinner stops with the entrance of whole flower hops until they release their grip on the palate to allow a beautiful malted milk chocolate fade.

345,1013,ChappyCubsFan,4.23,"I've tasted this several times in bottles. More recently, I had a bottle of it at the Which Brew in Easton, PA. But I never did a review on it until now. I guess that's because I finally visited Victory Brewing in Downingtown, PA, and I had a sample of it on draft. I believe the bartender even mixed a sample of the Storm King with the Golden Monkey tripel to create a special concoction for us. That was good too.  But the Storm King is definitely one of the most potent and complex stouts I've ever had. It pours very dark...black may be more appropriate. The malt taste leads to many assumptions about the recipe. It has a chocolate, coffee taste, but there are many other things at work. I also sensed that there was a hint of cherry or raspberry. But it is a potent stout, and I know I could not finish more than a pint of this in one sitting. Very tasty.

No alcohol can be noticed, considering this is 9.1 Pure heaven!.  (Cask 8 months old  7/26/04) Opaque black with a small tan head and beautiful lacing. Roasted and floral hop aroma.

Strong, roasted malt smell, licorace and alcohol. Mouth was as a stout should be, Chewy, yet thinner but I did find the alcohol was more present. This was an imperial feeling, therefore, outstanding.  Taste? Mostly black licorace. My first impression and it lingered with me, then the complex flavors come out and show what they can do. Still, the licorace is a bit overpowering.  Well, I could say this was a great imperial, but it seemed to miss a few notes to make it truly palatable to me especially compared to recent imperials.

Dark fruits and chocolate notes in the taste. Man, talk about creamy! Surprising hop profile is assertive and bitter roasted malts coat the mouth in the finish, paired with a peppery alcohol.

Smell is roasted chocolate malt, my favorite. Hint of cherries too, and more hops than expected. Taste of chocalate malt but the big surprise is the level of hop bitterness. Just a great tasting stout. The high ABV is well hidden. Smooth and creamy mouthfeal. This just goes down sooo smooth. This is going to be a regular on my beer list.

345,1013,neonbrown82,4.62,"This is the most drinkable heavy stout I've ever had. Thanks to GCBrewingCo for the opportunity to try this.  The liquid is like a black hole, sucking all nearby light into the deep dark void in the glass. Unfortunately it poured with very little head, but instead produced a thin chocolate ring around the maw of the black hole.  The smell is of roasted chocolate malt along with coffee and ethanol. It smells quite rich and sweet, unlike many Imperial Stouts I've had that are a bit thin and soy saucy. The hoppiness really shines through in both the smell and the taste as the beer warms up a bit.  The taste is amazing. It starts off with a sweet vanilla and chocolate maltiness fading into a bitter roastiness at the finish. Has a bit of a fruity hop quality hidden in it as well. The late-finish has a to-die-for vanilla chocolate coffee taste complimented well by the american hops.  The mouthfeel is rich and velvety, but I was hoping for something a bit more viscous. I can't complain, however. These guys have obviously done well with this brew.  Even though this beer sits at a hefty 9.1% ABV, it is very smooth and easy drinking. If I had another, I'd drink it. Probably not recommended for an extended session, though. Cheers to GCBrewingCo as well as Victory Brewing Co.

Thankfully, last time a friend of mine went back east he picked me up a bottle of Storm King stout, my favorite of their beers. This 12 oz bottle was from Oct. 20th 04, and tasted great.  Poured black with a small brownish head, really good looking. Mouth feel is a little thick, and generally wonderful. This is as smooth a beer, as youll find. The taste was exactly as I remembered it. No extreme flavors--the chocolate and coffee hints balance with the fruity character to create an almost perfect blend that doesnt push too far in one direction. Not too bitter, not too sweet, malty, but wonderfully balanced with a good amount of hop character.  Its high in alcohol, but very drinkable.

Not that I poured this into a beer bong or anything (t'was served in a tulip) but this went down so easily it was gone before I knew it. There's alcohol in this? Oh there it is... in my knees.

Pours a deep black, almost crude oil like, but there are definitely some ruby and light brown notes. Head is somewhat small, but that's to be expected, and dense. Lacing and retention are pretty good. Smell is interesting as it is not what I would normally expect from a Double Stout. The relatively normal aromas of coffee, chocolate, roasted malts, and hops are all there. But this is one of the fruitiest stouts I've ever smelled. VERY wine-like. Grapes and rasins are present, as is something else, which I can't remember and can't seem to distinguish right now. Taste is malty sweet up front, with a definte coffee and chocolate taste. Bitter hops follow. And this all seems to be finished off by a very dry, wine-like finish. Mouthfeel is darn near perfect. Not too slick or oily. Very well balanced as far as malt/hops are concerned.

Pours almost but not quite opaque, deep dark mahogany with a light brown foamy head that dropped fairly quickly to islands and a ring. Surprising. No real lacing observed. Also surprising.  Aroma is of dark brown sugar, molasses, prunes, cherries, (kind of like a zinfandel) some citrus-y hops, and alcohol. Couldn't wait to sip this one.  The first flavor is of big malt sweetness, followed by a good dose of bittering hops. Then you get a strong dark sweet coffee, burnt toffee apples, dark rum soaked cherries, and alcohol. Maybe some citrus-y hops in the back. Outstanding!  Mouthfeel is a luxurious sweetness, medium carbonation, tongue coating resins, and lip smacking malts. An extended sweet, hot aftertaste completes this great beer.  This beer is way too drinkable for its 9.1% ABV.

345,1013,CortexBomb,4.03,"Pour is jet black with a small, off-tan head on top, what I would expect from a quality Imperial. The beer noticeably clings to the side of the glass upon shifting. Smell is strongly of roasted malts with a nip of coffee and some alcohol...I want to take a sip.  A hop citrus twang meets me up front, which starts the back taste buds tingling. This slowly recedes and allows the roasted malts to fully enter the picture, as well as some coffee, both adding some dimension. The hops continue to stick around and offer little shots of flavour here and there, but never take over completely. Alcohol, though subdued, is also definitely present in the flavour. A light burn hits the back of the throat on the swallow, as well as a final shot from the hops, which leave a wistful, lingering hop bitter for a few moments after the swallow. Quite good.  The mouth is thick and viscuous, just like I like my stouts, while the drinkability continues the all-around good nature of this stout.  My overall impression: This is a really well done stout. It does most of the little things right via the smell and body, and then also manages to offer a memorable taste which offers the hop presence that has become popular lately, without having them absolutely overwhelm the beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

The finish is very worm and bitter. alchohol is definitely present in the taste and double in the finish. Hits the stomach like a brick. You know you're drinking something with significant ABV.

345,1013,blitz134,4.1,"Black as night with a thin tan head which reduced to a thin layer. Left little to no lacing. Smell is a bit one dimensional and to me seems to be dominated by hops mainly grapefruit and other citrus aromas. Some sweet malts as well. A good smell, but I would like to see some toasted notes as well...this is a stout ya know...  A very interesting taste, not one I have come across in a stout before. The complexity on this one is really up there with every tastebud sending signals for different flavors they are picking up. A lighter toasted malt going on with some subtle hints of black patent in the far reaches and in the finish, especially as it warms. As the nose would suggest there is a good dose of citrus hops...and I mean a good dose. I pick up a touch of burbon and dark fruits, most notably a bit of cherry or plum possibly. Pretty hop-laden overall. I'm a hop head no doubt, but I like my stouts to be stout-like and not overly hopped. This is a good unique flavor and I'll give it credit for that. I'd like to set one of these aside for a bit to let the hops tone down and let the less prevalent flavors come through a bit.  Mouthfeel is decent, but thin for a double stout. I would expect a molasses feel from a double stout. A good bit of carbonation. Coats the mouth well. Drinkability is this beer's strong point, even though it has a high ABV. All signs of alcohol are covered.  A decent beer overall but doesn't live up to its current rating for me, a bit too hoppy for the style and a bit to thin as well...this would have received a high review from me if I were expecting it to come across hoppy.

From rich expresso notes to the smooth chocolate tinge, this is one kickbutt stout.  Mouthfeel: Next to absolute perfection. Medium to Heavy body that goes down perfectly smooth. The smoothest and easiest quaffing imperial stout I've ever tasted.  Drinkability: Warming alcohol is quite well hidden. The 9+% alch can sneak up on you....be careful - I won't have more than two of these in one sittng (anymore) as they do start to seem heavier after one..and as experience has shown, even more so, after two.

345,1013,weeare138,4.5,"Bottled Dec 23 '04... Wow. I've forgotten how much I really love this one, even out of a bottle. Appears black with a touch of red when drawn to the light. A nice 1 finger tan head that lasts. Thick, juicy lacing. Smell is of caramel, sweet chocolate, creamy vanilla, and light coffee. Taste is smooth, creamy with sugary caramel, chocolate, vanilla laced with coffee and just a light bite of hops. Mouthfeel is great. Super smooth medium bodied brew. All the sweetness and bitterness blends to make a smooth, creamy liquid tiramisu that deserves special attention. Drinkability...Forget about it! I'm still trying to figure out where the 9.1 abv is at. This is one of the great Imperial/Double Stouts out there. It really does remind me of a liquid tiramisu. Excellent.

345,1013,Gaisgeil,4.54,"Bottled December 7th, 2004.  Pours a dark black with just the smallest amount of dark brown around the edges. Poured with a light tan head that managed to keep a crown all throughout. Nose is amazing, stout like, yes, but also some very uncharacteristic things going on here as well. Some floral and citrus notes going on, a bit hoppy. Taste is very good indeed, some nice roast and coffee elements along with a nice tinge of dark chocolate. This one just a little bitter, balancing the nice round malts very well. I'm very impressed, I hope we can get this in Michigan very soon. A lot of complexity and delicate flavors going on here, more than just about any stout I've had, as stouts can be a little brutish with the roast, as is this one, but somehow some other elements manage to put their mark on the whole affair.  Very good indeed.  Slàinte!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,RealityDeviant,4.43,"Presentation: 12 oz. brown bottle obtained from Carytown Wine and Beer. It reads bottled Dec. 23 04.  Appearance: This beer has a dark brown, almost black coloration and can be seen through only when directly under a light. Faint hints of red might be seen if observed closely. It pours with a healthy, tan head that it retains for a relatively short period of time.  Smell: It certainly does not seem to have an active aroma. I detect roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, and a distinct note of orange peel. Overall, the aroma comes off as earthy and rather alcoholic.  Taste: Whereas there didnt seem to be as much going on in the aroma, the taste assaults the mouth with coffee and chocolate malt. The hops presence is worth noting, because it balances out the bit of sweetness in the citrus flavor. An chicory-like bitterness lingers on the tongue long after the first sip. I would definitely have to cleanse my palate before sampling anything further. Although I can tell its high in alcohol content, its pleasantly hidden.  Mouthfeel: It is not overly carbonated and is thick and creamy in body, allowing it to go down smooth like any stout should. The alcohol, while not immediately noticeable on the palate becomes apparent after being swallowed, as it results in a nice, warming sensation.  Drinkability: Wow, this one heck of an Imperial Stout. If you like the category of stouts in the slightest, I recommend trying this at least once. Its too alcoholic to drink a great deal of and seems to be too overpowering to have with other beers, though. Im doubt this would be my preferred summer beer, but I see this as a great beer for a cold, winter night.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,ddarden,3.93,"Black. No light getting through this one. Nice tan head with not much lacing as it recedes. Smell is of dark malts and chocolate. Smell is not that impressive.  The taste is very nice off the bat. Definite roasted malt, chocolate, and coffee flavor. Alcohol is very well hidden....could be dangerous. The finish has a very nice hop bitterness with a lingering malt and chocolate aftertaste that lasts. This beer is not as creamy or chewy as I would expect in this style. Kind of disappointing.  The mouth feel is kind of thin for a double stout, but this makes the drinkability excellent. As I said before, the alcohol is very well hidden, which could lead to your goat being guided directly into a ditch.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

No light passes through this beer, not even at the edge of the glass. A large sumptuous tan head rests on top. Excellent retention, and leaves a lot of lacing on the glass.  Smell: Very subtle aroma. Light chocolate sweet malt, with the acrid roast hiding in the background. Finishes with coffee, chocolate, vanilla and loads of alcohol.  Taste: Thick, rich, lightly sweet, malty, and roasty. This beer has some awesome balance. The body is full and chewy, the malt isn't cloyingly sweet, loads of hop flavor in the middle with gradually increasing smooth bitterness, the roasted malts aren't harsh, acrid, or drying, finishes with expresso, chocolate, and a hint of rum. Thick and full mouthfeel after the sip. At 9.1% ABV, I couldn't even tell.  Notes: Excellent balance, alcohol well hidden, very smooth, and dangerously drinkable. The light carbonation in this beer gives a kind of creaminess to it. This stout is awesome. Thanks to my sister for getting this for my birthday.

Smell: The smell mix of chocolate notes and floral hops, with a strong coffee background. The flavors are not as pronounced as I remember.  Taste and Mouthfeel: God I still love the way this beer taste. The strong, rich coffee and chocolate notes play in your mouth forever, with a nice hop bitterness that rounds it off perfectly. The complexity is through the roof, but not unbearably so. The mouthfeel is rich and creamy.  Drinkability and Overall: Not as perfect as it was at a year, but still phenomenal.

Roasty, toasty malts mixed with light smoke, coffee (black, no cream or sugar), and unsweetened chocolate. Hop bitterness, & a slight hint of alcohol which is almost TOO well hidden for a beer packing a 9.1% abv punch. The mixture of coffee, chocolate, & hops clings to your tongue well after the last sip is gone.

345,1013,SupaCelt,3.65,"Appearance: Close enought to black. Small tan head with no retention. Jagged peninsulas of lacing.  Smell: Roasted malts mostly. Coffee aspects. I guess I had better call it ""espresso."" Hard water ambiance emerges as well.  Taste: This beer chose to display bitterness as the dominant effect. Heavy bitterness is great in the right places ( the right styles ), but I like my imperial stouts to be thick and rich with sweets, and chocolate, and the ""espresso"" flavours. I welcome hoppy finishes, but this stout is just bitter all the way through. The sweetness that usually adds thickness to the mouthfeel is not present here. This tastes like a bitter, watered down, coffee to me. Perhaps it is the lack of other strong characters that make this one feel overhoppped to me. At any rate, I find it thin and lacking in complexity. The only thing imperial about this is the alcohol content.  Mouthfeel: Thin. Watery. I am astonished at how emaciated the body is with this one. Cachetic.  Drinkability: Give me a real imperial. This is a diet imperial. I apologize, but not sincerely. This thing is unimpressive. I just don't see the appeal. Serial drinking flavour with a higher buzz factor.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Nice head retention - a good looking beer  Smoke and hop bitterness are the main players in the taste. More smoke than I expected from the smell. The high alcohol content is really only evident by the warmth you get after a few seconds. Nice nice warmth, but without a lot of alcoholishness.

345,1013,Cadyfatcat,4.54,"Pours a deep jet black. Medium caramel colored head, with decent retention. Smell is simply wonderful. A penetrating chocolate malt, with hints of caramel coats the back of the nostrils. While some floral hops dance among those little hairs inside your nose. The flavor is excellent. An abrupt punch of roasted yet tarty malts, phased out by the hops. The hops are perfectly executed; they have just the right bitterness to phase out the initial malts. The hops pick up right at the same level that the malts drop off, and allow the flavor to gently subside. The palate slowly dries out as the flavor seems to burrow down into your tongue. Just as I thought it was over, a sweet but dry molasses and walnut aftertaste crept back up on me, just amazing. Damn this beer packs a punch, I am really feeling it by the end of the glass. As I search for further means of description I end up with the ""sophisticated beast.""

Scent is slightly metalic along with dark fruits, sweet dark malts, spice and molasses.  Taste is espresso, dark fruits, sweet malts, a bit of hop spice/tanginess and slight alcohol warming finish. The coffee/espresso lingers as well with the fruityness along side.   Mouthfeel cannot be improved upon IMO. It is silky smooth even creamy. With the perfect amount of carbination.

The beer is as black as I've seen them. Brown head began about half an inch and has dissipated quite a bit and it now clings to the side of my glass. Smells of licorice, tobacco, chocolate, and smoke. Taste is more of the same, but with a more noticeable dark chocolate presence. Age has not withered this strong stout. Mouthfeel is solid as a beer this size should be.

Smell: BIG roasted malt aroma! Cherry, alcohol, milk chocolate, slight coffee, and a hint of banana. Very complex and wonderful.  Taste: Big and bold malt presence with dark, fruity, coffee undertones. As it warms up a bit, it reveals even more complexity. Resin, molasses, vanilla and is that licorice? The finish is long, bitter and wonderful.  Mouthfeel: Everything about this beer is big and heavy, including the mouthfeel, but its creamy texture and soft carbonation make it much more drinkable than one would expect from such a robust beer.

Very strong smell of deep grapefruit hops and intense coffee malts. Not too complex, but still nice and wonderfully intense, like a mixture between an Imperial stout and a barley wine.  Strong coffe upfront that makes way into a hops and alcohol zip. This is the first time outside of a Belgian that I've tasted strong alcohol and not hated it. Nice. Just intense enough.

345,1013,mmmbeer,4.48,"12 oz., bottled on Dec. 16, 2004. Pours into the snifter thick and black with a 1 finger light brown head that never dissipates completely and leaves little bits of lacing on the glass. The aroma is hops (citric/some pine) with some chocolate and roasted malts. On the palate, the hops are spicy/citric/piney and the malts contribute notes of raisins/figs, coffee, bittersweet chocolate, and an overall toasted character. There is perhaps a hint of anise as well, along with a warming sensation and lots of IBUs. Goes very well with milk chocolate. Very smooth in the mouth - like velvet. It is a bit strong both in flavor and ABV to drink too many, but that's not to say I won't do it. Much better on a cold winter night than this unusually warm April afternoon, but who cares?  11 months later... (March 6, '06) 12 oz. bottle from the same six pack, now 16 months since it was bottled. This is the first beer I've cellared for an extended period after taking notes on the fresh version, so it'll be interesting to see what the age has done to it. It still has a surprising amount of carbonation and even keeps a head on it for the first half. The hops have smoothed out in both the aroma and taste and the dark malts are taking center stage. Much fruitier now... near the end it almost smelled like I had Chambord in the snifter. Lots of juicy blackberries and currants with a big backbone of roasted malts and coffee/espresso with the same citric/pine hop flavors, but with less bitterness. Definitely more drinkable, and I might say it deserves a 5 for aroma, even though I didn't indicate as such in the score. Even better than when fresh. I paired this one with a slice of rich chocolate cake and it complemented it perfectly. I have one more bottle left, let's see if I can make it last another year.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

There was a very thin tan head, but it was devoured by the darkness. Aroma was huge. Coffee, roasted malt, burnt toast, very fragrance, I could smell it from quite a distance away, which is great. Taste, wow, so much going on. Roasted malt, dark chocolate, coffee, long finish. The chocolate got quite strong as it warmed, but it was never overpowering. Mouthfeel was velvetty smooth and the high ABV was so well hidden, it warmed your throat, but you couldn't taste a scrap of it.

345,1013,SCW,3.58,"Hmmm... had a bottle of this after it was given to me as a gift from my distributor.  My sample was not opaque... it had brown highlights in the corners of the glass. The aroma was neutral... a faint whisper of alcohol and just a little bit of roasted barley. No hops evident.  The flavor was mellow and roasted, a warming after-effect from the alcohol. The mouthfeel was subdued, I'd say it was medium to full-bodied.  This beer was very drinkable for its size.

345,1013,asabreed,5,"Wow. I can't say that enough. Had my first Imperial pint at the Capital Ale House in Richmond, and I was thrilled to see that they still had it in stock. Being a huge Storm King fan from bottle or draft already, I was more than excited to try this.  Appearance: What you'd expect. Opaque and beautifully black, with a mocha-colored tan had that slowly dissipates as you sip on it.  Smell: The smells seem to much different from the ""regular"" Storm King and have gained amazing texture and complexity. Yeast. Bread. Dark, unsweetened chocolate. Dark berries. Slight coffee / mocha. Complex malts. Faint hops. Dark cherries, but it doesn't smell syrupy at all. Amazing.  Taste: All the flavors come together amazingly well. Berries up front, rather than the espresso like flavors of the bottle or regular tap. Some chocolate and malts, lingering and slight hop finish. Aftertaste of dark cherries and a faint hop bitterness. Also amazing.  Mouthfeel: Medium body, but not chewy. Light and perfectly balanced carbonation.  Drinkability: I paired this with raspberry white chocolate cheesecake, and it only enhanced the flavors of both. I don't see how a cask-conditioned beer can get better than this, as Storm King by itself is amazing enough.

The road to Victory is difficult and treacherous, but even moreso is the trip home. Don't expect to be driving well after you drink Storm King. It won't much matter, because after you've had this beer on tap, you'll be happy to live and die at Victory. So what do we look for in an Imperial Stout? Roasty, malty, bitter, coffee, with hop balance. The King nails them all. The tap version is admittedly better than the bottle version, for all of the obvious reasons.

This beer is a little over carbonated, I believe. But not so much that it detracts much form the greatness of the beer. It is robust. It is a full bodied beer that goes down surprisingly smoothly. The alcohol is well hidden, so this beer might sneak up on you. Because of that, it might not bee the best beer to drink all night. Unless you can dring high alcohol beers. Then drink away.

345,1013,GolgiIPAratus,4.32,"Sampled: 2.24.05  12 oz bottle - bottled Oct 21 '03  A medium pour of approximately 4 ounces into a brandy snifter causes a short burst of vivid tan foam that fades quickly. This leaves a clear view into an umber abyss, opaque at the center, circled by a translucent reddish brown hue, and finally traced by a perfect ring of delicate foam along the outer edge. It's an eclipse. Pointed celestial webbing rests on the surface. I almost don't want to drink it. Give this drink a swirl yourself and just watch.  The nose is a glowing campfire, the smoky remnants of roasted marshmallows and chocolate..hold on..it's like s'mores made with tootsie rolls! Hints of caramel confused me into wondering if Victory brewed this, or if it was Willy Wonka. Alas, no Golden Ticket under the label.  Tasting this beer is a downright pleasure. Roasted malts, sweet and bitter at the same time up front. Rolled around the palate, it's chocolatey, creamy and light all at once. The carbonation tickles the tip of my tongue. Lightly burnt smoke flavors cling after the swallowed sip, getting you excited for the next one. The alcohol barely makes an appearance. Leading to...  The drinkability of this beer is scary. In fact it's pretty dangerous. Cold, it can go down like a Guinness to the unknowing. Letting it warm can slow you down, as it tends to sit a little heavier. Me, I usually end up savoring every sip like it'll be the last until I can pop a new one and start all over again.  Overall, as the rating suggests, I highly recommend this beer as well.

345,1013,swamiswamu,4.63,"Who spiked my stout with IPA? This one's a stout with velvet gloves on roids lashing out on unsuspecting strangers. I'll never believe for a minute that this is over 9%. Like a cover of ""Smooth Criminal"" sung by Johnny Lydon, the hops bite covering up a more sinister intoxication. I'm usually a weary of wild experimentation of styles, but the massive hop infusion creates something new and wonderful. Eight cheers.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,froggyfrog,4.13,"I had two large glasses of this stout from the tap last night at Tobias in Lancaster. The color was very impressive - a solid black with a moderate head. The head disappeared pretty quickly but did leave a lacey film on the glass as I drank it down. The beer had a good flavor, mostly of what I would expect from a stout, and I felt that it was very easy to drink. (Didn't know it was 9.1% at the time, whoops...) However there was a strong metallic taste lingering over the flavor of the beer. I didn't notice any other reviews mentioning this so I have to assume that the metal I was tasting was a result of the keg or the tap system or something. Overall I was happy with this beer and would like to drink it again, though I plan to get it in a bottle next time.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,karst,4.4,"The first beer to follow my awesome Founders Breakfast Stout. Very dark in stout glass allows light to pass thru as deep ruby color. Head dense rich tan. Wonderful wine and toasted coffee, bitter chocolate aroma. Taste well blended (not as harsh as FBS which I liked better). Hops may be pushing the style but its ALL GOOD! Mouthfeel is full finishes clean with a nice long ""goodbye"" from those wonderful hops.  Going for more.

345,1013,Naerhu,4.35,"A big thanks to Jimbo for sending me this beauty!!!  My anticipation of how extraordinary this beer this would be was not met. Though, you can see from the high scores I gave it, that I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Appearance: Opaque black body with a small brown head. Aroma: Hoppy, char and sweetness. Taste: Resiny hops with great slightly sweet berries and malt. Finish is an eruption of bitterness and dark chocolate. Mouthfeel: smooth body, high alcohol noticeable. Drinkability:",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,ggroller,4.5,"Thick, sticky, black liquid with a thick, mocha latte- like light brown, meringue head. This one looks absolutely beautiful in the glass.  It smells like a stout and tastes like one of the best. Roasty, malty at first with a balance of hops in the back. Finishes dirty and grainy. Boy, do I need another sip.  Another fine Victory creation.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,IrishMike,4.45,"Bottled 2004 and purchased at the local liquor store for $9.99 a six pack.  Appearance- well, it is just as you'd expect from a double-stout; black and will not allow any light to pass through it's ink color. Small, dark tan head that dissipates into a ring around the glass with a pool hanging around in the middle.  Smell- complexity is the key of this stouts game. Giving off both sweet cherries and darker tones, like roasted nuts and dark chocolate all at once is indeed perplexing. The hops and alcohol are there if you look hard enough, making this an odd balance where the beer seems both sweet and sour at the same time. Don't think that i consider this a bad thing though, and quite the opposite; i'm impressed as to how many characteristics culminate in the nose at once.  taste- Just as complex as it's smell would lead one to believe. Starts off with the roasted tones, mild caramel, dark fruits, and plenty of dark chocolate, then subsides into a solid hop bite. But the brew isn't satisfied with just that. After the hop a sweet cherry flavor pulls itself through, almost out of nowhere it seems, and then AGAIN goes back to the hop bite after the sweetness has subsided. Very elegant in the way it goes about its business; it doesn't try to pound one single flavor into you but rather gives you many to work with. A minor touch of alcohol finishes off the show.  Mouthfeel- creamy, but not as heavy as i'd like from a double stout. Still, this isn't what anyone would call ""light"" by any stretch of the imagination. Heavy, just not D.S. heavy.  drinkability- I would consider this extremely drinkable when you take it's style into account. I can, and have, had three in the span of a little over an hour (as my friends have dubbed it, ""The Storm King Challenge""), but your average person probably wouldn't consider this a session beer. Still, even when i'm only drinking one to relax, i take it down fairly quick.   The beer that started it all for me, back when my manager at the liquor store hooked me up with a 2000 vintage 6 pack for 9 bucks (talk about a deal!). And for quite some time after i turned 21, i considered this the best beer i had ever had. Well, that may not be the case anymore, but this is still a brilliant brew in my mind. What had started out as something new and exciting for me has changed over into an old reliable, which to me means that it never really loses it's charm. This, coupled with Old Horizontal, makes up the better part of what i purchase during the winter season. I guess Victory just knows what i like. Another winner from the great brewery.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,gimmehead,4,"A vigorous pour resulted in a black body and a tan two finger head with gorgeous lacing. Nose was unexpected; very hoppy and not much of the chocolate/ roast coffee that I expected. Floral and citrus hops also dominated the taste, alcoholic finish. Smooth and velvety, great on the tongue.  I don't quite know what to make of this one. It tastes good, but is overhopped for the style in my opinion. Not bad on it's own, but if you're craving a rich, sweet stout save this one for another time.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,scottbrew4u,4.35,I purchased this beer from the brewery in late May 2004 and let it sit in my cellar until late Jan. 2005. The beer poured out in my pint glass with a nice light brown one finger head. Deep malty aroma up front with a slight hop bouquet in there as well. The beer was jet black and very appealing to my eyes. At first taste I was amazed at how balanced it was. Then I thought maybe that would change later on. As I kept drinking it was increasing in malt complexity with some favorable dark fruity esters gliding on my taste buds. It truely got better as it went down and I am off to buy some more for my cellar and I recommend others to buy some to age as well.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,whartontallboy,4.68,"12-16-04 Bottling, poured into a tulip. Pour is a dark black with a big tan head that slowly dissipates leaving a lot of lace. Looks yummy. Aroma has some roasty notes in it, along with some citrus and some hops. I can pick up the alcohol, which doesn't surprise me at this ABV. Taste, though, is amazing. Sweeter than I expected up front with some raisiny and orange-rind notes, but it gradually gives way to a very nicely nuanced roasted-malt flavor with a roasted/coffee finish. Hoppier than most huge stouts, but I think this balances the big roasty flavors extremely well. Medium/creamy mouthfeel with just the right amount of carbonation dancing on your tongue. Much lighter than the designation and the ABV would make you expect, giving it a nice drinkability and smoothness.  Overall: Wow. That's what all the fuss is about, I guess. By far the best stout I've tasted in the last couple of years; I feel it takes all of the best qualities of stouts with none of the common drawbacks. If you want a big, balanced stout, look no further.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Held up to a lamp ruby colored highlights are apparent.  Citrus floral hop aroma (Cascades?)with toasted malt notes.  Taste is at first citrus hop definitely something from the west coast there, with a sooth interlude of dark chocolate, with espresso coffee notes and a tangy grapefruit punch that slowly fades to nothing. This is a hop monster in my book.  Despite the high gravity this is a light bodied beer that is surprisingly crisp and refreshing.  I will drink this one again.  Pair this with a rich sweet dessert.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,orbitalr0x,4.5,"I finally got around to picking this one up and can't wait to try it. Very cool label..bottled Dec. 7, 04. Deep black pour with a few hints of brown near the bubbly tan head. Patches of lacing on the glass as the head falls a bit. Nice. Whoa! Big, lush grapefruity, lemon, citric hops collide head on with robust roasty malts and hints of chocolate. A tantalizing mix and a very hoppy nose for an impy stout.  Big roasted, burnt malt flavor upfront with hints of cocoa and bitter coffee. Waves of citrusy hops roll over my tongue...more subdued than the nose suggested and quite enjoyable. A nice bitterness and just a wonderfully flavorful full bodied brew. Alcohol is not even detectable here.  Nice thick, creamy mouthfeel with tight bubbly carbonation...so nice and so damn easy to drink. While this is no session brew...I could easily have 2 or 3 of these on a cold night. Another fine brew from Victory...I look forward to many more!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,OldFrothingSlosh,4.34,"From the beer engine at Capital Ale House.  I was damn excited to see this listed as one of the beers available for CAH's weekly Steal The Glass night last night. Inital impression was less than favorable. The beer arrived with *no* head at all. Looked like flat Coke. No lacing while drinking it. I'd had 2 pints of casked Hop Devil prior to the SKS and those were wonderful in appearance. I was vexed. Otherwise, the color of the beer was near total darkness, with light struggling to make its way through. Aromas are dominated by the choclate, with sweet caramel and roasted-toasted malt supporting. Flavor is again wonderful, but not quite as enjoyable as from the bottle, which, to me, is surprising. Perhaps I like the overwhelming mixture of flavors unattenuated by the conditioning. There's a whole lot of chocolate, coffee, and caramel here, don't get me wrong, and it tasted great...just not as good as I remember. Much smoother in this version. Short-lived bitter chocolate on the palate. Drinkable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Erix,4.65,"Pint glass filled from bottle. Appearance: Looks Delicious. Extremely dark, with a khaki colored head. Smell: Hops come through in a big way. Smells malty too, and less burnt that I expected. Maybe a little too cold? Less luscious than the Black Chocolate Stout I just had last night. I've had to raise the rating for the smell as the beer warmed. Now dark chocolate and fruit are apparent, like a cherry cordial. Taste: Starts with dark malt and its burnt bitterness, met by the hops and their herbal bitterness, and counters this bitterness with the sweet malt and alcohol, and refuses to go away even after there is no beer left to drink. I get such a mass of flavor out of each sip that I have trouble picking out more than a few threads... coffee, chocolate, toast, sweet something or other.. Mouthfeel: Drying, warm (almost hot if held in the mouth too long) thick, but not as thick as what I have become accustomed to with the style. Very coating, helping to keep the taste going long after each sip. Drinkability: As often happens when I start on a beer that is strong in both flavor and alcohol, my opinion of the drinkability has increased as I emptied my glass. The astringency makes this a rather easy beer to drink, prompting a self perpetuating need for more libation. Good stuff.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Fish113d,4.48,"2004 version: Pouring into a goblet, it pours a deep, dark brown/black color w/ no light at all getting through the glass, along with a 1cm tan clingy head, creating a nice edge layer. However, it does dissipate rather quickly. Smell is of dark rich baker's chocolate and some raisins (raisons), a bit of caramel malts w/ tones of slight hops throughout. As it warmed to room temp, the chocolate came through more, and I even thought of fresh brewed coffee from this one. Taking a sip, it solidified my ideas about the coffee; sweet coffee and caramels coming through with the dark roast malts. Again, as it warmed to room temp, the chocolate came through more and more along with teh raisins (chocolate covered raisins!) Great mouthfeel...smooth, smooth, smooth!!! Carbonation up front is enjoyable and lighter than expected, the alcohol burn on the swallow is a great addition to this one in that it was NOT overpowering at all as I had expected before. Very chewy, creamy, rich Imperial Stout! Wow! Victory, can you do it any better?",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,BeerFink,4.53,"Appearance - Deep black with a nice light brown head. Some nice rings of lacing are apparent as the stout is consumed.  Smell - Syrupy smell of raisins and caramel. It just smells thick.  Taste - Bold and chewy. This is one thick stout! Roasted yet sweet. Chocolate and caramel come through, with a touch of raisons and even some citrous. A hint of coffee is there as well. The alcohol flavor comes through, but it is not overpowering at all - a nice compliment.  Mouthfeel - Very low carbonation with a pronounced roasted malt aftertaste. Creamy and slightly bitter at the same time.  A very drinkable brew - it is very smooth and inviting, despite the high abv. Very good blend of malts giving a complex flavor that is addictive.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,connecticutpoet,4.47,"This was a VERY dark brown brew with a short head that left good lacing on the glass.  The aroma was complex... slightly sweet and fruity, with hints of caramel over a strong roasted malt backbone. Bittersweet chocolate notes abounded.  The taste followed the aroma... slightly sweet, with caramel notes and bitter chocolate, over a roasted malt core with hints of coffee. A nice bitter hop character also made its presence known, but did not overshadow the roasted malts.  The mouthfeel of this beer was full and chewy, rich and luxurious. Very good, and highly drinkable.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,carln26,4.57,"Deep, light absorbing black color with a thick tan head that settled to a light streaky lace. The aroma is dominated by the roasted malt. I dont often detect coffee/espresso aromas in anything except a coffee stout, but I do find it here, with just a hint of hops on the back. Wow! Surprising hop flavor up front. This really is a hoppy stout. Nice fruity accent to the beer. More roast malt with the coffee flavor I detected on the nose along with some chocolate. Good rich velvet mouth feel. No alcohol heat. This is a very drinkable stout",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,ncbrewerbun,4.32,This beer could put the pitch in pitch black. Poured an opaque totally black with a small tan head which dissipated very quickly.  Floral aroma of fresh hops!

345,1013,Quaffer,4.53,"Given to me by Bruiser81. Not available here in Kansas.  Appearance: Jet black, pure and simple. It looked slightly viscous as it poured into the glass. A brown head with hues of red (it almost looked bloody right after the pour) rose up to a good three fingers and stuck around for ages. It was dense and a little rocky as it settled, leaving a ton of lace behind in its wake. There was always some amount of foam lingering around on top of the ebony liquid.One fine looking beer.  Smell: Very nice aroma. Rich chocolate, bitter coffee, smokey, dark roasted malts, light cream, and sweet cherries were all detectable. No hops at all on the nose. Everything combined well and smelled great.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied and very smooth. It seemed to coat the tongue as the liquid slid across it.  Taste: Upfront were hints of sweet cocoa on the tip of the tongue. This gave way immediately to bitter chocolate and coffee. Very roasted and bitter flavors, overall. The hops kicked in very strongly in the middle and on the finish, sneaking in for the attack after they had slid in underneath the aroma radar. The finish was a continuation of bitter coffee and hops, with a tiny bit of cherry underneath. Some sweet malt and chocolate rise up in the aftertaste to take a little edge off the bitterness. No evidence of the 9.1% abv anywhere in the flavor.  A great stout that easily lives up to the hype. Goes down way too easily for a beer of this strength. Too bad I can't get it here.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,bashiba,4.32,"Thanks to santoslhalper for this great beer.  Poured a very dark brown with just a small line of dark coffee colored head.  Smells strongly of Chocolate and espresso with a little bit of toffee malted sweetness poking through as well.  Taste has hints of bitter chocolate, coffee, anise, and some dark fruit flavors. Initial Malt sweetness is balanced very well by a very strong hop finish, very nice!  Mouthfeel is suprisling light for this style, but still has a very pleasant creaminess.

Served from the engine directly in front of me, the glass is an opaque obsidian the likes of which is to be feared. A foamy tan head tops it off, and leaves incredible lacing behind as I work my way through this masterpiece. This is an exceptional beer out of the bottle, and it is something to be honored and cherished on cask. Nothing touches it, stout or otherwise.

345,1013,FormatKid,4.83,"When I first started perusing BA a year or so ago, this legendary beer was #1 by far and remained there for quite a bit of time if I remember correctly. Over this period of time Ive been able to sample and greatly appreciate some amazing Imperial Stouts. Now I tackle the legend I have anticipated trying for such a long time.  This beer was bottled 10/20/04 and is being sampled 01/07/05.  As soon as I pop the top my nose is greeted by deep, ripe berry esters. The beer looks viscous as I pour it into my goblet, seeming almost reluctant to leave its bottle. A large foamy head the color of creamed-coffee rises rapidly and seems to retain rather well for a beer of this girth leaving a lace-like sheet on its way down. The bodyblacker than the night time sky in bed-sty in july; blacker than the seed in the blackberry pie, blacker than the middle of my eye. This beer eclipses even direct lights feeble attempts to penetrate its depths. Upon further inspection the nose reveals a flambé dish made of plums, ripe cherries and fire-consumed rum; deeply charred malt, dark roast coffee and juicy ripe blackberries. The taste is a perfect reflection of the beautiful nose. Storm King introduces itself to my palate by squeezing a handful of ripe juicy blackberries across my tongue and then soaks it up with a blasting combination of hop bitterness and deep charred roastiness. The bitter and charred flavors are awesome and roll over some other complexities of flavor (ripe apples, plum skin, toffee) and coagulate into a resinous, coating pine-sap in the finish. Very small hints of rum like alcohol flavors in the finish, but I consider it very well masked for the large ABV contained in this beer. Warmth instantly rides down my throat and pools slowly in my belly from the first drink. The mouthfeel is robust; creamy and almost a little oily at timestill falls short of the thickest Imperial Stout Ive had to date but its no sucker in this category either. An amazing beer that is a great example of one of my favorite styles. You can really take your time with this one, making it a perfect beer for a night where youre only having one. Im so glad I have more of these!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,marcobrau,4.08,"Huge aroma of hops and dark malts. Black in color. Lots of hops for this style of beer, but I like that. The espresso flavor of roasted malt still comes through the spicy, citrusy hops. The malt and hops blend quite well, better than you'd think. A very bitter finish seems to be made up of both hops and malt flavors. This is a very intense, hoppy stout. The hops can actually deceive and get you thinking that you're not drinking a heavy beer. Very well-attenuated, which combined with the high hopping rate, actually makes this beer a little bit two-dimensional -- but still a very tasty stout.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

The nose is deep chocolate and dark figgy fruit with a really apparetn alcohol. The flavor is very chocolatey and roasty, finishing strong on coffee tones. There is also a creamieness in the flavor as well that make it so smooth. The feel is as smooth as a can be, almost velvety. There is a little bit of syrupy feel that keeps the beer on my tongue. Fantastic beer. For a beer above 9%, this one doesn't let me know anything about it except in the nose.

345,1013,wbickerton,4.16,"Draught. I picked up this keg at Vecenies Distributing Company in Millvale. It has a roasted aroma with some very faint undertones that I cannot describe. This stout is very dark and opaque with a very tight frothy head, which is brownish in color (tan to light brown). The head is somewhat lasting, but it dissipates faster than expected. The taste is complex yet balanced; it starts out slightly bitter, but the mild sweetness catches up, leaving you with a long bittersweet finish. I mostly notice a roasted flavor, but it does not seem like chocolate or coffee; maybe its molasses. If you sip the frothy head when you first pour it, it tastes pretty much the same as the beer itself, which is not true of other stouts that I have imbibed. It has an oily full-bodied feel on the palate with lively carbonation. Storm King warms your stomach and is not a stout that can be consumed quickly as you will eventually feel the effect of its high alcohol content; Victory Brewings website lists the beer at 9.1% ABV. If thats correct, Victory goes down on my list as another quality brewer that knows how to mask the smell and taste of alcohol.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

A very dark beer, allowing no light to pass through. Hardly no head forming and not a lot of lacing. Aroma contains coffee/espresso and a hit of hops. Not a very overpowering smell...I would expect more w/ the 9.1% ABV. The taste is awesome, with a hint of roasted malts blended well w/ the American hops. You cannot taste much alcohol presence here...this beer goes down very smooth. The texture is perfect...not too carbonated and lots of body. I can tell you that this beer goes right to the head after a couple and will warm you just right during the colder months....nice timing Victory.

345,1013,oggg,4.26,"Thanks to IrishRedRock for this 2004 gem.  This beer pours a dark dark black, with the faintest red tints at the edges. A small brown head forms but dissipates quickly (forgivable given high abv),. There is the aroma of alcohol, some chocolate, and a nice floral quality. The aroma is fairly mild though. This beer has a good deal of hop bitterness mixed in with a lesser amount of burnt grain bitterness. Lots of choco-coffee flavor. It is huge and rich and full. The hops add complexity -- a subtle fruitiness. Alcohol is subtle. I discovered the massive 9.1%abv with an inch left in the glass. For some reason, 8+% beers seem to snooker me harder and longer than if I drank two 4% beers.  I initially tried this big beer with a decent Punch handmade cigar. The Storm King wasn't quite keeping up with the smokiness. I pulled a light coffeecake out of the fridge, but the Storm King completely overwhelmed it. I had a bit of brie, and the combo seemed a bit better. I see this bitter brew going well with a sweet fruity chocolate dessert.

The underlying bittersweet chocolate maltiness blends nicely in a wonderful medly. This tastes almost like a big old black IIPA. Lots of flavor and bittering hops dominate and linger. Underneath is a smooth chocolate pudding like malt. I almost picture Hop Wallop underneath everything going on here.

345,1013,HardTarget,4.27,"Standard 12 oz brown bottle with bottled on date (Nov. 18, 03- almost exactly a year ago) and abv. (another monster at 9.1% abv) and a note that its bottle conditioned. Aroma: Nice blend of classic stout nose with a strong dose of hops, grapes and chocolate. Appearance: Ink black, opaque, and the thinnest of deep brown heads. Left small sheets of lace here and there. Flavor: Reminds me of Shakespeare Stout, but a bit more of a hop presence. The natural grape flavor has a spicy hop back, peppery like Saaz. Overall it has a rich balanced flavor with dark roasted malt and assertive hops blending nicely. Some burnt coffee bitter notes are checked with a sweet malt/cherry back and a mild alcohol warmth/taste in the finish. The alcohol, while noticeable, isnt hot or unpleasant. Mouthfeel: Heavy body, quite thick with a hearty chew. Slow fading flavor but no oils noted. Overall Impression: A very enjoyable brew! The aging seems to have treated it well. The flavors are well blended and no papery or oxidized flavors noted. Its too heavy for a session but a flavor I could see getting it on a regular basis (if it was local: this is another trade that Ive lost my contact person for). This is a good example of the American Double Stout, dark and hoppy. Does it belong in the Top 10 (as it currently is)? A great beer, but I think Ive tasted 10 better beers in the world.

In appearance its typical good stout, pitch black ,impenetrable by light, small tan head that dissapears fast.Good laceing. Nice burnt, chocolate, esspresso aromas, also a wiff of alcohol. This is nice enough..it has the complexitieds expected from a stout, the dark chocolate, rum,esspresso coffee, but I think the alcohol shows through too much and disrupts the flavour parade.But its not unpleasant. Again I think the palate starts of nice and smooth and the alcohol breaks it down somewhat to near watery.

I actually smell hops first, wonder if anyone else did... and then the roasted malts come into play. Taste is very solid. Nice fruity and malty kick up front with a bit of alcohol warmth and also a nice back-up of piney hops. This is definately the most well balanced stout I've had. Not over-powering at all, as many people sometimes say of stouts. Mouthfeel is definately a bit lighter than I expected. Definately a more medium body than full. Definatelty very drinkable for a stout, not too thick or chunky, and certainly not bland or boring. Don't know if I'd call it the king of stouts as the name implies, but it's definately in the royal family.

Pours an opaque dark dark brown color, minimial head, but some lacing. Smells of, well roasted malts, some carmelly sweetness in the smell as well.  Taste is pretty well layered... first of sweet malt mingled with alcohol fading into the bitterness from the roasted malts then finally a little hop bite at the very end.  I like this beer overall, however, I would like it to be a bit thicker and creamier for the style. I find it a tad thin for a double stout.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,djeffbee,4.8,WOW! The way I start every NFL Sunday. One 'Plow King' as we call it - @9+ABV it packs a punch! A very opaque pour with a subtle carmel head . Smell hints of toffee and coffee - a wonderful Imperial Stout. A true sipper so you can enjoy every drop. Would love to try a cask version! Not sure if there is one better - if one is available in the east - lemme know! Yum!,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,francisweizen,4.75,"On-Tap @ Victory.  Dark, opaque black with a nice head of dark espresso coloured foam. The aromas are of oily hops, Espresso, dark Belgian chocolate, brandy, vanilla, cabernet grapes, roasted malts, alcohol, and more. The taste follows suit. Dark roasted malts hit first, but the middle is roasty with some nice chocolate and coffee flavor notes as well. The finish is dry and oily with some leafy green hop flavors in the mix as well. The mouthfeel is a bit too carbonated for an imperial stout when this brew is served on tap, and as such the cask version of this brew is definately more 'easy-drinking'. Sure, there are definately better imperial stouts out there. But when it comes to price, freshness, and availability the ""king"" is still in my top five list. Long live the king.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,KroMagnon,4.13,"Dark, black liquid with a nice brown head that stays around. Opaque. The aroma is malty and hoppy and strangely clean - I don't detect much in the way of esters or alcohol-fruitiness. The flavor starts with a solid, chocolatey presence and then you get a huge malty profile, fading to a bitterness that lingers. Cream, creamy mouthfeel. This is a delicious well-made beer. The hop notes are a bit less than I expected but this is not a bad thing - the beer seems tilted toward maltiness and is balanced with the hop bitterness and the bittersweet chocolate notes. Delicious! WARNING! 30 minutes later...although the alcohol content isn't obvious from the beer.. this thing packs a wallop! Tremendous. It can really sneak up on you.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

345,1013,Beersignal,4.4,"I wish this beer were more readily available in Québec because it is, without a doubt, a top 10 beer for me.  Pours like liquid cocoa beans. A very seductive deep dark brown, almost black beer adorned with a dark beige head that should have stuck around longer or at least left evidence of its existence.  Beautifully complex aromas of roasted malts and hops mingle with notes of field berries and caramel in the middle. Faint hints of licorice root and smoke round out the olfactory experience and add to the complexity.  First sip reveals a rich and firmly textured beer of elegant character. Up front, a bitterness comprised of hop freshness makes way for a chocolatey, malty and roasted middle that is followed by a faint sweetness bordered by hints of licorice. An encore presence by the hops closes out the taste in a long and seamless finish.  I will seek this brew out whenever I go to the US. Faultless balance, beautiful complexity both in the nose and on the tongue make this beer, in my opinion, a perfect desert beer or soothing winter warmer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,rousee,3.85,"I waited to try 2 of these before reviewing. Good thing because the first try wasn't as good as the 2nd. How often does this happen ? Not very.  Pours very dark black; no light gets through when held to the light. It leaves a small cap and disappears to whispy foam shortly thereafter. Lace is excellent (tight, well-organized,pretty) and so is head retention. I guess this is why this beer scores so high. I am going to have to revise my scores because the 2nd try on this one is So much better than the 1st.  Smell--how bout some nicely roasted coffee and malt--this would be excellent with steak, eggs, and potatoes. Has licorice, caramel and more malt going on. Slight berry essence too-this has to be the minor presence of hops.  Taste is pure malty-coffee-chocolate and a hint of hoppy-bitterness. I dont't taste a middle-but there is a front and back and the front is exactly as described earlier but it finishes dry and slightly sticky. Pine-sap like.

345,1013,Skidz,4.38,"Thanks to ppoitras for the trade!  Bottled on Jan 20 2004  Pours out a nice dark amber brown and sits deep, dark mahogony in the glass, hardly any light passing through at all. A large, dark tan head looms above the darkness from below.  Smells nicely roasted with plenty of hops billowing from within. Floral and piney hop aromas are dominant, while dark roasted grains seem to mix in as well. A lightly burnt aroma blends with the sweet smell of caramel and dark bitter chocolate. Alcohol noted underneath the hops.  Tastes sweet at first throught, some resinous dark fruity flavors and darkened caramel, but soon turns into a rush of bourbon-like flavors. The alcohol lifts up the malty sweetness and brings it together with the roasted grains, creating a very unique flavor, similar to bourbon, but very mildly. Hops take their place later on, once the sweetness has mellowed out a bit. Pine, grapefuit-like citrus and an oily citrus rind flavor make the majority of the hop flavors. Leaves a pleasant layer of hop oils over the back of your toungue. Finish is bitter, but a very smooth bitterness if there ever was one.  Big and rich in the mouth, carbonation is adequate. Body does not dissapoint, nor does it astound me.  Yeah, I could see drinking this on a more regular basis, as it is a wonderful double stout. Having it as an occasional treat, however, suits this beer much better.  EDIT: :::Bottled 10/23/03::: thanks to ppoitras for this gem!  Pours out dark brown and sits jet black in the glass with litte dark mahogony streaks. Bigh creamy tan head with great lacings.  Smells of roasted malts, coffee, caramel, chocolates and light tinges of alcohol. Good hoppy background and a mild fruity esters.  Tastes bitter up front, highly roasted. Light chocolatey taste. Some caramely sweetness with light traces of citric notes from the hops. Bitterness continues through to the finish, leaving a clean and oily medium bitterness. Alcohol is noted but is well mixed witht the malty sweetness and hoppy background.  Silky, creamy and super rich in the mouth with a full body and easy carbonation. Like moisturizing your mouth with lotion.  Tasty, feels awesome going in and has everything going for it. Definately better off that the 2004, though with some aging, it could be just as good.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,CAMRAhardliner,4.15,"I Had this beer on Cask at the GBBF and I remember it being delicious, but I didnt take notes. I found it in a bottle tonight at Smokeless Joes, the best beer bar in Toronto (besides Cafe Volo that is) and since its fresh in my mind I think this review will do it more justice.  Poured into a tulip glass. The color is almost pure black with ruby glints at the top and bottom of the glass. The head is light tan with modest retention. It leaves plenty of tan colored lace. The aroma is of roasted barley, hops, caramel, raisins and alcohol. The taste is very strong and rich, with massive amounts of roasted barley and coffee up front, as well as a strong hop bitterness. In the middle it lingers into rummy raisiny alcohol notes with some balancing hoppyness. The finish is less bitter than I expected, with sweet malts producing a balance. The mouthfeel is thick and somewhat oily. This beer is highly drinkable, though its ABV is evident, its overpowered by so many other flavors. The Alcohol becomes just another complimentary element.

This beer is so dark it does not allow light to pass through even when held up to a bright source. The head lasts and lasts as well, making it a very nice drink.  The aroma is roasty with soy sauce and chocolate in it. And the taste is out of this world. Very dark roasty malt taste with cinnamon, almond, chocolate, and a touch of sour cherry.

It had to be saved! What the hell was I thinking. I should have drank it then. The hops aren't gone, but they don't catch me like they did the first time around. This beer was still great though. Just not as great as it would have been had I drank it when it was fresh. The dates and rasins are strong like before. Alcohol is masked well. But it just isn't right out the hops.

345,1013,bultrey,4.36,"This pours an opaque, deep, dark brown, just a touch on the lighter side of black. I get fine, dark Belgian chocolate in the nose, a bittersweet symphony. There is also a distinct medicinal aroma. And there's something else around the edges -- what is that? Dark, dark fruit, almost like blueberry or raspberry pancake syrup. First sip -- ooohhhh, this is good. I was very much expecting that medicinal aroma to overpower as it does in so many imperial stouts, but instead, it makes the briefest of apperances before quickly yielding to a dry coffee roastiness, and then trasnforming back again to that bittersweet chocolate intermingling with raisins. This is very well-balanced for a style of brew that all too often swerves out of control. Alcohol is not that noticeable. Mouthfeel is smooth as silk, if not a tad undercarbonated for my taste. But that would be a hard feat to pull off with a brew of this body. Drinkability -- do I want another -- yes, just not right after this one. I most certainly will, however, in a brandy snifter, sitting in front of a fire, when the first frost comes.

Hop aroma was a little sharp (grassy/citrus) and provided a nice balance for the malts. Decadent malty flavour, with elements of dark chocolate, licorice, caramel sweetness, all balanced by a strong hop bitterness and floral hop flavour. The finish is bittersweet maltiness which lingers at the back of the palate. Very full body, thick and viscous, medium carbonation. Smooth texture with some alcohol flavour and warming present. As the beer warmed, some wonderful dried fruit flavours emerged, almost fig- or prune-like. Absolutely amazing balance for such a powerful beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

The body is full and round. A beautiful bitter aftertaste, very good. The alcohol is very well hidden, in the taste as in the smell. But after a while, it warms... And you can feel it.

Huge chocolate and roasty coffe/espresso nose balanced by piney and floral hops. Toasty malts but not too sweet. It always pours w a big milk chocolate head. Taste is sweet chocolate, raisens, and coffee, countered by pine and citrus from the hops. Hoppier and less sweet than some Imperial Stouts. Medium bodied with a soft palate.

I guess I just didn't pour hard enough.  Smelled of chocolate, espresso, slight alcohol. Roasty.  This is hands down one of the best tasting beers I've had the pleasure of drinking. Initially, there's a chocolate sweetness that swirls around in your mouth. Then a sharp bitterness swooshes by, and it tastes like a sweet espresso. The hop bitterness is intense. Also, there was a slight ginger flavour in the after taste. There's just so much going on but different flavours peak at different times.  Mouthfeel is so damn smooth and creamy. You don't really feel the alcohol, until maybe after you finish the bottle.  I could drink this all night. Probably the best beer, not just imperial stouts, that I've had ever.

Smells hoppy, with plenty of roasted malt, light smoke and a faint of sweetness, sort of prune and/or anise. The hoppiness and malt shine through at first in the taste, and a huge bitter dark chocolate finish. This Beer looks like used motor oil and coats the mouth just like it. Awesome body, really thick, like melted Valrhona. That 9% ABV is nowhere to be found at first, and only appears in the aroma near the end of the pint.

345,1013,oxmasterscream,4.85,"This beer is unbelievable. Period. As others have mentioned, the price just seals the deal.  Appearance: Poured like a really dark espresso, with just a small tan head, which eventually became a tiny ring around the glass. If I angled the glass correctly, I could see a faint ruby brown glow at the bottom of the glass. It was beautiful.  Smell: A nice combination of burnt, sweet and spicy, with an emphasis on sweet especially as it warmed... hops, burnt malts, dark chocolate, raisins. I couldn't wait to taste it.  Taste: Sweet and spicy with a very mild and enjoyable, bitter and drying aftertaste. Tastes of raisins, prunes, molasses, and burnt sugar. As it warmed, it got sweeter and more tart. It left a nice tang on the back and sides of my tongue. Major Cascade grapefruitiness in the finish later in the glass. The alcohol, as with other big beers, began revealing itself about halfway through the glass.  Mouthfeel: Nirvana. It's full-bodied, silky, smooth, creamy and luscious. Feels like a cafe latte with bubbles.  Drinkability: For an imperial stout, to date, it's my most drinkable. I've had others that seem to get tougher to handle as you get closer to the end of the glass (e.g. Rogue Imperial Stout). Storm King doesn't seem to concentrate all of its energy so much on all things burnt; instead it seems to cater to the sweet tooth. It's like drinking sophisticated candy. My favorite to date.  &lt;note: Just had a fresh bottle (dated 10/20/04), roughly one week old and it's much hoppier than I remember. My original review was of a bottle aged for at least 6-9 months. The hoppiness really mellows out with some aging. I think it's the way to go with this beer to get the most out of it.

The smell of floral hops is very unexpected, a hint of black licorice is there. The alcohol can be noticed through out the flavor time line, but it blended very well, like a light barlywine. The alcohol is balanced with the slightly bitter hops. The king is incredibly smooth for a hopy and a 9.1 ABV beer. A light coffee flavor is detectible in the after taste.

345,1013,EPseja,4.4,"This one poured with the color of the darkest chocolate, finally settling with an espresso-like thin head. For such a dark (and powerful) beer, this one has a very clean, hoppy smell with faint tinges of licorice, acacia (like in Sen Sen), prune and raisin.  The taste is complex, containing elements of dark coffee, dried dark fruits (as mentioned above), and (get this...) Stilton Cheese. I have no idea what it is that gives this beer that last characteristic, but as a fan of the cheese, it's an interestingly welcome note! The alcohol is also prevalent in the taste (but not overpowering), and helps to keep the mouthfeel light. The finish is smooth and easy, with a pleasant dark mocha-cocoa bitterness, and lingers for a long, long time.  Overall, an amazing stout from a company that's really playing attention to the beers they bring to the market.

345,1013,diablo14,4.02,"ah the storm king stout. for so long rated not just the finest stout in the good ol US of A, but the finest stout full stop. thanks to that legend of beer advocacy, the one and only malto, i have been able to taste this brew and sample its qualities for the first time. and while i wouldnt say i was disappointed with this stout, i will certainly say that it didnt quite live up to the wraps put on it.  dark, viscous appearance with charging bubble action and a limpid light brown head that didnt hold on for long. rich chocolate malt nose, hints of coffee, toffee and a stinging blast of zesty hops to finish the deal. the taste was rich, sweet, malty with bold coffee and chocolate tones, with a suprising element of stone (cherries, peaches, plums) tropical (banana, passionfruit) and citrus fruits (orange, grapefruit) in there. astonishing probably a better word. actually seemed a lot like a roasted pale ale to me in a lot of ways. everything was quite delicious and well balanced to this point, until the overuse of hops came to the forefront very early on in the peice. i love my hops as much as anyone, but this brew (and others i tried on the night) were downgraded simply because there seemed to be this obsession with getting as much hops into the beer as is humanly possible. they arent balanced with the flavor, and overwhelm the whole thing in the end. the hops are also far too dry, to the point of raspy. victory just didnt need to go this far.  alas, i suspected it would be this way. funny thing with the storm king is that if they did tone down the hops, it wouldnt be a top ten beer any more. having said that, i for one think it would be a much better beer. but im only one man. its still a four star beer tho no doubt.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,ngandhi,3.95,"Bottled November 4, 2003; tasted July 23, 2004  Fruity, unintegrated hops dominate this beer. They fail to complement any showing of significant roast -- as Cascades function so successfully in Rogue Shakespeare Stout, for example -- because there hardly is a discernable roast in this beer. What is there is cut by a deficient medium body and sharp, thinning carbonation. The finish is far too dry.  Though there is nothing wrong with this beer, it is based on a style dedicated to hedonism; and, in a world filled with many mighty gods, Storm King Stout is mortal.  Licorice, coffee.  [This final rating is comprehensive and considers the past two tastings of the November 4 bottling.]  Relax, relax. ng ---- Bottled November 4, 2003; tasted March 23, 2004  I couldn't resist trying this brew again. The hoppiness has died down on the nose and this is now discernable as a stout. In the past three months, SKS has picked up a deep roast that gives this brew some real stout character, but overall it has grown dull. The flavors are deep and classic with burnt malt and balanced bittering. Though the carbonation is still too sharp and tongue-numbing, it highlights a nice aftertaste of licorice, coffee, creamy oak, and yeast. The alcohol has calmed down, but this bottling of Storm King is still too volatile and physically abrasive to the tongue. A great stout, hopefully it will develop richer characteristics as time goes on and become more identifiable as an imperial. Imperial stouts are the gutsiest of all beers; Storm King desperately needs to grow a pair. I think it will.  Second Rating: 4.05  Relax, relax. ng ---- Bottled November 4, 2003; tasted December 6, 2003. Many thanks to Drew and his persistence at The Corkscrew in Urbana, IL for this very special opportunity.  The nose is an opus. Green and spicy with hops, with an revolver of dark chocolate/fudge, alcohol, and some kind of earthy funkiness. Can beer have terroir?  This beer drinks very young, and I'm not altogether confident in its potential to age. Up front is flavorful hopping mixed with (but not at all balanced by) a hop-based plummy, dark fruit and currant character. This quickly yields to fumey alcohol, and a fruity bitter finish with a touch of espresso. The bittering is handled well. Like a young port, however, this brew is all over the place, but without reason. For a 9abv brew, Victory's done a miserable job in controlling the alcohol. I think I taste a little woody/medicinal/alcoholic note; whatever the hop is, it wasn't properly utilized and serves only to call attention to the alcohol.  Though viscous, the body is cut by sharp carbonation that, though perfect for a pale ale, is completely against style. At times it bites the tongue.  This beer needs age to calm down the hops and maybe supress some of the alcohol. My guess is that, when it does settle down, the malts won't be there to back it up and the carbonation will always be a problem. Victory Storm King Stout is unprepared to take a leap beyond the basic parameters of an American imperial stout.  First rating: 4.1  Relax, relax. ng",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

The taste of this stout is delicious. Beautiful blend of hops and malt. Robust dark chocolate flavors burst through with complimentary sweetness. This imperial stout (9.1% ABV) is so smooth and drinkable. I can't believe how fast I drank this beer. Stouts of this power usually take a little bit of time to consume, but this was very enjoyable.

Thick and juicy, like a homemade coffee drink. Charcoal, chocolate and the roasted malts come rushing in, just to get a rocket punch from some hops that tame them so nicely.  Chewy greatness.

Light film on head, with no retention and verging on ebony in color; not nearly as pitch as others in this style. Oak scents with pine sap undertones, and an alcohol shortness. At taste were all the aforementioned attributes as found in the bouquet, but also a slight smokiness or burnt umber, although not as deep as others within the style. Clean finish for an imperial as a result of the finely tuned recipe. Much more drinkable than the DFH World Wide Stout offerings.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,mattcrill,4.41,"This is a fantastic Imperial Stout! Pours syrupy black with a nice two-finger head that retains well. Beautiful lacings down the glass. Smells of roasted malts and espresso predominates. Beautiful balance of espresso, dark chocolate, dried fruit, and a splash of alcohol make this a top notch stout. The predominance of hops is amazing. You can really enjoy the hop bitterness of this beer without it invading on the style of this wonderful stout. The hope presence is truly remarkable but in no way interferes with the integrity of this beer. Feels great on the palate...not too overpowering even with the 9.1% ABV. Really easy drinking. This is a great stout. One to be sipped and enjoyed.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Billolick,4.25,"On tap at the Lazy Boy in WP, NY. Poured black and studly. Dark tan head, excellent retention. Roasted malt and heaps of hops in the nose. Heavy body, engine oil comes to mind. Tons of roasted malt and burnt notes. Rich flavors, chewy mouthfeel. Coffee, chocolate, coffee. The flavors keep on coming. This is wonderful stuff, nice to enjoy on tap. Seek and enjoy this classy sipper",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,necoadam,4.9,"On-tap at Eli Cannon's  Oh boy, I know how this beer is in the bottle, but on-tap? Couldn't wait. Served in a pint glass. Color was pitch black with a nice amount of carbonation. Smell was a little hoppy, some ripen fruit, chocolate, and some coffee in there. Taste was out of this world. So smooth and creamy it was amazing. Some roasted flavors hit the palate along with some hops and then the bitter chocolate hits along with some coffee and dark fruit. But they all blended in so well it was amazing. After having some of this I don't know if I could go back to the bottle verison. This was just stunning on-tap.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,NEhophead,4.33,"A mellow, burnt brown/tan head giving way to some very intricate lacing that sticks and holds to the glass' sides. The imperial's color is black as night (really can't describe it much more). Very noticeable carbonation.  Burnt hazelnut and chocolate aromas. A malty sweetness balanced nicely with coffee tones. A faint milky smell as well, that is not too fitting for the style.  Chocolate espresso, burnt almonds/hazlenuts with a nice chewy maltiness. Very flavorful; no subtleties here! A very nice bitterness (to combat the sweetness) that rounds out the sip. Also a nice added roasted nut-like character.  A rather smooth and balanced imperial with a lot of carbonation. At 9.1% abv this is virtually like drinking a meal. More like a five course meal given the variety of flavors all of which pack a solid punch.  Very drinkable whose abv is very hard to detect. With that said, knowing the abv probably would keep me from having too many in one sitting. The only knock that I have on this beer has to do with the amount of carbonation. Personally, I love imprial stouts that have a very syrupy mouthfeel and this one's not in that style.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

345,1013,HopDevil,4.63,"It was a dark and stormy night!  This, the tongue-in-cheek beginning of many a Peanuts Snoopy novel, now seems completely apropos of my experience with the Imperial Stout from the court of Victory called Storm King.  A thundercloud of foam the color of dark coffee stain sits brooding over the inky black liquid I've just poured from bottle to glass. The beer below the thunderhead is an absolutely opaque black velvet. Even held up to the lamp the only discernable highlight is a sliver of garnet tracing the conjunction where beer meets glass. Some carbonation is visible rising through the column of obsidian brew, just barely enough to counteract a cloying sensation later on.  I'm totally unprepared for the aggressive surge of fresh hop fragrance that assails my nostrils followed by a pleasing wave of roasted malt aroma. The effect of this is impressively suggestive of broiled grapefruit covered in caramelized brown sugar recently pulled from the oven.  As the foam recedes leaving a swag of lace I raise my glass and sip the sable libation. Immediately I'm embroiled in a tempest of complex, luscious flavors of strong, rich dark espresso with bitter chocolate shavings, assertive grapefruit hoppiness, malted chocolate milkshake and burnt toast with black currant jelly that conceals the high abv. The mouthfeel, if there is a fault to this beer, is almost syrupy. It is huge, satisfying, and oily and goes down slick leaving a stickiness on my lips and a splendid, showy, bitter coffee aftertaste that is surprisingly smooth, demanding and utterly captivating. It lingers on the palate for what seems an eternity.  This is a storm I'll be happy to weather again and again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,TagoMago,4.88,"Presentation: 12 oz. bottle poured into pint glass.  Appearance: This beer pours as black as storm clouds at night (hence the name). It's completely opaque - if you were to shine a flood light into it, it would not pass through. This beer pours with a beautiful light brown head and has superb retention, leaving a beautiful foam lace on the glass. The body of the beer is very thick, almost syrupy.  Aroma: An intense floral hop and chocolatey malt assualt on the olfactory. There is also an aroma of currant and/or juniper berries.  Taste & Mouthfeel: This beer is incredibly smooth, it's almost like velvet going down. The body of the beer is very thick and creamy. The flavor of the beer is that of roasted malt - coffee, chocolate. And berries (possibly currant). The beer leaves a lingering hop/malt taste on the palate.  Overall: Words cannot adequately describe this beer. This is a world-class beer in every way, and is quite possibly the best beer ever made in the US of A. This is, by far, the best example of an Imperial Stout I have ever tasted. Drinking this beer is like floating through heaven on a majestic cloud of hops and malt.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,cbl2,4.12,"Appearance:  Thick opaque black with 1/4 inch tan/brown head.  Smell:  Roasted coffee/toffee with hints of licorice and bursts of cocoa.  Taste/Mouthfeel:  Very viscouse. Liquid sticks to the tongue, imparting a burnt chocolate/coffee flavor that lingers into a bitter semisweet chocolate finish. I have to admit I was expecting more (this beer has been quite built up in my mind), but I'm not truly disappointed. This is still an incredible beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,BuckeyeNation,4.75,"For this, my 250th review, I decided that I needed to drink one of the Storm Kings that has been patiently waiting in my cellar for a while now. I have a six-pack that is 17 months old and one that is 7 months old and I'll be reviewing one of the younger ones since the hops should be more aggressive. Victory hasn't let me down yet and I don't expect that they will this time either. Bottled on November 18 '03.  Darker than dark. Obsidian with a mere glimmer of dark brown at the bottom edge when held up to a bright sunlit window. The head is quite large and is one of the darkest that I've ever seen. It's milk chocolate brown and is stiff and thick, like a good ice cream-heavy milkshake. It falls at a glacial pace and is leaving beautiful, intricate patterns of lace on the glass. This is, without a doubt, the hoppiest smelling stout that I've ever had the pleasure to sniff. It has an absolutely great nose of roasted black malt and dark chocolate, laced liberally with citrus zest. I usually prefer my porters/stouts to be malty with just a kiss of hops, but SK may change my mind forever.  Oh my God! This stuff is amazing. The taste and near milk shake-like body are winning me over from the very first mouthful. The flavor is of melted Hershey's chocolate bars mixed with semisweet chocolate, espresso (easily overpowered by the chocolate, thank goodness) and a hint of anise. Maybe a little molasses, but it's not as prominent as in some other Imperial stouts. And let's not forget those glorious hops, bright and citrusy, putting this beer into a whole 'nother league. My preconceived notion about keeping the hops out of my 'dark' beers has been forever laid to rest. Once a hophead, always a hophead.  The body is incredible as well. I'm forever whining (about nearly every beer that I drink) that brewers don't give enough attention to the body/mouthfeel, that they don't make it full enough. No complaints here, Storm King has one of the biggest, thickest, creamiest bodies that I've ever experienced. Among porters/stouts, only Perkuno's Hammer, if my memory is to be trusted, has it beat. One minor problem--that could probably qualify as nitpicking--is that it feels ever so slightly chalky, which keeps it from achieving a true heavy cream silkiness.  Don't ask me why it took me more than 6 months to crack one of these open. Victory Storm King Stout is one of the biggest, baddest beers that I've ever had and is truly one of the very best.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,mobyfann,4.4,"Paid $8.49 for a 6pk.  The apperence is a beautiful dark roasted coffee colored base with a light chocolatey-small to midsized head that lacks some retention, but some lacing goes on. The aroma would be like a mocha espresso with some roasty flavors.  The taste is great sweet and roasty with that great coffee taste and and excellent aftertaste to follow. The mouthfeel is pretty nice, nothing to get worked up about, but the drinkability on the otherhand is out of this world. I'm having a hard time believing it's a 9.1% stout but it is, great stuff!  Final Opinion: A very good stout that will always have a home in my beer fridge. Victory for taste!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,abcsofbeer,4.85,"Wow! This is some good stout. I thought Brooklyn's Black Chocolate was good. This is better.  Pours like motor oil, dark and thick. Can't see any light through it. Creamy tan head is small and quickly disappears, leaving very little lace. The aroma was distinct and recognizable at first whiff. Chocolate and coffee with more emphasis on the coffee. The taste is coffee like too, but unlike real coffee, I like this (not much of a coffee drinker). There is a noticeable maltiness as well as hoppiness.  Excellent beer that goes to the top of my list.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Gump,4.13,"Pours a deep black, with mushroom brown head that looks more like a dessert topping. The scent wasn't what I expected at all. It was flowery, and hoppy. Excellent suprise.

345,1013,meathookjones,4.28,"12 oz bottle with a date of Jan 2003. Pours a used motor oil black with a large tan head. The head fades fairly quickly and leaves a nice lacing around the glass as it goes. This one smells of roasted coffee, dark chocolate with a hint of citrus hops thrown in. The taste starts with the chocolate and coffee flavors before the balancing bitter hops come in to even things out. No sign of the 10% in the nose or the taste of this beer. This has a good mouthfeel being creamy and smooth with decent carbonation. The drinkability on this one is amazing, I could drink this all day if it was 10%.

345,1013,wyllder,4.38,"This is my second review of old Stormy, but my first review off the tap.  What can I say that hasn't already been said?  Appearance: The Storm King mocks light, preventing any of it from penetrating it's black depths. It pours with a small head, nothing to delay you from getting down to business.  Smell: So much going on in here. Coffee, roasted malts, some subdued floral hops, maybe even a whiff of chocolate buried in there somewhere.  Taste: Love bites. And so does Stormy. The first hit is a pungent mix of hops, coffee & chocolate on the tip of the palate. On tap I found the malt smoothed this out quicker than the bottled version. Just a hint of alcohol under the surface to remind you of the trouble too much of this will get you in. Lingers on the palate deliciously, letting each sip last a minute if you let it (yeah, that would be saint-like patience!)  Mouthfeel is spot-on, and if not for the that slight alcohol tang, would be perfect.  Off tap I found this more drinkable than it's bottled version.  All hail the King!

345,1013,BeerResearcher,4.42,"12oz brown bottle. Bottled on Jan.28 03. It pours a roofing tar black with a medium-sized, fast fading head and some rims of lace. Big strong aromas vie for attention. Coffee, Kalua, fresh rye dough and a faint barn smell eventually settle into a dry malt smell. Espresso and malty flavors mingle and dance with lively citrus peel bitterness and black pepper. A strong taste of black licorice and Anisette lasts throughout. This potent brew can only be paired with very rich or strong flavored foods, with the exception of full cream vanilla ice cream.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,dedalus,4.82,"a beautiful beer in every respect. it arrived at the table a deep black in the low light, with a slight cap of cafe-con-leche-colored foam.  the nose was a blend of citrusy hops and deeply roasted malt, with chocolate, strong black coffee or espresso, and pizzelles and anise.  the coffee and chocolate hit the palate first, and then the brightly fruity hops come back. reverse olfaction brings the pizzelles back in for the long finish. there are none of the harsher, grittier, metallic flavors that mar the flavor profiles of some other heavily roasted beers. this lack of harshness allows this beer to deliver massive flavors but still remain very smooth.  the beer is thick and satifying, and with a mouthfeel this good on tap, i can only imagine how sublime it must be out of a cask.  imperial stouts usually deliver darker fruit flavors, but the storm king brings brighter, citrusy fruit flavors to the table, which is a welcome and startlingly effective departure from imperial stout conventions. the beer is dangerously drinkable, and in terms of aroma and flavor, it simply cannot be improved upon. gorgeous.  cheers,  d",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,cerevisiaephilus,4.75,Having this from the cask last night convinced me to finally review it. I figure its about time.  The head was decent from the pour and quickly subsided into a thin brown cover that could be roused with a quick swirl of the glass. I think this is pretty impressive for a cask ale.  Nose not nearly as aggressive as the draught versions I 've had. The hops on the CO2 version seem to eb much sharper and more intense. Here they were more mellow and blended nicer with the dark roasty notes.  Very tasty as always. Rich chocolate and roasted notes predominate with a hefty dose of bittering hops to even things out. I think I still like Bell's Expedition better though.  The mouthfeel on this beer is what its all about. Incredibly smooth and creamy but not overly thick like Bell's. I'd say about as nice as the Rogue Imperial but with much nicer flavors.  A very drinkable brew. I had a big glass and a smal glass of it in just less than 30 minutes...closing time. I managed to make it out of there with a growler of hellerbock to boot!,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,yemenmocha,4.52,"Ebony/Opaque color, with a thick tannish brown head. Absolutely mesmerizing.  Am I at the Cheesecake Factory having dessert or is this a beer? Whoa, the aroma is of turtle cheesecake, caramel, swiss chocolate, maybe rocky road ice cream. I could sniff this beer for hours.  On the palate, a big rush of chocolate coats the palate and is very, very rich. Chocolate and caramel maltiness dominate, with just enough hop bitterness to tame. The viscous liquid is oh so creamy and thick.  The finish is true to the chocolatiness mentioned above but it fades into a distinct toffee, maybe butterscotchy caramel taste. All of this with suprisingly little heat from the higher alcohol content.  I find this beer to be most enjoyable slightly chilled and served in a traditional Belgian style goblet. When chilled, the dessert aromas I mentioned are more prominent, yet when consumed at room temperature the beer lacks these aromas and has a more roasty, espresso coffee aroma. Try it both ways.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,nvsblman,4.78,"Appearance: Black, no light is making it through this beer. About a half finger of roasted brown head that dissipated over the course of a minute or so to leave only a ring around the glass.  Smell: The smell of freshly roasted coffee with a slight hint of hops.  Taste: Overwhelming flavor! So much flavor, so many tastes, so complex I don't even know where to begin. First thoughts are espresso, slight citrus hopiness, molasses. As it warms a bit of a chocolate character begins to emerge. Leaves a pleasantly dry aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Heavy, very creamy mouthfeel. Seems the perfect consistency for a sipping beer like this.  Drinkability: Despite the high ABV% I could drink a couple a long relaxing sitting, but probably not much more than that.  A very bold and flavorful beer, can't wait to sample this again!

The head diminishes to nothing more than a ring around the glass (which leaves behind some lacing on the glass) and a discontinuos skim of bubbles over the top of the beer. A strong smell of coffee and chocolate issues forth from the glass even when held at some distance. An inviting hint of hops also comes forth in the aroma. Tastes quite strongly and very nicely of coffee and espresso like flavors. Chocolate flavors and the bitterness of hops also come through nicely, particularly in the finish. Smooth and full-bodied, this very tasting beer is highly drinkable despite the rather high alcohol content.

345,1013,wailingwench,4.68,"Purchased multiple times at Consumers Beverage in Buffalo. A sixer is totally worth the $10.  Foam Factor: Poured silky smooth with a tan head that eventually gave way as it warmed. Black, black, and more black. No light penetration here.  Skunk Factor: Changes over temp range. Starts out strong, in your face, and hop-like. As it warms, becomes more refined as chocolate and nut- like notes kick in. Finishes coffee-like, a tad bitter, and craving more. I truly enjoyed the taste progression.  Tongueland: Tastes as it smells. The flavors that emerged really balance this beer. Imperial is a superb trip down stout lane. Untill this point, I prefered an oatmeal or cream stout. Imperial has regulated those to breakfest fare.  Chug Factor: I sipped this all night long. The 9.5 % ABV reminded me that this was a beer an hour product. I passed up the opportunity to play beer pong to drink this. Another night, we had a keg of Canadian. I passed on the Canadian (a rarity) to sit in the corner and engage in lively conversation about the quality of this beer. Made me want to get a pipe and some loafers and sit in front of a fireplace and act refined.  Bender: This has made me feel overall pretty good about life. Here in Buffalo, there is nothing worthwhile going on in the winter except for the day that Storm King arrives. I have it on my calender. A great way to relax and take some time off from plastic cups.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,GreenCard,4.1,"Appearance: deep deep mahogany, opaque, a thin layer of tan head quickly dissappears to leave some ""rorschach"" patterns on the surface, viscous looking liquid!  Aroma: a big hit of coffee and soy sauce, port-like, vitamins, malt, alcohol, burnt raisins  Flavor: initially sweet but then roast and sweet at the same time, the silky malt backbone slowly gives way to a robust coffee/burnt toast bitterness laced with a bit of hop flavor, finishes surprisingly dry with a long-lingering roasty aftertaste  Mouthfeel: full body, light but prickly carbonation, smooth, warming  Overall Impression: Wow, that pretty damn good! This beer definitely stands up to the hype. Rich and fortifying. Great with semi-sweet dark chocolate. Reminds me a bit of the Belgian Special Import Guiness, but a lot more complex and fantastic!

345,1013,Afterburner,4.72,"Appearance: Black as pitch. Totally opaque in my pint glass. Can't see any light coming through. A small amount of dark-brown head appeared and retired quickly.  Smell: Hops, coffee, chocolate, bourbon, plums, and malt all mix together in a pleasant miasma of aroma.  Taste: Outstanding flavor. Starts with the hops and some subtle woodiness, which gives way to a burst of vanilla, malt, and faint hints of anise midway through. The finish closes the proceedings with some strong mango flavors, more hops, and a barely noticable alcohol burn.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is almost perfect for this beer. Rich and velvety. The bead is small, so you don't have a lot of in-mouth effervescence. But there's enough there to give it texture.  Drinkability: Dangerously drinkable. The alcohol is hidden well. However, it's a reasonably heavy beer, so you'd probably fill up pretty quickly.  Overall: A nicely balanced Imperial stout, with a lot of complexity.

Mostly opaque in the glass with some ruby highlights at the edges. Roasted malt with coffee notes and floral hops in synchrony with each other in the aroma.  Taste shows a sweet, rich roasted malt backbone. Coffee notes with chocolate beginning to show more as the beer warmed. Big dose of floral hops with hints of citrus.

345,1013,joshlara,4.89,"Bottled Sept. 2002. This review was done within three months of bottling.  Appearance: Pours an opaque black color with a darker brown tan head that dissipates to a thin lace that clings to the glass. When you get that color head you know it is going to be one big beer.  Smell: Aroma is wonderful, cascade hops not usually associated with the imperial stout genra, tobbaco leaf, black cherries, coffee, and burnt chocolate all come through. Outstanding!  Taste: Wow! This is one extremely bitter beer. Burnt chocolate malt flavor up front, hints of coffee and tobacco throughout, finishing with that extremely bitter citric hop punch. I love the high amount of hops used which in my opinion takes this beer to another level and seperates itself from other imperial stouts. Finishes with an alcohol kicker to round out an incredible drinking experience.  Overall: I love this beer right after it is bottled as the hop presence is most pronounced. I absolutely love the aroma. I remember someone asking what is your favorite smelling beer and this is hands down. Black cherries, tobacco leaves, and pacific northwest hops dominate both the nose and the flavor. Extremely bitter but oh so drinkable. I love it!  I have also sampled the '02/'03 a little over a year after bottling and it is much more subdued, much more like other imperial stouts. The dark fruit flavors are more prominent and the citric hop flavors I like so much are definately take a back seat. They fade to the background. It mellows, more black currant, prunes, and raisins are found in both the nose and the flavor. It does seem smoother and silkier as it ages, but personally, I much prefer this beer young.

Smells great, lots of coffee-like aroma with a slight tocuh of alcohol, but not overpowering by any means. The taste is rich, complex, and smooth. Slightly hoppy, lots of coffee flavor, tiny bit of chocolate, and really masks the amount of alcohol that is in there. Great roasted flavor with a touch of sweetness.

Pours a deep black with a rocky head reminiscent of blown bubbles in your chocolate milk. An intoxicating aroma, slightly sweet as this beverage is a nice 9% ABV. What suprised me about this brew was the hoppiness. As a drinker torn between Stouts and IPAs in heaven as I had found my muse, my comprimise. O.K it isn't THAT hoppy. This beer was like a dark french roast coffee, not so much chocolate in this case. The mouth feel was smooth, and medium bodied which adds to it's drinkability. I could drink these all year long.

345,1013,woemad,4.36,"Bottle purchased at Jim's Homebrew in Spokane for $2.78. ""Bottled on Jan. 20 2004."" I bought a six pack about 2 weeks ago - the first time I had ever seen this in Spokane. This will be updated as bottles are sampled after aging.  This poured what appeared to be an ultra dark ebony color. When held up to the light, there is a slight browning around the edges. Very big mocha colored head. Took it's time going down, and never completely did disappear.  Smell is not terribly strong. it is mostly of coffeeish roast malts and dark fruits such as figs. There is also a slightly winey odor, reminiscent of port.  Taste is primarily of roasted malts. There is a slight hoppiness that comes in near the end and finishes with a mild crispness. This does not obscure the fact that the malts are the stars of this show, providing flavors similar to espress, figs, black currants, chocolate covered cherries, and port wine. Alcohol flavor really comes through as the beer warms up. Mmm, this is good. Very complex. This would be great with a rich chocolate dessert.  Mouthfeel is thick, which is perfect for an imperial stout. The viscosity of this stout matches 10-40wt. This is a dessert that comes in a bottle.  This is a very drinkable beer if you like imperial stouts. Otherwise this would be a bit much. Even a fan of the style, like me, would probably have to stop at two, because it is quite filling. There's also the abv factor (FWIW, my bottle lists the abv as 9.1% instead of 9.5, as per BA), as a few of these - if you have room for them - could get you into trouble.

Storm King pours well with a dark tanish head, and has a sweet, inviting smell of mostly dark roasted malts.  It's said that odors give us our best memories, Storm King kind of smells like the front row of a small town's club, if there are any musicians out there, they know what I mean: sort of damp and wet, with a hot gal flashing you.  The mouth feel is a bit like you've accidently got some bees in your mouth while riding without your helmet, which to me at least is a good thing, it gives me a feeling of freedom.  Let's be honest, the taste is really why we are here folks, and if you like great tasting 'fighting' beer, then this one's for you... This is easily one of the best, if not the best American Stout Beers avialable.  So, get it, drink it, love it.  Beer: it's what's for dinner.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,ColForbin,4.03,"Bottled on: Oct 29 02 Opened: Apr 5 04 [I cellared this beer for about a year before drinking.]  Pours with a thin dark tan head. Aroma is one of bittersweet chocolate, coffee and some bitter hops. A slight whiskey aroma as well. Smokey, chocolatey flavor with a bitter hop finish. Thick mouthfeel; coats the tongue as it goes down leaving a French roast aftertaste. This beer is a meal - it would be a challenge to have more than one. I've had this beer fresh as well, and I have to say that the fresh version is a little more lively and interesting. I do recommend aging a couple bottles - after a year the beer becomes incredibly smooth. But drink the majority of your six pack fresh.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,SeanChouffe,4.43,"Black opaque color with red highlights. No signs of effervescence in the body. A rich full tan head that diminishes rather quickly, but leaves a clingy lace. Aroma is of hops, roasted grains and chocolate. Mouthfeel is creamy like no other -- full bodied and smooth with low effervescence. The taste has a slightly sweet start roasted flavors in the middle and a welcome hop finish.  I can see what all the rage is about.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,DaveGood,4.37,"This beer poured pitch black with a thick light brown head out of a 12 oz. bottle. This is how a stout beer is supposed to look!  The aroma is mild on this. It contains a nice grassy hop scent but is primarily driven by the dark roasted malts. The alcohol is also fairly predominant in the smell.  What the aroma is lacking, the taste more than makes up for. It is a very thick, yet smooth beer with moderate carbonation. The taste is driven by the dark roasted malt flavors. There are dark chocolate and expresso flavors present, as well as a slight hoppy bitterness at the end.  Overall, this is a remarkable beer and I can definitely see what the buzz is about. It is extremely smooth and quite possibly the best stout that I have had the pleasure of experiencing.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Mitchster,3.05,"Pours out to an opaque black with barely distinguishable brown accents, forming a rocky dark-tan head (but not as dark as say, a Kzoo stout or Founder's Impy). Retention is good as is lacing. The label says it is bottle-conditioned...there is a small amount of peppered yeast in the bottom of the bottle. The aroma is rich and inviting, predominantly hoppy (distinctly Cascades) with notes of grass, cocoa, charcoal, light molasses, vanilla, almond, and sweet milk chocolate. As it warms, alcohol is overwhelmingly evident in the nose. Carbonation is moderate. Mouthfeel is paint-peeling hops, abrasive at first and then becomes astringent with burnt grains and alcohol towards the finish. Medium-dense body. Taste is initially sharp with a ton of citric hops and deeply roasted grains, sweet almonds, vanilla, toffee, and lots of burnt sugar. Bitterness level is moderate. The wierd finish begins with firmly burnt grains (heavy on the black patent here), chalkiness, an everlasting burnt sweetness, citric hops with pungent acidity, and lingering leather and burnt wood. There is mild isopropyl alcohol in the aftertaste, but as it warms, it becomes nearly obnoxious. I get this wierd creamed sweet corn taste in my belches. The 9.1% ABV is more evident in alcohol than in body, dextrins or mouthfeel, indicating a high degree of attentuation and suggesting a warmer (&gt;75F) ferment.  My first drink of this was from a bottle that was a year old and I was throughly unimpressed with how it aged. My notes indicate the mouthfeel was syrupy and flat, the finish was redolent with isopropyl and the rest was littered by odd off-flavors. This bottle is fresh and is much better. It's not a stand-out brew like the ratings would suggest, but then again, I'm used to Kzoo Stout as my everyday beer. IMO, this is overhopped and over-boozed, but some people may prefer the West-Coast style. I'll skip on this again.  BTW, this is not a typical Imperial Stout, but a West Coast style hop-bomb stout.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,grynder33,4.35,"Deep blackcolor, small head, creamy soft malt chocolate aroma, sweet chocolate light taste, soft aftertaste with a little bitterness.

Wish they would distribute to Wisconsin",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,merlin48,4.43,"This Victory product pours an opaque, ebony color with an immense, rocky, four finger tall, light brown, head. Retention was good, and lacing was superb. I've enjoyed more profound stout aromas before, but this one hits the mark, spot on, for style. Bigtime roasted malts dominate the nose, with coffee, chocolate, some smoky nuttiness, and a note of the 9.5% abv. Mouthfeel is robust and full bodied, and is smooth all the way down. Taste is awesome. Chocolate and roasted coffee, in just the right meld of flavors, with a burst of fresh McIntosh apples midway through. A solid, funky, hops presence lends a pleasant, bittery, nut balance. The high abv which I noted in the nose, is curiously absent in the taste, affording this stout a high drinkability mark. This is one of the five best American stouts on the market. Goes down smooth and easy, with an exceptionally smooth character. Very enjoyable paired with a sharp cheddar, or strong blue cheese like English Stilton. I could kick myself for buying a single bottle, instead of a case. Victory is quickly becoming one of my favorite American breweries, and Storm King is another excellent reason why this is so.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,PatandDavid,4.25,"One of those: this isn't my favorite style of beer, but it's time to see what the fuss is all about...and Storm King delivers! 10.5 pour enjoyed at Redbones last Friday. Very very dark, opaque. The head had the color of dark latte and was nice and frothy. Grassy hop aroma was intriguing. Taste was like roasted coffee meets hop, very interesting and well done. The mouthfeel was definitely full...I knew the alcohol was there, but they almost got away with it. I thought the finish was like dark chocolate. This beer deserves it's fine reputation.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Dark black bodied beer with a low creamy tan head,  Aroma is dark black roast, currants and a grassy herbal hop aroma. The faintest touch of diacetyl lurks deeply behind the other aromas only become apparent around the edges behind a brandywine alcohol.  Flavor is roasted and thick with caramel and an acrid black burnt carbon finish to the brew boosted by CO2, The final impression os chocolate and port in a beer that roundly clears itself off for the next sip.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Ellbert,3.26,"12oz. bottle dated March 18 2003  Appearance: Perfect, very very dark with a large pillowy head that leaves plenty of sticky lace and leaves a thin layer of foam all the way to the last drop of beer.  Smell: Very mellow compared to what I have had before. The hops are much more subtle after a year. Alcohol is more promident and the malts are more subdued. I can smell some mollasses and caramel though. Some roastedness also comes through.  Taste: Very sweet, almost too sweet. It leaves a string of over the top sweetness, almost sour in your mouth as the roasted malt and mollasses come in. The hops are subdued in the taste as well. Not very pleasant now.  Mouthfeel is great. Very thick and rich. Perfect amount of carbonation to add some tingling on the tongue.  Not very drinkable. The flavor has really taken a dive here, at least on this aged bottle. I prefer this fresh.   Initial tasting:  Apperance: The apperance of this beer is very good. It had a small head though which took away from the marvel of it. However it poured a drak brown but looks as black as night in the glass.  Smell: One thing that took me with this brew so far is that the hops are right up front in the aroma. I'm not used to that in the imperial stout style however it is very pleasing. There is also the smell of roasted coffee, a sweet malty smell is there too.  Taste: The taste seems to fade in, there is many flavors to this. There is a roasted flavor that sticks but there is a hop bitterness that shows itself towards the end. It leaves your mouth dry with a warming of alcohol.  Mouthfeel: Excellent, nice mellow feel, very thick and rich with just the right amount of carbonation. Leaves your tongue with a nice coating.  Drinkability: A very drinkable stout in the sense where I would love to have one. Definitely one of the better Imperials I have had but as to more than one sitting, I will have to pass. This is far to rich and to high in alcohol, and the alcohol is very evident.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,canucklehead,4.63,"Thanks to Malto for this sample. My god , the head looked like a Starbucks exploded into a full gale making me realize that this stout was for the big boys or girls. It smelled like a cross between Old Crusty and Rogue Imperial Stout mixed together; all plums, alcohol, hops and tobacco.  The taste was to say the least intense; big, nay huge hops with a backbone the size of Texas. I love Barleywines and so was not overwhelmed by the complexity and in your face profile of this beer. Yeah, cellaring would smooth things out but I loved this beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,57andcounting,4.65,"This highly regarded beer is even better from the cask. The dark head moves to a ring as time goes by. The smell is caramel, chocolate, tar, hops and a slight alcohol. The taste reflects the smell. Very, very smooth.  The balance between the heavy flavors, alcohol and hops is the best. This is the most drinkable stout beer. The mouth feel is light and clean.  This is a beer to enjoy with a good meal, on a cold, damp evening, or for that matter, in place of food. There is enough of body here that after a few glasses of this you wouldn't be hungry or cold.  Great beer, buy it every time you see it in the cast.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,HappyHourHero,4.43,"Froathy coffee colored head had faded to a film by the time I got the beer. The beer was dark opaque black in color. Sweet burnt malt aroma.

345,1013,CharlesRiver,4.63,"Just an outstanding beer what I could have time after time. This beer pours out solid black in color with a small tan head. The smell is coffee and chocolate all the way. Malty and grainy as well. The taste is like a strong cup of espresso. Complex and long, this is a beer to sip. Coffee flavors kind of die down but the chocolate richness comes through more. I am guessing this is a fresher keg as some hop notes come through at the end.  A world class beer that I could drink at ANYTIME!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Shiredave,4.58,"As black as a cave at night with a firm cap of light brown foam, the lace caramelizes on the glass. Aromas is sweet blacked malt and floral hop - notes of espresso and wood smoke. Soft scents that dont overpower but draw you in. Flavors explode up front with seamless blend of scorched sugars from the roasted malts, balanced almost perfectly by strong, piney hop sharpness. Awsome!  Mouthfeel is smooth and supple - you know its full bodied but it just doest feel it. The chalky chocolate and coffee flavors stay in the finish along with long, warm bittering. Alcohol just along for the ride, reminds you of its presence in the burps. An awsome brew for the BIG stout lover. As deserving of BA #2 status as any I can think of. ( which would be at least 20 )",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,twilight,4.67,"The first time I had this was two months ago, and I *hated* it, so I think I might have had a bad bottle before, or I'm having an exceptional one now. Pours black as midnight, and seemingly thicker than normal beer into a nonick pint with virtually no head. Still, the color is dead on for an imperial stout, and the blackness just makes me want to drink it now. Aroma is of roasted barley with hints of belgian sweetness. I'd say plums, but it's only what I imagine plums to smell like. The smell is thick, is the best way to describe it. Taste is overwhelmingly roasted mixed in with some slight fruity sweetness that finishes into this slight sourness that that is holy on the palate. Though I may not agree with the fruityness in the beer, it is amazing. The coffeelike textures of the flavor, and the portlike sweetness. It's to die for. Carbonation is a moot point. I mean, it's there, but the full richness in the mouth. It's too delicious to be quaffed all night, but if I find this on tap. I'm going to be a rider on the storm. An excellent offering from Victory, and an addition to my trinity of Imperial Stouts (this, Samuel Smith and Rogue) so far. I'm going to have to look for another sixer to be able to enjoy this until it comes out again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

345,1013,ManekiNeko,4.47,"12 oz. bottle served at cellar temperature in a Trois Pistoles goblet. Bottled on 3/18/2003.  Appearance: Like a black hole that absorbs all light.. perhaps it's that elusive dark matter cosmologists are scouring the sky for? A small brown head with the lifespan of a mayfly forms and leaves thin remnants of lace on the glass... dusky remains of the day.  Smell: Heavy roasted malts, dark and bitter espresso, slightly tart and sweet dark dried fruits. Aaah sweet harmony.  Taste: Roasty, toasty, charred, and burnt malt sweetness. Quite bittersweet. Espresso flavors kick in and then the beer finishes off with some light prune-like fruitiness. Light hints of hop bitterness on the tip-of-the-tail-end.  Mouthfeel: Alcohol is very well masked. Hearty and robust sensation in the mouth. A burly beer with the equivalent of 5 o'clock shadow at 7 am.  Drinkability: It's hard to find a better imperial stout than Storm King. I hoping the mid-March bottling of last year will be repeated this year so's I can get a fresh 6-er or three for the cellar.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Bierguy5,4.55,"Bottled on Nov. 4, 2003. Pours a dark, practically black thick liquid with an incredible tan creamy head. This is the best head on a beer I have seen in a long time. The lacing on the glass was outstanding. The smell is of coffee, like a great dark roasted almost burnt smell. The taste was even better. Strong coffee-like flavor with what I thought was a hint of vanilla. Good amount of hop bitterness at the end. Tastes even better as it warms. This is a beer you want to sip for a while. I have found that the higher alcohol content is somewhat hidden. Good mudium-full body. This, despite being high in alcohol is a fairly drinkable beer, as imperial stouts go. I have had this beer in a bottle, and on draft, and so far I actually prefer the bottle version. I look forward to Storm King every year, and this year is no exception.

The smell is faint but some hoppy aromas are definately there. My first sip of this sweet nectar revealed that this is the hoppiest stout I have ever tasted, but the bitterness was balanced perfectly by notes of chocolate and malt. This beer is strong at 9.5% but the creamy mouth feel makes me want to keep drinking more. This is an excellent stout and I would be interested in cellaring some.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,jtfest,4.23,"This is a beautiful beer. It pours black as tar with a creamy chocolate/coffee head -- thick at first, then settling into a foamy layer leaving heavy lacing on the glass. The aroma is roasted and nutty with big malt undertones. The mouthfeel is exceptional: thick, soft, ""meaty"" and just a hint of carbonation. The taste? Others have described it far more eloquently than I can, but let me confirm there admiration. Slightly sweet, with woody and toasted hints that either compliment or mask the alcohol. Dangerously drinkable considering the 9.5% -- Storm King Stout lives up to its reputation.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,sulldaddy,4.68,"This beer is sampled at room temp. I pour the brew into my snifter. The beer pours pitch black with a 1 inch creamy tan tightly packed head foaming up easily. The head also fades slowly to a surface layer in my glass. Aroma is a mixture of grassy hops and roasted malt, very balanced nose! First sip gives me a creamy texture and slightly bitey carbonation. Flavor is twangy sweet like a baltic porter up front and then earthy hops in the middle, while the finish is roasted malt and even brief hits of chocolate. This beer is incredibly well balanced and easy to drink. No hint of the ABV.

Poured into an imperial pint glass, foamy half inch medium brown head formed on top of motor-oil opaque liquid, no light getting through this baby. Good lacing, with the beer almost thick enough looking that it seems to flow like oil as well. Great aroma, plenty of hops, yet the underlying malt strength and alcohol make their presence known. Strong coffee and burnt malt tastes, which quickly are well balanced by a hop bite like most stouts are missing. Taste of alcohol isn't present nearly as much as you would expect for a beer this size, just sort of lurks in at the end. Actually as good as I had heard it was, no false rumors here...",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,BCMan,4.38,"This beer pours up very dark, black even. No chance of light penetrating this brew. An aggresive pour generated a brown head of frothy bubbles. The foam dissapated quickly and faded back to a thin layer on top of the beer that laced the sides of the glass as to beer dissapeared. The aroma is very subtle, nutty with malt overtones. Mouthfeel is very smooth and a bit thick. Flavor is a nice balance od malt, coffee and hop bitterness.

At 9.1%, I would expect more alcohol presence, but it is nicely blended into the aroma. Smells of dark chocolate and roasted barley are predominant. Taste is strongly hoppy (cascade is the only hop i can pick out,) especially on the forefront, and settles into a nice, creamy roasted chocolate presence. A very bold beer, even for the style. Hearty, roasted barley aftertase lingers long into the evening.

Pours a beautiful black with a tan head. Lace is there throughout the drink. Smells like malt, chocolate bitter coffee.  Taste is the real treat. Good dark chocolate taste. Somewhat sweet. Malt and hops are there. A strong dark stout this drinkable would seem impossible. If you don't believe me, try this. My wife(who drinks Bud lite) even liked this. The alcohol is not apparent. We tried this with some good dark chocolate. What a combination!!. This a good stout and enjoyable to drink. This was rated very highly at one time.

Deep, cream black pour. An absolutely beautiful, thick and fluffy brown head, clings to the side of the glass endlessly. Smell is of cocoa, malt and roasted coffee. Taste is solid, thick and very, very malty. The burnt taste typical of stouts is there, but doesnt override the hoppyness of this brew. This is almost the perfect blend of sweet and bitter.

345,1013,PSUDREW,4.17,"Honestly, I so much prefer this beer aged a year or so. becuase the hop presence is the dominat taste in the beer when served ""fresh"".  The pour is no doubt black, with a nice layer of creamy head, and some lace following later on.  Very thick very creamy. if in an aged botle, the malty, roasted chocolate is present more then anytihng else, and it makes a nice sipping beer, very very drinakble  when fresh out of the bottle, it is a different story. Very strogn taste, has not had time to level out. Hop presence over anything else really. Still good, but takes time to finish consuming.  well played indeed  ****after further review of the play*** After agin it some, and going back to the brewery for it a couple of times, this brew has really grown on me after time. The taste no longer is that smack you in the face nature that the hops have, but more blended, and subtle. The hops presence has dimished in the profile, but the roasted presence increases, and, the chocolate blends nicely as well. Still, a great beer.

345,1013,yeagerbm,4.4,"I'm reviewing this one by bottle, but previously had it cask conditioned. Appearance- Very black, cannot see through this beer at all, it is thick and has the viscosity of motor oil. Maintained a thin brown head that stuck to the sides of the glass. A few swirls of the glass and the head reappears about 1/4 in. thick. Overall appearance-- Excellent!  Smell- The predominate smell of this beer is a sweet alcohol aroma, similar to a barleywine  Taste- Taste is like strong espresso. Tart, almost fruity sweetness. a noticeable alcohol presence.  Mouthfeel- The mouthfeel was hurt in the beginning with too much carbonation. It is much more enjoyed at the bottom of the glass or from the cask with low carbonation. The bubbles only seem to mask the flavors. It may be enjoyed better from the bottle if left sitting 20 or 30 minutes or so to warm and flatten out after pouring. In the end though the mouthfeel was very good.  Drinkability- was very easy to drink. I'm feeling the effects of the alcohol even after one of these. The flavor was intense but not overpowering for a stout drinker, but might be enough to kill a bud drinker.

345,1013,pootz,4.52,I like a good Baltic or XX porter so trying this Victory stout was done on a friend's advice. I'm glad I took the bait. The first thing one notices about this porter is the incredibly complex aromas. The balance is almost perfect between chocolate-fruity sweetness and bitter hopping. The mouth feel is full and rewarding and it has a dry-ish tart finish as the hops take over the delicious complex musty body.  Comes in a long neck brown pint impressive label with freshness date. Poured a dark smokey mahogany that denies light to be seen through it (like a malted black hole). Smallish brown head dissipates quickly and goes to a thin ring that clings to the sides of the glass for the rest of the drink.  Pungent smells of musty chocolate and cherries and alcohol....deeelicious!  Starts with a strong surge of full bodied sweet maltiness with smoky- chocolate accents and hints of fruit then thins out a bit on the back of the palate as the hopping kicks in and becomes a well balanced taste of bitter sweet mustiness then finishes tart with a tinny hop aftertaste...marvelous!  This is a really good beer if not a great beer. Ill be back for more.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,JimsArcade,4.37,"(Bottled on 12/15/03) The beer pours somewhat thick and is as close to black as dark-brown gets. A pillow-like head the color of beer-bottle brown goes from two to three fingers high in a standard pint glass. A cascade is apparent, though not to the degree of beers poured from nitrogen-based delivery systems, and ends with a thin head leaving some sticky lace around the glass.  An aroma of bitter sweetness is apparent, suggesting hints of German cherry cordials in the nose, to coffee in the nose and mouth in conjunction, and finally to dark rum in the mouth thanks to the mildly apparent alcohol.  The first taste is overwhelmingly like chocolate-flavored espresso, and feels just as dense. It is rather hoppy for a stout, but it fits in well. After the initial surprise reaction to the flavor mix, each passing drink becomes smoother. The carbonation is medium throughout. As the beer warms, the alcohol becomes more and more apparent, the sensation of which peaks at mid-glass. It finishes sweeter than it began.  I think I definitely picked a winner for my first review. I have tasted only a handful of brews that top this, but I look forward to the possibility of discovering more.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Smell: Dark roasted coffee predominates. Faint hints of a citrusy hop smell are noted. Lovely smell.  Taste: Initial taste is a dark coffee/toffee taste, bitterness is well done but not too overpowering. Finish is a lovely balance of hoppy bitterness and a surprising malt sweetness.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and creamy, huge body, CO2 level is spot on, Alcohol is very well done for the level.  Drinkability&Notes: My thanks to Glen for buying this one for me; I don't think I would have tried this one, but this beer is so damned smooth it could make the Terminator cry.

345,1013,Crosling,4.53,"First and foremost, I would like to thank Miquel for hooking me up with a wide variety of Eastern beers. It was certainly a pleasure.  The Storm King....sampled at room temperature  Pours pitch black with a very dense lightish brown head. The head was perfect and the lace was even better. Before I even smelt this beer I played with its lace for a good 15 minutes. I was fascinated by it. It stuck perfectly every time.  Aromas are of rich roasted burnt dark malts, black licorice, chocolate, dripping fruits and alcohol. Hops are violent in the aroma, perhaps a foreshadow of what is to come??  Very hoppy. Wish I knew the IBU's...just a little curious. Hoppier and fruitier than most Imperial Stout it seems. A little thin in the mouth but a very lingering bitter finish. Black licorice, roasted malt..and lots of it, dry chocolate and lots of expresso are all around its flavor profile.  This was a very very good offering. I liked it more than the Old Rasputin I had earlier today.  Great beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,bigbubba,4.28,"This dark black imperial stout pours thick and oily into the glass. A huge brown head appears, and sticks around, coating the glass all the way down. There was a terrific bitter, coffee, chocolate flavor, and a great hop-malt balance. The high alcohol was not obvious while drinking it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,TerryW,4.08,"Black, black, black without a hint of light peeking through the glass. Great big dark brown head, good lace. This beer looks beautiful when you pour it in a glass, lots of action, great colours.  Sweet nose full of coffee and fruit. Noticeable alcohol underlays this.  Thick and sweet on the palate with a drying bitter finish. Roast coffee and chocolate, dense heavy fruit, rum like. Gotta chew your way through this one.  Overall quite enjoyable",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Phyl21ca,4.02,"Bottle - Poured a dark black brew with a huge foamy dark head. Aroma of roastiness and coffee are very present. Strong body with subtle taste of alcohol. Very complex, taste of coffee, caramel and chocolate are mix very well. One of the best Imperial Stout I had the chance of drinking.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,UnionMade,4.37,"The beer pours a solid opaque black, topped with a light mist of taupe head. A thick collar of head maintains throughout, dwindling a bit towards the bottom, but never disappearing. The aroma is quite powerful. Copious amounts of burnt malt, with considerable coffee. Chocolate malt and some toffee is present to a lesser extent, with hints of estery plum, black cherry and red grape. Slightly vinous, with noticable alcohol. The hops are rather outspoken, providing a brash, rind-like, grapefruity citric odor, with a pleasant herbal quality as well. The flavor starts out with an almost charred roasted maltiness. Tons of bittersweet flavor, coffee-like in character, with chocolate and toffee throughout. Deep fruitiness breaks in, hinting at prune, black cherry, red grape and a suggestion of fig,without the sweetness. The hops kick in rather quickly, breaking on the malt with a huge grapefruity tide that rides into the swallow. Some alcohol is apparent in the long finish, adding a bit of solvent bitterness. Tangy citric hops and bittersweet coffee maltiness linger in the aftertaste, which stays with you for quite a while. Huge body, with a smooth, almost sherrylike mouthfeel and soft carbonation. Aged feeling, with a very assertive fresh hopping. Interesting, complex and delightful. This is the first time I've tried the beer young. Every other was aged for at least 8-9 months. The hopping is absolutely fantastic, kind of like what would happen if you combined imperial stout with india pale ale. A very challenging brew, without much in the way of sweetness. Great stuff, although it'll seriously take it's toll on any beer you'd dare to follow it with.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Stimack,4.15,"After hearing all the hype and discussions on this beer I had to finally give it a try! The brew poured a midnight black color with a deep brown head, which dissipated rather quickly and left a little lacing on the glass. This beer has some wonderful aromas that just seem to have a real good balance. The smells are of chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, and a bit of hops, a fantastic mix. The taste is very nice, first I can notice a coffee-malt sweet taste that goes great together. The finish is a little hoppy and bitter and that surprised me a bit. It feels like a thick but smooth beer that has a lot of nice flavors. This is a very good stout, one that I would definitely go out of my way to find. Probably not as high on it as others on rating this brew but overall and excellent experience!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Indybeer,4.23,"12 oz bottle. Poured a pitch black with a moderate head that didn't stick around long, but left some lacing on the glass. Aroma is quite nice. Roasted malt, chocolate, and espresso coffee. Taste is more of the same. Nicely balanced, and not overpowering with the bitterness. Moderate carbonation, and a silky smooth mouth feel. An interesting beer, considering imperial stouts are not my beers of choice. Very good.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,HiroProtagonist,4.6,"Storm King was served from a 12 oz bottle, with a bottle date of May, 2003. It was poured into an imperial pint glass, with a small rough brown head rising and quickly falling to become a ring and scattered continents of foam, set upon a bottomless black ocean...no Valdez in sight, just waves of fine blanketing lacing. This world of a beer was richly aromatic, with massive notes of dark sharp cocoa, oak, molasses, and cola. The nose had an incredible depth and power, but was not offensive in the least. The taste was equally powerfully, and balanced with a masterful touch. The smooth semi-sweet malt body was rich with flavors of dark choolate, espresso beans, and perhaps licorice. This is followed by an excellent lively pop of zippy bitter chocolate and cola flavor that melts off the back and sides of the palate. The perky yet balanced quality of this sensation is what sets this stout apart from the rest. The finish is perfectly bitter and semi-dry, with the delightful flavors lingering on and on after each sip. It was extremely rich, yet superbly balanced and quite drinkable, a combination that many of the big stouts fail to pull off. Nowhere did I detect any alcohol. Bravo, Victory! Big thanks to PintOfAle, who made this review possible.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Shiloh,4.3,"Very nice stout, had expected a lot out of this brew and was not disappointed. Black as coal, very short tan head leading to a thin ring. Nose is of licorice and dark chocolate. The taste was of dark chocolate with an extra shot of bitterness then smooths out nicely to a slight malt appearance. Very smooth then continues to the hops. The alcohol becomes evident to the end.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,winomark,4.18,"Bottled 9/9/02  Appearance: Jet black; no light escapes. Thin, wispy chocolate haed.  Aroma: Sweet licorice, coffee, and chocolate. Hops make a nice, noticable appearance.  Taste: Rich roasted malt, some alcohol heat, and hops balance perfectly. Slightly sweet and smoky finish.  Mouthfeel: Coating and thick, but not syrupy by any means. Long, slightly hoppy and smoky finish. Very nice.  Drinkability: A fabulous beer! Great balance of all the components. Another Victory stunner!!!   2003 bottling  Appearance: Pitch black with a thin, clingy light brown head.  Aroma: Chocloate malt and alcohol sweetness most noticable. Slight hop spice makes an appearance.  Taste: Loads of coffee and chocolate, wit a dry, hoppy, slightly bitter finish. Long lingering finish. Very nice.  Mouthfeel: Rich and coating across the palate. Wonderful balance of all components. Alcohol is noticable.  Drinkability: A stellar stout! Not as much hop balance as the 2002, but very close. I will hunt for this brew every year.  Thanks to OldFrothingSloth for the bottle.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Bruiser81,4.58,"This brew was solid black in color with a huge frothy head that blew up on the pour. The head settled down a little but not much lasting through the whole session. Lacing almost completely caked the sides of my glass. The aroma wasn't real strong but had many distinct characteristics. It seemed to have a sweet tobacco smell to it which I thought was odd. However mixed in with hints of chocolate, raisins, and sweet malt it was pleasant. Alcohol spices were barely noticeable along with a certain bitterness. The taste was great, sweeter than I thought it would be, but still very good. Up front comes sweet and roasted malt flavors. In the middle starts what would be an overpowering hop kick if it wasn't for the sweet malt to balance it out. A bittery aftertaste with a little bit of alcohol on the back end. Very tasty. Mouthfeel is creamy smooth and goes down very easily. This beer didn't have much time to warm up because it didn't last long. It would be great to be able to get a hold of this on a regular basis. Big Thanks to feloniousmonk for sending this my way.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Sammy,4.23,"It was an expresso stout all the way. I see some people paying $10 . That could not be for a bottle! I paid $2.25. Good choice for the end of a session or meal because of the aftertaste. Unless you do not like coffee.  Had a second bottle, two years later and aged for that time. The carbonation eased off and it was rich smooth flavour. An excellent representative of its style.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,garymuchow,4.43,"So is this the 2nd best beer...  Aroma of chocolate, roast and fruit, especially mix of the latter two. Pours somewhat slowly. Dark brownish to black head that's 1/2 inch thick. Bottle conditioned (the the floating yeast in glass and bottom of bottle). Black as night. Heavy lacing. Rich and smooth. Chocolate and roast. I really like the initial taste on the tip of the tongue, as it passes throught the rest of the muscle the malty dryness and bitterness present without losing the smooth feel. Extended roast at finish. Maybe this is an oxymoron, but mildly coy. Not excessive in sweetness/richness yet both notable. Only disstaste was a slight unpleasant bitterness with the roast finish. Otherwise sublime. Feel is velvet. A beautiful beer.  ...I can't answer where it should fit (2nd, 20th etc.), but it certainly belongs on the list of the best.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Ardon,4.2,"Appearance: Black as night. Small frothy milkshake like head.  Smell: Hops, pine. Medicinal character. Raisins.  Taste: Raisins, bitter chocolate. Strong burnt cedary hop character for a stout. More acidic than would be expected.  Mouthfeel: Beautifully soft creamy mouthfeel. Thinner than appearance suggests.  Drinkability: Alcohol is masked well. Too easy to drink.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Hell, the head is darker than most beers alone. Smell- roasted coffee, nuts, cocoa, and ash. Taste- Ashy, coffee, sweet burnt wood. Alcohol is too strong. Mouthfeel- damn that high alcohol what is this cough syrup?!  Overall- blahhh! Its too sweet and alcohol is too strong. A mediocre, at best, stout. I'll pour the rest down the drain!  ***revisited*** 4/15/07  HAHA what 3 years will do! Clearly when I was a FNG my tastebuds weren't developed yet. My opinion has since changed immensely.

345,1013,babyhobbes,4.11,"This stout pours deep, dark black with a large brown head. It smells of espresso and chocolate malts. This looks and smells a lot like an espresso. The taste is similar to the smell and quite strong. There is a bitterness immediately in the mouth but this balanced with a sweet taste in the finish. The taste definitely improved as the brew warmed up.  This is a thick, smooth drinking admirable stout.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Popsinc,4.57,"Appearance: a pure black pour with a nice looking, dark tan head..  Smell: the nose just oozes of cocoa and espresso bean. dark unsweetened chocolate is underneath it all, just waiting to pop out.  Taste: i found the taste to be somewhat toned down from what the nose had prepared me for. still, a nice cocoa flavor with light hints of espresso bean and mild chocolate. very smooth body that ends nicely chalky and heads towards a bitter and dry finish. Was that orange in the mix too?! Hmmm, seemed like it to me.  Mouthfeel: very very creamy and rich...but not full or heavy. very nice staying power with flavors lingering nice and long.  Drinkability: a top notch stout. greay nightcap or dessert beer....or hell, whenever. right now i'm enjoying it on a cold winter day. This is a classic.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,stewart124,4.7,"A deep black body with a thick mocha head, almost like coffee. The smell is of chocolate malts with hints of espresso and well balanced hops. Hops are more noticable in this brew than in most stouts. A little something different that Victory likes to do. The alcohol is well hidden within this brew. A very smooth-thick body packed with taste. The chocolate/coffee flavor is quite distinguishable. This is a very rich beer that only gets better as it warms. The blend of grains and hops is outstanding in this beer and you wouldn't think it's 9% abv. Victory came through again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,hustlemuscle,4.38,"I will add my voice to the vast army of Storm King afficiandos, in the hopes that some day this fine brew will be available on tap at one of America's favorite Generic Family Resturants.  The brew pours a deep black with a mocha colored head that stuck around for a while. Holding it to one's nose and giving it a swirl brings a mixture of scents to the nose, including perhaps a little coffee.  Storm King is very smooth, with a strong presence in one's mouth, bringing some hops, some fruit and maybe some coffee to the taste buds. It is hard to describe what exactly one is tasting here, but to be sure it is good. Just a really nice beer that is fine company on a sunday afternoon. My most purchased beer of late, having gone through 3 six packs in as many weeks.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Smells of chocolate malt and hops.  Taste: Coffee and rich chocolate with a nice bitter finish. The hops that were present in the smell do not show up in the flavor. The alcohol is noticeable but rather subtle considering the high ABV.  Mouthfeel: Thick and creamy. There is a slight tingle on the tongue from the alcohol.  Drinkability: I savored it for about an hour, but I could have downed it much faster and had another right after.  This beer is very similar to Brooklyn's Black Chocolate Stout and has become one of my new favorite stouts. I'll be coming back.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,claytri,4,"The black of well fired malt, topped by a muddy head that recedes quickly. A smell of grapes and malt at a level that teases, but does not overpower. A good strong taste that can win you over to this style. It is heavy on maltiness, but includes the same taste of grapes. There are hints of wine, and the hops provides a nice finish. The taste has some nice changes as the beer warms. This stout is smooth and well bodied in your mouth. There is little carbonation so it goes down smooth. This is beer that will make a nice change of pace, or when a strong beer is desired.  I'm glad I received six of these for Christmas. This is a style and beer that I would have taken longer to try. My preference is, and will remain, lighter golden and wheat beers. However this has opened a new area to me. I had tried other stouts and was not as favorably impressed. I now know that a well brewed stout can provide a good alternative experience. I will probably have more of this fine beer in the future.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,99bottles,4.85,"Wonderful beer. I am glad I finally tried it. i am KICKING MYSELF IN THE *** that I passed up the oppurtunity to have it on cask at KCLingers. Mmmm. Cask. Anyways, the beer is deserving of its stature, and my opinions of it are as follows. Storm King pours a black brown body topped with a head of tawny brune, inch thick that settles within a few minutes to a thin lace. The King, he smells like a beast. Heavy bitterness ensues, the hops gnash their bite at you, the thick sweetymalt longs to run and settle. The taste of this beer is something special. My initial notes read 'Stout on Drugs. Doesn't give a second. Heaves flavor full-bore- hops, malts, unspeakable smoothness'. That's what I felt at that point. Now, I just long to to taste it once more. It's full, but not heavy. It's complex and myriad. If a person was blessed enough to drink one every day, they still couldn't explain it in a year. It's something to be had, and admired, and never taken in the wrong way. It is so wonderful, I adivse not buying a lage quantity to age. They'll never make it.  Update-- I went back and tried this on cask at KClinger's. Even smoother, with more pronounced malt sweetness. Good for them for putting another out there. Absolutely divine.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,PartyHatjo,4.55,"The first thing that hit me when I opened the bottle was that the hop nose wasn't masked by the malt character of the stout. It pours a nice black color with a tan/coppery head that doesn't linger. The roasted malt taste is prevalent with a bit of hoppiness peaking through.  This is a very smooth beer with the malt balancing the bitterness nicely. The alcohol is masked well, but you can feel it after two.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,waughbrew,4.33,"Darkest brown head that I think I have ever seen rides on top of a pitch black body. Frothy engine oil maybe. This beer is great, with a big espresso-like character and beautiful mouthfeel. The large hop flavor meshes pretty darn well with the deep, dark malts. The only real fault I find with this beer is a certain lack of depth in the flavor. What is in the flavor from the start lasts a long time, but it doesn't really evolve much, which is something I look for in a complex brew. I would like to taste this same beer with a different yeast that might lend it a more complex and evolving character. That being said, it is a damn fine brew (and a rediculous steal at its price!)",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,rkhaze,4.87,"Bottled Dec. 17, 2002. Poured out black with some dark chestnut colors just escaping the edges. No head developed to speak of. Lots of smells. Coffee, chocolate, dark roast malt and hints of molasses and licorice. Complex tastes of sweet heavily roasted malt, dark coffee, chocolate covered cherries and a hint of licorice. There was a nice subtle smoky element and a spicy/tangy hop bitterness that balanced it out. Well hidden alcohol. Great job! Medium bodied. Rich and creamy but lacking the viscous feel of some Imperials. Excellent drinkability.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Beervis,5,"This beer is amazing!  After taking one sip I knew I was in for a treat. It pours very dark with a nice thick brown head leaving great lace on the glass as you drink it.  The taste explodes in your mouth and never seems to stop. Chocolatey/Coffee notes on the palate, and a generous hopping add to a very complex mouthfeel. Even as the beer goes down your throat, with it's warming feel, the aftertaste keeps kicking with hops.  The complexity of this beer is amazing, and it's incredible drinkability makes it a little dangerous (quite the potent alcohol kick!)...as I can see myself drinking a lot of it!!  This beer is definitely my favourite Winter beer so far.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,littlebibs,4.4,"Finally got to try this much talked about stout, bottled Nov. 03 and I will say this is pretty close to a masterpiece from the Victory brewers. I've started trying these stouts when I can find them and thanks to beer advocate.com I have a true source and so many opinions to go by. I love the Magic Hat stouts and porters(they never fail to surprise me with their secret ingredients, not massed produced) at times they've been a bit on the watery side but always delicious, now I've come across STORM KING and it is a gem of a beer. It has a nice bite to it but is so smooth, I could easily drink a few of these, but they have a kick!! What a beautiful dark tan creamy head(reminds me of a root beer head) slowly fades away with a nice lace around the glass. This is a dark knight who meets the chocolate/coffee expresso crowd late night and happens to bring along some dark roasted malt fruit friends. The tastes all get along just fine, Wow what a find. It ranks right up there with the best but you have to try all these stouts to truly appreciate the difference in the quality.

The aroma was slight and had to discern any real flavors. The taste was extremely smooth and balanced. Unlike most imperials no strong flavors really came out, this one was definitely lighter in body and mouthfeel. The dominant malt flavor was espresso but it wasn't sweet at all. This beer was also hoppier than what I'd imagined it would be. The finish provides and acidic bitterness that lingered for a long time. Defnitely a well crafted beer but not on the top of my list for Imp. Stouts.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

The aroma is malty and roasty, with only a slight hint of alcohol.  The flavor is all that one could want from an imperial stout. I would serve this beer to an emperor. A full mouth-feel, with chocolate, roastiness, maltiness, and a subtle but firm bitterness from the hops, this beer pleases on many levels. Very satisfying.  I think I'll have another.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Pungent earth tones and chocolate notes swim up and fill my head as I inhale the roasted barley and sweet smokiness. I smell the damp, Northeast woods and faint mist of the forest.  I pour the dark elixir into my mouth. It is smooth with deep roasted low notes. I am satisfied. As it cascades into me Im left with a sweet bitter honey afterthought that lingers and slowly dissipates as I reach for another sip of this delicious stout.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Maestro,4.62,"This is an amazing stout. I love the blackness and the overall intimidation this beer brings. The nose is quite nice. It has a sweet and powerful smell to it. The head is tan and lasts for the entire pint. The beer is great by smell and appearance alone. The taste is phenomenal. The Victory crew does a great job of masking the alcohol. There are a lot of roasty, chocolatey flavors that are prevelant at the front of this beer. The hops are definitely American and make this stout a nice treat. The malt is great in that it doesn't ever give up. The body holds for the entire beer. Drinkability is great being that the flavors are so good and the alcohol is masked. Definitely deserves to be in the top 50. Cheers.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

They don't get it.  Smells sweet, malt, chocolate, coffee, fruit.  Pours slick from bottle, black color, frothy inviting tan head.  Tastes like a stout should. Complex full-bodied with hints of citric, robust malt. Damn good.  ABV is barely believable, this beer is so drinkable.

The taste is a little bit of a letdown for me in comparison to some other imperials I've had lately. This one is chock full of the goods, coffee, licorice, dark fruit and raisin. Can't dispute that. However, the finish is so dry and harsh that I can't give the taste high marks when you compare it to the likes of Sam Smith or North Coast. It's a darn good stout, just a little raw for my liking.

It slowly subsides leaving its lattice work along the way.  Aromatic indeed. Roasted malts with chocolaty undertones. Is this a cafe mocha. Hoppy with hints of orange.  Ohh Yeah... Tastes like a dark chocolate truffle dipped in gourmet coffee. Has a slight hoppy aftertaste of orange zest. Second sip beats the first. What a find. The bottle states an ABV% of 9.1, but I didn't taste alcohol... could be dangerous.  Nice mouthfeel is not too full.  I will definitely buy this beer again after my six pack is gone.

Aroma surprisingly hoppy with notes of fruit, rum, chocolate, and roasted grain. Front end is sweet with tastes of cherry and espresso that yields to a more bittersweet chocolate and roasted malt taste. This is one heavy duty brew! Finished bitter and dry. Floral and citric hops present throughout to provide a wonderful balance. Very complex and satisfying. Mouthfeel is smooth and full.

Expresso and roasted malt aroma with alcohol esters Roasted malt, toast, raisin and licorice, dark chocolate and brandied cherries. Gives a very chocolaty and expresso like impression. Good bitterness in the back, and some acidity probably from the roasted malt. Smooth, with a medium full feel, robustly flavored, and nicely drinkable for 9.5 ABV. This was bottled on 11/18/03 it may be too young for drinking when I had it (12/20), I put a couple up to age.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,canoehornpoint,4.53,"Pours completely black. No chance of any light getting through this. Had a nice thick brown head with a burnt and toasted malt nose. This is a stout that is packed with flavors, toasted malts, burnt malts, chocolates, finishing with a sweet maltiness. This starts lighter than i would expect and finishes full. This is a great beer but a filling beer. I would have trouble putting down more than a few of these, not because I didn't like it but due to the fullness.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,RoyalT,4.6,"Appearance  This poured an amazing pitch black color with the most beautiful Imperial head that I have ever seen. It literally took 15 minutes to go down. It pitted impressively and left the most detailed lacing on the planet. The head itself was very dark, well beyond tan, and absolutely gorgeous.  Smell  Man, this has it all. The hops come out right away, letting the drinker know that this is a well-balanced IS. The rich espresso bean is top notch, and the chocolate compliment is very exciting. This is not your typical corner store candy chocolate. This is more of your hard to find someplace in the heart of San Francisco type of chocolate. The espresso is very rare as well, making this Victory offering a find indeed.  Taste  Man, is this a big-un! The huge espresso and absence of coffee is very unique. Somebody worked pretty hard to put this brew together. It is extremely rich, and the espresso flavors are underscored with a beautiful vanilla and oak tinge as well as a monster sugar profile that only the Gods could love. This is quality at its finest.  Mouthfeel  Close to full-bodied in the mouth and very chewy. This one was very quenching and dry yet enticing and cloying. Absolutely no sense whatsoever of the high ABV.  Drinkability  Can I drink one SKS every night for the rest of my life and not be too offending to other BAs? This stuff was awesome and definitely lives up to the hype.  Comments  I did a trade with OldFrothingSlosh and this was just one of several beers that he sent me. I couldnt believe the exclusive Top 50 membership included in this swap. Big, huge, thanks to a true BA who filled my coffers (and cellars) with some of the best beer on the planet.  PS: This marked my 500th review, and I was glad to share it with the BA community via a beer provided to me by a wonderful standard-bearer of the site. Cheers & Beers!  Update  As I am now well past my 1,000th review and over a year has passed since I rated The King, I thought Id give it another thoughtful taste.  It is still one of the most drinkable big beers on the planet, and its balance is impeccable. Although Ive had other stouts that have caused me to rethink my idea of full-bodied (Id say this is definitely not full-bodied now) Im raising the Drinkability rating by 0.5 and officially calling this one of my favorite beers of all time.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Ieatlambfries,4.73,"The last batch I drank was bottled on Oct. 23 2003. Strangely enough it seemed *slightly* different from the first which was bottled on Oct. 7th 2003. But maybe it's just me.  Onward, in both batches the color was super opaque, almost black. If held up to light in a pilsner glass you can see the slightest tint of red where the bottom of the glass graduates. The head in my first batch seemed to form thicker, about 3/4 of an inch. The second batch about 1/2 inch. Both were a nice tan color and dissipated quickly.The smell was like roasted caramel and espresso, slight hint of chocolate. I didn't detect any hints of fruit. Mouth feel was excellent the first batch but (and it's most likely just me) seemed thinner the second time around. As to taste, amazing, both batch's. Roasted malt, espresso, chocolate, actually more like chocolate coated raison, notes. Some hoppiness also. Very satisfying, each sip is like letting a piece of fine dark chocolate melt in your mouth. Very drinkable, the only things holding me back are the 9.5 abv and the richness of it. To drink more than a few would be like trying to eat a tub of chocolate mousse.  An amazing experience to say the least.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,AtLagerHeads,4.87,"Every bit as good as on tap, the Victory Storm King is truly a king of beers. The dark rich body and nice beige head seem pefectly suited to the superior lacing job it does. Lots of rich aromas of toasted goodness, the taste that follows is full of chocolate and coffee. A truly superior hop finish makes this one of the truly great beers of America.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,FranklinPCombs,4.37,"Pours an engine oil black out of the bottle. No light penetrates this liquid, save for the slightest red tint around the edges. There is a marginal tan head that recedes into a ring of foam with patches of bubbles lingering for a while. The smell of this brew is incredible. It hits you with a thick meaty smell, with a sharp twinge of hops behind, smoothed out by a backdrop of malt. Some raisiny fruit smells are hidden behind. The taste is nearly as impressive as the smell. It is a surprisingly sharp taste of hops and definaly a typical coffee flavor evident of its style. Earthy tones of burnt and soil hint themselves through the taste as it mellows out into a slow meaty malt taste. At 9.5% ABV, this brew will certainly at least make you think that you;re warmer on a cold winter evening.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,CRJMellor,4,"Poured absolue jet black, my wife called it a black hole. When agitated produced a frothy light tan colored head. Aroma was very surprisingly dominated by resiny hop notes. Almost an IPA hop profile to my novice nose. Also got wonderful chocolate and roasted barly aromas. Taste was very milk chocolately with a very bitter end. Really unique profile for me. Very roasted flavors yet really almost sweet on the front end. Hop fairly really is aggressive but then dominated on the back by heavy roasted coffee flavors. This is the first beer in a long time that I got three disticnt flavor profiles from. A good beer to me produces at least 2 distinct points of taste, great beers produce 3 or more. This beer is great, but unless you are prepared and appreciate maybe more than one, I think you might not get the full flavor profile and all the uniqueness of this beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,bditty187,4.68,"Absolute blackness, there is no hue to it, opaque and dense. The brunette head reached a quick finger in height before shrinking to a loose soapy collar, which clung well. As I quaffed it slowly it laced decently. Magnificent looking, if for no other reason that the black body it possesses. A shallow whiff produced a pleasant roasted maltiness, I knew there had to be more, I went in for seconds, this time I noticed strong piney hops behind the malts. Imperial Stout no doubt, Americanized as well. The potency was strong enough to be tempting, so why wait to sip? The palate on Storm King surprised me, I wasnt expected such a well-blended beverage. The roasted malts were far deeper and long lasted that I anticipated and when the hops were introduced to the tongue there wasnt this epic battle for bragging right, but a sensuous dance that awoken my tastebuds. The roasted malts, with its own coffee-like bitterness, led the tango but the piney, bitter hops had its own moves. It was scrumptious and magical with an aftertaste of complex maltiness with a splash of hoppy bitterness that seamlessly allowed for a smidge of alcohol to round off the ale. Ive witnessed Storm King reign on BA for over a year and now that Ive finally tried it, thanks to sulldaddy, I understand why. The taste is aggressive and welcoming, powerful and yielding, stylish and blunt. I am impressed. Full bodied, thick in fact, with moderate carbonation. The mouthfeel is dead-on and truly lovely. Im not gushing folks, this beer is awesome and I hate every one of you who can drink this on a regular basis. No seriously, I do. It is going to be very difficult to cellar the other two bottles, thanks again sulldaddy you made my day!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,counselor,4.5,"This was a beer I had been looking forward to and it lived up to my expectations. The bottle poured an an espresso coffee color with a nice sand colored head that thinned out quickly due to the ABV content. The nose was of chestnuts, coffe and aged cigar tobacco with a hint of alcohol on the back end. the beer tasted as deep and dangerous as it looked and smelled with rich raisiney flavors almost like a super mince meat pie. After swallowing though the hops came forth drying the mouth all around the gums, making me want for another sip; but first, the alcohol kicked in - just a little to remind me what a whopper of a beer I was drinking - and then just when I was ready to go back I am hit again with the the tobacco and roasted malt flavors.  When I finished the glass, I was happy that the beer lived up to my expectations and look forwrd ot the next bottle. I don't think I could throw back more than 2 of these at a sitting, but it was a blast to throw back after as a late nite reward for decorating the Christmas tree.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,rajendra82,4.38,"Pours an inky dark black with brown highlights, with a khaki head that disappears pretty quickly. The remaining carbonation has a hard time working it's way through the syrupy thick body. The first whiff is that of dark chocolate, raisins, and licorice. Further sips reveal hop spiciness, burnt wood like maltyness, and medicinal tasting alcohol. Oily mouthfeel with slick molasses like consistency. Not as much roasted barley taste as I was expecting, but very smooth and relatively easy to drink for such a bold brew. The hight ABV is very deceptvely hidden under there. Thanks Weissenheimer for this wonderful trade.  Update: This is my second bottle of this wonderful beer, which came as a part of the Secret Santa 2005 package from BA Riggsy. The first time I had it, it was an year old sixpack. This time it is fresh. Compared to the review of the aged bottle, this fresh sample poured a lot more foamy, and had a leafy hop presence that dwarfed eveything else. Felt more like I was drinking a union of a DIPA and an RIS. Teeth coating bitterness, over the top roastiness, and fantastic citric notes made this one of the most drinkable Impreial Stouts to have sampled. Oh how I wish I had more.  Update:  Sweetwater Happy Ending was released in 12 oz. bottles a little while back, and since Victory Storm King Stout of the same age just showed up in Georgia, I decided to do a side by side. I was expecting the Storm King Stout to easily surpass the Happy Ending, but I found the end products much closer than I initially anticipated. The Storm King was clearly the better looking beer of the two, as the head on it was larger, and the color was solid back when compared to the shades of brown in Happy Ending. The smell of the beers was different, but none was better than the other. The Happy Ending was sweet with a lot of chocolate notes, while the Storm King Stout was roasted and hoppy. The taste of the Happy Ending was sweet, soft, and full of chocolate, while the Storm King Stout was much more bittersweet, and had a citric tang of hops to it. Happy Ending didn't have the thickness in the mouth to justify a RIS style label, while Storm King Stout was just thick and creamy enough to squeak by. Both were easy enough top drink, but Storm King Stout was clearly the more complex beer of the two. I think a comparison of a few aged bottles is needed to see how things change over time.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,GCBrewingCo,3.95,"This beer is motor oil black and poured with a brown persistent head that fell very slowly and laced the glass. The aromas are fruit, chocolate, coffee and hops. Dark roasted malt aromas lurk in the background. The flavor is bitter and hoppy. Some chocolate, some coffee, most flavors overshadowed by American hop bitterness and flavor. The finish is hoppy and coffee/chocolate. The body is good, but a little less than expected.  The flavor is hoppy, but not what I would call complex perhaps it was sampled too young. The bottle I have says bottled on 10/9/03 and 9.1% ABV.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,NearerMyBeerToMe,4.15,"Pours thick and gooey, completely opaque, black as india ink. Forms a dense, clumpy head with muddy-colored bubbles of varying size that almost seem to roil around, crackling audibly! Head dissipates slowly and clings well as it dries out into crusts of bubbles. Huge aroma: burnt malt and toffee up front, then BIG roasty bread crusts, smoldering wood. Waxing poetic: piles of autumn leaves and timber, huge dryness and dusty yeast, then a big, thumping belt of hops. Flavors everywhere: raisin skins, extremely bitter chocolate in front palate, and then... BIG bitter wall of hop flavor bowls through a wall of malt and mingles with tobacco, leather, peat. Even through a smooth, glowing alcohol finish, something of a plummy, curranty sweetness... Mouthfeel: did I mention that this beer is BIG? Slick, oily and with a stickiness that lasts for minutes. Alcohol warms and puckers inside of mouth with an astringent finish. This beer needs to be savored and digested. Let it slowly coat your insides. Perfect when matched with dark chocolate, nuts, and caramel. A rollicking bruiser of a beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,benmiliron,4.78,"Had it not been for this website, I might never have tried this stout. It's on one of the side shelves at my local beer vendor and I had to look to find it.  Cappucino colored head, very hop fragrant - lovely. Excellent mouthfeel, rolls over the tongue. Bitterness is balanced well by by sweet malt. 9.1 ABV not noticeable as expected, though I did start this one cold out of the fridge. American hops support the malt, but don't take a starring role (as it should be.) Opaque black, jet black. This heavy stout is not at all sticky. Drier as it warms, and more bitter.  This stout is nearly flawless. Well done victory!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,jahred,3.91,"I was quite excited to try this after the excellent reviews... Pours incredibly, incredibly thick, with a very dark black color. Wow. My girlfriend, who doesn't drink beer, said ""Holy crap, that's dark!"" as I was pouring. That alone was impressive to me (hence the 5 for appearance).  A very thin, but pretty head, that soon disappeared for the most part, leaving a very nice lace on the glass.  Smells strongly of burnt malt and hops. Tastes of burnt wood and thick malt and hops, with a burnt malt/chalky aftertaste. I occasionally caught hints of chocolate and coffee, but not to the extent that I hoped for.  The alcohol was hidden quite well, so I decided to try another one. Maybe it was the hidden alcohol working its way thru my system, but I definitely enjoyed the second Storm King a bit more, and caught more of the chocolate/espresso flavors I was so hoping for.  Good, but not as fantastic as hyped.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Rastacouere,4.32,"This pours black with a ruby reflect like a owl's pupil when he anticipates bleeding his prey. The head is tan, short-lasting. Aroma is deep spicy hops with obvious molasses notes as well as rich dark chocolate, this is gonna be good. Mouthfeel is very thick, oily yet velvety. This is one complex beer. Hops are prevalent and delicious, but there's a definite malty couterpart with peaks of chocolate, molasses, coffee and a perfectly balanced roastiness. The finish is hoppy and dry without being overpowered on the bitterness aspect. Big beer, fully deserved success and reputation, well-hidden alcohol. Worth the hype. Cheers Egajdzis!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Hobbz,4.37,"Huge, thick aroma to match its thickness in the glass. The foam action formed from the pour quickly diminished but the appearance was superb for this imperial stout. The smell did not offer a big, robust burnt (roasted barley) smell, yet was a complex amalgam of sweet (malt & fruity like alcohol-marinated raisins), chocolate, hoppy alcohol. Taste also showed not immense roastiness, but rather more of a toasted malt background against the ""imperial"" sweetness, but with notable hop-bitterness too. A very warming glass full.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,ChrisBowers,4.63,"Wonder what everyone's talking about? Then go get one. Or ten. This is an amazing brew from the boys at Victory. Most recently had it on tap at their brew-house. Pours with a great caramel colored head and a nearly opaque body. Smells of chocolate, espresso... Taste is amazing for an american brewed beer of this high ABV. Alcohol is balanced beautifuly. There's just that hint at the end reminding you it is there. But it takes nothing away from the rich flavor of roasted hops, coffee and chocolate. Damn this is good stuff!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,86MonteSS,4.6,"Of the imperial stouts I've had, this one's the hoppiest. I had this beer at my first genuine ""beer tasting"" and as such it's pretty hard to believe that I'm once again drinking one of the world's best brews as I write this. Storm King is a good God damn beer, but I don't believe it's the best Imperial out there. It's not at the very top of my list but it is pretty close.  Negativity aside, Storm King is easily one of the boldest beers I've had to date. It's definitely not for those who want a malty, mellow stout. The aftertaste fights like a branch davidian to stay in your mouth, while, to the tongue, it is bitter and tart in the greatest possible way. While Stone and Rasputin may surpass Storm King in the Imperial Stout arena, I'm just glad enough that I can get this stuff for a decent price whenever I want.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,marburg,4.62,"How remarkable -- a beer that actually stands up to (and surpasses?) all the hype that it's afforded.  Aromatic complexities that boggle the mind. The musty comfort of a wet, day old sponge underlies dark chocolate, raisinets, and toasted crackers. A distinctly flame-kissed fragrance hints at the impending roasted bitterness.  And it arrives in glorious fashion. Heavy molasses cookies meets flambéed cascades. Finishes with a swirling roasted bitterness that leaves a lingering astringency reminiscent of chewing on wood and an aftertaste that just won't quit.  I could have had 3 of these. How is that possible?  So, so good.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Like something a candy maker would experience. A chocolate malt comes to mind.  The smell is likewise thick and chewy. Some alcohol content here but not overpowering. Again, more hints of chocolate.  Taste...Heavy chocolate with coffee malts. Quite desert-like. A bit of wood as well. Very nice.  This is an amazing bier. My head is swimming with ideas for deserts. I want to concentrate this and use it in a variety of tortes and cakes. Ice cream is also coming to mind here. Mmmm.

The aroma is of hops, roasted nuts, malts, chocolate, coffee - great aroma - very complex too. The flavor was extremely smooth conisidering the syrup-like pour. Very very smooth. Tasted of a mixture between dark chocolate and roasted malts with some hints of coffee, molasses. It's a little sweet with hints of alcohol as well and the flavor lingers for a while.

It has a wonderfully strong aroma of malt and a hint of chocolate. A very satisfying aroma to sit down with when there is little to do.  The taste is an outstandingly complex mix of maltiness, smokiness, hops, and fruits with a hint of chocolate as with the aroma. This is maybe the best stout outside of a brew pub that I've ever tasted.  It has a very heady, thick feeling in the mouth that leaves you with a malty feeling. There is a touch of bitterness right at the end that makes it finish more crisply. A thoroughly drinkable stout that is a classic of the genre. It packs an alcoholic punch that kicks in when finishing the beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,moulefrite,4.46,"A gosh darned, damn good beer! Pours jet black and features barely visible little white specks that are like little stars lighting the black night. The head is near perfect-espresso/cream color with the texture of marshmallow fluff! The nose is nice, with a major hop influence, as well as the usual suspects for the style ie. bitter chocolate,coffee etc. The flavor is amazing, and certainly attributed greatly to the skillfull use of hops. The taste is like a tootsie roll sauteed in pine needle oil, (if there is such a thing) or perhaps a chocolate flavored bud from Humbolt county.(not that that means any thing to any body) The mouthfeel is lush, creamy, and the finish is long and wonderfully bitter in a hoppy sort of way.

345,1013,Foxman,4.73,"This beer is where light goes to die. None gets through. You know it's really dark brown, but the absence of light says, ""It's black!"" Soft brown head, not terribly thick, and settles out relatively quickly, but it almost makes you want to pet it, it looks so lush at first.  The hops are there in the aroma, as are the slight coffee and fruits of the malt.  The first taste brings hops to bear, but stops well short of truly bitter, and swings gently into the cherry/coffee bitter-sweetness of the malt, with a trace of chocolate, lingering at the edges of the tongue at the finish, just enough bitterness to keep the balance ideal.  It has body to spare, just short of molasses. It almost seems to lubricate your mouth as it makes it's way stomachward.  You drink one, you want another. Drink another, you want yet one more; it draws you in, like a black hole, and you begin to stretch at the event horizon, time ceasing to matter, because as much as you want that third, or fourth, you have to know that the ABV is lurking at the center of that hole, and it will keep you inside for more hours than you can afford...but if one's demise can taste like this, is it really such a bad way to go?",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Up front, a great velvet smoothness, a bit oily and at the same time dry; some dark chocolate, licorise and definitive hop presence noted in the body. Toasted malt combined with a slight citrus touch, warming detection noted towards the end.

Subtle carbonation, but than again, those tiny bubbles have a lot of work to do to rise through thick thick brew. Grainy, roasty, and scorched organic goodness all come through in the nose. Surprisingly, I picked up on a fair amount of hops, too; something strange, though, maybe Challenger. Black strap molasses meets baker's chocolate with an extreme dosage of dark malts, mixed with a sweetness that plays on the tongue for minutes afterwards. Throw some quality espresso in there, too. I've had a fair share of Imperial Stouts in my day, and there are many variations on the style, but this one's been one of my favorites by a long shot and will be for years to come.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Pours a very very dark brown, just a shade short of black, virtually impossible to get any light through. Nice tan head, with some lacing. Smells of hops, chocolate, roasted nuts, espresso. Nice hit of hops up front with a very roasted malty backbone. Bitter chocolate and espresso fill in nicely. Alcohol warms the body nicely, though it's hidden well in the flavor profile. You can definately feel it. Nice full bodied mouthfeel. Very rich and creamy. This is definately something that I am going to have to find, which means I'll probably have to mail order a case.

I think I understand what the brewmaster was trying to achieve...and he/she succeeded! (My 120-lb. wife liked it a lot.) Loaded with extract and perfumed with sticky, twiggy greens, there is still plenty of room for the kahlua liqueur flavors to stretch out.

345,1013,Stopper,4.75,"This is black as night -- so opaque that I can't even catch highlights on the edges. The head is somewhat thin, dark tan, with hints of ruby, and sticky with a mix of large and small bubbles. A giant roasted espresso-like aroma billows from my glass, but doesn't quite mask the generous, remarkably-fresh hop nose. The mouthfeel is thick and smooth with a nice effervescence -- spectacularly creamy for a beer from a standard bottle. Initially, the taste feels surprisingly balanced toward a cistrusy hop bitterness, but this blends nicely into the malt creaminess. A pronounced dark-roasted malt bitterness then presents itself as a hop brightness shines through on the palate. It finishes not too dry in its this joined bitterness, trailing off with notes of espresso and very fresh citrusy hops.  I had this once before I started revewing beers and deliberately tasting. I didn't remember it being quite so exceptional. It's really amazing how such a bright, fresh hop quality is apparent throughout this big beer. The roast malts are very apparent, but blend well into the beer's gestalt and are not astringent or overly dry. To top it off, it's amazingly easy-drinking for such a huge and flavorful beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

It looked extremly ominous and syrupy, one of my roommates refered to it as Guiness on steroids. Storm King smells of roasted espresso beans and unrefined chocolate. The taste: Think and creamy with the prevelent flavor of the espresson and a slight bitterness that finishes every sip. Overall the finest beer I have ever tasted.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,andyj,4.57,"The aroma of this one hit me right away. The bitter roasted smell was pleasure to my nostrils. The appearance is an opague black and the head has a dark-ish brownish sort of tinge to it. The taste is just amazing. Imperial Stout all the way. There is a hefty amount of sweetness to this beer, so it is by no means a dry stout. In fact I picked up an interesting hint of mint in the taste. Just a hint, by no means an overpowering flavor. My assumption is that this minty taste is derived from the use of black roasted barley of some variety -- the flavor being a wonderful hint of bitterness from a very dark or black malt. My biggest complaint about this beer is that it is hard to find where I live.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Pours a thick black with a medium-sized brown head. Good lacing on the glass too. Smells of whiskey-soaked fruitcake, raisins, soy sauce, roasted mocha coffee, and alcohol. The taste is WOW. Rich, oaky, malty sweetness with plums, overripe bananas, chocolated, all tempered by a rush of bitter dark chocolate hops. Finish is roasty, bitter, with lingering sweetness and warming alcohol.

345,1013,byrd,4.7,"Bottled and sampled in 2003 - It takes a fairly aggressive pour to create medium sized frothy tan head, but once its there, its not going anywhere soon. The lace is sticky, and holds on to the sides of the glass all the way until the end. The color is pitch black and cannot be seen through at all. However, lots of tiny white floaties can be seen through out the brew, slowly making their way to the bottom of the glass. The aroma is not very strong, but roasted malts with hints of coffee and a slight fruitiness is apparent. The mouthfeel is wonderfully smooth, creamy, and full. Theres a moderate carbonation that gives a slight fluffy mouthfeel. The flavor profile is bliss - sweet rich molasses, chocolate notes, and maybe a touch of currant fruitiness. The finish is lots of hops and coffee flavored bitterness. The bitterness along with lots of roasted notes linger unabated until the next sip. I doubt anything can be said about this brew that hasnt already been said. Wonderfully balanced  the bitterness is never overdone, and the sweetness is never cloying. Its simply an amazingly wonderful imperial stout that cannot be any more drinkable. One six pack was most certainly not enough!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,irishmoss,4.58,"Bottled Jan 28th, 2003 Poured the jet black color that you expect it to with a two finger dirty capachino head. As I drank it, it left the sweetest long laceing down the sides of the glass. The aroma was the usuall coffee & chocolate, but there was a roasted earthy hint with a touch of alcohol. The mouthfill was nice and smooth, but not as thick or viscous as Stone Imperial. The taste was roasted and almost burnt or bitter chocolate. Great hop presence that I thought may have matured a little better. I love the warmth from the alcohol presence, but it's not too much or over powering. Very drinkable, with a nice clean dry finish. Great stout....one of the best.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,bmills1608,4.27,"First let me say, stout, generally speaking, is at the lower end of my preference scale, and imperials, even a bit lower. (""What!"", ""Hmmpf"" ""Errrr"" = Sounds of beer geeks getting their panties all bunched up for 2 reasons. 1) True beer geeks l-o-v-e stouts 2) ""If you don't like the style don't drink it or review it its not fair, boo hoo hoo!""). Geeks...shut the hell up.  That being said, Storm king is.... pretty....damn...good.  Poured from a 12 oz bottle jet black with a small filthy looking tan head. On the nose was all of your usual suspects - coffee, molasses, figs and raisins and a some nice herbal hop aroma. Lots of nice fruit as well. Taste was very rich, creamy and mouth-filling. Quite heavy dark malt, pumpernickel bread, tons of ale fruit esters, moderate roasted flavor and a huge kick of burnt brown sugar. Keeping all of this monster malt sweetness under control was a healthy dose of hop bitterness that really cut the malt sweetness perfectly, creating a very balanced imperial stout. At almost 10% alcohol, this boy was still very drinkable and smooth. Victory shows time and again why they are considered a top 5 craft brewery. Awesome stuff.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,DagFishHead,4.5,"After being somewhat disappointed in this beer in bottle form, I had a chance to review it again on tap (same fall 2003 version). Appearance: Tightly-bubbled, whipped-creamy dark-tan head. Fades to cloudlike whisps floating in a jet black sea. Super retention and lace. Nose was much more balanced than bottled version IMO. Both smoked and sweet malt character, ripe fruit tones. Alcohol remains subdued. Taste: Great balance between hops, malt, and alcohol warmth. Malt/plum/prune sweetness followed by a semi-dry, bitter hop finale. Mouthfeel: Full and rich, smooth/sweet silkiness. Drinkability: Flavors much better blended than bottled version. Highly enjoyable... a growler of this is definitely in my future.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Burnt malt flavor that is extremely rounded, bit reminds you of it high abv. Pleasant ""afterbite"" on the palate. A definite warmer....with a mouthfeel that is extremely surprising for such a high abv...very smooth.

345,1013,leeenglewood,4.5,Pours jet black with a creamy head that sticks around to the last drop. Smells of slightly alcoholic with a plumy raisiny/ bruised fruit coming out. Tastes initially of roasted sweet caramel malts then you are bombasted with a slightly fruity overtone that finally bellows out to roasted malt choclately flavored aftertaste. Kind of like eating a good cordial chocolate. Body and mouthful is thick and creamy unlike other beers of this abv makes an extremely drinkable beer pending your tolerance.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,dpend,4.13,"Since Victory is legally unavailable in Florida I have always been anxious to try their products. Although this seems to be a unique interpretation of an Imperial Stout, it's an excellent brew. Deep, rich color and smell and very drinkable for the style, but a nicely balanced mouthfeel. If you can get your hands on this definitely try it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Poured a dark black with a tan head. It tasted of raisins an plums actually. It did have a VERY profound hops taste. I am a hophead so I didn't mind, but others might.

345,1013,Stubbie1,4.6,"Bottled Oct 2003  As it has been said many times, this beer pours a deep dark black with a dark tan head. The head stays a good amount of time and fades to a very thin lace. The nose is dark roasted with a nice amount of hops mixed in. The taste is a dead match for the aroma. This is a real nice brew and very easy to drink. A MUST for all try!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Gueuzedude,4.65,"Vintage Bottled 04 of November 2003, Sampled February 2004 Pours a pitch black color, and with a thick creamy brown head. Dark fruit, roasted malt, coffee aromas waft from my glass. The roasted characteristics are not overwhelming in any way though, seem to be well in balance. A thick creamy mouth feel to this beer. Definitely reminiscent of a rich coffee concoction, perhaps with a bit of chocolate in it too. It is quite interesting how the flavor hops contribute to a beer when it is so thick & dark. In a lighter beer you would be able to detect the over the top hops immediately, here they just seem to add another dimension to the beer. The hops help to soften the effects of the roasted malts and they help to boost the perception of a dark fruitiness, They also add a citrusy tingling sensation to the tongue. This beer is so well integrated I cannot imagine how it will get any better with age, but I do have a 6'er which I plan on aging to see how this changes. I do still love the fact that this beer is not too heavy, for an Imp-Stout it is nice, light, and easy sipping (note that it is still quite the sipping brew though).  Bottled Oct 15, 2002. Sampled October 27, 2003 This beer is a deep black color, when held up to the light it is seen to be quite clear. When roused a thick dark brown head appears. Notes of burnt raisin waft from the glass. Roasted malt is quite evident in the nose as well. The taste is very good, it is all over the place, not one dimensional at all. Not over the top in its roast character (like some Imp-Stouts), this is wonderful as it allows lots of the other flavors to come through. There are notes of a rich port, and a slight bit of sherry in the finish. The Storm King is fairly light bodied for this style of beer. It is fruity tasting, which is accentuated by the hop flavor that has been put into this beer. Quite novel to me to pack an Imperial-Stout with flavor hop additions, I really like this idea, especially in this relatively 'light' bodied example. One could easily drink a couple of pints of this, and regret it later. The more I drink the more I like this beer, I wish that I had more. I can't wait to get a fresh sample of this beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,hotstuff,3.04,"When poured, this beer had a small sized light brown head with fine-medium sized bubbles that mostly diminished. The body was uncarbonated, opaque and it had a dark hue to it. The nose was malty, chocolate, and some coffee notes. The flavor was bitter, hoppy, coffee notes, acidic and it left a lingering aftertaste. The mouthfee was tingly, smooth, thin textured and medium bodied. This beer left a fair amount of lacing on the sides of my glass. Nothing to really rave about with this beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Scooter77,5,"Upon the first drink of this delectable brew, there was only one phrase that came to my mindYabba-Dabba-Doo, Yoo-Hoo, Scooby Doo! This is one absolutely amazing beer. It pours a thick, black color topped off by a fluffy tan, almost brown head. For an Imperial Stout, the head retention was very impressive. It faded down slowly and remained fully intact until the last drink. The aromas of sweet malts and dark roasted coffee beans forces its way straight up your nose directly into your brainI have honestly never smelled something all the way up in my brain! It was amazing! The alcohol was totally masked by that sweet, sweet aroma. Then came the tastingahh, theres that masked alcohol forcing itself on the taste buds. The sweet, maltiness of the aroma represents itself very well in the taste. I also detected a hint of nuttiness in the finish. This brew is exceptionally balance, very smooth and easy to drink. I think I could drink this all day and night, or at least until the 9.1% ABV knocks me on my ass. This is the only beer that I have every given a total rating of 5 on and it is very well deserved. I cant wait to taste this one in a few months after it ages for a while.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

What an impressive beer - very balanced both at the front and back of the palate. The bitterness is toned by the aging a bit to give a rich smooth taste, along with tasty finish. With all the hype surrounding Victory at this and other websites, it's easy to forget they can deliver the goods to back up the rep.

However, by comparison when it cam out last year (according to my notes) I think giving this batch some time we'll se it eclipse the overall rating! The Alpine Hops used are at this time overwhelming - however given some time (Mid to lat winter) I think it will mellow out. I'm a big ""King"" Fan and have bottled examples going back several years and I also happen to live about 10 minutes away from Victory.

345,1013,gueuzeonhigh,4.38,"When I think of Imperial Stout I imagine a bear- a great Russian bear -- the kind the old Soviet propaganda ministry would have conjured in hopes of striking fear in the heart of every westerner...  The entire persona of Victory Brewings Imperial Stout is no propaganda exercise. From the moment I pour this glorious libation into my glass, until Ive imbibed the last drop-- this stout delivers on its name-- truly imperial...  The instant this stout leaves the bottle it produces a marvelous presentation-- dark color, heavy body. It cascades into my glass and wells up into a marvelous dense dark foamy head that laces the sides of my glass with abandon.  The nose presents the beers calling card- more of everything --- hops, malt, bitter and alcohol.. I detect the definite presence of alcohol-- more than usual and no surprise for an imperial stout.  Color is a dark chocolate brown that seems to yield secrets of reddish brown only to intense light rays.  When the first sip coats my taste buds, this beer could bear no other moniker than Imperial Stout. The signature of toasted malt, bursts forth onto the scene, followed on its heels by a rush of bitterness-- not overwhelming-- to be once again, overtaken by the sweet pangs of the toasted malt. All this encompassed by the presence of a dry shroud produced no doubt by the elevated alcohol content.  The body is appropriately heavy, and the flavor finish keeps tantalizing my palate long after Ive emptied my glass.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Tiny tan colored bubbles swirling up to the top looked great. Head settles down but looks as if it has some retention power. Aroma is a sweet, chocolatey espresso roasted malt concoction, and everything an Imperial should be. Has a nice smooth mouthfeel and a full body. Flavor is of coffee, and sweet roasted malt with caramel showing up in the finish. Alcohol is as well hidden as I've seen for this style. Retention is good as expected.

The scents are weak. Some mustiness and dried coffee. A tiny bit of moss and a flour smell. Nothing special.  The flavors are big and bold. Strong tobacco flavors. Heavy dark coffee with chocolate covered berries. With this stout one flavor starts and another finishes it off. Bold malts and molassas. A quick bitter currant and a dry alcohol flavor come through in the finish. A nice dry aftertaste.  The mouthfeel is heavy and strong. Alcohol stabs here and there at the mouth.

345,1013,ithacabaron,4.31,"The Storm King arrives like a thunderstorm.  When first poured, a hop bouquet reaches the nose, and, together with some more dark, bittered notes, it smells like a standard Victory hop offering (which, don't get me wrong, is always right on the money, and a beautiful thing).  The first sip, smooth as silk, hits you like a crash of lightning. Boom! A dark baking chocolate bitterness hits you, followed by notes of the same chocolate, melted, covering over plums and sweet cherries. In time, but a long time, as this beer luxuriates on your tongue, the clouds pass, and at the end of the sip you are beckoned to bring on another maelstrom.  This was the beer that truly set me on the path to Beer Advocacy, and so, I am very thankful that it exists -- and at 30 dollars a case in Philadelphia, I always get one of this and the Hop Devil when I'm in town.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Served from a 12 oz. bottle, bottled in January, drank late august, excellent integrity. Poured from the bottle black as tar, with a nice dark brown head that faded relatively quickly for an imperial. Aroma is roasty and burnt coffee, maybe a little anise. This stout tastes very bold at first and mellows nicely as the glass warms a bit. Alcohol presence is fairly subdued, but slightly warming as it goes down. At first I taste the strong coffee flavor right away, but it's backed up with some serious hop bitterness that stays with you the whole way. Balances out a little with notes of chocolate and caramel.

345,1013,Globetrotter,4.92,"Oh. Ooh! Oh, yes. Oooh, Yes! Yes! Yes! YES! YES! YES! Aaah! Whew! Mmmmmm!  Brought to Moscow by friends from Northern Virginia, my precious bottle was filled on 1/28/03, and emptied on 8/16/03. The label calls this an Imperial Stout. Supposedly, imperial stouts were first developed in Russia for the Czar's court. I guess the commies ditched the style when they ditched the Czar. I sure haven't found anything in Russia that comes close to this masterpiece.  Pours black as coal, with a thin dark, almost amber colored head. This head faded too quickly, however, causing me to mark down the appearance. There was no lace on my glass. The nose was big with caramel and malt, but relatively subdued when cold. It grew, ever so subtlely as the brew warmed in the glass, until it was bold and assertive like few brews anywhere. The mouth was, in my view, too bubbly for the style, hence the other markdown in my review. It was heavy with roasted sweetness, though - very nice.  Then there's the taste. My goodness! Sweet and malty to start, with hints of chocolate, coffee, and plumbs. There is also hops from the start, getting stronger as the liquid and the tongue indulge in a mutually passionate embrace. The finish is thus bitter and flowery and smooth, with some lingering caramel and roasted chestnuts. The aftertaste is sweet, bitter and roasty all at once. Not only the nose, but also the taste get even better (although less sweet) as the brew warms, so don't be in a hurry to drink this one. Savor it. Enjoy it. Relish it.

This is a jewel of a treat for ""firkin Friday"" in the middle of the summer. It was brewed in March 2003.  It's appearance was black as nite with a creamy mocha head. Everything, including the aroma, the taste and presence of alcohol were subdued. Just a perfect balance of hops and malt were present as the initial liquid black gold tantilized the palate. There was this overwhelming combination of chocolate, coffee, mocha, dates and rasions that were present from start to finish. The complexity of this brew was simplified into very incredible level of smooth, silky heaven. It's truly hard to capture and describe something so delicate and delicious.  If SK from the bottle, draft or cask is considered No. 1 on the BA website, I would suggest an aged-version SK from the firkin has to be No. 1 in the world.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Poured a pitch black with a big, frothy caramel colored head. The head faded in about two minutes to a thin, bubbly covering. With a quick swirl or through drinking this stout leaves rings of lacing that don't seemd to want to cling to the glass.  Aromas of bitter coffee, malt, toffee, earth, and hops rise from the glass like the bird on the bottle.  The first texture is creamy and full bodied on your tongue. It is quickly followed with toffee flavors, then bitter coffee, caramel, malt, and a slight hop bite at the end to wash away any hints of sweetness. Finishes clean and dry, but leaves the mouth watering for more. There is little to know taste of alcohol and with the exception of the label there is little to indicate it's 9.1% ABV.

Very complex array of aromas.  Taste: roasted malt followed by espresso (mmm...coffee!) to start. Dried fruits (raisins, dates) also present as is a hint of grassiness and an agreeable amount of hops bitterness which kick in at the finish. Alcohol kind of grabs the back of the palate. Again, very complex.  Feel: full-bodied, kind of chewy. Drier than anticipated.  Drinkability: high % ABV makes this a ""one per"" beer.

345,1013,moon0,4.5,"Pours thick like motor oil. Lightly carbonated with a little lacework. Black as onyx. Sweetish aroma. Chocolate, roast, licorise flavors. You can taste and then feel the alcohol. Finishes with a crazy bitterness that lingers in my mouth. Very nice indeed, a multidimensional treat. I usually go to IPAs for my hop fix but this will do just fine, thanks.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,dvorsd,4.61,"First off, this has to be one of the best stouts I have ever tasted. My mouth starts watering the more that I think about it.  Right from the pour I knew I was in for a treat. The stuff came out black as midnight and looking thick as motor oil. (Bear with me, in my mind that can be a good thing) There were a good couple of inches worth of tan head at the top of the glass that just did not want to go away. It just does not look any better then that in my book.  Well, so far, so good time for that first sip  Man, it hits you hard right away. The brew has big, big taste to it; very thick with a complete tug of war going on between the sweet and bitter flavors within. Id love to see the reaction upon trying this of some of my friends who think that Guinness is a heavy beer. Storm King feels nice and viscous in my mouth with undertones of dark coffee and chocolate. This would be a great beer to warm you up on a cold night.  If you are a stout fan this beer is well worth seeking out. In my mind the Storm King has earned the crown.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,BrewDoctor,4.8,"I'm proud to make Victory Storm King my first official beer review. Ironically, I drove through a vicious lightening storm and mild flooding to buy this 6 pack. After drinking this brew, I would weather a tornado for another pint.  This beer pours rich and dark with a medium head characterized by chocolate and coffee highlights. Hops immediately hits the nose followed by a subtle hint of coffee maltiness.  The first taste is like an explosion in your mouth - complex and as original as an imperial stout can be. The spicy hop flavor excites the tongue and mellows with a dark malty flavor full of oak, coffee, and chocolate. The finish is smooth and clean with a hint of spice to keep you coming back for more.  An excellent brew that will always be welcome in my mug!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,mike1290,4.48,"Looks like used motor oil in a glass, with a medium sized head. Hoppy, chocolate aroma followed by clean smooth flavor. Medium to thin consistency. No bitter aftertaste, but takes a sip or two to acclimate to the brew, but then it's excellent. Definitely one of the best!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Stingray5,4.78,"12oz bottled on Jan 28 2003.  Pours black with a foamy, dark tan head. Aroma is surprisingly hoppy with coffee and chocolate undertones. Huge, bold mouthful. Taste is toasty chocolate malt and fruit, followed by a strong hop bitterness and just a hint of alcohol. Finish is dry and hoppy.  This brew had a much stronger hop presence than I'd expected. Luckily I'm a hop-head. This one's a winner. The label on the neck of the bottle reads ""Victory - For Your Taste"", and I wholeheartedly agree. One of the best beers I've ever had. Get some now.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,BittRnessabounds,4.87,"Wow. This is easily the best beer I've ever had. I love stouts and I love hops....therefore it makes sense that I love this Beer. There is probably no praise I can give this beer that has not been given before. Everything is perfection, or very near perfection. The near pitch black color, with the warm light brown abundant head call you forth to enjoy the warm smell of roasted malt, chocolate, caramel and hops. The taste is so complex and amazing i won't even attempt to write about it. I don't know how this beer has 9.1abv, I never got a sense of it, and if i had more than one i would have gladly consumed as many as possible.  Quite simply if you have not had this beer, go find it, and you too will fall in love with it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,AudioGilz,4.88,"Bottled on Oct. 15th, 2002. It pours like black syrup or motor oil, 100% opaque with a large creamy tan head that laces wonderfully. The aroma is full of roasted barley and hops. There is definitely a sign of serious hop character in this brew. But before the hops kick in, you're treated to some chocolate, coffee, and just an all around sweet roastiness. And then hops come in for an amazing finish that makes you beg for more. The alcohol is mellow but definitely there throughout consumption. And it's great. Everything about this wonderful stout is gargantuan and robust as hell.....a truly perfectly balanced and drinkably strong stout. As a stout lover, I think this is the perennial fallback imperial, as long as they keep it the way it is.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Boto,4.85,"Pours an almost inky color. It has a small head that is light brown in color. It dissapates quickly. A bit of caramel and coffee to the nose. Very full body to the beer, almost ""thick"". Somewhat roasty, not as much as some others. A hint of sweetness, chocolate and a good hop bite. The alchohol is not evident at all. This is excellent!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,dwarbi,4.68,"Pours a thin, but creamy off-white head. The beer is solid black. The aroma is slighly sweet and a little hoppy. Fantastic taste. Grainy and complex. The alcohol taste lingers a bit, but it's still very drinkable. A tiny bit is lost in the bottle (compared to tap) but it's still an amazing beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,jcalabre,4.5,This full bodied brew w/ its chocolate & espresso flavors is wonderful. It is a well balanced beer. Very enjoyable.

345,1013,budgood1,4.79,"an 01'-02' cellared treat...thanks frank! storm king pours out an opaque midnight black, with a foamy tan head that dies down to clingy lace. definite nose of northwest hops...oh baby i'm getting the chills from just smelling this stuff. aromas of chocolate and caramel maltiness follow...definitely awesome. malted barley flavours such as chocolate, caramel and java hail upon my tastebuds...the thunderous citric northwest hoppy goodness clouds my senses. hops are strong in the profile, and since this one has been aged...i'm assuming fresh storm king must be a bitter tornadic hop monster. the alcohol is next to rain down upon my tastebuds...all this big sensory stimulation rides the lightening right down my throat. silky smooth and utterly drinkable...like a rainbow to the bottom of my stomach. while storm king may leave a trail of destruction in it's path...i found it to rebuild my attitude towards what an imperial stout may represent. brutal in it's severity...but rewarding in it's wake. oh my what a beer! a blizzard of thanks to frank4sail for the sample!!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Realale,4.62,"Opaque black, even when held up to a 150 watt bulb. 1.5 inch rocky dark mocha head slowly settles to a thin incomplete cap of fine foam.  Initial nose is roasty coffee maltiness, with tons of underlying citric fruitiness. As the pint warms, the citric fruitiness develops into more recognizable hop aromas. With more time, the malt and hop integrate better and I pick up candied cherry, raisin, and some rummy notes, even a bit of good bready European licorice.  The hops are definitely up to the malt on the palate providing plenty of both flavor and bitterness to balance the beer. Very long and zingy on the finish. Licking my lips, I can taste the hop oils. It is the hops which really end up being the defining element of the beer for me tonight, which is amazing considering the huge amount of malt in this beer.  Quite a ride, and big thanks to MJR for sharing a bottle of this incredible beer with me.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,beergeek279,4.82,"This beer pours almost as thick as molasses, and just as black. The smell is complex, with a bit of just about everything! If the smell is complex, then the taste is even more so! Hints of hops mix with coffee and malt flavors......simply amazing. Slightly heavy in the mouthfeel department. All in all, I don't think I could drink more than a few of these, but I'd be really happy to try! A classic beer, and more than deserving of the praise it's received.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

By far the most flavorful and life changing stout I've had.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,bewareOFpenguin,4.8,"I was intrigued by the bottle. The simple label, with the bird, was he the storm king? I poured the beer into a glass. It was dark, very dark, with milk chocolate bubbles. My gaze returned to the bottle. The birds eyes were much like the beer, deep, penetrating. I took my first sip. Smooth, robust, coffee, excitement. Yes, excitement, the beer seemed to glide down my throat and nest in my stomach. Maybe this beer was enchanted, transformed from the bird. I would have to ponder this, of course over another Storm King....",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,taez555,5,"I poured this beer, labeled 10/15/02, into a snifter. It poured a dark black body with a beautiful white/tan, almost purplish in the right light, head. It definitely could be mistaken for the foam of a mocha or cappuccino.  The nose to this beer was breathtaking. Hoppy, malty, chocolatly, slight coffee smells. just layer upon layer of aromas.  The initial taste is actually very subdued and mellow. Followed by a rush of intense stout flavors. Waves of chocolate, freshly roasted malts, toffee, subtle coffee, balanced hop bitterness, and even an earthy hop flavor that hints that this beer might be dry hopped.  The flavor takes it time to disappear. It lingers off into an even more impressive finish. This is when a lot of the coffee/espresso flavors come to the forefront and linger.  Overall this beer is quite amazing. It really reminds me of a combination of an imperial stout and barely wine. But, in my opinion, why this beer deserves an all 5 rating, is how perfectly balanced, and well crafted it is. All of the flavors are in your face, but none overpower the others. All of the tastes are so REAL; you can almost taste the coffee, the chocolate, or the roasted barley. Victory has really outdone themselves with this beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Running4beer,4.58,"11/19/02 date code  Pours out black with a thin brown lacey head that stays till the end. Aroma was pretty much non existant, slight espresso and thats all. Taste on the other hand was totally different. Sweet malty taste, dark chocolate, espresso, raisins, some hops and little bitterness and last was the roasted after taste that sneeks up on you not overwhelming at all. Thick molases mouthfeel a slight carbonation on the tongue and a good drinkability. For the content of alcohol its a smooth brew and a lot smoother then most other Imperials that I've had. This is good.  Cheers!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,avylover,4.57,"Just a note: For whatever reason after I poured this i placed the cap back on the beer bottle. About a minute later it jumped off by itself!!! This beer says ""Drink me"". The black hole of beers. No light passes through, and I believe this beer would also make an effective radiation shield. No head to speak of, just a tan ring around the black surface. I smell coffee and fruit, just to name a few. This is one tasty stout!!! Pulls away from any other imperial i've had, this one is much more easy and enjoyable to drink. A nice mix of fruit & burnt malts, with a very tasty chocalate aftertaste that lingers, begging for another sip. Oh yeah, and it's full of hops too! Top notch beer. The best part about this brew is it's not too 'acidic' like many imperial stouts",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,goindownsouth,4.53,"One of the better stouts I have tried in recent memory, but then again, I cannot remember everything.  It pours a deep and pitch-black color. The aroma speaks of the reward to come to the lips and tongue.. raspberry, coffee, mocha, and oh so super smooth. It is sweet and coffee-like with incredible creaminess on the palate. However it offers no unwanted heaviness as some stouts tend to do. If you can find it, it is well, and I mean WELL worth trying.

345,1013,Darkale,4.08,"Thick as oil, dark as a cave at midnight, with a deep, plummy aroma. The head struggles to the top and forms a deep, coffee-with-cream head -- one of the darkest I've ever seen on a stout. Lacing is moderate and spotty.  Important to let this guy warm up. Then you will taste the light, cheery, coffee notes, the spare hops tingle, the complicated interplay of half-defined tastes.  I prefer the Stone Imperial Stout myself, but this is a bruiser in its own right.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,nomad,4.48,"""Bottled on Nov. 19, 2002""  Color was pretty darn black with café au lait colored head that stayed thin with thin bubbles. Had some nice lace that dissipated at a moderate pace. Smelled of an almost soft soapy bitterness, an almost espresso body. In general the nose was very soft and clean.  Flavored with a good hops character that was salty and citrusy but not too strong, the bitterness was delayed and toward the back of things. Some small nutty flavor, but in general the hops were more powerful than the malt here but not as much as, say, Old Rasputin. Had an almost creamy taste, a very smooth low-lactic flavored kind of cream. The mouthfeel was slightly soft and creamy on the tongue. The farther I get into this beer the richer the chocolate malt flavor becomes, every time, as well as major smacks of worn-down grapefruit hop flavors.  In all aspects of the beer this was a soft and drinkable version of an Imperial Stout. Pretty good.  *Much better aged, a couple months later I had a 1997 vintage, and it was much more smoother, well-blended, and its strong points (esp. the espresso-ness) were stronger. Also, much better on draught or cask.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Smells strongly of heavily roasted barley malts, black malts, burntness with sweet BBQ sauce or soy sauce, very dark and earthy and has some coffee, molasses, and licorice notes. The taste is quite good, lots of dark malts, black, chocolate, coffee, molasses with a bittering finish of strong fresh green hops.

345,1013,EmoBeerGuy,4.75,"Okay, here goes my first review!  Had this brew on tap at Monk's in Philly. Being a local they serve this on tap for 2.50, a pitance when compared to the Belgium stuff they've got. And let me tell you, although its a completely different brew than say the Chimay White (I prefered SKS) I had just prior, this beer deserves to be poured with some of the best.  Great head and head retention for a stout. Sharp hoppy nose, like we have come to exspect from storm king. Apperance, black as a moonless night. I described the taste to another patron as imagining the deepest chocolate stout you've ever had and then adding a punchy hop finish to that. He tried one immediately, and I must say that, though my friend had been at Monk's for a few hours by that time, he was immediately impressed. I like this one better on tap than from the bottle though its a beer to get whenever you see it. The pinnacle of the Victory collection and a tribute to American Brewing.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Marty,4.75,"I had tasted this on tap several months ago, but only had a sample-sized half pint. Therefore, I was very excited to have a whole pint of this all to myself.  My Storm King was delivered by the wonderful bartender at Monk's in a tall pint glass. This is one of the darkest stouts I've ever seen. It's pretty much black. Dark black.  For those of you that are fans of the hop, this is the stout for you. There were hints of coffee, chocolate and mystery fruit. This is a very complex beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

345,1013,Morris729,5,"Saved for my 300th Review. Wow. Pours pitch black in color with what appears to be only an average sized tan colored head at first that continues to grow long after youve finished pouring and develops into a mountainous thick and creamy head. Several minutes after the head was fully formed, it still showed almost no signs of receding, and it coats the walls of the glass with heavy sheets of lace as you drink. The presence of hops is very apparent in the aroma along with notes of fresh espresso and chocolate liqueur. Very full-bodied with a thick and creamy mouthfeel. Flavors of roasted malts and bitter-sweet chocolate are present up front followed by notes of buttery toffee, dark coffee, and a bit of liquorish. Some tastes of dark fruits also come along towards the end along with some bitter hop leaf flavors. The bitter hop oils and tannins remain in a lasting aftertaste. Very delicious. An absolutely incredible beer. Thanks to paceyourself for sending me this brew!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,purplehops,4.8,"Reviewed from a growler filled from the tap at the brew-pub.  Storm King poured opaque black with a red-brown head that didn't last long or leave much lacing. The aroma is burnt caramel, chocolate, coffee, and malt with a hint of hop spice. The taste starts with a sudden rush of chocolate tinged with some coffee and toffee flavors. This moves along to flavors of caramel and black malt with hints of roasted barley and hop bitterness. The finish is smooth with molasses and espresso flavors demanding your attention along with supporting roles played by subtle flavors of cardamom and citrus hops. Aftertaste is a lingering malt sweetness balanced with a hop and roasted malt bitterness and the first hints of alcohol. Mouthfeel is smooth with a medium-heavy to syrupy body. This one coats the inside of your mouth with stout happiness. Overall an excellent stout. The tap version seems to have a wee bit less carbonation and a lot more chocolate flavor than the bottle version. Hop flavors seem to be more evident in the tap version also.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,WVbeergeek,4.58,"The Storm King Stout is in one word Black, I am holding this beer up to the light there are no ruby edges to it this beer is opaque no light passes through. To complement the darkness is a lighter tan head and for the alcohol percentage it pours quite nicely here starting to form a collar of lace above the head of the beer. The aroma is filled of hops and a dark roasted fullness of slightly burnt grain. Coffee like in flavor and aroma this beer blends perfectly in the mouth with the high ABV sending ripples through the espresso dark roasted barley with chocolate tones. This beer is amazing, from the appearance right down to drinkability!!!! The mouthfeel is full to medium in body with a creamy overall sensation to it. I could literally drink this stuff all the time, it's addicting!!! On the other hand I would get way to use to a beer that is 9.1% ABV and my palate would be full of dark roasts and unable to sense other flavors.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,longpondbeerman,4.55,"Ok, so this stuff pours as black as india ink. So far, it lives up to its billing. The rather dark chocolate head settles very slowly, and there always remains a nice subtle rim that contrasts nicely to the deep, dark brew, which is about how I'd describe the smell--deep, with not too much overwhelming alcohol in spite of the 9.1% ABV. There is very little carbonation; the feel is soft in the mouth initially, and the immediate taste is understated, but as this stout settled in my mouth, many wonderful and complex tastes emerged. First, I noticed the woodpile taste (I like). Then a subtle mossy after flavor. Through it all, never did I get the sense I was drinking a highly-charged brew. The best thing about this is how much the feel and taste improve with each sip--maybe that's the alcohol content kicking in. A very good stout.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,nklatt,4.56,"Ever since I moved from NM to MN I've been depressed I can no longer (easily) get Rogue's Shakespeare Stout. Well, I've now found a brew that can make it all better.  This one pours with a thick, dark, creamy head that just won't quit. Like a nitro-canned Guiness, it takes a while to settle down because it keeps forming after the pour, trying its best not to dissipate. The smell is unexciting. The taste, however, is fantastic and that's what matters most. Plenty of hops but even more malt. It finishes sweet (but not sickly) and it stays with you for a long while. Mouthfeel could be a little more substantial, but that's me being picky.  I was so excited about this one I had to immediately grab a second bottle. Half way through that I was feeling pretty good and was somewhat surprised to see the 9.1% ABV number on the bottle! Like Duvel, the alcohol is hiding behind the other flavors, not making itself known until you feel its effects. This one is exceptionally easy to drink.  Now I need to get this in the same room with the Rogue and make them duke it out for My Favorite Beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,SamuraiJack,4.58,"The best word to describe this beer is ""intense."" I mean this in the best possible way - as all Imperial Stouts should be intense. The flavours are intense, the experience is intense, the alcohol is intense.... Wow. Initial pour shows a nearly opaque black. Deep black. Total black. The head is thick, firm, tight bubbles, light foam. It's sticky and dark tan, a nice mocha colour even. The beer pours thick and almost chocolate syrup-like. Shockingly, the aroma is not that overwhelming, but rather quite balance and almost (dare I say it) subtle. You can smell the chocolate and the burnt coffee, but under it there is a strong roasted malt foundation and even some nice hoppiness. Initial taste is of a thick, smooth, roasted malty, juicy, dark caramel, burnt espresso, deep, dark chocolate... Oh my. This is a good beer. Unlike many stouts, all this richness and sugar is balanced by a nice hoppy bite reminiscent of grapefruit. As the taste rolls over your tongue, this citric bitterness balances out as a result of a sweet, chocolatey aftertaste with heavy fruit undertones. Running throughout the palate experience is the warmth of the alcohol. Oh yes. The alcohol. This IS an Imperial after all, and it lets you know it. Final taste is of toasted grains and light, fading chocolate. This is the shit. Oh my. If you can find this beer - buy it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,nixhecks,4.41,"After seeing Storm King at #1 I had to go get me some. Although you have to pay an arm and a leg for any of Victory's brews, this one is worth it. While I haven't been a fan of imperials, this stout left me impressed. The beer is as black as they come, with an attractive thick brown head. Aroma was scarce at first but picked up as the beer warmed, mostly roasty dark malts featuring chocolate, licorice, smoke, and coffee aromas - half way I think I even dicovered a strong vanilla presence. The extra alcohol is always welcome, and is blended very well. I could drink this all night, or all day for that matter.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,WaltTrombone,4.36,"The bottle came with ""Bottled on Nov. 11, 02"" on the label. It poured black as a tuxedo in a dark closet. It came topped with a dense, dark-brown head that had a lot of staying power. Dark roasted malt and hops aroma. All sorts of flavors, lots of hops, dark malt, bitter chocolate, Turkish coffee, cherry notes, citrus and alcohol tangs, all fighting the battle for supremacy on my happy tongue. Just like dinner with the Italian side of the family... Thicker mouthfeel than some other stouts I've tried, very luxurious, like rich Corinthian Leather. The finish goes on and on, like bitter chocolate and expresso, and some tanginess in there, too. Wow, this is definitely one of the most complex beers I've ever had! I'm not sure yet if I'm in LOVE with it, but I'm at least in ""Like!""",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,BeerBuilder,4.32,"Pours black with a light brown head. The aroma is of fruity hops, and roasted malts with hints of chocolate. The flavor starts with a fruitiness that flows quickly to a roasty malt flavor. From there this full-bodied beer goes to a dry, hoppy, bitter finish. The bitter finish in this brew is intensified by the burnt malt flavors. It also has an alcoholic flavor in the finish. I really wasn&#8217;t expecting the fruitiness in this beer. Overall a great, complex beer with a plethora of flavors. I would definitely drink this one again. It has a bitterness that sticks with you.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Todd,4.42,"Purchased in a 12oz brown bottle with the bottled on clearly marked on the front of the label -- well done -- Nov 11 02.  Poured an ominous pitch black beer, crowned with a thick mocha foam head; mixed, patchy and sticking. Retention, excellent. Thick and syrupy to the eye.  Quite subdued in the aroma. Notes of citric hops, big eathy nose, some mustiness and a softened roasted grain. Nothing special going on here, and certainly not when compared to the rest of the beer's characteristics.  The mouthfeel hits me upfront. It's thick, viscid, juicy and silky smooth. Malt character is complex with roasted, molasses, coffee, dark chocolate, bitty chicory, tree bark and earth. Sharp-ish hop character breaks through and melds with a roasted astringency. Flashes of citrus rind and a tight carbonation prick at the palate, balancing out the heavy dark malt characters.  There's an interesting fruity sweetness that pulls thru, that of cherries in syrup covered in dark chocolate and an edge of pineapple in the background ... adding even more layers to twist your mind with. Alcohol is warming and complements the citric hop characters with a decent dose of blended spice. Finish is try with roasted notes and grain.  Hell yeah! This is an outstanding stout ... flavourful, powerful and very drinkable for it's high ABV. I'll just leave it at that and recommend that all stout lovers give this beer a try.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,hyuga,4.68,"First of all, a big thanks to fellow BA francisweizen for this sample, my first Victory beer, which I've been looking forward to for ages. This is a beautiful beer, I have to give it a perfect 5 in the looks department. The mocha brown head stays exceptionally and impressively well, which seems to be a tough thing for many imperial stouts to pull off. The aromas I'm getting are delicate, sweet chocolate, smooth and quite creamy mocha, toffee chips, and a hint of hop leaves, maybe some floral hop character. Very subtle and delicate aroma, but certainly complex and pleasing. On to the actual tasting. This is by far the smoothest imperial stout I've ever tasted. A subtle yet ever-present leafy hop character is the only thing that really stays the same character-wise all the way through this beer. In the front, there's dark chocolate and coffee, in the middle, sweeter chocolate and more intense hop character, very leafy with a good amount of bitterness. excellent contrasting of flavors. In the back, hop bitterness subsides a bit in favor of more chocolate sweetness. It has a mocha feel to it overall, but this characteristic is not always so noticeable. This beer is just mellow and smooth all the way through. It's rather relaxing. No tremendous assault to the taste buds, but complexity is still in profusion. Magnificently crafted. I really wish Victory would start distributing here in Arizona, but for now I'll treasure and savor every last drop of what I can get of this masterpiece. To those of you who can grab this at your local store, count yourselves lucky and appreciate what you have!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,JohnnyDuvel,3.8,"Occasionally, I know we all try a beer that is very highly rated, with much hype - and come away disappointed. This is certainly the case here. Upon first taste, I immediately found this beer to be thin and overly hopped. It's definitely a quality brew, and the overall effect is nice. Unfortunately, the hops are too dominant, and the body is too thin for the style, The second time I had this, I drank it ""head to head"" with a Sammy Smith Imperial. No contest, IMHO. The Sammy was smooth, thick, and creamy - further emphasizing the overall lightness of this beer. On a positive note, the alcohol is very well hidden, and it goes down pretty easy. Pours dark, but not as dark as the Samuel Smith. More of a deep burgundy. Decent head, but thinner and somewhat carbonated. Some lacing, but nothing significant. Ultimately, bitter and dry. I know there are thousands of hopheads that will groan in disgust with this review, but try the same head to head test - see what you think.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Bunnyhop,4.12,"A clear, opaque, dark, reddish-brown Imperial Stout with a large, dark tan, clingy head. The smell is roasted, hoppy, and dark chocolate. The taste is roasted, along with chocolate and hops, with a strong bitter finish. The body is oily in my mouth. Overall, a bit more bitter than I anticipated but very tasty. The higher alcohol isn't particularly noticeable at first, but sneaks on in.

345,1013,Wildman,4.5,"Finally got this in my town after the law change last fall. This beer poured as dark as sin and formed a cascading huge medium tan head that subsided slowly leaving circular lace. Very foamy texture like a soda. An aroma of malt, coffee and hops. A flavor of malt, coffee, chocolate and a slight bit of hops. The finish was a touch burnt. A great stout!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,GreatPondBrewer,4.58,"Beginning with a thick, deep pour there was never any hope for any light to escape my glass. This beer was like the dark side of the moon. Night. The only thing light about it was the tan head that was about a finger width, but that quickly receded into sticky lace on the outside of the glass with some bubbles in the middle. The smell was very earthy with some roasted scents. The taste was thick bordering on chewy and very hoppy at the outset balanced with some rich coffee and bitter chocolate undertones. At the end it was a little more subtle with some exquisitely mellow malt with just a hint of the alcohol. The last taste was pure chocolate. I am not a fan of Imperial Stouts, but this has my admiration! Enjoy.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,jeffboo,4.5,"High on a mountaintop, in a faraway land, lived a lonely king. His subjects were rejecting his leadership, leaving him little hope to retain his crown much longer. What could he do? He watched the sun race behind the horizon and felt the cold air moving through the valleys. It sent chills through his blood, He could only imagine how the villagers handled this cold season every year. Then an idea struck him. A drink to keep the chill off, some elixer to warm the blood. Brew a special beer for the people, maybe this could bring happiness back to his kingdom. It would be black as night, topped with a dark brown head. It would warm the drinker with its complex aroma of raisins,coffee,dark chocolate and fruit. The smooth, full bodied texture would go down very creamy and mellow, with its alcoholic tones hidden deep beneath layers of coffee and bitter chocolate, but a nice herbal hop flavor and bitterness would add even more complexity. It would finish both slightly sweet and bitter to raise the spirits. This would be the drink to break the spell of the Stormking, the dark cloud that has covered his valley for too long. This will bring the love back, bring the sun out of its slumber. A drink to warm the souls till sping returns.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,cretemixer,4.65,"The deepest, darkest, brown with ruby highlights that is possible without being totally black. A thick tan head rests atop this delicious looking brew as light carbonation rises from the dark depths of my imperial pint glass.  Dark chocolate and hops are the most dominant aromas with hints of mochaccino and alcohol.  The taste is in line with the nose. I'm getting a nice nuttiness too. Very malty with a subdued hop presence. Very well balanced. This beer has a bittersweet quality that many Imperials strive for.  Thick and smooth, not too sticky and nicely carbonated.  Would I drink another? Hell yes! Do I want another? Hell yes! Do I have another? Unfortunately no, but I will be seeking this one out again. A huge thanks goes out to aaronh for this awesome beer, the last survivor of our beer trade. It has lived up to the hype IMHO.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Denali,4.6,"Appearance: Opaque black, thick tan head - lace lasted for the entire drink.  Smell: Berries and malt. Incredible aroma. The bottled version even has more of an aroma.  Taste: I was immediately surprised by the initial hops taste. Then a strong and sweet berry-like taste kicks in. The taste very much matched the aroma. There are many many other flavors as well, which I could not identify. More flavors kicked in as the beer warmed. Almost no alcohol taste. Yum.  Mouthfeel: Very rich, creamy and smooth.  Drinkability: Despite the high ABV, I found that this beer did not hit me that hard. Is also easy on the stomach. Considering how enjoyable this beer is, I would be more than happy to drink these all night.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,scottum,4.3,"Woah! Double take... over 9% abv? wow, this brew sure hides that fact with its steller taste. Pours out blackish black with not much head to write home about. But the taste, yes the taste is quite good. Not the best imperial stout I've ever tasted, but it's a damn good one!!! Mmmmmm stout! I'd drink these by the case if I could afford it.

345,1013,MJR,4.5,"Appearance: Out of the bottle pours a thick, viscous, black crude some of us are brave enough to consume willingly. A massive tan head sits on top of the midnight black body, guarding anyone from trying to steal any of the precious liquid underneath. Like a merciless black hole, all light is sucked into it and never seen again. Sheets of lace cover the sides, preventing light from sneaking in...  Smell: From the depths, comes the distinct aroma of Cascade hops. Along with the floral hops, flavors such as roasted grain, coffee, and chocolate rise to the surface, like hands of the damned, rising from hell trying to pull you in... I can resist no longer...  Taste: In a whirlwind of taste, the same intense flavors that took aim of you in the nose, team up for one hell of a sucker punch. Rum, chocolate, coffee, alcohol, raisons, fresh floral hops, it never ends... Like a wave of flavor, it overcomes you and takes control of your palate, with the hops being the strongest of the many flavors. Complex and delicious...  Mouthfeel: Thick, oily, creamy, and soothing...it's mouthfeel is only surpassed by Bell's Expedition Stout...hence the 4.5... There is no finish, as the aftertaste lingers on what seems an eternity...  Drinkability: Dangerously high... I'd be truly afraid if I had regular access to this one.

The color appears to be jet black, but with a mag-lite behind it a gorgeous ruby shines through. The head is thick, creamy, and coffee-colored. I was truly blown away by the nose of this brew . . . very floral, with a malty backdrop. The flavor is roasty, with a lingering and beautiful hoppy bitterness. The high ABV is barely noticeable, masked by the balance of the brew's flavor assault.  Worth moving 1200 miles to enjoy on a regular basis.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Aroma is full of roast malt, coffee, and pine, with some vinous characterisitcs sneaking through. The flavor reveals quite a bit of hops... piney bitterness mixing with roast malt, then some malty sweetness that has a very subtle flavor of red wine, and a coffee finish. Has a slightly thin body for an Imperial Stout, but it's still full and smooth. This is a wonderful beer that I could drink again and again.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,shirfan,4.7,"For review #50, the much-esteemed Storm King.  Not a single photon escapes this... black as tar. Aroma is of roasted malts and rich chocolate baked goods.  Taste is where this truly shines, however. Everything that an imperial stout should be and more...starts smooth and dark chocolate, moves effortlessly to rich, refined, almost mocha flavor, before being taken over by a pleasing hoppy finish. Goes down effortlessly, with an almost airy, sweet and clean balance. It's every bit as complex as its peer from the Brooklyn Brewery, but less rough-and-tumble. Hides its ABV much too well.  This deserves the high praise it has received, it combines almost all of the best flavors I enjoy in beer into one amazing package.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Rousing nose of vanilla cake iced in chocolate buttercreme and slathered with a fresh cherry sauce; some decorative toasted shortbread cookies thrown in for effect. A cup of espresso and a shot of wheatgrass on the side. Starts simultaneous sweet malt and roast petering into nutskin and ramping up lingering hop to finish. Hairless and almost too easy to drink.

345,1013,the42ndtourist,4.03,"2002 bottling - September 26.  I avoided reading reviews of this so I could analyze it on my own. But then once I started drinking it I had to look at them to compare with what I was tasting...  It's all black.... nothing else to see. A fairly large-bubbled dark head sits on top and retains some presence to the very end. Some lacing is evident.  That hoppy, vinous, acidic quality everyone talks about - I don't like it. Nose is actually more floral than stout-like. Taste is largely affected by these hops. Acid shows in the finish. Vinous? Well, kind of, but not all that pleasantly. Mouthfeel is, yes, oily.  You know, it's not what I expected at all. The traditional stout flavours are undermined by the acid and hops. I may not have a whole lot of experience with imperial stouts, but I think malts should govern. Here, they don't. I prefer my good old locally available Wellington Imperial with it's mounds of coffee and chocolate overtones. After reading various reviews - I wouldn't mind trying some aged bottles of this, when the hops have mellowed.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Admiraldinty,4.55,Jet black with a dark tan head. Sort of wine-smelling (maybe the alcohol-this is a good thing) Obvious coffee-mocha flavor with a burnt malt finish. Full-bodied with pretty obvious alcohol. The best thing about this is the smoothness. There is so little carbonation that this is like drinking milk (or something really smooth.) Because of the high alcohol content (boy did this one make my Irish cheeks red) the drinkability suffers. But I'd certainly go back to it. I think I'm going to cellar this one as well.,Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,JISurfer,4.88,"This is the best beer I've ever had. It's so good, and the only way that you could possibly know how good it is, would be to drink it yourself. The color is very dark and you can't see light through it, which I totally dig. The head is a great brownish-red color. Started out super thick, but went down to a film later. The taste is like a very light chocolatey coffee mixed with a peppery stouty taste. The finish is so smooth, it's like butter. It just slides down your throat and coats it. To experience this stuff is half the ""fun"" of it. I'm just glad that they finally got it at The Vintage Cellar.

Aromas of coffee and roasted malt filled my nose, trailing off with hints of chocolate. The first sip was big and thick, roasted malt, toffee, caramel and chocolate, followed by a thick, coffee rich malt finish. Creamy and smooth with just a hint of carbonation.

Intense roasty and chocolately aroma with a light alcohol scent. Light hop aroma initially but dissappears quickly in older versions. Burnt malt character with a big chocolate flavor. Rich and roasty with a bittersweet chocolate finish. Full bodied with a noticeable alcohol presence. The warming sensation lingers...  Note: I did a linear tasting of 3 years (98-99, 99-00, and 00-01). Tasted: 01/15/03. I found the beer to be better (more rounded) as it gets older.

345,1013,allboutbierge,4.87,Drank out of a storm king glass. An awesome winter warmer. Thick and heavy yet drinkable. First sip reminded me of SN's stout in respect that it has that touch of crisp hopiness. Color was that of my 30W oil and head was medium with a brownish hue. Taste was that of a heavy and dark coffee/chocolate with a crisp hopiness in the background. This beer is calorie and flavor packed.

The pour left a deep dark stormy brew with a distinct hoppy aroma. The first smooth swig greeted my palate with smooth-edged big malt presence and a huge floral hop infusion. The flavors meld perfectly to create a very drinkable and tasty brew that goes down smooth and leaves you searching for another. The high ABV is not as apparent as one might think, but definitely kicks in after a couple go down the hatch.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,BeerAngel,3.83,"Pours a near jet-black color with a 1-1/2 finger tan head with staying power. The aromas of chocolate malts and light alcohol dominate the nose. The taste reveals roasted chocolate malts with a crisp hop bite and slight alcohol dryness on the tail. The mouthfeel is a little on the light side for a beer of this style but to me it does not take away from this beer a significant amount. Now my opinion: Does it hold all the characteristics it needs to be number one ranked on BA? No. But the fact is, it is number one (at least at the time of this writing it is number one) and I value my fellow BAs opinion and BAs formula works well. Is it a good beer? No, it is a great beer. But it lacks complexity that a top notch beer should have.  Nonetheless, I enjoyed this beer, but I was less than wowed.

Incredible aroma - fruity, hoppy, with a heavy toffee/coffee malt base. Flavor full of hops - nice and bitter! Also, a rich taste of roasted malt, and slightly vinous fruit. Finish is extremely oily, with a noticeable alcohol warmth. Body is thick and a bit syrupy (more so than I expected from the slight clinging). It may in fact be just a bit too thick, but it's still excellent. A truly fine Imperial Stout. I'd love to get my hands on more of this. Alas, it will have to wait...

Since this beer has held the top rating spot for some time, I tried to reign in my expectations and approach it with an open mind.  Onyx black, with a dense coca-colored head, like cafe latte. I observed an interesting Guinness-like cascade effect in the head about half-way down, which stopped and left about half the head that stayed with the beer throughout. Wonderful aroma of deeply roasted malt and a touch of Mexican chocolate.  Flavor was dense with layers of roasted malt peeling away. High ABV was evident in a slight tingle at the tip of the tongue. Hops bitterness punched a hole through the wall of malt and announced itself at mid-tongue, with a thick, lasting bitterness at the finish.

345,1013,Dantes,4,"Package: 12oz. bottle, labeled 9.1% ABV; bottled Oct. 15, 02. Nice description and Aztec-like mask on a blue-black label. No recommended serving temperature.  Cost: $7.99 a 6-Pack at Bottle King  Presentation: Imperial Pint glass at ~50º.  Appearance: Darkest brown, like Gabon ebony. Virtually opaque. Head was sparse and disappointing for a stout, resembled espresso crema. Faint gunsmoke. Subsequent pourings yielded better heads.  Smell: Burnt coffee and wood-resin aromas. Definite hops aroma. Alcohol.  Taste: The first taste was like cold espresso ristretto. Sensations of burnt coffee and semi-processed cacao nibs (Yes, I&#8217;ve eaten them). The alcohol pushed to the front, steamrolling over whatever other flavors might have been there. I didn&#8217;t register the flavors of fruit, tobacco, and chocolate noted below. I tasted the hops, but didn&#8217;t feel that this was over-hopped as many micros are. Sweetness expanded as my palate acclimated to the bitter coffee upfront. Medium, acrid finish.  Mouthfeel: Lacked the creaminess I expected. Somewhat thin.  Drinkability: Reasonable for its ABV. Not something which I'm likely to drink a lot.  I&#8217;m somewhat reluctant to write this review, because it diverges so much from the experiences of others and I'm a neophyte reviewer. In my defense, I tried three bottles of this in various situations, and consider stouts one of my favorite types. Of the three bottles, SK seemed best to me as an accompaniment to a meal of pan-seared filet mignon with shallot butter, baked potato, and salad. The richness of the beef countered the sharp edges of the beer, revealing more complexity. By itself, I was surprised that the alcohol was less integrated than in the Old Horizontal with a higher ABV, nor was it as luxurious. Alone, I felt that this was trying too hard to peg the meter in every category as opposed to achieving an integrated whole. I didn&#8217;t hate it but I didn&#8217;t love it either. Like &#8220;Charbucks&#8221; it thinks burnt is better (and I love coffee).  Backwash: This king has no clothes. I&#8217;m at a loss to explain my lack of affinity for this, as I agree with most other rankings. I think that this would be better on draught (as most beers are). All in all, I&#8217;d rather have a Samuel Smith&#8217;s Imperial Stout, Oatmeal Stout, or a Rogue Shakespeare. I plan to drink one more and cellar the last two.

An earthy hop aroma is present along with some espresso, dark chocolate, and roasted malt. Full bodied with a thick and creamy mouthfeel. Flavor starts with roasted malt and an hop bitterness. Smoothes out with some chocolate sweetness in the middle along with notes of coffee. Hops come back into play with an earthy and citrus character and finishes with some dark chocolate and lingering roasted flavors. Alcohol stays somewhere in the backround and does not assert itself until you look down that the bottom of the empty glass. Delicious and highly drinkable.

Pours as thick as melted wax, a black bitumen looking liquid that effervesces and settles with a nitrogenous looking separation that Guinness would be proud of. The head forms readily into a large brown mass, is well aerated, very crusty, bubbly and it laces the glass sides with eloquence. Head settles to a creamy 1/4  but as thick as a Navvies Slice. Nose, hold on  I get Chocolate Rice Crispies, the chocolate is so prevalent in the nose that I am now imagining a bowl of Rice Crispies sat in a pool of cool brown milk. Other aromas are malt, and er, well, erm chocolate again. Hmmm. Tastes are chocolate at the beginning; cocoa powder in the middle, hoppy at the end, and the finish has a burnt roast twist and a lovely coffee bitterness.

345,1013,Riggo,3.93,"With as much praise as this beer has gotten here at the Beer Advocate there is a slight difficulty in being objective when reviewing it. My solution is to describe it in the following way: This beer impressed me a great deal more than it charmed me. (The stout that charms me is Guinness Extra Stout.) Point is, the complexity and sheer brewing prowess is very evident with this beer; it's just a little too intense and in your face for me to be drinking too often.  The first thing you notice when this stout escapes from the bottle into your glass is the color--deep dark black. A tan, cocoa powder-colored head, creamy and luxurious. Scents of roasted grains, espresso, molasses, pine and, yes, bubblegum. The taste is a strong duet of bitter, piney hops and roasted espresso. Elements of anise and raisins with an oily, silky, full-bodied mouthfeel. On the palate the complexity of this beer is immediately recognizable and impressive indeed. (More than any other, this beer represents, for the American brewing tradition, the very opposite of beers like Bud and Miller, etc.) The combination of high abv and heavy hop presence leave a bitter bite on the back of the throat. This gets back to my distinction regarding being charmed and being impressed. The intensity of this beer is just a little much for my tastes but, nevertheless, I understand its respect on this site and think it is well-deserved. Victory is one of the very best American breweries and they rarely disappoint. The Storm King Stout is clearly a must try for any self-respecting American beer advocate.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,UncleJimbo,4.6,"I sampled a 12 oz bottle marked ""Bottled on OCT 29 02"" (therefore, about 2.5 months old).  The stout poured beautifully to give a very dark black/brown beverage with a nice light brown, long lasting head that clung to the glass as I drank it. I found this to be exceptional for a bottled stout.  The smell was very nice with a strong carmelized barley aroma with hints of licorice. The aroma was evident with each sip.  The taste was very strong, and it almost jumped off the tongue, with a strong, sharp heavily roasted barley flavor, very slight sweetness, and some nice hoppiness in the long-lingering aftertaste. The slight taste of alcohol was detectable in this strong brew. The mouthfeel was sharp and full bodied, but smooth.  As for drinkability, this stout is quite good, but because it is 9.1% abv, I hesitate to give it the highest score in this category.  Now I understand why this beer has received such good reviews.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Not because Victory doesn't care about their product, just this particular one has too high of a hop profile. Slow it down, although an Imperial Stout, still a stout. Concentrate more on the malt. There are far better representations of the style than this one.  However, it is a good beer overall. Pours black and forms a thin dark tan creamy head. Has a very noticeable hop flavor. Malty, but mildly so. Overall decent mouthfeel with a lackluster finish. It doesn't show-up the way imperial stout should. Nothing royal about it. I personally feel that is because of the high hop profile as it drowns out a lot of the what shoud be underlying tone. This stout would be far better if the hops were tuned down a little.  But, I am objective and would suggest this to most, especially hopheads, as it is not a bad beer just not what I think it should be.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,LarryV,4.4,"A fairly agressive pour resulted in a thin foamy head about 3/4"" deep. It disappeared quickly though into the inky depths of this beer. The aroma is pleasant, no bitter undertones, chocolatey and inviting. Mouth feel is spot on with a pleasant creaminess. Coffee, chocolate, hops, maltiness, they're all there in the taste. Afterwards, the taste lingers for a long time on the palate. I didn't think the alchohol was that pronounced. It will most definitely sneak up on you however, this is a potent, tasty brew.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Dogbrick,4.58,"Another winner from Victory. Bottled on 10-25-02. Thanks to a great trade I got this one! Being a Stout lover I was really looking forward to this one and I was not let down. I was reminded of a cold cup of coffee as I poured, it was that color. Aroma of coffee, dried fruit and chocolate. Wood-burned flavor of malt, alcohol and espresso kept my interest throughout. I'd like to try a bottle that has aged a bit next time, because I have the feeling it would be even better. Thanks to Victory for living up to their name again!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,maxpower,4.4,"Dark jet black color, with a creamy tan head, leaves a clingy lace in the glass. Aroma of coffee, plums and licorice. Full thick creamy mouthfeel, starts sweet ends with a huge burnt bitterness, This is a great Imperial, I love it.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Jarod,5,"First I would like to say that I bought this keg on the recommendation of the BA. When poured into the glass it is BLACK, no light gets through. The head is thick, rich and a creamy mocha tan. It lasted. The lace was beautiful, the same color as the head, and it draped the inside to the last sip. The aroma was amazing and complex and intense. I nosed coffee, chocolate, berries (as it warmed), floral, malt and hops. The taste was amazing, full and smooth. I tasted chocolate, coffee, milk, fruit (berries), roasted malt and hops. Temperature plays a role in this beer. The warmer it got the more intense and distinct the flavors became. It starts off alittle sweet then all the flavors jump at you and then it has a dry long lasting finish. GREAT BEER",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,AaronRed,4.85,"This is one truley amazing and unforgetable beer. I did not expect it to be this good. It poured jet black with a creamy tan head- laces all the way down the glass. Wonderful presence of aromas- chocolate, coffee and even sweet plumbs. The taste was great- strong bitterness chocolate and dark roasted malty tones. Vigorous and strong, the flavor never faded. Silky and smooth, yet powerful, this brew is among the best beer I have ever tasted.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,yen157,4.79,"An example chosen to teach my girlfriend about imperial stouts, her favorite style. Although I've had this before, my taste memory isn't the greatest so having this was kinda a new experience for me too.  What can I say that hasn't been said already? A great imperial stout all around. Is it the absolute best? I'm not sure. I will come back to this one time and time again because memorable it IS. The characteriastic that sets this stout apart from others such as Sam Smith, Brooklyn Chocolate, and every other that I've ever had is the hopping of the beer. Many imperials rely on toasted malts and blackened grains for a majority of thier flavors. Doing this they achieve great things in terms of depth of flavor and complexity. Victory is the only brewer that really gives hops a chance to shine through in an important way. Most will provide hop flavor and bitterness for balancing these normally weighty brews, but Victory somwhow manages to make their hops the centerpeice of their brew. Very, very well done.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,feloniousmonk,4.57,"Dark brown head, dies quickly. Cocoa, espresso, rich chocolate, hint of anise, a beautiful blend of brandy, rum in this very alcoholic nose. Rich, full, sweet mouthfeel, long finish. Prominent strength, perfect winter warmer, dessert, nightcap, bludgeon,etcetera! The flavor lingers and nestles deep down on the palate..plums, raisins...  My first review ended before the bottle did, and I tried it the next night, this time with a warm bottle. Big difference. Head is bigger, browner, flavor is intense and hot, feels stronger than 9.1%! The very epitome of roasty, a totally unique beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,aracauna,4.16,"Imperial Stout Blind Tasting notes (11-16-02): Big hops, some chocolate, burnt. Mouthfeel feels a little thinner than you'd expect from the well formed head.  It seems that the trip in the mail may have done a little harm to the beers in the package this beer came in because it and 2 others seemed a little light on the head. Still, this slight defect did little to detract from the quality of the beer. Huge roasty, burnt malt hits the nose strongly hinting of coffee with lighter hints of caramel. The flavor pops your taste buds with more coffee, and caramel. Very rich and a bit sweet. The palate is a bit grainy, but still creamy without being to heavy. My first experience with the imperial stout has been a good one.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,MaineBeerMan,4.7,"Rich black color with a big light brown head. Aroma of coffee, chocolate and some floral/bitter hops. Full bodied with a nice smoothness, the flavor is pretty amazing. Roast barley , dark chocolate, espresso and and some dark fruit flavor hit big with an initial sweetness. After that fades the hops and a burnt/ roasted bitterness kick in for a long lasting and drying finish. A very good beer that I wish I could get locally, thanks go out to Jim in Pennsylvania (NeroFiddled) for providing me with a wonderful beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,thefireman,4.78,"I tried this great beer at the Victory Brewery facility, which is another rating in itself. (great place). This stuff came to me in a pint glass with a small head, which was leather brown in color. I held it up to the light and saw it was black as coal. Great smell-like malty, with a chocolate, coffee aroma. Needless to say, the alcohol was quite evident. That being said, it was time to taste. Great malt, chocolate, and alcohol hit right away-with the hops kicking in after a couple minutes. This stuff felt great, almost like a meal in itself. Fabulous stuff. I had the waiter set a case out for me when I left. Can't get enough Victory brews.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,NeroFiddled,4.49,"Bottled on Sept-26-02. Pours blacker than a cloudy and moonless night for a sailor lost at sea in the middle of the Pacific. When held to the light only thin glints of deep brown are seen along the rims of the glass. The opaque body is topped by a solid and creamy head that is at first quite brown, but shortly thins and becomes more of a deep tan. Really interesting! The head holds quite well but eventually drops to a good collar and a thin surface covering (probably due in part to the high alcohol content). It does, however, leave an interesting ""spider web"" lace throughout the glass. The body is medium/full with a median level of carbonation that softens as it warms and leaves a very silky mouthfeel. The aroma is bold and fresh; full of rich, very deep bittersweet chocolate and roasted malts as well as some apple-like fruitiness and sharp grassy & floral hops. Quite hoppy when young! The freshness and high level of hop character are quite unique in the world of Imperial stouts (I'm guessing Goldings). The flavor starts with some light fruit and a rich chocolatey note, reveals some lightly acidic character (probably from the low pH of the deeply roasted malts) and then some more sweetly malty notes as it warms in the mouth, finally finishing dry with a firm bitterness and lingering espresso-like roastiness. Exceptionally well balanced between malty sweetness, acidity, deeply roasted character and bitterness... with some hop flavor thrown in to spice things up a bit! It's not too acidic or thin bodied (as many Imperial stouts can be) and the alcohol is very well cloaked. An exceptional beer that's well worth seeking out. Additionally, although the fresh character is really interesting and engaging, it ages very well and becomes quite another beer. I like to enjoy it both ways. If cellared, it will round within 6 months but really smooths at about a year. Beyond that it will probably not improve greatly, but should hold without defect for at least another 6 months, and probably well over another year! Buy a case and put away half to cellar!",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,jackndan,4.85,"Storm King Stout: Bottled on October 15, 2002. Dense head, ocher colored, long lasting. The head leaves a thick lace on the side of the glass. The aroma is very nice, dark chocolate and fruits. This Imperial is as dark as night, no light penetrates this beer, even when held up to a strong light. Wow, this is fantastic beer, with a wonderful roasted malt taste, that is nicely balanced with hops. Double mocha espresso, with a long lasting aftertaste. Substantial alcohol warmth. I'll have to age a couple of bottles. This is truly a wonderful beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,IrishRedRock,4.58,"I'm not worthy!! I have been anticipating my first sip of this beer for a long time now, and am ecstatic that it is in my glass right now.  By far, the blackest, darkest beer I have ever poured, with a thick tan head atop. The smell is wonderful, with hints of dark chocolate, roasted malts, bitter hops, and alcohol.  Mouthfeel is absolutely as smooth as silk, sliding across the tongue and down...ohhhh. A delicious bitter hoppy aftertaste follows the taste of chocolate, coffee, and burnt toast. Alcohol flavor is present, but certainly not overpowering, and does not seem at all to be 9.1%. There is a nice warming feeling in the stomach though, which I am thoroughly enjoying. By far one of the greats...",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,aaronh,4.82,"Bottled 9-26-02. An essentially black beer with dark ruby edges that pours with a light coffee colored head. The head is modest and fades quickly, leaving a slight lace. The nose is very sweet and fruity. The mouthfeel is heavenly. Very silky, it just coats your tongue and feels like it slides down so easily. The taste is very complex, with roastiness up front, followed by a little sweetness and bitter mocha-coffee notes. The aftertaste brings dark chocolate covered cherries to mind. The balance of roasted bitterness and malty/fruity sweetness is amazing. Although this is a big beer, the alcohol is primarily noticable as it warms the esophagus. I could enjoy these all night long, simply because of the seemingly endless flavors this beer throws at me. I honestly did not expect this much pleasure from such a young beer. Where has this beer been all my life? Thanks to Nero for hooking me up with this beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,stirgy,4.9,"My first impression of Storm King was the complex and rich flavor and it's drinkability. The alcohol was subdued but it was definitely there. It was midnight black with a creamy, leather- brown head. This beer matched perfectly with the chocolate cheesecake I was enjoying. A great cold weather beer. I tasted hints of chocolate and coffee, along with some fruitiness. Excellent.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Scoats,3.63,"I had a year old Storm King last night. Younger batches seemed to have a very noticable alcohol taste, which wasn't obvious in the aged version.

This is an in your face stout to start with. Dark and roasty malts and coffe are all over you as you are engulfed in this brew. Then... you get hit with a mass of hops that gives the hoppiest stouts a run for their money. This is one of the best brews out there without a doubt in my mind. man oh man this is one beer you should not miss trying.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,boblinneman,5,"Most stouts are good, really good. But some are great. Storm King is one of the greats. There are several mysteries lurking in the darkness of this brew. The roasted flavor blends with a malt sweetness that is balanced by plenty of hops.

345,1013,jtw5877,4.88,"Pours a deep dark brown/black color with tan head.

345,1013,doho95fu,4.75,"Nothing bad to say about this beer. The color is almost black, and the smell is great - is it coffee or chocolate? - can't be sure but it smells good. The taste is firm and varied, it seems to end with a chocolate taste, and for a beer with a 9.1%, it doesn't have a real hard alcohol taste. Very drinkable at 9.1 as well.

345,1013,BeerManDan,4.8,"WOW! What a stout. It almost smells like it tastes. The aroma and taste of coffee/toffee is heaven, with a tinge of a malty carmel.

345,1013,rosebud,4.7,"Just bought a one year old case of this. All I can say is that time has been good to Storm King. When I first bought it last year it was too green. Too much alcohol on the palatte and the malts hadn't smoothed out enough. Time has been kind and this is now an exceptional beer. The blending of malt and hops are incredible, if anything the hop is more pronounced. Unfortunately this is quickly becoming a session beer. Victory consistantly puts out a quality product and their attention to detail is great.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,marc77,4.25,"Jet black & opaque topped by a rocky, dense & well - retained beige head that leaves attractive lace. Sweet dark caramel, buttery malt, bittersweet chocolate, black licorice, & smooth roasted grain aroma, with a lightly floral hop nose. This brew exhibits excellent balance all around. Residual sweetness is superbly offset by both roasted grain & clean hop bitterness. This balance allows the deep, bittersweet chocolate flavors to coat the palette, while subtle dark fruity notes inculding raisin and caramelized dates pleasantly eek their way into the flavor profile. The body is unfortunately a bit thin and doesn't deliver on the malt profile and could use more dextrins and / or proteins. The finish is surprisingly light, and is comprised of more roasted unmalted barley & mild hop bitterness that lingers enjoyably on the back of the tongue. Storm King is a delicious imperial. With more body this would be phenomenal.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90

Nice smooth balanced chocolate, roasted fruit aroama. Plums, raisans, and sweet hit the nose. The taste was everything to be expected. Heavy chocolate taste, balanced with some unexpected hoppyness. Perfectly smooth, silky chocolate finish and feel. Flavors are perfectly balanced and more subtle than the Old Rasputin, lacks any harsh bitter finish. It would be a dream to have on tap.

The deep, dark color tempts the eyes, the hoppy nose tempts the tongue and does not disappoint. Its roasty, coffee notes along with the distinct hop finish makes this a hophead's delight. May not be to everyone's taste and the 9% abv can be a bit daunting, but to enjoy this beer on a night with a good book or beer magazine or even an entertaining movie, is worth it.

There is a wonderful cling to the brew with that thick lace. Complex smell of coffee, licorice, and roasted malt. There is a strong bold complex flavor to the beer of roasted malt/expresso/ and a bitter hop finish. The Mouthfeel is originally very lively and carbonated followed by a smooth finish.

345,1013,Thrasher,4.55,"Pitch black liquid with dark tan head. Very fragrant with hints of blackberries and pumpernickel. This is a bold, robust beer with severe burnt maltiness and slightly creamy mouthfeel. Hops give it a real kick and finishes with a twang. You can't taste the alcohol but you feel the numbing in your mouth and in your gut. Quite thick and cloying, tarry with a vague milky sourness. Reminds me of Cuban coffee. I found this beer unique, can't think of any other like it. Not for the timid.

345,1013,cokes,2.86,"2005 (aged 2 year): This has slipped further. All burnt astringent coffee, vague plum and tobacco, and an equally harsh and astringent (and uncomplimentary) spearmint-aspirin hopping. The body thins like a hairline, and drinkable suffers in proportion. In the course of 4 or so years (not the bottle, but the beer itself, because this sucks fresh now too), this has gone from elite to disaster, and is now totally off my radar. Keep in mind that this was once a beer I rated 4.95 (see below). Oh how the mighty have fallen.  2002. Second go-round here. A little less enthused, but it is still a very good Imperial. Blackish with dark brown hints. Thinnish, fizzy tan head. Roasty, cascade-hued aroma. Taste is huge on expresso, and equally huge on piney, citric rind hops. But I've come to find it lacking in the dark fruit that I hold so dear in the style. Liquorice hints. Char and pine sap dominate the finish. Considerably thinner than I recall. Though still around medium. Maybe this batch is slightly different, but I remember the 2001 to be a killer. I can't rate the current batch that high. A vertical tasting well be done next year to figure out what's going on. Still, this is a well done, but very straight forward Imperial Stout. But I can no longer call it elite. Thanks to Bighuge for the 2002. (Rating 4.05)  2001 First off, many thanks to VENOM for allowing me to try this beer. You're my man, bro. What a beer! Storm King has been tops on my wish list for awhile. And for good reason. Pours pitch black, even when held to strong light...maybe just the slightest edge of orange. Nice tan head that lasts the duration. Smell is big on chocolate, roastiness and hops. I know I'll love it just from the smell. Taste is big expresso, chocolate and cascade hops. A dark fruit undertow is present as well. Sweet and bitter in perfect harmony. Taste it for your own damn self, this is too good for words. Nice and thick, a delight to drink. A tear falls from my eye when I finished this...until I realized I have one left. I will certainly save it for sometime special.

I find some chocolate tones, wonderful roasted malt, anise and slight java in the taste. Very complex. There are tastes at work here that I'm sure I'm missing. Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel. This really goes down easy for an Imperial. This is exceptional. I have just added another beer to my Elite Imperial Stout List (along with Bell's Expedition, Rogue and NC's Old Rasputin).

I picked up aromas of dark chocolate, dark fruits, and a very faint alcohol aroma. The first thing that hits my tongue is chocolate and espresso, lots and lots of both. Lots of roasted malts too. A very chewy beer, very creamy in the mouth. For as full bodied and chewy as this beer is I find it incredibly drinkable.

The flavors that stand out are that of dark chocolate and roasted malts and alcohol is evident / no question . I thought this brew was very complex but was lacking a bit of balance to it.

As this is an older review and it remains a high-scoring beer in my book, I will say that this Imperial Stout has a complex fruitiness and brightness, retains a lot of solid mouthfeel, and avoids an overly burnt or motor-oil impression.

Then the taste -- a hint of chocolate (just a bit), espresso, and just enough bitterness from the hops. Amazing. This is why I love beer.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,Bierman9,4.5,"Now 18JUN10, and my last ""old"" bottle is opened and ready for quaffing. Bottled 07DEC04... Nothing much different on appearance... aroma has mellowed and is on the mild side, with some roasty choco... still fairly thick and smooth... lots of choco and bitterness present, with only light floral hops present. I had a fresh one on tap about 2 weeks ago at Victory... Thoughts? I really think it's better fresh! Aging doesn't really do a lot for this, though it is still verrry quaffable!  Prosit!  *** *** ***  Am drinking today (14APR10) my last Storm King that was bottled on 18NOV03... Opaque brown, very thin head, touch of lace... dark choco and a vinous quality in the nose... Smooth and almost chewy, still, after all these years... Flavor has some more choco, dark fruit, a smidge of bitterness and florality. Verrry nice, after almost 6.5 years... Same as it ever was....  Prosit!!  *** *** ***  Today (18MAR09) I'm quaffing my oldest bottle of the King, from 29OCT02.... Still an oily, dense black, with minimal tan head mostly rimming the edge... aroma has lightened, a bit raisiny and still a touch of florality. Smooth and chewy on the tongue, the flavor has mellowed considerably. Bitterness has ebbed, with roasty choco still present. Some dark fruit lingers in a vinous sort of way. Hopping is much lighter as time goes by. Reminds me now of something more akin to Brooklyn Black Choco Stout, in this stage. Better fresher; not one to age too long... (no re-rating on this... just notes for posterity).  Prosit!!  *** ***  Tonight (25OCT06) I am trying the '05-'06 version, bottled 18NOV05. Still 9.1%. Still engine-oil black, with a thin, tan, wispy head and quite pretty lacing. Even when held up to a strong light, nothing penetrates. Roasty, bitter choco aroma notes emanate from the liquid, with a decent floral hopping. Body is still solid, though not as full as years ago. Passes smoothly, as always, over the tongue. Flavor has lots more bitter choco action and roasty malts. Bits of dark currants and raisins also check-in, with a solid, floral hopping rounding things out, and lingering well after sipping. Perhaps not as good as years past, or perhaps my palate has changed and this isn't the be-all, end-all stout I found it to be almost 5 years ago. All the same, quite tasty! Prosit!!  overall: 4.5 appearance: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | mouthfeel: 4.5 | drinkability: 4.5  *** ***  17MAR02 - Just an update from the previous 01JAN02 draft review...(this is a bottle review)....Black as night....creamy, tan, full-head, with some top-notch lacing, too!!! ... Rich, full nose and mucho dark fruit in addition to a healthy dose of hops....superb... Creamy smooth and full!!! Oh baby, oh Mama!! Complex taste, with that great flavor of malty sweetness, dark fruits, and loads of hoppiness. This is one GREAT brew...I really want to get to Victory in PA and try this fresh on tap, as well as their other brews! (5.0/4.5/4.5/5.0/4.5 = 4.65)  *** ***  Bier #1 on my long, strange BA trip.... 01JAN02... Happy New Year!!  Superb! First tried this on tap at the Sunset Grille in Allston...A-1 in the bottle too!! Luscious vollmundikeit....so smooth and full! I love the finish of dark roasty flavors...just keep an eye on how many you've had! Prosit!!

345,1013,mmthompson33,4.94,"Definitely one of the best, if not the best, stouts I've ever had. Every sip is a pleasure. The complexity and fullness are strong down to the last drink.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,bcm119,4.15,"The flavors are very complex and change as the beer warms. Licorice, espresso, burning oak, bitter chocolate, dry leaves... lots of interesting stuff in there. Hops are big and grapefruity- this beer is so complex its confusing. Alcohol notes come through occasionally in the aroma and the nose, but still an amazing stout. One of my original ""favorite beers"" from the 90s.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,marble,5,"A great stoudt, no doubt. Alcohol content is high, but doesn't dominate the taste at all. This one has everything a stoudt lover looks for.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
345,1013,John,5,"Without question, one of the best Imperial Stouts. Has to be tasted to be believed. Outrageous on cask.",Victory Brewing Company - Downingtown,"Pennsylvania, United States",American Imperial Stout,90
