113,782,JackRWatkins,3.37,"A: Pours up a deep reddish mahogany with a frothy three-finger beige head, medium retention, nice lacing.  S: Immediate notes of chocolate followed my more muted hints of roasted malt, specifically not coffee but roasted malt, though some slight coffee notes do come out a little bit later, as do some biscuity notes and some subtle hints of vanilla.  T: A warm bready sweetness greets you, followed by a somewhat jammy malt flavor that hints at chocolate without quite getting there, this is rounded out by some subtle hints of roasted malt and a crisp, slightly tart finish.  M: On the lighter end of medium body, slightly over carbonated and a bit dry.  O: This is a very good beer, but to me it suffers from what I might call “OG Syndrome”. What I mean by this is that how this style is understood has changed since this beer was first brewed but this beer largely has not, leading to a beer that misses the mark by no fault of its own. The beer has a surprisingly light body that one would not think of when one thinks of the style, and the dryness and carbonation are unwelcome by modern standards as well. I do enjoy this, but were I reaching for an imperial stout this would not be my first choice. It’s a bit too understated.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

113,782,RaulMondesi,4,"I got what I paid for. $5 for a biggie bottle of Stout. Like going to The Bunny Ranch and sticking to the third tier of doves, you’re going to get one with a few feathers missing. In life, I suggest that you shouldn’t lie to yourself (you will be better off in the long run - or any “run,” for that matter). And with tonight’s realization (for like the 50th time for me), maybe I’ll make the better decision next time.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,JacobusFavier23,3.61,"L-Jet black with a half finger head that's tan and dissipates to a rocky lace. S-Smells of faint roasted coffee, toffee, and chocolate. On an even slighter note, I get some dark stone fruit. Some soy sauce towards the end. T-Follows the nose. A roasted malt flavor there, but not much coffee. Some chocolate, vanilla and brown sugar. Molasses. Slightly sweet, slightly bitter as well. Some boozeyness at the end. F-Medium bodied mouthfeel. Decently high carbonation. O-Ehh. I don't really get the hype with this beer. It's solid, but there isn't anything to write home about. For a surprisingly low ABV imperial stout, there was still a good bit of boozeyness on the pallet. Just an okay beer. Not sure if I'd try again.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,MikeWard,4.18,"12oz bottle into a pint glass. Coding no help in determining age.  Looks nice enough. Black body with a persistent tan head which leaves scattered lacing.  Aromas of dark chocolate and faint coffee.  On tasting, very smooth, no roast, slightly sweet with the coffee and chocolate notes detected by the nose.  Mouth full, finish smooth and almost creamy.  Overall, splendid stout, would be happy to have ot again.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,hman43,3.76,"Look: It pours very dark brown with a brown head. Head retention is good.  Smell: It has a chocolate aroma with some roast in the background. There are very low dark fruit notes.  Taste: It is more roasted in the flavor than in the aroma with the chocolate not as noticeable in the background. There are light coffee flavors with very low dark fruits.  Feel: It has a medium full body with a mildly bitter aftertaste.  Overall, this is an easy drinking imperial stout with good flavors.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

113,782,detgfrsh,4.15,From a 550ml bottle. Jet black with a quarter inch of medium brown head. Smells of roasted malt. Full bodied. Roasted malt and chocolate flavors with some hop bitterness on the finish. Well done. I'm so used to the high-octane RIS that it's interesting to get this style at only 7%.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,GlenFarclas,4.39,"Pours an excellent, dirthy, viscous and full bodied dark, deep black. No light bleed. Head is hanging around and is deep earthy brown. Nose gives huge elements of baltic porter, like zywiec or black boss: toffee, caramalt and some solid residual brown sugar leading into a hint of oxidized hops (nose), liqourice (licorice?), plum, cane sugar, maybe some smoke (but the weber is going so who knows)  Hell of a beer, really complex. Those notes above all pertain just the same in the flavor, but just in phases. Like from fruity to chocolatey to smokey and on and on just evolving.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Whyteboar,4.19,"Poured into a tulip a nice black colored liquid capped by a light brown head that was dense and soft looking. Dissipated fairly quickly but still looks good. The aroma was roasted malts, and for me that is impressive, my nose is broke as far as aroma goes. The taste, I was somewhat impressed- for a RIS it was very smooth, as in no charred malts and no extra hops, just dense and full roasted malts that bring to mind figs and coffee and chocolate. Really nice! The feel is likewise smooth as silk, this is just a pleasure to drink. Glad I finally tried this, it will be a regular in my cellar.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

A - Samuel Smith always looks fancy, foil-wrapped bottles and all. This one pours a deep pitch black with ruby highlights under 3 fingers of thick dark tan foam, which leaves behind a very nice web of lace. Simply beautiful!  S - dark fruits, touch of chocolate, molasses sweetness, hint of lactic character; inviting  T - dark roasted malts, sweet and tart dark fruits, light sugar sweetness, wooden notes, earthy bitterness; just delicious  M - smooth medium body, moderate carbonation  O - an excellent beer all around; no complaints",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

113,782,KT3418,3.71,"This is somehow mostly just a sweet boozy mess even tho its 7 percent. I poured into a tulip glass. Not much malt, oats, or chocolate just a sweet alcohol flavor encased in and M&M style malt shell....although I see this is under Russian imperial which does make more sense, I think this is firmly okay but not great for Russian Imperials. It's sweet, a little malt, a little smoke, but things like Expedition Stout or Narwhal are just better to me but this is getting more balanced as I drink just not spectacular.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,PathofChaos,4.4,"Appearance: Lacquered black, showing glimpses of brown where the light leans into it. It’s topped with a half finger of dark beige fizz that disperses faster than squirrels before a feisty, jack russel. Despite this, it retains a length of drizzly lace until the glass is practically empty.  Bouquet: Plump figs that were lightly sugared, then rolled in milk chocolate cocoa powder. The after-aroma is intermittent but impressively gourmet: roasted plums brushed with woodsy molasses and given a hearty dunk in black chocolate.  Feel: A satin-soft full body, simmering with moderate carbonation. Dry, bittersweet linger.  Taste: Dark malts and oats, browned in a drizzle of maple syrup. Finishes with a spoonful of earthy, dark chocolate pudding.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

T: A short hop note at the forefront, dark baking chocolate, figs, sea salt, overripe dark berries, prunes, plum, raisins, toasted malts, toffee, coffee and port wine. It is lightly sweet. All of this with a woody and pervasive mineral cast all over it. There are dark soda bread notes in the finish. F: Medium-heavy bodied mouthfeel with a moderately dry medium fast finish. O: A deliciously rich and savory Imperial Stout that has a lot of history for good reason: The famous stone Yorkshire squares. It has superior balance, excellent flavor and has never been specific to any trend. It is incredible in it's style.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,blazerkor,4.5,"It smells so much like a typical stout that it's almost comical.  There are scents of coffee and chocolate and beery breadwater.  It's almost a stereotype in scent.  The taste follows the nose.  It's a little coffee, a little chocolate and a hole lot of beery goodness.  It's medium bodied with small amount of carbonation.  It's smooth and has a quick bitter finish with a hint of molasses.  It's really good.  It tastes like the father of stouts.  I give it a 5.4 out of 6.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

This stuff pours a deep midnight sienna topped by a finger of dirty sandstone foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, mild molasses, pumpernickel, and a touch of orange pith embedded into the background. The taste brings in more of the same, a pinch or two of cocoa powder rounding things out. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a very nice bit of bulky stout, one that doesn't throw its heft around, rather preferring to please throughout. Good times.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,LiquidAmber,4.15,"Poured into a Samuel Smith pint glass. Pours a very dark mahogany brown, appearing nearly opaque black in the glass with a two finger dark khaki head with great retention and nice lacing. Aroma of dark toasted malt, graham crackers, molasses, raisin and cocoa. Flavor is dark toasted malt, dry caramel, baker's chocolate, dried dark fruit, dark molasses develops light grassy hop bitterness and finishes dry and a little earthy. Medium bodied with light creaminess. The Samuel Smith porters and stouts have a distinct flavor profile that incorporates fruit flavors that are almost concentrated. Great to revisit one of the classic Russian imperial stouts, one of the iconic products in brewing history. Great fruit notes and some of the most intense molasses characters I recall. The finish is a bit drier than I remember, but that's likely due to all the domestic RIS I've had, which have morphed from the original historical recipes. A delicious dark stout from a great brewery.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Alieniloquium,3.73,"355 mL bottle. Pours black with a medium khaki head. Smells of chocolate, a slight acidic twang, and some light grassy and earthy hops. Tastes of hops right up front with chocolate and roasted malt behind it. Creamy with a very light lactic tang. Finishes with hop bitterness. Medium body. Distinctive in flavor because of the creaminess and tang, but very drinkable and flavorful.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,JonnoWillsteed,4.02,"#1745 - Blind-tasted except for the beer's name and brewery/country, zero reviews below read (yet!)... L- Pours jet-black with a 5mm creamy looking fine-bubble dark tan head. S- Roasty-toasty with a certain brightness. [My sense of smell isn't clear today...]. T- Oh my, that's lovely. Well roasted, major cocoa facets and maybe a hint of very light smoke. F- Deep yet has some richness to balance. I also sense that despite it's not mad ABV (7%), that it is just about making it's presence visible to the palate. O- Very nice, nothing out of place or balance. Has a pungent flavour/feel yet sufficient richness (not sweetness, at all) to balance. Nice as a slow sippin' beer, but I could easily get stuck into a few of these too. Review/scoring all done, now the reveal, I get to read the bottle lables to see what I missed! Super elegant old-school lable. Ingredients include cane sugar, not that I noticed, surprising as I *detest* and usually spot sugar in beer!

113,782,LeBron_James,4.14,"Look: Deep black, good head retention and some lacing but the lacing isn't fantastic. Smell: The beautiful Sam Smith smell that no other stout has replicated in my experience. Roasted malt and roasted barley. Dark and gives off chocolate notes. Taste: Does not entirely follow the nose. Lots of roasted flavours and it is in that nice spot between sweet and bitter, but there is this annoying metallic aftertaste that seems unique to Sam Smith beers but also sadly common among them as well. Feel: Good carbonation and pleasant full mouthfeel. Enjoyable.  Overall: This is a fine representation of imperial stout, but I don't understand the metallic aftertaste. For what you pay, however, this is a good beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

113,782,NCSapiens,4.05,"I always wanted to try this classic and finally got around to it. L: Poured out of a 550ml bottle into a Weissen glass by the bartender. Black color with minimal head. Nothing special to look at, but not bad either. S: The aroma is well water and barley. Pretty nondescript. T: The taste is where this beer stands out. Really nice blend of malt, hops, and yeast. Flavors of barley, char, and chocolate mingle in a perfect balance with biscuit, figs, raisins. A slight amount of hops adds complexity without overpowering bitterness. The well water adds a crisp and clean backdrop over which all the other factors play. The word that kept popping into my mind is fresh. I can easily imagine fans of lagers and Belgians enjoying this beer, as it is easy drinking, refreshing, and not too bitter. The alcohol is barely noticeable.  F: Medium bodied with sufficient but moderate carbonation.  O: The ultimate base stout. There is a restraint and elegance that creates an appreciation that grows the more one considers it. Some day I would like to try this on tap in England.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Taste is roasted barley, malts, yeast and hops and is surprisingly smooth with little bitterness. This is a historic English beer that was exported for the Russian Imperial Court, starting in the 1700's. To be sipped slowly and savored as the booziness rises as the beer warms. An outstanding brew that is especially nice for the Fall and Winter.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Raisins, dates, toast, toffee, red grapes, tea, very light char, banana, and just hints of licorice and molasses.  Bitter and roasty on the palate; thin by the standards established by massive double digit stouts, but it's a full bodied stout nonetheless.

Finishes with a medium bitterness and some roasted malt, chocolate and dark fruits lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.  While this appears a bit old school compared to modern RIS and perhaps just a tad lacking in body, it does have a rather nice dry and roasted character to it, with just a little sweetness coming through to round things out.

113,782,Darkmagus82,4.22,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass Appearance – The beer pours an almost pitch-black color with a one finger head of tan colored foam. The head has a fantastic level of retention, very slowly fading over time to leave a ton of foamy lace on the sides of the glass. Smell – The aroma of the brew is massive of a nice molasses and caramel smell mixed with a rather strong showing of a roasted malt and a cola aroma. Along with these smells comes a big hit of a dark fruit smell of plum, raisin, and prune as well as a touch of a oaky smell. Overall, the aroma is delicious! Taste - The taste begins with a moderately roasted taste that contains a decent showing of a cocoa flavor as well as a touch of coffee. Right from the start there is a good sum of sweetness, with it being mostly of molasses and toffee nature, but containing some of the dark fruit that was detected in the nose. The roastiness gest slightly stronger as the taste moves forward, all while the darker fruit tastes fade. At the same time, some caramel and a touch of a char and a woody taste comes to the tongue. At the end of the taste, a tiny bit of a carob taste comes to the tongue as well as a touch of a booze, leaving one with a sweeter (but not overly sweet), and dark and very easy drinking taste to linger on the tongue. Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is one the thicker and creamier side with a carbonation level that is quite low. For the tastes and the style, the feel is fantastic and makes for a very easy, but slow sipping and tasty brew. Overall – A quite nice and approachable stout. While at only 7 % abv, I am not sure I would consider it an imperial stout, but categorization aside, this is a very tasty brew.

113,782,Mindcrime1000,4.1,"Poured from a bottle into a tulip.  Pours opaque black with limited head and lacing.  Aromas of roasted malts and dark fruits waft in equal measure. Just a hint of booze.  The flavors are simple but solid. Roasted mats, dark sugars, dark fruit, chocolate, coffee, and booze. Initially sweet, it transitions into an astringent flavor in midstream with an ashy boozy finish.  The feel is a bit flat and chalky--maybe the only drawback. Still not a heavy brew by any means.

113,782,jwp777,4.57,"Poured from the bottle, tasted 1/9/20 but could not find bottling date.  Pours a very dark brown coffee color with a thin tan head which disappears quickly. Not much lacing.  Aroma is rich with chocolate and roasted malt. It smells GREAT, I just wish the aroma was a bit stronger to be honest.  Taste is roasty, earthy, some bittersweet chocolate, and maybe a bit of molasses as well. The hops, malts, and other flavors are balanced well. Finish is quite long but I don’t tire of the taste at all.  Feel is bold, and at only 7%, it lacks the heavy booze feeling that many imperial stouts bring, which is nice for me if I want that flavor but I don’t want the weight. It is fairly thick and feels like syrup toward the end.  Overall, great well balanced brew in all facets.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,ThemThangs,4.33,"Pours super thick, not much of a head. Smells like chocolate and brown sugar, with something in the background that reminds me of raisins or dried fruit. Taste is the same, with quite a bit of sweetness. Also has kind of a roasty taste, with some faint alcohol and ashy taste in the background perhaps? I don't usually like imperial stouts that much, as I find them overbearing, but this is great, maybe the best one I've had.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

113,782,MaximalC,3.62,"Pours seal brown, topped by nearly an inch of frothy, khaki suds. Mellow aroma smells of toffee, roasted malt, candied apples, and chocolate.  The taste follows the nose, with toffee, molasses, and earthy hops taking the lead, succeeded by notes of bittersweet chocolate and that signature Sam Smith's acetaldehyde flavor. Warming reveals notes of burnt sugar and toasted bread. Medium body and moderate carbonation make for a slick, smooth, slightly oily mouthfeel.  Overall, this traditional RIS is a far cry from the modern incarnations that have saturated the market. The oily mouthfeel and mild tang are more reminiscent of a Baltic porter than anything. Even so, you have to give a nod to the genuine article, even if it's quite tame by today's standards.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

113,782,Ozzylizard,4.02,"$ 3.02 (Including tax and deposit)/12 oz bottle ($ 0.252/oz) at Alkies, Massena, NY. Reviewed 7/29/19. After a diligent search, no date code was found on either the glass bottle or the label. Stored on shelf in store. Traveled in my ice chest, then refrigerated overnight in hotel refrigerator before being served in a hand washed and dried shaker. Appearance – 4.25. First pour – Dark amber, clear. Body – Pitch black, opaque. Head – Large (Maximum nine cm, aggressive center pour), khaki, medium density, average retention, stabilizing at a three cm lacy crown and cap. After a rest, this slooowly continues retracting to an irregular seven to fifteen mm crown and a complete cap with small rocks. Multiple narrow tiny to medium bands of lacing remains as the head retracts. Lacing – Excellent! Irregular sheet of tiny to small bubbles, with an occasional medium one thrown in for variety. See also above. Aroma – 4 – A bit of brown sugar and a hint of molasses and that’s it. Flavor – 4.25 – somewhat malt-forward and very slightly bitter with a long hang time. Flavor is subdued. A slight gastric warming occurs. No alcohol taste or aroma (7 % ABV), no diacetyl, no dimethylsulfide. Palate – 3 – Medium, almost creamy, soft carbonation. Impression and interpretation – 4 - (Lost 0.25 point for undated individual container.) Overall, I was a bit disappointed in this brew. It is indeed a kinder, gentler, RIS – so much so that I question if it should be classified as a RIS at all. I didn’t find the highly noticeable aroma or flavors typical of this style, at least typical of an American take on it. Perhaps it’s just too subtle for my crude colonial taste buds.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Mister_Faucher,4.34,"Two 18oz bottles purchased at Total Wine in Lynnwood, Washington. Served in a Samuel Smith pint glass I also purchased at the same time for $1.93!!  Look- Menacing, black as midnight with a massive cola colored head that has holding power. Lacing heavy and beautiful. Hard to tell if there is much carbonation going on in this used motor oil.  Smell- So much going on here. Instantly got hit by all I can describe as fresh, warm rum cake followed by dark fruits (figs, dates, raisins) followed by chocolate/chocolate cake and a hint of red delicious apple.  Taste- Basically replicates the smell with some boozy licorice or anise in there towards the end.  Feel- Not as thick as I imagined. Smooth as silk and doesn't weigh me down.

113,782,ludachris,4.31,"A thick and frothy cappuccino coloured head forms quickly from a gentle pour. There's no room for light to pass through its flat black body. It's a stern looking stout.  It's rich and layered and not overbearing. A meaty smokiness is enveloped by warm toffee and dark chocolate pudding. Its roast is more sweet than dry. Sticky raisins and plums add a deeper layer of richness.  A fruity start with plenty of Christmas cake, raisins, over-ripe plums, and sweet dark grapes without any of the acidity. A thin layer of toffee and smoke coats the tongue. The dense, pleasantly sweet chocolate in the nose has morphed into a scoop of cocoa powder; subtle and soft.  There's a brightness to its body that stems from all of its dark fruit, tingly carbonation, and sweet stroke of alcohol. It's also both creamy and coating and sits comfortably at medium in terms of weight.  A synergy is struck between barley and yeast derived esters that is played out in layers of fruity, roasty, sweet complexity. As much as this is a classic, I find this a refreshing take on the style. It's clean and light on its feet with moments of brightness. A worthy mention when talking about the style and the range it can span.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

But it is a thin kind of taste, not full. The taste and aroma doesn't linger or stay in the mouth or nose. It's good but not great. Though the labeling and presentation is great.

Nothing spectacular, mind you, but certainly solid. I enjoyed the blackness of the brew, the tan foam and the tiny bit of lacing provided. What was a tad disappointing was the smell - it was practically non-existent - there's nothing I could pull out, not even the boozy nature of such a style. Mouthfeel was light to medium-bodied, crisp, not tacky, all of it making for easy drinking. The taste was mostly roasted malts and even some stronger coffee undertones, but still, there just seemed to be something missing.

The heavy fermentation in open stone squares does seem to impart a unique character with subtle fruity/floral esters if not a certain minerality as well.  Distinctive yeast driven flavor profile with a wave of malty complexity - toasted scones, scalded sugar, chocolate, and faint tobacco-like spiciness dry out the finish.

Smell: There are roasted malt aromas, along with some strong caramel and a little coffee aromas. Nice combination and balance.  Taste: Full-bodied with great balance of malt and hops. There is a hint of sweetness, but it has an excellent taste. The combination of strong hops and roasted malts and strong alcohol give this drink powerful flavors.

113,782,CC93,4.74,"Poured from a 550ml bottle into a 400ml Stella Artois branded chalice (extras poured into after sipping a few ounces).  Look: Supremely dark, burnt brown, almost hitting black. Lacing is absolutely astonishing with a foamy, deep tan est. 1 finger high head.  Smell: Olfaction picks up some notes being boozy (alcohol comes thru), some bitter scents reminiscing of teriyaki sauce and barbecue sauce (please note that I just had a brat with barbecue sauce coated on it and barbecue flavoured potato chips, so this may be the very main reason why this is even happening). Reminiscent scents regarding some single malt Scotch whisky come to mind, which is a very interesting but surprising finding.  Taste: Plenty of maltiness with a bitter note, probably an impression of dark chocolate and not the bitterness from either a large amount of hops or poor brewing. Very wholesome and bold body. Aftertaste shows significant hops (regarding bitterness) and some dark chocolate. Very delicious.  Feel: Absolutely smooth. Cannot deny that this is one of the best drinks I've ever had.

The nose features molasses, a little moscato wine, and raisin.  The wine carries over into the taste a bit, or maybe bourbon. The raisin does, too. The alcohol isn't masked enough for my taste. The balance is more sweetness than bitterness.  The feel is very smooth, somewhat syrupy, and just a little slick on the throat.  Overall, this beer has a lot to offer.

Quite similar to the smell of Sam Smith's Oatmeal Stout. T -- Sweet caramel malts, dark chocolate, and a touch of coffee. A little on the sweet side. F -- Surprisingly light for an imperial stout.

I also detect a fruity character, like Twizzlers; maybe some chocolate-covered cherries, as well. A tiny hint of smoke becomes more present as the beer warms.  The flavor is full of roasted malt. I pick up a hint of alcohol on the flavor. It's yeasty, too. And on the end of the sip, there's a generalized yet earthy hop bitterness.

It has a fairly good retention and great thin foam top once it does dissipate.  Aromatics: Raisins and dates are the fruit scents I get, almost like a fresh Christmas fruitcake. Wonderfully sweet with a some toasty undertones.  Taste: The aroma before the sip really helps accentuate the fruitiness, it has a great balance where the bitterness kind of gets run over with the boozy before it can settle on the palate. There is a slight coffee type bitterness, but it very well off set by the subtle hint of spice and the malt. The finish is a relatively mild bitter, slightly boozy but doesn't linger too long.  Feel: The carbonation softens over time giving way to the liquid itself which is very smooth and creamy with a sturdy but not heavy body, overall it is very kind to the palate.  Overall: I liked its creaminess, and the caring gentle notes to the nose, and I love that first foamy sip when the head is high.

Taste: An earthy, caramel, roasted malt base, with a moderately strong bitterness and increasing astringent roast on the swallow. Mouthfeel: Medium body with some creaminess and low carbonation. No noticeable alcohol warmth. Finish: Leaves a crystal and roasted malt character long after the swallow. Overall: An earthier, more crystal malt based version of an American imperial stout.

Teased by a moderate aroma of malts, wood and good bread, the taste is just the right balance of kick, bitterness, sourness and sweet. It's never too much or too little, it's just right. Most stouts (especially imperial) tend to lean heavily to either side; too bitter and strong or not at all. This beer has the flavor complexities one would expect of a Porter, as opposed to typical stouts. This is a medium-heavy body beer, just barely entering into sipping territory.

Drinking this now is like returning to the Rosetta Stone and deciphering what the RIS style-- now in its many, many permutations -- really should seek to find. Samuel Smith's rendition is, in a word, balanced. In six words: balanced by blending different malts well. Hops play a minor role here as the roasted malts have been crafted so well that spices are less needed to achieve balance.  Listed in the ""1001"", Imperial Stout deserves to be there. Merchant du Vin deserves credit for making it so available to American crafters and consumers. Garrett Oliver, author and brewmaster at Brooklyn, called it the ""touchstone"" that inspired their Chocolate Stout. MJ's 1999 gave it 3.5 stars of 4, called it ""estery"" and credited it with relaunching the style as far back as the 1980s.

Pours pretty much jet black with a decent sized tan head. The head fades slowly, some lacing.  Burnt toast and figs on the palate. The fruit is more subdued than expected. Cocoa and cold press coffee. Berries linger more in the background. Fruity herbal hops provide balancing bitterness. A hint of clove. Surprisingly dry and balanced for the style.

The smell is nothing short of intoxicating, full of deep malty and toasty notes much the same as the Pale Ale was for me.

113,782,thehyperduck,4.15,"550 mL bottle from the LCBO; bottled Sept 2 2015 and served a little cooler than cellar temp. Last sampled in April 2014, though I neglected to write a review at the time.  Pours an opaque black-brown colour, crowned with just over a finger's worth of beige-coloured froth. It dissipates over the next couple of minutes, leaving behind a thin, filmy cap and a modest-sized collar. Minimal lace. Molasses and caramelized sugar are primary fixtures of the aroma, along with accompanying notes of milk chocolate, raisin, anise and cherry-flavoured red licorice candy. No complaints thus far.  And none are forthcoming - this is a very solid strong stout. Sweet flavours of treacle and caramel remain prominent, while roasted malt flavours of milk chocolate and coffee provide some much-needed complexity. Suggestions of prune-y dark fruit mid-sip. Herbal hops, roasted coffee astringency and some char/ash start to shine through on the back end, along with slight hints of alcohol and anise. Lingering roasty aftertaste with a bit of metallicity, and that's the only knock against this one that I can come up with here. Nearing full-bodied, with a silky-smooth, creamy and luxurious mouthfeel that makes this stout incredibly satisfying to sip. Not super-interesting, but the quality of this one's craftsmanship is undeniable.  Final Grade: 4.15, a worthy A-. If the original imperial stouts that were exported from Britain to Russia were anything like Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout... well then it's not hard to see why the Tsars were so keen on the stuff. Beer geeks who have been spoiled by the adjunct-laden ""extreme"" stouts that can be found across North America may not be overly impressed by this one, but screw them - that leaves more for the rest of us.

A two-finger in height, bubbly, dark-tan coloured head gradually reduces to a dense cap, leaving behind delicate bands of fine lacing,  The nose leads with a mixture of sweet, dark fruity esters, lightly roasted dark malts and a touch of soy sauce. Impressions of wood, smoke and earth all follow, along with a little rum-like alcohol detectable in the finish. The taste roughly follows suit. Moderately sweet darks fruits and a hint of raw cane sugar lead, before transitioning to lightly roasted dark malts. Mid palate the roast profile slightly intensifies, and is joined by mildly acidic coffee notes and touches of smoke and wood. In the mouth a medium to full body and excellent carbonation give a smooth, slick and slightly chewy feel. Towards the finish, pleasantly light bitter herbal hops combine with lingering roast and coffee profiles to slightly dry the palate and balance a tiny amount of residual sweetness.  Overall this is an excellent beer. It’s superbly well crafted, full of flavour and fantastic value for money.

113,782,taxandbeerguy,3.96,"550 ml bottle served at cellar temperature and served into a Sam Smith's pint glass. Purchased for about $5 CDN from the LCBO. Seemed like a good beer for my 800th review.  Appearance - pours and ominous brown and virtually black coloured beer. Big three plus fingers of tan head with impressive retention. Some sticky tan lacing glazes around the sides of the glass.  Smell - chocolate mainly but some light fruity esters and some grainy notes too. Complex with the notes but straightforward in execution if that makes any sense. A little bit too metallic to be honest which doesn't jive with the rest of the beer.  Taste - a little chocolate with some subtle coffee suggestions. Maybe a hint of vanilla too to give it a slight mocha like characteristic. A touch of smoke and ash, with some woodsy tastes too. And initially a tiny metallic twang. Pretty good and balanced flavours leave one sip different from the next.  Mouthfeel - smooth and creamy, full bodied yet dangerously drinkable with just the right amount of carbonation. While many Russian imperial stouts are huge and full bodied and delicious, they aren't exactly the easiest beer to drink all day. However with the lower ABV, this imperial stout certainly is.  Overall - awesome feel, easy to drink, plenty flavourful, what else could you be looking for.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Sabtos,3.33,"Another kind of meh disappointment, as I love their Organic Chocolate, Nut Brown and Oatmeal stout, but this tastes like a beer by a different brewery. Maybe it's the ABV that screws with their chemistry, either their water or yeast, but it's just not the same, and is a little boozy and metallic.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,DaveBar,3.96,"Purchased at the LCBO for $4.95 for a 550ml bottle. Served at 10deg C in a draught glass.  A- Opens well and pours a 2"" high brown head that lasts for around 4-5mins before film out. Very dark brown colour  S- Not much here but metallic. Bet you it's mass produced in stainless steel vats.  T- Not bad. Has smokiness and chocolate but very subdued. It's a good blend but not great. Do enjoy malt backbone.  M- Not the best but it does have some creaminess  O- Nice blend. Will buy again which is not typical for me and mass produced beer which I generally call swill. For the price and what you get it's a winner.  Food Pairing  This pretty good brew went rather well with......... Roasted lamb leg. Cinnamon, fennel seed, smoked paprika, cayenne pepper, clove, sugar, salt, pepper and thyme. The cinnamon are sticks that you slice and put into the leg. Braze and into the oven 325deg F for 20mins per pound for medium rare.  Enjoy",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Benish,3.61,"Appearance: poured into snifter glass. Jet black with a little translucence. Foamy head formed with light brown in color.  Smell: interesting. Smells almost like a cinnamon roll that came out of the oven. Except its a little moldy. Weird description but thats what comes to mind.  Taste: sweet chocolate and notes of coffee. Its like drinking a sweetened latte. There's a little bit of tartness at the end. No bitterness throughout. What I taste is different from what I smell.  Mouthfeel: light to medium bodied. Nothing significant about this.  Overall: The smell is what makes it different than the other imperial stouts. It's different but it's hard to get past that moldy smell. **Side note: this was purchased at a Utah State liquor store. They don't follow the best practices in storing beer. Considering this is an import, there could have been some unintentional changes in the flavor profile.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

113,782,Spiff,3.85,Spiff and friends took a trip to England with this imperial stout. We've learned we are not fans of Russian stouts so hearing that this beer from Tadcaster has taken Russian nobles to great heights has us Concerned. We have let it reach 50 degrees so here goes. Pleasantly Dark. Smell is rich and Carmelized sweet. Taste. Definitely not Russian so for us that's good. But the taste is not as sweet as smell. A dry chocolate. Thin in the mouth with a mid mouth carbonation bite but a smooth finish down the gullet. The taste is simple and not rich. Overall slightly disappointed hoping for more body but nothing to gripe about. Would order in A pub if all they had was Guinness and murphys and enjoy it but not in our top 25.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Had a bit of a ""medicine"" taste to it. Slightly improved as it warmed up to room temp but not too much. The feel... felt a bit thin.  I may purchase another ($3.99 for a 1 pint, 2.7 ounce bottle at local grocery store) and let it age a bit to see if this helps.

113,782,TheBeerMaster1,3.85,"A very nice stout. Very chocolatey and had a very smooth, chocolate milk like after taste. Had some caramel and molasses to it as well.

113,782,teromous,4.48,This is from one of the smaller narrow 12oz bottles.  Appearance: Black bodied beer with a small light brown head from the start that fades out to a ring and a film on the surface. It does impart some spotty lacing from the minimal ring of foam.  Aroma: There is a strong chocolate aroma along with what smells a bit like coffee. There is a spun-sugar aroma to the beer which is quite nice. It is a really nice smelling beer. It is actually very addictive. As the beer sits the scent of caramel comes through. This beer smells like a sweet shop.  Taste: It has a very rich dark caramel flavor with the flavor of dark chocolate and just a bit of carbon at the end. It is absolutely fantastic.  Mouthfeel: Despite the fullness of flavor and dark appearance this beer supports a medium-weight body. It has a good amount of carbonation and it is very drinkable.  Overall: This beer has a substantially lower mouthfeel and ABV than many other Imperial Stouts but it boasts a fantastic aroma and flavor that is sought after in a beer such as this. It really was very enjoyable to drink and I will seek it out again. I am really blown back by how good this beer is.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout was one of my early introductions to craft and stout, so I'd looked forward to trying this for years but had never come across it.

Feel- Medium to full bodied, light carbonation, and a creamy yet semi dry overall feel.  Overall- A 7% percent imperial stout is a unique thing to see, but regardless as a stout this is a great beer.

O – Fairly complex and enjoyable flavor profile, would like a little more bitterness for balance.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Mouthfeel is the strong suit, silky smooth and very chewy.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,ThaneMcC,4.09,"App - Pours like motor oil with brown head which resolves to fine brown lacing and minimal effervescent. Smell – roasted malts, burnt caramel, dried leaves, fresh wood shavings, dried figs/dates  Taste – malt forward, bittersweet with a lot of dark, dried fruits notes (prune/raisin), bready (rye), a lot of dry woodsy notes. Fairly clean finish with only a hint of residual sweetness (almost like a fig).  Mouthfeel – medium bodied (akin to 2%milk) with a fair amount of carbonation as it warms, dries the palate and leaves a bit of syrupy stickiness in the mouth (not unpleasant)  Overall: very good imperial stout, a complex blend of flavors that make it a good winter sipper, with less alcohol than other beers within this genre. I enjoyed it, though there are several great American RIS that I’d prefer (at a more reasonable price point!) My current fave is the Yeti imperial Stout – very similar in complexity with a sweeter profile, cleaner palate and a bit higher ABV.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

113,782,thegodfather1076,4.64,"Presentation: Nice label that has a very classic look and color scheme. Label gives a bit of brewery info, has an awesome eye-catching font, states “Fermented in stone Yorkshire Squares”, “1896 Gold Medal Winner International Brewers Exhibition” and “1930 Silver Medal Winner Brewers and Allied Traders International Exhibition and Market”. Gold foil wrapped neck and cap. Back label gives ABV info, brewery info, web info, and a nice description of the beer. Embossed on the bottle are “Samuel Smith” and “Bottled at Yorkshires oldest brewery est 1758”.  Appearance: An aggressive pour from its 550mL brown home into a 16oz Imperial Pint led to a thick creamy 4 finger cappuccino colored head atop a thick opaque black beer that lets no light through. Head retention was an amazing 6min 19sec before dissipating to a thick ring and 1 finger rocky coating with an amazing amount of lacing.  Smell/Aroma: Smell is of sweet dark fruits such as prunes or plums along with a bit of cooked molasses, slight coffee, and chocolate.  Flavor/Taste: Tastes of dark fruits and cooked down brown sugar and molasses with a bit of milk chocolate on the front end. Mid point becomes very roasty with a deep fresh roast coffee bean flavor along with a roast chocolate malt coming through. Back end again has a deep roast coffee bean flavor that becomes slightly smokey with a sweet milk chocolate taste for a nice balance. Finish and aftertaste is very roasty. Just phenomenal!!  MouthFeel/Drinkability: On the full side of medium bodied with a thick creamy mouthfeel that goes down smooth. Very drinkable brew!!  Overall/Comments: I have to say that this is one of the more impressive beers that I have had. Many RISs try to be so over the top with ABV and flavors that they become a bit overwhelming. Samuel Smiths Imperial Stout combines perfect ABV, flavor, and mouthfeel to make a must try beer! Classified as a Russian Imperial Stout @ 7% ABV.

113,782,ClavisAurea,4.25,"500ml bottle served in a snifter at fridge temps. No freshness date but was purchased in 12/2014.  Appearance: very dark brown with a nice and thick tan head. Fairly effervescent considering this is a low carbonation style. It was not as thick as some other examples of an imperial stout but was decent.  Smell: raisins, prunes, and other dark fruits, notably fruity (Ringwood yeast maybe), sugar plums. No alcohol, coffee, chocolate, dark malty character at all. Weird from an imperial stout with this pedigree.  Taste and Feel: pretty thin but very tasty, no alcohol at all, roasted character in the middle where I'd expect some classic stout chocolate or coffee notes would be, there is a roasted malt finish and the mouthfeel is rather dry for the style.  I have to say, this was not at all what I was expecting from a very classic imperial stout. Maybe it's because I'm used to the amped up American versions here in the states. I'm going to have to try to get a hold of some more classic English examples of this style to see if this is what it's supposed to be. I have another bottle that I'm going to try in a few months. Lets see if I can find a Courage RIS to try.  9/17/15 Re-review After a few months in the cellar all of the dried fruit flavors melded together to. Rate a very enjoyable beer. This is a nice palate calibrator for what an original Imperial Stout should taste like.

113,782,majorbase2,3.99,"Pours a very very dark (possibly black) color with a very large, thick, brown head. Not the best retention. Recedes leaving a small amount of lacing around the edges.  Aroma leads with milky chocolate. Very very sweet. A bit of dark fruit, most noticeably raisin. Chocolate really dominates here.  Taste is more of the same, although not necessarily in a bad way. Some notes of biscuity malts, a bit more of the dark fruits, with a hint of black licorice. Sweetness dominates. Once again, raisin is the most noticeable dark fruit. Honestly not as much going on in the taste as I had hoped.  Although I have been disappointed to this point, mouthfeel knocks it out of the park. Medium bodied, perfectly carbonated. Nice and creamy, goes down very smooth. The most easily downable Stout I've ever had.  Overall, I'm honestly a little disappointed in my first entry from Samuel Smith. Although they completely nail the sweet, milky chocolate in the taste, I wasn't moved by any other aspects of the taste. Still a good Stout, but not what I had hoped.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

113,782,Gajo74,4.66,"Pours a fine looking opaque black and viscous looking liquid. The head's color is even more intriguing; a frothy and bubbly tan head retains well as a sticky lace that reminds me of cappuccino foam. The aroma is unbelievable! Espresso, chocolate, banana or raisin bread and roasted malty sweetness. Taste has elements of sweet roasted malts, creamy coffee, and balanced by a slightly dry and very subtle bitter finish. Carbonation is lively on the tongue and settles as drink,gets warm. A full bodied drink; excellent to warm up to in cold weather and to eat with chocolates.

113,782,doktorhops,4.28,"Well, well, well Mr. Samuel Smith has an Imperial Stout, and judging by their other fine Ales this will no doubt turn out to be a world class example of said style... I’m going to enjoy this more than Fred Quimby’s nephew enjoying a clumsy Clouseau-esque French waiters pronunciation of the word “chowder” (its International Simpsons Reference Day by the way - D’oh!*).  Poured from a 355ml bottle into a Duvel tulip.  A: A deep foreboding black body greets me with a nice boisterous khaki 1cm head on top. It’s a damn fine looking Imperial Stout, or RIS† for short. 9/10.  S: More on the dark chocolate than coffee side with a large roasted malt body, brown sugar, woody notes, with a hint of earthy hops in the finish. As a traditional British RIS you know that this will be sweeter and less bitter than its American cousins - it’s not always about hops Doc! 8/10.  T: Wow! A tour de force of a classic RIS here! Upfront it is quite sweet (we expected that) with dark cacao, roasted barley, brown sugar and woody notes. It follows through to an earthy/herbal light bitter finish. What amazes with this excellent Stout is how the sugar content hits the goldilocks zone in your tongue, it is indeed “just right”. 9/10.  M: Mouthfeel adds to the rich tapestry of this RIS with a mid to heavy body, some nice and sticky viscosity and a light English pub carbonation. 7/10.  D: I could quite happily finish a night on a few of these bad boys... obviously not a good idea to begin a night out with any RIS - they can generally be anywhere upwards of 7% ABV (this one is 7%), however the ease with which this one goes down does beguile one into thinking that it’s not such heavyweight. Needless to say this one is going on my regular beer shopping list (at least until Plonk gets more FBS back in). 9/10.  Food match: Fits right into that 20th century slot after dessert but before brandy and cigars... I would pair it with a bold English cheese platter, then move on to gout.  *Fool! - there is no International Simpsons Reference Day, ha ha!  †The “R” is short for “Russian” comrade.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,T100Mark,4,"A real 12 ounce bottle (not a Euro-weenie bottle) poured into a shaker pint glass.  Appearance - A black, opaque brew. Dense, tan head. No stickage to speak of.  Smell - Toasty malt. Alcohol.  Taste - Roasted coffee. Alcohol. Sweet. Black licorice.  Mouth - Slick.  Overall - The alcohol in this beer, for some reason, is very prominent (more prominent than the 7% content would suggest). Because the alcohol is so prominent, this stout lacks the creamy smoothness that the genre is known for. I'm aware of the fact that the word ""Imperial"" suggests a high alcohol content but this beer taste more like a barley wine than a stout. This beer is not bad but it's not what I was hoping for.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,interzen,4.93,"355ml bottle poured into a Delerium Tremens tulip glass  Look: Pours black with a finger's worth of tan head. Poor head retention which leaves a small amount of lacing.  Smell: Quite sweet and woody with definite hints of dark fruit and liquorice - almost a medicinal edge to it.  Taste: The liquorice and fruit notes shine through here, along with dark roasted malts and a certain amount of hoppish bitterness. You'd expect something with a 7% ABV to have some alcohol notes but this doesn't. The medicinal woodiness definitely comes through in the aftertaste but manages to do so without dominating the other flavours.  Feel: Fairly 'thick' but without being excessively heavy. Surprisingly smooth, almost dangerously so.  Overall: An absolute stunner - I'm fortunate enough to live about 5 miles from the Sam Smiths brewery so this is fairly easy for me to get and a regular on my Beer Shelf. It's not really something you could have a session on, but the flavours and feel are such that it's extremely easy to knock a few of these back and get absolutely plastered in the process.

Roasted malts are pungent and wonderful.  Taste: Roasted malts and coffee, touch of bittersweet chocolate, and hints of toffee, raisin and smoke. The finish is long and Alcohol is present but not too strong, just to A marvelously complex beer!  Mouthfeel: Medium to thick body, creamy texture and almost syrupy with it how it clings to your mouth leaves a sweetness of the lips, but still light enough that its not a chore to polish off.  Drinkability: Yes, at 7% ABV, I could drink a bunch of these. I love sitting back and taking my sweet old time milking sipping down a bottle or two of this stuff.  Excellent tasting stout, Imperial though??, ABV should be higher to called Imperial.

Of course I am watching the Royals put on a clinic in the World Series game 6. All that notwithstanding, let's side pour with standard aggression this beer into a pint glass from the bottle.  Appearance - Just like you would expect, although it does have a nice three finger caramel colored head that lasts only for a minute or two and leaves little lacing. Deep chocolate brown coloring, cool packaging, everything I would expect from a world-class imperial stout.  Smell - As I poured this beer to take a picture of i t for my post on BA, I could actually smell the dark fruits and malts from several feet away when I went to pick up my camera. Roasted barley is also present in the nose, creating a strong, sensational olfactory experience. Raisins.  Taste - Like mothers milk. So smooth, deep and rich, its like drinking melted dark choclate ice cream, with beer and liquified dark fruits. Amazing. Intense raisin flavor makes for an incredible beer.  Mouthfeel - Smooth, creamy, rich. No alcohol bite.  Overall - This beer is raising the bar on beer like your loser brother raises his consciousness when he drops acid. This is probably the most amazing imperial stout I have ever had, it is so balanced, drinakable, and smooth. No amount of superlative speech can describe this brew.

Bottle chilled down to 36 degrees F in my beer cooler and poured in to a handled glass stein.  Pours a pitch black in color with a good 3-finger beige head that settles finally down to a 2mm head after about 20 mins of sipping on it. A good amount of sticky lacing is seen that clings all the way up the sides of the glass. The aroma is of roasted malts, dark fruit (plums?) with a hint of bittersweet chocolate. The taste has even more going on that starts out with the roasted malts at first, with a slight sweet raisin-like taste than ends with a hint of semi-sweet chocolate.

Khaki colored head with good lacing.  S - Strong chocolaty aroma with some toffee, roasted, and malty tones. The chocolate and roasted smells seem to stick out above the rest and swirl together to and mix well. There may seem to be some coffee tones but no alcohol present.  T - Tons of chocolate flavor that shines through but is mixed with the roasted/burnt flavor. It is some how complex and easy to dissect which makes this stout very tasty. Overall it is slightly sweet but it is balanced with the roasted character. Not as sweet or as chocolaty as Young's and it is a much better beer for it. . M - Moderate to high mouth-feel especially for being only 7%. Moderate carbonation which somewhat helps the beer not be cloying. It's not the heaviest or the lightest Imperial stout and it goes down very smooth.  Overall, this is a delicious ""imperial"" stout (i.e. imperial on flavor but not on buzz). Not my #1 imperial stout ever but is still very good with a tilt towards the chocolate side. I'd prefer the beer to be ever so slightly more balanced and with more booze but it's very good.

Lots of brown sugar, caramel, toffee and milk chocolate at the forefront, but can also detect many dark fruits like plums and raisins. Emphasis on the milk chocolate bit. Can't detect any hops and the English brewer's yeast is also imperceptible (which is to be expected; it's not a Belgian ale).  T: Taste follows the nose. Lots of dark malt leading to an obvious chocolatey flavor profile, but there's also a lot of raisins and plums that linger in the aftertaste. Rather, the initial taste is one of robust chocolate but this gives way to darker, sweeter fruit. Very nice and well balanced interplay of dark fruit and chocolate.  M: Nice.

113,782,chogm54,3.93,"355mL bottle purchased from a local imported beer store. Annoyingly noticed when I got home that the best before date was June 2013. Luckily the store had been storing the beer in almost cellar like conditions (cool, dark), so i decided to give it a go.  A - black, so black that its almost opaque. Pours a thin, brown head.  S - Whoomph! like christmas pudding - dark fruits and a strong port, mixed with liqourice. A bit overwhelming and hard to get away from.  T - sweet coffee with strong roasted malts coming in halfway. Earthy yeasts in the background. Slightly acidic aftertaste - Kind of like flat cola.  M - full and creamy body, low carbonination, feels rich and hearty.  O - very good, the coffee and roasted malts are very warming, and the mouthfeel is perfect for a stout. The smell put me off, as I am not an aniseed fan.

Time for a review of Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout after 6 years:  a: the beer still pours a thick opaque black although it has some sort of burgundy highlights near the bottom of the glass that I don't remember from before. Same beautiful tan head that fades leaving a thin coating on the top of the glass that lasts for the whole experience. very light carbonation is visible in the black depths.  s: really fragrant; port and alcohol are the predominant aromas; dark prunes and raisins are present as well; chocolate;  t: chocolate and raisins are the predominant tastes; the raisiny sweetness lingers while some more roasted/burnt flavors come into the sip; overall, very sweet and smooth with a good blend; a lot sweeter than i remember, but very, very well balanced  m: incredibly smooth with very, very mild carbonation; creamy and silky; this may be the area that has improved the most.  d: in my opinion, this beer has improved and mellowed with age and as it last lost some of those burnt notes, it has gained some great fruity notes and really found a warm spicy balance.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Bone53,3.74,"Poured from a bottle into a snifter at around 55°F  Appearance: Dark pour with a thin tan head. Black as can be with no light coming through.  Smell: Dark fruit, light roasted malt, classic SS yeast character  Taste: Nice balance of lightly roasted and subtle sweet malts, yeast, and bittering hops  Mouthfeel: light medium body, and watery for an imperial stout; Moderately bitter finish  Overall: I could see this being mind blowing before the existence of American craft beer, but now it seems weak in aroma, taste, mouthfeel, and abv for an imperial stout. I respect their tradition, but in this day and age they need to reclassify this as a regular stout and brew a real imperial. I dont even think this is a good value anymore at $5 for a 18.7 oz bottle. You're much better off grabbing a four pack of Old Rasputin or the like",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,archyquaffer,4.6,"I love the label on this beer- ornate, black and white, pictures of all their medals of yore, and includes a variation on the Yorkshire rose symbol. It looks like something straight out of the 19th century.  Poured from a 18.7 ounce narrow necked bottle into a shaker pint. A moderate pour produces about 2 inches of frothy, billowing sticky and semi-stiff head. The beer is very dark brown, bordering on black. When I drink a little down and fill it up again, the last ounce or two causes the head to billow up again.  I get a lovely sweet mineral and malt aroma right off the bat- best beer aroma ever. Tons of complexity are evident in the flavor-aromas, including distinct dark cherry, chocolate, plum, coffee, nut, chocolate, and a slight leafy note reminiscent of celery. A fruity, spicy tang is quite apparent, particularly when you draw the foam off the top. This lightly sweet tang lingers into the aftertaste to balance some bitterness. Bitterness is relatively low in comparison to a stout brewed in the U.S., but it is subtle, and complements and even draws forth the malt flavors rather than hiding or overwhelming them. Not as chewy as many stouts are, and completely lacking in the over-the-top hop or extremely bitter, stale, burnt coffee flavors found in some American stouts.  I think yeast and mineral water are doing some unique things here. I wonder what chorus of little, beneficial bugs inhabit those Yorkshire squares? It's interesting to note, as I found out with a little online searching, that the Yorkshire Square process developed from early 18th century research on the absorption of gases into liquids. These squares are made of slate, which is known for its thermal stability and chemical inertness.  This is a classic and very accessible beer, and perhaps the best beer available in my area (and actually kinda cheap!). It is very unique and complex, and should be savored. I gotta remember to load up on this at Christmastime. Cheerio!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

113,782,LambicPentameter,4.09,"Enjoyed out of a 16.9 oz bottle with gold foil concealing the neck and cap and no bottling date that I can discern. Poured into a 50 cL glass stein with a textured exterior. A listed ABV of 7% reveals in interesting juxtaposition between this beer's name and the ever-increasing use of ""Imperial"" in modern parlance to mean above 7.5% alcohol. I've had this many times in the past, but decided to finally record my enjoyment for posterity (or something).  Appearance - A moderately aggressive pour yields a two-finger head the color of mocha tan, dense and creamy looking, with lots of microbubbles and a meringue-like surface until some pocking starts to show. Beneath the pie topping head sits a body of jet black, hinting at shades of dark taupe when held immediately in front of the light. Head retains for a bit before slinking down and settling as a thick film across the surface, leaving silky, but short-lived sheets of lace that fade away completely after awhile.  Smell - A rich blend of roasted malt and bittersweet chocolate notes along with dark, dried fruit and licorice. To me, the most dominant elements are the roasted component and licorice--the other aromas are mere complementary players. Dark fruit comprised of dates, prunes, but fleeting and mostly overpowered by the strong roasted notes, bordering on char.  Taste - Pleasantly bitter baker's chocolate and more roasted malt, like burnt toast are the standard-bearers for the flavor. There is a slight malty sweetness at first with each sip, but it quickly makes way for a more lingering espresso-like bitterness. Not much--if any--in the way of hop characteristics, which is just fine by me. To my palate, a generous presence of hops can confuse the flavor for this style.  Mouthfeel - Chewy and luscious medium-to-heavy body with moderate, creamy carbonation and a slightly viscous mouthfeel. Lingering bitterness in the aftertaste.  Overall, a fantastic beer from an English brewery that I just love. Proof positive that a Russian Imperial Stout doesn't need loads of alcohol content to have tons of flavor and interest-generating potential. And this one is great in that the whole is more than the sum of its parts. It's a wonderful thing that you can just go to most respectable beer stores and grab this one off the shelf. In fact, you should do it if you haven't.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Taste: first comes dark chocolate, than coffee, which is a bit acidic, than average roastiness. Malty, rather sweet and averagely bitter.

113,782,CalgaryFMC,4.24,"Poured from a classic Samuel Smith's bottle into a goblet. I am a major advocate of this brewery, appreciating the unique yeast and diacetyl character of their brews as well as the malt complexity. This is probably one of the top Russian imperial stouts in the world, providing a supreme balance of deep, rich malt flavors, sweetness, and perhaps surprisingly prominent hop flavors, hitting all these targets without going out of balance. Pours a Stygian opaque black with a few reddish highlights here and there, with ample rich tan foam. Releases an assertive admixture of buttery, chocolate, coffee, roast barley, and toasty aroma notes, roughly in that order. Tastes of chocolate brownie, caramel sauce, freeze-dried coffee crystals, plums, smoked corn husk, light rum, wood, Samuel Smith house yeast and earthy, grassy hops with maybe a hint of citrus rind. Incredible complexity of flavor with the expected heavy, thick body and low to moderate carbonation. The alcohol burn is there but less harsh and astringent than some American examples of the style. I appreciate the refined and measured approach to a ""big beer"" and this epitomizes that ideal.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Overall the sweetness and bitterness battle throughout the entire glass. All of these wonderfully complexities sit against a smokey, woody backdrop.  Mouthfeel: Creamy and smooth. Nearly a full bodied brew.  Overall: Bow down to this classic. I put one in the cellar, plan on trying with a year on it, but this one is remarkable fresh.

Thick foam with bubbles in size up to about 1/16th of an inch. Head retention is excellent. Most of the lacing is oily but a bit of sticky lacing on the sides is forming as head slowly recedes. The lacing that is left is very sticky. Reflective light reveals about as dark a brown as you can get, almost black. Light shining through the beer reveals only the slightest amount of light passing through the beer and it is a dark red color. S: Lots of burnt malt and sugars. Dark fruit(s) raisin, plum. Coffee. Chocolate. Bittering hops. Alcohol. Oak like burned wood taste very faintly in the background. Very rich. Expectations are high. T: The smell does not reveal the way this ale tastes. The ordering of the flavors is different than the ordering of the smell. Coolio! Burnt malt, sweetness, chocolate, hops, dark fruit, raisin, plum. Finishes with a very nice bittering hops profile and the taste of the way a burned out campfire of oak wood smells. A very dry finish and very bitter with an interesting burned wood sort of taste. Its like the smoky taste of a very nice scotch without all the afterburn from alcohol to cover it up. Wow. M: Very medium bodied and and creamy. Finish feels rather thin and very dry. A little bit of warming from the alcohol. O:Incredibly complex and very well blended in an unusual way. I want another quaff to see what else I can find in it. Smiles. Very robust. Complex.

Smells a bit like a dark wine with hops added. A complex smell that makes my mouth water.  Tastes of Cognac or dark grape juice, just a subtle hop bitterness, slight coffee flavor, sweetness only in the aftertaste. Flavors don't follow the nose completely, which adds complexity. Alcohol is well hidden. Nicely balanced.  Mouthfeel is a strong medium. Nicely carbonated. Flavors are forward on the tongue. There is no alcohol burn on the throat.  This is a very complex, nuanced, flavorful beer worthy of praise. I am enjoying this more as time goes by. As it warms the wine flavors are reduced and more dark fruit and yeast flavors come forward. The hop flavors are not as prominent as I expected, the roast subtle, they yeasts are not overpowering, and thought I get a nice warm feeling the alcohol flavors are well suppressed.

A: pours a lovely black, opaque hue  S: Fruit forward aroma of dark wine, raisins, caramel, toasted barley, and wood combine to awaken the senses  T: Complex notes of sweet, rich malts with an ever so slightly charred alcohol flavor reminiscent of dark wine and toffee or licorice  M: A balanced medium body that carries smoothly across the palate and has a slightly dry finish  O: A great stout!

Nose offers deep roasted barley aromas, chocolate, molasses, some dark fruit, and a hint of hops.  Taste also goes heavy on roasted notes, some dark chocolate, mild sweetness, a bit of charred bitterness and a long aftertaste.  Nice body on this one. Not overly thick, just enough to stand up to the flavors and modest ABV.

113,782,SerialTicker,4.25,"$3.29 for a single at my bottle shop, but I really wanted a big stout that I hadn't had before... I went with this.  Appearance: Poured with an awesome brown head on it that eventually died down to a silky looking film on top. The beer itself looks black, but has a lot of ruby to it when held up to light.  Smell: Dark fruits. Dark chocolates. A bit of alcohol. Maybe even black licorice to an extent. Just a lot of roasty character.  Taste/feel: A relatively thick mouthfeel, but probably somewhat thin for the style is the first thing I notice. Then the flavor of a somewhat tart dark fruit comes through, followed by a very pleasant roast aftertaste. Most RISs I've had have a huge alcohol profile with a ton of warmth, an oily mouth feel, a pretty intense warmth, and so on -- given that this ""Imperial"" stout is only 7%, I don't get much of that at all... maybe that's why I like it so much. It's a big stout, but it's one that I could probably actually enjoy two of. With pretty much any other RIS, I'm more than fine after having just one because they usually feel so heavy.  The price is kind of steep on this beer, but it's pretty exceptional. For my preferences, this may be the best Russian Imperial Stout that I've ever had. At the same time, I'd probably pick other options more often just because this one's (fairly significantly) more expensive. Must try.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

A - Good looking beer, dark brown almost black with a nice brown head that starts at 2 finger sbut then dissipates down to almost nothing.  S - Mostly red wine. Some dark roasted malts in there.  T - Again a lot of red wine. Dark and roasted malts. Coffee, Espresso. Dark Fruits.  M - light - medium mouthfeel, I missed the thick body of the American RIS's. Alcohol is there (but it shouldn't be at 7%). Leaves a roasted/red wine aftertaste.  O - For a Russian Imperial Stout this is pretty one-dimensional. A lot of red wine flavor but not much of anything else.

The pour was smooth and everything you come to expect from the style, just that taste wasn't there for me. Personally I thought this beer was a bit light for an Imperial stout. I was expecting something a bit more... flavorful. I also thought mine was a bit over carbonated, but that could just be my bottle. It does leave though a very pleasure after taste of some sweet coffee notes. Overall, I thought it was a decent beer, but as fair as imperial stout goes, I wouldn't be picking this one for my first choice.  Drink more beers!

113,782,Fatehunter,3.83,"Poured into an imperial pint glass. Almost three fingers of tan head... a bit much, on a black body. Looks great though. The aroma is a strong roasted malt and with a touch of burnt malt. The taste has strong bitter coffee, roasted malt and a bit of milk to mild it out. A nice bold profile. The texture is crisp thickness with moderate carbonation. Pretty solid.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

The scent reminds me of molasses, sorghum and caramel malt. A little sweetness in the nose theres a soy-like aroma that's a bit off putting.

How long has this been sitting on the shelf at my local beer store?  T: It starts out sweet with roasted malt, caramel, and toffee.

The finish is more lacto and toffee.  M: Full bodied beer. This one has some good heft. It's coating but not syrupy. The flavors seem to be ok (minus that brutal sourness). I'm actually a bit taken aback by the toffee notes in this beer.  O: Not a fan. The off flavors really ruin this beer. I hope it's just a bad bottle, but who knows.

The appearance is quite attractive, with a dark amber brown color and ample off-white head, and loads of lacing in the small globe glass. The flavor continues on the strange trip. It makes me think of prune juice, with the same sweet and tart flavors. Not that sweet, but dark and fruity. I can't get that smell out of my mind, it's back with every sip.

I have no complaints other than a slightly underwhelming carbonation presence and it getting a little watery as it warms, but that's me being annoying. one of the best sam smith beers, which is definitely saying something.  edit: on tap at one of the brewerys pubs in london, this was really impressive, smoother and richer in feel than i recall from the bottle, and somehow drinking stronger than its listed abv, which on a chilly and grey london day, seemed more than welcome. great stout, probably better and better the closer you get to the source...",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Licorice, dark fruit, roast malt, chocolate, and floral hops form the initial aroma. Notes of soy, tar, acetone, and light medicinal phenols add complexity. Dark cherry and vinous tones are surprising, as well as minerally qualities.  Flavor reveals acetone, vinous, dark cherry, minerally undertones initially, which fade to rich roast malt and dark chocolate mid palate, with light char surfacing in the finish, adding slight bitterness. The malt profile is truly rich.  Body is fairly full, with low carbonation and soft alcohol warmth.  Not what I recall from this brew. The vinous, minerally, and soy characteristics must've eluded me in the past. Either that, or I got an odd bottle. Great malt character, though. Not overly bitter, by any stretch, nor overly sweet.

Two finger thick light tan colored head with foamy bubbles. Excellent lacing on the sides. The head is probably a bit off colored and has less retention than i would expect from a RIS.  Aroma is of burnt up dark roasted malts. Some dark chocolate and very little coffee. Strength is just fine.  Taste is what makes this brew great. Solid burnt up bitter malt taste. Lot of roasted malts. Good bitterness overall. Some bittering hops as well. Coffee and chocolate are secondary flavors.  Mouth feel is medium to thick bodied. Moderate carbonation. Drinks better with a little warmth. No alcohol presence. Astringency is mainly due to bitterness of dark roasted malts. Excellent character.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,WissBrauSean,4.42,"And yes my favourite brewery gets points for using bottles that I can bottle my beer with! Tasteful label and I do dig their symbol as well.  The beer pours a deep black with a one finger brown head that fades to a solid cap on the beer with Charlie Brown Halloween ghost costume heads of lacing on the side of my glass mug. Pretty cool!  Cherries seem to be up front in the aroma, slightly acidic or astringent, raisins and definitely malts, but not much in the way of roasted malt.  I poured this beer too cold. I needed to let is sit out of the fridge longer. So here are a list of flavours associated with this beer, not in any particular order and surprisingly, no one really more predominant than the other, but in this order of appearance: Dark Roasted malt, dark chocolate, cherries, raisins, bread, vanilla, cherries, roasted malt and then finally bittering hops followed by licorice and a hop dryness. Like I said, none more overwhelming than the other and only the lingering hop bitter stays. It's very well balanced.  It has a smooth and creamy mouthfeel and is most definitely full bodied, but not syrupy. The carbonation is moderate or a hair under and the finish is dry, but not overly so.  I love this beer! There is a tartness that I associate with the cherry flavours that I am not overly fond of. I'm not sure of the origins, but there is good reason why this is truly a world class beer! The complexity along with the balance alone is astonishing. If you don't like a bitter finish, you will probably want to stay away from this beer as it seems accentuated by the dark roasted malts. For the style, I am giving this beer high 4s out of 5! Superb!  Like I said, this beer is not for all beer drinkers. It is bitter, but not enough to turn me away. Although drinking two of these in a row might be a challenge for me. Really, the only way to know it to take that leap and check it out! If you know the style is not to your liking already, so be it. You can always convince your publican to give you a taster. Just get out there. Try new beer!

113,782,Sludgeman,3.89,"Reviewed this beer on June 22, 2020. Drank this one at a beach condo in Hilton Head. Purchased at Total Wine/Midlothian, VA for $3.14. Poured into a medium rocks glass.  The dried fermented fruit flavors dominate this beer. Unlike other RIS’ that, in my opinion, are more malty and hoppy. A beautiful pour but a bit too astringent for me. 4.0  A - Pours opaque black with a two-finger creamy tan/khaki head. Minor lacing. 4.25  S – Aromas of dark dried fermented fruits, vinous qualities, a clean almost medicinal undertone, roasted malts but not burnt or bitter in the aroma. 4.0  T - Prunes and dates with roasted bitter malts. Hints of fruity sweetness but otherwise overwhelmed by the fermented fruit and maltiness. Some tobacco. Hints of citrusy lemon. 3.75  MF - Medium bodied. Thin for an RIS.

113,782,smokinyodas,4.36,"Samuel Smith’s Imperial Stout is true to the name and style. As you would guess this Stout has the depth you would come to expect: bitter dark chocolate and extra burnt coffee with hints of dark fruits that balances out to one mighty flavorful winter drink.  The deep smells of roasted barley, chocolate, hops and yeast are intoxicating. The mouth feel is clean and creamy with hints of mineral rich water. With that said however, unlike many of the other Samuel Smith beers that are well balanced, this one is only a sipping beer for me because the bold flavor alone makes it hard for me to enjoy more than once in a beer session.

Rings of lacing, and a quick experience of cascade as it pours.  S- Chocolate, and strong espresso bitterness. I sense a slight metallic aroma as well (like most Samuel Smith's.) Iron-rich water?  T- Some chocolate, some coffee, no metallic taste. Slight hop balance. Not as flavorful as I would expect from an imperial, but a well crafted brew.  M- Full-bodied but smooth and clean. A little bit of a dry finish.  O- A quality beer, but I don't think I can consider it ""Imperial."" A moderate ABV, and a mild flavor base makes it just seem like a stout.

It has a good bit of Russian Imperial Stout flavor, but then also a creaminess almost like a porter.  It has a medium body with a good carbonation.  For an Russian Imperial Stout , this is really drinkable as it cuts off at the end. I would recommend it as an entry into the style.

I don't get any roasted or char aromas which is a bit disappointing.  T - Similar to the nose, heavy fruit flavor with the slightest roast and chocolate coming through in the middle. I do like the dry bitterness finish but wish this RIS balanced the fruit, chocolate and roast better.  M - Very drinkable, the best feature of this beer is how smooth it goes down.

113,782,rand,4.37,"From 500 mL bottle to snifter  A: Typical stout complexion and color - dark brown-to-black, completely opaque, coffee-tan head. Head retention is fairly light as the head dissipates in a few minutes and leaves a couple patches of lacing around the glass. Not the most viscous-looking stout you'll come across.  S: The nose is malt-forward, with distinct notes of ripe fruit - particularly cherries and plums - and anise. Some carob and Swiss chocolate linger, along with a touch of earthy hop astringency.  T: The flavors largely follow with the sweet aspects of the carob and ripe fruit touching the palate first. Chocolate notes become more distinct as the beer warms, along with the alcohol. The flavor-profile is well balanced and smooth, from beginning to end, as none of the various tones take precedence. Finishes relatively long leaning toward the sweet-side of the palate.  M: Creamy and velvety...smooth and more viscous than it appeared. Ample carbonation keeps the rich complexion from sticking to the palate between sips  After drinking a lot of barrel-aged monster-stouts from the West side of the Atlantic, it's interesting coming back to this classic. Nothing tastes like it, and it has a lot of the creamy, chewy qualities that their American brethren only pick up from the aging process.

Dark roasted malts. Dark fruit raisins prunes. Extreme. Molasses.  Taste is outrageous old bitter sweet candies that are well-balanced. But I like the black licorice prunish flavor bursting through.

113,782,superspak,3.66,"550 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 5/10/2012. Pours fairly pitch black color with a nice 1-2 finger dense tan head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big apple, raisin, dark chocolate, brown sugar, roasted malt, toast, dark bread, light coffee, light char, and herbal earthiness. Decent aromas with some good complexity; but the fruity aromas are a bit too overpowering, something went wrong with this bottle. Taste of dark chocolate, roasted malt, toast, toffee, brown sugar, dark bread, coffee, light char, raisin, and earthiness. Lingering notes of dark chocolate, roasted malt, toast, brown sugar, dark bread, coffee, toffee, light char, raisin, and earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance, robustness, and complexity of roasted malt flavors; with a good amount of balanced fruity complexity; and hardly any cloying flavors present after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very creamy, lightly slick, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a nice imperial stout style. Good balance and robustness of roasted flavors; and very smooth to sip on. A nicely enjoyable offering; despite the obvious flaws with this particular bottle.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

113,782,Chaney,4.23,"Ticking my way through the ""Beers of Fame"" list. Sam Smith REALLY need to get rid of those clear bottles.  Served in an Olde Hickory glass.  A: No light passing through this rat bastard. Black as night, with a peppery whipped cream-like head on top of that ink.  S: Sam Smith profile through and through. I might best describe it as pureed raisons with added dark chocolate.  T: Much more fruity than most Imperial Stouts out there. I'll stick strongly with my raison observation. Dark, semi-sweet chocolate in the middle, but then the dark fruit comes back.  M: Absolutely ridiculous lacing, with a low-moderate carbonation bill. EXTREMELY drinkable!  O: Pretty awesome stuff.

113,782,BedetheVenerable,3.4,"Presentation: 18.7 oz. 'Victorian Pint' brown glass bottle; nice, 'antique'-looking label. If I've deciphered the date code correctly, I believe this was bottled March 19th, 2012. Sadly, that's as fresh as we can usually get Sam Smith's in the States, but for this style of brew, that's not so bad honestly. Into my Black Sheep imperial pint.  Appearance: Obsidian-black beer with hints of brown around the edges when held up to the light. Nice medium-tan cap with pretty nice stick.  Smell: A bit unusual. No real roast, char, etc, but rather some musty apple and perhaps the slightest hint of chocolate.  Taste: Very much an English take on the style. Begins estery (apples and vinous dark fruit) before turning lightly roasty (chocolate malt, I think?) in the middle, with a bit of toast as well. Mild notes of char on the firm, bitter finish, with those apple-and-red-wine flavors that we started out with.  Mouthfeel: Every bit of 7%, and really seems a bit bigger than that. Smooth and creamy.  Overall: Overall, this is probably a somewhat better beer than this review suggests. I'm perfectly fine with the English style of RIS as opposed to the American variety. My main issue here is that this is a bit weak in the aroma department (precious little other than green apples) and that the fruity (and especially, apple) flavors significantly overshadow the malt and roasted flavors that, for me, need to be a bit more forward. I'd say that perhaps this beer's just suffering from age, but at just under a year old, this shouldn't be the case. At arond $4.00 a bottle, this is worth picking up once in awhile, but I wouldn't likely have it in my regular rotation.  83-B",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Alcohol is warming but not overdone.  M: Medium-bodied with low carbonation - a great sipper.  Absolutely delicious - I love the fact that the sweetness is so restrained - it doesn't have to be an after-dinner beer.

113,782,gr0g,3.71,"550ml bottle poured into a Samuel Smith pint glass. Impenetrably black in color with a nice, fat head that's about three fingers tall and leaves a fair amount of lacing. At 7%ABV, Sam Smith's Imperial Stout is diminutive compared to most current examples of the style, and the aroma reflects this. Molasses, licorice, and charred malt are among the many great aromatic notes present, but they're all too faint.  The same is true for the flavor, but in this case it's more forgivable because there's great balance and drinkability. It's quite possible to finish an entire pint, and enjoyable to boot. Great roast character, and good amounts of of bittersweet chocolate, molasses, and toffee. Nicely balanced between sweet/dry with a bitter finish. The mouthfeel is nice and weighty but could stand to be creamier.  Samuel Smith Imperial Stout is not a great RIS, but it's still a great stout. Flavorful and light enough to be paired with food without being overwhelming.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

113,782,mfnmbvp,4.3,"550 ml (1 pint) bottle poured into a Boulevard tulip glass. No bottled on date, just a code stamped on the side, which I'm not about to look up.  A - About as black as we can get it. No light shines through. The vaguest mocha colored foam disappeared within seconds of pouring. Tiny bit of alcohol wisping on the sides.  S - Raisins. Dark fruit. Alcohol. Whiskey barrels. This brew smells pretty intense.  T - Again, raisins, dark fruit, alcohol. Roasted coffee bean flavor. Tastes like some type of alcohol that I tried when I was a kid, as the taste seems to reverberate somewhere deep within my subconscious mind. I think the taste might remind me somewhat of this 18 year old bottle of Hermes Glogg that I drank last summer with some friends, which had fermented berries and nuts floating around in it, and which we all ate. Definitely some type of roasted fermented nut and dark fruit flavors are the main attraction of this beer.  M - Mouthfeel is wonderful. All the complex, subtle flavors of this brew seem to linger around for you to savor the taste of them all for a while. This is definitely one of the best stouts I have ever had, and like others have said before me, at $3.99 a bottle, this beer is so ridiculously underpriced, what are you waiting for? Pick a bottle of this up. Beers that aren't half this good are sold for twice as much money.  Overall, one of the most impressive stouts I've ever tried, and I was very impressed with the Samuel Smith's Organic Chocolate Stout also, as it was probably the best beer I've had to date. Therefore, I can't really urge you enough to go and pick up some of these fabulous beers so you can agree with me as well, because in my opinion, the fact that a 4 dollar bottle of imported beer can resemble the taste of an 18 year old bottle of wine is pretty epic in itself.

Smell: Alcohol initially... but then bread, touch of banana, hint of coffee...BEER.  Taste: Categorically, I'm not a fan of imperial stout's. THIS is by far my favorite example of the variety. While squarely an imperial stout, it has wonderful characteristics shared by some of the best Belgian quad's I've ever had. Subtle banana and bread, with the addition of coffee, none of which get overpowered by the elevated ABV. Very well balanced.  M: Parks itself firmly on the tongue. 'nuff said. Wonderful.

Taste was very smooth with the blend of the fruits that faded into the coffee characters. A little burnt wood, earthy note to close out. Nice subtle hop aftertaste to keep you coming back for more. Feel was a bit light for a RIS. A bit on the watery side, but this improved as the beer warmed. Overall- I had heard great things about Samuel Smith and it didn't disappoint.

Kind of fruity at first, with plums and raisins, then some burnt woody flavors and bittersweet chocolate. Body is only moderate for a stout, it could stand to be a little thicker or creamier.  O: A great, rich, flavorful stout. Loses a little bit on the body/mouthfeel but otherwise this is just all around tasty.

Does have an odd smell that's appealing in the same regard. Maybe treacle or old dusty wood. Seems to have some wood character but I'm not even sure if this was aged in barrels or not.

Super fruity. Lingering alcohol on the back. Hints of vanilla and something that reminds me of oak, but it can't be. Mild earthiness buried in the back. Chocolate malts. Loads of roasted barley. Vague sense of minerals from the water. Soy sauce.  Taste: Roasted. Sharp snap of cocoa and burnt malt. Some minor sweetness. Roasted barley. Chocolate edge is so bitter it's almost acrid. Mineral. Rocks and some sense of earthy hops. Some dark fruit (mostly cherry) mixed with soy sauce and some caramelized sugars. Vaguely nutty. Burnt and sweet as it warms. So much barley.  Mouthfeel: Significantly thinner than I would expect. Carbonation is high and contributes to a body that runs on the light side of medium. Lingering dryness.  Overall: Are we sure this is imperial?

There is a little brown sugar, figs and raisins giving a fruity flavour to the middle of the beer with the finish being quite chocolatey again.

Aromas begin with chocolate and roasted malts for the most part, with some definite dark fruit notes. As it warms you get hints of toffee and perhaps a little bit of caramel.  The tastes begin with roasted barley maltiness with touches of unsweetened chocolate and caramel. As it warms you get some slight fruity undertones in the background.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Finish is semi-dry with a typical English yeast fruity, metallic twang in the finish.  Overall this is a good example of an English style Imperical Stout. It was not very robust and would not stand up against some of the other heavyweights in its style.

Fig and Madeira finish and roasty charred linger. Medium edging towards light even, creamy, some chew.  This looked a little thin coming out of the bottle and the nose was alarmingly sweet.

It oozed with smooth creaminess. It even sounded creamy. Having a hard time getting a good gauge on the body color due to low lighting.  S: Licorice, molasses, and dark chocolate. Some dark fruit. Sorta reminds me of rum-soaked cake.  T: A lot of the aroma comes through in the palate but the dark fruit stands out a bit more. There’s a little roastiness in there, but not as much as you would expect from a RIS. I’m not 100% sure I know what cocoa nibs taste like, but this is what I imagine it to be.  M: It’s a little bit watery compared to how thick it appeared to pour, but that helps the drinkability. Finishes a bit dry and chalky...nothing new for an English ale. Carbonation is dialed in nicely as it adds a creamy texture rather than a fizzy thin feel.  O: More complex than rich.

The backend is smooth and creamy with a hint of molasses or licorise.Flavorful yes and different then today's standard hop driven imp. stoudts. Maybe thats what people are thinking about.

Rich roasted malt flavors with a heavy backdrop of chocolate and smoke. Raisin undertones. Very subtle, floral-like notes round out the mouthfeel. Bitter but so smooth and silky. Mouthfeel is bliss -- medium-heavy with a creaminess that dries down nicely.

The aroma consists of banana, honey, sorghum, chocolate, and roasted malt. The mouthfeel is full, smooth, thick, but not viscous, and compliments the beer very nicely. Flavors of honey and banana up front. Sorghum appears second and never dissipates. Rather, it bitters with the expression of the hop alpha acid. Some sweetness still occurs as the beer cascades down the sides of the tongue. There's just the least little bit of that liquid medicine flavor that keeps this beer from being perfect.

This retains with a nice looking thin creaminess, leaving back a thick cascade of lacing that hangs in sticky rings around the sides of the glass. The aroma smells of coffee, chocolate, toffee, ripe earthy citrus, dark fruit and just a smidge of alcohol. This has a nice smoky twang in the nostrils.  The taste is more of the same, with smoky roasted coffee flavor, dark fruit, chocolate, tangy caramel notes and earthy green citrus. The overall flavor profile here is equal parts ripe stickiness and bitter roast on the palate. This is dry and burnt feeling on the finish. The mouthfeel is fuller to full bodied, with some crispness on the tongue that then gives way to a big chewy thickness that fills the mouth. The alcohol presence is very well hid, with just a touch of spicy dryness that lingers on the tongue a bit after each sip.  This is one of those beers that after you finally have it, you wonder where it’s been the whole time! This was just a really nice take on an English Imperial Stout with a well balanced complexity to it and a solid chewy feel in the mouth that feels bitter than its only 7% ABV.

This beer has all of the flavor notes that a straight-up Imperial Stout should have, only in more balance and subtlety than in most renditions of the style. You've got roasted coffee aromas, dark chocolate aromas, notes of blackcurrant, and a vanilla bean component.  The taste follows the nose. There's lots of brown malts here, supplemented by roasted notes. More chocolate and vanilla than coffee on the palate. Dark fruits on the back end.  The mouthfeel is quite full and creamy for a 7% ABV beer. There are American IPAs (not even Double IPAs) that have more alcohol than this beer, but aren't as full in the mouth. Overall, this is a lovely beer. A staple of the style.  Pro-tip: drink this beer with creme brulee.

Plenty of dark fruit along with coffee and dark chocolate. Roasted malt is prominent but not close to being overpowering. Some earthy hops also sneak through which is a little odd for a RIS but works really well here. The finish is clean and crisp, not at all sweet and sticky.  This is one of my all-time favorite beers. While it is on the light side for an Imperial Stout, it packs tons of flavor and is incredibly drinkable. I could really have a couple of these in a sitting without tiring of the flavor.

113,782,fountainofyouth,3.49,"Poured from a 16.9 oz bottle into a pint glass. Before I even comment on the categories above, I just want to say the beer SOUNDS good -- like pouring a fresh bottle of wine.  Appearance: HUGE light brown head and deep, impenetrably brown body.  Smell: It kinda smells like wine too, like a chocolate wine. Not totally in a good way -- too much booze. Besides the booze is sweet brown malt and no discernible hops.  Taste: The taste definitely follows the nose, although slightly more pleasantly so. It is a bit ""grapey."" There's a good mix of dark barley, plenty of sugar, a little booze, and maybe a hint of English hops. Nice, but not mindblowing.  Mouthfeel: It's got a good, full feeling and a good dose of carbonation. The alcohol is warm, but not hot, and kinda trails into the back of the mouth.  Overall: It didn't really have the depth I wanted. It's good, but I feel like it's trying to mimic to the flavor palette of oak-aged stouts too much.

S: Huge dark fruits in this beer, more than any imperial stout I've ever smelled. It smells more like a quad to me. Underneath that, I get toffee and a bit of roast. I also get some nuttiness from the typical English yeast I'm used to from Samuel Smith's.  T: This is like three different beers up front, in the middle, and in the aftertaste - very complex and interesting. The English yeast is much more apparent here, particularly at the front of the beer. I get quite a bit of nuttiness and a bit of sour up front. This quickly turns to roasted malts, prunes, and dark chocolate. The finish is all smoke and dark chocolate. Very interesting and tasty, but I find myself wanting a bit more flavor, probably from being used to the American versions of this style. No hint of ABV.  M: Medium bodied with fairly creamy carbonation. Above average.  O: This is a very interesting beer. Like I said when explaining the taste, it's almost like three separate beers. I'm generally not a fan of the yeast Samuel Smith's uses (and I'd still like to try this beer with a different yeast), but I like this beer quite a bit.

113,782,TheBrewo,3.97,"We pour a brew of jet black. It holds a one finger tall light brown head of creamy bubbles. This retains only lightly, leaving cakey, spotty lacing around the glass, and a massive bubble aggregate to the center of the liquid. No sediment is noted, and carbonation appears average. The aroma begins with sour, bittering malts, with deep roast, char, and black chocolates. Booze, vinegar, and salt make this a characteristically Sam Smith nose. Syrupy molasses and toffee sweetness help to cut, with a sticky brown rum cake coming forth with warmth. Our first impression is that this is very Sam Smith in the flavoring as well, with big souring grain. As we sip, licorice bite and cooked caramel sugars start us off. Chalky malts, with a further souring, but drying bite mix in. This sourness enhances towards the peak, with char, chocolate, and a quick wash by a paler sheet of malts. This stops the darkness of the flavoring quite abruptly. The finish is with souring acidic vinegar, roasted malts, and some metallic coffee bean. A very mild hop balance comes in the form of grass, but more salt and seaweed quickly overwhelm the rest of the taste buds. The aftertaste breathes of sour lactics, coconut husk, and a smoked meatiness. The body is medium, and the carbonation is light to medium. The feel to each sip is silky smooth, with some chalky and metallic astringent dryness. T is nice cream and froth to each sip, with a satisfying puckering pop. The abv is appropriate, and the beer drinks more quickly than the average Russian imperial.  Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the aroma, especially when it started to warm. The sweetness really started to flourish at that point, emphasizing the rather complex grain bill. In the end, however, we couldn’t escape the standard souring malty twinge of any classic Sam Smith beer, which made it seem a little generic. That aside, the flavoring was executed nicely, and the beer was delicious, but we were just hoping for a little more variety, and something a bit more memorable, from such a great brewery.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Update 5/31/12 Had another to verify, this time comparing directly to my current favorite, Tyranena Dirty old Man (not a double stout, I know). The SS didn't hold up as well against the complexity of the TDOM. Downgrading my previous 4.7 rating.  However, the problem may have been serving it at cellar temp. Last time I had it around 50-degrees and flat out loved it.  Update 8/2/12 Having now had several tastes of true imperial stout greatness (Peruvian Morning, Mikkeller Black Hole, Mokha), I have to downgrade even further.

113,782,ThisWangsChung,4.5,"Re-review! Poured into a Sam Smith pint glass.  A: Pours a borderline pitch black color that does a good job of obscuring the light. I love the quality of the head, it's a two finger mocha color featuring wonderful frothy thickness and impressive retention.  S: It smells more like a good Pinot Noir than a RIS in my opinion - and yes, that's a compliment. There's a fantastic fruity depth to it, loaded with raisins, figs, black currants, ripened grapes, plums, and cherries. Beneath the the melange of fruit lies a subtle undercurrent of chocolate.  T/M: This doesn't have the robust roast profile of other imperial stouts. Instead, the dark fruits from the smell immediately make themselves apparent on the tongue. Has a wonderful vinous quality to it. The fruity opening provides nice complexity as the dark fruit and lighter fruit constantly battle for dominance on the palate, with one never overpowering the other - almost reminscient of a good Belgian ale. Chocolate and caramel appear on the midtaste. The finish is vinous with slight dryness/bitterness which does a fantastic job of complementing the initial silky smoothness. Through the progression of the beer, the slight favor towards sweetness turns into a more neutral character as the dryness and (slight) astringency builds up on the tongue. There are a couple of niggles, the aforementioned lack of robustness, and the flavor profile doesn't linger the way I want it to in a RIS. Still, a fantastic brew. Finally, the carbonation is low.  O: It's not like the typical imperial stout I'm used to, but its vinous characteristics combined with some of the flavors the dark malts provide (such as chocolate) make this such an enjoyable sipper (but it's not a chugger by any means, even if it's only 7%!)

113,782,ScruffySouthpaw,4.25,"Served in a snifter.  Appearance: Darkness, with a tan head coming off the body rising to roughly 1"" and a half.  Smell: Wine, more like the alcohol scent of it.  Taste: Yeast meets chocolate, little bitter and you can feel the complexity of it.  Mouth: Light to medium carbonation with an after taste to lust for.  Overall: You are crazy to leave this on the shelf, well rounded beer that reminds you what real beer is. Salud!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,tone77,4.05,"Poured from a brown 18.7 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1 inch head. Smell is chocolate, roasted malts, molasses. Taste is good, chocolate, malts, a touch of coffee, just a hint of bitterness, complex and tasty. Feels full bodied, a bit creamy in the mouth and overall is a beer worth seeking out.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,MattSweatshirt,3.8,"Big mocha head on a dark body. Only a slight amber at the bottom of the tulip glass.  Dark fruit seems to dominate the smell for me with some coffee, sweetness, and a touch of alcohol.  Again with the dark fruit and coffee in the taste. Quite a hit of bitterness. A little licorice going on. The slight chocolate aroma doesn’t seem to translate into the taste.  Seems like quite a bit of carbonation for a RIS. Medium bodied. Leaves this drying unappealing aftertaste.  Samuel Smith again comes through with a good beer, but maybe blasé by today’s standards especially in regards to a RIS.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,CowsCanBark,4.08,"Poured from 18.7 oz. bottle into Samuel Adams pint glass.  Appearance: Pours a jet black with a huge fluffy chocolate colored head. A ton of lacing lines the glass.  Smell: Definitely a ton of malts, vanilla, cocoa, cream, earthy smell, and a wood-like smell that almost reminds me of barrel-aged.  Taste: Fine and malty. Very creamy and a hint of cocoa and hops. That woodsy, barrel-aged character is still there for me, and there is an extremely mild bitterness throughout.  Mouthfeel: Really nice, it's medium/full bodied with mild carbonation, and really creamy.  Overall: Highly recommended for a lower ABV Russian Imperial.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

A: Pours a dark black hue with a thick dark brown 3-finger head that slowly dissipates into a persistent lace, leaving a great trail down the glass.  S: Strong malt syrup aroma with a dark chocolate and espresso background.  T: Dark rich ale with a generous sweetness and a strong syrup malt backbone. Mild chocolate and coffee overtones and finishes slightly bitter and dry.  M: Very strong and boozy. Heavy body and medium carbonation.  O: Good imperial stout. Not a huge beer at 7% - but the alcohol is strong in every sip. A little too syrupy for me – but a very drinkable and enjoyable beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Murrhey,4.42,"Poured from a 550ml bottle into a pint glass. Reviewed live.  A- Poured a huge two finger mocha head, thick bubbles below and creamy on top. Long retention and sticky lacing. Extremely dark brown, almost black color. Very little light comes through. Wonderful looking beer.  S- Strong toffee scents. Never smelled a Russian Imperial Stout like this before. Deep caramel and some chocolate smells as well. Brown sugar, oatmeal-raisin cookies and a touch of alcohol. This smells divine.  T- Not as appealing as the smell, but I could get lost drinking this. Sweet and toffee-d, with a touch of bitterness in the tail end. I might even detect a bit of cherries in there.  M- Creamy, smooth and just a touch dry.  O- This may legitimately be my favorite beer I've reviewed on this site, and possibly the best one I've had. Drinkability is through the roof, smell is exquisite, the taste is wonderful and the mouthfeel is like a massage for your tongue. ...no but really this is great.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

The beer has a half finger tall dark tan head that reduces to a thin patchy layer covering the surface of the beer with a thicker ring at the edges of the glass. Moderate lacing is observed.  S: Definitely some sweetness in the smell with some dark fruits as well as toffee/caramel coming through. After that the dark roasted malts are noticeable. Overall, some nice complexity.  T: Starts with some nice dark roasted malts and some dark fruit, more plum/raisin than fig. After that some of the caramel sweetness comes through.There is a light amount of milk chocolate presence and light lingering bitterness.  M: Medium to full bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Smooth and creamy.  O: This is a very enjoyable and very drinkable stout. The beer has a nice complexity of flavor and aroma while still keeping a relatively low ABV. Not exactly sessionable but definitely easy to approach and not a beer that requires a lengthy time sipping. No noticeable alcohol present.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,machalel,3.38,"Note that after I did the review, I noticed that the bottle was *just* sitting on its used-by date. I am not sure how that would affect a beer such as this one, but it could be why I found it a little bit disappointing considering its overall rating here.  Appearance: Very dark and opaque brown-black. Smooth coffee coloured head with lots of sticky lacing down the glass.  Aroma: Strong aromas of chocolate, liquorice, and black strap molasses. Hints of caramel, toffee, biscuit, and roast barley. A bit of mustyness / damp.  Taste: The first impression is of espresso and roasted grains. After this is more treacle and burnt toffee with some roasted chocolate and dark fruit. Well balanced malt and bitterness to begin with, but feels a little bit 'hollow' by the end.  Mouthfeel: Medium carbonation, medium-full body, has a thick creaminess that turns a little slick after about half a glass.  Overall: Not having had an Imperial Stout for a long time, I was pleasantly surprised by this 'blind' choice. It wasn't as heavy as I expected, but was quite drinkable. It did taste a little bit 'hollow', as after the first few mouthfuls it was definitely not as complex as I had hoped. By the end of the bottle, my overall rating had gone from a 4 down to a 3, as the bitterness seemed to overtake any other flavours. Slightly disappointing considering its overall rating here.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,TheSixthRing,3.79,"Appearance - Pours a near midnight black, with only the strongest of lights penetrating the outer edges of the beer, revealing a cola brown color. The head is a 2 finger caramel brown, with good retention, and settles into a nice, sticky lace.  Smell - Faint aromas. Roasted malt. A bit of caramel.  Taste - This is nowhere near a ""kick you in the teeth"" assault as most RIS's are known. The classic flavors are there, but are subdued. Roasty chocolate, coffee, some dark fruit. A bit of toffee.  Mouthfeel - Medium to full body. Smooth and creamy. Carbonation is about right for the style.  Overall - An entirely drinkable Imperial Stout, nearly to a detriment; I've had oatmeal stouts with more potency than this. Certainly a weak Imperial Stout by today's standards. That said, it's pretty tasty, and respect for being a long standing classic.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,nrs207,4.35,"A - Dark as night. Light brown 2 finger head, with a nice lacing down the glass as I drink it.  S - Smells like sweet chocolate. Like dark chocolate and sweet malt mixed with some dark fruits. Really delicious smelling.  T - Tastes like chocolate. Straight up dark chocolate and sweet malt to create almost a milk chocolate taste, but they remain separate. There is some definite dark fruit flavor in there, but I can't determine what it is.  M - Smooth. Light carbonation. Not very thick at all. Could maybe be a tiny bit fuller for the style.  O - Really impressed by this one. Wasn't expecting a lot when I saw it, but it really surprised me. 7% RIS? It works. I'm used to seeing 9+% RISs, but other than a slightly thin mouthfeel for the style, it is extremely delicious.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,BrownNut,4.15,"I've always loved Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout and Oatmeal Stout and decided to do a side-by-side taste test. Here it is.  Imperial  A - black, deep ruby next to a lightbulb, thick off-white head, though not as thick or as textured as the Oatmeal Stout.  S - steely caramel, mocha, malt, mild coffee, almost a mulled winey/port note - more pronounced than in the oatmeal stout. Towards the end something plum-like came out, and finally something apple-y.  T - malt, cocoa and dark chocolate, hint of tart  M - smooth but less silky than the oatmeal stout and finishes slightly dry and slightly tart  O - I really like the Oatmeal Stout and this one cranks up the robustness a notch or two in my opinion. It's got a more pronounced flavor.  Oatmeal  A - black, deep ruby next to a lightbulb, the famous Samuel Smith's thick, tan, textured head  S - steely caramel, wet grain, malt, faint mulled winey note  T - mild mocha, brown sugar, hint of a tart-metal-caramel triangle, pastry note  M - silky, ends slightly dry  O - A solid oatmeal stout, very well balanced, delicious and palatable, perfect for drawing newbies into the stout fold. Its American cousins take the ball from there and elevate the robustness and complexity, but this is still a nice one to drink. I'm a little sad that it doesn't deliver as well now that I've expanded my stout palate, but I'll keep my nostalgic soft spot for it.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,orangesol,4.05,"I bought this one at Wegman's. I have had it a bunch of times now, time to sit down and write a review for it.  A - Pours jet black with a bubbly one and a half finger tall tan head leaving small streaks of lace down most of the glass.  S - Smells of dark roasted malts, chocolate, dark fruits, black licorice and a touch of fruity yeast. This one has nearly everything you would look for in an Imperial Stout.  T - Starts off with quite a bit of dark roasted malt quickly giving way to some sweet chocolate and dark fruits. Once the sweetness dies down you get hints of black licorice, port wine and a very light fruitiness. Finish has plenty of dark roast, lingering long after consumption.  M - Heavy body and flavor with moderate carbonation. This one is dark and roasty throughout, clinging to the pallet long after consumption. The soft feel does help to keep things in check tho.  O - Still one of the better ""simple"" stouts out there. It has a good amount of flavor and the lower than average ABV makes it easy to drink.

113,782,RonaldTheriot,4.92,"Samuel Smith’s Imperial Stout has a thick, creamy, beige head and a very dark brown (with red tints) appearance with some lacing. Aroma is sharp, dark-roasted barley malt, fudge, and bread crust, and taste is of dark malt, black coffee, sugar, chocolate, sweetness, and some hop bitterness thrown in. There is also some dark fruit aspect, like dates. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy, and Samuel Smith’s Imperial Stout finishes heavy and semi-dry. Overall, this is a wonderful beer.

113,782,Reagan1984,3.88,"Finally time to review a Samuel Smith’s Imperial Stout. One that I’ve had over the years, but never sat and thought about it too much.  The head builds and appears like a chocolate shake. Thick and creamy with excellent retention. The beer is much lighter than most Imperial Stouts and really looks like a cola w/o the carbonation. Just a touch of lace. Not nearly as much as the look of the head led me to believe.  Aroma is fairly light and I swear has mineral components to it. Just a touch of dark roasted malt, but not too strong at all.  I get cocoa and dark chocolate here. Some soy up front and some fruit in the end. Very smooth and easy drinking. Every once in a while I think chocolate/cherry in the flavor. Dark chocolate really is the base of the flavor here.  Mouth feel and the look of the beer go hand in hand. Both lighter than most Imp stouts I am used to. I prefer a thicker body, but this is still a nice beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

O: Just beautiful. A meal in a glass.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,HochFliegen,3.93,"Nice black pour with a solid tan colored head. Aroma was strong with malt, chocolate and coffee scents. With a deeper inhale I picked up alcohol and cherries as well. First tatse was very smooth and left a sweet impression of choclate and dark ripe cherries on my pallate. The aftertaste was slightly bitter and dry leaving a burnt coffee taste. Nice smooth mouthfeel with just enough creamieness. What a great warming stout on a cold rainy night.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Pexkool,4.63,"Poured into a Guinness pint.  A - It's what you would expect from a good stout, a pitch black color with a brown head over 3 fingers high that leaves a lace of about half finger high. Beautiful.  S - Delicious smell, rum and licorice fills the nose when the head is at its highest point, and when it dissipates the scent fades to a semi-sweet chocolate and anise aroma. A slight sniff of alcohol, perhaps, very well hidden.  T - Molasses, licorice and alcohol in a complex blend of flavors; there are some of them that I can't quite catch. I guess that's the roasted barley the label talks about. An aftertaste of hops and strong coffee.  M - Creamy and silky smooth. There's nothing much to add, really, it's fantastic. There's carbonation, but it's barely there. And with 7% ABV you can hardly notice the alcohol.  Overall a nearly perfect stout! I think it was much better than its Stone counterpart, but that's just my opinion. I would have expected more chocolate flavor but, again, that's just me. Can't complain though, this was one of the best stouts I've had. Highly recommended.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Look: Smooth pour down the middle into a Duvel glass. Head was a dense light brown, slightly over 2-fingers. The beer was a very opaque black color. Zero transparency.  Smell: Sweet notes of molasses and coffee bean and dark chocolate. A slight alcohol booziness was in the background, but worked well with the confectionary character of the aroma.  Taste: Mouth feel was very smooth and velvety. First on the palate was a sweet blend of brown sugar and coffee. The middle had a bitterness that could only be descried as a baking coca. The finish was a mixture of semisweet chocolate and caramelized toffee. The aftertaste was a nice roasted bitterness that lingered for a while.  This was a wonderful Imperial Stout. Although I’ve heard reports of how the Samuel Smith organization has mistreated the people of Tadcaster in one way or another, they can certainly brew a phenomenal stout.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

113,782,thecheapies,3.93,"Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout.  550ml bottle poured into pint.  Mega head on the pour. Tan in color and thick and foamy. Looks like watered-down molasses. An antiquated brown-black that just looks black in the glass. Lacing in layered rings.  Smells like roasted grains and dark fruit preserves. Artificial blackberry, South American coffee, hinting at traces of citric hops trying to permeate the nose.  Rich malt bill attracts the attention to dark grains, bitter crusts, damp earth, tinges of peppery spice in the pockets of the mouth, and molded berries. Aged hops are earthy, musty, and a bit piquant. There's a backend tanginess that can't quite be associated with one kind of fruit. There's a little molasses quality in the taste, as well as some lingering alcohol. This RIS is on the dry side of middle.  The mouthfeel is impressive. Velvety on the tongue with a back-half 'bushy tail' of carbonation that brushes the palate. Surprisingly overly noticeable in strength at 7.0%.  It's a classic, and a great brew. Not my favorite take on the style, but they practically invented it. A complex and satisfying version that would work wonders as an entry-point to a novice beer enthusiast to the magical world of Russian Imperials.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

113,782,Siriusfisherman,4.34,"A very delicious beer, and like everything beer that Sam Smith's makes, a perfect example of the style in its fundamental form. This is not fancy, and not over the top, just incredibly well done. It looks great, a very dark and deep black, virtually no light getting through and a nice light brown head with good lacing. Somewhat let down by the smell, I was expecting more punch than just the toffee sweetness and it really just came off a little underwhelming. The taste was a different story however, a very upfront roasted barley bitterness complimented by an acidic hop presence. The toffee adds a very light sweetness to what would otherwise be a very bitter forward beer. The mouthfeel is superb, silky smooth in the mouth, blending perfectly with the carbonation, lathering you up for a huge bitter, dry finish.  Overall, this is a beer that goes great after a long day working in the cold and wet, taking big gulps out of an english pint. It may not be my favorite stout, or even my favorite from Sam Smith's (I love you Oatmeal Stout), but it is a hell of great way to finish the day.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

113,782,scottmichaelland,3.2,"Poured into over sized wine glass, after about 30 minutes rest out of fridge.  Appearance: Color was extremely dark chocolate with a tint of brandy coloring towards the light. Very dark, no see through. Soda type bubbles on pour, but very minimal visible carbonation after. Had about a half inch of light brown head immediately following pour but it dissipated very quickly. I think this is because the beer was in the fridge for too long. No head retention because of this. Semi cloudy pour, black in glass.  Smell: Black licorice is the most prominent for me. I get a lot of alcohol smell, hint of roast, coffee, and raisins. Possible very small hint of vanilla.  Taste: Roasted malt was the most prominent. I do still get the licorice and bitterness on the back of the tongue. I get a little bit of coffee. This beer has character but I think it could be balanced better.  Mouth feel: Perfect carbonation for an Imperial Stout. Not too much or too little. Medium mouth feel. Could be ""stickier"" but it's extremely drinkable. Stickiness is subjective anyway.  Giving this beer slightly above average. I was expecting better. I think what brought it down slightly overall for me was the balance, or lack there of.

I had a few different kinds about 4 years ago which I really just didn't like at the time, so only recently have I decided to try it again, and what better way to start than with Imperial Stout?  Appearance - 5/5 - It has a deep rich black color with a thick creamy brownish head  Smell - 5/5 - Roasty and ..maybe a plum brandy. Hard to describe but wonderful.  Taste - 5/5 - Rich roasty and estery. Bitter, roasty, slight fruit (plum or raisin) aftertaste that lingers. Somewhat minerally (albeit from the well water used). Perhaps that is what put me off years ago, but I've since gained appreciation for the uniqueness of flavor imparted by the water.  Mouthfeel - 4.5/5 - Semi-thick, biscuit (?) body. Very well carbonated. Pleasant but the body could limit me to two.  Overall - 5/5 - In the end, my interest in Samuel Smith has been greatly revived!

Smooth and slightly creamy. Slightly warm too.  O: Really good Russian Imperial Stout. I like that it's a lower ABV than most. Plus, the nose and flavor are phenomenal. One of my new favorites.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,mariposafan,4.2,"Very, very dark brown bordering on black with a huge brown head. The head dies back to a cap that persists.  Some sweetness, some roastiness and maybe a little hops in the aroma. All of that is layered with something that doesn't remind me of beer at all but of a mocha. Very pleasant.  Sweet, rich malts. Some mocha again - both coffee and bittersweet chocolate. Nowhere near as much roastiness as I was expecting but there's a lingering bitterness that I wish were lessened a little. There's also a mineral character that actually works very well here.  Moderately viscous with enough carbonation to cut through the bittersweet flavors and get my tongue ready for more.  I wasn't expecting much from this considering all of the chatter about roastiness and my less that stellar experiences with other stouts and porters. I was pleasantly surprised! Not sure how often I'll buy it as I'm not sure if the style is for me - roasty character doesn't seem to be one of my favorites, though it's not as bad as excessive bitterness or hoppiness - but not sorry I got it either.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,legalpete19340,4.03,"A: Poured perfect. Completely black with a tall tan head. The head was around for the entire session.  S: Decaf coffee, lots of salty sweet: Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce and an odd sweetness i cant place. Maybe dark chocolate.  T: Smooth, malt and grain bitter-sweetness with a hint of smoke. Lots of decaf coffee flavor. This comes across as a very grain and grass strong beer and the sweetness comes from that. It is not a candy or chocolate sweet beer. At the hinting of a friend I can identify white grape juice.  M: Thick but not chewy. Somehow it manages to be smooth and big without being a meal.  O: This was a very good RIS, but just not my favorite. I prefer more roastiness and darker flavors with less sweetness (Old Rasputin). Nice work but the decaf flavor limits me to one.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

S: Plenty of roasted malts hit immediately. Get lots of dark berries, but also grape jelly somehow. Some molasses like sweetness. Nice.  T: Interesting brew. RIS can start to blend together, I think this one stands out. It definitely has a solid dark roast backbone, but doesn't get overly bitter. Differentiator to me, is it has a light fruitiness to it. Sweet cherry comes to mind, maybe grape jelly as I picked up in the nose. It's a lighter take then some of the RIS I've had, but it's not a ""thinner"" beer by any means, and the flavor is just as robust. Killer beer.  M: They nailed it, velvety smooth, slick, chewy.  O: It has all the huge flavor of a good RIS, but somehow comes in as a more ""delicate"" beer if that can be said of a RIS. Fantastic stuff.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Also a real nice liqueur smell along with roasted malt and a touch of caramel.  Tastes of caramel, chocolate and roasted malt. Some warming alcohol detracts from what would otherwise be a pretty decadent experience.  Mouthfeel is full, big bodied for the ABV, still soft with some roasted bitterness late. Surprised at the alcohol heat that is the one thing that irks. Still, it does very well in this department.  A lovely beer. A reminder that the day i spent in Tadcaster was not nearly long enough.

113,782,Jugs_McGhee,3.9,"33cl brown glass bottle served into an EKU 28 snifter at the Kortrijk train station (I was on the go). Reviewed from notes.  A: Pours a one finger tan colour head of wonderful cream lacing, great thickness, and standard retention for the ABV. Colour is a solid black.  Sm: Caramel, chocolate, roast, coffee, toffee, vanilla, and cream. Rich and decadent.  T: Heavy caramel lacing weaves through a lightly roasted barley body. Hops are those that support the flavours from the nose with the exception of coffee. It's really quite nicely layered. Complex and brilliant.  Mf: Smooth and wet, with adequate coarseness but not enough dryness for the style. It matches the flavours almost perfectly.  Dr: With a fairly high ABV, a very good price (~2.70 euro in Switzerland), and incredible drinkability, it's a brilliantly done stout that I'd definitely have again.  I don't know that it's a good candidate for aging on account of its ABV (which is a bit low).  3.98  --- 11.28.14: Truncated notes. 7.0% ABV. Classy iconic label art. Gold foil-ed over pry-off pressure cap. 550ml brown glass bottle.  Served cold into a Guinness goblet in high altitude Castle Rock, CO. Reviewed live as an imperial stout per the label. Served chilled and allowed to warm over the course of consumption.  No bubble show forms as it's poured.  HEAD: Four fingers wide. Khaki colour. Creamy, nicely thick, soft-looking, plump, and supple. Retains well - for about 5-6 minutes. Smooth and rolling.  BODY: Opaque black. No yeast particulate or hop sediment is visible.  Quite appealing overall, but nevertheless typical for the style.  AROMA: Fresh intoxicating Belgian chocolate. Soft chocolate malk, lactose sugar, cream, and a hint of roast. Hints of dark fruit - mainly plum and prune. It's soft, light, and incredibly inviting. I can't wait for the first sip. An exquisite aroma of above average strength. Fantastic.  I find no burnt, coffee, yeasty, or off characteristics.  TASTE: Extravagant dark fruit - plum and prune - blends immaculately with soft Belgian chocolate, milky lactose sugar, and pleasant cream to form an incredibly well-balanced flavour profile with plenty of subtlety.  TEXTURE: Smooth, supple, soft, wet, silky, and fantastically creamy. Excellent overall presence on the palate. Full-bodied, ideally thick, and not too viscous or heavy. Really elevates the beer.  OVERALL: Absolutely a classic in the style, but not a reigning champion. This is a beer that must be tried by any fan of the style, but since its introduction it's been eclipsed by more daring bold brews. In any case, it's a touchstone and a paragon, and ought to be regularly revisited if only to calibrate one's imperial stout barometer. Extremely drinkable, and always enjoyable, Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout is ludicrously good.  B+",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Smell - Molasses, soy sauce, dark fruits, touch of black coffee.  Taste - Taste follows the nose: roasted malts, black coffee, dark fruits, and touch of soy. These flavors come all at once. In the finish I get some char, toasted pumpernickel crust and a fairly prominent mineral taste.  Mouthfeel - Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, medium carb adds some nice tingle and lends nice drinkability.  Overall - I'm a bit disappointed here, let me explain. The nose is wonderful, and by the smell of this ""Imperial Stout"" I thought this was going to be a big, flavorful, mouthcoating beer, but it absolutely is not.

After a sip the actual taste is revealed to be just as interesting and complex as the nose. The initial splash of flavor is the fruit/raisin followed by, a roasted, smoked touch and a dry finish. Very crisp on the tongue. As I drink the head sticks tightly to the glass - this is a nice frothy brew. This has a relatively light mouth feel and I can hardly put the glass down even for a second.

113,782,Pintofbrown,4.47,"I poured this RIS into a glass stein.  Appearance- The head crept to two-fingers of dense and foamy head with a brown sugar tint. A small smattering of bubble is seen in the top of the cap, not really any less on the glass as it degrades, decent retention.  A very dark brown and opaque body with some barely perceptible dark auburn highlights. It definitely looks like a good beer.  Smell- Whoa, a very decent amount of raisiny bourbon on the nose. Also some roasted malt that has a definite wheat bread smell to it. May be more subtleties, but those are the dominant aspect of the nose. Definitely more ""sweet"" than ""roasted"" on the RIS scale. Very good.  Taste- Plenty more of the brandy on the palate as I let the beer float around before swallowing. I also can distinguish more of that bread malt near the beginning and end of the drink.  Also get that distinct hard water tinge of a Samuel Smith beer, and it compliments this offering really well. The water gives the beer a slight edginess that a roasted malt usually brings to an RIS. What great Imperial Stout flavors!  Mouth feel- A really big body on this one, absolutely fills the mouth. The carbonation pumps up the creaminess very well, and does this one ever finish smooth. Maybe just a little dry from that boozy aspect.  Overall- A wonderful RIS that has that distinctive Samuel Smith hard water flavor and fantastic mouth feel. Some may find it simplistic or not enjoy the boozy character; others will relish these characteristics, like I have.  If you have not had this one already please wait no longer.

Coffee-like flavor makes an appearance, and hops is present but never overpowering in the finish.  M: Nicely carbonated, not much alcohol burn.

Rum soaked raisins, plums, figs, dates. Very dark winter fruits all wrapped up in a brown sugar scent.  Taste - Again, not what i was expecting. Maybe it is my americanized palate but this one drinks more like a deep quad than an imperial stout. Again, full disclosure...american palate. The taste follows the nose. Candied fruits, figs, raisins, dates, brown sugar. There is not a single ounce of bitterness in this thing which leaves the chocolate and coffee completely out. Reminds me more of a quad, but then again this is a very old recipe so perhaps i should be referring to american imperial stouts differently because of this. Still the taste is lingering and satisfying.  Mouthfeel - Rich, creamy, sticky and chewy, everything you would expect. Coats the mouth. One of my favorite parts of this one.

Taste was very similar, but also had noticeable fruit tones and tasted a lot like the burnt/almost burnt underside of homemade bread -- the part that was touching a pan and got a little too brown. That was mostly in the back of the tongue. The front was roasted malts and english hops (not spicy or bitter, but... just there).  It gave me a nice warm feeling. I didnt keep this in the fridge when I bought it today, but rather stuck it in my cabinet under the counter. It looked really thick and viscous when it poured into the glass, but it didnt feel too thick when drunk. There was noticeable carbonation, but not too much. You could leave it in your mouth for a while without getting that bubbly feeling on your tongue.  Cheers!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,greenborn,4,This was yet another beer recommended to me by a brewer friend of mine that knew I was into English Ales. This was a pretty good beer. Much more flavorful than the Fullers ESB or Belhaven Wee Heavy but just as good but not as smooth. The flavor was more complex than most of the English ales I have had but more malty and less hoppy. The color was dark and rich just as its flavor. I found this beer to be great with a white/milk chocolate and/or cheese- oddly. Good to drink- better with food.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,jegross2,4.47,"Reviewing a Samuel Smith Imperial Stout by Samuel Smith Old Brewery. Score: 94  2011 vintage bottle served in a brandy snifter.  Appearance: A finger's length of fizzy heady pours and subsides into a thin blotchy tan lace. The color is as dark brown/black as midnight, and no light even pretends to permeate through. 4/5  Smell: A very sweet, vanilla-extract nose. Faint dark rum and unsweetened dark chocolate notes. I go back and forth as to if I smell faint oak flavors, though that might just be the vanilla. 4.5/5  Taste: Very complex, malty and balanced. Flavor toggles between sweet/dark chocolate, and then smoky roasted coffee. 4.5/5  Mouthfeel: A viscous, sticky beer. Slightly foamy, and the finish is of delectable coffee breath. 4.5/5  Overall: Wow. This is light in alcohol, but big in flavor. This beer is super smooth, and certainly one of the better Russian Imperial Stouts I have had to date.  Recommendation: This is one of the better beers I have ever had the pleasure to drink. This would be a great first Russian Imperial Stout to drink in order to get into the style, as the flavors are less aggressive and more balanced than some other Russian Imperial Stouts.  Pairings: Dark meats or chocolate dessert.  Cost: $3.99 for a 22 oz (bomber) bottle.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Can't get here quick enough. This is so good, every time. Coffee and dark, charred mocha and sweet toffee are blended perfectly. Finishes with bitter smoke. Mouth is very creamy and dense with just the right amount of carbonation. This is such a classic. It is different than any imperial by U.S. Just... done right and consistently great. The standard in my opinion, as is many from this brewer. Long live the Tadcaster!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Nose-Huge fruity nose, very familiar scent, after hearing the word Twizzlers I 100% agree, so it must be an artificial cherry kind of flavor.  Palate-Very sweet, some sour, some bitter. Red licorice, very fruity, some roast, off caramel flavor.  Body-Full, heavy, creamy.

113,782,KajII,3.88,"[Best served in a snifter]  The pour was a deep dark murky black with a large (2-3 finger) light brown rocky head that lasted a decent while leaving behind some really nice residue floating on top thus producing some really excellent lacing.  The aroma was wonderfully robust with a burnt dark bread malt and a mild sweet leathery yeast with notes of dark chocolate, dark roasted coffee, licorice, some dark fruit and a hint of molasses.  The taste was lightly sweet and malty with a hint of chocolate from the onset then became a mild bitter sweet with a nice note of coffee at the end with the flavor lasting a nice long while proceeding the swallow.  Mouthfeel was nice a full in body and rather creamy and a tad dry in texture with a mild carbonation.

A few rays of light make it through if held up to the light and are cola in color. Active carbonation with a thick cocoa head with great retention and lacing. What a nice stout should look like.  S: Chocolate, prunes, oak barrels, and a strong vanilla extract presence. Slight hints of coffee, rum, and cane sugar.  T: Roasted barley up front, and the coffee flavor comes through much more in the taste department, holding down the middle. Prunes, molasses, hops, and biscuity yeast bring up the rear. Chocolate hints throughout. Well balanced and very, very tasty.  M: Smooth, medium bodied, with just a touch of a hops finish and a bit of spritz from the carbonation. Just a tad bit of dryness after the finish. A little on the thin side of stouts. A nice alcohol warmth, holds its ABV well.  O: Just a notch below the best I've had, but much more attainable.

113,782,ehammond1,3.61,"Bottle  Holiday Wine Cellar Escondido, CA  Black as can be with a thick, persistent light brown head. Sheets and dots of lacing are left down the glass. Perfection!  An interesting aroma for an imperial stout: roasted malt, milk chocolate, and graham cracker crumbles. It's interesting and quite intoxicating.  The flavor isn't nearly as nice as the aroma, unfortunately. There's simply not a ton here: roasted malt, light chocolate, and a bit of sugary sweetness, but not much else.  Thin to medium bodied with low carbonation.  This was really disappointing (because I had such high expectations). While this is gorgeous and quite aromatic, it just doesn't do it for me in either the taste or mouthfeel departments. While certainly a decent big stout, I won't feel like I'm missing out if I don't ever have this again--which is too bad, because I was hoping I'd love this stuff--it's so inexpensive!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

The lacing is a sheet of foam that runs evenly around the entire glass.  S - Dark chocolate aroma doesn't allow for too much else in the nose. Perhaps something fruity, as in dark fruit.  T - Dark chocolate follows to the tongue with a raisin or plum characteristic. A touch of heat towards the end, but bitter chocolate still prevails  M - Smooth, creamy and medium body.

S: Dark fruit and astringent (soy?) sweetness...maybe some woody notes, and coffee underneath that with an herbal character.

113,782,Damian,4.05,"Drank from a 12 fl. oz./355 ml bottle purchased at Julio's Liquors, Westboro, MA Served in a snifter  The liquid appeared much thinner and lighter in color than your average Russian imperial stout, but it made up for this shortcoming with an attractive, bubbly, light brown, two-finger head. Excellent retention. The crown faded to a thick, lasting ring of froth. Streaks of lacing cascaded down the glass.  The nose was fantastically rich and complex. Dark fruit notes were quite apparent. Raisins, figs and plums were most noticeable. There was a definite bourbon-like presence, which was surprising considering that this beer is neither bourbon-aged nor high in alcohol. Lots brown sugar sweetness. Powdered cocoa notes were detectible. A bit of roast. Overall, quite smooth and balanced. The aroma became even more robust and complex with time. Port-like notes appeared as well.  Dark fruits again came through strong in the flavor profile. Lots of deep roast. Rich and malty yet quite dry. Brown sugar was noticeable. Some dark chocolate and cold black coffee. Notes of char came through on the dry, slightly smoky finish. Some hops were detectible as well. As the beer warmed, the flavor profile became smoother and more robust. Nevertheless, this was definitely one of the most quaffable Russian imperial stouts I have sampled.  The mouthfeel was the only real letdown. It was very thin for the style. The liquid contained a moderately spritzy effervescence that seemed a bit distracting.  Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout is a unique take on this now ubiquitous style. Although it may not be as intense as many of the monster stouts brewed today, it it impressive nonetheless. All in all, I found this beer to be refreshing both literally and figuratively.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Super strong lacing like shaving cream hills. Lovely.  S - Sweet mildly smokey. Some liquid malt smells like a lightly toasted chocolate pastry. Tiny puffs and hints of hoppy leafs. Like those treats they sell in SE Asia wrapped in banana leaves palm leaves.  T - This is nice. Bitter roasted sweet. Sorghum and caramel dipped coffee muffins. Initial palate is cool and minty then sweet and full, then aftertaste is slightly alcohol burn. Maybe the only problem.  M - So smooth and creamy. Like a honey milkshake. Refreshing to no end. Slight alcohol burn might be off putting for some, but it's not a deal breaker.  D - Sam Smith boys know about beer. They deliver once again, in a refreshing smooth beer that is both filling and hearty and at the same time light and playful.

Agitating brings forth a bready yeast smell.  Very dry, bitter chocolate, maybe coffee if you force yourself to notice it. Porter like, dry finish, not rich or sweet. Mineral, metallic coin taste.  A sharply carbonated, soda mouthfeel, not creamy as you might expect. The mouthfeel is wholly enjoyable, just strange for a(n) RIS.  American RIS's might be more rich than their European counterparts. This isn't a bad beer, just not what I expected.

Hershey syrup. Some good roasted coffee too. Burnt caramel. Subtle hints of dried dark fruit. Light sizzle of alcohol. Interesting and inviting nose.  T-Hershey syrup again. Roasted coffee is secondary but quite tasty. Lightly bitter. More dark chocolate bitter than hop bitter. A bit nutty. Plums and figs. Like chocolate milk with too much syrup in it. Light tobacco hint in the end.  M-Heavier body but relatively light for a RIS. Carbonation is definitely noticeable. Not too viscous. Easy drinking however. Lightly bitter. ABV masked well.

A dense, creamy coat of lacing sticks to the glass.  Smell is all malt and roasted barley. Some hints of both chocolate and licorice are present, but play supporting roles.  As the beer hits the tongue, it's all creamy and sweet, somewhat like chocolate milk. Eventually, you'll pick up coffee notes with the licorice (or anise) saying hello as well. In the finish, the hops are front and center before finally giving way to a slightly bittersweet chocolate swallow.  It's thick and creamy, but at the same time, slightly loose. As mentioned, it's also sweet with some bitter. It's a nice combination of contrasts.

113,782,Cozzatoad,4.02,"355ml bottle, best before january 2013  A- Utterly black colour. One finger, light brown head, not as creamy as in most strong stouts. Scarse retention and not much lacing either  S- Strong and rich smell of what should probably be caramel malts, but with a distinct alcoholic note that has the aroma feeling like rum. Lots of undernotes as well: leafy hops, prune, molasses, yeast; something new with every smell  T- Obviously very malty, and again with that assertive (but somehow still delicate) alcoholic note, plus a light roasted note. Flavour is strong with chocolate, with an amazing load of undernotes: dried/dark fruits, coffee, nut, leafy/lemony hops on the tongue; just like the aroma, something new with every sip  M- Nicely smooth. Quite on the light side in body for an imperial stout, but somehow still full on the palate andl enough thick. Moderate carbonation is appropriate for the beer. Warming  O- Very drinkable for the style: of course the 7%ABV helps, but despite low ABV the beer still feels as rich and complex as an imperial stout should feel",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Striking looking beer.  -Smell 4.5: Lots of lovely aromas present. First smell is of an alcohol-flavored caramel and then a smell of grains and hops. Delicious and it's a shame more stouts don't focus on the bouquet of their beers.  -Taste 4.5: Sweet taste up front, with a slight bitterness. After swallowing...wow, lots of toasted barley, hops, caramel, brown sugar...many other flavors to discover in future tastings. Delicious. Long aftertaste of chocolates and toasted grains.  -Mouthfeel 4.0: This beer is not bottle conditioned and verges on the edge of too much carbonation. However, the bubbles are much smaller than in your typical brew and, in my humble opinion, this makes the carbonation in this beer not as much of distraction as in other brews.  -Overall 4.0: This must be one of, if not the, best stouts in the world. There is a level of carbonation present here that will turn off fans of ""draught only Guinness,"" but if you are like me and are accustomed to other stouts, you will find an infinity of tastes to enjoy in this excellent British stout.

Deep and complex roasted aroma with coffee, dark chocolate, wheat toast, and licorice. Rich molasses, prune and black currant sweetness balance the roasted flavors. Hops add depth with a spicy herbal character. Exceptional depth and complexity.  Full-bodied, dense consistency and ultra-smooth feel. Feels like smooth, melted chocolate in your mouth.

Taste is rich but restrained roasted malt and a little minerally (spot on, I totally see the well water) no hops/chocolate/coffee to speak of, finishing with a bit of bitterness. Medium body and carbonation which is not particularly smooth. Overall, the light touch of roasted malt makes this pretty drinkable.

113,782,zac16125,3.9,"Samuel Smith Imperial Stout 355ml bottle poured into a mug No born on date or other distinguishing numbers, although I do dig the tall, thin bottle and old school label  A: Pours an opaque black with 2.5 fingers of bubbly creamed coffee colored head. Some reddening is seen around the edges when held up to a bright light. Head dissipates at a moderate rate. Leaves no appreciable lacing.  S: Strong aroma. You don’t have to stick your nose into the beer to smell this one. Lots of dark fruit is noted right away, fig and plum in particular. More subtle coffee and roasted aroma. Doesn’t really smell like an RIS, more like one of the better Doppelbocks, or to a lesser degree some of the not-as-complex Belgium quads.  T: It might not smell like a stout, but it tastes like one. The first sip has some dark fruits up front with a big roasted malt character on the backend. Has some earthy/grassy flavors in there as well. There are flavors of dark chocolate that linger in the aftertaste, along with the lingering roasted characters. The aftertaste is probably the best part of the palate profile, as otherwise the flavors as a whole are on the weaker side for an RIS. Good flavors, just more subdued than I prefer in an RIS.  M/D: A lighter mouthfeel. Light to medium bodied. Over carbonated for my liking, which takes away some of the smoothness that I look for in a good stout. I also think the over carbonation detracts from some of the more subtle flavors. Heavily carbonated stouts are one of my pet peeves. Otherwise, pretty easy to drink with no hint of the relatively low ABV. You could certainly have a couple of these in one setting if you so choose.  O: Overall, a decently good beer. However, with the subdued flavors, lighter body, and over carbonation, it doesn’t really come off as an RIS to me. I would drink it again, particularly since the price is relatively low, but its not something I’d go out of my way to have again. I prefer the bolder American RIS’s. However, I do think it is much better than the Samuel Smith Oatmeal Stout, and certainly worth a try if you've never had it.

Good lacing all around, medium retention. Looks like an Imperial Stout should.  S: Epic chocolate malts and rich caramel cream. Got some smoke and oak, too. It's wrapped up by a big butterscotch bourbon - delicious. I'm not getting a whole lot of British feel here, but that's ok; it's great.  T: Light vanilla with a maple nuttiness underneath. The flavors are rich, but they come off in that distinctly weightless British way. Roasted malts, coffee, and chocolate all have an equal stand; all hardy flavors. There's a nice hop showing as well - a bit Noble-tasting, mostly light and earthy. Just the smallest hint of mineral water and alcohol push the palate toward a slightly dry, chocolaty aftertaste. Bold, classic flavor.  M: Light, thin, with a decent showing of carbonation. Not oily at all, as the look would imply.  O: A very nice drink.

Balanced, leaning at first toward the bitter/burnt side, then opening up into a mellow, dark caramel sweetness that lingers a little through the finish.  M: Full, medium-heavy mouthfeel. Lively carbonation for a stout (I'm assuming from the added CO2 they indicate on the bottle). No signs of alcohol, except in adding robustness to the body.  O: An all-around great imperial stout.

Dark roasted malt, molasses, lots of dark fruits (stewed plums, and raisins), chocolate, coffee, dark caramel, slightly burned fruit cake and black licorice are all noted. I was expecting a few hops, but none are noted.  Taste: Wow, this is one tasty beer! It just shows that an RIS doesn't need to be 12% to have a bold flavour. Again Roasted malt, molasses and dark fruits dominate. Fruit cake, chocolate, espresso, black licorice and dark caramel are also noted. The flavour is initially sweet and has a great, lasting bitter finish. No alcohol is noted.  Mouthfeel: Full body, lightly viscous with mild, very smooth carbonation.

113,782,TheAlamoWrocker,3.12,"Poured from a 550 mL bottle into a Blue Star Brewery Pint Glass.  Appearance  Pours a beautiful black with hardly any reddening around the edges. The only shade of red that this has is on its base, but on it's sides it's beautifully black. I can easily say that this is the blackest thing in my room and is easily one of the best looking stouts I've seen. Sadly the head comes one fingered and goes, but a small remnant stays on top and it reminds me of delicious coffee.  Smell  This oddly just smells lightly coffee-like. It does have some toffee notes, but I can't pick up the chocolate that I'm used to in a Russian Imperial Stout.  Taste  This hits the usual coffee notes that I'm used to in a Russian Imperial Stout, but it misses out on the sweetness that I'm used to from one. Roasted malts are present. There is oddly what seems like a alcoholic dark chocolate to this.  Mouthfeel  The mouthful is creamy and nicely smooth. The only carbonation this feels like it has is whatever of the head hits the palate.  Overall  This feels like a standard Russian Imperial Stout. It's far from anything special, but it's a nice starter to the style. I guess if I wanted a roasted malty coffee this would be a nice choice, but it's hard to find a time to enjoy something like this. If this was possible to drink while studying then that would be the best time, but I'm studying! The best time to enjoy this drink is probably the worst.

About a 1/2 inch of head retains for the entire glass, until the last drop. I would have scored higher if the lacing was there.  S: Sweet and malty, like chocolate and molasses. Alcohol is there too, but not strong at all. A little bit of sweet fruit brings it all around! One of my favorites for sure!  T: Dark chocolates, caramel, dark fruits, prunes and even dark cherries, bitterness that turns to smokiness. Roasted malts and then a great aftertaste that lingers around for a bit. A touch of alcohol just makes things right. There are stronger and more ""slap you in the face"" RIS's, but this one perfectly balanced.  M: Silky smooth, light and bubbly, yet medium bodied. I expected something heavier based of the look and smell, but I was greeted with a slightly oily feel, but not heavy. The carbonation really brings it together and finishes this beer right!  O: I can't quite give a ""5"" to any of these categories. The beer didn't seem to have the same depth as some other RIS. I don't think it really compares to many other RIS, in that it falls a little short in that respect, but as a beer, it is great!

Carbonation is just right on this. Washes over the palate gently with no rough edges.  O - A bit different from the American versions. Although this is lower in alcohol than most American RIS's its got some pretty pronounced alcohol notes in the nose and taste. This is perfect for a winter setting. Top notch brew.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

113,782,bramsdell,4.08,"Bottle to Imperial pint glass.  A: It's very dark with tan/mocha-colored head. Hold it up to light and you will not see any difference in color.  S: Coffee aromas are most prevalent with some smokiness.  T: This is not a bold entry into the style, but it is an extremely solid beer. This is a great example of the style, but never daring in any regard. There are distinct coffee notes first, some smokiness to follow. Pretty much follows the smell.  M: Feels great. Thick without being syrupy, this beer is far heavier than most, but certainly light enough to drink a couple.  O: This beer is, again, not superlative in any sense, but a great beer nonetheless. There are no risks here. It's thick without being too thick. The ABV is higher than a stout, but still low for the style. There are no crazy flavors present.

Taste: Something unusual and unexpected I can't quite put my finger on as well as expected flavors from the nose. Closest I can get is that it's more like tea than coffee but that's not quite on the nose. Body is thin for an imp. Still a fine brew.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,pBRale,4.13,"From tasting notes on 9-10-11  Appearance: Black pour, chocolatey tan head that is foamy and settles fast, leaving lots of lacing.  Smell: Sweet malts, candied sugar, alcohol booziness, ripe bananas. As the beer warms, the banana scent fades a bit while the alcohol smell increases.  Taste: Roasted malts, roasted coffee, a little bit of the sugar and fruity sweetness. The aftertaste lingers and is of roasted coffee. Bold roasty brew with a bit of alcohol in the afterburn. This becomes more prominent as the beer warms, but then diminishes as the beer warms further.  Mouthfeel: Rich, velvety mouthfeel. Mild/subtle carbonation, but enough. Just coats the mouth so wonderfully.  Overall: Bold flavorful taste, velvety smooth, and a very good beer overall.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,mtschmitz,3.33,"A: Pours a nice dark opaque brown with single finger head. The head seems to dissipate quickly to a fine lace but inconsistent.  S: Smell is a bit less aromatic than i was anticipating being an imperial. Subtle hints of chocolate and coffee. Even after letting it sit for a while the aroma did not expose itself too much.  T: Lots of smoky flavor and a taste of coffee and dark chocolate. Tones of alcohol which quickly diminish to smoke. A bit overpowering on the alcohol taste, but good nonetheless.  M: Mouthfeel is pretty thin but the flavors evolve on the palate quite well. A bit less chewy than is my liking for an imperial  O: Overall I'd say that it's a decent Imperial Stout. Im a big fan of their nut brown and porter but this left me wanting more out of the beer.

Anyways this pours a pitch black and semi thick flow with a mocha head which doesn't last long and goes down to a thin layer on the top. The smell is of roasted coffee and malts, also some sweet smells perhaps molasses. Feel is thick and creamy, one of the better feeling beers I can remember, very nice.

Expected a deeper roasted flavor. A volatile alcohol note was actually the strongest element.  Nice full mouth feel due to adequate carbonation and hi specific gravity. A little sticky on the lips.  Not a session beer but one could enjoy two before acclimation.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,keysofebony,5,"This is by far one of my favorite beers.  This is a pretty dark beer although a slight hint of red when held up to a bright light. Tan head that sticks around.  Smell is like a snickers bar put in coffee. a little funk to it, but that's more of a caramel smell.  Taste is outstanding. Definitely what is expected from the nose; caramel, coffee, and chocolate mostly. No alcohol taste really and it is not too dry and the slightest bit sweet. Small amount bitterness and comfortable malty taste.  I bought a bottle of this for a friend's dad who swears by Guinness and he was blown away. I have to say this is one of very few imperial stouts I have had, but every time now I have a guinness or regular stout it is just not enough.

This one has an especially sweet, creamy smell, something like marshmallows or chocolate covered bananas. Not sure if it's the yeast, or malts, or whatever, but it's funky, in a great way.  T: More of that interesting, funky sweetness in the front of the palate. Almost like a chocolatey yogurt, or a blackberry pie. It's extremely odd and very hard to place. It's pretty one note, but I really like the flavor, just don't know what to call it...really nice, and definitely different than most RIS.  O: Very nice brew. Totally stumped me.

Nose carries roasted malt and a bit of coffee. Nice but rather faint.  Taste consists of roasted malt and a bit of dark chocolate. A bit of sweetness. Slightly bitter finish. A nice taste, but not particularly complex or strong. Enjoyable but certainly does not pack the punch that I expect for a RIS.  Mouthfeel is thinner than expected- disappointingly so. Otherwise pretty good. Very mild carbonation.  Overall, enjoyable but somewhat disappointing. Obviously not every RIS has to be over the top in strength, but I found this beer to be somewhat underwhelming. While I tend to like imperial stouts, I prefer Sam Smith's Oatmeal to this offering.

Hardly any garnet red when held to the light. A definite black beauty. A huge, rich, and creamy mocha head that seems to last forever. I had very nice lace. This has the ultimate look of any brew I've seen. I like my brew black. S - She was definitely a sweet smelling brew. A little bit of dark fruit up front. Then came the rich molasses which dominated my nose. It was a good solid smell, but I was looking for more of the other sweet notes in my nose. It has the sweet milky smell with a hint of coffee(these were the smells I wanted more of) But I can't complain. T - The bitterness of these chocolate notes were to die for. Absolutely A+. The hoppy taste was nice as well. I just got stuck with the chocolate like coffee taste it brought. Almost wanted everything else to go away. However the taste of dark raisins and prunes were a lot better in taste than smell. Great tasting brew nonetheless. M - Medium to full body that is good all the way through. You can taste the alcohol, but it's less than most English style RIS. O - A superb RIS. I really am fond of this style of brew. I've had many different ones, and they all seem to please in their own way. This is a winner for sure. World class, and one of the less alc % ones out there, so it's one of the best ones to get if you arent used to this style of stout. It's also great tasting to those who are.

Fruity british ale notes that hint of raspberries. Kinda tangy on the finish.  Mouthfeel is big and well carbonated. Not particularly thick or chewy for the style.

Overall, the aroma is a bit on the tart, fruity side... maybe a slight hint of chocolate and roasted malts in there, but predominantly black licorice. The taste is similar to the aroma: starts out with fruit and black licorice, then finishes a little more smokey and chocolatey. Malts and alcohol are also in the mix. A pretty complex beer, let it warm up a bit and the notes are easier to distinguish. Beautiful pour and very thick on the tongue; it’s a pretty heavy brew, but still quite drinkable.

The flavour is a little on the thin side for my liking but what's here is great.  Smooth medium body with light carbonation.

Some dark fruits, maybe raisins or cherries.  T: The slightest sting of alcohol for the tiniest moment. Almost don't notice it. Some malt sweetness, along with some dark fruits. Toffee, chocolate, and some faint caramel. A decent roastiness. Some coffee and a little more chocolate. Finishing up with a mild bitterness.  M: A little light for a Russian Imperial Stout.

113,782,genitempo,4.07,"A: Bottled elegantly (I guess you would expect this from the UK) with gold foil surrounding the cap. Label does well presenting an English feel. Beer pours nice, deep dark brown body with little head, mild tan in color. Practically no lace, and what's there diminishes quickly.  S: Since the ABV is not as high as some Impy Stouts, the scent pushes through a little easier, displaying dark fruits, sugar, and a little caramel.  T: Complex, but not overbearing, but not quaint in any form or fashion. Roasted flavors push through but end fairly quickly.  MF: The weakest part of the brew. Not as thick as I like my stouts. I felt like the carbonation bares its face, as well. Which can usually be covered by higher ABV and flavor, which this beer lacks (in a good way, though).

Much more creamy than smokey. Goes down smooth, while it may look fizzy.  M - Incredibly good. The creamy feeling soothes the pallet tremendously.  O - I got this beer on a whim.

Foam fades slowly leaving small amounts of lacing on the glass.  S - Smells of black coffee and cocoa beans. Also a slightly sharp burnt character to the nose. Interestingly, it even has a slightly tangy red wine-like smell to it amid everything else.  T - Hints of caramel and dark fruits (plums, raisins, dates) up front. A dark cocoa bitterness is present toward the middle accompanied by the slightest hint of dry burnt grains that last to the finish. Has an aftertaste of milk chocolate-like acidity, fruity esters, and coffee-bitterness.  M - Medium body with pleasant but not overbearing carbonation.

113,782,magictacosinus,4.73,"Served in a tulip glass. No freshness date on the bottle.  Appearance: Completely pitch black as an ideal imperial stout should be. Pours a ridiculously huge head with brown and reddish hues. The head viciously remains even as the beer warms up.  Smell: Immediately resembles the scent of a coffee and cocoa beans, or a mocha. There are some hints of blackberries and even vanilla beans. Although you can tell that there are a lot of hops present as well as alcohol, these flavorful hues, as well as the creaminess of the beer, makes it so that you don't even notice.  Taste: This is a beer that makes every savoring precious and memorable. It is so flavorful that you can feel your throat warm up in every sip. Throughout the course of drinking it, the most present flavors were that of roasted chestnuts, coffee and dark chocolate.  Mouthfeel: The ""roastiness"" of the malts is immediately apparent on the first sip. The aftertaste proves itself to be bitter and warming. It contains a sweetness that is wonderfully resonating on the palate.  Overall: I've had plenty of incredible stouts so far in my life, but this is a perfect stout in all respects. It's not something I could have casually due to its high alcohol content and extreme maltiness, and for that matter should be treated as a special brew to use for celebratory purposes - especially in sitting down, relaxing, and momentarily forgetting about all of the issues of the world. This is a beer that reminds me of that great moment of sitting by a fireside next someone that you love.  As it warms, the alcohol becomes more readily present, yet it become more enjoyable as coffee beans and roasted chocolate flavors (with caramel!) appeared to explode on my palate. For its price, this may be greatest stout on the planet that happens to be pretty accessible. I found it to be more delicious than Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout, and is ultimately a real treat to be appreciated in every sip.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Now, THIS is the way to kick off my New Beer Sunday!  From the bottle: ""Brewed at Samuel Smith's small, traditional British brewery with well water (the original well sunk in 1758 is still in use), best barley malt, roasted barley, yeast and hops to create a rich flavourful ale; deep chocolate in colour with a roasted barley nose and flavour that is a complexity of malt, hops and yeast. Fermented in 'stone Yorkshire squares'. This distinctive type of ale was originally shipped to Imperial Russia; it was a favourite of Russian nobility.""; Captioning a picture: ""Having imparted their bitterness & aroma, hops are separated from the wort in the hop backs.""  An impressive pour, resulting in two thick fingers of deep-tan head with excellent retention. Color was midnight black with deep-brown highlights at the edges. Nose was rich with coffee, dark chocolate, dried dark fruits, smoke and even some alcohol heat. Whew! Mouthfeel was a little thin for the style, but still bigger and chewier than many other beers. The taste was very bitter, coffee-like, which was perfect since I was having this with and for breakfast. Take that, Catherine the Great! Finish was smoky, bitter, dry, a big Wow!, but without the often overpowering alcohol of its modern American iterations.

Appearance: poured freely into a La Trappe chalice and swirled, this beer first appears deep opaque, but towards the bottom black gives way to mahogany and brass tones. The soupy body is capped with high, frothy brown head. It's like a whipped chocolate nought over a chilled chocolates liquor. Very enticing.  Aroma: consummate Sam Smith, I'll chalk that up to their exceptional yeast strain and premium base malt. Roasted notes and port wine accents peak through and then dominate when drinking. More muted than other Stouts, certainly very mild astringency.  Flavor: immense! No, its not the most complex RIS, thank God. It holds itself together quite well. This beer has clearly matured and I'm glad for it. No doubt, even ""green"" offerings are worthy of Sammy Smith fame. It's the matured version, though, that really provides what this style is all about. Yeast comes thru in a big way. Not like a Belgian, but as a sure supporting role.  The roasted profile hasn't really mellowed, it has settled. Dark crystal malts shine through, backed by a hefty alcohol warmth that settles in the belly. Prune, candied cherries, rum-raisin syrup, fine bitter chocolate, spice cake, Port and currant liquor all share in making the pleasure the coats over the mouth on way to the gut. Roasted qualities never match the level Guinness or your preferred RIS, but provide enough bite to hold this beer together and provide another dimension of flavor.  Hops are mild.... wow! Responsible brewing! It hasn't been lost!  Mouthfeel: I was surprised at the density. At 7% a leaner need might be expected, nut this one was respectable crafted more maturation. That said, it wasn't syrupy... like Dogfish Head beers or certain Winter offerings often are. It was just a beer substantial enough to fit the style, while managing to conclude dry.  One of my all time favorites. Moat will want bigger and wilder and,more eccentric. I prefer this beer for being on Que with style guidelines, but acting in moderation. Make sure your bottle has some age to it, that is the secret ingredient. ;-)",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Rifugium,4.2,"First had: bottle from Total Wine, Cherry Hill, NJ  Pours a dark cola brown-black with bronzed tints, and a pillowy beige head. Roasty malt aroma, sugary, with coffee notes. More dark roasted malts in the taste, molasses, licorice, coffee bitterness. Not quite full-bodied, but quite rich and tasty, and a very drinkable stout.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,TheBeerAlmanac,3.06,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass  A: Pours a translucent black with very little head.  S: There is some coffee in the aroma but not much else. Maybe it was just my bottle, but I was really surprised at the lack of odor. Hell, make the cap out of chocolate or something, I don’t know, just give me more.  T: Fortunately, it tastes good…for a porter. It has a medium amount of carbonation and a smooth body. There are notes of coffee and a nutty finish. As far as beer goes, it’s a solid offering. As far as imperial stouts go, it’s about as bland as it gets.  Don’t expect a true, strong imperial experience with this one, just take it for what it is. And that is a good, smooth beer. With gold foil. Shiny, gold foil.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,woosterbill,4.28,"Bottle from 1988 (yes, you read that right) poured into a Weyerbacher tulip. Thanks to Knifestyles for sharing this bit of vintage excitement.  A: Black body with clear brown highlights underneath and incredibly nice, persistent ring of frothy tan foam. Just lovely considering its age.  S: Oxidized, but not terribly so. Malt, cardboard, chocolate and coffee. Toasty, bready, slightly roasty. Quite nice for what it is.  T: Intensely flavorful, with some meaty saltiness, spicy chocolate, and dark fruit. Only light cardboard. Tastes great for such an ancient bottle.  M: Slick medium body with soft carbonation. Fantastic.  O: What a pleasant surprise. I never expected a 7% beer to hold up whatsoever over the course of 23 years, but I'll be damned if this wasn't a genuinely enjoyable brew. The oxidation was kept acceptably in the background, and the weird mutations of maltiness were allowed freedom to shine with flavor. Very cool.

113,782,Hojaminbag,3.65,"Sam Smith Imperial Stout has a black, thick-looking body with a solid head about as tall as a finger. Retention is good, and the lacing is OK.  The aroma is a little bit boozy, with a lot of chocolate and a little bit of roasted malt.  The flavor is both large and rich. Black malt and loads of chocolate and coffe are the strongest flavors, followed by dark fruit and a little bit of anise. There is some sweet, molasses like malt flavors in there also. The slight taste of alcohol sneaks into the finish, with a moderate amount of bitterness.  Big, smooth mouthfeel, pretty good.  I got this bottle at a bar, and I would guess that it spent 8-12 months in the fridge.

113,782,jacobseyb,3.8,"Samuel Smith's Old Brewery does a great job with the old style Russian Imperial Stout. The beer pours a dark, deep brown nearly opaque, and has a slight head at one finger, that dissipates quickly and laces slightly. Smell is generally coffee malts with some chocolate and a slight bit of hops, primarily floral in nature, mostly for bitterness. Taste is very much chocolate-coffee in nature, with little hop flavoring. Maybe a hair of floral hops. Anyway, feel is smooth, with a slight carbonation, some oiliness, and a generally full body. Overall, Samuel Smith's has done a great one with a style that they probably have been doing for nearly a century. I enjoyed it and will have it again.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

T&M- Very malty, super sweet with a bitter finish. Some chocolate notes coming through and a bit of a warm booze tinge. The feel is creamy, smooth, and heavy.  A good beer, but I felt it was either too sweet for the amount of bitterness or too bitter for the amount of sweetness.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,rickyleepotts,2,"It smells wet. There is no better way to explain it. Not a big nose, with subtle chocolate notes. The beer is very thick, though. But that’s okay… most stouts, especially imperial stouts, are meant to be dessert beers. There is no way you could drink one more of these beers. This beer is actually a Russian imperial stout… I am not sure what that means, but we shall see.  The beer is VERY thick on the tongue, and has a immediate sweetness to it. Then it just hangs back on the tongue as the sweetness continues around the mouth. The beer as a pretty high ABV, coming in at 7%… but doesn’t drink that big. As thick as this beer pours, and as smooth as it tastes it doesn’t make me think stout. Let alone imperial stout. (Or Russian imperial stout, whatever that means!)  The beer is good. I would buy it again, mainly because they are cheap. Cheaper than most beers in a bottle this size. I actually like their brown more than this. But it’s thick and black, and would go well with a nice cigar or meat based meal. Man… I wanted it to be so much more. As we move along 1001 bottles… I am sure I will be let down time and time again!

113,782,CwrwAmByth,4.33,"Poured from a 335 ml bottle into a Samuel Smith pint glass.  Appears the darkest black you can imagine, classic Russian Imperial Stout here!  With the smell i'm getting roasted notes, coffee, alcohol reminiscent of Capt Morgans Rum with a slight hint of spicy fruit too.  Tastes incredibly roasted and burnt, very dry. Also a slight sweetness, but nothing like the RISs with dark syrupy coffee and dark chocolate tastes i've had before. Hops are present in the background as well, also a bitterness.

113,782,deadonhisfeet,4.33,"I stored this beer in the fridge and let it sit on the counter for about 30 minutes before pouring into a tulip-shaped snifter. It poured out super black with a perfect light tan frothy head that quickly dissipates. I swear I could smell this beer before I even stuck my nose into the glass. Coffee, chocolate, and toast.  This beer is incredibly well balanced. It is neither sweet, nor bitter. Moreover, the flavor is divine. You taste the malt first, nuts and molasses, then coffee and more nuts. It has a finish just dry enough to leave you wanting more. This beer is very complex. At various times I swear I tasted hazelnut, sarsaparilla, nutmeg, raisins, and whoppers candy (or maybe I just had something stuck in my teeth). Despite this, it is very smooth and easy to drink.  It has been a while since I drank a bottle of this classic beer. It's better than I remember it and I should go back to this more often. So should you.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

113,782,SylviaFaye,4.73,"As this stout pours into the glass, you can visually see how viscous it is. The body from the start of the pour to the final luscious capping is so dark that it puts abandoned mine shafts to shame. Good luck finding your way through if you dare to search for the other side. The thick, 1-inch toffee-colored head causes the beer to match quite well with it's bottle (which is topped with gold foil).  Coffee and toffee aromas rise from the liquid, but the most predominate smell is that of chocolate liqueur.  Sweet mocha waves wash over the tongue, culminating in a gentle apple bread pull at the finish, which leaves the mouth feeling faintly hoppy in all of its crevices. As this sensation fades, a bubblegum sweetness takes over, caressing the roof of the mouth.  How can a beer be so simultaneously thick and smooth? The intoxicating fullness was enough to bring tears to my eyes.  Overall: Forgive me for my sentimentality, but I may have just found my soul mate. Thank you, beer gods.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

The smell is dark and earthy with a hint of hops and roasted malts. As the beer opens up hints of dark chocolate come through.  The taste is a mix of bitter and sweet, with the bitter overpowering in the beginning giving way to some sweetness on the finish. A pleasant hopped mouthfeel lingers on afterwards.

113,782,Spider889,4.28,"For whatever reason Samuel Smith is everywhere, and yet I don't ever recall seeing this around town until yesterday. Bought this very cheap at From the Vine. ($3.99 I believe)  Pours a thick jet black, with a fast rising mocha colored head. Decent retention and thin veins of lace arching across my snifter.  Smells very rich. Decadent sweet dark chocolate and dense roasted barley. A little char in there from the malt, and toffee on the finish.  The flavor is very nice here. This is an excellent RIS brewed very classically. You first notice how sweet this is. Fudge brownie meets vanilla bean. Then there are notes of bitter black coffee. Roasted barley flavors finish the beer off with more bitterness and ash.  Very smooth, I wouldn't be surprised if there were some oats hiding in here. The alcohol isn't hidden from the flavor profile, but it's not really hot or anything.  Overall a wonderful beer.

I think Todd (Alstrom Bros) pretty much hit the nail on the head with his summary. Aroma, taste, mouthfeel, etc. is spot-on. So rather than repeat his review, I'll just refer to it. Done.  Definitely a classic and an outstanding take on the style.

The flavor was not nearly as strong or intense as a typical Imperial Stout. There was a better balance of the roasted chocolate, malts, and coffee flavors. Incredibly smooth and mellow for an Imperial. More like their Oatmeal Stout than an Imperial. But that was fine with me. I love their Oatmeal stout as well.  Mouth feel was excellent for this style.

Mouthfeel is a bit thin for the style, if I must find something, but hardly worth mentioning. Overall a very nice Imperial Stout.

S: Dark chocolate, caramel, bitter fruit and alcohol; I even get a little bit of subtle banana. There's a lot going on in here, but it smells very cohesive.  T: Intense dark fruit up front, followed by sweet dark malts and lots of dark chocolate. Extremely complex, with everything working in perfect harmony.  M: The moderately heavy carbonation takes what seems at first like a rather thin stout and transforms it into a creamy, almost chewy drink. Velvety smooth, and perfect for the style.  O: Figured I'd re-review this one given the fact that I haven't had a bottle in close to a year.

113,782,Boitnott,4.53,"Samuel Smith has built up a reputation in my book as one of the premier English brewers that are available in the US. Time and time again they prove their exceptional craft skill and Sammy Smith Imperial Stout is no exception. It looks rather impressive with a beautiful light brown head that retains for awhile, and has great lacing. This head goes well with the opaque black color that lets no light through; exactly what I would expect for an Imperial Stout.  The stellar appearance compliments the impressive dark, rich grains spell that ruminate from the glass. For the homebrewers out there, imagine the fresh smell of a mash pot with imperial stout grains in them. This lead right into the taste with a strong malty nose that tastes of black, brown , and chocolate malts. These combine excellently to create an excellent taste on the palette. The finish brings the a taste reminiscent of the smell, and this lasts throughout to entice the next sip. This quality has become a determining factor for me. A beers finish must last in my mouth until I take that next sip. No hop content is present but who wants that in there Imperial stout? Mouthfeel is excellent with perfect carbonation and an unnoticeable alcohol presence. The heavy body make multiples of these tough, but it is so good that this may not be an issue.  Samuel Smith continues to impress me. This is a great brew to pick up if you are looking for under $5.

S - Roasted malts, milk chocolate, very milky... not to the point of being bad, but a little surprising. The subtle dark fruits and caramel are masked greatly by the lactose aroma.  T - Roasted malts, milk chocolate with an emphasis on milk! Lots of lactose type flavors, not spoiled, but more of a milk stout than imperial, chalky/coffee finish.

113,782,Kvlterbm,4.22,"A: Pours a deep, dark brown that borders on black. Fairly vigorous pour resulted in about a finger's worth of mocha colored head. The head died down pretty quickly, but what was left of it left some nice lacing on the sides of the glass.  S: Big notes of roasted barley, some coffee, chocolate notes, and some sweetness/dark fruits. At 7.5% the alcohol's not very present, aside from a pleasant warming as you drink.  T: The same roasted flavor detected in the nose, bolder coffee. The dark fruits make themselves known, melding very nicely with some earthy, grassy flavors.  M: Medium bodied with good carbonation.  Overall, very impressed. A damn good Imperial Stout, and I'm looking forward to getting more.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,mattgreger,4.85,"The pour on this brew super dark. Not quite a solid black, actually a brownish/black. It had a beautiful mocha colored head. It had some pretty good retention. As the head on this brew faded, it left a nice lace as it falls down the sides of the glass.  This brew has a light chocolate aroma with hints grass, sugars and just a touch of fruit. I am detecting orange more then anything else.  From the first sip this brew is impressive. It a beautifully thick body, especially for the size of the brew., with some great chewy malts. It has dark chocolates and toffee flavors that give this brew some great balance. It feeds into a great taste of some dark fruits, which I am detecting some raisins, plums, and maybe some peaches. The touch of orange is there too, that I detected in the aroma. As the brew warmis, that alcohol is present, not to much, but a great warming feeling none the less.  This is a medium to fulled bodied brew. It doesn't have very much carbonation at all. It does have a nice smooth feel as you drink. As I said above, it has a nice, yet soft warming feel and a great sipping brew.  This brew was wondefully rich. Its a great brew. Something I could never turn down. Its has a great feel, but isn't so strong that you have to worry about the ABV. It has a great drinkability.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

T-A bit of roasted malts with some caramel and a mild bitterness.  M-Very, very watery... reminds of me of weak, watery coffee. A little bit of carbonation.  D-This beer isn't disgusting by any means, but it's far below my expectation of what an RIS is.

S - Sweet milk chocolate and dark cocoa, some leafy green hops also coming through.  T - Dark cocoa and milk chocolate, though comes through more bitter than the nose implies. Roasted characteristics are nicely balanced with some light espresso and nutty notes also making an appearance.  M - I found this one a bit light on carbonation, coming off a tad watery and in need of a bit of a lift.  O - Overall a very tasty imperial stout and highly recommended to any fan of the style.

113,782,stmod,4.42,"Even I drank lots of beers (of many types) in the past, this is my first review.  I am just starting to try to understand beer and I would do this also by reviewing them.  So, let's go to the review:  Appearance: Very dark color, less head I was bargain for.  Smell: I got traces of chocolate and roasted and a general balanced complex smell that I was not able to disaggregate.  Taste: I got bitter from start to end. I was bargain for more structured taste, instead it gave me a good sense of balanced simplicity (sure, this is not a lager, but the drinkability is too much for me for this kind of beer).  Mouthfeel: Little carbonation.  Overall: I was bargain for a more outstanding alchoolic aspect, while this beer hide this characteristic inside a balanced group of aromas where bitter and roast dominates. The alchool come out in your mouth after a while you finished the beer. I had just one, and I was ready for the second, even if, I suspect, the alchool would hit me too much.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,AgentMunky,4.1,"Poured from a 12 ounce (355mL) bottle into a cervoise glass. Best before 12 March (whoops).  A: Thick head has good retention. The body is completely opaque and the darkest of browns. Good looking stout.  S: Deeper than I initially gave it credit for. Alcohol-soaked fruit, coffee beans, chocolate, molasses.  T: Hrm...Subdued (raw) molasses notes float around. The maintaste is unexpectedly fruity (apples, grapes). The aftertaste showcases the gentle bitterness of this imperial stout, providing dark chocolate with a touch of carbonation. Overall, splendidly balanced.  M: A bit too light, I feel. Served near the recommended 60 degrees, but I might have preferred it a mite colder if that made the body more viscous.  D: Very drinkable, and a bargain at the price (£2). Certainly recommended. Will drink again.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

113,782,shand,4.41,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a snifter.  An aggressive pour yields a tiny head that quickly dissaptes leaving wisps of head in the glass. Lacing is considerable. The beer itself is a garnet-tinged black. The aroma on this is fantastic. Roasted malts, dark fruits, and a touch of chocolate dance around my nose. It seriously smells so good. Taste-wise, the dark fruits (cherries and figs) hit the tongue first, and they sure are great! If first impressions made a brew, this'd be a 5 for taste for sure. However, when the fruits begin to exit, the rest of the flavors, although quite well-done, aren't quite as jaw-dropping. It's the same-old drill, roasted malts and chocolate. There's just a touch of a hop presence to round things out.  The mouthfeel is good, if unremarkable. It's a bit sharp at first, but mellows out to a nice creaminess. On the lighter-side of full-bodied. The drinkability? Off the charts for the style. My snifter disappeared in 20 minutes, which is crazy for a RIS. This might be helped by the lower ABV than is typical for the style, but this is quite drinkable no matter what you call it. This is the rarity - an Imperial Stout that I could work into a beer rotation! This is an immensely drinkable RIS that I absolutely love. It's a classic for good reason. Highly recommended.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,yourchoice,3.77,"Catching up on some notes from the last couple weeks...  A- Pours very dark, almost black with a light brown/dark tan head. Minimal lacing.  S- Raisins and figs with a malt background.  T- A bitter chocolate is very present, with a slightly sweeter raisiny flavor.  M- very slight carbonation, medium body....thinner than I expected.

Not necessarily a ""bad"" thing, but I expected more from the beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,kwjd,3.84,"Pours a dark brown colour with thin pale tan head. No lacing is left on the glass and the head seems to dissipate fairly quickly. Smells of roasted malt, with a faint hint of chocolate and cherries. Some tartness is in the flavour, but it works nicely with the roast. Silky mouthfeel.

Scattered lacing. Excellent clarity and when the light shines, cherry hues come through.  S: Graham, molasses, copper, figs. Pretty good, but not particularly complex for the genre.  T: Lots of toasty, dark malts. More bitter than I had anticipated. Nice actually, but not great.  M: Good full bodied with low carb and good slick feel on the finish. Great body and mouthfeel on this.  D: Very drinkable, paticularly for an impy stout (at ABV 7%, I would dispute this). As a stout, outstanding, as an impy stout, okay.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,glassjaw25,4.41,"I think this is a great Imperial Stout. The nice thing about this beer is that I believe it can be drinkable to the Stout lover and even someone who may not be a big Stout fan. This stout has a stronger bite than a Guinness but nowhere near as close to Stone Russian Imperial Stout.  The look of this beer is fantastic, very dark in color and a nice tan head. For an Imperial Stout, I find this beer to be more drinkable than other imperial stouts probably due to the boarder line abv.  For someone that is new to drinking Imperial Stout, I would suggest trying this beer.

The aroma is of a good, dark malt character but also a tad boozy. It seemed boozier in aroma than the 7% ABV would imply. The body is nice and bold. The taste is a fine balance of coffee, yeast, and a wonderfully dry finish.

113,782,veinless,3.97,"Pours a fluid jet black, with complete opacity, and a healthy two finger head that dissipates quickly without leaving too much lace. Is sort of fizzy, which was unexpected for a RIS.  Smell is of roasty caramel and malt, with some toasted grain in the back and molasses coming to mind near the middle. No coffee or chocolate notes - this looks to be a straight shooting roasted beast. Even get a bit of char at the very end. Great nose.  Taste follows pretty closely, with the molasses coming out a lot more than in the aroma, and a bit of sour twang coming in from the hops or something else. Roasted malt leaves a slight bitterness on the tongue resembling coffee. Middle is a bit watery for my taste, but it does carry the beer well enough. Nuttiness is present at the beginning of each sip which is a nice touch.  Mouthfeel is pretty good, although watery in the middle as I mentioned, but very well aided by the carbonation and is reasonably well-bodied for the beginning and end of each sip. Drinkability is great, as this beer doesn't assault you with flavors, but rather allows them to come out softly of their own accord. Amount of flavor for the 7% abv is admirable as well considering the style. Finish could be a little bit better, as it is only kind of bitter and a tad watery, while I'd prefer it to be either neutral or heavily bitter, but it is good nonetheless. Really good, affordable, and common RIS; I'd buy this again for sure.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Dark chocolate and toffee comprise the better part of the aroma with slight espresso and nutty notes. Deep roasty espresso and dark chocolate dominate the flavor with slight herbal and toffee notes make up the flavor with just hints of herbal hops. Fairly dry finish. Medium to full in body with medium carbonation. One sip definitely invites another. Roasty and fairly dry. A bit of a sipper though one sip invites another. Wow. Another slam-dunk for Samuel Smiths.

Good sweetness up front in the forms of molasses and dark fruit. The back end offers up roasted malts and coffee bean with a touch of alcohol.  Smooth with lots of creamy carbonation and a dry finish. The body is thinner for the style, but feels good considering it is only seven percent alcohol.

Smell: Very dark, fruity aroma, primarily raisin and plum. Some roasted malt and chocolate, as well as a bit of alcohol.  Taste: Raisin and chocolate are the frontrunners in this beer. A hint of coffee in the finish. Pretty one-dimensional, and not very bold, however.  Mouthfeel: Medium with high carbonation. OK, but the excess carbonation doesn't belong with the style.  Drinkability: It's actually quite a sessionable beer.  Final notes: Not bad, not great. I would consider drinking this again if it weren't for the price.

113,782,JohnQVegas,4.22,"12 oz bottle into Sam Smith's tulip pint - I've had this one before, but the review got eaten by the random review eating monster that lurks in the depths of the site, waiting to eat up random, occasional reviews, never to be seen again.  Pours pitch black, with a creamy, one-finger tan head. Nice enough lacing.  Nose is sweet, mix of blackberries and dark chocolate, and an almost nutty roastiness underneath - light and inviting. Lightly roasted coffee, and a nice, dark breadiness as well.  Taste is beautiful, classic and decidedly old school. Earthy roast, dark fruit with just a hint of tartness, a finish that's nutty, a bit roasty, dark chocolate, bit of licorice, lingering earthy bitterness, bit of oiled leather, hinting at smoke, just a tiny bit of alcohol shows through just enough on the tail end of the finish. Very subtle, but timeless and fantastic.  Mouthfeel is a bit on the thinner side, a bit sharp, though still with a light creaminess to it. Very dry, finish is quite long.  Drinkability is fantastic.

Mounds of dark tan colored head, and an opaque black colored body that allows some ruby red highlights on the edge of the glass.  The aroma is very chocolaty, along with some milk and metallic characteristics.  The taste is very milk chocolaty, along with hints of coffee and caramel.

113,782,BBP,4.05,"A- Pours dark with a decent mocha brown head. Good carbonation and lacing.  S- Coffee, chocolate, and rum. A hint of booze. Notes of raisin. Quite complex and nice, although a little hard to pick up.  T- There's a ton of raisin and plum flavor mixed into the chocolate and rum notes. Coffee comes into the aftertaste a little. It has some milkiness to it which lightens it up and balances a bit with the drier cocoa notes and bitterness. While I thought it tasted nice, it also seemed a bit off of what I'm used to. It doesn't seem all too much like most of the other imperial stouts I'm used to. There was a bit more sweetness in this than I would have liked without the bitterness to back it up.  M- Creamy, smooth, and medium full. This goes down superbly. Slightly dry, sticky finish. Carbonation is just how it should be.  D- On the lighter side of imperial stouts for sure. It goes down quite easy, but isn't a regular stout by any means in flavor or alcohol presence. The ABV sneaks up on you as you can drink this fast. It also has the slightest amount of heat to it.  Quite interesting to have the dark fruit play a role in this after having more run of the mill imperial stouts as well. That being said, my personal preferences were probably better off without it.

I'll probably pass out from drinking this but whatever.  It pours a foamy tan head that dissipates quickly and smells of chocolate, coffee, sweet malt, and a bit of liquorice.  This is a good imperial stout. It's full of flavor with roasted coffee dominating and then chocolate and coffee bitterness balancing it out.

I am not entirely impressed with the lacing, but there is some present.  Chocolate is the main player in the smell with some brown sugar and roasty-ness. I am confused by the dry fruity tones. It is hard to place but it smells somewhat like sour grapes. I saw soy sauce in a recent review and have to agree.  This is a rather refreshing drink. It is on the gentle side of imperial stouts but lends to drinkability. Milk chocolate starts the taste and transitions to a roasty, chalky finish.  Soft and medium in the mouth, I really like the feel. The finish is clean and dry for the style.  This is very drinkable and a nice change of pace from the big stouts I've been drinking lately.

Taste: Roasted malt, unsweetened dark chocolate, a bit of espresso. Some cocoa and molasses add some sweetness. The chocolate flavors grow and eventually take control. The finish is lightly bitter, but also a bit sweet and fairly roasted.  Mouthfeel: For an RIS, this is not the fullest body, but that was expected with the 7% ABV.

Beer produces a mild nose with hints of toasted malt and caramel.  I like the flavor, but it's somewhat subdued for an Imperial Stout. I'd call it spot on if it were a stout-- but when I see ""Imperial"" on the bottle I expect ""up-front and center"". So maybe this might be an ""Imperial"" with a small ""i"".  Beer's flavor is chock-a-block full of hops, toasted malt and caramel. The flavor stance is lighter especially considering an Imperial Stout.  Beer has a very cordial mouthfeel with a long lasting finish and a ""coating"" like feel. And enough ""life"" in the flavor to make for a long enticing finish.  Drinkability is superior espeically for an Imperial in that the ABV is under 10% and the general demeanor of this libation is that of a strong ale.

M: Rich but not too thick. Becomes more thin as it warms up while drinking.  D: Great for a nightcap, especially when the heat is out at your house in winter, like it is in mine.  I like this as I am exploring this style.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,K7online,4.43,This beer is a gem among stouts. From the moment you pour it you will notice the nice thick body and the gracious crown that forms. That crown will hold for a long time.  The aroma is subtle and you immediately detect the coffee that is infused. The coffee taste is of course found at first sip. Notes of vanilla come to mind and molasses. It is light on the palette and does not overwhelm you with its malt flavor.  Overall this beer is offers great enjoyment and is a good accompaniment for food or just watching a game.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Onenote81,4,"Split this bottle with my wife. Poured my allotment into a small stemless cocktail glass. [*Note: A buddy had just given me this glass, and I don't drink cocktails, so why not a RIS?] Paired this with a big slice of dark chocolate cake.  Pours a deep dark black. Pours thinner than I'd have thought. A small tan head blankets the deep black abyss. Light lace left behind. The nose is really sweet with notes of dairy, chocolate, toffee, and sweet warm bread. Faint alcohol tones on the finish, but very light.  The mouth is creamy and smooth. Much more so than expected with the thin pour. The chocolate comes through in the flavor, but is much sweeter like milk choc., rather than dark choc. Licorice and butter toffee round this out. Easy-drinking ""big"" stout. With the lower ABV compared to its contemporaries in the style, this would be a great one to sit back and enjoy most any evening.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,TheFightfan1,4.28,Poured into a snifter. Opague black with a very thick light brown heading that does stick around a while. Very impressive looking.  Smell is mostly of roasted malts. Some coffee notes as well as some black licorice. Heavy syrup-molasses aroma.  Taste is toasty to say the least. Some dark chocolate notes that mix well with a somewhat lactic sourness.Coffee and molasses barge in for a smooth finish.  Mouth is velevet like. Super smooth texture and a solid full body. Awesome carbonation tingles on the tongue. There is a lactic like gritiness left in the mouth afterwards.  A solid R.I.S. I must say easily available in all areas and a must trying for veterans and beginner's of the style.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,gskitt,3.98,"Poured into a etched imperial pint glass. Pours a very dark color with a medium brown head that just stays forever. Smells of plump dark fruits, and crusts of brown bread. Some bourbon on the nose as well. Tastes of dark rye bread, some licorice as well, and some vanilla and some expresso bitterness at the end. Smooths and evens out as you drink, smooth mouthfeel, not as thick as i would have thought. This is a very drinkable RIS.

Pitch black beer, light brown head that retains forever (at least half an hour) and leaves light lacing. Nothing more you could ask for.  S: The nose is more muted than the taste. Molasses and licorice dominate.  T: Marevelously complex. It changes with time. Molasses, licorice, cocoa, coffee, black cherry... Stuff I just can't even begin to nail down. Nice sweetness that is more dominant than the bitterness.  M: Strong carbonation, slick in the mouth and the sweetness is not cloying.  D: Gorgeous beer.

M: Very smooth and creamy - this stout coats the tongue and leaves a nice coffee aftertaste and a dry finish.  D: Drinkability is very high with this stout due to the great taste and low abv.

Smell: Toasted malt, roasted barley, with some coffee and cocoa. Not sweet exactly. There's some amount of dark fruitiness too. No definitive hop aroma, but some alcohol smell.  Taste: Toasted malts and a milky flavor dominate for me, with chocolate and coffee on the side. Not sweet but not dry. Very balanced. Hints of fruit, not as much as the smell. a nice bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Milky and creamy. Some alcohol vapors, but not at all harsh.  Drinkability: I'd have another. I like that it's a little less alcoholic than other RISes, because then I can definitely have a few.

The initial aroma of is highly dominant of spiced licorice with notes of dark fruits, caramel and malts. The initial flavors were predominantly of licorice , with light roast, hints of dark fruits and light caramel. The brew had a medium body with light carbonation.  Overall, this was an interesting Russian imperial. I think that on most days I wouldn't be fond of the overwhelming licorice, but this was actually quite nice and well rounded.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,aasher,4.5,"This beer poured a dark, dark brown to black in color with a three finger medium, soft and spongy moderate khaki head. The aromas are very surprising. Oddly enough, the first aroma that hits the nose is of bacon fat. It has slight smoked notes that are driving me nuts. At this point in the evening, I'm totally digging it. Aside from that you get some roasted and dark malts with a subtle sweetness. The flavors are pretty solid too. It begins with silky smooth chocolate before going into light coffee and roasted malts. It's an excellent mix! Everything is blended so well together. I can't believe I waited so long to finally try this one. It drinks medium bodied and is very smooth going down. The mouthfeel is on point. It's perfect. I honestly cannot believe I'm enjoying this so much. I never expected a beer of this caliber from Sam Smith. This is one of the most drinkable RIS around.

M - med bodied, smooth, slightly carbonated, creamier compared to some stouts, coffee choco at start, then hoppy in the middle then both at the finish with a little aftertaste of bitter chocolate that lingers for awhile, not bad.

Good unsweetened chocolate, pronounced coffee, some licorice and molasses notes. M- Full, but roughly average body for style. Low carbonation, but appropriate. D- A splendidly drinkable RIS.

Bit of alcohol in the nose as well.  T & M - Creamy and smooth. Roasted chocolate and ripe dark fruits. Lots of roasted goodness. Some herbal hop notes here and there, but malty sweetness wins out in every sip. This one coats your tongue in the best way possible. Delicious.  D - Very very tasty and not super high abv for an Imperial Stout.  Sometimes Russian Imperials are too sweet for me, but this one is very well balanced.

There's a subtle sweetness with a note of sourness like sour cherries with maybe a hint of chocolate. T - Taste is full and malty. Almost no hop bitterness, just a bit of sourness in the finish that seems to be characteristic of all their beers. M - Mouthfeel is heavy and full, without being unctuous. There's a creaminess to this beer, but not so much as something like a Guinness. D - The sourness of British ales has always been a little bit of a turn off for me. I enjoy them, but not in quantity. I tend to prefer the crisp hoppy bite of American ales, rather than the smooth, sour creaminess of British beers.

113,782,bamadog,4.32,"Finally picked a bottle of this up after walking by it for a couple of years. Review is from notes taken on 1/27/2011 and poured from a 355 ml bottle to a snifter.  Appearance: Pour is darkest brown/near black and it starts with a solid 1 and 1/2 finger dark tan creamy head that fades slowly to a full and complete skim on the surface; body is dark and entirely opaque; it does look a little thinner than some other imperial stouts, but I predict a moderately thick body overall;  Smell: After the pour, I can smell it from my table -- scents of dark bittersweet and a touch of sweet chocolate; a definite sweet nuttiness actually; a bit of a sweet, dark fruitiness -- like cherry is in there too (I wonder if it will provide any tartness?); a slight bit of a roast coffee maltiness; really an excellent smelling beer.  Taste: Oh my -- freaking excellent -- I can't believe I've waited this long to try this beer. Taste really matches the nose to a ""T"" -- lots of dark bittersweet and the hints of slightly sweeter chocolate; definite dark fruity/cherry aspect that actually does have an ever-so-slight bit of tartness to it that provides some nice balance to the roasty bitterness from the dark and roasty/burnt maltiness.  Mouthfeel: Ha, my prediction was right -- a moderately thick body that isn't overwhelmingly chewy or anything; carbonation is present and starts out pretty strong when it hits the palate, but it finishes pretty smooth; a moderately thick sticky coating that is moderately dry sticks around the entire palate and even into the back of the throat.  Drinkability: This is a great beer that seems to be readily available -- excellent flavors and scents that aren't so massive that they wreck your palate or anything; body isn't too thick or heavy either, so it's not as if it weighs you down. Really, a great choice and I can see what it has the ratings it does.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Darker fruits like grapes plums and figs are present, along with roasted and malted barley.  T: Fantastically smooth and fresh coffee and chocolate flavors. Fruity, malty and grainy all at once. Not much else to say. Perfectly balanced.  M: Sticky, milky, and syrupy. Medium to full body, medium to low carb. Aftertaste is a little funky, but shouldn't take away too much from the 'final grade'  D: One of the best. Ever.

A: Pours a pitch black with a billowing, dense, thick, light brown head that slowly receded into a thick frothy film that left great streaks of lacing down the glass. S: Thick unsweetened chocolate syrupy, licorice, and sweet roasted malts. T: Notes of roasted grains, caramelized sugar, molasses, brown sugar, caramel, and just a hint of chocolate. Finish is clean and sweet with just a faint hint of alcohol. Aftertaste shows some coffee and roasted marshmallows. M: Soft medium-full body and for the most part a creamy mouthfeel. Everything falls a little flat in the finish though. Carbonation is minimal. D: Great straight forward clean flavor. Not the most rich, potent or flavorful of the style, but it doesn't have to be. This is a great easy drinking RIS, and while I may not prefer it to Old Rasputin or Ten FIDY, I can see how this is considered one of the best.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

The head dissipates leaving a light foam over the top that drapes some nice lacing along the glass.  Nice aroma. Starts with some sweet toffee/coffee notes followed by black licorice. A little dark fruit aroma blends with a slight hint of bourbon/rum.  Tasty flavors that are combined pleasantly: coffee, caramel, raisins, and chocolate. Only a hint of tartness at the end. No real notice of alcohol.  Creamy mouthfeel that is lighter than the most prominent American craft stouts. But, the lower comparative abv makes it more drinkable.

It's a solid looking beer, but I'm not all that impressed.  The nose is predominantly chocolatey with good roasty notes. It's not overwhelming in any way, but it's very solid.  The taste is dominated by the roast. It's pleasant and not astringent. The beer isn't overwhelming in any way, but it's very solid. This isn't what I expect from a RIS, but maybe that's my American palate. The mouthfeel is somewhat thin, but the carbonation makes up for that. It's extremely drinkable and I'm enjoying this quite a bit. It's not an ""Oh my God"" experience, but I'd definitely drink one again.

Just barely a sweet smell along with a touch of alcohol.  T - Umm chocolate explodes in the taste first. Mocha and coffee are not far behind. The dark fruit lines up and you taste that as well. Just barely a hint of the sweetness that you smell but it is perfect.  M - Creamy all the way. Medium bodied. Covers the mouth in goodness.  D - 100% yes. This is a damn smooth stout.

Black and completely opaque.  S: Dark roasted malts, prune, molasses, dark chocolate  T: The roasted malts, prune, and molasses come through first and fairly strong with just a little floral hops in the background. It then smooths out while the dark chocolate comes in strong with a nice kick of sweetness. Finish is bitter sweet chocolate, prune, and molasses. This has a solid level of depth and complexity, one of the more enjoyable ""prune"" stouts.  M: Medium carbonation, medium to full body, extremely smooth with a good viscosity. It coats the entire pallet. Velvety smooth texture that goes down extremely easily. One of the better textures I've had, only a little more viscosity could improve this one.  D: I found myself drinking this rather quickly. I just couldn't enough of the progression from roasted malts/prune to sweet velvety chocolate. The fact that it's just 7% alcohol is pretty amazing, it's completely hidden.  This might not be the biggest, most robust, most extreme stout out there, but for 7% ABV, it's hard to beat.

Retention is robust as the cap settles slowly and sheds lots of lacing on the glass.  Nose offers notes of chocolate and carob and the telltale yeast notes of the brewery, manifested here with a vinous cherry scent. Clean and bright for the style and quite pleasant.  Flavor follows suit with chocolate up front and offering a somewhat dry finish overall with a touch of fruit in the background. A nice and drinkable RIS that doesn't tackle the senses.

113,782,Smakawhat,4.25,"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass. Big Fist full of head and a great milk chocolate bubble look. Dark brown off the pour like varnish for a body and light brown hues on the edges. Really nice head cap on this with great retention.  Great balance of malt and milk chocolate smell and nuts and even a little bit of vinegar hidden in the background. Really good, even some tobacco, nice bouquet on this stout.  Taste is a great malt and somewhat butter, but some sour fruit that's quite pleasant. Alcohol, banana, and roast coffee on the finish compete with a chocolate middle palate taste. Some carbonation in the middle palate also, but tolerable at least.  For the inexpensive price and pocket size go to feel of the bottle, this is a great go to stout which just makes drinkability a little better than good.

S- The nose is a little hot and offers a good amount of anise, dark chocolate, and just a shade of roasted malt. The nose is actually pretty dry overall.  T- Dry roasted malt, a hint of plum, and dark chocolate. The finish adds a touch of anise and leaves a moderate, dry roasted malt bitterness.  M-Medium bubbly carbonation and a moderately thick, vinous body. Slightly dry, slightly velvety.  D- This is a good beer overall-I guess it can take partial credit for making imperial stouts a popular style. I'm actually surprised at the roasted character of this one.

113,782,PeprSprYoFace,4.12,Picked this one up to review. Never had it before mainly because I didn't really think about Samuel Smiths stuff. Looks really commercialized so I pretty much ignored it when I would go to the store. Glad I've tried this beer and their oatmeal stout now.  Pours a deep black. Deeep black. Very thin tan head that dissapated to a ring. Not alot of lacing.  Aroma is the best part. Dark fruits and toasted sugars and caramel. A slight roast with a sort of boost aroma. Smells awesome.  Taste is mostly roast forward with some dark fruits thrown in. A little bit of sweet caramel and a bitter roast in the finish.  Mouthfeel is good. Nice maltiness and a good carb.  Overall an awesome beer. They should cange their marketing because it sucks I never had their beers before.

Smell: Chocolate malts, some roasted notes coming through, dried fruit, raisons, more chocolaty malts.  Taste: Delicious. The raisins come through stronger, but not at all overpowering. I would love to try this fresh and see what fresher hops could do to this flavor. Not overly complex, but well executed and rich in all aspects. The chocolate malts are pulling me away for another drink...  Mouthfeel: Thick and creamy  Drinkability: Had a 550ML, could have easily had another.

113,782,TheHammer,4.01,"Had this one at Chester's Beers of the World, which was a very nice place. Keep in mind, I had slightly more then a half yard of Strongbow at a nearby restaurant, stopped in at Chester's to warm up (being a Canuck) before heading to another pub for two pints of Moosehead and then heading home  Appearance: Black as scrooge's heart pre-ghost of Christmas future with a solid thumb of creamy head that laced somewhat and retained exceptionally well. Not much more to say.  Smell: I'm certainly getting a nice predominantly smokey aroma from this one with a touch of fruity berries with chocolate and coffee notes. The smoke asserts quite a bit more then anything else and warming doesn't really change much of the beer.  Taste: Very nice, starts with a healthy dose of roasted malt that expertly comes across as well roasted and not burnt with some berry notes. It then turns to a more smokey flavour as mild hops make an early appearance with a touch of licorice. The hops continue a very mild end as a slight touch of coffee and chocolate ends the experience. It just squeezes in at 4.5 thought mainly because the smokiness is quite dominant. Still it hides it's alcohol content very well.  Mouthfeel: Nice and creamy with ample carbonation, amazing transitioning and a mild chocolate, coffee and smoke aftertaste the by no means overstays it's welcome. The only thing keeping it from perfect is the smokey tastes as you drink the beer come off as a bit odd.  Drinkability: Very, very smooth going down but once it's down it is a bit heavy. Still it is a stout and it doesn't quite drink like a meal. Refreshing, which I wouldn't expect from the smokey flavour and all in all quite good.  Final Thoughts: Well, it seems to me instead of coming across as burnt, this beer has ample smoke taste and sensations to it. Now I do like a good cigar every now and then, so I really did appreciate it, but I could see it putting some people off. That being said, it certainly didn't put me off and I would certainly buy it again even though I had to pay ten bucks for it.

This beer smells absolutely beatiful. Lots of fruit in the aroma, which surprised me for a stout, but it almost smelled like wine. Also smells of malt, chocolate and coffee. Palate is full, thick and velvety smooth as a stout should be. The flavor is coffee, malt, chocolate with a fruity tang. Has a bit of a winey alcohol flavor as it warms. It's extremely complex, yet very drinkable.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,mwrecording,4.2,"Got a bunch of these in at the store I work at so I figured I'd try them again since they'd be dirt cheap for me.  Served in a Samuel Smith pint glass at the rec'd 55-60 degree temp.  Appeared black with a caramel colored head that faded away with perfect timing. Smelled exactly like an RIS, the roasted malts, the coffee notes, the chocolate notes...all perfect.  Tasted a bit flat compared to my usual Brooklyn BCS, NightStalker, Old Rasputin but for a 7 percent ABV, not bad. Lots of flavor here...not a watered down version of those beers for sure.  A little carbonation of the mouthfeel, nothing amazing but solid.  I could likely drink 2-3 of these in a night, which for some nights may make it a better option than some of the usual high abv RIS's I'd be drinking.  Stouts are generally my favorite beer. I had this beer a little over a year ago and loved it...it'd be an easy transitional beer to a new stout/'craft' drinker and its somewhat readily available.  Solid. Not amazing, not great. Solid beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,njpink1887,4.05,"first BA review here poured into red wine glass  appearance: deep brown, not entirely black, with an even layer burnt tan head, lots of lace left on the glass, minimal frothy retention  aroma: barleywine style aroma with notes of milk chocolate and even a small hint of toffee which took a half bottle to notice, an overall mild maltiness  mouthfeel: a lot more moderate with the body, tingling burnt/biscuit feeling on the tongue, smooth and no strong alcohol presence (only 7.0 abv), strong level of carbonation  taste: moderate chocolate presence with a noticeable English hop profile that complements the roasted barley, also a hint of coffee  drinkability: this brew is less potent than American versions but still rich with flavors, i enjoyed a 550ml bottle for an evening and would do so again  overall, a great transition from aroma to aftertaste, with a unique, win-like aroma, burnt aftertaste, and a steady, but not overwhelming presence of chocolate. a fine beer indeed.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,SkunkWorks,3.85,"550ml bottle poured into a snifter.  Look: black body with no highlights even when held directly to the light, a thick, mocha colored head forms and retains quite well. There's some lacing but not a whole lot.  Smell: some coffee, roasted malt and hints of dark fruits like currants. Not a whole lot, but its enough to give me something to look forward to.  Taste: follows the nose. Roasted malt creates coffee, hints of dark fruit and hints of dark chocolate and licorice. This has plenty of flavor for a stout but unfortunately its not flavorful enough considering its a RIS.  Feel: not as full bodied as I'd like. Medium towards full, a bit of carbonation, a bit creamy, no chewiness.  Drink: could drink a lot of these given that this is easy drinking and not very complex, but interesting enough to bring you back.  Overall, a nice stout but maybe I am spoiled by American Imperial Stouts, but I find this to be a bit light in flavor for an Imperial. Its certainly worth trying because its from a world renowned brewery, especially if its your first RIS, but don't expect your world to be shaken to the core.

A nice fruitness is detected and a little bit of the alcohol as well.  T: Starts off a little sweet, then some of the dried fruit followed by slight roastiness and then a little bitterness after the swallow. Very well balanced on the flavor end, not overly malty and not overly bitter. Very smooth.  D: One of the more drinkable imperial stouts I have had. Could easliy drink a few pints of it. Nice smooth silky mouthfeel, seems thinner than it should be.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Shrews629,4.13,"Appearance - Very dark brownish/black color with some ruby showing when held to the light. Some ruby highlights at the bottom of the glass also. Very nice cream colored head with more than adequate size and retention. Left plenty of lacing. The head looked creamy and smooth.  Smell - This beer smells of burnt fruit. Very nice. Some roasted raisin and plum along with a very nice ""creamed"" coffee aroma. Some toasted grain or wheat. Darker malts and just a hint of alcohol. All are blended very well.  Taste - The taste is a very well balanced cream and dark, burnt fruit. Touches of alcohol, but it doesn't get in the way. The roasted grain is mixed in near perfectly. This taste, however is somewhat rich and sweet. A small, small amount of detectable bitterness before it heads down the throat.  Mouthfeel - Medium to full mouthfeel. Slippery and smooth. Coats the palate extremely well. Warming and chewy. Outstanding mouthfeel!!! A comfortable alcohol warmth that melds perfectly.  Drinkability - This is a great beer. Would have to be careful with the 7.0% ABV. Easily drinkable on this cold, cold, windy night. It fit perfectly. This would probably just be a Winter beer for me, however.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Smell: Heavy roasted malts on the initial smell. Chocolate cake, fudge, dark chocolate and dark fruits.  Taste: Roasted malt, chocolate, dark spoiled fruits.  Mouthfeel: Body feels a little thin on this, almost like a very light porter.  Drinkability: I'm a little underwhelmed by this beer. I really want to like it, but it ultimately falls flat on it's taste and mouthfeel. I prefer the Oatmeal Stout and Taddy Porter to this hands down.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Daktyls,4.13,"A: Pours a pitch black color, appears pretty viscous during the pour with a minimal tan head that dissipates pretty quickly to a very fine layer of bubbles.  S: Dried dark fruits are most present, with the typical coffee, mocha and dark, bitter chocolate notes. There's also a scent that for lack of better comparison, smells like applewood flavored wood chips for smoking.  T: Dark chocolate up front with the dark fruits following. A bit of molasses mixed in with the malts adds an interesting character in the middle.  M: Medium bodied with an equal amount of carbonation balances well, creamy on the finish.  D: Quite drinkable, definitely glad I purchased the four pack for this one. Very, very good.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Distinct grain smell as well. Very nice. Near perfect balance. The sweetness in the malt and fruityness from this fantastic yeast play against the roast wonderfully. This has great creamy feel to it. not to thick but still velvety and substantial. For an imperial stout this has great drinkability. Alc is low enough so that one could enjoy several bottles on a cold afternoon/night. Never gets too sweet like many American stouts and that's what I really enjoy about this, that is is very...well, stout.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

T - semi malty molasses at first, then the dry 7.0% abv and bitterness catch up. If you like to drink prune, plum, and raisin juice this is your beer lol  M - smooth and creamy, lower carbonation.

113,782,rivalrome,4.38,"Poured and served in a CCB snifter at 50ºF.  Pours a deep chocolate color with no possibility of seeing through it. Forms a 1-finger light mocha head that has the feel of a frothy cappuccino ontop, lacing is solid.  The smell has hints of fruit, whiskey, chocolate, and espresso. Smells phenomenal.  Wow, this tastes exactly how it smells. Initially hits you with dark malted chocolate, fruits, cream, and the alcohol comes towards the end. Not much of an aftertaste after swallowed.  Mouthful is surprisingly medium-bodied; it had the appearance that it could possibly feel chewier.  All-in-all, a phenomenal Imperial Stout. The ABV could be a tad higher, but it might offset the wondrous taste that this already has. If I was on an empty stomach, I could use these as a viable meal. Amazing!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,midwestbrewers,3.5,"A: Very dark, pretty much black with a nice very tan head. Probably 1-1.5 finger.  S: The smell is espresso all the way. Not much else doing here but the roasted coffee/espresso.  T: The taste is exactly like the smell but with the winy bite of alcohol at the back. Very roasted and carbonated, yet very smooth.  Overall I'm still undecided on the Impy's. A little too much alcohol, but still very good and complex flavor patterns. This one's good, but too much for 1 person and not enough to split (only 550ml.) Probably not going to buy again but a very good Imperial. Great beer Samuel Smith Old Brewery!!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Color is nearly pitch black with a slight rouge tone. Head falls into an approachable 1/3"". Virtually no lacing on this glass.  S: Smells of whiskey, caramel and espresso.  T: Syrupy malt. Strength to match. Definitive hop bitter hangs onto the sweetness nicely. Prune, coffee liquer, smoke, and agave nectar?  M: The syrupy-ness of this one is unavoidable and pleasant. Very distinct bite.  D: Probably not a session beer but a darn good Impy.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,FosterJM,4.33,160th review on BA Bottle to Snifter 12oz cap/foil  App- A very dark brown all the way through. Not really black but very close. No highlights in the glass on this one just a nice dark stout. Very suprised by the nice tan head that was a good one finger.  Smell- A bit malty with the dark fruits creeping up on a big inhale. Also got some nice backend booze to it. Dark Chocolate comes into play as well.  Taste- A very well done stout with a unique character. Creamy on the finish with some interesting vanilla sweetness with coffee and chocolate.  Mouth- A very well done feel that is creamy and smooth for a stout like this. It's well balanced and has a very nice carb feel to make it smoother than one would think.  Drink- So far every Samuel Smith I have had has been excellent. Very easy to drink with a great flavor.

Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, brown sugar, dark fruit, dark chocolate, and vanilla. The flave was of sweet malt, brown sugar, dark fruit, dark chocolate, vanilla, and cream. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a pretty nice RIS. The flavors were excellently blended and well balanced. The vanilla aspect was also a pretty nice touch as well. The aroma was pretty good too with lots of nice notes shining through.

113,782,CaptDavyJones,4.38,"Poured pitch black into an authentic Samuel Smith pint glass from a 550 mL bottle, with no freshness date or ABV on the label. Some ruby red hues are visible along the bottom of the glass when held against light. Decent tan head that stays all the way with good carbonation. The aroma is fruity (raisins and dried fruits) with sweet alcohol notes and hints of coffee and dark chocolate. Taste is a beautiful blend of roasted coffee and chocolate, with hints of malt and a nice sweet finish. Medium to full bodied stout. The taste only gets better as the beer warms up. Delightful coating of the palate with every sip. Rich, creamy, silky mouthfeel. Beautiful lacing along the glass. This is one of the best Russian Imperial Stouts in my opinion. The ABV (even though it is lower than most RIS's sold in the US) is masked very well and makes this a VERY drinkable stout. A perfect brew to enjoy on a cold, winter evening. Had some dark chocolate and chocolate covered almonds that paired well with this stout. Definitely one of the better stouts and another solid offering from Samuel Smith's.

113,782,nataku00,3.83,"Poured from a bottle into a snifter glass. Beer is a black with maybe a bit of brown at the surface of the beer when held up to the light. With an aggressive pour, there was maybe a half finger of large bubble light brown/khaki colored head that dissipated immediately tot he surface leaving a few large bubbles. Head dissipating and swirling the glass lightly generated a little bit of lacing on the surface of the glass.  Nose is lactic sweet milk chocolate, not quite what I was expecting. Some roasted malts as well but the milk chocolate is dominant.  Taste is not what I was expecting from an Russian imperial stout. Milk chocolate is the first flavor you get when you take a sip. No bitterness until it hits the back of the tongue and there's just a hint of it. Doesn't linger too long and this stout finishes surprisingly clean on the palate. The lactic acid present leaves just a little bit of sourness on the tongue as well.  Very full creamy mouthfeel, with plenty of small gentle carbonation to really emphasize the chewiness of the beer.

Delicate rings of sticky lacing manifest themselves on the glass as the beer is consumed.  S: Very estery. Prunes, plums, raisins, juicy blackberries, and a slight vinous taste. Hints of espresso, dark chocolate, and maybe a faint whiff of burnt malts underneath.  T: Just as in the nose, powerful fruity esters open. Plums, prunes, juicy berries, and vinous grapes. Molasses, toffee, and dark chocolate follow. Finishes with flavors of deep espresso. Complex.  M: Medium bodied. Slightly syrupy and mouth coating. High level of carbonation.  D: Very high, especially for the style.  Notes: A classic. Taste is delightfully complex. Quality craftsmanship is very evident here. My only criticism is that it isn't quite as big and bold as I would like, but sometimes I feel that my palate is jaded after having all these overblown American versions of the style.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

It had an average sized brown head that quickly settled into a thin collar. Slight lacing with none sticking.  The aroma was dark fruits, dark malt and molasses. Also a touch of booze. Not my favorite smelling RIS. The taste follows the aroma with the dark fruit leading the pack. A little bit of hops to offset the sweet. Mouthfeel was full with good amount of carbonation. Acidic aftertaste.  Overall, a good RIS but far from the top of the list of my favorite RIS's. Just didn't grab me and seemed way too reliant on the dark fruit aroma and taste. Missing the complexity of the better RIS out there. No dating info so maybe I got a bad one but this seems to match other review descriptions. Avail here in TX.

T - roasted malts and barley again flash from the start, turning slightly sweet with some fruity plums, prunes, cherries and chocolate. warming helps bring out a bit of toasted nuts and oats. a bit of booze closes it out alongside maple syrup and toffee.  M - body is a touch light for the style, but still holds up to the robust flavors thanks to an oddly alluring thin yet prickly carbonation. somewhat chalky and chewy to the finish, before being wiped clean by a brief alcohol burn.

Roasted deliciousness all the way. A complex palate, with it starting rather sweet, moving into a dry caramel, and finishing with a flourish of toasted grains. Hops give a nice spike of bitter citrus notes, though more of a header than a real presence.  Medium to medium high carbonation with a superb mouthfeel.

T: Flavor starts off with some old chocolate, mild roast character, and a bit of water. There are some muddled, sweet, dark fruit flavors there such as plums and prunes, as well as that same yeastiness the nose had.

The smell is wonderful -- deep, sweet, fruity smell. Prunes, raisins, and stuff like that. I sat around inhaling the aroma for so long my wife had to remind me to drink it.  Tastes just wonderful. Not overpowering at all, and very well-balanced -- a chocolatey-pruney sweet that dissipates into a nice lingering bitterness. The relatively lower alcohol content ensures that any booziness doesn't detract from the flavors, and it's thick enough to have plenty of body without feeling syrupy.

Nice finger head and it stays with the brew for a long while.  Smells of raisins and chocolate.  The taste is pretty similar to the smell although with much more roasted malt back bone. It leaves a sticky burnt chocolaty taste in your mouth for sometime after taking a sip. Then it even fades into a coffee aftertaste.

I smell plums, black cherries, chocolate, and coffee. The taste begins with the dark fruit flavors and fades into dark chocolate and roasted coffee. The roasted malt lingers just enough to leave me wanting another taste. It has a creamy mouthfeel. This is another solid offering from Sam Smith's. I have really enjoyed everything that I have sampled so far.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,thekoz,3.98,"Pours from a traditional foil topped Samuel Smith's bottle. Stark black with a very minimal tan head.  I get some burnt caramel and roasted malt aromas  Nice mild coffee and molasses flavors. Also a touch of burnt malt flavors. Nice level of carbonation. Fairly dry and well balanced to bitterness. I don't really detect an alcohol flavor.  A little slick on tongue initially with a slightly creamy finish. Could use a tab more body.  Overall good beer, certainly don't have a lot of experience with this style and seems to be from the style guidelines on the lighter end of the style.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,DavoleBomb,4.1,"Poured into a snifter.  4.0 A: Black color. One and a half fingers of reasonably creamy light brown head. Decent retention and moderate lacing.  4.0 S: I just had the oatmeal stout and this seems surprisingly weak by comparison. Good amount of roastiness and molasses with some coffee and a nice nuttiness. Good, but not as good as the oatmeal.  4.0 T: Flavor is more bold than the nose. Roasty, toasty, coffee, and molasses are the leading flavors. Secondarily, I pick up anise and a light chocolate note.  4.0 M: Lighter medium to medium body. Carbonation is a bit higher than I'd like, but still fairly moderate. Smooth and somewhat creamy, though could be creamier. Still, good overall.  4.5 D: This is a lot like the oatmeal stout, though paradoxically, less flavorful. There was some time between finishing the oatmeal and starting this (including some non-spicy food) so I think I'm not too desensitized. Anyway, this is good too and very drinkable. I could go for another one of these as well.

As I'm trying more beers, I'm learning stouts may not be my personal preference, but I imagine this would be very good for the style, which is I why I gave it higher marks than I normally would.  A: Had a nice dark, oil like color with a one finger head that didn't want to stay around too long.  S: Smelled great with chocolate and some mocha.  T: If you like stouts, this is probably a fine example. Not hoppy and plenty of flavor. Alcohol is well hidden, but has a nice balance.  M: Creamy and thick.  D: Fairly easy to take down.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

It poured a black as oil with a half finger head which faded rather quickly into a nice ring which hung around. Had a nice lacing.  The nose was incredible with the dark fruits dominating with a noticeable chocolate caramel aroma availing itself as well.  The taste begins with dark fruit and moved to a mellow malt and finished with a slight bitter. Very balanced tasted.  The mouthfeel is nice, somewhat creamy, really enjoyable.

Smell: Roasted barleys with a slight fragrance of wood  Taste: Roasted barley, not too hoppy, caramel flavor with a little bit of a metallic aftertaste, but overall not bad.  Mouthfeel: Bubbly which for a stout was surprising, smooth going down, very airy.  Drinkability: I could see people getting full off of a stout beer but as for this one, it seems a little on the light side of stouts.

Laces very well.  Smell- Lots of roast. Some bittersweet chocolate. Some dark fruit. Some coffee and chicory.  Taste- Plenty of roast. Not too coffee. Some chicory. Bittersweet chocolate. Some licorice as well. Nice, if a little mellow.  Mouthfeel- Decidedly thin. Not as rich or robust as the beer.  Drinkability- The roast finish knocks it down a notch. It's good, if somewhat uninteresting.  This is a nice Imperial Stout. However, so many beers in this style provide incredible depth of flavor, and really take it to another level.

S: Molasses, licorice and roasted barley. Faint metallic smell. Also some fruit noted as it warms - berries of some sort, I think.  T: Follows the nose somewhat. Some roasted barley up front and a tiny bit of stale cereal grains. Black licorice shows up at the back end of the sip. Hint of chocolate is there as it warms too. Finishes clean. Slight warmth from the ABV is felt in the belly.  M: A little bit thin in heft - call it medium weight, though a little bit light.

113,782,climax,4.32,"As black as the outline of this website, and no brown highlights. The head was creamy and dark. Retention was good as well.  The nose was no surprise, dark and bold. However, it was not overly roasty or dry. Flavors molasses, raisins, vanilla, licorice, and brown sugar all were evident. Very complex aroma, even some ripe raspberry syrup flavors came through. It definitely keeps me smelling.  The taste follows the aroma quite close, with some added acidity. The more roasted tones of dry coffee and chocolate showed themselves, unlike in the nose.  The body is full, as expected, pretty easy to drink though. The carbonation was mild but ample. Ultimately, it was very creamy with a dryish finish. Damn Good, and surprisingly easy to drink.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Cacao, dark fruits, dark roasted coffee and roasty aromas are present, along with a rum-like alcohol nose and sweetness. Pussers Rum comes to mind.  Dark chocolate, coffee and roasted malt flavors are immediately prominent, which segue into notes of dark fruits and a pleasant hop bitterness. Finish is a dry, slightly smoky sweetness with a pleasant presence of alcohol.  Mouthfeel is very smooth and medium in body. Carbonation is perfect.

113,782,Sachsenfreude,4.8,"Another exceptional brew from Samuel Smith, not all that surprised, wouldn't expect anything less.  A beautiful near pitch black beer with an good tan head. The head slowly retreats, leaving thick and creamy lacing, so nice and sticky. I can almost smell a sweet bourbon and some black licorice. Really a toasted malt to almost smokey flavor but then some brown sugar sweetness too. Aftertaste is smooth and bitter in a creamy way, reminds me of quality dark chocolate, not sweet at all. A little bit of alcohol is present when one slurps the beer from the glass, instead of pouring it in the mouth, pretty damn good to say the least. The mouthfeel is loose yet thick and creamy, really complex, one could probably write a poem about it. This is an almost perfect beer and the lower alcohol content makes it more drinkable than of others of this style. Slightly heavy with a roasted malt bitterness in the aftertaste, complex yet strong and makes it less drinkable, but only by a bit. Who wants a beer that is drinkable like water any way though? Certainly not me, I like a meal in a glass.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

A small amount of light shines through and you can catch a few glints of amber around the edges of the glass.  It has a nice malty aroma, not overpowering, but pretty substantial. There is also a slight scent of molasses and even slighter coffee scent.  The first sip I took actually tasted kind of like whiskey with a sharp alcoholic bite. Moving past that the beer has a mild malty flavor with a hint of coffee. There is a hint of dark fruit that lingers around too.  There is a pretty substantial amount of carbonation that kind of messes with the smoothness of the drink.

Poured this brew on a snifter it casts a very dark brown brew with a beige, creamy and rich full crown that has a good retention. Full body with nice carbonation. The aromas are of strong roasted coffe, dark malts and dark cocoa, no alcohol perceived on the nose. The first sip brings the dark malts out followed by the roasted coffe and closing in with a nice touch of dark cocoa that gives it a great finish, with no lingering notes. Nothing overpowering.

Black with little head, there is some excellent lace. The head re-awakens with a small swirl, and it's milk chocolate color is nice.  Smells of chocolate, coffee molasses, mild roasted malt, and some hops. Everything is well-rounded and balanced. It's pretty expressive as well, especially for an authentic RIS and not some American version with tons of ingredients and additives.  The taste is nice - loads of roasted malt and molasses sweetness leave me with the impression that this is on the mark. Soem dark fruit is present, mostly raisin and fig. Mild hops and some coffee combine to produce a slight lingering bitterness and some slight metallic tastes. Still well above average and enjoyable.  The mouthfeel is thinner than the pinnacle of the style, but the light carb makes it feel creamy. There's some lingering roast and slight bitterness in the finish. A fine beer, and it paired very well with the English cheeses and sausage plate that welcomed us to this wonderful tasting.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,bobhits,2.21,"Dark brown and opaque once in the glass. A good 2 finger head that's holding well enough. Leaving impressive lacing (wasn't expecting much). That said this doesn't last. It also leaves a bit of residue when swirled, I love this...sucker. But overall a touch below average for the style but average for a beer.  .Astringent sour smoke and butter scotch? Unlike the oatmeal not description here to judge from. OK so 7.0% and an imperial stout. A bit light for the style.  Sweet flavors and some lets say a smoky flavor with sweet dominance and finishing with some earthy hops. It's just off imo. This beer either needs more hops or more of a bunt flavor. Or it could go the strong malty sweet route (not my ideal). This beer needs to go somewhere and it doesn't. There's a chocolate flavor here. There's some sweetened coffee in a way. All of this is just again poorly done.  This isn't as pillowy and creamy as the regular oatmeal stout but the carbonation is good and the body is thicken enough. Average maybe a touch more than.  I'm not interested in another beer. Unlike my last few beers of the night I won't be pour out the remainder to avoid getting too buzzed (drunk?). That's mostly because this is my last beer of the night. It's not a drinker or sipper. I don't get what these oatmeal stouts that aren't overly strong are going for. I don't want to sip it on a cold night. I don't feel I should grab a cigar to go with. I don't want to drink quickly and I don't see this going with any food I'd eat.

A= This ale poured a deep dark, inky black. When held to a very strong light I saw just a mere glimpse of red/brown clarity near one edge but that was it. The head was a nice tan color and rose a full 3/4"". Retained pretty well, eventually dropping to a solid but thin cap. Left some spotty lace behind.  S= Not overly strong in the aroma, but it was complex nonetheless. I found light roastiness, caramel, toffee, figs, raisins, and soft alcohol in the nose.  T= Similar to the nose. Started off malty and rich with the caramel and toffee leading the way. Then the fruity and estery notes kicked in to bring out flavors of raisins and figs. A light roastiness followed, with a kiss of leafy hops. Finished fairly dry, with an awesome warming alcohol presence that was near perfect.  MF= Actually thinner than I expected...probably just around medium in body. Carbonation was solid without being overdone.  D= A very drinkable Imperial stout, with a lovely alcohol warmth and lots of toffee and fruit sweetness.

113,782,tewaris,3.61,"OG? IBUs? 550 ml bottle with no freshness date poured into a 25 oz snifter.  Appearance 5/5 It's hard to tell the difference between Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout and Imperial Stout based on visual inspection alone, except that the Imperial Stout, perhaps, is a shade darker. Pours clear and dark brown with a big brown head with decent retention and lacing. Going by the looks, an Imperial Stout alright.  Aroma 4/5 Roast; some tartness, but not funky. Instead, the tartness in smell seems to derive from the astringency of roast or the acidity of coffee. There is a dark fruit character that corresponds to a dried sweetness of raisins and dried plums, but not as aromatic/flavorful like dates and figs. No hops. Some sweet alcohol once in a while, that lends a vinous quality when paired with the acidity.  Taste 3/5 Roast and bitterness and the tartness of aroma. This is not the tartness of an infected beer, it's perhaps that charred character that's not getting masked under residual sugars. Also, this is not the only RIS with the described character, but the described character is strongest in this one among all RIS's I've had. The finish is slightly harsh for the style and medium dry, leaning towards dry. The aftertaste has hints of chocolate milk. The richness is missing from this beer in my opinion; yes it's big-ish, yes it's roasty, but that's about it. This is a mediocre RIS at best.  Mouthfeel 3.5/5 Thin and overly carbonated for the style.  Drinkability 4/5 Drinkable? Very much, but what sense does knocking back a few make when one doesn't get the Russian Imperial Stout experience?

Pours the characteristic dark black/brown with a bit of chocolate milk-colored head that had ok retention. Aroma is pretty nice, some fruit, chocolate, roasted malt, hint of booze, maybe even some vanilla in there too. Taste has some nice bitter roasted malt making a big play, but dark fruit poke in and out at times. Dark chocolate also makes an appearance. Again some booze comes in there too. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, but a bit thin as far as I'm concerned. Really enjoyed the drink, a good, available, affordable RIS.  It is a little weird that at 7% the booze in this one is not very well-hidden.

113,782,feelmefoam,4.32,"Sammy's Impy Stout pours a thick, dark black color with a nice finger-point-five of dark tan head that hangs around for a while before leaving. Decent lacing, not the thickest I've seen, but not bad, either. Pretty tasty looking beer.  The aroma, helped by the head, is strong and assertive. Coffee, and sweet, musky dark fruit are prevalent, as well as maybe a bit of brown sugar. Maybe a hint of booziness towards the end? Smells powerful and inviting.  In the mouth this is very similar in character to the nose. Big and bold, with the coffee coming out first, accompanied by some ripe plums and a bit of brown sugar. A nice roastiness comes in afterwards, followed again by a dank, earthy hoppiness. This thing keeps on getting more and more complex as it warms, too. Good beer fa shaw.  The mouthfeel is good, it's a tad above medium with very little carbonation and a nice smoothness that helps the beer go down easily. I have one beef, though: I wish it was just a bit thicker. I like big, thick, syrupy Impy Stouts, and the body on this one falls just a bit short of that. Still, definitely nothing wrong with whats given, and it certainly complements the beer nicely.  Overall, this is a damn good beer that changes in flavor and aroma as it warms, but the complexity remains constant. If you see this around, pick it up, as it's a good example of the style and it's actually pretty drinkable for a RIS at only 7%.

113,782,velosuds,4.18,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a clear pint glass. No freshness dating on bottle or label. Single purchased from John's Market for $2.75.  A-Pours a deep, dark brown almost black hue with a two finger, creamy tan head with good retention and ample lacing.  S-Very fruity, with deep, dark chocolate and toasted malts. Rum and raisins are also prominent.  T-Coffee, chocolate malts, and blackstrap molasses are the most prominent flavors I discern. There is also a pleasant toasted bitterness with a slightly sour twang.  M-Very smooth with medium to full body. Nicely carbonated.  D-Good for a RIS, but not great. I like this and always want more when I finish a single 12 oz. bottle, but it doesn't achieve the rich complexity it aspires to. Not quite on par with other offerings from Samuel Smith.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,dubinsky,4.1,"A - Poured cold into my Brooklyn Brewing snifter and allowed to warm up. Huge foamy, mocha colored head. The beer pours an a complete black with no translucency. Nice lacing left as the head came down. Looks like an RIS to me.  S - Initially it has a very mild aroma of Roasted coffee/espresso. As is sits and warms up it began to warm up and i got vanilla and dark friut. Not a boozy beer, which i love.  T - Great, light malty back bone, with slight hints of coffee. I gave some to my wife to try and she said it tasted like Dr. Pepper, i think she's right. The finish is a bit fruity, i thought i tasted apple, but now that i think of it, it was prunes. Very neutral sweet/bitterness.  M - Moderate to heavy body. Very smooth and creamy.  D - Well balanced flavors, and not too strong. A very drinkable RIS.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,callmemickey,4,"A: Pitch black body with a nice thick khaki head. Quickly receded but left behind some hearty lacing and a nice skim remained on top.  S: Roasted malts, a bit of coffee, plenty of dark chocolate, and some caramel . Nothing earth shattering, but its a classic, balanced aroma profile.  T: Chocolate and roasted malts take center stage. Caramel is present, but not particularly sweet. Some dark fruits creep in, and there is a pleasant bitterness toward the finish.  M: Smooth, creamy with a moderate weight. The body thins out ever so slightly as the beer finishes.  D: A classic for sure. Balanced flavors and a refined profile makes this a pleasant sipper that doesn't try to punish the palate.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

T- Roasted malt, cocoa nibs, slight licorice, metallic finish. The 7% ABV is well hidden.  M- Thin/medium. Medium carbonation.  D- Easy drinking, nothing to complex here taste wise.. but its easy to have a few due to the thin/medium body and smooth flavors.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

But it wasn't the strongest aroma for a beer, actually it was kind of faint.  T: Almost the same as the smell, it was watery, astringent leaving a dry mouth (but thats very normal in the few imperials stouts that I had) lacks complexity and flavor, again it was kind of faint.  Overall it was an unimpressive beer, kind of a watered down version of a Yeti, de Molen or Hercule.

Smell: Dark, roasted malts of course that smell slightly sweet. Also, I pick up on molasses, burned toast and burned dark sugars.  Taste: Similar to the taste. Add a bit of coffee.  Mouthfeel: Medium to almost-heavy body, very creamy with nice carbonation.  Drinkability: At 7.0% ABV, much more drinkable than other RIS. Also, the value on this beer is incredible.

Tilting towards the light shows a coca-cola color around the edges.  S/T/M: Smells are chocolate, molasses, faint alcohol and an odd kind of waxy black licorice. Tastes better than it smells, but still the same theme of flavors. Not off-putting but it does seem strange I'm even tasting the 7% abv when many 9+% Imperials manage to hide it so well. Nice feel, smooth, almost slick. Creamy and well carbonated.  D: Highly drinkable. Lower ABV and lighter than the American incarnations of the style I've mostly been trying, but still having enough... ponderability?. Great for when you want an RIS but its 105f in Texas.

Coffee, bitter chocolate, slightly figgy.  T: Excellent. Well balanced between dark roast flavors and the bittering hops.  M: Medium to full-bodied. Carbonation level keeps me from saying creamy, but it is very smooth.  D: Lighter body than a lot of other RIS and lower ABV make this easy to drink.

T: Again, espresso, dark fruits, and a hint of soy sauce at the back of the tongue. Floral and grassy hops are present, along with dark chocolate. Light roasty/toasty notes.  M: Full bodied with plentiful, but not excessive carbonation. A tad thinner than most RISs, but with the low abv, this is not a surprise.  D: I love ISs, but hate feeling wasted after half a bomber.

113,782,SleepyMonk,4.15,"Chilled bottle poured into a sniffer. This beer has been provided courtesy of Platinum Liquor in Bellevue Hill Sydney.  This is the darkest beer I have ever encountered and as a person who prefers and hunts down dark beers I hope that explains how striking the density of this stout is  Pouring generates a massive titanic dark tan in color creamy texture head of about 3 fingers. It bonds tightly and then dries off with patchy lace on the glass.  Aromatically this is stout is dominated by dark fruits such as prunes with a blend of gummy molasses and rich dark chocolate.  In the mouth and across the tongue this is a dominant offering. Coffee like impact with a sweet dessert like finish. Raw unprocessed natural chocolate mixed with an almost perfect balance of praline. There are elements of roasted nuts, dried cured pork no doubt this is due to a very smoke box type finish that continues to kick well after the taste has been swallowed, interestingly I even get the profile of dried seaweed; once again perhaps this is due to smokey characteristics.  To call this full bodies is almost an understatement. Well balanced level of carbonated is a compliment and signs of a beer that is well crafted.  Thanks again to Platinum Liquor Sydney.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

The head settled to a thin layer clinging to the edges of the glass, where it left some great lacing on the sides.  The aroma has a good amount of chocolate to it with a bit of caramel and molassas coming through. It's pretty low on the roasty, coffee and bitter flavors a lot of the American versions are full of. Pretty decent and smooth aroma overall though.  The taste shows a lot of milk chocolate to it at first. I'm also getting a fruity, apple like flavor to it that I don't usually find in an imperial stout. Some roasty and bitter flavors come through towards the finish along with some more chocolate. Pretty flavorful and tasty beer and also different then others of the style to keep things interesting.  The mouthfeel is average thickness for the style but it has a very nice creaminess to it. Drinkability is very good, it's a very well made and classic beer. It had a lot of interesting and different flavors from a lot of the Imperial Stouts that I've had, and thankfully they were also pretty good flavors.

There's a slight off sour note in there too. The flavor has gentle notes of roast and coffee with a little more milk chocolate than in the aroma. Over all the flavor has a bit of metallic dullness though.

It is a nice, strong smell which balances between sweet and roasted malt notes.  Taste is sweet fruit (berries and apples) flavor up front and a roast coffee following. The heat of the alcohol warms throughout. The finishes has a bit of sour apple flavor.  A flavorful, strong stout which would make for a great dessert beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,luisfrancisco,4.33,"Poured this into an imperial pint glass.  A = Very dark colour. No light goes through. Pours rather well, a little viscous. Oily appearance. Forms a half inch whitesh/brownish head. Dissipates quickly and only a tiny film of whiter carbonation remains at the top with very decent lacing.  S = Coffee and chocolate, maybe a little molasses in the background, although smell is not as strong as the taste.  T = Superior flavors. Coffee, caramel and molasses. Bitter dry finish. Opens up as it warms.  M = A little viscous, but rather palatable. Somewhat bitter. Very slight carbonation. Not as thick as other Imperial Stouts but very enjoyable. Very silky on the palate and the slight carbonation feels perhaps like a butterfly farted inside the beer (I mean this in a good way).  D = Excellent. This is an extraordinary beer. Maybe not as strong as other examples of the style. Particularly milder than american interpretations, but still a damn good beer. Balance is great and it is one fine sippin' beer. At 7%ABV it is not one of the strongest out there for the style, so very drinkable.

Pours just about black with a thick foamy tan head that lasts. Excellent lacing.  Aroma is fairly standard for the style. Roast, chocolate, caramel, molasses, and booze (even though it's only 7%) on the aroma. Pretty standard.  Flavor is similar, a little earthy with milk chocolate. Average sweetness. Not great intensity.  Amazing mouthfeel - smooth as silk with medium-full body and seamless carbonation.

This fits into the latter category.  A- Super frothy sand colored head. It sticks around much longer than in many RIS, but it to, soon fades. A big thick, bubbly collar remains. The beer is obviously quite black and devious looking. Its not as crazy thick and viscous as many of the amped up American versions are.  S- Quite vinous. At first Im getting a lot of grape juice and port like character. Some chocolate, lots of licorice, molasses and grains with a slight roast to them.  T- Lots more vinous red wine and grape juice. Its pretty sweet. Roast is moderate and it helps bring a bitterness that tried to balance out the berry like flavors.  M- Very dry, full bodied but nothing insane.

Coffee, caramel, a hint of chocolate, earthy with a hint of fruit, a touch of biscuit.  Taste is a little on the thin side, says I. Some nice mellow roast, black-strap molasses, caramel, chocolate, toffee and a strong dark fruit element which gives almost a tart/tangy quality, figs, plums, etc...

Very dark brown in color - as expected with a Stout, I can't see through it. There's a large creamy head that lasts about three minutes before starting to give way. It's quite impressive in appearance.  I can smell chocolate, roasted malt, cream, a little smoke, and what might be black pepper - that's a lot to keep your nose involved.  The taste confirms - I first notice the creaminess, then the chocolate, the well-done roasted malt, and the hops, which produced a nice lemony flavor. I didn't think I liked Stouts, but I'm starting to re-evaluate that position.  Mouthfeel is good - it's medium-bodied, with good carbonation and not a lot of aftertaste.  I wouldn't drink a whole bunch of these in a night personally, but that's just because I'm a Witbier man.

113,782,damndirtyape,4.33,"Single bottle poured into a nonic glass. No date on bottle - just a laser marked batch code (SG13I1).  Appearance: Very dark brown/black that lets no light through except at the edges where it's just barely a cola-brown color. Poured a thick head that died down to a 1/8"" persistent dense tan foam across the top with some chunks of lacing here and there.  Smell: Some chocolate along with a burnt sugar (caramel / roasted malt) smell. This smell is consistent regardless of the beer temperature.  Taste: I think I have to describe the taste of this beer like a dark chocolate + caramel candy bar. The dark chocolate is has just enough of a bittersweet flavor that you know you're drinking a beer and not eating a candy bar, but the sweetness of this beer is noticeable. It's a very tasty beer - it's a dessert in itself.  Mouthfeel: Creamy with moderate carbonation. Clings a tad to the teeth, but not excessively.  Drinkability: This has to be the lowest ABV RIS beer I've ever had, but after awhile I can note the alcohol. Still - even though this is a one beer a night for me, it's a fantastic beer. Good with a meal (balsamic chicken and rice pilaf), good for sipping and savoring afterwards, and still appealing that now I want dessert.

Earthy on the palate, with hints of chocolate and bitter roast balanced by sweet maple and molasses flavors. The mouthfeel has a certain minerality to it and it's full in texture.

The taste is of strong coffee and molasses and a bit of fig.  The mouthfeel is watery and thin.  The drinkability is not bad do to the lower abv and not overpowering flavor.

113,782,GRPunk,4.15,"550 ml bottle poured into a nonic pint. Big thanks to my brother-in-law for the going away present.  A- A moderate pour left a 2-finger, dense, brown-tan head that maintained nicely at a foamy film throughout. The body was near jet, with burgundy hues at the edges. Nice sticky rings and webs were left on the glass as I drank.  S- It's quite bold. I was met with an initial fruity sweetness that developed into a definite raisin presence. Dark chocolate was present at colder temps. There was a pleasant alcohol aroma that was hard to place but came off as something on the hard liquor that's outta' my league (sherry perhaps?). A buttery characteristic came out with some woody/tobacco/earthy notes as it warmed.  T- Sweet raisin up front. Sweet alcohol came off of as something like a buttery rum. It had a little woody flavor. The finish was a little peppery with a residual sweetness.  M- Warming alcohol provides just a bit of a bite. A full body with light-medium carbonation makes for a creamy feel and adds to the viscus quality.  D- I'd definitely drink it again. Really good flavor makes me want to check this out again come cooler weather. It drinks a little bigger than the 7% ABV would suggest. The alcoholic qualities definitely add to the enjoyment rather than detracting from it.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Dark brown color, closer to mahogany than black, clear liquid, not going for the easy ""totally opaque"" out. Big time banana, bubblegum in the nose, sweet without needing much from the caramel, café au lait, raisin bread, bread pudding or plum to cherry fruit scents, very low on the roast, quite unusual and unexpected, satisfying at face value. Full-bodied, fairly smooth and fluid without too much weight. Much more roast here in the coffee, dark chocolate, this along with a mineral water aspect gives it cut and definition. Still, no lack of coconut, banana, toffee to join the plum, apricot, cherry flavors. The carbonation not light, more subtle, if no less effective.

This is only intensified as the coffee-black beer pours, leaving a dark tan head. In the goblet the lesser odour of yeast, and something faintly peppery peeks through. You definitely taste the peppery notes of the beer, a complex flavour almost like the offspring of coffee and banana. There are definitely bitter chocolates mixed into this mix. The carbonation is moderate, giving the beer a bit of a sparkling quality in the mouth. It's very reminiscent of Obsidian Stout by Deschutes, in a way, but with a sweet middle.

Italian dark roast coffee highlights the aroma. Bitter and lightly charred. A dark, syrupy Italian chocolate wafts about as well.  The flavor is not what I'm used to from the American RIS'. Some mild bitter roast flavors, but a good bit of licorice that lingers throughout. As it warms, a thin molasses spreads out on the tongue and some syrupy coffee and vinous notes toward the end.  This drinks with a healthy amount of carbonation and finishes softly warm and dry.  Delightfully complex but restrained. An occasional night cap.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,BranfordBound,4.23,"550 mL bottle purchased at Coastal Wine and Spirits in Branford, CT.  This is the darkest beer I've had yet, even while pouring its practically black, never mind while sitting in the glass. There is a nice 1-2 finger light brown head that forms which settles to a covering leaving barely any lacing. Normal, maybe a little less than expected.  The smell is intense, there is a lot of dark fruits, very alcoholic, like a brandy. There is definitely a roasted and chocolate in the back, not much coffee.  The taste is very similar to the nose, there is a warm sensation from the alcohol while going down, and the dark fruits play the main role. In the back there is the typical stout flavors of roastiness and chocolate.  Whew, this is heavy stuff, albeit very smooth. Very heavily bodied.  This beer masks the alcohol well, which is to be expected seeing as it isn't too high compared to other RIS's. Still a sipper, though, drank 2/3's of the bottle and wouldn't want anymore, better for winter time, too.  All in all, not bad, I'll try a few other brands so I can choose my favorite to age, this one was a little too heavy on the dark fruits, but pretty darn good for not being aged.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,bigfnjoe,4.26,"Poured from a 550 mL bottle into a pint glass.  A- pours jet black with a two finger light brown head. I like that the head isn't as dark as I've seen in other RISes...looks nice. No lacing, which is unfortunate  S- getting a lot of varying scents here...faint aroma of chocolate, with very slight hints of coffee, dark fruits, and as someone else mentioned, I'm actually getting some cookie dough. Very complex...and totally awesome  T- very, very mild...which stuns me based on the style. But you know what...its good. Not an alcohol bomb. I'm mostly getting dark fruits...which I'm not the biggest fan of, but there is a hint of some sweeter chocolate in the back of my throat as well. Nice.  M- feel is great. Creamy. Smooth.  D- I'm only going to give this a 4 here, because while there isn't any real booziness to it...the fruitiness puts me off.

113,782,DerekP,4.08,"Picked up a 550 ml bottle of this stuff at Giant Eagle (just started selling beer). That's roughly 1.5 beers at the 12 oz portion, which cost me $3.99. A legendary brewery's offering from England found its way into a supermarket in Pennsylvania. Translation: I'm not complaining.  The beer is black, unsurprisingly. An outstanding beige head with beautiful, fluffy lacing hangs out in my nonic pint glass.  Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout smells of alcohol, tart fruit (indistinguishable, but I know it's present) with biscuity notes; even cookie dough.  The taste/mouthfeel is soft & delicate, but dark & toasty. One of the attributes that I find so incredible about stouts is their ability to carry a high number of IBU's (International Bittering Units) without the senses realizing it. I'm guessing there are 70-80 IBU's in this brew, but the dark quality of the style hides the quantity, rendering it at about half that estimate to ones sense of taste.  The beer is very buttery (diacetyl), but the more negative aspect of that byproduct doesn't seem to make it to the front. I have no qualms with its position in the beer. As far as I'm concerned, it knows where it stands, and doesn't get in the way like it tends to in certain English Pale Ales.  This one I certainly recommend. Sooner or later I'll get to the Nut Brown Ale...",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Graham5161986,4.37,"Poured from it's classically beautiful bottle, this Imperial Stout has an absolutely opaque, jet-black colour with a creamy dark tan head made up of tiny little bubbles that sticks around quite well and leave some very nice thick lacing on my snifter.  The aroma is enchanting with massive notes of vanilla, roasted coffee-like malts and loads of dark fruits like plums and raisins in there (almost the way a fine port smells). I get a bit of Belgian-esque candied sugar in the background as well. Hints of milky, bitter-sweet chocolate round off the nose of this already impressive brew.  The flavour is so rich and creamy with loads of roasted malt and Dark fruit flavours intermingling with strong notes of coffee and touches here and there of creamy chocolate, bread, honey, herbs and spice. The linger features some light fruit and a hoppy bitterness that is matched with coffee and dark chocolate notes that last and last . . . The alcohol makes its presence felt, but is far from overpowering. Instead, it gives a nice warmth to the beer as well. Speaking of warmth, I am starting to get some subtle but really nice orange citrus notes as I go along here that make this brew feel like your eating a ""Terry's"" chocolate orange.  The mouthfeel of this brew is thick, very creamy and quite chewy with just the right level of carbonation to allow the creaminess of the malts to come through yet giving way to a crisp spiciness on the finish that leaves a surprisingly clean mouhtfeel given the viscosity of this brew.  This is definitely a one-per-evening, sipping type of brew. It's meant to be savoured slowly (preferably fireside with a Housecoat and cigar!) and, thus, can hardly be called sessionable at all. Still, it's such a pleasure to explore this beer with every sip becoming easier and easier. This is the type of beer that could easily creep up on you.  Another classic from the old Tadcaster Brewery.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,DrDemento456,4.69,I have had this before and loved it so when I found the 550ml big bottle at the Monroeville Giant Eagle for a mere 4 bucks it was the first beer in my hand.  A - For me it was pretty much black. I could only see slight clearness when pouring and I can see bubbles from the carbonation. Carbonation was great and gave way to fluffy head with lacing S - Big strong roasted malt with coffee and chocolate malts along the sent. Actually smells sort of bourbon but that might be from the strong malts. T - Very tame yet rush of strong coffee followed by vanilla then mild oak followed by a bitter chocolate finish. Very complex and tasty. M - Full bodied like a big beer with a low ABV tag and no loss of flavor. A great succession able beer in my book. D - Overall I don't know why I can't find this in more places but would totally drive to Monroeville for another bottle and maybe one of their fruit beers I have been meaning to try.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Also some definite chocolate/brownie smell. A little milky with maybe some coffee and wood.  Taste: Roasty with some noticeable hops. Some coffee and unsweetened chocolate flavors as well as some bitter dark malts. A little milky sweetness as well. Maybe a bit of faint smoke. A little warming alcohol in the stomach.

Aroma is subdued despite the good carbonation. The taste is slightly sour, perhaps a sour mash? A little roast, a little chocolate, no boozy bite, fairly dry. Body is thin, more like a porter than a stout, let alone an imperial stout.  I'm torn. I like this beer, but frankly it isn't an imperial stout.

T- A little bit sour plums up front over a backbone of the same flavors from the nose. Opens up a lot as it warms up, with the different flavor characters differentiating themselves.

113,782,jpittman80,4.4,"This is proof that more is not always better. In comparison to other imperial stouts, especially the ones from the US, this is less. Less aroma, less flavor, less body, less alcohol. That being said, this is quite an enjoyable experience and is extremely well balanced. Also, I have to admit that I have a little soft spot for this one, as it was my gateway to other imperial stouts.  It pours a stark black with a finger of tan head that lasts to the end. When held to the light, it shows touches of deep red. You get a big raisin and other dark fruit aroma, with bananas, chocolate and a hint of both coffee and alcohol. The flavor follows suit, with a nice rounded raisin flavor. The chocolate is more pronounced here, as is the strong roast malt character. The alcohol is actually less prevalent in the flavor than the aroma. It is very deftly balanced between sweet and roasty bitterness, but to the devoted strong stout fan, it comes off as relatively subtle. A medium body and a nice soft carbonation (in conjucntion with the relatively low ABV) make this a very smooth, satisfying brew.  So, when you want something bolder than your average brew, but aren't in the mood for the overly aggressive or sweet malty mess of most big stouts, I'd say give this classic a shout.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Ruby amber highlights when held to the light.  S-Semi sweet roasted chicory, bakers chocolate, coffee, licorice and molasses.  T-A creamy carryover from the nose with a well balanced hop finish that brings a bit of anise to the aftertaste. There are many big stouts that taste better than this, but I can't think of any that taste this good at 7%. This packs a huge flavor and complexity for a relatively low ABV, and I daresay nearly as much enjoyment as some of the more powereful examples of this style. I love a beer that lets me drink more of it. Well done.  M-Medium plus, nice and creamy...well balanced carbonation.  D-An extremely drinkable stout that is readily available. I normally like my stouts strong, powereful, dark and thick, but this is such a satisfying brew at a lower octane.

A measured hop bitterness, with some herbal/spicy flavor.  M: Medium-full body. Carbonation is modest, and the mouthfeel is extremely smooth and creamy - wonderful. Close to ideal in terms of mouthfeel.  D: I thought this might be a delicately-flavored imperial stout considering the 7% abv, but this is very refined and extremely flavorful.

Fairly standard stout aroma with a nice balance of roasted, sweet, and tart aromas.  T - Starts fairly fruity with a good amount of raisin, date, and a faint touch of dark berry.

I added an ounce or so as it settled and actually grew the head another half inch. Now it sits over 2 1/2"" with no signs of diminishing. Due to its utter opaqueness, no visible carbonation can be detected. Perfect rings of tan lace all the way down.  A few swirls evokes fresh Raisinettes (milk chocolate covered raisins). Seriously, just like a huge handful of mashed-up Raisinettes. A little malted milk and faint creamed coffee.  A perfect balance of the aforementioned scents translate perfectly into the taste category. There's a little char which melds well with the dark fruit flavors. The roasted dark malts are more amplified as the beer warms, giving it its first dimension of heartiness I've detected so far.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a low level of carbonation, which is common for a British made stout. It's oily and slick and does not build-up on your tongue. There's a little chalkiness on the long, fruity and roasty finish.  Drinkability is awesome. Not at all harsh and a very 'gliding' swallow.  Overall a finely tuned and masterfully balanced R.I.S. In a time where this style is all over the place, this stout is in perfect pitch. Very restrained and soft-spoken, but has a lot to say if you listen closely.

There's also a slight cola taste, which is really just caramel that seems to pick up towards the end. Over all the texture on this is very thick and authentic feeling.

Mouthfeel: Medium carbonation. Creamy feel which ends with a dry bitter finish.  Drinkability: Highly drinkable IMO. An unexpected experience at 7.0%. I'm impressed. I've been drinking this for quite some time but never reviewed it until now. Certainly a more sessional beer as far as Imperial Stouts go. Pretty smooth.

113,782,JohnnyP3,4.48,"Poured from a 355ml bottle with a best before date on the shoulder of November 2010. Neck wrapped with gold foil and a label identical to that of the caption picture. A very informative label graces the opposite side of the main label with a plethora of descriptions of the beer and serving suggestions. The beer landed in a standard pint glass.  A: Predominantly black, with some ruby red hues to it. Topped by a nice creamy head that pours with a roughly 2-finger width. Head settles to a nice layer and clings to the sides of the glass. Great lace patterns down the sides as I drink.  S: Dark chocolate and cherries stand out to me. Some roasted coffee bean smell as well. Milky and malty!  T: Delicious and rich! Chocolate malts, coffee, some background hints of fruits, but not overwhelming. Dark fruits are pleasantly subdued. This RIS is a great example of the old saying that sometimes less is more. Delivers a decadent dark brew without some of the over-the-top antics of its much younger brethren. A little bit of the toasted/burnt malt character is present as well. Molasses and rum currents as well. Quite complex for a lower alc/vol RIS.  M: Wonderful creamy texture with nice complementary level of carbonation. Silky smooth, to coin a taxed phrase.  D: My favorite RIS as of this date. Very smooth and easy going RIS that warms the body and soul on a winter eve and does not incapacitate you with an alcoholic gut punch.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,bsp77,4.35,"Serving glass: Poured from bottle into Snifter.  Appearance: Very dark, rich brown with thin tan head that lasts for awhile.  Smell: Sweet molasses, licorice, dark fruit, chocolate and coffee.  Taste: Molasses and roasted barley are very prominent, with notes of chocolate, coffee and dark fruit. Rich and malty, with much less hops than most American made Imperial Stouts.  Feel: Thick, creamy and smooth body with low carbonation.  Drinkability: Overall, a much milder RIS than the American-made ones I am used to. However, it is very easy drinking (at least by RIS standards) and it has a nice full and smooth body.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,hophead247,4.5,"F'ing OUTSTANDING BEER!!!..Beautiful black stout with an incredible tan head and nice lacing. Nose of sweet malt, light alcohol, & cocoa. Taste of sweet malt, cocoa, bitter espresso, with a bitter hop finish to counter the sweetness. Mouth feel is a bit thin for an imperial stout; not surprising, since at 7% ABV this is more a session stout than an imperial, but I was damn impressed. Very nicely done from a world class brewery.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,heissebier,4.15,"This has been sitting in my fridge since November, saved for a special day. It turns out there is nothing particurally special about today (except perhaps the beer I'm about to drink), I just couldn't wait any longer.  Appearance- Pours jet black with a nice mocha colored head. Coats the side of the glass beautifully with lacing.  Smell- A very interesting smell, unique to this beer. Sweet caramel notes blended with some coffee and choclate flavors. There is also a rum or bourbon like aroma mixed in there. Gives the beer a certain old-school badass character.  Taste- Maintains that distinct character, malty with chocolate and caramel flavors dominating. Some dark fruits present. Slightly bitter finish.  Mouthfeel- Thick and smooth, with just a touch of carbonation. A roasty flavor tends to linger in your mouth. Also a very warming brew.  Drinkability- Fantastic considering the darkness and complexity of this brew. Perhaps it can get overwhelming after a few glasses.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

It has a big 1.5 inch head that is tan and very dense. the head is nice and sticky with some good lacing.  S - Some nice caramel sweetness along with chocolate, vanilla bean and believe it or not some banana bread. Mild alcoholic warming esters are also present. Some mild mocha hints as well.  T - Some nice smooth and creamy chocolate hints as well as some vanilla. Mellow roasted character that is subdued by the alcoholic sweetness. The mocha hints are very delicious and there is definitely some banana bread hints in there. Very nice.  M - Might be a little watered down for a RIS but its still very delicious and refreshing.  D - Might be a little on the low side with the complexity and teh ABV.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Contagion,4.33,"The first thing that is noticeable when smelling this beer is a strong dark coffee malt scent and molasses. There is a hint of chocolate malts that rounds out the scent. Due to the 7% ABV you can also notice a touch of alcohol in the scent. The taste starts off with a rich coffee and chocolate malt, followed by molasses and dark fruit like raisins, dates or prunes. There is a bitter floral hop taste that lingers into the aftertaste.  This is a medium bodied beer that has a good creamy coating in the mouth. The carbonation level is mild like one would expect of a stout.  This is a very easy beer to drink. It's actually a beer I would love to see my local English Pub put on tap. I could see myself ordering one of these after a rough day at work. The 7% Alcohol By Volume is barely noticeable in the taste, you almost have to be looking for it to find it.

Dark brownish gold head that once settled it was just a film. No Lacing and no real showing of carbonation.  S-- Bitter chocolate and a lot of roasted malt. Does have a sweet quality to the beer. Very big flavor for this beer.  T-- Baking Chocolate, big malt, bitter coffee or espresso taste. Feels like a bitter and sweet chocolate cake.  M-- Flavor does not last that long in the mouth, yet what is there is excellent and packs a punch. Only real negative is the mouthfeel and that is still very good.  D-- A 7% RIS??? Oh yeah, quite good and worth drinking. Biggest thing is how drinkable it is. Can be done all year. Not like other RIS' that really are fall/ winter beers due to the overcomplexity and high ABV %. This makes up for the smaller ABV by the flavor. Rich and full, yet drinkable. A real versatile beer. Can be sessionable and can be sipped and savored.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,kegger22,4.3,"Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout was a very dark brown color with a half-inch light brown head that faded to a collar.  The aroma was a rich chocolate malt smell that dominated the brew.  The taste too, was chocolate roasted malt, nice and sweet, but not over sweetened.  The mouth feel was medium to full bodied, oily and reasonably carbonated.  Drinkability was very good, pairing an excellent flavor to a sane ABV.  I had good feelings about Samuel Smith's beers before, but the imperial stout has raised them to a higher level IMO.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

S - Soft smell, creamy and rich. Hints of chocolate and malts with a nice cherry alcohol undertone.  T - Chocolate and roasted nuts. Creamy malts.  M - Smooth and silky. Goes down easy. Leaves my mouth feeling fresh and cool.  D - Very drinkable RIS. The ABV isn't too crazy either which makes this a great one to throw back.

Smell, too much alcohol in the nose, especially for only 7%. Taste, nice, coffee, choco licorice. Mouthfeel, gets rid of the alcohol smell blast, some toffee or something along for the ride.

On close inspection, the beer is actually a clear, deep amber brown.  Smell: Sweet, figgy, raisony aroma.  Taste: Smooth, round and satisfying. Fruit and brown sugar flavors primarily, with some chocolate. Balanced well with subtle nutty and smoky notes.  Mouthfeel: Thick and velvety. Slightly syrupy. No astringence.

Very faint, deep ruby highlights and substantial lacing.  Smell is that kind of sour-ish chocolate, like Hershey's milk chocolate, dark fruit (raisins & prunes, especially), & a spiciness like black licorice.  Starts with dark fruits & some acidity, then moves into a dark chocolate bitterness, introduces a sharpness from booze, turns milky sweet, & ends with a pleasant roasty flavor.  Full mouthfeel, foamy carbonation, a little sharp from alcohol. I like it -- not knocking my socks off, but a really nicely done representation &, I'm assuming, one of the most authentic examples of the style around.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,ChanChan,4.45,"550 ml bottle, poured into a Standard English pub glass. A: Obviously as dark as an Imperial Stout should be. Nevertheless, a hue of burgundy can be detected when held up to the light. The head is thick and slightly creamy with good lacing. S: Roasted coffee, a bit of handmade chocolate and some raisins. For some reason I also get a bit of clove every now and then. T: Tastes reminds me of a Guinness Extra Stout but much smoother and complex. A very enjoyable drink. The finish alone makes me want to crack another one open. Well... if I had another one. M: Just the right thickness which results in coating the mouth beautifully! This might be my favorite aspect of this beer; it feels as thick as tomato juice. D: The aromas given off by this beer are a lot more complex than what I can describe. The ABV seems a little low for an IMPERIAL stout but this may make it even more enjoyable. I have never had their oatmeal stout because I do not generally enjoy low ABV drinks but if the taste is similar than I would most definitely want to try that as well, this one is fantastic!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,BeerMasterD,4.18,"335 ml bottle. I really enjoy the look of this bottle, strong looking, the label is fitting and interesting, gold foil lets you know, this is not just any beer. Poured an almost perfect black the light could not pierce, into a sturdy mug. A finger thick dark tan head appeared atop, reminds me of a root-beer float, receeding slowly into the depths of this dark liquid, with little broken lace down the glass. The aroma i inhale is strong roast malt, coffee, and az it warms slightly, raisin. I raise the glass to lips in anticipation, and down the hatch.. cold coffee, bitter chocolate throughout, hops, dark fruit-prune/raisin. Medium-full body almost oily, feels lighter than its appearance might have you believe, with small/close, almost 'biting' bubbles on the tongue. Not a 'beginner' stout if there is such a thing, however very drinkable and enjoyable. Very tasty, a slight warmth is felt gradually with this 7% brew. If fate will have it i will drink this again, i recommend it to those looking for a quality stout, its a real treat. I feel very good/relaxed rite now, but dont want another glass, i am content, i am pleased. Cheers!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,bbkd3b,3.76,"Poured into a pint glass.  A: Really dark looking like an imperial stout should be. Holding it up to a lighted background doesn't make it look any lighter either. Has a good, 1.5-finger tan head with decent retention and the lacing sticks really well.  S: Concentrated chocolate hits the nostrils hard. Along with it are subtler scents of dark fruits and licorice. Pleasant.  T: Good tasting brew! The licorice is much more noticeable on the tongue than when I smelled it. It has more complexity as a result because it is balanced really well. The chocolate mixes really well with dark fruits and a slight bitterness (coffee?) finishes it off.  M: Creamy and a little thick, with perfect carbonation. No complaints here.  D: Good beer to drink, but strangely, I wasn't too interested in another round. I'd certainly buy it again, but I think the thickness put me off a little. At $4 for a 550mL bottle, I'm not complaining!  Overall/notes: Excellent beer, really. I drank this on a quiet night, and it was really relaxing, in a strange way. I still haven't had many imperial stouts, but I really am enjoying them. It also gave me an intense craving for chocolate.

There's a bit of a toasty malt in the background and a hint of coffee.  Chocolate, coffee, and dark sour fruit all come in waves topped off by the alcohol flavor in the background.  Creamy smooth with a good, but not overpowering amount of carbonation.  I'm not quite sure how to feel about this one. It feels just a bit away from being fantastic, but something about the sweet and sour aspect puts me off just a tad. Its not a deal breaker, but it just sits a bit uneasy. Sam Smith's always has amazing body and smoothness to their beer though, and this is a fine example of that.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

I've had this bottle tucked away in the ""cellar"" for about 2 years and just decided to give it a try.  A: Wonderfully creamy and almost jet black with a one finger mocha colored head with nice retention and some patchy lacing.  S: Very unique and unmistakably Samuel Smith. A slightly sweet chocolate and dark fruit concoction with hints of rum, smoke, raisins, mocha, cinnamon bread, licorice, and coffee. As with many of their offerings, this aroma is subtle yet complex.  T: Truly a wonderfully unique flavor profile with chocolate and raisin highlighting first. Layers of cinnamon raisin bread, licorice, coffee, smoke, and rum are present as well. Very smooth and extremely complex.  M: Medium-bodied with low carbonation with a great degree of creaminess which adds considerable fullness to this Imperial Stouts. Quite silky and delicate, yet substantial and hearty at the same time.  D: I have always found this to be one of the most drinkable Imperial Stouts and this bottle confirmed that. The 7% abv. is is a non-factor as it is modest and completely hidden.  Overall this for me was my first Imperial Stout and it has not lost any of its luster of mystique throughout the years.

113,782,mempath,4.85,"continuing my obsession with Smith offerings since the local Total Wine has such a great selection. and they don't break the bank.  pours not a color, but the total absence of light. black is static. this is shimmering opaqueness that cannot be gotten through by sight. the dark brown head just builds high as the tower of babylon that settles about midway into the 18th century...clings and clings and laces and then settles 10 minutes later into a thick veneer with still massive lacing hanging on. majestic as it's namesake!  yep, sweetness and smoke, dried fruit, mincemeat, rumcake, coffee, sweetened dark chocolate, so rich, double dutch etc. oh and there's the malt. and some raisin bread. give it another whirl and this rich lusciousness comes out. what i imagine the willy wonka factory smells like sitting beside the chocolate river...  this is simply divine stuff. you see the writing on the wall. 1200+ reviews and it's got an overall A-...go figure. all this strength and verve of darkness and chocolate and smoke and toastiness and bravado and still it's smooth as silk. yes, the silk glove/iron fist metaphor means alot here. GREAT cold, but let it warm up a bit and try not to take big gulps every time...it will reveal secrets. best bet, grab the larger pint+ size bottle if you can. usually about $3.79 or so. no catching some slight hop-edged bitterness. nice.  mouthfeel is nearly perfect. carbonation is more in the look of it than in the sip. usually, it carries over to being heavier seeming, but not here. not too thick and certainly not too thin.  it's scary how drinkable this is. i could session this easily. now, i didn't say with ease. i probably wouldn't survive the evening should i attempt it...  so very highly recommended. i recommend just about anything from this brewery. my oh my i am impressed.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

An earthy stout where, again, the roasted malt flavor prevails.  M: Relatively smooth while feeling a little thick. There is a very slight looming bitterness.  D: Definetly a sipper. Too strong to be an everyday stout. But flavorful enough to want to drink again.  Overall it's a decent and distinctive stout.

It's medium-to-full-bodied, but doesn't seem filling.  Drinkability: So easy to drink for an imperial stout.  Notes: At 7%, labeling this an imperial stout is a slightly misleading, but that's of little consequence, since it's so good.

Powerful notes of roasted barley in the nose. Maybe the most roasted barley I have seen in a beer since the Dogfish head WWS. This is also very fruity for the style. Sweet molasses to back up the barley presence, plum and prunes in the aroma as well. The taste is complex to say the least, molasses, birch syrup, jammy plums and blackberry preserves, nice rich toffee notes, fig, dark sour cherries and a raisin wine richness. Like a complex, fine port wine-a true treat, I'm so happy it can be found regularly in my parts. Mouthfeel is heavy, creamy and silky on the tongue.

Not quite translucent. Has a big tan foamy head that lasts for the entire glass and leaves lots of lacing.  Nice malt dominant flavor. Some bittering hops but that's it. Gets bittering from the roast malt too. Lots of brown sugar and molassis flavor and a ton of fruity yeast character. Yum.  Full bodied with a creamy carbonation level.

Taste: lightly roasted, hops are mostly earthy and a tad leafy, diacetyl, toffee. A mineral-ly, hard water thing going on, but fairly smooth and active carbonation. There's a chance that this is closer to the original intent of the style than the US craft interpretation, but I prefer the latter by a wide margin.

Leaves lacing  S: caramel, chocolate syrup, hazelnut, toffee, this has a much sweeter smell than other RISs. I'm not getting that deep dark roasted flavor that I am used to, but the nice sweet caramel character smells quite nice  T: the taste pretty much matches the nose directly. The caramel and sweet flavor work nice as there is nothing cloying or overwhelming about them. A bit of a different take on the style compared to what I am used to, but delicious never the less  MF: medium body, medium carbonation  D: This is a very approachable imperial stout. I wish this was one of my introductions to the style as there are no flavors that really overwhelm the palate.

The sweetness is also understated, but there definitely is some caramel or chocolate present. Mild coffee, malts, a hint of bitter hops at the end.

113,782,adamette,2.93,"Live review. Poured from the 550 ml dark brown bottle with gold foil over the cap. Poured into my Samuel Smith pint glass. Mark on neck of bottle: SD02H1 but I am not sure what that means.  A 4 inch generous medium brown head over a mostly very dark body that shows a bit of dark mahogany light in front of a light bulb. Classic look. 4.5  S Dark roast malt and an unexpected dark fruit smell of dates or raisins. At first I thought this was a sense of alcohol but repeated smells revealed the dark fruit smell. At a minimum the smell is interesting. 4.0  T Well, the taste is directly related to the smell. Dark roast malt, dark fruits carry right into the taste from the smell but added is the wet texture and a rather unwelcome and badly disguised taste of alcohol. 2.5  M More thin than I would have liked. I am spoiled by so many American Craft RIS's and their big, luxurious mouthfeel. 2.0  D Not that good. I finished one pint and it took me a while to conclude what I would do with the remaining until I finally poured it out. 2.5  Notes: Samuel Smith, brewer of some of the most classic beers (Oatmeal Stout, Nut Brown Ale) disappointed me with this one. As suggested, my palate is spoiled by other, much more engaging American craft RIS's.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,cbutova,2.87,"Pours pitch black with a huge tan three finger head that retains better than almost any beer I have seen, nice and creamy as well. No lacing at all but it might be my glass. Smells of roasted malts and a metallic scent, not liking this metal thing at all. Also some dark sweet fruits in the nose. The taste is out of whack to me. It has nice roasted malts but also has a huge metallic taste, more than any beer I can think of. It kind of throws the balance off and ruins it. After reading other reviews I definitely get soy sauce, yuck. The extremely sweet fruity taste in this beer also does not belong in an imperial stout. Some hops compliment the finish but the sweetness of this beer is way too overwhelming. Also some cocoa behind the metallic sweetness. Mouthfeel is pretty good. Nice and creamy with good carbonation and a coat of that sweetness. No warming really at all. The drinkability here is not good, the sweet/metallic taste is hardly tolerable. The roasted malts save it but I can hardly finish the bottle. The price was very good but I will only try this one again if I really, really don't trust this bottle.

113,782,CHL,4.26,"Beuatiful beer, opaque black with a tall brown head that tastes like coffee and chocolate. It's so good. Sweet biased, with the pruny imperial stout taste refereed by chocolate, fruit flavors, dark malts, coffee, swirling in a satisfying and thick brew. Certainly warming and alcoholic, but not oppressively.  Only the stomach and this beer's cost impedes its drinkability.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,ChrisCage,4.36,"A- Well distinguished bottle label...very old school. I poured this and got a several inch thick foamy tan head that has a retention unlike any other beer I've seen, finally settling to a frothy film covering the beer. Color resembles thick black tar, no light is penetrating.  S- There is a whole variety of aromas here. First, the smell is not of astringent burnt malts, but more muted, like molasses, and of dried fruit...dates/prunes/raisins. Once I get by that, there is some muted coffee and cocoa aromas and on the finish is when I can detect the delicate toasty malts, and some alcohol is in there too.  T- The flavor is a rich, flavorful mix. There is a smooth coffee-ish, dark chocolate note right up front, followed by something of a metallic flavor, which I'm thinking is due to the higher alcoholic content. The sweet malts are fruity, mainly of the aforementioned raisins, plums and dates. The finish leaves a roasted character, along with a decent hopped bitterness. I would also agree that this has a smoky note in there as well.  M- This is a full bodied beer. Its' got a deep flavor, and is deliciously smooth, as the carbonation is mellow and the bubbles are fine. This reminds me of drinking a bit of a espresso flavored beer, and overall it is well balanced.  D- This is an excellent representation of a stout, and I believe this is my first imperial version. I very much enjoyed drinking this beer, and I think it would be a very good compliment to an aged cheddar or similar type of cheese. It would be good with a rich beef dinner as well. I don't think I'd have another bottle after the first however, as it's so rich and full that it's almost a meal in itself. Great job overall!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Retains pretty well and leaves great lacing.  S: A kind of muted sweetness, full and complex. Roasted coffee notes blended with dark chocolate tones and molasses.  T: Lots of flavor, full and complex. Similar to the smell but moreso, with rich bitter coffee and dark chocolate notes as well as dried fruit.  M: Medium amount of carbonation, very full bodied, with an aftertaste that lingers for a long time.  D: It's very full bodied and heavy, but, given that, it's also very drinkable.

113,782,brewgirl,4.15,"Appearance: poured black, clear, with a tan head. Head retention was impressive--even after five minutes there was still a good amount.  Aroma: This bottle was two years old and was slightly oxidized. Other than that, there was a strong molasses aroma, dark chocolate, toffee and a lot of dark fruits (raisin, currant).  Flavor: The flavor was complex with the molasses and toffee hitting first, followed by a slight coffee/chocolate and then tons of the dried fruit character (mostly raisin). Unlike a lot of American Imperial Stouts that are very hoppy and roasty, this one was more subtle and the English yeast seemed to contribute to the fruitiness.  Mouthfeel/Finish: Full bodied, a little thinner that I would have expected for the style. Had a lingering sweetness in the finish.

Mouthfeel - excellent, good full bodied, and creamy textures.  Drink - Goes down great, could drink a couple of these easily.  Great example of a drinkable stout. Reminds me why I like this company.

113,782,Mistofminn,3.53,"Since Imperial Stouts have easily been my favorite styles lately, I figured I had to give this staple of the style a try.  550 ml bottle poured into a tulip. Dark opaque brown, nearly black colored liquid and a creamy lighter than expected tan head. Fizzes out rather quickly, not the greatest sign. Leaves a tiny bit of lacing here and there.  The nose is slightly muted, but I get molasses, lightly toasted malts, very sweet, possibly some coffee and chocolate. Not a whole lot going on, definitely not as much as I would expect from an Imperial Stout. On a good note, there is no alcohol present?  The taste, unfortunately, is even more muted than the nose. It's really sweet, much more than I was expecting. Molasses, toasted malts, dark coffee, chocolate and cream, it's all there, albeit muted.  Mouthfeel is much lighter than I expected also. It's incredibly smooth and creamy though! Very low carbonation only adds to the smooth and creamyness.  Drinkability is pretty good. Since the ABV is so low (compared to others in the style) this could be a pretty good ""session"" Imperial Stout. It's just not for me. I'm a fan of big, thick and chewy, sticky and slimey stouts.

113,782,capn,4.5,"Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout is a Russian Imperial Stout with an eye-catching, old style label reminiscent of its Victorian roots. It is 7% ABV but other than that, they really don't tell you much else about it. I first had it at a tasting event some time ago and enjoyed it very much but haven't gotten around to reviewing it until now.  It pours with an opaque, dark black color with the slightest ruby hints at the edges that could only be revealed by direct, bright light. It developed a tall, light-brown head that was creamy and fluffy. The initial aroma was very light and only of sweet malt which I thought was a bit odd. That is when I realized that it had been chilled to standard refrigerator temperature which is well below its recommended serving temperature of approximately 60 degrees. After allowing it to warm a bit, the aroma evolved into one you could really stick you nose into. It was deep and complex but all its notes were subtle and required hunting, which is part of the fun for me. The malty sweetness remained but I also detected slight notes of vanilla and chocolate. The first sip doesn't disappoint either. The mouthfeel starts with a moderate tingle on the front of the tongue which subsides quickly, developing into a thick, creamy feel all over the mouth. The taste is initially slightly sweet which instantly gives way to the hops and alcohol, which blend excellently. The flavor has complexity, but like the aroma, the notes are subtle and you have to work for them. I detected bitter chocolate, hops, some roast, and smoke. It finishes dry with slight black coffee notes and lingers a little.  Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout is an excellent beer. It is right in line with the expected characteristics of this style while maintaining great balance throughout. I recommend you use a sniff and sip technique while drinking and enjoy it slowly to get the most out of it. It has the qualities to be enjoyed alone or with food. It even has the legs to stand with a full-bodied, maduro cigar.  I wish you Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.

It is oily coal black with a deep tan head that yields neither for man nor beast. Smells of fruit soaked in rum in a barrel. With a cocoa powder sprinkled on top. Yes, I filled a barrel with fruit, rum, and cocoa just to confirm that so you can believe me. Taste starts with prunes, then moves to a surpisingly mellow coffee/dark chocolate mix that melts to a pleasantly dry chalkiness. WOW! This is the subtlest stout I've ever had and it is just off the charts. Mouthfeel is soft if a bit undercarbonated but its English so it comes by it honestly. Drinkability is fantastic for a stout. Not bitter or over-roasted at all. Not what I expected, the style is not my favorite but this is just phenol-menal, if you'll forgive me.

Head dissipates gradually, leaving a good amount of lacing. Smell has a decent malty character, but also a pretty prominent soy sauce smell... from the barley? Not sure, but definitely a unique and unexpected smell.  Taste starts off with a bit of malty sweetness, which was surprising from a stout. That gives way to some hoppy bitterness which coats the palate and spreads the flavor around. Not too much soy sauce taste, which is good. The back end finishes off with an alcoholic kick, which is atypical of a stout with a relatively low ABV. The bitterness also lingers into the aftertaste for quite a bit. There are very subtle nuances of vanilla and coffee as well. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, not too heavy, but not watery either. A nicely balanced brew, with a small amount of carbonation.  Drinkability is only hindered by the rather surprising smell and interesting taste, which is to say, not really very much. A solid example of an RIS.

A full on straight down pour yields about 1/2 an inch of rich creamy nutmeg colored head.  Aroma is exceptionally sweet- bitter chocolate dominates the nose.  This is yet another exceptional offering from a brewery that's fast becoming a mainstay in my fridge. It's mildly creamy and beautifully smooth.

Flavors include coffee, hops, lighter fruits such as bananas, and some slight booze-iness. A little toast-iness in there as well. This definitely tastes like an English-style ale, with an almost steel or metallic taste. Not too bad though.

Sort of like an ice cream float.  Aroma is very heavy on the caramel. Vanilla and spices. Reminds me of Halloween candy for some reason.  Taste is heavier on the caramel malt than most imperial stouts. Sweet creamy aftertaste with the roasted malt in the background for the most part. Not sure how this would go if there was more alcohol in it. Definitely a sweet stout that finishes dry with roasted malt, just short of charcoal flavors but not heavy on either chocolate or coffee flavors.  This is a cool beer. Not sure if it's my first choice among the imperial stouts.. more just like a British stout but still very good.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Vengeance526,3.98,"Pours a dark black color with a 1-finger tan head that slowly dies down to a light ring and leaves a good bit of lacing.  Aroma is very roasty upfront with lots of coffee and caramel evident.  Taste closely reflects the smell with lots of roasted malt upfront and notes of chocolate, coffee, toffee and caramel all around. A slight hint of alcohol can be detected in the finish.  Full bodied, very rich and smooth. Enjoyable RIS overall, great to sip on. I doubt I'd have more than one at a time, but I'm sure I'll try this again in the future.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Beernoisseur,4.92,"This is a sublime beer. Near perfect, if not perfect in every category. The bottle is badass looking, like opening it is going to be a historic event in and unto itself. Gold foil, awards won in a different century, things of that nature- they all add to the feeling of ceremony associated with this beer.  Appearance is so dark that it might be sucking the light out of the room like a black hole. The head was smaller than I expected, but the pour was not aggressive.  The first aroma to greet me was the scent of fine bourbon. This quickly gave way to toasty, fruity notes, with maybe a hint of caramel coffee in the background.  The flavor is excellent. Everything is in balance. Toasiness leads the charge, but in there is a citric fruitiness that delights to no end. The hops are muted, but only just. There's almost like a barbeque like flavor in the mix. This beer would be great with a huge cheeseburger grilled right before you put the barbeque away for winter. you know, sometime in late october, early november.  I love stouts, and this is certainly a front runner for my favorite.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,KTCamm,4.38,"Poured from the classic Sam Smith 550ml bottle into a pint glass.  Pours jet black - is this oil or liquid tar? A total eclipse of light, pouring this makes the room darker. Light brown foam, excellent 1/2 inch retention and very creamy head.  Smell is roasted. Coffee notes.  Taste is stout near-perfection. Smooth, creamy, rich, and chewy. Very dry. Some chocolate. Hop is buried and hidden but reveals in the aftertaste.  Smooth in the mouthfeel. Milky.  A very drinkable stout - could one put two of these down? Perhaps, but better to savor the one you are drinking.

S - Smells of roasted barley, chocolate, toffee, and a light alcoholic fruity essence.  T - Big dark chocolate dipped in cherry flavor. A Hint of hoppy bitterness keeps malty sweetness in check. Very balanced.  M - Medium/full mouthfeel. Very smooth and velvety. It drinks like a dessert. You can sip it, as you should, but it's smooth enough to quaff (do it, and die).  D - It took me about 50 min to finish (not that i had to take that long, but i wanted to take that long). It was delectable. I loved every second of my indulgence. It was smooth, well-rounded, and a big task, all at the same time. One of my favorite stouts tasted to date.

Very rich malty sweetness like brown sugar and a nice smokey accent.  Thick and full with a light accent of carbonation.  Great! IS is still my favorite style and this fits nicely into the lineup.

113,782,mdwalsh,4.05,"A: Poured into a snifter it forms a rather large head, but it's pretty. The beer is black with lots of active carbonation and the head is solid sand tan. Lots of different sized bubbles. The head fades slowly, but not too slowly.  S: Smell is powerful as soon as I pour. I get not much chocolate, but a little alcohol. Sweet, dark, malty fruit smells are what really dominates. I get a little citrus even, but now, now I think I smell a hint of soy sauce. I'm thinking of Orange Chicken with soy sauce.  T: Sweet and bitter. very odd. Very much like an English Porter mixed with a baltic porter in my opinion. It's the water. Has the same unique taste of all Sam Smith Beers. Sort of reminds me of the beach for some reason. A little salty, fishy taste, but not in a bad way. Still, not what I want in my RIS, doesn't taste dark enough.  M: Very light, proper carbonation and all. Leaves the mouth feeling refreshed and satisfied.

113,782,dasenebler,4.13,"Pours deep, dark black. Nice and creamy, light tan head. Aroma is full of roast and a touch of sweetness.  Flavor is big and roasty. This beer emphasizes the unique character of a stout-- the roasted barley-- so much so that the flavor is smoky and peaty. Pretty fantastic if you ask me. Not overly sweet or boozy like so many other imperial stouts. Roastiness begets a dry tanginess. Mouthfeel is not nearly as heavy as some other examples of the style. Could use a little more creaminess. At 7 percent, this imperial is probably the most drinkable I've had. Excellent stout.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,rvdoorn,4.75,"Had this beer in my favorite beer pub in Wageningen, de Vlaamse reus. Poured into a sniffer. The beer pours a very deep black color with a fantastic full creamy, brown head that lasted very long.  Smell: fully of flavor, wow. Coffee, roasted malts, dark fruits (plums, figs), sweet caramel, chocolate brownies and a nice warming alcolhol.  Taste: as impressive and full as the smell. Roasted malts, hops, plums, figs, coffee, chocolate and a clear hint of salty liquorish. Aftertaste is a bit smoky with some nice bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Thick, creamy smooth, medium carbonation. This is a feel good beer  Overall: This is surely one of the best imperial stouts out there. If only this one would be a ""limited production"" or ""very rare"", it would likely be voted in the top three at BA. This because many people seem to be biased by the hype of limited productions....Hail the czar of Russian imperial stouts! Highly recommendable!!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,STEG,4.41,Poured an ominous black color with a foamy 2 finger khaki head. From a 12oz gold foil cap sealed top and one of the the most tastefully perfect labels I've ever laid eyes on.  Smells like bittersweet chocolate and black coffee with a definite earthy almost mushroom like(in a good way)undertone.  Tastes like someone paired unsweetened bakers chocolate with espresso. Really dark and wonderful with some notes of chicory and cedar.  Smooth mouthfeel at the start with a bit of a warming alcohol finish.  I could drink the entire four pack. An extremely enjoyable imperial stout that should be taken seriously.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,PartyBear,4.58,"A - Black body and a tan head, the way a good stout should look.  S - Bold roasted malts strong on the nose. Coffee, and liquorish. Sweet fruit undertones.  T - The first hit is bitter, fresh roasted coffee, with rich smokey malts. The coffee leads to a bitterness in the middle of dark chocolate, with a hint of burnt raisins. The finish is smooth and bitter, with a warming presence of alcohol.  M - Not as thick as some imperial stouts but the flavours are so rich and textured you don't really notice. There is a touch of oiliness, which coats the mouth.  D - I would love to find a better imperial stout than Samuel Smith's but as of yet I have not and to be quite honest I don't know what more I could expect.

113,782,yourefragile,4.28,"550 mL bottle purchased in March 08  Pours a dark, nearly opaque brown with garnet hues around the edges against light. Massive, fluffy deep tan head with a light crimson hue. Aroma is complex balance of dark fruits and toffee/caramel malts. This almost smells like a red wine at first. Full bodied with light carbonation results in a very creamy, soft feel on the tongue. Flavors are similar to the aroma, body is initially fruity sweet, before the malt and chocolate flavors take over with a slight hop bitterness in the finish. Malt and bitter fruitiness lingers long into the finish. I had purchased two bottles of this and drank one fresh.

T- Taste very good. Exactly what to expect from a Imperial Stout. Strong hints of chocolate. Got some caramel and cocoa also. M - Mouthfeel was average.

113,782,TheViolator666,2.74,"I just don't understand. Why does everyone go berserk over this brewery? Over the past two nights I've had 3 beers from ""good ol'"" Sam Smith that have done nothing but disappoint. This being the second stout I've had (first was the highly revered Oatmeal Stout) has followed in this trend. I went into this really wanting to like it... truly hoping that this brewery would offer something that I would like, but no.  That being said, I would buy a keg of this before I thought about taking another sip of Guinness.  550 ml bottle poured into Great Lakes stout glass.  A: Appearance is average. Dark brown/black with a thin brown cap. No lacing is visible.  S: The smell turned me off immediately. It smells like smoked over-salted beef jerky. Reminded me instantly of Guinness... must be something about the United Kingdom, but I really haven't had a stout from across the Atlantic that I've enjoyed in the slightest.  T: At least the taste is an improvement on the smell (or stench). Pretty bitter, surprisingly. A dash of dark fruit sweetness. The hint of coffee flavor saves this one. Hides the 7.00% ABV well. Gets better as it approaches room temperature, as with any stout.  M/D: Why must the UK make thin/bland beers? Too thin for my taste at least, but I guess that's why it goes down so smooth.  I'm no patriot, but fuck bless the USA for making such awesome Imperial Stouts.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

113,782,gory4d,4.48,"Pours opaque dark brown-to-black with a thick tan two-finger head, after an impressive brown reverse cascade. The smell is a hit of alcohol, with a dark-roasted grain mellowness and lots of dried fruit -- date, mostly. The taste is more rich dried fruit, with a taste like good African coffee smells but rarely delivers, passing into some lemon-rind astringency and a pleasant mineral, charcoal-smoke finish.

113,782,MadTown1000,4.22,"Poured from big pint+ bottle into a wine glass (lesson: when packing your apartment, pack the pint glasses last, not first.) Pours an apparent black - when held up to the light, it's actually a very dark nut brown. Just a small amount of blown foam quickly recedes away, leaving no lace and just a bit of residual froth. The usual imperial stout scent is obvious from the bottle, and also from the glass - I'd put it at a little sweeter than most with a certain fruity character to the aroma. The mouthfeel is smooth and syrupy - I notice that even before the flavor, which is quite mild for the type. I taste nuts and maple syrup, with the alcohol becoming more assertive in the aftertaste. More carbonation than you can see in the small head. 7% ABV isn't extreme for the style, but given the smoothness this could be extraordinarily dangerous - I find myself going through this a lot faster than other imperial stouts. Quite good, in keeping with what Samuel Smith's usually puts out. Expect a much smoother ride than you get with a lot of imperial stouts, although I think there is a slight sacrifice in terms of the intensity and complexity of flavor.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Metalmonk,3.77,"Great 1/2-inch head develops after a hard pour, but it sinks and dies quickly. Color is deep black murk, with the crown a toasty brown color.  Toffee, caramel, different varieties of chocolate and peat/smoke in the aroma. A little black licorice sneaks in too.  Flavor brings out some char, with chocolate and anise fighting it out for space up front. Coffee and dark fruit are here, but faint and subtle. Burnt sugar and burnt chocolate linger in the finish.  This would be a much better beer if the mouthfeel weren't so tingly. Much too soda-like, ie. lotsa carbonation. A thicker, gooier texture would've worked wonders for the flavors that are happening here.  Never been blown away by this brewery, though I remain reverent. This might as well be considered an example of the original intent of a Russian Imperial Stout.

Other then that it is pretty dark and opaque, forget about seeing through this one.  Smell is equally dark as the beer looks. Deep roasted malts mixed with coffee, chocolate and molasses. Subtle dark fruits in the background that become more apparent in the taste.  Raisins mixed with some spiced plum start the party off. Quickly followed by a smoky malt, chocolate and coffee tang. Nice robust flavors but a slightly anorexic body.  This beer is thin for a RIS. I expect a thick, chewy, bad ass brew but got the beer body of a brown ale. I think this one could use a little more time during the boil to condense the wort further and caramelize the sugars just a bit further. This is the thinnest RIS I've ever had but it is tasty.

113,782,biboergosum,4.17,"550ml bottle, at the Metro Pool Hall, working my way through their commendable fridge(s).  This beer pours a nice inky black, with very slight red edges, and three fingers of puffy, foamy, and extravagantly bubbly chocolate milk brown head, which damned-near coats the glass as it genially recedes.  It smells strongly and evenly of dark chocolate, caramel malt, toffee candy, edgy black fruit, oxidized red wine, a touch of black licorice, and faint earthy, weedy hops. The taste is semi-sweet milk chocolate, gritty caramel/toffee malt, subtle and indistinct sour black fruit, surprisingly prominent cola and anise notes, a wisp of woodsmoke, and mild earthy hops.  The carbonation is generally quite understated, the body a stocky, solid medium weight, and silky smooth, with suggestions of creaminess. It finishes on the sweet side, with more chocolate, roast, and touched fruit.  As it warms, I get a strong semblance of boozy hot chocolate, which would make it, I imagine, a lovely après-whatever sipper, be it with dessert, or more robust cold weather activity.

113,782,wl0307,4.35,"Revisiting this lovely ale 3 years since my last encounter; BB 05/2009, served cool in a tulip-shaped sniffer (Gulden Draak's branded glass). NOTE: the packaging has changed from the clear bottle to the dark brown one now - good to see some improvement with presentation!  A: pours a jet black hue, coming with a well-lasting tan frothy head and very light carbonation. S: oily and thick, full of dark malts' aroma but shy of more pronounced coffee-ish aroma - jammy plums (but not sweet), fat black prunes, a faint touch of licorice, focused edge of oily black syrup, gristy malts, a fine touch of lightly toasted nuts and Fuggles hops. Deep, semi-complex, oily and malty. T: not as thick as the nose suggests, the foretaste is soothingly carbonated, packed of toasted walnuts, fat black prunes, burned malts, grassiness, then a wave of delicious prune-ish and winey fruitiness expands along with earthy hop bitterness that intensifies to render a semi-dry palate, while black malts and a rather light roasty hint lend a bit more complexities in the end. M&D: soft on the carbonation and pretty fresh for the full flavour. The consistent, mildly winey-sour hint becomes almost the most important key to connect different flavour elements. Comparing this bottle with my previous notes, I can say that the performance this time is equally good overall. Delicious, lighter than the abv. suggests, even quaffable!  * Tasting Date: 19/05/06 Got this bottle at just 1.79 pounds at the Nelson Wines, South Wimbledon, London. Bargain! Served cool in a large Burgundy bulb wine glass. 4.5 A: jet black hue; the effervescent tan beer head comes creamy and tightly frothy, only slowly settling while tight and even sheets of lacing emerge on the tracks... Elegant! 4.5 S: sour-sweet and ""jammy"" dark fruits (raisins+prunes+dried longan-fruits) prevail upfront... leather-ish, chewy and slightly roasty dark maltiness gradually join force, resulting in a ""sticky plum pudding""-ish aroma with coconut-shavings on the top; an impossible-to-miss and profound treacle-ish note stays deep and low, which, not as thick and sweet as in other samples, rather gets a refreshing sour edge attached to it at every step. Overall, aromatic, fruity and sweet--complex and inviting~~ 4.5 T: aromatic, black-sugary maltiness hits the palate upfront, backed by an intensifyingly black-prune-ish, slightly winey, and smoked fruity+malty mid-flavour; the initially creamy palate gradually turns drier and drier, where the sour-sweet, juicy, chewy and slightly woody-tannic vinous dark fruits provide a solid backbone and attach to the deep end of the palate, joined force by bits of roasted grainy elements with a tinge of licorice lingering towards the very end. 4.5 M&4.5 D: velvety smooth yet full-bodied for a 7%abv. Imperial Stout, without falling thick or hard on alc.; the softly carbonated body is ideal, which, along with a constant sour-fruitiness, keeps the thicker malty elements in check, so as to ensure a balanced palate. Slightly on the weak side for a preferably heavier roasted-malt input and also aromatic hoppy presence. But if one places this beer alongside Harvey's Imperial Russian Stout, there's an idea how a genuine English ""RIS"" might have tasted some hundred years ago... For me this Imperial Stout is utterly easy-drinking in this category--really worth seeking out this one!

113,782,JerzDevl2000,4.1,"Picked this up recently just because it's one of the classics and a style that I love. This beer is a lot more subtle than I thought it would be, but that's probably because I'm used to the American versions of this that are a lot more potent and complex. This is, without a doubt, the most subtle Russian Imperial Stout that I've had, but that doesn't necessarily make it bad. It's well up into the 80's here in New Jersey today, and it doesn't feel too out of place with the lighter foods that I've been eating.  Decent pour to this - dark, light on the carbonation, and a decent amount of tan head. The taste was mellow - some current, bitter chocolate, and plum notes to this, and it goes down easier than just about any other RIS I've ever had. This almost reminded me of a strong bock beer because of it's medium body and mouthfeel and near-absence of carbonation. The lack of alcohol can be felt here too, as I've downed nearly all of the bottle and can hardly feel it. For me, that's good thing, as I prefer the taste to dominate over the alcohol!  I thought this was a solid beer that seems almost categorically mismatched in this day and age of microbrews by the shelfload. Nevertheless, I've never had a bad beer from Samuel Smith and it's nice to enjoy something as timless as this. Those looking for an RIS that will knock them into next week will be disappointed but for true beer connoisseurs, this is a pleasant surprise and a joy to drink. It's easy to see why this has been brewed for as long as it has.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

113,782,vacax,4.08,"A: Opaque almost entire black, but dark brown upon extreme inspection. Big old dark tan head. Very good rentention and lace. When I take a drink the glass is coated where the beer used to be.  S: Fruity ala raisins and apples, chocolate, and brown. Some brown sugar with bready and cookielike components. No alcohol and not pungent.  T: Dark fruits with a mild chocolate malt backbone. Not extremely complex, but tasty and well done. Dry coffee finish helps balance this malty gem.  M: Not thick enough to choke on, but silky smooth and medium-low carbonation. For a 7% beer, it is luxurious.  D: Close to a regular stout at this ABV, but the flavor and mouthfeel are essentially style-defining. A classic beer, and one of the better stouts available nationwide. Craft brewers have made imperial stouts that are incredibly complex now, but this one is still a pillar of the style. A great starter imperial stout and a widely available and relatively inexpensive beer to revisit whenever the mood strikes.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Little to no lace.  Coffee, bitter chocolate and sweet molasses in the nose along with a hint of vanilla and roasted grain.  Taste is coffee, chocolate and molasses with a slight rumlike note in the background. A subtle sugary sweetness lingers. Roasted grains and dark fruit (prunes, figs?). More coffee and chocolate and a faint spicy hop flavor and bitterness at the tail.  Mouth is a silky medium.  Drinkability is very high indeed.  At 7% this is a milder RIS than I've become accustomed to but it really doesn't give anything up other than mouthfeel.

113,782,Offa,4.57,"This outstanding stout is very rich, complex, and full-bodied yet smooth, not harsh, and has everything well-balanced, elements just restrained before the point of being over the top.  Black - thoroughly - it has a short but dense light brown head that shrinks very, very, very slowly to a smaller but still dense, creamy, lasting top. It leaves some lace as well.  The aroma is strong and rich with prunes, chocolate, hints of wine, burnt sugar, blackstrap molasses, and steak sauce.  The taste is similarly strong and rich, yet smooth. The alcohol is clearly present, but not harsh, simply giving a noticeabler alcoholic warmth and bite which somewhat balances the sweetness, along with a light bitterness. The taste has chocolate, earth, leaves, stewed caramellised prunes and other fruit, along with spices and a faint coffee element in the finish. It has a light smokiness without actually tasting burnt. Though very strong and rich, its elements are smooth, restrained and balanced for an imperial stout.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Gosox8787,3.78,"Bought a bomber of this stout to enjoy at the beginning of my drinking session. Poured from the bottle into a glass in two parts. The appearance was opaque black with a creamy, beige, two finger head. The smell is heavy on roasted malt, with coffee notes dominating, There are dark fruit flavors that offer a nice sweet balance. I offered a sip of thsi to a couple of my friends and they equated the smell to soy sauce. The taste is strong and relatively complex. The dark roasted malts lead hte way again, with a nice sweetness from the dark fruit flavor. There also is a little boozy, bourbon note that follows so after. The mothufeel is heavy with very little carbonation. Drinkability is only decent because the ABV is above average and the flavor is strong.

Not much of anything else is present.  T - Bitter roasted malts come through straight up and in the finish. There is some butter caramel in there as well. The alcohol in this is well hidden. Very good.  M - This is a mixed bag. It is rich and luscious as it should be but at the same time there is a very disconcerting and quite unpleasant burn on my tongue almost as if there is exceptionally high carbonation. It could be better.  D - For the ABV and style this is quite drinkable. It is a very good beer and it would be more drinkable if it went down slightly more smoothly but the mouthfeel issue is making it hard to see lots of this going down.

113,782,ommegoose,4.32,"550 ml brown bottle. I would guess it might be a bit old, judging the source.  Very deep black color. Dark tan head, starts out at a few inches, then drops and stays at a half inch. Odd lacing pattern (probably my glass).  Great classic stout aroma. Mellow milk chocolate and roasty notes. Really inviting and balanced.  Roasted malt flavor is bold, with strong coffee and milk and bittersweet chocolate tones. Never comes across as burnt. Some milky sweetness. Dry bitter finish, with little hop character. Raisin and pruney fruitiness. Strong roasty aftertaste that lingers long. One of the rare bigger beers that I liked a bit less when it warmed up. I started to notice some more acidity, but the body got smoother at that point.  I thought it was a bit too fizzy at first, but it settles down and feels pretty rich and full-bodied. Coats the tongue.  Very drinkable. Really sneaky when at colder temperatures, making it dangerously quaffable. Somewhat expensive, but not too bad compared to many imperial stouts.

A standard pour in the mug produces a 1 1/2 finger dark mocha head.  Smell: Mixes of roasted malt, yeast, cocoa powder and heavy dark (almost kenyan roast)coffee.  Taste: Good taste from this one. Strong bitterness that leads to heavy dark coffee flavors and faint hints of chocolate.  Mouthfeel: Thick velvet texture that heavily coats the mouth. An excellent representation of the style.  Drinkability: This really filled me up.

The finish has a touch of alcohol accompanied by a bit a of malts and hops fracas. Dark chocolate notes in the background as well.

Well done SS!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,johnmichael712,3.53,"Appearance: Poured out of a 12 oz bottle into a nonic glass. There is no freshness date on the bottle. This beer pours a deep black color that just barely allows some lamp light through it, but in normal light you'd swear it's as black as they come. The two-fingered head is easily formed and is a beautiful medium brown color that takes quite a long time to dissipate, and eventually fades to a ring around the top of the beer with moderate surface coverage. A good amount of Belgian lace is left behind on the sides of my glass, and this is one fabulous looking beer.  Smell: The nose of this beer isn't as strong as some of the other Russian Imperial Stouts I've had, but it's still a pleasure to behold. Notes of black and chocolate roasted malts are well balanced with bittersweet chocolate, blackstrap molasses, and black currant fruit. There are also hints of espresso and a coffee-like earthiness, and a bit of alcohol to round it all out. Overall a subdued, yet wonderfully balanced, nose.  Taste: This beer starts out with a moderate acidity that has strong notes of raisins and other dark fruits, along with a strong hop flavor that is reminiscent of bitter orange peel or lemon zest. The flavor then moves to a moderate amount of roasted malt flavor that has notes of bittersweet chocolate and freshly-ground coffee, and this beer finally fades to a bit off treacle toffee sweetness and alcohol flavor along with a bit more acidity and hop flavor that compliments the exceptionally dry finish. I have to complain, however, because there are times that the flavor of this beer is downright astringent, and for a beer that's only 7% that's quite a shame. I was expecting a bit more complexity and depth, and unfortunately Sam didn't deliver.  Mouthfeel: I was surprised with my first sip of Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout, mainly because it doesn't feel like some of the much heavier American versions that I've been drinking lately. This one is much more acidic, much more carbonated, and bit oilier. Other than that, this beer has a medium body with a pleasant creamy-smoothness.  Drinkability: Not an exceptionally heavy beer, the texture and the low carbonation makes it possible to put back quite a few of these. The acidity, however, might be a bit too much, but this beer still manages to maintain good drinkability.  Notes: Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout is definitely a classic beer, and it's hard to fault something that's been winning gold medals since 1896 and that comes from as respected a brewery as Samuel Smith's. Unfortunately, however, I must do exactly that, and in my opinion this beer is no where near the level of Stone's IRS, North Coast's Old Rasputin, Founder's RIS, or countless other Russian Imperial Stouts. For a category of beer that is absolutely bursting forth with quality, Samuel Smith's version just isn't quite what I'm looking for. Judging by the other ratings for this beer it's possible that I got a bad bottle, but it's more likely that this beer just isn't quite up to snuff. I'll be buying this beer again to see if this was just a bad bottle, so look for possible changes coming up.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

The darkness of my glass was very impressive. Help up to a light the brew had just a hint of red filter through, while the edges appeared a dark brown. The head was almost two fingers thick and steadily dissipated.  The aroma and taste were a bit of a shock. MAPLE. VERY MAPLE. The aroma was somewhat noticeable. The flavor was a smack to my pallet, and not a good one. It was very overbearing, and intensified as it had time to breathe. I'm not getting this one again.

Slight lacing as I twist the glass in the light to see the tinges of red-browns.  First Imperial Stout, but I've been around stouts and porters for a few years now.  Aroma of rough oatmeal grains, coffee, and raisins or dates, namely, sweet dark fruits. A lot more going on that I thought, but not as much as I'd hoped. Compared to the porters and stouts I've had, it's got a bit more depth.  Tastes of roasted coffee, hints of sweetness, more raisins than dates, maybe some nuts. A trifle smoky like a porter or stout should be. Some alcohol, pleasant and warming. Reminds me in a distant way of an au jus beef, and I'd take it with same without reservation.  Creamy, almost no carbonation. Smooth in the mouth, easy going, a good last pitcher of the night.

113,782,Buschyfor3,4.42,"Poured from a 550ml bottle with a gold foil seal into my engraved Lambda Chi Alpha pint glass. Yeah, I'm a frat boy.  A: Poured a deep, rich brown almost black liquid; held up to the light, just the faintest ruby hues appear along the edges of the glass. Thin, creamy, khaki head bubbled up but quickly dissipated. If looks are any indicator, this beer looks rich and complex!  S: The first whiff I took after opening the bottle but before pouring, and I got hints of sweet, dried fruits: raisins and dates. Upon pouring, the nose opened even more and I got hints of soy sauce, coffee and what reminded me of cinnamon and brown sugar oatmeal.  T: the very first sip presents a lot of bold flavors (at least to me): again I taste a salty note reminiscent of soy sauce, but that gradually smoothes out. This saltiness is balanced by notes of roasted coffee, faint dark chocolate and a toffee-like sweetness that shows underneath. The finish rounds out with some malty breadiness. Smooth finish leaves you coming back for more.   M: chewy and pleasantly thick, but there is enough carbonation is present to cause some prickly sensation on my tongue (and I can see the bubbles floating up the surface of the glass after every sip. However, this is a quite a filling beer as it does coat the throat with each sip. Delicious.  D: Bottle indicates this beers is 7.0% ABV but I feel like the alcohol is hidden fairly well. As I get further into the bottle, though, I do begin to notice a bit of a warming sensation with each sip. Definitely an enjoyable beer, but it will probably only take two of these and you'll be good to go for the evening.  I'm really impressed with this beer. I am a big fan of stouts, but this is my first ever Russian Imperial Stout and I tried the Samuel Smith based on what reviews I had read from BA.

113,782,dismal,4.33,"I love stouts, and imperial stouts are one of my favorite types of stouts. I've been meaning to pick this beer up for quite some time now and was excited to try it. Poured into a pint glass it pours a black opaque color with a tanish colored head, looks great! The aroma is roasted malts, chocolate, a little bit of coffee? Either way the smell is wonderful, though the taste is quite better. With a somewhat thick and creamy mouthfeel with a taste of coffee and chocolate that is pretty sweet it's a great tasting beer. Easily drinkable. There are some imperial stouts I could only drink a few of in one night but this one I could easily do more of no problem. Not a high alcohol content and a great taste this is one I will be picking up again for sure.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,washburnkid,4.38,"A: Two fingers of a firm, whipped head over a pitch black beer with the slightest hint of light brown at the bottom of the glass. A small head sticks around. S: Sweet roasted aromas, milk chocolate; heavy and sweet ""cream""/dairy smell, like smelling the top of a cupcake (for lack of better analogy); dark fruit aromas. T: Surprisingly fruity character; dark, ripe berries and other fruits and a creamy malty flavor topped with bitter chocolate. M: Incredibly thick and creamy; smooth, but leaves a good amount of residue on the palate. D: One of the best stouts I've had. A pretty toned-down version of an RIS, but still an absolutely brilliant take. I can't wait to grab another of these!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,joerodiii,4.35,"This beer is a nice surprise. In these days of over the top, extreme RIS's, a ""sessionable"" one is a nice change.  Black, nearly opaque beer with minimal head. Nice, balanced aroma. Chocolate dominates but does not overwhelm. Taste is similar. You can really taste chocolate, but it fits nicely with the rest of the beer. It is not too bitter, not too thick, and the alcohol is subtly in the background. There is a touch of malty sweetness with no over-roasted flavors.  Overall, this might be the most drinkable RIS I've tated.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,MVotter,4.47,"Poured from the classic-decorated bottled, a 550 ml.  Cola-colored ... has a sweet whiskey aroma ... mmm.  The first pour was down the side of the glass to preserve some carbonation.  The taste is a balanced blend of coffee, molasses, and sweet malts. This is a delicious brew.  As compared to others I've tasted, the Smith's Imperial Stout is a lighter body, less bitter beer. For me the taste tended more toward the malts and less toward the bitter coffee flavors.  The mouthfeel with the pour down the side of the glass did retain an effervescence. A later pour down the middle of the goblet produced a thick, tan head which settled back to a creamy, thin froth ... and much less tingly mouthfeel.  Very drinkable, pleasant, tasty experience for sure.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,PintOHops,4.27,"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance/Smell - Appears a dark oil like black with hardly any transparency, and has a quarter inch frothy brown, bubble like head. Head reduces semi quick and leaves no lacing. Smells of sharp citrus notes coupled with rich chocolaty, almost cake like malts. Very robust! Sweet overall with fruity cherry and raisin notes, although I did detect some minor earthy notes.  Taste/Mouthfeel - Tastes of rich chocolaty flavors and sweet malts, very delicious! Nice citrus and coffee like flavors on the finish, with some coffee like bitterness lingering on the palate just a tad. Hints of earthy notes, pretty hearty with coffee flavors overall, and hints of alcohol as it warms. Mouthfeel is smooth and somewhat creamy, with some evident carbonation on the palate even. I would say lightly carbonated and full bodied.  Drinkability/Final thoughts - I could definitely find myself enjoying more that a few of these. Probably 3-4 even, I love how robust and full flavored this beer is, although I admit that I do enjoy other stouts more. This is a great example of a stout, I think I would have appreciated more of a creamy, thick body. Still very good, I recommend you give this a try.

113,782,ccrida,4.74,"550ml that's pushing 2 years old, maybe more. I've had this 'fresh', but it's been a while. I've heard this cellars poorly, and thought I'd find out for myself. Poured into my Delirium snifter, Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout is a dark inky syrupy color with a large dark tan head that leaves sheets of foamy lace.  Smell is super rich and sweet, boat loads of caramel, and I don't mean caramel malt, I mean caramel syrup, like you'd put on a sundae! Coupled with some coffee, it smells like the sugary starbucks drinks I'm a bit embarrassed to admit my wife enjoys! I'm not embarrassed to say it's fantastic and pretty much blowing my mind, before I took even I sip I knew this experiment was a raging success!  Taste is also very rich, but with quite a bit more depth and complexity then the nose, and not as sweet - but damn good! Wow, there's still lots of caramel, with coffee and chocolate and pleasant roasty char that I normally don't love, but tempers the sweetness perfectly here. Just phenomenal. Thank god I have another one of these on deck! There's still a bit of sharpness from the esters that isn't my favorite of the English Ales but is uniform to Samuel Smith's, and while it's tempered here more then any other one of their beers, it kept me from giving this a 5.  Mouthfeel is syrupy but not to sticky or thick, with a creeamy carbonation. Really quite smooth and luscious, wow!  Drinkability is ridiculous, I just can't believe how good this beer is right now. This is truly one of the best out there, so much flavor for being only 7%, it's really all you need. I should say I don't like RIS's overly roasty, bitter or hoppy, so if you do, this may not work for you. But if you're a fan of the sweeter strong ales on the other side of the pond, quit tripping over yourselves for the next big thing and go back to the roots, Samuel Smith's knows what it's all about.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,BarrelO,3.61,"12oz bottle poured into a Stone IRS goblet. Hey, Sam Smith finally got their act together and started putting their beer in brown bottles. Good for them. The label art is also good. Very League of Extraordinary Gentlemen-esque.  A: Pours black as night. No light penetrates even when held up to a lamp. Rather robust head, albeit one that dissipates fairly quickly. Decent amount of lacing.  S: Redolent of dark malts and black licorice.  T: Wow. Huge sucker punch of roasty bitterness right off the bat. I don't remember it being nearly this bitter. As it warms up, the bitterness recedes in favor of the malt and licorice flavors in the nose. Somewhat sour aftertaste.  M: Appropriately syrupy for the style, but less so than other styles. Not surprising, given this beer's relative weakness compared to other imperial stouts.  D: Sam Smith deserves props for helping to revive the style and providing a template for other brewers to build on. But nowadays, it comes across like a retro video game; it's great nostalgic fun for those who were there at the time, but for younger enthusiasts, it's kind of hard to see what the fuss was all about. It's still worth a try, if only as a historical artifact. But I can't recommend it as an exemplar of the style. Honestly, it's not even the best beer in the Sam Smith portfolio.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Thorpe429,4,"G: Imperial pint glass.  A: Pours a ""not very dark for this style"" cola color out of the bottle, but appears a bit darker in the glass to the point where it is nearly opaque. My pour might have been a little hard, but I got a good two-and-a-half or three fingers worth of head. The head is also a creamy color; again, reminiscent of the foam associated with colas. The head recedes fairly quickly with the slightest bit of lacing.  S: Slightly sweet on a malt base. Hints of toffee and perhaps a little bit of caramel. Faint smell of dark fruits.  T: Sweet in the mouth. Much more sweet on the palate than I would have expected from the nose. Slightly sour with little heat from the alcohol. Biscuity malt with a little bit of chocolate--another thing I didn't detect with the first whiff. Slight fruity undertones in the background--maybe dark cherries, which could contribute the bit of sourness I've detected.  M: Not overly carbonated, and slightly sweet on the tip of the tongue. As it sits, it becomes more and more creamy. The mouthfeel is somewhere between a typical milk stout and the other RIS's that I have come across.  D: Given the low ABV for the style, this is quite a bit more drinkable than is typical. The is one of the first imperial stouts I've had where I could imagine having a couple throughout an evening.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Jablonski,4.2,"Poured into a pint glass. I hadn't seen this beer on the shelves before, and picked it up to be adventurous; from glancing at the reviews it appears it's a pretty solid RIS.  A: Black as night and completely opaque; with an aggressive pour, a medium sized head resulted and minimal lacing.  S: A minty dark chocolate aroma is strongest in this beer, but an espresso aroma is not to be outdone by much. I can also pick up hints of dark fruits in the smell.  T: The taste no letdown from my original impression. Great mix of chocolate and fruits in this beer with a damped effect from the coffee. The only think missing is shot of hops somewhere to make this beer complete. Still, it's choice.  M: Good carbonation, nice thickness.  D: Very drinkable, it seems to be at a lower ABV than many RIS's that I see. Great beer, and I will purchase again.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,BARFLYB,3.9,"550ml bottle into a Flying Fish pint glass and then some. 1st time having this.  A- A shade darker than their oatmeal stout, this imperial version is black nuff said. It looked a tad brown coming from the bottle though. A nice dark tan head graced the top forever leaving lace patterns.  S- Quite different for an RIS as this is more on the fruity kick. I really can't get any distinct flavors, more like a fruit basket with different ripe varieties. This is backed by some roast plus coffee/chocolate aromas.  T- Dark fruits and chocolate with some coffee as well. The usual blast of roasted malts so common with this style. sweet sugars and some alcohol seeps through. Not getting much hops but they could of faded(not sure the date of this bottle)  M- A nice mouth on this one but a tad lighter than expeced for the style. I would say this is medium bodied. This is lacking a bit of carbonation but oh well. Alcohol comes through just slightly with some dryness.  D- Complex enough for an RIS but the low abv makes it a bit more drinkable than other high abv offerings in the style. Good enough for future visits on cold winter nights as this warms well.  Another winner by sam smith.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,McStagger,4.3,"Mmm...imperial.  A: Poured into an o-fficial Samuel Smith pint glass...Pours black. Well, not quite black. Just a really dark and really opaque brown. Like Diet Coke syrup. Not much light getting through there. Head is nice, about two fingers worth. Retention is medium-high. Nice.  S: Nose has dark chocolate, espresso, evergreen and lemon rind notes all throughout.  T: Dark roasted sugars intermingled with small nuances of citric/hop bitterness invade the palate from the onset. These notes are followed by a very dark fruit in the middle palate. Almost reminds me of extremely old port. This transitions well into the familiar coffee and smoke at the finish. Smoke definitely finishes this one off. The alcohol is nowhere near as noticeable in this as it is in many imperial stouts. Seems to balance it out a bit more.  M: For me, this is where Samuel Smith really shines. I have yet to consume a Sam Smith beer that has either been too heavy or too light for its respective style. This beer is no exception. Silky and smooth without being heavy or ponderous, this beer has an excellent body and structure.  D: This is probably the easiest drinking Imperial Stout I've ever had. While still not a session brew, this beer's comparatively low alcohol makes it a possibility to have more than one or two.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Not much head retention, or this would have been a 5.  Smells of dried dark fruits and chocolate. Not nearly as much coffee and roast in the nose as many imperial stouts, and that's not a bad thing.  Taste follows the nose, except the roast becomes more prominent in the finish. Dark fruits (raisins, plums), chocolate, coffee. Very rich and smooth.  One thing I love about this stout is that the alcohol isn't so assertive. Some Russian Imperial Stouts, Stone's in particular, scared me off by being overly boozy.

Frothy two-finger head with nice retention and lacing.  Smell: smells of dark fruits, brown sugar sweetness,raisins, toffee, caramel, and rum. Surprisingly little coffee or roastedness.  Taste: strong sweetness and fruit - toffee, plums, and raisins. Much fruitier than i prefer in a RIS. Too much fruit and not enough roast for my palatte. Alcohol well-hidden.  Mouthfeel: excellent. Perfect carbonation, medium/heavy body, and smooth creamy finish.  Drinkability: very smooth going down. This is an easy drinker, especially at 7%.

Malty start, strong alcohol taste in the finish.  D: Great drinkability. This is best savored though.  Solid appearance, nice complexity in the nose.

So this beer was around 5 bucks for a pint at kappys and is at 7.0%.  So I popped the cap off which is topped in a foil wrapper. Poured this beer into my Winter Bourbon Cask Ale glass and looked for anykind of tint of color but could only find black. Very black beer with a great mocha coffee colored head.  Taking a wiff of this beer i'm pretty sure its going to be some treat. A malty chocolate aroma with a fruity plum and light hop presense makes a great smelling beer.  This beer has a great offering of flavor. Very malty chocolate tone with hints of coffee. I taste some plums and raisens, maybe a bitter hop added to the mix?

A: Pours a deep brown, edging on the brink of black with a medium tan colored head about an inch and a half thick, quite tight. Huge chunks of lacing all around. Recedes to a film.  S: Some definite chocolate and a very distinguishable Samuel Smith scent, it must be their yeast that produces the same characteristic in almost every beer I've had from their, and the only thing I can liken it to is ""pub"", somewhat musty, a few earthy English hops are lingering in the back somewhere.  T: Smoky roasted malts, chocolate, the same ""pub"" taste as from the nose, a bit of chocolate, surprisingly bitter, although its a ""dirty"" bitter, more so from the burnt malt. A definite coffee presence. Nice citrus there too, but not really a hop citrus. Hop character is piney, and subdued. Blended nicely into the background. Almost a red apple flavor, Belgian dark ale character. And even a few hints of lighter Irish whiskey. A lot going on here, and a good example of the beginnings of the style, but really nothing too fantastic.  M: A little thin, quite highly carbonated, a little warm on the alcohol end as well.  D: If persuaded to, I could drink another pint of this. It isn't bad by any means, but its more of a one and done type of beer. An excellent glimpse into the past of the Imperial Stout.

There are brewery's that focus a lot of time and energy aging and putting in the finest ingredients. I am starting to think that year around Imperial Stouts should be given a seasonal treatment, because that is the way it is meant to be.  The appearance is really dark, but held up to the light has dark amber edges. The head comes up nice, but leaves just as fast. The thickness or consistency of the brew is like darkened water. I am used to brews that pour like motor oil, not like water out of a faucet.  The taste was good but kind of bland. There are no overwhelming flavors, just subtle little ones. This is the second one that I have had and overall just really okay. The drinkability of it is good, which I can give a high score because more RIS are not drinkable at all. The mouthfeel is okay, but both times I got a small hint of something sour. Overall just another average RIS that will not bring back any fond memories.

The head is mocha brown and is easily two and half fingers deep. It was very slow to recede and left an impressive coat of lace lining the glass.  Smell: The nose is fairly straight forward. It's good, but not as deep or complex as others in the style. It's very sweet smelling. Lots of chocolate malt. There's a little roasted malt, as well, but it's not as strong as its chocolate counterpart. Smells like a little roasted coffee's present. It's buried in the malt, but it's there. A little brown sugar and licorice emerge late.  Taste: Sweet chocolate malts are the predominant flavor. Roasted malts blend well, but clearly are secondary to the strong chocolate flavor. It has a nice coffee/espresso flavor that's stronger here than on the nose. A little brown sugar and molasses are noted, but they're not very strong. No alcohol is noted. At 7%, it's not as high as others, but it is worth noting that the alcohol is blended well. Finishes sweet.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's on the lighter side medium bodied. It's a little too thin. Carbonation is a tad high and gets in the way a little. I've developed pretty high standards for feel as far as a RIS goes. This is not quite up to par. Drinkability is good, but not great. Relatively low abv for the style bolsters its case. But, there's a number of other beers of the style I prefer.  Samuel Smith's Russian Imperial is a classic, no doubt. Very solid beer all around (with the small exception of it's anorexic body). However, this is a style that has really been improved with pushing the envelope a little. This one does not quite measure up in that regard. Nonetheless, it is a legend that every BA needs to try.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,BretSikkink,4.1,"Oily black looking beer with some copper edging. Head is super thick and whipped, lasts for a long time. Eventually there's only a tiny ring of head and not much lace.  Strong aromas of dark fruit, molasses, and maybe some spices. Anise comes to mind, along with an almost cinnamon-like aroma. Really strong and nicely complex.  Palate is again strongly reminiscent of molasses with a large amount of dark fruit behind it. Tons of fig paste and raisin make up the middle of the taste, with a finish of licorice and coffee.  Decently full mouthfeel, quite viscous and oily. Acidic finish, leaves it a little dry. Good drinking for style, but still a little work to do.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,erz316,4.11,"A - pours completely opaque black with a khaki head. the head leaves some lacing, generally in large chunks, coming down rather quickly, and becoming more of a light tan colour  S - Alcohol and raisins come to the forefront, the syrupy-ness of the beer lending me to think I smell something reminescent of 'brayer rabbit molasses."" It is a dark sweetness that slowly crawls into the nose and complements the alcoholic raisin notes.  T - the most noticeable taste to my palate is that of a dark chocolate or a bitter bakers chocolate. The appearance of roasted malts becomes more noticeable, and adds coffee flavours; strongs ones, French or Colombian roasts. however, nothing is too authoritative in this beer, noting comes right out and immediately hits you in the mouth and says: ""oh wow. like, thats a ton of malt."" It all blends in smoothly together.  MF&D - not much carbonation, and is not as thick/syrupy as expected. A most enjoyable drink.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,morebeergood,3.33,"Ordered at bottle at the Washington Sq Tavern this past weekend for $6. Poured into a glass. Very dark black color. Slight brownish white head. Some lacing. Smell was a bit lacking. Taste was what I expected from a British RIS. Lots of roasted barley. Slight coffee overtones. The problem with this beer is that I have always found Sam Smith beers to be a bit in the thin side, and this does not help a RIS. Tasty beer, easy to drink, but a bit watery for a stout. Might be worth picking up for $3-4 in a beer store, but for $6 in a pub, not quite worth it.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,robbyc1,3.96,"Inky black, lovely tan head, dissipates slowly.  Nice malt, hints of chocolate, some hops, maybe a bit too cold, but alcohol comes through as well. Expected a bit more nose.  Deep malty chocolate notes, with a nice bitterness aftertaste, finiishes balanced, not overpowering just a nice roasty flavor, easy to go down. The abv is noticable as you drink it even though it's not as high as some RIS'.  Heavy with nice carbonation, well balanced.  Drinks well, easy and smooth, perfect serving size bottle as an imperial pint, more would be overdoing it. One to keep around for sure, not overpoweringly good, but nice.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

113,782,thegodfather2701,4.51,"Poured a twelve ounce bottle into my Samuel Smith's pint glass. It is very black with a nice two inch tan head. The nose is nothing overpowering, but it smells like chocolate and espresso. It tastes of rich dark chocolate and some espresso notes. There is also a touch of alcohol in the finish. The mouthfeel is amazing. It is thick, rich, and creamy almost like a milkshake. This has a very high drinkability and it is my favorite Russian Imperial Stout to date. Simply an amazing beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Brown and creamy head and a very beautiful lacing.  S: Coffee, chocolate, fruits.  T: Bitter chocolate, Raisins, prune. A magnificent finish. The alcohol is present (maybe because I know it's there), but the balance of the flavors with the alcohol is amazing.  M: Medium + bodied, medium carbonation. Very silky.  D: I am very impressed with this beer, it feels like Cognac in your mouth ( I meant it as a compliment). This Imperial Stout is very drinkable, and again, I think it could suit a lot of paladates. Balance!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Foxtrot,4.37,"Poured from bottle into pint glass.  A - This brew poured a very dark inky black with a big tan 3 finger head. Was also completely opaque with great head retention and lacing.  S - Unfortunately I had a slightly stuffy nose when I tried this, so I will try my best. Able to pick up lots of sweetness, that's for sure, with subtle notes of vanilla, chocolate, caramel and roasted malts.  T - Very malt heavy with flavors of dark fruits throughout with chocolate and toffee and a nice alcohol bit. It wasn't strong, but just enough to make you take another sip.  M - Loved the feel of this. Nice and viscous with a good clean finish.  D - Other than the above average ABV, this would unquestionably be a very good session beer.  This was my first foray into Russian Imperial Stouts, and I enjoyed it immensely.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Would have liked a more powerful smell.  Tastes of burnt malts with some coffee like taste. Somewhat low hops for an Imperial stout but the hops are still present. Very faint alcohol taste with a weird copper like after taste. Some dried fruit , maybe prunes is also tasted  Carbonation is too much. My mouth is almost numb from it. Slight creamy going down but not too heavy. Too bad the carbonation kind of screws up the mouth feel  Good quality beer. Carbonation held it back from being a great beer. Not too bitter, not too heavy, great price. More drinkable than alot of RIS. Would buy again",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,ssam,3.6,"A- pitch black color and a slightly dark, tan head. the head is very creamy and full.  S- in the scent there is a light coffee nuance along with a chocolaty smell-- it smells dark and deep, like its appearance  T-like in the scent, the coffee and chocolate stand out, they are almost overpowering. the aftertaste is a hoppy dryness.  M- mouthfeel is nice but the initial goodness is followed by flatness  D-the flavors are not countered by anything and make this, in my opinion, an unbalanced beer. if i were talking to sam smith, i would tell him to bump up the ABV to take some focus from the coffee chocolate. im not gonna run to the store for this anytime soon",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Fatduck,4.35,"At 7% is it really imperial? For Sam Smith, I guess its imperial.  Black, BLACK its freaking dark. Maybe a little red/brown at the bottom of the glass. This thing smells like malt and sugar and over ripe fruit. Taste fooking GREAT. I really like this beer, and after walking home in the windy -4F weather this is exactly what I needed. Its smooth and thick, looks a bit like motor oil. Taste sweet and the carbonation is perfect. Smooth and wonderful, creamy.

113,782,wheelinshirt,3,"Very cool looking 550 mL brown bottle, gold foil neck, purchased from the cooler at Capone's in Norristown for $6. No freshness date.  Pours rich and dark with a very light tan head, good size, creamy, slowly fades to a half-finger of foam and then just a collar by the end of the beer. Some lacing.  Smell is some very restrained alchohol and roasted malt, followed by some dark fruit which seems a bit unusual. I'm not sure what it is from, perhaps the yeast. This is followed and then dominated by a very unpleasant metallic odor that just wouldn't quit.  Taste is right on par with what you would expect from a RIS albeit a bit more subtle than normal. The roasted and burnt malt flavors, the fruity and booziness are all there but in proportion to the 7% ABV. Nice tasting, but not great. It is hard to get over the metallic nose but it doesn't really show up in the taste.  Mouthfeel is creamy, medium-heavy. Definately good for a stout. Not over or under carbonated and definately not too thick.  The drinkability really takes a hit from the metallic smell. It is a good beer, and at 7% would almost be sessionable for the stout lover, but I didn't enjoy the bottle enough to want another. If I see it somewhere and I know it is fresh I will probably give it another try. I may have gotten a bad bottle or just one that was past its time, but without a freshness date it is hard to say.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Jeffo,3.63,"Got this at De Bierkoning in Amsterdam.  From a bottle into a snifter.  APPEARANCE: Pours a relatively small but thick tan head that slowly dissipates into a healthy film. Head is pretty persistent and leaves a little lacing. Pitch black, pretty opaque, and very little carbonation is evident.  SMELL: Nose of burnt roasted malt, dark fruit, such as prunes, and a strong scent of black licorice. A bit of toffee and a hint of smokiness is also evident. Not bad.  TASTE: The initial taste is somewhat lacking, but some burnt and roasted malt flavor. Some black licorice, toffee, and dark fruit come out as it goes down. A roasted and bitter aftertaste, with a hint of chocolate, lingers nicely. A very complex taste for sure. On the downside, the alcohol is a bit too present for 7% and it flirts with that dried apple taste as it warms, which both held it back a little bit.  PALATE: Really shines here. A thicker body and medium carbonation. It goes down relatively creamy smooth and finishes very dry. Nice job here.  OVERALL: A good RIS for sure, but nothing spectacular and a little too boozy for 7%. I've had others in the style that I've enjoyed more, and I find this to be a slight disappointment considering how good their Oatmeal Stout and Porter are.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,yesyouam,4.48,"Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout is a brown black ale with a dense brown head that leaves nice lacing. The aroma is mostly of sweet malt, but it's also grassy and fruity. It smells so damn good! It has a medium-full body that's smooth and surprisingly crisp. The flavor is not overwhelming: sweet baked cookies, licorice and baking chocolate with a nice dark roastiness. It's a very pulled-together flavor. There is a lick of medicine in the finish. This is a mature Imperial Stout.

113,782,popery,3.23,"A thin, somewhat disappointing Russian Imperial Stout with a flavor profile that is not bad but merely average for the category. I was really expecting more from Samuel Smith with this one. The Taddy Porter knocked my socks off and their other beers are generally, at least, excellent values. This offering is basically RIS light. It lacks the depth and complexity of flavor that is nearly commonplace amongst its competition. The feel is somewhat watery and really fails to bring the required breadth. That said, it's not bad, at all. This beer's rating is very much a product of its place relative to some truly great competition, and with Old Rasputin sharing its shelf space, it's not even a very good value in this neck of the woods (I imagine other areas have better Imp Stouts and RIS's as well). At any rate, the beer pours opaquely black with good lacing from a nice beige-mocha head. There are notes of toasted malt and English, minerally hops. The flavors just aren't big and strong enough. Also, while I usually like a thick, viscous feel on my Imperial Stouts, this one manages it while still being too watery, which turns out to be not altogether pleasant. Not a bad beer but far below the heights of the style.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Guzzler78,3.92,"Pours a solid black. A Generous light brown head that fades quickly. A fair amount of lacing. Smell of chocolate, molasses, roasted malt/coffee.

113,782,magictrokini,4.25,"I have always been disappointed with beer from Samuel Smith, so I was reluctant to try this one. However, when I realized the bottle was clear, and the dark brown was the beer, I was intrigued. Aroma is tobacco and roasted chocolate malts. The taste is very, very good. Understated for an Imperial, this is dominated by roasted malts, with a solid backing of bittersweet chocolate and light coffee. Ended sweet. If only the rest of Samuel Smith's beers could be this good.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,TKempe,4.5,"The pitch black liquid contrasts boldly with a rather big brown head that develops into an attractive creamy layer.  The nose unites a pudding-like fruity sweetness with a thorough malt profile that resembles both dark chocolate and roasted coffee beans. A little bit of hops and alcohol add depth. A smell that at times seems just a bit too much on the sugary side, but simply great nonetheless.  The taste is just as rich as the nose but offers a bit more since it has a greater movement to it. A fruity and chocolatey start develops a salty characteristic, after which a beautiful finish creeps up that is very dry and bitter and has a stunning roasted quality and a little bit of hoppiness shining through. The alcohol makes itself felt shortly after. A big taste with a true beginning and ending.  A body of about medium; mouthfeel is creamy and a little bit sticky.  A very impressive brew, great to sip from in the evening.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,EatsTacos,4.58,"This stout is black, and is darker and closer to a true black color than many stouts. The head is chunky and creamy and brown. The lacing is great.  The smell is burnt and roasted malt firstly. There is a hop character present. Black licorice, raisins, prunes, figs are part of the fruityness of the nose.  The taste is as complex as much as it is balanced. The maltiness is sweet and chocolately with caramel malt present. The taste is a lot of black licorice and burnt flavours. The finish is very dry with coffee and expresso aftertastes. There's a very burnt malt grainy flavour all the way through. Really, really good.  The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, a pretty thick body and a low to medium carbonation is perfect for the style.  The bottom line is this beer is damn good.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

To me this was too boozy  A - Pours a dark black with a brownish tinged foam. 1 1/2 fingered head which dissapates to a covered top and some mild lacing around the glass  S - Wow - I was immediately hit by the alcohol smell. I let the beer warm, and it certainly took on a rich chocolate scent, but the alcohol is right up front.  T - A rich chocolate/cocoa flavor is right upfront and the boozy taste is never too far behind. The roasted malt sits in the back and the alcohol certainly warms the throat and chest as it goes down. Again - the alcohol was too dominant for my taste, but the beer is a higher ABV, so it should be expected  M - Rich medium bodied beer.  D - I honestly cant say I would have more than one, and I would not buy this again. The alcohol flavor was just to upfront, and as strong as the chocolate was, it was not enough. I guess I must like the 5-6 ABV range, this just took something away from the beer for me.

Taste: Roasted barley grains with touches of unsweetened chocolate and caramel with an earthy, soy sauce-esque taste running through the flavor. Hint of licorice and ripe red apples. Bits of sweetness pick up here and there. Splash of spiced prune juice. Very, very distant buttery hint. Small hints of yeast and alcohol. Finishes fruity, with a very slight metallic hint creeping into the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. Slight, oat-esque creaminess to the mouthfeel.

The malts overwhelm, and the lack of hops creates a sour rather than bitter taste. The yeast and malts make this taste of sourdough bread. There is a slight taste of chocolate on the back end that helps clear out the taste of dough. A change of pace as far as stouts go, and not altogether bad.

113,782,Bibliophilist,3.76,"Poured a dark -- but not too dark -- brown into my glass; opaque, though, like one expects a good imperial stout to be.  Smell is indicative of its somewhat light (for the type) alcohol content. A certain sweetness.  Possesses some of the good standard imperial stout flavors (chocolate and coffee inevitably come to mind), but has an unusual though not displeasing sweetness underneath it. Almost floral, but crisp.  Mouthfeel is relative: heavy for beer in general, perhaps light for this type. Not as overwhelming as some imperial stouts. The lighter alcohol content shows itself here; depends on one's preferences in that regard.  Very drinkable. It would be quite easy to down one of these in no time; much harder to sip slowly than some imperials. On the other hand, it is this latter quality that I enjoy about imperial stout, so I'm a little torn.  On a critical note, I was less than impressed with the aftertaste.

The aroma is a mild charcoal coffee blend, fairly bitter on the coffee side. The first taste brings out a sweet orange overtone on the charcoal base. Very nice on the taste buds. I pick up some gin-like qualities in the mild alcohol presence. As it warms I pick up more of a chocolate malt in the sweetness. It's quite drinkable for this style, midland body feel. Boy this goes good with cheese and hot pepper rings. I don't know that much more description is necessary, it's very solid, and not exactly like every other stout out there.

RIS is a style I'm not at all fond of, that was until I had Sam Smith's version of it and ... wow! This is an amazing beer. If they can sell me on a style that I had heretofore not liked, they are clearly doing something right.  The beer pours a thick ruby black color almost impenetrable to light. The beer has a luscious creamy brown head that laces and retains. The nose on this beer is just maximally complex. Chocolates, coffee, mocha, caramel, molasses, sweet malts, and brown sugar. The taste is even more complicated. There are waves of flavor coming over the palate. There is a strong mocha, cocoa chocolatey flavor first. There are liqueur flavors popping through, lots of warming alchol, raisin and raspberry in the deep recesses. There are sweet malts, caramels, molasses flavors, and some spices. The mouthfeel is very creamy but subtantial. The aftertaste has warming alcohol notes, and leaves a dark cherry chocolate residue. There is just a touch more ABV in the finish than I would have perferred. But, this beer is truly amazing. Its complexity is a pleasure to experience, and I may never speak ill of a RIS again.

113,782,schellsbeer,2.32,"I keep saying, nobody has anything over the American Micro Breweries and how they brew Stouts and Porters.  Who cares if this is one of the oldest recipes? Who cares if it is made by Samuel Smith?  Who cares...Who cares...Who Cares...???  Once again, I am greeted by a European Stout Beer that has some hidden FUNK taste that doesn't belong in a good beer. I really don't know how all of the positive reviewers can't taste this one ingredient in many of the European Stouts and Porters and like it. To me, this tastes too much like a Baltic Porter or Stout just because of that funky taste I get.  I know that is one of the RIS's that everyone is suppose to love, but I don't. First bottle and the last.  Give me a Surly, Bells, Schells, Summit, Left Hand, or Sierra Nevada any day.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,katan,3.44,"12 oz bottle - no date  A - Another dark as night RIS. I wish I could come up with more adjectives for this, but I can't. Motor oil, dark, thick etc. Head quick light and left only a small film.  S - Not a strong nose - just a light amount of chocolate and malts. I'm guessing there is a light yeast note in there as well - odd for the style.  T - Starts off smooth and sweet. Nice combination of chocolate and other roasted malts. Perhaps some coffee like acidity in there. Finishes with some bitterness and some odd almost oxidation bite. Almost salty bite at the end, like a coffee sitting in the pot for far too long - not sure I like it.  M - Moderate body for the style - not overly thick but not watery either. Perhaps hard to judge this against its extremely loaded American RIS cousins, but it seems lighter than my expecations.  D - Moderate abv and easy drinking makes this one of the few more drinkable RIS beers I know.  I can tell where the style came from, but I also now know that I prefer our over the top American RIS offerings.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,corby112,3.28,"Serving type: bottle.  Pours a dark black color with a thick coffee-colored head. Aroma of malty chocolate, roasted coffee and toast. Flavor is similar to aroma with lots of roasted chocolate maltiness, caramel, coffe, toffe and oatmeal. A bit watered down though with a dry finish.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,mesperon,4.73,"Pours out a beautiful deep dark brown with a think, dense tan head that leaves a little bubbly lace. The aroma is full of roasted malt, with just a hint of burnt carbon. Has an edge of caramel, toffee, and a mellow sweet fruit, like red apple or pear.  The mouthfeel is very full, but not syrupy. Carbonation is moderate.  The initial taste is of deep roasted malt, that develops into a coffee and dark bitter chocolate. There's an edge of sweet caramel, and again the mellow, sweet fruit. Not at all overpowering. The finish leaves the bitter, woodsy coffee and chocolate on the palate forever.  This has to be the most balanced stout that I've ever tasted. The bitterness is bold, and enjoyable, and lasts long on the finish, but it does not overpower the palate. It is very easy drinking, almost sessionable. The alcohol is evident and warming, but not prominent. This beer could really sneak up on you and lay you out.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

113,782,TLove,4.12,"The beer was surprisingly dry and devoid of spiciness, though the depth and smoothness of finish really brought a lot of flavor unto itself. This is not by any means the typical imperial stout.  The appearance is a dark brown with a bit of an amber hue. The smell is reminiscent of a mixture between a bitter and a irish dry stout, but the taste and mouthfeel point to the dryness of the stout as the dominant characteristic of the beer. The dryness also keys into the light chocolate overtones, with a light nuttyness and an even less noticeable 7% ABV. The subtlety of the characteristics of this beer prompts the question - must a beer with a stronger ABV render the alcohol a prominent taste component of the beer? I would argue that this is not necessarily so. If you agree, feel free to give sam smith's imperial stout a try.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,CanuckRover,4.45,"Looks black, but catch the right angle and you can see some very dark ruby highlights. Huge billowy coffee-brown head settles fairly quickly to a beige film. Clingy lacings.  Aroma has a nice combination of coffee bitterness and boozy dark fruit.  Nice roasted coffee-like bitterness with a touch of really dry dark chocolate. Nice backbone of dark fruit, prunes. Molasses sweetness. Hops give a little bit of a metallic bite. Finish is slightly bitter, coats the mouth. Alcohol is nice and managable.  Little bit on the thin side, but carbonation is nice.  A gold-standard for the style certainly.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Pretty costy, but still would drink this again",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,taylorhamrick,4.33,"Pours out black with a hint of red. Creates an enormous head with good lacing as you drink. The smell has a faint roasted character to it, some deep sweet, chocolatey smells, but not a whole lot to speak of. This is easily my favorite style of beer, it wasn't the first I had, but I tasted this a long time ago, and am now revisiting it and loving it just as much. Smoth, with a great roasted taste, hiding the alcohol the way I prefer. The sweetness is really great, without being cloying. I have a feeling that this should be the taste that every other person making an RIS should strive for. The fact that the alcohol isn't huge and the hops aren't overpowering means that you can drink this one fresh and not be overpowered a challenged to wits end (not that it's particularly a bad thing when you are), but it's difficult not to enjoy this beer. Really smooth, and drinks fairly quickly for an imperial stout. An old recipe and one that should be continued. It's also worth noting that this beer is generally a bit cheaper than the other members of this style, which is always a plus.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

113,782,Aichelberger,4.4,"A Samuel Smith's classic and really earns the name of this exceptional brewery. Deep black brown in the glass with a light brown head that foamed quickly and then settled to lace the glass throughout. Rich roasted malt in the nose and in the initial taste, with a rich nutty taste and somewhat unique (and welcome) hint of bitterness (hops?) in the aftertaste that helps drinkability. The slightly higher ABV renders the beer somewhat less drinkable than others, but the whole glass went down smoothly with no perceptible alcohol taste. Really well done.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,dojobrewco,3.16,Nice dark pour with a roasted aroma. Not as full bodied as I had thought it would be however very drinkable.

Plum, chocolate, a little bit of hops in the mix to balance things out a roasted flavor with a clean finish.  Not as thick as I would have hoped but the beautiful creamy aftertaste unique to all the Sam Smith beers I have had is present and wonderful.

I had this beer from a 12 oz bottle poured into a mug (at a bar), then the same but poured into a tulip glass. A: Excellent dark color, nice foam but not a long lasting head.  S: Just magical, even a bit wine like (though here maybe I'm just reacting to the alcohol content?), with a fruity aroma (not wine cooler fruity, just not a bitter coffee like aroma).  T: Rich grains and some subtle cocoa and chocolate flavors.  M: Rich to the tongue and full in the mouth. It's very smooth. I savored several mouthfuls; the carbonation is a bit on the low side.  D: This is a costlier beer, but I'd drink several if I could, and I hope to get some more on occasion. Its ABV is not overwhelming, and it's definitely flavorful.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Ralphus,4.22,"Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout is a bit low in alcohol content for an imperial but given that is Sam Smith's strongest beer we won't hold it against them. And with good reason, for their brew is excellent in many ways.  It pours a dark midnight black with a tan head that recedes to a reasonable ring of foam. There's no lacing to speak of but that shouldn't stop you from enjoying this one. Your nose will find much fruit and a very rich coffee background. A cold mouth initially finds a strong soya flavour but with each passing gulp it is forgotten in favour of wonderful milk chocolate and an earthy coffee taste combined with dark fruit. A well balanced hop bite finishes things off nicely. This is just tasty through and through and has many layers to examine.  Mouthfeel is silky smooth cream with just the right amount of carbonation. Do yourself a favour and grab this one if you see it in the stores.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Some spotty lacing is left on the glass.  Great malty aroma of roasted malt, caramel, and cherries. Has some earthy qualities as well. A little alcohol lifts off the surface and fills the nose on occasion. Exceptional is the perfect descriptor.  Full on malty greatness in the flavor. Almost like a graham cracker with cherries and caramel on top. Add in a little alcohol warmth on the finish.  The body is not as big and chewy as most American conterparts. Lively carbonation borders on harshness.

113,782,biegaman,4.27,"A lustrous, inky black facade that twinkles with temperate glints of rustic red. Close inspection to the light proves shadowed clarity possible and thus reveals the beer to not be opaque after all. Its hazelnut stained head has sunk in the center but still strongly envelops the outsides. Not withstanding thin prints of lace, I demand something a little darker.  Its bouquet brims with copious amounts of blackstrap molasses. It's an almost sedative smell that combines browned sugar with hints of bittersweet chocolate (leaning to the sweet side). Alongside a minor amount of black licorice it would seem a very liberal amount of stale, cold coffee was blended into the mix as well.  The taste has a phenomenal presence of soured berries and dark fruit thrown into the prevalent flavours of cold coffee and blackstrap molasses. The usual cast of heavy-roast espresso and rich, gooey chocolate are considerably understated; a stale black coffee and handful of cocoa beans would be far more accurate descriptors.  The roast is present but fails to linger in either bitterness or aftertaste. The texture has an unexpected creamy smoothness and washes over the palate with dove-like delicacy. The modest 7% alcohol is rightfully discreet and plays no determinant for drinkability. These factors together create for an unusually mild imperial stout.  Many of the great Imperial Stouts are considered such because of their heavy, rich and decadent profiles. Although robust, the Sam Smith is certainly far more modest than has become commonplace with the style. Still, it is a classic rendition of a more traditional, old-world example and should appreciated as such (...which is a very easy thing to do!)",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,matt7215,3.98,"550ml bottle from the LCBO  Pours opaque black with a mid-sized tan head.  The aroma is all about roasted malts. Chocolate, coffee, dark fruits, toffee. Quite a complex aroma that really comes out if you take the time to fully appreciate it.  The flavour is similar to the aroma. Layers of flavours, all malt driven, subtle complexity that takes some time to fully develope.  The mouthfeel is a touch thin especially given that this is an Imperial Stout.  Very drinkable and dare a say sessionable Imperial Stout. What it lacks in big, bad-assed boldness it makes up for in well crafted drinkability.  I nice addition to the LCBO line-up.

Smell was pretty good as well. Malty, semi sweet chocolate, dark fruit and vanilla.  Taste and mouthfeel combination was disappointing. The malt, chocolate and dark fruit were there, but the taste was swallowed up by a thin wine-like alcohol taste and bitter finish. I was expecting a rich taste to coat the tongue and taste buds, like Victory Storm King, Expedition Stout or Ten Fidy. Not here.  Mouthfeel was a bit thin and too much alcohol. Drinkability was not bad, but not a memorable experience either.  There are better RIS out there.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

T: Sour hops up front give way to milky-sweet and creamy malts. Light, bitter chocolate. Bitter and roasted grain finish. Dark fruit is tasted throughout. M: Full bodied, yet feels light in the mouth. Coats nicely, and has very nice carbonation that sparkles more than it bites. Creamy and smooth, with a touch of dryness on the finish.

113,782,sgoodship,4.17,"This is one of my favorite beer labels. It couldn't look more Russian Imperial and combined with the classic and proud looking Sam Smith's bottle, it is just darned handsome.  A: Not hard to get a head on this brew from a 1pt 2.7fl.oz. bottle. Dark brown almost black liquid. Head is nice 2 finger that is coffee stained and fluffy. Little amount of carbonation prickling under the head. A nice small head stays throughout the drink with some large spots sticking to the glass.  S: Simple but classic. A little fruit (maybe prune), coffee and caramel malt - some slight hoppiness.  T: Just as the smell promises. The aftertaste is sometimes a little bready and the hop sourness kicks in quickly and heavily at first but subtler toward the end of the drink.  M: Medium bodied. Round and creamy. Low carbonation.  D: Initially, I felt like the flavor could be have been bolder and hold longer. It felt a little weak at times. I also felt like the aftertaste could be less acidic. Having said that, as the drink progressed, both points were lessened because the beer settled and felt like a good, well balanced brew.

Maybe the head coloring is playing tricks with my tastebuds, but a slight cherry scent is present: like a cordial cherry chocolate.  T: Strong and malty at first but then gets increasingly chocolatey: dark, dark chocolate with some fruity undertones.  MF: At first, a bit thick for my liking... But then quite smooth as drinking continues and the beer warms a bit.  D: One of the first craft beers that I've had that I might make a constant in the collection.

113,782,bobsy,4.45,"Practically midnight black pour with a beast of a tan head that settled to a finger of cap, and forgot to lace. Chocolate and coffee aromas are divine, and carefully balanced, pulling back from the all out aroma assault of some imperial stouts. Full on milk chocolate in the flavour swiftly followed up by a coffee with extra cream, along with some vanilla and dark fruit. This is really helped by the full creamy body, which accentuates the smoothness of the chocolate and coffee flavours.  This has vaulted into my favourite imperial stouts, in part because there seems to be a lot that isn't imperial about it. The ABV is far more restrained and makes it easy to drink at the pace of a regular beer, while the alcohol heat is also lacking. The flavours are also in a delightfully harmony, and its far less aggressive and boozy than other examples.

Some dry vanilla bean, cocoa and a beautiful soft roasted lacing. Overall the flavor was very rich, sweet and flavorful.  M: smooth, and velvety with a brisk carbonation. The body was medium full.

113,782,CrellMoset,4.3,"Bottle from Smokerise bottle shop, Lilburn, GA. Poured into a chalice.  Appearance: Pours a surprisingly light brownish-black, with a fast-fading and fizzy and chocolate-colored head. Lacing is non-existent. Not nearly as thick or sticky as I'm used to, but for a 7% RIS, it's probably about what you'd expect. Looking back on it now, it is pretty attractive in its hues, the way the reds dance around the browns which merge with the blacks, even if it's not very ""active"" looking.  Aroma: Light fruits, some slightly darker fruits, and plenty of milky, creamy maltiness. Sugary coffee, sweet chocolate, raisins ... very nice.  Taste: A very light and fruity RIS. Pears and prunes are initially the prominent note, making you question whether this is really an RIS at all ... but then they slowly fade into stronger and toasty but still well-balanced malts. Baker's chocolate, light, herbal coffee, huge, sweet raisins, and other dark fruits dominate the malt overtones. There're a few grassy, herbal hop notes as well that meld well with the roasty astringencies in the malt profile and a nice dash of smoke in the finish.  Mouthfeel: Light and a bit uneven, but it's getting better as things warm. It's medium-to-full bodied, and of a very nice, medium thickness. Regardless, it's smooth, a little fluffy, and very nicely carbonated - not too flat, and not expressively over the top.  Drinkability: This is not your typical American RIS, nor should it be I suppose. The abv% is wonderfully low for the style, making this one far more drinkable than many of its American cousins, too. Regardless, it's very nice to find a flavorful, drinkable, light, and fruity RIS, and the price was definitely right on this one - 550 mL for $3.99 is one you can't really beat.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Aroma - rich and vinous, almost like a red wine with roasted malts. Maybe some chocolate but mostly cherries and other dark fruits.  Flavor - roasty and sweet with an unusual taste of red wine or port, almost like it was aged in a wine barrel. The port-like sweetness is well balanced with some coffee bitterness and dark chocolate on the finish.  Mouthfeel - very smooth almost creamy with soft carbonation. This beer has a nice mouth-coating affect and the body is medium, not too heavy.  Drinkability - yes, but in a nice slow, sit by the fire kind of way.

The scent is fruity with some prunes and maybe raisins with some hints of milk chocolate and coffee. This beer is a goddamn knockout in the taste department. It starts off with some roasted chocolately sweet malts that cut by some slight coffee bitterness that hits at about the same time as some slightly-floral hops. Towards the end there is some prune and almost rum flavor that gives way to some smokiness in the end that almost reminds me of smoking a cigar. A very complex and enjoyable brew. The mouthfeel is pleasantly thick and almost creamy, with enough carbonation to keep it light. This beer is more drinkable than most porters, probably due to keeping the alcohol content down a little bit.

The smell, however, was faint and I had a hard time discerning it after awhile. T: The taste reminded me of the very initial taste of Rochefort 10 (although after this beginning they are very different). Tastes of dark fruits, maybe figs, and a caramel malt flavor. M: Silky feel that goes down smooth. D: Not as strong abv as I'd expect from an imperial stout, but it nevertheless hides it and tastes great.

Pours an opaque deep black color that produces a 3 finger brown head when poured aggressively. The head reatins poorly and leaves minimal lacing along the glass  S: Burnt malts, molasses (quite present), caramel, coffee, toffee, chocolate, and dark fruits comprise the nose. I personally do not notice any hops in this one. Very robust nose though, a good indicator of whats to come.  T: The flavor profile is INCREDIBLE! I have never tasted a RIS similar to this. Although there is no hop character to balance this big guy, the malt character stands alone. Molasses, chocolate, caramel, burnt malts, coffee and dark fruit comprise the flavor profile. Very nice.  D/MF: The body is full, rich, thick, and silky. The aftertaste is one of sweet malts and dark fruit. Leaves the mouth a little sticky, but that can be expected from a beer of this stature.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,dfitch81,4.56,"Entertaining Victorian-style label proclaims Samuel Smith's to be ""Contractors to Her Majesty's Forcces"" - very appropriate for an IMPERIAL stout! Pours a deep, dark brown - bordering on black - with two fingers of chocolately brown head. Scent of sweet coffee and roasted barley greets the nose as you lift the glass for the first sip. Taste is first of coffee and dark chocolate, with hops in the background. Hop flavor becomes somewhat more pronounced later in the taste before giving over to a finish of sweet cream. Alcohol is rather light for an imperial stout, and flavors are perhaps less pronounced than in other examples of the style. However, the end result is a serious stout with interesting and enjoyable complexities that complement one another instead of battling to dominate your palate. Definitely recommended.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,barknee,3.91,"Pours a virtually opaque espresso brown with a textbook mocha colored head. Nose of roasted cocoa beans, vanillin, egg yolk, custard and English toffee predominate. Velvety smooth in the mouth, with massive flavors of bittersweet dark chocolate, along with generous hop bittering keep things in check here from the rich malting and generous flavors. Mid-weight in texture, this brew has a wonderful presence in the mouth; is well balanced and highly drinkable. This is a slightly more tame Imperial for the rest of us.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,dnichols,4.12,"A: It poured a shiny bright black body reminiscent of black ink. It had a dark chocolaty head that was robust and long lasing. It had leggy and long lacing.  S: It had the aroma of thick espresso with hints of caramel and dark fruits.  T: It had a decent balance between the dark roasted malts, dark sugars and molasses, and dark fruits. There was a dry bitter bite that complements the sweet flavors.  M: It was medium bodied with modest carbonation. It was smooth and finished dry with a slight bitter aftertaste.  D: It was a nice RIS but a bit flat and dry compared to others. The low ABV and medium body, however, makes this more of a candidate for multiple drinks in a single session then others in this style.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,marcpal,3.81,"Was on hiatus from Sam Smith after their Winter Welcome last year, which I found hideous. However, lately, Ive tried some of their others and are quite good.  Foiled bottle poured into a pint glass.  A: Jet black with a sandy brown foamy head.  S: Coffee, licorice, and more so fennel spices. The toasted flavors are terrific but I can do with out that spicy twing.  T: Coffee and chocolate predominantly. Some fennel which I would rather not be there but its more through the nose. Could really go with some more chocolate malts and less of the licorice.  M: The thinnest, lightest imperial I can remember, but the intensity doesnt have to be overpowering. Some creaminess when warmed down.  D: High ratings and easy as hell to drink. For the style, one you can have a few of and not feel completely grogged out. Not bad and worth the effot.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Wetpaperbag,3.3,"A- Nice dark brown in color, almost black. The tan head is very tightly formed with an assortment of small and large bubbles.  S- Wonderful smells of chocolate, anise, and even bourbon. I'm also getting a cherry taste as well, I would venture a guess as to a cherry cordial smell.  T- The taste is very heavy on the burnt/roasted malts, very bitter. It almost seems like they swirled a stick of charcoal though this before bottling. The chocolate taste isn't quite as there as I was hoping for though the impressions I got from the smell.  M- The mouthfeel is good, not great, I was hoping for something a little thicker, this is a bit on the thin side of an RIS.  D- Easy to drink, not too happy with the overly burnt taste though.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,AMo,4.38,"Samual Smith's Imperial Stout pours a dense opaque black with a short stiff tan head. The smell is good and moderately strong of sweet chocolate and roasted malts. Taste is absolutely fantastic from the get go. It's very robust of chocolate and malt. Mouthfeel is silky smooth with a moderate abount of tightly wound carbonation. This tighness gives the liquid an ultimate dense like feel. Drinkability is great from the start and finishes progressively smoother lightening up a bit from its initial density. Overall a this is a great imperial stout, great buy for the price and taste. A real winner of a brew from Samual Smith's.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,ThreeWiseMen,3.65,"Appearance: Pours a clean, pitch black with giant, brown creamy head.  Smell: Smells very meaty. Also getting whiffs of milk chocolate. Definitely an original smell. Kind of reminds us of Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbier Urbock. Meaty and sweet, with a spicy kick. Really tough to describe...  Taste: Smokey and meaty (we argued about which of these two flavors is more predominant), milk chocolate, mocha, burnt malts. Dry, mocha-flavored aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Thick body, though not really syrupy. Almost no carbonation and a very dry finish.  Drinkability: Kind of a weird flavor, but not necessarily bad. Not hard to drink at all, but this one had kind of a novelty feel to it. Will probably try again in the future.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,glid02,4.38,"Got this from Green's in Atlanta.  Pours a black color that has a dark brown fringe when held up to the light. Head is about one-finger of milk chocolate colored foam. Head recedes slowly until there are patches with different thicknesses. There's a thick ring around the glass throughout. Really good looking beer.  Smells good. Very biscuity with a tiny amount of roasted aroma while it's cold. As it warms there are more and more dark fruit aromas.  Tastes great. A biscuity malt is most prevalent in the beginning, with the dark fruit taste taking over as the beer warms. As the fruit taste becomes more apparent so too does a tinge of sourness. There's a solid bitter finish throughout. Not even the slightest hint of alcohol.  Mouthfeel is good. Thickness is great with a good grainy carbonation. Goes down very smoothly.  Drinkability is up there. This does not taste like 7%. I think it's a bit more drinkable when it's colder, the biscuit flavors are smoother than the dark fruits.  Overall this is a great deal. It's not as robust as other RIS's - it's all about the subtlety, but everything works perfectly together. Definitely worth a try.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

113,782,prosper,4.55,"based on the appearance and smell, I was expecting a good, but hardly exceptional stout. Then I drank some. Wow. This beer grabs your attention immediately and holds on!  There's an immediate, sharp carbonation bite on the tongue, accented by fruity late-hops and big almost belgian esters. The next think you notice is the creamy chocolatey-smooth texture and the usual (but subdued) accompaniment of roasted grain flavours, and a nice grainy bitterness without any astringency. You'll notice lots of fruit notes; cherry, apple, etc. It finishes with dark grainy bitterness and hops, with a slight alcohol warmth. This is an absolutely stunning stout. I'll buy more of these.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Goliath,3.88,"Pours black, and completely opaque. A half inch light brown head forms on top and lingers with good retention.  The aroma is alright, but nothing too special. Some darker malts, with a bit of fruit, and slightly floral.  Taste is ok. Dark malts give some burnt flavors, burnt coffee being the dominant. A bit of dark sweet fruit follows.  Mouthfeel is kind of thin for a RIS, feels watery. Carbonation is fine.  Drinkability is moderate to high. Flavor is fine, and alcohol is easily manageable.

Mouthfeel: Smooth and rich as butter.  Drinkability: A very drinkable brew, but ought to be respected, delicious.

So with that being said this is a solid stout although my rating is likely lower than my overall enjoyment of this beer but I have to put it up against other Imperials. Aroma is enjoyable, very roasty and bitter. Good dark pour with an easily attainable head with little to no lacing. Mouthfeel is somewhat creamy and the finish is smoooth, but it's rather thin for an Impy. Impressive taste, roasted malts-a-plenty, some light coffee and chocolate.

Good coffee flavor, some sour notes.  Body is a little thin for a stout.  Sorry, don't know what else to say. I bought this because it was on the BA Top 100 and I expected more. It's not bad by any means but I expected KaPow! This is the same week that I had Stone IRS and Speedway Stout for the first time so maybe I have the bar set too high for this little guy.

113,782,AltBock,4.18,"Slender brown 12 oz. bottle with a classic white label on it. This classic label has the name of the beer in gold lettering, the brewery's symbol of a barrel with the established year on it, and some of the medals it won back in 1896 and 1930. Don't they have any recent medals laying around? The back label on contains the mandatory US information. Just below the gold foil that's over the cap is some kind of bottle code. Mine was bottle code SB06B1. I'm sure that's a code that the brewery can only understand.  Appearance: I poured this Samuel Smith's beer into a Maudite Snifter. What came out of this small bottle was a big black colored beer. It was an oil black, but it wasn't a oily black sludge of a beer. Great color! The head of foam was almost as nice. The initial head of foam was about 1 inch in height and was a mocha/light tan color. It had great retention that left behind a small mocha/tan film, foamy rings along the edge, and just a small amount of spots of lace around the glass. It was just a nice Imperial Stout appearance!  Smell: When I first popped the cap, I got this unique aroma that combined black cherries and a bale of hay. When the beer settled, the bale of hay was gone, but the black cherries still remained. Along with the black cherries, there was the smell of dark roasted coffee beans, dark roasted malts, a hint of dark chocolate, black berries, and then finishes up with a subtle scent of sweet caramel and bitter roasted hops. I noticed there were a few malted tea leaves hiding in here too, but those came and went as they pleased.  Taste: This Imperial Stout starts off dry and roasted with dark roasted malts, dry roasted coffee beans, a splash of bitter dark chocolate, and a touch of of dry roasted bitter hops. I thought that was the end of the taste, but that was only the beginning of the taste. After the hops, the taste goes sweet with sweet English toffee, sweet roasted malts, and some ripe black berries at the finish line. I thought the first half of the taste was good enough for this beer, but the sweet finish was the icing on the cake.  Mouthfeel: This Imperial Stout was more medium bodied than full bodied. The aftertaste was adark and roasted like it should be, but it wasn't as thick as I would have liked it to be. This dark roasted aftertaste contained dark roasted malts, a hint of roasted coffee beans, a touch of bitter dark chocolate, and a few crushed berries at the end. There was plenty of flavor, but it was lacking the punch.  Drinkability: This has to be one of or the very first Russian Imperial Stouts made available. Unless I'm mistaken and those award on the label from 1896 do not belong to this beer. If you like your R.I.S., then you should try one of the first ones made available.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

It was served to me way too cold but as it warmed other flavours came through such as the darker fruits and roasted malts. A bit complex in taste could pick up quite a bit.

Sweet gold or dark rum and dark fruits (mostly raisins with a little fig). Vanilla comes through quite clearly as well as molasses. Hints of brown sugar, caramel, and a mild spiciness are also noticeable.  T- Unfortunately not as good as its smell. The smell is so intense and the flavor seems to be a dumbed-down version of the smell. It reminds me of rum-raisin ice cream with the following flavors: rum, raisins, vanilla, and sweet cream. Molasses and caramel also make an appearance. A generous dose of malty flavor is also detected. The flavor is complex and good, but somewhat watered down.  M- A little thin for a RIS, but thick enough and moderately carbonated. Crisp finish with a lingering aftertaste.

The head settled into a nice, toffee-colored ring for the duration of the drink (this was, of course, after Armageddon had cometh).  Goodness, me! These are scents the gods dream of, man! Dark fruit scents mingle with those of lavender and coffee beans. There are hints of rum-like notes in there, too. Heavenly.  Fruity upfront, not too heavy - good consistency - with bits of chocolate and rum notes carrying through into the middle. Finishes with a warm, smoky espresso wave to help warm the throat and tummy.

In between the two is the molasses which gives this brew a firm beginning middle and end.  Mouth feel is good and chewy, just what I like from a dark beer.

Aromas of dark fruits, raisins, chocolate, coffee, molasses, cookie dough, and a bit of alcohol.  Flavors live up to the aroma. Coffee and chocolate dominate the flavor profile, while a fruity character emerges alongside it. It finishes kind of creamy almost like a milk stout with a certain smokiness to it as well. Very complex.  Mouthfeel is pretty heavy, yet still a bit thin I think. Doesn't detract much overall though. If anything it just raises the drinkability.

Im not gonna review this beer as i normally do, im gonna say it pours with all the same charecteristics of a stout and thats where it stops being typical, very rich/comnplex flavor that can only really be appreciated by drinking it, exceptionally smooth and creamy. I've heard it said that people would feel spoiled if they were allowed to drink something on a normal basis and its exacly how i feel about this.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,BamaBeerBuff,4.22,"A: Deep opaque black coloration with a thick creamy milk-chocolate colored head. Retention is fair, as the head settles to a thicker film over the top. Not a lot of lacing to speak of, but it's still solid.  S: Loads of molasses, dark fruits, bittersweet chocolate, and a spicy note from the alcohol.  T&M: Dark fruits with some floral hops initially followed by emergent bittersweet chocolate, roasted coffee, and some sort of spicy/sweet alcohol-esque flavor. Very rich, sweet, and complex. The body is full, but not quite full enough for my liking. The feel is creamy enough, but I still feel like a slightly fuller body would help things out quite a bit.  D: Another great beer from Samuel Smith's Brewery. This is actually rather drinkable for a RIS. The alcohol content is on the low side, and the body isn't like motor oil, making it easier to sip on.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Big sweet and roasted malts, plus some earthy hops that balance it nicely.  T: Yum! Again, sweet chocolate, bread, and coffee. Just what an Imperial Stout should taste like. It finishes slightly dry.  M&D: A little light for the style, I was expecting something a little more viscous. At 7% ABV, I could drink plenty of these, but it would be best served as a sipper after dinner. Very good example.

113,782,Strix,3.86,"Near opaque, with decent head.  Smells dark. Coffee, malts, roasted and burnt flavors. Smell is not strong though.  Flavors very heavy, but mild. Coffee and burnt flavors drag this down, and not much else in the mix. Even after warming up, the flavors are a bit muted for my taste.  Mouthfeel silky smooth, and was the highlight of this one for me.  I was not as impressed with this as I thought I might be. It was fairly heavy and flavors were muted. Still worth a try, but not among my favorites.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,clayrock81,4.18,"Notes: Paired this with some chocolate balls (seriously) and it was delicious. Poured into a pint glass and received a midnight black, thick brew which gave me a voluminous three-finger, tan head that quickly died to one-finger and left a lace ring. I can say the smell was good, but hard to pinpoint the smell. Malts cam through like coffee and maybe caramel and/or chocolate, there was some sweetness in the smell. A full-bodied beer that is very smooth, almost silky, and creamy. Even with a dry backbite that is the perfect finish, a tasty body with roasted, coffee and chocolate malts at the forefront of my taste buds. Didn't notice many hops, but there was a slight hop bite from the carbonation and something like dark fruit (black cherries) that was faintly in there. I will gladly throw this down with anyone and recommend this beer to my non-beer geek friends as that rare beer that is not expensive yet close to perfect.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

T: incredibly thick chocolatey approach, turn to toffe in the middle and heavily roasted malt in the back. incredibly crafted stout. M: smooth very lightly carbonated with an incredibly thick body.

Nose is of maple syrup, molasses, prunes and a slight burnt malt hints of black patent. This brew is a monster but balanced all at once, more molasses with coffee and bittersweet chocolate mingles with strong but flirting herbal hop tinges. Sweet malts blend with plums, raisins, and prunes. Slight leather note that finishes to a round sweet malt note that fades to a slight soy sauce and then back to herbal hops and yet again back to sweet malts. MAN, what a finish on this beer.

A full inch of tan head erupts from a fairly vigorous pour, great lacing, mostly black with some cola brown colour around the edge of the glass. Heavily roasted aroma of coffee and cocoa powder with some chocolate sweetness, black currant, prune, molasses, and a bit of briny saltiness.  Flavour starts off heavily herbal with anise and fennel coming right to the front, then that heavily roasted coffee bitterness that immediately gets set off by a lactic acidity that cleans the palate nicely. Not much in the way of sweetness, but what there is is demerara sugar mixed with a dark fruity note. This is a very well balanced Impy stout, mannered but very flavourful. Not overwhelming, just a great sipper. Carbonation is medium-low, and the palate dries well with the bitterness and acidity, begging for another sip.

113,782,BullCityB,3.68,"Poured into a goblet, Sam Smith's Imperial looks rather nice, with a deep near black color and a nicely tanned head. Retention isn't bad, but not great either.  The aroma is a little odd for the style. There's some sharp roasted malts, but also a spicy/yeasty smell that is quite strong compared to most stouts that I've had. I like it, but it's definitely not the norm. It could be more intense, as well.  The flavor opens up with a little sharp roastiness followed by a dried fruit character in the middle. The finish is odd, almost slightly metallic in addition to the requisite roast character. Spicy and yeasty as well. Oddly enough, this tastes slightly Belgian. Seriously! I kid you not! If not for the metallic overtones, I would have given it a four.  In the mouth, it's solid. The head lends a nice creaminess, though it dissipates too quickly. I could definitely have gone for a bigger body here, but for 7%, this is quite big.  Overall, this is a drinkable ale, but it's biggest defect is it's odd flavor combination. Don't get me wrong, its good, but at the same time, I feel it could be a lot better. To be honest, it tastes like it was fermented too hot and a few off flavors developed.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Sweetness is almost too overwhelming for me. Needs a little better balance with something more acidic. Has a crisp, clean aftertaste with alcohol warming on the way down. Has the feel of a British brew.  Overall this beer is pretty good. If you like the 'British taste' you will enjoy this beer.

113,782,acrawf6,4.2,"Pours out very black with no light coming through and a tan head.  Smell. Initially smells a bit cloying with malty sweetness. Almost reminds me as something between a dubbel and a eisbock. There is a potent sweetness to the aroma that isnt too appealing to me.  Taste. Flavor is much nicer than the aroma. Roasted and a touch of burnt malts come out nicely. There is a touch of a soy sauce flavor to it, but not nearly as much as some other RIS out there, and leaves the palate nicely. As it warms i get a bit of a fruity sweetness. Aftertaste has small sweet espresso flavor to it, which is nice.  Mouthfeel. Body is full. The style is often a bit raw from the amount of hops some breweries throw in...this one isnt hoppy, but i still get a bit of rawness to it. Carbonation is at a proper level.  Overall, a very solid stout. Flavors are potent, but not cloying or overbearing, yet still solid.

Fits the bill in appearance for the style, pitch black and impervious to direct light, only faint intermittent cola hue specks along the perimeter when done so. Thick creamy tan head that settles and rests into an everpresent cap. Great retention.  Smokey, roasted malt on the nose, some licorice root and treacle as well. Not complex, but satisfying.  The flavour as well is not complex, but hits home all the same. Rich sweet molasses, balanced out with robust roasted malt on the finish. Lightly bitter cocoa/coffee in the aftertaste, although pleasingly balanced with some sweet brewer's licorice. Combine it with the full, yet smooth and creamy mouthfeel, and this has got to be one of the most beautifully crafted stouts I've ever tried, Imperial or otherwise. I can easily see how Catherine The Great and her court (or cohorts) could have fallen in love with something akin to this as well and kept a steady supply ordered and imported from England, Yum!

This brew is for all purposes black but when held up to the light you can make out some brown color. The head stuck around for a long time. The aroma is sweet and fruit-like with the presence of alcohol. At first sip it is confusing but afterwards the flavors come out. This sweet brew is rich in awesome bitter dark chocolate and coffee flavors. The feel is surprisingly thin but smooth and slick. Towards the end of the pint my mouth is fairly dry.

A brownish tan almost 3 inch head that builds quickly after a somewhat aggressive pour and slowly recedes. Lacing is more like watery carbonation bubbles which quickly recede and leave some trails behind.  Wide array of pleasantries in the nose; toffee, coffee, toasted malts.  The taste is sweeter than the nose and very well balanced. Many of the same hints as found by smell, but they are all so well balanced that none of them really stand out more than each other.  Watery in front, creamy and thicker in back. Perfect carbonation. Heavier body, but this is easily deceiving because this one is easy to drink and makes you want to come back for more.

Taste is a very good medley of roasted chocolate malts, coffee and cream, hints of molasses all balanced quite nicely by those English hops. Mouthfeel is quite smooth and creamy but is a bit thinner than most in this style. Drinkability is quite good.

Very round mouthfeel... complex flavors are quite overwhelming. Fruit tones and toffee/roast character present as well. Sweetness helps round the mouthfeel out yet isn't overbearing and is reminiscent of molasses or sorghum. Brew lingers on the palate with complex series of flavors.

I grabbed 4 flavors and I've fallen in love all over again... On to the review. Poured from a 550 ml brown bottle into a pint glass. A good 3 finger head of brown foam covering a dark brown - black (light black) beer. The head dissipated after about a minute or so leaving behind substantial lacing. Smell: Prunes , raisins, some sort of dried fruit dominates. Taste: raisin, roasted malt, chocolate, some vanilla. very little bitterness. The carbonation stimulates my taste buds. Mouthfeel: smooth and creamy. Hard to believe that a 7% ABV RIS has this good of a mouthfeel. Drinkability; very nice. I could drink this beer all night. It's very refreshing for an RIS.

This looks killer.  S- Some coffee and chocolate, but pretty subdued. There is also a very apparent English aspect to it. Not nearly as roasty as a lot of other Russian Imperial Stout.  T- Much more going on here than in the aroma. There is a lot of chocolate and coffee flavors, but they are pretty smooth. There is a good amount of sweetness as well as some vanilla. Pretty complex.  M- Silky smooth and crisp. A little dry on the finish, but this just causes me to want to drink more of it.  D- Very impressive.

Long, lingering aftertaste of both black coffee and smoke.  M - Very slick, heavy-ish body, almost no carbonation. Alcohol is not present at all.

113,782,AlexBlueV,4.85,"Presentation: Very distinguished looking label. ""Vintage"", as the kids are saying these days. The only thing off-putting to me is the gold foil on the neck, and covering the cap (which is clamped down so tight that my bottle opener won't fit under it...) I'm dying to taste this beer, and now my floor is covered with little pieces of gold foil. Eh.  Appearance: Wow. I could have sworn I just poured chocolate syrup into my glass. This looks AMAZING. It's black. Light is no match for this. Caramel-colored head, nice and foamy. Good amount of lace sticking to the glass as the head dies down. There is still a thin layer of head, and I don't think it wants to go away.  Smell: So inviting. Chocolaty, toasty and warm. Very earthy. Coffee beans are here as well.  Taste/Feel: Just in case I haven't mentioned chocolate enough...it's definitely present in the taste. Coffee is certainly here as well. The aftertaste seems nutty to me, and I like that quite a bit. Everything seems very balanced about this beer. Having not tried many Imperial Stouts (yet), it's hard for me to judge how heavy this one is in comparison to others, but as an IPA drinker, this seems heavy to me. Not at all heavy in a bad way. It doesn't sting the taste buds, the ride is completely smooth. The alcohol warms the mouth/face quite nicely...and I'm only on sip number 4.  Drinkability: This stuff is so easy to drink...

An excellent balance of flavours coming together to make a very nice tasting brew.  M & D: Rich and very well-rounded. It's got a big and full flavour, but doesn't go overboard.

Chocolate, coffee, apple... all there, but nothing overwhelms the drinkers taste buds.  Very, very drinkable, rich and light....

Smell is of roasted coffee, almost mocha, with chocolate and malt following closely. Could sit and smell this all day.  Taste is almost perfection. Only the slightest taste of alcohol gives way to a hint of chocolate and roasted coffee. Not too sweet, not too bitter. Somewhere it the middle.  Mouthfeel is nice. The alcohol is not over powering and doesn't effect the feel at all. Goes down nice and smooth thanks to the 7% but still gives you warmth.

Some milk chocolate sneaks in and mixes with a warm alcohol smell. On the tail end, some coffe is evident.  T - Roasted flavors show first that quickly get met by some molasses and maple. Some bittersweet chocolate and coffee show up midway. Rounding things out are alcohol and a hint of smoke.  M - Medium bodied with good carbonation. Finish is a little sweet and does not stick around for long.  D - Drinkability is good. Alcohol is low which makes it go down easy for an Imperial Stout.

Doesn't have many of the characteristics I would expect from an Imperial, starting with the head. Only about one finger and it didn't hang out long, leaving nothing behind. Sweet aroma of roasted chocolate malt, molasses, and caramel. Hint of metal and malt vinegar. Immediately after swallowing there's a weird earthy flavor that dissipates quickly into sweet chocolate and molasses. Roasted bitterness and hops show up to balance the finish. I still think they could bump up the IBU's to cut a little more of that sweetness. Aftertaste slowly fades into a very nice mocha-coffee flavor. Feel is medium and somewhat creamy.

The beer is almost completely black, but there is a bit of brown shining through the bottom of the glass when held to light. Head was unimpressive, getting to only one finger thick and dissipating quickly. Color was tan.  Smell: Milky chocolate dominates the nose, but there are other malts swimming under the surface as well. Molasses and roasted come to mind. There is a slight fleeting plum note. Then back to sweet chocolate.  Taste: This beer completely takes over the palate, sending your tastebuds on a rollercoaster through every imaginable malt flavor, and then some. Coffee starts things off, then comes smooth chocolate and roasted. A certain meaty flavor comes in at the midpalate. Finishes smooth with black coffee and a hint of sweet molasses.  Mouthfeel: A little more carbonated than what I was expecting, as the beer is also very very thick. Definitely full bodied and pretty heavy.  Drinkability: This is one I'll definitely come back to.

S: A nice, roasted smell with bittersweet, chocolate undertones. A nice smelling stout.  T: A nice, roasted taste with a slightly, sweet warming aftertaste. Alcohol was slightly evident in the aftertaste, but it was welcoming, warming, and comforting.  M: This stout is smooth as silk. A little light, but that is just because of the style of beer the brewer was goign for. Definitely well constructed and went well with the taste.  D: Definitely a drinkable beer.

113,782,Ysgard,4.6,"A world class brew, no doubts.  The head was not explosive as Old Rasputin's, though it stuck around through the end, the perfect brown cloak for this balanced black beer.  The smell is led by roast espresso and dark fruit, with sweet milk and caramel around the background.  My favorite thing about this beer is that although the flavor changes as it warms, as with any stout, it is excellent both warm and cold. When cold at the start, the sweetness is balanced by tart dark fruits and bitter chocolate. As it warms, the coffee and hops come out to the front. The path between cold and cool is one fine walk in the dark.  Smooth, with moderate carbonation, thick enough to roll through the mouth, but not chew, the mouthfeel is easy to get along with, and keeps the drinkability reasonable.

113,782,LittleCreature,4.38,"Appearance - 4.5 Poured two fingers of frothy beige head that steadily reduced over a mahogany-black body.  Smell - 4.0 Rich, slightly sweet roasted malt with a strong yeasty kick. Somewhat burnt from the roasted malt.  Taste - 4.5 A whole lotta flavour in this one! Gets better as it warms with flavours of burnt coffee, dark chocolate and rye bread with a warming yet subtle alcohol. There is also a bit of lemon zest hiding in there somewhere.  Mouthfeel - 4.5 A lovely fine and persistent carbonation and thick, heavyish weight in the mouth.  Drinkability - 4.5 Worth going back to, not overly challenging, especially after warming. 7% is low for an Imperial Stout, making it all the more drinkable.  OVERALL - 4.4 This is certainly a rich, impressive brew, and stouts aren't usually my thing. I would try this again, as I see the $6 price as being good value.  Edit: This beer hardly qualifies as a RIS at just 7% abv - but in the English tradition it delivers more flavour than would seem possible for the strength. Brilliant stuff!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,markaberrant,3.71,"A - Incredibly dense and creamy dark tan head. Otherwise completely black. Leaves some big puffs of lace behind.  S - dark fruits, mix of cherry and raisin. There are whisps of something darker lurking, like dense chocolate, but for me it is fruit forward.  T - fruitiness carries all the way through in the taste, nicely blended with some smooth roastiness, long lingering roasted finish.  M - big thick mouthfeel, chewy. Low carbonation. Alcohol feels a tad too warm, but is still enjoyable.  D - While certainly not a bold impy stout, it is refined, and goes down easy.  I can't say I dislike the fruitiness, but it is a little much for my taste. While this is a certainly a fine English example of the style, my personal preference is more towards a cleaner, roastier, and more agressive beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Excellent retention with a ridiculous smooth layer of lacing as it's being enjoyed.  Smell: Sweet, spicy raisin, milky and cidery, smooth caramel malt. Very different.  Mouthfeel: Full chewy body with subdued carbonation.  Taste: Anise cidery malt. Excellent hoppy bite at the end.  Drinkability: This is unlike any RIS you've ever had and well worth trying. It's subtle and enjoyable.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,hustlesworth,5,"A- complete black except for a tiny shred of burgundy at the very bottom. thick dense dark-khaki colored head is firm and wiggly as jello and as it slowly settles down it leaves gobs of lace behind.  S- alot of roasted malt sweetness and a little bit of smoke. well water, plum, currant, some anise, cocoa powder, and earthy hops with mild citrus aroma. toffee, marshmallow, and caramel stand apart from the roasted notes with a very appealing dessert-like sweetness. raisin, fig, date, cedar. chocolate instead of coffee. doughnut, funnel cake, creamstick, etc. this baby smells like a pastry.  T- huge amount of malt flavor with a touch of smokiness, over-ripe sour dark fruit, cocoa, coffee, and earthy hops makes for a nice bitter burnt biscuit aftertaste and moderate hop bitterness. the malt profile here is sublime, and any more hops would be a hindrance. sweet and roasted, everything burnt, with the perfect balance of burnt and sweet. tastes exactly like bittersweet chocolates. with a coffee-ish edge. and a shiver of alcohol as i swallow. citrus and blackberry syrup notes on the backside, long burnt finish.  MF- thick and rich with its melted chocolatey self, has a slight grainy cocoa powder feel and i'm not surprised because this right here is a lunch in itself. somewhat of a light minty colling effect as well, probably from drying and evaporation of alcohol on the inhale/exhale. carbonation is low low and almost nitro tiny and hell, even if there were no bubbles at all, this would still feel like heaven.  D- a benchmark indeed, that goes without saying, and though our american brewers make some great RIS, this one takes the cake for me. Old Rasputin might give it a run for its money, but sammy wins in the long run cuz of the mysterious D factor. in this case it's not so mysterious- the 7% abv. yeah and the incredible flavors and smells and everything else, but with that 2-4% lower alcohol come less knock you out of your chair intensity, allowing this one to drink as good as their oatmeal stout. this is unquestionable perfection. i could easily (if i wanted to wind up with my face on the concrete) sit and enjoy pint after imperial pint of this magical elixir.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,blackjack000,4.5,"Appearance: Pours out as a a thick, dark brown and is pitch black in the glass. A frothy, caramel-colored head appears in good amounts and slowly deflates. The creamy caramel and coffee-with-cream color of the head really complements the color of the beer and is appetizing and inviting.  Smell: Roasted coffee is the first smell to come forward. I smell anise seed, small amount of raisin, black liquorice, and warm brown sugar.  Taste: A good amount of roasted coffee, with a well-balanced amount of hops. An aftertaste of baker's chocolate, coffee, and black liquorice.  Mouthfeel: An above-medium, light-heavy feel in the mouth. Hearty, without being overbearing.  Drinkability: Well balanced and delicious. It isn't as full-bodied as some of the imperial stouts I've had, but it comes off as a very nice package. Everything is toned down to just the right frequency to experience all the complex flavors, in just the right amount. Don't get me wrong, a lot of flavor and feel in this beer, but it's not pumped up to the level where I have to be 100% focused on the beer in order to fully experience it.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

The majority the head sticks around for a little bit then dies off, leaving about a quarter inch.  Fairly strong smells of chocolate, roasted coffee and malts.  Tastes very strongly of a bitter dark chocolate, with some slight caramel tastes. Don't taste as much coffee as I was expecting to. The alcohol is hidden pretty well.  Very drinkable with a medium-light mouthfeel.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Lukie,4.62,"Black as night with a brown head that dissipitates to mild lacing around the top of the liquid. Not much else really.  Coffee and sweet sugars with hints of alcohol. Kind of candyish in the nose.  Roasted coffee, hop presence in the finish. Lemon citrus notes (cheesecake?), yep, cheesecake. I can taste that in the finish. Delightful.  For a stout, this is the easiest one to drink yet. I don't drink a lot of stout, but this one is amazingly smooth and not as heavy as others I have taken in.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,erosier,4.57,"This beer pours a jet black color with a tall and medium bodied tan head that fades to just a rim around the glass. It laces the glass pretty well on the way down. It has a very deep roasted malt smell with a chocolatey aroma and a hint of hoppy bitterness at the end of the nose. The taste is excellent for an RIS. It has a very deep roasted malt base followed by nice chocolatey and caramel flavors and then a bit of rasiny taste and then a short but perfect hoppy bitterness that rounds out the ber very well. It has a very creamy, velvety, and warming mouthfeel that doesn't really hit you in the face with alcohol, but it is strong enough to warm. The drinkability is very good and I would definately have more than one of these. Definatly worth a try.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Mdog,4.15,"Appearance: Opaque, black, with a big tan head.  Smell: Rummy at first, then more beer-like with dark fruit and chocolate.  Taste: Bitter dark chocolate is the main thrust of this beer, a little hint of raisin in there also.  Mouthfeel: I thought this was a little light for an imperial stout, however--  Drinkability: The lightness along with the lower alcohol makes this one of the few almost sessionable imperial stouts.  Decided to pick up a 4 pack of Sam Smith's Imperial stout on a recent beer run. I haven't had this in a while, but it was as good as I remember it. Doesn't smack you around like some other imp. stouts but still plenty of flavor.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Pencible,3.9,"This poured an opaque black with a little dark tan head. It smelled like roast malt with prunes and alcohol. It tasted like licorice and bitter coffee with some roast malt for balance. It was watery and smooth with just a little carbonation and a strong malt aftertaste. Overall this was not quite what I expected - good but not super. In fact, I think I've been disappointed with just about all the Sam Smiths.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,OlieIPA,3.5,"This beer had a very dark and clean appearance, while supporting a decent one-finger head. The smell and taste supplied my mouth with hints of coffee and roasted like flavors.

113,782,Pehlman,4.3,"A solid black beer you can not see through held up to the light. Poured a nice 1-2 finger dark tan head that disappeared quickly leaving very little lacing. The slightest hint of alcohol at first but then a wave of smokey goodness with a slight dark-fruit malt backing. Mouthfeel comes on a bit creamy but just like the head, thins out leaving little behind. Left the roof of my mouth a bit dry but I didn't mind.

Spicy with mild mocha coffee and dark chocolate notes. Not much of an alcohol aftertaste.  M: Substantial. RIS is a heavy style and this offering is no different. Carbonation is good and adds to the spiciness.  D: This is a pretty heavy beer, but I can see myself finishing the four pack in one session because it's so damn good.

113,782,trpng0bily,4.92,"This brew is black as can be, with a moderate, creamy tan head that dissipates. The smell is robust, with chocolate, coffee, anise, spiciness, malts, and a hint of alcohol. The taste does not dissapoint - it more than follows though on the promise of its nose, adding a brilliant bitterness to the chocolate, as well as the dry finish that nobody delivers quite like Sammy, though it is, appropriately, not as prominent as in other of their offerings. A perfect harmony is achieved between the bitter chocolate, sweet malts, and spicy hops. This beer is rich, though it could stand to be just a bit fuller in body, with carbonation that has some pop, and a nice warming effect (though the alcohol is not noticable in taste) that lingers comfortingly. Finally, this stout is as drinkable as any I've tried.  This has long been my favorite stout, and for nostalgia's sake I somewhat regret not making it my first review on BA.

113,782,bluemoonswoon,4.08,"550mL bottle poured into a Sam Adams fancy schmancy pint glass, not freshness date.  A: Pours a smooth jet black, not as thick as the KBS I tried recently, but no light is coming though this one. A vigorous pour yields a two and a half inch semi-creamy, semi-rocky light nougat colored head that bubbles down to a half inch cap in about two minutes leaving some lacing down the glass on the bubble down.  S: Roasted chocolate and caramel malt, bit of a boozy kick in there even for a 7% ABV beer, maybe some light oxidation as there is a bit of a raisiny sweetness detectable but not overpowering and not really that bad. I detect a slight bit of vanilla in here as well which rounds out this very rich aroma on this beer.  T/MF: Quite fruity, raisins and plums and I'm beginning to wonder how long this has been sitting on the shelf, but this is balanced out a bit by a rather crunchy dextrose maltiness as wells as detectable amounts of chocolatyness in here as well. Mouthfeel is rather slick and watery maybe because of the lower abv but the carbonation is lively enough to keep this one from becoming too cloying on the palate. The finish is long and dry and really lets the malts show what they got, pretty tongue drying for such a malty beer not at all like other RISs I've tasted that leave your mouth feeling greasy, pretty decently balanced if a bit too raisiny for my tastes.

113,782,CHADMC3,4.44,"This Sam Smith pours an oil slick black with a thick tan head which quickly subsides to a thin lacing lasting throughout the beer.  Very aromatic, the first thing I picked up was a dark fruit scent, perhaps raisins, prunes, or some similar variety. Also apparent is the coffee and roasted alcohol scents. Perhaps I am way off base here, but it kind of smells like an Irish coffee.  Again, there are some great dark fruit flavors, roasted coffee, and something resembling a bourbon or similar dark alcohol. Excellent.  This beer is complex and smooth. Extremely satisfying and delightful.  This Imperial Stout leaves me craving another sample. It continues to encourage you to keep drinking it and searching for new flavors. Excellent beer!

S: Nice aroma of strong roasted coffee, chocolate and a hint of caramel. A light hint of a mild spice of either nutmeg or allspice...hard to tell but a pleasant smell nonetheless.  T: The taste mirrors the smell with a robust roasted coffee malt flavor, preceeded by hints of chocolate malts, then followed with what seemed to be light caramel and spice hops...very light yet lingering on the tongue. Wonderful on the palate.  MF: Carbonated a little more, as if it were a original stout as opposed to a Russian Imperial. Great with the brew though, as it is slighty lighter in body than the RIS. First taste of carbonation briskly followed by a creamy, heavy, yet unbelievably smooth feeling left on the palate.  D: Drinkability is outstanding, especially considering its style as a RIS. I could definitely do a few of these at a time, proposing they not be $8 a beer. I would definitely recommend a Samuel Smith Imperial Stout.

113,782,JohnGalt1,4.1,"From the cellar.. been down there since August.. Shared with Brenda.. mine from my New Belgium snifter... I am pretty sure they are going for about $2.50 at the Coop.  2"" head .. rings of tan lace .. deep black brew.  Nose is more dark fruits than anything else.. prunes and dark brown sugar essence. Some chocolate and dark malts .. but not nearly as ""black"" smelling as most of the RIS's I've had in recent years.  Sweet and dark fruits with quick transition to coffee in the front of the palate .. Again more fruity than dark malt presence.. prunes with subtle side of the tongue chocolate with a molasses finish. No real ""char"" to speak of, and I'm okay with that on the Sammy. The roasty is present .. but seems to play second fiddle.. gives way even more as it warms.  I haven't had one of these in probably a year... instead been sampling and enjoying the bigger badder cousins in the style. The Samuel Smith RIS should be considered more as a founder or the father of the style in my opinion.

A - poured into the snifter and left a small, off white head that didn't last long and then just sat on the top. when poured it was a black color but it actually looked a bit thin for an RIS  S - smelled a bit of milk, figs and dates, and also a hint of pepper and smokiness that reminded me a bit of beef jerky. Also smells a bit like a manhattan cocktail in that it smells like vermouth and alcoholic cherries.  T - the taste on the whole is at first rather smoky and roasty to me. I noticed that there is is very peppery and even a bit like a hickory taste to it. A light chocolate flavor also seems to pop. Even reminds me a bit of a beef broth or something. There is also a slight hint of the date flavor that I picked up in the nose that is mixed in with a bit of a tart orange flavor that also seems to pop out in the end of the taste; however the full meaty flavors are what I noticed that most.  MF - Very thick and full feeling brew. I think the body of this adds to the fact that it reminds me of eating beef jerky. it is a mouth full of thick breadiness that just sits there in the mouth and even makes me feel full in the stomach. This almost makes this beer feel like a meal in itself.  D - overall an average RIS that doesn't really seems to have the complexities of some of the other RISs that I have had. It is huge on the smoky characters and does not taste bad but has nothing beyond that that makes this beer stick out. Plus as noted in the MF section it is so thick in the mouth and the body and maybe even mixed in with the smoky taste that makes this hard to have more than one in my opinion.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Anise, belgian yeast and the dark fruit smell that tends to go along with it. Only a hint of roasted malt makes it through. a bit of alcohol and some apples.  Here comes the roasted malt that was hiding in the nose...so smooth. Anise is still there. The taste is complex. Dark fruit show up mostly at the beginning and give way to the roasted tastes.

Complexities include big dark fruitcake (figs!), licorice, hardwood charcoal, and soft dried cherries soaking in dark rum. Leafy English hops play a supporting role and let the complex aromas come through. Unique, and I think the mineral character really adds a lot. Just a touch of boozy heat.  m: Medium, delicate carbonation and a body on the full side of medium.  t: Smooth roasts give flavors of bittersweet chocolate and the toasted crusts of dark breads.

That's right...two of three states in the US with a 6.00% ABV limit on beer. Russian Imperial Stouts are consequently unavailable in either state. A couple days ago I made a trip to Georgia to pick up some decent beer, all of which turned out to be RIS. This review of Sam Smith Imperial Stout must be viewed in the context of my recent exposure to Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout and Old Rasputin, both of which I consider the best examples of the style.  That said, I must say that Sam Smith's offering is very good. It has a lower (7%) alcohol content than the most famous imperial stouts, enhancing its repeat drinkability. It doesn't kick you in the nuts quite as hard as some others, but its appearance, smell, taste, and mouthfeel are premium.

Hints of dark fruit, bittersweet chocolate, toasted malts, hop bitterness, and warm alcohol all in an extrodinary balance that glides over the palate. Mouthfeel is where this bad boy dominates. Thick and chewy, coating this tounge perfectly. This has the feel of a good, real chocolate milk from my childhood, just served warmer.

113,782,gkatsoris,3.59,"A: Dark and rich. Thick, thick head. It already looks chewy. The head is beautiful, light coffee in color.  S: Alcohol. Raisins. Coffee. Hops. And a little tinny. And dark unsweetened chocolate.  T: Chocolate. Coffee. Dried fruits, maybe figs or raisins or cherries. Malts. Unfortunately a little light on the hops.  M: Thick and chewy. Very nice carbonation. Stays on the tongue for a while too.  D: Honestly I'm a little disappointed. But, I think I may have a bad bottle (or at least I hope so), and I only have this one.

113,782,AleDrinkToThat,4.66,"Appearance: I'm fairly sure you could hold a glass of this stout up to the sun and not see through it. The one finger medium brown head stays right there, slowly working its way down as you sip on the blissful concoction for a minimum of an hour.  Smell: Roasted coffee and cocoa notes hit strongly, with slightly more faint notes of raisin and other dark fruit. And yeah boy, the alcohol's there.  Taste: The roasted coffee/cocoa notes hit immediately, along with the warm presence of the alcohol. The hops really doesn't survive the onslaught of rich malt that drowns everything, even light itself, in its path. The sweeter, raisin-like notes finish it all up, and the warmth of the alcohol stays right there with you.  Mouthfeel: Rich, smooth, and warm from the lips all the way down the throat. And when I say rich, I'm not talking ""kinda rich"". I mean RICH. Break out the steak knives. The alcohol mainly provides a welcome warmth, but no burn. Just warm smooth goodness.  Drinkability: I mean, I was clean shaven when I cracked open the bottle, and now I have a five inch beard. A wonderful beer that should, as many others have noted, be sipped slowly, so that every drop can be savored, and it's probably best to not have more than one or, at most, two in a single sitting. That's like 3 or 4 regular beers, plus a porterhouse. Take 'er easy.

113,782,watchnerd,4.3,"Looks like an imperial stout should, smells like an imperial stout should. Taste is a bit less bold than my style reference, Old Rasputin, and the 7% ABV puts it on the wimpy end of 'Imperial'. Does 7% even qualify? Mouthfeel the weakest area, but otherwise, a fine stout. Just not up to the Rasputin.  2013 Update: Old Rasputin still superior.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Creamy off white head that retains nicely and leaves decent lacing.  Smells like coffee, chocolate malts, roasted malts, and a little bit nutty.  Tastes of coffee, toffee, and roasted malt.  Very smooth mouthfeel, the high ABV is hidden very nicely, the drinkability is also very good. I will be seeing this beer again very soon.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Bowdoinbeerboy,4.47,"Appearance- Pours with a medium sized off white head that quickly dissipates, its beautiful while it lasts thought. Beer itself is completely opaque, no light gets through this one at all!  Smell- Very hefty smells here, alcohol is very apparent and gives entire nose a fairly strong bit to it, malty with some underlying alcoholic sweetness.  Taste- Alcohol is much more masked here than in the nose, initial taste is alcohol-sweet, followed by a more subdued molasses flavor, and finally a pleasant warm, lingering chocolate on the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel- Good palate coverage, flavor lingers for quite some time and is reasonably light, not too heavy.  Drinkability- A solid, solid IMPY stout.

Very nice Mr. Sammy  M: Pretty nice seems to gain some fullness on warming but that might just be me. A bit more body and this beer would be perfect.  D: A very balanced beer.

It is extremely dark and poors with an extremely small brown head that soon disappears. There is a bit of dried fruit in the aroma and taste. The aroma almost has a Apple/cider hint to it on top of the dark chocolate. The taste is good and full with a slightly sweet finish.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,hdofu,4.36,"An amazingly black beer with thick froth head, Smell is that of expresso. The taste is that of strong bitter coffee and maybe the tinniest hint of cocoa and orange. Has a syrupy feel on the tongue initially followed by a crisp taste like that of a grapefruit. Goes down the throat quite easily.

113,782,Kallessin,4.62,"Pours a creamy tan head that sticks to the glass nicely. Calling it dark would be an understatement. This beer is pure black.  A very sweet roasted malt smell with a little hint of alcohol.  I taste sweet roasted dark chocolate with a little hint of fruitiness in the background. The alcohol comes through quite a bit, but with the sweetness I don't mind it very much.  A surprising crisp mouthfeel from the carbonation at first but syrupy and smooth after that.  I like this beer a lot and will definitely buy it again.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,seaoflament,3.28,"I've had this one before and wasn't too impressed but I recently saw it at a local Bevmo for about $2.60 and since I have not rated it yet I though ""why not?""  Pours like an imperial stout should, dark and with about 2 fingers of foam.  Notes of dark fruits, nuts, spices, toasted malts, and a vinous aroma. Huge aroma of stale bread and raisins. There's also some notes of roasted barley, figs, dried prunes, and maybe some brown sugar. The only thing that bothers me a bit is the slightly vinous aroma, or maybe it's just an intense dark fruit combination with a touch of alcohol.  Tastes mostly of dark fruits and roasted barley. A bit vinous on the taste as well with some plums and raisins soaked in alcohol. Not bad but not really complex or ""big.""  Mouthfeel is a tad thin and watery on the finish.  Not really my favorite stout or a stout I would buy again. I think I'll stick with their Oatmeal Stout.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,JDV,1.72,"Pours black with a nice rich light toffee colored head. Smells of sweet caramel and soy sauce. Taste is rich, creamy, definite smokiness, and a roasty and caramel and soy sauce flavor with a hint of dry sourness. Fairly light carbonation gives it a decent oily thick mouthfeel. Definitely a different stout than those I've had before. Tastes almost like what I would imagine a very subtle rauchbier might be like, even though I've never had one. Unique lingering smoky tart soy flavor. Not a stout I'd ever drink again",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,BeardedBoffin,4.5,"This beer is black with a beautiful brownish head. Chocolate and dark fruits dominate the inviting aroma of this beer. Very smooth, almost creamy on the palate. The flavor is a mix of chocolate and espresso nicely balanced with bitterness. The beer ends appropriately with a lasting bitterness. This is a nicely balanced and drinkable beer, great with chocolate. This is a standard of the style.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,jakeaustin,3.21,"550ml bottle into an Imperial pint glass. Pours nice a black like an imperial stout should. Finger of brown creamy fades quickly into a thin head that last forever. Smells of chocolate, dried fruit, and a touch alcohol.  Taste is OK at best IMO. Getting some raisin, chocolate and little coffee. The overwhelming flavor though is a green/earthiness, however that is just not pleasant to my tastebuds. As it warms the coffee makes a return but can't battle the green flavor.  Mouthfeel and drinkability are the high lights of this brew. Creamy, but yet still fairly thin. Definitely the thinnest RIS I've had. At only 7.0% this is probably one of the more drinkable imperial stouts out there.

113,782,omnigrits,4.58,"Poured from a 550ml bottle into an imperial pint glass at about 50F.  Like Fish113d, I find that I've moved on from SS Oatmeal Stout to the Imperial, having discovered it on the beer shelf. It's fuller, more powerful and yet still well rounded. Strong roasted malt flavours with hints of coffee in the finish - a finish which lasts a very long time. The nose could be a little stronger but I'm not going to mark it down too much for that. I'd prefer more in the way of hops too, but that's just personal preference - this is still a world-class stout which leaves very little to be desired.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,ElGrecoVerde,3.93,"Deep brown coming out of the bottle, but black in the glass. Had a frothy, coffee color head sitting on top of it.  Smell was mostly dark fruits, a little smoky as well.  I must be in the minority here, because the taste didn't do much for me. It had some sweet, dark fruit flavors, mainly raisins. As it warmed, some dark chocolate flavors joined the party as well. It seemed well balanced, and I can see why most people love this, but it just wasn't my cup o' beer.  The feel was a bit oily. Carbonation, however, seemed perfect. Just enough to give your mouth that feeling that it's ready for the next sip without going over the top.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

I can hardly contain myself for this one. It's the apex of British beer, and dare I say most beer around the world. The velvety chocolate and espresso flavors work the palate over while the dark and rich earthiness nestle in the taste buds. There's no explosion of flavor here; everything is in proportion and classy. Mouthfel is rich, smooth, and creamy. I could drink this all day.

113,782,DoubleJ,4.4,"550 ml bottle purchased from BevMo, on to the beer:  Poured inot a Guinness pint glass, the appearance is black with brownish hues on the edges and a thick tan head on top the body. The aroma has a pinch of alcohol, then followed by smoked chocolate and coffee. The taste begins sweet and smokey like tobacco and cocoa. There's some roasted characeter as well in the form of sweet malt. Alcohol is a little heavier than expectations, which makes things a little fruity. There's some chocolate fudge cake that appears briefly before being knocked down. The ABV is on the low-end for RIS's, but this beer has a full bodied taste that should be respected with slow sips.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Halcyondays,4.13,"16.9 oz. bottle,  A: Pours a dark brown, with a full and thick tan head, which leaves some thick lacing in spots.  S: Milk chocolate predominately, with licorice, molasses, and a bit of tropical fruit.  T: Heavy creamy chocolate coats the tongue on the first sip followed by a burst of quenching acidity, though nowhere near as high as a sour or Le. Coq. There is also a serious dark fruit component to this beer which I don't often find in American versions of this style - prune syrup and raisins. The flavours are mellower and subtler than its American cousins, but the flavours are still as tasty.  M: Velvety and smooth, with a hint of alcoholic strength, calming.  D: A very drinkable Imperial Stout, on the light side of this category, but is probably more reminiscent of the actual historical style of this beer, very good.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Fish113d,4.09,"Suprised to find Sammy Smith in brown bottles! Anyways, I pour it into my large tulip at about 48 degrees (F). It pours a chocolate brown color with a milky, tan, finger-thick head atop that sustains itself nicely.  At first sniff, the alcohol hits my nose pretty hard; suprising for a 7%-er. Caramel and chocolate are well-apparent here. A bit of bourbon also to note. Interesting but a bit tingly on the nose.  Flavors are full and rich. Chocolate hits my palate up front along with a bit of toffee and toasted nuts. Smooth and creamy body leads to a bit of tingly alcohol finish that leaves my palage a bit numb. A mild mochachino and coffee flavor is a nice afterflavor. Very tasty and nice on the palate.  Very drinkable tasty brew.

Chocolate, coffee, fresh grapes, brown sugar are all part of a complex and satisfying aroma.  Molasses and black licorice are stand outs in the taste category. Semi sweet up front, dry in the finish.  A little thinner than I am used to in the Imperial Stout style, with the subtle carbonation one should expect.  Quite nice, worth waiting for.

Very creamy, full body with average carbonation. Quite sticky. Bursting with malt and strong leafy hops, with a perfect roast that compliments, but doesn't overpower. Balanced and well-rounded. Good bitterness, slightly drying in the middle with a very juicy finish. Bittersweet chocolate rounded out by heaps of brown sugar and quite earthy. Tasty fruity concoction throughout with a nutty finish.  Complex and packed with flavour...you don't want to run out of this stuff.

113,782,Bobzilla,4.66,"Nice smoothness considering the relatively high alcohol content. I like how the taste lingers on the palate for a very long time, but as it does, it seems to shift character. An earthy start slowly shifts to a mild bitterness after a half minute or so. The smell is a bit too caramelly, and reminds me a bit of the over the top smell and taste of the Saranac Caramel Porter, but nowhere near as cloyingly sweet. While I generally am one to not reach for a stout or porter first, I find that this is consistently one I have around the house. (When a store in town actually stocks it or most often when I specifically order it.) This is a beer that makes me want to attempt to brew an Imperial Stout!

113,782,jobyone,4.38,The beer pours a wonderful black with a thick tan head. Lots of malt sweetness on teh aroma. The tast is sweet with a hint of fruit.

113,782,pmcadamis,4.47,"I love Samuel Smith bottles! The large size and gold foil top let you know that you are in for something special, and the label makes me think of a nineteenth century advertisement in a tattered and yellowed newspaper.  A - A huge four finger chocolate brown head rises over a pitch black tar brew that lets absolutely no light through. The head shows outstanding retention as it eventually falls to a nice finger cap. Thick sheets of foam slide down into the glass after a swirl as they deposit a good amount of creamy chocolate lace on the sides.  S - This smells like a box of assorted chocolates! Dark chocolate, milk chocolate, lots of toffee and a little bit of caramel. I even smell some distinct raspberry jam and some gooey black cherry nougat filling. This is ridiculously complex! Black cherry and raspberry jam spread on black bread with chocolate syrup on top. There are also some nicely toasted cereal grain notes.  T - Again, super complex like the nose. The fruity black cherry nuances aren't there, but all of the chocolate goodness remains. The flavor is much more smoky and woody than the nose, and some burnt rubber flavors are there too. Campfire smoke and dark roasted coffee. Outstanding.  M - Full bodied with an almost nonexistent carbonation and a smoky oily finish. The alcohol is not evident in the flavor, but does warm me up as it slides down my throat and into my gut.  D - On outstanding brew! And at 7% ABV, this stands to be a quite drinkable RIS. It's ridiculously complex and subtle in ways that many American RIS are not. Those heavy hitting American brews may be stunning and flashy, but this has true complexity like an old single malt scotch.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,clwaldin,4.37,"Appearance: Opaque and jet-black; not even the track lighting gets through this bad boy. The head manifests as a light brown or dark cream with lively carbonation, yet only lingers momentarily before largely dissipating, leaving only a very thin and mottled head at the top. Impressive, but I honestly expected more head retention and glass-clingage out of this juggernaut.  Smell: There is definitely a substantial aroma of sweet-smelling indistinct dark fruit (figs or dates perhaps?), and this seems to grab the nose at first. To a lesser degree, this brew features notes of tobacco and leather. Do I detect the faintest hint of vanilla? All in all, a highly inviting bouquet.  Taste: A moderate hop bite flashes on the tongue first, and is followed by a smoky malt backbone that almost reminds me of beef jerky, but in a good way (I also get this from Sam's Taddy Porter and especially the Alaskan Smoked Porter). In general, the taste almost precisely mimics what is promised in the nose, except for the smoked properties which really shine in the middle to end of the tasting experience. More sugary dark fruits (a beer colleauge of mine aptly mentioned dark cherry) and hints of vanilla mingle in the background. This beer seems to acheive that which all world-class beers strive for, namely, the ability to appear complex and satisfyingly simple at the same time.  Mouthfeel: Although not as creamy or chewy as Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout, the mouthfeel is still plenty smooth and creamy without feeling too heavy or astringent. An almost tangy carbonation is definitely present and lends the beer a somewhat spritely mouthfeel, and prevents this mighty brew from falling flat (literally).  Drinkability: I wouldn't want more than 2 or 3 in one sitting. However, as far as the formidable Imperial Stout goes, this one is pretty darn drinkable and avoids being too heavy, hoppy, or syrupy (as many Imperials tend to).  Notes: Bow down to the true Czar of Imperial Stouts! Absolutely tops in my book for this style. As usual, it's always refreshing to try Sammy Smith's British spin on great beer styles such as this one. Being a hop lover yet not a full-fledged hophead, I tend to favor this type of take on the Imperial versus the often over-zealously hopped American examples.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,crazyreagan,4.25,"Pure opaque pour - devours the light. The head rises with ambition; full of creamy coffee highlights. Lacing all the way down.  BIG dark chocolate, roasted malt smell. Dark fruity smell up front, leather and a touch of cinnamon bring up the rear.  More chocolate in the taste, lots of caramel. Pleasantly warm, with just enough carbonation to really open up the flavor in the mouth. Hops bring the right touch of bitterness to round this guy out. kudos ss!  Mouthfeel is ideal for the style; rolls around in the mouth, coats the tongue. This imperial has some staying power!  Would put this at one end of a session.

Moderate body and carbonation for an Imperial Stout, which make it very drinkable.  Very good drinkable Imperial Stout. Not as extreme as most RIS's, but very satisfying.

T: Tangy and spicy raisins, plums, and figs followed very closely by dark and milk chocolate, cherry, caramel, toffee, espresso, hops, and roasted malt.  M: Full, sweet and bitter. Very coating.

113,782,basica,4.38,"I bought this from Cracked Kettle and man do I love the bottle itself. The bottle itself is a nice slim and tall design with the top nicely wrapped in gold foil and a unique looking label. This beer yields a jet black pour with a nicely creamy looking tan head that moderately settles to a thin layer and finally a nice clingy lacing. On the nose I pick up roasted malts, chocolates, coffee and subtle dashes of dark fruits; some lactic milkiness also peaks out of the creamy head. The smell was not very strong and the various elements in the smell were nicely balanced out. The taste starts off with an immediately suggestion of coffee followed by roasted malts and light notes of chocolates here and there with a nice smooth milky backing. There were also dashes of dark fruits towards the finish and a good amount of roasted malts on the nose. Sweetness was probably very very subtle on this one and a slighty below moderate level of bitterness can be detected towards and during the finish. Taste was fairly rich though not very rich and it was very well balanced; without too much of anything. 7 ABV makes it a really light drink as well and it practically feels below 5. The lingering after taste had coffee, roasted malts and subtle dark fruits and a light bitterness. The mouthfeel is close to full bodied and is smooth and creamy with low carbonation and goes down very smooth. This is my first imperial stout and I feel that it is highly drinkable. I was expecting something pretty heavy. I prefer the Guinness Special Export Stout to this but the strength of this one is a nice, well balanced blend of many different flavours but not overly rich and yet very enjoyable and drinkable.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

It has typical roasted malt and chocolate/coffee bean hints, yet also has a bit of scotch ale smell (very slight). The taste starts out very malty with the chocolate, burnt coffee bean, and small vanilla taste. Through the middle I realize that what i thought was scotch ale on the nose was actually the sammy smith yeastish malt funk(good funk) that you can find in almost all of their brews. There is slight hop flavor and bite here as well, just before the finish. The finish falls back into the more familiar imperial flavors. The mouthfeel is where this beer struggles. it is very thin for an imperial stout, but goes down smooth. I suspect that this can be closely linked to the brews weak 7% abv. Drinkability is very high. still a good brew overall and a great beginners imperial stout. A good buy, and another great sammy smiths beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Opaque black with a two-fingered dark khaki head, which later settled to become a rather thick layer of froth that lay on top. Thick lacing, though it doesn't stick very long. Wonderful smell. Nice and strong. One can detect dark fruits, roasted coffee, caramel, and brown sugar. Very sweet smelling. Taste was a little fainter than the smell indicated, though still complex and still delicious. The darker fruits make themselves a little more known as it warms. Mouthfeel is creamy, though a little on the thin side. This is very drinkable, especially for an imperial stout.

113,782,younger35,4.32,"Picked up a 355mL bottle of this stuff at my local beer store. Ive yet to have a Samuel Smith brew that Ive actually liked but Im a huge sucker for Imperial Stouts. Drank from my snifter while watching Boise State vs. Eastern Carolina.  Appearance- Pours a super dark brown with a tip of amber on the bottom of the glass where the stem meets the cup. Decent sized sandy tan head forms but quickly dissipates leaving a spotty cap and thin collar. Not a whole lot of lacing is left behind but enough to satisfy me. Smell- Boldly roasted malts are plentiful as is dark roasted coffee. Cocoa beans and bitter bakers chocolate are offset by gentle whiffs of vanilla bean. A bit of black licorice, caramel and brandy top off the nose nicely. A lot going on in here but nothing that really dominates anything else. Taste- The first thing that jumps out at me is how much vanilla I get out of this. There is plenty of dark roasted coffee and cream along with nice sweet milk chocolate. Brandy soaked dark cherries and raisins add a bit of sweet bitterness. Touches of caramelized sugars give this a rather nutty finish. Plenty of alcohol here although most of it is covered well. Mouthfeel- Nice and full bodied with a very slick and oily feel along with a very light carbonation. Drinkability- This isnt as explosive as some other Imperial Stouts but its really solid and all the flavors meld really well. I love a well balanced brew and this really embodies that. This was a really good beer and I can now say I officially like a Samuel Smith beer. Recommended.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

The smell is a very sweet carmel malt - strong bitter molasses scent. Coffee nut molasses flavor. A very robust chocolate malt rum taste. Mouth feel is very creamy and smooth. Carbonation not too big, and the alcohol feel isn't upfront or immediate. Finishes very smooth, no real bite to this beer whatsoever. Overall, this is a good Imperial Stout.

Finishes with a nice smokey-pipe flavor, balanced with a sweet overtones.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, smooth and creamy. Carbonation is low.

It takes a few minutes to subside. Ample lacing on the sides of the glass. Nice.  Smell: Hop presence but heavily malted. Cocoa is a huge aroma. Caramel, toffee, rum soaked bread. Sugary molasses and port wine, leathery scent.  Taste: Chocolate truffles, dark rum, leather and pipe smoke. Coffee bitterness and roasted malt. Not too sweet.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and low alcohol presence. Coffee flavore dbitterness is nice, as is the overall chocolatey flavor profile. Carbonation is alive but not cloying.  Drinkability: Very nice.

T - Like the smell; dark fruits, roasty chocolate and alcohol character but also with a pretty noticeable smokiness. M - Quite full bodied with low to medium carbonation.

Deep roasted notes and a red wine-like drying bitterness come out in the finish. Medium-bodied and moderately carbonated. Nicely balanced.  Notes - A very approachable Russian Imperial Stout - it's warming but not overly heavy or bitter, and it still has plenty of character.

Smell is mostly roasted malt with hints of dark fruit such as raisins.  Taste is controlled by the roasted malt, slight bitter aftertaste from the roasted/burnt malt, assertive carbonation.

There was also some dark fruit like plum or raisin. No trace of alcohol.  Flavor is plummy, with an earthy roast that creeps out halfway through. Some carob or chocolate syrup, not exactly pure.

113,782,wagenvolks,4.21,"12 oz. bottle into a chalice.  First off, I love the elegantly tall Samuel Smith bottles. This particular bottle delivered a near-black body below a rising, 1"" brown head. The foam dwindled quickly to a thin layer, but that top film of bubbles never left, thanks in part to a continuous supply from the carbonation. Aroma was packed with a rich, malty sweetness backed by notes of black cherry, butterscotch, and rum.  The flavor was a bit buttery, but mostly chocolate notes prevailed. Some slight caramels and a choco-liquor rounded out the taste, and some bittering hops finished. The body was medium-thick, exceptionally smooth, and somewhat creamy. This isn't something I could drink every day, but the complexity, great taste, and overall classiness of the Sam Smith's Imperial Stout make it a truly drinkable ale.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Taste is of sweet malts up front and coffee waaaay in the back. A smooth sweetness ties the malts together. A bland banana (and possible other fibrous fruits like apple or pear, though considerably less than the banana, help make this RIS quite drinkable and complex.  Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy. Slightly lighter than an Old Rasputin, but otherwise pretty standard to above average.  A very good RIS. Sam Smith continues to produce somewhat controversial beers.

It smelled wonderfully rich and I knew before I had ever taken my first sip that I was in for a wonderful experience. This was the most complex beer that I have had up to this point, it was wonderful. I smelt and tasted roasted coffee and dark chocolate while I enjoyed this beer. I was expecting it to be a bit thicker than it was from the appearance but it's not a complaint. I was wondering how the 7% ABV would affect that taste but I have to say, while I did taste the alcohol, it added to the whole experience.

It's an excellent imperial stout, one of my favorites, and easily one of the best that Samuel Smith crafts. The head is rich in my 20 oz. mug. Although the aroma emanates a slightly syrupy air that was a little off-putting when I open it, that receded when I actually tasted it. The deep chocolate, caramel and coffee flavors are strong and balanced, with a terrific finish that leaves me wanting another. The 7.0 ABV is well hidden by the smooth taste and variety of flavors. It is a great sipping beverage for after dinner, though it went very well with my spicy chicken dish.

113,782,jmalex,4.41,"This is my second bottle of this, but my first was nearly a year ago. It will interesting to see how an English interpretation of a RIS compares to an American version.  APPEARANCE: Pours into a Samuel Smith imperial pint a deep black with a few amber brown highlights around the edges. A light tan loose-bubbled head forms on top and is at least 2 fingers high. It drops to a thick and hearty coating that doesn't want to go anywhere. Patchwork lacing snakes down the side of the glass as I drink. Simply a beautiful beer.  SMELL: Chocolate is at the forefront of this beer with roasty coffee not far behind. Caramel and toffee round out the big time malt aromas in this beer. A slight aroma of some noble hops come out slightly and blend wonderfully with the rich malty smells.  TASTE: Layers upon layers of flavor show themselves remarkably in this beer. Chocolate is certainly there, but it's highlighted by some lighter flavors of caramel and toffee just as in the nose. Roastiness is present but at lower levels than everything else. And all of this is draped over a bready base which I don't think I've ever tasted in an imperial stout before. The more bitter flavors come out during the finish in both hop character and some bitter black malt, but the sweetness of the beer carries through to the end making the finish rather balanced. As the beer warms, some vaguely fruity tones come out adding yet another layer of complexity.  MOUTHFEEL: Full bodied and only a hair syrupy. Carbonation level is on the lower side and spot on.  DRINKABILITY: It's strange to see an imperial stout disappear from my glass so quickly, but such are the benefits of drinking an English-style ale. The 7% ABV is hardly detectable at all. This beer is smooth all the way.  Wow. I knew this was a good beer, but I'm shocked at how much I enjoyed this. There is no fault in this beer at all.

Maybe the smell I picked up was just a variety of malts. Poured out with a thing head, and looked a bit lighter in terms of density compared to other stouts.

As it warmed it took on a slightly coffee-like smell. Taste was incredible, the first smell wasnt too impressive but boy was the taste. Very creamy and smooth texture to the drink. I can taste chocolate, coffee, raisin, a bit of the ""typical"" stout tastes (for me at least) but something about this one was incredible.

In the end I was left with a full glass with a short head that lasted almost the whole way down. As for the beer itself - it's just so damn smooth! Mouthfeel was creamy and finely carbonated, the alcohol doesn't really show up until the beer warms, and the flavor is just a nice roasty maltiness. Not too bitter, not too astringent like some imp stouts. Drinkability was exceptional for 7% ABV.

M/O: A medium to full body, not as viscous as other examples as this is only a mere 7% ABV. Though smooth at the same time. But considering the ABV, this has a surprising amount of heft to it as well. A good sipper.  An Imperial Stout that doesn't break 7% ABV is a bit of an anomaly for American examples of the style.

The sweetness is only brief in the front, but then turns bitter, and finishes a bit smoky. Mouthfeel was think, and ok. Drinkability is ok, but at the end of the glass it was getting hard to finish. Overall, I can see why people like this, its flavorful, and has a lot going on. For me however, I guess I don't like overly bitter stouts. I was disappointed because I am a huge fan of Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout. I will give this beer another chance, but for the price, I'll take their Oatmeal Stout over this one.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

S: Chocolate and caramel with hints of apples and maybe a little coffee, but not much. Pretty good smelling.  T: Slight alkaline taste initially. Lots of chocolate and roasted malt flavor make this a very good tasting beer. Fruit comes through second. Coffee becomes apparent only in the aftertaste as a nice bitter ending. A definite winner for this style.  M: Medium-bodied, barely astringent, and perfectly carbonated. Pretty dry.  D: A very drinkable brew - especially for the style.

S: Bready and grainy malts. Some bitter coffee smells along with dark, juicy fruits.  T/M: Sweet coffee and dark, bitter chocolate. Sweet, dark, juicy fruits... like a very juicy prune(I guess). Body is suprizingly light and higher in carbonation... Not a terribly bad thing but not exaclty what I was looking for in a RIS.  D: Body makes it drink very easy and it's a very tasty brew.

When you drink past the big head, you find a robust flavor, coffee, burnt toast, and a malty smoothness. Up front a bit sour, but overwhelmed by those sweet and dark flavors that linger.

More chocolate flavored than others of the style. With a plum like fruitiness. Medium bodied. Light but interesting for a RIS. Easily the most drinkable RID I've had. The best part is that it does not sacrifice flavor for drinkability. A must try.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Slatetank,4.92,"I am a fan of most Samuel Smiths beers, some of my first English ales that I tasted were from them. I decanted this cool into a tulip. A - Deep ebony w/ dark amber highlights. A thick 2.5 fingers of compact, pin sized tan bubbles crown the black fluid.  S - Rich odors of toffee, Port, vanilla, caramel and roasted nuts are concentrated in the aroma. Slight tinges of anise and berries round out the nose.  M - Roasted coffee, with light astringency, moderated carbonation and mild sweetness. Woody touches w/ a faint peppery spice.  T - Very concentrated dark malty and roasted tastes w/ a hint of smoke. A smooth rich toffee flavor w/ hints of bourbon and molasses w/ a nice vanilla cream taste and woody dry aspect. A toasted nut and rich dark chocolate flavor settles the char notes. Absolutely clean compared to the burst of malt and intense flavor as the stout becomes consumed.

113,782,Karyyk,4.21,"Until recently, South Carolina didn't allow the sale of beer with an alcohol content of more than 6% ABV. That limit was recently raised to 17.7% ABV, which means a lot of beers are now available here that could not have been sold previously. This would explain why I've never seen Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout before.  The beer pours an extremely dark and opaque black with about an inch of tan head. When held to a light, very little of it is going to get through this beer. What does reveals a slightly reddish hue, but generally speaking, this one is as black as night. The head disappears relatively quickly, and is particularly noticeable if you're used to some of the other Samuel Smith stouts (Taddy Porter & Oatmeal Stout).  I've never had an Imperial Stout before (showing my relative ignorance here), but judging on the score, this is a good one. This was probably one of the more drinkable stouts I've encountered, although the same can be said of all of the Samuel Smith stouts that I've had. The taste and mouthfeel is quite heavy and complex, but that's kind of the idea with a stout. One might even feel compelled to refer to this as a ""manly brew,"" which it most certainly is. The taste is hard to describe in layman's terms, but there are strong malt, licorice and coffee notes (I think a coffee drinker that dabbles into beer would especially like this). There's a good amount of sweetness to it as well, but nothing that overpowers the flavor of the beer. The term ""well-balanced"" is a good way to describe this one.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Limberg316,4.25,Excellent Imperial Stout if there ever was one! Smooth pour with an almost red tint through the light. Dark brown head that is tasty but disappeares very quickly.

Starts a little sweet, coffee grounds, bakers chocolate, fig, then finishes with a raisony wood like smokey finish with some licorice. Longest finish Ive tasted. Interesting to say the least.

The taste initially reminds me of drinking a deep dark red wine. I tend to wondering if this brew is oak aged. It is burned maltiness and finishes smooth. The mouthfeel is soft and stays in the upper and lower portion of the back of the mouth.

I pick up some dark fruits, possibly cherries and raisins. Hints of coffee, caramel, and chocolate. This is all very soft, it isn't extreme and in your face like many brews. Just subtle and to the point.  Taste is magic. Just like the smell it does a good job of using a great variety of flavor while keeping it all in perspective. Nothing huge going on and things just fall into place. An extremely balanced brew.  Mouthfeel is medium and creamy. Silky smooth. Not quite so thick as many RIS and very nice.  Drinkability scores a 5 in my book. This has about as much going on as its competitors without going overboard, making this very easy to drink. It's lighter than many as well, so it goes right down.

In the smell I get little hints of roast, sweet, alcohol, but nothing really hit me in the face. But, I've heard that balance is a good thing.  The taste is roasty at first, then sweet malt, but there's a slightly metallic taste at the end that hurts th overall impression just a bit.  The mouth feel is awesome.

Taste is very good: roasted malt up front, then spices, dried fruit (prunes) come through subtly. The bananas show up again as in the smell, some chocolate and a fair bit of breadiness. Feel is fairly good, full bodied with solid carbonation. This is a very good beer. It might actually be my least favorite RIS because the banana flavor sits there the whole drink and I wasn't really feeling it that much.

The taste is earthy, chocolaty with some mocha and coffee hints as well. This beer is quite pleasant and very interesting. Having just finished dessert this is quite the ""capper.""

I repeat, I'm new to Imperials, I'm trying Samuel with bitter and milk chocolate (bitter is better, milk leaves your mouth too mixed up), and walnuts (as suggested on the bottle), but for the next I will stick with stilton and walnuts ""gnocchi"", ending with a good italian espresso.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

The relatively high alcohol by volume of 7% is well modulated by all that other flavor action going on. It only makes itself felt in the inevitable warming action.This is one of the finest stouts I've ever had! I do like the label- apparently Samuel Smith is a contractor for Her Majesty's forces, though if I were with Her Majesty's forces in Iraq I would prefer something a little lighter- like a wit, a lager, or poison.

The alcohol gave a warming feeling to my mouth and throat. It's a nice winter Beer, but I'm not going to give it a rave review because of it's poor head retention. It looked beautiful at first with a lofty beige head, but it disappeared far too soon.  Overall Sam Smith's Imperial Stout is alright, and I would give it another chance sometime.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,dmamiano,4,"Found this one at a Thai restaurant in Las Vegas.I couldnt believe it either....they only had one in their half empty beer cooler. Anyway, the beer poured a deep brown, almost black with a wonderfull chocolate frothy head. A sight to behold. The nose was awesome...chocolate malt, almost a faint licorice tint to it. The mouthfeel was great, smooth fullness as I poured it on my tongue and the taste was true to style. Chocolate and biscuit notes with a slight coolness form alchohol from the finish",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,hckyfn9999,4.55,"Pours a dark black color with a nice brown head with good retention, that leaves a bit of lace. Aroma is of dark fruit, chocolate, and roasted malt. Taste is full of roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, dark fruit, a little nutty, a bit of smoke and alcohol, and rounds out with a bit of hops bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth and full bodied. This is a very easy drinker for the style.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Cresant,3.78,"Poured this 11.2 oz. clear bottle into a Samuel Smith tulip glass. No date noted. Creamy tan head rose to over three fingers. The body was dark browm with cola colored highlights. Stereotypical RIS.  Smell was of light sweetness. Steely. Apple skins. Later it was dead-on for chocolate aromas.  Taste was faint milk chocolate. Molasses-like sweetness, however, it was not too sweet. Rather refreshing for a RIS.  Mouthfeel was medium to thin in the body, and smooth in the texture.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,mikesgroove,3.88,"A - Poured a deep dark brown with a towering pillow like tan head. Cery nice retention, with a nice slow fade leaving just a film of a head on top. No real decent lacing though.  S - Smell was initially strong but mellowed some. Nice roasted malts, nutty smell, with lots of hints of caramel and sugar. A slight hoppy twang was present in the back of the aroma. A nice proper English type of smell if that makes any sense.  M & T - First impression was very smooth. Not overly carbonated, but not a bad thing. Not very thick, just very nice feel. Lots of caramel and roasted coffee flavors were the dominant tones here.  D - Overall this was a very nice, and very sessionable Impy Stout. It was not very robust, and would not stand up against some of the other heavyweights in its style. However, I feel it does have a nice place there as a good sessionable, not so outragously high ABV stout is always a welcome treat.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

113,782,montageman,4.3,"Poured into a pint glass. Appears to be pitch black, but when held up to the light it's more of a dark brown. There is a nice tan head that slowly leaves a ton of lacing. Smell is big on roasted coffee and chocolate, but it's a more nuanced smell and is very nice. Taste is sweet and chocolatey up front with a nice bitter/dry coffee finish. This tastes very much like a good chocolate bar. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy - there is slight carbonation, which functions well. This is a very drinkable stout - perfect as a dessert. Highly Recommended.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,taez555,4.54,"This beer poured a pitch black body with a small white/tan head.  Nose is in your face with that beautiful classic Sammy Smith fruity/metallic smell. Soft milk chocolate, cocoa powder, pure liquid caramel, pears, dark prunes, liquid sugar, sweet (backwoods cigars) type tobacco, mild vanilla and a very faint alcohol nip. For such an in your face nose it has this overwhelming muted note to it like it's been aged for a while and has lost some of it's bite. Still.... a splendid nose that I could smell for hours without taking a sip.  Taste is medium to full bodied. Dark roasted malts dominate with a smooth dark chocolate and fireplace brick mild smoke note. Dark chocolate, brown bread, prunes, plums, dark raisins, old coffee, pear juice with a mild coarseness. There's a subtle minty and citrus peel hop flavor combined with a present but mellow and balanced bitterness. An alcohol warmth picks up as the beer takes hold. It finishes with a lingering bitterness and course chalkiness.  Another fabulous beer from Tadcaster. A little more dense and a bit less drinkable that the Oatmeal or Taddy Porter, but still a top notch beer that ranks as easily one of the best Stouts out there.

I pulled some perfume and herb scents out of this, and almost didnt drink it past the first sip. It grew a bit on me. Just a bit, though. medium to full body, and quite velvety for being so, let this beer afect various areas of the palate.

113,782,wanker,3.9,"Pours black with a small but attractive head.  Very sweet taste with mild hops. Almost as sweet as a milk stout. I was expecting more hops in an imperial stout. Strong dark stewed fruit flavors. Reminded me of prune juice, which is not bad; I like prune juice.  Slippery mouthfeel. I would prefer more carbonation.  Tasty for sure, but not at the level of Victory Storm King. I found it a bit unbalanced in the malt direction. I think a bit more hop would help.  Highly drinkable, though.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Appearance: Pours a jet black with a massive foamy brown cap that stays for eternity, leaving tons of lacing.  Aroma: Nose is dominated by hints of sweetened chocolate and roasted organic coffee beans and fresh baked bread. Also get some floral hops.  Taste: Quite sweet. Very chocolatey, with strong whiff of bitter coffee in the finish. Some caramel and grass. Moderate bitterness, definately a sweeter RIS.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and rich, not it's strongest point, but drinkability is pretty high.  Final Statement: Definately a winner. A good & sweet RIS from a very respectable brewery. This is my favorite of the their brews, and will definately seek out regularly.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Atlas1,4.14,"Man, this really takes me back. The first time I ever tried Sammy Smiths I was in college over ten years ago. My buddies and I were convinced that there was simply nothing like it on earth. We were right.  Pours a nice deep black color with a dark brown head. Hints of ruby red shine through at the edges when held up to the light. A pretty beer, but nothing spectacular for a stout. Very little head retention or lace. The bouquet here is special, though. Rich aroma of both dark fruits (plum, prune, raisins) and apples and bananas. Makes me think of a few weizenbocks I've had, but it's a sweeter aroma than most stouts out there, imperial or not. The taste is also a bit sweet with the aforementioned fruits. Sweet and tangy up front, with a smooth mellow middle, and a remarkably sweet (tart?) and bitter finish. Presents a smoky aftertaste, which I was not expecting but really like. Very sturdy mouthfeel. Overall, this is an imperial stout done right. But then again, this beer was winning gold medal awards at competitions back in 1896, so it's not like the lads at Sam Smiths are new at this. Keep up the good work, and thanks for this beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,schusterbauer,5,"of course there's no answer to the ""favorite beer"" question. forced to make a decision though, this would definitely be in contention.  more burnt brown than black, with highlights of mahogany, and a small staid head. perhaps my perception of its appearance is tainted by my knowledge of what comes next, but if that's the case, then so be it. smell is of barely warm brownies, prune juice, walnuts, liqueur, coffee. taste is a haphazard (in a good way) blend of the same flavors, along with burnt brown sugar, chocolate covered raisins, charcoal, and fig pudding. subtle and refined in the mouth -- not harsh, bruising, or daring like the american interpretations. inviting, and warming. pleasingly inebriating. drink a couple and you'll be singing.  i've drinken this from snifters, pint glasses, and (gasp!) straight from the bottle -- it's always fantastic. an obsession.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Everything explodes on the palate without overpowering any individual flavor. The caramel and fruits are nicely balanced with the hops and everything works very well together.

The aroma is a mix of roasted malts, and light raisins. The taste is light coffee, a little roasted malt, and a good amount of, what tastes like raisins. Thick mouthfeel, with a smooth finish. Overall, I wasnt really impressed with this stout. I've tried a few other RIS, but this one just didnt measure up. Its not a bad beer, but for the style, It was a let down, but then again, maybe I just got a bad batch.

113,782,kajerm,4.03,"Poured into a unibroue snifter with an absolutely monstrous tan head-- creamy, with heavy foam and massive lacing. it's black and totally impermeable to light. this beer is pretty.  The nose is heavy on coffee, with a background of dark malt and maybe a little nonspecific fruit. There's a buttery, kind of funky yeasty note, which I like.  Tastes somewhat sweet and surprisingly dry on the finish. Coffee notes are present, but much lighter than I expected. Subsequent sips reveal a yeasty banana flavor. Heavy carbonation lends a sort of spiciness, and adds a lot of drinkability.  The mouthfeel is heavy and creamy, finishing with substantial carbonation. The low ABV (as compared to American versions of the style) and bubbles make this a very very drinkable imperial stout. There is nothing (other than respect) that would prevent me from pounding these.  RERATE: Went back to this with more imperial stout experience under my belt. The apparearance is still outstanding, especially the head size, retention, and lacing. Smellwise, I'm not sure what the hell I was talking about (""buttery/funky/yeasty note""), I was probably talking about the vanilla character, which is pretty strong. The taste is smokier than most imps I've tasted, but production of this is too high for it to be barrel-aged; it must be the malts. This is really a pretty damned good imperial stout.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

T: Finely roasted coffee and bitter dark chocolate with ever the slightest hop presence. Sweetness of molasses is followed by a perfectly balanced caramel malt intrusion. Dark fruit and a slight smoked earth finish.  M: Rich and creamy. Silky smooth. Minimal carbonation. Slighly astrigent and drying finish.  D: A tasty treat that has all of the flavor of the bigger Imperial stouts that I have tried but without the huge alcohol presence.

The taste on this stout is excellent. very sweet early and as it moves further back on the tongue the malts really start to show, then it recedes to a sweet finish that leaves a nice bitter coffee aftertaste, that lingers.

Chocolate and alcohol notes as well. All aspects are increasing as it warms.  Taste is as wonderfully complex as I'd imagine an imperial stout should be. First 3 things that I notice are plums, coffee, and raisins. There's another, more muted fruit taste here that I'm thinking is apple. Pleasantly sweet, with an underlying roasty and almost smoky malt presence. Alcohol is unobtrusive but there - added to the general sweetness and a a touch of bittering hops it makes for a nice finish.  Despite a mouthfeel thinner than many of the style, I had no problem picking out flavors as this beer flowed across my tongue and finished dry. Carbonation is on the light side of medium for the style, but I recall previous samples with a greater, and in my opinion less appropriate, carbonation level. As I near the bottom of the glass I notice the alcohol in the mouth a lot more.  I find I am grateful that this is a 7% ABV beer. It is difficult to sip this great beer - put this taste on one of those 11% ABV monsters and we'd be in trouble!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Pours a thick and very creamy tan head of about three fingers which takes a considerable amount of time to dissolve, leaving a fine lace of foam on top.  Smell: Big rich malty dark chocolate, roasted coffee and toffee. Unfortunately there is a small hint of alcohol under these aromas, big not enough to really harm the smell.  Taste: This is why I think this could be the perfect Imperial Stout. The taste is balanced better than any other imperial I've had the pleasure of drinking. The big dark chocolate and coffee flavors came across first, however enough hops are present to give the taste a little zing, keeping this brew from drinking like molasses. This mixed with the heavy malt of the brew gave me a light taste of oats  Mouthfeel: Very thick of course, almost no acidity and surprisingly only a light amount of carbonation.  Drinkability: For a stout this has a smooth finish that is almost unequaled. Add that to the magnetic flavor and in my opinion you have one of the only imperial stouts you could gulp if wanted.

Gorgeous amazing black beer with a perfectly colored short tan head.  The aroma hit my nose as soon as I opened the bottle. Lots of toasted maltiness.  The flavor, oh the flavor, frankly it is indescribable. A perfect pairing of glorious bitterness, super dark chocolate with some very slightly fruity notes (along the lines of some 85% cacoa chocolate I had recently that had the same strange fruity notes).

The appearance was a dark brown hue with a 4 inch frothy mocha head. The head fully lasted and left a great amount of lacing. The scent of roasted malt, caramel and mild coffee added to its complexity. Found it to start moderately sweet with a coffee and chocolate aftertaste that was right on. The medium to full body added a creamy yet slightly syrupy feel on the palate. The soft carbonation and light alcohol feel rounded out the taste and feel just perfectly. Overall, she would drink a six pack easily, although I think they come in a four pack. I do have to admit that I got a few sips in, but that was it.

Good solid tan head that has a lot of staying power. Not much lacing tho.  Aroma- Lots of malt sweetness, with a stong undertone of mollassas. Some chocolate overtones to if you let it warm a bit.  Taste- Amazing. The 1st thing you taste is the alcohol. Kind of strange for an imperial stout. This isn't an old ale afterall. Nice blend of malt sweetness and bittering hops. Neither are overpowering at all. Some chocolate and roasted grain. You can really taste it at the back of your mouth.  Mouthfeel- Just a tad thin for the style, but very good overall. Very good carbonation level. Just enough to allow it to dance over your toungue, but not so much that it hides the flavors.  Drinkability- More drinkable than most RISs. Certainly not sessionable, but hey...it ain't supposed to be.

Pours an opaque black with a small amount of medium brown head which dissipates rapidly, leaving little to no lacing.  Aroma is sweet prunes, plums, and indicates higher alcohol that the bottles indicates.  Taste is some sweet fruit, perhaps prunes, a slight bit of chocolate, some roastiness. Definitely thin for the style. A distinct metallic taste from the medium taste all the way through the finish and aftertaste really detracts from everything else; this is something I've noticed in Samuel Smith's oatmeal stout as well.  Mouth is relatively tingly with carbonation, lingers, light to medium physical body.  As disappointing as all the times I've had this beer before.

S- Big chocolate malt smell almost dominates the rest of the aroma. Maybe some light grass hops in there also? Also a hint of something like milk more like milk chocolate though. T- Chocolate taste. Some light flavor hops leaves a nice bitterness on the tongue which linger into the aftertaste. Some roasted malts are also in there too. Also a kind of creamish taste to it too. M- Medium to full body. Medium carbonation. D- It is good just not a really big imperial stout. It is a decent brew though.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

The foam fades slowly to a thick ring around the surface leaving behind quite a bit of lace patterns on the side of the glass. An aroma of roasted malt, smoke, nuts, peat and coffee floats over the beer.  Each sip of this medium to full bodied beer is smooth and silky with a soft carbonated tingle on the tip of the tongue. The flavor is an intense combination of roasted malt, smoke, peat, and coffee. At the end a few fruity notes of plum and raisins poke through. It finishes mildly bitter with just enough hops to balance out the malt.  I thought the mouthfeel was a tad bit thin and aroma a bit weak.

Taste - I have to give this beer a high mark; the beer went very well with the hot buffalo strips..Faintly sweet, absolutely no bitterness, beer felt unforced. Lots of roasted coffee and chocolate, but the flavors aren't overwhelming.  Drinkability - The beer is definitely drinkable, but its an expensive brew. I wouldn't get bored of the brew for awhile, but I would take other beers over it if money was not a factor.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,mmcave,4.15,"Poured into nonic, nice almost completely opaque, pitch-black body except for ruby high lights behind a lamp, with tan like off white head that lingers about a centimeter off the surface. Smells of nutty chocolate, slightly buttery, toasted malt, notes of coffee, berries, slight sweet raison, plum mix and a tiny little hint of vanilla buried under every thing else. Flavor is very complex some bitter coffee with a subtle yet enduring sweetness, rich coffee, chocolate finish not cloying, some sherried raisins and fruit. Slightly milky and oily, flavor all around, not too thick tasty stout to be savored. I find that with most RIS they demand attention to their subtlety, in order to be properly enjoyed and this is no exception. Delicious, maybe not my favorite, but absolutely worth enjoying.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,mpyle,4.07,"Small tight head, tan in color. Head retention decent. Color very dark (almost opaque) but with red tints. Clarity looks good.  Plum, raisin, and some diacetyl (butterscotch) smells. Complex esters highly appropriate to the style. No hop aroma.  Big hit of dark malt flavor and fruity character (mainly plum) up front. Some alcohol taste evident, but not overpowering. Some sherry-like oxindation notes, which don't harm this style.  Fullish body and smooth despite the subtle warming alcohol presence. No astringency, carbonation subdued. Very nice mouthfeel.  A flavorful big but not overpowering stout. Fruity and complex, but possibly not at its peak of freshness (clear bottle can't help!) Alcohol is well controlled, allowing the malt and yeast by products to shine through.

113,782,msubulldog25,4.2,"Poured this 550ml (clear glass) bottle into a standard pint and shared sips with my wife...  A: Pours dark as a moonless night with only hints of burgundy/cherry tints when held to a strong light. Crowned with a gigantic 4-finger ivory head, frothy and dense. The head fades very slowly, at least 1-finger of cream remains 15 minutes after the pour.  S: Lots of sweet milk chocolate and smoky malt. Other aromas of wood, rum raisins, and berries. A very cherry-like sweet smell rises when agitated after a few minutes of warming.  T: Malty and chocolate-laden, with a husky smokiness and a bit of herbal/bitter hopping in the finish. Tasted something like oatmeal cookies and dried cherries at times. Pretty darn tasty...  M: The only dissapointment I found in this beer was its thinner than expected mouthfeel. Body is about ""medium"" and mouthfeel seems about the same initially, but both weaken over time. Some mild sour sharpness mingles with the chocolate maltiness lingering in the aftertaste.  D: Overall, a really nice balance, terrific flavors and almost sessionable drinability. Lighter-bodied and quite a bit less heavy than some of my favorite US-made Imperial Stouts; regardless the Sam Smith has its strong points in smell, appearance & flavor - I'd recommend this one and would get this again.

113,782,JudgeRoughneck,3.21,"RE-reviewed November 2015 -  APP - black with ruby highlights, brilliant clarity, large bubbled mocha head fades fast and leaves thin but persistent ring.  Aroma -raisin, fig, jam, iron, all medium intensity. Fig is standout. Low herbal hop, medium-low caramel, medium plus acetlaldehyde / white grape / iron Sam Smith house character. Possibly a small amount of diacetyl, bright roasted barley aroma is medium-high, with a wet coffee-ground note on the backend. No alcohol. Sounds messy but is enticing.  Flavor - White grape ester is huge, and only slightly out-competes acetlyaldehyde. Fresh plum ester is medium-low, herbal hop flavor is medium, malt sweetness is very low if present at all, roasted malt flavor is medium-high but oddly flat and not at all astringent, low level smokiness emerges with warmth, as does faint anise in the finish, which is unexpectedly short and dry. Again, no alcohol. No noticeable bitterness.  MF- medium-full bodied with medium-low carbonation, again strangely flat on the palate. No astringency no velvet, none of the mouth-filling sensations one expects from an imperial.  Overall - very British, not really a stand out among RIS, but might be lovely example of Baltic Porter. Odd little beer.    Appearance- Pitch black with a thin but tenacious layer of espresso to chocolate milk colored head.  Smell- Dark fruit, dark chocolate, dark rum,hop spice, deep caramel, brown sugar, and a hint of sweet wort. Pretty great smell but I wish it was stronger.  Taste- Starts out with a strong roasted coffee character, then dark chocolate, then spicy/earthy hop bitter clears the way for a finish of burnt coacoa, and roasted grain bitter. The finish is much better than it sounds I promise. Some more of that earthiness in the aftertaste. A nugat tone comes out with warmth. Later I get a bit of black cherry. This isn't super-complex but it is exactly what I expect Imperial Stout to taste like. Rich, but more bitter than sweet, and dark as midnight.  Mouthfeel- Hefty but far from oppressive. Chewy.  Drinkability- Barely a hint of booze anywhere definately helps.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Aroma is heavenly, notes of dark chocolate and toasted marshmallow (mmm...s'mores anyone?). Alcoholic/bourbon-like. Slight vanilla and oak.  Flavor is somewhat disappointing. The first few sips there was a slight stale cardboardiness. Rather acidic/metallic when cold but notes of chocolate, fig and anise as it warms. Slightly nutty, hints of almond. Hot/alcoholic. At the beginning I noted that it felt rather coarse. Too bubbly and burnt and a little thin for the style.  Overall, not one of my favorite representations of the style. I realize these guys have been doing this a long time and they obviously know what they're doing but i thought this beer was just average at best.

113,782,EPseja,2.71,"Served from a 12oz (clear!) bottle in a Samuel Smith imperial pint glass at just below cellar temperature.  A - Pours a medium chestnut brown color with raspberry highlights that disappear once the brew hits the glass. The head is creamy and big, with a medium bodied cocoa color and excellent staying power. Lacing is decent, with spotty hanging crags, but doesn't hang around long.  S - Dry chocolatey winelike notes. Tasted vanilla. Unscented candle wax. Light molasses and soy sauce.  T - Almost burnt maltiness and a sweet molasses and coffee start. The middle brings about a touch of fragrant hoppiness and a nasty flick of shopping bag plastic. The end is drying and nicely bittered, but the plastic notes really disappoint.  M - A bit watery and bright for the style, although it does round out after some frothing in the mouth. Swallow is average.  D - As I near the 1/3 point of this beer, I can't seem to get away from the plastic and soy qualities. It's not that they're monstrous, it's just that they distract from all the good points about the beer.

The appearance was a nice viscous dark ebony with a frothy brown head. A strong earthy herbal quality to nose complimented the carbonation levels. The taste contained aspects of herbal cough drop flavors, mildly sweet with malts and licorice dominating the coffee undertones.

Rich on the palate, with chocolatey-sweet flavors, with a pruny sort of fruitiness. Tiny amounts of astringency and bitterness keep it from being sickly sweet. Alcohol barely registers. Slightly sticky on the finish, which lingers and surprises with its intensity after such a smooth mouthful.  A sweet, rich, meal-in-itself (or more appropriately, dessert-in-itself) stout. Not as roasted and coffee-dominated as some others. Definitely a once-in-a-while, after-dinner sort of thing for me.

The taste is equally complex, starting with a malty chocolate start that finishes hoppy and leaves a slight taste of alcohol on the palate.

Taste and Mouthfeel: Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel. The roastiness and chocolate/coffee come through first and never really go away. The ale dark fruitiness comes in along with a very subdued hop presence. Just enough to make things interesting. Nice sweetness, as the roasted flavors carry on through the delicious finish.

113,782,dblinkhorn,3.7,"Poured from a 550ml bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance - Pours with a two-finger dark tan head that is creamy and has decent retention. It eventually evaporates to a thin film of patchy head with a ring of thin head around the glass edge. Good lacing is left as you drink. It is opaque black in color.  Smell - Caramel, coffee, milk chocolate, burnt sugars and molasses up front. Some slightly bitter hops behind this with a very, very rich roasted malt aroma. Some mild earthiness way in the back with slight grain and/or oat smells as well. Very little alcohol is detectable on the nose.  Taste - Coffee and chocolate up front. Some burnt sugar, molasses, and caramel take a further seat back than in the aroma. Oily and rich hops with slight bitterness just behind these flavors. Rich bready and roasted malts and grain form the foundation of the flavors, with a warming alcohol throughout. You can detect the alcohol much more in the taste than in the smell. The aftertaste has a lot of earthy notes and some slightly sour hop notes.  Mouthfeel - A bit too lively carbonation for the style, in my opinion. I prefer my stouts (or any full-bodied beers) to be minimally carbonated. However it has a very smooth mouthfeel overall.  Drinkabilty - Pretty strong flavors, although a bit less than most of the Russian Imperial stouts I've had lately. A few pints of this stuff would be no problem, and it would actually make a decent sessioning stout.  A good stout. I think it lacked some richness of flavor in the middle or the taste, but it is still quite good. It has a pleasant warming alcohol character that is perfect on those chilly evenings.

It lived up to it's billing and I made me myself a mental note to review it. Well, here I am now, reviewing this beer. Yep, here I am...one year later...in anticipation...on to the review!  Pours black ebony, two fingers of viscous espresso head that holds up well producing clinging lacing of substantial millage (Lastings Milledge?).  Smells like roasted grains, apples, brown sugar, chocolate, prunes and black tar, dried fruit.  Tastes of apples, chocolate, prunes and black tar; molasses, sugar, alcohol, dried fruit - dates; fruitcake. The apple lingers with some pleasant bitterness.  Slick mouthfeel with smooth tingling of carbonation. Clingy and chewy.  Drinkability? I don't know...yes???  I'm no expert, but I love this beer. It's like a national treasure that you know will always be there - like the tomb of Lord Nelson (he is buried in a tomb, isn't he?). I think anyone who loves a good stout or IPA can be considered a true beer lover, even if they can't articulate why in a precise or artistic fashion.

Toffee notes, cherries, molasses, chocolate pudding, salt water taffy, etc in the taste. Very complex and so damn tasty.  Mouthfeel is a tad thin but with the perfect amount of carbonation.

The fruity vinousness is reminiscent slightly of shiraz, but also of the flavors found in chocolate over 70 percent. The taste, which I didn't get to until the glass spent some time warming, is vinous, molasses-filled, very roasted, and excellent. Sweet in the start, but leaves a coffee aftertaste, very dry.

Scattered spots of lacing are left all around the glass. Smell is of plums, raisins, molasses, roasty malts, cream, baker's chocolate, English toffee, slight butterscotch, anise, and mild coffee with dusty notes of wood. Taste is of the mentioned aromas highlighted by a fruity, prune and raisin flavor that mixes creamed coffee and roasted oats with a touch of caramelized sugar that borderlines the path of cloying but remains along the spectrum of balance. Mouthfeel is rich, medium-full bodied, slight thinness like the OG started off very high but was watered down to make the volume greater. The brew starts off sweet at first with roasted malt sticking in the middle of the tongue.before fading to a gently hopped, semi-dry roastiness. All in all, this is a British classic that shouldn't be missed.

The nose is somewhat deceptive, as it's just fairly mild roasted malt. The palate, however, is much bolder than the nose. It's not a complex beer, with predominantly heavily roasted malt and a touch of bitter coffee shining through. The very definition of an Imperial Stout. The mouthfeel is suitably thick to match it's opaque appearance. No beer this black could be as thin as a lager. Thankfully, all the best parts of the flavor stick around as a result. It's quite an exceptional stout. Flavorful, yet no one aspect overpowers the brew. If only it weren't so filling, it would easily be a session beer based on the merits of it's flavor.

A slight sourness in there as well along with a bittersweet chocolate to finish. As this beer warms it seems like I can almost pick up green apple. Smells better the warmer it gets.  I pick up a lot of flavors and none of them are subtle. They all stand out. There's coffee, burnt malts, roasted malts and a dry slightly bitter finish. As it warms there's a slight alcohol warming in my nose and throat.  Mouthfeel is more on the heavy side. Somewhat coarse going down. Heavily coats my mouth when I drink. Feels pretty dense.

113,782,CharlieMopps,4.67,"550 ml  A: Extremely dark brown body, if not completely black. Half-inch head w/ decent retention, tawny/dark khaki foam. Nice and frothy.  S: Coffee-like aroma with a nice toasty malt & slightly fruity scent due to the hops' contrast. Pleasing to the olfactory senses.  T & M: Amazing. Very excellently balanced taste, especially the 7.0% ABV not overpowering the variety of flavor. Smooth introduction, almost sharp and citrusy middle, followed by a refreshing finish that washed away leaving the best chocolatey toasted malt sensations on the palate, that does not become bland or dull at all.  D: The ABV may make it a bit tough to drink round after round in immediate succession, but given a proper sessioning, a few of these could last all night if apportioned properly.   Already being a fan of Sam Smith products, I may be a bit biased. But this is my first encounter with the Imperial Stout and I'm greatly delighted by the discovery. I can't say enough good things about this beer. With a bit of intriguing complexity in regards to the hops, it doesn't stray too far in balancing the taste with a deep toasted malt side and this makes for an awesome combination, without sitting too heavily on the stomach. Great beer. Period.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Rudgers73,4.03,"Drank from the bottle at a bar in Pittsburg.  A- I didn't know the bottle was clear until I drank some of it down. This stuff is deep dark brown, almost black. A little bit of head consisting of big bubbles that are thick and stay put around the edges.  S- Deep dark malty and burnt. Sweet notes that give a toffee feel to it. Very bold.  T- Nice and smooth. Well balanced toffee, charcoal and burnt hops. Well done.  M- Thick and chewy, not much bubble-action. Nice to sip on, not to pound.  D- Good beer to just hang out with. 2-3 would be a nice dessert for me, not any more though, too thick.  I walked into this bar and asked for a victory storm king stout and they didnt have it (amongst their collection of over 200 beers) so I asked for their dirtiest stout and they handed me this.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,burnstar,4.25,"Pours black with a nice thick head which leaves a little lace. Smell is sweet, dark roasted malts, perhaps a bit of chocolate as well. Taste is heavy roasted sweetness, coffee note, plenty of english hops. Very nice and balanced with big flavor. Simultaneously leaves a nice lingering sweetness and bitterness. Pretty thick in the mouth, creamy. A very solid stout.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Smells of chocolate, coffee, molasses, banana, apple, fig jam, prunes, raisins, roasted nuts, milk.Very rich and slightly sweet smell - complex, and very pleasant.  Full flavored and very enjoyable. Sweetness and roastiness are very well balanced. Coffee and banana most of all, with cocoa, dark fruits, lactic sourness. Very roasty without quite tasting burnt. Finishes pretty dry and sour, with some dark rum alcohol and roasty bitterness.  Smooth, creamy mouthfeel  This is aggressive, yet balanced and very enjoyable (unless you're a lactic acid hater). Good beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,akahn,4.58,"Pours a nearly black brown color, red-tinged, with a surprisingly fluffy, full, lasting head, along with some beading. 5  Subtle but fantastic aroma. Very creamy, milk chocolatey, and a hint of soy sauce, but that we can blame on the Indian grocery where I bought this. After it sits, I pick up a hint of vanilla extract, very unusual and very nice. Reminiscent of their Oatmeal Stout.  Flavor is sublime. Tastes super authentically English, and actually a less subtle version of their Oatmeal Stout. Still, this is a very subtle beer, much subtler than any I've had from this style. Very smooth in texture, yet with a surprising degree of carbonation. Round, slightly sweet malt, along with chocolate flavors. This fades to a slightly bitter burnt flavor, a bit of mineral flavor and it ends fairly dry. Impeccable. I wasn't expecting this beer to live up to its hype but it really did.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,BeerSox,4.33,"Pours deep opaque black iwth a dark tan head. Sticky lacing. The color of the head almost matches gold foil on the neck of the bottle.  Deep molasses scents swirl with roasted notes. Warm alcohol is also present. The sweet smells almost coat the nose. Scents gradually become smoother and sweeter as the beer warms. Very faint fruity aromas start to emerge.  Stars off with flavors similar to black roasted coffee then slowly shofts to hop bitterness. Warm alcohol can be toasted throughout. Hoppiness tends to stick to the back of the mouth well after your sip.  Full bodied with medium carbonation. Very complex flavors and end with a dry finish.  A very enjoyable beer, especially for the winter. I like to treat this style like a brandy, tasting it in a snifter and letting it warm and swirl in my hand, which enhances the volatiles. Very well rounded and complex. Recommended.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Smelt of burnt molasses and some fruit.  Taste was sweet molasses upfront followed by fruity esters, bitter roast and lingering vanilla sweetness, with the finish mostly bitter and a hint of mushroom.

113,782,RedChrome,4.08,"Pour produced an absolutly black colored beer. A nice fluffy two inch head was a light brown color which stayed a decent period of time. No carbonation can be seen through the color of the beer. Lacing down the entire glass.  A fantastic aroma of roasted chocolate malt. Subtle notes of roasted peanuts. A second whiff also brought out a slight scent of coffee grounds. A slight hint of alcohol causes a bit of a burn in the nose.  The first sip was a nice chocolate taste. A second blend of coffee flavor reminds me of drinking a cappuccino with a shot of chocolate sryup. A nice roasted malt aftertaste brings a bite of alcohol which balances out the sweetness of the chocolate and malt.  A very thick body helps the flavors hang on all surfaces of the mouth. A minor amount of carbonation provides just enough of a feel in the mouth to be enjoyable without being overbearing.  A top notch beer. A fantastic blend of sweet and bitter flavors with just the right amount of balancing alcohol taste. A perfect dessert beer.

Glad I put this beer in the snifter.  T: Begins very rich and malty. Mocha, surprisingly smokey and rummy. Hints of caramel, marshmallow, vanilla bean and raisins.

Red wine depths, with chocolate and coffee overtones. Little bit of hops at the back. This one is a bit syrupy for me, though, I imagine a draft might smooth her out a bit.

First sip is tangy hops, a flash of herbal bitterness and dusty cocoa powder, quickly followed by a sweet malt, roasted, toasted and round. Raisins, caramel.The sweetness lingers. Alcohol shows up and buzzes around the tongue, but it's not too forward. Bitterness returns, but this time dry and citric, slowly sliding towards a cocoa and dark fruit aftertaste. Jeepers.

Smell is a bit light, with chocolate and dark fruits apparent, but a bit of an off note too, likely due to the clear bottle. How a brewery of Samuel Smith's tradition and repute could even think about clear glass is beyond me, but I digress. Taste gets back on track. Rich and full, with a heavy fruitiness containing notes of cherry, plum, and raisin coming alongside burnt chocolate and a lovely hint of brandy and port wine.

Taste: wow, that's good. lots of complexity, picking out individual flavors is going to be tougher than usual: slightly sweet/fruity at the tip of the tongue, bitterness in the middle. some caramel character. dark fruit finish, resolving to a dry, bitter aftertaste. very enjoyable. this is a stout where the bitterness is from hops, not burnt grain. it's roast, but not charred. surprisingly fruity, maybe that's because it's an english rather than american yeast.

Not like some of the other recent imperial stouts that blow your tounge off with hops, this was a good balance.

113,782,instrumentality,4.38,"I have developed a fear of Samuel Smith's beers, especially the Oatmeal Stout, due to the fact that I've had some really rancid samplings of it. It's been suggested that this is because of the clear glass bottle and the lack of light filtering, which makes sense to me. However, I do know that Sam Smith is capable of good things when their sensitive beers survive the rough journey from their brewery to my stomach.  I pulled this one from the fridge and let it breathe for about 10-15 minutes before pouring it. I'm hard-pressed to give a beer a 5 on anything, but this beer just looked awesome as it made its way into my pint glass: a dark brown, almost black, absolutely refusing to let any light through, and with a nice thick brown foam head made up of thousands of perfectly spaced little bubbles that started out filling up more than half the glass and then settled down to about 3/4"" and stopped there, taunting me.  I have trouble describing this kind of smell, but to me, it's a mix of cocoa, coffee, and red wine. I love it, but it's a bit intimidating.  ...And that's pretty much how it tastes. I taste the red first, then a bit of cocoa, and then it settles into the pleasingly bitter aftertaste of black coffee. I love the balance on this - the flavor changes from one moment to the next, but no one flavor overpowers the others. I guess that means this one survived the journey.  My idea of good mouthfeel is something that isn't too flat or too carbonated and in which I can taste the alcohol but not so much that it burns my palate. The other main factor I consider is whether it leaves any funky residue behind, like the skunky hops left on my tongue by some IPA's. This one accomplished what I wanted as far as mellow carabonation and only the slightest burn. My only criticism is that it did leave a hint of sourness/tartness on the roof of my mouth, somewhat like what I experience from certain very dry red wines...is that tannins? Nothing major, though.  I was tempted to start chugging, but I made a Herculean effort to take my time and see how the beer changed as it warmed. More intense, easier to taste the alcohol, still good but not really improved. This one is strong but surprisingly easy to drink.  Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout exceeded my expectations significantly. It tasted fresh, the flavors transition made my taste buds happy, and it was surprisingly easy to drink for the style. I still have about half of it left am I'm already starting to buzz a bit, but not wanting to get too faded is the only thing stopping me from gulping the rest down in the next 2 minutes.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,BeerNutta,4.48,Samuel Smith Imperial Stout  A = Poured dark black with a thin foam head that quickly dissapates to nothing.  S = Smells of sweet maple syrup with hints of coffee and dark chocolate. Very inviting.  T = Very port like. Smooth coffee taste with a fine dark chocolate notes. There is slightly sour finish with a small hint of alcohol. But still very very smooth.  M = Medium bodied with low cabonation so you can really taste the flavours in the stout.  D = Very drinkable.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Freshie,4.73,"Classic large bottle. Old style label, with ""Contrated to her Majesty's Forces"", which I am not sure entirely what that means, but it sounds like it's good enough for QE2, so I guess it's good enough for me.  Dark as hell with tan creamy head. Just emaculate.  Smelled of fruit, hops, and coffee.  Tasted much like it smelled. Very smooth coffee flavour balances with floral hops bittierness. Went down well with the cheeseburger that I had for my dinner. Hints of chocolate and citrus.  Unlike other Russian Imperials I have had, this stuck to it's genre, but it does it o so well. Not bland in the least bit, but also, doesn't over extend itself in flavour.  Wow  Cheers!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,klewis,4.86,"355 ml bottle  A: Pours jet black with a modest tan head. Very little lacing.  S: Aromas of roasted espresso beans and burnt marshmellows from the campfire. Totally unique.  T: Roasted, burnt, earthy kind of flavors with coffee undertones. Totally smooth-as-silk flavor with little, if any, bitterness.  M: Medium bodied for a RIS, but understandably so for the ABV. Soft carbonation and a sticky texture make it a winner.  D: Overall, I don't think that this one is as quite as good as many other big stouts (Stone, Rogue, Victory, etc.), but this one is utterly enjoyable and earns points with me because of its uniqueness. Absolutely a must try.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,MuenchenerKindl,4.23,"Poured from a 11.2 oz bottle to a SS tulip glass. Very impressive three finger head of mocha. Nice retention fading to a fine lace.  The Smell is of alcohal and deep dark roasted malt with licorice and a faint note of dark roast espresso.  The taste follows the smell with the alcohol taste not living up to the billing of the smell (thats good). Espresso taste is much stronger helping to cover any offensiveness by the alcohol. Semi sweet, not very bitter, coffee seems to also cover other tastes. Some notes of dark chocolate & licorice. Big plus- No funny stale alcohol after taste like a lot of this beers peers.  Mouthfeel is surprisingly medium, kind of watery while drinking for this thick rich style, however it does coat nicely also low carbonation.  Drinkabitity is surprisingly high as this beer does not offend.  Drink up Johny! MK",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

I approach this one with some trepedation however because everything i've tried from Sammy Smith's has been not exactly too my taste...they all have kind of an earthy, sour taste that's slightly off-putting and makes my stomach hurt a bit. Anyway...  pours fine. looks dark and not all that thick, but then its not all that heavy as RIS's go so i wasn't expecting a sludgy pour. nice solid head. Odor is quite fruity with plums and not-well-hidden alcohol. not a fantastic nose. Taste is fairly complex. Fruity up front with that pluminess, then it becomes more of a sweet, slightly roasted chocolate taste, followed by ... uh oh .... that peaty sourness that i dont like and i alwasys get from S.Smith. This kind of gets lost late as the drinking progresses, but its hard to ignore at first. Mouthfeel is a little thin for this type of beer i thought too. I'm a bit dissapointed overall considering the high BA rating, but oh well. maybe i just don't like the original brit version of the Russian Imperial Stout.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

More stewed fruit in the mouth, with some caramel and faint roasted notes becoming apparent closer to the finish. A bit of a boozy note at the end as well. Not nearly as roasty (coffee), chocolaty, or hoppy as the other Imperial stouts that Ive sampled, which is kind of a drag. I guess I prefer the North American interpretation of this style.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

It stayed quite well, laced all the way through the tasting. Chocolate, coffee, and pepper in the nose, perhaps some plum and dark fruit. Taste was chocolat and coffee mostly. I tasted some currant and anise, I think. Bittersweet. Bitter than sweet, sweet then bitter. Good balance. Smooth easy drinking. Very rich",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Very complex and robust. Chocolate, anise, coffee tastes were well-balanced. Just the right balance between sweet and bitter. Very invigorating. Left a nice bitter-sweet mouthfeel.

Heads up quickly but settles just as fast (checked at about 57 degrees) Drink this at a distance from meals - each will significantly alter the taste the other. On a clean palate, the flavor is consistent and richly aromatic; the coffee hits you almost immediately, although it bitters up a bit too much for my fancy. Interestingly, I would take their oatmeal stout over this one (again, I'm a sugar hound) but the difference between the two is admittedly meager. I'd love to try it on tap!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Pours with a great-looking mocha-tan head which is thick and creamy.  It smells sweet. Prunes (?), chocolate, rum, and some smoke.  Palate is excellent. There's raisins and prunes, bitter chocolate, a slight tang of hop bitterness, and a not of smoke at the end. The whole thing is absolutely delicious.  Imperial Stout is viscous, sticky, and ever more oily as the bottle is imbibed, as is expected. More of a cigar by the fireplace beer instead of a summer ballgame beer, obviously. Maybe you could get away with that in October, though. One bottle should suffice as a nightcap, Christmas Eve beverage, or a reward to yourself after shoveling the driveway.

Nose of coffee, sweet sorghum, and malt. Taste coffee, chocolate, malt, sorghum, a bit of iron, then strong coffee finish with a nice fade to a clean lightly bitter finish. Overall a pretty mellow stout, not in-your-face with either malt or sweetness. Well-balanced. Mouth is watery but substantial. Drinkability is great; this is a great tasting and balanced stout.

S - It is kind of cold when i first started but as it warms up it smell like a nice blend of chocolate, roasted coffee, and some crisp hops. A very even blend and certainly very enjoyable.  T - Once again an even blend of coffee and roasted chocolate, but there is a slight cardboardish flavor. There is a slight red wine vinous flavor and some plum. Slightly skunkish. Probably a factor of it being in a clear bottle and getting light struck.  M - Very viscous and has a slight old beer sharpness to it. The bitterness is in the end but there is something else there that makes it feel old.  D - Im sure if this is fresh it is probably unbelieveable, but maybe this bottle is old.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Nose was molasses, brown sugar, and fruit with an underlying roastiness. Had a bit of alcohol as well. Full body; rich and syrupy. Molasses and roasted malts up front with a very firm bitterness below. Whiff of vanilla as well. Really, really flavorful but not for the weak-hearted! Mouthfeel was quite pleasant and all an imperial stout should be.

Definitely a lactose type taste is coming through, like a milk stout. Still has the coffee and chocolate flavors, and there is also a hint of soy sauce. Carbonation is on the low side. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, yet so smooth. This would be the perfect Imperial Stout if the ABV was a little higher.

Very nice scents of sweet, dark chocolate, port and rum soaked raisins. Taste is well balanced...a roasted malt sweetness lingers on the pallet with much delight. Nice chocolate profile in the flavor with espresso beans too. At just 7%, the alcohol is well hidden. Mouthfeel is above average but the carbonation could be a bit less for me.

Head is nicer than anything straight out of the bottle has a right to be. It is the color of brown sugar. Nose leaps out. Toss a cup of sugar onto a skillet, turn up the heat and as it burns, there's your smell. Taste is a collage of brown sugar, molasses, chocolate syrup, and cough syrup like alcohol. That cough syrup taste is what keeps this from being a 5 for taste, but that's a minor hindrance. This is a tasty brew. Mouthfeel is rich and creamy. I could certainly have a couple of these, a sixer is a wise purchase!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Its creamy but light mouthfeel make it a pretty easy beer to drink. It is not overwhelming like the majority of American Russian Imperial Stouts, and I appreciate the simplicity.

The foamy part of the tan head dissipates quickly, but a top-coat remains in place for some time.  S: The aroma is of chocolate, malt, barley and a little bit of hops and alcohol.  T: Creamy chocolate and roasted malt & barley flavor start out and prevail as the more dominant taste, but not overly sweet. A little bit of hops hit next and then a slight alcohol sting, with a slightly sweet after-taste.  M: Incredibly smooth, heavy body, medium carbonation and a clean finish.  D: Its not filling, very smooth, the alcohol is well-disguised and it goes down VERY easy, all of the characteristics of drinkability.  I enjoyed this beer quite a bit.

I let it sit for about 30 minutes after pulling it from the fridge, so I imagine the temperature was about 50-55 degrees F.  Appearance was very nice: moderate head that lasted for about 1/2 the beer; nearly black in color; no yeast in the bottle.  Smell was typical for Imperial Stoudt; licorce, coffee, roasted smell.  The taste was very smooth, and was really enhanced by nibbling on some bitter-sweet chocolate chips while drinking the beer.  The mouthfeel was almost velvety, and in my opinion, considerably better then Victory's Imperial Stoudt.

Two fingers thick rises from a fairly mild pour, then dies down to just a surface layer and a bit of lacing.  Burnt malt, dark coffee, sweet chocolate and a note of grassy hops. As it warms a bit, the hops stand out with a wiff of alcohol.  Sweet, yet bittery dark malty front that blends in some caramel, coffee, chocolate, tobacco and prunes, then turns lettuce and finishes bitterly clean. Rather well balanced.  With a medium plus body, it has a creamy as well as a tangy mouthfeel, with a pleasant warming of the alcohol ending each quaff.

I smell roasted malt. It has a slight banana aroma. Strange. It is also a little more hoppy than I would have though. I also smell some coffee.  This beer tastes of coffee. However, as with the aroma, the flavor is quite mild. Behind the coffee, I taste some sweet malts. I can also taste some of that banana that I noticed in the aroma.  This beer is very smooth. It leaves a sweet malty aftertaste. It is carbonated very well for the style.  I think this beer would be an excelent session beer. It is only 7% ABV, so that wouldnt be much of a problem.

Aroma is roasted coffee beans, dark rich malts, brown bananas, and vanilla.  The first sip is strong and smoothe. Slightly bitter chocolate taste on the back end. Leaves a nice feeling in the mouth and does not become to strong.  Let this one warm up a bit once you pull it from the fridge.

113,782,yelterdow,4.47,"12 oz. bottle, served at cellar temperature in the brewery's nonic.  Appearance- Pours a glorious ruby-tinged black into my glass, showcasing a 3½ finger light tan head that crackles serenely into itself. Beautifully unassuming, yes, that is the way I will describe the appearance. Lacing is reserved to several small patches.  Smell- An English display of molasses, chocolate, and muted alcohol... a pleasure indeed. Full and heavy, yet clean and brisk... almost a paradox. A sweetness, most likely from the malts, hovers and carries the aroma's body. Very nice.  Taste- Uniquely its own... there really is no mistaking Sam Smith's for any other Imperial Stout. First, the water used here is obviously a contributing factor in the clean, cutting character of the initial taste. The malts, combined with the chocolate and molasses notes are light on the tongue, but pack in a pleasing flavor and balance. The lingering finish, both malt-driven and mildly hopped, is tasty and lasting.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Light, prickly, and active enough to tantalize the palate for the next go-around. It works extraordinarily well with the character of the beer, and I love the fact that it's only a 7% ABV... a relatively mild RIS. Drinkability soars because of this, and points shall be awarded. Clear bottle my ass, this is great.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Roasted malt and coffee flavors. A hint of alcohol when swallowing but nothing unpleasant. Sweet chocolately flavor flashes in the end before being drowned out by the familiar toasted malt/impy stout character.  This beer is worth all of the hype.

Taste was slightly disappointing...more aroma than flavor. Lightly toasted malt flavor and rich mouthfeel of coffee/chocolate. Aftertaste was .... indescribable....not pleasant...slightly kerosene that stayed a long time. Maybe an older bottle, but I don't think so.

The color is a squid ink black, always apealing to me.  Smell- A appealing mix of sweet white bread, mocha, and heavy cream.  Taste- Starts out with a good balance of creamy roasted malts and very subdued English malts. The finish is more vanillin zucker than anthying. Sweet but very subdued in both its malt and hop flavors.  Mouthfeel- Liquid beer oil. But very smooth, just like the real thing.

Flavors of dark chocolate and coffee upfront, followed by undertones of kalamata olive. Shortly after, there come strong flavors of Spanish moss and moist, perique tobacco, followed by warming alcohol. Lingering bittering hops in the absolute finish. I am quite taken aback by the complexities here. Mouthfeel is not too heavy, but slick and carbonated enough to pair with the flavors. Coats the tongue nicely.  A very nice imperial stout. Small in alcoholic strength, but has an unmatched flavor profile. Perfect for nights where you don't want to have to commit to a 22 oz. of 10%+ ABV. Samuel Smith wins again.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

It leaves lots of lacing behind; If you find a bright enough light source, you can see some hints of ruby, but it's mostly opaque.  Let this warm up! Seriously, don't drink it out of the fridge. I have mine set on 0.5 and it is still too cold for most beers, this one included. Before it warms all you'll get is astringency. As it warms, gentle coffee aromas begin to come out, building along with a little bit of caramel and some veggielike greenness.  Coffee with cream, some lemony stout zest - slight smoky roastiness.  An enigma of a mouthfeel - thin for an imperial stout, yet damn filling. It's not 'thin' per se, just compared to a lot of other Impies I've had - smooth, imperceptible carbonation, slight alcohol zest.

Aromas of licorice, full roasted malts, dry grains, some sweet molasses. Taste; full and robust. Flavors of cold coffee, burned malt, some hop notes are present, but pushed to the back of the flavor palate, as more malt and maple elements take control. Wow. Good mouthfeel, very rich and creamy. Like having a sweetened beer brick in your mouth. Very heavy. Pretty darn good drinkability. I'm gonna be back soon. Highly Recommended.

Super thick and creamy (mocha like) head with a brown color. Takes a good 5 minutes to subside and still has a good 1/2 finger left.  Aroma is vanilla, toffee, dark toasted grain, coffee, alchohol (reminds me a bit of an alchoholic coffee drink) very potent overall and a bit sweet. Very full mouthfeel, creamy and dense with a salty finish. Taste is vanilla, burnt malt and coffee, there seem to be many other flavors as well, may need to try this one a few times to get accustomed to the depth of flavor.

Head rose to almost 2 inches with fairly aggressive pour. Leaves a good lookin' spotty wall of lacing.  S- Intense dark malt, chocolate and a helping of java beans.  T- About as good as a Russian Imperial gets! Delicious warming effect envelopes you from the instant it touches your lips. Dark malt and chocolate predominate, but hops make a nice cameo for a change. Finish has a roasted, smoky feel.  M- Just the right amount of carbonation to add to the warming effect. as it conquers the mouth, a creamy, oilcan smoothness wins out. Leaves you with a nip of dryness.  D- So delicious you can down it like a champ, but why would you want to? One to savor and sip for a while.

The head lasts forever, leaving tons of clingy lacing. Awesome looking!!!! Smells of dark fruits, mostly prunes, roasted malts, and some rum like alcohol aroma. Complex taste of both roasted malt and hops, dark fruits, molasses. A slight smokey background, with some faint chocolate flavors. A full bodied brew, that is creamy smooth. This stout has a kinda chalky feel to it. A great example of an Imperial stout that is not overly alcoholic, and a pleasure to drink.

113,782,asabreed,4.94,"550 ml. bottle into my Delirium Tremens glass.  Appearance: This definitely looks hot in the glass. Black as black can be of course. Mocha head that's not huge but stays at about 1/2"", and I didn't give it the most vigorous pour. Nice sticky lacing hangs out on the glass too. A good looking brew.  Smell: Damn. Some coffee, chocolate, oatmeal I think, a bit of sourness, some chalkiness, and a touch of burnt and toasted malts. Also some slight bitterness from hops in there. Balanced, complex, and though it doesn't have the insane amount of alcohol (though many have indiscernible levels) as many RIS, this is singular and wonderful.  Taste: Initial sourness, followed my a bit of hops, maybe some oatmeal, then some chocolate, chalkiness, burnt malt, some more sourness, and then finishes with all of it together. Long finish with a weird combination of hops present also. This is singular beyond belief, and also awesome in every way.  Mouthfeel: Wow, how do they do this? For the style I'm so surpised how velvety this is, how much carbonation there is, and how it maintains its creaminess through the entire process. Looks much thicker than it feels.  Drinkability: I wasn't sure about this being too overhyped, but no, it's not. Awesome drinkability, price, balance, flavor, complexity. If you like the style and haven't had this yet (and I consider myself in this camp also), then you should consider yourself silly and go get a bottle. Can't wait to stock up on this.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

113,782,supernaut,3.77,"A - Good but not great. I've come to expect motor oil from my Imperials and this one doesn't quite cut it. Decent head, nice retention and decent lacing, just not quite dark enough....  S - Suprisingly sweet. Some raisin and molasses comes through initially followed by what seems to be some spiciness....  T - Sharper than expected, at times almost tangy. Some smoke and a bit of dryness at the midpoint. Never really all that alcoholic, but somewhat acidic. The fruit in the nose is much more hidden in the palate. Some maltiness, but definitely on the burnt malt/coffee end of the spectrum.  M/D - Lighter than desired of this style. Not really as chewy as it could be. The dryness and almost souring finish tend to pull this one down a bit.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

S- Malt with some coffee overtones.  T- very interesting slight licorise, then black coffee. Very surprising finish, it was very very smooth. This is one of these rare offerings in which the taste gets increasingly better as you drink. It was not my favorite taste at first, but as I got into it, the stout got better and better.  M- exactly what I was hoping for some thickness, but not mud either. This stout gets it right.  D- very good but not for everyone, this fine achivement should be enjoyed all by itself or perhaps with some semi- sweet chocolate for dessert.

Smell: Lots of malty caramel coffee aromas.  Taste: Roasted malts up front with some caramel and coffee to go with it. Some fruity hoppy tastes follow and bring some balance to the sweetness of this beer.  Mouthfeel: Good body to it, not super thick but creamy.  Drinkability: While I wanted another one of these after my first one I decided to grab something lighter.  I liked this beer. It was a good stout, seemed a bit too sweet towards the end but this would go good after a meal, like a dessert.

113,782,dreadnatty08,4.1,"Fairly aggresive pour into my chalice produced a half inch dirty brown head that recedes to a bubbly thin covering. Minimal tracing. Oak, dried fruits, and a bit of chocolate at the end in the aroma. Flavors of bitter coffee, baker's chocolate, and raisin. Pretty bitter for a stout, sweetness isn't present at all. Bitterness gives a little tinge on the tongue at the end. The roasted maltiness dominates with little hops detected. A beautiful beer for a cold winter night, and fulfills my stout craving most definitely.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Dark chocolate and coffee aroma, also suggestions of dark fruit and a hint of alcohol. Dark roasty flavor, and vinous. Fruityness is balanced by just enough hop bitterness. Alcohol is somewhat noticable. Medium to full body, with low carbonation. This beer is very well balanced and probably the best example of the style. Top notch!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,danielharper,4.11,"Purchased from Frugal MacDougal, Nashville, TN.  Pours dark black color with only slight brown undertones as the beer is held up to the light. Very thick, foamy, tan head appears as if by magic on this wonderful-to-look-at beer. Really fantastic presentation. Leaves heavy lacing on the glass.  Thick, malty, almost diesel aroma. Hints of coffee and chocolate. Almost has a nitro-smell like a widget bottle, but I'm guessing that's just slight astringency due to the alcohol.  Very similar flavor as aroma, but with the astringency kicked up a notch or two, and the ""nitro-ness"" a bit higher than expected. Slightly sweet at times, almost a dose of dark chocolate-covered cherries. Hops minimal -- I could handle a bit more biting here.  Mouthfeel is a bit thin for an Imperial Stout, although it is quite smooth and overall very good.  This is a very drinkable beer, smooth and delicious -- the 7% ABV can catch up to you very quickly. The sweetness isn't cloying, and the bitterness and overall texture make this a pleasure to drink. Very good beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Domingo,4.73,"All I can say is ""WOW."" One of the best Imperial Stouts in the world for sure. Samuel Smith has won me over with an offering that's milder, yet somehow more bold than most others. While not as alcoholic as some others, the flavors in this brew stand out as bold and unmatched. It's like taking the signature malty flavors from their Oatmeal Stout, but supercharging them. Very chocolaty and nutty. It's only major flaw is that it doesn't carry a strong smell, but beyond that it's nearly perfect.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,BEERchitect,4.25,"This is the best balanced stout that I have ever had. i used to drink this beer regularly, but then was lured away by many stouts that have bolder flavors. Recently revisiting this brew makes me wonder why I have been away for so long. The stout has a very bold roasted quality with a light bitterness due to the black malts and light hopping. Has a layered cocoa, coffee, and milk flavors for added complexity. The beer, though bold and strong, is never intimidating, domineering, or aggressive. Moderately sweet with a rich and complex robustness. Properly brewed and well aged. Full and rich to the texture with a silky, creamy flow. Finishes extremely clean for such sweetness, texture, and roastedness. A slight hint of lactose sugars and a minty note adds a delicacy to the finish. A beautiful beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,rodrot,4.32,"This brew poured a jet black color with a small 1/4 inch head that lingered throughout. The aroma was of roasted malts and coffee. Taste was delicious with notes of espresso, currants, cocoa, port and Madeira. This beer is quite rich and complex for only 7% abv and it exhibits many of the qualities of much stronger Imperial Stouts. I believe this was the first RIS to be imported to the U.S. and it has always been one of my favorites. The character of this brew is still the same as when I first tried it back in the early 90's. The only criticism I've got is those damn clear bottles that Sam Smith uses. If you're going to cellar this beer, make sure you keep it away from any light source.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,DaPeculierDane,4.55,"Im really enjoying drinking this beer. Theres no carbonation to speak of and no head either but thats not getting me down. Im smelling rich bourbon, which I usually detest in beers, but this scent is laced with blackberries, plums, and vinous currants. Im loving it. Bitter chocolate then fills out the rich, sweet dark fruits nicely. The mouthfeel is as chewy as the color is opaqued plum. A long lingering oak barrel bitterness rounds out the thick beer nicely along with hits of chocolate and roasted, no burnt currants. Great beer and very complex. Im going to have to drink a few more bottles to search this one for all of its elements.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,KyleVick4,2.03,"From a big bottle Appearance: Its pitch black with white/tan head that has good lace and very small fine bubbles. Looks all around like a good beer. Smell: It has the distinct caramelly sam smith smell to it with mild hints of alcohol and coffee. Not a bad smell, just peculiar. Taste: Not impressed at all. Tastes like the traditional Sam Smith ale (which I am not a fan of) not like the Imperial Stout beers that I love. I taste mostly caramel and maybe hints of licorice or chocolate? Way too sweet for this type of beer. Either way I was very unimpressed with the taste. Mouthfeel"" Light and not very carbonated. I dont like a very carbonated Imperial Stout, but I also like a thick IS. Either way this beer is light and medium mouthfeel that should be much heavier in my opinion for a IS. Drinkability: I had trouble finishing the one glass of the beer I poured. It left a bad taste in my mouth and I was reluctant to finish it... Overall I would not recommend this beer. If you are looking for a good Imperial Stout, try the North Coast Brewing Co.

Taste is a complex blend of dark fruit ,roasty malt flavors of coffee , a little smokey chocolate , and some nice light hoppy notes in the finish. Very , very good! Mouthfeel is light and slick.

113,782,brewdlyhooked13,4.47,"Cellared this for a few years, thinking I had tried it once, but actually have not (confused it with Oatmeal Stout). At 7%, it runs the edge of 'cellarable' but as an impy I think it would do fine. One way to know for sure though...  Appearance - black pour,, a darkish mocha head of maybe a finger but recedes quickly to a partial covering. Around the bottom of the glass I see some reddish brown hues along the edge. 3.5  Aroma - smelled rich and intense coming out of the bottle, like alocohol, smoky espresso. As it settled that went away and introduced a grainy, metallic odor. A minute more and it appears to have resolved with some smoky chocolate, figgy aromas. The chocolate is starting to dominate now. 4.0  Taste - sweet and heavily roasted malts, almost to the point of tasting smoked. A mixture of coffee and chocolate follow, enhanced by the alcohol. Very roasty and sweet, slightly warm with a moderately long finish. 4.5  Mouthfeel - outstanding. Smooth as can be, evenly if not a bit under-carbonated.  Drinkability - easy, very easy to drink.

The smells are definitely different as aside from the coffee and chocolate one can sense a bit of vanilla and banana.

113,782,ColForbin,4.35,"Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout pours a nearly opaque black with a dark brown head. Aroma is an awesome blend of coffee and dark chocolate, after a couple swirls of the glass to remove a slight skunkiness (damn clear bottles). Taste is dark roast coffee, with some very dark chocolate and some sour fruit as well. Just a great blending of flavors. Off-dry finish with hoppy bitterness evident, but nowhere near the hop level of some new-school versions. Mouthfeel is heavy and slick but carbonation is still evident. Very drinkable, and the fact that this beer is only 7% makes it reasonable to have a couple.

Aroma: Dark fruits dominate the aroma, with lesser notes of spiced rum, molasses, earth, and vanilla.  Taste: Opens with toasted malt, and a strong earthy note. Coffee and bitter chocolate soon follow, with a pronounced alcohol note. The finish is dominated by earth and toasted malt, as well as a slight and lingering herbal bitterness.  Mouth feel: Rich, smooth, soft, and very full.  Drinkability/notes: A truly spectacular beer, more than worthwhile for anyone who appreciates fine beer.  Presentation: Packaged in a custom twelve ounce clear glass bottle with a pop-off crown, served in a standard pint tap glass.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Light lacing as it goes down.  Taste is dark and rich, a mix of malt and sorghum. Shades of black patent and chocolate malt provide a nice blend of coffee, vanilla and roasty stout flavors. A mild and pleasant bitterness persists to the end of the taste, finishing a little winey with a clean coffee-like aftertaste. No alcohol flavors, nothing off about this brew.  Mouthfeel is medium-heavy, extremely well-balanced. Unlike the recent arms race in Imperial stouts where the trend is to bowl over the taste with everything in a bottle and sky-high ABV, this one is reserved, esteemed, confident in its rank among the newcomers.

Edit: Very bottom of the glass comfirmed the dark, dark brown hypothesis. Has a nice two finger creamy head that never completely dissappears and leaves attractive thick rings of lacing all over the glass.  S - Molasses, cherries, coffee, a bit of chocolate and elderberries, a slight soy sauce aroma appears, but it isn't potent enough to be repulsive in the least.  T - Faint flavors of cherries, dates, dark chocolate and coffee. A slightly bitter finish that amplifies with time. A tiny bit of alcohol is evident at higher temps. The flavor is shallow compared to the aroma.  M - Thin, smooth and refreshing, but only superficially. Seconds after drinking I became very thirsty again. (Remedy? Don't stop drinking!)  D - Well, it was not difficult to finish the entire 18.7 oz. But this beer is too strong to session and it isn't refreshing enough to complement a meal properly.

113,782,geexploitation,4.55,"Sam Smith's Imperial Stout is a slightly more rich and luxuriant brew than its famed Oatmeal Stout, but what it gains over the Oatmeal Stout in flavors it loses in drinkability.  Pours a deep, dark, nearly black color with a nice tan head that lasts a good while but eventually will fizzle out without agitation. This beer is not all that fragrant. It has some fruit notes in the nose, banana and a bit of cherry. The flavor is extradordinarily rich, with a seductive malt base, peppery alcohol, and those light hints of cherry esters. The mouthfeel is slightly watery, at least compared to the Oatmeal Stout (I imagine this is due to the higher alcohol content). This fact, and the high alcohol content, reduce this beer's drinkability for me, but it remains a ""treat"" type of beer.  I really suggest trying this and the S.S. Oatmeal Stout side by side. They're both excellent beers, for some slightly different reasons, but with enough of the same charms (those exquisite malts) to complement one another.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Gives the impression of a double chocolate cake.  Smell: Rich, dark chocolate and deep licorice undertones. Some coffee, a bit of caramel, and a mild black cherry aroma. Alcohol is also present. Not the most complex imperial stout, but one of the most alluring I've smelled.  Taste: Heavy licorice taste, a touch of cola. Very flavorful but also quite smooth and subtle; not overwhelmingly or aggressively bitter like some imperial stouts. Excellent chocolate finish, a great brew to serve with dessert.  Mouthfeel: Very creamy and exceptionally smooth. Could be a bit more chewy, but overall, outstandingly pleasant on the palate.

113,782,musingmonkey,4.23,"Poured into an oversized wine glass. My excitement to drink this stout proved a little detrimental to the initial experience, as I drank it a little colder than I should have. This affected the head too, I think, or perhaps it requires a more vigorous attempt than I provided, as it was around 1 finger high, and faded quite quickly. The lacing left was thick and sticky. Reminded me of an off-colour, not quite symmetrical spider web.  Smell was of slightly burnt espresso, dark malt, and definite medicinal qualities. The same medicinal taste was present, although greatly subdued. Early on in the drink I decided to try and warm the glass with my hands, and this paid dividends after a few minutes. Sweet, dark toffee/caramel flavours delightfully played off the malt. Quite a complex stout.  A smooth drink, with a substantial but not over the top body, I was more inclined to sip than gulp.

113,782,Nesued,3.86,"Appearance: I thought the bottle was actually brown when I received this beer as a gift! From the bottle, the color was of a dark, chocolate color. From the pour, the color was similar with a deep color. Since the bottle of 550ml in size, I poured it into a taller than normal glass that would hold the entire amount. Was stored and poured cold, with the single pour providing a head about two fingers in depth.  Smell: Similar in aroma to most stouts, would not have been able to pick it out from a crowd.  Taste: A very typical stout flavor with rich mocha and chocolate tones.  Mouthfeel: Little carbonation which helps maintain the smooth presentation. A bit of a bite once you begin to work it around your mouth.  Drinkability: A very well-balanced stout that has a defined presence that would make me choose this beer over other stouts if given a choice. Larger (550ml) serving size makes for an excellent ""sipping"" beer. I poured this beer cold from storage, however allowed it to warm to almost room temp. before sampling.

Pretty nice lacing on the glass here. Lookin' pretty good.  Wow, what a scent that is. Black licorice, dark berries, medicinal qualities, red licorice, caramel, a touch of alcohol, spices (nutmeg, among others), some earthy tones, a hint of banana even. Where does it end?  Taste starts with a dark roasted malty character, but it's far less then some stouts I've had (pleasantly less, I'd say). Dark berries follow with hints of spice, chocolate, non-citrus fruit (can't quite place what fruit though), gingerbread, and some of the licorice is present too. Pretty tasty overall, but I think I expected a little more based on the aromatic character of this brew.  Nice and creamy with mildly aggressive carbonation. Medium to full bodied. Definitely dry in character. Some sourness in the middle fades to a light, but pleasant bitterness by the finish. Finish is long and strong.  Easily the most drinkable stout I've ever had. Lower alcohol (for the style) actually adds to the drinkability, I think. More alcohol could overpower some of the flavor and throw off the balance.

Alcohol is present but not overpowering like some other imperial stouts. Really a good beer. Mouthfeel is a little thinner than I thought it would have been. Drinkability is excellent. Could definitely drink a bunch of these which is surprising for an imperial stout. Really enjoyed this beer and will definitely have it again before the winter is over.

Big aroma of roasted, almost burnt, malt, espresso, cherries, and a bit of alcohol. European grassy hops bitter the scent as well.  Like the oatmeal stout, the flavor has some wine-like qualities on top of the big roasted flavor and some first-class chocolate and coffee bitterness.

Nose is very nice, incredibly well balanced between a certain dark fruit character with a dry cocoa undercurrent. Taste is impeccable, so well balanced and smooth, many layers going on here.

Upon forst tasting I'm noticing the silky smoothyet slightly creamy mouthfeel. Malty, malty. Chocolate, caramel and an obvious alcohol taste meets your tongue. The aftertaste is dry and chocolaty.

Having said that, the alcohol is not hidden well at all. At ""only"" 7-percentalcohol, it tastes awfully harsh. I can think of a few 7+ percent stouts that hide the alcohol much better. It's a good beer, but not as good as I'd hoped. I'm a huge fan of Sam Smith's Oatmeal Stout and hoped to be equally impressed.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,abcsofbeer,4.44,"Poured from the traditional clear bottle from SS. The color is a darkest brown with no transparency. The head is bubbly and light brown in color; about a 1/2 inch high. The head dissipates to a thin crown and leaves no lace.  The aroma is very special with this beer, and, it hits you as soon as you pop the top. The smell is medium to full bodied malt with sweet caramel aroma too. There are some strong hints of alcohol in the aroma too. The taste is full bodied burnt malts and bitter chocolate. At the top of the glass, the alcohol is strong. There are small hints of nuts and very slight hoppiness that brings the bitterness together.  The alcohol seems to die down a bit as the beer warms. Overall, this is a superior stout.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,thetachibro,4.25,poured a dark black with some brown highlights and a 1in tan head that hangs around and leaves nice lacing all the way down the glass. Roasted malts in the nose with some mild chocolate. The taste is somewhat sweet..cofee...slight bitterness. A very nice full bodied mouthfeel. For a Imperial Stout this has a high drinkablility for me the alcohol isn't overpowering at all,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,tempest,3.7,"Dark ruby, but not quite opaque like a good impy. Nice looking tan head, unfortunately it disappears pretty fast. No lacing, not a bit.  Smells like dark, fruity alcohol and lacks any roasty notes. Tastes is smooth with dark ester qualities. No roasty or smokiness, fairly simple profile and subtle, but still good.  Easy drinking for an impy stout and feels nice. Its a good RIS, but I find this, like I've found some of the other Sam Smith beers, to be overrated. A good beer, but one of the last RIS's I'd choose if I had a good number of choices. There is better, bolder stuff to be found at America's own craft breweries.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Tasted some chocolate, some molasses, and some butterscotch? Sweet without being overpowering.  After the great flavor, the there was enough hoppiness to cleanse the palate and leave you wanting more.  An excellent beer. Sweeter than Old Rasputin with a nice, clean finish. A nice balance of hops and malts.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

The nose is laced with coffee and toasted malt and has a sweet tone as well. I chose this as the final of my Christmas beers and I'm pretty excited about it. This beer is heavy and thick to the taste with coffee and roasted nut flavors and a smooth, full finish. This is almost as much a meal as a beer, and crazy filling. I can't get over the creamy, silky texture and finish. For a stout,this is extremely quaffable stuff, I find myself craving more already.

Huge roasted malt aroma with some delicious smells of dark chocolate, butterscotch, and caramel. Makes my mouth water.  Rich creamy texture, delicious roasted chocolate taste, so damn good! Followed my a dry bitterness of black coffee, burnt caramel/toffee. Nice little kick of alcohol esters in the finish, not too much, but just right.  Most perfect Imperial stout I have ever tasted, so balanced and drinkable. Why did I wait so long to drink you? I enjoyed this beer with some X-mas chocolates, Awesome!

The smell is rich and malty, though not overpowering. It starts out with a divine sweetness yielding to a nice bitter finish. It feels very thick but has a rich smoothness and just the right amount of carbonation for a stout. Overall a good balance here. This one is a slow drinker though, very filling.

113,782,ypsifly,4.15,"Clear, undated 550ml poured into an imperial pint glass.  None more black with a thick tan head that bubbles up and holds its ground. Thick webbed lace effect.  The nose is roasty with dark chocolate, slight metal, and bitter hops.  The taste delivers all that the nose promises with some vinous flavors, dark ripe fruits, and a slight citric tang. The finish carries a lot of the choco/roasted malt flavors.  Full creamy mouth that retains a little oil and is very pleasant. One of the most drinkable impy stouts available in these parts. I highly recommend this one.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Backer2004,4,"Great for a beer, good for the style. I picked this one up at a nice local beer pub in Belmont, NC post-Pop the Cap. The alcohol was not noticeable and the appearnce was very typical -- very dark, creamy with no head or carbonation. The Stone one I had of this style just seemed to be a above and beyond this one. Not overpowering and a nice one for those new to the style. A biton the pricey side ($5.25 a bottle).",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Mindsquall,4.65,"Quite a nice stout. Pours to a deep black with a tan puffy head. Smell has hints of essence of wine, fading to hints of caramel and smoke. Taste is excellent, the roasted malts make their presence known in this fine creation with strong caramel presence. This is slightly bitter, but not so bitter that it makes it difficult to drink, in fact it's quite smooth. Very drinkable.

113,782,troutmask96,4.33,"Wow - what a great Imperial Stout this is. Pours a black-as-night body with a tan, foamy head that's as thick as shaving cream. Smell is of raisins, currants, and a slight note of alcohol, which is actually well-hidden. Taste is deep and sweet but not overpoweringly so. Finishes sourly, which is standard with Imperial Stouts.

113,782,falloutsnow,3.59,"2012-04-15 Review  Bottle from Whole Foods No bottled on date Poured into a tulip glass  I was more impressed with Samuel Smith several years ago, when I first started drinking beer. Sampling a bottle of their imperial stout for the first time in a few years makes me think of three possibilities: my palate cannot detect the goodness that I once thought was evident in this beer after comparing it to fresher domestic varieties, that my inexperienced palate was finding flavors and aromas that didn't exist, or that I've just purchased an old bottle. Since I have no way of knowing about the last item, I have to rely on my senses and claim that I no longer find this beer as enjoyable due to palate development and comparison. While S. Smith's Imperial Stout is still a decent version, in this case I have to say that I enjoy the United States' assertive varieties more.  Pours a 2cm head of dark tan to light brown bubbles, small in size, forming a smooth and cloud-like appearance. Head descends somewhat quickly to a nice-looking cap atop the beer, leaving small spots of lacing in its wake. Body is dark brown to black in color with dark amber brown highlights. Carbonation is barely visible along sides of glass.  Aroma is a bit light, and I have to do some heavy digging to get anything distinct, but mostly of roasted malt, molasses, dried plums, and a bit of chocolate.  Taste opens with some roasted malt sweetness and mild bitterness. The sweetness could be described a bit as dried plums or currants, but I find it has more in common with roastd malt. Mild black licorice and molasses flavors emerge a bit further back, giving way to a bit more roasted malt sweetness, bitterness, and very faint coffee around mid-palate. Fades out with a rush of sweetness, licorice, and slight chocolate. Pleasant aftertaste of roasted malt and a bit of dark chocolate. In general, good tasting, but a bit one-dimensional with heavy emphasis on roasted malt and sweetness, and not particularly ""strong"" tasting, either.  Mouthfeel is essentially perfect for the style: gently carbonated, creating a smooth foam on the palate that moves across easily and is highly enjoyable. Finish is dry  2005-12-18 Review  A: Thick, dense, two-finger head that is light brown in color. The beer is completely black and impenetrable to light; one knows nothing of what is transpiring within the liquid as all carbonation and sediment would be completely enveloped by this darkness. Spotty streaks of lacing are left on the sides of the glass as the head deflates.  S: Traces of chocolate, prunes, molasses and roasted cereals.  T: Slightly burnt, but dense malt sweetness with hints of raisins and plums. Transitions to the deep flavor found in dark dessert wines and port. Some smokiness and sweetness in the aftertaste, but no noticeable hop presence. Alcohol taste becomes more present as the beer warms.  M: Medium-heavy body, very light carbonation, evincing a rich and smooth beer with a dry finish.  D: Highly flavorful and complex with deep, dark secrets. A beer that I'd only venture once a night, but that is worthy of drinking during many winter nights.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,MurphyMacManus,4.52,"12 oz. clear bottle into snifter.  Appearance: Opaque black with coffee-colored head that seems to be physically attracted to the sides of the glass.  Aroma: Dark chocolate, raisins, faint alcohol, and maybe coffee and more dark fruit.  Taste: Dark chocolate, raisins, coffee, mild alcohol. Very complex and sweet without being cloying, like a fine port.  Mouthfeel: Beer shake; deliciously thick and creamy.

113,782,Gagnonsux,4.06,"The appearance of this imperial stout is one of the best I've seen. The color is pitch black. Head is large, creamy, and dark tan. Retention is great. The aroma has an inviting mixture of toffee, chocolate, and dark fruit smells. I just wish the aroma was a bit stronger. The taste starts with a strong chocolate flavor with edges of toffee. Dark fruit flavors mix in nicely along with a bit of alcohol flavor. A slight butteriness is noted, especially near the finish. The sweet finish is especially long-lasting. Without a doubt this beer has a excellent mix of flavors that are layered nicely, but when compared to the bigger American imperial stouts, this falls a little short of exceptional. Still, this is highly recommended.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,sinistrsam,3.77,"This poured very dark, almost black and somewhat watery. It had a very small head which went away almost immediately. The aroma was unmistakably stout-sih; very roasted hints of malt and coffee, possibly chocolate, dark fruits. It immediately hit me with bitterness in the taste, with plenty of maltiness and caramel flavor. It had a lasting chocolate/coffee bean aftertaste which was pleasant, but left something ot be desired. It had a bitter and watery mouthfeel. I'm going to go against the grain on this one and disagree with the monumental praise this had gotten. A good beer, but not outstanding.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Phatz,4.78,"This beer pours black with dark ruby highlights. It has a nice brown head that is thick and foamy. Substantial lacing.  Smell: It is definitely a black licorice aroma. That is what hit me right up front; then there were hints if red, like cherry or birch. Very enticing!  Taste: Chocolaty; with a hint of this mixture: Birch-beer and Cherry-cola mixed with dark cola (Coke), in other words it is a thin syrupy characteristic in the taste, with those flavors. I got a slight bit of dark tobacco and vanilla in the aftertaste. I tried some dark chocolate next to this beer and it was a beautiful match.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel was surprisingly thinner than I expected from a Russian Imperial Stout. Still it was pleasant and very creamy.  Drinkability: The drinkability of this beer was actually, surprisingly, exceptional. This is a R I S with a relatively low ABV and it does not sit heavy in your stomach. As a huge fan of Imperial Stouts, I must say that their one drawback is that they were you out quickly. This beer is an exception. It has most all the positive attributes of RIS and avoids the one drawback. That sounds like a darn fine beer to me. I highly recommend.  Hope this is helpful.

Noticeable bitterness, especially in the aftertaste. A little peppery.  Mouthfeel: A bit of punchy carbonation. Not as creamy as I expected, but still a fullish feeling.

Aromas of chocolate, fruity cough syrup, smoky raisins and toffee. Taste is of hops, at first, then smooth chocolate and coffee bliss. Surprising bit of boozines for only 7%. Cherry cordials. Slightly buttery but mostly spicy bitter finish. Mineral aftertaste. Not bad at all. As it warms, the flavors balance out more. Definitely a standard-bearer of taste, but not quite the heaven in a bottle I was expecting. Incredible mouthfeel, however: tingly, slick and oily and an eminently downable medium-to-thin body.

113,782,rhoadsrage,4.17,(Served in an imperial pint glass)  A-This beer has a nice deep dark midnight brown body with no visible sings of carbonation it is so opaque. The head is a boiling mat of light brown that settles to a nice even layer.  S- The deep dark aroma has notes of graham cracker and nuts with some caramel notes and a dark roasted malt and barley with some faint slightly bittersweet chocolate in the finish. As it warms I start to get a hint of banana milkshake in the finish.  T- The taste of dark malt has a slightly sour earthy quality. The finish is dry with some slight hints of honey oddly enough. The taste of bittersweet chocolate comes through with more fruity flavors of raisins as it warms. The notes of fresh bread and alcohol hints come through in the finish also.  M- This beer has a full body with some velvety texture to it. The alcohol warmth is very soft and helps finish the taste of the beer.  D- This beer has nice big dark flavors but the secondary flavors were a bit strange with banana and bread seemed to take over. I would have liked some more malt complexity and maybe a bit more alcohol or hops to balance out this big beer.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Slight fruity tang in the aftertaste. Not much alcohol taste, but it does become more warming as it warms up. Very nice flavour, but lacking the depth of some.

From a good foot away I was catching wafts of roasted cherries, toffee and a mixture of walnuts and almonds.

Smell was delightful with all the traditional coffee and chocolate notes one could ask for. smooth mouthfeel with flavors that change every second on your toungue, transitioning from chocolate milk to mocha to coffee and leaving your mouth with a great nutty aftertaste which invites you to drink more.

Mouth feel is creamy with small carbonation.  Yuck. I tried drinking this slowly to pick out all of the flavors. I tried gulping it and also I tried letting my mind wander so I could surprise myself with a sip. Either way, this was just not an enjoyable beer.

Prune, rasin and a hint of alcohol give way to a closing dryness and great lingering roasty bitterness. Really well balanced and smooth.  M: Full, thick and creamy.  D: Very drinkable considering the complexity, but easy to get lost in the flavor kick this has. Could easily drink too many before realizing it.  Overall: What a great beer. Definitely falls into the ""great"" category for me. Every aspect of this stout is so smooth and well crafted and rich in flavor it's easy to get lost in. From opening the bottle to finishing the pint flavors and aromas change some as well making the experience even better.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,atigerlife,4.11,"The appearance is black. Small brown head. The smell for me was the most unusual. A strong dark soy sauce smell kept coming through. Also some malt and molasses. Dark chocolate. The taste was of dark chocolate with some roasted malts. Some hints of coffee. A mild bitterness adds to a very rich character. A decent mouthfeel. Somewhat creamy. Rather light with moderate carbonation cleansing. Overall, an interesting beer I will certainly try again. Rather complex. I drank the first half by itself and it was fine. I then ate some chocolate and this is when the beer really showed its true potential. Much better when eating chocolate. Perfect match.  I've updated this review as I have had more of this wonderful beer: rather strange that I now don't think it goes well with chocolate [like most stouts]. When I had it last night I was yearning for a really good hamburger. Strange.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,nickss,4.21,"Certainly not the first time I've had this brew... but I figured it was time I got around to reviewing it.  Pours an obsidion black with a monstrous chuny beige head. Tremendous chunks of lace cling to the sides.... in one word... gorgeous.  Smells strongly of alcohol, with a certain level of dank mustiness (not in a bad way). Smells of graininess, a bit of oat in the nose, along with a bit of a sweet smell, like that of dark fruit. Nice, and definitely unique.. you only get this scent from Sammy Smith brews.  When it first hits the tongue, there is a certain amount of bitter copperiness. Ive been told that this is due to the water that the beer is brewed, obviously unique to that certain geographical area. That being said, very bready and oat-y tasting. I'm having a hard time nailing down the flavors I am experiencing due to the overwhelming complexity of this brew. Definitely some sharp mocha notes in the aftertaste. Additionally, some berry in the flavour as well. Very nice, better than I remember.  The mouthfeel is tight and sharp at first, but quickly switches to a thick, mouth-filling libation. A little bit thicker, and it would be perfect.  Very drinkable for an impy stout... only 7% and you can certainly enjoy a few of these before you start embarrassing yourself.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,SkeeterHawk,4.3,"Appearance: Pours black as night with a half inch of tan foam on top. The head stuck around for a minute or so. A small ring around the top of the beer remained after a few minutes, and stuck around for a while.  Aroma: Really nutty with a good bit of chocolate and roast. It is really has a silky smooth malty quality to the aroma that you dont get with many beers. A bit of floral hops is noticeable as the beer warms a bit.  Taste: Sweet and nutty malt is the first thing to greet you. There are lots of other flavors in here, and to be honest, I am having a hard time identifying all of them. I think that it is a characteristic of the hops and the yeast the Sam Smiths uses because it is in their other beers also. The beer stays balanced firmly toward the sweet the entire time, and finishes with a slightly metallic and slightly bitter finish which I believe is more from the roast malts than the hops. As the beer warms a bit, it is gaining a black cherry note to the flavor, and you can notice the hops a lot more.  Opinion: Now this is different among Imperial Stoutsespecially coming in at a paltry 7% ABV. You cant put this beer beside Great Divides Yeti, or Stones Russian Imperial, and expect the same beer, even though all three are on the top 100 at this time. This one depends almost entirely on its depth of malt to give it flavor, while the American varieties have a lot of hops to obscure the actual effect of the roast malts. This is a fabulous beer, but is a little different than its American cousins.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,connecticutpoet,4.37,"This beer was an extremely dark reddish-brown brew with a very small head, but one that persisted and left some good lacing.  Aroma was of strong roasted malt, some bittersweet chocolate notes thrown in underneath. I would love to smell the brewhouse when this is being made.  Flavor was very strong, incredible roasted malt flavor dancing over the tongue. There was a hint of mustiness, which may have been misperception just because of the strength of the flavors. Some bittersweet chocolate came through, and some hop bitterness was also apparent. The flavor of the alcohol came through, and unusually I detected a bit of saltiness that was not at all unpleasant.  Mouthfeel was full and creamy-smooth. Very good body, quite chewy... it supported all that flavor well.  Drinkability was very good... but I think the flavor was so strong it would limit me in how much of this I could consume before being burnt out. One bottle was enough at one sitting, I was ready for lighter fare.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,mattviator,4.5,I didn't realize that the bottle was clear until I poured it. Pours straight black with a good tan head that leaves a good lacing. Smell is somewhat sweet with roasted chocolate and coffee. Taste is incredible. Strong roasted creaminess with bittersweet chocolate. Alcohol taste is very well hidden and has a sweetness to it. Slightly woody finish. Creamy and rich feel and I loved drinking it and wanted more.

The aroma was of coffee, chocalate and some dark, hinting fruitiness. The flavor began with roasted flavors and finishes with a very nice hop bitterness along with the alcohol bite there as well. Sammy's Imperial Stout is a full bodied brew with a creamy texture, but it's incredibly drinkable with a very nice, complex taste. This is one beer whose reputation has well preceded its drinking. Highly drinkable and a true pleasure.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Aroma is a mix of dark fruit and coffee. A musty quality is in there with that dark, roasted malt.  Sweet and fruity balanced with dark malt bitterness. Very much wine-like. Lasting tannin bitterness. Alcohol blends perfectly with the sweeter qualities.  Not as full as you might expect. Very low cabonation. Close to chalky.  Always a good choice. One I have had many times. Worth it, in case you were wondering about the price. It was my introduction to imperial stouts and is a high benchmark.

A very large head with no sign of falling. The lacing clings as the beer is drained from the glass.  Smell: This one smells of raisons and molasses very floral hoppy smell. A nonoffensive alcohol smell is present.  Taste: This is very busy a nice roasted smokey espresso combination with the addition of brownies and some fruity goodness (prunes and raisons) in evidence. Good malty back bone with a nice supporting hop profile.  Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: Dam! I have drank many stouts over the last several days.

Burnt chocolate nose, some alcohol vapors present, and background hops. Huge roasted flavor, nicely blended with bakers chocolate, and a mild vinous character. The bitter and sweet flavors are prduced by the malt, and there is some residual sweeteness, but the drying hop aftertaste helps keep the taste somewhat balanced.

Chocolate and black treacle flavors were present. Body was full, and carbonation modest.  This a fine stout. A rich and flavorful beer that isn't as brash as it's American counterparts, but doesn't lack complexity. As far as the aroma, I know I sense skunky esters in lower levels than most people do.

Nose is strong on the Juan Valdez up front with a backbone of porter grain and blackberry yogurt. Taste stays with the roasted coffee ground, bittersweet Hershey's and dark sour berries. Mouthfeel of carbonated crude oil, thick and syrupy. This is a meal of an RIS. The flavors don't always mesh - the sour fruit gets a little cloying at times - but overall a tasty stout.

Cervino's in Ridgewood NJ carried it and it was so pricey that I was at first reluctant to buy it. Today many craft brews are more expensive and some are tastier, but Sam's was always there.

I have never been a fan of the clear bottle in some rare cases, the beer lasts and fights the light. Poured an opaque black with a nice creamy head resembling chocolate milk. Great lacing as well. The smell is fantastic. Raisins, mollases, figs and malt. Not an overwhelming hop presence but a great balancing effect. I was a little dissapointed in the taste. A little too sweet I think for an imperial. Yes, very sweet. A nice hop bitterness is present and some chocolate and fruitiness such as prunes and mollassas are present as well. The sweetness is not to my liking. Sticky mouthfeel with the bitterness lingering for a while. Not an overwhelming alcohol mouthfeel which is nice because I think more alcohol would make this a completely unbalanced beer. A nice cool fall night beer.  Overall, I was dissapointed.

Smoky, coffee/espresso , dark caramel and molasses, the flavors go on and on. I really could go for a cigar to enjoy with this one.  Mouthfeel is thick and chewy, but still smooth and tasty. Coats the inside of my mouth with goodness. Wow! It's the beer that eats like a meal.  Outstanding drinkability. The 7% ABV is not evident to me at all. I could have a very nice session with this stuff playing darts or pool in a smoky bar somewhere.  My first experience with this one, it's an instant classic. The only bad thing I can say about this beer is that it appears to be very difficult to find in the big bottles, as well as generally harder to find than the rest of Sam Smith's line.

First sip is like no other imperial stout I have had. Beef jerky comes first in my mind. Smoke. Roasted grain, malty sweetness is there, but takes a backseat. I cant get over the beef jerky (in a good way). Now in place of beef jerky, Im picking up a bacon flavor. Wow. I can drink bacon. Heavenly. Smooth, creamy mouth feel that is lacking in most imperial stouts. Slightly astringent aftertaste Aftertaste is dryer than expected from the other characteristics, but welcome and not overbearing.

It was topped by a little more than one finger of frothy dark tan head. Big rings of lace clung to the glass throughout the sample.  The smell was dark and roasted. Malt upfront but very well accented with chocolate, black coffee, and cocoa. A slight ""bitterness"" to the smell, a bit like black liquorice.  The innitial taste was a heavy roasted (almost burnt) maltiness. This gave way to a flurry of black cofee and dark chocolate flavors. Only a slightly bitter kick to the end similair to chicory. Some strong coffee flavors and a slight warming to each sip. Little alcohol in the taste, but the slight alcoholic warming associated with Imperial Stouts. A robust and full flavor that has some hints of darker fruit as well.  Medium to slightly heavy on the palate with a robust body that is sturdy yet maintains a creamy consistancy on the palate. Only slight carbonation.  As far as Imperial Stouts go, this has got to be one of the most drinkable. Every aroma is matched in taste and everything is so well balanced so as to accent everything else. The moderate alcohol content makes it easy to finish and despite its body, still very easy to drink.

The taste is roasted malt, balanced by an unobtrusive bitterness, with the spiciness still apparent when I sip the brew and swirl it slowly around my mouth.

I bought a four pack at Richey's Easy in Pensacola for about $8.40. Excellent price for a most excellent beer. I shall probably hold on to the other three for a while to see where it goes.  I can't say anything that hasn't already been said. You know, jet black. Thick tan creamy head that lingers. Great sort of nutty aroma. Goes down soooo easy. Notes of chocolate, roasted flavors, perhaps a hint of cherry. I don't really notice the hops, but i know they are there to balance everything out.

Burnt molasses on the tongue at the front, followed by plum and cherry with a hint of roasted grain. Fig laced with alcoholic sweetness linger through the finish. Very pleasant leafy hop aftertaste. Thick and biting mouthfeel. Leaves the tongue tingling.  This is an amazingly drinkable imperial stout. I haven't had this beer in a very long time and I find it even better than I remember it.

Low alcohol so you can have a few in one sitting, and it's as complex and satisfying as just about any 9%+ imperial stout.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,dirtylou,3.63,"this single bottle was purchased on the first day of legal high grav beer sales in North Carolina from Brawley's in Charlotte. I had seen this thing around in the midwest but I am guilty of not buying it because of its rather low abv.  appearance: very dark as expected, foamy light brown head, not incredible lacing. as it poured i noted it looked a little thin for the style  smell: roasty, light caramel, slight earthiness. nothing too special in the nose, just standard imperial  taste: reminded me of their oatmeal a little bit, Samuel Smith beers have this common ""trait"" that I cant really put my finger on. slight dark coffee, mild cocoa, pretty sweet, raisin, plum. Not terribly exciting in general  mouthfeel: rich and smooth, too thin for my taste though  drinkability: goes down easy",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

113,782,andjusticeforale,4.6,"Pours out of the bottle into big and dark with a gray tan two finger head that settles to 1cm after 2-3minutes.  There is not much to speak of in the way of aroma, perhaps some malty mocha-chocolate with a bit of smokiness. More comes out after the tasting.  Upon first sip I dont think I was ready for this black and ominous liquid to be so smooth. There are obvious coffee notes upfront; some cocoa, and through the middle is a subtle astringent bitterness that is really quite fascinating. There is a pervasive coffee taste, but there is a sweetness behind this flavor that almost hints of smoky flavorful wood. And a bitterness.  The finish is dry. The mouthfeel is huge, and there is an uncanny perfect amount of carbonation here. It holds the stout together and provides vast drinkability. Any less carbonation would change the whole texture, any more would contradict the style. As for this huge beer, there is still supreme drinkability, and even if Imperial Stouts are not on your menu- this is a must try. I wouldnt pair this with any weak foods, no mild cheese and crackers or fish and chips.

113,782,mentor,4.88,"Bottle obtained from Superior Liquor (Colorado) and consumed about a week later (July 2005). Pours a one-finger almond brown head over a pitch black liquid. A little bit of dark rbuy red edging when held to light. Smells cherry sour, roast, and underlying caramel. Tastes delicious...oh my! Chocolate, roast, sour, caramel, currant, raisin, blueberry, prune. Imagine a dense chocolate raisin rum cake, the weight of which has a buttery brown sugar syrup almost tearing out the sides, but nothing quite collects on the plate. Some beers flash a certain flavor before it bows and leaves the stage for some other flavor to shine in the spotlight. Not this beer...this beer holds each flavor throughout the taste. Each rising and mixing with other flavors and never quite going away before merging with some other flavor. A delight to pull each draw and ponder each aftertaste. No gulp is a repeat of a previous..there's alot going on and I seem to focus on different wonderful qualities during each taste. Plus, a wonderfully thick smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Carbonation is mild and tinkers the thick hanging on my tongue. I think this helps some flavors remain fruity and pleasant so that the beer isn't overly heavy. Lacing on the inside of the glass defines the level the liquid sat after each gulp. There is still a thinlayer of head on top of the beer. What an amazing selection.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Dukeofearl,4.15,"roma is a nice creamy chocolate, with just a faint hint of roasted bitterness  Flavor is quite nice- more bitterness than the aroma, definite chocolate, some espresso beans, and a definite alcohol/op bite at the end.

Pours an inky black with slight red tinges when held to the light and it's topped with a 1/4"" brown head that is fizzy and leaves little lacing but never completely goes away. The aroma consists of green apples that are sour/tart, chocolate, coffee, anise, some dark fruits and a bit of alcohol. The taste is identical but with some green hops and a nice bitterness from the hops and roasted malts. The body is medium to full with a medium carbonation and the drinkability is high for an imperial stout. Delicious.

Aroma has a smorgasbord of fruits, lactose, molasses, chocolate, black coffee and ethanol. Initial taste is incredibly complex! There is so much going on! It tastes like the best Starbucks macchiato with caramel; plus citrus/floral hops, smoke, chocolate, dried fruit, and Lord knows what else! I think I will just savor the experience.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,ommegangpbr,4.8,"It's about time I tried this sucker. It's rich and delicious. This is probably the easiest to find for me of the world class stouts out there and I am glad for it. The ""lower"" alcohol content and smooth flavors make this stout outrageously drinkable. Lots of deep, smooth coffee and chocolate gluttony to be found. The hops are used just enough so that the sweet flavors do not become cloying. Others have gone into great detail as to all that can be found in this bubbly black nectar so I'll just chime in with- if you are jonesing for a stout this will set you at ease and leave you with a smile on your face.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,RedwoodGeorge,2.85,"I'm a big Samuel Smith fan so I'm rather surprised at how disappointed I am in this stout...  The pour is promising enough - dark, dark amber with a thin tan head. I wouldn't expect much carbonation with this style and wasn't surprised when the head died down quickly leaving very little lacing along the glass.  The smell is promising enough - plenty of notes of caramel, coffee and a roasted aroma that you'd expect.  The taste was rather one-dimensional. While there were hints of roasted grain in there, this was primarily a treacle and prune drink (which isn't really a good thing) The brew was just shy of being overpoweringly sweet with an overbearing molasses taste accompanied by an equally strong flavor of plums, prunes and raisins. There was very little hops to compliment the thick, sweet flavors leading to a very unbalanced brew.  Mouthfeel was the highlight of the beer - it was almost velvety smooth. Carbonation was low as per the style but if they'd added a few more hops to dry out the palate it would have been near perfect. There was an oily residue left on the tongue but that's to be expected of a heavy stout.  I'm not sure I've rated a beer a 2.0 before but ""not impressed"" is exactly how I'd describe my experience. I'm a big fan of Samuel Smith's brewery and adore their oatmeal stout so I'm very surprised at how unexciting this brew is.

113,782,GCBrewingCo,3.68,"The beer poured into the glass black with an amber highlight. The head was tan and frothy, but fell like a rock. The head did lace the glass.  The aroma was chocolate and coffee and molasses melded with caramel. The chocolate and coffee were slightly vinous and coupled with dark fruits, mainly plums and prunes with raisins.  The flavor was much less exciting than the aroma. The flavor was chocolate, but mainly coffee and more precisely black patent malt flavoring leading to a slight burnt and dark caramel flavor. The fruit complexity of the aroma was missing in the flavor, however raisins and slight plums were still slightly present.  The finish was dry with lasting black patent, chocolate and coffee flavors that lasted almost too long into the aftertaste. The body was medium to almost medium full. Dunno why this one doesn't take the cake, but it doesn't. A good brew, but not world class for me.  12 ounce bottle.

The head was very small and beige in color and disappeared altogether quickly. There was no lacing left. The smell was sweet and full of roasted malt goodness. A slight fruity aroma was apparent in the background. The taste was also sweet and a little nutty. A nice roasted flavor with a hint of vanilla. Just the slightest bit of hop bitterness. After the beer warmed a little I tasted some chocolate notes in the mix Sam Smith's I.S. is smooth and creamy with a nice mellow, long, sweet aftertaste.

Notes of more chocolate, lots of burnt coffee, vanilla, burnt fruits and grains, smoke. Bold flavors, but still somewhat subdued and subtle, basically this is still British style and its not over the top. World class sipper.

Taste is great, heavy coffee and bitter chocolate flavors dominate with the anise flavor peaking through as well in the finish.  Mouthfeel is heavy and creamy just like you would expect, the decent abv gives it a nice warming on the way down. Very pleasant.

The head is tan and rocky with plenty of tiny bubbles and carbonation. The head collapses to a sort of blanket of bubbles which remains constant and sticks to the glass.  Smell: Chocolate is the dominant smell. There is a further hint of nut or a creamy/buttery apple type smell to cut the roasted malts.  Taste: A bitter chocolate taste with a little toffee and caramel flavors complimenting it. This really reminds me of a candy bar with all the sugar taken out. The initial impression of the beer in my mouth is sweet followed by the chocolate and caramel flavors. Also, the tastes remind me faintly of toast or charred apples.  Mouthfeel: Medium body. Carbonation from the head sticks to my lips.  Drinkability: A very good stout. Probably the best offering from Samuel Smith and one of the best Imperial Stouts available.

As it sits, slowly collapsing into itself revealing old linen lace, the darkness of the body begins to become evident. Black as night, with the exception of the stem area of the glass, she shows a little leg and it is mahogany.  The nose is really big, with a sharpness of roasted malt as steely as a knife. Deep roasted malts are joined by earth fresh fruit and hops.  Entry is quiet, with barely perceptable carbonation and an instantanious roasted malt chewiness. Midtaste drops an earthy malt bomb on the back of the tongue along with plenty of carmalized sugar. The finish begins at the peak of malt flavor and is escorted by some bery nice hops.

113,782,NiceGuyMike,3.73,"Very dark as it should be. Nice, but limited, amber froth. There is something appealing to me about a dark beer with an amber head. That sounds like an odd thing to write.  Smells of malts and light alcohol and something else I can not put my finger one.  Tastes of dry bitter chocolates and slight coffee flavor. Maltiness kicks in to tie things together nicely. This is a complex one, not to be taken lightly.  This is a heavy brew. Not something I want to sip or drink all night. But an enjoyable sample. I have to admit I like a lighter stout.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

It smells of honey and burnt chocolate with syrup and something that reminds me of...tree bark. All of these smells are revealed in a very complex taste. I also found something spicy in the taste. It fades nicely into a brown sugar taste. This is a VERY good beer. I'd definitely recommend it!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

It's a treat that takes me back to my earliest good beer memories of sneaking a bottle past my Father and drinking it in the woods behind our house...good stuff.  The color is inky black and capped by a thick and luxuriously dense brown head of tiny bubbles. Lacing is adequate as the beer settles, a veil will remain on the top until the end. It just looks delicious sitting there in my Delirium tulip.  Aromas are dominated by creamy chocolatey malts in all their glory. There are hints of anise, black cherry, plum, raisins, cocoa, and molasses with a delicate floral hop note trailing behind. The very essense of an Olde School RIS is embodied by this aroma.  Everything in the nose translates to the taste. There's creamy chocolate and bittersweet coffee, molasses, dark and jammy fruits, licorice, and a delicate hop finish providing perfect balance. It's every bit as good as it ever was!  The body is wonderfully rich and chewy, with a dense, creamy mouthfeel and very lite carbonation making it even silkier on your tongue.

113,782,rousee,4.69,"I think I am in love with the imperial stout style. As I become more and more of a beergeek, this is the one style that taste-wise that does the most for me. This past weekend, I had an Oatmeal stout from Heartland in NYC (it had won a few medals) and it tasted like a baltic porter or an impy stout. This one reminds me of theirs. Very nice indeed.  It pours beautifully--its smooth brown but no head-no lace. Doesn't seem to matter though as the nose is almost perfect for the style. Burnt almond and nice tree bark (burch or cedar-maple oak-mix)is what I get.  Tastewise-there is also some slightly vinous dark cherry/plum and a little chocolate and coffee.

I will concede they are a classic producer, but I hold it against them that they violate a simple rule of brewing technique in favor of marketing.  That being said, their Imperial Stout is my favorite offering of theirs. It's roasted, it's bitter, and it's tasty. It pours with a nice head and has a terrific aroma of esters.

It pours out black with a rocky bown sugar to toffee head that holds up well on streams of fine carbonation.  A whiff of caramel accompanied by earthy notes welcome me to the complexity of this fine ale. The sweet yet balanced body holds dark fruity flavors and hops only in supporting roles.  This is more enjoyable for me than some of the more monotonous stouts and porters out there.  Quite drinkable, yet a special occasion beer in my book.

113,782,twelvsies,4.67,"Man, this company makes some great brews. Seems as though I discover a brewery and then have to try each of their beers. Sammy Smith has been that brewery recently, along with Fantome. Both great in different ways. This is one of the beers (among several) in their lineup that will now be a permanent part of my ""beer rotation."" Appears a staunch black color, letting in no light. Smells and tastes are super complex. Lots of different angles coming at me here. First there's a dark fruity component, dried cherries and currants. There's also a nice roasted malt in there and actually a bit of spicy hops that I can definately taste. More odd stuff: milky tones, dust, and a leathery character, like sticking your face in a baseball glove that's been sitting in the sun all day. This beer is almost ""funky"" in the way that a farmhouse ale might be described, though with out the sour. Really amazing tastes here, very complex once again. Slick warm mouthfeel and the surprises behind every sip make this one a real pleasure to drink. Cheers to Sammy, whoever he may be.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,HardTarget,4.28,"Aroma: Slightly soured malt with a good hit of the dusty smell I attribute to porters. No sign of hops, slight alcohol edge. Appearance: Pure black with some carbonation trails noted with serious backlighting. Thick clumpy dark brown head clings to the side of my mug and slowly follow the beer down. Flavor: Rich sour malt. I dont know how they get that sour, maybe it is just lots of malt. Some roasted character, some creamed coffee flavors, some nutty flavors, some unsweetened chocolate, slight alcohol tinge which I find serves to accent the other flavors. Mouthfeel: The medium body seems out of place for the rich flavor, but with the low carbonation level it really helps you drink this beer up. Overall Impression: This is one of my standby favorites. Rich yet drinkable, dark yet refreshing, a great session beer, but the 7% will make it a lively or short session. I think this stands up better in the old Imperial Stout category rather than the Russian Imperial Stout category. It is a bit more refined, a bit less charred or tarred. Im surprised I hadnt reviewed this yet. I think I was saving it for a special occasion.

Notes of dark chocolate, coffee, and smoked barley in the nose. Smells smooth and complex without being abrasive. Solid.  Velvet smooth mouthfeel quickly gives way to a slightly metallic, certainly bracing hit of alcohol, followed by notes of coffee, smoke, and cocoa. Bitter in the aftertaste that is neither pleasant nor terribly distracting, given the nature of the style. funny, the alcohol taste present in other imperial stouts I've tried isn't as harsh on the flavor profile, despite being higher than the 7% here.

Taste: Bitter strong coffee...not quite an expresso taste, more like a Columbian or Arabian coffee from Starbucks. This is an upfront flavor, other flavors are dark chocolate, roasted malts, and some bitter hops that linger. Also, with this one there was a heavy alcohol taste. I've had this beer about 5 other times before this, and usually I don't get the alcohol flavor...but this time it was quite noticable.  Mouthfeel: Ma-ma-ma-ma-malt. Clings to your mouth. Nice.

Pitch black appearance, thin deep khaki head with that typical winey-malt smell. Not as sour in the nose as Sinebrychoff or North Coast Brewing.  Taste is a deep malt flavour with that hint of wine that I've come to expect from Imperial stouts. Again, not quite as sour as some of the others I've had, but this in no way detracts from it. A bit weaker in flavour than some others, but very very tasty and rich. Easily a dessert in itself.  Quite drinkable, despite the 7% abv.

Full bodied, finishes dry, with lingering flavor of bitter roasted coffee and alcohol. Light carbonation lends a certain smoothness and elegance its heavy weight. A nearly perfect classic that I hope they never alter.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

It smelled sweet and dark malts, dark chocolate and a bit of ground coffee, but overall the aroma wasn't on par with some of the other double/imperial stouts I've tried. Tasted malty, again on the sweet side. Chocolate and coffee flavors are present backed by some hop bitterness, and it all concludes with a warm finish (the 7% right there).

Smell is very crisp and sweet, very earthy.  Taste is damn good. This stout has a medium body which is delightfully smooth. Righteous roasted barley at the forefront which tapers into a slightly astringent sensation on the palate. I get a sense of toffee, some caramel flavors; alcohol sugars are a perfect finish to this very well crafted stout.  Mouthfeel is lighter than a lot of stouts, but the flavor is not subdued in the least. Very tasty. Drinkability is a 5 in my book. This would go great with an espresso or a nice cigar.

113,782,Shultzerdugen,4.82,"I had this in the midst of a super session, and although it wasn't the first time I've had SS's Imperial, it was like the virgin experience.  Next to Belgian triples and doubles,Samichlaus, barley wines, etc., it not only held it's own, it gave the aforementioned beers a kung fu kick in the balls.  Opaque obsidian, no seeing through this sucker. Great head with strong staying power.  So many smells. Prunes, black pepper, licorice, sweet booze. I was salivating like one of Pavlov's dogs after a dinner bell. This Imperial is the A-1 ass kickin' bow down and be thankful for tastebuds thrilla. Great hop balance for such a huge beer. Dark chocolate, coffee, sugary malts. Long finish where the hops return for an encore. Real thick and chewy, smooth and delicious. Sure, I want to drink it again and again.  Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout is a benchmark beer for me, the one I compare all other I S's to. Say thankya!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,neonbrown82,3.87,"This beer was highly recommended by one of the cashiers at my local (and highly knowlegable) beer store. I must agree that it was quite tasty, but it wasn't one of my favorite examples of an Imperial Stout. It tasted like beef jerky almost... more specifically like Liquid Smoke. I usually can't tolerate much more than a little bit of a smokey taste in my beer, but this one might be able to pave the way for me.  It poured to a completely opaque black color with a tan head, as one would expect from any Imperial Stout. The liquid wasn't quite as thick as others I've had, though, but I won't hold that against it, nor in its favor. The mouthfeel seemed to suit this particular iteration of Imperial Stout just fine.  The smell was kind of malty and sweet, but mostly dominated by caramel combined with other roasty coffee aromas. The smell was hypnotizing to say the least.  I enjoyed this Imperial Stout, but I don't think I will revisit as long as I have access to the Rogue Imperial Stout, which IMO is no contest with this. I've heard this is more subdued than its American counterparts, but on behalf of the smoked flavor, I would beg to differ that the Stone RIS or Rogue Imperial Stout are a little less complex in flavor though richer in character and body. Definitely worth a try though.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Phyl21ca,4.5,"Bottle: Poured a opaque black beer with a medium dark brown head with minimal retention. Aroma is quite incredible and consists of pure black chocolate, roasted malt and some coffee. Taste is also quite a treat with the chocolate hitting first (without too much sweetness) and followed by the roasted malt and coffee to finish the whole thing. Very well balance with limited bitterness, which probably makes it one truly good dessert beer. Wow!!!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

You can almost smell the velvety feel it has to it. Great big roasted malt flavor. Wonderful flavors all rolled into one-coffee,anise,dark chocolate. Theres an ""ink"" flavor that I find in some imperials and just love-this is full of that. Good body-not as full as some of the others but it plays well considering the overall flavor and texture of the beer. A highly drinkable brew-at an easy going 7% this could go on all night.

Essentially, it's a mix of roasted malts and alcohol with a slight fruitiness in the finish. It's gloriously smooth, despite the higher alcohol content. The beer burns very slightly in the finish, but the alcohol is far from overpowering. Personally, I prefer a more straight-forward stout. I have to admire the intricate design of this beer, though.  Note: This beer tastes much better as it warms. The flavors become more balanced at higher temperatures.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,allengarvin,4.35,"Appearance: Deep, dark, & mysterious. Very black, only a hint of ruby around the edges. A tan, almost brown head, and excellent lacing.  Aroma: Huge malt aroma, roasted caramel, with fruity, almost winey, port-like fragrance.  Flavor: Incredible malt complexity: dark chocolate, roasted grains (an almost burnt subcurrent), sweetly coffee-ish. A dried plum or raisin fruitiness lingers underneath. An earthy hop flavor and pleasant bitterness rein in the malt and keep it from cloying. Finish is long, with the taste of highly roasted grains sticking around for a long time.  Body: Lots of body, though carbonation is on the low side. Very nice, quite astringent mouthfeel.  I'm not a big stout drinker, but I have to admire the artistry that went into this superb beer. Beautiful and incredibly toothsome.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,waughbrew,4.28,"Black black black is the color of this truly lovely beer. Small creamy light brown cap with great retention and lacing. Aroma is of tar, oats, raspberries, sourness, and acidity. The flavors are all subtle and blend wonderfully: Seems like a cross between a milk, an oatmeal, and an export stout. Smooth tobacco finishes with chocolate, dark fruit and a bit of acidic sting. I do find that overall there is a surprising lack of coffee, chocolate, and alcohol aromas and flavors. Compared to modern expectation of an Imperial stout, this is very mild, but complex nonetheless. Velvety texture. Quaffable.  Sam Smith products tend not to impress me much, but this beer is very good. However, I get a sense of polish on this brew that somehow comes across as being ""over-produced"" like a pop album. Perhaps it is because no flavors stick out much - there are no rough edges. When I want an imperial stout, I want the beer to take chances and be a little bolder. This is a nice, smooth brew that I will remember as a stronger sweet stout with very blended, subtle flavors.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

113,782,cerevisiaephilus,4.8,"Well...I have to give it a 5 for appearance cause you just can't barely see through this beer. Held directly against a 60watt lightbulb reveals just barely a deep deep reddish/auburn hue. This beer is black and proud of it. Really appropriate carbonation and a beautiful head that leaves a touch of lacing on the glass.  Incredible nose. Just incredible. Strikes me as rich rich bitter chocolate. My favorite kind. Some really nice nuttiness there too. A definately some winey notes. You get the signature sam smith notes times 100. Really really nice.  Really fantastic flavors too. Not quite perfect...but really freakin' good. Definately some strong chocolate malts and some roasted notes too. Very pleasing bitterness. Just right. Fairly strong bitterness, but it really just balances out the rich dark malts nicely. Get the standard Sam Smith flavors as well. Really a wonderful beer.  Mouthfeel is right on the money. Perfect.  I could drink this beer all day long. Really one of my favorites. Warming yet not overwhelming. Rich and complex to keep one interested but not bewildering.

Touch of wet-paper and vinegar hint at improper storage - yet this bottle is of recent vintage, shown by the label printed on the bottom rim of the glass.  Any off characteristics fall away from this beer on the first sip. Absolutely undefinable magic with every sip. The wet roastiness of the beer decries no alcohol presence in the slightest.  Mouthfeel is slick and oily with this young sample, but not at all motor-oil viscous like the modern wave of Imperial stouts. Softly chewable. Addictive. Destructive.

Only other thing darker than this is my ex girlfriends soul. But this is a thing of beauty, hers is a thing of disgust. Two finger, fluffy head the colour of Bailey's irish cream. Very little lace. Smells of roasted malt, bitter chocolate, coffee beans, lactose sweetness, and dark fruits. Taste is roasty and bittersweet. First sip is burnt malt, bitter chocolate and bitter hops. Then, after awhile, it mellows out to a nice sweet flavour. Bread, milk, tobacco and fruits, with an almost smokey aftertaste. Mouthfeel is almost syrupy. I like it. I'll be buying this again.

Appearance- A dark brown pour with an average head and avergae lacing. Nothing spectacular, but better than average.  Smell- I had to really sniff to get a good whiff of dark chocolate, roasted malt and a bit of toffee.  Taste- Very good taste, but for on the toffee and coffee side than the chocolate. I just couldn't pick out that much chocolate taste. But, of the taste I did pick up on, it was very good.  Mouthfeel- Nicely carbonated for an IRS. Went down with ease.  Drinkability- I need to try this one again. I drank it right after an extra hoppy barleywine and my buds may have been off.

It also offered a sweet flavor upfront, finishing with deep flavors of chocolate. The mouthfeel was desirable and because of the subdued alcohol it was surprisingly easy to drink. In its drinkability it differed from most other Imperials, as I could definitely drink a few. Samuel Smith's second best beer. It is second only to the Oatmeal Stoudt.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,niknar,4.5,"Pours out a thick, black color with a nice fluffy almond colored head. Head retention was decent, settling to a thin layer across the top within a few minutes. Little to no lacing left behind. The aroma is that of extremely sweet honey and/or molasses, roasted barley, and hints of chocolate and coffee. Also present is the smell of warming alcohol. The flavors mimic the scents as expected: sweet malts and syrups with a nice warming alcohol kick. On top of this, there is a slight carbonation that thins the mix just enough for easy consumption. An easy bitterness finishes off all the sweetness leaving a semi-dry finish. Overall, very well balanced. Mouthfeel is exactly what you would expect from the style: thick and full bodied.

If you look into the glass you see clouds forming and swirling about like cream fingerpaint against a canvas of absence. Beautiful.  Smells like sweet molasses. Hints of coffee and burnt malt. There's also a bit of fruit somewhere in there.  Complex and wonderful flavor. I am overwhelmed and half tempted to just say that this beer is beyond my novice description. Sweet and bitter. Coffee and Cream. Molasses. Bits of heaven. Close your eyes and you're wherever you want to be, your favorite memory of warmth. The first time you taste or experience something new, a new sensation of love or of life, that loss of precious virginity that you simultaneously bemoan and celebrate, that feeling is reborn in every sip.  PERFECT mouthfeel. Beyond fantastic. Full, thick body that doesn't come off as slimy. Just fizzy enough. Fizzy in a strange way, so that it doesn't really affect your the front of your tongue and throat but it tickles the back of your tongue in the most wonderful of ways.

Aroma of heavy chocolate, molasses or sorghum. coffee and roasted barley. Flavor is full on chocolate espresso with a hint of earthy, peaty bitterness and the presence of a pronounced alcoholic punch. Mouthfeel is sweetly powerful with a rich, chewy chocolate texture and a roasted middle with a powerful warming hot liquor punch on the finish. Perfect for a snowy, cold Michigan night. Drinkability is great. Alcoholic and warming punch is much greater than the 7.0 ABV listed. I spent a year in England in college and by the end of that year SS Imp was on my top 2 beers.

It receeded quite a bit, but seems to be ready to hang around. Sweet malt smells, a bit of a fruit aroma, and perhaps a bit of a roasted and molasses smells in there, as well.  Sweet taste of black licorice and dark fruits softly there in the beginning, followed by a nice, heavy roasted flavor, and the flavors of sweet malts. A little fuller body, with a nice, smooth, warm feel to it, rounded out by a nice hop bitterness.  A very, very good beer.

113,782,DrJay,4.6,"Appearance: Almost completely opaque black colour with just a hint of ruby highlights (and those only appear with very strong backlighting). This is topped by a moderately long-lasting, dense brown head that coats the sides of the glass with each sip.  Smell: Dark roasted grain and fruitiness combine to give this beer a complex, malty aroma. Grains contribute mostly chocolate and roasted notes, without being burnt. Rich maltiness is present, and combines with light alcohol notes to give it a vinous character. Fruitiness is reminiscent of dark or dried fruits.  Taste: Dried fruit is strong at the start, along with a sweet maltiness. Roasted grains contribute some character to the middle and provide some balanced dryness to the otherwise sweet finish. Bitterness becomes more evident towards the finish and provides a nice balance by the end. Slight alcohol flavour is evident in the finish.  Mouthfeel: Full-bodied with a velvety texture. Light carbonation adds some texture as well. Alcohol warmth is present, but not strong.  Drinkability: Overall, quite good for the style. Although it's certainly not a session beer, the balance is quite good and would definitely allow for a second to be quaffed in a sitting.

113,782,travolta,3.8,"Apperance: This Imperial Stout had normal head retention. The lacing I will discuss after I have finished the glass. The color is totally dark brown, to simplify would be to say that it is black. I am not even going to hold it to the light because with a beer this dark, it does not matter. The lacing is not something of note. It exists, but barely  Nose: A start of carmel, and coffee. Quite a bit of coffee. That is about it. maybe some dry fig.  Taste: Although there is not very much in the smell department, it makes up for this in the taste. Right away i get fig, carmel, coffee, roasted wheat. It is a bit bitter in the end and it is the bitterness which sticks with you unti your next sip. It does not have a heavy mouthfeel which lends to more distinct characteristics.

Dark chocolate and some deep coffee tones. The strongest aroma is a bold oak and slight bourbon note. Great aromatics!  Milk and dark chocolate with coffee tones. Big oak and a bit of bourbone flavors that carry this Imperial. The alcohol presence is noticeable but not over the top. A subdued bitterness due to the oak character that gives way to a semi-sweet caramel aftertaste.  Full bodied; Very smooth and mellow. Coats the palate well: carbonation is subdued nicely, but IMO it could be a bit more syrupy for my tastes.  This is a very strong Imperial in terms of flavor and aromatics, but where the hell is the alcohol? An imperial stout at 7% abv? That's probably my biggest (only?) knock to this beer.

Taste: Not bad, but I expected more flavor from this one. I mean, the dark appearance and sweet aroma would lead me to believe it'd be a little more rich than it was.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied and relatively smooth & creamy. The alcohol is very deceptive and well hidden in this beer.  Drinkabilty: A good stout, but the price tag and lack of flavor won't have me running out to buy a 6-pack every weekend, that's for sure. It's hard enough putting down 2-3 of these bottles in succession. It's meant to enjoy slowly after a big dinner, not to drink watching a football game.

The smell was great with a slight plum scent breeaking through the coffee and chocolate layers. The taste was decidedly Sam Smith with its great light mouthfeel and perfect carbonation levels and the flavors of dark chocolate, carmel and coffee were so perfectly combined that this has to be the most balanced and drinkable Imperial Stout that I have had to date!

Bubbly, thick deep brown/expresso swirl head with surprisngly good retention. No legs or lacing.  Smell: Not as pronounced as I might have expected for an impy. Vinous, cherry notes up front. Sweet caramel malt with a distinct smokiness.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Very... Samuel Smith. A slightly thin, slightly coating and surprisingly crisp mouthfeel. Starts with a blend of chewy caramel malt, yeast and burnt coffee. Dark fruit/cherry comes midpalette. Finishes dry with a smoky, almost chicory bite and bittering hops. A bit of sugar sourness lingers in the aftertaste.  Drinkablity: Very good for the style; almost a light beer among the ""more is more"" manifesto of contemporary impy stouts.  To be fair, I'm certain that this is a very ""correct,"" traditional example of this style. But... I'll put it this way: An all-original, ""correct"" '57 Chevy Bel-Aire is a classic, a great car. But a '57 Bel-Aire with a 502 c.i. crate motor, six-speed, disc brakes and a 1200-watt sound sytem is a HELL of a lot more fun to drive.

Smell is quite potent, very malty and quite attractive. Taste is good. Very deep, burnt flavor dominates here, much more so than most American imperial stouts. Almost coffee-like, but with a sharp sweet and sour flavor backing it up, the beer is surprisingly tangy. A good try, and I will certainly buy this again if I am in the mood for it, but I would almost NEED to be in the mood for this to drink it. Unusual to say the least.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,crookedhalo,4.2,"Pours an opaque deepest mahogany color with a tan head. Charred, roasty malt character with loads of butterscotch/toffee notes. Gripping sweet roasty flavors with ample carbonation to keep each sip lively on the palate, and the bittersweet finish invites another sip. Very nice and drinkable.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,orbitalr0x,4.3,"This one pours a deep black with a beautiful 1"" tan head that stays its course nicely. I'm not seeing any light penetrating this brew and it looks wonderful in the glass. The smell is of powerful roasted notes, hints of coffee and cocoa as well. There are some burnt grains that enter my nose, overall it smells quite nice.  The first taste is very smooth with a robust roasted / burnt malt flavor...bitter coffee hits the back of my palate on the way down. Chocolate covered raisins fit there way in there somehow too. This is well put together and quite easy to drink.  Mouthfeel is very nice, altough it almost seems a bit lacking in body to me personally. The drinkability factor is very good. This one goes down easily and tastes great. A couple of these and I'd be a happy camper for the night. If you enjoy stouts, and have yet to try this one, get off yer ass and do it already!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,trumick,4.37,"Pours a deep dark brown with very little head and not much lacing.  Scent is of sweet dark malts, dark chocolate, and coffee. The scent is more pronouced as it warms. It has the same scents just more intense.  Taste follows the nose, sweet dark malts, dark bitter chocolate, finishes with slight hops, coffee and a bit sweet. Taste is also more pronounced as it warms and, yes, better.  Mouthfeel, very nice and smooth almost creamy with perfect carbination, meduim to full bodied a bit lighter than I would expect for the style.  Drinkability, danger, this one is very easy to drink. I could put a bunch of these away. This is probably the most drinkable Imp Stout I have ever had. The lower (lower for the style) abv helps.  What a nice beer. The abv is lower and makes this beer that much more apealing. This is one I will definately buy again.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,odeed,3.61,"all the samuel smiths have a bit of the same taste.not saying its a bad thing,they all taste great! the imperial poured out with little head and i could almost make out some light looking through it.as i said,has the sammy smith taste only with a bit of imperial thrown in for good measure. very good stout overall.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,BJ1833,4.72,Appearance: Deep black color with brown two-finger head.  Aroma: Mmm... this already smells delicious. Coffee and chocolate aroma hits you first with a fainter smell of toffee as well.  Taste: A strong coffee and roasted malt flavor. Notes of toffee and caramel as well. This is very rich and complex. Alcohol is present but definitely not overpowering.  Mouthfeel: Heavy body that is creamy and silky. Perfection carbonation in this bottle.  Overall: This is the first imperial stout I've tried and I don't see how they could get any better than this! This is easily the best stout (imperial or otherwise) I've ever had. This beer would make a good winter warmer.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,jvajda,3.33,Appearance: Black as night and a very dark head that dissapates quickly. Smell: Strong smell of sweet bananas in the nose. Taste: Very sweet banana tones and small alcohol taste. Somewhat simple for a stout. Mouthfeel: Creamy. Leaves the lips sticky. Drinkability: I don't feel like this beer has much to offer that would bring me back.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,99bottles,4.2,"Appearance: Into a tulip, this stout poured a very near black color with almost an inch of deep tan head. The retention was lacking, and a thin lace was all that remained after a minute.  Smell: A rich roasted scent from the barely that nearly stings the nostrils, and then wraps them up in soft richness.  Taste: This stout is my Imperial benchmark. It has a very classic taste and flavor; that is of roasted barley, some acidic coffee, very strong notes of dark chocolate, raisins, figs, and alcohol. It has modest bitterness, without too much hop flavor. Very very good.  Mouthfeel: This might be thinner than what most imperial stout drinkers have come to expect. In this case, I think it does well with matching the flavor to the viscosity and thickness of the beer.  Drinkability: A great beer to herald in the change of the seasons. This is a nice beer to sip, and though I think multiple bottles coudl be consumed in one sitting, I'd rather sit and reflect over one.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,sutcliff,4.03,"This was the first imperial stout I ever tried years ago and I made it a point to have a pint of it on a regular occassion. An excellent example of the style with a warm, rich taste, and a low amount of hop aroma. The color is a deep black and the head was significant.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,CAMRAhardliner,4.53,"The Victorian style label is very cool.  The beer pours pure black with a big tan head and good lacing. The aroma is of sweet cocoa powder, with the expected coffee and roasted barley notes as well. The taste is incredibly rich and complex. The coffee flavors are so well defined. There is a diversity of chocolatey flavors. The hops very evident. Theres also a smokey faintly acidity (from the roasted barley?). The carbonation is light in this thick brew making for a creamy mouthfeel. This beer is eminently drinkable because it is so well balanced and alcohol flavors are completely concealed behind a wall of richness. An excellent Imperial Stout.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,meathookjones,3.38,"I havent had a bottle of this in years, basically the last time I had it I was still drinking craft brew from the bottle. So seeing how it is right behind on of my favorites in Stone Russian imperial stout I had to pick it up to review it. Pours out used oil black that looked a little thinner than other RIS I have had but great nonetheless. A full dark tan head formed atop the oily liquid and left no much in the way of lace as it faded away. There seems to be a strong smell of chocolate liquor coming from this with fruits and a bit of alcohol as well. Sweet chocolate covered fruit came to mind when I first sipped this. Chocolate and a touch of coffee were also present as well as a bittersweet finish. There was an odd sour taste that hit me a few times that was very unpleasant, not sure what this is from. Mouthfeel was good but not as thick as other Imperial Stouts but creamy still. Drinkability was lower than I would have though with that odd taste really putting me off. Not sure if I got a bad bottle or what but I plan on revisiting this in the future and giving it another chance.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,garymuchow,4.43,"I sat on this for a few months after purchase (don't ask me why, 'cuz I don't know), plus how long did it sit in the store? Nonetheless, it didn't seem worse for the wear. Aroma is heavy sweet malt, like molasses and with a strong fruit quality and bits of roast. As it pours it looks lighter in color, but once in the glass it's black as night. One inch firm dense head. Flavor is rich without being excessive. Pushes cloy but never too much. Fruit. Roast. Coffee. Really sweet up front, moderate bitterness in middle that adds nice comlexity. Smooth as silk. One of the softest smoothest beers I""ve ever head. Appropriately thick. Everything is perfectly balanced for style. Dessert, slow sipper or multi-purpose beer. Excellent.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Jacobier10,4.1,"A truly beautiful appearance. Pitch black with the darkest tan head I have ever seen. Awesome! The only reason this didn't get a 5 for appearance is because it left virtually no lacing on the glass. Great aroma as well. Very crisp and fresh for something with such a dark and roasted smell. Full bodied beer that contains flavors of caramel, roasted malts, and coffee, but it has a touch of sweetness to it. Very creamy mouthfeel. The drinkability takes a hit due to the high alcohol content and the thickness of this beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,SilentSabre,4.15,"Poured black as tar with about a 15cm thick dirty off-white head. The smell is absolutely fantastic, if you like this style of course. Roasted malt, chocolately, a little fig like, some caramel. The taste, too, is very chocolatey with that burnt malt taste I do love so about this style. Very smooth. Very easy to drink. Quite heavy, however, and three or less in a single sitting would be plenty. Excellent.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,rajendra82,4.3,"The beer came in a 550 ml. sturdy looking clear (why?) bottle that released an a dark brown liquid with red highlights. This beer does not have the inky black look of other imperial stouts. The head was coffee-colored and formed at about 1½ inches thick initially, but then quickly dissipated to a thin layer of foam and some decent lace. The aroma was roasted coffer and dark chocolate goodness, with a dollop of dark skinned fruits thrown in the mix. The taste was a delightfully intense balance between the sweet flavors of raisins, figs, toffee, and apples; and bitter notes of old coffee and unsweetened chocolate. The alcohol warmth was pretty tepid for an imperial stout, and is clearly not the draw in this beer. The mouthfeel was also quite a bit lighter that the big boys, but was satisfying nonetheless. An easy drinking stout that is clearly a step above the ordinary, but remains very approachable still. A sessionable imperial stout if you will.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,dmbfrat420beers,4.6,"Presentation - Attractive clear (why do so many British breweries use clear bottles?) bottle with white label declaring Sam Smith's as the ""contractors to Her Majesty's foces"" haha.  Appearance - Dark with red tint around the edges. Big, tightly packed tan head. Lacing clings nice and thick to the side of the mug - very nice touch.  Aroma - hmm...very different from the other Imperial Stouts I have tried (Stone '04 and Old Rasputin). I would describe it as sort of a musty smell with grassy hop hints and some alcohol. Very strong, especially as you get ready to drink.  Mouthfeel - full bodied, decent carbonation  Taste - Like Sam Smith's India Ale, this beer is a far cry from its American style cousins. Strong grassy hop flavor up front that gives way to an ample roasted malty sweetness. Hints of bitterness left on the lips and in the back of the mouth, but otherwise turns into an almost candy like sweetness on the sides of the cheeks and tounge. Also leaves a nice fruity tartness. Lots of flavors going on here and it changes quite a bit from sip to swallow. Finishes very clean, no alcohol flavor to speak of, except a warm feeling as it goes down. Quite tasty and complex, though I wish there were little more of a bitter kick, but that is just my predilection.  Drinkability - Thought by the size and pungent aroma this beer would not go down easily, but was suprised about how easy it was to drink.  Final Words: Bought a 4-pack of this for $10, can't wait to finish the rest. The best of their beers I have had so far. It is hard to say how this compares to the American Double Stouts, they seem so very much different.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,beertaster13,4.88,"I have found the stout to end all stouts. Pours a deathly crude oil black with streaks of ruby, the mocha/tan head is wickedly awesome and the lacing will leave gobs on the glass. The smell is of espresso and mocha chocolate raisins. A slight nut smell as well, alcohol is detectable. The taste is pure glory, the sweetness of the roasted chocolate invites you for more, a graham cracker marshmellow sweetness is icing on the cake. Hints of fruit, dried raisins detected. Alcohol is detected as well. Medium bodied for a stout, not to thick but perfect to invite more and more, a very drinkable stout and will become the staple for me. Awesome.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,mattcrill,3.56,"I guess I'm going to be the one to go against trend here but I can't help how I feel about this beer. So here it goes....  Appearance: Great appearance. Pours black as black can be. Lovely dark brown head that forms but after one sip, it's gone. Still, it leaves nice lacings around the glass.  Smell: Very complex. I definitely smell dried fruits (raisins or prunes) with some malty undertones. I don't pick up much other than the sweetness.  Taste: This is where I was let down. I really enjoyed the taste however, I just thought it was a very one-dimensional brew. I picked up the taste of licorice, raisins, and a slightly dry and mild alcohol finish. It just didn't taste as big or as complex as I had hoped.  Mouthfeel: Very full and chunky but not very balance. Virtually no carbonation which made this beer feel very heavy.  Drinkability: I can't imagine having more than one of these at a time. Leaves you feeling very full.  Overall: I'd definitely recommend trying it once. Maybe this is closer to the true style of an RIS and maybe the only ones I've tried have deviated from this standard. So maybe I'm the one that's screwed up. Also, with all the review I read, expectations were pretty high. Who knows...",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,tjd25,4.62,"Very silky thick and foamy head. I had the impression that it disappeared quicker than some for some other samuel smith brews. The body is of an intense black color, totally opaque.  The smell shows an emphasis on a roasted coffee aspect with fruity notes of chestnut. Earthy and bread-like cereal character, with hints of bacon bites. The fruity character is quite developed.  The taste shows a strong coffee aspect, combined with a dark chocolate bitterness and a sweet fruitiness, almost slightly citric. Almost burnt grain, and maybe a very light hint of liquorice. Alcohol gets noticeable in the finish, quite warming and not overwhelming. Just enjoyable.  The mouthfeel is incredibly round, very smooth, but not really creamy, with a thick dark chocolate grassy bitterness. The alcohol progressively warms the throat, but this brew is still almost as drinkable as water. Very nice.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,mobyfann,4.38,"Paid $2.49 for a 12 oz. bottle...  The appearance on this one was quite nice for a stout, typical black-brown base with the chocolatey colored small-to-mid sized low carb head and a great lacing effect on the glass. The aroma is pleasent, a nice mocha smell to it, with a few hints of some fruits.  The taste is great, a simple but productive stout with all hints of the aroma plus some caramel and roasted goodness, absolutely splendid. The mouthfeel is great, smooth as a 7% stout could get, feels less heavy than some porters that I've sampled as well. The drinkability is high as this stout went down fast and smoothly.

113,782,JISurfer,4.3,"Wow! This had a nice deep, rich, chocolate/dark fruit taste to it. Was very thick and chewy, just like I like 'em. The head was super thick and pillowy in the beginning, but then died out to a laceing. I would reccommend this brew to anyone who hasn't had it yet. I thought it was a little better when it was colder, but that's just me. All in all a great imperial and a top notch example of the style.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,ALESwhatCURESya,4.35,"Pitch black with thick beige head that decided to stick around for the entire time. Sweet matly, nutty and mollasses aroma off the head.

Thumbs up!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,bigone4,4.67,This is a great stout straight from England. Great color and aroma. Smooth stout I really enjoy drinking this beer a little below room temp.

113,782,kegerator,4.95,"I enjoyed this beer quite a bit. Poured out black as night with a nice brown head, appearance was right on for this style. the best way i can describe the aroma is oily chocolate with some hints of coffee and port. I was excited by this. taste was just about the same as the aromas, but I wasn't getting the oily part in the taste. very smooth. I will buy this one again for sure. It would have gotten all 5's and probably deserves it but in comparison this one just didn't quite have the heartiness of storm king almost too smooth. get it and taste it. you won't be disappointed",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,SBPCGuru,4.33,"When this baby was poured out of her clear glass dwelling, it was of a deep dark blackish-brown color with a thick inch or so of head. You stick your nose into this beer before that first tasting, and it revs up your senses for a malted wonderland. The taste going down is nicely complimented by its buttered rye bread aftertaste. Each sip brings the aroma of nutty malted goodness before this masterpiece rolls over your palette. The head follows the beer down the side of the glass until the last sip. This is stout worthy of more tastings in the future.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,smcolw,4.4,"Not even opaque, this is a dark, dark mahogany brew. This features a truly awesome head for a bottle. Deep tan in color, the head leaves an impressive sticky lace throughout the tasting.  Strong oily alcohol fullness in the aroma. Powerful dark malt richness--chocolate, black patent malts.  Rich and oily, this is a beer to be consumed slowly. Strong chicory coffee flavors. Unlike pale ales, the hop is used strictly as a spice. The aftertaste is long lasting and bitter in an espresso way (the hop is quietly present as a touch of counterbalance) . This is a big beer in every way.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Black, opaque beer, appears almost as soy sauce. Smell was rich in coffee, bill gates-rich, even. The bitter aroms coreesponded with the bitter flavors, the flavor was off the charts. Not a session brew, that's for sure. It makes you pause after every sip and try to recover, almost as the challenge of drinking hot sauce. A good, huge beer. May or may not get it again. I almost prefer a smoother sipping stout.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Hagbard,4.41,"Black as night. So dark, it makes it impossible to tell whether the bottle is, in fact, clear or not until you pour (it is). A nice thick, creamy, dark tan head forms, making for an impressive looking beer sitting in my goblet. A beautiful sweet dark malt aroma tantalizes your nose, waiting for the promise of the taste. There is definitely some dark chocolate in the background of the aroma. The taste is simply wonderful! The smoothest imperial stout I've ever had the privilege to drink. Dark chocolate, plums, and even a nutty presence all make themselve known. All riding a great malt background. Truly a great tasting stout! I get none of the typical off flavors common to stouts. The mouthfeel is thick and full, as an imperial stout should be. It is dangerously drinkable due to the smoothness. The 7% ABV is hidden. It goes down very easily! I love this beer and wish it could be had more readily to me. Another great stout from Samuel Smith.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

But, this one was amazing, very drinkable yet very real, very hoppy, very thick = very happy.  In particular the beauty of this beer (and one of the greatest things about all imperial stouts) is the great mouthfeel. As this thick syrup slides down my throat and sticks to the sides of my mouth I can hardly believe that this substance can even be called by the same name as what most people gulp down by the can all over this country, I really feel the calling to spread the word to the ends of the earth that a veil has been drawn over the eyes of the public and this dark slosh is just the substance to wash away ignorance and replace it with a knowledge of thick, full, roasted goodness!!!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

This is not the highest-alcohol imperial stout you will find, but it is high quality. One of the smoothest stouts...as dark as one can find..I've often wondered why it would be in a clear bottle.

The thick head was a nice beige color. Like my son said the top is brown and the bottom is black.  The smell was very thick and strong. Very strong and acidic. Only as it warmed did the chocolate overtones start to show up.  The taste started with very strong malt sweetness followed by an acidic middle with a finish of alchohol and lingering chocolate and malt.  This would make a great sipping beer to sit around with friends and discuss the merits of life with. I have one extra bottle, I think I'll put it away for about a year and revisit this one.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Rastacouere,4,"Very dark brown body with a finely laced beige head, short-lasting. Aroma is very malty, full of dark chocolate, very roasty with coffee notes. A good hops mariage complement it all. I don't get much fruitiness in the aroma, but in mouth, there's plenty of them, lots of blackberries and plums. Mouthfeel is full, more carbonation than most. This possesses one of the most balanced roastiness I've met in the dry, almost smokey finish. Alcohol appears more and more as it warms, I'd have thought this is higher than 7%, I guess they sure didn't want to make it weak, it worked. Very full-flavoured and pleasant. Refined and less acid than most american renditions. Cheers to Matta for sending this a few decades ago!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Gueuzedude,4.25,"Pours a deep black color that is topped by a creamy head. Thick aromas of molasses, coffee, chocolate, and dense dark malts all are found in the nose. Surprisingly any roast malt character is pretty subdued. This beer has a light creamy mouthfeel, with a finish of roast malts. The taste is reminiscent of malt balls, with molasses notes up front. The finish is sweet but it is balanced by a burnt acidity, the combination of the two is quite good. I also get notes of espresso and burnt raisins. This is pretty good, I haven't had one of these in years, and hopefully I will revisit this one sooner rather than later.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,DPMomutant,4.47,"Pours the standard (but beautiful) stout pitch black. Head is a surprising 2 fingers, kind of creamy but bubbly on the side. Takes a little while to go down, some sticks to the side. A little swirl produces a few more bubbles that come up more light red than anything.  A very pleasing toasty malt and fruit smell comes from this brew. This strives to let you know it's there but is wonderfully subtle, just strong enough to get your nose interested.  The taste is a combination of toasty malt, lightly sweet fruit, and dark cocoa. Stimulating without being dominant.  The mouthfeel, while warming, does a great job of masking the 7% ABV. Not harsh in any way at all.  For a stronger beer, I find this very drinkable. A bunch of these would knock you silly but a few would be very enjoyable. I had planned to only have one tonight but I'm thinking about another.  I haven't had the chance to compare this to any of it's higher ABV rivals but I find this one to be the best of any type of stout I've had and it makes me want to try more.

Rum flavors mixed with fruit up front move to a coffee flavor with a light alcohol flavor. Molasses show up in the finish and leave a sweet-alcohol aftertaste.  This is my first imperial stout and it is nothing short of awesome.

There's a lot of taste to this beer. Some raisins, roasted malts, and coffee. It goes down smooth and creamy but i love to take my time with this one making sure it is at room temp before the last drop hits the back of my tongue.

The aroma is an experience unto itself: Roasted barley, toasted malts, caramel, coffee, chocolate, ethanol, caramelizing sugar, and ripe plums. Its simply a phenomenal smell!! Taste is solidly roasted barley with a heavy hoppiness and syrupy sweetness. Coffee-like bitterness, considerable heft (and almost chewy-ness), low carbonation contribute to the character of the beer. Bitterness and sweetness are very well balanced.

Tastes of sweet roasted malt, espresso, milk chocolate, red fruit, burnt brandy and black licorice. Wonderfully balanced with a pleasant bitterness, a smidge of salt and a lingering wisp of smoke. Just an outstanding melding of great flavors! Medium bodied but a little light for the style. Lower in alcohol and lacking that viscous mouthfeel I love about Imperials. That being said...what a mouthfeel! One of, if not THE creamiest, velvety smooth beers I've ever had. Perfect amount of carbonation leads to the easiest and best drinking Imperial on the market. IMHO. An outstanding Imperial worthy of the hype!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,NJpadreFan,2.6,"Samuel Smith has a few good offerings out there but this is NOT 1 of them.  Sam Smith Imperial Stout poured black with a thick creamy head that would not quit. The smell is of toasty roasted coffee and chocolate. I also detect an alcohol odor present. The taste was BLAHHHH! Sweet and bitter. The bitterness and alcohol taste made this seem like oven cleaner or some other nasty house cleaning item! Ughh... I honestly think someone poisoned me!  Sorry Sam Smith fans ( I honestly like the oatmeal stout, and organic lager) this is one beer ""Her Majesty's Forces"" can keep!!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Ieatlambfries,4.48,"The appearance of this Imperial was exceptional in my opinion. Not only was it an opaque opal color, but, it also had a nice 2 finger dark tan head that just lingered. It looked so darn good. Even when the head did start to go down it left a curtain of lace that would then form perfect rings around my glass. This was a visual 5, no doubt about it. The smell was excellent as well. A caramel nuttiness, with plenty of roasted malts and coffee notes. To me it's a similar smell to the Taddy Porter. The taste was of burned caramel, roasted espresso beans and roasted sweet malts. It also had the sweetness of burned fruits, raisons, and dates. The mouthfeel, although very good, was a bit thinner than I expected. Again, not bad at all, but from the richness of the rest of the experience I expected a bit more body. Very drinkable, the exceptional taste of this Imperial makes you wish winter would last a bit longer so you could squeeze a few more sessions in around the fire place.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Reidrover,4.51,"Ok can't believe I havent had this classic before. Comes in the usual clear Sam Smith pint bottle.. This is athe classic looking stout..black for the most part though mahogany accents round the edges appear when its held to the light..lovelly tan head..great looking lace. The smell is dominated by the roasted, toasty malts, sweet black fruits, slightly milky. Sweet when it first hits the tongue then a lemon rind bitter zestiness seems to clean that off the palate..then the esspresso coffee bitterness takes over..with creamy undertonesfinishes of with a nice hop kick at the back of the throat..alcohol is barely tastable. An adventure for the taste buds, excellent on the palate. ASn exceptionally drinkable Imperial Stout..maybe lower in alcohol than many others nowadays..but its big on taste and character.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,TinusTime,4.53,"Pours a shade of black as dark as a starless night. Nice 2 fingered tan head that lasts for a good long while and laces well. The aromas are of a bit of bitter chocolate, strong coffee and a bit of brandied dried fruits. Taste is echoed.. Nice espresso roasted coffee notes in the taste with the chocolate and dried fruits adding some depth. This is one tasty treat. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with only a bit of the alcohol showing through. Drinkability is high for a stout of this stature and magnitude. One of the best you can find. One can only imagine the number of foods this beauty could pair with. Have one of these with dessert instead of coffee.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,stewart124,4.83,Pours a pitch black with a huge tan head. Very fluffy head that leaves a beautiful lace. Aroma is of espresso and roasted malts. Initial tastes of chocolate and coffee with blends of fruits and a nice velvet body that soothes the throat. This is extremely thick and has hints of plums. Outstanding silky feel and an overall great beer. The aftertaste is of an almost wine character. The flavors only become stronger as this brew warms. As the bottle states this is truly a drink for Her Majesty's Forces.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,SeanChouffe,4.6,"A great stout. Pours a deep black color with a light brown head. Sticky lace ? head diminishes quickly. The aroma is complex: malty, roasted stuff, chocolate, coffee and some fruit. The flavor is sweet and dry with a spicy finish and roasted tastes that hang around for a while. The mouthfeel is full: creamy and smooth with a dry finish. One of my favorites.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,CortexBomb,4.25,"Pours perfectly black as expected but the head disappeared rapidly, in any case it lets off a nice aroma of fruit and roast, which invites you to partake.  Taste is rich and varied, just to name off a few of the flavours: roasted barley, raisen/prune, a sweet milk bit, a nice back of the tongue hop bitter for a moment, and an overall coffee/chocolate tinged aspect, really tasty.  Mouthfeel definitely has some body while drinkability on this is about par for the course with imperials, good for people used to drinking them, not at all good for less adventurous taste buds :-)",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Chsyhkr,3.49,"The grand daddy of Imperial Stouts.  Clear bottle leads to some funny aromas, surprised? Not me. Why do they do that...Get rid of the clear bottles.  Other than funny the aromas are ripe fruit and roast, very complex.  Leading to the same type of flavors, prunes and complex roasted flavors with plenty of hops in the end.  Not really strong enough for an Imperial Stout, 7.0%. But plenty warming.  Enjoy, just make sure you don't get a skunked one!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Zorro,4.75,"Pours a dark black brew, this is in fact clear, IF! You have a 500-watt bulb to hold it up too.  Smell is sweet and malty, reminds me of a doppel bock. Solid fruitiness to this beer, and a touch of sourness. Toffee and brown sugar smells are here too. There is a solid chocolate smell to this.  Taste is very rich, to many flavors to catch on the first taste, strong chocolate flavor. Complex toffee, and then smoke and then, milk, and then coffee and then chocolate. Caramel is in here, Vanilla, Nuts, and many more. A VERY big brew.  Mouthfeel is thick like I like it.  Very drinkable to me, but will probably kill a Budweiser fan. A Master brew unlike the ""Hop Monsters"" that just overplay a single aspect. GREAT brews have 10-20-30+ Different dimensions of excellence, not just one. I like this companys Oatmeal stout a bit better than this one, but this is a world class brew none the less.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,WesWes,4.03,"The beer pours a dark black color with a thick brown head. The aroma is great. It boasts of crystal, chocolate, and black barley. The taste is good. It is a smooth and rich dark beer with real flavor. There are a lot of chocolate and crystal malts here with some black barley for color and crisp roasted flavor. The mouthfeel is good. It is a full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a fine drinking stout. It's not much of a sessions ale, but it's one to enjoy. That's for sure.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,ManekiNeko,4.12,"12 oz bottle served at cellar-like temperatures in a Trois Pistoles goblet.  Appearance: Jet black topped by a thick dark tan head made of eensy weensy bubbles. Dissipates rather quickly to a scant film and a small ring. Wee bits of lacing were left on the glass.  Smell: Nice delicate balance atwixt coffee and prune aromas. Not as intense or as over-the-top as some (well, most) American versions.  Taste: Heavy roasted malts with prune-like dark fruit flavors. Coffee notes. Hearty with some light hopping on the finish. Sweet malts throughout the entire profile.  Mouthfeel: Oddly lighter in body than most imperial stouts I've had. Still, pretty dang thick.  Drinkability: I'd say that, judging solely by the brewery, that this is a very traditional Imperial Stout. Nice and tasty, but I like more coffee and chocolate flavors.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,HiroProtagonist,4.05,"Samuel Smiths Imperial Stout was served from a 550 ml clear bottle. When the beer was poured into an imperial pint glass, a thick and rich rocky tan head formed, then settled after a minute into a thinner but darker brown blanket, leaving thick lacing. The beer itself was impervious to light, except at the thinner bottom, where some deep ruby was seen to shine through. The nose was loaded with notes of ripe plantain, dark chocolate, sweet banana, and molasses... an intersting contrast to the nose of many of the top American imperial stouts. The taste was highly influenced by the nose. A mellow roasted malt base holds up flavors of molasses and dark chocolate, with subtle suggestions of banana coming through in the lingering semi-dry and well-bittered finish. The body was a little thin for an imperial stout, but wasnt too detrimental to the overall experience. As this was a toned down imperial stout, not in flavor but in body and alcohol content, it was very drinkable. Overall a solid and fine tuned piece of work, sure to please most stout lovers, but may dissapoint junkies of Expedition, Speedway, or Storm King Stout.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Foxman,4.38,"It pours impassibly dark, black of body with deep brown highlights at the edges. A quick light brown head scrambles upward, then settles slowly to a thin blanket of earth-toned foam. There are thin splotches of sticky lacing.  The aroma conveys a deep roasted grain sweetness trussed by a certifiable vinous character. The air is very basic with a mild bitterness countered against the malt body.  A malt sweetness rumbles forth in the flavor then swerves, just before becoming cloying, giving way to a mellow dark roast bitterness. A warm port character slips into the middle before the grain steps forward again. The finish brings a fading sweetness tempered by a distant hops bitterness.  Thick bodied, the heavy texture coats like a slinky dense liquor, leaving a syrupy sweetness on the palate.  I'll admit it's sweeter than I expected, but as just a piece of this tasty puzzle, that's an asset. One of the more truly balanced Imperial Stouts, it's big, but not humongous; full, but not bloated; dense, but far from over-complicated. The rather moderate ABV and fetching features make this emminently drinkable and enjoyable. It's a fine taste of England, and if it's even better on that side of the pond, then maybe I should be buying a plane ticket first thing.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,BuckeyeNation,4.47,"Sable with dark bronze highlights at the edges. The beer is topped by a thick, sponge-like head that's medium brown and looks like it'll hang around a while. It falls slowly, eventually to a thick film, and doesn't leave much lace. There's a little above the receding surface of the beer, but that's about it.  The nose has some power behind it... strong, dark coffee with molasses and spicy dark fruit. The flavor reminds me of blackstrap molasses mixed with black licorice; the strong, less-sweet British version of licorice. There are also espresso and bitter black tea notes, but they aren't nearly as strong as the molasses and licorice.  The mouthfeel is full and rich, but doesn't quite match the flavor in terms of seriousness. I'm not sure if a more full body would be good for this beer or not. It might take a bite out of the drinkability, which is quite good as is. The relatively low ABV (for an Imperial stout) helps the quaffability.  This is my first Imperial stout and I'm impressed. The temperature is currently in the single digits and it's overcast and spitting snow. Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout is warming me nicely and I may just have to follow it with another.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,winomark,2.78,"Appearance: Jet black with a substantial foamy brown head.  Aroma: Smells like chocolate licorice. Slightly sweet with toasty and yeasty notes.  Taste: Quite bitter and sour up-front, with a medicinal finish. Some chocolate tones.  Mouthfeel: Dry, but coating. Again, bitterness and sourness dominate.  Drinkability: Not a favorite of mine. Don't like the sourness of this stout.  Tasted blind at the Saint Louis BA tasting 12/14/03",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Stimack,4.33,"Wow! What a fantastic beer. I have to say that I was blown away with it. Pours to a midnight black color with creamy light brown head. The smell is marvelous, chocolate and a spicy rum smell. They go well together. The first sip and I was shocked, holy cow this is a great beer! The taste is thick and heavy with hints of chocolate, raisins and is out of this world. It has a very smooth feel to it with good carbonation. I feel I could drink this beer night or at least until my face meet the floor!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,alexgash,4.41,"Pours an oily black with a creamy tan head. Very nice. Smells of chocolate pudding, raisins, and roasted rum. Mmmmm. If the nose is a little reserved, the taste makes up for it. Very rich, whiskey-sweet malts. Notes of chocolate and raisins. Followed and balanced nicely by a dose of hops. Finish is bitter, slightly roasty, with noticeable, warming alcohol. Not as thick or strong as many other imp. stouts I know and love, but still great.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,BeefyMee,4.06,"Appearance: Black with a tan head. Decent lacing. When it was in the bottle I could hold it up and get a little glint of light through it. Now that I have poured it, it has become a black hole.  Smell: Chocolate and a faint alcohol scent.  Taste: A lot going on here. Chocolately and cookie-like with some smokiness to boot. Every few sips there's a fruitiness as well that is something along the lines of raisins or currants or maybe prunes. As I drank, the smoke flavor became more evident. The alcohol is barely noticeable.  Mouthfeel: So creamy and wonderful.  Drinkability: Alcohol is not a factor here, only flavor. The last half of the beer was simply not as good as the first half.  I might need more time to figure this beer out. I can certainly see myself coming back to it.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,RootedFool,4.16,"Pours pitch black and beautiful. I held this mother up to a lightbulb, for only a second, and it is totally impervious to light.  Burnt chocolate, licorice and coffee come through on the nose right away, and a light sourness -- perhaps due to the clear bottle? Bad batch? Well, if this was bad, it was still good.  Mouthfeel not as creamy as I expected, but coated my mouth nicely.  Rich roasted flavor of coffee and chocolate followed by an understated hop bitterness.  Just the right amount of carbonation.  The alcohol content is barely detectable, but warming.  Can't say I'd go for this again, there are many more beers to try, but it was a worthwhile experience.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

The beer was coffee black in color, almost light abosorbing. The aroma was of creamy chocolate, dark malt, and alcoholic raisins. The flavor was rich and creamy, some burnt malt and a little cocoa. A great beer with rich flavor and a smooth finish.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,BCMan,4.73,My favorite thing about Sam Smith Imperial Stout is the look on the people around me's faces when I pour it and they realize that the bottle is clear. Most of them cringe and make some annoying comment about cough syrup. This beer is black with no chance of light getting through it. (even if you hold it directly in front of the light) It pours up a nice frothy brown head that lingers a bit before fading back to the drink. The aroma is interesting. Imagine what thick and dark might smell like and then have one of these and see if you were close. The flavor build straight through the after taste and lingers a bit. This guy Sam Smith must have beed a pretty cool cat!,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,twilight,4.87,"This is the beer dreams are made of. The taste of the roasted barley. Chocolate. Coffee. Molasses. Even a hint of butterscotch in the aftertaste. This should be the one they judge all stouts by....  Points off for the loss of the small brown head, but points for the inky blackness and the elegance of the brew in a nonick pint and the head retention around the edges of the glass. It smells sweet, almost like caramel, but dark as night. The taste is heavenly, thick and full. Heavy and beautiful, almost like drinking candy.  I know I couldn't drink this all night, for fear of passing out on someone's lap, but oh, is it so good.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,necoadam,4.75,"Yummy!! Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout reminds me of two great brews put together. Apperance reminds me of Victory's Storm King Imperial Stout. Looks jet black with excellent amount of carbonation. Smell consists of chocolate and prunes mostly. Taste is what it's all about. It reminds me of Victory's Storm King and Sam Adam's Cream Stout put together. It's got that creamy aftertaste which makes it complex. And at 7.0%ABV, you wouldn't even know it's that much (the taste that is), although it does warm your throat and stomach which is a nice feel. Truly one of the best beers money can buy. I would recommend this beer just about to anyone.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

113,782,FranklinPCombs,3.93,"Definately a good stout. It pours the typical deep-tinted brown of most stouts with a thick coffee head and lovely sticking lace. There are sharp smells of chocolate and coffe, but it also has a heavy spiced meat smell, and malt hops are evident. The taste is definately spicy meats and coffee, with lots of toasted malts, and a slight burnt flavor. The head gives its own very spicy taste. The mouthfeel is charmingly thick, bordering on too thick, but still within the limits of being good. The strength and thickness of the flavor of this beer make it seem more alcoholic than it is. Drinking it made me very warm.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Beastdog75,3.93,"Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout is supposedly the crown jewel in the brewery's lineup of beers. I saw all the good reviews here on BA and figured that this was one of the ""beer to end all beers."" I guess I set myself up for a big letdown, because while this was still a very nice stout, it doesn't hold up as a world class beer to me.  This beer pours a jet black color with a nice, medium-dark brown head that retains well and leaves some lace. The fact that this beer was lightstuck didn't help matters any, as the smell was mostly skunk. As it subsided, there were some roasted notes and a tiny bit of toffee smell. The mouthfeel was slick, oily and sticky (it made one of my sensitive teeth hurt). The flavor was good, but it lacked complexity for the most part. A deep roasted malt flavor pervades through most of the beer. The only flavor notes I picked up on were some licorice, unsweetened chocolate, and burnt coffee/espresso, and all of these in low quantities. There is a reasonable alcohol flavor in the brew, and some of it actually went up my nose when drinking, leading to some alcoholic warmth in my sinuses. The finish has a deep, roasted bitterness that lingers through the aftertaste for many minutes. There is enough alcoholic warmth to put some fire in your belly as well.  At one of my frequent beer stops, there are usually some unopened Sam Smith's cases on the floor where I generally get my samples. Unfortunately, no cases on the floor for this one (these were actually the only two 500ml bottles left on the shelf). This is definitely less sweet than the Oatmeal Stout, and carries much more of a punch. If this weren't carrying the Sam Smith's name, I probably would have been pleasantly surprised, but the flavor came across to me as one-dimensional and almost boring. I will resample this at a later time, hoping that it was just my particular samples that were unremarkable.  Re-rate: 9/28/04 - Finally secured a non-lightstruck bottle, and I must say that there is a world of difference. No skunk in site. The aroma had notes of chocolate, spices and licorice. All of the flavors that I mentioned were in ""low quantities"" above were now quite pronounced and delicious. The posted score now reflects this sample. (The original ratings were: apperance - 4.5, smell - 2.5, taste - 3.5, mouthfeel - 4.0, drinkability - 3.5 for an overall rating of 3.55)",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,LuckySevens82,4.55,"Tried this one on a whim. I was very pleased.  This is one of the thickest stouts I've ever tried. That being said I would have expected it to be bitter, but it turns out this stuff is so smooth it's insane.  The aroma is a coffee/light chocolate and the head is maybe the thickest I've seen. I'm very much looking forward to getting this beer again and saving it for a special occasion.  03.17.05: After re-reading some of my reviews I came across this one. I admit it. I was naive when I tried this. I'm currently drinking a glass of Czar Jack from Town Hall. By no means is Sam Smith's Imperial stout thick in comparison. While still a fine beer. I don't think that I can really compare it to some of the American Double Stouts that have been gracing my glasses as of late. My rating still stands.

113,782,Naerhu,3.87,"Rereview 6Feb05 I must have got a bad bottle, as this tasted like sherry. None of the licorice or any of the other complex flavors were present. I would give this beer street 3.0 ratings just based on that experience. It must have been the condition of the bottle. It is my opinion that this bad bottle was brought on by the design flaw of coming in a clear bottle as a gimmick. And have therefore reduced each of the ratings from my prior tasting by 0.5 points.  Review 23Dec03 Small tan head. Opaque black body. Clear bottle is pretty, but clear (and in my opinion a detration) Complex molasses, coffee aroma and maybe dried black figs.

Pours a dark near ink black into the glass with 2 inchs of head that slowly disapates to a ring that leaves nice laceing down the inside of the glass. The smells of mocha and the alcohol makes it known that it is there. Taste...wow. This stout has an initial taste of mocha/coffee and finishes dry and warms the tummy up right nicely. The 7% abv really bites you (in a good way). As the beer warms you just want to sip it and sit back and relax. Samual Smith got it right with this one, no doubt. Its a dark, strong stout that is right nice on a winter night.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Realale,3.23,"Clear black with a significant ruby component. Nice very fine mocha head.  Nose is initially sour cherry with a touch of chocolate. The fruitiness comes more into balance with time and a medicinal aspect appears. Rather distinctive nose.  On the thin side of medium in the mouth. A little light on malt, and comes off a touch sweet. Really could use more bitterness to balance. Average length.  Mouthfeel is fine. Quite drinkable for an Imperial, but not terribly interesting.  Tasted blind at the 12/14/03 St. Louis BA tasting. This was perhaps the most conspicuous victim of the blind tasting format. This bottle certainly did not live up to the lofty reputation of the beer, yet nothing indicated a bad or mistreated bottle to me.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Crosling,4.24,"An exceptionally fine looking ale. Pours black with the faintest hints of drying molten lava just under the head. The head is light tan and dies rather quickly but leaves a nice ring around the Goblet. Some of the lace sticks to the glass while other parts fall back into the head.  The nose is awesome! A definate sweet smokiness shines through. Dark malts topped with melting caramel and chocolate with a tub of I cant Believe it's not butter thrown it. Absolutely fantastic aroma. I can't wait to try this.  Very drinkable. Exceptional flavor. Nice sweet chocolate flavor with burnt caramel corn, toffee, roasted coffee, butter, dried plums and alcohol. Poor mouthfeel which set this beer back quite a bit but very drinkable with an nice lingering aftertaste that stays in your mouth minutes after swallowing.

Aromas of roast malt, chocolate, espresso, and currant tickle my happy nose. My mouth soon joins in the ecstasy, with chocolate, currant, espresso, malt, caramel, charcoal, and grapefruit doing the Dance of the 7 Veils on my tongue. Silky smooth caressing mouthfeel.

Mouthfeel improved as it warmed...you know the alcohol is there and it's nice, especially on a cold snowy New England day. Definitely packs a puch..I can feel the warming effect already.

Nose of dark bottersweet chocolate, Kona coffee, and a touch of molasses. Mouthfeelis creamy and very full bodied. Taste is like the aroma, but with some rye bread and fruitcake. Long lasting head prevails over the omnipresent lacing. This is worldclass stuff, and deserving of its top 10 ranking. Certainly a benchmark among stouts.

113,782,rdrummer,4.4,"This is one fantastic stout. Being a stout lover, I thought that Guiness was the epitome of stout for a long time, but then I found out that there are a lot of stouts that are as good or better. This one is better.  It pours the usual very dark brown, really black color with a dark brown head that is very long lasting with fantastic lacing all the way down the glass. The aroma is one of smoked maltiness that is deeply smoky and superb. There is a hint of barley and a touch of spice, maybe a clovey aroma.  The taste is smoky beyond belief. The only taste that reached this level of smokiness in my memory was the rauchbier of Nuremberg. This was different because it was the roasted malt taste as opposed to the roasted barley taste of rauchbier.  It feels as good in the mouth as it tastes. It is thick in the mouth with no oiliness that you get from some cheaper stouts. This is the real deal. This is a beer that I will return when I want to have a stout. It is nectar.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,DagFishHead,4.8,"Appearance: Black ink pour, huge, creamy, dark tan head relents from three finger to two and stays for the duration. The thickest, creamiest lace I've ever seen. Smell: Regardless of your favorite beer style, I implore you to at least smell this... Deep dark chocolate, strong espresso, dark ripe fruits (raisins, dark cherries, prunes), toasty roasted malt, smoke... oooh, baby. Thank the maker, this is heaven! Taste: Big smoked malt sweetness immediately bolstered by dark fruits that linger with the carbonation, then the tide receeds to a semi-dry hop finish that allows the mellowed original flavors to mingle with a smooth alcohol warmth. Whoa... Mouthfeel: Slick, smooth, chewy smoked malt, but just slightly thinner than other examples (more English-style I would say). Drinkability: A stunning imperial stout. My personal preference for the slightly fuller American-style mouthfeel in no way detracts from how incredible this example is...",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Rumrunner,4.56,12oz. bottle.  Now this is a stout!  Color: Black. That is all. A nice light brown head to start gives a picture perfect looking pint. Lacing drapes the glass. The scents are heavy brownie and carob. Some sweet caramel. A dry dark fruit hop. The alcohol on the nose is rum. Flavors blend but are present enough to be selected. A real work of art for the nose.  The flavors work their magic. To start there is the brownie and light milk chocolate. Some singed coffee and heavy smoke. A floral and deep fruit entice the taste buds. There is a charred wood flavor at the end. So many flavors. They do well and keep themselves in check which provides a wonderful balance.  Mouthfeel is deep and heavy. There is a slight chalkiness which is just a bit unfriendly. A very full bodied stout. This is one I will return to. Just a well made old school stout.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,moulefrite,4.03,"Pours a nice heavy weight motor oil color with a large pillow like head and superior lace and stick. Sweet black licorice, malt and coffee on the nose. Same on the palate with a touch of Albert Coq soy sauce as well. Sweet and savory in the mouth. Velvet texture. Touch of dark chocolate on the finish.

113,782,bighops,3.95,"This one poured up with nice rich dark chocolaty color and had a thin caramel tinted head. Just looking at it, I couldn't wait for that first sip. The smell was pleasing; it had a good 'beer' smell - nice and hoppy - a smell that just invited me to take a taste. The flavor is bold but smooth at the same time. It had sort of a smoky and syrupy taste at the same time, which was a nice blend. The rich maltiness was consistent from start to finish and I was pleasantly surprised to discover that this beer didn't have that after bite that a lot of stronger beers I tried tend to have. Over all, it's a pleasant beer. I would almost call it a desert beer. The kind of drink you finish off a good meat n' potatoes kind of dinner with but it might be just a little too sweet for me to drink a lot of it. But I tend toward the more bitter tastes.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,AbePhroman,4.67,"Bought a bottle of this earlier, 550ml. I've had alot of this before and finally decided to write a review. Pours extremely dark into a glass with a dark tan head that doesn't dissipate. Smelled fruitier to me then most other imperials. This will sound silly but at first whiff I thought I may have accidentally purchased a bottle of red wine lol.  Very good taste. Not too bitter at all. Chocolate malt aftertaste makes this a very drinkable brew. A very sweet taste that makes me say, ""I should have bought 2 bottles!!""  All in all a great imperial stout. Glad it's always available.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,RockyTopHeel,4.58,"This is my first Imperial, and I can't help but be excited.  It poured with a thin, espresso-brown head and a very, very dark body, as close to black as anything I've seen. The aroma hints at alcohol-soaked dark fruits.  Upon first taste, it's apparent that this is an exceptional beer. It has a great complexity of flavor, with rich chocolate tones, rum-soaked raisins, espresso notes, and a strong caramel flavor that really shows itself as the brew warms. The high(er) ABV hides nicely amongst the multitude of flavors, though at only 7%, there isn't that much to hide.  Beautiful. Awesome. Wow. If all Imperials are this good, I'm hooked for life.  Spoils of the 10/11/03 Knoxville Raid.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,ngandhi,4.28,"Big malt and calm ester nose; light phenols and hops, too -- what you'd hope for in an imperial. Licorice and currants, maybe?  The taste is of true, roasted malt. There's a caramel and chocolate backbone well supported by barley, a creamy sweetness, and a black patent bite. The hops are late to arrive in this brew, but are there. The residual sweetness adds a good body to the beer and is augmented by an estery hop accent like chocolate fondue. The cocoa elements, typically overpowering in a beer, are mellowed by the other malts. I suspect that a lot of the ""black patent bite"" is actually the hop bittering as this is an imperial stout. The finish, too, is largely chocolate and coffee, but it's put in its place to the point where this tastes more like a classic stout rather than an imperia; also, light cognac. The trademark Sammy Smith diacetyl works wonders here.  I can see the chocolate-covered raisins others have mentioned and as I think about it, it comes out more and more above the gums. This has so much in it, that whatever you think of will probably be there. Buy a few and let your imagination run wild.  The harsh qualities of big beers are nicely assuaged in this brew, but then this isn't all that big either.  As it warms, the depth of flavor comes to a head. The malts harmonize like a symphony that has played together for decades. Samuel Smith Imperial Stout isn't as inventive as Bell's Expedition, but perhaps a benchmark for the style en masse. Tradition meets excellence.  Relax, relax. ng",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,yankeeheel,4.5,"Poured black from a 12 oz bottle. 2 finger tan head that has a lot of pop and fizz to it. Solid lacing.  Smells very sweet and fruity. Lots of fig, raisin, and molasses. Very creamy and malty tasting. You get the big dark malt without it being dry, harsh, or burnt. Goes down very smooth for a big beer. I get some chocolate and coffee in there too. Mouthfeel is very soild.  Incredibly drinkable beer for an Imperial Stout. Not just for manly men. A great choice for review #50.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,GeoffRizzo,5,"Pitch black pour, dark brown head; incredible retention and lacing until the last drop. Eager, highly anticipative aroma of burnt malts, plums, raisins, heavy notes of alcohol. Up front this bad boy is thick, yet smooth and creamy. Velvety slick, with a port feel to it; roasted malts, the alcohol is quite noticeable, yet it is in the background and does not offend. Character notes are many, to include nuts, raisins, port, burnt malts, coffee beans and chocolate; absolutely incredible flavoring and taste. Savoring, enjoyable, a warming brew, immensely drinkable, quite complex, worth a novel; clearly one of the best brews out there.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,woemad,4.35,"Bottle purchased at Huckleberry's in Spokane. Poured a dark brown with a big mocha colored head that hung around for a while. Notes of coffee, dark chocolate and dark fruit in the nose. Taste starts out like bitter dark chocolate, then a little bit of a fruity, cherry-like taste slips in, before ending on a tiny, crisp citrusy note. The mouthfeel of this is not too thin, not too thick, just about right. This is very drinkable for a stout lover such as myself. For others not so enamored of the style, this might be too heavy, too ""bitter tasting."" They know not what they spurn.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,AtLagerHeads,4.37,"A very fine stout that would surely satisfy most stout lovers. This is a good looking and smelling beer. The appearance is of deep darkness and a thin beige head. The residual layer gives nice lacing from the thin remainder.  The nose is roasted malt and very nice chocolate notes. The flavor comes on strong with great chocolate flavor, roasted malt goodness, and dark cherry notes. There is also a very subtle, but noticeable woodiness to this great stout. This is a very nicely balanced beer that finishes with very fine dryness.  The feel is very substantive and rich, smooth yet clean, with light carbonation and a clean finish. This is a truly drinkable stout that has limited drinkability only because of its fullness and ABV. Very nise stuff, to be sure.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Dantes,4.8,"Package: Appropriately regal, extra-tall 12oz. foil-topped, crowned, clear bottle. Label notches, but no date key or ABV. Old-fashioned white label with gold and black lettering.  Cost: $6.99 per 4-pack  Presentation: Imperial pint at ~50º  Appearance: Very dark brown with some ruby glow. Generated a moderate 1 to 2 finger head, that quickly resolved to a thick foam collar that gradually receded. Not the darkest stout, but plenty dark enough.  Smell: Very toasty, with some fortified-wine notes, coffee, chocolate, and dark blackberry and currant fruitiness on the nose. A generous, round, full aroma.  Taste: The flavors follow through on what the aroma promised, adding just the right amount of burnt-sugar sweetness, nuttiness, bitterness, and alcohol volatility to keep things from being bland or cloying. An homage to good water, skilled brewing, and the art of toasting malt. Very multi-dimensional, with the finish of Methuselah.  Mouthfeel: Excels. This powerful, flavorful beer defines finesse. Creamy, perfectly carbonated, with a full, rounded body. Coats the tongue, but remains dry enough to remind you you&#8217;re drinking beer!  Drinkability: Stouts don&#8217;t get more drinkable than this! Rich, satisfying, but not overwhelming. Delivers a surfeit of flavor without being hugely filling and lets one have two or three without repercussions. I should deduct 0.5 because I want a 20oz. serving!  Backwash: I haven&#8217;t had this in some time, and more&#8217;s the shame! A recent article in the Times led me to buy some and try it again. Boy, was I impressed. Not the darkest, not the hoppiest, not the highest ABV; but still the archetype of Imperial Stout. You can have all the Storm King you want, I&#8217;ll be happy with this! They haven&#8217;t forgotten that malt is at least as important as hops when it comes to stouts. And, what are you guys who mention the price talking about? It&#8217;s beautifully made and shipped over here, for less than what a lot of US microcraft brewers charge for inferior beers, and worth every cent! This beer clearly proves what Mies van de Rohe said, &#8220;Less is more.&#8221;",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Stopper,4.65,"This beer is black, but held to the light just right almost looks an extremely deep purple. It's initially topped with a thin head not unlike one you'd find on hot cocoa. The head recedes to a very thin layer of fine bubbles over the surface. This smells like chocolate -- and I do mean chocolate malts, but I also mean actual dark chocolate. This big malt aroma almost totally dominates a slight hint of hops. The initial taste brings a medium smooth body balanced slightly toward sweet maltiness, which is quickly joined by the roasted astringency of dark malt. This flavor is predominant into the finish, but as it fades a bit it reveals a very noticeable earthy hop flavor and bitterness. The hop flavor takes over for an instant, then steps back to join the dark grains. Then the wonderful flavor and bitterness of the hops and roasted malt ride off together into the sunset of my palate.  Samuel Smith makes some awesome beers. This is definitely no exception.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,byrd,4.57,"Samuel Smiths Imperial Stout pours a very dark brown (almost black) with a few garnet highlights around the edges of the glass. A thick tan head (slightly sticky) of small frothy bubbles with long staying power lies on top of this great brew. An amazing aroma is immediately noticeable from a good distance away. Chocolates, spices, dark fruits, and coffee are all evident... rich and somewhat sweet... begging to be partaken of. This brew is smooth at the start and somewhat sweet. Notes of chocolate and coffee are evident. Some spice notes are also apparent (coriander or anise  tough for me to tell  still a beginner at identifying specific spices). Towards the middle, roasted notes pick up, and theres a roasted bitterness in the finish that stays around until the next sip. Fairly full mouthfeel. Carbonation is pretty low and theres a somewhat draughty smoothness to this brew.  Its been a very long time since Ive had an Imperial Stout. Ill be sure not to let this happen again. This is a great brew that is SO easy to drink. Not really a session beer simply by its nature, however, I dont think it would be too difficult to finish off a few of these.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,WVbeergeek,4.33,"Appearance: Great same massive sized head as most Samuel Smith's brews out there, but this one has a deep brown amber black dark chocolate hue to it allows minimal light to pass through with a streak of prune hue purple deepness, lacing nice thickets of tan lacing clinging to my imperial pint. Aroma: Once again deep chocolate and coffee tones are present with fruit edges there fermented prunes or figs with chocolate sauce englazoned uone them how wonderful every dark roasted stout should smell this magnifcant. Minimal hopping in the aroma for the fruit and deep flavoful roasts mean to steal the show. Tase: Alcohol infused deep roasted malts with fruit remaninsce leaving their mark upon this heavenly dark ale, I really think this is one of the best imperial stouts on the market maybe not extreme or over the top but most flavorful and consistent the Sam Smith's reportoire get's the gold. Mouhfeel: A bit fuller than most Sammy Smith's this one packs quite the body keeping each sip not only flavorful but chewy.

113,782,Boilermaker88,3.25,"Much anticipated as this beer currently sits in the Top 10 of the BA best beers. Was getting even more excited as I watched this beer pour from the clear (uh, oh) bottle. A wonderful obsidian colored beer without any brown or ruby highlights flowed forth into my glass. A two-finger rich, creamy cappuccino colored head formed and grudgingly faded to a thin skim and left bands of lace. Okay, we had a problem with the smell. I could smell a moderate skunkiness coming off this beer from nearly a foot away. Damn clear bottle! I'm guessing it was light-struck somewhere along the way from the UK to SoCal. I could also detect some espresso coffee notes but the skunk really interfered with picking up anything else. Taste was better. Still, I wonder what went wrong as it seemed rather one-dimensional. Lots of chocolate malt, a lingering burnt coffee taste and a mildly bitter finish but missing the dark fruit flavors and caramel and toffee sweetness I've noted in other imperial stouts. Alcohol was very well camouflaged; virtually undetectable. Feel was medium-bodied and dry. Overall, I'm going to give Samuel Smith's the benefit of the doubt and chock this one up to a storage problem affecting this particular bottle, not a problem with the beer itself. I intend on getting this again (soon), hopefully on tap, and re-reviewing.

113,782,tavernjef,4.16,"There's a little deception with the bottle with the gold foil over the top so you're tricked into thinking you have a dark brown bottle, but as you pour it the bottle empties and it becomes a clear bottle. It pours out blubbing from its longer, thinner neck to a super thick dark brown used motor oil color, much like that of what it looks like in the bottle, a finger high head of cocoa brown, very dense whipped cream froth appears with a momentary rocky top then settles slowly down to a thin haze and the lace is in thick sticky sheets with some moth holes in it. Smell has a bunch of licorice and a touch of cherry with notes of sweet chocolate, dark toffee, and french silk pie, sweet tangy roastyness is there but modestly soft. Taste is a mild mellow mix of sweet chocolate, soft tangy roasted malts, and some fruit cake or breads, cherry mostly with some raisin and fig notions. Smooth and lasting medium body feel with some light coffeeish like drying and muffled, dulled fruity roasted tangyness in the finish which lingers for a shortened minute. Goes down easy with some carbonation that lends a somewhat flat soda pop. I just wonder if the light getting through the clear bottle is doing something to it? A solid well balanced Imperial Stout but not all that intriguing or complex really. The nose got a bit more lively as it warmed which was nice, as for the taste the warmth only brought out a flatter roastyness and lost the fruity notions that I did like at first.

Smells deep and malty, with a nice toasty backing. Tastes the same way. Definately one of the better stouts I've had. Wonderful almost creamy smoothness going down. Perhaps one of the weightier stouts I've had lately.  A superb stout. Also one of the most expensive in the store I bought it at. It proves that sometimes, you really do get what you pay for.

Some estery black cherry and currant, with a hint of chocolate and black coffee. Very much in the english style, mellow and subdued. Flavor is very bold, yet subtle, with huge sweetness and a big roasted flavor. Fairly easy drinking for an imperial stout. Hints of black cherry, coffee, chocolate, plum, and currant. Wonderfully rich, yet not overwhelming. Mild alcohol towards the ned, mingling with a soft hoppy bitterness. Slightly dry in the finish, with a lingering roasty bittersweetness. Body is a touch thinner than its american counterparts, but the subtleties more than make up for it. Smooth carbonation. Black liquid satin. Hearty and warming. I don't think my palate can handle too many of these, but it's very drinkable for an imperial stout. A great dessert beer. Easily one of my favorite imperial stouts.

Rich in malt sweetness and a creamy roast character with a phenomenal balance of hop bitterness and flavor. It is so refreshing and clean that i can easily drink large gulps of this and never have to worry about a bitter aftertaste. Medium bodied yet filling and definetly a bit alcoholic.

113,782,RoyalT,4.08,"Appearance  Absolutely gorgeous! The body is black as night. The volcanic head rises slowly, collapses slowly, and laces extensively.  Smell  Highly refined coffee aroma. Theres a special, highly-prized shaded Columbian bean that a coffee bar by my house serves occasionally, and this has the same scent. Theres also huge toffee (which I love), again, highly refined. We also have hints of chocolate, dark fruit (prunes, I think), sticky molasses, brown sugar, (slightly) burnt malt, and even some hops for balance.  Taste  Theres a lot going on in there. It has a bitter English balance that I cant quite finger, but basically youve got a wonderful mix of fine coffee, select toffee truffles, quality raw, and brown sugar. Theres also a whole array of fruits, mostly dark, let by prunes and maybe dates.  Mouthfeel  Little carbonation in accordance with the style. This one is a bit bigger than medium-bodied and very smooth.  Drinkability  This one is very well done. My preferences tend to be off the balance that they did here, but this is a good RIP nevertheless.  Update  This was one of the first reviews that I did after joining the site in the fall of 2003 but decided to re-rate this with an 04 vintage after it bombed in a blind RIP tasting that I did with some friends. It stood out as one of the worst examples of the style and most of us actually dumped it in the sink.  This RIP does well as a stand-alone, but other prominent examples were so much bigger and more flavorful that this seemed like a lightweight.

It is a surprisingly easy beer to drink, with complexities of mild yet rich maltiness with a perfect mix of subtle carbonation. The mouthfeel is like silk on the tongue, and it lingers there for a great duration before exiting with a desirable sweetness. It is simply outstanding.

Perfect milky smooth mouthfeel, I wanted to 'swish' it around in my mouth before drinking! A lot of flavor and very, very smooth. That Samuel Smith smoothness that I love only complimented the imperial style 'bite' that comes with some of the stronger imperials.

113,782,daledeee,4.67,"I admit I was skeptical. A clear bottle is usually trouble. But this time-no skunk. I trusted everybody else's ratings. This is one fine stout.  I did not chill this much. Probably 55F. Pours absolutely dark with a nice thin head. Pretty tan head about a quarter of an inch thick. More carbonated bite than I expected. Not very dry. Very intense roasted malt flavor. Chocolate and coffee also. Some hops make it through all that in the finish. Believe me there is a lot to taste here, but smooth is the word. Don't pass this up",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,jcalabre,3.2,"Originally sampled on 24 June 2002. I am writing this review from my notes. Opaque black w/ a frothy head that settles down quickly, this Imperial Stout has more of the 'coffee' taste than other I.S.'s I've tried. I didn't think that the overall taste was that strong. Also, the alcohol wasn't well hidden. A decent imperial stout, but I prefer others.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,SheepNutz,4.25,"12oz. clear (blah) bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a jet black color with 1 thick finger of light tan foam. There is a slight bit of lacing. The smell is sweet and nutty, full of burnt malt too. The taste is heavy roasted malt with coffee and caramel lingering in the background. There is just a little bit of hops on the back of the tongue for balance. The mouthfeel is thick and very smooth. The drinkability is pretty nice for 7%. The benchmark for all imperials!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,euskera,4.73,"To my thinking, this is the standard against which other Imperial Stouts should be rated. Nice sustained head with a lovely chocolate-brown color. Smell is of malt and chocolate, with a little coffee overtone. Taste is velvety smooth, starts with malt at the front, then the waves of chocolate, molasses, and roasted espresso kick in. Just superb!!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,GreatPondBrewer,4.33,"I now know why this is the quintessence of Imperial Stouts. It is finely balanced, sweet and bitter all at the same time. A real treat to drink.It poured jet black except the very bottem where there was a thin sliver of scarlet light. There was a thin, tan, rocky head pearched on top and the lace clung to the sides. Upon smelling my nose immediatly picked up huge, roasty malts and extreme smoked bitterness. The Imperial Stout slunk down my throat coating it with an abundance of flavors. The tip of my tongue was tickled by hop bitterness, which rolled into a heavy dose of sweet chocolate malts balanced with caramel. The taste was rounded out at the end with a chalky, dry aftertaste and a warming alcohol feeling in the back of my throat. The mouthfeel was not extremely heavy as I would have expected and had a tiny bubble carbonation, which delighted my tongue. One question though, why the clear bottle?",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,longpondbeerman,4.58,"Magnificent! This imperial stout is luscious and smooth and complex. It pours an unfathomable deep brown, but it is neither oily nor viscous. The dark tan head lofts it way upwards tantalizingly and then recedes deliberately into a fine buckskin blanket over the insides of the entire glass. The smell is slightly sweet, molasses and dark cherry balancing the mossy darkness of the stout. But the mouthfeel--it's like a down comforter on a cold, crisp night. And a taste to match--smoked toffee from start to finish with the subtle sweetness emerging from time to time as I savour every sip.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,quidquam,4.4,"Poured slightly chilled and perhaps a bit shaken after being in the back of the car on the drive back from Whole Foods, where the grocer mentioned he had heard this was a great Imperial Stout.  It pours out pitch dark, and has a very nice (and potent) taste. The smell didn't rouse me much, but the beer has a perfect mouthfeel.I was also impressed by the smooth aftertaste. It's much more drinkable than most other bears with this strong of a smokey flavor. I'm not a big fan of this type of beers, but won't hesitate to have another.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,DESTRO,4.35,"Pours a dark black with a nice sized tan head. Nice coffee/roasted malt smell. The taste is the shit. Light coffee flavours with a little chocolate, roasted malt, toffee and alcohol added in the mix. Also a bit metallic. Rich medium texture, not too heavy, creamy and just right. the drinkability is awesome since it isn't too strong to put you off flavour wise, and that it has a nice balance of alcohol, enough to warm you up but not so much you have troube finishing your 4 pack. delicious.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,kbub6f,4.23,"Bought locally (Grapevine refrigerated shelves), a couple of weeks in my fridge, reviewed 45F-70F.  A medium-small, noisy tan head dies fast giving up thin, uneven lacing. Dark ruby highlights show up on the edges of a black, black beer.  Sweet toffee and molasses dominate the bready, Brit-malt nose. Some grapes show up in the slightly sweet front. The middle is thick, thick, buttery and thick. Toffee sticks around throughout. The finish dries, but it's a little cloying and a little astringent. This is a very good, unique beer that's really a lot better at room temp, where it evens out and becomes the delicious treat it's meant to be.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,BierReise,4.14,I've had this before several years ago and haven't tried it again until now. Very impressive stout and a sweet surprise. Poured very dark almost black with short but tight tan head. Smell of roasted malt and usual english hop nose. Feels like velvet on my tongue and one of the smoothest stouts in recent memory. Taste is malty and rich with chocolate and roasted malt prevailing. Great to the finish.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,irishmoss,4.83,"Wow, what a great Imperial Stout. I mean this is what I've always imagined. Amazingly dark body with brown head. Sweet malty base is balanced with chocolate, coffee, and hopped up undertones. This is both sweet and crisp. The lower alcohol percent gives you a chance to drink the entire four-pack without same effects of a 10% Imperial Stout.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,clvand0,2.71,"This beer pours a very dark color with a dark medium head. The aroma is full of scents of alcohol as well as some chocolaty malts. The taste is of burned malts and licorice and the alcohol is not extremely well masked as well as very dry tasting. The dry and burned malt stick around in the aftertaste. This beer is fairly easy to drink for an imperial stout, but not being a fan of imperial stouts, I would not have more than one.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Loki,4.53,"This wonderful brew pours a deep, dark brown. So dark it is nearly black. The deep brown color is wonderfully complemented with a thick, fluffy, creamy, biege head that tasted nearly the entire beer. Aromas of malt, chocolate, and coffee waft from the nose. The nose leads the blessed drinker to tastes of coffee, chocolate, malt, and hints of caramel. There are also delicate hops to even out the flavor and leave a slight bitterness like that of a mild coffee.  My only two wishes with this beer were that my palatte and nose were more developed to detect more delights hinden inside this brown treasure chest and that I didn't have to drvie two hours each way to get this wonderful beer.  I have a new favorite brew and Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout be thy name!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Tballz420,4.75,"Re-review on the basis that my original analysis was horseshit.  This brew is completely black with some slight brown hues coming through when held to the light. Large, creamy brown head maintains its shape for quite some time. Thick sheets of lace line the glass. Roasted and sweet chocolate malt nose. Sweet chocolate malts dominate, some roasted characteristics, alcohol well hidden, virtually unnoticeable. Chewy soft mouth. Excellent stout.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,86MonteSS,4.7,"I'm not exactly sure who Samuel Smith was, but if he didn't achieve sainthood, I'm perplexed. This brewery can't go wrong, and Imperial Stout is certainly its flagship. This is everything imperial stouts aspire to be, and it's why I put all my faith in the English when it comes to beer.  This was the one that slapped me in the face and opened my eyes to all the others.  Bold yet balanced taste with a perfect lace, this is the quintessential stout. A bitter coffee taste lays the foundation while a gentle sweetness oversees.  While there are ""better crafted"" beers out there, nothing is better-rounded than Sam Smith's Imperial Stout.  Realizing the bottle was clear after perceiving it as amber ranks way up there in terms of the coolest moments of my life.  If I was an old man, I'd want Samuel Smith to marry my daughter.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,ecoboy,4.65,"So many subtleties. So little time.  Dark, almost oily pour gives a suprisingly long-lasting tiny-bubble head. Rich roasty aroma that belies the alcohol content. Surprising as well, the mouthfeel is not American ""big"" but refined. The tiny bubble quality does not overpower the mouth, but allows for sipping reminiscent of a sherry. Lingering prune aftertaste makes me stop questioning the Raison D'Etre that Dogfish brewed.  Does not in any way need food to complete the experience, but my initials: Would unquestionably dance a tango with sharp cheese or brie. Must be that oily sensation. I don't eat chocolate, but I can assume that German chocolate cake with dark cherries would also run with this.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,BeerResearcher,4.55,"This is the beer that got me writing beer notes about 8 years ago. This excellent Imperial Stout is ebony in color with a thick, foamy tan head that leaves behind a shroud of lace. The complex aroma gives pleasing smells of coffee, chocolate, hops and alcohol. The heavy and rich malt provides a luscious, velvety texture. Abundantly hopped with citrus, metallic and tea-like bitterness. Coffee and chocolate press forward as does some molasses sweetness. Noticeable alcohol, but not overdone. Wow!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,AudioGilz,4.9,"It's pitch ass black, defining the word opaque. A large two inch tan head forms and reduces to a thick coating which laces well. It presents itself like a perfect stout, and a perfect stout it is damn close to. The aroma is a strong concoction of roasted malts, vanilla, and chocolate. I get some dark fruits coming through as well, but vanilla stuck out the most. I love it! Super-smooth creaminess is the mouthfeel of this medium to full bodied brew. Strong flavors of burnt coffee and chocolate treat your palate, and then some hops come by for a quick stay in the finish. Warming alcohol is prevalent in the finish, a reminder of the strength of this brew. This is one heluva stout, simply put.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,dmarch,4.33,"My perspective of Russian imperial stouts must me skewed a little bit since I'm used to drinking Storm King Stout and Old Rasputin, but this was still a wonderful beer.

113,782,francisweizen,4.75,"This is an extremely well-made Imperial Stout. This beer pours a super-dark, black with a nice off-white/tan, frothy head. The aromas are of chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, and some hops in the background. The taste is all about the malts, chocolatty, caramelly, coffee-like, lucious!

Lots of aromas to this, picked up some coffee, chocolate some raison and a smoke or roasted aroma in there as well. Tastes of some coffee, chocolate, little bit of raison and some malt. Mouthfeel with smooth and creamy with not much bitterness to it. This is a good beer but my favorite Sam Smith is still Oatmeal Stout.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,nomad,4.48,"Poured a black juice with a light tan head that was very thick, wouldn't budge. Had a sweet thin coffee nose and beautiful malt that was roasted just enough - a soft and delicate but still strongly present smell. Beyond this base, it had a clean and clear nose, coming off as very fresh; other scents included a slight dry corn tone, fresh grass, and a tiny bit of fig.  It tasted a little more watery than most Imperial Stouts, but it helped make the beer quite refreshing. Hey, in the American market of ultra-hopped microbrews, a non-overbearing and cloying imperial stout is a nice thing! Sliding thin on the tongue, it had a very fruity bitterness in the front of mouth, but as bitterness rested it showed a little cream tone, too. Real good roasted malt flavor came through. A solid tasting all around.  While many American made Imperial Stouts are made by upping the hops or adding chocolate or doing whatever to make the beer as aggressive as possible, this beer is more straightforward and doesn't try too hard to be extreme or innovative. In other words solid in a good and classical feeling way. Leave it to Sammy Smith to show us how it can be done.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,nixhecks,4.21,"I was looking for a special drink with a kick for this wednesday evening and I think I found it. Presented in a 1pt. 2 oz. bottle, clear glass. Poured a jet black with a frothy tan head that stayed and stayed. Aroma was remiscent of dark fruit lik raisons or figs, and also included coffee, smoke, cocoa, and roasted malt. The mouthfeel was extremely smooth, going down just like silk and low in carbonation. It tasted very bittersweet, toffee and roasted malts as well as cocoa and a smokey-charcoal taste. Excellent choice. The overall character is very complex, and this plus the heavy body make this a great beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Scooter77,4.3,"This was the first Imperial Stout that Id ever sampled and its still my favorite one of the style. Pours a deep, deep black color with a creamy tan head, which seems to stick around for the duration. A thick, sticky beige lace is left on the glass. Nose is full of malt, caramel, chocolate, and alcohol. The taste will give you a swift sucker-punch in the mouth. There are so many flavors, all mixed together. Chocolate, coffee, malt, and malt all seem to blend together perfectly. This is a highly enjoyable imperial stout.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,canucklehead,4.8,"This sample came from Hawaii as the B.C. liquor stores decided not to stock this example of Samuel Smith , which is a shame because this beer ranks among the best of its type.  The colour is black as a moonless night and the nose is treacly and enticing. What really makes this beer excel is the rush of coffee flavours entwined with a beautifully balanced malt/hop combination. I had to sip slowly to appreciate what a complex and drinkable beer this becomes. This just might be my favourite stout with Rogue's Shakespeare Stout coming very close.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,marburg,4.63,"Ever have a great evening that peaks around midnight? A flurry of activity, a little alcohol, pitch black outside, etc? This beer is that night put neatly inside a bottle for your consumption.  The beer pours uber-black with a fluffy tan head that measures about a 1/4 inch in thickness. I often hold stouts to the light to catch the ""real"" color as the light shines through (eg, Guinness has that deep ruby red, etc), but this one was midnight, man. Just sheet darkness.  Lively, exciting aromas. Chocolate, prune juice, coffee...more or less a wacky latte. Tastes are comprised of much the same mix of fun, fabulous flavors. Chocolate, malt...leads into a light hop presence that tastes more like a smell -- if that makes any sense -- than a bitterness. A little roasted flavor lingers on the tongue afterwards. Nothing harsh, not too roasted or too strong.  Amazingly drinkable. There are certainly imperials that are higher in abv. But this one HAS to be rated high on its drinkability -- great taste and a slightly low alcohol content means you can drink all the more of it before you have to stop.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,feloniousmonk,4.1,"Color is black as black can be, and the head is proud, large and a creamy tan color. Aroma is warm and wonderfully delicious, soft, creamy, notes of chocolate, slightly roasty, and edging into darker flavors, but not quite there. Palate is deliriously sweet and inviting. Mouthfeel: sursprisingly smooth and untroubled, gentle, harmonious, thick with malt, mellow with hops. Very smooth drinking for an Imperial. I haven't had one of these in a long time, and have spoiled myself with the bolder, brasher, and far more adventurously flavored (roasted, malted, hopped, everywhichway) American versions, the Old Rasputins, Stormkings, Expeditions, Rogues, and Stones... But, I can't help liking it. Great stout, delicicious,delightful, but a bit weak, at a ""mere"" 7%, compared to similar brews from ""the colonies"". Quite tasty, but I'd love it if they'd ever stretch out some.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,jeffboo,3.49,"Twilight zone stout. A pretty shiny black color with a light brown top. Aroma was a subdued roasted malt with a hint of chocolate, much lighter than the Imperials I've been drinking. The flavor leaned toward chocolate and a little acidity,there was also a red wine flavor that seemed out of place (maybe a little oxidized?). It had a nice medium body that made it nice drinking and hid the alcohol well, but the finish was also shorter than others of the same ilk.Not overly impressed with this sample- I may have to revisit it soon.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Quaffer,3.68,"Appearance: The room dimmed noticeably when I poured this light-absorbing beer into my glass. It was jet black. A dark tan head rose up huge thanks to an aggressive pour (Grrrrrr!). I sat back and waited for the head to subside. And waited . . . and waited some more. I went downstairs and refinished my kitchen floor. Came back up to a heady beer. I went outside and gapped the spark plugs in the car. Came back in to a heady beer. This thing just wouldn't go away! Finally, after I had reorganized my bedroom closet by color, the head dwindled into a manageable, dense layer over the top of the beer. At this point, it started to leave a hint of lace on the glass.  Smell: This was definitly a unique smelling brew. It had a semi-sweet smell of raisins, plums, and light smoke.  Mouthfeel: A very smooth, medium- to full-bodied beer. It had an oily, viscous feeling to it.  Taste: The aroma transferred right over into the flavor of this beer. There were hints of raisins and plums combined with fruitcake. There was also a big maltiness, but I felt its chewiness more than I really tasted it. Towards the finish there was a light smokiness and a bitterness that I could only taste way back in my mouth, almost in my throat.  This was my first time with this beer. It was okay and had some very nice qualities, but the flavor just wasn't my thing.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,BeerBuilder,4.42,"Pours completely black with a light brown head with good lacing. The aroma is alcoholic, chocolatey, raisiny, and malty. The flavors are roasty malt and chocolate with hints of coffee. The mouthfeel is amazing on this brew. It is smooth, creamy, and silky, like their Oatmeal Stout. This is an excellent full-bodied brew; a definite favorite.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Bruiser81,3.01,"Poured a deep brown if not black with a two finger tan head that didn't stick around long. The nose was dominated by fruit, alcohol, and a little maltiness The taste was extremely sweet, almost like a sour sweet. It also had sort of an astringent taste but it wasn't good. The mouthfeel was medium, but I didn't like how it sat on the palate. I'm not sure what the word is maybe tannic? I was disappointed with this brew especially after all the good reviews. Maybe it was skunked. I've never had a skunked beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,NeroFiddled,4.65,"An opaque black body is capped by a foamy tan head that holds exceptionally well. It eventually drops, but maintains a creamy collar & thin surface covering throughout the glass. Some very nice Brussel's lace adds to the appearance. The aroma expresses dark fruit (currant, plum), dark chocolate, roastiness, and molasses. The medium/full body combines with a fine and moderate carbonation to give a smooth and creamy mouthfeel. The exceptionally rich, sweet malt expresses chocolate, toffee, roast, and coffee that's backed by a firm hop bitterness. It starts fruity (raisin, prune), developing sweetness and chocolate, but most of the flavors appear after the swallow when the tastebuds are no longer being overwhelmed. Fruit bursts forth followed by chocolate and rich caramel/molasses, then some floral hop flavor, and finally its roastiness appears - coffee-like and still somewhat chocolatey - with a borderline smokiness. The long and complex finish is what makes this beer... it's meant to be savored! It may at first seem more restrained than other examples of the style (and essentially it is), but a closer look reveals an immensely drinkable and exceptionally complex stout. Quite well done and well worth seeking out.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Bierman9,4.28,"It's been over a year since I've tried one of these.... This stout pours inky-black, with nary a glimmer of light able to penetrate. Head lasts quite well, being a stable 1/4"" thick, tan, finely-bubbled layer. Lacing coats the sides of the glass in fine fashion. Nose is an amalgam of malty sweetness, some chocolate, and dark fruit to boot, with probably an emphasis on the latter. It has a smooth, creamy feel on the tongue, yet I find it a bit thin for the style. That was the same fault I found with it in Dec '01, according to some old notes. Dark fruit flavors also meld with a smidge of bitter chocolate to form a rather tasty brew. Sweetness is the order of the day at kick-off, with some bitter character in mid-session, but by the last quarter a slightly fruity, dry character sets in. Though I don't feel it has the full, rich flavor of some Imperials, it is highly drinkable nonetheless. Cheers!  overall: 4.35 appearance: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | mouthfeel: 4 | drinkability: 4.5  478",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Mitchster,4.66,"Oily black brew with just a wisp of brown at the edges...forms a 1/4"" dark tan head which thins but always leaves an insulating layer. Carbonation is mild to moderate with small bubbles. Aroma is raisins, prunes, toffee, semisweet chocolate, and dark maple syrup. Despite the clear bottle, there are no noticeable off aromas...smells great. Mouthfeel is slick and chewy. Taste is initially black licorice, dark molasses, prunes, dates and figs, fading into a somewhat unpleasant metallic tinge, followed by wine-ish notes, ending in a long, pleasant caramelized sugar sweetness. Hops are restrained, letting the complexities of the malts shine through. An enjoyable brew...incredibly easy to drink for an imperial stout (easy to put 3-4 of these away in one sitting), and a good source of calories when shoveling the snow out of your driveway on a windy winter night.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,cbl2,4.87,"Perhaps my favorite beer of all time, Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout pours from the bottle almost pitch black with a nice quarter inch head that rapidly settles and laces the side of the glass.  The aromas that emanate from the chalice (I like to drink my stouts in chalices...) are malty and sweet, like molasses (with a little tar tossed in) and chocolate.  The flavors that fill your mouth upon tasting are heavenly: first sweet with the chocolate that was hinted in the aroma followed by coffee flavors, and a slightly bitter finish that lingers (if you don't immediately take another sip that is).  I would drink this everyday if it weren't so expensive. A must have if you've never tried it!!!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,scottum,4.53,"Mmmmmm stout!  Pours out very dark with a nice fluffy brown head. This is a nice beer. Dry and the taste blows one away. Me for one. Goes down smooth with no notable aftertaste.

113,782,UncleJimbo,3.86,"This stout is very dark brown (almost black, with there are hints of red if held to the light). It pours to give very little foam head. There is only a trace of an aroma (not unusual for a stout). The taste was full with the flavors of bitter chocolate and coffee coming through the dark malt. Not much hop character.

113,782,OldFrothingSlosh,4.33,"Presentataion: Clear 12 oz bottle with foil-topped cap. Many statements as to the nobility of this beer.  Appearance: Dark...opaque. Like a black hole. No light passes through this beer. ""Coffee with cream""-colored head that stubbornly refuses to leave any portion of the glass uncoated.  Aroma: Incredibly deep. Like smelling a chocolate bar and fresh-brewed coffee, this beer tantalizes the nose, revealing a hint of what the taste buds can expect.  Taste: Excellent. How does a beer taste this good? A complex assortment of flavors dance across the taste buds; roasted chocolate predominates. A very well-balanced beer that does its best to hide the alcohol content.  Mouthfeel: It wraps your taste buds in velvet. Creamy-smooth richness covers every square inch of your mouth.  Drinkability: How many can you buy? Not as assertive as the other stout I've tried (Victory Storm King), but I think that is a good thing.

Nearly black in color (one can catch a faint reddish tint if the light catches it right) with a a tan, no, light brown head. The head was rather small, but I believe that was due to my overly cautious pouring - used a smaller glass than normal. Roast malt in the nose. Taste was roasted malts, some chocolate, light hop spice. The alcohol is neatly disguised.

113,782,JohnnyDuvel,4.58,"I've been able to try several terrific Imperial stouts, and Samuel Smith remains one of my favorites. I believe that it is one of the best balanced beers of the style (that I have tried). Goes down quite easy for a thick-bodied, 7% alcohol beer. Not too hoppy or malty. Pours extremely dark, good- sized head, some remains throughout. Notes of chocolate (but not overly so), and not too dry (as are some of the other highly regarded imperials). Most times I've had this beer, I've enjoyed it completely, however it may be adversely affected by the clear bottle.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Gusler,4.6,"In my many beer conversations, many seem to think the quality of this brewery has slipped over the years, and that the clear bottles decreases its flavor. Well, of the hundreds of bottles of Samuel Smiths Beers Ive purchased, not one has been off; maybe Im just lucky.  The jet-black typical stout color is so pleasant a site sitting in its chalice, with the portly head perched atop the black beauty. Creamy in its texture, chocolate brown in color and as it evaporates, leaves a magnificent sheet of lace to smother the glass. The aromas of a truly great Imperial Stout are unmistakable, rich roasted grain, bittersweet chocolate, fresh roasted coffee beans, lightly sweet, and an absolute treat to the senses. Ambrosial malt start, the top thick and creamy rich the finish has a nice crisp acidic bite, hops purposeful in their spiciness. Aftertaste is chocolate malt dry, and quite long lasting, and in my opinion, still one of the best ""Stouts"" on the ""Beer market"" today, as it was yesterday and as it will be tomorrow. This is one brewery that still loves its beer and the drinkers who buy their products.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Exceptional if you can find it on tap as well.,Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,doho95fu,4.35,"Update..... I must have had a bad bottle because I retried this beer this weekend and it is a solid Imperial, no doubt. I have no idea why the previous beer was lacking in flavor, but this brew certainly has some great flavor, coffee roast, caramel, molasses, even some faint spice. Had to change the review to reflect a very solid brew.   OLD Review This beer just didn't do it for me, and the problem was the taste. It is deep brown, almost black with a thin tan head and low carbonation. The smell is malt with some caramel sweet tones. The taste is just average, nothing complex or interesting and even a little watery in my mind. This is my favorite style (so far) but this beer lacked the in your face flavor and complexities of other Imperials that I love (Rogue, Storm King). I do like the color and the mouthfeel was good, but as far as taste (the most important factor in my book) it just didn't pack it.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,inebrius,5,"A commanding nose of chocolate syrup liberally poured over baked berries, anisette wafer cookies and a spoon of vanilla ice cream. A predominate roastiness oversees a mélange of fantastical flavors that meld perfectly with a smooth, oaty mouthfeel. A masterful creation out of the old brewery. Like having your own personal flavor harem stroking your buds whilst you lay back in a state of exquisite wonderment. Drinkable? Please! How can you keep your lips off it? Elegant *and* accessible.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,cretemixer,4.45,"Nice pour. Looks like an Imperial should, Black as coal with a nice tan head that holds firm. Chocolate & alcohol dominate the nose. Nice roasted malts that are heavy on the chocolate with a slight coffee finish. Very drinkable. Lighter in body than I was expecting. A fine example of the Imperial Stout.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,kunzbrew,4.38,"WOW, pours an opaque black with a creamy tan head that sticks around for the duration, and leaves a sexy lace down the glass. The smell of whiskey fills the air after cracking the bottle and pouring into the glass. The coffee and caramel malts so very strong yet so very pleasant to the taste. This is a great beer and no wonder likes it.  Cheers",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,oelergud,4.73,"Very dark stout as an imperial stout should be, head is generous and tan with a hint of red in it. I really like how samuel smith serves the beer in a clear bottle so the color is readily discernible. Roasted coffee, liquer, chocolate and maybe licorice made up the nose of this beer for me and made me eager to taste it as well. Sweet coffee/chocolate taste, the smoky quality was apparent at first sip and gives the stout an edge on the competition when it comes to being remembered and stand out from the crowd. Nice mouthfeel, a little dry even though it leaves a thin coat on the tongue and roof of your mouth. All in all a very good beer if a little pricey.  Oelergud - Cheers!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,AaronRed,4.38,"What an exceptional brew. I am surprised that I have never tried it before- or maybe I did years ago but do not remember. Anyway, this beer is insanely delicious. Jet black with a nice tan head, this is possibly the smoothest of imperial stouts. Rich and malty with roasted chocolate and coffee like flavor, it also reminded me of port, with sort of plum flavors. This beer is so smooth, with a velt texture, it just goes down easily. Of course you want to savor and enjoy this masterpiece in front of a nice fire with good conversation.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,proc,4.67,"I can't believe I haven't reviewed this one yet. Pours out to a dark, yet not completely black color in the glass. Aroma is that of caramel and malt. The taste is where this beer really shines. Molasses, toffee, coffee, caramel and plums are present. The 7% ABV is hidden well with little alcohol presence. The swallow is very good and invites you to drink it again. Not as complex as Bell's Expedition, but a wonderful beer in its own right.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,StevieW,4.7,"12 oz clear bottle...yea yea.... Black as midnight in the middle of nowhere. Loud pour....glug glug glug, produces a creamy, pillow soft tan head. Bubbly, small drops of hop oil, dance on top. Great smell of roasted plums, raisans and other fruit. Molasses. Taste is silky smooth, roasted plums, subtle bitter chocolate malt. Quick hint of port wine. Bitter snap starts, then sweet slippery port finish. Great beer, and well worth the praise it receives.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,ZAP,4.5,"I went into this tasting thinking I was going to give it about a 4....I figured it couldn't be as good as it was rated...thought it might be overated...I was wrong...this is truly specialt....compared to Kalamazoo Expedition this is not as aggresive or intense...but it is by far more enjoyable....this is a great tasting, easy drinking Imperial Stout with class and character...  The appearance is coal black...I held it to the light and saw nothing coming through....the nose is very good but just short of the 5.0...brown sugar/dark rich bread/molassis on the nostrils....Veru creamy texture in the mouth...full bodied but not overthick...very drinkable....taste has a nice bite of dry hops on the finish...before that it is strong on the molassis/brown sugar/dark fruit....  This was a real treat to taste and I will be buying more soon...",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Mick,4.4,"It's not great because it is Samuel Smith's; Samuel Smith's is great because of products like this.  Ink black liquid overtakes the glass the way an octopus overtakes its prey's senses with a jettison of black liquid. Pours to create a great creamy head that laces all of the way to the bottom. A winter welcoming aroma of coffee and roasted malt. Flavorful, not demanding on the taste buds rather soothing. A noticeable, but complementing hop presence, attentive not astringent. Smooth light body and sleek finish earn this one a, ""best overall.""",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,IrishRedRock,4.23,"Quite the interesting stout. As expected, wonderful appearance: jet black with a creamy tan head. The smell at first smelled a bit stale, but as it warmed the true aroma came out: strong vanilla, cocoa, raisin.  Flavors run everywhere. Preceding the nice bitter hop aftertaste is a nice blend of dark fruits, coffee, and a serious roastiness.  Samuel Smith, kicking serious ass as always, and throwing me the constant reminder of why I love beer so much.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,HossMcGraw,4.83,"This is one of the best beers I've had. Pours pitch black and tastes like coffee, dark fruit, chocolate, roasted malt, and about a million other flavors that form a deliciously complex brew that goes down smooth as silk. This beer is soooo good and complex. Right now I'm having a bit of a crisis because I think I might like this better than the SS Oatmeal Stout. This one is definitely more complex, but I'd need an O-Stout here for comparison before I make such a big decision. I wanted to try this so bad that I paid 5 bucks for a single bottle. I know I got totally ripped off, but in Lancaster PA, my only alternative was driving to Philly or Maryland, or spending fifty bucks for a case. Had I known I'd like it this much, I might have gotten a case. Well, at least it was a kick-ass beer. Do yourself a favor and check it out.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,yen157,4.63,"Everyone knows what they are getting into when they try this one. I was very lucky in that this was one of the very first good beers that I ever tried.  Thick as hell tan head on a black body. Smells of dark fruit, maybe dark raisins, coffee, roasted grains, and dome alcohol. The first sip of a big, complex beer such as this is always a humbling experience because the beer assaults your sense of taste with so many flavors at once you struggle to pick them out before your tongue gets quickly acclimated. Despite being very full flavored, this beer tasted very clean. The flavors of dark grains, sweet malt, treacle, and warm, buttered toast were picked out before sensory overload occured. Some bitterness was percieved from hop as well as a tiny bit of charcoal bitterness from burnt grains. Other imperial stouts often have a much more pronounced burnt flavor whereas this one exhibited it as a more of a subtle treat .  Smooth, creamy mouthfeel made this a real pleasure to drink. After drinking this I was very unsure why I don't drink Sam Smith's Imperial Stout more often.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,ElGuapo,4.78,"another excellent selection from samuel smith. it poured nice and dark with brown foam leaving its mark all down the glass. aroma was nice and roasty with a little hint of chocolate.  it hits the tongue a little thinner than i had expected. i thought i was going to be loaded with dark malts coffee and chocolate, but it was a little bit light. very smooth and absolutely delicious.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,maxpower,4.85,"Pours black as night, nice creamy tan head.Smells of dark roasted malts and coffee, thick creamy full mouthfeel, sweet malty and awesome, the flavors and aroma get even better as it warms.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,BitteBier,4.45,"Pours very dark with only the faintest (still awfully dark) hints of color at the fringes. A substantial head of bronze/tan foam that lingers and creeps down the side of the glass as you drink. Sweet, even fruity, nose with lesser hints of chocolate, though more muted than I would like. Taste is a wonderful balance of smoothness and slightly hoppy bitterness with the typical roasted tastes coming through. Clean mouthfeel and good drinkability complete this great stout.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,aracauna,4.3,"Imperial Stout Blind Tasting (11-16-02): Not reall dark for style. Ruby flashes. Head is a little thin, but pretty average for style. The aroma is big alcohol, sweet chocolate and roasty malts. The flavor is less heavy on the alcohol and is more sweet chocolate. Nice roasty malt underneath, hay-like almost. Really nice fruitiness. The mouthfeel seems a bit thin for style. Really sweet.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,BeerBob,5,"Samuel Smiths Imperial Stout pours a perfect black from a 12oz clear glass bottle. Head is a pleasing brown with the consistency of yogurt and easily goes to over two fingers while covering the glass sides in a vale of foam as the liquid is consumed.  Nose is the most delightful assortment of dried fruits, and chocolates that I have ever found in a stout of any kind. Fig and sweet prune are in abundance in both the nose and the palate with a nice drying coffee like bitter for the finish.  Contractors to Her Majestys Forces can be found on the bottle label along with gold and sliver medals from the 18 and 19 hundreds.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,RonfromJersey,4.67,"Clear bottle with raised lettering. Pours with an enormous foamy, sculpted tan head, snap, crackle, and popping with bubbles. Drops down fairly quickly to half-inch cover. Body is black, with slight ruby highlights around the edges. Huge aroma of expresso hits at arms lenght from glass when pouring. Besides the coffee, nose is also loaded with liquorice/alcohol notes. Upon tasting, the effect is like liquid silk. So smooth I didn't taste the first sip, it just slide on by my tongue. Some dark fruits mix in with the coffee notes, and the slightest hop tingle. Alcohol is not noticeable on tongue as it was in smell. Great sensation of depth. A wonderful nightcap beer. Another gem from Samuel Smith.  And at $5.99 for a four pack, worth every cent.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,HopheadEd,4.25,"Nice Stout, very dark, deep aroma and taste.Pours black with a great tan head that holds well. Chocolate and coffee/toffee throughout. Nice carbonation, smooth tongue feel. Slight hop, great finish. Good drinking Stout, with a mellow finish that leaves you wanting more.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,BeerAngel,4.43,"Great brew! Pours a beautiful deep thick black with garnet high-lights with a medium tan head. Smells VERY nice with hints of roasted malts and chocolate.

Again, very good stuff! Cheers!",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,aaronh,4.73,"A virtually black beer with chestnut highlights around the rim of the glass. Pours with a dark tan head which quickly dissipates but leaves a small ring around the glass. The aroma is faint and difficult to place. The taste, however, is astounding. Sweetness, hops bitterness, chocolate, a little vanilla, fruit, and nuts all in a creamy mouthfeel. I keep envisioning chocolate covered cherries as I drink this beer. It also drinks very easy. This is truly a top notch beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,TheLongBeachBum,4.94,"I have never had this before, what a feast!!!!. The 12 fl.oz. bottle has a Royal looking Gold and White label, and so it should, for it proudly boasts Samuel Smiths as, Contractors to Her Majestys Forces. Bloody Hell - I want to Join the Army right now. It is totally black, solidly opaque, not even Neutrinos can get through this beer! A velvety brown head coats the beer with a thin head that laces the glass with an old fractel design from the 1700s. WOW!!. This beer does not have a sense of humor  it is one very Serious Stout. Smell is the very definition of Imperial Stout, through and through. Aromas and Tastes are inextricably linked to each other and are (in no specific order); Alcohol, Roast Malts, deeply burnished Mahogany, Roast Coffee Beans, Blackberries, Cocoa Beans, Liquorice from Pontefract, Bourneville Chocolate, Dark Rum, 5 year old Xmas Fruit Cake, Blueberries, Charcoal, distilled Cassis, dark Cherries (you know the ones I mean?), Brandy Chocolate Liqueurs, Dark Rum chasers.. need I go on?. Extremely well balanced, big start that fades with a lingeruing roast malt bitterness. Man this beer is seriously good. Sams have an uncanny knack of making highly drinkable beers, and this is no exception. A Simply Stunning Regal Stout that has a truly Nobel, Imperious, Majestic quality. A ""High Borne"" Aristocratic Sovereign amongst Stouts.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,putnam,4.97,"Dark but not opaque with Burgundy highlights and a wisp of foam on top. The aromas are of milk, blueberries, prunes and old-fashioned licorice with a dusting of cocoa and sweet spices. Velvety, peptol-bismol-like texture and even a little medicine-box nuance, like old bandages, kicking in. Delicious sweet milk, walnuts, vanilla bean and burnt sugar. No obtrusive hop herbalness at all. Brilliant, satisfying, and amazingly drinkable for an Imperial Stout. A beer with class and poise.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,mickeymac,4,"It's jet black with the tan head we've come to expect of Imperials. The head fades rather quickly, leaving a beer that is appropriately low in carbonation. The smell has notes of roasted malt and just a hint of sweetness. The flavor is also heavy on roasted malt, and I found it to be dryer than expected. It's pretty good but nothing spectacular. I've never gotten the fascination with Samuel Smith beers, and this one did little to change my mind.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,ADR,4.48,"Thick ""imperial pour"", brown head of 1/2 inch...no light transmission, absolutely black as night. Cherry aromas with a chocolate coating -- very similar to the box of candy. Dark and sharp flavor with a sense of some smokiness. Just lays in your mouth like a chocolatey cough syrup with a swell of deepness close to the swallow. The essence of this beer is a whopping presence and overall agreeability. Slightly less interesting than some other bigger Imperials, but a solid (and stolid) presence. If you like the profile, this brew is deceptively drinkable. One of the most delicious beers overall in existence.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,bditty187,4.47,"Samuel Smith Imperial Stout pours an absolute black. The head was mainly brown with red intertwined. The head was not as big as I thought it would be but there was lacing and good head retention nevertheless. The nose was liquorish, dark rum, dark fruit, and sugar. Very awesome! The taste complemented the aroma perfectly, kind of a chocolate, liquorish, alcohol, fruity, and candiness. Very drinkable! This is an outstanding beer, complex and flavorful.  Once again Samuel Smith has made a flawless beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,MJR,4.97,"I'm honestly puzzled how some can rate Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout higher than their Imperial Stout.  Pours pitch black with a dark tan head that doesn't want to stick around, but is easily aroused with a simple swirl of the glass.  The smell alone is enough to buckle this beer lovers knees. Roasted malt, raisons, burnt fruit, molasses, alcohol-covered fruit, you name it, it's in here. The flavor is stunningly complex, with more and more flavors showing up as the beer warms up. The mouthfeel is outstanding...nice and creamy, which I think is the main thing lacking from their Oatmeal Stout...it's a bit thin.  One of the great beers of the world.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,MaineBeerMan,5,"Whoa! How have I gone all this time drinking the Taddy Porter and Oatmeal Stout without ever trying the Imperial? This stuff is dark black in appearance although a bright light behind it revealed rich bugundy red. Beautiful inch thick light brown foam that left rings down the glass. Very fragrant with smell of malt, chocolate, molasses and a slight alcohol twinge. Rich, robust flavor that just doesn't quit. Roasted malt, dark chocolate, coffee, raisins and others are all present. Good hop presence helps to balance the sweetness. Nice sweet, full mouthfeel this is so rich, it's like a meal in a glass.The flavor is so full that I couldn't tell it was 7% alcohol.

113,782,mzwolinski,4.42,"With awards dating back to 1896 displayed on the bottle, it's a safe bet that Samuel Smith has done something right with their Imperial Stout. And it's easy to confirm this suspicion as soon as the bottle is opened.  Pours black as night with a really nice head. Dark tan, about a finger thick at start. It soon dissipates down to a thin creamy top which rides the beer the whole way down, leaving a substantial sticky lace on the side of the glass.  The aroma is really excellent. Fruity -- I detect cherries and fig -- with a malt undertone and a liquor like alcohol boquet.  Fruit is evident in the taste as well, here I pick up something more along the lines of raisin. Chocolatey notes become evident as the beer warms. The head lends a nice lightness to a texture which might otherwise be a bit overpowering. Assertive hop finish.  Indeed, the finish might be the only real downside of this beer. Something about the floral/fruity hop finish strikes me as a bit astringent. This mellows a bit with warmth, but it's still distracting and an unfortunate way to end such an enjoyable sip of beer!  Nevertheless, this is a good, medium-full bodied, generally very smooth imperial stout, and the fruit/chocolate combination in the flavor is really quite luxurious. A very fine beer.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Dogbrick,4.88,"Wow, just when I thought I had tried Samuel Smith's best beer, this beer comes into my life. At $2.25 a bottle I can't think of a better choice.

113,782,Bighuge,4.5,"This near opaque brew throws out a thin creamy brown head that retains nicely. This Imperial has a sweet toffee-like aroma mixed in with the usual roasted and burnt tones. The body of this beer is a little light for an Imperial Stout in my opinion (as is the a/v which is a mere 7%). The body is medium at best. However, this lends to a very easily drinkable Imperial Stout. There are no hints of alcohol in the taste. And the taste is very pleasant. Nice chocolate tones. Nice bittersweet tones. Nice subdued burnt malt flavor. And some bitterness to boot. Dark fruits surface halfway through and molasses seems to be mixing things up a bit too. A highly drinkable and flavorful Imperial Stout. Things could get messy if you lined up a few 4 packs of this for me.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

Taste is smooth and sublime, with notes of raisins, burnt malts and yeast fruitiness apparent. Silky-smooth on the palate despite it's 7% alcohol content. A refreshing change of pace for the style, as most Imp.stouts feature an upfront hoppiness...this one emphasizes the malts quite nicely.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93

It's the complex tastes that make me want to keep coming back to this beer. It has a coffee-like robustness and just a hint of sweet. Even the finish is complex and develops into roasty sweetness.

The dark tan head settles quickly into a thin but persistant layer. The aroma is outstanding, complex, and highly appetizing. Sweet, highly caramelized malt, vanilla notes, and sugary milk- chocolate hit the nose at first. They are followed by delectable smooth roasted unmalted barley coffee notes, mellow diacetyl butterscotch, and a hint of pruneish esters. The flavor is a superlative balance of roasted barley bitterness, perfectly calculated hop bitterness, chocolate malt, and malt deeply caramelized, anise laced sweetness from both the dark lovibond crystal malt and residual unfermented sugars. The body is dextrinous and full, but not overly rich. Finishes robustly bittersweet with lingering but pleasant diacetyl. I've forgotten how great this brew is.

The body of it is lighter than some imperials and the finish has some bitterness to itAs I probably have said before, I am a big fan of Samuel Smith, just suffer sticker shock from the price. When I was over in England and saw it in a local pub for the price of a local pint here, I jumped on it. That being said, I love stouts so my opinion may be biased.

Pours absolutely pitch black with a clinging tan head..lasts all the way down. Bombards the nose with a plethora of aromas....dark fruit (plums, raisins), dark chocolate, brandy..God only know what else. Huge. Taste follows suit. So many levels to this that I have to consciously focus on each one to make sure I get the most out of it. The dark fruit and dark chocolate show up right away with some roasted barley as well. The hopping of this Imperial really sets apart it my book. Puckering and fruity at the same time. Almost astringant at times. But not overpowering either. Try it and see. Finish is more roastedness with some pronounced nutty flavors as well....yum. Maybe just a little thinner than some others...something about the mouthfeel just wasn't perfect...the rest of the beer was. Very drinkable for the style. Believe the hype.

113,782,Thrasher,4.28,"I tasted this side by side with Sam Smith's Taddy Porter, and the two brews are very similar. I will comment on the differences. This is the denser, thicker, more lustrous of the two, and the more alcoholic which is definitely noticeable right off the bat. In fact, it dispenses with the fruity, creamy, sweet character of the milder Taddy Porter for a spicier, more solid, and ultimately more satisfying experience. Because of its strength, it stands up better to the brewery's trademark clear glass bottle. (Why, Sam, why?)

Medium to full body, slighty sweet, huge rich flavor of espresso, bitter chocolate, dark fruits (prunes, raisins, figs), and molasses. Great hops sharpness at first, then the sweetness comes though. Followed with the roasted flavor and malts to add to the complexity. A complex brew that is well balanced. A long lasting, outstanding aftertaste that reflects the complexity of this beer. A very warming beer. Enjoy. Cheers.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Jason,4.08,"Sample purchased from a store.  Top notch brew, some the best stuff on this planet. Worth the price ... a cold weather beer for me paired with a cigar.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Jordan,5,"Truly an exceptional beer. Smoked chocolate coffee notes, slighly bitter yet sweet. Creamy & rich. Pitch black like most stouts against a medium brown head. The head slowly dissipates down to about an 1/8 inch and stays there. Goes down like a glass of milk. Are you worthy?",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Brent,4.06,"Liquid dark bread. Dense with lots of roasted caramel flavor. Not as creamy as some but drink it with a fork. This is the gold standard for the traditional version of the Russian Imperial Stout - there are others I like better, but this is the measure.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
113,782,Todd,4.8,"Presentation: 335 ml custom clear bottle with a gold foil neck and old style label. Statements like, ""Contractors to Her Majesty's Forces"" and ""Awarded 1st prize and silver medal-bottled beer 1930"", ""1896 awarded gold medal"", and such, adorn the label. A very distinguished looking bottle. No freshness date.  Appearance: Opaque black, so don't even bother trying to find a hint of light through the glass. The head is a huge, majestic, light coffee coloured float of creamy foam -- with no intention of dissipation as it ever so slowly clinges on its retreat.  Smell: Sweet nose of fruity (prunes), milk sugars, molasses, brownies, coffee and rum-like alcohol.  Taste: Okay, where do I begin? I feel as if I am in the presence of the beergod itself. This is a rich, full to medium-bodied brew with a smooth, creamy, light mouthfeel. Roasted notes are in the forefront and pair with a lemony/limey-rind-like hop presence that takes the entire taste to a near astrigent level. You can pick up some floral-like flavours from the hops too. Malt flavours of coffee, plump raisins, prune/plum, bitter chocolate and faint smoke beckon to balance a foundation of bitterness, both roasted malt and hops. Nice rounded background sweetness. The finish on this stout contains notes of smoke and a roasted/sweet feel on the palate.  Notes: I've had quite a few Imperial Stouts in my day, each attempting to dethrown the other. In my opinion, Samuel Smith's might not be the most powerful in alcohol, or as assertive as others, but it is the king. All yield and recognize the truth.  Thanks to Merchant Du Vin for the fresh sample.",Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster),"England, United Kingdom",Russian Imperial Stout,93
