112,412,Reef,4.2,"12 oz bottle undated  Pours opaque ebony with two fingers tan variegated head. Full curtains lacing and cap. Looks like a stout should look. Aromas are chocolate, coffee, prune, gingerbread, cherry. Flavors are toasted cocoa, fig, coffee. Pleasantly bitter, great carbonation. Flavors develop as the glass warms. Little alcohol heat. Straightforward RIS with no flaws.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Specialmick,4.01,Look...Pretty dang black with a tan head and relatively medium carbonation. Smell...light roasty coffee and grass hop. Coffee and hops no smell of cocoa to me Taste...Sweet coffee and hops balancing each other or cancelling each other out. I noticed with a little bit of warming a somewhat thickening body flavor. Feel...A thin slickness reminiscent of a Black IPA. Limited body and representational of a Russian Imperial Stout. Reminds me of a strong Sammy Smith. A preety thilk silk of lacing Overall...A good and never too sweet Stout? I like that but for me but it was closer to a Black IPA by Uinta Brewing DUBHE I think or Victory Dirt Wolf but not quite as hoppy as that but definitely apparent. Leave the really sweet stuff on the shelf for me. Quite Good,North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,maltmaggot,3.21,"'Old Raspy', as I used to call it, has not changed much over the years. or has it? I can't remember. it seems even more thin, perhaps. There is some smell, like a fresh cut lawn. No way this can pass itself off as a stout to anyone with taste buds, unless maybe they need surgery in that department. Possibly a west coast ipa black monday? Well, good luck with that shit, lol.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Beer_aenima7,3.88,"L - Look is as dark as black coffee and too thick to see light through.  S - Smell is smoky and caramel forward.  T - Taste is earthy, to me sort of like chicory tea with notes of chocolate and smoke. More bitter than some Russian imperial stouts I've tried.  F - Feel is not at full bodied as it looks. Flat.  O - Overall it's decent as a Russian imperial stout. Not very complex.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,JimKochFan,4.77,One of those “ ultimate winter” beers IMO. Coffee nose and Approach on the taste. Some other reviews said expresso and I agree.

112,412,BeerGeekExtraordinaire,4,"I have been going back to style archetypes and ""classics"" lately. This is my latest adventure.  Poured into a snifter. Very dark.  Aroma was coffee/espresso. Very aromatic.  Taste is a mix of cocoa and coffee (more toward espresso).Roasty notes. Kind of a brown bread character. It's boozy but drinkable.  Excellent beer",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,TurboMon_911,4.46,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a standard pint glass, dark chocolate in color with a big thick uneven khaki hued head that just doesn't quit; loads of lacing and visible carbonation throughout. Nose is pretty standard for a stout with strong toffee, chicory & chocolate aromas prevalent with an earthy maltiness lurking underneath. Flavor is recognizable as a stout but is more reminiscent of a Black IPA, (which I love), because of the hop presence in the finish, which is more bitter than sweet. Mouth is full bodied with a slightly dry finish and nice tingle on the tongue from the carbonation. All in all this is a magnificently crafted,well balanced brew that I've enjoyed over the years as a treat. I was unable to finish this review without opening another as the 1st went down effortlessly.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,nizzle8287,5,"This beer just tastes better when there is snow on the ground outside. I had it first in the middle of the summer, and I would not have given it 5 out of 5 then, but today, there is snow on the ground outside, and this beer is in my snifter. Pours very dark brown, almost black, with slight brown aura in the dimple in the bottom of my snifter. Voluminous khaki head that sticks around for a while until it reduces to a thin film and patch that stays around for a long time, at least when it's about 60 degrees in my room right now. Beer, in general, acts differently at different temperatures, and this beer right here behaves spectacularly in cold temps. Smell and taste are about the same, with bread and cocoa nibs, with a slight coffee type of bitterness. The hops used are very well blended, which lets the malt-forward bill really shine. In a word, delicious. Dry. Full bodied with creamy texture; even the bubbles in the head give a sort of tan whipped-cream appearance. Alcohol is covered well, but at 9% it warms the core. Overall, an amazing brew, worthy of any stout-lover's interest.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,deluge71,4.51,"The color is unremarkable, as it looks like a typical stout. It also has that characteristic chocolate/coffee smell, so nothing new there. In terms of taste, however, this beer absolutely shines. Up front, it delivers a strong, bitter bite. But beyond that initial sensation, you get a dark, heavy beer that is both flavorful and quite drinkable. If you like stouts that are moderately strong, this is your new favorite.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,BitteNochEinWeissbier,3.96,"12 oz bottle Consumed on: 12 Dec, 2022 Glass: Snifter ABV: 9%   Look: Pitch black with a 3-finger high creamy light brown head. The head very slowly dissipates, eventually reach 1-finger high. The lacing is excellent.  Smell: Dark roasted malts and char. Notes of unsweetened chocolate and some faint coffee. Light licorice/anise. There is a fairly noticeable earthy and a spicy hop bitterness as well.  Taste: What is in the nose is here and dialed up a notch or 2. The coffee notes are more prominent in the taste. There is also a sweetness that reminds me of molasses (esp. blackstrap) and maybe a touch of dark brown sugar. As the sip progresses, the earthy and spicy hops take more of a front-and-center role. The sip finishes somewhat dry and quite fairly bitter and earthy with coffee notes.  Feel: Creamy and viscous. The body is a shade or 2 lighter than full.  Overall: A solid (Russian) Imperial Stout. A bit bitter for me, especially this early in the 'RIS Season' before my palette has adjusted, but this beer is very well done.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,thin_mint,4.47,"12oz bottle into a pint glass. Look: pours a dark, creamy black with a thick tan head that slowly dissipates to about half a finger for the remainder of the drink. Leaves nice lacing as it goes down. Fantastic. Smell: sweet dark fruit, roasty malt and coffee. Taste: just like it smells, sweet dark fruit with a roasty coffee finish. Feel: smooth and creamy with a nice bite. Delightful on the tongue and goes down easy. Overall: an incredibly well-balanced drink. The bitterness is tempered nicely with the sweetness, and it is exceptionally smooth. A prime example of the Russian Imperial style.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,crm871,4.39,"Look: Pours a deep obsidian black with a thin copper tone head. Classic look for the style.  Smell: Roasted malts and coffee, hints of chocolate and caramel.  Taste: I’m getting the roasted malts and chocolate, some coffee beans, and some dried fruit that wasn’t on the nose - could be plums or cranberries. Excellent complex flavor.  Feel: Heavy feel with 9% ABV, and for an imperial stout this is one of the lighter ABVs you can find. Superb as it warms so this one just gets better and better as you consume.  Overall: It’s a classic and widely available stout, absolutely recommend. Have had several times but just now getting to reviewing it. If you see this at your local store or watering hole, get it.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,JesseJames81,4.36,"Appearance: Pours a opaque, black satin-like color, with a thick tan foam head. Quite sticky and retentive.  Aroma: Dark chocolate and molasses, roasted malts and coffee.  Taste: Dark chocolate with some slight coffee notes up front, a bitter-sweet balance of molasses with a sharp hoppy bite in the middle. and then fades into a lingering bitter finish.  Overall: this isn't the first time I've had this stout, but I think I've developed a new level of appreciation for it. It's very well balanced and not at all lacking in complexity. It has a silky mouth fuel, and the fact that neither the better or the sweet is overbearing, makes it quite drinkable.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Hooded,4.1,"I let the bottle set out for 5 to 10 minutes before opening. 12oz bottle poured into a Teku glass. Appearance is black with 3 fingers of tan head. Retention is average leaving a cap. Smell is medium-low. The smell has a roasted aroma with a hint of chocolate and maybe a hint of coffee. I think I smell spicy hops but I will need to taste it to find out. Taste is medium-high in strength. The taste is dark roasted coffee, a little dark chocolate, a hint of caramel and a medium-high spicy bitter hop finish. I've been avoiding trying this one because I knew this beer had more of a hoppy flavor for this style. I was concerned it would be overly hoppy but they pulled it off by getting it to work with the other flavors. Feel is medium-high in thickness. It's creamy, velvety, carbonation is low and astringency is medium making it more dry which fits the style. Overall, it's a well crafted beer that's dangerously easy to drink considering the 9% ABV.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Whyteboar,4.33,"I’ve had this a number of times and it’s almost like each time is different. But tonight was one of the better times. Poured that dark black with an enthusiastic light brown head that dissipated very slowly and left nice lacing. The aroma was burnt coffee and baking cocoa and dates. Dates? Where did they come from? The taste deviated from the aroma as the coffee wasn’t burnt tasting but smooth and the cocoa seemed to mesh with the dates for an almost molasses flavor. It was really good! The feel was good, viscous enough for an imperial stout and thin enough to drink easily. If that makes sense. I almost always have these in the cellar, I should drink them more frequently.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

On the way home from disc golf league stopped at an cou country bumpkin gas station that has some decent beer there was a whole whole stack of this so apparently someone's drinking it I grabbed four cuz I really wanted a nice Stout a little worried it would be just too much but it's pleasant surprise not too high ABV for Russians not too sweet leaned a little hoppy cuz I think it's fresh somehow in this country bumpkin gas station store it wasn't old stuff good stout bordering on just a heavy Stout rather than a Russian this one's very well done and normally I'm afraid to go this high on the ABV but this is so heavy you don't notice it as badly there is a heavy cocoa bitter coffee hop that bounces back between those variables can't tell which one it is it keeps you guessing that's probably why it has a cult following,North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,UncleReemus78,5,"I am impressed with this beer in every aspect. As most stouts are, this one has all the characteristics of dark chocolate and roasted special grains with the hops sitting behind it all to mediate and balance the blend. Being that high ABV beers are tricky to brew, covering the alcohol flavor with success takes trial and error. Absolutely one of my top favorites in the stout realm along side Samuel Smiths Oatmeal Stout and Deschutes Obsidian Stout.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,Brumaster77,4.96,"Dark chocolate colored with good head. Smells of cocoa, chocolate, malt and strong stout.

Wow!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,TheGreatCthulhu,5,"COLOR:  Jet black, with a hefty mocha colored head that's about 2-3 fingers and lingers. This beer is as black as the inside of a coffin on a moonless night.  AROMA:  Smoked malt, molasses, figs, leather, cocoa, brown sugar, with a hint of hops.  Smells quite lovely.  BODY AND PALATE:  Tastes like it smells. Rich smoked malt that comes across as espresso and dark chocolate. A lot of the other notes show up, with a nice hops bitter note that doesn't overpower the rich bittersweetness of this stout.  In terms of mouthfeel, it's heavy mkay? Nice and creamy feeling, which is what I prefer in a stout or a porter.  FINISH:  This one coats the tongue and lingers. It develops oh so well, and lands on a curious whole wheat toast finish, which I guess I'm attributing to the malt, which is interesting and welcome. I love malty aftertastes.  CONCLUSION:  This is the gold standard of imperial stouts. It hits all of the notes, and ticks all of the boxes as to what I expect out of a nice stout. Every stout I try is compared to this, and most, unless they're milk stouts, fail to compare.  Black as sin? Check.  Rich as coffee in flavor? Check.  Thick and full bodied? Check.  Rich and complex without one note overpowering the other? Check.  Easy sipper? Oh HELL YES!!!!  Smacks you in the face with how strong it is? You betcha.  Only issue is the slight bloated feeling I get drinking imperial stouts. They're basically meals in a glass, so if you want a refreshing beer, might wanna look elsewhere. That said, this pairs really well with waffles, surprisingly.  Overall, for me, this is a 10/10 beer. It is my favorite beer of all time, and all stouts I compare to this, which I suppose now is an unfair comparison.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

T: Follows nose. It definitely helps to open it up a bit and let it warm. Reminds me of fall without the spices.  F: a little oily but not much. Coats the tongue a little and has mild carbonation. Not perfect, but rewarding.  O: I can’t wait to revisit this once the weather starts cooling off. A quality benchmark stout to measure all stouts against. Not my favorite stout, but definitely a classic.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Lingering notes of unsweetened cocoa and coffee. Semi-sweet chocolate notes emerge in the middle as the beer continues to air and warm  Mouthfeel: full at the front, giving way to a syrupy smooth feel in the mouth. Good effervescence on the tongue, preventing it from becoming overwhelmingly heavy.  Overall: hot damn, this is a tantalizing beer. On look and smell alone, it gets near perfect marks. Taste was a tad bit too bitter for my palate, but it still had diverse elements to the bitterness that made it enjoyable.

And this beer isn't ""wrong,"" it's just basic and underwhelming. In short, it takes like a Sam Adams with a touch of dark.  L: Very dark. Opaque black. It's a good start to a stout in that sense, but the pour looked thin to me. Not something I'm used to when serving an imperial stout. The head was a couple inches in height that took 5 minutes to start dissipating, and I can hear it fizzing out with a film of bubbles lining the glass where it once stood.  S: ""Generic beer"". I was hoping for a malty, smoky smell to align with the flavor profiles others described. I held out hope that the taste would contradict my initial experience, but...  T&F: I did a doubletake on the bottle to confirm that I had bought a stout. At this point, I was sure I must've misread the bottle when I purchased it or grabbed the wrong case off of the shelf. It's thin and lacks any unique flavor. It tastes like a dark beer. No ""smoke"" as others describe and no malty thickness I've grown accustomed to in a good, imperial stout. As previously stated, it tastes like any Sam Adams that you could grab.  O: Basic. Unremarkable. Ordinary. Not offensive, but certainly not worth seeking out or even purchasing again.

Well, she knocked it out of the park. The beer is one of the best dark high alcohol content beers I have had in my life and that is saying something being from Portland, Oregon.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,BeerAndGasMasks,4.29,"From the older bottle, it pours a very dark brown color with a light brown head that reduces to a quarter inch and sticks around. Lacing. The scent is burnt/roasted malts with a touch of chocolate and spices. The taste is roasted malts, chocolate and dark fruit. Aftertaste is amazingly pleasant.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,HoppingMadMonk,4.25,"Solid black appearance. Medium light carbonation with a just above average body. Slightly creamy feel which all adds up to a nice body. Aroma is malt, roasted malt, dark cocoa, sweet anise candy. Mild char, smoke, and black coffee. The taste is very mildly sweet with some bitter char,smoke,dark bakers chocolate. Leaves an almost dry chalky dark cocoa aftertaste. Overall its first class for good reason",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,PathofChaos,4.24,"Appearance: Intensely dark, russet brown with a light-tan head so voluptuously foamy it ought to consider a modeling career. Retention is strong. The lace begins as a solid, sandy wall that, oh-so-slowly, slips down to become a delicate, dotted weave.  Bouquet: Like slipping into a wetsuit woven from toasted malts, then heedlessly cannonballing into a pool of black coffee and fudgy, dark chocolate. The first breath drawn upon resurfacing brings with it the aroma of a distant, walnut woodsmoke.  Feel: A heavy, stone-smooth bridge over a murmuring brook of carbonation.  Taste: A landslide of dark malts rushes you down a slope of heavily charred hops; in the end, flinging you back into that fudgy pool of brazenly black coffee. The aftertaste is infused with the same, deeply nutty wood-smoke found in the bouquet.  Overall: Enjoy with a chocolate chip cookie and experience exponential wood-smoke flavor.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,Alexparker505,4.26,"Tried in bottle and stout cup.  Trying this beer in whatever form, it is clear that it has a powerful flavor and taste. The dark chocolate coffee flavor with a hint of caramel and creamy overall feel makes it stand out from other stouts I’ve had.  I really appreciate it’s versatility for being able to be enjoyed while hot or cold which comes in handy although I would consider it more of a winter beer. Very small to no carbonation with a hidden alcohol flavor which can make it dangerous.  One of my favorite stouts so far",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,reknirdsuomynona,3.94,"Pint can poured into a pint mug  A - Not quite pitch black. Very dark brown in color. Three fingers worth of solid head on a slow pour that settles to a few millimeters that stick around. Some nice lacing is present.  S - Rich, toasted caramel and brown sugar notes are dominant. Hop aroma is absent and the scent of alcohol is unfortunately noticeable which is honestly kind of disappointing and surprising for such dark beer even at this gravity.  T - That's more like it. A punch of strong earthy flavors. The rich earthy hops are first on the tongue. Midway through the malts kick in and rounds out the experience with a spicy and sweet profile that feels more like a holiday beer than a stout. Charred coffee notes seem to appear and grow stronger as the beer warms. No alcohol flavor to be found. There is an unfortunate metallic aftertaste present though. It's the same one I get after using my well water in a batch. It's a shame, everything else here is solid.  M - Somewhat light in body for such a strong and dark beer. It's not light but it's definitely medium bodied. Expected more heft here. A pint would be more than doable with a big meal.  Solid stout at a decent price. Definitely feels like more of a holiday beer though. No idea if there was something wrong with this can but the metal flavor makes me suspect something is amiss with the water quality. Either way, it was still enjoyable.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Bold roasted flavor. Little if any sweetness. I get brown bread and prune in addition to the dark roasted coffee and chocolate. Great depth of flavor with a nice bitterness. Full bodied and smooth. Booze is well hidden. A little alcohol burn on the exhale. This is the standard for RIS in my opinion. Widely available and a great value.

Smell and Taste: Chocolatey-malty caramel with some coffee thrown in . . . or maybe Malty coffee-chocolate with some caramel thrown in . . . or what ever. Low end sweetness with a slightly bitter aftertaste as if you just finished off a mouth full of special dark chocolate.

Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip. 2 finger head that looked like it would dissipate, but held up well; lacing for mine was also quite good. Look: Typical espresso, but not as thick as others in the style (dittto for feel - excellent, not syrupy), Smell: I want to say chocolate, but it's not, more like dark roasted malt. Taste: Clearly a west coast interpretation of the style, but in this case, the hops are forefront without being intimidating. Zero sweetness. Your eyes are telling you to taste chocolate but it wasn't there for me.  What struck me first, and most, was the malt/hops transition. For my palate, most beers are ""there's the malt, ahh, and then here comes the hops"" ... can be a little binary. In this beer, the malt/hop transition was tight, almost one continuous flavor. I can see why this has a cult following. I tried this because of a recent BA thread comparing Old Rasputin vs. Breakfast Stout.

Poured thickly. S - Very malty smell. Coffee, toffee, and chocolate notes are prominent. Slight hazelnut. T - Roasted nuts, espresso, caramel, chocolate, and stone fruit hit you right away. Burnt oats, followed by a mellow yeastiness. Bitter notes are present for sure, but not overwhelming. F - Full-bodied. Thick. Chewy. Low carbonation, but in the way you can tell it's heavy. O - One of my favorites. A definite contender for ""best winter beer ever"". I would say it's a dessert beer if it wasn't as bitter as it is. Serve this with a very good-quality steak and asparagus.

Look is black with nice brown asymmetrical head. Head leaves no lacing. The smell on this is very very nice. Roasted malt and coffee notes from the malt. The taste is the best part of this beer. The alcohol is completely hidden which makes this dangerous to drink. Very easy to go through 4 packs of this. The taste is this beautiful roasted/caramel malt with some chocolate notes on the back. This beer is balanced very well. Not too bitter, not too sweet, perfect drinking and I'm in awe. The mouthfeel of this beer is the upper standard among imperial stouts. Low-medium carbonation that starts to fade after half an hour or so in the glass. Full bodied and great mouthfeel. It feels nice and heavy especially for a 9%.  Overall, this beer is definitely a must try. It is not the most complex but I think that is a big reason for so many people to say this is their favourite beer ever, including myself now. There are no added flavours of things like maple, licorice, etc. This is super drinkable, affordable, actually quite complex without any adjunct flavouring, and not dependent on the occasion or food pairing.

112,412,SierraNevallagash,4.19,"Long overdue review.  12oz bottle - coded date - poured into a flared ale glass at 44°F.  Pours a used motor oil brown, sitting coal-black in the glass with zero light penetration. Two fingers of creamy, soft tan head cascades upwards, and lingers for quite some time, leaving a fair bit of lacing as it recedes.  Nose: Moderate, but fairly typical roasty RIS base leans somewhat on the drier side. Rather than nutty, sweet caramel notes, this is much more dark chocolate, vanilla, leather, flamed grains, a touch of pale crystal malt, and an almost rye whiskey spice note. There's some complexity here. A very unique note that truly, genuinely smells like ambergris. There's also some fantastic hop character here, which just screams old-school C hops. Tangerine and pine, right out of SNPA.  Palate: The beer is bold and unabashed, greeting the palate with a big smack of dark roasted malt, and with it, some char, ash, toffee, caramel, vanilla, treacle, and burned sugar. Still, the pale crystal malt note shows. This is followed by the same fruity sort of West Coast IPA hop character, with notes of tangerine, pine sap, green grass, and a hint of red tea. It's this hoppy tea note that gave off the ambergris aroma. The hops linger for a moment, until the sweeter malt notes fade, and a big, full-on dark roasty bitterness swells and crashes over the palate with a slightly charry, blackened malt flavour. This leads into the finish, defining it, with just a hint of the hoppy notes remaining.  Mouthfeel/Body: The beer is medium to medium-full in body - lacking any sort of chewy viscosity, but making up for it in bold malt weight. Very little stickiness, very little sweetness, and ultimately finishes rather dry. Effervescence is just lively enough to cut through the weight, and give some nice lift. Cherry drying finish, just short of acrid.  Overall: Old Rasputin is a pretty classic West Coast Russian imperial stout. It's a pretty classic Russian imperial stout period, but I do like how North Coast injected some old school West Coast spirit into it, and gave it the classic C-hop spin. It's just a classic, for those who aren't afraid of a proper big roasty ale. I do personally prefer Sierra Nevada Narwhal, but this is still great.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,BillAfromSoCal,4.19,"bought as asingle bottle off a room temp shelf at Total Wine then stored in the fridge for a couple weeks. No indication of bottling date found. Pours with a lite brown 3 finger head in a somewhat bastardized tulip glass. Pours black, as expected, but with strong back light it has an almost dark-dark mahogany look. Persistent head, lots of lacing. Smell and flavor scream ""straight-up, classic stout without coffee, chocolate, or other flavors added"". Creamy mouthfeel, not as much bitterness as I expected from a Russian Imperial. Overall, very nice but I am partial to those that achieve more coffee and/or chocolate flavors. However it did pair nicely with a nice aged bourbon. Updated notes: A later bottle (Apr 2021) pours less black and more dark brown than I remembered from the original. Also, much more bitter than I remember originally. Not my favorite Imperial Russian stout, but very good quality/cost ratio",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,THE_VANDAL,4.53,"First review here.  Bought as part of a pick-6...had no idea I was grabbing such a highly-lauded brew.  Side-poured into a chilled glass mug. Head was deceptive...even after a slow roll out of the bottle, the head kept on growing, eventually with a waterfall over the rim. Coffee and lightly-overcooked crusty bread greeted the nose as if I was in a bakery that also served site-roasted coffee. Big dark grains and coffee continued on the tongue, with a light tartness coming in after the swallow. Exceptionally dry and robust on the exhale, with a lingering warmth.

Limited sweetness, but booziness is controlled.  Mouthfeel: Thick and creamy, with decent carbonation.  Overall: Despite its reputation, I'm actually underwhelmed.

112,412,JohnniEMc,4.07,"Looks great poured, the color and head expected in a stout. The taste has a burnt malt rather than roasted malt flavor. Alcohol can be detected and with a 9% ABV, no loss of points there. There are other Imperial Stouts that manage to deliver the same octane, but with a much smoother feel. I'll have another but I won't seek it out. Second review from a tap pour: It still looks great. Some of the burnt malt aspect has mitigated, but not enough to change the rating. It drinks even more lightly across the palate. There's not a significant reason to change any of the numbers. This one is over-rated by many.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Ernald_Elbertson,4.37,"Drank from standard pint style glass  Look: Obviously very dark, but actually not completely opaque. Bleeds a little light when tilted, which is somewhat odd for the style. Light lacing. Khaki foam.  Smell: First note is the roasted malt. Half sweet, half roasty. Slight hint of booziness, coffee, and dark chocolate. Perhaps even a little fruity; almost like dark chocolate with a raspberry filling. Smells like the perfect example of this style.  Taste: First taste is roasted malt and coffee. Brings it into a slightly boozy middle, and a bitter yet satisfying dark chocolate finish. The IBUs lend well to the chocolate flavor here. Flavor stays with you for a while. The flavor is perhaps simple for experience stout drinkers; but sometimes simple is good. This flavor perfectly exemplifies the enjoyable aspects of an Imperial Russian: like a Guiness on steroids. Definitely more of the english/irish style base stout than an American style stout. This beer would pair fantastically with chocolate, baked goods, or charred/blackened meats.  Feel: Pretty chewy and thick. Like drinking milk, but perhaps a little light for the style. It has the chewiness, but just not as much as I would expect. Still delightful, and lends to a more drinkable and approachable Imperial Stout.  Overall: This beer is excellent. Imperial Stouts are some of the most fantastic styles of beer (American or Russian). Unfortunately they tend to be difficult to get into, as they often have extreme ABV, and many are barrel aged, giving them an even boozier flavor. Old Rasputin is a great introduction to the style, as it encapsulates the idea of an Imperial Russian Stout perfectly, but does not intimidate the drinker like other Imperials do. On the other hand, experienced Imperial Stout drinkers will find it somewhat refreshing to have such a standard drinkable Stout in the face of all the Maple Syrup, Ginger, Granola, Peanut Butter, etc flavorings and 13%+ ABVs that seem to be so popular these days.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

I've heard a lot about this one  Pours a deep dark brown with 2 fingers of mocha colored head, slowly fades and leaves tons of lacing  Huge aromas of bitter roast, licorice, mild vanilla and coffee  Mmmmm, taste is really similar but some hops get to shine through too. Some dark sweet fruits in the beginning before the roast and hops come in to create a nice bittersweet finish  Definitely full bodied and dancing the line between roasty and creamy, this drinks super easy for the abv with mild carbonation  Overall I really enjoyed this one. Went well with a fruit and nut dark chocolate bar to bring out some of those notes, will pick it up again",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

He immediately fell for this straightforward, powerful, complex brew that is a flawless example of the style. At the time, I knew nearly nothing about beer being only 18 but I over the years have gained the knowledge to appreciate it for what it is. Poured into a pint glass.  Look: Deep, pure black body that absorbs all light like Vanta Black. Its deep black core is absolutely impenetrable by all light. A dark, milk chocolate-colored head rests permanently atop the brew, lingering all the way down to the bottom of the glass.  Smell: Deep coffee and chocolate, smoky char, charcoal, dark fruits, and caramelized fig. The overall roasty toasty qualities on the nose are enticing and unique.  Taste/Feel: The taste follows the nose with mounds of dark fruits, hefty waves of smoky and bitter dark chocolate, light tar, tobacco, dates, candied plums, earthy hops, and slick bitterness. A tasty acrid flavor stands out that makes this a perfect pairing for smoky barbecue and smoked baked beans. The thick, smooth, heavy body does justice to the powerful flavor characteristics.  Overall: Dangerously easy-drinking brew, superbly executed with so much explosive malty goodness and smoky charm.

Taste: Follows the nose, big hit of roast malt and coffee/dark chocolate at the start. A bit of smooth sweetness on the tail end. Feel: Medium-thick bodied, smooth and creamy.

112,412,jrc1093,4.21,"No bottling date present  Pours deep pitch black body with copper brown highlights and topped with two fingers of tight, almost creamy light mocha head, head retention is nearly beyond reproach, fading ever so steadily to a paper-thin cap strewn with clumpy islands, a moderate creamy cap, and a stringy spatter of bubbly lacing.  Aroma features big notes of heavily roasted malt soaked in jammy plums upfront, followed by astringent, smoky coffee grounds, a dark fruit medley, and a touch of alcohol; smooth milk chocolate takes a firm hold of the background as the beer warms.  Taste profile interchanges between plummy sweetness, malty char, and dark chocolate, with an toasted pumpernickel bread and astringent, spent coffee grounds back end/exhale.  Mouthfeel features a body just a touching the heavier side of medium, with moderate carbonation and persistent mild astringency coursing across the palate; dry and roasty throughout, but especially present leading to a finish teeming with boozy depth.  So blunt and embracing of its intensities it becomes an unabashed hallmark and an authentic highlighting of what defines the Russian imperial stout against its American counterpart; a standard-bearer and perpetually enjoyable take on the style for an unflinching malt profile and deceptively approachable body; as one who greatly prefers American imperial stouts, I have great respect for this beer.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

The only other brew I can say that about so far is the Abt 12. (In my opinion, the best Belgian. If you like that style, there is no equal.)  I'm also impressed by the smoothness considering that it's 9% ABV. You'd never know it by the taste. It's full-bodied, without being too thick. There's the perfect level of creaminess that compliments the (predominately) dark chocolate, mocha, coffee flavors. This is one that you can still taste long after your last sip.

Sometimes that is not possible, but the beer is still pretty good in it's bottled state. Unlike most imperial stouts I've tried Old Rasputin is NOT nauseatingly sweet.

Taste - Still getting that blueberry flavor, like chocolate covered blueberries. Lots of charred malt, to the point of being burnt but i still enjoy it. Some chewy hops in the finish. Fairly sweet and smooth. Carbonation is medium-low. Body medium-high but the alcohol is well hidden, it would be very easy to drink a few of these.

112,412,Lingenbrau,4.71,"I've been drinking Old Rasputin for a long, long time now. I think I'm finally ready to review him.  When it comes to appearances, Old Raspy is second to none. Obsidian black, reflective, clean, and gorgeous. The brightest light in the world won't be seen through the other side. Chestnut highlights can be seen, but only down the barrel of the glass as sips are indulged upon. And resting above, a memory foam pillow of tan, frothy, silky, root beer float like suds. After what seems like an eternity, it starts to settle leaving a layer frosted above the surface and a blanket of lacing on every square inch it touches.  Next, that unmistakable aroma. Charred toast and spent roasted grain. Ashes left over from last nights embers. A hint of salinity reminiscent of black olives. Mineral water heavy with alkalinity. Earth, with all its raw dirt and herbal goodness saturates the nostrils.  And then, what we have all been waiting for. The burst of flavors that come from what seems like a harmless aroma is overwhelming at first. The amount of roast is unequalled. Once the shudder down my spine and the goosebumps have faded, another sip is in order. The charred toast is slathered in molasses then brûléed giving off a note of burnt chocolate. The mineral water quality comes next, like it was freshly drawn from the river and boiled in a copper kettle. Airborne particles from freshly swept dusty floors get in there blending with a hint of vanilla and nuts making for a one of a kind sweet and earthy finish. It tastes old. As in ""Old World"".  Old Rasputin has a well made slough of textures. Smooth yet not creamy with a barrel like stripping dryness on the end, but without the barrel. The quick initial molasses sweetness is quickly overcome by roasted and bitter bakers chocolate. The alcohol is almost completely undetected, dangerously so. He ends with a lip smacking glue and a musty bitter bite.  Old Rasputin has stood against the test of time. Rightfully so as this beer has it all. Classic flavors, quality craftsmanship, incomparable availability, steal of a pricetag, reputation both impressive and frightening. An icon that would please any Czar, and one that has and will continue to frequent my fridge. Breweries and their stouts come and go, but He won't die.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,nicholas2121,4.25,"Old Rasputin brewed by North Coast Brewing Co. ,with an ABV of 9.00% This Russian Imperial Stout pours out of a 12oz glass bottle into a pint beer an deep brown color with an a nice light brown head. This brew has the look of black coffee, not saying that is a bad thing. There is also a nice amount of lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell is rich with roasted goodness. You pick up on a lot of roasted grains and malts. Then a nice mix of hop bitterness at the end to tie it all together. So far Old Rasputin is a nice inviting brew. Now for the taste, it is Bold an Rich with flavors. You first pick on all the roasted goodness. Lots of nice smooth roasted malts and grains. The body of Old Rasputin is a medium to heavy. Not to heavy but definitely a lot heavier than other Stouts on the market. It is hard to pick up on the 9.00% ABV in this brew, it goes down just that smooth. This brew would go nice with dinner or on a cold winter day. The mouth feel is Rich, Bold, Roasted, Clean, Smooth, and Refreshing. Overall I am going to give Old Rasputin a 4.25 out of 5. I would definitely look this brew up again giving the opportunity to.

It’s a really good stout, but you probably already knew that.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,defunksta,4.34,"Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass at 45 degrees,  Appearance: A completely black pour with a good amount of carbonation and head. (4.00)  Aromas: A strong bittersweet chocolate and roasted coffee and root beer aroma predominate, I would describe similar to a cold brew coffee, but slightly more roasted and sweet. There are some sweet bread aromas that come forward at the end. (4.25)  Flavor: Flavor mostly of semi-sweet chocolate, but roasted barley malts giving it a bitter coffee flavor and root beer is here too. There is a breaded, caramel and toffee malt presence underneath. A dried citrus flavor may be present underneath all of the darker flavors. The hop bitterness is strong with comparatively mild chocolate and citrus sweetness. A subtle coffee background comes forward. The alcohol is pronounced and stands out at 9%. The bitterness seems to perfectly balance the sweetness so that this captures a strong dark-chocolate flavor, but is complemented nicely by the bitter hops. The balance here is perfect. (4.50)  Feel: A good amount of carbonation and heavy, oily body due to the ABV allowing it to go down particularly smooth for the strong bitterness. An oily bittersweet-chocolate flavor lingers on the tongue, however an astringent hop bitterness lingers at the same time. Again, so well balanced between bitter and sweet. (4.25)  Compared side by side the the Yeti by Great Divide: This one has more of a bitter and less sweet chocolate flavor. More breaded and less roasted. Slightly stronger hop bitterness. There might actually be some citrus fruit underneath. More balanced overall between sweetness, bitterness, and body. Lighter body, more carbonation, and less syrup & oil. With the balance, hides the alcohol much better. Finishes soo smooth, which deceptively hides the alcohol and makes it very drinkable.  Compared to Sierra Nevada's Narwhal 2019 on 1/16/22: Pours a similar color with a slightly lighter head. More earthy black malt, root beer, and molasses notes. Less chocolate and earthy espresso roast. Cleaner and slightly lighter.  Compared to Stone Imperial Stout 3/2023: Pours a similar color, lighter head. More bittersweet cocoa, English black malt, cream. Less dark chocolate and bitter pine. Dryer and cleaner.  Overall - This seems like a strong representation of an imperial stout at an affordable price. The bittersweet chocolate flavor in the hops is pronounced, but just enough chocolate malt to hide the ABV relatively well without incorporating any unnecessary sweetness. The balance of sweetness, body, and hop biterness is perfected such that the alcohol is hidden and this drinks so deceptively smooth. When I want a Russian imperial stout on a cold winter's night, this is the one I grab. A delicious imperial stout that is appropriately sweet, and appropriately balanced with hop bitterness.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Very chocolately and roasty - big malts that give it a robust flavor with very present but very well balanced bitterness.

Chocolate, raisin, coffee aromas dominate for me initially. A rich, sweet roasty aroma.  Quite malty sweet up front, with some of the chocolate and dark fruit noted in the aroma. Roast and bitterness is present early, but stays somewhat muted compared to some imperial stouts. Finishes with the roast taking over, but the malt sweetness never completely ceases. A delicious stout without being overpoweringly stouty.  Full body and moderate carbonation. No astringency, and a mellow warming. Might prefer a lower carbonation level.

Not overly bitter. Tremendous balance of the flavors lead to a very pleasant drinking experience. Very easy to take repeated sips in short order.

I hope this is not a bad thing. the bourbon barrel aged version smells better. I also agree with this one particular beer reviewer stating that Old Rasputin tastes similar to a dark chocolate covered black cherry. Moreover, Old Rasputin has one of the best label design artwork that I have noticed. I did not notice a date on the bottle I had thought that North Coast Brewing Co. did put dates on their products, oh well a non adjunct RIS should not go bad too soon so, I won't take off points for that this time around. I am detecting some hop presence, but it's nothing inadmissible. This is a great laid back west coast style approach to a RIS style. I appreciate the adjuncts like coffee or chocolate, but sometimes I want to drink 2 or 3 bottles of a RIS that is not going to make me feel edgy & irritated. I can see why this is considered a benchmark in the earlier American craft beer days, with this beer sort of having a style of its own. I agree this is an overstated RIS, matter of fact this taste more like a black IPA. I'm very disappointed with the Old Rasputin. North Coast needs to work on revising this recipe big time.

112,412,DoghouseReilly3946,4.46,"North Coast Old Rasputin RIS - 9% ABV - 75 IBUs Date: 06/21/18, enjoyed on 09/03/18. Appearance: Black, not used motor oil black but a standard stout color with two fingers of mocha colored head. There is some slight ruby red color seeping in around the edges. Aroma: Big roasted malt aromas, slight char, and bitter dark chocolate, all with a coffee undercurrent. It actually smells a little sweet, like rich cacao powder. Taste: As with the nose, the boldest flavor are these big malty notes followed by a slightly sweet and that dark chocolate taste. There is a beautiful ashy quality to the malts that really works wonderfully. The finish on Old Rasputin is quite bitter, letting those IBUs really shine through. It has a medium full mouthfeel with an almost velvet texture, but it does feel lighter than say Bell's Expedition Stout. Tons of dark roast coffee and bittersweet chocolate notes come out as the beer reaches room temperature. Biased comments: Wow, this is still one impressive beer and certainly is one of my favorite stouts. After the explosion in popularity of adjunct filled beers and pastry stouts, it is very refreshing to return to a beer that is the antithesis of all that. Also, North Coast must be one of the most underrated breweries on the planet. All of their beers that I’ve had are quality beers, and that isn’t something I can say for very many breweries.

Nose is chocolate, alcohol, very faint coffee, and slight toffee. Taste follows the smell and alcohol is pretty strong making this beer seem stronger than it is (is this 9% or 12%?). Slight burn in the aftertaste which gives way to faint hints of chocolate and an even fainter taste of fruit. Mouthfeel is surprisingly not sticky.

It’ll leave you disappointed...with 90% of every other stout you drink. Pours dark and void of any light. Smells like deep, dark coffee and chocolate. If it sounds like I’m in love with this beer, then your reading it correctly. Albeit it’s darker then Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction, it drinks remarkably smooth and refreshing!

112,412,cardfan212,4.25,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a glass.  Look - Pitch black body with a thick dense tan head. Possibly my favorite looking beer ever.  Smell - Strong roasted malt tones with some really dark chocolate, think like 90% cacao chocolate.  Taste - The smell translates to the taste. However, there's also hints of coffee and a mild hop finish to round it all out.  Feel - Thick body with medium carbonation. Heavy and refreshing to drink.  Overall - This was one of the first beers I ever drank. Had it at a hot 4th of July party, and absolutely hated it. Coming back to it now, and I love it.

S: deep, sweet, complex aromatic roast. Surprisingly jammy, fruity, herbal, hoppy. A lot like Narwhal in that respect - perhaps more so for the perceived berry-like aspect here.  T: wow. Intense hoppy, toasty, sweet maltiness. Characterized by a tart, berry-like sweet hoppiness and a lingering roasty bitterness.  M: full-bodied, slick, with virtually no carbonation.

When inhaled deeply can smell the alchohol, but there is actually an overpowering fruity citrus to the scent which I find very surprising. a slight bit of roastyness there, and a good amount of fresh smelling hops bitterness. Smells more of a black IPA than a stout.  Tastes like a black IPA as well, which I love! A huge a roasty caramel flavour on the start, with slight malt flavour finishing in intense hoppy, dry bitterness. Tastes way better than it looks in my opinion! I would go ahead and call it a black double IPA personally! Really find it tastes and feels more like a roasty IPA than a stout! Very bitter and floral hops tastes for a stout.

My first impression is that it tastes almost like a barrel aged stout. After enjoying some fresh Narwhal (which I truly enjoy) I have to say that this is a step above and worth paying a little more for. It is very well balanced and really shines for me on the finish. The front end is as it should be and the back end has a great combination of a slight sweetness mixed with a very enjoyable booziness.

The taste is so satisfying. Roast is much more prevalent and softened by sweet malts and dextrins. Many subtleties from unsweetened cacao, to chicory and on to dates/raisins. Some floral notes too. Definite hop presence and roast balance out the sweetness and allow this beer a beautiful balance.  Mouthfeel is full, but not overwhelming.  Overall this beer is a standard for a reason.

112,412,ChrisCage,4.72,"A- Pours with a very thick consistency, like motor oil and is super brown/black in color.....completely opaque as well! The head is super creamy, has excellent retention, eventually settling down to a thick layer over the brew (starts out about one finger thick), and is very dense like a meringue top. Obviously the carbonation is much too tough to see and there is a super sticky and thick lacing that sticks to the side of the glass. Very nice looking overall!  S- Loads of deep dark chocolate, black coffee, creamy almond like liqueur, burnt black/chocolate malts, hints of licorice, rye bread and yeast, along with slight rummy vanilla/caramel sweetness near the finish. It doesn't have the traditional Imperial Russian stout booziness as its well hidden in the aroma overall!  T- This is quite a nice Imperial! The booziness hits the palate immediately and then quickly settles down, only after hitting the top of the palate with hopped bitterness! Again, there is a great deal of cocoa powder, french press black coffee astringency, 90%+ chocolate, creamy yeast, burnt brown sugars, licorice Earthiness, blackstrap molassess, perhaps of nuttiness, charred vanilla creme, and a hopped bitterness that lingers on the palate long after the taste.  M/O- Rich and full bodied, with smooth velvety carbonation! The problem, and this really isn't a problem, is how easy drinking this is and I'd be afraid of enjoying one too many before it creeps up on me.....right in the Rasputin! The booze is superbly well hidden throughout once your palate accustoms to the initial taste. Love the heavy coffee/chocolate/cocoa character and most definitely recommend this one to any Stout lovers!

Crude black in color with very thick silky dark brown head, the head withstands with good retention before slowly subsiding to an eternal foamy crown that won’t die down and leaving lots of lacing patch and spot.  Very rich chocolate that tends to be dark rather than milky along with cocoa nibs, black coffee with slight sourness, and roasted take the lead. Then I get fudge, dark bread, cocoa powder, burnt caramel, sweet dark fruits, mint, and licorice. Lightly charred nut too and a little bit smoked but not in kind of meaty also with some significant touch of leafty and grassy hop.  It is heavily roasted through the palate sensation together with notes of dark chocolate, cocoa nibs, cocoa powder, black coffee with slight sourness, fudge, dark bread, burnt caramel, sweet dark fruits, mint, licorice, charred nut, slightly smoked, all mostly from malt. Hop is there so upright with its leafty, herbal, and persistent grassy bitterness that comes from both hop and roasted malt.  Rather full body with smooth and just slight viscous mouthfeel but somehow a bit watery, the carbonation is low while the feeling is well-rounded and good to carry the complexity and intensity of all the characters. Finish is very dry and pleasant.  Great RIS and perfect example to the style, it is rich, deep, and complex. Apart from its typical deep yet intense roasted, coffee, and chocolate, you will also get so bold hop characters of grass, herbal, and big bitter kick.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Frudel,3.42,"Big bottle from LCBO. Dark opaque beer with a beige head.  Nose is roasted malt, caramel, dark chocolate, dark coffee.

112,412,Eddieeight,4.75,"Looks dirty and dark. Is it liquid soil? Smells like licorice and dark fruits maybe some cherry. Taste explodes in bitterness and burned malt. Just the faintest touch of sweet, from the darkest of chocolates. It was like I chewed on some ground coffee. Alcohol notably present in the long lingering aftertaste.

The head has a creamy feel on the tongue, and the body is pleasantly smooth and milky. This is likely one of the best-feeling beers I've ever had. That said, I couldn't get around to liking the taste, which is chocolaty but also somewhat sour and stale. It smells strongly of chocolate as well, though a little flatter than most beers of its kind that I've tried. This has the formula to be a favorite beer of mine, but it ended up disappointing me.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,Rufus1,4.49,"Pours medium into a fifteen ounce mug the same temperature as the beer. Appears nearly jet black and opaque with a one and a half finger creamy tan head. Some ruby highlights. Nice sticky lacing.  Smells of roasted coffee, bakers chocolate and dark roasted malts. Touch of alcohol. Ripe dark fruits. Hints of tobacco barn and smoke.  Taste follows the nose with a balanced blend of sweetish chocolate, expresso coffee and roasted malts. Deep luscious dark fruit like plum, raisins and dates. The bitter is in there but almost completely lost in the in the mix. Silky on the palate with perfect carbonation. Sweet up front then boozy with a good hop finish added to the dark roasted malts. Silky on the palate with perfect carbonation.  Overall this has to be one of the top imperial stouts. I enjoyed it immensely.

Poured dark black with a persistent foam that took several seconds to lift into a thick sticky head that remained on top of the beer and on the sides of the glass as I drank the beer down. Smells thick of rich malt and lightly of malt. Taste is slightly bitter and sweet with a delicious mix of coffee flavor and hops playing well together. The feel is rich and smooth on the tongue. Body is fairly heavy, but not overwhelmingly so. This beer has a near completely perfect mix of everything from the smell, taste, and body which makes for a fantastic beer that thoroughly pleases.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,Fourlives,1.9,"I was completely excited seeing this stocked here in the East Coast and decided to give it a try.  Please, PLEASE if the brewers are reading this, you need to dial the hops back at least 50% from where they are now. There is nothing more disappointing than having a great midnight beach hang with the pooper, place the snifter out, pour what looks to be a fantastic beer with great head & lacing, only to smell hops right off the bat.  Then the taste, come on man. Please. Someone please stop with the hops already. An Imperial Stout should be bready, malty, with some dark cherry, plums, raisins maybe, with subtle licorice and coffee overtones, but never, EVER hoppy!

112,412,Lt_Col_Kilgore,2.43,"I read several of the reviews on this beer. Ive had other imperial stouts and was excited to try this one. I couldn't be more disappointed. The feel and look are fine for an Imperial Ale, but my overall score is based on the taste, which is the most important factor. It's way over-hopped so it drowns out any subtle flavors from the malts. Stouts, in my opinion should be malty to balanced, with the bitterness coming from the roasting of the malts rather than an over abundance of hops. It's as if they're trying to turn it into the dark version of an IPA, an IDA? IPAs are fine if that's what you go for, but when I drink stout ale I want to enjoy balanced malty goodness, not Christmas tree flavored brew. This is just a terrible ale. Brewers shouldn't feel they need to add a ridiculous amount of hops just because the alcohol content is high. This ale would probably be pretty tasty if they dialed the hops back a bit. I didn't give it a 1 because I would reserve that for Coors and Budweiser.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,thehyperduck,4.35,"Bomber purchased at the LCBO; bottled Oct 28 2016 and served slightly chilled. Not the first time I've enjoyed this stout, though it is the first time I've had a chance to review it.  Pours black as night, with roughly one inch of frothy, tan-coloured foam seated atop. Ungodly retention; the head gives up virtually no ground for more than 15 minutes, though it does take on a smoother, creamier, lumpier appearance - as its big, soapy bubbles burst, gradually being replaced from below by tiny, finer gauge bubbles. Beautiful lacing, too; this is a visually-stunning brew. The aroma reveals this to be a rather well-hopped stout, with big leafy, earthy hop notes coming through almost as clearly as the rich, roasted malts themselves. Black coffee, molasses, dark chocolate and cocoa figure in strongly, with accents of licorice, dates, raisin, alcohol and smoke supplying added depth of character to the nose.  A genuine treat to sip. Big roasted malt flavours dominate the profile right off the bat - espresso coffee and baker's chocolate blend together with a mix of caramelized sugar and molasses sweetness. Hints of date, prune and vanilla also come through by the midpoint, with the sip rounded out by herbal licorice, earthy pine resin and leafy hop bitterness on the back end. Finishes bitter, with coffee grounds and earthy hop flavours fading as you approach the dry-ish aftertaste. Medium-full in body, with restrained carbonation that gently prickles the palate and provides a slight bite; the overall texture is quite smooth, luscious and creamy. Pleasurable and fulfilling to sip.  Final Grade: 4.35, an A grade. Old Rasputin is exactly what an imperial Russian stout should be - rich, smooth, balanced, and intense. When I first tried this imperial stout a few years back, I definitely liked it, but not to the extent where I considered it one of the best - however, this follow-up sampling has converted me into a true believer. The exquisite balance achieved between the roasted malts and sturdy hop notes is nothing less than a thing of beauty. There may very well be better stouts out there, but that doesn't diminish what North Coast has managed to accomplish. One of the grand-daddies of them all; if you haven't tried Old Rasputin, do yourself a favour and take whatever steps are necessary to correct that.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Sloth_jr,4.74,"It's a heavy handed beer that knocks you out with a strong nose of raspberry and molasses, approaching a wine bouquet. Rich head, dark purple virtually opaque color.

112,412,woodychandler,4.4,"I am baffled as to how it has taken me until now to review this beer. I wish that it were as easy as blaming it on The Bottle Backlog here at Chez Woody, but this was a fairly fresh bottle that I recently scored simply to drink & review. I am scratching my head in response.  From the bottle: ""Brewed in the tradition of the 18th century English brewers who supplied the Russian court of Catherine the Great.""; ""Old Rasputin develops a cult following wherever it goes. It's a rich, intense brew with big, complex flavors & a warming finish.""  Still shaking my head, I Pop!ped the cap & began a slow, gentle pour. Once sufficiently decanted, a vigorous in-glass swirl raised three-plus fingers of dense, foamy, rocky, deep-brown head with good retention. Color was Black/Opaque (SRM = 44), allowing deep brown highlights to be visible only at the edges. Nose was smoky, with notes of coffee and especially dark chocolate brownies. To be even more precise, this smelled like liquefied chocolate brownies! Wow. No wonder this is so popular. I was impressed & I hadn't even taken my first sip of this review! Mouthfeel was big, thick & creamy, a dollop on my tongue. I just let it lie there & roll around. The dark, rich chocolaty taste was like a liquefied dessert, whether brownies, chocolate mousse, chocolate ice cream, ad chocofinitum. Wow! Finish was semi-sweet since the chocolate also had a bitter edge to it. It was just a bit much for me and left me craving something that was hop-driven. An RIS just is not my bag.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,akolb,4.46,"Look: Jet black with 2"" caramel head Aroma: roasted barley, acrid, chocolate. A bit subdued.

112,412,PlinyMeNow,4.4,"Poured from 12 oz bottle. Opaque jet black: I held the glass directly up to the sun and couldn't detect a glimmer through it! Head is a nice smooth frothy brown and sticks around. Aroma is an intoxicating mix of roasted coffee and bittersweet cocoa with burnt caramel and some booze. Taste is all of the above in a fairly dry package with a bit of booziness high in the back of the palate and some bitter hops lower in the back and in the finish, without much linger. Great balance. Feel is not quite as creamy as I would like for the style, but still medium to full bodied, with moderate not-too-low carbonation which I do like. It seems to get better every time I drink it. Why does a Russian or American imperial stout have to have 14% or higher alcohol to crack the BA250? I don't get it.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,HotDogBikeRide,4.5,"Old Rapustin has been a long sought after beer for me, jokingly using the ""Rasputin"" name in regular conversation referencing beer purchases with my girlfriend.  This beer is black with a light light tan head (quite big) with micro bubbles in tan spraying all over as lacing.  The smell is of roasted malts, maybe some roasted chocolate, and also a bit of oats. This smell brings home the taste, a mash of roasted malts and many darker flavors while maintaining a minor hop bitterness that does not linger. Goes down easy and maintains a surprisingly light mouth feel.  I really enjoy this beer but I don't think it is something I haven't had before. It feels reallly good, by the time you are finishing number 2 (I drink fast). I think it deserves a good rating but it isn't absolutely blowing my mind. That being said it is really good, that can't be denied. I will likely buy again sometime, but it's no immediate concern. It did cost over $10 for a 4 pack.

Taste is toasted malts with some bitter from hops and a slight alcohol warming in the back of the mouth.  The mouth is the lighter side of medium with a bit of a lingering bitter finish.

The taste is just great. One of the best imperial stouts I have tried.

I don't like stouts, unless they offer something extra (Dragon's Milk, Peche Mortel), so any rating from me on a straight forward stout is unfair. But I still try everything I can, and of course I had to try this one. Not bad, a little more tolerable than most, but I still don't get why all of dark chocolate's goodness disappears in beer. I like dark chocolate a lot. In fact, that is the only chocolate I like. But in beer, it becomes obtrusive and bitter in a bad way (unlike the bitter goodness of a double IPA). The rest is obligatory: beautiful thick head with some retention and gentle lacing, bitter (blah! to me) nose and a taste that will leave stout lovers satisfied, although it may be surprisingly watery to some.

Nutty, lightly-roasted malts, chocolate and a little coffee stand out in the aroma. These continue to the taste where they mix with a stronger, more charred-malt flavor, some pretty strong hop bitterness, a slight vegetal flavor and a kiss of alcohol on the backend.  It's medium-to-heavy bodied with strong carbonation in play in the mouthfeel.  To me, this is a beer that would have seemed world class fifteen years ago.

Beautifully dark, thick head, and good lacing make for a visually appealing beer. The smell was distinctive to most other Russian imperials but with a good scent of booziness to tingle the nose. The mouthfeel was somewhere between medium and full-bodied but with carbonation that did not necessarily distract from the overall experience. The taste was not my best of Russian imperials I have had, but I'm pretty sure it's up there.

112,412,BloodSoakedAleMug,4.85,"Appearance: One of the best looking stouts I have ever seen. A pitch black beer that pours a huge, three finger khaki colored head that laces the glass exceptionally well. Head retention is superb, and lasts for a good 10 minutes before finally settling down.  Aroma: Lots of dark chocolate and roasted malt with hints of coffee and sweet vanilla. A tiny hint of piney hops and notions of fine tobacco. A little bit of alcohol on the nose as well. A great smelling stout.  Taste: Extremely pleasant. The flavor is predominantly consistent of a creamy, dry, dark roasted malt flavor. I'm getting bittersweet gourmet dark chocolate, rich connecticut tobacco, old leather, hints of vanilla beans, coffee and very very faint notions of sugar cookies. As it warms resinous, piney sensations from the hops assert themselves.  Feel: Full bodied with low carbonation. Smooth and velvety. Crisp (for an RIS).  Overall: Probably my favorite russian imperial of all time. Very hearty and complex, with deep notes of bittersweet chocolate and roasted malt. The mouthfeel and taste are really perfect for the style. The flavor is intricate, robust and creamy without the mouthfeel being too unctuous or slimy. Just dry enough so as to not leave you reaching for a glass of water, and crisp enough to enjoy during the warmer months without being too watery and thin.  This beer isn't for everyone but if you have a palate for dark chocolate and imperial stouts this is one you'll really enjoy.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Builds a nice head of khaki foam that slowly recedes to streaky lace  Smell: Deeply roasted grains, light woodsmoke and emerging alcohol as it warms.  Taste: Complex malt body with layers of roasted and burnt grains, espresso and some bittersweet chocolate in the close. A healthy dose of earthy, bitter, herbal hops keeps any sweetness in check.

112,412,Oopssorryy,4.55,"Pours a dark brown, and settles to a pitch black hue, with a large, thick light tan head resting on top. The head has impressive body, and real staying power, lingering long after most Stouts would have given up. Lacing is prevalent and sticky, leaving rings in the glass as I down the brew. No light passes through even when held up to direct light. The nose is much sweeter than I expected. Very fruity, up front with a softly bitter roast note hiding in the background.  The flavor is full of subtleties, with no one flavor really standing out to me. First sip, and I got a sweet malt that reminded me of bakers chocolate in a way. Next sip was full of bitter roast and hints of licorice. Each mouth full went back and forth between these two flavors, and upon swallowing I got a swell of dark fruit, presently sweet, with a warming alcohol note right at the end. The finish, in contrast to the swallow, is bitter malt that sticks to your tongue flavoring subsequent sips, altering the initial flavors. I feel as if I get hints of coffee here, but that may well be in my head as I know there is none in this fantastic beer.  The beer is a bit thinner than I expected, but still what I'd call a thick beer. There is mild carbonation that you can detect, but it in no way takes anything away from the ultra smooth feel of this beer. Overall this has to be one of the top beers I've had, Stout or not.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,DallasK,4.3,"Ah dear old friend Rasputin, a go to value beer. Pitch black with a wispy ring for a head. Smells of bakers chocolate and roasty sweetness. Taste follows, roasty sweetness, bakers chocolate, prunes/mollasses? A little more hop presence and carbonation than many popular stouts. Solid easy to find offering leaving me wondering why I pay so much for more hard to find beers.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Ahypercube,4.52,"Old Rasputin is an old favorite. Time for a review! Into a goblet...  L: Looks like expresso; super dark, but not too thick or syrupy. Tons of very fine, frothy head that acquires multiple colors, ranging from khaki to cappuccino. Great retention: the lacing formed a nice flat ring around the top of the glass with dripping tendrils.  S: Smoke is immediately apparent, followed by black olives (trust me, I used to eat these out of the can as a child) with hints of soy sauce. Once the initial impressions settle, it turns into dark roast coffee and with sweet notes of raisin, prune, and molasses, finishing in cacao nibs and blackberry jam. Probably the least sweet aroma I've ever found in a stout in my short time drinking beer. Love that dark fruit. Could do with more.  T: Upon first sip, again smoke is immediately apparent, but the salty olive flavor takes over from there, followed by prune, sea salt and blackberry (molasses and vanilla also make a short cameo). The fruit is quickly demolished by strong espresso and tobacco notes, and the finish grows increasingly dry and salty, until ending in a salty, bitter dark chocolate with more black olive and charcoal on the very end. Definitely a tasty finish, I just wish the sweeter notes in the middle lingered longer.  F: Not as thick or creamy as a typical stout, but also not very sweet, which is generally preferable to me. Perhaps this is a necessary trade-off?  O: A fantastic stout. And the only good and affordable one that's widely available (at least in California).",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,Impetuous,3.78,"Perfectly opaque chocolate body with medium dark khaki head slowly dissipates leaving ample legs of lacing.  Taste is dark chocolate and medium roast coffee. I dunno why people are saying this tastes like espresso, the coffee flavor has that light lemon tinge I associate with medium roasts. There is plentiful hop flavor as well, however the dominant malts leave it as a sort of herbal miscellany. Unlike most imperial stouts which become sweeter as they warm, this one - due to the hops- the herbal essences become more apparent. This makes it whilst warm something like a black IPA. Mouthfeel doesn't make itself known, which is to say it's perfect.  Overall pretty good. It's a style I'm partial to as well.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Hallu,4.4,"This is a great classic imperial stout. I love because it's drier than most American stouts. Usually, you get the coffe/chocolate stouts on the sweet side, or a coffee/tobacco/dark fruit stout on the boozy side. But this one has a taste and finish closer to a dry stout, which is great. Like a dry stout, it's not thick either. The nose is heavy on the coffee and dark fruits: prunes and dark grapes. A bit of cacao bitterness, but no real chocolate there. The finish is very long, roasted malt and coffee, very nice. No nuttiness at all, it's actually quite agressive, that's where you can feel its American side as opposed to English stouts. Usually a heavy stout doesn't go well with a sweet dessert, but this would definitely work because of its dryness.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Aroma is chocolate, a hint of raisins, coffee, and booze. Taste follows, but the bitter roasted coffee is more forward and the sweetness is less pronounced, although it balances nicely. Lots of alcohol burn but not unpleasant, I think it's what makes this such a good wintertime sipper.

While not as dark as the likes of Speedway Stout or KBS, this one barely allows any light to pass through. Great retention and lacing for the ABV.

112,412,Caveworm,4.75,"Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout | North Coast Brewing Co. Poured from the bottle into a snifter, the head on this brew is three fingers thick medium brown, and finely bubbled , with solid lacing, and a body dark as night.  I smell generous booze amidst a very nicely brewed stout. You get the conventional notes of dark chocolate, black coffee, raisins, aromatic pipe tobacco, all with a nice-sized smack of dark rum IMO.  Tastes like a deviantly smooth, yet rich version of the aroma. The booze note sits really fantastically with the coffee&chocolate elements of the stout. Adequate warmth from the 9%, but not sharp or harsh;nice and mellow/inviting.  The mouthfeel is thick and slightly chewy with fair carbonation. This alcohol warmth is really welcome on this frigid night, I may add.  Overall, I'll rate Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout | North Coast Brewing Co. with a well-eared 4.75. It's odd to me that I'm just now reviewing this, as it is one of the very first ""big"" beers I've ever had at the very start of my ""craft journey"", so I'd just figured this whole time that it was reviewed by yours truly long ago.

112,412,Steve_Studnuts,4.57,"Gigantic tan head emerges from a black abyss of a beer. Smell is deep roasted grains and something vaguely leathery. Taste is deep and complex. Super dark roast coffee that's pushed almost to burnt but not quite. Dark toasted bread and unsweetened cocoa. Some vanilla and lots of sweet malt. Not enough to go overboard, though; just enough to balance things. Mouthfeel is just about perfect; thick and chewy without being overly so. It's still very drinkable. Man, what a great beer (and value). Standard stouts don't get a whole lot of love in today's marketplace. It's got to be pastry-inspired or barrel-aged to get the beardos lining up.

When I first tried this beer, it tasted like a typical great stout (e.g. a velvety-smooth texture with hints of coffee and chocolate), but there is a bitter aftertaste, that was actually a pleasant surprise (at least to me). Definitely a bit more hops to the flavor than your average stout. The 9% ABV is hidden very well. Mouthfeel: Creamy and smooth going down, which is what you should expect from a top-notch stout.

Smell--Wonderfully complex--smoke, chocolate, and alcohol notes all very pronounced and providing a pleasing warning shot for the faint of heart.  Taste--Perhaps more aggressive than I generally like in this style, so the rating here (4.5) is a compromise--My ""personal"" meter wanted to render a ""4"" but because this is an unapologetic Russian Stout, I ""averaged"" that with the ""5"" it might garner from someone that isn't quite the wimp I am. Strong burnt sugar, coffee, chocolate, and vanilla notes, with a creaminess that gradually increases as it comes closer to room temperature. Very little ""hop"" balance, but that's fine, because the ""booziness"" and carbonation carry the day.  Feel--Big, chewy, and creamy. A perfect sipping beer. I would have said ""perfect"" on the score if it had just a tad more dryness on the finish.

112,412,lwcreasy,4.38,"Black as death. Large, brown head is beautiful and persistent. Bubbly lacing all down the glass is one of the many rewards for glugging down this menacing beer.  Immediately greeting the nose are notes of bread, chocolate, mocha from the malt, and rustic and earthy qualities from the hops in support. Bitter/ baker's chocolate, more bread, toffee, treacle. Wonderful caramelized sugar and a deep, primordial earthiness.  Taste is a combination of chocolates- milk and dark, and mocha coffee. There is a biscuity component, but a rich breadiness and roast character dominate the malt bill. Bitterness is light and pleasant and cuts out toward the finish, as the beer ends with a dollop of warming alcohol and roasty-sweetness. Trace amounts of raisin and berry appear with warmth, but mostly it is the chocolate character increasing, with the roasted coffee tones never falling away. Tasty, complex, wonderful.  Full-bodied, slightly creamy. Very clean with some alcohol warmth on the finish. A very smooth after-effect allows for those delectable malt notes to hang around making music untrammeled.  One of the classic Russian Imperial Stouts, and it lives up to its legend. Incredibly complex in the malt. The rustic hops add a nice support.

112,412,BeerTv,4.55,"Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout (ABV: 9%) (IBU: 75)  This Russian Imperial Stout is brewed in the 18th century tradition of those early Imperial Stouts produced for Catherine the Great's Russian Imperial Court. It’s safe to say this is a beer fit for royalty.  AROMA - dark chocolate, roasted coffee, bready yeast, roasted nuts, hints of raisins and dates  APPEARANCE – pitch/jet black with a frothy tan head, impressive head retention with long streaks of lacing  FLAVOR – bittersweet chocolate, dates, espresso, cinnamon, raisins, black licorice, coffee beans, roasted cocoa, plums, bitter hop pineyness finish, hop/malt ratio balanced  MOUTHFEEL – Very rich and dense, bold with a creamy medium-full body, warming alcoholic sensation, moderate carbonation  OVERALL – Great beer for the chilling Russian weather, or in most of our cases, great for winter time sipping near the fireplace.

T- Chocolate, burnt smokiness, heat, sugar and more heat! This one stays as hot as the day I got them after nearly 2yrs.  M- Creamy good  O- Nice brew. Complex but nothing sticks out at you.

112,412,Kobold,4.31,"Look: Pours a proper admixture of angelic suicide and blood; the black, inscrutable dent revealed when a boulder on the fiend's frozen lake is dug out of its ditch; the swatch of some god-primeval's mourning cloak; oil powering the cavalcade galloping towards Revelation.  Smell: The reek is of confusion, phobia, and midnight blitzkrieg. Chocolate factories incinerated to charcoal; scorched earth at its most evil and intense; memories of milk on the lips of a dying man; flickers of knife sweat as it quick-slits the cord linking body and soul; bread immolating itself to save the bakery; wood chips reaching into the furious atmosphere discombobulated; branches bled of all resin embracingthe air snapping; succubus licked tootsie roll pushed with unrelenting, though magically gentle, force deep into my mouth; sooty licorice and a chunk of boot from the first Hun gunned down discovered in grandfather's box of curios from the Great War; an undecayed grape dropping out of an emperor's tomb.  Taste: For a moment my throat became the conduit to an Awakened World. Then in dropped desperately baked burnt cookies exploding soil and secret coffee bean maps. Where aroma slashes the nostrils the taste is an unroughened arch, a passageway of absolute angles. Autumn fruits that have conspired to hide among the roots of their trees to witness the bitter-sweet passage of light into darkness; insatiable shifting of motion and stillness, euphoria and angst, leather whips and feathers; mud, of ancient origin, shuddering with the promise of rare life; baker's chocolate about to either destroy a cake or elevate it to saturnine tastes; syrup punched with wooden knuckles;  Feel: A sense of my breath being held hostage in a closet between fire and some oblivion hole.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

There's a bitter aftertaste, but it's more of a coffee bitterness as opposed to hops. Feel - great carbonation, somewhat chewy body, but definitely smooth finish. Overall, this is a superb stout.

Look, there are better beers out there with barrel aging and what not, but this is a really really good beer and about a quarter of the price of comparable beers. It packs a punch and is full of rich chocolate, coffee, stouty goodness. You taste, notice the alcohol, but it's smoothed out by the roasty goodness.  I was disappointed by the barrel aged versions of this that do not compare to other barrel aged competitors, but for a straight up RIS, this is the standard and very very good.

Coffee very upfront on taste, warming bitterness to it. Smokiness comes out as it warms. I'm growing into liking coffee being heavily present in a non BA RIS. this is pleasant, not like my first experience with this several months back, I remember thinking day old Hardee's coffee would be preferred over this. Feel is a bit thin for my preference, still pretty close to being really darn good tho.

Such a delicious and intense bouquet. Huge cacao nibs and roasted malts, dark chocolate, coffee, caramel, vanilla, plums.  This beer is awe-inspiring. Nice and pleasant carbonation upfront. A predominantly bitter beer, but its flavor feels somewhat balanced by the multifaceted sweetness. So rounded, the bevy of notes coexist in perfect harmony. Coffee liquor, chocolate, cacao nibs, vanilla, caramel, roasted malts, just a hint of plums. Short after, that hoppy and roasted bitterness prevails, and it leads towards the aftertaste. The finish is predominantly bitter with notes of dark chocolate and malty roastiness. It is a very long aftertaste, and that bitterness coats your palate in a scrumptious manner reminiscent of smoke. Full body, creamy, chewy and smooth.  What a finesse, a world class beer for sure.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Nose of bakers chocolate, caramel, subtle char, vanilla, and coffee with deep roasted malts. Flavors exceed the nose with coffee and bakers cocoa on the front and sides, char hits nicely in the middle and fades into the back with subtle herbal hops and bakers cocoa, light vanilla, and subtle booze and subtle cream....well hidden alcohol.

I know it's 9%, but I've had high ABV beers that don't smell so boozy. Tastes super boozy too. Kinda shocked me. Not what I expected. Booziness has been hidden so well behind other flavors in other big beers like this, why am I getting so much booze now? Not that that ruins it, I like alcohol after all, but still. Feels as heavy as a beer can get. Overall I'd like to try this again NOT on nitro and come back and see if my rating needs updating.

The taste features all of the above but adds a significant malt bitterness. Unlike some stouts the bitterness isn't just at the finish; it's throughout the sip. As the glass warms, the baker's chocolate and burnt coffee grounds become more evident and there is a little more caramel at the finish. This stout is creamy, moderately carbonated, and while the 9% ABV is high in absolute terms, when compared to a lot of higher ABV barrel-aged stouts, this one seems moderate.

Feel: You can feel a bit of some alcohol burn, but you can not blatantly taste it. It's smooth, thick, on the heavier side, almost a bit creamy?

S: not much of an aroma, slightly malty with hint of vanilla and chocolate T: very good. Can really get the chocolate and vanilla flavors, with some notes of coffee and possibly almonds? Slightly nutty, but in a good way. Not too fond of beers with nut flavors F: These can be quaffed like nobodies business, just beware: the 9% ABV will kick in and drop you on the floor if you're not taking these slowly. O: Very good stout. Nitro keg: L: had gas too high, so head was creamy tan half glass. Reset gas, did a Guinness pour, and whole new world. Top 1/2 inch thick marshmallowy cream, below that thick bubbled creamy head, then dark chocolate color beer. S: Not much of a noticeable smell at all. T: Super creamy, smooth, flavors of good stout beer with very slight chocolate and vanilla. Absolutely delicious. You will get a slight sharp alcohol taste as well, due to the high ABV, but nothing like a vodka or bourbon. It's noticeable, which is odd when drinking a beer. F: One of my new favorites. Guy was out of LH Milk Stout, offered this for same price. Now it's my 3rd favorite over the prior and Guinness. O: A great beer that needs to be in everyone's fridge or kegerator.

The taste is lush and full, toasted grains and fruit juice, raisins, walnuts and tobacco. A solid malty backbone with high-notes of slick, roasted bitterness and very little aftertaste.  Feel is smooth, medium-full bodied and mouth coating with just enough carbonation to get the job done.  Overall, an excellent, beautifully bitter RIS.

Pours a brownish tan head, wish it had a slightly bit more head to give it that perfect look but its enough.  S - Very malty smell, chocolate with a little bit of cherry. It smells like a strong stout should. However the smell fades kind of fast.  T - WOW! First off it just hits you with that nice maltyness that you could smell, followed by a nice balance of coffee and chocolate with a little bit of vanilla and tobacco underneath. Just an awesome balance of bitter and sweet flavors.  F - That malt just crisps your tongue so nicely, it feels like a stout and taste like a stout.  On Tap Poured into a 10 oz tulip glass L - It looks so much cleaner, it pours a crisp tan foamy head that balances with the blackness of the stout itself. Overall its beautiful to look at.  S - Mostly the same however the maltyness is a little bit more pronounced, the smell of coffee hits you more.  T - Oh my damn, I didn't think it could get any better but I was wrong, after already being a huge fan of the bottle version the tap was phenomenal, the coffee and chocolate hit with a more robust flavoring that counteract the bitterness of the end of the beer. It tastes like a stout poured from heaven itself.  F - So much more smooth, I feel like I could drink it all day.

Rasputin pours black crowned by a creamy brown head that quickly dissipates into the black abyss. The nose is a complex blend of molassas, honey, stonefruits, and alchohol. The taste is even more complex journey through three distinct sessions. Session one is a bold tongue lashing of coffee, malt, burnt popcorn, and alcholol. The second act softens into a sweet chocolate base with notes of dried fig and cherry. The third act is marked by a mild bitterness, salts, and toffee as the malt sweetness fades.

Old Rasputin blends and roasts its malts exceptionally and WWS has a wonderful yeast.  Rasputin was not a man who made a positive contribution to human development, it should be remembered. Nonetheless, the stout is exceptional. It Looks like its dark namesake. It Smells like a burnt chocolate dessert. It Tastes like that too; reminding you that sweet needs to be controlled by bitter.

The foam is a nice deep tan/khaki color. Great head retention. Bubble replenishment is great.  Smell: Very rich coffee, hops, and chocolate. There is a fair amount of sweet syrup that wafts up as well. There is a slight smoky smell along with a bit of caramel.  Taste: A good deal of hop bitterness cuts through right up front. Then it kicks into sweet caramel, coffee, toffee, chocolate, and hops (rich and savory, not bitter). There is a nice roasted/smoky flavor in there. The sweetness starts to fade out, and some hop bitterness seems to come back as it dries out. I was left with a very nice aftertaste when the flavors die out. Tastes of smoked grains, caramel syrup, and hops linger on.  Feel: Very rich, thick, and full bodied. Never goes flat and a bit oily.  Overall: This is an amazing beer. I have seen this beer in the top beers list for a while. I can see why. This beer is very good with many complex flavors. There are sweet flavors, bitter flavors, slightly fruity, hoppy, and smoky. This tastes like a mixture of a few beers: Black IPA, Brown Porter, Chocolate Stout, Coffee Stout, and a Milk Stout. Very impressive.

You get loads of sweet dark chocolate, licorice, caramel, figs, raisins, and soy sauce balanced by an intense bitterness of petrychor, black coffee, leather, and tobacco smoke. The palate delivers. You get tons of dark chocolate, cocoa powder, burnt toast, caramel, a little of soy sauce, fig, plum, raisin, burnt sugar, and black coffee. The balance between sweet and bitter is perfection. Finishes decidedly bitter, yet complex, with lingering notes of baking chocolate and espresso. The mouthfeel is creamy, silky smooth, and ridiculously awesome to drink.  Overall: A hell of a beer. One of the best imperial stout, non-barrel aged, I could imagine. Absolutely beautiful.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Taste is similar, not as chocolatey as the smell lead me to believe: flavors of black coffee, dark chocolate, smoke, molasses, licorice...I could go on all day dissecting this beer.

Very little head if you poor it slow, but a nice creamy head if you poor it hard.  S - Alcohol is noticeable, but not too strong. It smells a bit like the lingering aroma of home brewed coffee.  T - You can taste the booze, for sure, but it's not over-powering. Drinking it goes down smooth, but it's got some bitter notes on the back end, like you just had a shot of espresso and chunk of quality dark chocolate (none of that sweet crap, but the 90% cacao stuff).

Sweet, roasty, fruity, light char, licorice, caramel mocha nose. Astringency from roasted chocolate malt and coffee are initial impressions on first sip.

112,412,boilermakerbrew,4.79,"Can't believe that I haven't reviewed this one yet, but here it goes. Pour is almost black, but really a very dark brown in body. A big, dense, and creamy head forms and hangs around forever. Lacing is amazing. Scent is mostly very bitter burnt malt up front with a slight touch of anise in the middle. Semisweet chocolate at the back end of the smell that sweetens the nose up just a bit.  When the liquid hits the tongue, the bitter malts burst onto the tongue first. Burnt flavors plus anise are prominent, quickly followed by slightly less bitter dark chocolate. Anise and black licorise really ramps up on the back end of the drink and the flavor really dries out. Lingering flavors are burnt and dark, with just a slight hint of charcoal. On the palate, this beer is very smooth and creamy despite the relatively high level of carbonation. The alcohol is very hidden, with only a slight warming being felt.  Overall, I really need to make more of a point to drink this more often. It is on tap and on shelves everywhere, and apparently I have just been ignoring it.

Damn near jet black, with a dark, dark tan head that laces very well. Smells like heaven, heavily roasted malts with just a twinge of chocolaty sweetness. Tastes pretty much like it smells, roasty, cocoa, chocolate, a bit of dark roast coffee, with a bit of a bitter hop character in there as well. A light warming alcohol feel at the back of your throat that's pronounced, yet subtle. It's actually not as thick as one might expect, medium to medium-high mouthfeel as it warms.

Good carbonation when rocking the glass back and forth. AROMA: A floral note is the first thing I get, followed by rich dark molasses, some soy sauce, and chocolate. Coffee and a leathery quality, as well. No alcohol in the nose. TASTE: The flavor is much bigger than the aroma with big dark chocolate, a little alcohol, licorice, coffee, molasses and that leathery quality. A slight soy sauce quality but really mild compared to other stouts in this category, that I've had. MOUTHFEEL: Creamy and smooth, slightly dry on the very back.

Aroma is primarily roasted malts, kiss of caramel, a bit of dark fruits, and I do get some alcohol.  I'm disappointed for the associated rating on here. Highly carbonated, relatively dry, and rather bitter. The high carbonation creates a lighter feel. The flavor is not complex -- primarily a very heavily roasted malt. The malt is not sweet; in fact it's so heavily roasted, it contributes to the bitterness. The beer transitions from a carbonation tickle, to roasted malts, to a dry bitterness with a finish of some alcohol.  Overall, it didn't hit the spot. Not complex; pretty one-noted.

This fell slowly into a nice raft, leaving lots of lacing in its wake  The nose is malty and sweet, chocolate, vanilla, and a slightly bourbon-like alcohol touch. There's also subtle earthy hops in the background. It's not one of those massive noses that knocks you over as soon as the cap comes off the bottle, but it's very nice just the same.  Flavors are bittersweet chocolate right up front, supported by dark-roast coffee and toasted nuts. Peppery flourishes come in near the finish, which is long and dry, with just a touch of subtle hop bitterness. An assertive but very balanced beer.  Mouth-feel is big, rich and smooth (but not syrupy or tongue-coating) with moderate carbonation. There is a very distinct alcohol warmth that lingers nicely. A sipper to be sure.  This is a beer I was very eager to try, with a large cult following. Those accolades are all richly deserved- Russian Imperial Stout is one of my personal favored styles, and I can honestly say I've only had one other that is at this level (Oskar Blues Ten FIDY.)

Very rich aromas.  Feel: Heavy bodied, with perfect carbonation and creaminess.  Taste: Immediate bitter coffee and dark cocoa, and dark malts. Those remain into the back end, where the caramel and toffee pick up, and all blend into the aftertaste. Some alcohol burn on the back as it warms up.

A twinge of coffee/dark chocolate, but the dominant scent is roasted malt.  Taste: ticks all the components you'd expect/desire for an RIS. Begins with sweetness and caramelly flavor, moves into roasted malt and bitter coffee notes, and finishes with some dark chocolate flavor. Flavor is complex and nuanced. Delicious.

Look: Pours a very dark brown, with a nice amount of beige colored head (lighter color than the Narwhal) that lasts; nice lacing.  Smell: Dark malts, sugar, a bit of dark fruits, perhaps a twinge of spiciness.  Taste: Not too complex, but plenty of dark malts, some hops, and some sweetness.  Feel: Almost like drinking chocolate milk: medium to heavy mouth-feel, and very creamy.  Overall: This is one of my go-to imperial stouts, and I have been drinking it for at least a couple of years now. I liked Narwhal better in just about every way, but this one is still a solid RIS I would be happy to sip anytime.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

O - At 9% abv, this is a strong beer but don't expect your taste buds to let you know. It is very well balanced and true to its style. A stout's stout! Yet, there is nothing that stands out.

Smell - roasted coffee, hint of Bakers chocolate or cocoa. Not really getting anything else. (Chocolate reveals itself more on warming)  Taste - way more coffee than chocolate. No alcohol readily evident, so the 9% abv is well hidden. Disappointing, not a lot going on here but on the positive side, nothing really wrong either.

Taste is very good, but a little simplistic compared to other RIS beers I've been having lately. Coffee and chocolate dominate, and not a lot else really.

Beyond those, lie mild aromas of molasses and coffee, subtle bittersweet chocolate, and hints of alcohol. TASTE: Strong flavors of toffee, raisins, and plums combine to create the initial taste (as my nose would of guessed). Strong molasses flavors along with mild coffee and bittersweet chocolate eneter immediately after as initial flavors persist. As all flavors fade into the after taste, bittersweet chocolate flavors become angry and lose their sweetness and end up being very bitter. FEEL: Full-bodied and moderately carbonated.

Each sniff brought out a deeper texture to the aroma, like it was building off of each previous smell. Taste: Smooth and refined tastes that pleased my palate very much. All of the aforementioned aromas put to the tongue; a backbone of bitter bakers chocolate, and a bit of brown sugar. A licorice like middle of the mouth flavor gives way to roasty malt and slight coffee bitterness. Mouthfeel: Rich, yet smooth. Complex body with a milkshake texture almost, yet very drinkable.

112,412,taxandbeerguy,4.46,"355 ml bottle served fairly cold into a pint glass. Purchased while visiting Niagara Falls. Old Rasputin seems to be one of the flagbearers for the style based on comments from forums over the past couple of years. It may not be the absolute best Russian Imperial Stout, but it's top-notch, accessible and virtually everyone agrees it's a great beer. Really looking forward to this.  Appearance - Jet balck. Massive two and a half fingers of tan head, even with a gentle pour. Impressive head retention. Not a ton of lacing left behind but certainly some. Dark, ominous and brooding. I like where this is going....  Smell - Rich coffee aroma, but thrown in with a ton of leafy hops which add to the impact that the coffee brings to the nose. Some licorice, treacle and molasses combination settles in behind the coffee and the hops. Very impressive and not overdone. Cafe mocha as the beer warms a bit with coffee elements, dialed down with cream and a touch of vanilla. Phenomenal.  Taste - Starts fairly bitter with some coffee transitioning into a lighter and flavorful coffee and cream whipped drink. Then taste fades out before a slightly smokey flavor seeps in then finishes a sit began with an intense bitteness. Toffee and dark chocolate start coming through as the beer warms.  Mouthfeel - Smooth and relatively light on its feet, moderate carbonation and body given the 9% ABV, it drinks significantly lighter. A little oily and slick but it finishes moderate with a long -long-long lasting aftertaste.  Overall - Paid $3 USD per bottle, which given the exchange rate is like $4 CDN, but top shelf stuff, on par or maybe even better than St. Ambroise's RIS, just truly great stuff.

The palate is alcohol and bitter roasted malt- mostly molasses and bitter, bitter chocolate- with the alcohol notes gaining traction towards the back of the palate. The finish is a flash of chocolate followed by a beer-defining roasted bitterness that lingers forever. Mouthfeel is a bit thinnish for the full body, but creamy and warming, and peppery from some very fizzy carbonation.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,Reema,5,"Serving type: 12 oz bottle  It's really dark, black essentially. It looks good. Smells toasty, coffee-like, nutty even. Smells great. Amazing really. Tastes as it smells, toasty roasty coffee goodness, slightly sweet maltiness, with a small alcohol burn at the end. It tastes pretty great. Very thick feeling with moderate carbonation that gives the beer a pleasant creamy feel.  I love this stuff. Will definitely be buying more for years to come.  Update 9/29/16 Still buying 4 packs of this on a monthly basis. Quite literally the best Russian Imperial Stout on the market, available year round and found easily.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Cutlass,4.1,"Look - Inky black with a couple inches of copper head that eventually dissolved almost completely  Smell - heavily malty with notes of coffee and just a touch of whiskey (bourbon maybe?)  Taste - malty as expected though balanced by a bitter herbal hop aftertaste and some bite from the high alcohol content  Feel - smooth with relatively little carbonation  Overall - A tasty and interesting beer; this is my first russian imperial stout so I am unable to compare it to others within its style, but definitely worth a try",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,hopphead31415,4.61,"I once tried this beer in a four-pack that was chilled down real good. It was my first time getting a brew that was in a four-pack, so it was a bit interesting. This brew boasts 9.0% ABV, but I have heard people say it drinks more like a 10-11% so watch out. It has 75 IBUs, but has plenty of sweetness so don’t worry.  Look-It pours a deep dark black. It leaves an initially thick head that has a copper tinge. It later disappears and leaves little to no lacing on the glass.  Smell-The aroma is roasted coffee, chocolate, toffee, and caramel with a slight acidity. It smells strongly of the rich creamy malts and a bite from the alcohol.  Taste-The coffee, chocolate, toffee, licorice, and spices are abundant smells that are cut with a vengeance by a sharp whiskey-like bite from the ample alcohol. The hops that linger afterwards are bitter but are also accompanied by a spicy aftertaste like nutmeg, cinnamon, ginger, black licorice, some cola, candied plums, and raisins.  Mouthfeel-It has a thick, chewy, rich, creamy, full-bodied, and smooth/silky mouthfeel. But it also has some noticeable fizz from the medium ambient carbonation. There is a lingering smoked wood coating on the tongue that has resins similar to cedar and red oak.  Overall-It is a very nice beer, but you better pour it or get it on tap. The aromas come out clean and complement the taste if your olfactory system is primed with the smell. The alcohol is quite powerful so watch out, but cuts the sweet full-bodied malt backbone that is freckled with a plethora of delicious spices and flavors as I describe above. This beer really deserves the Imperial Stout name and it is easily a world class beer. The bros give it a top score and I will as well. Cheers!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Quite dense and incredibly smooth. Creeping choclatey bitterness initially, gradually engulfing the palate in an unstoppable wave of rich flavor. There's a subtle sweetness in there, in the shadows. Amidst these polarizing characteristics is a deep, dark roastiness that engulfs, even dominates the later portion of this beer. The aftertaste sees a smokey, raw coffee bean-like flavor emerge, which hangs around for quite a while after the beer is gone.  A very well-made, enjoyable, and traditional RIS. Within the style, this one easily stands up to Founders IS and SN Narwhal.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Initially I get some aroma hops tinging the nostril, however this is mowed over by strong scents of deep roasted malts, chocolate, and brown sugar. Initially the palate is calmed with a smooth and creamy cocoa/brown sugar flavor, then it is overrun with toasted malts that are strong but not overbearingly ashy like some stouts. The alcohol is hidden well here with the flavors, and the texture is rather smooth on the palate.

Robust taste of roasted malts, dark coffee and hops providing the bitterness; also, a hint of vanilla and/or dark fruits providing a sweetness. Full bodied, creamy and a finish that is both bitter and sweet. A wonderful complex and flavorful beer.

112,412,Caj1,4.61,"Man oh man, am I glad I found this at the package store. I will have to beg the manager to keep stocking it.  A: Beautiful. Cascading pour is reminiscent of a Guinness but the bubbles don't waterfall since there isn't nitrogen infused. A two-inch caramel head that refuses to die. Becomes pillowy and leaves minimal lacing. The foam slides down the side of the glass and recollects on top of the beer. Beer is a deep, deep red-brown from what little I can see on the edge of the mug but the body is black. Light does not penetrate.  S: warm and malty sweet like some graham cracker and allspice. Light fruitiness probably from hops since yeast is probably killed by the higher ABV. A little bit of grass and earth. Slight alcohol vapor takes it to the head.  T: VERY rich and complex. Toasted biscuit or sweetbuns with good rounded coffee notes and some dark chocolate depth. Slight bitterness from hops and toasted grain. Malt is sweet and bready without being cloying. Slight alcohol astringency helps cut the malt stickiness and the dark toast flavors linger for a long time.  M: Rich, full-bodied and creamy from foam. Alcohol helps dry the palate a little and cuts the sticky malt and sugar and it leaves a nice bite after enveloping the mouth in rich softness.  Beautiful beer and well worth the $2.50 (plus tax!) per bottle. Very few bad notes here and they are just nitpicks. It could use a point or so less ethanol but it leaves a lovely buzz so it is worth it. Also I would enjoy slightly more chocolate but again that is subjective. Great stuff.

Taste is a complex sequence of events, from an initial bittersweetness of burnt toast and light anise, which moves sharply to a alcohol twang with campfire smoke, a woody taste that isn't unpleasant, to a lingering bitterness in the back of the mouth that is a complex interplay of roasted malt and hops bittering elements.

112,412,ARoman,3.91,"*transferred from previous notes - 1/12/2014* On tap (nitro) poured into a stemmed tulip. Chocolate and coffee are the most pronounced and immediate aromas, accompanied by a more faint caramel aroma and a distinct ash aroma. A thick, jello-like, tan head (gotta love nitro taps!) sits on a dark, opaque black (maybe brown?) body. The head - of which a half a finger is present throughout - leaves a nice, marble-like lacing. It’s a medium bodied, sticky beer which kicks off with a caramel and dark cherry sweetness that immediately gives way to coffee and dark chocolate bitterness followed, not too long after, by a smokey / ashy finish. After a little while, when it starts to mellow out with warmth, the sweetness is not as pronounced up front, and sticks around a bit longer than just the initial taste. A touch of sourness hides in the background throughout the drink and it leaves a dry smokey, bready mouthfeel behind. Fun complexities in the taste of this one.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

It is a strong beer, but a lot of flavors going on. Chocolate, coffee, toffee, dark fruit... What separates this from others is the balance and the mouthfeel. And it's hoppy; you don't sense it until all the other flavors fade and you get an astringency/dryness from the hops. F: perfect. Thick, coats the mouth and doesn't go away quickly.

A massive dose of jet-black roasted malt, spicy hops, coffee, some liquorice, bits of smoke.  Feel: Surprisingly not too oily but rather refreshing on the palate. Carbonation is inoffensive.  Overall, if you like dark beers, this is a significant one to at least try, even if it is too dark for one's taste in the end. For myself, it has rapidly become a favourite.

I feel that a higher level or carbonation would detract from the ability to taste this delicious beer.  Overall - 4.25/5 Overall this was a very good beer. Probably not my favorite Russian Imperial Stout, I think there are some better ones out there. In particular, this one was a little too hoppy for me.

S - Rich roasty aroma with chocolate and coffee aromas secondary. Good blend of acrid roastiness and rich malt and chocolate malt.  T - Very similar to the smell; has the roastiness from the smell first but closely accompanied by the rich chocolate, malt, and coffee tones. It is full flavored with a stronger bitterness that helps balance the sweetness. Not as big as some but plenty of flavor. More on the bitter char side but still enough malt to make this a tasty beer.  M - High mouth-feel. High carbonation. This one just erupted with carbonation as I poured not expecting such vigor from the solution. I like the carbonation because even though it is a viscous beer the carbonation and bitterness do a good job of tricking your mind into thinking that it is lighter. This beer finishes well for being over carbed and less sweet.  Overall, this is a very good imperial stout. This is an above average RIS just because I like the roast forward nature of it but I still prefer Ten Fidy with its sheer power.

Smell - nothing stands out, just a bit of alcohol, though not as overwhelming as I'd expected  Taste - starts off with a bitter bite, in the way of a strong coffee, with noticeable (but not overwhelming) alcohol present. This fades into a roasted flavor, and leaves a bitterness on the back of the tongue for a bit.  Feel - It is smooth,not very carbinated, texture is more water than cream, but not very watery.  Overall: This is an OK stout. I don't know how it compares to other RIS's, since this is only the second one that I've tasted. I drink alot of regular stouts, however, and love em. I bought Old Rasputin because of the hype; I thought this was going to be either an ""I really LOVE it"" or ""Omg, I HATE it!"" beer, based on the reviews. However, I just feel in the middle. It's not bad, I'll enjoy drinking the bottles I have, and I might buy it again, but I won't be in a rush to do so. It's simply OK.  I was expecting a lot more complexity, but really, I think it's kind of bland. I've tasted stouts with a lot more flavor than this, and I've also had stouts that have a much harder alcohol bit than this.

(A head to head tasting would be nice, but Holy moly, a 10.5 and a 9.0, maybe i got to clean up the house and invite about 20 people over for a proper stout tasting with about 5 bottles of imperials and some sessions for after...)  Any way, back to the review. This is solid black as a stout should be, with a two finger brown head. The aroma is a good balance of both dark malt and hop scents. My personal prejudice is that a stout is about the dark malt, to me, Old Rasputin's aroma is properly on the malty side.  The taste is well balanced. Compared to the Founder's imperial, some hops bitterness shows through, but the high alcohol is not evident in the taste; at only 9% instead of 10.5%, it is a little easier to hide.  This is certainly one of the great American stouts by reputation, and it lives up to the reputation in my tasting.

It's like a lightly carbonated mudslide. I give a 4 instead of 5 on taste because I feel it's a tad too bitter.

112,412,Foxybrau,3.74,"I'm a noob to stouts, but learning fast, just don't love this one as much as so many do. Sudsy brass head that contrasts nicely to the black body. It looks fantastic. I find it a bit thin in the mouth, mostly charred and hoppy. Plenty of black coffee but I don't find the sweetness and malt. A very good beer, not world class to me, but I'll definitely give it another shot as I've loved North Coast thus far.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Dr_Leafy_Green,4.15,"Poured from bottle into a pint glass. Dark brown with tan head dissolving to a lace. Slightly sweet aroma backed by pronounced coffee and molasses. Tastes pretty much like it smells. It starts with a light sweetness on the tip of the tongue, followed by a pronounced coffee and molasses flavor. Slight hint of dark chocolate. Carbonation gives it a balanced feel.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,BigBry,4.29,"On tap at Craft Beer Market in Calgary. Pitch black color, light brown head. Left thick rings of lacing. Smells of bittersweet chocolate, some coffee, roasted and a bit smokey. Taste has lots of coffee, more dark and bitter chocolate, cocoa. Espresso coffee hangs around at the end. Thick and creamy, full mouth feel, low carbonation. Very good, lots of coffee. Worthy of its world-class rating.  Note to Self: Ranked #21 best Russian Imperial Stout when I had it",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Despite the hefty body, it is easy to drink  Overall - this is a benchmark beer for the style in my opinion.

It had a light coffee aroma. Smelled malty with a bit of a dark fruit aroma.  Some hoppy bitterness at first followed by darker chocolatey flavors with some very faint fruitiness. Roasty aftertaste with definite coffee notes and a lingering bitterness.  Smooth feel with plenty of carbonation. Satisfyingly chewy.  Overall a fine beer with rich, traditional stout flavors.

112,412,CHickman,4.46,"Pours pitch black motor oil color with a massive 3 finger thick tan head that was full of active bubbles of all sizes that popped and shifted as the head slowly dissipated, leaving good spotty lacing and a layer on top.  Smells of burnt coffee, roasted grains, floral hops, charcoal, burnt wood, toffee, espresso, cocoa powder and everything that makes up a rich stout nose that’s full of chocolate malts and strong coffee notes. Very lovely to inhale, this hides the ABV completely.  Tastes as good as it smells but with more chocolate and caramel present in the flavor; it starts off with dark chocolate, caramel, toffee, burnt coffee, cocoa powder, then adds in some mild grapefruit, floral hops, espresso, vanilla, charcoal, burnt wood, burnt grains, earthy notes like peat moss and molasses. This bottle is about a year old and there is a boozy element like rum towards the end, but it mixes well with the burnt malts, cocoa and hop bitterness. There is some heat from the ABV, but it’s a mild burn that doesn’t have any negative flavor impact, just a warming feeling.  Mouthfeel is smooth and almost creamy with a heavy dense body that’s chewy, it has mild carbonation, a nice chocolatey/coffee sweetness, and a slightly bitter finish that trails off with nice charred notes and coffee grinds that somehow manage to come back less bitter and more sweet like the caramel circled back to say hello.  This has always been an extremely enjoyable beer to sip and savor, and although this is the first time I’ve reviewed it formally, I have been drinking this beer for a decade and have always thought it was an excellent stout. A high recommendation, go get some and enjoy it.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,greencrush,4.92,"This one poured a deep brown, nearly black, with a thick sudsy tan head that left excellent lacing down the glass. This was poured from a cold bottle into your run of the mill dinner glass; nothing special. A moderately vigoroua pour is needed with this one, go to hard, and you'll easily overflow your glass. The first wiff out of the freshly opened bottle comes across sweet and chocolaty, which, to be honest, is what I was expecting. The arouma only grows stronger as the brew is poured. ""Wow"", my literal response to the first sip. Sweet chocolaty flavours erupt upon the palate, giving way to coffee and char. Only after swallowing do the hoppy, bitter flavours that I personally prefer in a breq emerge. It may take a few sips for the true cacao flavours of this one to emerge.

Lacing is some of the most amazing I have seen, it is thick and glues itself to the sides of the glass!!. Aroma is of malt, roasted coffee, spice and a hint of chocolate. Taste is bold, with burnt malt/coffee being predominant. Could have used with a little more roast and less burnt. Alcohol is pretty well hidden for a 9% ABV. The undertones of coffee, spice and light chocolate would have been better if it wasn't for the overwhelming burnt bitterness.

Pouring it into my snifter, it looks almost motor oil black with a khaki head that settles into nice lacing on top. The smell is one of dark roast malts. Bitter coffee grinds to say the least. That dark roast carries over to the taste. Not exactly sure how to describe it, but I like it. The mouhtfeel is rich and coats the tongue and taste buds with that roasty goodness.

112,412,JJKBeerLvr,4.24,"Sampled December 2014 from tap in pint glass.  Appearance: Very dark color, dark tan head that lasted for a while.  Smell: Sweet with strong toasted coffee aromas, also some hints of the hops.  Taste: Full-bodied with great balance of malt and hops. Dominated by roasted coffee, but with some chocolate flavor as well. Taste starts sweet with malts, then comes the roasted coffee flavors, and then a little bitterness from the hops. Overall a great combination.  Mouthfeel: Full-bodied, but smooth.  Overall: Great stout. Best if you enjoy a combination strong malts & coffee, with a little bitterness from the hops. I will buy this again.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,ZoomanCru,4.76,"Old Rasputin - Russian Imperial (9%) - North Coast Brewing (California) ☆☆☆☆☆  App: Pours an oil black that is truly opaque, allowing no light to pass through. Rich brown head rises two fingers quickly, with good retention and lots of lacing.  Smell: Deep roasted aroma with notes of chocolate and black coffee, slightly earthy, accompanied by a subtle alcohol twinge that carries the aromas high into the nose.  Taste: Deeply roasted malt dryness flashes across the palate early, then runs parallel with a very subtle, dark chocolate like sweet/bitter complex. Alcohol is present, but balanced enough to never taste hot. Allowed to warm flavors meld together, uniting to become all the characteristics simultaneously. Alcohol lends a mild spicy taste that lifts the otherwise heavy malt character at the end making each subsequent sip another wallop of flavor. Yum.  Mouth: Heavy bodied with smooth carbonation that compliments style very well. Alcohol and bitterness from roasted malt remove any stickiness from the body.

112,412,Johnquisssssssy,3.79,"Nice thick oatmeal head onto a dark opaque brown nearly black. Nice lacing. I have had this on nitro as well as from bottle, as it is here. At first I felt I picked up almost a marshmallow/caramel aroma on the nose but that dissipated; It's a nice chocolate/coffee with only a hint of smoke. Everything is relatively subtle for a big beer like this; not overly sweet or smokey or boozy.

112,412,ccoyle,4.51,"Poured into a chilled pint glass. I read on BA somewhere that chilled glasses are no-no, but I like them, so what can I say?  Appearance: VERY dark brown, almost black, almost completely opaque. Pouring into the glass produced a good 2"" of tan head that lasted a long while and left very persistent lacing.  Smell: One of the weaker points for me, perhaps because I didn't use the requisite glass type. Definitely the coffee/chocolate smell typical of the type, but not pronounced.  Taste: Coffee, chocolate, and roasted malt. A moderate hoppiness followed by a surprising citrus-like tanginess. Definitely good stuff.  Feel: Velvety smooth and lightly carbonated.  Overall: Lives up to the hype, in my estimation (such as that is).

A- completely obscures the light on an opaque black shade as beautiful as the heavens. Perfect half inch of leather hughed head.  S- a hearty dose of malty roasted hops followed by a sweet cream.  T- this Beauty had all of the good points of old rasputin with a tone down soy sauce flavor of the original which makes it more balanced. Cream is the prevalent flavor in addition to coffee malt toffee caramel chocolate and just a minor salty soy flavor preceeding the finish of big toasted hop goodness and malt.

I actually took a tortilla chip and scooped it in the head as though it were dip.  S - Sweet and malty, but honestly hard to smell through the thick layer of head isulating it  T - This was semi-sweet molassas, malt; no coffee or burnt roast detected  F - Very smooth, thick, almost no carbonation  O - Absolutely loved it  My first Old Rasputin and didn't know what to expect.

112,412,Tsar_Riga,4.33,"A - Rock solid black, with the slightest edge of brown transparency, building up a full tan head that is extraordinarily persistent. The lacing literally coats the glass to start, leaving a pattern down the glass.  S - Dark fruits and chocolate, hops in the form of floral notes, and a strong hit of alcohol.  T - Following the nose, the start is plum and raisin, with bittersweet chocolate. There is a distinct rise of hop bitterness in the middle, along with hints of toasted bread. The close fades back to black coffee acidity, a bit of char, and a hint of citrus zest.  M - The feel is slick and full, while the warmth in the close is a reminder that this is an imperial stout, a heavy hitter.  O - Old Raspy delivers a robust RIS experience, without barrels. It uses fairly robust hopping, to great effect, and avoids the mistake of some hoppy stouts by fully integrating the hop into the stout elements of roasted malts.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,DenverHopHead,4.2,"Poured from a bottle with no clear freshness dating; into a pint glass. Appearance - as dark as 4AM, with the slightest bit of light coming in at the bottom of the glass. Head is a toasted marshmallow pillow! Lacing is phenomenol! Smell - a blend of cream, milk and dark chocolate. Taste - more coffee and espresso and less chocolate compared to the nose. Some vanilla and dark chocolate that eventually shows up. Feel - a coffee and dark chocolate bitterness, followed by a creamy yet roasted marshmallow coat on the tongue. Complex from first sip to last; this has a frame that could handle a much bigger ABV! Overall - high quality brew, though I have a few others higher on my list.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Wolvmar,4.15,"Pours exceptionally dark with a huge head that lingers on and on with beautiful lacing. One of the best pours I’ve seen. Nose faint with some chocolate, some hops notes but overall pretty faint. Tastes like burnt toast with good balance of hop bitterness and creamy Stout malts. Little aftertaste and pretty refreshing for a bigger beer. Let it warm and you will enjoy the nuances even more. Mouthfeel is solid, a good balance of moderate carbonation, creamy malts, but not as complex as some imperial stouts. Gets better as the beer warms. Overall, really good. A long time ago, when this was one of the first imperial stouts I had, I thought it was exceptional. Now, with competition much higher, my rating comes down, but this is still a great beer. Definitely one to drink chilled but not cold. Maybe just below room temperature.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Kishanti,4.75,"Pours black with a sudsy chestnut head. Nose is dark and syrupy with a light medicinal astringency: cocoa bean, espresso, roasted malt, everclear. Crisp and straightforward when gulped: bitter, effervescent, and warming, with lingering hops, chocolate, malt. Readily coats the mouth and increases in sweetness aerated.  Old Rasputin is one of my go-to beers and one of the (several) reasons I first fell in love with North Coast. A potent, heady, mysteriously drinkable warmer.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Alpha309,4.47,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip.  Pours a very dark, nearly ebony color. About one finger of foamy caramel covered head.

Low in carbonation, but very smooth.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Viaduck,4.37,"Dark as a moonless night with a very generous tan head. Smells sweet, dark chocolate & espresso. Taste is slightly bitter with some sweetness.

112,412,humuloner22,4.49,"I have seen this one around for a while, but honestly I did not know what it was. I have been more hardcore into stouts lately and I felt that it was time to expand my horizons. I honestly purchased this beer on blind faith. I had no idea what I was purchasing and had no idea the high reviews it received on here.  Appearance: pours black as widows dreams, no light at all, large amount of head, it could have been the Bell's tulip I poured it into. The head remains fairly substantial and is a khaki caramel color.  Smell: Boozy at first, but nice chocolate and coffee aromas are in there. Definitely a more coco driven stout than coffee though. Sweet caramel and malts are also in there and maybe some vanilla.  Taste: It does have some alcohol burn, but its a 9% beer, however I have had 9% beers that had no burn at all. Good mild coffee, dark chocolate and vanilla notes, but the vanilla definitely takes a back seat to the chocolate. This is pretty boozy beer. I get a lot of alcohol in this one though. Its not really well hidden and it is also kind of on the thin side but not too much, I would prefer this one be a bit thicker on the mouth.  Overall: Solid beer, I have had better stouts, I am a bit surprised at the high ratings on here, but I guess that is because it has been around a while. Its good but not great. My main problem is that the booze is not all that well hidden.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,Lucular,4.37,"Bought a 4-pack and plan to enjoy over a few years, buying a fresh 4-pack once a year. Cracked one open (relatively) fresh and this is simply an amazing RIS. The aroma or vanilla and chocolate is arguably the best part but this beer has no weaknesses. Less bitter than SN Narwhal but still a good hoppy bite to balance out the chocolate/coffee/vanilla sweetness. Incredibly smooth and delicious for an imperial stout.

112,412,BergBeer,4.55,"Look: Opaque Black with a thick mocha colored head. Pours thick. Mild activity.  Smell: Rich black malt. Notes of dark roast coffee, dried dates, burnt bread, chocolate covered espresso beans, black molasses, roasted nuts, hints of cinnamon, nutmeg, and a lightly present booze.  Taste: Sharp dark coffee, black malt, and light burnt toast on the attack. A body of chocolate covered espresso beans, dried dates covered in honey, burnt nuts, dried figs, caramelized sugar, dark chocolate covered blueberries, and a hint of floral bitter hops.  Feel: Medium plus body. Oily as it coats the whole palate. Moderate bitterness. Mild plus alcohol. Solid carbonation. Semi-dry finish.  Overall: An exemplary Russian Imperial Stout. It hits all the right notes roasty, bold, lightly sweet, and most importantly you get the hop note a russian Imperial Stout should have. It’s rich without being decadent. I feel that so many Imperial stouts go way too sweet these days and are afraid of having any bitter burnt notes. This brew has them throughout while remaining incredibly balanced.

T: [4.25] The taste is milk chocolate up front then after some time it is bitter-sweet chocolate at the back. There is a smokey element to the taste also.

O: [4.00] Very night flavor profile with chocolate and smoke. The 9% ABV is well hidden.

112,412,doktorhops,4.5,"Can North Coast be my beer messiah when Founders Breakfast Stout is out of stock at Plonk? I ask myself, seemingly knowing the answer is “no” but wanting nonetheless for there to be another Stout as good as FBS. For starters Rasputin, apart from being a wily-old/long dead Russian monk is a Russian Imperial Stout (the beer not the person), and RIS’s are a bold adventurous lot brewed by the English to sate the wild palates of bold Slavic Czars... who knows, Rasputin may have it.  Poured from a 355ml bottle into a nonic pint.  A: Rasputin was a dark, scraggily-haired and slightly menacing monk. This beer has personified old-raspy well with its jet-deep chocolate body and a tan head that leaves Sanskrit writing, in the form of lace, inside the glass... I’m a Buddhist and I’m freaking out right now wondering if this is some sort of Beer-Dharma. 10/10.  S: Dusty chalk upfront, with roasted coffee bean, more chalk, notes of bitter herbal hops with hop resin notes and a hint of bitter cacao nibs. The aroma is heady and luscious, like some malevolent lover who will bring you to the peak of beer ecstasy only to abandon in their own nefarious plot like some pawn... only: you want to be a pawn to this brew. 10/10.  T: Finally! A cacao master to FBS’s Kona coffee awesomality... and yes I invented that word specifically to piss off OED. Where FBS rules the coffee Stout roost, Rasputin puts a dark chocolate boot in your throat and says “drink me bastard, you know you want to!” (and “yes” I do). There are some bold chocolate notes with a bitter herbal finish, much more bitter than FBS. That said there’s quite a bit of finesse and complexity with this Rasputin (although the original Rasputin was also quite bitter and complex as well). 9/10.  M: Mid to heavy bodied with a chewy, dense carbonation, close to Founders body but lacking that Overall Oatmeal Creaminess (that OOC). 8/10.  D: Like a big Stout blanket this brew coats your tongue and makes you feel that you have made an excellent choice in Stouts, like all great Stouts should do. Is it enough to de-perch FBS? The question burning on all the lips of the people who’ve tried FBS but not Rasputin... it is a great brew, almost worthy of de-throning FBS but it is missing a slight “Ce n'est pas la vache qui crie le plus fort qui donne le plus de lait.” (I secretly hope someone translates that). 8/10.  Food match: Hens eggs, the large ones. Also cigars, the smoky ones, would match well.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

It's an explosion of coffee and cocoa malts with a great hop presence that balances the sweet malt. It finishes with a mild bitterness of coffee and floral hops. Really complex flavors.

An oaky finish has a tinge of a tobacco taste, followed briefly by notes of espresso and dark chocolate. Truly an exceptional beer!

It looks like what it is - a beer that's not for the weak.  Aroma: Tons of dark, bitter chocolate and espresso in the nose with some noticeable floral hops. It has a complex yet subtle aroma that lingers in the nose. Some smoke, some burnt coffee beans, some very dark fruit.  Taste: Espresso leads the way with some hop grassiness and dark chocolate also right there. Finishes dry with a nice alcohol burn. That dark, unsweet chocolate taste lingers on the palate after the drink is gone. Smells and tastes linger in the memory, too.  Mouthfeel: For a big, deep, flavorful beer, it's surprisingly approachable in terms of heaviness. It's heavy, but it's not steak in a glass.  Overall: A stout to savor and enjoy.

Mouthfeel: Thick, covers the palate, great mouthfeel, not watery at all, but not too thick. Very dry on the palate. Lots of carbonation, tiny bubbles.  Overall: This beer is world class, fresh it has a lot of hops for an imperial stout, with some age, the hops reside and more of the roasted chocolate elements of the beer come forward.

112,412,The_Mad_Capper,4.85,"In the aroma is a great deal of bread crust and brown sugar, chocolate, mocha, and a touch of prune and citrus after a couple minutes. Pours a large, frothy, long-lasting, deep tan head; the body is jet black. The initial flavor is sweet, roasted, ashy malt, but a variety of intense flavors soon comes through. The overtones include alcohol, which is quite noticeable but well integrated for 9%, and a dark, fruity/molasses-like quality. There is also a rich, bread crust-like malt sweetness. The bitterness is more noticeable in the aftertaste, accompanied by a toasty, peanut shell-like maltiness. It is certainly full bodied, almost viscous, with just a little bite from the minimal carbonation and a little bit of husky astringency from the roasted malt.  Fantastically well structured and largely well balanced. Lots of intense flavors that work well together to produce an overall pleasurable drinking experience. It's certainly not a quaffing beer; this one is just right for sipping and savoring.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

All the hallmarks of not just a completely satisfying brew, but the extremes of flavor & kick (mere 9% list ABV notwithstanding) ass brew.

Poured with a light had that dissipated slowly with a beautiful tan color.  Scent - Chocolate and coffee. There's a slight metallic tinge, which goes against my memory.  Taste - Lots of chocolate, some coffee, a ton of heavily-roasted malt and a warming but masked amount of alcohol. The metallic off-flavor is a bit more present and somewhat troubling.  Mouthfeel - Crazy high gravity as expected. The bite from the carbonation slightly detracts from the flavor, but that seems to just be a personal preference.  Overall - This is exactly what I'd expect in a Russian imperial stout save for the coppery character, which seems like it might be a glassware problem or something.

112,412,Slamms,4.75,"The brothers say, ""not for the faint of heart"", but for this style, remarkably easy drinking, as all the wood, chocolate, coffee, etc is mitigated by an overall delicate refinement, belied by the chunky head clearly visible through the dark bottle. Really, the overriding aftertaste is something of fruit, though the bitterness is pronounced as well, the hops probably preserving the taste, as it tastes like it was bottled yesterday. But the bitterness as with everything is perfectly calibrated, not too much, not too little. So much more refined and unobtrusive, than say Guinness, but ironically more intense than Guinness (how does that work). Hard to fathom how something this perfectly calibrated originated in America.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Nostradrunkus,4.75,"The quintessential beginners stout, Old Rasputin manages to be an incredibly complex and refreshing drink while simultaneously disguising its high alcohol content.  This one pours a distinct blackness that reassures you that you are drinking a legitimate stout. There is a faint tan head that thins to a lacing on top of the beer within a short amount of time after the pour.  The aroma is complex, but is best categorized by a chocolatey espresso smell that serves as a great prelude to the flavor.  Taste is fantastic. I often find myself recommending this to those that think of guinness first when they hear the word stout. Upon drinking, you're immediately confronted with the chocolate and espresso flavors that dominate the aroma of this stout. This fades into a complex mix of flavor with a faint underlying soy sauce taste to round out the many other flavors at play. Alcohol is barely noticeable, but it contributes a subtle herbal heat that amplifies the other flavors.  I really believe this beer is one of the best hybrids of availability, cost, and flavor in the stout class. It tends to be easy to find, and it is also usually one of the cheaper options among the legitimate stouts. I often find myself reaching for a pack of Old Rasputin to pair with traditional meat and potatoes type meals, and I will continue to do so as long as they keep brewing this excellent Russian Imperial Stout.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Thick, thick almond colored cream like lacing and head that I can dip my finger into and lick like it's a rootbeer float. The lacing just sticks and the body is as black as night. Absolutely fantastic.  Smell (4.75) : Sweet black licorice, dark chocolate, roasted coffee bean. You can smell a hint of sour ale.  Taste (4.25) : Woof. What a strong beer this is! Roasted bean to start, a body of dark chocolate, and then morphing into total alcohol. 9% is right. I'll be falling out of my chair by the end of this review. It's got a good body and a good flavor, but the alcohol flavor is like chasing it with a shot of straight Russian Vodka.  Mouthfeel (4) : Creamy, heavy, soft, full-bodied. Minimal carbonation to keep it smooth. You can almost chew this beer.  Overall (4.44) : This beer is super heavy on the alcohol - again, like drinking a shot of vodka to chase your beer.

Top notch.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,KyleSweetsema,4.75,"This is one of my favorite beers overall, and probably my favorite by appearance. Poured into a nonic pint glass, giving me a deep midnight black color with a lovely, two finger, tan-colored head that lasted until the beer was about halfway gone. Had quite a prevalent espresso aroma and taste with some very light hints of hazelnut and licorice. Being a 9%, the alcohol was present in the taste, but definitely not overwhelming, giving it a pleasant, warming feel down the throat. Definitely a highly respectable, top-ranking beer.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,sheeley,4.89,"The appearance is the most memorable aspect of this beer for me. Especially on tap, it really exemplifies what I feel an imperial stout should look like. The body is black as night and the head is beautiful and creamy, with a tint of dark red/purple. That tint in the foam is one of the most telling signs for me. Loved this beer: dark, creamy, malty, and delicious. One of my top five beers currently. Highly recommended for any and all stout lovers.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,dar482,3.83,"The beer comes in a black color, but pours out dark brown. The head is fluffy and stays up leaving remnants on the side of the glass.  The aroma is licorice, lots of mocha with this milk chocolate and light roasted coffee. Roasted malt. Almost a peanut butter chocolate from toasted malt.  The beer has a medium light mouthfeel for the style. There's lots of dark fruit with dried dates and plum. Onto bittersweet chocolate and coffee grounds and espresso. With a combination of light bitterness and alcohol on the back.  Consistently disappointed by the light mouthfeel as it drinks like a 7% beer and lack of roasted malt flavor.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Wobbly,4.45,"One of the better examples of this style, Old Rasputin is one of the best price/quality beers around. While I have been underwhelmed by the rest of North Coast's offerings, this beer is truly excellent. Deep, dark colors and an appropriate bloom and lacing. Notes of chocolate, raisins, and prune are present but not overwhelming. Definite notes of iron, but pleasantly used. I have had it on tap and in the bottle several times. Gives KBS and Bourbon County a run for their money.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,SpicyMcHaggisBarber,4.54,New to the site. I've had this beer after competing in a strongman competition And I was very impressed with the results of buying this beer at a 4 pack For $12.

Good retention and lacing, low carbonation keeping it afloat  Smell is dark and thick, roast espresso and dark chocolate on the front. Lighter notes of fig and other dark fruits along with licorice and molasses. Finishes with a touch of alcohol  Taste follows well with the nose. Upfront chocolate and coffee malts, followed by fig and a bit of cherry. Licorice and toffee are subtle but present.

Not over poweringly anything but delicious beer.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,TheFizzinator,4.47,"Pours a beautiful dark black with brown highlights. Hefty head of mocha chocolate color, can't wait to drink it. The smell is of a heavy roast from the malt, a touch of chocolate, some dark fruits, and a bit of char. You get all this chocolate, the heavy roast switches to blackened charred and smoked meats, raisins, and ends with a sweet wash almost like maple syrup or brown sugar. Great super medium mouthfeel. Letting it just lay on your palate giving off the flavors and your ready to drink.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,SitkaSteve,4.75,"I poured this into a pint glass. The appearance was a jet black color with a thin half finger of off white to slight tan foamy head. There was a gentle spider web lacing sticking but ending up sliding a bit into the beer. The smell had some nice roasty to sweet chocolates with a decent amount of light roasty coffee. The taste was mainly sweet with a nice roasty chocolate quality to it. There is also a nice long dry chocolate aftertaste with a very satisfying sweet finish. The mouthfeel seems to be fairly creamy and sweet.

112,412,thomda11,4.52,"Heard a lot of good things about this beer, and it did not disappoint. The appearance is near-perfect. The beer is night-black with an off-white head of about two-finger widths. It leaves a nice lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma is robust, full of chocolate and roasted barely. The taste is equally robust. At first sip, the overwhelming taste was of dark chocolate, but as I drank it, roasted coffee came to the forefront. There is just a hint of alcohol, but nothing that would suggest the 9% abv. There was also a certain sweetness that I lingered on the tongue along with a mild hop bitterness. The mouthfeel was rich and creamy with a modest carbonation. Overall, this beer is outstanding on every level.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,popopine,4.74,Holy coffee-chocolate-licorice-flavor mother of god -- this one is big indeed. Nice deep black color. Medium head.

112,412,REGreenBTRB,4.47,"My first review!  Appearance: Pitch black with a two and a half finger, super creamy head. It leaves a nice lacing around the glass (pint - though I do prefer beers like this in a snifter or tulip).  Smell: I get a strong presence of dark chocolate, coffee, and a lot of smoky malt. Smells absolutely wonderful!  Taste: As with the smell, a LOT of dark chocolate flavor, malt. For being a 9% beer I only pick up on the alcohol slightly. I'm not picking up as much coffee as I did when I put a nose on it. The chocolate is just so prevalent, and that's awesome.  Mouthfeel: Heavy with some carbonation.  Overall: As a mega stout fan, this is one of my favorites thus far. A wonderful stout, and it's easily available year-round, even in Arkansas :). It's kind of like Young's on steroids. The chocolate is by far the most present though not overpowering. It's a wonderful beer. This is definitely something I'll be keeping in my fridge.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,enjambed,4.42,"My first review!  Served slightly chilled from bottle into stem glass.  appearance: Being a stout, you're not going to see anything surprising here, but it still looks very appetizing, like a fresh espresso. Black as night, a moderate pour produces an average sized, bubbly khaki/light brown head that settles down to a layer of foam.  smell: Roasted malts, coffee, maybe a bit of alcohol, very nice  taste: Chocolate, black licorice, and (my favorite) dark fruits or raisins come through here along with the coffee, ending with some good warmth from the alcohol. I gotta have some of this in the winter! It's a big stout for sure, but I don't find the flavor overpowering.  mouthfeel: Not as thick as I was expecting, more on the medium side, but it doesn't get in the way  overall: Old Rasputin is a nice, big imperial stout. I usually don't drink beers this big, and was surprised by how long it took to finish a bottle. The flavors are well balanced and it's not gonna wreck your palate, but having two in a short time period will definitely knock you off your donkey. Not exactly a beer you'd have at a party, but it's good sipping during a movie or reading a book (it will take half the movie to finish).",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,dipso123,4.5,Update:  Originally gave this a 4.25. Had recently with friends head-to-head with Founder Breakfast Stout and all preferred Rasputin.

112,412,tillmac62,4.2,"Pours pitch black with a magnificent head. Lacing and retention are also outstanding. The nose is sweet dark chocolate, roast and hints of dark fruit and smoke. Almost full bodied with a very smooth, almost creamy, texture. Borderline normal carbonation level with just a touch of effervescence on the finish. The flavor profile is well balanced and a bit complex, but not as complex as FIS or Wulver. It begins with sweet dark chocolate which flows into a roast and hop bitterness. The middle has a molasses note. The finish is smooth and leaves you with an alcoholic burn at the back of the throat that lingers quite long. Less hops would allow the dark fruit flavor to materialize and add to complexity.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Smell - Heavy, roasty,chocolaty, and slightly smoky aroma  Taste - The thick, dark, chocolaty malt dominates the begininning of the taste and smoothy gives way to a slight bitter tinge of hops at the end of the taste. A very well balanced flavor, and drinkable. A well crafted beer and example of what a stout should be.

A little booze comes out at is warms.  T: Deep dark chocolate and coffee, perfect amount of bitterness to balance the sweetness. Delicious!  M: Body more on the heavy side, but smooth and creamy.

112,412,B33randen,4.47,"In my opinion, this is the defining beer for its style: the imperial stout. This is not to say that this is the smoothest stout out there - forget drinking it anything other than COLD. I have never had the privilege of having this on tap, but for me this rivals some of the best stouts in the game.  A lot of beer drinkers condemn stouts for their usual strong presence of a coffee flavor, and while this does not have a strong coffee flavor, its ""stout"" flavor is omnipresent. It certainly has the creaminess of a stout, but I would say the mouthfeel is not as delightfully smooth as most stouts (I am unfairly comparing it to my last stout, deschutes obsidian on nitro), but this must certainly be because of the abv this bad boy packs.  Wouldn't recommend this for the faint, Wouldn't recommend this for the anti-coffee type,  If you're not in either of these categories, trying this is a must",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Balanced, delicious, hides the percent of alcohol well. Licorice. Bitterness at the end.  M: Thick, molasses like body, medium carbonation.  O: Beatifully balanced and delicious. Sweet, bitter, smooth chocolate like, coffee like, somewhat creamy. My second Russian Imperial Stout, and reminds me that I really like this style and want to try more. I will give it 10 out of 10.

112,412,archyquaffer,3.68,"Poured from a 12 ounce stubby into a shaker. I tried a moderate pour but backed off some, and ended up with about 2 inches of billowing, chunky, light brown head, which sticks around for the duration. The color is a very dark brown- a mini maglite bulb can barely be seen through the glass, but this little red star reveals a deep ruddiness.  My poor olfactory glands perceive some coffee and unsweetened chocolate aromas. These continue to manifest themselves in the flavor, along with hints of caramel. The flavor is quite bitter, and, combined with just a little bit of alcohol warming, takes a bit of getting accustomed to. There's maybe even some slight un-roasted acorn quality to it- a good bit of astringency, that is, particularly at first. However, I find that more cherry, oak and other dark fruit flavors come through as it warms, and the chocolate begins to balance out the coffee-like bitterness a bit more. The ABV is relatively well-hidden but with some definite alcohol warming. I perceive some hints of maltomeal like flavors in the burps, despite all expectations. The mouth feel is fairly creamy, but not abundantly so, and is perhaps helped along by the lingering head.  I have not tried very many examples of this type of stout because it has just not been generally available in my area. It would definitely not be my first choice in terms of a stout- I think I prefer the sweeter types. It's definitely a big beer, not meant to be guzzled down, and with some bitterness that may be overwhelming at first. I can certainly imagine some 19th century imperial Russkis quaffing this stuff down though...",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

The nose is dominated by dark roasted malts and hops. Flavors of licorice, burnt toast, charcoal, and booze.  T. The palette certainly goes along with the nose. The flavors are dominated by roasted near burning malts. The major notes are licorice, biscuits, grain, hops, and more licorice.  M. Very smooth and silky. High carbonation. Full body.  O. Very nice. I can see how this established itself as an old school staple stout. The major setback is the roasted to the point of burnt presence in the nose and palate.

Just seeing old Gregori Rasputin, the sinister monk who captivated Czarina Alexandra, staring at you from the label with his hypnotic eyes is worth picking up a bottle.  It is deep dark in color, much like the eyes of the aforementioned monk, capped by a frothy beige foam. There is a mild nose of chocolate and toast in the nose; the palate is tickled with dark chocolate motes and a wispy hop finish.  The balance is excellent; the finish is clean and filling.

When the ol'nostrils get involved, you are smelling some stout standards: chocolate, a lil coffee, a lil sweet malty.  After all this foreplay, and you finally take a sip, just creamy malt chocolate coffee working as a team. Well Balanced. The flavors take over your mouth, but not overwhelmingly.

My first experience with Imperial Stout was not a pleasant one. It was harsh and bitter. I shied away from such things until I discovered Old Rasputin. It's not harsh at all. I fills the pallet with all the flavors and notes I enjoy. It's not a beginners beer by any means. You have to really love the fullness and complexity that comes with such brews.

This one pours a deep near black mahogany with a large and thick tan head that gives way to a nice film and substantial lacing. The nose is lighter than expected with the expected notes of coffee, dark chocolate, vanilla, and dark caramel. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy but lighter than the pour and nose make one expect. It is medium bodied and coats the mouth in a most enjoyable and satisfying way without being thick and sticky. The flavor is a wonderful blend of dark cacao, roasted coffee, and sweet caramely malts. This is a damn well crafted beer and it is very understandable why it is one of the benchmarks of the style.

112,412,ThePaintedGrey,4.26,"12oz. bottle poured into imperial pint glass. - drinking this one at about 55 - 60 degrees. No refrigeration here.  A: A very deep mahogany hue that's nearly black, but some blood red highlights shine through during the iPhone flashlight test. A dense, rocky, YooHoo colored head is ENORMOUS even without an aggressive pour. Takes ages to settle down to a 3/4"" head that remains for nearly the entirety of the experience. Impressive splotches of dark beige lacing left behind. The most impressive part of Old Rasputin's aesthetics, however, was probably the cascading effect during the pour. A delight to watch the nearly-black liquid manifest itself.  S: Chocolate domination here, very reminiscent to the 70% cacao chocolate bar I had earlier, actually. Some roasted malts and medium-roast coffee come through, but never make it out of the backseat due to the chocolately reign. A little bit of raw anise seed as well.  T: The initial flavor here reminds me a lot of one of my personal favorite beverages: dark roast coffee, served black with a square of 80% cacao chocolate dropped in and dissolved. Awfully specific I know, but I know what I taste. The bitterness of that combination is quickly balanced by some sweet and slightly roasted malts to give this one an overall rich, dessert-like profile. Hops aren't usually something I look for in stouts and they're usually something I could go without in stouts, but Old Rasputin has some piney spice peering through in the finish, atop of some warm, peppery booze. After taste is bitter black coffee, slightly smoky, and a hint of tobacco.  M: Full-bodied, subdued carbonation, wonderfully creamy texture. Not quite as chewy as I hoped for, but absolutely no disappointment here overall. Alcohol is definitely apparently though; not shrouded as well as others.  O: It's easy to see why Old Rasputin is a fan-favorite amongst its style. It provides a perfectly accessible flavor profile with a textbook mouthfeel. Truly a wonderful brew that I'm sure will be revisited again and most definitely recommended to others.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,iheartmyTHO,3.75,"Overall, not one of my favorite stouts. I guess it's because I prefer my stouts to have more of a chocolate or coffee taste to them. The Old Rasputin Stout reminded me more of a stout mixed with a nice Belgian Ale. It's still tasty, and the high alcohol content will give you a nice buzz.

Big chocolate and sweet coffee in the smell, roasted malts, alcohol (coffee-liquorish, actually), lower dark fruit. A fruity flash at the start, with juicy plums and figs, raisin, some orange, quickly pushed away by espresso, dark chocolate, slight caramel and rich, very rich roasted malts. Dark spices, citrus peel, woody notes with some oaky vanilla. Obvious hops in the finish, but the bitterness comes from the burnt roast.

Very complex and amazing smells  T - Roasted malts upfront with a chocolate coffee taste on the end with caramel sweetness. So goood. The finishing taste changes to me. I get vanilla one sip, caramel the other, malt and coffee the other  M - thick silky creamy feel very heavy. This Stout is very bubbly.  O - this imperial Stout is a sipper and is very good.

112,412,PsilohsaiBiN,4.33,"No bottled on date, so I'm assuming this is either late '13 or early '14, but I could be wrong.  Appearance: Pours Shaq black with a nice, bubbly finger of khaki head.  Smell: Sweet roast with some hops for balance, dark chocolate, dark fruit, graham cracker. Really good.  Taste: Semi-sweet roast over dark chocolate begins the drink. The middle shows a bit of hop bite, followed by a nice muted iteration of the beginning, that fades out with a mild graham cracker element in the finish. There is a bit of heat at the end, but it belies the actual abv. This drinks nice and smooth.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied, but of course not in the realm of BCBS or Huna...it's still thick enough to be hearty but nothing viscous that you're struggling to choke down.  Overall: A classic for a reason, easy drinking for a higher abv and tastes good. Would drink again.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,MikeyBadnews,4.12,"Not a huge Stout, let alone Imperial stout guy but decided why not celebrate this Irish holiday with an Irish beer named after a Russian, made in America. Melting pot my friends... Pretty solid beer, makes you work though and the alcohol is pretty poignant.  Pours like a liquid abyss , inescapable darkness with an chocolate-espresso foam head that poured a rich 3 fingers thick.  Smells of strong alcohol, with varying notes of burnt coffee, prune and dirty roadside puddle, solid but imperfect as the alcohol burn wipes out some of the more refined and subdued scents.  The taste offers no alcohol burn as its resigned to the back of the throat and not the tongue and doesn't interfere with the mouth feel. Creamy chocolate covered fruit flavor meshed with coffee grinds that doesn't go down overly easy but doesn't kick your ass either.  Not bad, not bad at all... I'm a legitimate fan and wish I had this beer to kick back with after a night of shoveling over the winter. Really warms and comforts you, a dark blanket that isn't for session drinking, but good for one or two on a frosty night.

112,412,Oakengroves,4.79,"Appearance - A dark, foreboding back with an off-color, dull head.  Smell - A deep, earthy roasted malt scent. Very appetizing.  Taste - An outstanding dark, earthy flavor interrupted occasionally by a mixture of grain and chocolate. Delightful!  Mouthfeel - Full bodied with a perfect amount of carbonation.  Drinkability - One of the most drinkable Imperial stouts on the market.  Overall - The gold standard for imperial stouts, and very, very difficult to beat for the price.  Serving type: bottle",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,MV_CHI-NS,4.45,"Appearance: Licorice with a vanilla/beige head.  Aroma: Bold notes of roasted coffee and malt, with not-too-subtle hints of dark chocolate.  Flavor: Much like the aroma, but stronger; deep-roasted with a subtle (strange, because there was a stronger presence in the aroma) dark chocolate aftertaste which slowly changes to hints of dark smoked grains. In truth, I was not expecting it to dissipate so quickly - the aftertaste of dark smoked grains quickly became somewhat...'off'; I was hoping for the chocolate/malt notes to really come forward after letting it rest on my palate, but instead, it became somewhat bitter - not what I would expect from any Imperial Stout.  Mouthfeel: Fairly moderate carbonation - smooth, full-bodied, but somewhat dry after a while.  Overall: This was my first from North Coast Brewing, and a good choice to get my 'foot in the door'. To any die-hard fans of Imperial Stouts: make this a staple in your collection. Personally, I may need to revisit this one after a while because while it is good, I was not entirely impressed - particularly in terms of flavor/mouthfeel.

A deep, dark, rich black with a thick, tan-colored head. If they were looking for the most photogenic beer of the night, this was the one. As volume decreased, lacing very apparent.  The smell...Roasty is the first word that came to mind. Darkened maltiness with a definite coffee overtone. Some chocolate in there too.  The taste...Fantastic! Starting with roasty malty goodness along with some dark chocolate notes, and finishing with the coffee near the end. Full-bodied, but not too carbonated. Once it warmed up a bit, almost got a bit of a dark fruit aroma and taste too. Creamy, full, and an excellent winter warmer. The 9% abv was very well hidden. This was a meal in itself.  I have had some other RIS, but this one really stands out. Everything about it was just splendid.

The taste was like heaven; sweet at the front, bittersweet in the backend; balanced. Black brown sugared chocolate; grassy and woody; a little smoky. Perhaps a little piney and resinous. Roasted barley malt; burnt sugar; burnt malt. Burnt caramel; burnt brown sugar. A slight, yet pleasant, bitter taste lingers throughout consumption. There was even some brown crusty bread.

A: probably thanks to the nitro in part, this beer almost epitomized what I expect a stout to look like. Dark brown-to-black with great head, tan in color and sustaining, with decent lacing S: I am missing what I expect, instead of roastiness, I am getting a wet cardboard, but it's not very strong T: smooth, as I expect a nitro. Roasted malt has cocoa taste to begin, with some light bitterness turning it towards coffee, kinda like mocha. M: there is a coating mild bitterness, not strong but pretty on point to me. O: I probably have to try the regular bottle or tap to see for certain. Given some of the Imperial Stouts I've had, this is missing some bite. However, in my experience one can question how the nitro affected it. That said, I could probably get in trouble drinking a few of these down quickly and smoothly.

Dark brown pour with a light mocha frothy head with good retention and excellent lacing. Very nice in the glass.  This is aromatic even though my nose is stuffed up. Extremely roasty with strong notes of baker's chocolate. Spent coffee grains are present but more subtle. Not very hoppy.  Taste is roasty and burnt, smoky, morseso than most imperial stouts, bordering on rauchbier level of smokiness. Some bitter hops and cacao. Halfway-burnt cigar ash. Almost no alcohol, remarkable.  Mouthfeel is medium with a smooth body, medium carbonation, and a sticky finish, but could really use more oomph behind it. Could be fuller and creamier. Not off-putting but holds the brew up.  Overall this is renowned for it's great price point and year-round availability. Definitely the best RIS that is year-round, present everywhere, and $10/4pack.

S - First smell i get is this raspberry jam kind of smell followed by the roasted malt and a whole lot of chocolate. Also a strong alcohol presence cuts through. Maybe a little burnt toast in there as well. But i burned toast in my house about an hour ago so it might be coming from that.  T - Right away i get the awesome roasted malt flavor followed up by heavy amounts of dark chocolate. I also get some fig and date flavors when i take a nice big sip. A bit of coffee bitterness on the finish with an alcohol heat that creeps up the throat. Mmmm!  M - Nice and creamy texture with a good amount of carbonation. Coats the mouth well but doesn't feel syrupy. I prefer a little less carbonation in my darker beers otherwise it is great.  O - Delicious as always. I love the strong bitterness i get from the coffee and dark chocolate and the mild alcohol warmth that comes on at the end. It isn't too intense, but just right. One of my favorite RIS. I get it every year around my birthday to cellar so i can do a nice vertical on my bday. This beer is both delicious fresh, and aged for a couple years.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,glass_house,4.53,"12 oz. bottle poured into a snifter.  Rasputin greets me from the label with his trademark piercing gaze. He fills my vessel with a liquid black pearl through which the most determined light shall not pass. It actually appears that light particles are being pulled in, perhaps through a wormhole to another dimension. One finger of tight khaki head recedes to a persistent ring of vigilant foam.  Roasted espresso beans and burnt cocoa meet dark fruits and faint molasses in the nose. The initial feel on the tongue is silky smooth, morphing first into a crisp carbonated zing, then a bittersweet dark chocolate bite. French roast coffee and dark dark chocolate dominate the flavor, while smoky caramel malt and grassy hops dance in the background. As the nectar warms, a slight alcohol heat comes through on the finish.  Overall, this is simply one of the finest [non barrel-aged] stouts I've ever had. There is never a dull moment spent with Rasputin. The aroma, texture, and flavors converge to provide an experience that never disappoints.

112,412,Andrew041180,4.46,"A - Poured jet black, with a taller-than-expected, rich, creamy tan head. The head recedes slowly, and leaves spotty lacing on the glass. Attractive film hovers above the beer for the duration of the beer. Nice, but difficult to differentiate appearance in this style.  S - Very nice potency. I can smell it without jamming my entire face into the glass. Roasty malt. Dark chocolate.  T - Follows the nose. The tastes are clean readily discernible. Clean coffee, milk chocolate. Just a subtle sweetness, and no burnt notes. Just a bit of alcohol on the finish. Normally I don't like this, but it works well here.  M - I suppose it's possible for a beer to feel better, but I'm not going to split hairs here. Full-bodied. Luxurious. Goes down like silk, yet with just a hint of supporting carbonation. Love this.  O - Another eye-opening imperial stout. My second this week. At one time I held off on this beer due to 4-pack quantity and perceived high price. Those reasons have since been swept away. Truly a delicious beer.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Most of the darker beers I've tried had very intense flavors of dark fruits and overpowering aromas, so I was surprised that this one wasn't so strong at first.

S- I get raisins, char, coffee, chocolate and booze. Sometimes I get something sweetly spicy as well. Subtleties seem to change each time. Smell is on the lighter side when cold, but strengthens as it warms. Surprising how sweet it is. Reminds me of tropical hops at times.  T- Man, there's a lot going on... As it sits on the tongue, I get a strangely sweet, tropical like flavor. Immediately as you swallow, the sweetness is replaced by a hoppy spiciness, dark fruit, coffee, and roasted malt. The finish has notes of dark chocolate, dark fruits, char, pine, and licorice. Aftertaste reminds me of earthy hops meets dark chocolate. And if I drank it again tomorrow, it would probably be different. Incredibly complex.  M- Medium body. Slick on the tongue and very drying. Crisp carbonation.  O- This is an amazing beer! It is supremely complex and exceptionally balanced. Each smell and taste is a touch different than the last. I'm so overwhelmed by details, I'm having problems finding words. One thing I can say is that I tried this when I first got into craft and didn't dig it at all.

Light carbonation and light alcohol taste. Very smooth, with good balance of flavors. Coffee and bitter aftertaste.  M - Very very thick and heavy. Not much carbonation or alcohol taste, especially for a 9%.  O - Best stout I have had. I like the initial sweetness, and the smell was very delicious when I first poured, and, with the thick head, it made my mouth water.

Aroma is subdued, mostly malt sweetness, as it warms some roast, chocolate, coffee and toast.  Taste is exceptional: clean malt balance between the pale malts, roast, chocolate and coffee flavors; hops are earthy, fresh, not overpowering in flavor but provide the bitterness to compensate the sweetness. Hardly any alcohol presence.

112,412,Roguer,3.96,"Motor-oil black brew with an enormous dark brown head, with very impressive retention and very nice lacing. Can't imagine a stout looking any better.  Aroma is a little puzzling: some grape-like booziness, with dark malts behind, a little like a burnt brownie.  Sharp and bitter bite to the flavor, initially heavy on barley flakes and a sharp booziness following the nose. Strong notes of burnt coffee and dark cacao on the back-end.  Full-bodied and complex, but a hair thinner than I expected.  A standard among stouts, Old Raspy doesn't disappoint. It's not thick and rich and chocolatey like some of the in vogue stouts, and it doesn't have a bourbon bite. That said, it embodies the basics of what a solid stout should: dark malty character, burnt coffee bite. I look forward to having the rest of the pack with some age on them.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,1sophrosyne1,4.17,"Enjoyed over 25 minutes from a tulip glass.  It pours a reflective black core with cordovan edges that warm the ring that remains after the cap has fallen. Bubbly, light tan head with very leggy, patchy lacing.  The nose is full of roasted coffee and malt. It's chocolatey and a touch flinty, too. Hints of toffee and currant are present. Clean, fresh, and cool…there's a suggestion of the hops you anticipate to come out later.  The start is malted caramel, followed closely by acidic, light roast coffee. Those standard flavors then sit back for a bit and allow earthen sweetness to come in with a touch of currants and prunes. Then it's balanced by bitterness and salicylate that folds into coffee again with a finish and aftertaste of heavily roasted almonds, black walnuts, and Brazil nuts all so thick you can nearly crunch them.  The body is full and carbonation about mid-level. It spreads in the mouth fast and flat with a metallic essence enhanced by the wintergreen. Bubbles are more apparent on the tongue after it starts creamy. The dance it does all over the mouth is my favorite element.  Since this RIS seems a touch one-dimensional to me--essentially a roasted mixed nut iced coffee, I'm happy to drink it as or with dessert in cooler months. But, despite the reputation, I don't think this particular brew stands alone as a superior representative of the style. It's very good, but doesn't make my day.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Aroma: roasted malt, cocoa, black pepper, slight alcohol, touch of espresso, ever so slight 100% cacao chocolate. No burnt malt aroma.  Taste: Roasty, espresso, cococa, touch of guinness character. Midway, some alcohol bite although not too much.  Final results: Definitely one of my favorite imperial stouts. I love how it does not have a burnt flavor and instead the malt has a ""grilled"" like character. the coffee and chocolate work beautifully although the roastiness is the star. Definitely would drink again but too many beers out there that I need to try. Not hoppy but just enough hops so that there isn't too much sweetness.

Looks like crude oil.  S: Roasted malt, chocolate, bitter coffee. A remote sweetness lurks somewhere in this layered aroma.  T: Initial malt flavor, maybe some caramel, coffee bean bitterness but well balanced. Might be some toffee. Has a transient sweetness possibly from some dark fruits, prunes? The hoppiness presents itself when allowed to mature on the tongue a bit.  M: Not as thick as I expected, very light carbonation. Not very dry, smooth with little after taste. A creamier character arrives as it approaches room temperature.  O: After engaging in some debauchery with old Rasputin, I can say I’m up for round two. This is an excellent stout for wintertime drinkin’. This was recommended to me by a rando in my local beer distributor, and I’m glad I took him up on it.

Feel- On the thinner side for a imperial stout and a bit too creamy of a texture.  Overall- A very good imperial stout, but not quite as full bodied and full flavored as some other imperial stouts.

Smell is milk chocolate, dark fruit, roasted barley, vanilla, toast, cocoa, a sort of fruity smell, maybe yeasty.

This is one of my favorite imperial stouts as it has all the flavors I've come to love from big beers and also a complex roasty profile that tickles my fancy. It's sort of like narwhal but its just a tad better to me.  Mouthfeel is perfect and feels just right for this beer. It's superb with medium carbonation and a thick feel that gives it just the right amount of viscosity to blend well with the flavors and alcohol level. 9% fits just right as its not quite a session beer but it allows you to have a few in one sitting and feel alright.

He came back with my growler telling me it was Old Rasputin. Apparently being a a Russian Imperial Stout to my dismay. I was SOOOO wrong. This beer was so complex. It had a wonderfully aromatic head, leaving a fine dotted lacing along the sides of my glass. The taste was dark espresso, milk chocolate, and almost burnt tasting malt. By burnt i mean a smokey taste. I found myself entranced by the the beer settling back through the head after a sip. You could watch the almost black liquid fall through the caramel head making fine swirls. Being 9% ABV was defiantly a plus as well. I don't like a beer unless it knocks me on my ass.

A: Beautiful dark motor oil black with a small creamy brown head  S: Malt, chocolate, oats, dark fruits, alcohol  T: This stuff is almost perfect. Creamy and smooth chocolate on the front and finishes with some bitterness and a hint of the alcohol.  M: I don't know if it's because it was from a growler but very little carbonation.

112,412,BeerWizard,4.17,"Not normally a stout drinker but had to check this out because of all the hype. The four packs are reasonably priced at about $8, and sport attractive black and gold packaging.  Poured into a goblet, opaque black, with a chocolate colored short head that reduces after several minutes into a thin tan film of minute bubbles. This beer is not see through at all in this glass, and only around the very edges does light start to penetrate.  Chocolate coffee aroma with hops, also jammy fruit, malty. Flavor is impactful, dark candied fruit, berry, hop bitters, choco-coffee, light mint, very much agreeing with the nose. The mouthfeel is heavy but tighter than something like a wee heavy, and not as sweet. Definitely boozy at 9%, but not setting your mouth on fire. Carbonation is low but present.  Overall, fantastic. Totally lives up to the hype.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

A- Pours a fully opaque black color with a full inch of frothy light brown head that retains very well before slowly melting away to a thick ring around the edge of the glass and a large bump of surface foam. Wisps of lacing stick to the glass.  S- Rich roasty cocoa aroma with notes of vanilla, coffee and even black cherry.  T- I always forget how sweet this beer is. The black cherry continues on with the flavor and mingles with the dark roast creating a chocolate-covered cherry type of effect. There are also notes of anise and more vanilla in the finish. Moderate hop bitterness.  M- Thick and somewhat creamy with medium carbonation and a full body.  O- A classic version of the style. While I prefer it on nitro-pour if having it on-tap, it's just fine with CO2.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Some alcohol but hidden way backstage on this one.  taste is espresso-like in bitterness up front and follows up with semi-sweet chocolate mixed in with dark dried fruit like the prunes picked up in the aroma. Smooths out as it warms and the upfront bitterness backs off.  Not overly carbonated but more so than I was expecting. Pretty new to stouts so not sure what the goal is here. For me, it work here. Thickens as it warms and leaves stickiness on my lips.  Like I said, pretty new to stouts. I like this beer especially on a day like today, raw and cold.

Not a single ray of light is getting through this beer. About 1 finger of light, brown creamy head. Not enough head to really leave much lacing. Very appealing  Smell: Primary smell is a heavy maltiness, with a raisin-like sweetness. Typical roasted cocoa and coffee bean flavours are there, but fruits and malts have become stronger over 4+ years. Slight ethanol warmth is present, with a slight bit of phenol.  Taste: Lots of roasted body, from the first taste through after you've swallowed it. Very coffee heavy but without the bitterness. A faint malty sweetness, mixing with the dark cocoa flavour. Very little bitterness at first, but hits you later. More and more butterscotch-y diacetyl as you go.  Mouthfeel: Thick and viscous. Lots of booziness, almost over the top after a while. Tenacious aftertaste. Nice and creamy.  Overall: Very good, always enjoy these, but the time definitely changed this beer. Whisky-like characteristics are emphasized a lot more, and the roasted malt notes have been subdued in favour of a powerful boozy bitterness.

112,412,-MK-,5,"Looking at this beer, for what it is (an imperial stout) - I have had no better example of the type. The alcohol is noticable, and gives quite the kick to the balls on the initial sip- but the flavor of it is rounded out with complexity, showing malts (perfectly balanced in the beer), spices, and chocolate. The flavor is SO complex and dense I am at a loss for descriptions trying to do it justice. Add to this the silky, creamy goodness that makes you want to keep sipping. The creaminess on this beer is so remarkable, that I can't think of anything I have ever had that compares. The only detraction might be that its heavy in notcing the alcohol in the flavor- but its an imperial stout, so this beer ends up being everything it should be.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

T- Roast coffee, coffee acidity, light dark fruits, dark chocolate, and slight alcohol. A medium level of sweetness. Leaves a nice coffee acidity on the tongue.  M- A light-heavy mouthfeel for an imperial stout. A bit easier to drink than others I've had of this style.  O- A great lighter RIS.

S - Toffe, burnt caramel, dark roasted coffee beans, the smell of a wheat field right before harvest.  T - Surprising taste of citrus on the first sip, which is not that present on subsequent sips. Wonderful dried wheat notes with a mild alcohol finish. Definitely not a sweet beer, but well balanced with some slight bitterness toward the end.  M - Strong carbonation on the tip of the tongue quickly turns into a creamy feel. On the more viscous side, but certainly not as thick as some in the same genre.  O - I wanted a rich, complex beer for this mid-November evening and this did the trick.

112,412,JohnRyanJosey,5,"It's getting colder, so that means I have to review a beer with a lot of alcohol that really warms you up. My second favorite beer of all time, just barely behind Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale. This bad boy is HUGE. If you don't like your beers strong, you will absolutely hate this. On the other hand, if you like stouts, you have to give this thing a try. It's won FOURTEEN GOLD MEDALS in world beer festivals. It's as good as stouts get.  Appearance: 5 This baby is jet-black. A little red at the edges where just the faintest bit of light gets through, but that's it. A cocoa-brown head that dissipated quickly in my stein, but left nice lacing.  Smell: 5 Big alcohol smell, but also toasty coffee and roasted malts. Hits you in the face hard, so be prepared.  Taste: 5 Holy crap. Alcohol warming, but burnt coffee (in a good way) and strong chocolate. The aftertaste is strong dark chocolate and a very warming finish.  Mouthfeel: 5 thick, rich, and tongue-coating  Overall: 5 This is simply indescribable. There are too many strong flavors combining and re-combining for me to adequately describe them here. I just put short snippets of what I could, but it's simply the best stout there is. A drink that must be savored, slowly letting your mind wander to wherever the flavors take you. It's incredible.

Aroma is smoked wood, roasted coffee, vanilla, chocolate, burnt sugar--and maybe I'm just fantasizing here, in a Rasputin trance, but I pick up a faint, savory aroma that reminds me of bacon in the oven. Thick and syrupy with an acidic bite at the end that whispers ""sip some more, sip some more!"" Smokey, sweet, burnt, complex, chocolate, wood, hints of spice even (nutmeg & cinnamon).

112,412,williamsgodfrey,4.09,"Appearance: Old Rasputin came out of the bottle a dark brown, nearly black, color. There was a half a finger’s worth of head, roughly the color of overly creamed coffee. The head stayed around briefly but fizzled off shortly, becoming a thin ring at the edges of the glass with an island or two of small bubbles floating around on the top of the beer. I think (I know) that I had the beer too cold when I poured it and I think that is why the head was so small. Russian Imperials should best be poured and consumed in the 50-55° F range. When I’ve enjoyed Old Rasputin in the past, at a more reasonable temperature, I remember a much more robust head that stuck around more. As I began to drink I noticed that the beer actually appeared almost red at the edges. When beer spread out on the way out of the glass with each sip I noticed a deep red or crimson to it, quite nice.  Aroma: I got a big, dark, roasty, bready aroma out of my glass. Perhaps a bit of hop spiciness on the back-end. As it warmed up a bit I began to notice a lot of tobacco flavors, really near to that earthy sweetness of freshly dried and cut tobacco leaves.  Taste: This beer truly tastes wonderful. I get a lot of hop up front, not quite as sharp as a big IPA, followed by dark, roasted malt, a little boozy heat, something akin to sugar just as it starts to caramelize/burn, and finally a finish of alcohol soak chocolate covered raisins.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel felt pretty spot on for a Russian Imperial, it was smooth with a faint carbonation tickle with a slight amount of body.  Overall: It’s a classic and it's awesome. One of the best Russian Imperials out there, and maybe one of the first to receive widespread acclaim and distribution in the North American beer market.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Warm alcohol, and bourbon in the finish as the stout warmed.  I wanted something to chew on tonight, and got it with this fine malt.

A very thick and mocha colored head (about 3 fingers deep) sat on top of a pitch dark body... the darkest of browns, hell, this was black. The head lingered around for a good amount of time. Lacing eventually formed on the sides of the glass but a fluffy puff of head remained in the center of the beer throughout the majority of this experience.  Very toasty malts dominate the nose. A woody liquor smell (somewhere between whiskey and brandy) is present as well.  Full flavor. Goes down smooth and creamy. Leaves a slightly bitter finish. The aftertaste reminded me of an iced mocha.  Overall: Incredible amount of flavor. Very filling, you could have one of these in place of desert. This was fairly pricey in my market but I thought it was well worth it. This tastes better when there is snow on the ground but that is not always a reality for everyone... you get the idea though.

Especially as it makes me drink more of it to write this review. I'd agree with the ""dry"" finish that others have mentioned.  Overall: Yeah, I think I'll be adding this to my ""standards."" Get some of this cellared and see what happens. Based on what I've read from others who cellared, it should age very nicely. I'm excited.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Qbdoo,4.09,Just an amazing beer- especially considering the price ($8.99 where I am) and year-round availability. Black as Rasputin's heart with a lovely tan head. Foamier than most RIS. No strong scent - just mild hints of caramel and coffee. These two flavors are distinct in the taste though. Serve this puppy pretty warm - cold it tastes boozy but at 50-55 degrees that goes away and the beer is silky smooth. I do like a few other RIS's more but this is the best year-round version. A true classic.,North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,scotorum,4.65,"Bought two months ago. Had a tiny sample at the North Coast booth at the Green River Brewfest in Greenfield Mass. in June, and was not impressed. Seemed too harsh. But I bought a bottle to give it a full chance.  Poured into a Samuel Smith English tulip from the 12 oz. bottle.  a: Black with a huge brown head which dissipated slowly to heavy surface foam and extensive lacing.  s: Dark malt  t: Slips right past your lips and then hits the palate with dark ashy caramel malt and bitter hops. High ABV is not evident at first until you realize it's there under the prominent malt cover. Surprisingly dry finish for such a strong stout.  m: Slick and smooth. Lighter than might be expected from the color.  o: Outstanding stout. Sexy mouthfeel, powerful dark malt/hop balance. Probably way better than anything the real Rasputin ever put in his gullet. Would certainly buy a fourpack whenever a good chance arises. : UPDATE 3/27/14: As part of my ongoing re-review of my top rated brews, I have another bottle here to check out.  a: same as before, requiring additional pours since I was using a Victory Donnybrook Stout 12 ounce English nonick this time with no extra room for the huge and stubborn tan foam head.  s: The aroma is glorious, strong chocolate and coffee notes in there.  t: Smooth is still prominent, as is black coffee and dark chocolate from the roasty Stout malts. Imperial hop bite is overshadowed by the flavor and smooth texture.  m: Same as before, wouldn't call it lighter than might be expected now, great body and just the right heft.  o: Still wows me. Not changing any rating. One of my top ten brews, and will definitely be a go-to stout.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,microbrewlover,4.83,"This brew pours a solid black color with a two finger mocha head which lasts for some time. Some of the head remains on the brew until the end. Thick mocha lacing, med. carbonation.  The smell is chocolate, burnt and roasted malts, alcohol, licorice and nuts.  The taste follows the nose with the chocolate and alcohol dominating. This brew lost one or two points for not masking the alcohol better; it tastes almost like a Barleywine. Roasted and sweet malts then take over leading to a big hoppy finish.  The mouthfeel is thick and chewy. Bready. A slightly dry feeling is left in the mouth after swallowing.  Overall this is a bold and powerful stout with a great blend of flavors. If you love chocolate then give this a try. Be warned, the alcohol taste might make your hair stand on end but I can't fault this brew too much for that.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

THIS is THAT stout.  Near-perfection. It doesn't suffer from ""too much chocolate,"" ""too much coffee,"" there's not too much of anything. Just the perfect amount of stoutness.  Now I know better, but a few decades ago I would have imagined that this would be what Guinness tasted like....  The nitro tap pour results in an absolutely perfect appearance: pure black, 1/2 inch of caffe latte head. The nose is warm Manhattan Special soda, for the Brooklyn/NYC folks...  Unbelievably smooth.

112,412,Dope,4.23,"No date that I can find. Approximately 3 years old most likely.  A: Pours black with a big thick medium brown head. Head fades very slowly with top notch retention. Substantial and heavy lacing.  S: Definitely has been aging a while. Very mellow aroma. Some chocolate, some char, hint of coffee. Decent dark fruits holding out though, especially when swirled. Just a hint of anise too.  T: A bit more chocolate than the aroma betrays. Mild chocolate with decent coffee, melding with dark fruits up front. Bit bitter towards the finish with the chocolate growing bittersweet and hints of char poking through.  M: Somewhat heavy and smooth. Touch chalky in the finish.  O: One of the best RISes out there and perhaps the best value of them all. Wonderfully complex flavors without any fluff. No barrel aging, no adjuncts. Just various roasted malt characteristics all flung together in a surprisingly balanced manner.

M: Medium bodied with a dry finish and lots of warmth from the alcohol.  O: Wonderful appearance and inviting aroma. Taste is just a little harsh on the palate at first but smooths as the beer warms.

Arresting aromas of coffee, chocolate, and baking spice; it trends a bit on the sweet side and maybe could use a little more roasted malt in the background but that's gilding the lily. The aromas carry through to the palate with more malt presence there, which gives some grip to this and prevents it from being flabby or cloying.

Poured into a pint glass instead of a snifter glass.  A: While I was pouring this beer I've let a ""wow"" coming out of my lungs - such a beautiful beer. A dense dark brown colored body with a big caramelized head that left some lacing. Nice thing here. S: Real coffee (instead of high roasted malt), nuts and chocolate. T: It kinda tastes like a nice expresso with some chocolate bar by its side. It's really good. M: I've seen some other beers that like to balance the sweet and bitter, but nothing like this. It's beautifully sugary at the beginning and awesomely bitter at the end of the sip. The 75 IBUs are just awesome, I've never had a beer with so much IBUs but this is extremely well done.

112,412,Pyrosixer9,4.09,"Appearance: Thick, oily, and pitch black. Exactly what I'm looking for in an Imperial Stout. The head isn't as dark as I would like, coming in at a light tan color, but it sticks around in a pleasant ring all the way to the end. The lacing is to die for. Like spiders made sweet webby love in my glass.  Smell: Huge chocolate notes, mostly dark with a little bit of milk chocolate thrown in. Roasty, with a nutty warmth. Slight touch of alcohol  Taste: Lots of warmth from the alcohol. Roast, coffee bitterness. A different bitter note right as you swallow, like a black tea that has steeped too long. The nuttyness returns to sit on your tongue after each sip.  Mouthfeel: Thick, just the way it should be. The carbonation gives it a lively zip right at the end to keep things exciting.

Completely opaque.  S - Light coffee from roasted malt, cocoa, and an earthiness, I think leather. The alcohol is extremely well-hidden (in both smell and taste).  T - Follows smell, but the roast is gentler and more apparent, and there's some brown sugar like sweetness. There's some refinement but also some muddledness. I think I just don't like certain aspects of many stouts. There's some bitterness that is very dark chocolate like.  M - Full bodied but not very heavy. Very smooth, silky even. Heavy and a little chewy.  D - It's a sipper. Easy to see how people would love this beer a lot.

Slight hint of burnt coffee grains but it doesn't have the typical roasted over the edge smell. Some earthy hops make their way through the mist giving it a nice rounded smell.  T- The taste is a bit complex with the chocolate and coffee mixing in with a vanilla-like sweetness to give you the impression that you are drinking a lite porter. Alcohol is no where to be found and I don't even get the usual warming in the throat. Strong hints of chocolate and slightly roasted coffee. Some hop presence. Nicely balanced.  M- Medium carbonation still coats the palate but doesn't completely slither in the throat. For this style the carbonation is a bit higher then usual but this makes this brew nicer, I think.

112,412,SerialTicker,4.21,"Bottle bought for $2.79 at Fairway Sav-Mor in Eastpointe, Michigan. Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass.  Appearance: Aggressive pour turned out to be an awful idea... massive amount of head that would have been a massive foam over if not for my intense slurping action. Two finger head sticks around for a decent while before staying at one. The head is a dark brown/yellow-ish color, and has a rocky, meringue-like consistency. Surprisingly, not much lacing until the bottom of the glass. Sexy beer, though.  Smell: It's not ""bursting"", but it's significant ... a ton of roasty coffee with caramel notes. Some RIS's have that dark fruit aroma or taste, and this doesn't have it at all ... just some massive roast aromas.  Taste/feel: Maybe it was my slight buzz before the end of my glass (always possible), or it was just that the beer coated my mouth enough to mask some of the intense roast bitterness that I was getting, but I enjoyed this more and more as I sipped it. I was going to give the taste about a 3.5, but I bumped it up... for the style, this is almost the best one I've had. An extremely smooth feel hits the tongue, there's a quick alcohol warmth, and then you're just ushered in to some heavy roasty characteristics. Coffee. The first few ounces of this beer, I kept getting an intensely lingering WEIRD bitterness on the very back of my tongue that just wouldn't go away. As I sipped, and the beer warmed a tad, the bitterness was still there, but some semi-sweet chocolate came in to let me know why this is such a critically acclaimed RIS. Additionally, the alcohol became more apparent in a slight warming on the finish. Man. That thick feel, though...  It's August 1st. I've been drinking RIS's all summer long. I wanted something big, bold, rich. This delivered. While I wasn't initially sold, a few sips later, I really enjoy Old Rasputin.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Smell: Roasted chocolate malt and sweet bananas are nicely framed by some spicy, floral hops that balance the otherwise syrupy scent with a fresh crispness.  Taste: The taste is true to the smell. Roasted mocha, banana bread, and dates, with a slightly burnt bitterness in the finish.  Mouthfeel: Chewy, medium bodied, with medium carbonation, and some comforting alcohol warming.

112,412,schnauzeborne,4.01,"Old Rasputin used to be my favorite beer. One day, I bought a four-pack of OR and a 24 oz. bottle of Guinness Extra Stout, then settled in for the night with what I felt was an adequate amount of good beer. Looking back, I was quite surprised with the similarities between the two beers. In retrospect, Old Rasputin is basically Guinness without the acidic, bitter aftertaste. I know that some people drink Guinness specifically for that vinegary taste, which comes from the brewery reusing samples of their products from previous centuries, so it would be completely understandable if some people prefer Guinness to North Coast Old Rasputin. In my opinion, OR's smoothness and unadulterated chocolate after-taste is highly desirable, and outdoes Guinness by a long-shot. Still, it helped me to realize that there are better options out there. I would recommend Samuel Smith's Oatmeal stout for anyone looking for the next level of delicious stout. For anyone that loves Old Rasputin's taste specifically because of its ability to be delicious while hiding a high alcohol content, I would suggest Weyerbacher's ""old Heretic"" or ""Heresy"" stouts, because even though they do not match the sheer tastiness of Old Rasputin, they definitely hide their ABV better than any other beer I have come across, and are in some ways reminiscent of OR's flavor profile.

Notes of earthy hops, pepper and smoke. Very strong flavor of roasted and smoked malts, with a substantial amount of grassy hops. Notes of caramel, pepper, molasses, grains, dark chocolate and coffee. Quite dry and bitter aftertaste with a residual burnt wood lingering taste. Full body with good carbonation and a spicy feeling. Alcohol of 9% ABV was a coward against its strength and complexity. Powerful and perfectly crafted. Smooth and assertive at the same time. Beautiful brew with a blast of flavors and hops.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,Lucnifter,4.27,"Re-reviewing an old favorite. On nitro. Pours almost black. Thick, tan head. Roast, dark chocolate, coffee on the nose. Dark chocolate, roated malts and some noble hops in the flavor. Thick and creamy. No surprise that I adore Ol' Raspy. This beer was the first impy stout I ever had and little did I know at the time, but it was quite the gateway beer as imperial stouts would quickly become my all time favorite style.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,William85,4.16,"I've had this beer a few times before in the bottle, so I was excited to see it on nitro-tap at a nearby barbecue join (bitterroot in Ballard).  Wow. The flavors in this beer are amazing -- lush chocolate and coffee notes stand out, supported by a fairly intense hop layer. I recall being just as impressed by the flavors with the regular bottle version of Old Rasputin, but the nitro definitely adds a lot to the experience.  The beautiful 2-finger head at the top of my pour was amazingly substantial -- almost completely unaffected by my first couple of sips -- and the texture of this beer is correspondingly creamy/velvety, leaving a pristine lacing trail all the way down the glass.  This is a great beer, as all of the other reviews proclaim, I would heartily recommend the nitro-tap version.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Fatehunter,4.4,"Poured a finger of tan head on a pitch black body. The aroma is full of molasses with a little burnt wood and caramel. Wonderful. The taste is incredible. Lots of burnt malt and molasses but nicely balanced, which makes it almost too easy to drink. The texture is thick with low to moderate carbonation. Heaven in your mouth.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,MarkQ617,4.52,"It was awesome. Had on tap at Slate. I could've used a darker look, but a very pretty looking beer. The smell wakes you up like a black cup of joe, and the taste of the beer has a nice chocolate flavor to match the coffee. Amazingly smooth mouthfeel.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,JamFuel,4.46,"Poured from the bottle into a cognac snifter.  Jet black color, a little bit of head, which is nice and chocolate colored.  The smell is huge, with most smells I want in a stout. Licorice, coffee, chocolate, just a hint of soy sauce.  The taste is terrific, coffee and chocolate lead the way, followed by a lot of liciorice. Very deep and complex, you could sip this for ages.  Medium bodied, with nice carbonation. Maybe my only slight gripe is that it could be a little fuller in body.  This is a true classic, and for good reaon. Complex, but still not daunting. Everything a stout should be.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,VictorWisc,4.61,"Poured into a large snifter (this time--used different glassware every time with largely the same results).  Color pitch black. Thick latte foam with plenty of staying power and lots of lacing, resembling crema.  Nose of good espresso and roasted dark malts. This is followed by pecan notes, with a hint of orange, then a hit of booze--this comes across even in a snifter, which is supposed to concentrate the bouquet.  Taste starts out as strong espresso and that remains throughout. Bitter cocoa notes with dark tea thrown in, a bit of orange zest and pecans mingled with both dark and sweet malts, with hints of caramel and vanilla. Coffee comes through in the finish with more citrus and a hint of pepper. Lingering aftertaste of dark malts and finally some pumpernickel bread, but then shuts off clean. Nice complexity and balance.  Body is big and toasty, almost oily so, again, a comparison with top espresso. Mild but everpresent carbonation. Alcohol is hidden very well, aside from the boozy aroma and a bit of heat in the finish.  This is a beautiful product. I first came across it by accident, while looking for a different impy stout. This stood out because of the name, the artwork and it was $3 less for 4-pack (almost an aberration in MA). I'm much more than $3 richer for it now. This is about as close to a 5 as a regular beer gets (the only distraction is a somewhat boozy nose, and not because of the vessel). I keep going back to the well after that serendipitous moment and it tastes better every time.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,DrinkMoreBigBeers,4.23,"Do not see any dates on North Coast beers. I have however aged this one particular bottle for a year in my cellar.  A - Poured out of the bottle a dark brown but once in the glass its definitely opaque and completely black with a two finger frothy brownish mocha head that left beautiful lacing on the glass.  S - Soft on the nose with a dark malt bill of coffee followed by dark chocolate and a deep roast quality. Under that there is some anise and raisin notes and a sweetness that makes itself known.  T - Right away is a rich coffee bitterness, dark chocolate and the strong roastiness comes through, followed by the residual sweetness that cleanses the bitterness and holds on to the palate. A definite sipper.  M - Nice soft pillowy feel with a medium full body and a bitterness that lingers on the tongue.  O - This is a classic Stout that is a definite big beer sipper. An intense flavor explosion that last in your mouth. I recommend this one for all stout lovers and is must try fro any beer connoisseur.

Excellent retention that you would expect from a stout and beautiful thick, sticky lace. Nose is genuine stout with roasted coffee some dark fruits and a good measure of alcohol.A bit of chocolate to tempt you. Smoky and inviting. Taste is heavenly. Chocolate, coffee malt, roasted, smoky, hints of vanilla and a delightful bitter. Not too thin, and drinks creamy and smooth. The alcohol is on the palate but it’s welcome. It’s a little boozy and who would mind with a flavor like this. Grand, with an aftertaste that boasts of it’s malt character and strength. Sweet and smoky like a fire on a cold night, burnt a little and some dark chocolate too. Fine and excellent.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Groomsy,4.54,"12 oz. bottle poured into a snifter.  This revered RIS pours pitch black with highlights of brown. There is no light getting through this sucker. Massive, sticky, frothy head of dark khaki foam which leaves massing lacing chunks. This beer does not mess around.  On the nose, a classic RIS profile: A noticeable degree of roast, similar to coffee, and lots of chocolate – dark chocolate, cocoa dust, and maybe some milk chocolate. There's a slight dark fruit note (cherries) and just a whiff, very faintly, of alcohol. Super robust. I'm scared, momma.  Yowza. This is a smooth behemoth. I served this at cellar temp to experience the full flavor. Beginning with a robust roasty note – dark roasted coffee comes to mind – the beer dominates with dark, caramelized flavors into the middle of the palate along with some dark fruit and some earthy hop bitterness on the end. I appreciated finding some hop presence in this compared to most in the RIS style. There is just a smidge of alcohol, so I have the feeling this beer would benefit from additional time in the cellar. A super drinkable RIS though and a great balance in the flavor in the profile.  The mouthfeel, as expected, is heavy with a low carbonation tingle. It finishes with some earthy bitterness as well as notes of espresso and dark roast coffee. There's not much alcohol in the flavor, but it is defnitely noticeable in impact.  If you're looking for a starting point with imperial stouts, start here. With a heavy roast characteristic and nice balance of sweetness and bitterness, this beer is just as good fresh as after it has been cellared for a few years.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,PaleZombie,4.22,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a wine glass.  A - Almost jet black with slight ruby tinges coming through at the edges of the glass. Nice 2 fingers of thick creamy tan head.  S - Roasted malts, bitter sweet chocolate, some dark fruits(rasins and plums) a little bit of coffee, and slight alcohol notes. Very nice.  T - Taste is very similar to the nose but I detect more of the bitersweet chocolate and dark fruit in the taste than the nose. Bitter coffee finish on this one.  M - Very nice and creamy on the heavy side. Medium carbonation. So smooth.  O - For the price this is an awesome RIS. It is a sipper though, its so heavy and syrupy yet so good. I think this may become a regular in my fridge.Gets better when it approaches room tempurature.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,flooshmander,3.43,The high alcohol content took a little away from it. I would have enjoyed this beer more at 7.00 abv. As for the particulars rated above: strong point is its look and smell. The alcohol is what equated to the taste & mouthfeel rating being lower than the olfactory.  I'd drink this with dessert in a small 6oz glass.,North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Kuaff,4.54,"Poured from a bottle into a snifter at cellar temperature.  Old Rasputin's head is a dense, three-finger mass of light brown foam which lingers on for quite some time. This stout isn't totally pitch black, as light penetrates the edge of the surface in the glass, but it's still pretty dark and opaque. It leaves some pretty lacing on the glass. One of the prettiest imperial stouts I've seen.  In the smell I get vanilla, sweet milk chocolate, raisins, prunes, and a hint of earthy coffee. Really nice.  Pretty much everything in the smell is also in the taste with the chocolate and tart dark fruits, but there is also a great aftertaste of coffee bitterness and earthy roastiness. The alcohol is VERY well buried under this stout's excellent qualities. I'd say it could pass for 6%.  The carbonation is medium to high. I've had other imperial stouts that are more thick and viscous than this, but it's still pretty substantial. It's good.  This is an amazing, standard-setting sort of Russian imperial stout. It may be one of the most common and widely available beers in it's style, but there is nothing ""common"" about Old Rasputin's character (either the beer or the historical figure).",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

There is a tiny bit of lacing.  S: Smells like a nice yeasty malt that smells a bit like burnt toast. There is a decent, sweet malt backbone with a bit of espresso and a hint of dark chocolate.  T: There is a mess of flavors in here that all seem to fight for the lead. It is how it smells with a solid backbone of malt that tries to introduce other flavors like chocolate and coffee, but they don't work here. The aftertaste is no good at all, but it is a first for me, it is like a bitter chocolate taste. This one is just really hard to describe and not in a good way.  M: It has a really weird mouthfeel, like it can't decide what its texture is. I don't like it at all. It is all swirling smoothness with run of coarse bubbles at the end, but it is different each time. Worst of all it changes and messes with the taste a lot.  O: I did not like this at all.

Maybe a pilsner would suit this day better, but as usual I was anxious.  A: poured a dark brown color and once in the glass, completely jet black. Nice creamy head that disappears within minutes.  S: roasted coffee, chocolate, hints of vanilla. A sharp smell lingers in the nose for a while.  T: mmm... Beer. This one warms the insides. Chocolate upfront, with coffee malts present throughout. Roasted malts complement each other well in this one. Smokiness, with sweet hints of vanilla. Can taste the alcohol, but not overwhelming in the slightest. Kind of reminded me of a bourbon aged stout with the boozy aspect.  M: a bit thinner than I had expected, but doesn't take away from it at all. In fact, makes it even more sessionable. Still a medium bodied beer with a creamy texture once it hits your tounge. Coats the inside of your cheeks for a bit which felt unique. Carbonation is perfect for the style.  O: very impressed with this one. Would recommend to a stout lover as well as someone looking to get into the style.

Poured a twelve ounce bottle of this lovely black and brownish brew into my favorite drinking vessel. A beautiful lingering brownish copper foam that settles quickly with a little lacing on the sides. It then settles and bubbles of alcohol rise to the surface.  Smells of roasted coffee and maple bacon, very inviting indeed on a cold winter(spring) evening.  Taste is a wonderful bitter with a smooth chocolate smoke aftertaste, not normally such a huge malt guy but damn this is good right now!  Hits my tongue with a sharp bitterness that quickly fads to sweetness and maybe even some black cherry.

There is some vanilla and molasses in here creating a somewhat sweet smell. Coffee, malts, some nuttiness, and dark fruits. Digging this nose  Taste: Smooth creamy chocolate with a sweet taste but this is very quickly followed up by a bitterness. More roasty and malts than in the nose creating a nice complexity. Some bitter coffee comes through along with some dark fruits and nut taste. Alcohol is perfectly hidden. Aftertaste I would have to say is more bitter coffee bean like than anything else.  Mouthfeel: This beer is very creamy but I'd have to say leans toward the medium spectrum actually. Thinner than I expected and carbonation seems lower.

Smooth coffee initial taste, bready mid, and chocolatey smooth aftertaste. Reminds me a lot like a Founder's Breakfast Stout  Mouthfeel: Creamy full stout flavor, dry aftertaste.  Overall: One of the best stout's ive ever had, I would rank it right up there with Founder's Breakfast Stout and my local Liberty Street Brewing's Emperor Norton. So smooth and heavy, and every flavor note you would expect in a world class stout; chocolate, coffee, bready... This one one beer you should try, even if you're not a fan of the style, it is a solid representation of a perfect Russian Imperial Stout.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

You would think you're about to down pure oil if the smell didn't hit your nose just before the liquid gold hits your mouth. It smells of smokey chocolate, hops and alcohol. This beer tastes very creamy, very complex. If my kid is ever diagnosed with a terminal disease and we get to go somewhere via the ""make a wish"" foundation, I'm gonna demand to see what the heck they're doing at Lost Coast with this brew. ....not really, of course.

112,412,brewcifix,4.84,"Appearance- Raspy pours black with a thick fluffy beige head. This beer laces like a champ! There were rings all down my glass! And, the ice cream soda looking head is going the distance! I’m almost done, with plenty of head left.  Smell- There's a strong chocolate, cream nose.  Taste- First there’s a rush of dark coffee, espresso, bitter chocolate, molasses, and burnt malt flavors. Then this stout finsihes with subtle hops and an INCREDIBLE cereal-malt-espresso aftertaste that lingers LONG.  Mouthfeel- The mouth feel is silky smooth, with medium carbonation and a heavy weight on the tongue.  Overall- This beer is OUT OF THIS WORLD. I would LOVE to find this stuff on tap! Easily, this is one of the absolute BEST crafted, looking, and tasting brew that I have ever come across!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Rhower,4.31,"An overall fun & outstanding experience with a pint glass of this renowned RIS.  A: Enjoyed this for my first time on a nitro-tap (I know, don't be jealous) at the West Reading Tavern. The thick, creamy head settled itself into a two-fingered, pillowy soft foam that lingered for the entire session. Black, dense, motor-oil appearance with a pleasant ""drink me"" syrup viscosity. 4  S: Smoke, caramel, and malt. Very rich in the nose with a nearly buttery warmth - much like the appearance, the nose of this brew begs a hearty quaff. 4.5  T: A burnt caramel front, melding with a back-end tobacco hint that finishes with a malty flare. The place where this beer veered for me - not into anything even remotely unpleasant, but just a slight let down - was at it's close as it warmed. Where the first half of the beer, experienced at a pleasant just beyond cold temperature soared. I found that the beer took on a sour finish as it warmed. Not bitter - not deeper in it's malt character - just ... sour. Surprisingly, I found I wouldn't nurse this beer toward warmth in future pints, but would rather enjoy the full glass before it struck that final chord. 4  M: A beautiful aspect of this beer; it's heavy, dense, buttery soft feel in the mouth. From start to finish, each sip is very easy - never touching on a place where the alcohol draws on the mouth. It is one of the smoothest drinking RIS I've ever had. 4.75  O: This is one of those ""kid at Christmas"" beers. If I walk into a bar and see this on the draught list, my excitement soars and my knees start to jump ... from first sip to last (albeit a little faster ""last"" than on this visit), an exceptional brew! 4.5",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,zrbeer1579,4.08,EDIT: Updated review  Appearance: Just black with a one and half finger light mocha dense creamy head that lasted for a quite a while.  Aroma: Roasted and burnt malts. Dark chocolate and some coffee. And some dark fruits as well.  Taste: Dark roasted chocolate and coffee. Burnt malts. A slight of dark fruits. Nice bitterness throughout the flavors . Finish have a lingering roasted chocolate bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Medium-heavy bodied. Almost creamy but the carbonation feels a bit too much.  Overall: Even through the stout it's not as intense as I thought it would be (and as described on the bottle); it tasted good. I definitely would not mind having it again.,North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Tastes the same, and just tastes awesome. Incredibly roasty and dark in flavor, with an ashy smoky bitterness at the end of each sip. In between, you get a lot of chocolate and espresso coffee. The chocolate flavor is, like everything else, dark and bittersweet. This has a slight bit of vanilla creaminess, too.  This has an amazing mouthfeel, even without nitro. It's so creamy and decadent, coats your mouth perfectly. There's a perfectly low amount of carbonation.  This is definitely one of the best stouts out there.

It had about an inch of head that was so thick I could sit a quarter on it without sinking and remained for the duration of my glass. Dark black in color with that awesome mocha head that lingered.

The pour is as i recall it thin and volatile. Initially sits in the glass a mess of fizzy nonsense but settles into a much more frothy looking head. Id bump it 4.25. Still looks stupid thin though.  Smell is unmistakable. The sense of smell is so uncanny and how you never forget it as well as it can instantaneously send you back to the first time youve smelled something. Strikingly similiar yo guinness foreign extra (which is one I legitimately haven't had in probably 10 years but instantly smell in this). Its such a uniquely roasty aroma shared between these two beers and I cant quite put my finger on the right descriptor to pin down the note. Almost lactose smelling with a strange sweetness. Or is it just lactose? I'll bump smell to 4.5 flirting with 4.75.  Taste. Fucking killer. Roasty, charred magnificence. Jesus this is exquisite and I see why I rated it at 3.5 back in 2012... i wasn't ready for bitter roast back then. 4.75 all fucking day.  Feel. Damn. Here's the sole disappointment. Although for 9% this is a much less massive stout than I typically drink the style. Its not big or chewy but as I sip onward I'm more and more okay with that. Just as I've transitioned back to basic flawless beers like snpa and weihenstephaner I have a new renewed appreciation for the simplicity and quality of this.

This was a huge WANT for me, and finally found it at a beer deli last night.  A- Motor oil black. Poured from a bottle, left a lot of tan head that was thick and slow to dissipate. A ton of intricate lacing left on the glass  S-Strong coffee and roasted malt, with a backing of chocolate and alcohol. Everything an Imperial Stout should smell like.  T- Very strong coffee and chocolate, segwaying into a bite of hops and alcohol. The alcohol taste isn't boozy, but well balanced and leaves a nice warming sensation.  M- Almost milkshake thick. The warming alcohol gives a very pleasant mouthfeel.  Overall- Rarely does a beer live up to its hype, but Old Rasputin totally did for me. My only regret is that I wasn't able to have it on tap for my first time, as I'm sure that would only amplify the already awesome quality of this beer.

Creamy, with chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt notes and a touch of alcohol at the end. If this beer followed the nose, I think I'd have an all-time favorite.  T - Starts with heavy roasted malts and black coffee notes, followed up with alcohol, dark chocolate, and finishes with a pine hop punch. Reminds me somewhat of a thin mint for some reason. Must be the chocolate and pine. Pretty good, but surprisingly...not my favorite imperial.  M - A lot of carbonation. Heavy mouth feel. While I typically enjoy less carbonation in my beers, I still found this to be a worthwhile experience. I've heard this beer described as a fine representation of the style, so if nothing else, try this beer for that reason.  O - Enjoyed it.

This has the appearance that a good stout should; very dark but not jet black with just enough opacity to see nucleation bubbles form the sides of the glass. It produces a nice balanced head but I would prefer it to be a little finer in texture (the head that is). The smell is reminiscent of a good working man's Irish stout. The aroma has just the right balance of bitterness and toasted grain. The taste is where Old Rasputin really shines! It is full bodied and flavorful with a clean finish. It is neither too bitter nor in any way weak. As I said, very well balanced. Mouthfeel is good; it's smooth and clean without feeling watery.  This is an EXCELLENT every day drinking Stout!

Stoked to finally be trying this beer. Poured into a Firestone Walker pint glass.  A - Pours the blackest of black with a very nice looking two and a half finger mocha colored foamy head with excellent retention. Some nice fluffy lacing as the head recedes.  S - Alcohol strikes my sniffer initially followed by some dark fruit / fermented nut smells with some rich dark chocolate in there as well. Roasted coffee beans. Not a terribly complex smell going on, but there is a decent amount of action happening here and it smells wonderful. Some faint hop nugget smell coming through.  T - Smooth velvety chocolate. Faint bourbon booze type taste. Roasted dark coffee bean & pungent hop cone bitterness. Dark fruit / nut taste is very apparent and inviting. Even more inviting is this beer's nice cozy 9.00% abv which is very well masked; a slight hint of the alcohol begins to emerge as the beer warms. A fair level of carbonation present.  M - Again, smooth and creamy texture. Very well-balanced, doesn't sit heavy in the stomach like some overly carbonated stouts tend to do, which is impressive especially for a 9.00% abv. It gives you some room to really taste the flavors. Some roasted coffee bean / hop bitterness hanging out for a little bit with some sweetness in the finish. A wonderful taste, I must say.  Overall, definitely a stout worth trying, one of the better Russian imperial stouts that I have had thus far. Fairly simple, yet still packing enough action to be unique and notable. It is probably the landmark beer for North Coast Brewing, and it is a beer I would surely have again.

The one that sent me into a panic nearly 14 years ago when I first stumbled on this brew from a then unknown micro brewery when I was living outside of Columbus Ohio. I was immediately taken in by this beer and quickly, shuddered to think, oh my, what if this brewery doesn't make it? And that thought sent me exploring the world of home brewing to see if I could personally brew something that came close to this, in the event, heaven forbid, that Old Rasputin would cease to be.  The good news is that I was able to come close enough so I feel prepared if that horrible day ever comes. But even better news, I haven't had to resort to that workaround. Old Rasputin lives!  Pours an exotic black with a tan head that tops the beer nicely before evolving into a layer of a tan sudsy blanket that drapes this brew. Oh yes, and I always drink this one at cellar temperature, never chilled, in a snifter as well.  Nose is spectacular, inviting with notes of chocolate cake, licorice, and roasty espresso.  On the palate, this is like a slice of liquid black forest torte, nicely balanced with roasty and sweet tones.  Mouthfeel is nice with very light carbonation. Wouldn't want any more for this style.

Aroma: Not a particularly impressive nose- some toffee and caramel, a bit of burnt sugar. (3)  Colour: Pours a dark cola colour with a very nice 2cm brown head that sticks around for less than a minute. Lacing is very good, seductive even. (4)  Flavour: Follows the nose but much more forward. Starts off with a nice smoky maltiness, followed by the nose's toffee and caramel with some dark chocolate. The toffee dominates the finish. Very tasty but not superbly complex like some of the other RIS's can get to be. (4)  Mouthfeel: Nice thick body but closer to the medium range of the spectrum. Not particularly creamy but it isn't a BA stout. Carbonation is solid but doesn't particularly stand out. Aftertaste is a nice toffee bitterness which sticks around a while. It's a bit bitter for a stout, even a RIS. I find it interesting. (4)  Overall: A pretty good RIS, above average for the style. It would be nice if it had a better nose and wasn't as bitter to fit the style which would make it an even better brew.

When it dissipates, it leaves thick, sticky sheets of lacing.  Dark fruit, a touch of soy, roast malt, and chocolate start the aroma. Deeply toasted, nutty scents are accentuated by sorghum sweetness and earthy notes, finishing with a touch of coffee grounds. Malted milk balls and licorice emerge. There's a touch of plasticy phenols.  Flavor is dominated by deeply roasted malt, lightly sweet, which becomes chocolatey mid palate, and finishes charred, a touch acrid, and fairly bitter. Underlying notes of dark cherries surface, adding complexity. Toasted, nutty notes and dark chocolate are evident in the aftertaste.  Body is thick and smooth, with low carbonation and substantial alcohol warmth. There's a bit of astringency at the finish.  Aside from some light phenol presence, an excellent brew.

112,412,machalel,4.59,"Appearance: Thick and dark, verging on black, with very little light being let through. A thick coffee coloured head, which lasts for a reasonable time. Leaves a bit of lacing down the glass.  Aroma: Really nice aroma that combines a shot of coffee, dark chocolate, dark fruit, caramel, and a little bit of hops. Definitely coffee forward on the nose, but perfectly complex underneath.  Taste: Where the aroma is more coffee forward, I found the taste was quite a bit more chocolaty, with a good whack of malt and caramel. There is a bit of burnt grain somewhere in there, but not enough to become unpleasant. The hops are quite balanced, and even though a bitter dark chocolate aftertaste is present, there is enough refinement and balance that nothing is overpowered. Nice warmth from the alcohol, but again it is very well balanced, and adds to the flavour rather than distracts from it.  Mouthfeel: A little bit drier than the flavours would make you think it is, but I think that is partially due to the ABV. If I had to find a fault, it could probably be a little thicker and creamier, but that is just my preference.  Overall: Wonderful! I was wondering if this was going to live up to the rating here, and I can pleasantly report that it does. It is both easy to drink, and complex enough to savour. A really terrific stout that manages to tick every box.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Labeorphile,4.86,"Poured from bottle into a pint glass. Jet black pour leaving a giant foamy head that lingers for a long time, and leaves sticky lacing sliding down the sides of the glass.  Aroma is amazing. Malt, some buried hops, coffee and dark chocolate. The smell was so amazing, I literally sat there with my nose in the glass for about 5 minutes before taking my first sip.  Flavor lived up to smell. Malty goodness with hints of coffee fading to some subtle hoppiness, then with dark chocolate bitterness showing back up at the finish.  Mouth feel is a little thin for style, but carbonation is surprisingly nice. Good lingering warmth down the throat.  A really great beer that I am glad I bought in a 4 pack instead of a single.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,timontheroad,4.36,"Dark brown, almost black color, with a half inch head that faded over time to a thin film that left little lacing.mthe smell was coffee, dark roast malt with a hint of chocolate.

Some dark fruit (raisin/prune). Some alcohol. A bit of coffee.  T: Bitter dark chocolate that transitions into a charred malt. Grain flavor is a bit bitter. Aftertaste is of dark chocolate. There's a bit of dark fruit sweetness hiding behind all the roasty flavors. A bit of the alcohol comes through.  M: Light bodied with medium carbonation. Fuller body would be better. Some stickiness and wet.  O: Good complex, roasty, and bitter RIS. Not very expensive and good quality.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

S: Caramelized sugar, dark chocolate, and grilled meats  T: Roasty, chocolate. This beer has a lot of hops among RIS but the balance of malty to bitter is so well maintained that the hops don't have a flavor so much as add to the whole experience. The 9% alcohol is completely masked, if I didn't know better I'd session this beer.  M: Not sticking to the roof of my mouth, but the flavor says it could be. lots of bubbles.  O: Fantastic, the best example of a RIS I've ever had. also very affordable for the RIS category. This beer is a treat as much as it is a beer that I could enjoy everyday.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Sokool,4.5,"Appearance- Pours black with a finger's worth of head that stayed through almost the entire glass, leaving heavy lacing all down the side.  Aroma- I got a lot of hops with a hint of malty chocolate.  Taste- The overall flavor of this beer is dry and bitter (and yet somehow so drinkable) with a complex layering of hops, burnt/roasty coffee and chocolate flavors. Over time, as the beer warmed up the balance started tipping a little more to the malty side. After each drink I got a really warm feeling in my throat after 5-10 seconds.  This beer has a lighter mouthfeel and more carbonation than many RIS's that I have tried. Also not as malty/sweet, which is perfect for my taste!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,xoagray,4.74,"Thick, dark beer with flavors of fruits and coffee. Has a good head and looks great in a glass. Feels a little syrup like in the mouth, but doesn't get bitter at all if it lingers for a while on your tongue.  Starts off with just a tinge of bite, but that's all you'll ever get, the rest is smooth and tasty. I could see this going very well with a roast beef sandwich.  In short, very very good.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

A slight hint of alcohol hits the tongue first. Some slight sweetness and dark fruit comes through in the middle fading into a roasted malt espresso bitterness that lingers on tongue.  The mouthfeel is creamy and almost chewy.  Overall a great way to end the work day in the dead of January.

The lace was beautiful and formed a nice latticework all the way down until the last sip. The nose was oaky and burnt with some undertones of some kind of nut, I couldn't quite tell. The flavor was dark,dark chocolaty with strong notes of coffee. MF was thick but very smooth. This is the best stout I've ever had, and definitely in the top 2 beers I've ever had in my entire life. An overall blissful experience from the appearance all the way to the last sip. I enjoyed it at a little less than room temp (60 degrees F).",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,hctap00,4.23,"Poured into a red wine glass. Not the best for head retention, but all that was clean.  Pretty standard imperial stout appearance. Pitch black. Solid tan that fades to a thin lacing.  Aroma is not overpowering, but still has a lot going on. Roasted malt and some coffee first. Dark chocolate. Fruity also, cherry and the licorice/anise I get from good stouts.  Pretty bitter up front, with some coffee flavors. Good roasted malt flavor. Sweeter through the middle, but still very astringent. A bit harsher than I would like with the bitterness. Finishes fairly smooth, with some of the fruitiness from the aroma. A nice alcohol warmth to it. Coffee and roasted malt lingers for a while.  Mouthfeel is a bit puckering. Felt like I was drinking red wine at times.  Overall very enjoyable. Not my favorite. I would drink a Ten FIDY first, but I still enjoy this one.

112,412,KFBR392,4.45,"Appearance: Dark as night. Nice amount of lacing on the glass. Thin head but that is to be expected.  Smell: A really awesome hop presence here. Smells like what a RIS should. Like malt undertones mix PERFECTLY with the hops. Nothing fancy, just everything that it should be.  Taste: Yep, just awesome. I think this is one of the best representations of the style that is widely available. The malt smokey flavors hit right away, followed by such a wonderful hop bitterness. Man this beer is good.  Mouthfeel: A heavy lacing makes the mouth water, but at the same time those hops dried out that palette. A smooth body really carries this beer through to the end.  Overall: This beer just paints the picture of sitting in front of a warm fire on a cold winter night. Would be good to enjoy with a strong cigar. If you want to try out a RIS at a very reasonable price, get yourself a 4 pack of the Old Rasputin",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,JamesMN,4.29,"Appearance: Black as night with a nice pillowy two finger tan head.  Aroma: Cocoa and dark roasted malts with a touch of cream. Very clean and somewhat straightforward.  Taste: Charred malts, semi-sweet cocoa, light coffee, and an overall rich roasted malt flavor that engulfs the palate. The flavor gets more intense from the beginning of each sip until the end and leaves a lasting bitter burnt malt flavor in the finish. Exactly what I'm looking for in this style. Just a hint of grassy hops but not much bitterness from that department as far as I can tell. I'd file this one under the more coffee/chocolate flavor profile with very little in terms of dried fruits and currant flavor one gets in other Russian Imperial Stouts. Some hints of caramel and amber malts right before the finish and the flavor develops more as it warms. As far as alcohol goes, the modest 9% ABV doesn't appear until about halfway through the glass when it gives a slight warming in the back of the throat. The roasted malt bitterness is also subdued as the temperature goes up. An almost bourbon-like quality emerges as well. The whole flavor profile starts simple and then gets increasingly complex and smooth. Masterfully done.  Mouthfeel: Medium to slightly below medium in body (a tad light for the style). I gave this one an aggressive pour knowing that a common complaint is that it has a lot of effervescence. That being said the carbonation was still very evident but just at the threshold of not being overly done. Decently smooth and more so as it warmed. Easy drinking.  Final Thoughts: For the price (&lt;$9.00 a four-pack) it's a phenomenal deal. I might pick a couple more bottles up to cellar. Wish they would sell a barrel-aged version. Would I drink it again? Yes.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,C20Percent,4.37,"A: Pours a dark brown with a big, bubbly, tan colored head. Very clean appearance. Really nice head. And, the lacing really adds to the beer-drinking experience.  S: Roasted malts. Dark chocolate and cocoa. Some coffee notes in the background. Some sweetness in the aroma, and the hops are coming through as well.  T: Hops and cocoa -- first and foremost. High quality malt work here. Not a bunch of complexity here, but that's not a bad thing. Super clean, with a sweet and salty finish.  M: Quite possibly the most smooth and creamy beer I've ever had. This beer sets the standard. Perfect carbonation. Velvety. Chewiness that brings out the cocoa. Superb.  O: This beer doesn't overdue it.

112,412,spoony,3.87,"From a 12 oz bottle into a snifter.  A-A normal pour produces a one-plus-finger head of dirty, mocha-colored foam. The foam hangs around for a bit before settling into a ring. The beer is pitch-black. No light gets through this stuff.  S-The smell is a relatively simple, but pleasing, mixture of dark chocolatey roasted malt scents with a lightly bitter coffee component. There is a touch of caramel in there, too.  T-Taste is dark, roasted malts with a semi-sweet chocolate flavor being the most identifiable for me. There is a touch of cold coffee, as well. The finish is lightly bitter (a touch of hops) but sweetens as it fades. I thought the flavor was a touch simple and metallic for an RIS.  M-A little light for the style with some prickly, fine carbonation. The feel works against this beer, I think.  O-It has been a year or two since my last Raspy, and the beer is mostly as I remember it: a decent, widely available RIS, but nothing I would seek out. This beer doesn't have the same complexities as Ten Fidy or Narwhal, but if you are fan of the classic, roasted, mildly bitter malt flavor, look no further. I suppose this brew earns points for being true to the classic style.

The beer has a nice malt that connects all the flavors together. It maybe has a touch of hops but not too much. It's also not too bitter and not very dry. Pretty sweet overall especially since it has a 9% ABV  M: This is pretty thick. It also has a smooth mouth-feel and has little to no carbonation.  O: Amazing!

While not totally out of control, this beer's gravity is readily apparent, giving it a little bit of a cough syrup-like quality. Surprisingly bitter, though, as with many imperial stouts, I suspect this beer isn't short on hops. The bite of the alcohol and the hops begin to mellow out as the beer warms a bit.

S- a bunch of roasted malt, chocolate, toffee, and chocolate chip cookies. A touch of alcohol and fruitiness.  T- a lot of roasted flavors up front that seemed to mellow after it warmed a bit. Chocolate, dark dried fruit like plum, toffee, a bit of malty sweetness balancing out the bitterness of the roast. No hop bitterness. The rated bitterness sticks around for a while, then the warming comes down the esophagus bout 15 seconds after the first swallow.  M- Appropriate carbonation that makes it drink smoothly. Not as viscous as I would expect. Dry felling on the finish.

Still this is one good smelling brew with the chocolate taking me to a shop that has just opened its wares. Taste is somewhat the reverse with more coffee than chocolate. Hops are a star in this show and they will not take a back seat to anyone. Rich and smooth latte flows into an herbal and dry citrusy bittering. Finish is rather clean and quite dry.

Coffee, roasted malts, chocolate and brown sugar come through, caramel and butter aromas are hidden and the smell is masked by a general scent of mild sweetness. Crisp when it hits your tongue, it’s bitter over all and has a medium-to-heavy mouth feel. The roasted malts are well evident in the aftertaste and on the side of your mouth; mild chocolate flavors are present throughout, not a bad stout at all. The aftertaste lingers on for a while, this is when you can taste the alcohol, it’s not bad.

Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint bar glass it was midnight black with 2 fingers of brown dense foam that left thick lacing as it dissipated.  Very noticeable aromas of roasted malt, chocolate, and coffee beans greet the nose.  Tastes of coffee, chocolate, and some slight sweetness that hinted of dark fruit like prunes.  This beer was very viscous and has one of the most lingering marvelous flavor profiles I have had with a stout. Very flavorful and intense, I was tasting the flavors for several minutes after each sip. I must get more. So much beer...so little time.  Kudos to North Coast.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,facundoCNB,4.25,"poured this jet black syrup into a tulip glass, got a finger of dark brown head which made some nice lacing. a beautiful looking beer. smells of roasted nuts, coffee, cocoa, almost a coca cola type scent. very unique smell. a bitter, yet subtle dark roasted coffee flavor up front. nutty overtones, a subtle vanilla aftertaste. very mellow and drinkable. no sign of the alcohol in the taste. full body, low carbonation, silky smooth. a really good stout, no question about it. this bottle is from 2011 (a year and change old) so it's a bit more subtle than it is fresh. even fresh, this is a great stout.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,sethcroisant,4.25,"A- black with no light making its way through. somewhat modest head, but what's there is dense. pretty good lacing  S- alcohol is most prominent, although the roasted malts do an impressive job of pushing through the 9% abv. coffee is on the nose as well as undertones of chocolate.  T- the alcohol throws the first punch, but it backtracks quickly. tons of roasted malts with a little bit of hops that make it fairly bitter. hints of chocolate and caramel malts are in the finish to add a little balance.  O- i was surprised the first time i drank this beer when i found out it was 9%. the intensity of the roasted malts mask the alcohol very well. incredibly drinkable for the style.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,falloutsnow,3.58,"Old Rasputin is an enjoyable RIS with an apparent emphasis on roasted malt, giving this beer roasted and charred flavors with prune-like sweetness and hints of cocoa beans and roasted coffee beans. Unfortunately, the ethanol is able to bleed through somewhat substantially, and while the roasted malt and chocolate flavors are substantial, they're not as overwhelming as in, say, Odin's Tipple. The result, for me, is a beer with good aroma and taste, but unfortunately hurt by an easily detectable ethanol presence that detracts from these more interesting components. Good, but due to this imbalance, I'd say not in the upper echelon as it's currently ranked.  Pours a 2cm head of dark tan foam: the bubbles are small and compressed, giving this a very dense head. Retention is about average for the style, lasting only a minute or so as it fades to a thin cap of foam atop the body. Lacing is present, modest, a few Body is an opaque brown to black, with no visible carbonation.  Aroma primarily of roasted malt, with some dark prune-like sweetness, ethanol, and slight vanilla. Not as complex or huge of an aroma as I was hoping/expecting.  Taste is generally of roasted malt, unrefined cocoa nibs, prune-like sweetness and ethanol. Opens with prune and raisin-like sweetness on the front of the tongue, moving to a mid-palate of roasted malt, prune-like sweetness, strong ethanol, and hints of modest chocolate and coffee. Back of palate picks up ethanol and roasted malt, leading to an aftertaste of lingering roasted malt, minor dark chocolate and roasted coffee beans, and subdued ethanol. I really like the aftertaste of this beer and wish that the entire experience was as enjoyable.  Beer is medium-heavy to heavy in body weight, with medium levels of carbonation. The result is a beer with enough carbonation to slowly propel this across the palate in an appropriate fashion for an imperial stout. Ethanol heat and burn is definitely felt across the entire palate, but is less detracting here than elsewhere. Substantial stickiness across the palate after each sip.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,AmitC,4.33,"So i have Old Rasputin now...  Appearance: Pours a dark brown color. Pitch black inside the glass. Absolute darkness. About two fingers thick shining brown head with good persistence. Sticky lacing that will stay on the sides forever and as is.  Aroma: Good roasted malts stout aroma, some burnt up smell, slight coffee and a good amount of hops. Alcohol is discernible very well. Likable but a tad under strength i feel.  Taste: Very strong taste. Malt wise, hop wise and roast wise. Just awesome. Starts with sweet malts. then some burnt up roastedness and finally ends with some happy mix of hop and charred bitterness. Good amount of alcohol presence.  Mouth feel. Medium to full bodied, leaves something to be desired body wise. Dry bitter finish. Very slight hop and roast derived astringency. Moderate carbonation makes it comparatively easy to drink.  Overall: Lives up to the reputation, underwhelming here and there. But a top notch brew nonetheless.

No light gets through this, during the pour it was deep deep brown like ebony or mahogany.  S: big roasty notes, I get notes of dates and prunes. a bit of alcohol. No hops that I can detect.  T: I love this stuff. Big toasted and roasted notes, a bit of the date flavor from the nose. Lots of hop on the finish that last a good long time.

112,412,Moose90,4.33,"Poured into a 20oz tulip pint glass.  A - Pours thick and dark, leaves a nice 1"" foamy light brown head. Standard stout, plus a bit extra. Just sitting there it looks delicious. Head fades to thin layer, but leaves great lacing.  S - A lot of hop from a stout, somewhat unexpected. The usual dark roast coffee, and chocolate do come through. I also pick up on some solid black licorice on this one, and a little burnt toast.  T - Really dark roasted malt character, almost burnt, yet not off-putting. Starts strong and bitter, and fades to a nice dry stout full of coffee, licorice and molasses.  M - Carbonated a tad more than some other stouts, but this helps to balance out the minimal alcohol bite. Makes for an enjoyable beer. It is full, rich, and chewy, but not cloying or sticky. I like this.  O - So glad I finally tracked this beer down. It has lived up to the hype and I imagine some age on it would make it even better.

Impressive for a 9% that sat for a while.  Aroma: Rich caramel and chocolate, mild roast.  Flavor: More roast and hop character than the nose. Still solid notes of dark chocolate and caramel.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied, chewy.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,tectactoe,4.24,"Pours a shade of black, barely dark brown around the very top and edges of the beer - looks super viscous and thick as hell. Leather-tan head, super thick with little fine bubbles; great definition and nice retention.  The chocolate aroma is noticeable even before putting your nose to the glass. Huge bouts of unsweetened, dark cocoa beans and bittersweet, black coffee/espresso beans as a secondary note. Big-time roasted malt aromas fill your head, leaving a silky smooth and buttery feeling before even taking a sip.  First sip, chocolate amasses on the palate to a huge degree; dense and deep - not like a milk chocolate bar, more like a less-sweet version of dark chocolate, raw cocoa beans, dry cocoa powder. The chocolate gives way fairly quickly to a charred, woody, nutty flavor; oak and nuts, just toasted to hell and burnt to a crisp. Some slightly bitter coffee is in the background, maybe more like espresso - very strong, deep, rich, and dense.  The woody flavor lasts until the end and even begins to take on a smokey character after a bit. A few seconds before the final moments of the sip, the bitterness of the hops start to come alive, and are very noticeable here, unlike many RIS's where the hops are almost nowhere to be seen. They take on a very herbal, leafy, and grassy profile, playing hand-in-hand with the bitterness from the unsweetened cocoa and coffee flavors earlier.  The bitterness from the hops grows and fades out - the aftertaste is a combination of the herbal burn, charred and smokey wood, slight tobacco, and an overall roasted-character finish. Overall, a very dry, bitter, and nearly harsh finish which is supported by some underlying sweetness from the malt. Alcohol warmth is notable at seemingly random times, but never impedes or distracts. Thick and creamy body, silky smooth, robust, and rich. Medium carbonation, slightly higher than many other RIS's.  Wow, a truly complex beer, and very true to it's style. This RIS is unique enough to stand out and that's what has allowed it to make a name for itself. Nice, noticeable bitterness and herbal hop presence which goes unnoticed in so many brews of this style - very refreshing for a change of pace. Slow sipper at 9.0% ABV, but the alcohol plays well with the palate and never gets overbearing. Bottom line: if you like RIS's - stock up on this.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,BucannonXC5,3.67,"Bottle into a pint glass at my house on Nov. 27, 2012 (purchased for $2.09 at BevMo in La Mesa, Calif. (San Diego) on Nov. 27, 2012). Mahogany black with 3-4 fingers of tan head that lasted for quite some time. Good and thick retention on the top and the sides of the glass.  Smelled a sharp bite of alcohol first. That was followed by coffee, roasted coffee beans, roasted nuts, hazelnut, dark caramel, toffee and dark chocolate.  Tasted that sharp bite of alcohol up front, like the smell. Really a liquor type of alcohol, maybe vodka. Also coffee, hazelnut, toffee, dark chocolate and caramel. Nice warming finish.  Full body. Creamy slick texture. Average-to-above average carbonation. Long warm finish with some bitterness.  I’ve always seen this beer in the stores and I finally pulled the trigger tonight. It was basically what I expected, which is an average Russian Imperial Stout. And that’s coming from a guy who probably overrates all RIS’s. EDIT: This grew on my as it went down. I upped a couple of ratings.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,natescape,4.88,"Managed to find this on tap at CBS Scene in Foxoboro, MA. I had never tried it before, and was completely blown away. Served in a standard pint glass, the beer arrived black as midnight in a cave on a cloudy night with a blindfold on. It had a thick, rich finger-width head with an aroma of deep smoked malt and hints of chocolate and espresso. Mouthfeel was rich, slightly chewy, and utterly fulfilling. Tasting it was like entering another world... smooth, deep, just hoppy enough to add a little something extra. The flavor lingered for a while afterwards ... a blessing.

112,412,LeeryLeprechaun,4.33,"Beer pours jet black with a brown head that fades back into the glass. It can easily be recovered with a gentle swirl of the glass. No highlights.  The aroma is of burnt toast, roasted dark coffee, and dark chocolate or maybe bakers chocolate. Everything is very well balanced with nothing sticking out.  The taste starts off semi-sweet with notes of chocolate, coffee, and toast. The finish is like the after taste of black coffee but with no bitterness. Very well balanced and not at all cloying for the extreme amount of alcohol, which does not even make an appearance in the taste.  The beer is very smooth, very pleasant to sip.  Very enjoyable beer. It is nice to finally get to try it and have in actually live up to the hype. I would certainly recommend this beer.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

S - Fantastic smell, great hop character, with a mild alcohol nose, and some notes of cocoa, coffee and sweet roast  T - Heavy roast bitterness up front, mild hops, dark coffee. Very multi-layered flavor. Alcohol on the back, the roasted black flavors of coffee, chocolate and burnt sugar, all rotating and being balanced by a prominent, floral hoppy bitterness.  M - Thick, lively carbonation, foamy finish. A wonderful texture for a RIS. Heavy, hearty, full.  O - A fantastic beer, just as great as I'd heard.

First taste: THICK mouthfeel. I found myself unconsciously chewing to get it down. First of these I’ve been able to taste the carbonation on. Quite bitter, but it’s more under control than the Victory. Flavor profile takes 5+ full seconds to roll around my tongue. It’s like there’s a beginning, a middle, a bridge, a climax, and a denouement. Starts quite sweet and chocolatey, then becoming more bitter, going through a black coffee phase and then . . . almost like the char on a grilled steak? Hard to describe, but deep and rich flavor. Does leave a bitter aftertaste, but it’s not as oppressive as some imperial stouts. My mouth still chews automatically with every swig, haha.

112,412,TastyAdventure,4.74,"Appearance - motor oil black. big, nearly 2 finger head that is think and foamy, almost the consistency of whipped cream. awesome. head is tan colored, darkest head i've seen. good retention and lacey all the way down the glass.  Smell - touch of burnt oats, bitter coffee.  taste - mild malty sweetness immediately taken over by burnt oats and bitter coffee. the head tames the bitterness with a smooth creamy slight sweetness. finishes pretty dry, and begs you to take another drink. Although you have to monitor yourself; it's pretty heavy.  Mouthfeel - thick and creamy. the carbonation is very low, despite the large whipped-cream-esque head, and is perfect for this style of beer.  Monster! the best stout hands down! A little too bitter for me, but that's just the style, and I'm a sweet malt lover. I'll take one anytime anyplace.  Next review: Aged for 8 months  A (5) - jet black, 3 fingers tan chunky head  S (4.75) - Straight chocolate. Whiskey. very very slight resin scent.  T (5) - Smoooth. Sweet chocolate. slightly burnt coffee, then more chocolate that's caramelized. Heavy cream. chocolate. After several drinks, I pick up on a mild resiny hops that are only slightly different than the acrid burnt coffee taste earlier.  M (4.75) - Smooth. Smooooth. The chunky whipped-cream-like head is a nice topping, and sometimes the body feels like heavy cream.  Overall, aging for 8 months was great for this beer. I was blown away.

Huge toasted flavor, with lots of malt and milk chocolate. Good balance of sweet and bitter. Just a hint of alcohol. Little thinner in the mouth that one may expect, but also means it's not overly sticky. Overall, a great beer that's widely available.

Long drapes of foam.  Smell: Espresso beans, chocolate, straddles the sweet and bitter with some baker's chocolate shavings.  Taste: Rich, slight licorice, bitter sweet chocolate but then the over the top roasted coffee permeates the flavor. Too unbalanced to be properly enjoyed.

112,412,KKB,4.82,"A – Deep, deep mahogany, hints of ruby when held up to the light so not quite black, a large, pillowy, beige/tan head that rises up to the top of the glass. This is one of the better looking beers that you’ll ever encounter….lacing doesn’t last too long though, probably owing to the full-bodied oily nature of this beer.  S – Now I’ve had this beer many many times before, and in my opinion the single best thing about it is the way it smells. The hops explode out of the bottle right off the bat. Hops? Hell yes, hops. But it is overwhelmed with chocolate and coffee and heavily roasted malt. Chocolate is the overarching smell though…or is it hops? So close, so complimentary. Oh my dear god, so good. So good that I don’t even feel like drinking it, just smelling it. Has kind of a fresh baked cookies smell to it too, that… and hops… oh and chocolate.  T – Did I say the single best thing about it is the way it smells? Because it very well might be the way it tastes. On the palate the battle of flavors is even more pronounced than in the nose, chocolate and hops, malt and coffee, and CHOCOLATE AND HOPS and so much yes. The chocolaty goodness derives from the heavily roasted black malt giving it that kind of bittersweet essence, as well as espresso/coffee.  M – Full-bodied, silky, smooth, almost a little bit chewy, which is how I like my Imperial stouts, carbonation is very light, very right.  O - It’s just such a unique beer. I’m used to the imperial stout having that nice chocolate/coffee flavor going on, and even a little bit of hops like with the yeti imperial stout, but the hops in this compliment the beer in such an incredible way owing to their sheer overwhelming presence. But it works. Inexplicably it totally works, and the flavors come together and play off of one another to make one of the best beers out there. I’ve been told it’s North Coast’s best beer. Well I haven’t tried all of them yet but I’m inclined to agree. It’d be tough to beat this.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

In terms of appearance it's everything a stout should be deep black with an enduring and respectable but not thick head.  This beer is like drinking a malty dark chocolate bar. The malt and some fruitiness are first flavors you taste but the rich chocolate quickly assumes its role. This beer is seriously delicious.

It pours as black as my ex-girlfriend's heart with a beautiful two finger head the color of the nougat inside of a three musketeers bar and leaves elaborate lacing inside the snifter that I poured it into. Smell is mainly coffee and chocolate. Mouthfeel is a satisying fullness without being thick. Taste is robust. A strong coffee taste dominates, but there is also roasted nuts, dark chocolate and being a high ABV, some alcohol on the finish. This is what a RIS should be, a standard of excellence.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

S: Strong notes of cocoa, espresso, brown sugar, and raisins. Great depth and complementing sweetness which really gives this brew a wonderful nose that really awakens the senses.  T: Leafy bitterness and dark bread add to the same characteristics found in the nose. The cocoa, espresso, brown sugar join hands with dark fruit which is mostly raisins and some plums all topped off with a warming alcohol finish.  M: Velvety smooth, warming alcohol, and ample carbonation. Overall medium mouthfeel which is appropriate but not quite excellent.  O: A classic stout which represents the style well.

112,412,iannutter,4.35,"Bought in a six pack in Boulder, CO  First off, this is what a dark beer ought to look like. The head is extremely velvety, and though it thins out throughout the drinking process, it always retains some and the lacing is beautiful.  The smell of dark, dark roasted malts pervades the entire fragance of this beer, and they are certainly tasty smelling malts.  The flavour of this beer is dominated primarily by the same malts prevalent in the nose and truly remind me of dark roast coffee. The flavour of alcohol is certainly also prevalent in this brew, albeit not so much so, that it is overpowering. Rather, it actually complements the coffee flavour  The mouthfeel is exactly as every beer ought to have. The water for this beer is certainly of high quality and is extremely soft on the palate.  A great beer, would certainly buy again",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,BobZ,4,"12oz bottle poured into my Duvel tulip.  Appearance: Almost black with a dense 1/2” head that recedes to thin cap. Nice lacing.  Smell: As expected for a RIS roasted malt, strong coffee, and chocolate.  Taste: The richness of the roast comes forward with all of the chocolate and coffee plus the added warmth provided by the ABV. Not really getting any other flavors other than the mocha.  Mouthfeel: Clean on the palate with the warmth of the alcohol and the bitterness combining at the finish.  Overall: Very good RIS, the alcohol is not completely masked; however, it is also not unpleasant and the alcoholic warmth adds to the flavor of the beer.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

I had expected it to be a bit thicker and fuller bodied.  O: A very good beer. My only complaint is that it was not thicker.

Mild peanut butter scent. A bit floral for the the style. A bit crystal-y malty on the nose...  Very deep and dark without being overly heavy with chocolate or roasty nutty-ness. Carbonation is a bet extreme. Bitterness starts smooth and sharply turns to the ladder, but it ends very nicely leaving you wanting more.

Rich chocolate and molasses notes take the foreground with just a touch of nuttiness on the periphery. Strong blast of the alcohol here, but that could be the snifter talking.  T: Strong burnt quality up front that transitions seamlessly to malts, malts, and malts. The sweetness is cut nicely by the alcohol and everything just comes together beautifully. Synergy is a word that comes to mind.  MF: I could savor this goodness all day long. This is my ideal when it comes to carbonation level and thickness. Bold enough to be called an Russian Imperial, but not heavy and syrupy like so many I've tried have been. This is how it should be done.  O: I don't know what I love more; how delicious this beer is, or how it's freaking EVERYWHERE. This is more than a beer.

112,412,thrash420,5,"This is the only beer I would ever give a perfect score to. Never before has such a masterpiece been crafted. It is said that one even gains intelligence from drinking this wonderful brew.  A: Oh man the waiter brought me a schooner of motor oil again, atop sat an inch of thick tan head. As I sipped, it laced amazingly. When the whole 16oz was gone, it was still laced head to toe like a magnificent art piece.  S: Deep roasted hops with caramel and coffee aromas with light spices filled my senses, followed by a barely noticeable alcohol smell. It was delectable and made my mouth water.  T: Given the alcohol content and other imperials I've had, I expected a much more bitter harsher taste. This was quite the opposite, it was smooth and delicious, very easy to drink and enjoy. An amateur beer drinker could enjoy this just as much as our seasoned vets.  M: This would have only felt better in my mouth if it was vagina. It wasnt sticky, wasn't too thick nor too thin.

112,412,smalenberg,4.3,"A - Pours the beautiful black of used motor oil and only a little thinner. Very little carbonation in evidence - just a thin ring of very small tan bubbles.  S - Notes of coffee, chocolate, and a bitter hint come through a powerful malty sweetness that also carries a somewhat fruity character. Brings to mind dark chocolate covered raspberries. There is a lot going on here and it is well worth letting the beer warm a bit to experience it all.  T - Strong roasted malt is quite reminiscent of a really good coffee (sort of like Turkish). Bitterness seems nearly entirely from the dark malt (perhaps black patent) without a distinct hop character in evidence. Not as dry as you might expect with the fruit notes coming through late. Very enjoyable.  M - More carbonation that the pour might lead to you expect. Slightly oily with a viscous coating left on the roof of the mouth and the tongue after swallowing that lets the flavor linger for a long time.  O - A wonderful example of the style worthy revisiting frequently.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

S - Nice roasty malty aroma. No discernible hops.  T - Sweet and dark caramel notes. Followed up by a bitter smoky roastiness and lingering astringent bitterness in the finish. A nice roasted smoke flavor lingers for a while. Despite the high alcohol, there isn't much alcohol heat in this one.  M - Full-bodied with low carbonation.  O - An exceptionally drinkable and well-balanced beer. I'm not a big stout drinker, but this one is exceptional.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,moistnugget,4.88,"This beer pours into an almost obsidian black, with a thick, tan head that develops on top, leaving slight lacing. Perfect. Smell, to my nose, is of roasted coffee and chocolate notes, with a definite booziness.  Taste is absolutely wonderful. A very powerful and richly roasted malt is upfront; it has quite a kick. This melds into a bitter chocolate middle that smooths as you to sip away. This has a LONG, tasty aftertaste of dark grains, espresso, and more bittersweet chocolate notes. The feel thick and creamy, with a pleasant warming quality that sticks around long with the aftertaste.  Overall: This is an incredible stout.

There is some bitter bakers chocolate in there with a little bit of fudge.  T: The taste follows the nose but is a tad more complex. Nice roasted malts and bitter bakers chocolate up front. Sweet dark fruits are more present in the taste, almost like a caramel glazed prune. As the beer warms it gets a little sweet with some milk chocolate presents itself in the finish.  M: Medium bodied with a little chew. Nice creamy mouthfeel with a medium carbonation level.  O: Very great balance of roast, chocolate and sweetness.

Yes.  you can smell the bitterness, a roasted malt bitterness smell. So roasty and sexy. Black coffee esque.  Very strong roasty flavor. A nice chocolate backdrop. You taste all 9%.  bitter, seemingly a lot coming from the malt. The head stays to make it more drinkable. Good body.  been months since I've had one. I love it more than ever.

112,412,Darkmagus82,4.47,"Poured from bottle into snifter  Appearance – Pours a pitch black brew with a one finger mocha colored head. The head fades relatively fast to leave a persistent film on the top of the brew and some light lacing on the sides of the glass.  Smell – A wonderful aroma of chocolate, dark fruits of prune and raisin and a good roasted malt are the base of the smell. Mixed with these heavy and delicious aromas are some lighter coffee and a warming alcohol aroma. Quite nice.  Taste – The taste begins heavy of roasted malt, some semi-sweet cocoa, and a lighter dark fruit flavors. As the taste advances flavors of coffee begin working their way into the taste. As this occurs the sweetness fades and the flavor of the beer bitters more. At the end of the taste, the roasted flavor gets even stronger and are matched by a now bitter dark chocolate flavor and some hop flavors. When these flavors mix with a nice presence of alcohol flavor, it creates a nice bitter, roasty, and warming feel on the tongue.  Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is thick and creamy with some chewiness. The carbonation level is on the just below average side. The thick and creamy body is fantastic for all the dark flavors and when combined with the alcohol taste, it creates a smooth warming feel on the tongue.  Overall – This is on fantastic brew. Its one I have had many times and will continue to go back to. Overall nicely roasty with good flavor transitions, a great smell and feel as well as a pleasant warming feel.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Ample coffee bitterness at the finish. This is a very good beer.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Jwicker,4.61,"Bought from Randall's in fairview heights, IL, 4 pack for 10$, surprisingly a great deal. Among stouts, Russian imperial are my favorite, and among imperial stouts, old rasputin is my favorite. Oh man, where to begin with this brilliant beverage. The jet black appearance lets you know as soon as you pop open that bottle, you're in for a wild ride. I usually pour this into my special stout glass. The look is just great. Once poured, a dark tan foam more delicious than any cappuccino you have ever seen, immediately covers the top of the drink. Once you start drinking a glass of this, a wonderful division of carbonation fills your mouth from drink one until done. -THE SMELL is very faint for me, then again it may be because I'm getting really buzzed after one bottle. But the main hints of fresh coffee grounds and chocolate syrup definitely scream out. -THE TASTE is incredible. The first time I had this I was amazed. VERY dark, and VERY strong taste. Kick in the nuts at first, but it's Beautiful. In detail, it tastes like I'm drinking a slightly hoppy iced mocha with extra dark expresso shots. Very delicious. -THE FEEL is pretty heavy. This stout is thick and it will set nicely. An instant warmer. Leaves a nice strong taste In your mouth. I always look forward to getting some more Rasputin. Incredible stout.

Upon opening, my dog began to bark and ran under the house as the heady aroma of coffee grounds, bacon drippings hops and Hershey’s chocolate syrup filled the air. Oh, I forgot to take the trash out again.  This stuff goes down smooth, like molasses on corn bread, or white on rice. The +8% alcohol content makes it easy to brag to my wife, “I’m just having one, dear, I’ll do the dishes after Sports Center is over.” And the check is in the mail.  And such clever package design. Is that the Giant's closer Brian Wilson on the label or Karl Marx?  This is sipping beer and I drink slow so the last two inches in the bottom get pretty warm.

S: The strong, rich aroma of dark roasted grains and unsweetened chocolate dominate the aroma with and underling aroma of prunes and alcohol. There is a moderate citrus hops aroma.  T: Again a rich roasted malt and alcohol dominate backed up by flavors of roasted coffee beans, bittersweet chocolate and a dark fruity ester mainly of plums. There is a moderate hop bitterness with the balance being bitter and roasted. There is some malt sweetness mid-palate but it is overtaken by a hops and dark grain bitterness with unsweetened chocolate and roastiness lingering into the aftertaste.  M: A silk, smooth and creamy full bodied beer with moderately-light carbonation. There isn't as much warmth as the nose suggests but it is definitely there.  O: Dessert in a glass at least for me it is but there isn't much sweetness which suits me fine.

112,412,raynmoon,4.29,"Finally reviewing this one. This was the first Imperial Stout I ever had, and a classic.  It is super dark, no light or red hues were coming through when I held it up to the light. You can see the carbonation coming up from glass as well, lots of it. Beautiful lacing.  It smells like a stout. It has that whole Java, Mocha thing going on. The beer is still a little cold though. It has this slight fruitiness that I cannot quite describe but just brings back memories of when I first had this.  This beer is pretty bitter, and it burns. It almost reminds me of a Black IPA or something. You definitely pick up on that hop bitterness character, which leads to a creamy, alcoholic finish, which definitely defines the style I think.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,BrownAleMale,4.16,"12 oz bottle poured into Horny Goat pint glass  Appearance- Beautiful blacker then black beer with fluffy brownish white head. Like a rootbeer float.  Smell- Lots of burnt coffee and slight touch of dark fruit hits the nostrils.  Taste- Roasty malty chocolaty. Everything you expect from a Imperial stout. Nice hop finish for good balance.  Mouthfeel- This is probably the only lacking quality in this beer. It had to much of a watery mouthfeel, not a silky feel that I've come accustomed to with good Imperial stouts.  Overall- It just all works. The malt, the roasty qualities and the nice offset of hops. The abv is masked very nicely and this becomes a session beer of sorts with the lighter mouthfeel.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

I was looking for something with a robust flavor and certainly hit the mark with this one. The smell was bold and pleasing suggesting lots of potential in the taste.  My first reaction to the taste was "" too bitter"" but that is not really the whole story. It's kind of like the first time I tasted bakers chocolate as a kid. After the initial nose wrinkle the fullness and richness of the flavor comes through and is quite pleasnt.  Down side: The after taste lingers longer than I like.

112,412,Nugganooch,4.28,"Notes from 08/17/12 12oz bottle to my FW snifter  A: Pours a deep and dense dark color that appears black at first gaze. Shows more of a dark chestnut brown around the edges. Nice thick head of brown butter cream that holds tight with micro bubbles eventually receding to just a swirl. Some light streaks of lace.  S: The aroma opens with a real nice brownie batter chocolate sweetness that melds with dark roasted grains, burnt caramels, some smoky char and a light licorice note. There is a hint of warming booze noted as well.  T: Flavors open with robust blackened malts, dark chocolate truffles, and notes of toffee. I get a touch of licorice in the background combined with some ashy char and wet earthy woods. There is an upper level of bitterness as this is darn hoppy and some elements of pine throughout. Bitter but nicely balanced. Sharp alcoholic kick in the end. Such a good off-the-shelf stout. Intensely flavored.  M: Feel is quite frothy lending a somewhat lighter feel. Just super creamy and silky smooth. Body is fair and quite even for an Impy. Has a great oily coating.  D: A classic take on the American RIS. Very approachable in that it offers some real nice balance. Rich and robust with dark roast flavors. Nice hoppy presence. A bit of a sipper that you will find goes down quite smooth.

This beer however, Old Rasputin Imperial Stout, has completely changed my opinion in regards to the Stout category.  Appearance : Poured a deep robust black/brown color with around a centimeter and half of thick tan head, which as it emptied, left several dense layers of foam.  Smell : A rich melody of chocolate, coffee and what I assume was the residuals of alcohol. Simple, yet very enjoyable.  Taste : A sophisticated yet conservative mix of chocolate, black coffee and possibly toffee? It's taste is mysterious yet familiar and is one of my favorite aspects of this beer.  Mouth : The first sips are in my opinion the most enjoyable. The thick foamy head acts as an appetizer to an entirely delicious dark beer , combined with a sturdy 9% alch by vol rating which leaves nothing to be desired.  Overall : It may seem as though I am gushing over this beer and frankly that is because I am.

112,412,GuitarRob22,5,"I have had this beer on-tap and from the bottle and I have to say, this is what a stout is all about. Dark chocolaty and bold. The 75+ IBUs and 9% alcohol are hidden behind a fantastic flavor. The head is tan and allows for fantastic aromatherapy while drinking. Highly recommended.  From the bottle this beer does seem to be lacking some of the finer details of flavor found when it is on-tap.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,LiquidAmber,4.73,"Poured pure black with a nitro draft head. Mild dark fruit and malt aroma. Absolutely smooth with a slightly sweet flavor.

112,412,TheRealBigC,4.31,"Old Rasputin stands as being the creamiest imperial stout in my experience thus far. It's quite interesting - the alcohol is noticeable and there is a touch of hops in there as well, but the foamy head and rich body come closer to a Young's stout than, say, the Stone Imperial Stout. And indeed, there is a chocolate profile which makes for a tasty, tasty beer. The only downside for me was the lack of strength of smell. I got some whiffs of malt and chocolate, but it didn't knock me back. I'll blame it on the glassware choice of the bar (regular pint glass) and not dock too much for it.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,GR_Rick,4.23,"A: Nice and dark brown; can't get any light through the beer. Poured with a nice big tan colored head that stayed around quite a while and left significant lacing on the glass.  S: Smells nice and sweet (perhaps a little brown sugar or caramel) for such a big, heavy stout. Hints of chocolate and roasty malt. Not as aromatic as I prefer, but a good smelling beer.  T: Not overly complex flavor, but nice and mild for the style. Easy drinking flavor without too much alcohol until the finish, where you first get a little bit of sweetness (chocolate?), and then just a hint of lingering bitterness.  M: Not much to say,but this is where the beer shines for me. Very nice, full, creamy feel. Nice and smooth, exactly like I would hope for.  O: An excellent beer, that's very easy to drink for such a big and dark style. Nothing here stands out in the plethora of ""barrel aged"" and ""specialty"" imperial stouts, but I can't find anything wrong with it either. This is a very solid offering for those seeking something that is brewed to style, relatively easy to drink, and not over done with the ABV or complexity in flavors.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,rangerred,3.72,"Had on nitro at mellow mushroom in Johnson City, TN  Arrived looking like a typical nitro pour with an off-white creamy head. Body was solid black.  Aroma had pleasant notes of coffee and dark chocolate. Also a slight hint of smoke in there.  The flavor had loads of cocoa and a slight bit of coffee. Lots of roasted malt and unfortunately, a decent amount of alcohol. I kind of feel like the nitro may have hindered the flavor somewhat because I didn't find this all that spectacular.

Light lacing clings tightly to the glass in random places.  Rich, dark roasted malt starts the beginning of this aromatic journey. A little raisin sweetness helps the transition into a coffee/chocolate mix, and alcohol tops it all off.  Dark roasted malt and that raisin hint start her off. Chocolate peeks its head in, then transitions to a smooth and delicious coffee flavor. Topped off with the perfect amount of alcohol and dark chocolate at the end.  Smooth beer. Medium to heavy bodied, the carbonation isn't noticeable other than as an assistant in the task of helping move this along. Not that I want it to go to fast.

Love the chocolatyness of this brew. Very robust.  T: Real dark and malty taste, heavy with chocolate and coffee. Leaves a real roasted malt taste in your mouth. A little hop makes an appearance at the end, but overall it remains very balanced.  M: Lighter on the palate than expected, fairly low in carbonation.

112,412,TheCondor,4.33,"Ok so I had a filling done the other day, and the anesthetic had worn off later in the night. My tooth was slamming, and of course I had a fridge full of beers waiting to be drank. So I decided to drink the one with the highest ABV in there (minus the barley wine I am aging), which was old Rasputin. This review may be a little more brief than most of mine, but that's because i am doing on my iPad sitting in an airport from tape recorded notes.  Side poured with standard vigor from a bottle into a tulip glass.  Appearance - cool looking bottle, love the packaging. Pours a jet black with zero transparency, having a nice two finger mocha head that hangs around for some time and leaves excellent lacing almost through the entire drink.  Smell - Roasted and charred malts are the big boys, but it has dark fruits, coffee, and some chocolate hints as well. A little oak smell in there, and a nice accompaniment of booze to round it out!  Taste - matches the aroma almost exactly. The big roasted, charred malts get you and hold your palate, while the other favors and scents mingle in with them. Chocolate, oak, dark fruits, and booze all make an appearance. Excellent taste  Mouthfeel - Finishes creamy and thick, with a nice warming finish because of the booze level. Medium carbonation.  Overall - Highly recommended. I will absolutely buy and drink this again. I have already recommended it to people who have not had it yet. Very very good beer, I strongly suggest you go get some. Good value too.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Smell: Great roasted malt, toffee, chocolate, and herbal hops aroma  Taste: Roasted malt, dark caramel/toffee are up-front, alcohol is not as apparent as 9% would lead one to believe. Excellent.  Mouthfeel: Carbonation is just right; maybe a bit too prickly. Not too thick or thin. Very good.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,srv33,4.87,"Very dark amber pour, almost no head. fine lacing. Rich complex smells of dark chocolate, bourbon, a hint of mint, and caramel. Taste is beautifully complex, multilayered. First notes of chocolate and bourbon, then a bit of leather, light tobacco, mellowing to caramel. Tastes like KBS's brother. As a result I like it just about the same! Its a little more mellow, though, which in some ways I like more, though on the other hand KBS is more rich.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Great retention and truly beautiful lacing.  S: Smells of a malty pang. Chocolaty with slight coffee scent and a hint of some dark fruits. Sweet and tangy in the initial whiff with slight roasted and chocolate malts present.  T: WOW - smooth chocolate taste from the roasted malts. A slight coffee aftertaste. I don't get much of the dark fruit that I thought I was smelling. Its blend of chocolate and coffee flavorings which work really well. VERY tasty. I better be careful with this one - at 9% - it's no chump!  M: Medium to full bodied creamy mouthfeel. Lovely syrup sensation that adds to the rich deep flavour. A hint of sweetness complemented with tasty dark chocolaty bitterness. A solid RIS mouthfeel with a perfect balance between sweetness and chocolate/coffee bitterness.  O: Bottom line - at $8.99 for a 12 oz 4-pack, this is a gem in the rough!! Appearance, smell, taste and mouthfeel are above average. This brew is in a league of its own; everything that is better than what's harder to find year round and more expensive, but damn near comparable in every other department.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

S: very powerful, strongly present scent overall.. chocolate and coffee with sweet malty hints. T: wow. very full-bodied, matches the smell quite closely. Chocolate/coffee combination fades to sweet malt with tiniest hing of hops.. the alcohol comes through but powerful flavor largely distracts me from noticing the alcohol presence at first. aftertaste is elegant mix of both sweet and bitter chocolate. M: thick, yet fairly smooth for the heavy taste- medium/low carbonation. O: excellent.. a great Russian Imperial Stout, one of the best of the style IMO. Multiple strong flavors balance well- no one flavor overpowers the others (including the alcohol content).

S:  Decadent aroma with roasted malts, dark chocolate, espresso beans, molasses, and oak.   T/M:  Taste follows the nose and delivers a nice alcohol sting to cut the sweetness. Bitterness is mild but has nice earthy qualities. Small amount of cherry alcohol lingers in the back of the throat.  Full creamy body with a splash of carbonation. Finish is dry with some chalkiness and leaves behind dark cocoa and bitter coffee.   O:  This is one of my favorite RIS because it's quite delicious and it's hands down cheaper than anything else.

Appearance: Pours a perfect black with a near-perfect latte-colored head that slowly creeps up and down the side of the glass without much retention  Smell: Notes of chocolate, coffee, anise, and smoke. Big bold nose, very typical of an imperial stout. The sweet chocolate dominates the nose  Taste: Big notes of chocolate and coffee, some other candy sweetness, perhaps caramel. Smaller amounts of anise and smoke. Lingering bitterness. Well balanced flavors, true to the style  Mouthfeel: Thick and substantial, creamy and smooth, with average to below-average carbonation  Overall: A great brew. It's not a style that I'm particularly familiar with, so I don't have a whole lot to hold it up against, but it's certainly very enjoyable in its own right. I imagine (and other opinions confirm) that this would age well. Absolutely worth a shot  Addendum (7/14/2012): I believe that, for the quality of the beer relative to price, this is the best value IRS you can find.

Nose is dark, substantial, sweet, aged with moderate alcohol presence and roasted malt (need I tell?). Taste is strong, cooked, char-like coffee, dark chocolate, some dried fruit and plum-like flavors, and ethanol prominence, but well balanced with a bitterness that is decidedly not really a hoppy kind of bitterness after all. Taste profile does not modulate considerably over time. Mouth-feel is meal-like, substantive and filling. Pleasant overall, but I'm not so much big on the style, thinking I need to have a more refined taste in cheese to go along with this steak-of-a-beer-like brew.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,B33R501,4.24,"always good to revisit an old favorite, last week was troegenator, week before siberian night, these are all 3 outstanding beers at great value.  standard opaque black, huge, thick head, lots of bubbles and gorgeous chocolate mocha color. absolutely the best head ive seen on any beer.  aroma just ok, roast and a little smoke, but nice and rich. the head tastes like chocolate marshmallow, leading to nice dark roast, lots of hops mid palate and in the finish that lingers for quite some time. nicely bitter and the hops complement rather than overpower the beer. the mouthfeel gets a little oily and slick, and my impression last night was the first 12 oz were better than the second 12, but couple years ago i would think nothing of going thru a 4 pak in one night. now i settle for two, and thankfully pass on the hangover.  overall very good, very satisfying, but i like siberian night a little better.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Momar42,4.01,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into New Belgium globe  Had this one several times in the distant past, time to revisit and rate so here goes:  A - thick, billowy dark tan head. Good retention and nice lacing. Seeing how good it pours makes me glad I came back to it.  S - bitter chocolate struggles to make it past the large nose of char. Burnt wood and roasted malt make a slightly smaller nose than I had anticipated.  T - roasted malt makes the first impression along with the char on the tongue as well. There is a mild bitterness that balances this RIS. Finishes pretty fast and suprisingly clean. I had hoped for more complexity but it is solid nonetheless.  M - medium at best. Not cloying at all and far less full than I would have guessed. The moderate carbonation cuts the mouthfeel down. For an RIS it finishes remarkably clean.  O - first off Old Rasputin is a damn good beer and really good RIS. One of the older players in this heavily BA category, it still holds itself well against the young bucks. It is very solid for the style if fairly unremarkable. Dont mistake this as average, of which it certainly isnt. Old Rasputin just doesnt knock your socks off in any particular way. But, considering its large distribution area, year round availability, relatively cheap price point and is considerably better than MOST breweries RIS, you could do far far worse.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Nice bittersweet plum and dark chocolate up front. Notes of cherry, coffee, smoke, anise and burnt wood. Great blend of all the flavors I expect in a Russian imperial stout. Alcohol is lurking in the background but never dominates.   Creamy medium full feel with moderate carbonation. Long bitter cocoa malty aftertaste.   A truly classic Russian imperial stout. It is the standard to which I hold all others. It's not the best around by any means but it's readily available enough that if a stout isn't at least this good, it has no business in my cellar.

No light can escape this black hole of a beer. It leaves reams of thick creamy head on the glass with some light lacing as well. The nitro gives this beer a more evened out nose but also pulls away from some of the aromatics. It still smells great with a smoky coffee and fresh baked chocolate chip cookie. There is a hint of alcohol on the nose but not overwhelming. The taste is very nice. I love what a nitro does to a good stout. The beer is slightly sweet with some bitter malt flavor melding well with some well placed hop bitterness that takes a slightly woody taste. The mouthfeel is creamy and full bodied. Very slight alcohol burn. I really like this beer and I think the nitro is a different experience for an already world class beer.,North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,MaximalC,4.23,"Pours seal brown with a bountiful mocha head composed of fairly large bubbles. Plenty of lacing lingers as the head recedes. Aroma is very present; a bountiful blend of chocolate, alchol, and hops. Roasted malt and bitter hops are at the forefront flavor-wise, with some chocolate and coffee playing more of a complementary role. Alcoholic warmth comes through in the finish, along with lingering bitterness. This is actually a little hoppier than I prefer a stout to be, but not surprising for a west coast offering. Either way, the bitterness is not outrageous, and it still leaves enough room for the lovely roasted malt to be appreciated. There's also a good amount of carbonation that lends a velvety texture to the brew. The thickness here is about right for a RIS, and the lingering stickiness gets my stamp of approval as well. Old Rasputin is certainly a tasty beer, though the slightly excessive bitterness keeps it from quite living up to the gorgeous presentation.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,gregy55902,4.23,"From what I have experienced North Coast Brewing is fairly hit or miss, but I consider this to be their finest brew. Reviewed live.  A = Pours a nearly-black dark brown into my XL snifter. One finger tan head recedes after 90 seconds leaving a ring of bubbles around the glass; in the glass it is completely opaque black.  S = Roasted malts, hops, dark chocolate, roasted coffee, and a hint of anise (in that order).  T = Follows the nose. More hoppy than your average imperial stout, but it gives this stout a 'refreshing' aspect that is not common with other stouts. While the coffee and chocolate flavors are experienced last on the tongue, their lasting power is strong and very nice.  M = Decently thick and chewy. Alcohol is very well hidden, and the carbonation is appropriate.  O - I love imperial stouts (perhaps too much), and more often than not I am disappointed by what I find. However, if I am disappointed by one beer, I can always get some Old Rasputin to put a smile back on my face. This beer isn't overly complex, but it is executed very well.

Head stays intact all the way down the glass. Leaves behind a substantial web of lacing on the top half of the glass and some splotches on the bottom.  S - Dark, bitter chocolate with plenty of hops and a touch of plume.  T - A bit of bitter chocolate upfront. The body is a wonderful balance between dark and fruity hop notes (plum and fig) and a generous dose of chocolate malt that diminishes as the beer expands. Everything briefly shuts off as the beer passes over the back of the tongue before a vigorous finish of dark rum, burnt chocolate malt and dark fruit, leather, and cigarettes explodes in the mouth.  M - A fair amount of carbonation gives the beer a creamy mouthfeel that causes the beer to expand and change flavor as it sits in the mouth. On the lighter side of heavier bodied which seems to suite it well.  Old Rasputin has become a benchmark for the Russian Imperial stout style since it its introduction in the late 80's. And that benchmark holds - this is one of the best examples of the style i've had in quite some time. From the near textbook appearance to the intense and deliciously complex flavor, this beer does everything well. It's a keeper that I hope to have around often. Glad to have finally tried it.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Simple but enjoyable.  T - Chocolate, booze, chocolate covered coffee beans. layers of chocolate and roastiness.  M - Really smooth, mild carbonation and a medium to full body.  O/D - Nice but lacking depth. Don't get me wrong though, this was a good Impy Stout and really easy to drink.

S - Roasty malts, oak, coffee creamer, and trace amounts of pine.  T - Robust malt profile with burnt chocolate, wort, bitter coffee, and candied pecans. Starts sweet and moves towards bitter with a little bit of pine on the aftertaste. Very good stout.  M - Very smooth with great carbonation and a medium feel.  O - This is a staple in my fridge. Roasty is what comes to mind as far as flavor and aroma. The price is a bonus here and I always appreciate it when imperial stouts are offered in 12 oz. bottles.

T..Toffee, coffee and chocolate flavors, all of which are more complex than anticipated. Great smokey taste, just great!  M..Very easy to drink considering the high ABV and style.

112,412,Maxwell,4.44,"Appearance: Pours a coffee black. Huge tan head that reminds me of whip cream and maple syrup and lasts forever. Ever so slight amber coloring in the glass, but no light is escaping from it, it is a black abyss. Lacing is thick and frothy, like the fangs of the ocean, or sea-foam wallowing in a tidal pool. It sticks to the glass nicely and stays for quite some time.  Smell: Smells of a malty pang. Sweet and tangy in the initial whiff with slight roasted and chocolate malts present.  Taste: Very smoky on the tongue, far more so than I got from the smell. Sweeter malts can be found in the aftertaste, but for the most part the roasted malts power through with lots of thick smoke. Vanilla notes can be found in the background character.  Mouthfeel: Light and frothy, but a little harsh with smoky power of the malts. Fairly bubbly, too, on the tongue, with a long and bitter smoke aftertaste. Sits a little thickly in the stomach, as is expected with the style. Nice Russian Imperial Stout.  Overall: I like this beer. Its smoky like a boy scout’s campfire, carries a lighter ABV for an imperial stout but still plenty of alcohol, and it fits the style well.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,drtth,4.41,"The beer pours out into an Imperial Pint glass a totally black liquid with a 1"" head that leaves lots of lacing as it slowly recedes to a thin layer of foam on the liquid. Sipping creates interesting patterns of lacing.  The aromas include the roasted malt, some chocolate and coffee.  The flavors are strong and intense with the chocolate and coffee. There's also a lot of dark roasted malt mingled with both a light touch of sweetness from the malt and bitterness that seems almost as much from the roasted malt as from the hops. Towards the end of the finish there's still some chocolate and some hop bitterness.  The mouthfeel is on the full side of medium bodied and a bit creamy with the moderate carbonation.  Definitely a drinkable beer, especially for one this full of intense flavors. I could easily have another and will be revisiting this beer.

112,412,Titans77,4.36,"A - RIS black, dark as night. A light mocha colored 2 finger head that quickly dissipated to a light black film. Moderately carbonated.  S - Chocolaty with slight coffee scent. Roasted malts and a hint of some dark fruits. Expected it to come off stronger scented, but even after letting it warm up a bit, it doesn't impress me too much.  T - First thing to hit you is a smooth chocolate taste from the roasted malts. A slight coffee aftertaste. I don't get much of the dark fruit that I thought I was smelling. Its blend of chocolate and coffee flavorings work really well. Not too dominant, but very tasty. No presence of alcohol in my tasting, which is pretty awesome at 9% abv  M - Medium bodied, which threw me for a loop at first. Expected it to be a full bodied brew. Smooth silky feeling coats the mouth with a perfect amount of carbonation. Solid RIS mouthfeel.  O - This beer is better than the sum of its parts! Appearance, smell, taste and mouthfeel are above average, but nothing really special. It translates to something that comes together very specially. Its so readily available, cheap and tasty. This brew is in a league of its own. Everything that is better than it is harder to find year round and more expensive, but damn near comparable in every other department.  Edit: 1 year old aged Old Rasputin  A - Same  S - Almost the same, more chocolate to it.  T - Chocolate milk with some coffee and vanilla finish. Amazing stuff.  M - Smooth. I had this on nitro, which was amazing. The bottle aged is still really solid. Full bodied with an amazingly thick finish. Great stuff.  O - Aged 1 year puts this stuff into world class range. Amazing fresh, even better aged. My favorite bargain stout!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,trumpy,3.95,"Second time trying this Stout, and its a nice beer. Close enough to jet black in colour, but the head is a light off white. it hangs around for a fair time though. Nose is coffee, dark chocolate, with a hint of the alcohol. In the mouth its all creamy aniseed with a roasted coffee aftertaste that ends with nice bitterness. The mouthfeel is pretty good, the carbonation is mild and suits the style. If you swill it around like you would a wine, then its actually pretty creamy. There is a definate hit of warm alcohol at the back end though, but thats not a surprise. A nice stout to sip, but just shaded by Green flash double stout. I saw another review that said it was USD $8.99 a 4 pack! here in Australia its $8 a bottle! WTF!!  Seriously though, its great to see this style of beer available here now.

Taste is bitter roasted malt, with accents of dark chocolate, dates, sugar cookies, dark coffee, nuts, and earthy hops. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy, good amount of carbonation, but you can feel the alcohol.  Nice, heavy beer.

Some hints of dark fruit and subtle wet earth.  T: Big flavours and not for the timid. Deep malts and molasses with coco. A bit of acidic coffee, which balances off the rich flavours well. Despite the malt flavour there is a good hit of hops from start to finish.  M: Full bodied and low carbonation, lovely syrup sensation that adds to the rich deep flavour.  O: This beer is rich and complex, it pair incredibly well with dark chocolate. Fantastic thick and flavourful brew that will knock you off your seat if you forget your drinking a 9% brew.

The aroma was wonderfully robust with a burnt dark bread malt and a moderate dose of a leathery yeast with notes of molasses, dark chocolate, roasted coffee and a decent scent of alcohol.  The taste started with a very mild sweetness that was slightly subdued by a rich bitterness and had notes of dark chocolate and molasses. Then it became extremely bitter and mildly acidic with notes of vanilla and coffee and a strong alcohol presence towards the end. The flavor hung around for a very long time letting the taste of an alcohol infused espresso settle in nicely on the taste buds.

This tasting was totally different. It was served at about 50-55, which makes a big difference. The color is a dark chocolate, with a four fingered head and a slight honey smell.  The mouth feel is a bit carbonated and more malty with warming.  The highlight of this beer is its finish: a complex nutty lemon, chocolate mixed with dark coffee.

Ground coffee, maybe a lite espresso, cream, roasted malt - all the usual suspects.  Lovely sweet chocolate entry followed by a great roasted espresso burst. Really enjoyable brew. Finish is long and bitter, with that sweet chocolate making another appearance.  Velvety feel, light carbonation, somewhat creamy. Coats the tongue well.

S - Rich roasted malts complimented by sweet chocolate and coffee. Seems to have some light grape in the background alongside some caramel.  T - A unique RIS which is bold while having an almost milky composition. The initial rush is of sweet chocolate and caramel while quickly dissipating into bitter hops and roasted malts. The progression is quick fast and concludes with notes of espresso and softer chocolate. I also feel as the beer warms the flavors become more prominent and a little bit of heat reveals itself from the ABV on the back end.  M - A smooth creamy stout with ideal carbonation.

Creamy dark tan nitro head, but much of the nitrogen movement within the beer had dissipated by the time I got the glass.  S: Coffee, dark cacao. Rich maltiness and a creamy sweetness. Not a huge aroma, but nice when you work at it a bit.  T: Sweet dark-roasted coffee, cacao, and big roasted malts without being overly bitter. Some toffee and a lactose-like sweetness throughout. Mild roasted bitterness in hang.  M: The body is on the thin side for style and the nitro-tap serving. Creamy mouthfeel, and alcohol is well-hidden for style.

Thick and creamy in the mouth, with a bit of light foaminess. Very warming.  One of the best stouts. It's sweet, as I prefer, but countered well by the heavy bitterness.

T: Starts out with a bitter hoppiness that is quickly followed by roasted malts, espresso, and dark and milk chocolate. The bitterness is a bit strong for me, but fortunately it's accompanied by great stout characteristics. As it warms, it gets better - the roast and chocolate become more apparent, and the bitterness less so.  M: Fairly thick with creamy carbonation.  O: A solid Russian Imperial Stout.

112,412,tylerprince,4.7,"A second Old Rasputin review. Had the pleasure of trying this on tap after a year of cellaring. DBGB, Bowery and Houston, NYC. This review is pretty much a copy of my first with some major changes:  A: Pours a beautiful matte black. No light gets through. After a cascade, a frothy 2-finger mocha head remains, with good retention. This gives way to a beautiful lacing.  S: Chocolate up front, roasted malts. Hop presence has certainly faded compared to the fresh bottle, and has been replaced by a coffee-like aroma. Much stronger than out of the bottle.  T: WOW. So much character, but still with all the flavors of a stout. Roasted malts and chocolate throughout, with coffee flavors much more powerful after the cellaring. The second 5.0 I have ever awarded for taste - this is simply perfect.  M: Creamy with just the right amount of carbonation. Finishes with some foam. Other stouts with this much flavor are generally sippers...this one is so smooth you can drink at your own leisure.  O: One of the best stouts I've tried.

A: A stellar looking beer that is ink vblack with a two finger tan head that lasts seemingly forever as a cap, lacing wonderfully all the while. S: A very interesting nose with initially a strong dose of liquorice and molasses off the top with a int of high alochos. The nose then mellows to a more chocolately / cocoa with a hint of cinnamon and pepper spice underlying it all. T: Loads of roasted barley and coffee notes initially that give way to a slightly sweet body and a strong earthy bitterness that builds over time. Notes of chocolate underlie the entire beer. Nice, and enjoyable not to have a super cloying RIS here. M: The mouthfeel here is a little odd. It is not thick and sticky like some RISes, but they somehow make it come across as almost watery. Super odd. The only thing that is holding this beer back. It needs to be a touch thicker as the bitterness and sweetness is well balanced. No fusels or high alcohols present here though!

Kind of an odd thing to give a high appearance on, but I think you know where I'm coming from on a stout like this. :-)  The carbonation was pretty much spot on, nice small bubbles. I think I was surprised by the smell, not as strong as I was expecting. A little charcoal and bitter chocolate aroma.  The taste was very smooth, not overpowering. Somehow, I was hoping for some more complexity to shine through, but the variety of subtle flavors was dominated in my nose by the charcoal taste.  I was surprised how masked that 9% is. Doesn't feel like it at all. I'm not sure I'd ever session an imperial stout, but it's as likely a candidate as you're gonna find.  Regardless, it's good stuff.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,onewetpaw,4.58,"A- The nose is a little understated. I get some coffee and roast.  A- Pitch black with a thin rich brown colored head.  F- Dark chocolate and deep roasty flavors are present. There's some bitterness, but it's subdued. Not harsh or overly astringent. The malt flavors are there, but not residual sweetness.  M- Low to average carbonation. Nice full body, without being cloying. Actually a pretty dry taste, like accented by the mild astrigent character of the roast malts.  O- An awesome beer. It's everything you could want in a Russian Imperial Stout. I love the fact that it's big and strong, but there's not a hot alcohol flavor and that the roast flavors are present, but the beer avoids being too harsh. It's a drinkable version that I'd come back to.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Alcohol present, with bitter chocolate, hops, and some fruit all present. The wonderful finish leaves chocolate upfront.  M- Fairly light for the style, with medium carbonation. Definitely goes down easier at warmer temperatures.

112,412,allforbetterbeer,4.1,"One of the most reviewed beers on here, and I have never tasted it. So here we go; fresh bottle poured into a snifter.  Totally black body. Even with a strong white light nothing penetrates save for a few dark brown highlights, but they are minimal. the head is brown and standard for the style.  Smells of hops soaked in dark wort, well roasted barley, black patent malt, and a touch of astringent coffee.  The flavor takes the coffee and dark wort-infused hops to a new level. Roast is big, smoke is very small. Coffee is big, chocolate is small. Actually I don't think there is any smoke in this flavor. Bold hops. Well done flavors that kick with grit but don't abuse the palate.  The mouthfeel is thick and full with low carbonation, which I think is spot on for the style.  Conclusion: I always imagined this to be a well rounded American version of this classic style, and it turns out to be exactly that. Worth the hype? Yes. Are there even better options out there? Yes.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Goblinmunkey7,3.7,"Appearance: Near black. Dark brown at edges when held to direct light. Head is dark tan and drops to a thin ring in short order. Nice notches of lacing. Pours heavy and viscous without looking syrupy.  Smell: Citrus rind and burnt malts. Super burnt. Roasty sweet with some solid char notes. Easily one of the hoppiest aromas I've encountered with the style. So many roasted malts. Alcohol is present and assertive. Old coffee and a slight cocoa finish.  Taste: Burnt malts. Roasted malts and then some. Old espresso and powdery cocoa. I swear it tastes like orange zest and chocolate malts. Hopped pretty heavily for the style. Burnt, char, and some lingering notes of tobacco. Sweet finish.  Mouthfeel: Thinner than the pour would indicate. Solid carbonation keeps things lively and moving. Lacks the heavier mouthfeel I like to see in the style. It works for the flavor profile.  Overall: It's good, but it's not the best on the market for the money. Nice char notes and some hop notes make things interesting. Decent, but that's as far as it goes.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,ThisWangsChung,4.25,"Re-review. Poured into an oversized wine glass.  A: Pours a textbook black color with very faints hints of a lighter brown shade near the edges. Retention from the mocha colored head is about average, but there are some nice rings of lacing left on the glass.  S: Big roast notes dominate the brew, with splotches of coffee, chocolate, hops, soy, and a touch of alcohol all around. Very hard to fault how this smells.  T: Compared with how I served the other bottles (refrigerator cold), chilling it lightly and allowing it to warm up really helped open up its character. Much like the smell, it's incredibly roasty, with lots of bitter dark chocolate, roasted malt, soy, with a noticeably hoppy finish that meshes extremely well. There's a little booze on the back end, but it never gets out of hand. The only real complaint I have is that it's not a paragon of perfect balance.  Even though it's a summery day with thunderstorms lurking around, sipping this somewhat out of season doesn't feel out of place - the hallmark of a great beer.  M: It's a little thin for an imperial stout, but it does a great job of coating the mouth like a proper RIS should. Sufficient carbonation, no more, no less.  O: This is a beer that screams ""serve me at the right temperature!"" Having it too cold will cause it to become far too bitter and hard to drink. Letting it warm up gives it a chance to show off some of its complexities. The fact that it's easy to find and a great value in the RIS world (got this 4 pack at $8.99, and I've seen it as low as $6.99 in VA) makes it panacea for those who don't/can't chase distribution trucks just to have a shot at purchasing KBS.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,ScruffySouthpaw,4.46,"Served in a tulip glass.  Appearance: Pitch black, tan head which measures to roughly 1/2"" off the body.  Smell: Dark chocolate, but not a potent scent like some other stouts I've had.  Taste: Seriously this is your beer store's best kept secret. Dark chocolate, bitter malts, in all seriousness potent in taste.  Mouth: With an after-taste to lust for, this beer has med-heavy carbonation that doesn't initially go down smoothly but after the second sip you appreciate a real beer like this.  Overall: Straight up, get this F'n beer. If you like stouts or someone who appreciates real beer, you will definitely not be disappointed.

112,412,NuclearDolphin,4.88,"Poured into a Pint Glass  Appearance - Jet/Opaque Black, so dark I can see my reflection very clearly on the glass. It's got a dark brown foamy head that builds up rather quickly once you star pouring it. The head and lacing retention is excellent, one of the best I have ever seen!  Smell - Rich Chocolate and Cocoa scents with some yeasts, coffee, and roasted malt notes. There are also hints of some fruity and butterscotch notes! It strikes a fine balance between Roast and Sweetness  Taste - Very rich chocolate with some surprisingly strong coffee notes. The flavor is backed up by a strong roasted malts along with sweet yeasts & fruity/butterscotch notes. I've had a few Russian Imperial Stouts, and this ranks right up there with Darkness in terms of flavor!  Mouthfeel - Pretty heavy in body, but the carbonation is light and it feels very smooth and creamy when drinking. This has got to be the smoothest and easiest to drink Russian Imperial Stout I have ever had!  Overall - To put it simply: Amazing. This is one time where I cannot find anything truly wrong with this beer! It's got a excellent look, smell and taste. To top it all off, it's incredibly easy to drink!

112,412,TheSixthRing,4.08,"Appearance - Pours a midnight black with a thick, tan 2-finger head that dies down into a thick, sticky lacing.  Smell - Roasty. Chocolate and coffee. A bit of astringent alcohol comes through as well.  Taste - Strong, dark and roasted bitter chocolate and coffee malts. Alcohol shines through mid-taste, before being devoured by the bitter aftertaste, which gets stronger the warmer the beer gets.  Mouthfeel - Thick and a bit intimidating. Almost hard to get down once the beer warms. Best to drink it while it's cold.  Overall - A classic, straight forward Russian Imperial. There's nothing fancy about this one, and sip after sip becomes a bit of a menacing chore, though a chore that's enjoyable in a masochistic sense. It's a beer that feels stronger than the 9% label would have you believe.

Lots of lacing and great head retention. Looks like a perfect RIS!  S - The nose is full of chocolate, roasted and slightly smoked malts. Hints of raisins and prunes and just a hint of alcohol. Smells very classic and yet very intriguing.  T - This must be love at first sip: starts out with a rich (and I mean RICH) chocolate and coffee flavour, with hints of smoke and vanilla. Then comes a pretty solid bitterness, with hints of bakers chocolate and prunes. Sweet, but not too sweet. In fact, the level of sweetness is almost ideal. Balanced and very robust!  M - Medium-to-full body. Very mild level of carbonation. Smooth and velvety on the palate. The alcohol is very well-masked in my opinion. This must be one of the most creamy and smooth Russian Imperial Stouts I've had.  O - This beer didn't disappoint! It's very close to perfection; the only thing I didn't fully enjoy was the almost-extreme level of roastiness, which starts showing after the beer warms up. All in all, this is a true classic and an excellent example of the style.

112,412,rickyleepotts,5,"I love the label. I didn’t know until I wrote the “what they said” for this beer that the label is actually Old Rasputin. Clever name… or clever label. Anyway, I have seen this beer before, but I am not sure I have had it. But since we have so many stouts in the fridge I figured we would go ahead and drink another one tonight. This one has a pretty big ABV and the word “imperial” usually excites me. Let’s see what she has to offer.  In the Glass: The beer is pitch black in the glass. It has a creamy head on it with a thin lace that tries to hang on… but just drips all the way down as you swirl it in the glass. But the beer is dark as night.  Nose: I could smell this beer as soon as I popped the top. It smells VERY sweet, fruity, and a hint of salty caramel there at the end. It smells so good I don’t even want to drink it. This beer better taste as good as it smells, because I am sick of beers not tasting close to what they smell. Anyway, let’s see if it lives up.  Flavor: The beer is VERY smooth. Holy cow, there is hardly any carbonation in this beer. I didn’t want there to be either. Maybe that’s what the “imperial” means. When the beer first hits your lips it goes in smooth, and just dances across your palate leaving hints of honey, chocolate, and coffee all over your tongue. Holy crap, this beer is delicious.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel on this is like a parade in your mouth. You can use that… because as soon as you drink this you will see what I mean. The beer is somewhat creamy, and frothy and just slowly coats the tongue to give your mouth a ton of flavor. The beer has very little carbonation, and when you swallow the most bubbles come out as the beer takes you to aftertaste.  Aftertaste: I like an aftertaste that sticks around. This one does. For a LONG time. At first it’s cold and sweet, then it quickly turns dry, bitter, and almost stale. But a good kind of stale. The bitterness is what I am mistaking for as stale. Anyway, the aftertaste is strong on for a good three to five minutes. The burp is nice too. This is just an all around good beer. Not sure there is anything bad I could say about this beer. Well, maybe that my glass is empty.  I am a BIG fan of this brew. Those folks over there at North Coast Brewing have done it again. Keep up the good work and bottoms up!  Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout - The bottle says: “Brewed in the tradition of the 18th century English brewers who supplied the Russian court of Catherine the Great. Old Rasputin develops a cult following wherever it goes.

With some of best retention I've seen in a good while. MMMM.... This looks so lovely.  Roasted malt, dark chocolate and coffee-like aromas, with a little fruit in the background, enter the nose. Pleasant, complex yet a little hard to figure out.  Dark roasted malts, dark chocolate, all dark flavors all around, with just enough sweetness to balance it out. This is great savoring and aging material. Carbonation is pleasantly minimal, body is medium to heavy, although rather average for Imperial Stouts. Nice, thick and chewy, pretty much an alcoholic chocolate milkshake.  A solid Imperial Stout, and top-notch stuff altogether.

Only after this stage do the finer, more subtle elements of coffee, dark fruit, and chocolate present themselves.

This bubbly froth slowly reintegrates over several minutes, leaving sticky rings of lace around the circumference of the goblet.   The emanating aroma is quite fruity for a stout, consisting of plums and raisins, with a touch of alcohol and piney hops; minimal coffee and chocolate on the nose.   Initial flavor is of sweet and dark fruits, then mocha and espresso, followed by a faint alcohol taste that subsequently yields to burnt chocolate and bitter hops, both of which linger all the way to the next sip. The hoppy bitterness pleasantly surprises and compliments the “charcolaty” flavors, while nicely balancing the mild sweetness of this brew.   Mouth feel at room temperature is rich, creamy, and somewhat thick—but not overwhelmingly so—with little carbonation; very decent for the style.

112,412,20ozmonkey,4.17,"I don't know what the date of this bottle was, but I've been holding on to it for a little over a year now. I haven't reviewed a fresh bottle, but I have definitely had it before.  Looks very tasty. Half-finger tan head that fades and leaves bubble around the edge of the surface. Deep black color that absolutely no light is going to get through.  Surprisingly fruity notes on the smell. Light caramel and chocolate smells as well, not overpowering though.  I would say this definitely tastes different than a younger bottle. There's a blast of sweet fruity caramel on the front with bitter chocolate staying for the finish. The alcohol has smoothed out over time also.  Relative to other imperial stouts this is fairly light bodied. There's a bit of stickiness that coats your mouth, but nothing unpleasant.  Holding on to this bottle was a bit of an experiment and I would say it turned out great! I'm gonna have to grab another four pack to replace this bottle.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,gkunkle,4.07,"Had this on tap at the Brickhouse a few months back, reviewing from chicken-scratch on the back of a receipt. Served in a pint glass with a one finger light tan head. Body of the beer is black, though I think a deep brown would be a better descriptor, as it's not truly a jet black. Aroma is of dark sweet malts, roasted malts, chocolate, caramel. When I sip the beer I get flavors of dark chocolate, roasted notes, bitterness, malt sweetness. Body is not as thick as expected considering the smell and the high ABV. I am generally not an RIS kind of guy, but this was one of the first imperial stouts I have enjoyed.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,BeerNoobNC,4.38,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. The beer was dark black and produced a tan mocha head. Very malty flavor. I get a small hint of coffee or chocolate maybe, but not sure. Either way, there is a sweet taste with a little bit of a bitter bite. There is also a hint of the alcohol (which is otherwise very well-masked at 9%). I have not had many of these imperial stouts, but this is probably the best I have had so far.

112,412,TappaKeggaBrew,3.03,"A: A great example of an imperial stout: it pours mighty-nigh unto black, with a thick, brown head of froth that has good retention and decent glass lacing.  S: Black-strap molasses up front, sweet toffee and dried dates supporting.  T: Initially rich grain transitioning into sweet malt, but this pleasant flavor lasted just about 1 second before being rudely kicked aside by a harsh and acrid bitterness, with phenolic and fatty/soapy flavors in the long finish (unpleasantly long!)  M: Moist, smooth, and nicely carbonated when it first hits the tongue; but like the taste, the pleasant mouthfeel yields to a noticeable burn from the alcohol and an unpleasant astringent feel that lingers too long in the mouth.  O: What looked and smelled promising really failed to deliver. If this is what the Russians were drinking in 1917, it's no wonder they revolted! If I'm in the mood for an imperial stout, I'll pay a pretty penny for Samuel Smith's offering; but I couldn't get more than 25% of this one down before pouring it into the compost bin -- I'll be returning the bottle to the store for a refund!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,ThomasMetal75,3.9,"A- Dark black. Very small red huge showing through the glass. Big, thick head that recedes to a nice soapy consistency. It sticks around during the duration of the beer. Decent amount of lacing thanks to the 9% ABV.  S- Burnt dark chocolate & alcohol.  T- Same as smell. The alcohol creates a warming effect in the finish. This doesn't taste like sweet molasses or syrup, so that is a plus in my book. This beer is a lot smoother than most imperial stouts I've had. It starts of semi-dry to my taste-buds, then moves to a sweetness that is very well balanced with the rest of the beer's flavors.  M- Medium, but more towards full bodied. The finish makes the beer feel like it's stuck to the roof of your mouth and spreads to the back of the throat. The mouthfeel is what creates the warming sensation.  Overall, Old Rasputin has everything that a standard imperial stout has, but is smoother. It's less alcoholic than most in it's style, which makes it more enjoyable. It also doesn't have an extremely heavy molasses or sugary sweet syrup taste, so that's what I like about it.

A - Black as night, opaque, no light going through this stuff. 1/2 pinky of head, darker grey colored.  S - Typical quality Imperial, nice hints of chocolate, maltiness, slight hop quality to it.  T - Great, tastes of smooth chocolate and the hops make their presence subtley known. The chocolate malt is clearly the forefront. Alcohol taste is very effectively masked by the fantastic flavors.  M - Thick, decent carbonation, not overpowering or underwhelming. Good balance. The creaminess is praiseworthy.  O - Does it live up to the hype? That, lads and ladies, is up to the drinker.

No surprise that it is pitch black with a thin near brown head. There is a good aroma to this stout with molasses and bready notes. If you try this beer be ready for an intense experience. The flavor is big and brawny. Get ready for hints (or hits) of coffee grinds, unsweetened bakers chocolate, blackstrap molasses and toasted black bread. The aftertaste is long with some bitter coming through. This is not your starter stout, and I would recommend for those not familiar with stouts to work your way up to the Old Rasputin with some more mellow offerings.

Probably wasted on my puny nose!  Taste: Bitter coffee and dark chocolate. Lots of alcohol warmth, especially for the abv, which compliments the other flavours very nicely.

It looks delicious  S- Not much of a smell, but what you can smell is pretty similar to the taste.  T- Roasty, Tofee taste apparent, but it definitely gets overwhelmed by the alcohol taste.

112,412,scar,3.88,"An amazing beer and terrific in a special very American way. Taste and look were the best part of the beer,with smell lacking for an Imperial Stout. My opinion is that even though this is an American Classic, this beer is really an over grown American/Foreign Extra Stout.  Imperial Stouts are billed as having aromas of dark fruit, burnt sugar, and aggressive yeast aromas and traditionally if true ""English Stouts"" don't have such a heavy Rbarley/coffee note.  Despite this, the beer was soooo drinkable and I love idea of an overgrown carrying a big stick stout.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,StJamesGate,4.48,"Pours black with a tinge of burgundy and piles of thick, creamy stiff sepia head that rims and just doesn't fade, leaving an abstract art installation worth of lace. Roast in the form of ash, bark, loam, an umame/fish note, and big orange oil hops - intriguing. Oily espresso, char, hint of boysenberry, but also a warming undertone of fig and prune juice then a 1-2 punch of roast acidity and punishing hop bitterness plus a pinch of salt. Citrus oil finish and colossal bitter linger. Medium to full, clingy and sticky, silky, no burn.  New record holder for the bitterest stout I've ever tasted, and possibly the hoppiest, too. It could be ever so slightly too thin, but probably has to be to stay drinkable. I can totally understand how this can have 3000+ reviews and still get the score it does.

Poured it into my Great Divide balloon glass.  This beer just looks awesome. Poured with a HUGE tan head. Still waiting for it to die down a bit. This isn't even on Nitro and I love the head. Just a classic, dark, awesome stout look.  The nose has some thickness to it, but I know from having this before that it's a bit misleading. Chocolate is the major note. Some smoke and hops, too. As it warms, the chalky dryness comes through.  The beer is a very classic RIS. Maybe a bit hoppier and chalkier than I would prefer. Comes across as a bit dry and astringent. Good depth of flavor... guessing this could use another 6 months to smooth out the hops. In fact, the depth of the beer at this point should tell me something about the quality. Still, it doesn't convey the RIS flavors that I like to find.  Old Rasputin is a good, standard RIS. Maybe a bit hoppier and chalkier than I would prefer, but there's nothing off about it.

112,412,Clowerweb,4.43,"Poured from 12oz. bottle into a pint glass. No dates visible on the bottle.  I poured this a few minutes ago, taken from the fridge, waiting for it to warm up a little bit so it gets close to the suggested 50-60 degrees.  A: Solid black. Black as midnight, completely opaque. Semi aggressive pour yielded a solid 3 finger medium brownish-tan head that rose straight to the top of the pint glass. Head had very tight small creamy bubbles, excellent retention and thick lace.  S: Not a lot going on here, less than I had anticipated for the ABV. Definitely not a boozy aroma, it's very light on the nose, but I catch some dark roasted malts with notes of chocolate and coffee. Has a great aroma, but a little on the non-aromatic side for my tastes.  T-1: After waiting for this to warm up a touch, I took the first sip at probably around 40 degrees. We'll start here and see how the experience changes after a half hour or so of sipping.  First taste of this stout cold was quite a surprise - the flavor is very bold and in-your-face at the start, much more than expected from the mild aroma. Starts very earthy, bready, rolled oats, roasted malts, coffee, notes of chocolate. Mid palate I get a hit of strong roasty malted booze, almost malt liquor-like for a split second, maybe even a vodka or rum style fume taste, but it fades quickly and finishes almost dry (not quite dry, but it dries up a tad) with a medium hop. Very tasty!  T-2: About 15 minutes after removing from fridge, we should be probably around 45 degrees or so, but still pretty well chilled. Still well below the suggested serving temp.  The boldness of the bready roasy malts and coffee has calmed down a bit. At this temperature, it's trying to balance out a bit better. Not getting as strong of a boozy mid palate, but it's still there. The light hop finish is still present as much as it was when it was ""super cold"", countering the malts for a more even balance this time.  T-3: We're at about 20 minutes after the pour, estimating between 45-50 degrees. Bordering on the recommended serving temp.  Now the balance is really starting to shine through, and I can see the pattern that's going to occur. As this beer warms, it begins to lose a lot of that super strong roasty coffee malty start. The mid palate still has that high ABV boozy hit, but the finish gives me a nice hop to counter the starting maltiness. Very good balance from start to finish with a decent twist mid way through.  T-4: Giving it a nice swirl, we're probbaly between 50-55 degrees now. Let's give this a couple more sips.  Again, very well balanced. Starts roasty, malty, oaty, coffee with chocolate notes, much more tame now at close to room temps. The mid palate booze hit is not nearly as noticeable, and the light hop finish has even tamed a bit, but overall still manages to remain bold and full flavored. This beer becomes a nicely balanced, finely crafted experience that certainly is best enjoyed at the suggested temps.  M: Full bodied, medium carbonation, chewy, sticky, but not syrupy. Creamy, smooth, goes down easy. Very good, lots to like and nothing to complain about here.  O: Solid stout, highly drinkable and enjoyable. A bit on the pricey side, but definitely worth it to treat yourself with this if you're a fan of dark, roasty, malty, full bodied stouts and porters. Thoroughly enjoyed my experience with this beer.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

I've had this beer a couple of times over the years, but I figured it was time to give it a proper review.  A: Dark as night, with a thick, creamy head. ( no innuendo intended). Alot of carbonation from the bottom of the bottle, which I think may have affected my tasting score. ALOT of lacing to the sides of the glass.  S: Toasted acorn, some coffee, and subtle chocolate notes. There is a stronger presence of roasted sugar/caramel than chocolate or coffee in my opinion. Alcohol is present.  T: Massive cocoa and toasted caramel notes at the front. A bitter and boozy bite towards the end of the taste. Some coffee notes linger around, but this is a chocolate milkshake on steroids for sure. I have had this on tap, and know how rich and velvety this things can get under the BEST conditions. But, I am not completely BLOWN away in bottle form.  M: Chocolate milk feel in the mouth.  O: A good stout to have on a cold night. 9% ABV and the price per bottle(1.99/per in a 4 pack) make this an incredibly good deal for such a highly alcoholic, and well made beer.

This was a while ago but Old Rasputin was a very memorable beer, so I'll do the best I can to do it justice.  A: Poured into a pint glass. Black as night with a towering coffee colored head, although I remember being a bit disappointed with the retention.  S: Chocolate, coffee, caramel and a waft of alcohol. Nice.  T: Wow. Loads of roasted flavors, coffee, chocolate, dark caramel, a little hoppy and alcoholic on the finish.  M: Full body, perfect carbonation.  O: I'm still young, but this is the best stout I've tasted to date. Amazing stuff and great for the price.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,mattbk,3.91,"A - Thick and black. Brown thick mousse head. The foam is sticking nicely to the glass. Looks deep and rich. Amazing lacing during the tasting.  S - Roast, chocolate at first, giving way to dark fruits, raisins. Not much hops or alcohol in the nose.  T - Up front is that deep and dark roast. That gives way to some thick toffee and fudge, followed closely by an alochol burn. I'd say there was some astrigency here. The burn sort of lingers... unfortunately. I was expecting this to be better hidden.  M - Thick and filling. The beer is quite a bit chewy. Carbonation is light, but present.  O - This bottle isn't dated, but was a bit dusty on the shelf. Hard to say if this affects the review. A bit too much burn at the back end for me. I've had other RIS's that disguise this better. The burn hides the roast and sweetness that come though in the nose. Everything else about this beer was top notch.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Drinkerofales,4.33,"Pours pure black, giant mocha head which took far too long to dissipate(but gave the beer some warming time).  Smells of malt, roasted nuts, slightly boozy, with some coffee, bitter chocolate, and a hint of anise(might be the booze).  Tastes thickly of great malts, dark and roasty, good presence of coffee and dark chocolate are there too. Very tasty.  Feels good, plenty of carbonation, yet coats the tongue, full bodied and a little boozy burn. My least favorite part of the beer, but still good.  Overall a great beer, not a bad choice for my fiftieth review. Bold and intense flavors really make this an excellent beer, one I will enjoy for years to come.

Some sweetness. Complex.  Taste follows the smell. Some bitterness and some sweetness, a perfectly balanced beer that hides the high ABV very well.

The first note off the nose is black licorice, and you can catch the alcohol on the backend. In between, there are notes of dark chocolate and burnt malts  You certainly taste the alcohol as well. it comes across somewhat sweet initially, that fades into a bakers chocolate cacao. Roasted malts across the second and third acts give way to a hoppy bitterness that balances out the back end. Well balanced.  a drinkability that belies the 9%, even though you can taste it. Smoothe and well balanced with good carbonation levels. This does not necessarily make it a sessionable beer per se, but it is certainly drinkable for a big RIS. Definitely worth picking up a four pack.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,magictacosinus,4.82,"Poured into a tulip glass from a 12oz bottle. No freshness date but I purchased this bottle in mid-August and opened it up earlier this evening. This is the first time, to my knowledge, that I've had this beer this old since its (assumed) fabrication date.  Imperial stouts really can't much better looking than this, can they? Well, they certainly can, but Old Rasputin represents exactly what I love about these beer: a gigantic head, black thickness resembling motor oil, nice carbonation on the edges of the glass, and a creamy presentation that is too good not to resist.  As for the smell - holy hell, what an aroma! There are so many bold, huge flavorful notes in this one. Right up the front I get dark chocolate, coffee, alcohol, cherries, roasted nuts, malty goodness, and so much more. It's, of course, very intense, but extremely complex.  As for the flavor and mouthfeel, I feel utterly and blissfully accomplished whenever I drink and finish a glass of Old Rasputin. The flavors are exactly the same as the aromas (except with more accentuated coffee) but instead of being malty and overly sweet, it manages to hold balance amid all the ridiculous flavors. There's a piercing bitterness that makes it less of a stout and more of a barleywine - or, in fact, its own style. The thickness of the malts and carbonation obviously makes it a ""stout,"" but this is beer is so rich and intense that it pretty much transcends the beer style as a whole. It also warms you up like magic.  Absolutely one of my favorite stout offerings out there, especially when the weather gets cold. Every time I have it, it becomes more inviting and less intimidating to drink, and I while I think I prefer it fresher (more hoppiness all around), it's still very good when slightly aged.

This one contains , roast, stronger on the chocolate, lighter on the coffee, and maybe a touch of oats. Some earthy hops lingering in the background.  It starts out a little sweet with a nice dose of dark chocolate. Next there is light bitterness that cuts through the beer quite nicely. It finishes with a nice roastiness and that touch of oats. The roast lingers for a little bit on the palate.  Good fuller body with a slight creaminess. Low carbonation.  Overall a solid RIS.

Flavors kind of slap your tongue around a bit. Chocolate and tobacco up front with a thick chewy body that thins out a little on the swallow unfortunately.

The bad: they served it in a plastic cup and too cold, which is why I didn't rate it as highly as I possibly could have.  It was black with no head and no lacing (likely due to the cup) and the nose opened up as it warmed up with dark roasted malts, coffee and hints of chocolate I could definitely smell a bit of the alcohol too.  The taste was phenomenal! Lots of coffee and a molasses. It did have a bit of bitter finish, though, which was OK with me.

What I mean by this is if a beer has a good score, we are more likely to score it higher or vice versa for a bad beer. Old Rasputin was one that I made sure I bucked this trend because I did not enjoy this as much as other Imperial Stouts I have had.  I drank this beer 3-4 years ago and didn't remember much about it so I had to try it again. Unfortunately, I hoped it would have been better.  It poured a very dark black and a had a nice, big tan colored foam head. This is where things started going downhill for me. As hard as I tried to smell all of the things I like about a Russian Imperial (dark fruit, malts, booze), I only got the faintest hint of a malty stout. The taste was very hoppy up front. I tried to taste the dark fruits that usually come with a RIS and even though they were there it was a mostly watery finish. I have to say that if I tried to do a blind taste test on this beer, I am not even sure if I would know it was a RIS because it doesn't have enough of a distinctive taste.  I didn't hate this beer.

T - A complex blend of dark cocoa nubs, brown sugar, burnt toast, charcoal, raisins, and espresso, with a refreshing bit of bitterning hops coming out right at the end. Yes, you can actually taste the hops in this stout. What a concept! Alcohol carries all the way through, becoming more present as it warms, and the aftertaste of bitter hops and chocolate goes on for what seems like days. Stunning.  M- Velvety and chewy. Low carbination suits the taste elements and alcohol content perfectly. Finishes slightly dry.  O - This is one amazing stout, and one of the more complex I have tasted.

Atop is a one-finger head of sand colored form that I let air out for about 15 minutes without it receding as much as a millimeter. Thick, sticky walls of lace coat the glass as I drink.  Smells burnt. Overtoasted bread, medium roast coffee, dark chocolate, touches of tobacco. The aroma overall is good, but is also a little subdued. Hard to pick up much through the thick head.  In the flavor, smokiness is increased, like a campfire. Bitter dark chocolate, burnt coffee, toast. A touch of sweet chocolate at the swallow, culminating in a smooth blend of burnt and sweet flavors.  The full, smooth, creamy, soft body is damn near perfect. Like a fleece blanket, it’s so smooth on the tongue. A touch of tingly carbonation keeps things lively, and there’s just a hint of alcohol in the nose. Finishes clean, which is a pleasant surprise.

The smell is chocolaty and for me- no hint of the high alcohol. There is an espresso hint and roasted malts.  Taste is complex, and very good. On the front side is a small small hint of burnt coffee, and much chocolate- but quickly followed by the malts, with bitter hops in there. It ends with a slight sweet uptake. So it rounds out nicely.  Mouthfeel is fantastic. Very slightly thick and creamy with malts rolling over your tongue.  Generally I like all beers, but I am mostly an IPA man.

112,412,ms11781,4.23,"No date on the bottle but I have it marked as purchased in December of 2009 so it's at least 2 years old. 12oz bottle poured into a snifter.  Pours black as night, with a massive 3 finger foam head that dissipates rather quickly. A nice cap is left, however and it leaves nice lacing on the glass. The oddest feature is that the head is a very light tannish color. Very surprising for a beer so dark. I'm almost certain that when fresh the head tends to be quite darker, maybe a lighter shade of brown. Either way, it's an excellent looking beer.  There was a massive black licorice aroma when I held the freshly poured beer up to my nose. As the beers warms it disappears completely. The nose evolves into a hugely roasty, slightly smoky aroma. There are hints of chocolate here as well.  The taste has the same characteristics as the nose but is considerably different. There is a touch of some semisweet chocolate upfront before the roasty flavors takes over. The roastiness quickly turns into a bitter, smoky and acrid flavor. The bitterness sticks to the tongue at the finish, almost like a really bitter DIPA.  Feels a bit thin, relative to style. Overall it's somewhere between the highest end of medium and the lower end of heavy. It really does feel like both at different times. Surprisingly, the carbonation still feels prickly on the tongue. Pretty amazing for a 2 year old beer.  Overall, this is still a good beer two years later, though it may be a bit past it's prime. This is the last beer of a 4 pack that I have had over the past 2 years and it shows that the beer is probably best within the first 15 or so months of bottling.

T/M: It smells good, but it tastes even better. This is a really complex taste profile, with coffee/chocolate stout maltiness blending with hop bitterness and floral flavors, and a bit of alcohol warming on the back end. Each sip seems to explode in the mouth, offering up multiple layers of intense flavors. It has a nice creamy stout feel but the taste is what's really distinctive.

112,412,Windigo,4.71,"I don't know if I've been so pleasantly surprised by a dark....and I do mean DARK beer, ever in my life. It had that nifty rich head, which is a walnut color and it sat thick and tidy on top of the brew. The color was as black as night and very smooth feeling for something I was expecting to be heavy and syrupy. The powerful coffee opener was magical, there was NO BITTER BITE at the tail end. I was entranced. I broke out some organic white chocolate bark from Baltimore with almonds and blueberries it. The pairing was incredible. I don't get this excited about beers. I can't wait to carry it at the bar!!!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,LeoPanna,4.75,"i first tried this in Juneau, Alaska... Now I find it in Queens for $2.99 a bottle... perfect.  Diabolical looking son of a bitch. pitch black, coffee head, deceptively slow to dissolve.  Smells of fresh bread, coffee, brandy, grapes, dried meat, cinnamon, clove, licorice.  First it's a strong espresso w sugar, then alcohol and dark chocolate. It's quite bitter as well. There's a woodiness to it. Nice warming finish as stated on the bottle. On my third sip, I breath in as well and get some rich spices (cinammon, pepper, clove, basil, and more) before the espresso. This is an incredibely complex beer. It's extremely smooth as well. Definitely a slow sipper.  it's unique, complex, fits the style, strong, creamy, smells amazing, inexpensive, the bottle looks cool. What more should I expect in a beer? Should I rate this lower because of a beer that I haven't tried and will probably have to drive for 13 hours and stand in line for a day to obtain? This is totally worth the 3 block walk for me.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,troysoy2,4.48,"Poured into a pint glass, the color is opaque black. An impressive head, one and a half fingers, very creamy, nice retention.  The smell has a pretty strong, grassy hop presence coexisting with bittersweet chocolate and a tinge of roasted coffee bean. Underneath, there is a less up-front base level of dark malt.  At times, I feel like I'm drinking a particularly dark IPA. Bitterness from lots of hops is always at the forefront of the taste. After that, comes lots of coffee bitterness and dark chocolate. Roasted malt barely manages to balance out the hops. Barely. Warm alcohol also becomes a prevalent feature of the taste once the beer warms up. The mouthfeel gravitates towards the pricklier, carbonated side, rather than the creamy stout way of doing things. But I find this appropriate, owing to the more bitter nature of the brew. Still, maybe just a bit more substance to the mouthfeel might be nice...  I first tried this beer a year ago, and it instantly became one of my favorites. A year later, and it still lives up to my taste. Solid, a really beautiful beer with a unique take on the Imperial Stout.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

T: Maybe I had an off bottle, but the taste was very bland and didn't have that nice chocolate, burnt coffee taste I so desire in my stouts.  M: Very bland on the palate for me I'm afraid.

T: Intense hop bitterness dominates on top of a super dense roasted malt base. Warming alcohol with a slight yeast character that I would usually call Belgian. In spite of this it seems underattenuated and sweet.  M: Thick, tarry and syrupy with pretty slight carbonation. You would think this would be hard to drink but it is oh so pleasant.

They succeeded.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,fmccormi,3.91,"Straight pour from 12oz bottle to Luettich-balloon style glass (Bruery tulip); no freshness dating is present on the bottle, from what I can tell  Appearance (5.0): Black as night in the body, light khaki head of very, very tight, fine bubbles, that starts at 4+ finges and fades to a hazy on the top of the beer. It leaves what can only be described as textbook lacing—I swear it actually looks like some kind of ugly tan lace draped down all around the glass.  Smell (4.0): Coffee, some bitter dark chocolate, some oxidization present; thought this bottle was from June or so, but as I said, there’s no freshness date on the bottle so that’s just a guess at this point. Some grassy hops in the back. Malt body is rich and roasty, with very little sweetness underneath it—this smells menacing, and I like it.  Taste (3.5): Bitter as hell black coffee and roasted barley that turns to dark, dark chocolate on the way down. The finish is some mixture of grassy, maybe herbal hops melding pretty seamlessly with charred, blackened cereals. Not a ton of complexity, maybe, but it’s a nice break from these sickly-sweet RISs other brewers and drinkers seem to love. As it warms, seems a bit richer, fuller, and quite a bit boozier, but still very straight-forward—no surprises here.  Mouthfeel (4.5): Rich and creamy, with a heavy, velvety carbonation that coats the mouth; body is on the lighter side of full (more than medium, not quite heavy but definitely full). Very nice.  Overall (4.0): Not a bad RIS by any means—kind of a benchmark in a lot of ways. It’s not the most interesting or most complex RIS in terms of taste, but it does seem to nail some elements rather well, suggesting to me that North Coast dialed in on a very dependable RIS recipe a long time ago. Good for them, because this works. Not surprisingly, this seems like a great candidate for cask and barrel treatments.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,tobelerone,4,"Jet black beer with a fluffy brown head, excellent retention; lace sticks well.  Big roasty aroma with coffee and sweet toffee-like notes. Undercurrent of hoppy bitterness. Hint of anise?  Tasty combination of roasted malt, black coffee, bitter chocolate, fruity sweetness. Again the hops provide a bit of balancing bitterness and traces of booze are noticed underneath, particularly as the beer warms. Faint anise/black licorice note. Big and flavorful.  Medium bodied; perhaps even a little light for the style. Modestly sticky, carbonation on the medium-high side. I might like a bit more chewiness.  An excellent everyday imperial stout. Always affordable and available; perhaps a bit thinner and hoppier than I like this style to be.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

S: Deep and rich, with strong notes of molasses, toasted caramel, chocolate-covered espresso beans, a campfire built with wet wood, and a touch of vanilla.  T: Complex and beautifully rendered, this beer has a wide flavor profile the works well in concert with the feel. Up-front flavors include molasses, prunes, and wet wood while the back notes are smoky, nutty, and leathery. Beautiful, crisp, and smooth without much hint at its alcohol level other than the robust character.  M: Bold without overpowering, the mouthfeel is crisp, full, and well-textured. It sits just right in your mouth, swallows easily, and leaves a slightly bitter longing in your mouth that begs for another gulp.  O: For me this beer is the standard for the genre. Old Rasputan Russian Imperial Stout is the bar by which others are measured against. A must-try, and the perfect beer for late-fall when the leaves are gone and the wind bites a bit more each day.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Enjoyed out of a nitro tap, Old Rasputin has perfectly balanced flavors of bitter dark chocolate and coffee, as well as a surprisingly high alcohol content of 9%.

T- you start with a good hop bitterness and toasted mault astringency. moves into a good toasted mault and bitter choclate and finishes with some fruity caramel notes and slight alcohol warmth.

Anyway, getting on to actual beer-related notes; Looks dark black with deep brownish tan legs. Nice dark brown head of two fingers-- thick and fluffy looking. Really nice.  The smell hits big chocolate malt with some sweet caramel and a giant roasty character. The flavor is much of the same, but it adds a bit of boozy warmth at the dry and smooth finish.  Body is full, thick, and creamy.  Overall-- this is a spectacular beer for $8 per 4-pack!

T: vine fruit (as in a bold red wine), bitter chocolate, alcohol heat, all rounded out by a bold, dark coffee flavor that lingers. So good.  M: Rich and full, as it should be. Can get a bit hot after a while, but that's to be expected.  O: I already knew this, but taking the time to be critical reaffirms how much I love this beer.

It ends with subtle flavors of dark fruit and alcohol, along with a tad bit of coffee. (11/11) '09 Vintage: Alcohol has mellowed out, incredibly smooth flavors. A touch of black licorice comes in, while bittersweet chocolate comes into play.  M: Nice and creamy, but more carbonation than I expected, it works, though. Alcohol masked incredibly well.

Strong notes of licorice and spice--but two of the myriad flavors that spike your palate. Overall, this is a knock-out beer, exploding with flavor, and pretty intense with its 9%+ alcohol content.

A three finger light tan fluffy head quickly emerges and sticks around. Slowly the long lasting froth leaves behind copias amounts of lacing indicating the fill line.  The aroma isn't as strong as the appearance would suggest. Hints of roasted malt, earthy hops and mocha tease the nose.  The flavor is bitter chocolate, burnt barley, coffe and black licorice. A bit more dark fruit would add some sweetness and tone down the noticeable rum taste.  The mouthfeel is rich, silky smooth and creamy with a medium body.

112,412,climax,4.68,"Poured into a tulip glass, this one pours an almost immortal black. The head forms instantly and is about as menacing as Rasputin's mugshot. Slowly the globs of bubbles sink atop the Goodyear black body. For a 9% beer, the head qualities are confounding.  The first thing that actually leaps out of the aroma are leafy hop tones. The earthy character is almost reminiscent of compost, but in a good way. The hop character is a welcome gift to the expected conglomeration of coffee and chocolate, perhaps because I am drinking this one early in it's usable life. The alcohol and astringency are very tame for a beer of this stature. As it warms, more buttery caramel and diacetyls emerge to add a little sweetness to this roasty beast.  In the flavor, earthy bitterness lingers from start to finish. A fleeting burst of sweetness, maybe ripe fruit, comes and goes. It's the dark unsweetened chocolate and coffee qualities that create the intensely dry roasty character that completely defines the beer.  The dry hoppy bitterness, teamed with the dark roasted malt, leaves the palette like the desert wanting the rain. The beer demands to be drank swiftly, even if the gloriously thick body makes you think twice. The carbonation is pretty assertive, keeping it very crisp beginning to end.  Considering the availability and price of this, I'm really hard pressed to imagine there's a better stout out there. If you like them bold, bitter, and dry... drink the 4 pack and light a cop car on fire.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Really pretty beer.  In the aroma, I get rich, dark chocolate and roasty malts. The smell is very round and fresh, but not lighthearted. Some detectable alcohol. There may be some hints of dark fruits as well. Hope aroma is less evident.  The taste is unreal. There are huge, round chocolate and roasted malts, with the perfect balance of hop bitterness.

Okay tasting RIS yet a bit too much coffee burn and hot alcohol. Don't get much hop character as they're overpowered by the roasty notes.

O - This beer started off so well with the appearance and smell then just went way south with the taste. Not balanced at all.

Lacing is great and you have a sudsy film floating around the whole time your drinking, which might not be as long as you might expect with a strong brew like this. It has a very strong, roasted character. It smells almost woodsy or yeasty. There is coffee in there somewhere, perhaps even espresso? It has a decent hop bite too. Alcohol is present but not overwhelming for me. Definitely a sipper, it's just overwhelming with flavor and so damn heavy. It really stays on the tongue too. By far my favorite I've had by this brewery. I am going to try my hand at brewing a clone of this later this week.

Then there's some roasted malts warning me of what's to come.  T - When it's cool I pick up the hops, just like I wanted to. Good, they're zesty. I hear American varietals were used, I don't mind that. When the beer is warm enough to be enjoyed: sweet, smooth malt. Kinda tastes English. It's very flavorful, but not overly sweet or roasty. The finish has some bite to it.... acrid towards the end of the beer. Other than that, it's not overly interesting. I don't think it's too young, I just think this a tame beer. Some heat at the end makes the beer fun.  M - It's smooth and full-bodied. The beer doesn't weigh you down, though. Plus the finish is dry. Definitely Chico.  O - This beer drinks tooo easy. On the one hand, it's nice having a 9% behemoth just glide away. On the other hand, I wish there were more of interest in this beer. Maybe I'm spoiled, but for as taut as this beer is, I wish there were something more to it. I think the yeast is too boring, the crystal malt could impart a little more pit-fruit flavor, and the roasted character could be a slightly more aggressive.  Sure, for anyone like me on a seasonal Doppelbock binge right now, this will compare to a bull out of the pen. But as far as RIS's go, its tame than usual.  Fine beer.

The dominate flavor is malt but it is perfectly balanced with hops, citrus, and caramel. After a while the chocolatly undertones come out and make this beer amazing.  M: This beer fills the mouth the way a beer should. It is viscous despite the high alcohol. The nitro is an awesome addition to this beer.  O: if you have not had had this beer on nitro then you have not had a stout. This is beer should be placed among the elite.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,wedge,4.18,"@ Flying Saucer  I'm not usually one for Nitro beers, but I was feeling adventurous and decided to give an old classic a try. Pours black with a typically thick, dense, stable slab of a head on top that leaves much lacing on the glass. Nearly no aroma at first, but then a semi-sweet chocolate aroma emerges with an increased dark fruitiness as it warms. Tasty from the start...I think maybe a bigger stout like this is what I need from a nitro tap. Lots of chocolaty roast and a gentle creamy sweetness. Feels a little less than full bodied this way, but still obviously very smooth and floaty in the mouth. Whereas most nitro I come across is rather mild and bland, this is not...it works! It also reminds me that I need to revisit this widely available, great stout more often.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,gregb13,4.35,"Tried this one tonight after a session in the pool (heated) and spa. I'd had it before but didn't remember much. To start with, it pours like motor oil with a small mocha head. Nice retention and lacing. Nose is very inviting; lightly bitter hop, roasty malt and a little booze. Taste is fairly complex; bitter (back end) hops and espresso, some dark bitter chocolate, moderate booze. Bitterness lingers a little more than I'd like, but it's hard to be perfect. Mouthfeel is velvety, with a medium-full body. A sipper for sure, especially at 9%. Overall this is very good. Would seek out again for sure.  Addendum: This tastes very similar to Deschutes Black Butte porter (which is also very good) with more booze. Similar hop profile. Booze booze and more booze, and some licorice. Not very complex. Where's the beef? Give me control of the brewery and I could produce one hell of an inviting stout. Why can't these guys do the same?",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Pours a motor oil black, with a weak looking 1 finger head, lots of slime and sticky bubbles. Big hops on the nose, followed by bitter coffee bean, bitter dark chocolate, vanilla milk chocolate, toasted malts. Chocolatety mayhem in my mouth right now, coffee/espresso, nice alcohol warming bitter coffee bean finish . Full bodied, creamy, smooth. Overall this beer was great, this beer aged well and tasted less like a coffee milk shake (as i thought it did fresh) and more like a great RIS. Very complex, rich and inviting.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Hophead717,4.33,"A: Total black with a 1.5 finger finger mocha head. Nice lacing as the beer clings to the sides of the glass after each sip.  S: Deep notes of dark chocolate and roasted malt. Light coffee scents can be detected when searched for, but they take a backseat here.  T: A nice combination of roasted malts upfront and dark chocolate. Both are deep flavors that work very well in tandem. Hints of espresso flavor emerge, but they largely follow the roasted malt flavor. Bitterness from the hops may also be present, but it's difficult to tell for sure because of the prevalence of the roasted malt flavor. As the beer warms, the espresso become a bit more noticeable on the finish.  M: Full bodied, with medium-to-heavy carbonation. It's a nice beer to drink.  O: Make no mistake, this is a RIS. Some stouts/porters can be a bit lighter or a bit sweeter...this is neither. A very good beer and, though I haven't explored RIS-es a lot as of yet, I definitely think it's a winner.

112,412,cmq103,4.03,"Poured from a 12 0z. bottle into a Duvel Belgian Tulip glass. I bought this at the Beer Store in Southampton PA. I will say it was worth the drive over from NJ, as they have one of the larger selections of craft beers that I've seen in the area.  Appearance: A typical jet black thicker pour, as expected with the style. I nice, thick 3/4"" cola colored head impressed me resulting from only a moderately aggressive pour. Lacing was spotty, but decent as my glass emptied. The head eventually reduced to a thin light brown ring after a few minutes at room temperature.  Smell: Right off the bat, this reminded me a lot of the Storm King Imperial Stout, which is a hoppier Imperial Stout. I get dark bittersweet chocolate, followed by burnt roasted malts then a definitive hoppy and unsweetened espresso aroma. I also detect a slight booziness in the finish, which become more prominent as the beer warms.  Taste: Like the nose, bitter unsweetened dark chocolate, espresso coffee, dark fruits, and caramel. Light roasted, almost burnt, malts and a surprisingly bitter hoppy finish. I prefer my RIS just a tad sweeter to tame the hoppy bite. The alcohol is well hidden and doesn't expose itself until the beer gets closer to room temperature.  Mouthfeel: Definitely a full-bodied brew. Smooth, but with a dry bitter finish. Carbonation is moderate.  Overall: This is a sipper for sure with the higher ABV. I'm glad I tried it but my ""go-to"" RIS is still Brooklyn Black Chocolate. I would still say it's a ""must try"" for fans of the RIS style but I prefer my Imperial Stouts with a little less hop bite.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,SawDog505,4.33,"Poured into a 16 oz snifter. Pours a slick black, with a 3 inch sticky mocha head, tons of lacing. Smell coffee, chocolate, some pine, and a hint of alcohol. Taste is all that, more piney hops than the smell would lead on. Body isn't the biggest, but nice. Perfect amount of life, helps it's dribkability. Temperature is so important to allow this beers flavors to completely shine, close to 55 is best. Lives up to the hype, most reviews I have ever noticed for this style.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,VncentLIFE,4.23,"well its cold as hell for the first time since i moved to NC, so a nice RIS is in order!  Pours as back as i think ive seen. Full inch thick head that looks like mocha.  Smells bitter and hoppy for a stout, and I like it. I get hints of bitter black coffee.  For something that isnt an IPA, holy shit this thing is bitter. I get bittering noble hops as well bitter chocolate and black coffee. Not overly complex, as the hops and bitter flavors take over. After exhaling, I can feel a creamy smooth texture in the body, which is a nice accent to the assault of multiple sources of bitterness. The roasty malt is really only an afterthought since its overshadowed pretty heavily by the hops. A bit boozy on the back end, but for the ABV its just about right.  The more you drink it, the more the coffee comes out. Its rather impressive. The bitter hops are really almost taken over by coffee and smokey roasty malt.  A nice hop forward stout that is nice on a cold night.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,XxNitExX,4.41,"A - Pours the color of oil, with a nice 3 musketeer inside colored head. Beautiful lacing down my tulip glass.  S - Strongly of roast and dark roasted coffee. I slight alcohol tinge, that becomes more apparent as it warms. Dark chocolate present towards the end.  T - Starts with a nice hit or roast, with some chocolate notes early. Bit of alcoholic bite follows with a very wonderful DARK roasted coffee flavor to finish. Taste lingers on the tongue just like a nice sip of joe.  M - Perfectly carbonated, but not too syrupy and thick like some RIS can be. Lingers for quite awhile with its powerful coffee taste.  O - Wonderful readily available RIS. A great go to for those cold nights (or early mornings). For what its worth I do not notice alot of chocolate, but my friend who hates chocolate thinks its very potent and avoids it just for a heads up.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,beersteak,4.28,"Pours the color of Brent crude. Fluffy off-white head.  Nose is hard to identify. I don't drink a lot of stout. Toasty coffee.  Taste is powerful but smooth. It delivers a tingling sensation on the tongue that warms into that characteristic toasted, slightly bitter chocolate/coffee finish.  Mouthfeel is dominated by that tingling sensation. It's addictive.  Old Rasputin truly is black gold. This beer is also one of the best values in my collection at 9 bucks for a four pack, compared to 14 - 15 for anything else that's similar in quality and size. Very highly recommended.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Creamy, smooth, exceptionally rich, and the aftertaste that seems to linger forever is better than anything I've had in this style of beer. Let it warm up a bit and it only gets better. Perfect companions: a nice maduro cigar and a shot of fine whisky. It gets no better.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,57md,3.98,"Pours black with a thick and creamy head. Like with many nitros, you must wait until the beer settles before taking your first sip - but, the great visual effect of the beer settling makes the wait bearable.  The aroma is roasty with some general sweetness. The first sip yields a hearty beer with a bitter roasted finish that has a slight alcohol burn on the back end. As one drinks this gem down, the foam ring remnants divulge the size of each delicious gulp.  Since its an imperial, it could have a stronger roast profile, but no need to nitpick.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Valmor88,4.53,"A: Pours black with a chocolate colored head that takes up half of the glass at first. Excellent head retention. You could take a shower and come back and it would still be there.  S: Roasted malts and chocolate and prevalent. Coffee/caramel and alcohol hints are the next most noticeable. Near the end there are some fruity esters, but I can't identify what kinds.  T: Toasty flavor. Dark chocolate with coffee/toffee and alcohol. Again, something fruity at the finish, but it's underscored by the big roasted coffee flavor also at the finish. Wow.  M: Full bodied. You get some warmth from the alcohol, but it's certainly in the background to all of the flavors.  O: One of the better Russian Imperial Stouts that I've had. Very easy to drink.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Pintofbrown,4.41,"App- The head rages to a four fingered, chocolate monster. It refuses to die after several minutes, leaving circles of soapy lace. The body is an opaque dark brown with no highlights. It is beautiful.  Smell- There is brandy, roasted malt, dark chocolate and some anise. Obviously some coffee roast in there as well. The alcohol heat might be a little too pronounced, but it is still pretty impressive.  Taste- Awesome roasted malt and sweet alcohol flavor morphs into a toffee mid sip. The finish is a dark chocolate, hard roasted coffee and char that really sticks. Really good.  Mouth feel- Smooth drink that is a little dry from the coffee roast. It is a little warm but not overpowering. It is full bodied and fits the beer very well.  Overall- I really enjoy this RIS. It is a brew that everyone should try it once. It's very well brewed with not many surprises, but you know exactly what you are going to get every time.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Paincane,4.45,"A: A very dark brown, almost black pour into my Wild Heaven snifter. One finger tan head with good retention and a persistent rim of lace for the duration. This lace has legs and a slow oily descent. S: Roasted malts, dark chocolate, cocoa, toffee, ethanol and even a hint of soy sauce all emerge as aromas of interest. T: Biscuity, roasty malt, chocolate, dark berries, coffee grounds and warmth of alcohol are all contributors to this flavor bonanza. M: Stout is putting it mildly. Full bodied and mildly carbonated. This beer coats the tongue and lingers with a slightly bitter finish balancing out the flavors. O: Outstanding brew with no shyness to it. The alcohol presence does not hide itself but does not hijack this beer. It is very drinkable and enjoyable.

The bottle gives a slightly more bitter and toastier flavor.  Appearance: Black as night, perfectly stouty. Smell: Biscuity and toasty. You can smell the slight bitterness from the dark malts. Taste: Bitter, dark, toasty and a small chocolate nib flavor. Nice malt backbone, and a slight but non-descript bitter from the hops. Mouthfeel: Nice and thick, as it should be. Perfect mouthfeel, coats your mouth and doesn't let you forget it. Overall: Great beer, one of my favorites. Have had it many times and draught is best.

Poured about two fingers of dark golden head that lingered and lined the walls of my glass until the second round. Unable to see through this dark-dark beer. The smell makes a lot of sense for this particular style: the essence of dark chocolate, roasted almonds and the strong scent of ethanol. It feels a little spicey coming in and warm going down. Not sure about the hops, are there any? Should there be any? Who knows. I don't care because overall this is an awesome beer for the high alcohol and dark chocolate lovers a staple for the cooler holidays and beer float nights.

112,412,brewerburgundy,4.35,"10/21/2011, 12oz bottle, Bruery tulip. Score reflects more recent review. Well, that was the first time I've overflowed a glass. This is a good looking RIS, standardly and less importantly dark, with a fantastic head on the darker side of brown. After my overly exuberant pour I let it sit for maybe five minutes and when I turned back to it the glass was covered in copious amounts of lace from a head fallen to a quarter inch.  It is so wonderful returning to this beer after nearly two years of immersion in craft beer and finding it to be of the caliber I thought in my craft infancy. Just a solid as a rock heavy stout here. Dough, English yeast, espresso, mineral and char don't mess around, complimented by a little sweet chocolate.  Charcoal and roast come in much higher levels. Roast playing up front with cocoa powder, cherry, and grain, while the finish is lusciously dominated by burnt espresso. There is alcohol running through the nose and the taste constantly and I'm not sure I've encountered a better example of it being so well integrated into an entire beer where all it does is compliment, never dominant and not at all a bother.  While the mouth is solid, it doesn't rise to the same peaks as the preceding categories. It's full but not chewy, smooth but not creamy. Solid, as is the whole composition, with medium-high carbonation.  I would not have revisited this any time soon if it were not for a birthday gift from a great friend. What a great gift. This is a widely available icon of American craft beer and surely a first Imperial Stout of many.  11/15/2009, 12oz bottle, 4.3 A. A: Falls a drip coffee brown into the glass, a film of mocha bubbles on top. No light through this baby. 4.5  S: I could smell it a foot or two away, dense toffee, chocolate, and coffee. Spice from hops and some warmth you can tell. The creaminess can be smelt, its rich with cocoa. 4.5  T: A mocha up front, spice follows down your throat, and more mocha and bittersweet chocolate finish it. The booze, while never hiding only helps the experience. 4.5  M: Silky and slippery it goes down. 4.5  D: I could drink it often and bottle after bottle, but of course I'd get into trouble that way. 3.5 because of the potential trouble.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Smell: Coffee, chocolate, and alcohol on the nose. Roasted coffee malts as well.  Taste: Roasted coffee and chocolate, a hint of brown sugar, some roasted coffee malts, some more coffee afterwards and a bit of alcohol taste. Luxurious. Nice roasted chocolate with a warming finish. The aftertaste is of bitter coffee grounds and espresso and lingers well after.  Mouthfeel: Medium-thin body, low-medium carbonation, a coating feeling, and a crisp, biting finish.

A bit of booze is noticed behind the dessert like scents.  The taste is full of some dark chocolate that leaves a bitter taste on my palate. Roasty malts follow the cocoa and make way for a bit of the 9% to show through. Tasty  The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice stickiness about it.

Beautiful color contrast between the head and the color of the brew.  -Smell 3.5: Nice bouquet. I primarily smell toasted grains, but there is a nice undercurrent of chocolate. Very promising.  -Taste 4.5: Sweet taste up front, with a nice alkaline hoppiness and a slight bitterness. There is also a very pleasant sourness. Lots of caramel, chocolate and toasted barley after swallowing...long aftertaste of toasted grains. Just a bit too sweet for me, but delicious nonetheless with a depth of flavor that must be experienced first-hand.  -Mouthfeel 4.0: Good mouthfeel. The carbonation present in this beer serves to balance the high alcohol content that otherwise would have been noticeable. Still has a slight burning sensation in the mouth, but it is not distracting.  -Overall 4.0: Excellent stout. These ""Imperial"" or ""Russian Imperial"" stouts all have a relatively high alcohol content, but this is balanced by a depth of flavor and a drinkability not common in other high-alcohol brews. Really, these could be viewed as ""dark triples,"" due to the amount of ingredients that go into each beer. ""Old Rasputin"" is highly recommended.

A - Black with brown barely around the edges, brown head (and you can have as much as you want depending on how you pour).  S - Alcohol and malt  T - Alcohol, caramel, roast, and malt. The roast falls into the category I refer to as 'fireplace'. This is a little much when it is cold, but as you would expect, as it warms it all comes together in a nice package.  M - Thick, with a little tickle from the carbonation, very nice.  O - I wish I knew the age on this, but since I don't I'll just have to pick up one or two 4-packs so I can try a bottle every 3 months or so.

T- The best part of the beer. Its roasted malt and chocolate up front with some espresso notes peeking in. At 9% ABV, the booziness is not overpowering at all, but you can tell its there.  M- Medium-heavy. Goes down smooth. Not quite as rich and full as one might expect.  O- A shining example of a good Russian Imperial Stout.

112,412,setexascustoms,4.38,"Poured from a 12oz bottle.  A: Black as night, no perceptible light makes it through this beer. Rocky mocha colored head recedes rather quickly but leaves very nice lacing down the glass.  S: Chocolate, coffee and deep roasted malts dominate the nose. Smells very rich, with some boozy alcohol.  T: Dark chocolate and espresso with a dark cacao like bitterness. Slightly burnt, charcoal kind of flavors make their way in toward the finish, along with some warming alcohol. Your left with clean coffee and dark chocolate in the aftertaste that last until you drink again.  M: Big and full bodied, with fine bubbled carbonation that gives this beer a smooth, creamy mouth feel.  O: A big beer that does not disappoint.

Smell: Sweet. Malty, but with more hops than I was expecting in this beer. The alcohol does not come through in the taste.  Taste: Fairly bitter coffee taste that lingers in the mouth; not at all a bad thing, considering how well it plays with the overall flavour.

The aroma is mildly malted and pleasantly hopped with a bit of licorice and a scent that makes me think of a wooden barrel. The body is medium to bold. The flavor has a mellower than usual malty taste for a Russian Imperial with a vibrant bitter but dry hopped ending.

112,412,BigCheese,4.61,"I think this bottle is a bit old, looked like it had been on shelf for a little while, tough to know for sure.  A: Pours a thick ink black. Pours a pretty thick head that is a cardboard colored head. Literally leaves a wall of lacing around the glass.  Smell: Dark Chocolate malts, oak, whisky, booze, hints of fruit maybe cherry/rasins.  Taste: Get hit with some sweet/slightly bitterness. Quickly changes to rich dark chocolate, hot chocolate (euro kind), burnt crust, honey bourbon, taste lingers for a while. For a really long time. Hop bitterness doesnt come through until it warms, beer really evolves as it warms. I'd drink this just below room temp for ideal consumption.  Mouthfeel: quite carbonated. A tad boozy but not in an unpleseant way. Once beer settles and warms its incredibly thick/syrupy. Could easily take down 2, maybe 3 of these, after that flavor/alcohol would be a bit overwhelming.  O: A perfect cold weather beer. Its got a great boozy warmness to it. Flavor evolves as beer warms which keeps taste buds interested. Taste lingers for a long time.

Head holds excellently - dark brown, holds well, finger of head throughout. Nose is smoky, with a great burnt malt nature to it. Excellent for winter.  Taste is like the nose, burnt malt, but with a nice balance of hops in there that gives this drink a unique flavor to it beyond the standard russian imperial stout. Full, thick body, gas like - not the best stout body I've head, but a formidable competitor.

112,412,TrapFan11,4.97,"Just finished my second 12 oz bottle of this and DAMN is that good. Most of my experience with beer has been with Belgian strong Ales, in particular all of the Trappist beers along with similar Belgian brands and American beers in the Belgian style. My two favorite beers are Rochefort 10 and St Bernardus 12. In recent years I've been trying different Stouts and Porters and, although I don't have tremendous experience with them yet, I'm quickly discovering the world of flavors out there that go beyond the various dark fruits and assorted sugars that accompany your typical Dubbles, Triples and Quadruples.  A fellow shopper at the market recommended Old Rasputin Imperial Stout to me and I've been blown away by how something so roasted and bitter can at the same time be sweet and smooth. From the get go this beer is thick, viscous, and oily, not that that's to it's detriment. In fact the wonderful chewiness just hooks you into discovering the many wonderful facets of the beer. Immediately you taste the full intensity of the coffee, toffee, roasted malts and baker's chocolate it has. There's a burnt quality to the malt that, along with providing a pleasant bitterness, also includes the required sweetness that is reminiscent of a burnt s'mores marshmallow rather than anything unpleasant. Then there's the coffee flavor. I tend to drink really dark, black coffee and this beer has loads of that toasty, smokey and bitter flavor that I cherish. Finally there's the great Christmas toffee and dark chocolate flavors that blend seamlessly with the sweetness and bitterness of the other flavors and tie everything together nicely.  Also quite remarkable it this beer's head, which is truly like a silky pillow. I can easily say that the foam tasted and felt in my mouth like a liquid marshmallow. I've never had a beer whose head was that silky, smooth, and sweet. I couldn't believe it was beer foam.  In the short amount of time I've been exploring Imperial Stouts I can easily say that this the best I've come across so far. I'm happy to give it my highest recommendation.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,rundocrun,4.46,"Poured from 12 oz. bottle into a snifter.  A - Pours like a bottle full of midnight darkness. Completely opaque with no highlights to speak of. Yields nearly 3 fingers of dark khaki colored head that lasts forever. Lots of lacing stuck to the glass and good amount of alcohol legs to this beer.  S - Coffee and dark, almost burnt caramel aromas are most noticeable. Hints of dark chocolate, raisins and burnt bread come through as well. Big booziness comes through with warming.  T - There is an immense bitter coffee and burnt grain presence up front. Slightly fruity booziness cascades in toward the middle along with more dry grainy bitterness. A very complex caramely and oh-so-slightly nutty malt body darts in and around everything else. Warmth lasts through the finish and is complimented nicely by a rich, slightly biting espresso flavor.  M - Very thick, viscous body to this beer. It's not often that I run across a stout (even a RIS) that matches the ""motor oil"" description in both looks and texture! Despite the thickness, the carbonation remains balanced enough that it doesn't detract from the complex flavor profile of the beer.  Overall- this is a truly excellent beer. A first-class representative of the style.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,neophilus,3.95,"Pours a deep, dark brown with an intense mocha colored head that erupts in the glass. Hints of ruby sparkle in the light. Need some time to let the foam settle down. The aroma is sweet and spicy, more hop character than I was expecting. Underneath flowed a current of roasted bitterness, barely detectable against the strong hop smell.  The first sip greeted me with full bodied roast flavor. Thick and sweet but a balanced hop bitterness to keep the flavor clean. The beer is surprisingly smooth and easy drinking. The body is heavy but doesn't stick to the mouth, washing away with a firm bitterness from the hopping.  As the beer warms more fruity flavors emerge. Notes of raisins and plums against the roasted backdrop. It lends some depth to the flavor but continues to wash away cleanly with a smooth body and bitter aftertaste on the palate.  This beer was a little bit of a surprise. A good dose of hop aroma up front anchored by the roasted scent. A strong backbone of hop bitterness and roast carries a fruity undertone. The mouthfeel was rich and smooth but washed away cleanly. Aftertaste left a firm bitterness that cleaned up the strong flavors and begged another sip.

However, The perfect balance of recognizable flavors is what makes this beer so good. It's not too complex, but still a joy for the palate.  M: Like I said above, not too thick - but very full. Finish leaves some traces of the alcohol in the back of my throat, betraying its 9% status.  O: Why buy any other Impy Stout?

112,412,One2Remeber,4.45,"Filled my growler a couple hours ago, pouring into a tulip.  A: Pours a rich, creamy thick head with a tint of light espresso. Dark as could be with light carbonation bubbles raising to the top.  S: Rich caramel, black licorice with some creamy milk chocolate notes to balance out the high alcohol undertone.  T: I'm glad there is great head retention because as the first sip hits your lips you get a fluffy marshmallow feel. Follows is an explosive taste of rich dark chocolate, with an alcohol presence only at the end that blends with the black licorice. Very complex taste overall, yet masterfully balanced resulting in a hell of a treat for the ol' pallet.  M: Not really bitter, alcohol presence is more like a smooth whiskey than a high alcohol beer (ex: barelywine). Extremely robust taste takes over the mouth feel but does not dominate to the point its unbearable or one sided towards a characteristic, which makes it very enjoyable.  O: Not my first Old Rasputin and not my last. This is my staple Russian Imperial Stout, not the best one I've had (Marshal Zhukov is out of this world from Cigar City:), but one that is readily available which gets brownie points.

112,412,Retail1LO,2.99,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. I started drinking this fairly soon after it came out of the fridge. I started rating it and it really wasn't doing much for me, and the scores reflected it. I started to wonder how much of that was a result of it being too cold. So I've been letting it warm up, and giving it little nips every few minutes. It's starting to come around. I think I might take the rest of the six pack out of the fridge and just keep it at room temp. This had a nice, luscious, two finger crown at the top. The head seemed more fizzy than creamy. The nose is pretty faint. I all but inhaled beer through my nose trying to extract some kinda discernible characteristic, but I couldn't. It doesn't smell bad, so much as it just doesn't smell. The first thing I notice with the taste is the booze. The 9% is in your face, and not even remotely hidden. Some slight coffee notes, but mostly just...booze. When it was cold, the mouthfeel was very carbonated and really unpleasant. As it's warmed, it's gotten much creamier and coats the mouth with a slightly bitter aftertaste. Over all, I just don't get the fuss. I have three bottles left with which to form a different opinion, however. If it changes, I'll be back to edit..but right now, this just really isn't my thing.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

A: Pours a three finger head of wonderful cream, great thickness, and amazing retention for the ABV. Solid black colour.  Sm: Cream, caramel, and light chocolate. A mild strength aroma.  T: Lovely cream, caramel, and light chocolate. Simplistic, but pleasant and nicely built. Decently balanced.  Mf: Smooth, wet, and creamy. Suits the flavours of the body.  Dr: Very drinkable for its high ABV, but the alcohol is noticeable to its detriment. It's a high quality brew that I quite fancy, and I'd love to try it on draught, but it's not without its flaws.  [My original rating was lost due to BeerAdvocate changing the weight each category had with zero advance notice. I think I intended to give it a B?]  *** 03/19/18 impression from a bottle:  This runs ~$9 per 4 pack in Austin, TX. One of my favourite go-to Russian Imperial Stouts alongside Victory's Storm King - especially given its fair pricing.  9% ABV. ""Russian Imperial Stout.""  Pours an opaque black that isn't quite a jet black, with a khaki coloured head atop. The head lasts a good 10 minutes in spite of its high ABV, which is most impressive. Creamy, frothy, robust, and thick headwise.  Aroma hints at dark fruit and fruitcake along with the usual dark malt sweetness. I guess date is the most prominent fruit note. Quite a reticent aroma in any case, particularly for a 9% ABV imperial stout. I don't get any roast, coffee, or even chocolate (malt). Very restrained compared to many expressions of the style.  Taste marries evocative dark fruit (plum, date, fig, prune) with dark malt sweetness and cacao-like chocolatey flavour to great effect, never betraying its high ABV to the drinker. I could do with more roast(ed barley), but it's lovely as-is and it's surprisingly balanced. Not boozy at all. Finishes grapey with lingering malty sweetness, but it's never cloying or saccharine.  Texture is impossibly soft, silky, velvety, and sleek for such a potent brew. Full-bodied but nevertheless drinkable. I could see it being better with more dryness (as from roasted barley, ideally), but it's fine as-is walking the line between dry stout and porter. Definitely something of a meal in a glass but it never feels too bready or filling and it's not overbearing.  Overall, it's as good as I remembered it - a dependable affordable Russian imperial stout with plenty of depth of flavour and more than adequate complexity. I don't know that I'd necessarily pick this over Storm King - I'd have to try them side by side to really make up my mind - but this is a must-try beer for any discerning drinker and it's one of few beers I've tried already that I find myself revisiting year after year...I also see ample cellaring potential for this, but I know I'd never be able to hold the bottles too long given the temptation to drink them. Classic and dependable work from North Coast.  Low B / GOOD  *** 03/15/20 at $7.99 USD plus tax for a 4 pack in New Orleans, LA, I had to pick it up...  Dark fruit meets roasted barley and chocolate malts in this surprisingly well balanced and impossibly drinkable brew.  A classic - possibly even THE classic - in a very complex style. Many Johnny come lately stabs at the style are mere imitations of this beer, but few will find the longevity on shelves this does.  Many of the barrel aged additive-laden gimmick imperial stouts out there can't hold a candle to this in terms of quality and rarely come close to this in terms of price. I'm 10,000+ beers in, and for my money this beer is probably one of the best bang for your buck options on the planet. Bonus points for its regular appearances on HBO's Silicon Valley.

112,412,Daniellobo,4.21,"Quite the classic US RIS. Coming back to it on tap.  Presentation: 10 oz draft serving. The menu notes the main characteristic of the brew and Alc. by Vol. (10.5%) Served into a snifter.  A - Black pour with an rich creamy head, nice retention with a good surface memory and rich lacing.  S - Soft nose on this draft serving, a touch too cold to shine, roasted notes, chocolate, coffee...  T - Luckily the flavor is not half as shy as the nose began with long roasted notes, touch of coffee, more so of coffee with a nicely woven bitterness… touches of dark fruits under the roasted current.  M - Full body with medium-soft carbonation, rather creamy with a nice lingering bitterness.  O - Quite the great sipper, it does not let down despite the touch competition.  Notes: Nice opportunity to revisit it on tap… One of those invitational brews that stays up there, always worth a revisit. And for what it is the price-quality ratio of this serving is fantastic.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Raven3464,4.7,"Appearance: Old Rasputin has a beautiful pitch black body and pours a two inch brown, foamy head.  Smell: Sweet roasted malts, dark coffee beans, bitter chocolate, and a pinch of alcohol are all apparent.  Taste: Flavors and then more flavors! The taste cycles among flavors of sweet roasted malts, bitter chocolate, coffee, and some kind of dark fruit, almost like raisins. This is probably the most complex stout I've ever tasted and yet so smooth. There is a slight burn from the alcohol in the aftertaste, which just adds to the complexity in my opinion.  Mouth feel: The beer feels creamy and heavy, just like a stout should.  Overall: Once again, this is a complex, flavorful stout. I was expecting it to be good, but not this good.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,doopydoogle,4.31,"A- Brownish black with a brown head that dissipates quickly and leaves little lace.  S - Dark fruits, like cherries, red grapes, and plums. Carob and toffee with a bit of caramel are hanging out there too. Almost a spicy licorice/anise hint. Alcohol is definitely present in the nose. Tobacco, wood, and smoke cover an almost algae/vitamin aroma. Leather, chocolate, and malted milks balls are also there. Beef jerky and pepper. A great nose!  T - Salty sweet malts with a nice bitter that follows it up. Coffee and bittersweet chocolate give in to a good rounded toffee and burnt caramel finish that leaves some bitter but reveals a more rounded, supple, and pleasant roasted malt profile. Cassis, slight anise, and carroway flavors give the beer a spicy, fruity profile that complements the traditional stout character well. There's some cherries and dark berries back there with a bit of herbs and grass as well. Alcohol is definitely noticeable, but not overwhelming. The beer has a good acidity that doesn't overpower, with a quality malt profile that isn't particularly sweet. Very nice!  M - Very pleasant. Decent carbonation for the style and doesn't leave your mouth too sticky. A nice coating that leaves you with a good, dry finish.  O - An excellent beer! Outstanding nose, wonderful, dynamic flavor profile, and just an all-around quality example for the style.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,DaveBlack,4.3,"A: Completely pitch black beer with a two finger tan head. The head continues to form and grow after the beer is poured, then VERY slowly drops back down (in fact the head was still there by the time I finished this slow-sipping beer), leaving a fair amount of lacing in its wake.  S: Big aroma, delivering what you'd expect from a stout: lots of malty sweetness, chocolate, coffee.  T: Hits powerfully upfront with chocolaty sweetness, roasted malts and bitter coffee all in one go. The sweetness is pretty overwhelming, and I thought I was going to find this beer cloying until the sweetness disappeared leaving a nice chocolate malts bitterness in my mouth. Finishes strong with alcohol warmth.  M: Thick and creamy with very little carbonation. Tends to stick in the back of the throat.  O: A solid stout. Big flavors, good balance and it uses the alcohol to enhance the beer, rather than just hiding it completely. It is certainly sweet, but not cloyingly so. Definitely a sipper.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Complex, and very tasty.  O: This is one damn fine RIS. I'm glad I revisited this after a long time, I didn't know what I was missing. The nose could use some work, but the taste is phenomenal.

Lacing was present but it wasn't as viscous and sticky as I was hoping for.  S: roasted malts, coffee beans, espresso, some chocolate. It's not a strong smell but it's very pleasant and leads well to the taste.  T: strong complex taste composed of roasted malts, some hops, coffee, dark chocolate and ends with a rooty/medicinal taste. The good balance helps disguise the alcohol content. As the beer warms up the taste gets more concentrated and becomes stronger.  M: very nice feel, smooth and creamy on the palate. Full body yet feels very drinkable which is odd for the style.  O: an amazing offering for the style, this beer is downright yummy and perfect as a dessert beer.

Pours a pitch black with a huge chocolate colored head that seems to sit on top of the body of the beer for awhile. As the head diminishes thick lacing coats the sides of the glass. Smell notes of dark chocolate, caramel, toffee, and coffee. Taste chocolate, light coffee, a warm touch of alcohol. Carbonation is superb, but the beer seems a bit thin for a RIS.

M - Medium to low carbonation. Not quote silky. Enough carbonation to still tickle.  D - Medium. Richness of the malt and warming of the alcohol doesn't let you chug this one.

112,412,ChanChan,4.4,"Old Rasputin: Finally I get to reviewing a classic oldie but goodie. Poured from a 12OZ botella into a tulip glass.  Appearance: Very dark with a tinge of ruby-red showing when held to the light. An aggressive pour results in a huge root-beer-float type head. The lacing is casklike beautiful.  Aroma: Hops, roasted malt, chocolate and dark fruits. The hop presence in this beer is very pleasant it gives the impression that this beer is fresh even if it isn’t.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, carbonation is minimal in this beer, there is a slight coffee sourness in the finish.  Taste: Bitterness right up front, lots of coffee and chocolate. The chocolate note is perfect in this young beer. I Think with a year of age this beer will be fantastically smooth. The taste is also reminiscent to an Abyss in that it has a bit of saltiness in the finish. The bourbon barreling of the Abyss, of course, makes that beer much more complex than the Old Rasps. I wonder how my Old Raspy XIIth anniversary will compare to my 2009 Abyss, we'll see!  Overall: This is one of the most consistent and affordable Imperial Russian Stouts out there. In addition, it is available in 12OZ bottles! I had this beer at room temperature and I loved it! It’s no barrel aged stout but then again a 12OZ bottle of Old Raspy is only 1/6 the price of many of the popular imperial IRS bombers!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,JTSbeerislife,4.33,"12 oz. bottle, purchased from a good bottle shop, 7/2011, unknown bottling date as I did not have access to the “mother case” were the date is located. Stored in a temperature controlled environment since purchase.  Poured into a Dogfish Head Snifter.  Thick one finger head when first poured, which settles into a thin cap, easily revived with a swirl, a lively stout, tan colored head, deep black/brown color. Classic look for an IRS.  The smell hits you first with deep roasted coffee malt, intense dark unsweetened chocolate, vanilla, and as it warms some yeast sneaks out, rather complex and extremely enjoyable.  Incredibly rich flavor of roasted malt, distinct coffee and dark semi-sweet chocolate. DELICIOUS! Not overly sweet at all which I find to be very refreshing. Wonderfully balanced bitterness waits for you in the middle, are there some hops here? I think so. As this stout warms the chocolate intensifies, but you never lose that great balancing bitterness. Full bodied mouth feel, though you certainly do not notice the 9% ABV.  Very long finish of chocolate/coffee/malt, coats the mouth, and lasts forever. First class.  You really can’t ask for a whole lot more from an RIS. This is just flat out delicious! Despite the strength of this stout, or maybe because of it, I find it very easy to drink several of these back to back. It’s so good! As seems the norm for me, I feel the sweet spot temp wise is 55 degrees, when everything starts to explode from the glass.

It poured black and beautiful. I was intrigued and gave it a deep smell.. coffee with roasted malts is what I detected, in strong amounts. Wonderful smell and I could tell it was something that I would want to drink, and in fact I've brewed several stouts looking for this sort of ""in your face"" roasted/coffee aroma.  I tasted it and was not disappointed, just a wonderful Imperial Stout.  Heavy roasted flavor and coffee notes. Any carmel or chocolaty notes were beaten down by the omnipresent roasted malt. The taste would linger, and was really in-your-face. It was telling me that it was not to be messed with, when a strong, but pleasant, alcoholic-type aftertast slapped my taste buds into shape.  This beer seemed to have a good amount of IBU's, which the malt calms down a bit, but then the roasted malts bring the percieved bitterness back up to balance it perfectly.  I was very impressed by this beer. It tastes like the Imperial Stout that I've been trying to make.

The smell is coffee roast, chocolate malt, and burnt sugars - nice, roasty, and inviting. The flavors are no surprise - roasted malt, dark bitter and semisweet chocolate, dark fruits that have a bit of tang to them at the back of the tongue and bitter hops play through nicely as well - altogether very roasty and faintly smokey flavor. The mouthfeel is creamy like whole or chocolate milk and there is a presence of the alcohol.

112,412,chinchill,4.41,"12 oz bottle served in a pint glass.  The well-sized dark tan head was about as dense and lovely as could be short of a nitro-can or nitro-tap. The liquid appears black with just tiny glimpses of brown at the edges when backlit. The head has excellent durability and leaves lots of light brown lacing.  Rather aromatic for a stout, with an easily detectable hop note over a rich dark malt aroma. The high ABV becomes more evident as the beer warms, but remains partially hidden. This high ABV is exceptionally well hidden in the taste and feel, however. The rich flavor, mainly from dark roasted malt, certainly contributes to the masking of alcohol flavors. There are dark chocolate and, less obvious, coffee notes in the finish. Almost no charred (burnt) taste components. Perfect sweet/bitter balance.  M - Exceptional mouthfeel, with a body that is nicely full for style, a creamy smooth texture, only the slightest alcohol tingle, and a modicum of lively tongue feel from the perfect carbonation.

112,412,Drazzamatazz,4.03,"A: This beer always pours so well it makes me wonder why it needs to be served on nitro. Dark body with a hugely attractive mocha head. Light doesn't make it fully through, but it does give off an almost deep ruby glow in the right angles. Great lacing from this one.  S: Dark malts, molasses, lots of roast. In fact most of the other aromas found could probably be labeled as ""burnt"". Burnt caramel, burnt chocolate, burnt hops, so on. Alcohol doesn't hide to well in this one. There is a certain level of earthiness here that is hard to describe.  T: Surprise, its a roast bomb. French roast coffee, baker's chocolate, high alpha hops. If you can get past the dark roast there's a dark fruit sweetness that can be found. I keep saying roast because its clearly the highlight, but there are enough subtleties to keep this one interesting especially as it warms.  M: Now I remember why this is always on nitro. For such a big stout the body on this one is a weird combination of high carbonation and a thinner body. Each sip leaves you with a drying warming sensation from the dark (somewhat astringent) roast and alcohol.  O: This was one of the first beers to really pull me into the craft beer world. It has a cult following for a reason and at $8 or less a four pack it is a great bargain. I do wish there was some medium between out of the bottle and on nitro though.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Smells very complex and delightful.  Very(!) smooth drinking. Starts out tasting of roasted (almost burnt) malt with a little bitterness (I presume from the hops), but then finishes with a very complex smooth chocolate coffee finish.  After taking a few drinks I noticed that the beer leaves a very faint lacing, and the head begins to recede. After warming a bit the beer just keeps getting better. It evolves into a bittersweet chocolate finish that somehow tastes bitter yet equally sweet. I would drink this at room temperature to get the full effect.  One of the best R.I.S.

Lots of chocolate, a bit of vanilla, a touch of hoppy bitterness, and a bunch of roasted malt all through. A very minimal bit of booze- pretty well hidden considering the beer's strength. All mixed together beautifully, a wonderful beer. Finish is bittersweet chocolate. An absolutely lovely stout.  Body is nice and full bodied, just as an imperial stout should be.

112,412,mayorwalda,4.4,"The basic walkthrough is something like this:  Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout pours great from a 12 fl. oz. bottle. As soon as the head begins to form the full bouquet is there from its smokey dark malt earth tones to its chocolatey sweetness and of course its 09% ABV--it is all there immediately and it's a beautiful thing.  The head is nice and thick--a good three finger head--but its airyness--that which gave us that beautiful strong bouquet--of course means it dies off pretty quick. What's left behind if a pretty, light, chocolate colored lace that hangs in there the whole time.  From the first sip I was in love with this beer's body and mouthfeel. It's got a perfect carbonation, leaving a potentially heavy beer lighter than one would expect. The mouthfeel however ends up being a bit creamy and in that way it's a pretty awesome ride to go from that unexpected crisp lightness to the obvious feel you want and expect from a stout.  The taste from beginning to end is full and certainly a bit more alcoholic than I like, but in a great way the somewhat higher alcohol content compliments the mouthfeel of this beer and certainly makes the ""warm finish"" they advertise on the bottle happen.  Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout is an experience for sure.

112,412,JayQue,4.38,"As I go through the last 25 or so beers on the Beer of Fame list, I am experiencing easy-to-find brews that I should have tried years ago. Old Rasputin is one of them. Poured into a pint glass from a 12 oz bottle. Dense dark brown color, very little light coming through. Good sized frothy tan head with good retention and thick bands of lacing. A good looking beer. Smell is pretty robust as well, mostly roasted malts and caramel malt.  Taste is outstanding. Malts rule but there is a good chocolate presence and HOPS!!! There is a good bitterness in the finish that enhances the experience. A great blend of flavors.  Mouthfeel is rich with a hops bite at the end. There is a warming alcohol presence as well that does not take from the drinking experience.  This is a really good RIS.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Converge,4.65,"12oz bottle poured into a 16oz tulip. Here goes my first RIS!  A - Pours with a thick, three-and-a-half-finger head, dark mocha in color. Totally black color for the beer. Probably the darkest beer I've ever seen. Good head retention and fantastic lacing.  S - Tons of roasted malt, rich dark chocolate, and crisp floral hops. I'm actually surprised at how prominent the hops are on the nose.  T - Whoa! Talk about full flavored. Upfront this beer is packed with roasted and burnt malt, espresso bitterness, and subtle but sharp hops. First sip finishes with a thick, warm, roasted bitterness that just assaults the palate. After the initial shock to my taste-buds, this stout shows a sweeter side as well. I can pick out a strong chocolate flavor very easily, as well as notes of dark fruit and molasses. The alcohol is pretty warming, but the actual taste of the booze is masked incredibly well under this barrage of dark flavors. The crisp, floral hops give the finish a clean, almost herbal feel without feeling too astringent for my palate. A touch of brown sugar and caramel is also present near the end. Very well crafted flavor profile here.  M - Heavy body, really viscous with a creaminess to it as well. Decent amount of carbonation as well. Finishes quite dry from all of the bitter flavors present, but not too dry. Warm alcohol presence is also detectable, but certainly doesn't hint to a 9.0% ABV. Towards the end, the feeling even becomes fairly sticky. Strong and full bodied without being too overwhelming. Could have been a bit smoother, however.  D - As mentioned, this beer is my introduction into RIS's, and I definitely enjoyed my first. I must admit I'm not too fond of overly-hoppy beers, and I had my doubts on this one after the hoppy aroma, but the flavor turned out to be very well balanced and carefully crafted. Deceptively easy to drink too, making this one a bit of a sipper for a guy like me. This one really is a monster, but a tasty one at that. I'm happy to have three more bottles sitting around.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,elvisnj,4.24,Poured into a tulip glass from 12oz bottle.  Looks pitch black with small dark brown head. Looks like a stout should. Smell is fantastic. Yeast and dark malts abound. Espresso and hops as well. I love the aroma of this beer.  Taste is light on the tongue for a stout but has bitter aftertaste. Not a clean hop type bitter but like a lingering espresso bitter. Tastes good but the aftertaste is just a slight drag.  The dark malts are evident in taste and hops come through nicely but not over the top. keeps a thin cream colored head throughout. All 12oz are gone in just a few minutes despite the fact that I am trying to savor this. Overall a good showing for the style and for North Coast Brewing Co.,North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,draheim,4.3,"12oz bottle (no dates or codes, but purchased earlier this year) poured into a snifter. Pitch black color with a light brown loose head the quickly dissipates to a tan ring around the glass.  Aroma is rich, roasty dark malt, cocoa, and a whiff of booze.  First sip is bitter dark roasty malt and bitter dark chocolate. Nice dry bitterness on the finish. As it warms it just gets better. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth.  What I really like about Old Rasputin is its purity, simplicity. This is a rock-solid, clean, straightforward RIS that exemplifies the style.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,CaptJackHarkness,2.12,"First, I must disclose that this is my first Russian Imperial Stout and if this is typical of the style, I won't be having too many more! This brew has in it's favor an almost black color and a nice rich aroma, you can smell the alchohol. But, it's all about the taste! This tasted far too bitter and hoppy, and left a horrible aftertaste in the back of the mouth! Again , I enjoy sweet stouts, like Murphy's, so make your judgements accordingly!!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,WillCarrera,4.43,"On Nitro tap at Jupiter in Berkeley.  A- Pour just about black, totally opaque, with a huge turbulent khaki head. The head on this beer is amazing, it eventually settles to an incredibly creamy, khaki layer about a finger deep. Produces a heavy coating of lace.  S- Lots of roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, some vanilla.  T- The flavor here is massive. The malts are big and heavily roasted, with fistfuls of roasted coffee beans with some chocolate and char. Hops become more noticeable once you can get past the malts, some citrus is hidden in there. Finishes dry with some sweetness and a lot of alcohol, which is just a bit warming.  M- I can hardly even describe this. Full bodied and unbelievably smooth and creamy. The nitro produces a thick, rich feel. It mellows out after a while but the first few sips are like drinking a milkshake.  O- My first nitro experience and I'm really impressed. This beer retains all of the great flavors of a Russian Imperial stout but the feel on this brew is really incredible.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,HoppySuds,4.47,"A - Pours thick with just enough head to dust up the great aroma  S - Rich coffee, with a hint of the sweetness of chocolate. Alcohol comes through hot in the end.  T - Sweet and rich with roasted malts and coffee coming through strongest. Warming alcohol finish does not overwhelm the pallet .  M – Great creamy texture that fills the mouth.  O – Overall this was a great beer. I’m really enjoying the imperial stouts in general but this is one of the best examples. If someone is looking to try an imperial stout for the first time this would be one of my top suggestions.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,paxchristi,4.53,"This is yet again another classic. I must also admit a bias. Old Rasputin is what got me into craft beer about a year ago. Its still as good as the day we first met. :-)  Appearance: Dark as night. Pours a stout the way an imperial stout should look; a generous amount of dark chocolate color head that leaves lacing down the glass. Brilliant head; one of my favorite heads. The head is frothy on the underside and it is like cream on the top side. After the froth subsides, there is still a good quarter to a half inch of creamy head that sticks. It was just begging me to sip it; so I did!  Smell: Dark coffees, dark fruits, special dark chocolates, and pleasantly burnt roasts of malt. And HOPS damn it! HOPS!  Taste: It is absolutely sensory overload. Once again, dark coffees, darker fruits (figs, dates, etc), special dark chocolates, dark roasts of malt, and an ever faint hint of molasses. On the front (which does not last very long) are the fruiter flavors, but very quickly comes this huge rush of kick-your-ass flavor of the roasted ingredients. It finishes bitter, and is held together by this hoppy brilliance. It has an almost spicy quality to it. I imagine because of the higher ABV that it has some esters in it. Hence the spiciness. The hops nail the dark roasts and fruits to my palate. The bitter darks with the semi-sweetness of the chocolates and dark fruits give it a cult flavor that few will comprehend the greatness!  Mouth: It has an above average amount of carbonation for a Russian Imperial Stout. Probably a bit more than what one should be used to. It adds to the spiciness of the esters and gives the bitterness of the hops a sensory kick on the palate.  Overall: This brew kicks my ass. I'm a IPA/APA drinker and so I love hops. But I also love artisan dark roasts of coffee. This is the necrobaby of these two worlds for me. I've been converted to the cult of Rasputin. Old Rasputin RIS will always have a special place in my fridge or in my collection. It is a beer-drinkers treasure and every drop should be savored. I believe that I could session this beer. Not because I'm going to be drinking more than 3-4 pints of it, but because it demands respect and that you cherish its company while it is there. This isn't your one night stand; wham, bam, thank you mam-- this is a beer that deserves to be cherished and treated like the gem that it is. This brew and I have a long life together. Cheers mate!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,StayWounded,4.73,"I am a little bias as this is one of my go-to beers. I've had it both on-tap and in the bottle multiple times.  A- Looks as a Russian Imperial should. Deep, dark body, with a strong mocha head that lingers well.  S- Lots going on here. Dark fruits, coffee, chocolate, a nice roasty smell. You can definitely smell the warmth of the alcohol on this one.  T- On-tap the flavors coalesce in a more subtle way, very nicely. It is bold as a Russian Imperial should be, and the warming heat hits the back of the throat. I can see that being a problem for some drinkers, but it is nice, especially during winter months (and even more so when you live on a mountain). The primary flavors are the chocolate and coffee and the dark fruits, bitterness comes though with a bit of sweetness towards the middle to end.  M- Very warm and smooth with a bit of thickness. The bottle is a bit less smooth and less, thick. The warmth is the stand out characteristic.  Overall- I've got to say this is one of my favorite beers. Affordable given other options and very drinkable. Excellent during winter and excellent for night in.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,Gambrinus1184,4.23,"Served on nitro-tap in a snifter glass at Mikro in Hamden, Conn.  A: Black as night with a dense, two-finger head of creamy, tan foam which left chunks of lace on the glass and persisted throughout the finish.  S: Roasted black malt, spicy fruity notes, chocolate, raisin and a whiff of booze to add complexity.  T: Bitter, herbal, roasted malt flavor that gives off espresso bean, cocoa nib and fig flavors. Lots to work with here as a bitter, herbal hop rushes the palate, lending earthy, tobacco leaf qualities to the mix. Finishes bittersweet with some clingy, dark sugars and a smooth, creamy roasted aftertaste.  M: Creamy, full-bodied stout with a bit to chew on as well. Very smooth, deep and complex.  O: For the barleywine fan in your life, Old Rasputin is almost as good as it gets. The nitro-tap presentation here adds another dimension of complexity and enjoyment to the mix. Dangerously drinkable at 9% ABV, this stout is a favorite to have on hand during the cold winter months but is a treat for a dreary summer evening as well.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,psuKinger,4.31,"Bottle (I find no date on the bottle... FreshBeerOnly says North Coast stamps only the cases) poured into my Stone RIS tulip glass.  A: Pours a deep dark bitch black with a lively light-brown frothy head on top... more than a fingers worth, and ""pancake batter"" bubbles in the middle.  S: Roasted malts and a touch of chocolate in the nose, all done at a moderate volume.  T: Smooth yet thick, this stout is simultaneously creamy yet heavy. Roasty flavors from the malts arrive first, then hints of chocolate creep in. Additionally, I even pick up on a touch of vanilla here, which is something I personally don't usually pull out of a big stout like this. It finishes with a perfect amount of hop bitterness to round this all out, and on the very back this beer creams up and says ""goodbye"" with a hint of vanilla on the end.  Great balance. One of my favorite Stouts.  M: Thick and viscous, the carbonation is initially masked by the heft of this brew. It is only in the way this beer creams up at the end that it once again shows it's ability to remain balanced and complex.  D/O: There is just a HINT of alcohol in this. Not nearly as noticable as something like Yeti or Mokah, but it still can be seen, and for me it's just a touch detracting from its drinkability/overall.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

S - Dark, roasted malt aromas. A nice medley of dark fruits, chocolate, and coffee aroma.  T - It's a bit similar to how it smells, with a roasted flavor coming up front, and very little detectable alcohol.  M - More carbonation than your average RIS. Medium heavy body, a bit on the lighter side for a RIS, which makes it more appropriate for regular consumption than some of the massive stouts out there.

112,412,doopiedoopiedoo,3.85,"Picked this one up during my USA trip.  Poured into a pint glass.  Comes out black, very black. Carbonation is very present. A nice two finger mocha head leaving a some lacing as the head reduces to a half finger.  Smells of dark roasted malts and chocolate. I notice a lot of hop and that gets me excited for I love hoppy stouts.  So the flavor do deliver the hop I wanted but it's lacking in some other departements. It doesn't quite give you that in your face I'm a stout feel. Sure there is some roasted malts and there is some chocolate present but it's to crisp and clean to be a real imperial stout.  It's medium bodied and extremely smooth. A little more carbonation than I'd like in my stouts.  I really enjoyed this beer. I drank one and poured me another one right after so it has to be a good beer one way or the other. I loved the hoppiness that comes with it.

I think this is easily the best looking, most intense strong stout i've had the honor of pouring. A huge rocky tan head forming over a deep BLACK brew. The lacing on this one blows away other Imp Stouts I've had in the past...just perfect.  A fresh, albeit uncomplicated scent of mostly chocolate, followed by a bit of coffee. A slight hint of bitter hops, could be the alcohol though, as well.  Taste follows scent. Good, but did not blow me away. A super clean beer...the chocolate malt dominates...a nice bitter kick at the end. This one doesn't have some of the complexities that I really liked in Stone IRS or even Yeti. However, the Raspy is uber-smooth on the backend, booze is barely noticeable...and still a top notch Imp stout, especially considering the affordability.

112,412,zac16125,4.01,"Old Rasputin RIS 12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass  A: Pours out an opaque jet black with 3+ fingers of light creamed coffee colored head. Head is very dense and takes forever to dissipate down to a 1 fingers width that hangs around for the rest of the drink and leaves massive, heavy lacing.  S: Milk chocolate is the most prominent aroma, along with strong scents of alcohol and roasted malts. Hints of caramel malts as well.  T: The first sip is big roasted flavors with lots of chocolate sweetness as well as a strong citrus hop character. There are subtle coffee flavors in there as well. However, for most of the drink, the most prominent flavor is the citrus hop bitterness. I found the taste to be pretty unique for a stout, especially the strong hop characters and what for most of the drink was a lighter although still present malt character. The alcohol character that was prominent on the nose is almost completely masked in the taste, which is nice. I like the taste, but could see how others wouldn’t as the flavors aren’t as strong as many other RIS I have had.  M: Really light bodied for a stout, and slightly over carbonated which decreases its smoothness. It is easy to drink though, and as above, the alcohol is masked very well. It also has a nice warming character to it.  O: Overall, quite a good RIS.

112,412,DabblinWiscCraft,3.95,"Passed to me in a pint glass, a deep roasted coffee or cola color with an espresso crema head about 3/4 inch that really sticks around, leaving nice lacing. Roasted coffee and caramel notes are at the front in the nose. There's a bit of sourness and some hop complexity in the mix, as well. Very nice dark chocolate undertones. The taste has rich, dark roasted caramel malts at the fore. There's a burst of quite enjoyable hop zest following this, which is almost completely enveloped by a somewhat syrupy molasses taste with pure alcohol showing through. Unfortunately, this flavor closely resembles cough syrup. The finish has roasted coffee mingling with hop bitterness and more subtle dark chocolate. Certainly, more hop flavor than I expected from a Russian Imperial Stout. The mouthfeel is very smooth throughout and medium-bodied. It's just a bit too syrupy for my liking--again, it's hard to get past that cough syrup sensation happening toward the back. But, overall, this is a very pleasant feel for a beer of this style.  It was a real treat to find this on tap at Von Trier on North Avenue in Milwaukee, as I've rarely seen it around town. In some ways it lived up to the hype surrounding it, but in others it was a bit disappointing. It has more hops than most beers of this style, but that isn't really a detraction for me. I disliked the fact that too much alcohol was showing through and producing that medicinal or cough syrup effect.

There is about two fingers worth of dense, tightly packed dark tan head that slowly recedes leaving behind sheets of lacing.  The aroma is comprised of roasted malts with lots of chocolate and coffee, with hints of vanilla. There is quite a hop presence for a RIS. The alcohol is mildly present in the nose, but not overwhelmingly so.  The flavor is much bigger than the aroma would lead you to believe. Loaded with heavily roasted malts and chocolate, and accented by coffee and a slightly burnt quality. The hop presence is quite bright and noticable. The citrusy hop character seems to meld well with the roasty and chocolatey flavors that define this beer. Almost too much hop presence... Almost.

It has a smooth roasted coffee and cocoa. It has a wonderfully bitter finish that entices one to sip and enjoy further. I can get mild notes of oats and caramel but they are very faint.

Not as complex as many RIS beers, but excellent, especially when compared to the widely distributed examples.

I can imagine Old Rasputin is what happens when the flavor of Guinness Foreign Extra meets the feel of Guinness Draught. But that's way to simple. Old Rasputin has an amazing full-bodied thick and creamy mouth that just isn't present in any other stout I've ever encountered. Somehow, the best of many worlds is what you get with Old Rasputin.

112,412,DarthKostrizer,4.15,Look: Black as my soul. 2 inch head my fault on the pour and great retention and lacing throughout  Smell: Bitter chocolate and coffee upfront with just a hint of hops  Taste: Same as the nose. Roasted malts and bitter chocolate upfront with a bit of coffee in the middle  Mouthfeel: Full body low carbonation and a bit thick and syrupy  Overall: Let me start off by saying fresh I do not care for this beer at all so I decided to age a couple for 1 1/2 years and it was the best decision I could have made. The flavor profile is so much nicer and the alcohol burn is gone. I really really enjoyed this beer so much that I actually cracked another one and put some vanilla bean ice cream in it and made a beer float and it was absolutely amazing.,North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,DeltaGolfSierra,3.85,"The menacing picture of Rasputin on the bottle is an appropriate start to this intimidating beer. Appearance is completely black; totally opaque with a big dark tan head. Chocolate scents are strong, with a slight alcohol smell on the nose as well. The chocolate carries into the taste, but is really overpowered by the hops - perhaps a bit too much. There is a grape or fig taste lingering in the background, with a surge of bitterness in the finish. Not quite what I was expecting. Mouthfeel is full-bodied. A good beer overall, but a very bold and heavy one that I'd not drink on a regular basis.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

S - Roasted malts, coffee, chocolate and alot of booze.  T - Coffee, chocolate and dark fruits with a slight bitter aftertaste, and alcohol which is mild and doesn't overwhelm the flavor but leaves a slight pleasant warmth down the throat.  M - Smooth with a slight oily feel and low carbonation.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Jeffo,3.2,"My man Doopie brough some of these back on his last trip to the USA. I've had this beer several times and reviewed it back in 2009, so it was time for a re-review. To be honest, I'm never quite sure what I think of this one.  From a bottle into a snifter.  APPEARANCE: A black, but not quite pitch black, pour yields a three finger, medium looking tan head with great retention. Black body with higher levels of carbonation for the style. Head slowly fades to a thick cap and clings to the sides. A full wisp and ring remain until the end and leaves some nice lacing down the glass. Nice looking stout.  SMELL: A decent strength nose of roasted malts and lots of baker’s chocolate. Brunt malt, caramel as well, with plenty of flowery hops. A hoppy, roasted, chocolaty nose. Very good and appealing, but needs to be slightly more forceful for world class status.  TASTE: Not nearly as impressive as the nose. Some roasted malt up front but only touches of chocolate at the swallow. A bit empty through the middle. A spicy and very hop bitter finish with plenty of floral and pine flavors. Not much roasted or chocolate flavor for an imperial stout, and lots of hoppy and spicy booze at the swallow. Medium strength and lingering aftertaste is spicy, bitter, with lots of hop and some booze as well. The roasted and stout components, which were nicely present in the nose, are very mute here. It’s like they forgot this was an imperial stout while they were hopping the shit out of it.  PALATE: Medium-full body and quite creamy smooth on the palate. Goes down smooth and finishes slightly dry on the palate. Good feel for the style.  OVERALL: Make no mistake about it, this is a tasty and enjoyable beer. It’s just not a tasty and enjoyable imperial stout. This is an extremely hoppy brew, but it’s extremely hoppy at the expense of being extremely stout. If you like hoppy stout-like beers, this is definitely one worth tracking down. As far as imperial stout beer is concerned, however, this one is certainly lacking some of the patented flavors that define the style. This is certainly a brew I’ll have again, but not if I’m craving an imperial stout.

112,412,doughanson78,4.03,This is an edit of my original review as I've tried others and developed a taste I wanted to give this another shot.  My first Russian Imperial Stout. 12oz. bottle poured into a 16oz. Snifter.  A: Pitch black. HUGE fluffy 3 finger head. Light brown in color. Beautiful lacing. Head dissipates super slowly.  S: Very dark chocolate. Roasted malts. Faint bitter hops. Faint hints of coffee.  T: Bitter chocolate and coffee up front. Nicely roasted. Light alcohol warming throughout. Very light sweetness.  M: Full-bodied. Fairly creamy. Alcohol warming but not bad.  O: A very good Russian Imperial. If your not into the sweet chocolate IS's than this is definitely up your alley. Original post: (I was pretty disappointed with this beer. Maybe I just don't have the taste for Imperial Stouts yet. Loved the one Oatmeal Stout I tried. Got a Great Divide Yeti I'm gonna give a shot. Maybe I'll develop a taste for it.),North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Pours as black as can be, but notably this brew does not take on the viscous quality some beers this dark have. Light brown head.  Smell of substantial roasted malt, hint of sweetness and chocolate.  This is a tasty delicious beer. Burnt malt flavors, dark chocolate, espresso. Finish is intense coffee, drifting into a melded hop bitterness and some chocolate sweetness. Just tasty and the right balance between straightforwardness and complexity, making it very drinkable while also having a substantial mettle.  More or less full-bodied beer with decent level of carbonation that keeps things from weighing down.

112,412,mikestan06,4.36,"Let me start by saying North Coast is one of my favorite breweries, and Old Raspy is one of my favorite beers for good reason. At just $7.99/ 4pk, it's easily the most affordable and available RIS I've ever found.  A- Black black black, opaque with a thick, creamy mocha head that I just can't take my eyes off of.  S- Roasted malts take over; heavy coffee notes, chocolate.  T- God, I love stouts, and this is a beautiful explanation of why. Bitter dark chocolate, vanilla, coffee, and a hint of smoke. It's chewy and thick, yet dangerously drinkable at 9% ABV.  Be careful.

112,412,Eriktheipaman,3.86,Pours a black with brown highlights. Amazing khaki head that stays for much longer than expected.  The smell isn't what was expected. I pick up a slight bit of alcohol but mostly hops. A roasty citrus.  The taste is also very hop forward. As well as most of the roast leaning towards the bitter side of things. The alcohol comes through much more than I remember.  The body is on the lighter side and has a semi-dry finish.,North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,DavidST,4.83,"Old Rasputin and I go way back and I have a nostalgic attachment to it. I'm pretty sure 5 or 6 or so years ago, trying one of these was the experience which got me moved off of Guinness / Shiner and onto trying different craft beers.  I poured a pretty aggressive pour into an over sized wine glass. The head was a nice brown color 2 fingers thick, it quickly went away and leaves a nice thick lazing, there is also a thin layer of foam which lingers around the edges and stays on top. The color is pitch black, even around the edges no light gets in, beautiful.  The smell is wonderful, mostly coffee, dark roasted malts and barely hops.  The feel is great, tingling carbonation / alcohol, semi thick and velvety.  The taste is amazing, one of my all time favorites. Up front I'm hit with tasty chocolate / coffee and roasted malts, on the way down there is some nice hoppy / bitterness. A very well balanced marvelous taste, the higher alcohol is well hidden. It gets even more complex as it warms up (although then the alcohol isn't as well hidden).  Overall, I love this beer. I still think it would make my top 5 all time favorites and at only $9 for a 4 pack, its price is hard to beat.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

T - Right up front with roasted matls, with toffee and chocolate in there as well. Booze on the finish is belly-warming.  M - Very smooth and creamy, with a pretty full body.

112,412,StoutHunter,4.38,"I bought a bottle of Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout last week for $2.49 at The Lager Mill. I have never tried this beer before or any beers from North Coast Brewing, so I am interested to see what this beer and brewery have to offer. No visible bottling date but I think it's a 2011 vintage. Poured from a 12oz brown bottle into a snifter.  A- I like the label on this beer, it's pretty eye catching and classic looking. It poured a good looking pitch black color that resembled used motor oil. It had three fingers worth of fluffy tan head that died down to a thick layer that stayed the rest of the time.  S- I pick up loads of black coffee and dark chocolate aromas from the heavily roasted malts and it has a little bit of sweetness that resembles molasses. There was a slight presence of dark fruits along with a little bit of alcohol. This a pretty robust smelling beer that was dominated by the chocolate and coffee, I couldn't pick up any hops in the aroma.  T- Wow this is one robust tasting brew. The heavily roasted malts impart large amounts of dark bitter chocolate and the coffee takes on an espresso like flavor which I really liked. The molasses, brown sugar, and dark fruits are there but they are subtle and take a backseat to all the chocolate and coffee. The alcohol was hidden pretty well on this brew and was slightly warming. On the finish there is a very firm bitterness with a slight earthy hop flavor.  M- Chewy, slightly creamy, and pretty full bodied, just like it should be. The carbonation was on the high side and I didn't mind it.  Overall I thought this was a very good RIS. Old Rasputin seems to live up to all the hype very easily and is pretty much all the things a good RIS should be. As it stands now this has to be one of the better RIS's I have had but Founder's Imperial Stout remains my favorite of this style, but Old Rasputin came pretty close. Everything was pretty spot on for it's style and the only thing I would have changed would be a little milder bitterness but I am sure six months to one year in the cellar could take care of that. This may become one of my go to RIS's, it is just so much more available then Founders Imperial Stout. If you are a fan of stouts then this is a must try, it sets a nice standard for RIS's. This beer made for a good first impression from North Coast and I now see why this beer gets so many high regards, combined with price and availability it makes for one damn fine brew, can't wait to see what else North Coast is working with.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Smells robust and delicious.  T: Big on the coffee. Big time dark chocolate mixed with semi-sweet chocolate. Later on I notice a bit of dark fruit taste, along with slight acidity. You can taste the alcohol, but I know of no other beer that marries the alcohol and the beer flavors better than Old Rasputin. Hop bitterness across the palate in the aftertaste that cleanses the palate for more. After finishing about half the beer, it leaves a thick layer of bakers chocolate all across your tongue... nice! It doesn't have vastly complex flavors, but what flavors are there, are absolutely perfect.  M: Thick and chewy with light carbonation. Silky and smooth as it flows across the palate.

The color matches a 38 on the SRM beer color chart. Looks black until you hold it up to a strong light, then the reddish, dark brown color appears. Smell is a jack hammer of thick intense fragrances of dark chocolate, French brewed coffee, maple syrup, toffee, caramel, lime, and malt. The taste is very complex, with flavors of malt, dark chocolate, molasses, toffee, caramel, plum, and brown sugar.

Taste was much like the aroma, being dominated by chocolate and coffee with some nice hops up front. This brew masked the 9% very well. Medium-bodied and very smooth from start to finish.

112,412,Sweasty,4.32,"I have enjoyed this brew many times. I am just now getting around to reviewing it. Old Rasputin pours a deep dark black. It looks the part of used motor oil. It's not the blackest imperial I have had, but more than dark enough. Things are topped off by about three fingers worth of dark khaki head. Head settles to a ring. Plenty of sticky lace clings to the glass.  Onto the aroma. Dark roasted malts hit first. Dark roasted coffee notes stand out first. That's followed by a healthy dose of sweet milk chocolate. Behind the roasted coffee and chocolate, some licorice notes make an appearance. Some light dark fruit notes help round out the malt. Beneath the malt, a moderate hop presence shines. Herbal, slightly minty hops stand out. A light citrus like quality is present as well. All in all this is one hell of a complex nose.  The taste follows the nose. The hops in the nose are much stronger on the palate. Bitter hops hit first. Citrus notes, mostly grapefruit, are much stronger than the nose suggested. Some minty bitterness present as well. Beneath the hops, plenty of dark malts pop. Sweet chocolate takes control. Beneath the chocolate, dark roast coffee notes show up. A much stronger licorice quality is present. Dark fruit, blackberries perhaps, round things out. The finish is drying with a lingering herbal bitterness.  Old Rasputin is full bodied and somewhat viscous. A healthy carbonation tries in vain to cut through it all.  Old Rasputin was one of the beers back in the day that turned me onto stouts. The alcohol is masked quite well. Rasputin tastes strong but not boozy. It's definitely a hopped up stout. The hops are more dominate than a lot of imperial stouts. The hop bitterness helps cut the richness a bit. This is one tasty complex brew. All these years later it's still standing strong.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

The head slowly recedes to a foam that coats the surface of the beer. What more could you look for in an RIS?  Smell - Dark chocolate and coffee. Some hops come through, as this seems to be an RIS that is hopped to hell. Very nice aroma. Even my wine-drinking sister could smell the coffee in this when she took a whiff.  Taste - Dark chocolate and coffee again up front. Roasty flavors abound throughout the drink. Not a hint of sweetness to it. It finishes with a long hop bitterness. Great flavor, although it is extremely bitter in the finish.  Mouthfeel - Creamy and chewy. Great texture as it goes down. My only complaint is the bitterness in the finish.

Very smooth, and very balanced. This smells like what a RIS should be. Classic.  T- There's a reason this has a solid 'A' average. It's delicious. I've also had it on draft, and it was one of the best drafts I've ever had. Bottle version is still worthy though. All the smells come through in the taste, but a little stronger. Very balanced, although the hops in the aftertaste could be smoothed out just a tad. That's nitpicking though. Fabulous beer.  M- A little bite from the hops, otherwise this one is silky smooth. Not quite as smooth and rich as I'd like, but it's really good.  O- Overall, this is definitely one of my favorite in the style. Maybe not the best, but it's up there.

The aroma isn't as overpowering as I hoped, but still smells good. The taste is very similar with dark chocolate, coffee and roasted malts. The alcohol doesn't jump out at you. Finishes slightly bitter and goes down well. Not quite as flavorful as the bottled version, but definitely still enjoyable.  The mouthfeel is ridiculously smooth. Thick, heavy bodied and lesser carbonation than the bottled version. Overall, the nitro makes it beautiful in the glass, makes it go down smoother and makes it slightly more easy to drink. The tastes are less outstanding but still good. Again, still a great brew.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

A- motor oil body with a solid 3"" of dense mocha head that slowly disperses into curtains of lacing all down the glass.  S- Only really catching bitter chocolate and coffee here.  T- Roasty, sweet malts, coffee and dark chocolate  M- Starts off nice and creamy and full, then towards the middle loses a bit of it's body and seems to get watery, only to return with a solid finish.  O- Very impressed how well this beer does on nitro. Will definitely have again and again.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,goom,4.59,"Given its reputation, I was slightly disappointed, until I let the beer warm properly.  Pitch black, with a tight brown head. Leaves some nice lacing which creeps down the glass as I drink.  Massive nose. Chocolate and coffee, roasty malt, plenty of hops, a touch of sweet fruits, slight alcohol.  Taste is similar to the nose, chocolate and coffee pair with big roasty flavour, and bitter hops all assault you. Some dark fruits sweeten the finish and a touch of alcohol.  Medium to Full bodied, perfect carbonation. Not too thick, certainly not watery, the beer seems to coat the mouth beautifully.  I'm not too far into stout territory but this beer is fantastic, exceptional example of the style. Don't make the mistake of serving this too cold.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,MrKennedy,4.41,"12oz bottle purchased from Platinum Liquor, North Strathfield and poured into a Mikkeller tulip.  Visually spectacular, pouring a thick black with a ""top deck"" head of foam that is a darker tan down the bottom and lighter up top. Poured with two fingers of foam and settling down at a quarter-inch with some good glass lacing.  Aromas are hoppy initially, mixed with dark chocolate and some coffee. Big roasted malt smell as well which makes it enticing.  Nice mix of flavours, chocolate initially, hoppy in the middle and finishing with a touch of coffee.  Mouthfeel is great, coating the mouth, finishing with some roasted bitterness and hoppiness.  Overall, i can see why this is ranked by many as the top year-round RIS.

112,412,Knapp85,4.53,"Wow, I knew what this was going to look like after having it from the bottle a few times before. The Nitro just sets this brew off right from the start. It's got the deep black stout look to it. With a wonderfully thick creamy tan head that leaves a fantastic lacing down the glass. The smell has some pine on the nose with a deep roasted aroma following after. The taste is explosive, it's hoppy and has a masterful chocolate taste. The finish is dry and smoother than just about any beer I've ever had. The mouthfeel is creamy, heavy and silky smooth. Overall I never wanna have this from a bottle again.

In reviewing this beer, I tried to dutifully follow the guides and process so that I could write a useful, accurate, and objective-as-possible review.  Appearance - Poured a solid opaque black color with a small dark/tan head. Did not pour with a thicker, creamy head which left me disappointed (Would like to try this on tap)  Smell - A few things that stood out in my notes: dark chocolate, hints of coffee, and alcohol which was not masked as well as I would have liked (I might have poured too cold)  Taste - A hearty mix of chocolate and malt flavors and a touch of bitterness  Mouthfeel - Smooth and creamy, not too robust and not too watery  Overall - A distinct taste that's affordable and available; a great introduction to RIS that I will definitely revisit!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,sirdillon,4.18,"A- Pours black with quite a bit of carbonation. Big frothy(!) light tan head that sticks around pretty well. Leaves a beautiful dark lacing around the glass as I sip. Good stuff.  S- Like if you made a hop tea in a dark chocolate mocha. Except not much coffee. This is one of my favorite smelling beers out there, definitely one of a kind. Pine, dank marijuana, roasted barley, dark chocolate and a bit of alcohol heat are all there. Not much sweetness to be found. The alcohol is a bit prominent, but it's a fair trade off for a walk through the marijuana chocolate forest that is Old Rasputin.  T- Lots of hops and lots of deeply roasted coffee flavors. Finishes with a sensation of hop resin and coffee. Not much sweetness to be found, but very drinkable. There's some alcohol in the taste, but it's not too unpleasant.  M- This may be the weak aspect of this beer. I'd say it has a bit too much carbonation for an imperial stout, and has a somewhat light mouthfeel because of that. However, this is infinitely more drinkable than most imperial stouts because of this as well. Lots of hop resins coat the mouth, leaving a bit of a bitter aftertaste. Not cloying or syrupy in the least.  O- By far the best beer for the money that I've found thus far. Has a very distinctive and refined taste and smell. It's not perfect, but this is one of my favorite beers, and in my opinion it deserves great affection.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,shangwang,4.33,"Poured into my DFH snifter. No date on the bottle that I can find.  This was the first time I've tried anything brewed by Lost Coast. After this experience, I will be looking for more.  Old Rasputin was a deep brown-black color, and poured with over a finger of thick chocolate milk head. It left heavy lacing on the glass and the head stuck around for quite a long while. It had a great smell- roasted coffee, honey, and chocolate were all present. The taste was ridiculously complex. It started with chocolate bitterness, roasted malt, and earthy wood, but then at the back end of the taste there was an intense sweetness that matched the honey and chocolate smells. In my experience sweetness typically precedes bitterness, but this beer was quite the opposite, which I really enjoyed. There was some lingering bitterness the whole way through the finish, but nothing unpleasant. Mouthfeel was creamy, thick, and chewy.  Wow. This is a heavy hitter- the intense tastes and a heavy mouthfeel make for a beer I typically would only want one of, but I found myself desiring more after I finished the 12oz bottle. Very complex, but tasty. Definitely will be looking forward to having this one again, as well as some other offerings from Lost Coast.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Avantyawn,4.27,"A: Deep brown black, nice thick brown head. Looks typical of the style  S: Cream, chocolate, grains, smells much like a Cafe Latte. Slight eggy sulfur scent.  T: Creamy smooth balanced chocolaty malty RIS. Slightly sour bitterness.  M: Mouthfeel is good but a tad thin for my taste for the style.  O: Overall, this is a wonderful yearly RIS. Not much to say about this other than it's really very tasty and easy to obtain. Well done.

Not as sweet as the aroma hinted at. Roasted malts quickly come in strong with assertive coffee and smoky bitterness. Herbal hops on the finish with another round of bitterness. Mild alcohol spice and warmth, for 9% it is kept very well in check. Aftertaste is smoky and slightly dry.  M- Assertive carbonation, prickly on the tongue. Thick and silky smooth mouthfeel, drinks similar to an oatmeal stout.  O-A great imperial stout, satisfying on every measure. Tons of flavor without anything overwhelming, highly recommended.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

T: Tastes of dark chocolate and coffee with a little bit of raisin mixed with a malty complex aftertaste that finishes slighty bitter but smooth.  S: Strong brewed dark coffee with a little bit of chocolate and burnt oak. Has a sharpness to it of alcohol and slight fruitiness.  A: Very dark almost pure black in body with beige carbonation that comes up through the glass to form a tan two finger head. The had retains very nicely.  M: Mouthfeel is creamy smooth that is also heavy with sharp medium carbonation.

Noticeable aromas of roasted malt,chocolate,coffee,cherries,and anise rise from the glass. Strong roasted flavors,coffee,dark chocolate,with hints of dark fruits and plums. This beer also has a deep bitter component with a rich character. The only real knock on this beer is that the mouthfeel was a bit thin for an Imperial stout,if it was more viscous it would be an A+ beer to me. Any alcohol flavor is well hidden among the well balanced complexities and the great bitter coffee/licorice finish.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,SubpoenaDeuces,3.93,"Old rasputin  A: murky black with tan head foamy with lacing no light passes through, pretty solid example of the style  S: sweet raisin and dates with chocolate on the nose, some drying oak but not similar to an oak aged beer, if that even makes sense.  T: taste is chocolate with bittering hopiness, nice malty balance, standard coating, it is the Mario of the Kart racing world. Not exceptional but no complaints to articulate, just standard.  M: The mouthfeel its pretty impressive for such a widely distributed stout, nice coating and balance.  D: This is a well done stout, maybe its sheer availablity has prejudiced me but I dont feel that it is amazing. I wouldnt be able to have this consistently but it is a good occasional treat, the maltiness is good but just offers too much filling.  Narrative: NOBODY BUT NO BODY KICKS OLD RAZZIE OUT OF THE ROLLER RINK. Ok, keep your cool, you know that you are a smoothe debonaire guy, but how can those girls fail to see your individual aplomb and flair? It just isnt right! You have your velvet chocolate coat, your smoothe ways, your bitter discountenance but they all seem to write you off for guys in Pele Pele Jeans and southpole shirts. Where did you go wrong? Maybe it was the fencing lessons, maybe it was talking to every girl in the roller rink. Razzie you spread yourself too thin. How could I have been so stupid?

Full body stout thats creamy all the way down.  Overall - One of the best stouts I've ever had I wish more stouts tasted like this.

Taste follows the nose but with a great bitter aftertaste. Burnt malt stands out more so on the tongue than in the nose.  The mouthfeel was a little too thin for what I was wanting out of this beer.

112,412,beagle75,4.07,"Draft service with nitrogen propulsion at Yard House in Irvine.  A: Opaque black color with over one finger of dense and persistent beige foam head. Heavy, continuous sheeting of lace remains on the glass.  S: Generic dark roast is present, with a weak charcoal and mineral snap. No alcohol is detected.  T: Begins sweet, with concentrated roasted grain and semi-sweet Hershey's syrup. Acidity is very restrained into the middle, where a whiff of dark fruit emerges. The finish is remarkably mild for the style, slightly spirituous, with easy-going bitterness that seems as tied to the roasted barley as to earthy hops. A fine thread of dark olive brine lingers on the palate.  M: Thick viscosity, smooth and creamy on the palate, with very low carbonation.  D/O: Before imperial stouts were cool, there was North Coast's Old Rasputin. I remember the first time I tried it during Winter 2001-2002--when craft beer meant Sierra Nevada pale ale, Alaskan amber, Widmer wheat, or whatever stout I could get at the local brewpubs--and it was shocking to the senses. I may have thought that no beer should taste as this does. Now the beer endures, and it offers an honest look at how my palate has changed in a decade. Now (and especially on nitro-tap) it is a mellow and even old-fashioned take on the style, with a drinkability that is off the charts compared to its contemporaries. While some strong members of the porter-styles seem to struggle to separate roasty from smoky qualities, this is all roast and no smoke. It is chocolatey at the front-end, with a small finish that leaves room for that dessert such a beer is expected to accompany so well.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Ended up with about 2 fingers of creamy head. It fell back fairly quickly leaving a sticky lacking on the glass. The aroma was heavy with roasted malt, with hints of coffee and chocolate. Didn't catch any alcohol though from the 9% abv. Very smooth and creamy, with a nice balance of sweetness and chocolate, with bitterness from coffee and strong roasted malt flavors. Finishes cleanly with a slight lingering sweetness. While I didn't catch any in the nose, there is definitely a slightly warming alcohol present as you drink. Nothing overpowering or unpleasant though. Fairly light carbonation fits nicely with the rich full bodied beer. Overall I am impressed.

A - I had to remind myself that I wasn't changing my oil. Darkest brown/completely black that allows no light to escape, beautiful tan two-finger head, the color of espresso crema.  S - Strong notes of espresso, chocolate, toffee, and a subtler herbal character, like roasted vegetables. Weirdly enough, I smelled a slight hint of teriyaki in the background.  T - There's a burnt caramel introduction on the initial taste that turns in to the smooth coating of the roasted malts across the palette. On the backend, it tastes more like ""coffee breath"" than coffee itself combined with booze and dark fruits/roasted vegetables.  M - Just enough carbonation to carrying this thick and greasy beer down your throat. Definitely heavy-bodied and I'll be tasting this for awhile.

Well I don't know if it's me, this bottle, or some combination of the two but this particular bottle is probably the best Old Rasputin I've ever had. It's been sitting for a month which I wouldn't assume is long enough to make it so much smoother and more palatable than the rest of the four-pack, but who knows?  Looks good, smells fine but taste is where this one really shines. The best way I can describe it is Abyss Light. Licorice, molasses, a roasted quality that isn't over the top. Not too syrupy.

It poured out black as night with a perfect, solid, dark head with big bubbles that popped and hissed like something out of Dr. Frankenstein's lab. As the head deteriorates, lacing sticks to the glass like grim death.  The aroma contained chocolate, coffee, nuts, raisins, and cookies. This beer has a crazy intense and complex flavor. You get a big hit of malt that tastes like one of those rich Viennese chocolate cakes, then it gets really creamy as it moves across your palate and evolves into a nice figgy-coffee flavor that's not overly bitter. At the finish, you taste a bit of bitter chocolate again with some holiday spice. The taste of this beer lingers for several minutes after swallowing.  This beer has earned its legendary status.

112,412,StarshipPoopers,4.38,"A - Pours with about an inch of tan head. The head is frothy with large bubbles, leaves a nice lacing on the glass. Retention is decent. It dies down to a thick film after a few minutes. S - Fresh smelling. Definitely a roasted smell, mostly of dark chocolate. Hard to detect much coffee in the nose, though it is certainly there. Smells fresh, rich and slightly bitter. T - Quite a few flavours simultaneously. You get a very nice coffee flavour running in the background with a smokey touch to it. Opposite to that coffee bitterness is a sweet and rich chocolate taste that initially comes across as a sweet milk chocolate then dies down into a much darker chocolate flavour. Alcohol is well concealed with the rich range of flavours. M/D - Smooth and not overly heavy. I would say it's medium bodied. Easy drinking.  I've had a few 4-packs of Old Rasputin before and they've consistently been excellent stouts. Highly recommended.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,afinepilsner,4.38,"12oz brown bottle 9% abv  Old Rasputin was nearly black in color. It had a large brown head with good retention and sheets of lace. The smell was coffee, chocolate, and dried fruit. The taste was chocolate, roasted malt, coffee and hops. The finish was dry with a good bitterness and lingering roasted malt flavor. The mouthfeel was excellent with a full body and gentle carbonation giving it a silky and creamy texture. Overall this is an excellent Russian Imperial stout and highly recommended.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,mklooster,4.33,"Consumed from a tulip glass.  A - Pours black with a very pale tan head which dissipates rapidly to an almost white color. Very fine lacing.  S - Not as prominent as some Russian Imperial Stouts. It has a slightly earthy aroma with hints of coffee.  T - Coffee, dark chocolate, burnt toast (but in a good way). There is a lingering bitterness and subtle alcohol bite.  M - The carbonation yields a biting sensation when held on the tongue. Not velvety per se, but quite pleasant.  O - A very good beer. I plan to cellar the rest of them and return in a year's time to check on their maturity.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,chicagobill13,5,This is an awesome beer! I love Stout and I drink this beer when I am in a very good mood. Today I found it very very very cheap then the normal price I found.

This looks tasty  S- I get a strong chocolate roasted malt and alcohol smell on this one. Smells the way a good stout should.  T- Very bitter at first on the tongue then finishes with a nice subtle sweetness. Chocolate and malty flavor are prominent. The alcohol is not noticeable at all and the flavors blend very well together.  M-Thick and creamy mouth feel just the right amount of carb.  This is an awesome stout that is perfectly put together. Nothing about this stout is over the edge in flavor. Drinking a few bottles of this in one sitting is not a problem at all. Goes down smooth and tastes even smoother.,North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

T: Bitter, smooth, with a bit of a dark chocolate finish.  M: Full and oily.  O: A very nice stout that I think I chilled a bit too much for the start. The flavors came out more pronounced after being glassed for about 5 minutes. Definitely worth a try.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,mdvatab,4.73,"Poured from 12oz bottle into bourdeaux glass. No bottled-on date that I could find, but not a huge concern w/ this style...  Aroma: Fudge brownie, chocolate malt, and very prominent, herbal hops.  Appearance: Pitch black opaque espresso with a thick 2-finger pillow of tan foam stays for a while.  Flavor: Dark, dark chocolate bitterness is balanced by semi-sweet bitterness the whole time. A hint of tannic cabernet appears. Hop bitterness is prominent, but at no point is it out of control.  Mouthfeel: Bittersweetness (3/4 bitter, 1/4 sweet) coats the tongue. Very thick body with creamy carbonation.  Overall: I love this beer! It has the exact qualities I'd hope for in an imperial stout. Other brewers lend complexity to their impy stouts through flavor additions like bourbon barrel aging, coffee beans, and/or chocolate nibs. While those are delicious as well, this beer stands on its own with a masterful blend of water, barley malt, hops, and yeast.

112,412,thatsfine,4.5,"ottle from the same six-pack purchased in October and reviewed in November. Served in the same glass to keep everything the same.  A: Impenetrable black color with one finger tan head. Dissipates to a thin cap atop the beer. Lacing is still very prevalent.  S: Much more mellow than the bottle I cracked in October. The hops have died down considerably in the smell. Now the roasty, chocolate malts are front and center.  T: The hop profile has dialed down quite a bit from the fresh bottle. Now, the hop presence is in the finish and is not nearly as harsh. It adds a slightly bitter element to the finish and gives it a nice bite. The malts are much more detectable in this aged bottle.  M: Still a very thick and full bodied stout at this point. Nothing has changed.  O: In the six months since I first had this, it has really tamed and is much less boozy and hoppy. Old Rasputin was an outstanding stout six months ago and has improved mightily since then. I'm don't usually drink many stouts in the hot Arizona summer (where I'm moving back to soon) so I don't plan to have the final bottle from October 2010 until at least October 2011.

Quite hoppy, in fact. Alcohol on the back end and finally more chocolate, which remains in the aftertaste. 4  M: Thick and chewy, a bit oily. Really quite nice. 4.5  D: This drinks quite nice. I like the hop presence. The hops and alcohol are enough to make you sip and savor this brew, no matter how bad you want to keep drinking it. This has become my go-to Russian Imperial Stout.

112,412,DrewV,4.65,"Poured from a bottle out of my beer fridge at 45 degrees into a Spiegelau Stemmed Pilsner (tulip).  A: Pitch black. Thick 2-finger mocha head sits on top. Dense lacing fills the glass to the brim as the head recedes.  S: Very smooth molasses, toasted coffee, slighty boozy, although still well hidden, not much dark fruit, but you can still get a sense of it.  T: Peppery alcohol bite kicks in up front, then fades rapidly, transitioning into a deep coffee flavor, then finally decays into a bittersweet chocolate mocha finish. Definitely complex and long-lasting. Highest marks here.  M: Medium-high carbonation with plenty of very fine bubbles, which hides the ABV well.  O: Once the initial kick of the spiciness fades, the flavors mellow and reveal themselves in sequence. A fantastic brew that truly deserves its classic status. An unbelievable bargain, to boot, makes this a no-brainer as a stout staple in everyone's beer fridge.

Coffee, nutty, alchohol, big IBU, it's all there. It's like turning a guitar amp to 11.  My only gripe is that the alcohol taste is just a little bit on the dominant side, but that's a subjective thing (I'd like to taste maybe 10% more malt). But I appreciate that it is a big beer @ 9% ABV.

T: Lots and lots of roasted malts here with notes of dark, bitter chocolate and coffee. The hops provide some extra bitterness towards the finish and there is a decent alcohol burn. The bitterness lingers around after the finish.  M: Thick body with medium carbonation that accentuates the bitter notes of this beer.

T: Some bitter dark choclate, sweet roasted malt and mollasses, and mild charred coffee.  M: medium mouth, well carbonated due to the nitro pour, creamy, and smooth.  O: Great quick pint this day. The beer is a bit different out of the bottle, Co2 draft, and nitro.

As it recedes, it leaves unpredictable thick-spiderweb lacing. It remains at about one-finger.  Smell: It smells like cologne...haha, what kind I couldn't tell ya. Some mellow espresso bean flavor is the focus here, with a touch of dark chocolate hidden within a mostly milk-chocolate zone. Crisp alcohol and gentle prune hide underneath all of the above.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Beer is slightly syrupy upon entry, and brings a gentle (almost citric?) sourness. As the carbonation works its magic, the chocolate and espresso make appearances, but everything is overshadowed by a biting alcoholic presence and lack of ""stout-ness.""

In my opinion it is heavy on the roasted barley and needs a little balance.The aroma and flavor are roasted barley, with hop bitterness, both of which are a little harsh.

A: Slight brown hues, almost pitch black. Beautiful dark tan head that completely laces the glass. Quite a lot of carbonation is visible; a fair amount of bubbles stick to the side of the glass.  S: Carmel and chocolate at first, biscuity undertones follow. Nice and welcoming. The 9% ABV is completely hidden.  T: The first thing to come out is a smooth, warming, alcoholic spiciness. Sweet malts and coffee are very, very miniscule, but still there. Then, surprisingly, hops finish it off. A nice bitter finish. There are some other sweet flavors that become more apparent with each sip – chocolate and a hint of dark fruits (underlying yeast, I’m sure). Still, the prominent flavors are definitely spicy alcohol blending into bitterness. It’s a transition that goes a little too quickly for my taste. It makes this obviously well-crafted stout seem less complex than it actually is. You can tell there are many different elements in each taste, but you really have to work to seek them out from under the blanket of the biggest flavors.  M: The carbonation is one of the first things you notice in this brew. It adds a sensation that works to bring out the big spiciness of the alcohol. This may be another reason why the hops and alcohol are so prominent; the carbonation definitely beefs up these aspects.  O: This is a big beer. Its biggest elements, however, can substantially diminish its complexity. Still, a very nice RIS.

There is a dark tan head with moderate retention.  S: Incredibly complex and balanced. The first thing I could smell was coffee, followed closely by chocolate and caramel. There is also an herbal smell, sort of like grass cuttings or pine. On top of all this, the beer smells distinctly fruity, like cherry and citrus.  T: The taste is less balanced than the smell; a smoky mocha is the dominant flavor. The malts also contribute their characteristic sweetness. The fruit flavors are still here, but faint compared to their smells. More hops in this than most Russian imperial stouts which do a little bit to balance the mocha.

Dark aromas of coffee and chocolate power through strong. Grainy breads and a bit of spice present themselves and add complexity. Alcohol comes through, but is not overpowering.

Heavy flavors may make this feel thicker than it is, but the bitterness seems to hang on the tongue a little too long.  D: Great flavors combine well for an excellent tasting brew.

112,412,jhughes23,4.68,"12oz. Bottle Poured into a 16oz. Tulip Glass  Pours a Dark Black, almost motor oil black but not quite. Starts with a nice thick mocha colored head that dissipates down to a decent thin layer on top. Laces nicely throughout.  The Aroma is definitely of dark chocolates and roasted malts and coffee. The Roasted Malts seems most prominent with a hint of vanilla.  The Flavor is very dry and bitter upfront mellowing out with a roasted chocolate and vanilla. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy, but there are RIS out there that have a smoother mouthfeel. The alcohol is prominent but not as much as you would expect. Over time this will calm down and the mouthfeel will improve.  Definitely a sipper that has many more layers as it warms up.  By far in my top 5 RIS. But it has to be #1 if you factor in the Price.  I would be hard pressed to find a better best buy than this one.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,OddNotion,4.89,"Poured into my DFH Signature Glass. Oh boy I have been waiting to review this for a long time now!This particular bottle is roughly a year old.  Appearance: Pours a black body reminiscent of coffee where it is a dark dark brown around the edges. No head to speak of but there is a nice lacing around the circumference of the glass.  Smell: This is one of my favorite stout smells. It is sweet and inviting. Lots of dark malt, a little roasty, and very chocolatey.  Taste: One of the few imperial stouts that I love even at fridge temperature! Slight hints of coffee are just trumped by the chocolate flavor. A good amount of malt sweetness and no bitterness to speak of. Old Rasputin has a very distinct taste in comparison to other stouts I have had. 9% alcohol is completely hidden.  Mouthfeel. Carbonation is just slightly higher than I like in my stouts and it could use a little more viscosity. However I am very picky on the mouthfeel with my stouts and this one is not far off. Decent level of creaminess.  Overall: Year round Russian Imperial Stout at about $10 a 4 pack after tax. I will gladly get this any time. I wish I bought it more but always get caught in the seasonal stout assault and lose a lot of my desire for stouts come spring and summer. This is my go to stout in the summer when the craving does hit. Available everywhere I go.

Appearance - Pours black with a 2 finger brown head that leaves a nice lacing on the glass.  Smell - Smells of dark chocolate, coffee, and roasted smokey malts.  Taste - Tastes of roast coffee and bittersweet chocolate. Has a very nice hoppy finish. The high alcohol content(9.8% ABV) is masked very well within the taste of the beer.  Mouthfeel - Lighter bodied than expected while still having a creamy mouthfeel. Light carbonation.  Drinkability - Drinkable because of the lighter feel and and good flavor but prob could only drink a few because of the alcohol content.  My first RIS and I loved it would def recommend!

No light is able to be seen through this baby. No alochol legs apparent.  Aroma: Reeks of chocolate, hints of coffee with that thick molasses and dark fruits. Slight hops also play throughout. That nice rich, familiar RIS smell. Reminds me of a Stone IRS.  Taste: Hop biterness roles in the front of the tongue followed by dark chocolate/coffee. The flavors meld together well but it almost seems like the hop over power the rich flavors in the background.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, with medium carbonation. The biterness plays down the throat but is smoothed over the dark flavors of slight fruit, chocolate and coffee.

Sweet chocolate is the dominant flavor here. Even has some hop to it, just the right amount. Some alcohol, but not much. Going to let it warm up and see how it blossoms.  M - Nice and thick, spot on for the style. Stays pretty wet throughout. Creamy and almost chewy.  O - Overall a very delicious beer. Incredible for something so widely available and relatively inexpensive. The value and availability make this the go-to ""everyday"" beer in the RIS style, but it's not diminished in any way.

Rather light aroma for an RIS but components are all there, predominant chocolate and coffee but paired with cherries, dark fruits, molasses and even pecans. Rather boozy and syrupy as well.  Sweet but not cloying, chocolate predominant, in fact very little coffee to speak of in the initial taste. This is coupled with some caramel, cherry and nuttiness. The after taste comes in late but rather strong, not of hop bitterness but coffee and charred almonds. Unlike the nose, alcohol is well hidden.  Medium heavy mouthfeel, velvety smooth almost creamy and lacking in carbonation.  A slow sipper meant to be savored and a great value to boot, under $8 for four of these bottles.

Nose is rich and sweet with notes of coffee, cocoa, a little caramel, and some alcohol. Thick like chocolate milk on the palate with excellent carbonation. Not much hop character. The malt isn't overbearing, allowing dark chocolate flavors to play on the palate and become more pronounced in the finish. Very easy to drink for 9% abv. The mouthfeel and palate are very well rounded so you don't feel super weighed down. Still, its obvious why they only sell it in 4-packs. Its a big brew meant for moderation and special occasions.

Upon first pouring it into the glass it pours a nice rich opaque brown/black, with a nice head that slowly recedes and some moderate lacing.  The nose is a mixture of roasted malt, chocolate, raisin, and some hoppy bitterness.  The taste is roasted malts quickly followed by a hoppy bitter finish. This brew is lighter then the color and pour would lead on and had much more carbonation then I anticipate in a Russian Imperial Stout, but that did not stop this brew from delighting the taste buds.

I can taste the richness through the smell.  T- Full blast of roasted malt and chocolate with a bitter hop finish. The chocolate and toffee sweetness is followed by a floral hop finish. Amazing balance. Not too one sided or overpowering.  M- Creamy, smooth and perfectly balanced. Reminiscent of a piece of velvet chocolate cake. Leaves a rich, thick coat on the palate. Carbonation is in tune with the style.  D- Because of how smooth it is for an RIS, this one can easily be enjoyed one delicious sip at a time. Exquisite creaminess.

Black as night, unrelenting chocolate milk head that won't dare leave, thick lacing, milky, thick, and creamy appearance. Luscious and decadent.  The two main aromas are chocolate and roasted malt. The chocolate is rich and sweet while the roasted malts almost smell meaty, akin to a barbeque. There's a bit of smoke and some coffee in the nose as well, but it's mainly chocolate and roasted malt.  The taste is a bit more complex than the nose.

S: The first thing that strikes me with this beer is the hops. There are a LOT of hops in this. Very strong citrus notes right off the bat with notes of lime, grapefruit and a little bit of pineapple. But there are also a lot of ""normal"" imperial stout in the smell too: roasted barley, coffee, dark chocolate, licorice and molasses. With all the hops, it's nice to see it's still quite sweet. Great smelling beer. Strength is medium.  T: The hops are much less strong in the taste than in the smell. There is still traces of very dry (as in not sweet) lime juice and grapefruit, not much pineapple. What you're left with is a massive attack of powder cocoa. Coffee is also a huge player in this beer. Molasses and licorice are quite strong too. Light vanilla and maybe maple syrup. Still, a very dry imperial stout that makes me think of a better Simple Malt Imperial Stout.  M: I like my imperial stouts bigger but this, with all the dryness, is not as bad as it may seem. The medium body with medium to strong carbonation actually fits ok with the beer.  O: This is a very enjoyable Imperial Stout. I have the feeling this beer ages very well and maybe helps out the sugar to come out a little bit more. But still, this beer has a lot of character and isn't your typical Imperial Stout. Drinkability is really good also.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,zeledonia,4.18,"Pours a deep, dark chocolate brown, almost black. Shows some reddish-brown edges when held to a light. The medium-tan head is so buoyant and fluffy it nearly overflowed my glass, and I had to wait several minutes for it to subside. Even then it left a layer of foam with a collar of lace.  Smell is surprisingly fruity for a stout; blackberries, backed up by some chocolate. Really nice combination of malt and hop aromatics, though it is a bit weak on the nose. I like a little more punch from a RIS than this one offers, but what's there is quite good.  Taste is hoppier than I expected, but not overly so. Dark fruits, chocolate, and some slightly smoky dark malts.  Mouthfeel is great - medium-thick, but smooth and light in the mouth thanks to the carbonation, which gives it a nice small-bubble creaminess.  This is a darn good imperial stout. It's fruity and hoppy, but still well-balanced, and the thick but light mouthfeel is really nice. The alcohol is completely invisible. Likely to become a staple.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,KYBrewgrass,3.93,"A- 4.5 True to the style, this stout is a super-dark brown, nearly black color. It has a decently sized dark tan head on the pour that dissipates but leaves a nice bubbly ring around the edges of the glass. It is distinctly more bubbly than creamy. There is fine, sticky lacing left on the snifter's edges throughout.  S- 4 Chocolate, coffee and roasted malts come to mind, followed by a hint of booze and wood. It is intriguing because I can't get enough of it; not the strongest scent in the world. It does improve as it warms, however.  T- 4 More powerful than the aroma, this brew's taste is sweet and rich. Again, I get chocolate and dark malt but not really any coffee. There is a fair amount of heat that unfortunately becomes a little overbearing after awhile. It leaves a dry finish.  M- 4 Old Rasputin is a damn near full-bodied beer that is fairly heavy. It isn't the smoothest to take down because of its heat. The carbonation is fine.  D- 3.5 Truthfully, I don't think I could do more than one of these bad boys. It is a bear of a beer. It means business. I think its flavors are intense and it is clearly powerful at 9% ABV.

112,412,Auracom,3.62,"12 oz. bottle into my trusty C&B tulip on April 3rd, 2011.  Pours a very dark brown coloring, nearly black but not quite, with a finger-and-a-half light brown head. Decent retention for the ABV, slowly breaks down to a thin white coating with concentrated alcohol feet on the sides. Great lacing on this badboy. Doesn't look oily or quite as thick as many other imperial stouts I've tasted.  The aroma is predominantly coffee, roasted almonds, milk chocolate (moreso than dark chocolate), slight lactose, *minimal* citrus, and a little bit of alcohol. Not getting a whole lot of complexity with additional nuances such as spices.  The drink has more roasted notes than the aroma and more emphasis on the dark chocolate character with a lot of bitter bite at the backend. The dk. chocolate carries through to the aftertaste and is really nice. Less coffee notes. Some hops but I'm attributing more of the bitterness to the chocolate. ABV is slightly present but rather-well hidden. I can tell it's under 10%.  Mouthfeel is pretty textbook - medium/med. heavy body, smooth, appropriate carbonation. Neither truly thick nor chewy.  For an RIS, it drinks relatively easiy. The slightly lower ABV hides well and it's not really overbearing on the palate. Is it enjoyable? Yes. Is it safe? Yes. Is it too safe? Perhaps. Next to Founder's IS, this is the most standard-smelling and tasting imperial stout that I've tried, but it doesn't really shine in any particular category. FIS offers considerably more in complexity and flavor. The best quality for Raspy is in the smell; I'm really enjoying that milk chocolate aroma. It's a very nice entry into the style and I ought to have tried it earlier. Bonus points for absolute ease in finding this all over the place.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Overall, a somewhat smoky flavor. Coffee and espresso w/ the roasted malt and just a hint of dark chocolate. Not too much, but enough to balance the coffee tones. Definitely more chocolate on the aftertaste, which I like and was a bit unexpected. The taste, as it should be is where this beer shines.  M - medium/full bodied, silky with actually a bit more carbonation than I expected. It felt a little fizzier than I had anticipated but wasn't bad at all. I might have preferred it to be a bit smoother, but that's kind of nitpicky. Again, the flavor is what dominates.  D - at a high ABV and full bodied mouthfeel, with a challenging (but very good!) flavor, I wouldn't want to drink more than one or MAYBE two on the coldest of winter nights, but this is a very enjoyable beer and one I've been wanting to try for a long time.

Dark beige colored large head. Dissipated very slowly. Lacing was near perfection. A dark deep black stout with only a slight notice of brown hues on the edge. Looks very nice.  smell - Alcohol, yeast, roasted malt. In that order. Overall the aroma is not that apparent and I had to take many deep sniffs. And couldn't make out that much going on with it.  taste - Alcohol is upfront. I can hardly taste the malt, alcohol does not subside, all the way to the finish. It does seem to mask the complexity that this beer possibly has. That leaves me sort of questioning the flavors.  mouthfeel - Low carbonation and quite smooth. the low c02 works well for this stout. Not too thin, a little chewy.  overall - I am not sure if it is this batch but it does not have that much flavor. It does seem like mine were pretty damn potent and above 9% ABV.

Some tartness maybe of a dried cherry? A bit of a nutty taste way at the end.  The mouth is a bit weak as far as the ""chew"" factor. It is well carbonated for the style. A bit dry at the end. The nuttyness is there too.  Overall I really enjoyed this one (and the hundred or so I've had before).

T: More malt flavor with coffee and bittersweet chocolate. Seems to be a subtle bitterness and a dry finish.  F: Full body that is thick and creamy. No hint of alcohol. Very well balanced.

112,412,ExtraStout,4.08,Holy smokes this is a nice stout! Poured brownish-black in color with a small dark tan head. A mellow alcohol and fruity notes make a soft aroma. This is one full-bodied stout starting with roasted coffee and creamy malt flavors. Very smooth overall and the alcohol isn't as apparent in the taste as in the aroma. At 9% this is very drinkable on this cold rainy afternoon. If not for a lingering bitter aftertaste I would have rated it higher.,North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

S- Roasted malts and toasted nuts... chocolate, coffee and alcohol and marshmallows.  T- Tons of rich roasted malt... just on the verge of burnt. Dark semi-sweet chocolate, day old Iced Coffee with faint hints of vanilla, espresso beans, and smores.  M- Not thin, but not totally sticky on the tongue. Nice balance and drinkability. Nice bitter coffee on the finish.  O- A fantastic IRS...

Decent lacing down the sides.  S: Lots of roasted malt, a little bit of coffee, and some nice cocoa. It is an extremely strong aroma overall, but no hint of alcohol.  T: More coffee comes through on the flavor than on the aroma, and while I typically am not a fan of beers with a lot of coffee flavor, this one I like. Probably because there is a sizable chocolate/cocoa component as well. There is some molasses as well and a little bit of dark fruits, mostly raisins that I can pick out.  M: Has a thick and creamy mouthfeel, really didn't get any indication of alcohol, no heat really at all.  O: A really great beer, a go to in the style for sure, especially at the price.

S= a good strong hyperventilating noze-ful of toasted nuttiness, roasted dark malts, various floral hops and hints of liquor. Not nearly the liquor nose that I would expect with its 9%ABV. Mostly like hardwood burning in a winter lodge fireplace.  T= burnt malts, burnt roasty nuttiness, some nice hops florals, definite burnt and more burnt whatever, dry coffee or chocolate but more like burnt nuttiness than either coffee or chocolate. Definitely Imperial boldness.  M= dry, plentiful burnt notes varying with the gulp to savor. Have you ever eaten totally burnt triple-roasted peanuts? It's something like that but without the peanut taste.  O= not cheap stuff at like US$5.99 a bottle.

112,412,BerkeleyBeerMan,4.2,Appearance: Dark brown to black with a nice creamy 1/4 inch brown head lots of bubbles and good lacing all over the glass. I can't see anything through this glass.  Smell: Somewhat smoky. The strong alcohol smell is masked by a tasty nuttiness which blends with a very potent dark chocolate. The hops are bright and bitter.  Taste: It starts slightly sweet. If you hold it in the mouth there is a very sweet citric hop profile. I really appreciate the balance in this beer. It finishes with chalky mix of apricot and dark chocolate. The beer has a very strong consistency which doesn't diminish upon tasting.  Mouthfeel: Medium. Full-bodied. Develops good character in the mouth. Nice finish  Overall: This is one of the best high ABV beer's I have ever had. It shines both in malt and hop characteristics. This is the best desert beer i've ever had that doubles as a party beer.

112,412,djeucalyptus,4.14,"I've got to say, nitro-tap really changes this beast.  This is probably the most intense, thick, beautiful looking Nitro pour I've ever had the pleasure of gazing at. Dark blackness with effervescence of the gods fueling a truly never-ending frosting-like cap. The curtains of lacing are epic.  Aroma, as some nitro tends toward, leaves a bit to be desired. vanilla, rich malt, cocoa nibs. mild, creamy, not bad.  Taste is surprising... heavily roasty, charred coffee, and an impressive hop presence. Nitro really adds a stunning depth to this luscious brew. possibly it's fresher - thus a bit hoppier - than I'm used to, but this has a stunning hop presence that really transforms this from what I'm used to into something ephemeral. I'm missing the leather, smoke, peat and rich chocolate, but it's been pleasantly replaced with piney, resinous and bright hops. Digging it.  Mouth is solid, with ample carbonation from the nitro, yet it retains some of that old rasputininess. thick, a bit viscous, and touch of syrup, and some lingering bitterness. Lovely.  All in all, nitro has done some interesting things to one of my old standbys. The hops are definitely accentuated, turning this into a surprisingly rounded and balanced RIS. Which I like... although i almost miss the heavy coffee, chocolate, and rich malt that i'm used to.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Kaplow. Right in my lips. Fig along with licorice and booze. This style can suffer from the zero carbonation syrup effect. Not a problem for this fella. Raspy is a hoppy gentleman but not overly.

There's a ton of alcohol warmth without tasting boozy at all, and a lot of hop bitterness in the aftertaste.  This beer doesn't feel nearly as thick as it looks.

This very deep dark brown to nearly black liquid (like old motor oil) turns jet black in the glass with a modest one finger thick tan head. The creamy head hangs on very well and leaves lots of spotty lace patterns on the glass.  Smell: The aroma is full of sweet and roasty malt character with rich dark chocolate notes, heavily toasted/burnt malt and a nice suggestion of warm alcohol.  Taste/Palate: Its flavor is every bit as deep and roasted as the aroma. The full body offers rich chocolaty, burnt coffee and heavy toasted notes wrap up in a blanket of mellow alcohol warmth. It is also balanced by some nice herbal hop bitterness that plays off some malt bitterness. The palate is heavy and chewy with soft mild carbonation.

This one finished things off right on St. Paddy's day at the local.  Midnight black with the beautiful nitro head and lame nitro nose. It still delivers a punch of char, coffee, burnt sugar, and earthy hop flavor, but it's smoothed out (or dumbed down depending on your perspective) by the nitrogen pour. Nice and bitter with some needed astringency from the roasted grains and a hint of ethanol warmth on the finish.

A: An opaque black body with just the slightest tint of brown is beautiful. Above it is 3 fingers of dark khaki head that dissipates a bit quickly but leaves a nice lacing on the side. Kind of two-tone.  S: A great combination of roasted malts, sweet chocolates and caramels and bitter dark chocolates and a bit of hops. It ups the roasted and bitter aspects over the sweet, and is better off for it, giving the beer a hazy-inducing comforting effect. To describe it further would make too factual a more emotional response.  T: Same flavor profile as the aroma, and it once again highlights the bitter and roasted characteristics, but there is a great and surprising kick of sweetness right in the middle of a drink. It's like liquid chocolate for one fraction of a second. It's a unique trademark for the beer.  M: A great lightly carbonated and thick body are just great for this stout.

A fairly bitter aftertaste is left in the mouth but it is pleasant and warming, not annoying. While the taste rivals any other stout I've ever had as the best, the mouthfeel of Old Rasputin is so smooth and creamy that it literally feels like I'm drinking silk. It makes the beer in the end, because the taste, smell and appearance of this beer are all great, but the mouthfeel makes the beer special.

Tastes like black coffee, some caramel, notes of honey, prunes, and a big punch of aftertaste bitterness probably from Columbus hops.  M - Perfectly balanced carbonation for a full body beer like this. It feels like you're swallowing a healing potion... that's how good it is.  Overall this is one of my favorite beers.

Sweet fruits remind me of how much I love Ales over Lagers (this is not a fruit beer!). Meaty and savory; full flavored.  Head first in the fire pit with the first sip from the glass. Abundantly burnt, but in a good way. Slick hops help balance the dryness of this brew. Lingering qualities. Certainly a sipper, but I can't help but throw it down. Pitch blackness infiltrates the tan head as it rides up the rim of the glass. Alcohol shows itself like a toned down liquor (9% ABV).

Smell - The aroma revealed some roasted maltiness along the lines of coffee and chocolate. Some dark fruit is there, but seems to be sitting in the background. The smell is very rich and slightly sweet. Picking up some burnt tones that could be grain or barley. Nice and robust.  Taste - In the taste I found more of the dark fruit tones than I did in the aroma. I detect some burnt grain flavors and the coffee and chocolate file in line nicely. A small touch of alcohol flavoring, but none too much. It fits in very nicely. Very well balanced. Minute bitterness.  Mouthfeel - Medium/full mouthfeel. Dry and chewy even. The alcohol was like an enjoyable smooth burn. Leaves plenty hanging around on the palate. Very nice carbonation.  Drinkability - Man!!! This is really a great brew.

A: Clear nearly black brew gives a slight mahogany-red glow around the edges in dim bar lighting, so I presume it isn't completely opaque. Lovely dense tan head, super thick and creamy. Looks like it came from a nitro tap (but I forgot to ask if this was true). Super thick carpet of smooth dense lace covers the sides of the glass.  S: Good dose of dark, astringent, roasted barley and bitter cocoa powder. Mostly dry. Slight dry grass/ hay hop.  T: Same as the smell, plus a bit of light thin sweetness of candied fruit, tart raspberries and currents. A bit of dry smoke and a modest earth/herb hop both add some bite and depth but aren't major players. Long finish has lingering soft dark cocoa and smoke, and some residual sweet slickness, like the aftertaste from chocolate-raspberry liquor (if there is such a thing).  M: Mostly dry, smooth and creamy, moderate thickness, but balanced by a bit of light bitter fruity sweetness. Fairly lightbodied for a RIS. Soft mellow carbonation.  D: Hugely drinkable, not filling or overly sweet. Highly recommended.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,wstuart,4.17,"black as the devils backside, this russian imperial stout is freaking delicious. light hazelnut top with a distinct chocolate flavor accompanied by a rich coffee aroma. interesting how both the coffee and chocolate are in balance with eachother, while maintaining their boundries. delicious",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,ngeunit1,4.42,"A - Pours a deep dark brown black color with a finger-plus tan-brown head. The head slowly reduces to a ring around the glass with some nice lacing left behind on the glass.  S - Aroma is full of rich roasted caramel malts and some strong coffee aroma. Almost espresso. Touch of smoky elements with a little bit of chocolate also mixed in.  T - Lots of sweet roasted and rich caramel malts and coffee flavors. Also some nice smoky flavor and a touch of chocolate. Through the middle more off the sweet caramel malts come through with some nice oak and roasted flavors alongside. The finish is full of roasted malts and coffee flavor with a touch of bitterness which linger nicely.  M - Medium bodied with moderate-plus carbonation. Feels fairly thick and creamy. Maybe just a hair more carbonated than expected.  D - Very drinkable.

112,412,rudzud,4.51,"Finally, finally landed a bottle of this at KJ Baarons. Not sure how or why it took me this long, but review #199, lets do it!  A - Poured into my Duvel tulip. Holy cow! A huge three finger dark brown head that faded incredibly slowly resulting in a nice thick blanket. All this atop a dark black pour with a little bit of deep brown at the edges.  S - Really nice roasty malts. Big time roasted, lightly smokey carmel malts with just a hint of vanilla. There are some nice bittersweet chocolate and some good bitter hop qualities along with a strong espresso aroma.The alcohol is present on the nose though.  T - Very much like the nose. This stuff is so good. Lots of that roasty malts with a lil vanilla quality. Lots of coffee flavours (including the bitterness) along with some chocolate. Quite bitter aftertaste.  M - Quite creamy and smooth even though there is some good carbonation here. Rather surprising.  D - Wow, this is a stellar stout. Everything works so well with another. The ABV is hidden big time thanks to the coffee qualities of this stout. Very tasty.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,RTJakarta,4.46,"From a bottle.  Black as night with a light tan head, leaving behind some lovely lacing. Beautiful.  A nice coffee/chocolate smell. Not too overpowering, but definitely evident. Very nice.  Taste is fantastic. Like most people say, malt, chocolate, and coffee. A nice bit of warmth to go with the 9% ABV. Wouldn't guess a 9% ABV though.  A bit more carbonation than I would think in the mouth, but it's still really rich and thick in the mouth.  For me, I don't drink stouts too often. Usually like to have a nice meaty meal, which is something I don't have too often. But when I wanna have a stout, especially a RIS, this is an absolute go-to beer. Fantastic. Could drink this often.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,BeerdedEric,4.37,"Nice head retention. Dark color body with ruby highlights. The head looks creamy and delicious.  Some chocalate and coffee with a hint of cherry coming in the aroma. Nice smell as it warms with a smokiness that my brother pointed out.  The taste is delicious. Vanilla, hazelnut, caramel, coffee and chocalate mixing very well. I taste a little bit of alcohol nothing over the top.  Feels great in the mouth. Medium body. Goes down nice.  I could have another. Seems to get a little heavy but nonetheless a very tasty beer.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,LazyL,3.9,"When in California..why not drink from the tap of goodness as much as possible. Black with a nice mocha creamy foam. The nose is all stout, coffee, cola, molasses. The taste is not quite up to the nose but has a nice roasty malt and espresso flavour. There is a slightly sour note and its creamy, dry and has a smokey charred finish. This is a decent stout but there is no way that this is 9%. The ABV is very well hidden.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

S: Rich roasted malts in the nose with some espresso character. T: This beer tastes like roasted malt, espresso, chocolate heaven. Bitter espresso and dark chocolate starts the sip with some sweet roasted malts sneaking in in the middle. There is a slight alcohol finish. M: This is a thick, well carbonated beer.

Aroma-Roasted aromas of coffee and bittersweet chocolate blend with pleasant earthy hop undertones.  Flavor-Bittersweet chocolate is quickly overtaken by rich, roasted coffee flavors. Coffee grounds and burnt espresso lingers on well into the finish.  Mouthfeel-Thick, full body is nearly chewy, though the moderate carbonation keeps this beer from seeming heavy.  I think this might have been the first RIS I ever had, and I've drank a lot of it since then. This is a lovely example of the style, and a fantastic beer.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,HOPPYKC,3.96,Poured into a pint glass. No bottled on or bb date available on bottle.  A- Pours dark and fully opaque. A nice small amount of tan to light brown head.

112,412,output01x,3.91,"Received in a pint glass on tap at the Brew Kettle.  A tan colored two-finger head of miniscule bubbles sits atop a pitch-black body. The head retention is fantastic as it never completely fades no matter how empty the glass becomes. The lacing coats the glass almost entirely. Truly a fantastic and somewhat intimidating looking beer.  Scents of roasted malt, dark bitter chocolate and a little coffee are there, although not as strong as they could have been.  The flavors follow the nose in all respects. Malt, chocolate, and coffee are there but I would have liked them to be bolder. The 9% ABV is well masked and is only apparent as a slight warmth. A slight bitterness also persists at the end of each sip.  The mouthfeel is thick and creamy but not sticky. Not alot, but just enough carbonation help move it along. The beer coats your mouth and makes you remember each sip until you take another.  While I would have liked this beer to have bolder flavors, it is still quite refreshing for the style and has excellent drinkability. I could definitely have multiples in one sitting, which is quite impressive for a stout.  All in all, an excellent RIS with great drinkability. My only complaint is the mildness of the flavor. It was almost like drinking a 1% chocolate milk. I have heard claims that this beer ages well and I am definitely interested in seeing how this would affect it.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,nhindian,4.36,"12oz bottle poured into a snifter. This specific bottle provided by 603BeerMe, thanks Clark!  A - Pours into the glass and as it fills it extinguishes all light through it, and despite my trying, I can't seem to find any highlights here. Even the head of this beer is magical as a relatively normal pour unleashes a 3-fingered, tan head, comprised of tightly condensed bubbles giving it a nice, creamy look. Retention is great as well as it lasts for several minutes and when it finally settles it still leaves about a half-finger ring around the edge. Additionally, this beer leaves sheer curtains of lace, covering almost the entire circumference. I haven't seen such great lacing since Pretty Thing's Babayaga, which was extremely impressive. This is just a fantastic looking beer.  S - The nose is full of roasted malts, bittersweet baker's chocolate, and a bitterness that could be attributed to either the chocolate or some slight hops. It's a bit acrid, almost similar to smelling a pot of coffee that is a few hours old. Some alcohol also comes into play near the back.  T - The taste really lives up to the smell. A lot of coffee comes into play at first before getting tamed by the malts. Tons of dark chocolate follow and I'm getting a nice roast as well. I am also getting some hops, but not to the extent of something like Great Divide's Yeti or Victory's Storm King, just a slight hop bitterness to complement the bitterness in the chocolate and alcohol, which again makes an appearance at the end. The finish is long and bitter with a lot of chocolate still lingering. This beer is extremely solid; it's not going to blow your mind with delicate, exotic intricacies, but if you want a tasty beer that does the style justice at an excellent price point, look no further.  M - Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Actually a bit lighter and less chewy than I would've expected, but it still does feel great in the mouth and it leaves a coating and long finish to remember it by.  D - Drinkability is high. For anyone looking to get into Russian Imperial Stouts, I wouldn't recommend anything else besides this. It scores high for me on all facets, and for the price point it can't be beat. This will be a regular staple for me when looking for a solid representation in the style.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,cyraxx,3.86,"Pitch black with a light brown creamy head that is very inviting. I have to be a little lenient on the aroma because some is lost when a beer is served via nitrogen. All I can discern is roasted malts with a slight licorice edge. The flavor is somewhat muted with burnt malt, chocolate, and a slight metallic flavor. The nitrogen thins out what would normally be a substantial body. I usually feel that what is lost in putting a beer on nitro is made up for with the creaminess that is imparted. In the case of Old Rasputin, I really would stick to drinking it with normal CO2. While tasty, not as good as the original.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,getinmebelly,4.03,"This stout is definitely on the complex side. A subtle but noticeably floral hop character is one of the sneakier characteristics that contribute to the stout's unique qualities. The mouthfeel is substantial, due to residual sugars that also leave some sexy, sticky lace.  I like the intense dried fruit aroma that blends well with hints of cocoa and fruitier Ethiopian coffee beans. Somewhere along the line, there is a kind of smokiness in the back of the throat deal, and while it is pleasant, I found there was a strange, faint chalkiness or musty property in the mouth. Not texturally, but from a flavor perspective.  On the whole, this beer is a warming, strong ale that I am happy to say protects me from the Ithaca cold!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,bamadog,4.1,"Went to Friday Night Flights at Party Town in Florence, KY and met one of the brewmasters from North Coast -- super cool guy. They had several NC offerings offered at the growler station, couldn't really pass this one up (plus they were giving away free NC pint glass -- friggin' sweet!). Review is from notes taken on 2/25/2011 and poured from the growler to a snifter.  Appearance: Pour is darkest brown/near black and it starts with a thin 1/2 finger dark tan head that fades quickly to nothing other than an incomplete skim floating on the surface; body is, of course, entirely opaque and seems to engulf the light around it; big swaths and spots of lacing are left on the sides of the glass.  Smell: Definitely a California beer -- lots of hops abound from this RIS and it's definitely hoppier than I remember from the bottle (I'd like to add that on the second night from the growler, the hops seemed more subdued and the roasty malts really came out more) followed by the burnt roasty and bittersweet bakers-like chocolate with a bit of a cocoa powder scent to it as well; interestingly enough there is also a bit of a metallic and earthy presence.  Taste: I'm going to say it... I think I prefer this one from the bottle. It's still good overall, but just a personal preference. The first night, the bitter metallic earthiness is really up front and the roastiness is thin with a bit of a faint bittersweet chocolate aspect to it. Fortunately, it seems to have settled down a bit over night (not sure what accounted for the change, perhaps my palate was just cleaner the second night?) and while the hops were still present and providing a nice grassy bitterness, the malts showed up and provided a robust earthy nuttiness with some burnt coffee/espresso roast and bittersweet chocolate and a bit of dry cocoa powder.  Mouthfeel: Body is of medium weight and fairly smooth and creamy; the strong metallic bite the first kind of distracts me and takes away from this, but the second night is very enjoyable as I remember it being; a thick sticky coating is left all over the mouth and a bit of a grittiness is left on the teeth; belly is just a little warm from the 9% ABV.  Drinkability: Definitely good, but like most RISs, the weight and ABV pull it down a bit. Definitely a great beer for a cold night and ultimately, it's kind of one of the defining beers of the style.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,CanonJohn,4.73,"Poured into a tulip.  A: Wow. Black as night with a thin, dark caramel, half finger head that dissipated quickly leaving almost no lace to speak of. I tried to shine a 9 led super bright flash light through it and saw nothing. How awesome is that?  S: The smell is of roasted coffee, dark fruits, and dark bitter chocolate, with a punch of alcohol. In a word, fantastic!  T: Explosive roasted coffee, and dark fruits on the start, leading almost immediately into dark bitter chocolate. Followed by a nice hoppy bitterness and warm alcohol. The alcohol is accompanied by the taste of burbon and then coffe on the finish. I was then left with a lingering bitter chocolate and coffe after that is just wonderful. There are hints of spicy flavors throughout. I picked up some clove, star anise, and an almost hot black peper somewhere in the middle, that lingered just under the coffe after. There really is far too much here for a novice like me.  M: Nice and heavy. Coats the mouth well, and gives a lovely warming sensation.  D: Highly drinkable, in small quantities. This may be the best beer I have yet to put in my mouth, but I will struggle to finish 12oz. It is no session beer; at 9% ABV, but it is a very very special drink. I just really love this beer!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,radioscooter,3.89,"Blacker than the blackest night in the glass. A semi-soft pour garners an astounding 4 finger head that isn't going anywhere 3 minutes later. You could float a toy boat on top.  Aroma is less present, I smell the coffee and the Earth, and a few bitter hops. A little musty actually. Not much else. And not strongly even when snuffling big.  Taste is subdued, like the aroma. Good, not my favorite taste but very good. Coffee for sure, some dark roasty chocolate, there's a malt squeezing in there somewhere but very subtly blended. No overthrows of flavor on either end, which I assume is a good thing. Me, I'm looking for sweeter, but with this RIPA - I understand.  Booze is well hidden, but creeps up on you.  The mouthfeel is great, but dry and leaves a bit of a secondary hops taste as it departs. Good for some, not for me. Still - I understand.  Very respectable. It would get higher marks form me but the mustiness is a little off-putting.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,teromous,3.71,"A: Pitch black like looking through a piece of coal. It is accompanied with a creamy tan head that goes away pretty fast.  S: It smells very toasty with a slight musty scent and a little earthy. There's something in the smell that puts me off. I wasn't completely sold on the scent. I could pick up hops but the aromatics were much to bland.  T: Very very robust toasted flavor with a very distinct hop flavor. The hop flavor can really punch through the bold roasted flavor. I keep taking a sip to get that surprise hop-pop. What I like is that the hop flavor really finds its place and stays in it. It's not too subtle or overpowering.  M: I get a ""sticky"" malty aftertaste which isn't a bad thing it's just something I noticed. It coats the mouth well and is carbonated just right. It's very smooth with a little bite at the end from the grain and hop bitterness.  D: I could drink more of this, but it's not something I would drink one after another. It's very strong and would go well by itself as a sipper or with something with a robust flavor like smoked cheese and sausage.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

M: nice and mild. well-suited for the style.

Nose is sharply roasty right from the beginning, almost a bit burnt, with the hops adding a bit of a dry, leafy bitterness. Wee bit of burnt sugar also. Just a bit of a piney note underneath. Nice.  Taste is big right off the bat, hoppy, piney and a bit minty over a big, robustly sharp roast. Again, almost burnt, fairly robust bitterness with a densely dark espresso roast. Mintiness from the hops is still there. Just a tiny bit of alcohol in there, almost no heat. Burnt sugar with a deep, dark fruit presence lingers on the finish.  Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, hops cut it a bit, long, lingering bitterness. Fantastic drinkability, alcohol just disappears.

Taste: ORGASM!!! I get roasted malts mixed with dark chocolate . I can taste the alcohol a little bit but enough that it balances the other flavors. Frankly, I like the balance.  Mouthfeel: Wonderful light carbonation when you first drink it followed by a silky finish.  Drinkability: Definitely drinkable. I wish I had tried this earlier in the winter.

112,412,Jadjunk,4.28,"#100. The first of many grand milestones, and well celebrated with one of the best-known Russian Imperial Stouts. Surprisingly well available in most stores that carry a decent beer selection around here, I got this in a single 12 oz. bottle at Five Points in Athens.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle to a snifter at room temp.  (Appearance) Almost an explosive pour! 3 finger depth creamy thick foamy head that nearly crowns the glass. Retention is quite nice; it will take quite a while for this head to die down. Head thickens and crowns in the center as the sides die down, leaving thin stringy lacing everywhere. Color is a solid black; no light penetration anywhere. I also can't see any carbonation, but it would be hard to make out anyways. A thoroughly satisfying appearance. 4.5  (Smell) Subtle coffee tones, cocoa, caramel, toffee and dark fruits and nuts in no particular order mesh beautifully to create some wonderfully balanced culmination. Smoky and roasted textures encompass the brew. There may also be some bitterness from some earthy hops. I figured that being in this snifter would have boosted the intensity of the brew, but it is still lacking a bit in potency. What I smell however is intriguing and pleasing. 4  (Taste) A nice roasted nutty coffee bitter beginning follows to a hazy smoky finish. Quite intensely pleasing. Good deal of bitter and sweet characteristics. The balance is great. I like it. 4.5  (Mouthfeel) A bit heavy creamy mouthfeel with some slightly prickly texture possibly from the alcohol which is otherwise well hidden from taste. Complements the style well. 4.5  (Drinkability) Warming and quite heavy on the palate, I couldn't imagine having more than two or three in a single session. ABV is on the higher end and this is quite filling. Otherwise, there are no factors that would keep me from wanting another of these. 4  Verdict: I enjoyed this. It was very complex and flavorful. It's worth getting. Here's to the next 100. A (4.35)",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Dark as a moonless night, and a decent aroma of coffee (albeit somewhat old coffee) and chocolate with a peculiar scent of lavender, which seems totally out of place but added a nice tilt to the beer. The bitterness is, relatively speaking, rather low but still elbows the malt and chocolate to the side. And then there's the ginormous head that never really goes away and is so puffy and thick that it made me want to lay my head into it and take a nap. With a dry finish and a come-from-behind alcohol smack, this is a good winter beer but somehow comes up short-- it lacks the complexity I prefer at this ABV. Good for the price.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,modernartblues,3.97,"Reviewed from Notes  12oz bottle into a Duvel Tulip  A: black-brown body with a 1"" off white head, a bit of lacing, but head retention was minimal  S: decent, chocolate, coffee, roastiness...not as roasty as other RIS, I pick up a bit of citrusy hops as well  T: not overly complex, but gets better as it warms, coffee, chocolate, dark fruits- plum...this doesn't quite do it for me. It's good (especially for the price), but drank this the night after a Stone RIS and the two just don't compare. Stone kicks this beers a** by a wide margin.  M: thick, but not overly so. good, not great for a RIS (I prefer them viscously thick).  D: I don't crave another one, which given the alcohol is not that bad a thing, but this doesn't make my best of style....",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Brunite,4.43,"A: Amost black....some ruby edge.  S: Roasty of malts, burnt coffee and dark bakers chocolate  T: Excellent. No heavy sweetness. Roasted coffee and chocolate dominates here. Some nice hoppiness finishes. A lasting chocolate brownie flavor.  M: Medium.  D: As far as the style...very good. A great sipper.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,SHODriver,4.24,"A: Pours very thick. Color is black with an ample and fairly slow to recede tan head. The head sticks around for awhile and recedes to a thin pool. S: It took awhile for the nose to reveal itself on this one but I'm picking up some coffee and chocolate notes with a touch of roast malt smell T: Beergasm. Starts off a little slow but quickly builds to some sweet chocolate flavors, a smidge of burnt sugar, and a hint of coffee. Lingering roasty aftertaste is very enjoyable and leaves you wanting more. M: Very thick and almost creamy. Maybe a touch chewy with just enough carbonation to keep it from feeling flat as it dances around the tongure D: One is quite enjoyable, two would be pushing it and three would be a challenge. This isn't a session beer by any means. More of a night cap or dessert beer.  Overall: A fantastic representation of a Russian Imperial Stout by the people at North Coast. This beer delivers a knock out punch to the taste buds and sits a bit heavy on the stomach and induces what can best be described as a beer coma.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,BeerBuckeye,3.95,"A - Pours a very dark black with foamy, creamy, carmel-colored 2-3 finger head. Great lacing lines the glass.  S - Smell seemed to be a good mixture of sweet roastyness. Notes of chocolate fudge, coffee, and even a hint of sweet nuts. A delightful, robust smell.  T - Somewhat of a chocolate-tobacco mixture, as if I was smoking a flavored cigar. The sweetness up front fades into a complex smokey/roastedness that's actually quite enjoyable. As I let it sit, I'm able to sense some more of a dark fruit taste, almost raisiny.  M - Not as thick as I actually expected. The beer coats the mouth ever so slightly, but is smooth and light in a way.  D - I'm not sure where they are hiding the alcohol in this, but it's remarkably drinkable. Of course, it's a full beer, so it's not easy to sit and down, but a perfect beer to just enjoy.  Overall - A great beer, highly recommend it.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,HarrisonDean,4.3,"Reviewed on 10/06/2009  I woke up one morning in September and realized that winter has started its long march back. Which is perfect, since us beer lovers have an entire category of beers designed to warm and relax, strong beers of character and fortitude. Old Rasputin, a Russian Imperial Stout from North Coast Brewing, is one such source of comfort on a chilly fall evening.  The bottle art is a mixture of black and gold, with a somber portrait of Rasputin glaring out with clear, intense eyes above his notorious shaggy beard; this beer embodies the spirit of the mischievous, mad monk. Poured into a tulip glass, this stout appears to be impenetrably black with a nice inch of fluffy, dark coffee head. The body swirling around is heavy and oily, holding firm as the head slowly retreats to a persistent ring at the top of the glass. The aroma is dominated by dry, yeasty dark chocolate that accommodates some coffee and fruit tones and rises above its originating roasted malt.  Each sip is extremely creamy; the body explodes and releases in the mouth. Initially, the flavors are those of sweet but dark coffee malts and raisins. Later, the body settles and shows its massive roasted malt content with some buttering hops along for the ride. Around this time you notice that the beer packs quite an alcoholic punch, but definitely takes a back seat to the grain content. This dark, malty rush gives way to the yeast-laden dark chocolate from the aroma which lingers before the bitterness of the roasted malts returns to the tongue. Fortunately, sweet mocha accompanies the finish, making this an intense but drinkable beer. Of course, if you are new to stouts, you might want to try something less devious instead.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Dreadnaught33,4.4,"Aren't well all so lucky that this beer is widely distributed and very reasonably priced. A winner I always go back to.  A: Pours out a Dark brown color, but is black in the glass. An amazing finger-two fingers of tan head retain for a while, and leave sticky tan lacing on the sides of the glass. Excellent.  S: The smell is a very roasty and savory sweet one, and a great textbook smell of the RIS style- a fat fudge note, charred black malt, coffee grounds, tobacco-cigar aromas, dark bread, some hop bitters, and smoke combine to make this great stout aroma.  T: I love that this beer has a flavor profile that seems to give an impression on all the taste buds slowly, moving from front to back. The front has the immediate biting roast and coffee like flavors which then move to a chocolatey and smoky malt rich center and then a slowly appearing bittersweet hop tinged, toasted feeling back of the palate. Other notes of tobacco, a little caramel, and some alcohol sweetness are there as well. A very finely crafted beer.  M: The mouth is pretty good, medium bodied with a good helping of carbonation, more than I usually like in a stout. The only weak point in this beer, though I've had aged bottles that I remember being smoother.  D: This is an excellent RIS that I would certainly give as a starter into the RIS style. Well done North Coast to produce this beer so well year after year.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,birderbeerer,4.35,"On the pour, the beer is a somewhat translucent, dark brown, but the result is a glass of black beer. 3 finger, espresso-colored head. Solid lacing.  Aroma is big sweet malts with noticeable coffee roast. Fairly rich and complex aroma with fruit and nuts present as well.  Taste follows the aroma. All the flavors come through at once. Coffee and rich chocolate malts with molasses and syrupy flavors too. Dry nuttiness. The fruits in the aroma don't make it to the flavor--drowned out by the roast and richer malts maybe.  Thin for it's flavor. Creamy with a bit of bite in the carbonation.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,Beertinez,4.48,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a goblet glass. It pours extremely thick like oil. A deep chocolate brown that looks black until its held up to the light. A mocha color head with about 2 fingers worth of head that eventually disappears into a half-finger head.  As soon I poured it, I got a bitter chocolate aroma. As It warms while I'm sipping, I'm getting scents of darker fruits like this dark red wine I once had. Kind of like plums.  The taste is nice and bold! A strong roasted flavor comes through and as It finishes, it combines with the earthy hop notes that kind of tickled my tongue. Very enjoyable. Like the aroma, as it warms, I'm starting to get those dark fruits. Plum and a touch raisin. It starts to finish like a wine. The alcohol is starting to come out a little but it gives you a pleasant warming feeling.  Thick yet strangely easy to drink. 9% ABV and as it warms, you can definitely sense it.  A very well-crafted stout. I had an Imperial Stout before and was not impressed but this brew definitely redeemed the style in my books. I wish I had some of this during the blizzard we had recently here in Chicago because this feels like a great beer to have in the cold.

The head retains its shape and tan color for a long time, and I see why this is beloved: complex, roasty, warming, but is just a bit too thin on the palate . Perhaps it's a psychological thing, but I expect a big Russian imperial to coat the tongue like motor oil; like Dark Lord. This is drier and spicier than DL. Spicy and peppery finish, this stout stays on the palate a long time. And for stout lovers, I see the appeal. It's just not my favorite style.

Awesome espresso bean aftertaste that makes me want to drink more. Some vague fruit/nut sweetness somewhere that makes it tastes like dessert, and I honestly would rather have a bottle of this than some fancy coffee cake thing in a restaurant.  Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy like a milkshake, and never gets too sticky or anything like that.

Second sip is still more bitter, from both hops and roasted malt. It really lingers for a big stout.  M - Huge chewy and silky smooth mouthfeel to start then it thins out as the bitterness kicks in.  D - There's so much going on with each sip that it hides the alcohol very well, and makes it such a drinkable beer. The chocolate makes it such a sweet beer, like a dessert.

112,412,Hellabeerguzzler,4.5,"I've had this on tap and bottled. This review based on a bottle I just enjoyed. The bottle appears as black as the heart of the infamous Russian whose image is proudly displayed on the label.  The beer pours black with a dark chocolate colored top that fits perfectly with any renowned RIS. The two-three finger head disappeared slowly, leaving more than enough lacing behind to let you know this stout is for real.  The smell is very, very nice with hints of sweet heavily roasted malts with delicate hints of molasses, coffee, sugar, and a touch of alcohol. An excellent bouquet.  Taste is even thicker with all of the above plus a sweet hint of raisins, prunes, charcoal, and some other bits and pieces (is that a touch of black licorice?) that you'll just have to experience for yourself to appreciate. Just delicious. I expected that this would be just a touch more mellow but will perhaps require another year - although the alcohol isn't so strong that I'd want to muddy up and risk losing the delicate flavors. I have yet to appreciate a stout more.  Mouthfeel is a non-issue. It's just great. Not overly carbonated like some and not watery or thin. Chewy, tasty, warm and sessionable. Which brings me to drinkability and you can't overscore here because although I did a 4.5, I only did to reserve one step in the rare chance that I find something that improves on Old Ras which I doubt.  If you appreciate complex stouts that still retain some semblance of a beer and are not so thick, winey, and boozy as some, you'll keep a share of this on hand year round just like I do.

112,412,Avagadro,5,"A: Pours with the usual Nitro flare, with khaki froth falling to the bottom of the glass. Head retention is top notch, lasting over 20min. The body is jet black, and opaque, no matter the lighting.  S: Bouquet is well presented, with notes of chocolate, coffee, and demerara sugar.  T: Ol' Raspy is semi-sweet with notes of dark chocolate, cream, and demerara.  M: Full bodied and creamy without being sticky or sloppy. Rich, yet delicate.  D: I have always loved the Old Rasputin, but the nitro offering is a great improvement. The bottled version is slightly hoppier than it should be, and the nitro both mutes this, and enhances the mouthfeel. Overall, this is a must have if you ever see it at your local pub.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,The3rdbeer,4,"A- Poured into a Bruery tulip a nice 1 1/2 fingers of head with nice lacing that lasts for a while. very dark brown or black.  S- Malt, toffee, dark chocolate, not as revealing as I wished  T- For me the flavors in this are a lot like a more mellow Mikkeller geek beer breakfast coffee oatmeal stout minus the great mouth feel. very well rounded here. Rolls in nicely with light coffee, little spice and dried fruits, even maybe a little anise in the after taste.  M- I hear from a lot of people(working at bevmo) that this is like the cough syrup of beers, but to me this is wonderful, not as awesome as the before mentioned Mikkeller but still really good, Medium mouth feel but nice carbonation that makes it all roll around my mouth in good fashion.  D- This is one of the better Russian Imperial Stouts that I've had this being one of my favorite styles I can say that this isn't my favorite but I could drink a 4 pack any weekend and be happy. 9% ABV makes it even better, nicely masked and fun to drink.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Overall, lighter in aroma than I was expecting.  T= Exceptional. Very well balanced- the coffee is there, but not overpowering. Some dried fruit in the form of figs and prunes, but without the sweetness often associated with them. A little spice and mild hop bitterness keep the malts in check.  M= Med-full with a surprising, pleasant, and much welcome amount of carbonation that makes for a lighter mouthfeel than is usually associated with this style.  D= This is one of the best stouts I have ever had. The higher carbonation keeps it refreshing and the 9%ABV is well masked, making this a dangerous stout that went down remarkably fast.

S - To start, it has a good oak, coffee, chocolate smell. As it warms, though, I can't get a whole lot other than alcohol. The smell for sure gets a bit boozy with time.  T - Great taste. The first time I had it, I thought it was a bit watery, but I can't see that in this bottle. Coffee and hints of dark chocolate are the forefront of the flavors.  M - Flavor sticks around for a while. The hearty carbonation shines through in the mouthfeel, too.  D - For the style this is pretty drinkable.

Taste doesn't hold back, lots of bitter roasted malt, dark chocolate, and dark roasted coffee. Fair bit of hoppy bitterness is also apparent. Alcohol's hardly noticeable at first, but gets more boozy as it warms. The booziness doesn't detract from the experience, it fits with the huge flavours going on. There's a nice nutty flavour that lingers for a long time on the tongue. Substantial rich body, good carbonation.  This is a fantastic powerful RIS. Nice big flavours, perfect for sipping on cold winter nights. The hops play a prominent role and mesh nicely with the malt profile to create many layers of complexity.

Rasputin pours jet black with a large, three finger mocha/tan, frothy head which lingers for a few minutes before receding, leaving a decent amount of lacing on the glass.  The nose is primarily of chocolate, coffee and roasted malts. Simple and elegant.  The taste is of chocolate, coffee and espresso on the forefront. A nice, delicate hop bitterness that gives way to a sweet finish which helps balance this one very well on the palate. A chocolaty finish.  Incredibly smooth and delicious. The alcohol content gives the beer a faintly hot finish but it does not take away from the beer in any imaginable way. Carbonation is very low and this one is viscous on the tongue. This one is about a year old so the hops have faded quite a bit which I find is quite beneficial to this beer.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

The Smell is a pleasant chocolate aroma with some alcohol. The taste is dark chocolate, some hops mixed in and as it warms the alcohol comes out more. Also some bitter malts in the back and a slight dark fruity taste when it warms up a bit. The mouthfeel is a nice creamy texture that leaves the mouth slightly dry. This is a very drinkable beer for stout lovers. If you love chocolate and you are a stout fan than this is a must for you.

This looks very developed with strong retention. There are roasty and sweet smells of coffee and chocolate. I'm impressed by the extremely well-balanced and complex taste due to the kick of the hops blending in so nicely with the roasty profile.

Molasses, cocoa, and raisin all over the place.  (M)- A great carbonation level and balance. So smooth and creamy going down.

112,412,PaulfromNoVa,4.85,"Caught my eye on a visit to Cape Fear Wine and Beer, picked up a few bottles, and returned to the B&B.  I'm with Todd: a freakin' evil looking bottle, with the iconic image of the Mad Monk conferring a blessing - perhaps casting out the young Prince Alexander's hemophilia but just as likely laying a Holy Whammy upon any who deign to imbibe this magical elixir...but the Cyrillic inscription (and, frankly, Cyrillic looks ominous to Westerners, like vestigial Klingon) is heartwarming: ""One does not become an intimate friend in single evening.""  Poured into a pub pint, but in increments - partially a straight pour, letting the head froth up, inches high, which subsided rather quickly to a persistent lacing. Body is black as pitch: held up to light, nothing penetrates. A liquid black hole: what secrets does it conceal? Awesome.  Nose is a first high, sweetish, hoppy-fruity. The dark toasted malt comes through in second place. Surprising.  Taste is of a magnificently balanced imperial stout, thickly sweetishly bitter, broken down into flavors easily associated with the word ""black"" - molasses, licorice, dark, dark, chocolate, roasted tree nuts, burnt toast with a thin coat of current jam, oatmeal with raisins (?)... The 9 percent ABV is hidden somewhere but has an unctuous invigorating taste of a wonderful health beverage, the kind of specialist marvel for which one has to visit exclusive spas to enjoy the privilege of drinking.  I finished the bottle 10 minutes ago and its finish lingers on my palate. I kid you not. The mouthfeel is characterized by implicit carbonation, sufficient to give the profound weight of the stout a wisp of airy lightness.  Compared to this, Guiness Stout is club soda...  It is sub-freezing in Wilmington, our room is like a meat locker, I half-expect to see a side of beef in the wardrobe, but this remarkable brew is cosseting in its warmth. I'd very much like another.

S - Cocoa powder, black licorice, molasses and roastiness....can't wait to taste it T - Surprised by the earthy hoppiness in this one. North Coast website doesn't say, but I'm guessing there's a healthy dose of Simcoe hops in here. But first impression is of sweet, roasted malts; molasses, coffee aftertaste (but not really *flavor*) and then that nice earthy bitterness, which lingers for as long as you can stand to wait for the next sip. The roasted malt flavor also mixes in with the hoppy linger. Aftertaste is quite similar to some Black IPAs I've had...

It poured very nicely, total black, creamy head. It had faint hints of coffee and chocolate. I was somewhat disappointed at this point. Then the taste, it was good, enjoyable but not something to get excited about. What I really found missing, was that it wasnt big. It did not fill my mouth as many other bigger stouts have done.

This brew has a very nice head that possesses wonderful staying power and leaves gobs of lace as it recedes into the dark liquid.  The aroma is bursting with bitter cocoa and roasty coffee. It also has a definite hop presence that is quite citrusy and slightly earthy. Some chalk, a pinch of vanilla and a rumor of alcohol round out this beer's nose.  One sip and it is easy to see why this is such a popular beer. Astringent roasted malts, coffee, dark chocolate, citrus hops, molasses, leather and a hint of dark fruit are all flavor components. This beer has tons of stuff going on, but everything seems quite well balanced. There is not even a hint of the ABV and the balance of bitter and sweet is right on.  The mouthfeel is on the lightest edge of full, with the beer having a nice chewy sort of texture. It is fairly coating, yet does not leave a whole lot of stickiness on the palate, finishing dry overall. Some hops and plenty of astringent roasty notes hang around for the aftertaste.  I am really regretting that I had not tried this beer for so long. It has a lot to offer and is a great example of the style. I especially appreciate that it is hoppy, but not overly so like say a fresh Storm King. This really allows the roasted malt to show through while still giving it that little something extra.

Flavor is much like the smell (only much stronger) with the roasted grains, biscuit flavors, and strong dark chocolate. The bitterness of this beer almost perfectly balances the malt. One thing that sets this RIS apart from the rest is that it's much dryer than others that I have tried in the past. Don't get me wrong, I love a big malty RIS but this is really a nice change for the style. Also, the 9%+ ABV is very well hidden which makes this a very drinkable beer.  The mouthfeel for this beer is on the medium side most likely due to the dryness of the beer.  One final note, I love it when big beers come in 12oz bottles instead of exclusively coming in bombers.

Smell- Coffee, roast, dark chocolate and small hops  Taste- Hoppy on the forefront with a citrusy tinger. It works well together and then on the back you get the roast, chocolate coffee.  Mouth- Full bodied with a a medium carbonation. A very well done aftertaste. It goes down so smooth. Very rich as well.  Drink- 9% isn't noticable at all.

Excellent taste, with a huge malt kick, wonderful roasted grains, a small chocolate hit at the end, and a nice hit of hops that comes through just a bit at the end as well; no alcohol tinge, either, which was a huge bonus.

Aroma is of roast chocolate, coffee, licorice, dark fruits, and quite phenolic. Flavor is sweet chocolate, roast coffee, caramel, and phenols. Palate is full bodied viscous; extremely smooth. Finish is bittersweet chocolate and a little too phenolic. I can't say it's my favorite RIS.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

I also get plenty of malts barleys and some chocolate maybe  T- It's a barley front with a hop finish. Totally different than other RIS that I have had before. I like this it's not what I would expect.  M- A bigger beer of course.  D- A couple of these no problem. Would love it on Nitro tap i would assume.,North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,BigHeavy,4.75,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Duvel tulip. Beer was allowed to warm for 30 or so minutes before sweet, sweet consumption.  A: Beer pours an absolutely opaque, pitch black. Looks kinda like motor oil, but not the clean stuff. The stuff that you left in for 3,000 too many miles. A luscious mocha head two fingers in height forms and lingers for quite a while before settling to about a half finger. Beautiful lacing appears with each sip.  S: Aroma is rich in dark chocolate and hops. Hops smell citrusy to me. There are some dark fruits thrown in there as well, which complement the aforementioned scents quite nicely. A touch of alcohol stings the nostrils (in a good way) as well.  T: Those citrus hops dominate the taste early in the sip. They give way to some bitter dark chocolate. It's like a one two punch of bitterness from hops and roasted malts. Just an incredible sensation in a stout. I can pick out those dark fruits and a little bit of black coffee notes as well. Just an amazing beer.  M: Smooth, rich, creamy, coating. Where doth I begin? Beer just feels awesome moving around the mouth with every sip. Beer is also thick and a little chewy.  D: Well, the beer definitely disappeared from my glass pretty quickly. The 9.0% ABV will creep up on you a little, so be cautious when having more than one. Perfect as a before bed sipper.  O: In my humble and unimportant opinion, Old Rasputin in the perfect interpretation of a Russian Imperial Stout. It takes the already awesome style and throws aggressive hopping into the mix. It's in your face with flavors from start to finish. A perfect way to end a night OR start a day.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,sacrelicio,5,"This is the best Russian Imperial Stout that could ever exist. It is roasty, toasty, chocolatey, coffee tasting, sweet, bitter, smooth and balanced. It is absolutely perfect in every way.  The stout pours jet black, brown edges, chocolate milk head, about a finger thick (the dark chocolate milk, just like I like to make it) that laces nicely.  The smell is roasty, toasty, chocolatey. Perfect melding of notes. The taste is roasty, toasty, chocolatey, coffee tasting, sweet, bitter, smooth and balanced. The flavors knit together so perfectly, it brings tears to my eyes. Perfect.  Mouthfeel is full but not heavy or cloying. The drinkability is perfect. Amazing in every way. Stupendous.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Grin,3.87,"The smell is strong but nothing characteristic. The initial sip was bitter with a strong, almost cough syrup taste but I noticed the rich chocolate after letting it breath for about 5 minutes.

I would say, better suited for the winter months.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Slight alcohol kick, warms a little going down.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth, maybe a little creamy, full-bodied. A little high on the carbonation, but it's not a deal breaker.  Drinkability: Awsome beer!

112,412,Vierenner,3.06,"I was expecting more from this beer -- the writeup at the store claimed very high marks from BA. I found it to be bitter and somewhat harsh.

On a positive note, it pours with a very nice head ... disappearing after a minute or so as expected.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,SkunkWorks,4.5,"Review is from notes.  Served in a snifter at the World of Beer in Orlando, Florida. Was my second round of the day and decided to go for something nostalgic; Old Rasputin was the first Russian Imperial Stout I remember having... this time it'll be on draught instead of in a bottle!  Look: black with a dark, dark red highlight at the bottom when held to the light. A thin layer of light brown foam sits on the top and literally retains forever. I was served my glass first, waited for my two companions to be served their glasses to let the beer warm a bit, and still the foam was there. Incredible considering the style.  Smell: I see why this beer got me into the Russian Imperial Stout style so easily already. Bittersweet chocolate dominates. Hints of coffee and hops are there as well but this is intensely chocolatey.  Taste: Follows the nose nicely. The chocolate flavor stands out heavily but the hops and coffee flavors come out a bit more, though it is not over powering with either. Absolutely delicious. No hint of alcohol or dark fruit, which is a quality I happen to like about this one.  Feel: medium to full bodied, quite creamy, no alcohol warmth and tending towards sweet rather than bitter. Carbonation is low and spot on for the style.  Drink: quite incredibly drinkable. I definitely thought about drinking one or two more of these after I finished my glass, if only I didn't have to leave the bar!  Overall, absolutely amazing. The great thing about Old Raspution continues to be the fact that it can stand side to side with world class Russian Imperial Stouts despite being affordable and easy to find, without all the release day, hype, and low bottle counts. I am glad I saw this on tap and maybe I'll pick up a four pack of this again in the near future to revisit this one more fully.  On a side note, I am glad that this one has held up against my palate as I've grown over the past two years as a craft beer drinker.

112,412,boudreaux,4.55,"A -  S - An extremely dark roasted malty aroma, with a hint of alcohol too.  T - Flavors are excellent; starting out with creamy chocolate and roasted coffee flavors, evolving with nutty flavors as well; addition of alcohol actually contributes positively overall to the beer's flavors; 9% alcohol content is very well matched with the sweet aspects to provide a strong flavor; very powerful and lasting flavors of coffee and dark chocolate, with some dark fruity and acidic tastes at the very end  M - again, due to the alcohol, a nice warming sensation washes over me after about the 3rd swig; thick but surprisingly not sticky afterfeel in my mouth; very pleasant  D - If the empty bottles didn't let me know how many I drank, I'd've easily died of alcohol poisoning.

112,412,afksports,4.22,"Yum. One of the best Russian Imperial Stouts that you can get in a 4pack almost anywhere in NYC at a reasonable price. Those are solid, solid, factors for me when evaluating a beer. Especially considering all the costs that this beer trading is getting me into.  North Coast's Old Rasputin pours a black medium to full body with dark brown edges and a moderate tan head. It's sudsy with a swirl, and has a crazy good malty and toasty aroma that jumps out from the glass. Dark and rich, the taste profile isn't wide, but the rich malts it hits on the head. The hops it nails too, with just the right balance to let you know the hops are there, but not overpowering. It's a big beer, albeit its short 12oz bottle. And with 18 proof, it's not that you'll do more than sip -- unless you're cool with binging.  Then again, I did sorta just blow through this glass right now. Hmm.

It carried a sweet nose of dark roasted malt with a strong note of cocoa and faint hint of dark berry fruit. A crisp and bright upfront feel leads to a dark roasted earthy cocoa dominated center into a slowly resonating echo of an espresso bean finish. There are finishing notes of earthy dark fruit, perhaps fig, and dark chocolate. An overall good beer in my book.

With addition of alcohol and hops.  Taste- Lots of hop character in this one. I think the coffee and chocolate flavors take a back seat in this RIS, which is a little backwards usually.  Mouthfeel- Good mouthfeel. I tend to like them a little thicker, but that is just me.  Drinkability- At 9% I would stick with one, but it is not so boozy that I wouldn't consider another.

Taste - If this beer were a whiskey it would be a 20+ year aged very high quality single malt scotch. Smokey, bold and very complex. This is a beer I could envision Ivy League professors sitting around drinking at the end of a day. It has an excellent balance of chocolate and malts balanced out with hints of hops in the aftertaste. For 9% APV, the alcohol is extremely well disguised. The only negative I can say about the taste is that it still tastes like an American craft beer with the flavors that don't replicate as a Brisish beer. Aside from the ""Americanized"" craftbrew flavors its a great beer.  Mouthfeel - Creamy and rich. Excellent.  Drinkability - With a well balance of malt/hops and a well disguised 9%, this is one bold complex beer that is easy to drink. Well done!

Roastiness dominates the flavors with almost no note of the alcohol. Some chocolate is in there too but restrained. A little surprised the body wasn't fuller than it was. Could've been a byproduct of the carbonation level. Just wasn't what it could've been. But it did make for a very drinkable beer despite being a big one. Very surprising but it's a good surprise.  Overall a really nice beer. Could've used some tweaks here or there. Really just ended up being a really alcoholic robust porter to me. Nothing that would identify it as a RIS.

Then, some roasty malts start to come out, and as all those flavors fade, some bitter hops cruise on in to finish out the taste.

Taste -- Again, LOTS of dark chocolate, licorice, black coffee, anise, vanilla, and an abundance of leafy hop bitterness.  Mouthfeel -- Medium-full in body with gentle carbonation.  Drinkability -- Having this on nitro-tap deserves a second review. Beyond the smooth and creamy body, the chocolate notes are pushed far into the forefront. Great stuff.

The flavor lingers Forever, and the nose has something different to enjoy before every sip. This is a perfect beer for hanging around a cold home, or if you are looking to enjoy just one beer for the evening. Highly recommended!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,TheSupremeAJ,4.5,12oz bottle poured into St. Bernardus chalice. Served @ ~55F.  A- Nice pitch black with a khaki head. Fades to a thin layer.  S- Dark roasty malts and nice hop aroma that really shines through despite the dark coffee/cocoa notes.  T- Very nice roasty flavor without the sweetness of many of the other RIS' that I've tried. I love black coffee and this has some very same characteristics that make me love it so much. This is a real no bullshit brew!  M- The hop aromas stick around real nice and the carb is perfect.  D- Very nice RIS that is nice and balanced. Not very sweet and I enjoy it a lot.,North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,orangesol,4.07,"Served on nitro-tap at Al's of Hampden into a nonic pint.  A - Pours used motor oil black with a thin, almost non-existent, head leaving thin rings of lacing down the glass.  S - Plenty of dark roasted malt blends well with the coffee, chocolate, and a faint hint of dark fruits. Some vanilla and cream sweetness helps keep things balanced as much as possible. Very nice nose.  T - Flavors are very similar to the nose. Rich coffee and cocoa dominate this one with some vanilla sweetness offering a bit of balance. Very rich, dark malted texture in the finish lingers for some time. If anything it was a bit thin, and given the nitro serving I can't see how that can happen..maybe too cold? Either way I have had this before, it is one of my favorites, and I will have it again. Hopefully those will be better than this one...  M - Heavy body and flavor with moderately low carbonation for being on nitro. Not the thick, creamy, stout I was expecting to receive when I ordered it to say the least.  D - Still very high. Even with the carb issues this is still one of my go to stouts. I was more disappointed in the pour than I was in the beer. I will have to re-review this one at a later time...",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

In the middle of the tongue, I get hints of chocolate and some sweetness from dark fruits. The finish is a dry hop bitterness. M/D: Very thick, full body really coats the mouth. This beer has very little in the way of carbonation. Very drinkable. Hides the alcohol well.  This is one of the most balanced and complex RIS I've ever had.

112,412,BeerPhan86,4.52,"This is a very special beer and takes me back to winter a few years ago when the world of imperial stouts was opened up to me. I would rank it among the best imperial stouts I have sampled, and I always seem to pick it up a few times a winter now. Poured into my Duvel tulip glass...  A - Black as oil and completely opaque with a nice 1 finger light brown head. Very good retention on the head and sticky lacing that smothers the side of the glass.  S - An onslaught of dark roasted malts, toffee, and bitter chocolates. Hints of dark fruit and some noticeable alcohol but nothing extremely boozy.  T - Tons of roasted barley and chocolate malt with a slightly burnt aftertaste. Coffee flavors start to develop in the aftertaste and it has a slightly boozy, dry finish. Well balanced by a slightly bitter hop backbone. This is an amazing stout.  M - Thick, chewy, and lightly carbonated.  D - Definitely a flavorful sipper but nothing overpowering that you couldn't enjoy two or three. Still I usually keep it to one per session and really let the flavors open up as it warms.

Smells of bitter-sweet chocolate, some smoky malt and a hint of brown sugar, and maybe some roast coffee bean and black cherry. Smell is significant, and strong. I can smell the alcohol.  Taste is complex. Creamy malt and chocolate up front, some smoke and coffee, and smokey black cherry and chocolate finish. Hints of bitter-sweet chocolate and coffee in the aftertaste.

Looks as a stout should, idling after the pour into my Captain Lawrence tulipsniftermagigger. Head colored like brown sugar rises to the rim of the glass after a semi-vigorous pour. Laces nicely as it disspates leaving rings of amorphous bubbles clung to the glass' wall. Retention leaves something to be desired.  Smell has bitter chocolate, used coffee grounds and a notable boozy heat. There are also some vinous dark fruit undertones but are very subtle. Notes of molasses and some hidden gingersnap in here as well.  Taste begins with malt, bittersweet chocolate, and somewhat of a spicy heat from the alcohol and hops which i am surprised to still be in existence. Lingering bitterness and unsweetened chocolate aftertaste as well.  Mild carbonation makes its presence known throughout and especially at the finish. A notable thick mouthfeel is noted but light given the abv and style, certainly not disparaging to drink.  Drinkability certainly is not restricted by its alcohol content. It's well mellowed and is unobtrusive in everything but the very finish where it warns you of what's to come if you have too much.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Almost two fingers of brown head, covered with small bubbles. Head retreats slowly and leaves nice, consistent lacing. Very attractive stout.  Initial smell is dark roasted malts, followed by bitter chocolates. The alcohol is there, but lightly and beautifully. There is a small sweetness as well that reminds me of chocolate milk.  Taste is dark and rich. Sweet and bitter malts. The lactose-like sweetness is still there too. A few warm hops on the tongue mix with the alcohol, which is barely discernable. The more is warms, the more I can pick up on a cold coffee flavor. There is an ever so slight smokiness to the finish as well. Complex.  MF: Impressive as well.

112,412,ToasterChef,4.08,"A cellar temperature bottle is poured into a small snifter. The liquid is an opaque, deep brown color. The head is foamy and also brown. An impressive coat of foam and film is left behind as I swirl the beer around the glass.  A malty nose contains notes of dark chocolate and coffee beans. It is more sweet than bitter, but I wouldn't call it a sweet smell--it's more complex than that.  The taste of this beer closely mirrors its aroma. There is a powered milk chocolate taste initially. Weak coffee and dark chocolate flavors appear in the middle, before I swallow. Some bitterness appears as the beer is consumed. Some alcohol is also present at this time. The aftertaste isn't my thing; there's too much of the alcohol and coffee bitterness for me (obviously, I'm not a coffee drinker).  The mouthfeel is very impressive, considering this is a 9% ABV beer. It is a little sticky, but doesn't feel thick. Carbonation is at a good level. A little film is left coating my mouth, but it isn't as large as other beers in this style.  This is a pretty drinkable RIS. It is not overkill to purchase and consume this by the four pack. A bottle or two would be great to accompany a meal (or dessert) or on its own.

112,412,ThePorterSorter,4.3,"Appearence: Terrifically dark and and rich. There was an impressive head that formed initially, but it quickly withered. Held up to the light there is only 12am blackness. Lacing is prevalent down the sides of the glass.  Smell: Smells sugary sweet and rich. There is a malty goodness that this beer gives off, but you can almost tell that drinking it will present a new element of bitterness. Very velvety smooth smelling, almost milky, which makes this beer seem more like a meal in a glass than just a drink accompaniment.  Taste: Tastes nice and bitter with a great balance. Upfront creaminess and a very nice following aftertaste. I definitely was reminded of all of the best stouts I've ever had while drinking this. The beer is supreme, and it exemplifies its class. There is great depth of flavor followed by tremendous balance. I get notes of milk chocolate, rich, roasted coffee, and a bitter hoppiness.  Mouthfeel: Smooth beer that you can either sip or gulp. Try it cool or room temp., it's still going to be a tremendous beer. You would probably benefit the most from trying this beer before a big meal because it is very dense. However, this beer feels like a dessert, so if you can handle the challenge, make a move and you will definitely feel good about turning down the tiramisu for a beer of this caliber.  Drinkability: This beer feels like a dark chocolate smoothie that hides the 9% abv very well. I drank it up before finishing this review and definitely would get it again. Super stoutilicious and great for the cold winter months. Try the beer once, you will be sold on it as well as stouts in general.

112,412,TheBrewo,4.35,"This brew pours a motor oil black. We get a nice medium brown colored head of two fingers, which retains for a bit, then dissipates into a bubbly film across the top of the liquid. Spotty and sparse lacing appears as we sip. The aroma is huge in roasty malts. There is typical dark chocolate and a healthy alcoholic aroma, with subtle hints of fresh coffee bean wafting in and out. Hops are also abundant, making for a balance through the nose. The taste buds are assaulted with deeply roasted malts at the very front. Therein mixes a bittersweet dark chocolate that is more bitter than sweet. This affectively rolls back on the palate through the middle of the taste. Here there is also a curious organicness to it. There is dark, peppery spice, and incredibly subtle flavors almost similar to a vegetable juice (tomato and cucumber come to mind). The finish is robustly malty, but cleanly hoppy, and a bit sweet. As the sip departs the drinker breathes coffee remnants, ghostly hops, and more roasted malt. The body is full, with an almost syrupy feel. The carbonation is light and, while the mouth is left coated, once that dissolves it is dried. The abv is nice and high, as it should be, and this warming beer is a sipper.  Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was its robust attitude. The aroma was dark and foreboding, but also inviting with its sweetness of hops. The taste is very much the same way, but is nicely balanced and complex.

Smell: A whole spectrum of roasted malt, great coffee and vanilla aromas, and a bit of chocolate.  Taste: Dark roasted and chocolate malt starts, then espresso sneaks in, bringing in a ton of dark chocolate and some vanilla flavors.

Appearance - The beer pours a dark brown/black colour with a very large frothy and rocky light brown coloured head. I can't see much carbonation due the darkness of the beer and there is very nice lacing running down the sides of the glass. The head lasted for several minutes before it began to disappear.  Smell - coffee, malts, chocolate, hops, vanilla  Taste & Mouth - The beer doesn't have a whole lot of carbonation, but it feels very light and creamy on the palette. It's packed full of chocolate and coffee flavour mixed with malts. There is also a lot of bitterness from the coffee and the hops. The beer gives a warming feeling in my chest but the alcohol isn't really detectable. The beer finishes with little bit of a peppery/spicy aftertaste.

112,412,TheQuietMan22,4.27,"Appearance: Straight pour into a becker glass. The color is a deep, completely opaque black; no light passed through when I held it to my lamp. A thick, three-finger head of cappuccino-colored foam developed and dissipated very slowly to leave a ring around the edge.  Smell: Loads of roasted glory. Roasted chocolate, coffee, and caramel malts. There is also a nice toffee and molasses sweetness to keep the aroma balanced. There are also hints of dark berries: to me it smelled like blueberry and raspberry. There is a little dark fruit in the mix as well. It is a very enticing aroma.  Taste: More roasted glory, and the first sip was a shock of burnt bitterness; the overpowering intensity, though, passed after a couple sips. Roasted chocolate and coffee malts. The caramel from the smell is there, but it instead adds a touch of sweetness. The taste is nutty and also features flavors of dark fruit (perhaps plum), toffee, molasses, and vanilla. Way deep down, at the very end of each sip, is a noticeable alcohol edge that tickles the back of the throat, but it is very faint and does nothing to interfere with the other flavors.  Drinkability: Excellent beer. It is very complex, flavorful, and warming.

When I poured this bottle the first impression I got was that it looked like I spilled oil, not that that is a bad thing, looks are deceiving.  The head stayed at about two fingers and slowly dissipated. The color was very dark, which I like.  When I sniffed the glass the flavors that aroused my senses were molasses, coffee, and caramel.

Huge 2-finger foamy mocha head on a fairly aggressive pour. Sticks around for a while. Has a little lacing. Picture perfect looking stout.  S: A TON of dark chocolate and dark roasted coffee. Molasses/burnt sugar, bitter hops. A lot of bitterness coming out of the nose  T: Tastes very similar to the nose. Dark, bitter chocolate, coffee, and molasses are strong. There's a ton of robust dark roasted malt, almost on the verge of char. The hops are quite strong, mainly floral and leafy. The alcohol is definitely evident and makes it just a little boozy. The finish is dry and has that bitter leafy hop astringency. There's just a ton of bitterness in this, a bit too much for my taste (for a stout).  M: Medium carbonation, body seems a little thin, it is chewy, but overall, not that smooth or viscous.

112,412,TCHopCraver,3.98,"Reviewed from notes written on 11/28/10.  Rasputin has the prototypical RIS look. The body has a deep black hue with a slight mocha-brown tint. A dense dark khaki to mocha head sits at a one-finger hight above that body. The head takes a while to fade and leaves a cloudy and bubbly, full-covering film of froth. The lacing is phenomenal - sticky, sizzling with carbonation, substantial, and sexy.  Roasted malts with a bit of a nutty tinge tickle my nostrils at first whiff. Behind those scents lie a hearty acidic coffee aroma, and just a hint of dark chocolate. Very subtle notes of plum and blackberry also infiltrate my nose.  The bitter flavors of the roasted malt, coffee, nuttiness, and a slight hop presence zap the tip of my tongue and sides of my mouth, while the deeper flavor of plum and dark chocolate massage the fat of my tongue. I've had this beer several times prior to reviewing, and I don't remember it being this roasty and bitter. Perhaps this bottle is really fresh and the roasted malt and hops haven't mellowed out yet. The roasty-ness and bitterness do outweigh the deep, coating sweet flavors in this bottle, for sure, and it is to the overall detriment of the taste.  The feel in my mouth is puckering and coating at the same time. It is a pretty medium to full feel on the broad of my tongue with a crisp and biting, cleansing feeling on the sides of my palate. This has got to be a really fresh bottle, as I think there is a huge bittering hop presence.  The drinkability of this bottle is tough to rate for me because I know I've had Rasputin before when it has been much less bitter and more drinkable. I think I need to start a campaign for all breweries to label when the beer was bottled. I have had too many disappointing bottles of beer because there is no bottling date on the label. For me, this was too roasty and hoppy, but I have had Rasputin when it is not that way. What's a beer drinker to do?",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Filled my pint glass with over an inch of head, took quite awhile to pour, increasing the anticipation.  A - Deep black with a slight tint of amber. A foamy tan head that makes this beer look like an inverted oil spill. I love that my wife cringes when I drink it because she can't imagine consuming something so menacing.  S - Dark chocolatey, the kind I would normally steer clear of in solid form, but always smells great. Also it's got the morning roasted coffe scent going. And finally a hint of smokiness.  T - As with the smell, strong chocolate followed by the coffee finish. A bitterness that's welcoming.  M - Smooth and full. Not the thickess as one would assume from the look, but enough that your mouth is coated after a few drinks and you can continue to swallow air and it tastes like your still drinking the beer. Near Perfect.  D - I expected a moderatley slow drink, but surprisingly the 9.0 ABV doesn't stand out. I find myself sadened that in the time it took to write the review I seem to have finished the beer. This 4-pack could go very quickly indeed.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Army,4.65,a: Head builds to a ¼ inch of rusty tan foam and is sustained throughout drinking. A lacy network of foam surrounds the glass as the black fluid is drained. Numerous large bubbles continue to feed into the head throughout.  s: Sweet chocolate caramel aroma predicts the flavors to follow.  t: Coffee and chocolate flavors dominate the flavor with sweet caramel backgrounds. There is a bitterness and bite to this brew that is well balanced by the malty sweetness.  m: Big bubbles and very full body contribute to the velvet smooth feel.  d: Bitter coffee aftertaste leaves you wanting another drink. Its warm and enticing flavor and feel are perfect for a cold winter night. A very hardy beer of sustenance.,North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,optimistictour,4.38,"This was probably my first RIS and I never knew it. At a place called Barcade in Brooklyn, I perused an immaculately populated rotating menu of brews and chose the one which sounded heaviest. Along with the description of the many ways it took to kill the titular Russian, the menu mentioned dark chocolate and coffee bitterness, and a snifter glass. I was intrigued enough to order two.  But this isn't a review of that beer. This is me, a year later, experiencing my now-favorite style via a 4 pack purchased at the highly dependable Ladd's & Co. in Norton Shores, MI.  I've got to say, it stands up to almost any beer out there with the visuals. Midnight black with a serious dark tan head, the kind of oily pouring action that excites my taste buds, it's a looker. Maybe not the very best but it's up there.  Smell is beyond solid. But it's a sort of monolithic goodness, with a lack of distinctive signature - just a huge awesome coffee chocolate bitter smoky olfactory massage. It's a treat but not so interesting, you know?  Taste is like some sort of pirate spokesman for the RIS world. It says, here lay vast treasures, arggghhh, that welcome you in with the rich aroma of fresh brewed coffee and a healthy dollop of semi-sweet chocolate, roasting atop golden boughs of majestic maltiness.  Mouthfeel is, to put it lightly, superb. This thing seems to have a perfect balance of carbonation and heaviness. It's thick but washes away quickly. Basically, yeah, combined with the taste it's a winner here too.  Drinkability is off the charts for something resting around 9% abv. This thing could easily pass for a porter in the 6% range. That is, until you've had a few...",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,mattgreger,4.48,"Had this brew at Capone's on Nitro  This brew poured as black as it gets. There is absolutely no light coming through on this brew. This brew had a huge mocha color head that mushroomed over the top of the glass. Throughout the drink, the lacing walled the sides of the glass, even remaining when the brew was gone.  Wow, malts. The aroma hits you at the start. It has a nice sweet flavor with a nice hearty alcohol backbone. There is a caramel, chocolate and coffee malts present, maybe more. There is also a touch of some dark fruits as well, especially prunes.  As expected, the malt character shined through in the taste, as they did in the aroma. The chocolate malts dominate the brew. There is a bit of the dark fruits present in the taste, but the malts push them to teh back of the brew. This brew is very sweet for a stout, especially with one with such a high ABV. There is not really alcohol burn. So this brew has a nice bold flavor.  The mouthful on this one is very creamy. It coats very well, and goes done very easily. The chocolate taste stays for quite a while. It has a nice bold brew, with a nice sweet/chocolate finish.  This brew is a pretty good drink, especially for the ABV. Its not overly think, but creamy and goes down super easy. Its not a chugger by any means, but a great brew to take a gulps of.

Motor oil Black Sabbath black with a HUGE 2+ finger head that almost flowed over, didn't mean to pour too hard - oops!, but a firm hearty insane mocha colored froth with a hint of commie reddish ruby overtone... ha!... comes back strong on a good swirl o' the glass when halfway thru with really good lacing as well.  Nose of bitter coffee and sweetness of malt. Medium-firm body with robust flavors throughout... a little smoke and fire, obvious coffee bitter, malts and dark fruit earthiness. Alcohol hidden very well. A good bite on the tongue at first sip but mellows to malty awesomeness as the pint dwindles.

Lots of visible carbonation rising up on the sides of the glass.  S - Malts malts and more malts. Smells sweet with a good alcohol backbone. Coffee chocolate and caramel are the main malt aromas. Some dark fruits come through as well.  T - Those malt characters are definitely carried through the taste. Chocolate dominates this time though. Dark fruits are pushed way to the back to make room for the malts. Still tastes very sweet for a stout this high in ABV. No noticeable alcohol burn though this is a rather old bottle so that could have faded with time.  M - Creamy, coats the mouth and slides down the throat very easily. Chocolate taste lingers for a long time. Finish, like the rest of the beer, is sweet and chocolate-y.  D - Very good drinkability for the ABV. Not too thick, not too hot to take larger gulps, though not a beer I would want to go through too quickly.

A: This obviously pours pitch black with a finger and a half of small-bubbled, khaki-colored head. It actually looks similar to FBS but the lacing doesn't quite match up.  S: The nose is of chocolate, espresso, dark fruits, perhaps some licorice; the typical repertoire of the style.  T: The taste shows the notes of coffee and chocolate, but the sweet and sour dark fruits that take over set it apart from most imperial stouts.  M: This is surprisingly light on the palate which is definitely a negative aspect. On the plus side, it does not show any boozy heat or stickiness.

Fantastic lacing all the way down the glass.  Aromas are a bit boozy, heavy on coffee and chocolate.  Flavors are strong with roasted coffee and bitter chocolate. There is some balancing bitterness that has a bit of a grassy note to it, but there is a lingering bitter cocoa taste in the linger.

112,412,Lucklys,4.15,"It poured a dark, deep mahogany black, and allowed hints of what I can only describe as a russet-chestnut color to peek through just under the head when placed in the light. It quickly built a finger thick toasted tan head of creamy froth with fairly good retention right out of the bottle, which gradually dissipated to a medium collar and a large, thin patch of foam blanketing the middle. It left nice thin sheets of beige lace that lasted through the drink, as well.  I was initially confronted with lots of lightly sweet oats, burnt rye, and bittersweet dark chocolate - nothing really out of the ordinary from what I understand. But beneath those, I had to dig a little to find hints of espresso hanging on heavily roasted caramel malts, toffee, and something dark and ripe, reminiscent of grapes/raisins or plums/prunes. I didn't find the smell to be vinous, as it hardly resembles wine in my book, but the fruits I found can definitely be associated with wine. To finish, there was one last thing hiding way in the back that I was just barely able to get a grasp of, something bitter and hoppy. A warning, perhaps, of what I was really going to put in my mouth.  It took all of half a second; the first half of that half a second was me rolling the tip of my tongue in a roast coffee, the second half was me reeling at the ridiculous bitterness pinching the inside of my cheeks, back of my tongue, and roof of my mouth. It was way more bitter than I expected with some sort of super hop that added a tart lemony bitterness, minus the sweetness, that pummeled my taste buds nearly to an exhilarating death. I say exhilarating because I am a huge fan of Imperial IPAs and the more bitter, the better, but I was not ready for a drink that was supposed to taste like chocolate and coffee to be that KAPOW. So as I revitalized my mouth with each electrocuting sip, I was able to focus more on what was really behind all of the things going on in this complex stout. Other than the immediate roast coffee, there was the bittersweet chocolate, burnt caramel, dark sweet malts, and a faint yeast mixed with the ripe plums/prunes I found in the nose.  Holding that crazy punchy bitterness helped to give the beer a medium to full body mouthfeel and it felt like a heavy cream on my tongue. Even with a hopped up spicy carbonation, it managed to stay smooth throughout the drink and made plenty of room for a very dry finish. There was a lasting aftertaste, but it was a warm aftertaste filled by a 9%ABV. Quite a hearty beer and thus not for the faint of heart.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,weizenbob,4.38,"12 ounce pour into a pint glass. An fluffy three-finger-tall tan head enthusiastically sets up and refuses to go away. It does slowly settle a bit leaving a lot of sticky lacing on the glass. The beer itself is a black hole; even light cannot escape! In short, it's one of the most impressive looking beers I've ever poured.  The nose is bursting with sweet earthy aromas. Caramelized malt is up front but only slightly trailed by a very noticeable alcohol content. Sweet chocolate scents also feature in this nose hair tickling whiff.  The flavor profile follows the scent only magnified twice over. Roasted malt provides a nice smokey flavor that is overtaken almost immediately by the alcohol bum rush. It's not boozy per se, but you definitely notice the presence of the high alcohol content, with a small amount of alcohol burn and a nice warmth in the back of the mouth and throat. Intensity seems to be the name of the game here, and though the alcohol is quite apparent, it never overtakes the rest of the brew, which seems to have been cranked to 11. Next there is a brief but intense sweetness, which is finished by a fantastic earthy character. It's impressive for sure.  The mouthfeel is nice, if a little light for a brew of this intensity. The maltiness of this stout provides a nice weight and the minimal carbonation helps the cause. I could wish that this were a little thicker, bur there are really no complaints here. It finishes incredibly clean, which is baffling considering the flavor assault on my mouth.  For a brew of such high alcohol and so much flavor, this drinks surprisingly well. Obviously you couldn't session this without getting seriously crunk. It's drinkable enough that you could put one of these away dangerously fast, but you'd be doing yourself a disservice. This is a stout to be sipped and savored. Drinkability points are docked for the very noticeable high ABV but that is splitting hairs. I'd drink these all night if I were Superman.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,tehawful,4.03,"On a recent trip to a new liquor store, the picture of Rasputin directed my attention to this Imperial Stout. Being such a sucker for marketing...I couldn't resist. Rasputin pours pitch black with a dense tan head. There is a strong aroma of malt, dark fruit, chocolate and oak.  Wow, this is quite a stout. Malts are heavily roasted with hints of bitter coffee and a bit of dark chocolate, the subtle dark fruit flavor is also there. Rasputin finishes dry as the high ABV presents itself and lingers. The mouthfeel is decent, but maybe just a slight bit thinner than what I usually hope for in a stout (though still closer than a lot of the stouts out there).  Overall this is a bold but enjoyable Russian Imperial. The ABV is present, but does not ruin the experience...though I wouldn't have more than two at a time (probably a great desert beer).",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Appearance: Pours a viscous jet black with a huge brown head that cascades down the glass (at least initially) and leaves sticky rings of lace.  Smell: Extremely rich, complex roasted malts of dark chocolate, and slightly burnt coffee.  Taste: Huge hit of roasted malts on the first sip with some slightly higher bitterness than the nose would have you believe. Malt character is cocoa and espresso with some toasted grain. Some very faint prune fruity esters. Alcohol warmth is present but not overpowering.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied and chewy with a velvety texture. Some smoothing warmth from the alcohol.

112,412,airheadmtrcycle,4.14,"Poured from a bottle into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint. Wow! What a beautiful pour. Two fingers of caramel head and BLACK, and I mean black. The head begins to fade as it warms and leaves behind thick, egg-white lacing. Thicker than I've experienced before. The foam left behind looks like crema on an espresso.  The smell is smokey with roasted malts but it's hard to make out any of the other aromas. Taste's smokey also, but there's chocolate and some balanced to light hops as well. The roasted malts dominate. I like that there's no burnt flavors. This is really a great tasting stout. As it warms the flavors increase, but this is not an intense beer. It's low key in a very good way. I'll be darned if I can pick up any alcohol taste at all. How did they hide 9% ABV?  The mouthfeel is luscious with low carbonation, and may be the ale's best quality. It would be easy to drink 2 or 3 of these, but I had not had anything to eat. I could feel the alcohol kicking my arse, so I settled for only one. That makes the drinkability hard to rate.  If you like stouts you have to try Old Rasputin. It may be the best stout I've ever had. Keep in mind that I'm a newbie, but this seems more like an American RIS than an English version. The hops are definitely present and play a role in the flavor.  Too bad they named this great stout after an infamous fellow like Rasputin. They even put his ugly mug on the label.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Leaves a slight sticky lacing on the side of the glass.  S - After letting it sit for a few minutes, a nice coffee, chocolate smell is really present. I've got a good feeling about this beer already!  T - Yes! What a big, robust stout. Coffee, expresso, choclate and burnt malts are the predominate flavors. Nice ending that is bitter but not off-putting. The longer this brew warms up, the more the flavors come out. The 9% alcohol is well disguised.  M - Very creamy and thick but not syrupy. Good amount of carbonation. My pallet is overwhelmed with the combination of flavors.  D - An awesome stout! This is so robust that I can't call it a session beer by any means but that isn't a bad thing. This is just so good tasting that you don't want to rush through it.  Overall - Highly recommended. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. Reminds me a lot of the Black Chocolate Stout from Brooklyn Brewing that I reviewed a few days ago.

A - Pours pitch black, thin layer of tan coloured head, little retention and little lacing.  S - Milk chocolate, espresso, caramel, toffee and the slightest scent of cherries. Smells incredible.  T - This stuff is as close to chocolate milk as you can get in terms of beer. The milk chocolate shines through, and is followed by a generous serving of espresso beans that lingers on the tongue. The 9% ABV in incredibly well hidden, showing only the slightest amount of heat and sweetness. The coffee flavours definitely become more prominent as it warms.  M - A bit of a bite to it, likely due to the alcohol, but nice carbonation on the body which keeps it light, and it goes down smooth.  D - Normally with stronger brews like this, one would be enough for me. This, however, I could drink all night.

112,412,TheSteiny,4.36,"A- This brew is BLACK. I don't think it's possible to get much of any light through it. Poured a dark, syrup like brown with slightly thinner consistency. The head is something to be admired. A dark cream color. Very thick. Soft, creamy texture. Once you take a drink, it's not exactly going anywhere, either.  S- Can definitely smell the roasted tones, as well as what seems like some lighter, woody/nutty tones. Definitely has hints of the higher alcohol content present.  T- A wonderful mix of roasted maltiness, a touch of nut, and a bit of sweetness (akin to a dark chocolate) after swallowing, but before the aftertaste fully kicks in. Aftertaste retains the roast, yet has a hint of what feels like a touch of hopiness.  M- Very smooth, yet lacks the ""creamy"" the head had suggested. Carbonation has been kept low, but feels like it's at just the right level to add a comfortable bite. Has some characteristic weight, but nothing excessive.  D- As others have said, this is not a session brew simply because of the alcohol content. The four pack it comes in is sufficient for 2 people to enjoy without losing sight of the high points of the beer.

112,412,Cheesemoose,4.44,"Poured one into my Duvel tulip.  Midnight black, no light is getting through this one. Mocha head with a good few fingers, though it dissipates into a fine film. A little clinging as it settles out.  Dark chocolate cherries on the nose with a bit of mocha coffee flavor in the background. Roasted malts and a nice creamy character. No alcohol aromas what so ever. Impressive.  Starts with a strong bitterness, though it mellows into the chocolate/cherry flavors that slowly becomes a coffee finish. intriguing and complex, though not so much that one would want to leave this merely as a dessert or digestif. This one could easily accompany a strong meal, or even a pasta dish as the savor flavor would play off the acidity of the tomato sauce.  A lot of residual flavor, settles on the tongue, and after a few minuties, you feel prepared for another go. Alcohol is nonexistent throughout. Outstanding.

Finishes with that classic roasted note and also combined with a fairly strong earthy and leafy hop presence.

Initial smell yields aromas of oak/nutty undertones, with a kind of musty coffee and chocolate theme. There was minimal forward taste, and the beer has a quick, sharp aftertaste. There is a smooth coffee flavor, that has a balanced bitterness throughout the beer, but the flavor is short-lived. It truly seems to skip from the initial flavor straight to aftertaste. It does leave a strong, thick residue on the glass, which goes well with the strength of a stout.

The lacing makes lovely circles of sediment down my glass that look like the Grand Canyon.  S - rich honey malts and caramelized apples. After warming some fig smells came out. Simple smells, yes. But it just makes you feel good.  T - foretastes are of sweet malts and caramel but also deep roasted malts. They cooked this one a fair amount and left it on the pot maybe too long. It tastes a bit like burnt wort It's got a bitterness to it that can't be all due to hops. But that's just the middle, it comes around at the end with and aftertaste is mildly savory; oaky and sweet at the same time.  M - crystalline head tickles the tounge while the creamy milky textures massages the throat. Very smooth.  D - bitterness aside this is s great beer. Would go fantastically with a meaty stew or a turkey dinner. A hearty English style beer of this magnitude really needs some hearty pub food to go with it. Potatoes, sausage, tons of gravy.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,bboelens,3.83,"Had on tap at world of beer, poured into a pint glass  A- Dark dark brown, bordering on black, with huge head that lasts, a menacing Rasputin looks as though he is either about to karate chop me or make the sign of the cross on the glass.  S- Heavy chocolate presence, malts and coffee as well  T- Chocolate, coffee, very bitter, overall a good taste with a stingy finish.  M- Bites and stings the tongue in a good way, carbonation and the bitterness come into play heavily here.  D- With a high ABV this is definitely not a session beer, but overall it makes for a beer that everyone should try at least once.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Bouleboubier,4.95,"My first sampling of this coincided with my chance discovery of Monk's Cafe in Philly. At the time (2003-2004), I was living in Center City, piss poor, and longing for good beer. One fine day, riding my bike around in explorer mode, I found myself coming up upon the unmistakable awning and neon sign for said cafe - got little money, but let's do it. I'm desperate! - This may have been the very first time in my life I had been presented with a beer menu, the content of which I wasn't familiar with 90-95% of. Looking to cheaper and more interesting sounding beers, I ordered one Rasputin to go (at about $7 or $9, if I remember right). So off I go on my bike back up 16th st to my studio apt, giddy with delight or delightfully giddy. Get home - and I can't recall actually pouring it - and I find myself eying up one intimidating pint of darkness. The rest is...you know.  Old Rasputin will make a man out of you (Rip Van Winkle, for one). Always pours with an explosive, swelling head, big and busty, and the perfect shade of ash and gravel. Scummy, sparkling lacing. The liquid is impenetrably black - a charred void. Black death. The aroma hits you instantaneously, even from a foot or more away. More of a Baltic Porter scent than a bitter, dry stout. What I get is dark chocolate cake dipped in dark chocolate, mellow espresso, grain just lightly singed, and wafting among these scents, a faint grassy/piney hop presence. Oh, and a clean, vodka-like alcohol aroma, more and more as it warms. Flavor-wise, I'm not sure what you can improve upon, considering the style and imagery conjured up by the namesake of the beer. Cold and black. A sultry bitterness - by way of hops, dark chocolate, and dark malt. Velvety smooth feel and vague molasses character, with surprisingly potent fruitiness and almost citrus hop flavors as it warms. While this doesn't need to warm up much to express its fabulous complexities, the alcohol makes itself quite apparent in the aftertaste and feel past a certain degree. Once in awhile, this can be somewhat off-putting. For the most part, you really want this though. Carbonation, at its levels, is ideal and maintains excitement on the tongue - never any cloying sweetness or heavy feeling. That, and the warm prick of ethyl, round out an expertly crafted brew. So difficult to put this into perspective...when you've had 2 or 3.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,emmasdad,4.05,"Been wanting to pick this one up again for awhile now, but I always pass it by for something else, figuring it'll be there next time. And it always is. My mistake, as this is probably one of the best imperial stout values out there.  Poured a deep, dark brown, nearly black, with a little tan head. Aromas of bitter dark chocolate, roasted malt and coffee. On the palate, full bodied, with flavors of dark chocolate, espresso, earthy hops and roasted malt.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,EwaldEichstaett,4.53,"Appears pitch black, weak brown head... however, it laces decent.  Smell is dominated by bitter-sweat chocolate. After letting it warm a few minutes one begins to notice fig or plum like fruit notes.  The taste is a creamy dark roasted delight. Sweet chocolate flavours are most prevalent. I appreciate that there is also a bit of hop presence at the end.  The beer is cream and smooth in the mouth. It is medium bodied and has a nice bitter finish. The after-taste is a nice dark chocolate residue.  This beer is very drinkable and affordable. It certainly gives you more bang for your buck the the Surly Darkness which I so desired...

112,412,Kylito87,4.17,Ok the moment I have been working for Review # 50 lol I know I am still a n00b but it is a big milestone for me. So I figured I would do one of my all time favorite beers that I haven't got around to reviewing.  Appearance- Midnight black with toffee colored head. Rediculous lacing and a craggy foamy head head that stays the whole entire way through.  Smell- Rich dark chocolate and coffee with a bold roasted dark malt character. There is a hint caramel and sweet fruit as well.  Taste- Expresso with a nice dark chocolate finish. The beer has nice bold roasty coffee kick up front and it is finishes with a bitter sweet chocolate.  Mouthfeel- Super thick. Very syrupy with a very prominant carbonation level. This beer is very slick and oily on the pallete. It makes your lips stick together. Very heavy beer. It would only take a couple of these before you couldn't drink anymore. Definitely a meal in glass.  Drinkability- Well like I said 2 maybe 3 and that is about it. These are so good that it is a beer that I like to take my time and savor every drop. I can never walk away from this beer it has been one of my all time favorites for a very long time. I would love to get a couple of these wax the necks over and lay them down for a year maybe two and see how it matures. Bottom line it is amazing try it.,North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,mikeg67,4.48,"12 oz bottle. Pours black with a thick, brown, long lasting head. Aroma is of coffee, chocolate, dry fruit, molasses, and roasted malt. Taste is similar to the aroma.

112,412,cetherid,4.6,"poured into a tulip.  A.  beer is a nice dark black color. head is frothy brown and leaves a lot of lacing.  S.  big roasted notes of coffee and chocolate. I'm getting some slight dark fruit in there like raisins. Smell isn't overwhelming but noticeable  T.  roasted coffee...some dark chocolate in there with a little sweetness and a nice little bite of bitterness finishes it off. A great tasting beer.  M.  about full bodied. a nice amount of carbonation. a little tingle on the tongue from carbonation and bitterness.  D.  very high. probably the standard in Imperial Stouts. Not many things bad with this beer. It's nothing I'd spend my life savings on, but I can see myself grabbing a 4pack of this once a month. The price and availability make it very high as well.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,FanofHefe,4.05,"Poured from bottle into tulip. Dark black in color with a dark tan one finger head. Dissipates fairly quickly leaving a little lacing.  Nice aroma of sweet dark fruit, and roasted malt. Not overpowering and only a hint of alcohol.  Tasty flavors of coffee, chocolate, roasted malt blend well in this brew. A just a hint of alcohol that reminds me of bourbon or brandy.  Goes down pretty easy for the abv. I really like that this is a highly rated beer that seems to be highly available.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,JizackFH,4.46,"A - Black. had a nice big frothy tan head on it that left very good lacing on the glass.  S - Smells of dark chocolate, coffee, roasty, a little grainy, and there is a touch of alcohol present.  T - Very roasty, with notes of chocolate and coffee. The finish is bitter, but just the right amount of bitterness. The alcohol is present in the taste, but it's not overwhelming by any means.  M - The mouthfeel is great. Its a full bodied beer, but it isn't as thick as I thought it would be. It has good carbonation, and it also has a creamy quality to it.  D - This is a very drinkable beer. It goes down very smooth, and it leaves you wanting more after every sip. I love this beer, it is absolutely a great RIS. It is very drinkable, even with the 9% ABV. I definitely recommend this one, it is one of my favorite beers for sure. Great job North Coast. Cheers.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,VelvetExtract,4.56,"A-Looks perfect. Deep, dark black with a hint of brown around the edges. Excellent frothy head that refuses to die.  S-Big roasty, coffee, dark chocolate notes. Detecting some hops as well. Black licorice. Burnt malts and a slight hint of alcohol.  T-Quite the individual taste; and a very strong taste at that. Surprising amount of bitterness which I am a fan of. Coffee, rich chocolate, dried fruits, licorice. Roasted and burnt. Light whiskey flavor. Finishes bitterrrrrr.  M-Not as thick as I was expecting. Not disappointed, but definitely surprised. Long bitterness, like the Siberian Winter, yeah!  D-A big beer. One of the more drinkable stouts I've tried considering my limited experience with the style.  Deserving of the high praise. And a pretty good deal too.

112,412,haazer,4,"Poured into my swashbuckle brewing pintglass.  A- Cola black looking appearance. Good effervescense as you can hear the carbonation and bubbles hitting the surface. Tan head, banishes faster than I'd like it to.  S- Molasses, and flavored coffee. Mostly hazelnut. A combination of nutty and fruity aroma's make a presence.  T- One of the most unique tasting stouts I've ever had. The biggest difference in this beer, to me, is almost a berry flavor. Never have I had a fruit taste come through in a stout. Another flavor that seems to be uncommon is mint. Dark chocolate and expresso/coffe shine. Upon further drinking those two are the most dominant flavors. Malts are present, I think malts are becoming my favorite ingredient in beer.  M- Medium bodied. Coffee mouthfeel, hard to explain because a cold coffee doesn't taste like this.  D- A good stout. High abv, well masked, many unigue flavors. I feel llke this was modeled off of coffee and they threw in some flavors your not used to for a stout. They work good, but theres nothing thats ground breaking with this. Recommended, but not world class.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Biffster,4.4,"Pours deep black, with just a touch of garnet at the edges. A low tan head just barely persists at the edge of the glass.  The aroma? Where to start... Deep roasty burnt espresso and dark chocolate predominate, but there is plenty of inviting supporting players like dark cherry, caramel, currant, raisin and fruitcake. The list goes on and on. There is a mild to moderate earthy hop aroma and a touch of spiciness.  The flavor is every bit as fun and complex. It starts with a touch of dark malt that quickly surrenders to the bitterness of strong coffee and unsweetened chocolate. Hop flavor and bitterness is substantial and the swallow is warming and complex. The finish is a nice lingering melange of toasty maltiness, dark Christmas fruits, and a substantial lingering bitterness from both the hops and the roast malt.  The mouthfeel is full and coating, with a moderate carbonation level that helps to counter the body a bit. There is some alcohol warming, but it is not harsh.  A classic example of the style. Well made. This is big and bold and complex, but balanced.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,verge,4.36,"You mean you haven't tried this yet? Shame on you.  Pours black as night. Not quite as motor oil-ish as, say, Victory Storm King, but you won't find much darker than this. Held up to light, I see no ruby on the edges of the glass. Just black.  I like this beer too much at this point to take time to smell it. Sorry.  Taste - Burnt chocolate. Hey, I don't have the most developed palette, but dang. I taste dark chocolate. I taste espresso. I taste something burnt...but in a good way. I don't like burnt toast but I sure as hell like whatever is in this brew.  Mouthfeel - ooh so thick and so satisfying.  Drinkability - well, nothing's perfect I guess. This beer is SO good. But the 9% alcohol is evident, no way around it. Two of these in a night and I'm done. I tend to stop at one. No need for more. My mouth thinks I just smoked a cigar. Except in the morning, it won't still feel icky.  On the positive side, it keeps me from drinking too much. There is enough enjoyment in one bottle of Old Rasputin to last an hour.

112,412,Kinsman,4.1,"Surprised to see that I had no review listed for Old Raspy, so here we go.  Really, an impressive looking stout with a perfectly black body. Crowned with a sticky coffee-with-cream colored head, about 3 fingers thick to start. Retention wasn't as much as I would have liked, but it still provided plenty of foamy stickiness and lace.  Aroma begins with a slightly grainy roasted aroma before sweeter chocolate scents come in. Plenty of coffee aromas to go along with this too.  Old Raspy is not as chocolate as some stouts but not as coffee flavored as some either. It seems to sit somewhere perfectly in between with a great balance of sweet, bitter, and roasted flavors.  Mouthfeel is medium-heavy and a bit chewy. Overall, this stout is one of the best widely available stouts, and you don't have to wait in line at 3am just to give it a try.

112,412,Morey,4.02,"My first run-in with this beer.  Pours an opaque pitch black with a frothy tan (leaning towards brown) head that leaves behind some impressive lace for a beer that weighs in @ 9%. Rings are forming around the inside of the glass with each sip.  Offers an aroma filled with burnt sugar and dark chocolate. Not in your face, but present and pleasant.  The taste is surprisingly smooth. Loads of hop flavor add to the richness of the barley making for a flavorful beer. The bitterness from the hops lingers on in the finish.  Full bodied silky-smooth mouthfeel.  For a beer that is so full of flavor, bitterness, and alcohol it goes down very easily.  Morey's Bottom Line: Have wanted to try this for a while. I'm not a stout guy, but I love sampling all kinds of styles. This is one tasty stout. I like it better than most others that I have tried.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

I have been going stout to stout looking for that one that just drops my jaw on the spot. this is it. Very roasted, rich, dark-type bitter flavor. a lot of breweries aim for this and screw it all up creating a bad bitter beer. North Coast brewing hit it dead on. Perfect type of bitter in a stout, no sour. The whole dark, slight coffee/chocolate thing.... spot on. out of the last dozen and a half or so stouts I've sampled this past summer, without question Old Rasputin takes the prize  It's 9%, and i've now had my fair share of them. I'm feeling quite fine. I have to say this is a much more enjjoyable feeling than other beers. The side effect is that you know you've drank them. they hit you, they hit you hard, you feel them in your gut. its like eating a loaf of bread that gets you drunk. i love this beer hah :D  Thank you Cheers wine and spirits in Chanhassen, MN for FINALLY stocking this.

112,412,LiquidCucumber,4.54,"A - Dark as a stout with a lovely looking tan head that reminds me of a chocolate malt.  S - Right up front with chalky malts that easily bleed into signature cocoa and coffee scents. Cocoa comes out more as it warms. Slight touch of booze.  T - Sweet, chalky and deeply roasted malts dominate the palate. The flavor of toast chocolate, coffee and sweet malts all come together for a perfect symphony of a beer.  M - Creamy and smooth with just the right amount of carbonation if not a little high for the style. The sweetness and a little bitterness stick around the palate to wreck any other flavors that may come after; make sure you have a good palate cleanser around!  D - If I didn't know better I could drink this as one of the only beers in my arsenal, and a pretty darn good deal at that!

S: Has a very sweet smell to it, chocolates and dark fruits seem to be present in the nose as well. Faint scents of roasted and caramel malts.  T: Has a bit of an alcohol taste up front, similar to the smell with a very sweet taste as well. The chocolates and dark fruits seem to hit the palate together. Roasted malts come alive in the finish.  M: Medium bodied with an average amount of carbonation. It is a little thick but also smooth.

You can almost smell bitter with chocolate and coffee and smoke...all things I like in a brew.  The taste is similar, with the chocolate and coffee, but the malts come thru on the palate.  There's a creaminess to it that you can't beat. It actually starts sweet before giving way to a nice bitter in the finish. Deep in the swallow, you'll pick up a gentle heat from the alcohol.

Poured with a 2 finger light toffee colored head that dropped to a thin coating. Good amount of blobby lacing.  S- Sweetened coffee, dark roasted malts, toffee, and some light floral hops.  T- Very much like the smell. Toffee, sweetened black coffee, dark malts, with a finish of floral hops which leaves a light bitter finish along with the coffee notes. Chocolate is also present at times. Some faint alcohol is detectable on the finish.  M- Very smooth and creamy. Medium bodied, but not dry. Some prickly carbonation.  D- Very high drinkability here.

112,412,ToAzwethinkweizm,4.47,"Reviewed on 5 November 2010.  Poured at 50 degrees F, appears dark chocolate brown out of the bottle, black in the glass. Poured into a Sierra Nevada XXX snifter, 2-finger soapy head that goes away quickly, lacing is average. Aroma is delicate, consisting of mostly roasted malts and a touch of coffee and caramel, followed by some hotness of alcohol.  I wait 5 minutes for this to warm up and settle. Out of nowhere comes intense dark chocolate aroma, more caramel, a touch of bread (like Guinness bread), all presenting themselves on a beautiful bed of super roasted malts. The taste explodes with super rich roasted coffee flavor. Maple and oak flavors make themselves known. If I had to associate any dark fruit flavor to this, it would have to be figs. The glass gets lower, and a slight maroon color appears in the beer. The flavor of roasted malts is so intense, the flavor doesn't escape my taste buds. Neither does the roasted coffee flavor.  I'm standing in front of a warm woodstove sipping this slowly, 3 ounces to go. Aroma of dried black cherry says 'hello' and the hotness of alcohol actually diminishes a little! Much less carbonation by now (which is fine!) and this beer gets a little bit sweeter and the roasted malts seem more developed in just one sitting. I only wish I had a second one to sip on.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,beerdrinker123,3.94,"This is one of the best looking beers I have seen, it pours an obsidian black, 100% opaque with rich amount of creamy tan head, pretty dark colored head. Every sip leaves a thick coated rim on the pint glass.  You can smell roasted malts and there is a lingering nutty coffee aroma that is pretty subtle, nothing special here, but still solid. Flavor wise, it has a roasted coffee taste with some hints of brown sugar. The aftertaste is bitter and nutty. Its very smooth and creamy, but also pretty filling. Just enough carbonation to balance the smoothness and alcoholic kick this beer packs.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,MBPChead,5,"I have been wanting to try this one for quite some time, and I recently received a bottle from a friend. So lets jump right into this one.  Look: Opaque black body with a creamy coffee head with good retention and lacing. Simply beautiful  Smell: Immediately gives off the scents of rich medium roasted coffee/coffee ice cream, rich dark chocolate, toasted wheat and bread, roasted nuts, oak, vanilla, and a very slight hint of red wine. Marvelous aroma.  Taste: WOW, the first thing I get is Coffee, coffee, and more coffee. Although its pretty obvious, coffee is the dominating flavor in this brew, but the coffee does allow the flavors of dark chocolate, charred oak, vanilla, toasted bread and nuts to seep into the taste. Its big and malty up front with the perfect amount of hop bitterness at the finish and a nice amount of warmth form the alcohol, and gives off a slight flavor of red wine and orange rinds. Simply Delicious  Mouthfeel: Its thick, smooth, has the perfect on tongue sensation/level of carbonation, and is warm going down. It feels wonderful going down.  Drinkability: Too drinkable, I would have No Problem having a 4 pack of these all in one night. The flavor, texture, and consistency of this stout are downright incredible.

It pours a nice onyx topped by a finger of light tan/dark ecru foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, toasted rye bread, pumpernickel, and a light flash of molasses. The taste is nearly identical, though heavier on the roasted malts. The body is a stolid medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a somewhat thick and chewy feel.

112,412,DelMontiac,4.48,"Not that this beer needs another review, but it's great practice and I really love this beer. I've had this beer many times. I think it requires several tries to really appreciate it. I poured this into an imperial pint glass. I like to pour this beer pretty fast and rough for a bigger head creating the best nose and lace.  Appearance: Gotta love the deep black/brown darkness. Like a blackhole, no light escapes. A slightly fast, rough pour produces the best head - luxurious deep cappuccino color with a texture that reminds me of...I don't know...cappuccino or latte foam or maybe something I'd love to sleep on, hehe. Lacing is left with each sip producing a consistent scalelike pattern.  Aroma: Dark, nearly burnt malts and very dark chocolates with a hint of hops peeking through. Burnt smores anyone?  Taste: The taste buds get a shock at first, but they soon calm down and allow you to savor the dark roast coffee and cocoa bean flavors. Burn/carmelized brown sugar comes to mind as well. Hops are not present until the finish. It's Halloween (CST), so I popped a couple of Hershey's minis near the end of the glass - heavenly.  Mouthfeel: Heavenly. Not syrupy and not sticky, but smooth and silky like hot chocolate.  Drinkability: I never drink more than one of these in a sitting. Just makes no sense unless you need two to make it through that big juicy T-bone.  Overall: Old Rasp is just perfect with a grilled medium/medium rare T-bone or ribeye - any red meat with nice marbeling.

112,412,iskivolkl,4.36,"The appearance is great. It is a deep black color with a nice thick brown head. Head was about an inch thick immediately following the pour, head retention could be slightly improved, but all in all a stellar appearance.  The smell is good, Lots of dark-roasted malt smell, not much hoppyness, not detecting a lot of anything else.  At first sip it's mostly just dark malt with a strong coffee aftertaste. Taking a larger swig (and a little more time) there is a fairly strong fruity presence followed by a lingering bitter coffee aftertaste.  The beer is surprisingly less viscous than you might think. It's not strongly carbonated and this imparts a watery feel on the tongue.  Overall drinkability is good. Even if you're not usually one for stouts, it's definitely worth a taste. Works well as a stand-alone or dessert beer when one has lots of time to digest and dissect the different flavors.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Daktyls,4.3,"A: Pours a pitch black color with a two finger head with such thick tiny bubbles that it isn't going anyway. The brew has been sitting for a good 5 minutes and the head hasn't changed at all.  S: Smells of dark chocolates, dark roasted malts and some coffee aromas.  T: Very complex taste. The roasted malts give a pleasant bitterness to the beer, while the aftertaste is full of darker fruits as well as the coffee overtones and some sweeter chocolate notes.  M: Feels very nice on the tongue, a medium bodied beer with a low amount of carbonation, after swallowing you can definitely feel the alcohol on the back of your throat.

This is the standard for what a RIS should look like. S - Dark roasted malt, dry cocoa powder and dark dried fruits (raisins, prunes and figs) with a bit of alcohol. D - Very dark roasted (almost burnt) malt dominates, along with more dark cocoa powder. Expresso roast coffee, raisins and vanilla are in there, too. Quite a bitter finish, and there's definitely some alcohol to be found, but that fades dramatically as it warms up. M - Creamy, medium-heavy body with low carbonation.

S: Dark fruit, alcohol, brown sugar/molasses (?), coffee/roasted malt. In that order.  T/M: Viscosity is as predicted under ""appearance."" It coats the palate and leaves a coffee-like bitterness for an aftertaste. Also gives a warming sensation on swallowing, like good whiskey. Has a brown sugar- or molasses-like sweetness up front, and the dark fruit from the aroma hits between that sweetness and the bitter aftertaste. Carbonation is present and adds a bit of acidity, but does little to cut the viscosity.  D: Very drinkable, to the point of being deceptive.

Sweet overall, with a slightly bitter coffee finish. Some slight alcohol is noticed as it warms.  Mouthfeel- smooth and creamy, but this actually a bit lighter than I was anticipating.

This is black beer that has a sandy colored head which very slowly recedes and leaves some nice lacing.  Smell: Dark roasted malts, coffee and chocolate. I can also pick up the alcohol.  Taste: So complex. A pleasant bitterness from the roasted malts. The choco/coffee flavors linger in the middle with a long pleasant bitter finish. As it warms, a slight sweetness emerges with a hint of vanilla.  Mouthfeel: The body is just right for the style. The carbonation lifts the drinker above some of the bitterness.  Drinkability: It would be hard to drink more than three of these in a sitting, but I certainly would try.

112,412,bohemiandonut,4.15,"Perhaps the most interesting aspect of reviewing for me is returning to a beer after a long period of sampling other standouts in the style. RIS is an especially portent style for such revision, with its massive complexity and depth. On to Rasputin in a snifter, after nearly a year of mostly Stone, Ten Fidy, and any other barreled/double stouts to come my way.  Pours slick and creamy, a darkly tan head swirling about on top. Booze is apparent in the smell, something I may be in the minority for liking. Other than that it's all roasty coffee/chocolate goodness, with powerful bursts of fruit, some licorice, and possibly oak/vanilla. A great scent that I am not too patient to surrender for a taste.  My first thought is: too bubbly. A few swirls to kick this back and I'm met with a smoother vehicle in which to glean these flavors. I am instantly reminded of Sam Smith, but that fruity, roasted malt profile so prevalent in his beers has been pumped up and rounded out considerably here with chocolate and coffee notes.  I get an occasional twang of metal as well, but also oatmeal, pepper, milk and bitter hops. Hops push through the finish in a way some will love but is kind of distracting for me. This hop character creates a certain dryness and the beer stays rather thin for its abv. The alcohol is not masked as well as the best in class manage and I think the bitterness factor adds to this.  If you like the English style stouts and enjoy a bitter RIS this will be right up your alley. A great deal for a 4-pack but not entirely satisfying to my palette. More coffee and sugar, please.  EDIT: Bumping up the taste and mouthfeel dimensions as this beer really comes into its own as it warms. Sweeter and richer.

112,412,bbkd3b,4.08,"I've been looking forward to this one for a while. So, I bought a bottle, yanked my pint glass from the cabinet, and started the great routine.  A - Pours a darker-than-night black, with no light getting through at all. A nice, caramel-colored head sustained for a decent time before leaving a scattered amount sitting at the top... The lacing sort of dropped down, but a great looking beer, really.  S - Wow... lots of really nice scents. Mostly espresso, along with caramel and toffee.... some dark chocolate and a slight booziness are there, too, but not at the front of things. Welcoming.  T - Wait... where did that berry-like start come from? It wasn't in the nose at all! Don't know, but it didn't last long, as the aforementioned espresso took control of the show. Nice, sweet, and bitter all at once. Seriously, it tastes like berries dipped in mocha. Nice combinations. Finish is clean, along with the aftertaste of coffee. Goes down easy... tiniest hint of alcohol.  M - Nice, creamy body with a really warming finish. This is a great beer for winter, and Missouri is starting to cool down... so, yeah, I'll welcome that. Carbonation was a bit too sharp for a beer in this style, I think.  D - It tastes really good, but I never considered imperials to be very drinkable brews... especially the heavier ones. 9% ABV ensures that a couple will be a good bet for relaxed nights.  Overall/notes: I've heard a lot about this beer, and all positive. Doesn't really disappoint! I once had this... It was a long time ago, before I had any sort of experience with stouts, and ""good"" beer was a relatively new experience. Couldn't stand it.

Currants, bittersweet chocolate, with toasty malts and a wonderful bitter finish. I seemed to notice some bourbon layers in the finish as well.

Dark and sinister looking, the rough-textured mocha-colored head sits atop the black body like a Russian fur cap. The bottle art featuring a drawing of Rasputin doesn't hurt the overall effect either. Lacing is full and sticky.  The scent is of a distinctly toasted, malty quality. A yeastiness also meets the nose. The big scent is followed up by an even bigger flavor. Thick malts, yeast, burnt coffee and an exceptionally sticky mouthfeel combine to create a hearty drinking experience.

The first taste packs a punch and dares you to take a second. I find a taste reminiscent of a smooth espresso drink. I have to admit, the alcohol taste is quite strong in this drink for me. I would really approve of the taste more if I couldn't taste the alcohol so much.  As I drank, the head stuck to the sides of the glass, which, in my opinion, shows character in a beer. Even as I finish the beer, I see where the head started at the top of the glass.  I have to admit, I'm still lacking in the smell department. I don't get the subtle hints that everyone else mentions.

The aromas were the traditional cocoa nibs and coffee with a hint of sweet caramel and bourbon in the back.

The alcohol is hidden well for the ABV to be as high as it is.  M- Definitely creamy moderately thick mouthfeel.  D- My favorite RIS.

112,412,ncfranklin,4.62,"A : Pitch black with a great two finger brown foam head. Lacing is nice. This is the expected appearance of a famous RIS. It pours with a milky look to it.  S : Chocolate dominates the nose, but roasted malt, coffee, and notes of vanilla hide beneath. I'm not detecting a bit of hops.  T : Ah, there are the bitter hops. They tend to tussle with a burnt roasted malt flavor before succumbing to coffee, chocolate and sugar. It's a bit overbearing how many things are mixing here to create a unique flavor, nothing ever takes the reigns. The finish gets a final bite of bitter hope with a burnt note.  As the beer warms lots of things change. The hop profile fades almost completely as a sweet malt takes over with almost a chocolate milkness to it.  M : Thick and slick, nice to slosh around and roll over each taste bud.  D : Lives up to the reputation. Scarily drinkable at a 9%, but a meal all in itself.  A must.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

This is a really good beer for the price and it can be found pretty much anywhere.  A- Poured into my Stone Russian Imp St. glass. Poured it hard to give it a 2"" head. It hung around for a bit and then turned into a thick lacing for the rest of the drink.  s- smell is decent. Roasted malts and a pinch of coffee.  T- In my mind it tastes just like a good imp stout should. Strong taste of dark roasted malts. Somewhat bitter finish, but like a smooth coffee. Can't taste the Alcohol, which at 9% that is pretty good.  M- thick and creamy, but not too thick. Real nice.  D- Very good for the style. I could have 2 of these in a sitting. I would have a fat buzz though becuase I am feeling it a little after one.  Well done North Coast.

112,412,RDHerm,4.07,"Pours an incredibly deep and dark brown, so murky that no light gets through. Has a thick, coffee brown head that has excellent lacing. It thins out after a while, but it remains solid throughout.  An unexpectedly weak aroma. Some notes of coffee, roasted malts, and dark chocolate, but there's not too much going on here.  Strong taste of roasted malts, with hints of coffee, bitter chocolate, and hops. Starts out sweet and rich, with a nice hoppy bitterness to the finish. There is also the slightest bit of alcohol warmth.  Medium/heavy in body. Exceptionally smooth and doesn't dry out the palate too much like a lot of stouts, but a little too much carbonation keeps it from being perfect.  Great taste, nice finish, and not terribly heavy, just make sure the alcohol content doesn't catch up with you.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Nearly pitch black color with a very pretty 2 finger tan head that unfortunately doesn't last too long. Makes a surprising amount of lacing for a 9% abv beer.  S: Fails to deliver what I expect for an RIS. I get dark roasted malt and a little chocolate.  T&M: Above and beyond the smell.

Balanced bitterness from hops and chocolate to even out a sweet malt and barely explosion. Thick enough to savor but thin enough to drink a few. You already know the flavors to expect here, chocolate, burnt malt, some coffee notes, etc. It's a Russian imperial stout, but this one is delivered just flawlessly. Sure many have more flavor or some more interesting flavor combination. That comes down to taste and well this is far from my personal favorite, but this one executes in a way few can.  There's a touch more alcohol in this than I'd like and I could go for a touch more body, but it's certainly not needed. The carbonation in this is great.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

I get lots of bitter chocolate. It's kinda like chocolate espresso. There's also a touch of anise that shows itself again in the taste. Taste really resembles the aroma. Chocolate seems a bit sweeter on the tongue than in the nose. There's an additional hint of cherries in the flavor. A bit too much carbonation and I'd rather see it slightly thicker, but that's getting a little nitpicky.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,tewaris,4.02,"9% ABV 75 IBUs 12 oz bottle with no freshness date poured into a big snifter. Although, I am big supporter of bottle dating, I don't criticize North Coast in deeming dating Old Rasputin irrelevant, because it will hold up for years, and yet won't be ""too hot & rough"" fresh. This is one of my earliest, but still favorite, Russian Imperial Stouts and I am very excited to review this! Let's get down to business!  Appearance 5/5 Pours in a clear and very dark brown stream from the bottle that gives an impression of pitch black in the glass, with a big, dense, dark mocha colored head that receded into a rather thin one but left excellent lacing on the glass. Towards the end, the head was thinner, but still was much more than a tiny collar! The lacing didn't stick around, but that's forgivable for an Imperial Stout.  Aroma 3/5 I have never been a fan of this beer's aroma even though I have had it at innumerable occasions and I like this beer quite a bit overall. The aroma I detect is of sweet malts with no particular character, but just a slight bias towards roast. It has a certain smoothness to it though. As the beer got to room temperature, alcoholic sweetness became obvious.  Taste 4/5 Taste is however, very good, so you may ignore my comments on aroma. Starts slightly sweet with a dark, roasty, richness that takes a dark chocolate character in the aftertaste, along with the persistent roast. Also, they have hopped this one generously, and the finish is quite bitter; the roast and hops make it quite clean for an Imperial Stout. A coffee like acidity is notable as the temperature rises. So is alcohol warmth.  Mouthfeel 4/5 More body and lower carbonation would be welcome. Otherwise, it's flawless.  Drinkability 5/5 It tastes good, and finishes fairly clean. I could have another bottle. A RIS that's any more drinkable is doing it wrong!  Other Never disappointing, amazingly priced, this is a beer I will continue to drink. Never say die!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,jj311,4.41,"I had the pleasure of tasting this beer for my first time. I will say that this brew is not for the faint of heart or for 'amateur' beer drinkers. If you are a big fan of mainstream beers, lagers, pale ales, and so on, then I'd suggest finding some way to sample it before purchasing if at all possible. If you appreciate a nice thick stout, this one should definitely be on your list.  Pouring it from bottle to glass, the first thing I noticed was the brilliant jet-black color topped with a thick, tan, and frothy foam head not unlike that of a cappuccino. Holding it up to the light, very little light managed to penetrate through this darkness.  The Aroma is something i can only describe as sweet and roasty. It seems to have subtle but distinctive essences of dark chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, molasses, and alcohol.  The taste was pleasantly enjoyable with a variety of flavors. A rich balance of roasted malt, coffee, dark chocolate, and a bitter hoppy taste that surprisingly compliments the other flavors.  A nice thick mouthfeel and a warm finish.  I wasn't disappointed at all in my decision to b uy this.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,jamex,4.28,"Bought a four-pack. $7.99 in San Diego.  Poured a nice near-black caramel with a nice but short lived head.  Smells of roasty malt, dark chocolate, espresso, and vanilla. As it warms I'm catching a whiff of something bourbon-like....maybe just the alcohol reacting with all the other characters.  Taste is similar to smell. I'm getting a little bit of hoppiness as well and the usual Imperial Stout characteristics. Alcohol sneaks up on you a bit.  A very drinkable stout. As I finish this one I'm contemplating grabbing another. Very tasty burps.  Glad I tried this beer - the 4-pack won't last long.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Naugros,3.92,"Near black and served in a North Coast Brewery Old Rasputin nonic glass. One of the weirdest heads I've seen on a stout. It was light brown and not particularly thick, but there were spots of tan making differently sized splotches...sort of like a rash. Odd. The lace was thin and spotty without much coverage. Maybe it was their tap lines or the tap itself.  The only difference between the smell of this RIP is that I didn't detect a ton of coffee or chocolate. It was mostly roasty toasty. Not a bad thing, but not all that complex.  The taste was nearly identical to the nose in taste. A little spice in the bitterness entered into the equation, but not strongly, even when colder than it should have been. It didn't back off as it warmed, but stayed at a nice level.  This was a bit thin for a RIP. I don't want to say watery, because it wasn't. It had the body of an Irish stout, even being incredibly smooth.  With the light body and toned down bitterness this is one of the easiest drinking RIPs I've ever had, which is dangerous...check out that abv and you'll know why. You really don't sense much of the alcohol in this.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

T: like the nose a combination of coffee, roastiness, and chocolate flavors strike first alongside oats with a bit of booze that finishes off hoppy bitter.  M: The was full in body with a moderate amount of carbonation which had a roasty, sweet, slight astringent, boozy, and sticky finish.

Smell - Typical russian stout, alcohol, malts, barly, hops and spices  Taste - Smoooth and tasty, old rasp is a classic. Stout coffee mixed with spices and hops, makes one smooth beer. I really enjoy the nut flavor aftertaste. I think the malts in this beer is what makes it orignal and tastly  Mouthfeel - For being so strong, i never get palette overload, tounge doesnt numb.

112,412,aquaphiliac,4.26,"The beer pours a jet black liquid; impenetrable by light. The head is a nice coffee color, about an inch right up to the edge of my pint glass. The head retention is excellent and the lacing on the side of the glass leads down to a creamy top of the beer even when almost gone.  The aroma is a big mix of dark chocolate and malt upfront with some mild hoppy scents on the back end. Thick smell that sticks in your nostrils; very inviting.  Like the smell, there's lots of dark chocolate and roasted malt taste that dominate here. Some hoppiness is detectable and there is a very faint kick of alcohol in the aftertaste. Overall not a bitter taste (in fact somewhat sweet) but there is some bitterness on the back end. Complex throughout; definitely tastes like a BIG beer.  Not too heavy on the palate for an Imperial Stout; consistency is less thick than oil but certainly thicker than a normal stout. Compliments the chocolate taste quite nicely.  Not highly drinkable; it too me around 15 minutes to finish a glass but those 15 minutes were delicious.  Paid $8.99 for a 4-pack.

The taste is pretty darn good. Defiantly one of the better Imperial Stouts out there. Its complex, but not too much. Subtle hints in chocolate are there and then gone and it leaves you with a warn alcohol taste.

The initial taste of the brew was that of roasted barley, chocolate, light coffee and caramel, as well as alcohol. The alcohol was noticeable, but did not detract from the quality of the present flavors. The beer was a bit creamy and had a full body with light to medium carbonation.

112,412,CascadeConan,3.95,"As you would expect the beer is opaque with a decent tan head that leaves a bit of lacing as you go.  The nose is full of chocolate, roasted malts, coffee, sweet toffee and a bit of smoke.  The taste differs greatly from some of the bigger stouts I've been drinking lately, a whole lot of burnt grains and hops up front mellowing through the chocolate and coffee with a warm, dry finish. Lots of big flavors going on, huge role played by the hops (75 IBUs) in this stout along with the grains to make this deliciously bitter but the body remains fairly thin for 9% ABV, not as velvety as you would hope.  Verdict? Great stout, this had a lot of hype behind it and for the most part it lived up to all I counts and was a divergence from my expectations which made this a whole lot more interesting to drink.

This beer has so many flavors: dark chocolate, strong espresso, malt, black coffee, nuts, and toffee and even a hint of the Holy Lord himself. There is also a strong hop bitterness that really works to balance everything out but doesn't overtake the beer which is truly a blessing.

Whenever the mood strikes for something rich, dark, creamy, and with enough alcohol in it to relax for the night, I head over.  The beer arrives with a body that is pitch black topped with a immaculate tan head. The smell is more roasty than anything with a subtle malty sweetness you can pick up. You are unlikly to make it through the head on the first sip, but don't let that dissuade you... The head itself is a treat being insanely smooth with a much lighter feel to it while keeping the notes of chocolate, roast and malt that await in the beer proper. Savor the sips of Old Ras because on tap it is candy. You will finish a glass without thinking about it, and with everybody else doing the same it might not be long before the keg kicks.

Carbonation? - I'll let someone with night goggles decipher that.  S: Chocolate and prunes dominate the nose on this one.  T: Chocolate, licorice, with cinnamon. For some reason, I always taste cinnamon on the end of a great RIS. It starts to get fruitier the more I drink it, and the finish is mildly dry, but not too. The balance is RASPUTINTASTIC!

Not exactly, you can see through ruby-colored glass if you try hard enough. Quite impressive is the head that is created, a dirty ivory that squirms like its alive. A fine sticky lace has formed even before the first sip.  Hmm, interesting aroma. Sweetness is the first thing I encounter, scrambled with dates, prunes, and malty alcohol. Roastiness abounds. Also, an unfortunate amount of metallic twinges.  An amazingly carbonated hoppiness greets you initially, then follows the gulpingly thick sweet mass of Stoutitude. The mouthfeel is right on, thick enough to back up the huge amounts of alcohol, but light enough to allow carbonation to cut through the mess. The hops aren't out of control on this one, but quite noticible for the style. Like many stouts, your mouth is left with puddles of sourness on the beers' way down, but in this case it cloaks the alcohol perfectly.

112,412,DoubleSimcoe,4.4,"Old Raspy coming out of a nitro-tap at Bodega in Columbus, Ohio.  Appearance: Creamy, shiny, very dark and opaque. A good-size head that remains. Incredible lacing that hugs and coats the glass.  Smell: Milk, roastiness, chicory.  Taste: More malts and some coffee followed by a gentle bitterness.  Mouthfeel: The nitro creaminess is present throughout. Full body despite the smoothness, though. A pleasant throat burn and a bitterness that lingers. A little filling.  Drinkability: Good but not great. I love this beer but I wouldn't have lots of it. The nitro presentation is my favorite- much better than a bottle (which is a little harsh) and regular draft.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,nataku00,4.13,"A 12 oz bottle poured into a tulip. Pitch black beer with a finger of brown, dense head. Head retention is impressive for a stout as it does not dissipate from the initial pour for a good 10 minutes, even when taking a sip. A little carbonation can be seen at the surface of the glass, but it's hard to see due to how black this beer is.  Nose is dark roasted and caramel malts, with a little dark chocolate as well. You can almost taste the beer, with how thickly the aroma of the beer coats your nose after taking a big sniff from the glass.  Taking a sip, the dark roasted malts are there. Not as bitter as I had expected, and the flavor transforms as you warm the beer in your mouth, as the malt sweetens slightly and finishes almost like a warm cup of semisweet cocoa. As it warms further, there is a little expresso at the back of the throat accompanying a little bit of alcohol.  Really rich, full bodied beer, requiring small sips so that you can really enjoy how the beer's taste transforms as it reacts to the heat of your body.  The Old Rasputin would be an enjoyable introduction to RIS style for people looking to graduate from regular stouts. A good tasting beer with an enjoyable aroma and mouth feel.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,drizzam,4.5,"A - This stuff pours with an opaque BLACK body...nice and dark. My pour wasn't especially aggressive, but this brew produced an ambitious 3 finger dark tan head. Looks delicious!  S - This smells absolutely delectable. Chocolate is foremost in the aroma, followed by some roasted malts. The chocolate gives a nice sweet aroma that plays so nicely with just a twinge of the roasted malt. Wow, can't wait drink this.  T & M - The aroma built me up and the flavor certainly did not let me down. That huge chocolate body is accented by a bit more roasted malt than the nose let on, and then accentuated with some slight hop bitterness toward the end. Yummy. Full bodied and the alcohol is well masked. Creamy mouthfeel with a bit of bitter chocolate aftertaste.  D - This is a beautiful example of the RIS style.

The roasted malts and coffee really come out right away with a hint of chocolate and dark fruit flavors. Well balanced and a small bitter bit in the finish.  M- Nice medium body and slick, carbonation is a little too much.  D- Wow, just a great beer. The 9% ABV is completely hidden in the taste, making this very easy to drink. It has great complexity but is not to the point were have one is enough. I feel that I could easily drinking a whole four pack in a night if I wanted.

Head of micro fine foam went to about two fingers and stayed around in a diminishing form during the entire consumption. Lacing of foam was in ample abundance during the review.  Nose is of delicious raisins and figs, with just the slightest of metallic notes.  Palate is of a viscous fig and coffee with the alcohol making its presents known just before the bite of carbonation appears.

112,412,BevMoAndrew,4.68,"Poured into a mug from a Nitro Tap at Hollingshead yesterday.  The North Coast Old Rasputin pours a pitch black in the mug with a very thick (almost like a chocolate milkshake) froth that cascades for almost 2 minutes! Needless to say, the beer had amazing head retention & beautiful lacing. The nose is pronounced, yet subtle & inviting with aromas of chocolate, mocha, vanilla, caramel, espresso, molasses, mild hop resin, & a mild alcohol sent that follows through on the palate. The beer has a full, yet extremely creamy body, smooth hop bitterness (more like a drying sensation), and long finish. In the past, I have thoroughly enjoyed this beer & must admit that this is one of my favorite beers. However, the beer gets even better from the nitro tap! Highest Recommendation!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,DovaliHops,4.42,Pors a pitch black with small tan head. Aroma has STRONG chocolate scent with hints of black licorice and espresso. Maybe a bit of vanilla and some toasted malts. Not much hop profile. This smells amazing. I've had this beer on many occasions and always loved it. Taste is very robust with chocolate and toffee. A bit of sweet vanilla and I'm getting some oak-like flavors. A bit of coffee as well. Great flavors...so well balanced. The mouthfeel is bit more crisp and light than a lot of IRSs...but still ver pleasant. I think it is this unique mouthfeel that makes this one of the most highly drinkable IRSs out there.,North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,EricCioe,3.88,"This stuff pours pretty black. It looks very nice with a small, espresso-crema looking head. The nose is a bit weak, pretty much smelling a non-descript brown. The taste is the best part here, some coffee and chocolate notes, not overly sweet or bitter, but pretty well balanced except for the coffee which stands out front. The mouthfeel is fuzzy and full, pretty nice. I like it, and the price is certainly right compared to other RIS.  EDIT - Each time I have this I like it less. I like my stouts on the less bitter side, I guess. I've got one stashed in the cellar for a year or more so that I can do a side by side with a fresh bottle and see if that helps it for me.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

A: The apperance is dark black, with hues of deep brown and chocolate. The head forms nice and quick with a darker brown/tan tone.  S: It smells of faint alcohol but more so chocolate with mild coffee/vanilla/caramel.  T: I pick up a lingering alochol taste on the finish. Before it gets there though, lots of caramel and vanilla. Robust coffee and chocolate. It got a lot smoother once it warmed up a bit, but still a lot boozy, the notes did get more noticable.  M/D: The carbonation was moderate, but I didn't find it very thick and creamy. It seemed thin and watery. I didn't hate this beer, the texture just seemed a little strange.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Really, chocolatey and syrupy. There's a nice roast character to the finish. The liquorice note comes through as well. Really nice and elegant.  Medium-full body with moderately-low carbonation.

A light amount of carbonation is visible. S: There are moderate aromas of dark roasted malts, chocolate and coffee in the nose. T: The taste is very similar to the smell and has a significant amount of bitterness in it. Notes of coffee beans particularly stand out in the finish. M: It feels medium- to full-bodied and rather rich on the palate. There is some dryness in the finish and warming from the alcohol.

Anyway, its still hot as balls here, but I picked some up 'cause I love the stuff.  A: Poured from the bottle into a Delirium Tremens snifter/tulip... Jet black, opaque - no light shall pass through the depths of Old Rasputin. Holding it up to light, I feel like I'm examining an 8-ball. Head is brown and somewhat frothy, but it recedes to a few islands of thin foam in the middle of the glass, leaving some sheets of slowly cascading, sparkling tan lace on the glass.  S: When I take a good whiff of Old Raspy, I get an aroma that is dominated by dark chocolate, burned malts, thick molasses and a hint of alcohol. Damn!  T: Mmmm - so tasty... Heavy dark chocolate up front - I love it. Espresso and brownie batter on the end. An impressive hop bite on the finish, but also some of that molasses / burnt sugar sweetness. Nice lingering bitterness that doesn't overpower.  M: Pretty freakin' perfect for the style, if you ask me. Close to full-bodied... a nice thickness, if you will. Good carbonation, too - it seems like a lot of RIS's are a little dead, carbo-wise - but this one has just a touch of zing that really adds another dimension.

Taste: Dark chocolate, roasted barley and coffee, with a semi-burnt molasses undercurrent throughout. Ends with a bite from the burnt molasses, roasted malt and English hops.

Tones of chocolate and coffee with a sweet tinge that prevents an extreme bitterness that these taste comparisons would suggest. A lingering hoppy finish that reminds you of its complexity.

Decent streaks of lace are left. Swirling revives a little foam. Lacing is ok but gets sporadic.  Moderately potent malt aromas that tend to be on the sweeter side of things. It kind of brings to mind chocolate milk & a creaminess reminiscent of hot chocolate. While the sweet aspect of the chocolate are most notable, there are subtle roasted undertones.  Tastes very similar to the nose; the only big difference being a slight hop twinge leading off. Roasted dark malts abound. Sweet throughout with creamy milk chocolate in the middle & on the finish. Hints of coffee bitterness in the back. Smooth all around.  Full bodied offering low carbonation that is smooth, allowing the flavors to take precedent. Faint lingering notes of roasted malts. Lacking is any appreciable alcohol heat.  Very good; not particularly complex but the whole seems greater than the sum of its parts, as it were. I imagine this ages well.

112,412,lou50rp,4.65,"Has a very dark, almost black color with a nice head of khaki, which lasts. Smell is of dark chocolate and black cherries. Taste is as promised by the smell. No alcohol taste and little bitterness. Feels really good in the mouth, thick and creamy. Very drinkable beer even with the 9.0 ABV. One of my favorite beers at any time.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,dnolan36,4.13,"Well tonight I decided to try my first Old Rasputin. I just started getting back into stouts and I am almost sad I have started with this one since it was so good. Well, anyways, here it goes.  When I opened the bottle, it poured black into my glass with about a finger of dark, rich brown head. The sight was quite lovely.  When I first brought the glass to my nose there was a nice chocolatety, nutty aroma. I sat the glass back down for about 20 minutes for it to warm up some and then smelled it again. The second time there was a faint vanilla/mocha smell, with a hint of malts and coffee.  The taste matched the smell almost. It had a dark chocolate, mocha, malty feel to it.  This was overall an excellent beer from opening it to drinking it. I could definitely enjoy several of these. However, I am still sipping on the one that I am using to write this review.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,stakem,4.18,"Review from notes taken 6/23/10.  On tap at Als served in a nonic. Appears black in color with a thick creamy tan head that retains very well and sticks in thick patches about the glass. Nose is full of dark grains smelling of coffee and dark chocolate with a blend of hops and dark skinned fruity sweetness. The alcohol becomes a bit more noticeable as it warms. Taste includes a mixture of alcohol, roasty grain and slightly citrusy hop bitterness upfront that blends through a medium creamy smooth body with more flavors of dark grainy sweetness. The roasted grains suggest black coffee, dark chocolate and dark skinned fruits much like the aroma indicated. There is a pleasant lingering bitterness from the darkly roasted grain coupled with the flavor and warmth of alcohol. This is a brew I enjoy regularly from a bottle and on nitro it is even more drinkable and creamy in the feel.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,jmeador85,4.9,"Appearance - Definitely a stout. One thing that never fails to impress me about Old Rasputin is the lingering head. It's still there when I finish drinking a 22 oz weizen glass, and I drink Old Rasputin slowly.  Smell - Many nuances that I'm at a loss to describe. You can tell, with certitude, that this beer is going to have some bite from the smell, but it's masking a complex flavor beneath.  Taste - This, too, could be described many ways. An amateur would say it's bitter, but beyond the bitterness is a bouquet of flavors that most people will appreciate.  Mouthfeel - Old Rasputin definitely has an aftertaste. The bitterness of the beer seems accentuated when you swallow, but I don't find it overwhelming. The mouthfeel makes you want another sip/gulp.  Drinkability - Definitely drinkable. Very good. Very strong, too.  Verdict - This is one of my favorite stouts. I tried this beer in December I believe, and a group of guys I know were drinking it so I thought I'd do the same. Well, the guys had a few more, and these Flying Saucer regulars staggered over to Barnes and Noble across the street where they sat in comfort and sobered up before driving home. This beer is strong. Drink with caution.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,SluggerOToole,4.36,"Poured into chalice after dinner. Ordered this with a cheese plate for dessert. The brew pours pitch black with a thin chocolate milk-colored head. The nose is subdued with caramel malt, cocoa, and faint hops.  The aromas carry straight through to the palate with strong roasty flavors like sweet coffee and dark chocolate flavors, there is a caramel and toffee sweetness up front also with resounding hop finish. Mouthfeel is heavy, full, silky, and lingering.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Keffa,4,"Poured into a Bells Oberon pint glass.  A: Pours pitch black with a nice tan head, about two fingers worth, that stays around for about 10 minutes before settling to a small cap. Decent lace sticks and doesn't let go. Nice start.  S: The quintessential RIS, coffee, chocolate, dark brown sugar, molasses, a little fig, and a nicely roasted malt. Nice aroma.  T: This tastes like a clone of Blackout from GLBC. Either that, or Blackout is a clone of this. Chocolate, coffee, dark fruit, a little bitterness from the black malt and hops. This is tough for me, as I love Blackout. I guess since Raspy seems to be year round, it should fill in nicely for Blackout.  M: Big, thick, creamy, almost chewy. Very nice.  D: Easier to drink the warmer it gets. Fantastic beer.  If I have to drink a Russian Imperial, and Blackout isn't on the shelves, this will be my go to. Well done.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,axeman9182,3.99,"12 oz bottle, allowed to warm a bit from the fridge, poured into my Duvel tulip.  The beer pours absolute black, with an absolutely massive tan head that paints the glass with lacing. Stunning beer. The nose is a little weak, bitter coffee with just a hint of chocolate that only becomes apparent as the beer warms some more. As I sip my opinion of the beer improves, the dark coffee flavor is still most prevalent while dark chocolate makes a little more noise than in the nose and there's also a slight warming sensation from the alcohol. Great mouthfeel on this beer as the body is nice and big and chewy, while the carbonation is suitably low. Old Rasputin is a very good beer, phenomenal in some aspects, but where it really matters most it falls just a little bit short of world class.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,zhanson88,4,"Appearance: Pitch black in the glass. When poured there was one finger of tan head. Most of it dissolved in a short amount of time, but some lacing remained around the edges of my glass.  Smell: Dark and chocolate malts along with coffee are very prevalent. Not a lot else, but a great smell nonetheless.  Taste: Very much along the same lines as the smell. Tastes very strongly of cocoa and coffee.  Mouthfeel: Very full body, as I expected from an imperial stout. Surprisingly smooth going down despite the relatively high alcohol content.  Drinkability: I had 1 of these, and I definitely would have been open to having 1 or 2 more. Not a beer that I could or would drink all night long.  Overall: A great imperial stout. A beer that I will be buying again.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Patchmaster,4.5,"What you read is what you get from this classic RIS. I could imagine this beer being served at a round table in the mid century. Nothing unusual out of the beer or pretentious. This just nails what an RIS originally was.  A - A dark black with a small lacing hits the glass. Not much lacing. This has a minimal head.  S - Immediately the smell of cocoa and coffee beans hit you.  T - This has a very smooth texture with strong flavoring of dark chocolate. I think I just drank a Hershey Dark Chocolate candy bar.  M - Smooth, Creamy and a great mix of carbonation. This beer is right on.  D - I prefer this on a cold winters night, but this beer satisfies my craving every time.  I love this simplistic approach to an old style beer.

112,412,wolfinthemirror,4.28,"Pours jet black with a thick n creamy mocha colored head. No light can be seen through this beer whatsoever. It's a beautiful sight in my tulip glass.  In the nose I get thick scents of chocolate malt immediately. That's the main thing that I can smell.  The taste is amazing. A thick texture of chocolate malty goodness. It finishes more bitter than sweet, but not quite dry. Some smokey components are there. The alcohol is very well hidden, buried under the layers of silky smooth malts.  Full bodied, light carbonation.. very viscous, thick, and chewy. Melts in the mouth.  While the Rasputin has a fairly high ABV of 9%, It's delicious enough to drink a lot of. So you gotta be careful not to guzzle too many of these down.

112,412,callmeclemens,1.15,"Upon pouring this beer looked like cola, maybe a little darker. Smelled like licorse. Tasted like Licorse and Alcohal. I found this beer difficult to sip, sallow, and even gulp. Had no head, and no lacing whatsoever which leads me to believe I may have gotten a bad bottle, so perhaps I'll try again.  However, judging from what I know about Rasputin, this seems like the kind of thing he would drink by the barrelful atleast ten times a day. So I suppose mission accomplished, Comrades.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

It's hidden with strong coffee and roasted malt aroma. Smells wonderful.  T: The initial taste is creamy in the front of the palate with hints of dark chocolate. The flavor then turns to mocha and finishes with a bitter coffee and herbal taste. The aftertaste is surprisingly smooth and long lasting. You can tell there is high alcohol, but it is lost in the sweet, stong coffee flavors.  M: Full-bodied, creamy and smooth, and medium carbonation.  D: Definitely enjoyable.

112,412,AgentMunky,4.42,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a St. Bernardus goblet.  A: Looks like a typical Russian Imperial Stout. Dark dark-brown with thin nutty-coloured head. Implacable and imposing; I look forward to drinking this beer.  S: So nice. Lightly-roasted, gently-sweet malts. There is a definitely fruity tone to the alcoholic sweetness. Some hints of chocolate and even less of coffee.  T: Deliciously tasty. A smooth, sweet beer, with surprising spicy notes appearing at the end of the taste (cinnamon and something akin to paprika spring to mind). The main taste is mildly bitter, a roasted flavour with a hint of hops. The aftertaste is slightly sticky with savoury chocolate notes opening up amidst the aforementioned spices.  M: Carbonation lightens the taste considerably, but cannot stem a creeping sticky sweetness in the aftertaste. Not unpleasant, but not a point in its favour either.  D: With the notable exception of Bell's Expedition Stout, Old Rasputin is the best Russian Imperial Stout I've ever consumed. While by no means a light fare, it is more accessible and consumable than other beers of the same style. Very drinkable and highly recommended.  EDIT: The following review is of a bottle aged in a friend's wine cellar for 14 months (and an additional month and a half sitting in my refrigerator.  Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a St Bernardus goblet. Reviewed 25 December 2011. I can't find a best by date, but the neck label has almost completely peeled itself off.  4.5A: An excellent cocoa-coloured head forms an impressive crown to a coal-black beer. Utterly dark and completely opaque, this is what I like an Imperial Stout to look like. Great lacing.  5S: Mmmm, yes. Huge and boozy. Less dry than I remember, but much more fruity and alcoholic. Very similar to Bell's Expedition Stout which, in my book, is a very good thing indeed. Richer and more rewarding than I initially thought, ten minutes later I still haven't taken a sip. I'm simply letting my nose revel in these sensations. Superlative smell. Blueberries?  4T: This is more what I expected from an aged Rasputin. Moderate chocolatey bitterness with virtually no hop presence and a sweetish fruit/alcohol maintaste which trails off slowly leaving very little aftertate. Disappointing after such a monumental smell, but still quite nice.  3.75M: Thick and almost sticky. Little carbonation. Nice enough.  4.25O: A very good beer, but I'm not sure the changes in flavour advocate ageing. Most of the spice and bitterness has absented itself in favour of slow, mellow sweetness. I probably prefer a fresh bottling, but I might age another one because it changed character significantly more than the Expedition Stout after cellaring.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,dzni,4.37,"A - Pours an inky black with a light reddish-brown head that disappears quickly. S - A nice coffee, chocolate, and molasses hits the nose. Maybe some slight berry in there providing some sweetness. T - Rich espresso and chocolate in the mouth is consistent with the nose. Really nice. Not overly bitter at all, just right. M - Heavy with a bit of carbonation (or is that hops) providing a nice counterbalance to the richness of the chocolate/espresso. D - I doubt I could drink this all night at 9%, but it's perfect for both the colder months and as a pairing with dessert (or by itself!).",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

T: The initial taste is creamy in the front of the palate with hints of dark chocolate. The flavor then turns to mocha and finishes with a bitter coffee and herbal taste. The aftertaste is surprisingly smooth and long lasting. Expected the beer to have more of a burn because of the smell, but is slightly there and is overwhelmed with the other flavors.

But the alcohol was very subdued and the beer really didn't seem particularly rich. Oh it smelled rich as hell, but it finished downright clean and tangy. Which was cool enough, I suppose, but more like I would expect from a Porter than a RIS.  Deep, dark, and nearly absent of color. Fine coffee-cream head. Smells of blood and grilled meats. Sweet Turkish coffee on the palate. Oddly un-rich, actually. Even tangy on the finish.

Although the 9% is hidden pretty well, it does come through with a bit of a wine or even liqueur taste... didn't care for that part of it.

T - Taste pretty much follows the nose. Lots of dark chocolate notes up front followed by a sweeter taste of vanilla. Dark brewed coffee comes through at the end followed by the warm bite of alcohol. This is one beer that I buy on a regular basis, and I have noticed that sometimes the alcohol bite at the end is a little more pronounced than other times.

I see no light is passing through this pint glass - dark and lovely the way it should be.  S - Malts, chocolate and coffee hit the nose immediately, some hops and caramel in the mix as I swirl the pint glass. Little smell of alcohol at the end.  T - Light hop on the fromt of the tongue, roasted/burnt malts are the dominant flavor with some bakers chocolate. Strong Coffee/Espresso character. Finishes kinda sweet which is interesting in that it starts out hoppy and harsh.  M - Medium Body, definately not full.As stated above, enters harsh but leaves the mouth with a sweet-like aftertaste. Don't really realize the strength of raspy while drinking it (9% ABV)  D - Easily drinkable, again, watch the ABV, you could easily down a couple of these like they were black & tans!

Deep chocolate notes, some slightly metallic notes, some other stuff I can't rightly place. Maybe a touch of bourbon. Flavor is dramatic. Nothing hits you immediately, but quickly a blast of flavor attacks. Complex, somewhat bitter but not too bitter. Somewhat sweet, but not too sweet. It's kinda like a Charleston Chew that's been frozen and dipped in espresso flavored syrup. This is incredible beer. The bitterness is sharp, but dissipates into a long, wonderful hop finish.

112,412,IPAescotch,4.2,"An exceptional example to all brewers of how to blend coffee with beer while doing credit to each. For an IPA man i found this to be right up my alley. Welcome bitterness, and the darkness is not overwhelmingly sweet or malty.

112,412,Luk13,3.98,"Bottle. Pitch black pour with creamy brown head with great retention. Roasted malts and stale coffee aromas and taste. Decent mouthfeel, nothing extraordinary.  On tap at lion's pride. The chocolate flavors were more dominant and the mouthfeel a little more creamy. There was also nuts, licorice and dark fruits. Fresher and superior.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,AlexCorleone,3.73,"A - Definitely black with a thin layer of delectable, malty chocolaty head that dissipates rather quickly, pooling slightly in the center of the glass and radiating outwards as the glass progresses.  S - Definitely vanilla dominates; coffee and chocolate follows, with heavily roasted malts, brown sugar, and alcohol undercurrents that sting the nose.  T - Again vanilla and coffee are protagonists, followed by dark chocolate. Roasted malts, finish rather bitter and alcoholic, with pleasing warmth.  M - Full-bodied and smoked feel.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,hangh,4.2,"Dark black colored beer with a tan almost amber head and a thick 1-2"" head. Very fine and barely clings to the glass. Very sweet malty aroma. Full of coffee scents. Smells like some burnt chocolate in there too. Taste is very full of bitter coffee and toffee at first with a smooth burnt chocolate finish. There is a small gap in between where there is a kind of relaxing taste that is pretty unique and cool. Medium to heavy bodied with light carbonation. It's great for one drink but probably too heavy for two in one sitting, not to mention 9% ABV",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,uustal,4.33,"50th Review  Pours black as night with a light brown, two-finger head which leaves a nice frothy lacing. Pleasant creamy chocolate/coffee aroma with a little dark fruit and citrus/pine hops as well. Big roasted flavor. Sweet chocolate and roasted, bitter coffee up front. Pretty hopped up RIS with some pine and sweeter citrus rind. More roasted, dry, somewhat burnt malts on the finish. A very abrupt halt to the flavors after finish. Kind of like a really big Irish dry stout, but with the flavor amped up 10-fold. Creamy, thick mouthfeel.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Mora2000,4.25,"Pint served at the Fort Worth Gingerman.  The beer pours black with a tan head. The aroma is roasted malt with some chocolate and alcohol. The flavor is awesome. I get notes of chocolate. roasted malt, alcohol and some piney hops, which contribute a medium level of bitterness.

112,412,chickenflea,4.43,"I have been wanting to try this beer for a long time because several of my friends rave about it. Beer pours very dark. Buckskin colored head is medium tall but extremely persistent. The aroma is as one would expect for the style with a lot of heavy dark cherry/rapsberry over the mocha base. The taste is excellent. Sweet dark malts with bitter espresso finish. Fruity sourness lightens the experience preventing the beer from crushing the palate with its imperial rule. Alcohol is not overbearing, but balanced lending a warming quality to the finish. Medium heavy on the palate. This beer is really pleasant. Not the uber beer I was expecting, but balanced and accommodating in all regards. Another quality brew from North Coast.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,carlborch,4.88,"Pours a solid black with a thick, ultra creamy tan-brown head of about 2 inches. The head is persistent and settles in at 1.5 inches. The initial nose suggest dark roast, coffee, chocolate and chicory. The body is medium-full to full. The initial taste expounds on the coffee and chocolate notes with added sweet notes that suggest a confection. The middle notes are full, creamy and rich followed by a smooth lingering. The rich, sweet, roasted notes moderate the bitter hops which are noticeable but not overpowering. This is a multi-layered, rich, ale. The alcohol is evident and provides warmth in the finish. This is not a session beer despite the moreish tendencies. Nice, broad Belgian lace forms. Yes, I will return to it.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,industrialswill,4.35,"A very handsome looking beer as it sits on the shelf. The most inviting label art I've ever seen. The beer pours out looking like carbonated Kahlua. Smells like roasted malt, tastes like roasted malt, the 9% alky volume gives it a wonderful amount of kick. This is a fantastic beer that will spoil your taste buds for lighter styles if you will allow it.  This beer rates a solid A.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Elendinn,4,"Poured from a bottle into a New Belgium snifter.  A - pours an ominous black with a thin layer of delectable, chocolatey head (one of the darker shades of head I've seen) that dissipates rather quickly, pooling slightly in the center of the glass and radiating outwards as the glass progresses. Sloth-like lacing speckles and meanders down the sides of the snifter.  S - coffee dominates; dark chocolate follows, with heavily roasted malts, brown sugar, and alcohol undercurrents that sting the nose -- very foreboding.  T - a hefty amount of espresso-like coffee up front, followed by dark chocolate. Roasted malts reintroduce themselves, as expected, finishing rather bitter and alcoholic, with a pleasing warmth. The flavors I expect are there, but they lack the finesse of more finely-polished imperials.  M - Medium-bodied and relatively carbonated -- not as smooth as I'd like.  D - it's a bit assaulting out of the bottle, amplifying some of its less pleasing aspects. It shines on nitro, but, for the price, it's about as good as you can get. The four-packs are great for sharing, but not something I can tackle by myself. Best served in the winter, sipped meticulously on a frigid, snowy evening.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Just stellar.  Taste: Burnt malt, fresh brewed coffee, some dark chocolate notes.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied, creamy and smooth.  Drinkability: Wow. I haven't had this beer for years, but this definitely is a winner. I think it gets over looked for more hyped beers but this is a very smooth and enjoyable RIS that is dangerously smooth and drinkable.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,AdamMY,4.49,"I picked this up at a local Trader Joes, It was selling in a four pack for under 10 dollars.  I would rate the appearance on this as just average, as the appearance on a Stout is never really that great, but the fact that this poured an amazingly thick head which is just clinging to the walls as it bubbles away.  Its got an amazingly thick coffee and chocolate malt aroma, that smells actually rather bitter.  Wow, I might need to redefine my view of flavorful. This hits you with a very strong mocha, with a perfect balance between chocolate, milk, and bitter espresso. But its got a different level to it which leaves you asking ""Is that a little bit of mint? Could that be a bit of a tart fruit also?""  I in truth have never experienced a mouth feel that was so smooth that packed that amount of flavor, but the downfall with most dark beers is while they taste great, and may have a great mouth feel, you never really want to just drink them non stop.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,NWer,4.65,12 oz. bottle aggressively poured into a Weizen glass. Very dark to black color with beautiful head retention. This is a beer to savor slowly - if possible.

High marks on all categories.,North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,RomaniIteDomum,4.35,"This looks quite different off nitro. The creamy tan head is beautiful on top of the black doom that is Rasputin.  The smell has quite a bit of fruit, coffee, and some cream.  Taste follows the nose fairly well. Lots of cream and stone fruit with a hint of creamed coffee in the finish.  Creamy as hell.

T: My first sip was way too cold, alcohol surprised me - and a somewhat muted palate. After only a short time in the glass Raspy revealed heavily roasted malts, cocoa, and fresh coffee beans. Sharp hop bitterness mid palate (almost juicy), warming finish. Initial slap of alcohol is now hidden, thankfully. Well balanced.  M: ""Medium bodied"" as far as stouts go, pretty well carbed. Fits the flavor profile nicely, though.  D: Probably too good for 9%.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,COBeerBuff,4.27,"Poured into an 8 oz. snifter at Barley's in Shawnee, KS.  Appearance: When I first laid eyes upon the glass, it looked strikingly like a dry stout, whether this is due to a nitro tap or what, I don't know at this point. There was a solid finger and a half of tan colored head that looked soft and billowy. And the beer itself is black as night. No light is getting through today, and it's a pretty sunny day here on the plains.  Smell: This beer smells heavily of roasted chocolates and toasted grain malts. There is a lot of sweet vanilla and some cream as well. Subtle hops are present, but this beer is certainly all about the malts, which is exactly what an impy stout should be about.  Taste: Much like the nose, this beer is a heavy chocolate, grain malt bomb. The chocolates are mostly dark and heavy with a bit of spiciness as well. The grains on the other hand represent everything that is good with using toasted and burnt grain malts in a beer. I love it.  Mouthfeel: Amazingly enough, the nose didn't display anything overt, but the first sip had some stinging alcoholic esters, which was very surprising. As the beer warmed and settled, these phenolic overtones mellowed considerably, but it was a bit harsh to start. This brew was definitely served too cold for my tastes.  Drinkability: As I find myself staring at my final third, I can't help but remark about the drinkability of this brew. Many RIS tend to be heavy, thick, viscous sipping beers. This is not like those. It definitely has a pronounced mouthfeel. It's not too light, but it doesn't sit heavily in your stomach either. North Coast created a winner with this RIS, and it is one that I will continue to drink happily here in Kansas.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,TheSarge,4.35,"Pours pitch black and produces a ton of creamy milk chocolate looking head, which dissipate to solid pacing.  In the aroma there are roasted coffee and cocoa hints.

112,412,jagoffyinzer,4.17,"A: Pours pitch black with a thick head that dissipates to a thin layer. Great lacing on the edges and good head retention though it slowly fades as you drink. Carbonation is right on for the style.  S: A nice malty chocolate hits your nose and dances with some vanilla and alcohol. Also getting some roast and coffee notes.  T: Greeted with a vibrant roast flavor with a bitter back bone. Some alcohol notes on the finish. The roast flavor also plays counter part to some underlying chocolate.  M: This is initially very creamy and smooth but the finish is quite dry, almost too dry.  D: It is pretty hefty but this an Imperial Stout, it's not made to session. For the ABV it's not upfront and in your face like it is with some other beers of this style. It is masked very well with the roast aroma and flavor, it sticks out where it should.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

If looking at the thinner parts of the body, it's reddish brown.  S: Although the alcohol is one of the first things that hits the nose, it does so in sort of a soft way.  T: semi bitter coffee, tobacco, alcohol. There are also some grassy, hay like notes in a pleasant way. I would find it more pleasant with less alcohol or less of an alcohol flavor.  M: Smooth with a medium body, but the alcohol doesn't leave the most pleasant of mouth sensations.  D: Relatively heavy, I couldn't have more than 1 or two.

Chocolate and Licorice are present in the middle with the warming of the Alcohol for the finish.  Mouthfull is medium, not as thick as you'd expect from such a good Russian Stout, but you get past that very quickly.  The drinkability of this beer is scary, it goes down very smooth with a big flavor that is hard to put down. This is a very good Russian Stout,the best beer from North Coast Brewing.

A: Pitch black with a frothy almond colored head.  S: Coffee, with hints of roasted malty goodness.  T: Awesome. So much flavor from this little bad boy. Malty, roasted unsweetened cocoa, maybe some mollases coming through. Tasty and goes great with a nice medium rare steak.  M: Initially it comes on thick in an epic kind of way, then warms in the mouth and settles back to unleash the flavors.  D: Highly. The alcohol is a ghost in this stout which deceives its 9% content.

Certainly the dates coming to the tongue and some nice roasted malts. I wish it were a little more roasty. Not as full bodied as I expected and a little more carbonation than I expected as well.

112,412,bluetravlr,3.83,"Walked home from work at 1am in the pouring rain with this beer in hand. Ah . . . it is good to be home.  A: Nice two full fingers of initial tan/rootbeer colored head. Almost completely black. This beer hardly lets any light through at all but upon further inspection a slight rich-brown coloration can be observed. The head stays with you till the end leaving rich, if not abundant, lacing.  S: Note of anise and sweetbread and coffeee are what first come to mind. Also, some roasted oats and chestnuts and maybe a bit of freshly cut grass?  T: Very similar to the nose. Initially a little sweet with flavors of both toffee and caramel. This sweetness rides to the finish but is enhanced by overlapping layers of coffee, dried leaves, burnt brush, but mostly a grassy bitterness that is most notable in the finish . . . with a hint of lemon rind. Overall, kind of like a nutty cinnamon roll, yet, obviously much more complex.  M: Thick bodied, though average for a stout, mostly due to the sweetness. A little heavy on the carbonation for a stout. A lingering dryness due to the grassy bitterness of the hops  D: The alcohol is pretty well masked. However, perhaps ironically, the sweetness and bitterness detract from this beers sessionability. Instead of blending together in harmony the sweet and bitter qualities of this beer seem to be at odds with one another.  This review, as shown in the ratings, is not meant to dismiss in any way the quality of this beer. It is extremely interesting . . . and in more ways than one delicious. Just not as balanced as some of my favorite stouts.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

The head steadily dissipates over the next few minutes, finally settling to a one finger tall head.  The nose is super heavy roasted malt and chocolate. Chocolate is definitely king, but it definitely has a devilish side....a hop side.  The flavor follow suit. Chocolate cover hops is the best way to describe it. I remember just about two years ago, I was in college and bought my first Ol' Raspy. God it was one hell of a tough stout to drink....good, but tough. And now that my pallet matured, it was the mixture of the hops and chocolate malt that made it so damn challenging.  Mouth feel and drinkability are both great. Overall, Old Raspy is excellent. I'm glad my pallet has matured enough to enjoy this great brew!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,PartyBear,4.5,"This is a beer I've been after for a while, and finally got my hands on it thanks to the Cracked Kettle in Amsterdam. Pours jet black with a decent level of carbonation and a big creamy tan head that shows good retention. The aroma is hugely dark and heavy with intense notes of chocolate, coffee and dark forest fruits. The taste is dark and bitter from the start with flavours of the highest quality cocoa, strong bitter espresso and a earthy smokey peat. After a few sips it is really the coffee flavours that come through the strongest, providing a massively rich imperial stout. The feel is full bodied and silky smooth, with just the right amount of carbonation. This is a superb imperial stout, one of the best i have tasted.

Touch of vanilla. A little bit of hops comes through before the malts leave a roasty finish.  M: Having this on nitro made this amazing. Just super creamy and smooth. Very viscous and chewy. Probably one of the best mouthfeels on any beer I've had.  D: This beer was so smooth it went down with ease. I've always liked this beer out of the bottle, but nitro made it so much better.

Love the fruit in this, a really pleasant surprise. I let a few others smell this and nobody agreed with me, so I'm probably full of it.  The malt dominates again, and the hoppy bitterness completes an excellent flavor. Lots of depth here with layers of the malt.  Nice carbonation, good but not great mouthfeel. Probably just personal preference, as I like lighter mouthfeel. It's a stout, so for the style, I can't complain.  Not particularly drinkable, I definitely couldn't have more than one of these given the density and relatively high ABV%.

Smells of roasted malts, smooth dark chocolate, and very light leafy hops. As the beer warms the aroma sweetens a bit.  Tastes similar to how it smells, although a bit more complex. Lightly roasted malt flavors kick things off and are joined quickly by semi-sweet chocolate flavors. Midway through the sip the chocolate flavors sweeten a bit and are joined by very mild amounts of vanilla. Finally, hints of leafy hops come into play right before a mildly bitter ending.  Mouthfeel is great. It's got a very viscous thickness with grainy carbonation.  Drinkability is very good. I finished my glass quickly and could easily have another.

The smell reminds me of walking through Central Market in the morning right after they got some fresh rye or Russian black bread done. Bout the same ingredients so... I love it when the heads are creamy, almost ice cream like. As part of them falls away to reveal the delicate insides of tasty cloud. The taste is more effervescent than I thought and man a lot going on. Well you have the fruity flavours from the malt. Deep roasty and a mix of more flavours than I can identify. Almost a plum, slight strawberry, bit of cherry and ten other things that I can't begin to emote. Leaves a taste of slightly overcooked toast and those lovely fruit flavours. I can see why this is a popular one.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Aroma: Smoky malts and bitter, unsweetened chocolate with a hint of coffee. The smokiness is to die for!  Flavor/Finish: Deep roasted malts, with elements of coffe and chocolate. the midtones are quite sweet while the finish has a coffee-flavored bitterness. Lingering, mouth-coating finish which betrays the high abv at times.  Body/Mouthfeel: Very full-bodied and creamy, not a heavy mouth-coating. Very low carbonation lends to a somewhat syrupy mouthfeel at times.  Drinkability: With a somewhat syrupy texture, high abv and a heavy, full body, Old Rasputin is a sipper to end a evening with.

The aroma is chocolaty with some licorice(light). Complex beer in the nose. On the taste side, it is similar to the aroma. However, the finish is bitter which was not present in the aroma. Alcohol is present in the mouth.  This is an excellent russian imperial stout. Complex but still well balanced with a very nice hoppy finish. The mouthfeel shows the beer to be slightly creamy.

Smell: Coffee and chocolate with some sharp roasted malt aroma and some faint smokiness.  Taste: Slightly sweet dark malts upfront, followed quickly by roasted malt and charred bitterness. Hops are definitely there, but do not play a leading role in the flavors. A bit of rich coffee flavor is evident also. Bittersweet on the finish.

M: A very powerful lingering taste, one that releases flavors well after the beer is gone.

The aroma is perfectly of coffee and chocolate with light roasted malt notes, while the flavor is of light coffee and chocolate malts, with a slight hop bitterness towards the finish. I really enjoy the level of roasted flavors, as there are very pleasant notes, but it does not become overbearing as can easily happen.

112,412,charlesbyrd,4.12,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a St. Bernardus chalice.  A: This beer is pretty much jet black, with minimal signs of carbonation. I struggled to get much of a head, maybe because I poured it too carefully, but what I got was a nice caramel brown.  S: I get alot of charred malt aroma, with vague hints of unsweetened chocolate. The coffee is definitely there, too. This is what I imagined it would be like, and it smells great.  T: OK, I must admit that this is only my second ever RIS (I've also had the one from Stone), so I didn't quite know what I was looking for. There is an immediate black coffee/dark chocolate taste, accompanied by a related bitterness. However, the bitterness doesn't stick around for long, only on the edges of the tongue. It is followed with a mild malty sweetness. It's interesting how the different tastes seem to move around your mouth.  M: I am surprised by the amount of carbonation here. I was expecting something a little flatter and heavier. I'd say it's got a medium body that gives way to an oily texture accompanying the aftertaste. Not quite what I had in mind for a beer this powerful.  D: I thoroughly enjoyed this beer, even though some of the elements surprised me. If I hadn't known this was 9% ABV, you wouldn't be able to convince me; the alcohol is hidden behind all the other flavors, and it goes down so smoothly. Other brewers need to try this and take note.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Carbonation is at a very good level.  D - Decent; it's relatively thick, which is a plus for mouthfeel and a slight detractor in terms of drinkability.

Smells of rich mocha, coffee, chocolate, charred malt and slightly burnt biscuits. A nice caramel background smooths over the harsh dark characters of the smell. The taste is upfront and unapologitic. It is dark, roasted, coffee with almost a peppery finish. Some hops make there way in mostly as a balance and a bittering enhancer.

The taste is good, not quite what I expected from the smell. The roasted coffee flavor comes through along with a little burn from the alcohol.

Slight alcohol burn, but hidden behind some cherry like aromas. Big chocolate nose, reminiscent of the Brooklyn BCS.  T: A bit dry and bitter, full of roast. Chocolate and dark roast coffee come through. Some dark fruits, mostly raisins and dark cherries. Hops are quite bittering, a nice touch to this big and roasty brew. Cocoa powder seems to lend its flavor and its presence on the mouthfeel.  M: Dry, roasty, bitter and super dark and creamy. This is a Russian Imperial Stout. Great body and carbonation, just a bit of fizz that is left around the palate after swallowing. Slight heat from the alcohol.  D: As far as RIS's go, this is one of my favorites. It never disappoints on the classic flavor of what a RIS should be. Absolutely delicious and more breweries should take some notes on this one.

Zero light can survive the blackness of this brew. 1 finger dark tan head crowns the top of the beer. Lacing is wonderful.  S- Coffee, and chocolate with a hint of vanilla and brown sugar makes my mouth water with every sniff.  T- Hello flavor town! Population, ME! This is a flavor power house. Burnt coffee up front, followed by semi-sweet chocolate, vanilla, molasses and brown suger.  M- Smooth and creamy just the way a stout should feel. Very sticky on the lips. Carbonation is there but it is faint enough to make a lasting impression on the tastebuds without being off putting.  D- This beer is exciting and exquisite and one is definately not enough!

Especially for a high gravity stout such as this one. I really like a good chewy stout, especially when the flavors here are so exceptional. There is a stickiness in the finish on my lips which I do enjoy.  ~ Overall this is a very good beer. There are few stouts that can brag such a robust palate.

Smell is of roasted malts, a bit hoppy, with some chocolate and vanilla.  Taste has the roasted malts with some chocolate, vanilla, dark fruit. A tiny bit boozy. A nice blend with some hops up front.  Mouthfeel is medium/heavy bodied, lower carbonation. Slick and leaves the mouth and tongue coated. A slight tongue bite up front from the hops.  Drinkability is high based on the taste, but medium based on ABV. I could have a couple of these, but at 9%, I might prefer to stop after one.  Overall this is a tasty stout, very refreshing, and has a nice amount of hops present.

112,412,jeffthecheff,4.33,"Black color with an impressively dark head. It's a dark brown in color and leaves great, brown sugar lacing down the sides. The head keeps great for the whole glass.  I think I've had fresher bottles of this beer before, because I remember it being more hoppy. It smells great now, too. It has the typical coffee and chocolate aromas, but leans more towards a burnt, coffee like roast. The hops are in the background, adding a slight grassy element that makes it refreshing.  The flavor has a strong, bitter roast to it. The finish is bitter from both coffee flavored black malts and a lot of hops. The sweetness lies behind all the dry, bitter notes and adds just a touch of chocolate. A tiny bit of citrus hops are found on the finish, but don't add too much to it.  The mouthfeel is heavy and thick all the way through, with the heavy roast notes playing a nice contrast. It's smooth all the way, with carbonation just a bit on the high side. This beer is on the low end abv-wise for Imperial Stouts, but it feels a bit higher. This beer paired well with a chocolate cake.

112,412,Arbitrator,3.87,"Chilled bottle into a glass, warmed up to room temp.  A: Pours a pitch black body with a light tan head that rises to a pinky finger in height. Retention is short, as expected for an impy stout, leaving a thin collar around the edges.  S: Even when cold, it's pretty pungent. The hops are quite prominent, lending an earthy citrus presence that blends beautifully with roasted coffee and bitter dark chocolate. Hints of anise tease the nose.  T: Chocolate-dominated, by far. Silky, delicious dark chocolate that complements both the roasted coffee and earthy hop bitterness. I pick up citrus as well; it's unusual to me that I've grown to enjoy citrus and chocolate flavors in the past couple of months. I used to hate that clash, before. There is a light anise note in the finish, where the chocolate makes a resurgence. Coffee bitterness in the aftertaste.  M: Light-medium bodied. Not exactly viscous, but full in flavor. Silky feel owing to low carbonation.  D: A fantastic deal; I often find 4-packs under $8 and this most recent one cost $6. Great quality, fantastic pricing. It's great to revisit it and enjoy a staple for once. These days, it is outclassed by bigger, heavier interpretations of the style. But those beers also tend to be significantly more expensive, and not so much more enjoyable that this ceases to be a good deal.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,ludachris,4.3,"Pours an inky black with chestnut edges. Two fingers of mocha coloured head top this beer, displaying excellent retention, especially when considering the style, and leaving thick lines of sticky lace.  Sweet dark chocolate, oats, roasted malts, hints of coffee grains, raisons, plums, and a semi-hot ethanol character make up the nose. An assertive smell but not overpowering and very, very inviting.  A big roasted malt character greets the palate first, coating the subtle dark fruits that quickly follow and matching the dark chocolate character. The finish is quite dry with notes of coffee and cocoa powder, all of which occur over a smooth oaty taste and feel. Even as the beer warms, the alcohol is still very well hidden.  Mouthfeel is full but leans towards a more creamy and smooth feel rather than a thick and oily one, with the latter being the seemingly most common one for the style. It could be a bit richer, but it just adds to its drinkability which is ridiculously good considering both the style and ABV.  I can see why this sits on the top 5 of the most reviewed beers on this site and still retains such a high rating. Complex, very flavourful, and oh so easy to drink. I'd say this is my favourite RIS to date with Brooklyn's Black Chocolate Stout close behind. Worth EVERY penny.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

When you take a deep inhale of this elixir you get a breath of roasted malts that is very inviting and intriguing. The mouthfeel of this beer is thick and chewy making it a slow slipper. The taste starts out witha lsoght sweet note then the roated malts take over which is a good thing(thats what these beers are all about).

Aroma is ambrosia: dark cocoa, coffee, plumbs, burnt toffee and a deep grassy tone over some sweetness.  The flavor has all the tastes expected in an imperial stout but in spades, and this makes for a very complex amalgam of flavor mid palate and this changes as it warms with every warming sip giving a new set of tastes impressions... here are just some of the notable tastes: dark chocolate, mocha, cherry pipe tobacco, burnt toffee, licorice, anise, figs, prunes, toasted bundt cake, smoked cherry wood...wonderful complexity.

112,412,eat,4.34,"I've been hoping for a chance to try this one out for a while. Thanks to ritzkiss for opening this one up after cellaring for a year and a half or so.  Old Rasputin is black and opaque. The head fades to a ring around the glass and a patchy covering with bits of lacing. Head retention could be better, but I guess that's fairly typical for a strong, old beer.  The nose is of wheaty cracker, dark chocolate, caramel, light coffee, earthy hops and tons of smoky roast. Delicious. The alcohol comes off a little hot, surprisingly. I would have thought the aging would have smoothed that away. Definitely smells imperial anyway.  Heaps of roastiness follow in the mouth. High-quality dark chocolate, light coffee, bready and wheaty. The alcohol found in the smell seems to have disapeared here. Coffee on the finish.  I'd like the body to be fuller to match the malty flavour. The feel would be fine for a less-intense stout, but this one is just so big. Not bad though; smooth medium body and moderate carbonation.  For a RIS, the drinkability is as crazy as old Rasputin himself. So smooth. If I didn't know its ABV, I would say it was sessionable but obviously this one would kick your ass if you tried.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Dark chocolate as well with a touch of alcohol as well.  T - Lots of charcoal & a bit alcohol burn upfront, rich dark chocolate flavors follow, not as complex as I expected. This beer finishes with pronounced alcoholic flavor & burn, from the tongue all the way down the throat! A bit more roasted & chocolaty flavors are there when it warmed, big dark chocolate flavors are dominate.  M - A bit slick and almost full bodied, allot thinner than I expected. Mild mild crispness on the tongue.  D - Well I might have a snifter or 2 after a long day. I did expect a bit more complexity for sure, I don't recommend drinking this straight out of the fridge because there's more flavors to enjoy when it's around room temp.

The first thing i notice when tasting this is a bit of bitterness right up front followed quickly by alcohol which seems to merry with a very roasted malt character that i can describe only as black licorice and dark chocolate. There is a charcoal-like bitterness that carries through the beer and lingers at the end along with some dark chocolate. Mouth-feel is smooth in texture, full bodied with low carbonation.

As with the aroma, it has a big chocolate malt taste upfront with a significant and surprising hop presence. A nice coffee and slightly sweet alcohol taste with fuzzy carbonation finishes it off. This doesn't have the thick mouth coating feel I've typically gotten from this style. Instead it's kind of tacky and a little dirty but in a good way.  In short, I think this beer has something for everyone.

112,412,ThreeDimesDown,3.33,"Pours deep black with no light shining through and a dark brown thin head that doesn't fade away, but clings to the glass until the last sip.  Aroma has dark fruit and dark cocoa. Roasted malts is the main attraction with a slight pine that smells more like the alcohol coming through.  The taste has some nice components working: espresso, dark chocolate, dark fruit, roasted malts. These flavors are well balanced but I'm thrown off by an astringent aftertaste.  The mouthfeel is oily, slightly creamy and full. Low carbonation is very pleasant.  I've been waiting to try this brew for a while and have to say I'm disappointed. Maybe my expectations were too high, or the bottle needed to mellow a bit. Overall, the unbalanced alcohol taste and smell left me wishing I cellared the bottle.

112,412,damndirtyape,4.1,"Single bottle (no date on bottle) poured into a shaker pint.  Appearance: Poured a very persistent tan 1/4"" thick head. Good lacing as I drank it down - sometimes in thick sheets. The beer is quite black and there is maybe, just maybe, a hint of brown glow in the entire thing when held up to the light. Otherwise it's opaque.  Smell: Alcohol, fruit/prunes, some hops, and chocolate notes all rolled up into one. Very nice.  Taste: Quite good. Rich bittersweet chocolate up front, followed by a balanced bitter finish with hop and coffee flavors. At times the beer reminds me of a dark chocolate covered espresso bean.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and creamy. Not thick and goes down really easy. Carbonation isn't very noticable - not that this is a problem.  Drinkability: Despite the high alcohol I think I could go for another.

112,412,MasterSki,4.07,"I picked up a four-pack at Whole Foods recently. This is one of those Top 100 beers that I've had plenty of times but never took the time to review. Served in a Surly pint glass.  A - Pours with a finger of light mocha foam that dissipates to a thin haze. Body is black with the faintest glint of red-brown at the fringes of the glass. There are a few fingers of lace left behind as the beer slowly disappears from my glass.  S - Dark roasted malt, dark fruits, dark chocolate, light caramel, and maybe a bit of salty soy. There's actually a bit of light floral hoppiness to it as well - guessing this was a relatively fresh batch.  T - The taste has a lot of roast bitterness to it, accentuated by espresso and dark chocolate notes. There are some floral hop and licorice notes as well. Verges on burnt and acrid, as there isn't much balancing sweetness. Maybe a bit of alcohol here too. Bitterness lingers well into the aftertaste.  M - Too much harsh carbonation - I remember this being much better on nitro. The body is gritty, then chewy. Body is viscous and full, and finishes a little bit heavy.  D - I'm don't think I'd have more than one of these in a session. The first half of the beer went down pretty quick, but the carbonation bloat and burnt flavors got a little overwhelming after that. Think I'll stick to the nitro from now on.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,cavedave,4.25,"Pure black and opaque, carries a brief dark beige head, leaving a fine knit lace on the snifter, and partial skim. Nice.  Smell is heavy on licorice, some dark caramel in there, toasty grain, some rounded yeast notes, and hints of floral and bitter behind them.  Wow, roastier in the mouth than the nose, full of licorice, dark roast malts, dark caramel, bitter coffee (almost a caffeinne bitter), some bitter chocolate. Along the way it picks up a bit of sweet, and some very light fruity notes in mid sip, then ushers in a dark, dank finish of herbal bitter and malty char (I mean this in a good way), warm, spicy hints of alcohol. Not the most complex big stout, but the flavors are very tasty, very bright, especially if you crave roastier offerings.  Low carb., not as viscous as some others, and a finish that ends up coating the mouth with a bit too much licorice residue. Not this brew's best quality rated for style.  Considering its size, dark and interesting taste, and lower than average viscosity. this brew is highly drinkable.  At this price for a growler (2 for 1 at Half Time) it is the best buy on the planet. At regular price I may revisit, maybe not.

T - Outstanding, this one lives up to the hype. It is a chocolate milkshake minus the sweetness, and still all of the great beer characteristics of a quality stout. The dark chocolate is dominant, but does not overwhelm the other characteristics of the beer like many chocolate-additive stouts do. Top notch, and I should have had another rather than trying something else... Will be buying a four-pack next time I am at the store and see this.  M - Again, milkshake-like in it's creaminess.

112,412,PhillyStyle,4.28,"On tap, at Pizzeria Paradiso (Washington DC, Dupont Circle):  Served in a cognac glass, black body with about a 3 finger mocha colored head that lasted the entire beer.  Aroma was strong, heavy roasted malt with hints of coffee, chocolate and possibly some hops, but faint. The alcohol crept in near the end of the beer.  Taste was very good, again heavy roasted malt flavor. The hops try to make their presence know for some balance, but mostly that is a losing battle. The beer finished with a nice coffee aftertaste that was very enjoyable.  Thick body, right carbonation and really easy to drink. Did get a hint of the alcohol as I got to the end.

Aroma-Chocolate and heavily roasted malt dominate mingling with some coffee aromas and a streak of citricy hops. Some alcohol creeps up towards the finish.  Taste-Bittersweet chocolate and citric hoppiness mingle with the chocolate inevitably overwhelming but not after the hops put up a good fight and ensure they leave an impact upon the flavor. There's some espresso-like flavors as well but they're not quite as pronounced as the chocolate.  Mouthfeel-Rather thin for an Imperial Stout in my honest opinion, it's not this beer's major selling point.  Drinkability-Dangerously drinkable for the ABV, pace yourself with this one as the light mouthfeel and the bittering hops can certainly disguise this beer's alcohol strength and make you forget you're drinking a 9% Imperial Stout.  Notes-Honestly, I find this beer a tad overrated; I like it, but it doesn't blow me away or anything. It's main selling point, at least to me, is it's surprising drinkability.

S - To qualify as anything above a third-tier offering, the smell is far too oxidized, along with overly pungent notes from the hop. Vague de rigueur nuances of chocolate and coffee grinds are present, as well.  T - The taste is slighty above average, but the flavor is saucy, and that isn't good in this case. The palette is of heavily roasted and oxidized malts, with suggestions of spent coffee grinds, malted milk, chocolate, spicy and herbal hops, and celery-coriander. As exciting as it sounds, it isn't.  M - I don't really like the mouthfeel. It has a nearly macro feel; it is similar to Yuengling's Black & Tan. That is the wrong territory, RIS!  D - Still a pretty solid brew, but quality-wise it is not much better than SN Pale Ale or SA Boston Lager; it is like a grocery store RIS. But the aforementioned brews are way drinkable...  If anyone feels the need to point out that comparing RIS, Pale Ale and Vienna Lager is like comparing apples, oranges and kiwis, let me save you some time. Don't.

The smell is chocolate w the slightest hint of coffee. Not overly nutty or malty / smoky like other stouts.  The taste and mouthfeel are great. It's fairly light bodied bit yet the finish is warm and memorable. The aftertaste really settles well and is probably the best quality of this beer.

112,412,deleted_user_357747,4.3,"The first real ""craft"" brew I ever had, had it in San Bernardino. This is the beer that solidified my love of RIS. However, many of my old favorite beers have been severe disappointments with a few years of beer under my belt. Let's see how this classic holds up...  A- Holy hell, would anybody expect a four finger head from a 9% abv RIS? Me neither, and yet, there it is looking at me, and this sucker had staying power. I've never seen such a head on this style, ever. Utter black, completely opaque. Like I said, a HUGE head. Dark tan, rather loose. Fairly rocky, I'm expecting decent lacing from this. This is really black.  S- Hoppier than I remember, but mostly burnt chocolate malts, spicy alcohol and a undercurrent of intense hops, maybe even some leather? Straightforward, no BS, this beer is fully loaded with three staple ingredients in huge proportions. Not very complex, but more like a black monolith of rich, burnt, bitter, woodsy smells. Could be a little stronger, too.  T- Slabs of burnt malts, bittered further by ample hopping. Incredibly warm, I can actually feel each inch of my esophagus heat up with the strength of this. Letting this beer sit on my lips without sipping creates an intense burn; is that the alcohol or the carbonation? Lesser tastes found include oak and some slight dark cherries dunked in bittersweet chocolate. Not much sweetness to be found, but the flavor definitely opens up and becomes less intense as it warms.  Bottom line; burnt malt bittersweetness, finishing on bitter hops and hot alcohol. Starts off rather aloof, but comes around after ten or fifteen minutes.  M- Starts with way too active of carbonation that adds to the initial burn, as if this beer needs any help with that. But it does chill out, becomes a little flatter, a little smoother. Not as thick as I was expecting, lighter body. Very silky, great tensile feel here.  D- Very high, considering. WHile not overly complex, this still deserves the time to sip and ponder, really take into account what this is and just how good it is. Great RIS, one of my favorite non-seasonal RISs. A real winter classic, get a bunch for your next snowstorm!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

The body was a completely opaque, visibly uncarbonated, dark brown.  S- Smells of sweet candy and roasted malts, with impressions of coffee, bittersweet chocolate, and a mild hop aroma.  T- A BIG punch of candy and roasted malts up-front on the palate. This is met with an equal punch of low-alpha hops midway, which lasts through the finish, creating a very balances flavor overall. The finish itself is dry.  M- A nice medium body- tons of moderately coarse carbonation- and a mild astringency. Could stand for some softer carbonation and a little more chewiness.  D- The moderately coarse carbonation makes this a little less drinkable than it would be otherwise... still drinks well though.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Pahn,4,"12oz bottle into Duvel tulip.  Appearance: Free pour yields a half inch tan, fizzy head that dissipates slowly leaving rings of lacing. Beer has nice legs and lacing that crawl leisurely down the side of the glass. Pours jet black and thick. Can't look much more like a Russian imperial stout than this.  Smell: From the bottle there's a burst of hops and chocolate. In the glass I get chocolaty roasted malt, some piny/floral hops, and some espresso. Aroma gets deeper and bolder as the beer warms. Really nice.  Taste: Roasted malt, coffee, and a nice hop bitterness present throughout. Finishes nutty and chocolaty. Doesn't seem to be much going on, and the flavor doesn't develop during a sip as much as it consistently gives those main components--but what *is* happening is very good. There's a great balance of flavor. The beer develops slightly more depth as it warms, but it unfortunately never gets anywhere near as interesting or luxurious as the nose. Still a solid RIS flavor.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied--pretty light for a Russian imperial stout. Carbonation is subtle but present. Finish gets to be rather hot pretty fast.  Drinkability: I'm generally in the mood for something with a bit more oomph when I'm in the mood for a RIS, but at the same time I could happily have a couple of these, despite the rather hot alcohol presence. If price is a factor, it's hard to beat a RIS of this quality for $10~ a 4pack, though I'd sooner go for Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout for a bargain stout, myself.  Old Rasputin is a solid beer, though nothing amazing. I can't see myself ever craving it, but I can definitely imagine sitting down with one and occasionally thinking, ""Ah, this is just what I needed."" It's a solid, no nonsense RIS. The mouthfeel is a little off, but it's not that big a deal. All told, it has a great balance of hops and spot-on ""big stout"" malt notes.

112,412,devilben02,3.96,"Old Rasputin is like casting Maggie Gyllenhaal to play Rachel Dawes in The Dark Knight: she wasn't a particularly sexy choice to take over the part, but was very believable in the role and gave a solid overall performance that was better than her predecessor. Similarly, Old Rasputin isn't the sexiest imperial stout to pick off the shelves, maybe because it seems to be fairly widely available and cheaper than many options in the style. When you do give it a try, though, it certainly delivers and could be considered a benchmark against which other imperial stouts are compared.  From the beginning, it has the perfect color for an imperial stout, with a deep, dark opaque black/brown color and a fluffy mocha-colored cap. The aroma is likewise a terrific example of what an imperial stout should smell like, with notes of dark bittersweet chocolate and heavily roasted malts. The flavor is also packed with dark chocolate, malts that are roasted to the point of charring, and a dark caramel sweetness. The body is a bit thin, but it is smooth and warming.

112,412,Chico1985,4.5,"Good ol Old Rasputin. I have had this many times, finally time to review. Pours pitch black with a very nice 2-finger beige head that is like a rock, the retention is great, stays good-looking the whole time. It looks like a sand dune on top. Leaves nice clean walls of lacing. Excellent smells of rich dark chocolate. In the taste however it seems to lean more towards highly roasted malts, coffee with a bit of cream, with chocolate floating in the aftertaste. A bit of hops and wood taste swim around in there as well. Nice mouthfeel I'd expect from the style, maybe a bit too much carbonation for my tastes. Drinkability is very good, no/very little alcohol taste, price is good for the quality. A classic Russian Imperial Stout.  **more notes - 3/14/15**  Drinking a 5-year old bottle - one from the same 4-pack as this original review awesomely enough! I still love me some Old Rasputin. Pretty much the classic American RIS with no barrels or adjuncts needed. Based on aging experiments, I'd say this beer is probably best enjoyed on the fresher side, but 4-packs are pretty inexpensive, so if you're into cellaring I say go for it. This 5-year old bottle is still nicely carbonated, tamed, retains decent depth and is super smooth, goes down extremely easy. Wish I had a fresh bottle to compare but this is a nice treat.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,ryanonline,4.63,"This beer is black as black gets, with a rocky thin head with moderate retention and great lacing. Looks very bubbly odd for an imperial Russian.  Smells like a delicious espresso with raisins and hops and chocolate.  Taste is the same but with the hops up front and the chocolate-espresso flavor in the finish. Sort of fruity too.  The mouthfeel is bubbly and syrupy, with a thick body. Very dry finish.  This is incredibly drinkable for a RIS. Its got a little bit much on the carbonation but otherwise it has nice body and doesn't hurt the palette to much.  Wow, I'm really impressed with old Rasputin. Its been a while since I've had stones' Russian imperial but if memory serves this ranks up there.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,wesbrownyeah,4.32,"Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout...9% alcohol. Had this before but reviewing this time to later compare to OR XII.  A- Pours an opaque black fluid that produces a light half inch tan head. Leaves decent lacing on glass. With as much alcohol as this one packs light head and slick lacing is expected.  S- Heavy does of expresso and coffee upfront with light scents of chocolate and tree nuts. Sweet malty hints hit the back of the nose.  T-M- Taste is creamy with bold flavors of black coffee, smoked oak chips, sweet malts and a hidden but there alcohol warmth. Well rounded taste that is lightly carbonated allowing all the flavors to roll over the tongue with a creamy mouthfeel and beautiful heat.  D- I will be revisiting this well rounded stout.

If people think that Guiness looks good, they should take a gander at this.  S- Large amounts of roasted malts present with a coffee background and somewhat of a bitter chocolate finish. Alcohol is present, but not overpowering as I find usual with good Russian Imperial Stout.  T- Wow, this beer takes the ordinary Old Rasputin and puts it on steroids for me. Would rather give this somewhere between a 4.5 and a 5 as I feel the need to show what I think is a better beer. Roasted malts and a coffee taste dominate with dark, smooth chocolate finishing out the rear. Just enough kick from the hops to make this an excellent beer.  M- Cannot get much better than this. Full bodied and chewy mouthfeel with a much more fluid and smooth body provided from the nitrogen. Cannot emphasize how smooth this beer is and the degree it adds to every sip.  D- Before I knew it, I looked down to see this beer already gone, and wanting much more.

No light passing through this beer. 2 finger mocha tan colored head that leaves lacing down the sides of the glass as I drink.  S- Nice semi-sweet chocolate roast malts in the front end of this. Light coffee notes come and go along with some light anise notes coming and going. Alcohol in the tail end of the nose but nothing too overwhelming.  T- Semi-sweet chocolate notes mix with some heavy roasted malts in the front of the taste. Some light coffee mixes in taking place of the chocolate toward the middle. Light hints of something with toasted oak in this as well....I might be searching too hard for this though. Alcohol in the tail end a little heavier than in the aroma.  M- Heavy mouthfeel. Carbonation is good with the style. Roasted malts left on the palate along with some light alcohol in the aftertaste. Oil slickness left everywhere in the mouth. Clean tasting with some crisp roasted flavors.  D- This is a very good...ok it's a greast year around beer that I can't get enough of.

112,412,sisuspeed,4.35,"Pulling out an old favorite to review tonight.  Poured into a Foothills signature glass. Nice black body with a thin tan head on top. Gentle lacing down the glass.  Dark roasted malts on the nose mixed with anise, chocolate and a touch of alcohol. Big, roasty, sweet aroma.  Ah yes... this is the flavor that turned me onto Russian Imperials. Lots of roasted dark malt, sweet chocolate notes, anise and hints of wood. Alcohol is faintly noted, but mostly just adds some warming.  For a fairly mass produced RIS, North Coast has done a great job of keeping the body decently thick, smooth and velvety, just like an RIS should be. Carbonation is on the lower side, which is perfect for the style.  Drinkability is very good. This is an excellent RIS for the beginner or the stout connoisseur. Lots of flavor, but very smooth. Alcohol is fairly well hidden. Always a pleasure to drink.  Overall, I've had this beer many times and every time it's excellent. Not only is this RIS well crafted, but North Coast has the quality control down pat. Never a bad bottle. Even with the large surge in new RIS's and special release RIS's hitting the market, Rasputin still manages to hold it's own; and for the price it is often a better beer. Old Raspy will always be a classic. Never say die.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,drabmuh,4.16,"""A dear friend is not to be found instantly.""  OK, I'll finally review this beer. I've had this on draft, in the bottle, aged, fresh, on cask, under nitro, this particular incarnation is a relatively new bottle. Poured into a snifter.  Beer is black and forms a 1 finger head of brown medium bubbles. Head leaves lacing on the glass. Carbonation is a mystery. Looks good for an RIS. BTW, I love the label of this beer.  Aroma is slightly sweet with some roast, overall its a little weak.  Full bodied and really smooth. Nice roast character at the back some sweetness up front. Coffee and roast. Finishes cleanly but there is a lingering bitterness. Nice palate connectivity, carbonation adds body but not any sourness. Overall its a wonderful beer. As far as availability and price, its hard to miss out on Old Raspy.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

S: Smells of roasted coffee and a little chocolate. Not overwhelming at all.  T: Coffee rolls over the tongue followed by roasted malt and a bit of burnt toast, though not nearly as flavorful as it could be. The 9% is very well hidden and overall balanced though.  M: The carbonation is present and keeps this a little thinner in the mouth than I like, but hides the alcohol and is still nice overall.  D: I liked this beer, and would keep some around especially at it's price point. I just don't think it's among the top of the RIS list, but it is still well above average.

112,412,Bolendak,4.29,"At first sight I couldn't imagine why anyone would want to pay nearly ten dollars for a four pack of 12 oz bottles of this beer. However, after taking home some Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout, I was pleasantly surprised by this North Coast Brew. It had a very nutty and dark smell with very low carbonation. I really enjoyed drinking this beer and after finishing all of them, I quickly realized why they only come in a four pack. As an NC native, I drink a lot of Duck Rabbit Milk Stout and I found Old Rasputin to be kind of a heavier thicker version of duck rabbit.

Just a touch of bitterness on the finish, although hard to tell from the hops or coffee. Alcohol is present with a some warming, but not too boozie.  M: Little high on the carbonation. Mouth feel is big, think, but not too 'syrupy'. In style, except for a touch much carbonation.  D: Very nice RIS. Good sipper or drinker.

The mouthfeel is quite full and balanced. Good levels of carbonation make this quite an easy sipping beer.  Overall I really really enjoyed this beer.

112,412,stoutmasterjames,4.67,"Now I'm a fledgling beer reviewer, so don't be too hard on me. I judge a beer mostly on taste and that's why Old Rasputin gets so many high marks from me. The smell of this stuff is great too. I can't resist taking a wiff when I crack open a bottle. The taste is complex, full, chocolatey, hint of strong black coffee. Finish a tad dry, but the suggestion of sweet in the beginning more than compensates for this. Mouthfeel wonderful, might be the high APV that gives it a wee bit of listerine intensity. I can drink these all day long. As an enjoyer of stouts, this beer strikes me as highly drinkable though not everyone will share this opinion. It is worth note that after about three or four bottles you can look at the label and almost see Rasputin working his wicked magics upon you. All and all this is a stellar beer, one of my personal faves that no fan of stouts should pass up without giving it a try. High APV always a plus in my book too. 9% Hot diggity!

Rather light for a RIS and that really detracts from the beer in my opinion.  D: Good roasty aromas and flavors and not much alcohol in the nose or taste.

Aroma: Rich and roasty malt, bittersweet chocolate, black coffee, dark fruit, a splash of citrusy hops, and a good dose of alcohol.  Flavor: As the aroma promised, this has a huge malt body. The malt features lots of chocolaty, deep-roasted, smoky, and dark fruit notes. Accompanying the malt are citrusy, juicy, and mildly bitter hops that keep everything balanced rather well. Bittersweet chocolate and bitter hops in the finish.  Mouthfeel: A velvety medium-full body with smooth medium-bodied carbonation and some moderate warmth from the alcohol. Dries nicely in the finish.  Drinkability: Drinks a little faster than many Imperial Stouts, though still a bit of a sipper.

The labelling is beautiful in my humble opinion.  s - it smells just as an RIS should. Toasty with hints of dark fruits. The scents volatize quickly.  t - Most RIS's lack a nutty quality. This beer is exceptional in that it captures it. The roasted flavor is wonderful with all of the requisite coffee and chocolate flavors. Another exceptional quality is that they've managed to eliminate any burnt flavor and still keep all of the good dark malt character. There is some slight bitterness from the roasted malt, but it is there as a complement to the overall taste. It's not a ""bad"" bitterness, for what it's worth.  m - tongue coating and full bodied. Mild carbonation, yet it's not ""sticky""  d - appropriate for style.  Overall, an exceptional beer and an outstanding example of the style.

S: The aroma of bitter chocolate, malt and somewhere in the background some alcohol.  T: For such a study looking brew, this one is not as heavy as it might seem. Robust malts and bitter chocolates dominate the taste, along with a minor alcohol bite at the end. Warming, and very drinkable.  M: A bit chalky, and somewhat warming in that alcohol bite, but just mildly. Stout mouthfeel for a stout.  D: Bold and hardy brew that defies it's own name by being a highly drinkable stout.

Undertones of coffee, brown sugar. Very impressive.  Deep dark roasty flavor. Just like espresso on the finish. Alcohol politely announces its presence. Definitely has some bite to it.  A beer to chew on, but not in the softest way. Slightly grating, but not quite bitter. Nice low to moderate carbonation.  Always a classic, but seems like age hasn't helped it (besides the nose).

A: Pours pitch black with no visible light coming through. Whatsoever. Filled up with thin, quickly-fading head that leaves a thorough layer of lacing across the glass.  S: Chocolate! Wow, I know it's been a while since I've had a Raspy, but I don't ever remember smelling this much chocolately goodness! Almost like a creamy, milk chocolate, that leaves some subtle roasty scents as it fades. Mmm...  T: Yum. Taste abounds with flavor everywhere. Nice bitter, dark chocolate up front, following by mild coffee, dark fruits (plums, cherries, etc.), and huge roasted barley. Everything blends so well, each flavor just complementing the next. Grand.  M: This beer is incredibly smooth, the only issue is that it is just ever so slightly off on each degree. It could stand a hint more body, a hint less carbonation, and a hint less bitterness.

S-Slight cholate smell, slighlty creamy smell, slightttly.  T-This was slightly aged. Initial taste of chocolate with a slight bitterness. Alcohol hits slightly on the nose after it goes down. Almost a vanilla extract taste. Leaves a great after taste, still tasting the beer after it was drank. More and more alcohol hit towards the final three or so drinks.  MF- Thick and creamy like your drinking a melted milk shake almost. About as enjoyable as a R.I.S should be in feel.  D- Very drinkable...

This is beautiful looking beer, black with a thick tan head that gets very uneven at the top, rather bumpy. The head is strong, lasts a decent time, doesn't disappear like some beers. Grabs to the side of my pint glass.  Smell was actually rather weak, but a slight chocolate scent, very pleasant. The taste is rather brilliant, this is a very balanced beer with little alcohol taste, especially for a 9% beer. Slight chocolate flavor to it, much like the scent. Feels great in the mouth, slightly thick and lingers for a bit.

Thin but foamy tan head, soft gauzy lacing.  Smells of dark chocolate & roast coffee, mild booze, with a marshmellow sweetness backing it up.  Taste is rich & complex: smooth chocolate & caramel up front, quickly turns roasted & slightly bitter, then rounds out & become sweet & creamy like chocolate meringues. Alcohol brings some heat. Ends up very toasty & even in the aftertaste -- full of flavor without wearing out the tastebuds.  Mouthfeel is smooth & creamy, full-bodied. Some heat & bite from the booze.

112,412,OnThenIn,4.2,"Appearance: A finger of dark tan head on top of a beautiful ebony beer. Lacing is left behind and the head dissipates slowly.  Smell: Big roasty aroma with malt sweetness in the background. A bit of coffee aroma and some chocolate as well. There is a tiny bit of dark fruit, like raisin apparent.  Taste: The flavor is very rounded and well mixed. There is a bitter roastyness to the finish, but through there is almost a oatmeal stout like flavor. The sweet malt is really balanced by the roast bitterness and there is a certain dark chocolate flavor to the beer. There is a bit of caramel flavor, which plays nicely with the chocolate, forming a coffee like flavor. Really enjoyable.  Mouthfeel: The beer has a good amount of carbonation and a big full body. There is a certain smooth, silky feeling to the beer. It is definietly a sipper.  Drinkability: This beer is rather interesting. It has the mouthfeel of a huge killer RIS, but at 9% abv has a lower abv than quite a few examples of the style. I am not saying that it is sessionable by any means, but it is really nice to be able to not have to resort to a beer above 10% if I want an RIS.

112,412,4000qtrap,4.35,"Source/Serving: Draft, 25cl  Smell: Chocolate and coffee that comes off as very lively rather than dark and somber. Toasted grains are prominent, rather than being too burnt or roasty which is unique. Also some orange oil essence and slight tobacco notes. Raisin appears as it warms and some overripe, washed rind cheese.  Taste: Incredibly intense flavors. Overall pretty dry with burnt espresso bean characteristics. 4 flavor stages . At first its very smooth and creamy like many stouts. Then the flavor accelerates becoming quite bitter and highly reminiscent of eating lightly dark chocolate malt dipped espresso beans. There are some caramelized malt notes in there too that balance nicely. Then there is a brief wave of one of the best coffee flavors in a beer I've ever had. This then progresses to an even more bitter but also very dry stage with pleasantly bitter, roasty caramelized malt profile that is delightful and intense. Lingers forever.  Notes: This beer is driven by dry espresso flavors that are simply delicious. However its not too dry so as to hurt drinkability. The roast flavors, bitterness, and sweetness all work to enhance one another and is very delicious.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

A bit fruity and sweet on the front-end, which is nice. Flavor stays with you for a while.  M: Thick and creamy. Carbonation slightly above average, but fine. Slightly astringent. Heavy body.

112,412,pnkHoody,4.08,"After drinking the XII version a while back, picking this up was a no-brainer - especially as I found it at $9.95 for a four-pack in a Victoria government liquor store (sometimes the darnedest beers turn up in BC).  This is my third bottle. Anxious about reports of a non-existent head, my first bottled was poured from 6 inches with vigorous swirling, and I ended up with the stout equivalent of an Ibiza Foam Party. This third bottle was poured on the cautious side of usual, but still produced a thick three inches of head that diminished to half a finger that stayed throughout. Lacing is thick and permanent, and it looks beautiful for it.  This smells lighter than many imperial stouts (Peche Mortel and XII are my benchmarks, however, and they are very robust) and yeast is prominent. As well as familiar burned tones, there's a deep woody odor reminiscent of an old school desk.  It's more effervescent than other RIS I've had, which explains the head. It really blooms in the mouth -- which is a bit too much at first, but it settles down after a few sips. The taste is sensational. It is very bitter, but more charcoal than hops. It avoids the sweetness many RIS ride upon, delivering 75% cocoa chocolate, powerful molasses, and baking-soda astringency.  The beer is far less complex than the XII, which makes me reflect on how beautiful that beer really was. But at this price, this is a sensational RIS that makes no mistakes. I will buy a lot of this, especially as Peche Mortel is all gone and Brooklyn Brewery Chocolate Imperial Stout is harder to come by in BC recently...",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,BuckeyeOne,4.25,"I don't know what took me so long to try this brew once I started exploring RIS. Could it have been the 12 oz. bottles? I think every other RIS I had previous to Old Rasputin was a bomber or, in a few cases, a special release like The Abyss, etc. Could I have been looking down my nose at that 4-pack of Old Rasputin tucked in with the IPAs, pale ales, and the like and thought, ""It's just some run-of-the-mill beer""? If I was thinking this, shame on me.  It poured dark and oily with a nice chocolatey looking head. I instinctively let it warm just a bit after taking a bottle from the refrigerator. It smelled like molasses with just the hint of cloves. It tasted like milk chocolate, tobacco, and dried fruits. With the smell and first sip, I expected a syrupy mouthfeel. I was wrong --- damned brain. It had a medium body with just the right amount of carbonation.  Is there alcohol in this RIS? Couldn't taste it at all. I drank 3 of them right off.

This beer has introduced me to the wonderful complexity and taste of craft beers.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass, it appears pitch black. A wonderful, toffee colored head develops about two finger widths thick, and dissipates into a creamy top that lingers to the last drop.  Smells of chocolate and malt. Taste is much of the same with a slight hazelnutty, biscutty taste in there as well. Not much in the way of hops, but I prefer the malt taste anyway.  Mouthfeel is medium, definitely not thin, but not syrupy either. Just right imo. You don't really notice the alcohol so much in the taste, but it sneaks up on you a little bit and leaves you with a nice warm relaxed feeling.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Smell was malty and strong and taste matched the smell perfectly. It's one of those beers that tastes pretty familiar, but it's just done very well and drinks super clean and super smooth. Unlike most stouts, this one didn't annoyingly linger in my mouth after swallowed. Some of these beers will do that and basically ""film"" in your mouth for a bit. This one didn't. If you like a stout, this one might be as good and consistant a stout as I've ever tried. Great beer.

Beautiful mocha head with a tight bead comes from a moderately forceful pour. Head reduced to clinging lace after a minute or so. Great looking beer.  S: Dark fruit. Slightly boozy. I'm not picking up much, but this beer is still a bit cold. As the beer warms the raisiny scents yield to lighter, sweeter fruits. Candied apple and pear make an appearance.  T: Big & bold. Exactly what one would expect given the look and smell of this beer. So much flavor that its difficult to isolate specifics...very complex. Wonderful black coffee bitterness in the finish.  M: Poorly executed RIS's have a thin, spirit-like feel...Old Raspy does not. Fulfilling. Carbonation is spot on. Each sip begs for another.  D: This is a big beer, but I think it drinks exactly as it should. Alcohol isn't hidden, but it doesn't feel hotter than it should, either.  Great representation of the style. A classic that is oft overlooked b/c of the hype surrounding so many others in this class. When it comes to RIS, Raspy is a beer by which others should be measured.

Appearance: Pitch black body with a tall, dense, pile of brown foam on top. Head retention is a m a z i n g. While I've always loved the look of Old Rasputin, I've never seen one quite like this. The nitro does some pretty incredible things for it. Great lacing. Fantastic colors. Perfect!  Smell: Tons of roasted malt and dark chocolate with milder suggestions of coffee, pine, lactose, floral hops, and fruity esters.  Taste: Roasted malt, dark chocolate, black coffee, dulled pine, and mild burnt notes. Very roasty and robust with solid, long-lasting bitterness. Pretty intense. The nitro seems to make it roastier than normal. I like.  Mouthfeel: I think I might like this on plain CO2 better. This version is softer and creamier, but I actually miss the bite.

112,412,willPS21,4.85,"This RI stout is fantastic. The drinkability is probably higher than almost any RIS or IS or IPA I've had, or should I say any beer of 8.1%+. I like the bitterness and tang which separates it from most RI's, there is a crisper finish to me and a hint of welcome metallic tones. It almost seems like someone added a few tablespoons of Newcastle to this one. Additionally, there's a bit of sweetness which comes in the form of distinctive carmel. The texture in the mouth is a bit less viscous than the Stone, my permanent reference point, but also a bit less round and unified. Again one could say mouthfeel is heading towards Newcastle or even Guiness ever so slightly (and just slight enough). Besides that rare nutty-metallic tang, Rasputin has lovely dark malty flavors with the coffee/chocolate/toffee somewhere and just enough herbal notes to round it off. It's rare that a beer can avoid overdoing the hoppy and floral tones to my liking while still including them, and this one does it to perfection. If you're a fan of floral tones, I've noticed those flavors are more pronounced as you approach room temperature, where the beer seems more oily and chewy.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

S: Nice bouquet of chocolate, espresso, coffee, roasted malt, and dark chocolate. Good aroma , but subtle at times.  T: Flavor profile consisting of chocolate, coffee, espresso, dark bitter chocolate, and some faint citrus hops.  M: Great amount of creaminess and fullness with appropriately low carbonation. Silky and smooth.  D: This is a beer I could drink all day and considering its competitive price, this is a great value. The 9% abv. is hidden in taste, but it is still there.

The way I prefer RIS beers - the pitch black ones tend to be a little too ""much"" - past ideal, perhaps. I got an inch and half of very toasty colored foam that never dissipated completely - which is interesting for the style and ABV. Lots of sticky lacing all over the glass.  Malty, malty, malty. As I told my mom, this is one malty monster. Yum. Rich chocolate and prunes on the nose. Some coffee is coming through as well, dark roasted flavors as well. Nice.  I'm very pleased with this beer - the North Coast stuff is hard to get where I live, and their reputation precedes it. For good reason. Mostly dense coffee flavors - black roast, mild toasted - and some chocolate on the finish. Little hints of prunes that comes out as it warms - and I want to say there's a tiny hint of cinnamon, but that could just be some of the warm toast that makes me think of cinnamon toast... There's a very clean finish, but the flavors linger for a significant amount of time. Well balanced beer with great flavor development.  Here's the cool part. I love the carbonation in this beer. It brings to mind the idea of eating toast because of the crispness, but also makes this beer slightly lighter in body than many RIS beers. I guess you could argue it's slightly out of style - but, hell, it makes it so good. A beer this big that makes your mouth feel refreshed. Yes.  Great beer. I want more.

T: Very nice, some bitter hop and roasted malt flavor that finishes a touch sweet. You also get a hit of alcohol at the end. Not overpowering at all.  M: It fills your mouth and goes down smooth. I would have liked a thicker taste but it's not bad. Carbonation is on the low side and works well.  D: I like this beer but the higher ABV would probably keep me from having more than a few at a time. I could see this one going well with a nice steak dinner.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,TCgoalie,4.25,"Poured a thick midnight with slightly tan head upon rigorous pour. The head quickly dissipated to form at the edge of the glass.  I smell roasted grains and bready sweet caramel. Add a touch of whiskey, and the smell is complete.  The creaminess of this beer is excellent. The first taste brings about a slight sour rasin taste followed by roasted barley molasses mixed with whiskey sweetness. The aftertaste lingers burnt barley and mild hops.  I love the creaminess of the beer and the stickiness. It takes a few tongue whisks around the mouth to get rid of the residue.  This beer is for the sip not the chug. Enjoy one of these and move on to something else. Two would be too much flavor.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Hojaminbag,4.18,"Old Rasputin has a body that is very dark brown with hints of ruby around the edges. The head is a light brown behemoth. Three fingers in height, super creamy, great retention, all of which ends in thick, sticky lacing on the side of my glass.  The aroma is nice; bitter chocolate, some roasted scents, a touch of coffee. Maybe a bit of dark fruit and some heat from the alcohol also.  The flavor is sweeter than I expected, leading off with flavors of molasses and chocolate. Old Rasputin is packed with chocolate actually. The malts have also been roasted with a vengeance, making the roasted flavors pop up here and there. Underneath those flavors are a touch of fruitiness, coffee, anise and a bit of alcohol induced warmth that tingles the back of your nose. The finish has a pretty liberal dose of bitter hops, and the hops are really the flavor that hangs around in the after taste.  The body is big, thick, creamy, and has just the right amount of carbonation. Overall, Old Rasputin has a great mouthfeel.  Old Rasputin disappeared from my glass much more quickly than a stout this big should, which qualifies it as dangerously drinkable.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

S- not a lot of aroma, but there's definitely chocolate, caramel, and toffee in there, all with a distinct roasted character.  T- delicious. Bitter, roasted nuts and toffee with hints of coffee, the back of my palate really enjoys this beer. Taste is long and lingering.  M- great mouthfeel, too. Not too heavy, but certainly an in-your-face, up front feeling. It's almost chewy, but in a very good way.  D- drinkable, yes, but not excessively so. I've had RISs that were smoother; Old Rasputin's mouthfeel and taste make me rather savour this one.

112,412,CharlatanSin,4.31,"Very much looking forward to trying it. I'm on a real RIS kick right now, and this is supposed to be one of the best. Glad to buy a bottle. This beautiful beer pours a jet black, with a perfect half inch smooth tan head. It leaves wave after wave of lacing. Close to perfect.  The smell is not at all unpleasant, just a little...missing. I pick up some chocolate malt, and some toasted espresso; the expected smells. But it's a fishing expedition. This is the one area where the beer doesn't stand up to some of its colleagues. The taste, however, is damn good. Tastes like a chocolate covered roasted espresso bean. There's a nice, roasted, astringent bitterness. The alcohol is present, but it's subdued and complementary.  Rasputin is super smooth, creamy, and incredibly thick. You're almost chewing it. The carbonation is a tad high for the style, unfortunately, which stops it from being perfect. Still, easily one of the most, if not THE most drinkable RIS I've sampled. I'll certainly be conferring with the old Russian mystic again.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Smells much like dark fruits, some brown sugar, and coffee. Also some caramel and toffee notes.  Taste was very much coffee and chocolate. Alot of smokiness in there and some oak in the finish. Very delicious.  Mouthfeel was slightly syrupy and did a good job of coating the palate.

I liked the pour a lot, and the color of the head against the almost black liquid made the bubbles sparkle against the glass after every drink.  The smell wasn't very strong, but was good.  The taste was great. Very rich and solid. You could taste the alcohol, but not in a bad way. This was really an ideal beer to take slow and enjoy on a cold day.

112,412,r0nyn,4.3,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Bottled in '09.  Looks thick and substantial right out of the bottle, inky blackness that obscures all light. A straight pour produces a thick brownish head that leaves a lot of lacing and never really dissipates. Lots of barley and malt in the smell, along with a very, very distinct aroma of dark chocolate. Quite enticing.  Big malty kick right off the start, followed by the chocolate flavoring that was a big part of the smell. Transitions into a slight bitterness, but not as potent as compared to other Russian Imperial Stouts I've had. Finishes off with a tempered alcoholic twinge, not too overpowering, but it lingers well enough into the aftertaste to let you know it's there. Mouthfeel is full and weighty on the tongue, creamy and nice. Not a lot of carbonation, which suits me just fine.  Drinkability is great for a beer of this type. I could easily have a couple more, provided I have an entire night to drink it in. The alcohol is masked well enough and the beer itself is so tasty that it'd be easy to just keep going. This is quite a tasty brew, something I look forward to having again.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

And this place, a holy beacon for a traveler stranded in Lincoln ...  But I digress. The first beer I ordered was Old Rasputin. Not sure why I haven't picked this up yet. I truthfully was unaware it was so easy to find in my hometown, Chicago.  A beautiful pour - dark chocolate with a toasty tan topper. A gorgeous beer, smelling strongly of chocolate with a hints of coffee and fruit esters.  The first sip is eye-opening as this is a big beer wit great coffee and enormous chocolate notes right up front. It also possesses an amazing hoppy front and a velvety smooth finish. I kid you not, this is so thick and full it tastes like dirt would taste if dirt tasted good.

112,412,teovaldi,4.6,"Pours pitch black with a small light brown head. Incredible amounts of lacing.  Coffee, coffee and more coffee mixed with dark chocolate and some malts in there as well. A bit of sweetness and alcohol comes as the beer warms. Exceptional smell!  Lots and lots of coffee up front, bitter chocolate with some malts. Finishes slightly bitter/boozy but very nice.  Thick, vicious, velvety, almost creamy mouthfeel. Very nice and also much better on tap versus bottled.  While this is thick and vicious you hardly taste the alcohol at all.

I don't know if I was just messed up from the HopSlam I just drank, but this Old Raspy looked simply magical.  Smells of rich malt, coffee, nuts, alcohol and chocoLOT, I mean a lot. Also a nice fruit and hop presence that flares the nostrils.  Deeee-licious! Perfect balance of the espresso, cocoa and alcohol. Some mocha and dark fruits - just the lightest touch. Malty, warm, roasted, indulgent, sweet and bitter - Old Rasputin hits on all cylinders.  Medium to full bodied, moderate amount of carbonation.  Old Rasputin is my quintessential Russian Imperial Stout. It defines the style and does it with flying colors.

112,412,feelmefoam,4.28,"Old Raspy pours a dark, opaque black color with no visibility through it at all, even when held up to the light. This does put up a two finger mocha colored head covered in pockmarked foam that leaves giant rings of sticky lacing all around the glass.  Dark, slightly bitter chocolate is evident in the nose. It surrounds the other aromas of dark roasted barley malts and earthy hoppiness, as well as some coffee.  Bittersweet chocolate, bitter and earthy hops, a bit of black coffee, and a smoky, toasty malt flavor makes this quite an interesting taste experience. A little sweet up front with a drying, almost nutty bitterness in the finish. Definitely big on flavor.  The mouthfeel is very good, just what I like for a Russian Imperial Stout. Big, thick, creamy, but this one throws in that drying finish to make it a little extra special. Has very little carbonation, but it still hides the 9% ABV pretty well. Very well done.  Overall, this is a solid, flavorful RIS that not only brings good looks to the table, it has the flavor to back it up. The drinkability takes a slight hit because of the 9%, but other than that this is a damn tasty stout that is easy to appreciate.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Appearance: Pours an opaque plum with a fluffy finger of chocolate head and a sheet of fine lacing that glitters down the side of the glass as it's drunk, leaving minuscule traces of where it's been on the side of the glass. The head disappears in the first few minutes and leaves a very still top with wisps of chocolate foam on the top. Very fine carbonation bubbles can be seen near the top of the pour going into the head. Not half bad for the ABV.  Smell: Smells dark, with dark chocolate, wood, smoke, and earth notes. Slight cherry and raisin notes, along with a hint of anise and vanilla syrup. A bit metallic.  T: Dark fruits tempered with heavy coffee and a roasted nutty flavor along with burnt toast. Initially quite hot and with coffee and hops aftertaste. Creamy and slightly minty and sweet as it warms.  Mouthfeel: Very light and fine carbonation bubbles in a very heavy beer. Nice and creamy.

Also getting a bit of chocolate in the taste, but not really tasting the alcohol which is nice.  m - Rich and creamy, with very little carbonation.

112,412,Seanstoppable,3.93,"Another North Coast product that is available locally. One of the more expensive ones, but I decided to treat myself around Christmas.  Pours an inky black color that almost seems to swallow the light. Plenty of thick head that is a chocolaty color. Head has quite a bit of staying power, and leaves plenty of lacing on the glass.  A hint of alcohol is detectable in the nose, not surprising given its high ABV. A hint of chocolate malts is also present.  Flavor starts out with a hint of chocolate, then a hint of alcohol, and then is washed out by dark chocolate and toasted nuts. Some coffee flavoring as well, but not the dominant flavor. Alcohol flavor is present throughout, but is on the periphery, rather than a main component. It is the nutty flavor that stands out and lingers most.  Generally not a stout fan, but this is a very good example of one. Not something I would drink all night, but good for an occasional indulgement.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Torps,4.2,"Pours a rough, mocha two finger head. Nothing extraordinary. The head dissipated rather quickly and left a modest amount of lacing. Very dark brew as is expected for a RIS.  Aroma is very nice. Dark chocolate, and espresso. Sweet, and malty. Tinge of metallic lingers as does the apparent ABV.  This is a very pleasant RIS. I'm not a big fan of certain RIS's that dominate too much with coffee flavors. Old Raspy is very balanced.  Mouthfeel is chewy and the carbonation is spot on. Nothing to detract from the experience of this fine RIS.  There is no date on the bottle so I can't say whether this is fresh or not but I'll certainly be saving a couple bottles for aging.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,icetraxx,4.13,"A: Pours a 7-finger or so head that dissipates into an extremely creamy 3 finger head over time. The massive head was probably due to my quick pouring action. The head lasts the entire beer, even if you drink it slowly. The beer appears to be as black as the night.  S: Caramel, fruity hops, molasses, and roasted malt dominate the aroma. This beer is nicely aromatic thanks to the 9% ABV.  T: The taste starts slightly sweet and a caramely with a nice kick of fruity hops. The flavor quickly becomes hoppy bitter and finishes with a dry hoppy crispness. The first few sips reveal a lingering bitter tongue. The alcohol is very well hidden for 9% ABV. No dark fruits, complexity generally suffers.  M: Thick & creamy, perfectly carbonated.  D: High for the style, and definitely high for 9% ABV. Be careful, this one could get you in trouble.

112,412,FeDUBBELFIST,3.82,"Poured into a pint glass. The bottle bears no date but the label is classic.  A: Pretty decent creamy head, very brown in color, about 1.5 fingers thick. It lasted for the entire beer; I love when that happens. High expectations for lacing were met, covering the walls of my pint glass in sheets. The body was dark black (as if that makes any sense) and completely opaque.  S: Very heavy malt character, somewhere in between roasted and burnt. Cocoa is the dominating aroma. As with many of my favorite RISs, this one has a distinguishable hop presence, albeit light, but I pick up on some grass, pine and an intriguing lemony tarragon note. Fantastic. So far. Something weird going on with the yeast, which is heavy and soapy in the first place, (not that I ever minded that), but there is an out of place meaty/briny/olivey note that I never smelled before. It wasn't completely off putting but odd nonetheless. Plus a little hot in the nose.  T: Good thing the yeast didn't translate directly to the palate, which I found to be on par with, if not quite nice for a RIS. Noticeable alcohol, woody & smokey with some tobacco, tar and black licorice. There is a long drawn out finish, moderately bitter and salty at the same time with a mineral component as well.  M: Full body, thick, chewy texture with a pleasantly dry finish. This beer becomes especially creamy as the temperature rises plus a few swirls to wear the effervescence out. This one finishes a little warm.  D: A very drinkable RIS, this one will not rock the boat.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

In fact, the first sip released a pleasant carbonation feel right on the tip of the tongue, which was a really nice surprise. However, the smoothness I first felt gave way to the stronger characteristics of the beer with repeated sips. By the end of the glass, the beer was feeling rather heavy.  D: Upon first sip, I felt like cracking open another bottle before I was even finished with the first. There's a lot going on here that I'm sure I didn't even catch this round of trying the beer (this was my second time trying Old Rasputin). Upon finishing my glass, however, I found one bottle to be more than enough.  Verdict: Overall it's really good, but due to the heavy feeling of the beer, a 4-pack of Old Rasputin could probably last me a week instead of a night. Some beers beg you to finish them all in one sitting, but patience seems to be a virtue with the few Russian Imperial Stouts I've tried.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

S: Alcohol on the nose, slightly masked by raisins, espresso and vanilla notes.  T: Molasses body with espresso coffee, red wine, dark chocolate and subtle grapes. Alcohol burn on the finish.  D: Hard to recommend having more than like two of these bad boys at 9% ABV. I was feeling it after one, because it goes down easy.  Value: I paid around $2.79 for a single 12oz bottle which I'd say is a bargain.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Smell - Espresso, bakers chocolate roasted malt, moderate hops  Taste - Espresso notes, chocolate cake, and a good balance between malt and hops. Hidden alcohol in taste, but reminds you it's there going down. A very very good example of this style!  Mouthfeel - Creamy and decadent, which is quite fitting with the other flavors of course  Drinkability - Quite high for a 9% beer, but not a pounder by any means either.  Overall - Delicious.

112,412,goldbot,4.32,"Undated (as far as I can tell) 12 oz bottle. Purchased in December 2009.  Pours a thick, deep brown to black with thin nutty brown head. The head is retained pretty well, with a small amount of lacing.  This surprised me at first with a very earthy, floral aroma. This was followed quickly with some dark chocolate and loads of fruit scents. Some nice roasted coffee as well. Overall a very complex nose on this one.  Taste was lots of roast coffee, balanced by a nice dry bitterness, from hops I suppose. More dark chocolate. There is not so much fruit as there was in the smell. Finishes dry with some more bitterness. As the beer warms, the alcohol heat becomes more prevalent in the finish.  The feel is thick and creamy. Medium to full body, with some nice crispness from the carbonation.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Probably the most chocolaty smelling beer I have sampled. Taste is a nice fairly complex balance between dominating chocolate and coffee, with mild alcohol and vanilla notes.  Mouthfeel is crisp carbonation to start, certainly not too much, It warms my tongue and has a smooth thick finish.

Surely there are more elite stouts out there that I have not yet found but it may just bet hat this has everything that I look for in a stout. It has a rich flavor with a slight dark chocolate taste that resonates on your tongue for quite a while after finishing. IT isn't quite sweet but it isn't overly bitter either.

Chocolate, roasted malts, creamy goodness.  Taste is just the bees knees. Sweet chocolate, bitter dark chocolate, roasted malts all mixed in immaculate proportions. Bitterness only accentuates the sweetness. Holy cow, this is so smooth! Rasputin was one of the first RIS's I ever had and, on nitro tap, it's hands down the purest example of perfect RIS flavor and balance I've ever had.

Nothing to complain too loudly about.  D: The ABV will catch up with you before you get tired of drinking this one. Excellent beer!

It has a nutty finish with a slightly hoppy bitterness.  Well-carbonated RIS that feels silky and thick.  Extremely tasty and drinkable. You feel the alcohol more than you can taste it.

The aroma is full of dried fruit and bitter dark malts with chocolaty undertones. The mouthfeel is thick and velvety everything you are looking for in a RIS. The taste starts with roasty malts and smooths to a clean finish with a residual sugar that lingers. After half a glass the alcohal starts to make an appearance with a warming sensation in the chest.

Very good strong smell while pouring...that of espresso. Provides a finger to 2 finger brown head that slowly disapates and leaves sticky thick lacing.  Aroma is dark chocolate, espresso/coffee, and roasted malts. Aroma isn't as strong as I thought it would be from the pour, but a very sweet pleasant aroma. Here goes...down the hatch...  Very solid espresso flavors. Roasted malts and sugars, not as sweet as other big name stouts like Abyss and KBS...but great and clean in it's own way. Leaves a sweet coffee flavor on the tongue.

112,412,augustgarage,4.01,"I normally steer clear of nitro taps, but curiosity got the better of me last night at the Library Ale House. Served in an Old Rasputin nonic, which was a nice touch.  Thoroughly opaque black hole of a body crowned by two fat fingers of light tan, thick mocha fizz. Perpetual retention, cake-batter-like lacing, though no real legs to speak of.  Almost sour roast malt, lightly burnt bread, subtle esters from the alcohol, and a touch of weeds and citrus from the hops.  Over-roasted coffee, bread crusts, and a pungent mineral note that seems to be emphasized with this serving type. Unsweetened baker's chocolate and scalded milk lead into the surprisingly dry, almost dusty finish (vaguely brings to mind river stones, cheap hotel ice, old carpets, and other assorted phantoms). While strongly bitter, the hops don't jump out at you - a very carefully balanced beer.  Thick, soft, uniform body though a bit ""artificial"" in its presentation especially considering the purity of ingredients and skill in craftsmanship - I'd much prefer to see this on-cask. If I'm going to abandon my (perhaps idealized) notions of product integrity, why not go all the way and head down to The Golden State for one of their Old Rasputin beer floats?

Lacing is more like a wall than anything else.  Nose- Solid roast malt, coffee, chocolate with some nuttiness and sweetness showing through.  Palate- Slightly sweeter than expected, but not in a bad way. Tastes as you would expect from the nose, but with toffee, and licorice notes.  Mouthfeel- Creamy, FULL bodied, medium carbonation.

Taste is simply perfect for the style. Lots of chocolate, coffee and plenty of earthy hops. Just the right amount of hop balance really. Very creamy and smooth in the mouth and not a hint of the high ABV. This beer always sneaks up on me when I have it on tap. So easy to toss back a pint and not even realize how much alcohol it has.

Smells like a good imperial stout should, packed with deeply roasted grain, black coffee, and bitter dark chocolate, all on top of a bed of sweet malt with a touch of fruitiness.  More of the same on the palate, with an intense roasted character that strongly suggests a cup of seriously black coffee, accompanied by earthy, bitter dark chocolate. Turns sweet mid-palate, showing creamy, milky caramel, before finishing with a quite large earthy hop bitterness. Finishes firm and dry, with a lingering roasty and hoppy bitterness.  Full bodied and firm, but shows hints of softness. Alcohol is well hidden at 9%.

Taste: Subdued up front, it gains intensity as it moves to the back of your mouth. Chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, and a hint of fruit (plum maybe?) come out towards the end. The result is a pleasing chocolaty aftertaste and coffee-ish burps.  Mouthfeel: Thick, creamy, and full-bodied. Goes down smooth.  Drinkability: A great stout!!

112,412,AndyAvalanche,4.42,"Poured into a Duvel tulip glass. This beer pours black in color, only slight highlights of dark brown while pouring it. There is a tan colored head, similar to a cola head just less fizzy. It goes away only after a few minutes. I didn't expect to see much lacing to it, but it has a different sort of stick to it. It's almost like a syrupy consistency that every so slowly slides back down to the liquid on each sip you take. The aroma has quite a bit going on and in my opinion is much better from the bottle than on tap. As most RIS's there is a great deal of chocolate in the smell as well as the roasted malts and some roasted coffee too. The hops really stand out in the smell however, and are probably the most dominant feature. It took me several sips before I noticed how strong the hop taste was. Initially you taste the dark chocolate and roasted coffee. It's well malted too, but overpowered by the coffee and chocolate. After the 3rd sip or so, the hops again become a more dominant feature of the flavor. It's still a very tasty beer, a great combination of all the ingredients. The mouthfeel was good, but after awhile, the hops leave your moth just the slightest bit too dry. Its still full bodied while at the same time being a little silky, but it's still certainly more dry than it needs to be. This is still a very drinkable RIS, or beer in general.

112,412,argock,4.12,"Poured from 12oz brown bottle into a clear glass snifter. No freshness date. Purchased as 4-pack from Harris Teeter (Charlottesville, VA) for $9.99.  A: Nearly black with ruby edges with 1/2-finger tan head that dissipates quickly and leaves a few spots of lace.  S: Strong aromas of bitter dark chocolate and cold coffee mingle with black bread with light berry alcohol and leafy hops notes  T: A big, traditional RIS with medicinal, bourbon dark malt notes taking charge but coated with heavy bittersweet chocolate and black coffee with some leafy hops thrown in. Alcohol contributes a berry-cherry note as well.  M: Thick and viscous but not as chewy as you might imagine. A little oatmeal in the mix might cut the light astringency and give this a little more smoothness.  D: A classic stout which I like better in the bottle for temperature control purposes. It has a heavy medicinal quality with a pretty boozy profile overall, but the bitter chocolate and coffee notes are artfully woven in. I'm going to leave a few of these for a few months and try them serially every 3-4 months to see if there is much evolution.  12/5/2009: Consumed after a Founders Breakfast Stout, and the contrast is substantial. Much sweeter and boozier with a more traditional dark malt sweetness with a more bitter chocolate component with a light bourbon note.

112,412,CMiller683,4,"Picked this up at the store without realizing what I had. Bought it as part of a build-a-six-pack. No freshness date listed. Served from a 12oz bottle into a standard glass. Creepy looking bottle with a shot of Rasputin on the front, circled by some Russian wording. Gold colored detail.  A - Pours a very thick, smooth, motor-oil black. Follows with a thick, creamy espresso head with a lace that crawls down the glass. Completely opaque and a threatening looking beer.  S - A deep, roasty, burnt maltiness that smacks you in the face. Scents of espresso and a little bit of chocolate and nuts. Tends to fade a bit as you drink it  T - A very intense flavor. Carries a burnt/smoked maltiness to it. Brings a bite of alcohol that is almost too much to make a good balance. Has a level of bitterness that really makes this beer. Without it, I don't think it would be nearly as good.  M - An almost foamy feel to it. Very thick and heavy. A good balance of carbonation and an explosion of flavor in the back of your mouth that is simply great. Leaves a chocolately mocha aftertaste with a sweet finish, but tends to be a little thick and sticky. The alcohol brings out the nutty/espresso flavors.

112,412,californiakulak,4.03,"I poured a bottle of this beer into a Firestone pint glass.  A. Beautiful dark brown in color, almost black. The head was a light brown color. It looked creamy and lasted a good amount of time.  S. It had a strong roasted malt aroma. It also had some coffee scents. Perhaps some dark chocolate as well.  T. Roasted malts and alcohol. Very good tasting beer. Some sweetness and a little dark chocolate as well.  M. Warming alcohol and a little bitterness. A full bodied creamy like feeling comes with this beer.  D. Average drinkability. It is pretty heavy and I couldn't see myself having many more than one at a sitting.

Head is a touch on the loose side and dies down after about a minute to a nice collar and some islands of bubbles in the middle.  S - Some coffee, creamy and roasty. Some fruityness and touch of sugar and brown sugar in the aroma too.  T - Full of coffee, a good amount of alcohol, a bit of prunes. Lots of dark roasted malts, bakers chocolate, bitterness from the malt and alsosome hoppy bitterness too. Overall, a a slightly sweet impression left behind, caramelly, brown sugary and refined sugar. Very well balanced.  M - Good mouthfeel, medium bodied and a little bit thick on the tongue. A touch oily and slippery on the tongue. Not as thick as some other RIS's out there. Carbonation is medium - gives a creamy impression and a lingering tingle in the center of the tongue after the swallow.  D - Very well balanced RIS. Plenty of dark roasted flavors and dark fruits and lots of hops to balance. Not hoppy at all, but enough there to offset the sweetness from the malts. 9.0% alcohol is hidden quite well...makes this one a bit dangerous.  Very, very good RIS...challenging the Stone RIS as my favorite ""everyday"" RIS..",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Perhaps some hop bitterness either from that or the coffee. It finishes with a bit of alcohol burn....well..warmth. An awesomely complex!!  The mouthfeel is thick and almost chewy. Its great!

Strong notes of dark chocolate, some coffee, licorice, alcohol, grassy hops and earthy yeasts  T: Follows the nose. Strong notes of roasted malts, dark chocolate, mocha and licorice.

An extremely well balanced brew and tasty brew.

Mouthfeel - Thick and creamy, cabonation is just right.  Drink - Great drink, could drink acouple no problem. Definitely one worth savoring though.  Notes: Great RIS, wish it was a little cheaper. Although I paid less for it than the ten fidy, and it is far superior to the ten fidy. I bought a single, I can get it cheaper in 4 packs. Will probably be doing that tomorrow night.

I just bought a 4-pk of this at an amazing $5.99 deal (that's 48 oz of world class stout), and it tastes even better than the first time I've tried it.  Look is black, but not the blackest of the black, with a gorgeous head forming. Smell is a bit of fruity chocolate aroma.  Taste is sweet at first, and a slight burnt bitterness at finishing.

Smelled of mocha, molasses, caramel, scorched chocolate with a hint of black licorice. Plenty of heavy sweetness to the smell.  Taste and Mouthfeel: Tasted very roasty with sweet chocolate and caramel flavors definitely present. Pretty thick feel and just enough warmth to be complimentary. Left a very slick, creamy feel on the tongue. A very feint pine like hop bitterness which is almost hidden by the other characteristics of this brew. Plenty going on in this.

Slight alcohol presence on the nose as well.  T - Rich, roasted malt flavors come through first, with mostly a robust coffee quality as well as some of the bittersweet chocolate. The dark fruit character is not lost in the flavor either, coming through a bit. Ample hop flavor in this one, with a good bit of bitterness coming through as the malts subside. Finish is rather dry and leaves some lingering bitterness - as well as some of the roasted, coffee flavors - into the aftertaste.  M - Full bodied and smooth.

Impressive retention and thick sheets of lacing. Spot on for the style, there's really nothing to mark off for here. Awesome looking brew.  S: Sweet, smooth, and strong. Coffee, chocolate, raisins, spice, and general roasted deliciousness. Beautiful.  T: Largely follows the nose, with a bit of hop bitterness on the finish balancing out the huge roasted malt sweetness. Strong coffee aftertaste with no astringency. Fantastic.  M: Nice and full bodied with a good amount of carbonation; the bubbles come across surprisingly sharp, though. Not bad, but not great.  D: The bitterness of the finish keeps the the sweetness from being overwhelming, leading to a great overall drinkability. Definitely one of the more quaffable RISs I've come across. Superb.  Notes: This is such a great beer, it's hard to believe that it's so readily available and affordable. Old Raspy is my go-to RIS, and very few others have surpassed it period, much less in terms of price and availability. I'd have a real dilemma if FBS were distributed in CT, but $8 for a 4-pack of Old Raspy is a hell of a lot better than $12 and a tank of gas for as many Breakfast Stouts and a trip to MA.

The mouthfeel was nice and creamy with a soft carbonation. It was the perfect balance, keeping the alcohol hidden but still noticed.

The hoppiness comes as somewhat of a suprise, although pleasant.  T&M- Full bodied from the start. Soft carbonation blends very well with the smokey burnt grain and piney hop bitterness and, in turn, hides the alcohol very well.  There's alot of hype around barrel aged stouts right now.

Clings to the glass like maple syrup. ORIS defines ""exceptional appearance"".  Smell is full of roasted malt, nuanced by hints of chocolate and a little booziness. Some caramel aroma grows as the beer warms up a little.  Taste is slightly restrained for the style, but no flavors feel out of place. A little char to the roasted malt, some coffee-like bitterness, and a note of hops. This beer's only fault is that the malt sweetness hides a little too well.  Slick, creamy mouthfeel.

Lots of roasted flavor, sweet notes, and dark chocolate come out in each sip. The sweetness and chocolate flavors are the srongest throughout. It has a nice roasted aftertaste.  M-Not overly thick.

M: Very creamy, very rich, warming, perfect amount of carbonation. D: Very drinkable beer even with the high abv as all the flavors and aromas blended very well for a really good beer.

The head poured fairly thin, but then just kept growing until it was about two fingers thick. Fades back down relatively quickly, but eventually settles into a thick crown with a nice film over the middle.  Nose is of dark chocolate, espresso, and sweet. The taste is superb. Dark caramel malts, espresso, dark chocolate, and a subtle hint of dark fruits. This beer has every excuse to be a bitter bomb, and it does have some bitterness, but it's actually quite balanced and distinctly sweet. Complex, superb taste.  Mouthfeel is full bodied and creamy. There's a mild amount of carbonation - you'll notice it, but it's not dominant. Subtle alcohol taste. A bit of a burn or tingle in the throat. There is a bit of a feeling/taste in the throat that reminds me of cough syrup, but it's not unpleasant.  Drinkability is tough to rate on this. It's delicious and you'll frequently find yourself sipping away on a glass of this, but it's heavy and full-bodied, so you're not exactly going to be chugging this or going back for seconds and thirds.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Poisoned, shot multiple times and stuffed down an ice-hole into a freezing river... that's what it took to kill Rasputin, the mad monk.  This sucker pours black as night and thickish, not a lot of carbonation that I could see or taste. Tan rocky head for days, and lasting; some lace. Smells like dark chocolate and coffee and dark roasty malt, strong and black. Black like the pit of Hades that Rasputin probably occupies now...  Taste? This sucker is not hiding the fact that it's strong on the alky. Oh no. No Belgian deception for Rasputin. It's bad and strong and dark.. this is Mike Tyson in a bottle. Chocolate and coffee and the usual stout suspects, only magnified and amped. Only sessionable if you're over 6 feet tall and about 200+ pounds. Otherwise? Do so at your own risk.

112,412,vacax,3.75,"Black with a mocha colored two finger head. Retention is up high and there is a good amount of lace as well. Looking in the bottle, it appears this is not bottle conditioned, and the head reflects this in terms of density.  Nose is full of cocoa, roasted malts, wine grapes, pear, and a dash of pepper. The smell is quite fruity and sweet, though the flavor is quite balanced in comparison. The initial taste is a mixture of chocolate and grape--not too sweet because the roast kicks in quickly on the midpalate to balance and neutralize the sweet qualities. Somewhat spicy as well, maybe a bit of leather in there, or perhaps shoe polish toward the end. Bitter roast on the finish with a chlorophyll tang and a final cookielike residual affect. Pretty good job of balanced sweet and roast flavors, though a few notes that were not completely harmonious in my book. Full bodied with a medium, slightly higher than average carbonation. Awkwardly sticky.  Given the fact I paid something like two bucks for a bottle of this instead of $6-10 for most other imperial stouts it is hard to find a leg to genuinely criticize the beer. It is good product for a more ""every day"" imperial stout.

WOW! chocolate and burnt toast dominate, with notes of licorice, molasses, black coffee, dark fruits- everything a RIS should be. some hops in the taste, but they take a backseat to the other rich complex tastes. alcohol is not as present as it is in the smell, but after a few sips you can tell it's definitely hiding in there.  mouthfeel is thick and chewy like it should be. slick on the palate, but ending slightly dry. highly drinkable. highly enjoyable. one of my favorite RISs  + loads of complex flavors here. everything you would want from a RIS, and it even has a great head on it.  = one thing i've always loved about Old Raspy is the creamy sour milk and chocolate taste, without the soy sauce taste ubiquitous in many RIS. sometimes i love the soy sauce taste (see Sam Adams Imperial) and sometimes i don't. Old Raspy has a great blend of flavors without overdoing it.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,cbutova,4.5,"Pours pitch black oil colored with a nice dark tan, creamy two fingered head. Head starts to fizz out right away but not extremely quickly. I would say it has medium retention and creaminess. Leaves nice thick lacing on my glass. Smells of nice dark roasted malts, coffee and chocolate with a nice sweetness (oatmeal?) overlapping it all. The alcohol bite to the nose only adds to this great balance of smell, a nice strong one too. Tastes mainly of dark roasted malts, sweets and chocolate. There is an alcohol bite here that grows enormously as the beer warms up. It started out balanced in but becomes a tiny bit off-balance over time. This does not ruin the taste at all, still a great dose of roasted malts in here. Mouthfeel here is nice and thick, creamy with perfect carbonation for the taste. The alcohol warming does not really take over this beer. Very nice mouthfeel. Drinkability is great here, good taste, great price for an RIS, the alcohol might get to be a bit too much after a while but I will continue to buy this and it is so worth it for the quality of this beer.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,GrittyMug345,4.53,"Had this on nitro at Novare Res in Portland, ME, poured into a 16oz shaker pint. A very tight one finger head the color of coffee ice cream on top of a pitch black body, the head dies verry slowly down to a half finger and remains, the lacing left behind throughout is more like sheeting. The nose is of sweet toffee, roasty malt, and cocoa powder. The flavor is more fo the same, with a nice touch of espresso, a raisiny sweetness, followed by a bitter cocoa/espresso finish, there is also a hint of earth in there somewhere. The mouthfeel is superb, very creamy, nice and thick but not syrupy, very smooth. Drinkability is great for what this is, by no means a session beer but it is not intended to be, a perfect dessert beer.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Kristing,4.78,"This beer is a real powder keg, a cascade of flavour. Tasting it is a bit like being punched in the face, without the pain of course. There are many lovely roasted tones, and a great deal of strong coffee and dark chocolate in the flavour. I feel that this is really the way an excellent Imperial Stout should taste like. Despite the flavour, it is rather easy to quaff this brew, and it is really the quintessential beer to kick back and relax with, especially during a cold winter day when the darkness outside reflects the colour in your glass.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,infi,4.25,"Poured into a snifter.  Pours a translucent blood-red color into the glass, but completely opaque and dark once sitting in there. Very viscous and heavy looking. A straight pour in the middle of the glass creates a beautiful creamy light-brown head that rises up to almost two-fingers in depth. And after a few seconds it'll settle to a nice cap. Nice rings of fine-bubbled lacing appear on the perimeter as you sip. Aromas are heavy with roasted barley and malt, burnt dark coffee, chocolate and vanilla tones, earthy oak and alcohol. Complete package in regards to the template RIS - nothing lacking in scent here.  Excellent balance in the malt and hop profiles of this RIS. Starts off with some nice creamy chocolate/cocoa and caramel flavors and then enters into a great malt backbone. Very, very roasted in quality. In the finish is a nice hop bitterness, that of which is not too overpowering, and the 9% ABV. Actually giving me quite a nice buzz.  Mouthfeel is creamy and medium-bodied which is very noticable on the tongue. Not much of a palpable carbonation feel as there is visually, but it adds to the smoothness of its drinkability, which is moderate. Definitely don't want to be indulging too fast; the 9% ABV catches on nicely.  Old Rasputin is definitely Ol' Reliable for the RIS style. Covers all aspects of the style and very tasty. I'm pretty anxious to try the XII and see how much more can be added to an already great stout.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Smell is quite rich. A wonderful blend of roasted malts, coffee, chocolate and some dark fruits as well.  Taste is wonderful! Just like the aroma, a sweet blend of roasted coffee and malts, chocolate and a nice bitter bite from the hops. A nice feel from the alcohol on the end, especially as it warms.  Mouthfeel is full bodied and creamy with a small amount of carbonation. Very pleasent on the tongue.  Drinkability is very good! It goes down quite smooth and has a wonderful taste.

112,412,heissebier,4.2,"My roommate whiteweasel brought back this delicious beer one afternoon. I'm a history major and I must say I became attached to this beer after hearing it's name and spotting the ""Never Say Die"" slogan on the box.  Appearance- Black! I could be pouring oil into a glass and wouldn't know the difference if it wasn't for the nice, thick, tantalizingly frothy head.  Smell- Incredibly complex. Cacao, coffee, and some sweetness balances everything nicely.  Taste- Delicious and full bodied. I'd describe the overall flavor as ""Extra Bold"". Has a bitter, roasted flavor to it. Hints of the beer's high alcohol content can be detected, as well.  Mouthfeel- excellent carbonation, goes down smooth!  Drinkability- Looses points in this category because of its heaviness.

112,412,alcstradamus,4.08,"This has so many reviews by now that I can't make any descriptions that haven't been repeated a hundred times already. So I'll just give my overall thoughts.  The first time I tried Old Rasputin I was in love with it. I was still very new in the craft beer world, and hadn't had many (or maybe any) of the top rated stouts in the world. Rasputin was an afforable, roasty, flavorful monster that I latched onto. Since then, I have had the pleasure of trying many gigantic imperial stouts and I no longer feel the same love for the Rasputin.  However, I still find it to be a very nice beer. Nice roastiness without tasting too burnt...not enough body to really make me happy but at least its not thin....awesome drinkability for a 9% beer. This is a beer that is perfect for beginners and still very good for veterans.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,brokensail,4.4,"I can't believe I've yet to write a few for Ol' Raspy. Here it goes...  A: I poured the bottle into my Cigar City snifter to reveal the beautiful and familiar jet black, viscous liquid that is Old Rasputin. A small mocha colored head sits atop the darkness.  S: Great aromas of chocolate, coffee, a roasted nuttiness, and hints of vanilla. A wonderful combination of sweet and bitter aromas.  T: The taste very much follows the nose, and I'm quite glad it does. Once again, a great balance between sweet coffee and vanilla flavors melds well with bitter coffee and a roasted, bordering on burnt, taste.  M: Now this is a full bodied beer. Very little in the way of carbonation, the way it should be, and this gives the beer that thick, creamy mouthfeel you are looking for in an RIS.  D: I personally find this to be one of the more drinkable beers in the RIS style, but that doesn't make it a beer you're going to drink 6 of. A great beer and I've decided to finally put some away to age, even though I love it fresh.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,kurp001,4.47,"Pours an opaque black with about one finger of light brown head that holds up for a while, then recedes, leaving minimal lacing.  The aroma is very rich; burnt coffee, vanilla, and mild chocolate hints all come through.  Like the aroma, a great deal of flavor notes come through. Roasted coffee is most apparent upfront, along with chocolate and mild vanilla notes midway. A slight bitterness is also notable on the finish.  Mouthfeel is rich and smooth; full-bodied with subtle carbonation.  Old Rasputin is about as drinkable as a Russian Imperial Stout gets; its bold flavors are always enjoyable, particularly on colder days.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

The taste is pretty malty with a sweet chocolate and toffee flavor. Some nice bitter coffee flavor mixed in as well which makes for a very satisfying  The first sip was so good it was almost overwhelming. It is packed with so much malts and yet a nice pack of hop and coffee bitterness. There are chocolates, toffees, molasses, and some alcohol.

112,412,cptierney,4.6,"This is it, the beer that started it all. Old Rasputin has such a personal appeal to me, we have shared many a night together and I can't help but feel in the presence of an old friend when I pour that 12 ouncer into its appropriate Old Rasputin North Coast nonic pint glass. This isn't so much a review as it is a love letter.  First, there's the color. My dad used to drink Guinness and say it was as black as Hitler's soul. If that was the case, whose soul is as pitch black as the opaque liquid before me? This is void of space dark crowned with an impressive three fingers of fluffy light brown celestial foam that gently dissipates to leave a thin corona of light atop this black beast.  Old Raspy's nose really shines. There are the requisite notes of black coffee and cocoa that one would expect but it is in the complexity of sweet notes that this brew asserts its dominance. I can't describe all the elements but I'll try to do it justice by stating that there is a warm toffee ambiance that radiates from my glass.  A quaff of this stout is best described as velvety smooth. If Barry White made beer, this is what it would taste like. Viscous enough to have body but liquid enough to avoid adjectives like jammy, Old Raspy disappears with a satisfactory level of bubbleage and harmony.  The flavor of this beer is a little old fashioned as compared to some of its more hyped up cousins. While it lacks in the dark fruits category it shines in the area of malt. Biscuity, bready, and toasted are words that quickly come to mind. The sweetness is also evident with touches of vanilla and candied sugar. There is some bittering, as the hops play their hand at the beers finish, though they remain merely character actors in this beers screenplay.  This is not a sipping beer for experienced RIS drinkers. Its relative light body and minimal bitterness make for a remarkably sessionable Imperial Stout. There is an associated danger with this brew however, that 9% ABV is not a joke.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,About2Crash,4.43,"Holy Crap. This is black as night. I am no expert on finding the little nuances, so I can only tell you my first instincts. But it is big and smoky. Dark chocolate hits the pallat. Very smooth taste in the middle, but the surrounding flavor is very thick and rocky if that makes any sense. The picture of Rasputin on the bottle seems to be laughing at me, daring me to take another sip. I like it.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,squaremile,3.81,"This is a standby for a lot of folks including myself. When I want an RIS and want to spend $2, Old Raspy is there, like a non-pretentious gradeschool friend. Black pour, small/medium head, some lacing, and the nose is roasted malts and coffee. The flavor is much more of the same with espresso dominating. On nitro tap the punch is relaxed and the mouthfeel is foamy goodness.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,generalnotsew,4.27,L: Thick two finger brown head that looks like chocolate milk to me. Almost solid black but a little brownish tone.  S: I seem to get hops before anything. Dark chocolate and coffee beans. Maybe a bit nutty too.  T: Tad bit of a hop bite upfront. I get more chocolate than coffee although both are prominent. Taste lingers nicely.  M: Very creamy in the mouth maybe a bit chewy. Kind of beers you almost want to swish around.  D: Takes a hit on drinkability. Not so much because of the abv but it is a bit heavy. Even sipping slowly you can pass on having to eat the rest of the night.  I think this one is about 6 months old. Not aged much but still better now than when I got it 6 months ago.

I have drank this one since I was 21, but as my palette has developed, I now can see how incredibly hoppy this is for a stout. There is also a fair amount of malty sweetness, notes of coffee, molasses, and chocolate. The heavy dose of hops gives it a deep earthy aroma.  T: initial onslaught of sweet malts that quickly turn into earthy grassy hops with a bit of heat on the end from the alcohol content. The taste pretty much matches the nose but with more complexity. The taste of hops lingers in my mouth after I swallow. Flavors are pretty well balanced, but the alcohol is definitely present (not surprising for 9%) Pretty damn delicious!  M: Thick body but not as thick as some imperial stouts. Somewhat high in carbonation for the style, but it matches the hop bitterness.  D: at 7.99 a 4pk, this is one of the more affordable imperial stouts (which happens to be my favorite style) so I find myself with this in the fridge quite often.

There is a small amount of bitterness on the tailend . M- This is a nice medium bodied beer with some nice soft carbonation. Its pretty smooth and creamy.

112,412,DeeMented,4.5,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a glass beer mug.  The beer poured a dark, rich black that refused to let any light through. The head was thick and tan. It looked like it was going to pour with a thin head, but it kept growing after the pour, until it peaked all thick and frothy. All manner of lacing followed it down.  It's going to sound strange, but this beer smelled as dark as it looked. Strong toasted, (almost burned), malts dominated, but there was a hint of licorice, a bit of coffee, and a bit of chocolate that all merged together, so the nose was different for each sniff.  The mouthfeel wasn't as heavy as it looked. It was carbonated well enough to lighten it up. Kind of a medium feel.  The taste followed the complexity of the nose. It began with the sweet, toasted malts, and finished with more of a hops/coffee bitterness than I expected. Don't read that as a bad thing. The finish left me feeling warm and flushed. There was a lingering scorched chocolate flavor that lingered after the bitterness faded.  As it warmed, the flavors harmonized a bit more, but the hops bite always dominated the finish.

Excellent blending of flavors, everything really melds together in this brew, there is plenty of hop bittering to keep things from being overly sweet.

The prerequisite aromas of coffee and cocoa are present in the background.  The roasted malts are the highlight here .. lots of dark chocolate and cocoa nib flavors. Vanilla, caramel, and licorice all come into play with a moderate amount of pine-y hops at the end.  One of the most drinkable Russian imperial stouts out there. Despite having a high ABV %, the alcohol is unnoticeable. The roastedness never detracts from the drinkability. With a lot of different flavors coming out from cold to room temperature, this beer is a sipper.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,apbarwood,4.35,"Pours like motor oil with a light-tan head. It goes away fairly quickly but there's a decent amount of lace for a higher ABV beer. Aromas of roasted coffee and the darkest chocolate imaginable. Very pleasant but not as aromatic as it could have been. There's a ton of depth in the flavor with the roasted notes taking the forefront. The coffee/bittersweet chocolate flavor starts with a dark cherry fruit flavor peaking through in the middle. It was very subtle but it was there. The finish came on nicely with a roasted coffee bitterness. Nice, chewy mouthfeel that made me feel like there was ground up coffee and cocoa powder floating in the beer. One of the most delicious stouts I've had to date. A definite must try and something I'll drink again.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,rickmick,4.44,"Opened the bottle then poured into a hefty mug.  A thick head hangs around for a couple of minutes, then flees. The brew is very black. Enticing. Not much going on in the aroma department.  This is extremely tasty. Not terribly complex, but a very nice barleyish flavor dominates the finish. Mouthfeel is phenomenal--one of the best feeling beers I've ever had. Drinkable for a RIS.  One of the best RISs around.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,washburnkid,4.43,"I've had this fine beer before, but haven't had a chance to review it yet. Enjoyed in a snifter.  A: 3 fingers of a dark tan head that's bubbly and inviting. The body is pitch black, with the head sliding so slowly down and ever so gorgeous. There's a nice thick cap of retention, too. S: Roasted super bitter dark chocolate, ripe berries, lightly roasted espresso bean. Very malt heavy, as expected. A bit of alcohol on the nose. T: Flavors are huge on chocolate and espresso. Massive, really. Some of the most intensely concentrated combination of these flavors I've ever experienced. Lots of alcohol, but it's mellowed in each sip by the chocolate. M: Heavy mouthfeel and high carbonation. Tons of bittersweet residuals. D: Damn...this is really incredible. An amazing beer, and available all year long. If you haven't tried it...what's taking so long?!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,MisterSH,4.16,"Rather creepy looking 12 oz bottle poured into a smuttynose big beer tulip. I love the packaging on this beer. ""Never say die""  Pours Jet black, with a big, fluffy head that practically explodes out of the beer and refuses to leave once it arrives.  Smell is dominated by dark chocolate. There is raspberry, some bready notes but overall quite sweet on the nose, reminiscent of a raspberry chocolate bar.  Taste is RICH with coffee, raisin, dark chocolate, some toast. Quite a clean finish with some breadiness left on the palate. Some hops on the finish become increasingly noticeable as the brew warms a bit. Alcohol is shockingly well masked and is not particularly prominent at all, save a slight finishing warmth.  Mouthfeel is somewhat syrupy, but not overly heavy or thick as I had expected it to be. Very low on the carb, unexpectedly clean and crisp on the tongue.  Rich, bold and delicious, am I wrong in still being a bit underwhelmed? This is a fine beer, but considering its following and the hype surrounding it, I was expecting something completely mind-blowing, which I did not quite get. What I did find was an all around tasty, drinkable stout that I will gladly keep around as a dependable standby now that I've figured out where to find it in my area.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Style: Russian Imperial Stout ABV: 9.00 % bottle&gt;pint glass @ E Street week of 9/23/09  Appearance is almost identical to Old #38 in color, very dark brown/black with a nice creamy tan head. Smell/Aroma is dark roasted malty-ness with coffee and cocoa notes in a fine symphony for the nose. Tastes as it smells and then some, with a full bodied roasty finish. Mouthfeel is full body with low carbonation as expected.  Cocoa is a forward flavor in this stout balanced by a harmony of citus hop notes. Just the way I like an RIS. Exceptional drinkability for a RIS, not 100% sessionable, but complex enough to make it a 5.0 if you pace yourself and respect this big bold brew!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Doesn't last too long, as expected.  The nose is all about dark chocolate. Some malt, very subtle molasses aromas and coffee as well. Smells as though I am in for a treat!  Chocolate on the palate as well! Hoppy bitterness and coffee/chocolate burnt malt flavors make this a tasty brew. Espresso and dark choloclate totally dominatem filled out by a everpresent hoppiness.  Heavy, silky mouthfeel. Definitely a sipper.

112,412,mikel52588,4.28,"Appearance: Poured into dogfish heads signature glass, has a nearly black hue with a color fingerlength latte colored head and thin lacing  Smell: Really needed to let this beer warm up a little, because at first it smelled like pure alcohol. There is a strong aroma of dark coffee; cacoa is in there too with some other spices.  Taste: It tastes like straight up a 80% cacoa dark chocolate bar, but at the same time it also taste like espresso, it's a quite interesting combination to say the least. The aftertaste is similar to the ones you would get from a combo of coffee and cacoa with its unique bitterness.  Mouthfeel: This beer is oh so smooth, it has rich creaminess of a latte; the body is on the heavy side and the carbonation is light. Aftertaste lingers for a while, but isn't too bad.  Drinkability: Its quite drinkable. For having 9% abv this one goes down smooth, I don't know if I would session with this beast, but it's definitely tasty. It would be interesting to try with café food.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,craftaholic,4.32,"Appearance: Poured from a stout 12 oz'r into a snifter. This brew is dark as night and its dismal head starts off as a half finger length of creamy tan colored froth and then is quickly swallowed up by the noir abyss.  Smell: It smells like the equivalent of a mocha java milkshake and grinded coffee beans. There are sweet roasted malts all swirling around in this 'latte' that envelope your sense of smell along with burn it with some phenolic esters that linger in the swill.  Taste: Tastes like a nice smooth espresso with burnt malted grains. There is a touch of hoppy bitterness but is matched by a prevalent mix of sweetness that works well with the extremely rich dark cocoa presence. It has such a wide range of complexities that really swirl around in this opaque stout. The finish is slight tinges of ethanol and very heavy molasses.  Mouthfeel: Has a nice big body with a syrupy smooth coating. Froths as its leaves the mouth and leaves touches of bitter and a coating of oils. Practically crawls down your throat and clings to all sides of your esophagus begging to hang around.  Drinkability: Surprisingly drinkable for its depth and potency. Doesn't drink like a beer but rather like something you'd find on par with your local hole-in-the-wall coffee spot a.k.a. well crafted and highly chocolate-esq espresso-like beverage.  Overall: A very rich and complex RIS that is extremely balanced and would be a great brew to accompany dessert, maybe even replace it.

Slight ethanol on the end. Good foamy mouthfeel, and decent drinkability except for the ABV. Like I said, decent stout.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,biboergosum,4.15,"12oz bottle. Is the titular seer divining something with his hand, or merely wiping his brow?  This beer pours a deep, dark black abyss, with a slight hint of red cola at the edges, and then only when held to direct light, and a head that comes in at about two pudgy fingers of puffy, creamy, and fizzy beigeness, which leaves a solid ring of jagged sudsy lace around the glass as it slowly recedes.  It smells strongly of bittersweet chocolate, dry coffee beans, toasty caramel malt, ripe black fruit, earthy, leafy hops, and a slight metallic alcohol astringency. The taste is bitter dark chocolate, toasted caramel biscuits, roasted, and sort of charred coffee, a heavy, yet dry plum and date fruitiness, gritty molasses, and a small, insidiously innocuous alcohol twang.  The carbonation is on the low side, just a low-key frothiness apparent, the body big, dense, and smooth, in a simmeringly menacing sort of manner. It finishes off-dry, some retreating chocolate and settling hop notes closing things out - the booze warming continues its charade of being barely noticeable (ok, 'very well integrated').  A pretty stellar RIS, the chocolate, malt, fruit, and booze all playing nice like there was no revolution in sight, just yer typical drunken dalliances with the tsarina. Oh yes, old Grigori would indeed be proud.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Some slight dark fruit sweetness is also mildly present. Complex yet extraordinarily well balanced. Mouthfeel is full bodied with strong carbonation.

Dark chocolate coming in right after, and doesnt go away for a while. Then the dark roast astringentness. Finishes off with a bit of warming alcohol. Can't taste the alcohol, just feel it. SO GOOD.

Only prev. exp. has been with Guiness, not impressed, and Peg Leg Stout, which I found quite delicious.  Poured up into a pint glass. Poured as expected. A deep black color with a dark tan 2 finger head. First notes were that of espresso and dark roasted malt.  Taste was seriously yummy. As with smell the first flavor to hit the palate was that of roasted espresso and malts. Finished off with a nice touch of hopiness that lingured around after the beer was on its journey.

Nose was very mild and subdued - some malt, some brown sugar and a hint of hops. Taste reveals chocolate malt, brown sugar, molasses, black licorice and a definite hops presence. Mouthfeel was just shy of medium-bodied, but a bit too much carbonation for the style - I like my RIS's lightly carbonated and oily/viscous.

S: Dark, malty, toasty, a bit nutty and chocolately. Everything in the right place. T: More complete and complex than I've had this from bottle. Roasted grain, touch of coffee, chocolate, and walnut. M: Carries some bitterness to contrast the malty, roasted flavors. Finishes with some bite. Full in body. Again, textbook. D: Satisfying, solid, great stout.

This overwhelmed the malt and heavy fruits I expect to smell in a Imperial Russian.  The taste was initially heavy malt and quickly overtaken by the hops, which took over the flavor with excessive bitterness and grapefruit flavors. This hop flavor overpowered the finish with a spicy bitter flavor that lingered on the palate.  Mouthfeel was thick and creamy appropriate to a Imperial Russian.

Some toffee and caramel are also present with a warming smooth alcohol. Maybe a little light on the boldness of the flavors though.  Great mouthfeel, a thick and viscous full bodied beer.

Pours virtually black. Nice tan foam forms on the surface. Texture is not as thick as you would expect for a beer of this gravity - somehow they kept the viscosity down, not a bad thing! Smells a lot of chocolate and roasted malts. Some of the apparently 75 IBUs show off here as well. Tastes great - more accessible than some of the bossier RISs...with a chocolate, malty, nutty taste, followed by the alcohol and bitterness from the hops. I have not gotten this level of hops from this type of beer before. The drinkability is surprisingly good...I could see 2 or 3 of these in myself.  I remember having the first of the 6-pack of this over 6 months ago and it was a bit harsh at the time, but I believe it has improved some with age.

Not much lacing left, but that doesn't detract from anything.  Smells rich. Hints of chocolate and malt. Smells sturdy and thick with hints of coffee. Extremely inviting.  The feel is smooth and creamy on the palate with a dry finish. Carbonization is mild, but well balanced with the rest of the aspects. Just the right amount in my opinion.

Glug glug glug  First there is a sweet taste of roasted malts and a creamy flavor...and if I'm not crazy a bit of hop bitterness lingers along with it. Just after the initial hit I get a fruity base of plums and maybe cherries. The entire profile is really well balanced and complex, in addition to being just really damn tasty.

The taste is great, especially for a year-around beer, how do they do it? Well served at room temperature or ABOVE is when it peaks. Malty coffee, small hints of cocoa. ABV is hidden all too well, makes it dangerous on a night out. The mouthfeel is thick, and creamy. The body looks thinner though, which tricks the mind. On tap it is a frothy malt bomb.

There is a very malty coffee up front, some tobacco, and a hint of bitter chocolate. Some slight dark fruit as well. Mouthfeel is good as well, medium to heavy body.

112,412,Slatetank,4.67,"I had this at Teresa's Next door on Nitro at the Beer Geek brunch, Served chilled in a large snifter  A - Deep black, opaque like a black hole w/ 2 fingers of whipped chocolate mousse for a head.  S- Slight port aroma, deep plum, tobacco, cocoa, vanilla, coffee and caaramel  M - Lots of creaminess in the feel w/ smooth vanilla and spice. Lots of charred malt textures w/ mild sweetness in the finish and mild alcohol accent  T - Bitter cocoa, dark toffee, french pressed french roast coffee, caramel and high amounts of vanilla flavor-earthy bean like elements. A dark brown sugar, molasses and cocoa mix w/ mild caramel, dark plum fruit notes and hints of roasted barley. There is the taste of dark rum as the alchohol is present in the finish, with mild sweetness at around room temp.  D - Well brewed RIS w/ nitro usage I actually enjoyed. I am not normally a fan of the Nitro, but in this stout it is fantastic, Old Rasputin is a top -notch ale any way you cut it.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,SteveS1,3.73,"From the bottle to a glass- Look: Pitch black, only a hint of red at the edges. Thick bubbly brown head, little retention.  Smell: Sweet, malty, cherry, and yes, a bit of alcohol.  Taste: The taste begins with a dark cherry flavor, then fades quickly into a roasted chocolate. Aftertaste is of bitter alcohol.  Feel: Thick, heavy, a little carbonation.  Drink: The strong alcohol content and flavor keeps this from being any more than a sip and enjoy.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,mirish72,4.03,"I had picked this up in a mixed six. To be honest I haven't been too impressed by North Coast's other offerings, but I had high hopes for this one and wasn't disappointed.  Pours jet black with little head into a Portsmouth snifter. Smells great, chocolately, lots of malts and other good stuff in a RIS. Overall, it was really nicely done, with a nice even taste, without the sweetness that sometimes creeps into some RIS.  Definitely a keeper.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,AccidentalKate,4.3,"Appearance: A deep, dark, brown, nearly black. Very opaque and pours a thick lighter brown head that lasts quite some time. Light belgian lace when the head does dissipate.  Smell: A bold roast aroma, with a bit of mocha rounding it off. Little hops apparent.  Taste: Strong roast grain taste, straddling the border of carbon tasting, but pulling back at the last minute. The finish seems to last for ages, and shows it's true complexity there, with cocoa being somewhat prevalent, and molasses even more so, before the bitterness comes in like a bolt of lightening. Sweet aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Thick and full, with just enough carbonation to make it lightly pop on the tongue without overwhelming the flavors of the beer itself.  Drinkability: Very little in the way of flaws make this a great example of what I believe an Imperial Stout should taste like.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,GeezLynn,4.32,"Pours black with a light brown head that quickly fades, but continues to seep up.  Big malty aroma, mainly cocoa with vanilla.  Wonderful flavor - chocolate malt, espresso, vanilla, dark red fruit, slightly sweet with about as much hop flavor as you'll find in any RIS out there. Good cohesion. Hops and roasted malt contribute to a long, fairly bitter finish.  Medium bodied for the style, and sticky with plenty of carbonation.  This is a standby for good reason.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Very little carbonation which lead to a relatively fine head leaving little lacing.  S: sweet dark chocolate, roasted coffee, alcohol, and just a hint of some sort of dark fruit.  T: Opens sweet and malty leading to a chocolately middle with a hint of roasted raisin flavor. Ends alcoholic but there is almost no aftertaste.  M: medium bodied for an RIS with a coarsity that doesn't match its carbonation.  D: this one definitely lived up to the hype.

112,412,velosuds,4.15,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a clear pint glass. No freshness dating on bottle or label. Single purchased from local health foods store for $2.29.  A-Pours a deep, dark brown almost black hue with a two finger, creamy tan head with great retention and heavy lacing. A gorgeous craft beer.  S-Deep, dark chocolate and toasted malts and organic Turkish apricots. Also reminded me of chocolate pudding cake my mother used to make when I was a kid. The smell is wonderful.  T-Disappointing, in that it was not equal to the anticipation I expected from the aroma. Quite bitter with only a slight fruity finish. Improved as it warmed. Not a complex as I would have liked.  M-Robust, but very smooth with medium to full body. Warming due to the alcohol.  D-Good for a RIS, but not great. I like this and always want more when I finish a single 12 oz. bottle, but it doesn't achieve the rich complexity it aspires to.

112,412,mdwalsh,4.73,"A: A great 1+ finger head that you don't often find in this style of brew. Not something I take off for lacking, but give credit for having. I even see some active carbonation in there. It is, as one would hope, Black and black and black and black. I like it very much.  S: Dark, sweet fruit, some malt and maybe a hint of roasted barley? No hops, no overwhelming roast. I really get the smell of cooking chocolate, such as making fudge or melting chocolate for dipping fruit. Very good, not quite perfect though.  T: More sweet fruit, not so much on the raisin side but more so the cooked apple and plum sort of taste. Absolutely no sign of alcohol. If you told me this was an NA beer, I wouldn't doubt you. I don't get the gritty dryness of a roasted malt or anything. I really, really like this beer.  M: Proper thickness, not too thin, not to rich or creamy. It does have a mild carbonation bite and a little tingle afterward which is kinda funny, but all in all pretty good.  D: Very good taste, very doable, but the abv limits its true drinkability. But for the style, very good.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,silentjay,4.35,"the benchmark for the style. pours thick, black, and viscous, with a respectable tan-brown head. smells like a coffee shop that also makes wonderful chocolate-chip cookies. sounds weird, but i've been to a couple, and thats what it reminds me of. tastes sweet, roasty, creamy, and sinful. strong coffee up front, bitter chocolate with a hint of anise (not overpowering as in some RIS's) and with a sweet cream finish. mouthfeel is decently creamy. carbonation is subtle. drinkability is good for the style. dangerously smooth when a beer this strong should be more of a sipper.  a regular in my rotation. the best value as far as imperial stouts go. though i havent had brooklyn's BCS in a while so i hold the right to reverse that statement. one of the best RIS's, and one of the best stouts overall.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Mandrake,4.15,"Pours out quite thick, though not as close to motor oil as some recent imperial stouts I've seen. Hints of ruby red peek from around the edges of my glass, and the darkish tan head is light a frothy, lasting well but leaving little lacing. Nose is obviously well-hopped, with citrus and fruit notes hovering over the menacingly dark chocolate. Treacle and plum sit in the mix as well, fabulously complex and alluring. Taste is a minor step back, as the hops step forward and the vinous character takes a distinct back seat to the slam of coffee and chocolate. Still there is a nice note of tobacco in the mix, which keeps it lively and interesting. Mouthfeel is nice and thick, not overpowering though, and drinkability is solid. Very good stout, has everything you're looking for without necessarily being at the very top rank in its category.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Anthony1,4.5,"poured into a snifter  this thing pours like motor oil. a deep deep coco color with a whispy tan head.  smells like a chocolate expresso.

112,412,beerwolf77,4.57,Not much else can be said for this beer. For my own purposes thogh here's what I think. Poured into an imperial pint glass it's dark brown nearly black in color. The head is about 1 inch thick that is tan in color. The aroma is chocolate and coffee. Roast malt with a fresh baked preztle hint to it. The flavor is a delicious blend of coffee and chocolate. Hints of bready malt shine through as well. A moderate hop bite sneaks in at the end. I feel it has a medium body to full body that never feels heavy considering the style. This is one of the most drinkable RIS I've ever had. It's not cloyingly sweet or thick and syrupy like this style tends to lean towards. I could see downing a few of these. Although the higher ABV might have a thing to say in my descision.,North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Onenote81,4.19,"Finally getting around to trying this beer. I keep passing it up in the store, but now I wonder why I waited so long.  Poured into my snifter a dark thick black with a thin tan head on top. No retention, and very little sticky lacing. Smells of big coffee overtones, roasted cocoa beans, and dark bread. The mouth is bit spritzy for the style, but it finishes creamy and smooth.  This is a freaking stellar RIS. Big coffee presence that finishes with a bitter dark chocolate twang. There is absolutely nothing harsh about this. The roasted characteristics are mellow and very subtle. This is one of the most drinkable big dark beers I've ever had. I will make sure this is most always in my fridge from here on out. Great beer.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,cnally,4.21,"I have had this before, but I have never had the chance to review. So let's dip into this mean bastard!  The appearance is wickedly amazing--pitch black and a massive tan head, with plenty of lacing.  A woodsy aroma, coffee, chocolate, burnt wood, with a bit of nuttiness, but dark nuts like walnut and brazil nuts.  You can take the flavor many ways. Here is my take. The mocha, bitter, burnt wood, oaty flavor is deep, and dark. Evil. It is oppressive in its intensity. Old Rasputin wants to bring you to your knees. It wants you to say, ""This is too much smoke flavor at the finish!"" Or, ""This is making my head spin!"" And there are few beers that can bring you into its world. Old Rasputin is one of those.  The feel is heavy, sticky and like oil. Thick and viscous.  This may be, for all its amazing qualities, the least drinkable great beer. The flavor is so intense and sharp that drinking it is truly a chore. It is the difference for me between Old Rasputin being the finest beer I have had in my life, to it being a great beer that I rarely find myself purchasing.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,bmwats,4.42,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a standard pint.  A: Really dark brown. Pours into a 2 finger greyinsh brown, frothy head. Settles fairly slowly, but leaves a little foam on the surface. Heavy initial lacing slowly retreats back into the brew leaving some remnants on the sides of the glass.  S: Roasted malt, dark bittersweet chocolate, a little almond, a little butterscotch, and a smoky woody tone.  T: Dark roasted coffee (very prominent) and bittersweet chocolate. Has a pungent hoppiness, and strong alcohol flavor. Almost like really malty, but not not sweet Kahlua.  M: Thick, hearty, and robust. Again, strong alcohol envelops the whole palette. Leaves a pungent, but by no means overpowering, peaty aftertaste.  D: Very good brew to sip and savor.  Ok, this brew has awesome atmosphere. Beautiful dark brown pour, with a nice little foamy head.

A nice lacing is left as it does so.  Smell: oatmeal and milk chocolate with just the subtlest hint of coffee. It's not letting me down.  Taste: alcohol, of course, which to me adds a bit of a fruity character, but at 9% I'd expect nothing less. Deeply roasted malts, again a little coffee; there's a nice bitterness which I quite like juxtaposed with the almost chocolate-stout aroma.  Mouthfeel: thick, creamy ... downright Imperial.

Pours slowly with little carbonation and a beautiful black color capped with a rich, mocha colored, frothy head.  The smell is really complex, hints of brown sugars and burnt grain infused with chocolate and some great malts and definately some coffee.  Taste is fantastic. Goes down very easy, despite its being 9%abv, and the chocolate undertones and rich grains really make this one a treat. The coffee infusion is present in the aftertaste.

112,412,SpdKilz,4.08,"Reviewed via notes from a while ago.  Appearance - Pours out black as night, very similar to the used Mobile 1 5W-30 drained from the SpdKilz TT Z06 after two thousand miles! Less than a finger of head that is mocha in color. Amazing lacing - stays the entire drink.  Smell - Immediately I am struck by the coffee sent. I smell some dark fruits (cherries) in my nose also - though not much. A lingering alcohol smell is notable also.  Taste - Like I am drinking a bitter coffee with semi-sweet chocolate/cocoa. First sip is hard for me to handle (for the first ever one - subsequent Old R's I'm prepared for and enjoy the first sip greatly). The alcohol is present but is not a put off and is not prevalent with the initial sip - more of an after ""thought.""  Mouthfeel - Quite thick - decent amount of carbonation. This is a very heavy beer and is almost syrupy (but not quite).  Drinkability - Don't think I could have more than two of these in a sitting but at 9% abv that should create a quite nice feeling for me. Overall quite drinkable and again, not a session beer but I can't wait to enjoy this when the California nights turn a bit colder during fall.

A - Black onyx body with a hint of deep ruby around the bottom and a perfect finger's width of dense, creamy tan froth that just retained amazingly and deposited a thick web of psychedelic lace all around the glass. A beautiful nitro pour indeed!  S - Chocolate and roasted malt with hints of hazlenuts and licorice. Subtle coffee notes and dark fruit emerge in the background. An earthy hop presence is also apparent, albeit quite restrained.  T - Luscious sweet and semi-sweet chocolate and cocoa up front with lots of roasted goodness and a prominent nutty character suggesting hazlenuts. Earthy, leafy hops impart an herbal aspect, which extends into the finish and, along with a coffee character, provides ample bitterness.  M - Medium to full bodied with a super creamy, smooth texture and soft carbonation akin to a cask pour. Moderately dry, bitter finish with some residual sweetness on the palate. Minimal alcohol warmth, especially for a 9% RIS.  D - Fantastic RIS indeed, and especially smooth and drinkable on nitro. Yum!

Had this brew as a halfpint at the North Coast Brewing in Fort Bragg. Deep deep brown, not black, and barely any light gets through it.  Aroma is a crazy cocoa bomb, with some coffee dryness and espresso.  Some alcohol warming from the 9%er and waves of chocolate, coffee, roasted burnt malt, and some sugary molassas sweetness.  Thick syrupy mouthfeel, not as potent as abyss or dark lord, but it's up there. A good slow sipper of a beer.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Bammo22,4.3,"This is officially my first attempt at reviewing, so bear with me! I'd also like to state, this tasting was my first real foray into this style. (Not an easy beer to review being such an amateur.) I've had a few of your standard American & English Stouts, and of course, plenty of Guinness & Murphy's. Actually I have had the pleasure of tasting a RIS before, FFF's Dark Lord on Memorial Day this year. However this was after I had PLENTY of my friend's homebrewed Saison & Belgium Pale. To say the least, it was like I was hit with a ton of bricks when I had Dark Lord. I figured if I'd just sit down and give this style a real try, it knew it might be something I'd like. So with all that in mind, on to my review...  Poured from a 12oz bottle into a snifter.  It poured a thick black, motor oil-ish body, with a little less than a one finger, dark tan head. The head dissipated fairly quick into a thin film, not much lacing. Little carbonation.  Still training my nose to pick up on various notes. Bittersweet chocolate is evident, coffee, roasted malts, and dark fruits.  The taste is very similar to the smell and the alcohol is well hidden, considering it's strength.  Feels a bit oily, but still smooth and creamy. A nice finish on the tongue to last, but also leaves you wanting more!  Very drinkable for a beer this complex. I would even recommend it to my Mom, who I just turned on to easy-going Belgium Wit's and the like, and who's once idea of a great beer was Corona.  I look forward to exploring other RIS's and Double Stouts. Till we meet again, Ol' Rasputin...",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

The head slowly climbed up to the crest and formed a thick head that resembled brown shaving cream. Color is dark brown with caramel ribbons.  Smells of chocolate and sweet toffee like malts  Chocolate, bitter, burnt, warming malts and nutty lingering finish tantalize the palate. Big, bold, robust, meal in a glass. It is different with each sip as it warms it mellows and more flavors come through like black liqourice.  Feels perfect. From the froth that sticks to your mustache to the creamy finish.

112,412,SpencerSauce,4.12,"What a beer. Brought one of these to a kegger and it was very out of place. Partly because id walk around with my own pint glass i brought. I offered some to a girl i know and she actually liked the chocolate taste she got. Though it is a meal in a glass. I even met a beer advocate at the party and we had a good convo on hefeweizens.  A- black but not thick like motor oil. brown head and lots of it by the way i poured this one. The head after a while is replaced by a brown film covering the beer until finish and it seems that same film of foam is deposited in the bottom after being drank.  S- heavy one the coffee but not dark esspresso. a milk choco smell not an86% cacoa. Also can discern a malt thing going on, but maybe thats just the chocolate playing with my nose.  T- Contrary to the smell i get a dark chocolate taste,with a coffee the strength of a reg french roast. This is a thick milky creamy coffee kind of beer. You can tell its a malt explosion without an extremely malty finish. If your on the same frequebcy as me.  M- This is a thick monster, not as thick as a palo santo marron though, and its just a brown ale. I always say a beer is what a brewer wants it to be. Its all at their discrepency. But this beer is by no means a light one. I would only want to drink a couple of these in a row. and thats maybe.  D- not too easy. I love RIS but one can only stand so much cake before one throws up. Rasputin is like cake. Very rich and decadent. While on the other side. Alcoholic and sharp. Its the best of both worlds.  Rasputin was a pyschic, healer, scholar, political advisor, corrupt rebel, intelectual, and loving father. He was a pilgrim from the time he was 18 when he was in a monastary repenting a theft for 3 months. After that theyre are records of him healing people similar to the way jesus did. When he was assinated it took them many tries. First he was stabbed and his guts where spilled out. After primitive surgery ( remember this is 200 years before the civil war) he was walking again. Then he was poisened with cyanide when he was thought too powerful an advisor .en shot later in life, then when that failed they beat him into uncounsciosness and he was thrown into the same river his brother and sister at different times had drowned in. Autopsy claims rasputins reason of death drowning.  Not fatal shooting,stabbing, poisening, or beating. The water in the lungs is only a peice of evidence that leads to the autopsy claims.

Taste is dark chocolate & malty with a thick and creamy mouthfeel  To me, this is a very drinkable beer, I could put down many of these.

112,412,vegantreats,5,"Poured from a bottle into a glass, this beer was darker then my cast iron skillet. Truly beautiful color to this beer! Almost no head was left a minute after pouring, just a slight ring around the glass. Though, immediately after pouring a light brown foaminess was present. The notes in this beer changed throughout, upon pouring I was hit with an oceany seaweed saltiness which, after a minute, turned into heady roasted chocolate malt scent. Finally I was left with a slight hint of burnt coffee. A deep inhalation will let the drinker take note of the alcohol present. This beer is thick with an almost creamlike consistency. The taste; wow, even a minute after a sip of this beer my taste buds feel like they are fizzing with flavor, very deep strong taste throughout the whole palate. This is a great beer if you like stouts, if you don't like very heavy heady beer, I wouldn't even try this beer. Personally, I love stouts, and have very rarely had a stout better then this one, in fact only one comes to mind, though it isn't available where I live. I would, and do, drink this beer often.

I'd probably guess it was more around 18 months, however.  A: Jet black in color with a creamy, thick, and slow-to-recede chocolate milkshake colored head. It retains quite well, with a relatively thick layer of foam retaining atop throughout in my large bowl snifter.  S: Very rich bittersweet chocolate, some light coffee, dark fruit notes, some vanilla. Quite rich and invigorating.  T&M: With age the hops have mellowed out substantially, revealing a very complex and excellent stout. Flavor starts with a confluence of dark chocolate covered black cherries, raisins, and other dark fruits before segueing into a pleasant roasted malt component. Finish is long, distinct, and savory and features espresso, dark chocolate, burnt black malt, and all kinds of wonderful dark flavors. Quite pleasant. Body is full and a tad bit oily (yet also creamy) with a restrained carbonation that just tickles the tongue.  D: Rather quaffable considering the ABV and body.

Mouthfeel: Medium feel due to the level of carbonation, but this beer coats the tongue with a lovely, smooth feel after you swallow.  Drinkability: Simply put, this is just an outstanding RIS. In these times of super rare, over-hyped beers, I almost forget about great beers like this. It's relatively easy to find and the price for a four pack is a steal. I've been drinking this beer for years and plan on drinking it for many more years to come. A classic; don't just buy a single, you're going to want more.

112,412,TequilaSauer,4.21,"The mere definition of a bargain RIS, Old Rasputin has been satisfying my dark beer cravings for years. I figured I might as well go ahead and review it.  It's a beautiful looking stout, about as perfect as it gets. Light head retention sitting atop an abyss of black nothing.  Smell is nice, milk chocolate and toffee dominate with little else to report. Good, not great.  Attacks with a creamy chocolate pudding that lingers pleasantly on the palette for quite some time. There's a slight alcohol tinge but it only adds to the deliciousness. Eventually, the chocolate fades into a smooth hoppiness with a slightly smokey finish. It's not the most complex stout in the world, but it's intense, yet pleasant and elegant. It is the perfect late night, after-dinner stout, in my opinion.  It's a silky, magnificent brew that always delights the senses and never offends. It's not a beer you could drink one after the other, but it's one that is always worth having in the fridge. Old Rasputin is in a word, essential.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,krisandajt,4.32,"Appearance: Pours a think, almost syrupy black with about an inch of thick bubbly head. Very nice retention with little lacing.  Smell: Sweet chocolate and coffee. As the beer warms, the smell of roasted malts really comes out.  Taste: A nice roasted sweetness dominates, followed by subtle hints of chocolate and coffee.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth, almost creamy in texture. A mild carbonation leaves a slight tingle on the tongue.  Drinkability: One of the easiest drinking imperial stouts I've ever had. Very smooth and tasty with no single flavor dominating the other. I will absolutely pick myself up some more of this.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,BBThunderbolt,4.7,"Served in straight pint glass. Poured a beautiful black, with a lovely cascade ascending into 3/4 inch of dark tan head that had excellent retention and left a moderate amount of lacing.  Rich roasted malt aromas greet the nose, without the annoying coffee notes so often found in brews of this type. Those deep scents translate into a glorious flavor on the tongue. Nothing exotic, edgy, radical or extreme, just the exact stout experience you're looking for.  The body is wonderfully full, smooth, textured and coats the tongue like a well-worn jacket. Easily drinkable, this is one of the big stouts I have several of in a row. Truly a world-class brew, if this is not available locally it's certainly worth much effort to obtain it by whatever means at your disposal.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,adamette,4.59,"Poured from a 12 oz. stubby bottle that I purchased as a single at Cost Plus World Market for about $2.50 into my Murphy's Irish Red pint glass. I was really looking forward to trying this beer that I previously had on nitro-tap.  A Surprisingly little to no head despite a moderately vigorous pour in which I was trying to get a head. Body is absolutely black, letting almost no light through. I liked the look of the nitro version better which is likely the more recommended way to pour this beer.  S Dark malt, chocolate and even alcohol to the nose. I really love this smell!  T Yep, that is great! The greatest combination of dark malt, chocolate, alcohol and even some hops tastes in a classic, expertly produced beer.  M Creamy, but no carbonation made it a bit flat (see comments about lack of head). The MUCH creamier nitro-tap version solved that issue with a great, creamy feel and carbonation that stays with you all of the way through.  D Great. Really, for a style that does not lend itself to heavy drinkability, I looked down and I could not believe that I only had 1/4 of it left.  Notes: Seek out the nitro-tap for a full experience.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,ThatWineGuy,4.4,"Purchased in March at Premier Gourmet, Buffalo, no BB date ... this probably never expires anyway. Opaque black, half finger mocha-tan head with some slow moving bubbles at the edges observed under a bright light. Head shrunk slowly to a cloudy, wispy inter-connected cluster of small bubble centres spread about the perimeter. Sheet lacing and an overall creamy appearance remained. Sure looks promising!  Smell of dark chocolate, baker's chocolate with associated bitterness, toast, cocoa and with air some chocolate cake with icing aroma. Sufficiently complex, all of it good. The taste is a rich strong coffee and dark chocolate blend with coffee bean astngency in the finish, the middle being dry and bitter but nicely balanced. Dense mouthfeel with substantial body, smooth creamy texture. With air and warming, this RIS was more astringent, chocolate wafer aromas emerged, a swirl quickly regenerated life in the glass.  Like all RIS, this is not meant for quaffing or casual imbibing but rather to be sipped and savoured. This is a very good example of the style and in league with the big boys. A must try.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,callmescraps,3.63,"Not always my favorite style, but I see this guy around all the time and finally decided to give it a bid.  Appearance - Black. Ok, maybe just very, very, very dark brown. Pretty much black. An inch of mocha head hangs around and laces nicely. Looks like a winner.  Smell - Lots of dark fruits. Cherries and chocolate come first. There is almost a prune thing going on. Lots of chocolate and roast malt. A hint of smoke.  Taste - Follows the smell. Lots of chocolate and cherry up front. There is a lot of roast on the finish. Honestly, it seems a little thin. Just sort of sits there in the middle. Almost some tart fruit randomly in there, which is unsettling.  Mouthfeel - Decidedly thin. Just not luxurious enough. Almost watery. Eh.  Drinkability - Not bad, but that might be because it doesn't seem to have enough working. The roast follows unpleasantly.  This is a fine beer. Pretty good, but not doing anything special for me. Quite disappointed with the body. Otherwise, it's a very good bang for your buck, but it's not the worst idea to spend a few more bucks.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,david18,4,"Tried this one a few times and I like it a lot. Not as great as some say it is but a very good imperial stout. I'm not sure what the difference between a Russian Imperial Stout and and American Imperial stout is (I think american has more hops) but this is one you should get if you can find it.

This brew has a great robust smell; chocolate, roasted malts, some citrus hops.  This brew tastes big and roasted; chocolate taste with a nice hop kick. Has a thick creamy mouthfeel. Has some tart fruit tastes in there as well. Finishes very smooth and balanced, leaves a tad bit of stickyness on the tongue - excellent.  This a damn fine Russian Imperial Stout - one of the finest I have had. A drinkable, delicious tasting brew. The alcohol presence is there but is blended rather nicely. Very nice brew - a sipper and savor brew, not a session type. Damn fine.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,prosper,3.94,"Pours a very, very dark brown. Not quite black, but opaque still. Frothy tan head, good retention, lots of lace. Nice cascading effect when poured aggressively as the head died down. Couldn't ask for more.  Smells are faint. Dark sweet caramel, sticky malt sweetness, plenty of citrus hops.  Taste is very interesting. A good balance of the malt sweetness of a barleywine, roasted malts, dark, dried-fruit caramel, Roasty bitterness and pleasant herbal hoppy bitterness. Plenty of late-hop character, citrus and such, but I don't think any dry hops. If not for the hops, I think it might taste like cough syrup.  Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy, but finishes surprisingly clean. Still, it's sticky on the palate.

I like stouts ok, but seeing as though lately I have been getting into really big beers, I wanted to broaden my world by trying some styles I don't normally go for.  A - thick motor oil black w/ a purty creamy brown head and fairly decent retention  S - tons of chocolate(like a freakin' milkshake, yum!) roasted, nealy burnt malt, and espresso  T - spicy and much more bitter than expected. lots of chocolate and heavy coffee flavor. grainy/earthy hops are a suprising participant and welcome addition to the mix. i like, dare i say ""love"" ?

112,412,Andreji,4.23,"So much talk about this old russian fellow around here certainly aroused my interest so I brought one of these back home from the states and have kept it cellared now for about 4 months (hey, that's a record for me, mind you).  I decided to pop this one open on a sunny bogota afternoon while on break from my rural internship.  No less mystical than i expected it at first, very, very sombre pour with little to absolutely no transparency. head is dirty, very very dark and frothy, savage and very difficult to fully attain. by the looks of this, from the bottle with an old photo of this infamous russian character to the last bit of the very unpredictable pour, this beer retains an air of uneasyness- a brilliant one at it. kudos, this has to be one of the most peculiar and unique looking beers i've poured.  The smell is really hard to understand as well. a post-imperial russia industrious metallic pungency hides an underlying sugary, burnt caramel feel. dark cacao seems to be very present throughout.  The taste is great. very very smokey feel with underlying alcohol roasted sugar feel, strong dark coffee and a stingy bitterness attacks the side of the tongue through the whole deal. I hate to sound cheesy, but it arouses the senses very thoroughly. and the feel is amazing, thick bodied, fizzy, like the bottom of a cup of fresh ground coffee.  It gets to you quick, through, and you'll know you've been struck by this dark-souled russian when you least expect it. not a session beer, not a kind-tasting belgian, this beer is a monster you'll find yourself hunting down again and again.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Buschyfor3,4.43,"New Review - 5-year aged bottle, served 12/20/14  A: Same viscous, black pour; fully opaque; a finger thick worth of chocolate milk colored head quickly recedes to a collar of very fine bubbles; rings of lace on the drink down.  S: Mellowed slightly, but still tons of dark roast malt, cold coffee, dark fruits and bittersweet dark chocolate.  T: Smooth blend of heavily roasted malts, black coffee, sweet, rum-soaked dark fruits (raisin, figs, cherry?), molasses, bittersweet chocolate and doughy brown bread; finish is long, with a lingering bitterness from heavy roast, used coffee grounds and extra dark, bittersweet chocolate (80%+ cacao)  M: Smooth, velvety, creamy  O: Time has definitely tamed the boozy punch of this massive RIS, but it still retains all of the nuanced complexities of a fresh bottle. Very nice.   Serving: 12oz bottle poured into my Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass.  A: Dark, rich, muddy, murky brown pour - about as close to black as you can get while still retaining enough of a ruddy, deep mahogany tinge. Head looks like I poured milk chocolate into my glass - chocolatey-khaki brown, creamy with bubbles dotting the surface and extending to a good finger's depth. Lacing is sticky and coats the side of the glass with each sip.  S: The first whiff delivers many a roasted aromas - roasted black coffee, espresso beans, burnt toast, roasted sweet malts. Next come some flashes of dark fruitiness and dark, cocoa-like chocolate - chocolate covered cherries perhaps? Just a slight boozy sting rounds out the nose. Quite inviting.  T: I'm getting little flashes of everything in the nose assaulting my palate all at once. Starts up front with a dark fruity sweetness like rum soaked raisins and dark cherries. That is quickly followed by just the slightest flash of bitterness - possibly the only hop presence in the whole beer - that lasts for no more than a second or two. Then the roasted flavors spring forth with a salvo of black coffee, burnt toast and a charcoal/earthy wood flavor. A mellowing bittersweet chocolate and licorice kicks in to balance out the roastiness along with some hints of molasses and brown sugar. A slightly boozy/medicinal alcohol note appears right before the finish but fades behind the reintroduction of roasted malts, coffee and buttered breakfast toast which ride out to the finish.  M: Carbonation creates a creamy, slick mouthfeel. So good - what a big, bold stout should feel like. It goes down super easy on the swallow and coats the esophagus.  D: Honestly, I find this to be the easiest drinking RIS I've tried to this point, and that is not to discredit some of the superb RIS I've tried (yes, you, Stone 09 IRS). This stout is high ABV but it's not as nearly as hot as the fresh Stone IRS I reviewed earlier this year. In 12oz form, it is easy to put down a full bottle without much delay - had this been in a bomber, well it might be a different story. Nonetheless, I have to say it was much more enjoyable and much less of a chore to finish off a bottle.  A fantastic RIS.

Very thick with a nice tan head. Lacing is very prominent.  S: Smells very malty with a nice roastyness. Hints of chocolate and coffee, but not overpowering.  T: Very flavorful and tasty Imperial Stout. Lots of roasted malts with a nice smoke character. Chocolate is more dominant than the coffee, but is blended very well. Nothing really overpowers in the flavor, its very well balanced overall. Not nearly as intense as say Founders Imperial Stout, Great Divide Yeti, or Bells Expedition, but an excellent offering nonetheless.  M: Full-bodied and coats the mouth nicely. I have had thicker beers, but this is very nice overall.  D: Full-bodied and full of flavor, this is one you will revisit often. However more than one at a time is not recommended. Very smooth and tasty.  Fairly common and widely available, this is one that almost anybody can enjoy.

Appearance: Brown-black, like a stout-porter, and with a nice, one-finger tan head. Laced very nicely down the glass too, definitely looked the part of a RIS.  Smell: Chocolaty, slight coffee, and earthy. You can smell a bit of smoke too, and reminds me of a nice, sit-by-the-fire smell.  Taste: Roasted barley malts and bready, smoky taste wash over the palate with markedly low bitterness to it in comparison to other Imperial Stouts, and not in a bad way.  Mouthfeel: Not overly thick or heavy as RIS tend to be and I expect, but this was lighter and made more of a drinker than a sipper. Finishes very clean and with a hint of coffee left at the end.  Drinkability: For the style, it's up there. Much, much more drinkable as far as having more than one goes, and I could certainly enjoy more than one of these in a row, and for this style, that's saying something.

There are some flowery hops that combine with the malts to give it a mild soapy scent. The taste starts with a strong citrus hop flavor uncharacteristic of most stouts. There are bitter chocolate and coffee roasted malts undertones. The bitterness bites on the sides of the tongue, but as the beer warms to room temperature it becomes less noticeable. The after taste coats the mouth with a hoppy flavor.  This is a full bodied beer that has some creaminess to it. Carbonation is pleasant.  This is not what I was expecting in a stout. I never thought it would be this hoppy, this is kind of like a stout for someone that likes IPAs. It has the bitterness of the IPA and the thickness of a stout. This is not my style of beer.

T- dry roast flavors of malt and well-hidden alcohol, edged with caramel. After the swallow is a lingering aftertaste of dark chocolate and something that reminds me of spring water, which is perfect alongside the chocolate.

112,412,Patrick999,3.86,"I always see this on the supermarket shelves, a BA Top 100 beer, but never pick it up. This time, I picked it up. Here we go:  This one is going into the snifter. Pours a suitably opaque black/brown, with a very nice cap of espresso crema-like foam.  Aromatics are a bit muted, consisting mostly of caramel macchiato and light carob.  Taste is mostly roasted coffee with some earthy hop bitterness. Sweet, but dried out pretty well by the roastiness.  Feel is creamy, but not poetically so.  Solid imperial stout, but I'm going out on a limb to say it's a bit overrated, especially given this site's adoration for the RIS style.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,donmonkey1,4.23,"Appearance: Pours black with a really nice frothy brown head. The head isn't going anywhere soon either. Excellent lacing. I can tell immediately by looking at this beer that it's got to be great.  Smell: Chocolate, molasses, nutty.  Taste: Nutty, coffee, raisin, molasses. There's a sweetness with a hint of alcohol.  Mouthfeel: Thick and a bit stingy.  Drinkability: This is an outstanding beer but it's like rich chocolate, you can only handle so much at one time.

112,412,spartan30,4.23,"This is my first BA review! I'm pleased to have the opportunity to review one of my favorite styles not to mention a beer I've been dying to try!  The appearance was exactly what you'd expect of the style dark and inviting with a half inch of rusty colored head with some lacing.  The smell was wonderful, a pleasant bouquet of chocolate,raisins and molasses with a pleasantly balanced roasted aroma bringing it all together.  The taste didn't disappoint either. This brew is a dessert all by itself. It has an alcoholic modesty and a rich complex flavor that could win over the most resistant to the style.  The mouth feel was a bit lighter than I expected not coating the mouth like others of the same style but again, the taste more than makes up for this.  Good drinkability a hardy beer but gentle and not overly boozy. Definitely a bargain for the quality.

If Darth Vader was drinking its blackedy black goodness it would blend in with his outfit, unless it was in front of his blippidy blip lighty light thing. The froth at the top would stand out too...its not black, but pretty close. What you would videy the blackest a cloud in the sky could get.  Smell: eh..I couldn't smell anything...  Taste: As always with one of my reviews, I can't quite put to words what I taste so I'll just blurt out some words. Sweet..or bittersweet with 75 percent sweet, 25 percent bitter. Hazelnut? I know, weird, right? coffee, chocolate and more chocolate.  Mouthfeel: Smoooth. It's funny really the way it teases. It's just a hint of the taboo, not too much to turn you off.

Tan colored head lingers on the surface, leaving a nice lacing.  Smell- Coffee notes. Roasted malts. A nice, bitter sweet aroma.  Taste- A complexity of coffee, chocolate, and sweet, roasted malts.  Mouthfeel- Full Bodied, with low-medium carbonation.  Drinkability- This one was pretty strong. Good stuff, but this is definitely an occasional beer for me.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

S: Coffee, sweet malt, and hints of cocoa. Underlying sweetness of fruit maybe raisin.  T: Really Good. All of the aromas are appropriately translated in the flavors. The pallet is blessed with malt coffee heaven. The sweetness is present at intro- duction and a slight hop is there to say good-bye.  M: Really great carbonation with a full bodied and a near perfect consistency, not at all thin while not nearly heavy.

Nose had a nice sweetness about it that balanced the hops well  Taste: Spectacular. The nitro-tap makes all the difference with this beer. I have also had it from a bottle which is good, but the tap version had all of the freshness and bright, warm flavor I have no come to expect from this beer. Personally, I would like to see a bit more hops, especially from a west coast company.  Mouth Feel: Silky smooth, liquid velvet. Smooth light nitrogen carbonation.

112,412,lukymann,4.48,"Quite a pleasure to have this brew on nitro-tap... grabbed it at Deep Ellum in Allston.  A - After the beer settles out it is dark and largely opaque with a great creamy khaki colored, inch-thick head. Looked like a great dessert beer if ever I've seen one.  S - Earthy smell with overtones of chocolate. Roasted malts are unsurprisingly prevalent.  T - Excellent. Strong Espresso and chocolate flavors at the front that settle into a burnt malt residue on your tongue. A good representation of the style.  F - Two words: Creamy goodness. The smoothness of this beer on nitro is hard to describe (and it is well matched to the beer's flavor). As good as this beer is from the bottle, this presentation went well beyond surpassing my expectations.  D - The 9% ABV is not all that apparent as you're drinking. As tempting as it was to have more than one, this is not really a session beer and I moved on to something slightly less robust.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

It has also has a slight alcohol taste towards the end, yet not an unpleasant one.  M- Not as thick or oily as I'm used to with other RIS's. It's a little too thin for my taste and the carbonation contributes to this. After excessive swirling, it feels a lot smoother.  D- Pretty high for a RIS.

The aroma is rich, dark toast, rich bittersweet chocolate, stwed fermented prunes, wet potting soil, blackstrap mollasses - very rich and very nice.  The taste is simlar, rich fermented prunes and currants stewed with bvlackstrap molasses, along with dark toast, dark chocolate, singed leaves, peppery-anise spice.

Appearance- completely black with no hints of anything else even when held to light. Head poured just over two inches and is dark brown, very chunky. Leaves lace all down the glass as you drink  Smell- Coffee, Dark roasty malts. Two big surprises for me. Considering everything I've read or heard about the style, I didn't expect the hops in the nose (though it is certainly welcome). Also, not as much chocolate as I expected.  Taste- Ah there's the chocolate I missed in the smell! Very malty with a nice little hop bitterness coming through on the back of the tongue. Extremely balanced and very tasty!  Mouthfeel- Rich, thick, and creamy just like a stout should be. This however takes it to that next level of creaminess. It reminded me of drinking egg nog if that makes sense.  Drinkability- You wouldnt know it was 9% unless you read the label. Alcohol is hidden very well. This is very rich and definately a slow sipping beer.

112,412,MadTown1000,3.5,"Pours dark and thick and heavy into a pint glass with the kind of dissipating-from-the-bottom-up foam you generally see with nitro-cans. The several inches of brown-white large-bubble foam that remain on top just stay there. Given 2 minutes, about 2/3 of it is still there, with major lacing along the part that's receded. The beer itself is a very dark chocolate brown with almost no hint of translucency.  The smell out of the bottle is sweet, roasted caramel malt, not quite the chocoalte or coffee flavors I've noted on some other imperial stouts. Not quite as strong as I've noted on some others either. Almost as strong out of the glass as out of the bottle. Quite inviting.  Taste is a touch more bitter than I like in the style. It's got a bit of a sting to it, and the bitter sticks around longer than the aforementioned sweet caramel malt and other swirling accompanying flavors. Most prominent note is something like roasted espresso beans. It's tasty, but not what I'd hold up as an exemplar of the style. If you like your sweet paired with bitter, though, it might be just for you.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Retention is great. Very nice lacing.  S - Smell of dark roasted malts. Coffee and chocolate are very present. Sweet alcohol is present as well.  T - Very warm and inviting chocolate tastes almost like biting into a cake. Nice roasted dryness in the middle of the tongue and some mild alcoholic sweetness is there as well. It's hard to put into words how good this beer tastes. Hop character is very mild and towards the end. Some hints of coffee as well.  M - Creamy and smooth. Good CO2.

Big roasted coffee flavor, full-bodied with a surprising amount of carbonation. Some dark fruit. Hides its ABV well; excellent drinkability.

Toasty and a little creamy  M - medium to heavy mouthfeel  D - at first i thought it was rather light for a stout but it gets heavier and more complex as itwarms and the flavors become even more pronounced  Overall, one of the best stouts I have ever had.

T - Not as sweet as it smells, which is welcome -- so many RIS seem a bit too sweet for me. Dark coffee, some earthy overtones. And alcohol. Wasn't sure about it at first, but as I get past the halfway mark it's growing on me.  M - Not as thick as I had imagined. Some alcohol burn, seems grainy for some reason, and oily. But it works for the most part.  D - Definitely warming me up. The high ABV makes me think I should stick to just one, but as I finish the first I'm already craving another.

The beer was very thick and dark. When I held it up to the light, not much passed through. The head foam was very stiff. The beer had a high enough viscosity to cling to the sides of the glass when swirled a bit. The initial taste had hints of sweet fruitiness, but was quickly replaced with a nice strong bitter taste of malt. There was a hint of an aftertaste that I could do without.

Almost two-fingers of creamy, cappucino colored foam create the head. Retention is excellent and lacing is in sticky, thick lines.  Big dark chocolate covered caramels. Good hints of dark coffee. Slight booziness. Hints of dark cherries. Nice roastiness.  Massive dark chocolate covered dark roasted coffee beans. Light touches of heavy cream. Espresso notes. Huge roasted malt profile. Good dose of charred grain flavor. Very light hints of caramel and black cherries.  Solid full-bodied brew. Very smooth and delightfully creamy. This is exactly how beer should feel.  Very drinkable. The 9%ABV is very well hidden inside this one. Not really even a whole lot of warming effect, which is surprising, at this ABV level.  Notes on 1-year old bottle:  Looks very similar to fresh, including head and lacing. Smell has totally mellowed/evened out. Much sweeter now, with caramel and molasses moving to the forefront and coffee and chocolates taking the backseat. The roasted malts are still prominent in the taste.

Medium to full-bodied, prickly carbonation disperses the weight nicely. Black licorice, dark chocolate, coffee bean and brazil nuts give it some breadth.

Taste is a velvety smooth, creamy mix of dark chocolate and charred grains, sweetening a bit with some creamier chocolate, dark cherry and maybe a hint of caramel. Finish is semi-dry lingering burnt grains with just a touch of further chocolate sweetness.  Mouthfeel is really creamy, but the carbonation surprises me near the finish, giving the beer a lively feel. Feels like it sticks and crawls around your mouth, coats it very nicely.

It had about 3 fingers of dark brown head that very, very slowly settled into a constant thick foam.  The aroma was surprisingly muted. Got some chocolate malt and coffee in the back with a strong whiff of alcohol. Other reviews described a more pronounced aroma so not sure what it wrong on this particular bottle. What is there is good but needed more of the chocolate and coffee to stand out to offset the phenol. The taste was much better than the aroma with the flavors standing out more. Again, it could have used some more choc/coffee to offset the alcohol taste. Nice bitter finish. Mouthfeel was nice and creamy with good carbonation and the bitter finish.  Overall, a really good but not outstanding RIS. Not sure if I got a bad sample so will try again to be sure. Do give high recommend.

Not much to look at, but fits the style well.  S - Dark roasted chocolate malts with some cocoa and coffee notes but also very dry wheat with a little alcohol spicy burn.  T - Hearty and rich of dark, heavily roasted chocolate malts. So heavily roasted that there is a very bitter coffee-like flavor going on. Strong spicy alcoholic finish.  M - Viscous and full-bodied, it's not syrupy, but it sure is a thick beer. Bitter and slightly astringent on the finish as well as dry.  D - Good beer that deserves time for sipping and warming for nuances to be pulled out. Hard drinkability but a very good sipper.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Vixie,4.45,"Pours very thick, llooks and has the consistency of used motor oil. The only other beer I've had that this resembles is Goose Island Bourbon County Stout. Very black, if there's any other color here, I don't have enough light to reveal it. Head is short and brown, dissipates quickly.  Smell is strong, lots of coffee and chocolate there. Also there is a sweetness there, a bit of toffee, maybe some raising and molasses as well. Quite a bit going on.  Complex taste, there's a lot of chocolate there, as well as coffee. Reminds me of what you taste when you drink a good coffee while eating a high quality piece of chocolate, the coffee and chocolate are distinct, yet compliment each other well. Finishes with a bold hops taste, and a bit of alcohol warming.  Feel is quite solid, could stand to be a touch thicker, but leaves you with no doubt this is a serious beer.  It would be hard to drink a lot of this at one sitting due to the strength, but this is another of what I have termed a reward beer. Too good to just drink casually ,this one is one to savor and enjoy as a special treat.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,merryjoulton,4.34,"Pours a deep black, but light still comes through in the edges as a translucent brown.

The body of the beer is black coffee, impervious to light.  The taste begins sweet and malty; delicious coffee and molasses notes follow, and a bit of a bitter chocolate kick.  The mouthfeel is superb; medium gravity, moderate carbonation, extremely palate-friendly.  Old Rasputin brings a 9% abv and masks the alcohol very well. It's a delicious, very drinkable RIS.

S - Sweet smells of dark chocolate, roasted malts and a hint of coffee liquer.  T - Delicious! This is full of big roasted malt flavors. The chocolate flavors hit you first, and then the hops make their pressence known. A shock of bittness balances out the intense flavors, then the alcohol dries the tongue. The aftertaste is very similar to that of a high quality cup of coffee.  M - Everything a good RIS should be. Thick, chewy, full bodied, with moderate carbonation.

More chocolate on the tongue and with a long lingering roasted malt finish, including a nice freshly grated chocolate texture.

The flavor is big and roasty with coffee bitterness; quite dry in the finish, and the hops blend in and don't overwhelm the balance. Full palate with fizzy carbonation. Very drinkable for an imperial, but intense and rich, dry and bitter. Goes nicely with chocolate desserts. (3.8) Rerate: This is damn good on tap.

The smell reminds me of wood, coffee (although that might be the suggestion of the look) and chocolate. The taste is great. Smoothly balanced malt, hops and sweetness. This is not my favorite type of beer, but this is my favorite of this type that I have had. Mouthfeel is as smooth as Belgian chocolate. I am amazed that the ABV is as high as it is, yet it has such a smooth character and good drinkability for this type.

M- Just above moderate fullness and viscosity. The carbonation is medium low.  D- Took me a bit to come around on this one but now that I have I must admit it is quite the tasty RIS.

112,412,taylorhamrick,3.89,"Pours very dark, but still I can see some ruby hints around the edges, may be lighter/different in color than the average RIS. The head is kind of thin (&lt;1cm) and dense, which leaves bits of lacing down as I drink. The smell is filled with sweetness, but deep in there are dried fruits (maybe from some esters or the black patent), the roasted barley - coffee type smell, and a light nose of chocolate. I can imagine a better smell, in terms of complexity, this one is about normal, but because its so intense, the smell is very much more inviting. The taste is very complex, and includes all of the usual suspects. The first sip has this dark, overripe plum taste, almost a hint of slick dark tartness, but with a pleasant sweetness. Then comes the coffee flavor, just flavor - no bitterness, and the sweetness still lingers, up until the last bite of chocolate. A roastiness fills as it goes down, again with the dried fruits, but overall pleasant. The mouthfeel is nice, pretty full, but kind of slick, this one fits the bill in terms out mouthfeel, but isn't a standout. An easy drinker for sure, I mean, you have to sip, but easy, good for the style.

Beer was not super chilled, but still fairly cold.  First impression, WOW!! Super dark color. Nice dark head of about 2.5"".  The head dissippated as I wrote the start of the review. Smells wonderful, like a strong oatmeal/imperial.  Lacing appears to be very prevalent.  first sip...had to take 2. Very complex. Nice sweetness to go with the hops. subtle chocolate and carmel. Nice big finish with a touch of spiciness. Big round oatmeal taste.  I wish I had bought the pack now instead of just a single.  Mouthfeel is thick, but not too heavy. Although it's a super complex flavor, it's still easy to drink. The finish sits very long.

112,412,rayjay,4.4,"2006 vintage. My last one! I've always loved how this beer ages over the course of a year or two and this three year version is the oldest I've had.  One great looking very dark brown beer that lets in a little bit of light around the edges and produces a moderate brown head that throws a decent web down the glass.  Lots of baker's chocolate on the nose. Subtle yet rich and decadent.  Flavor also packs a subtle whollop. Big rushing waves of ever-evolving flavors. Rich chocolate malts are at the forefront from beginning to end. Grainy, fresh malt, with notes of highly kilned carmel malt. A distinctive nuttiness and a light coffee/chocolate powder note. Mild hop bitterness after all this time, still there to provide a wonderful bitterness to counter the equally mild sweetness.  Great mouthfeel from obviously very good quality stout water; probably a healthy dose of bicarbonate. The mouthfeel is lightly carbed, and reminds me of the delicious mineral content in a good scotch. Very refreshing for a big heavy beer. Medium viscosity.  Obviously we are not dealing with a thick, massive, syrupy extreme beer, instead a big, bold stout that shows it's refinement through subtle and balanced flavors. Three years makes it taste like a sweet delicious chocolate bar.  I highly recommend this widely distributed beer that i overlooked for about 7-8 years straight. It's one of the best beers in it's style. Although it's easily outdone by other bolder beers, it's hard to match it's sophistication. I also love North Coast's other stouts, especially the organic Old Plowshare.  Cheers!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

It was not until recently when I moved to a neighborhood that lacks good beer selection in every store that I realized how much I truly love this beer. By chance a liquor store near me that has a paltry craft beer selection happens to carry this. The appearance is ""none more black"" even held up to the light BLACK! There is a medium tan head which quickly goes away. It smells mostly of coffee and dark chocolate, maybe a little burnt caramel and oak. The taste is everything in the smell, add a little dried fruit and hop bite. Mouth feel is silky and a little sticky with enough hops to balance it out to not be ""sticky sweet"" I could pretty much drink this beer until the high alcohol knocked me out, it is not difficult to drink at all.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,ReadyFireAim,4.68,"Very nice! This is one of the reasons I fell in love with the RIS style!  A - Very dark, nearly black. The head retention on this beer is ridiculous. Kept its head for nearly a full two minutes, then settled nicely to a thin padding of creamy brown goodness. Also note that the head is made up of very tight, small bubbles. This usually signifies a long natural fermentation and conditioning (without the use of adjuncts to spur conditioning)  S - Great, great aromas. Licorice, dark Belgian candi, fruits and esters peeking through (a little bit of banana and lemon rind, maybe); slight hop astringency backed up with the roasty coffee smells you would hope to have in your stouts. Very nice.  T - What can I say? You've just got to bend the knee to this one. Let it wash over you and deliver everything that the aroma promises. Truly fantastic and complex.  M - Pretty nice mouthfeel. A little sticky (which is alright); slight astringency from the alcohol and hop characters.  D - I would give this a 5, but it's a bit too alcoholic to warrant more than two (unless of course you're home - then drink 'til your heart's content). Though for the style, you can't expect much less than 8-9% ABV, so I'm not saying it's wrong. Definitely a sip-and-savor beer. And a damn good one, at that.

Some chocolate. Very slight hop spiciness amongst a very strong dark malt backbone. Very appealing and exemplary of the style.  T/M - Flavors don't quite come through as they do in the smell. Rich and smooth but not heavy. Chocolate comes through in the aftertaste, as does the fruit. The hops come through stronger in the flavor than the smell. Pleasant.  D - High alcohol, but easy to drink.

Drinkability- Abit bitter during cold weather I could probably have a few. But in other weather one a day is about the most I could have.  Notes: This was my first russian imperial stout. And it was not at all what I expected. I had heard they were sweet. But I certainly didn't pick that up.,North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,dfolmste,4.84,"Looking forward to try out my new Sam Adams snifter.  Appearance: Pours a jet black with creamy coffee head. The head looks like it is going to rise up, but instead disappears instantly. For a beer with 9% ABV this is to be expected.  Smell: Alcohol mixed with dark fruit. Smells like a liquor. Chocolate, ice cream, raisin and cherry. Smells like liquid dessert. Extremely complex and delicious.  Taste: Amazing! The delicious smell cannot even compete with the taste. Everything I named in the smell plus a cast of others. Impossible to put in words. Get this and try it if available.  Mouthfeel: Remarkably smooth with the taste covering all parts of the tongue. First hits sweet, then bitter roasted coffee and chocolate. Not a bit of astringency or off flavors. Probably over 7 different flavors in one sip. I want to try and describe all the flavors, but I want to drink more.  Drinkability: A beer to be savored and analyzed. Would be the perfect dessert after a fancy meal or a warming beverage after long day of skiing. The winter would be the ideal time to consume. Due to the alcohol and body of this beer, it is best enjoyed in moderation.  I loved this beer. Plus the glass looks great.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,roblowther,3.82,"The latest in my foray into Russian Imerpial Stouts, trying to discover why they so dominate the ""best beers in the world"" lists. It pours pitch black with a medium tan head that is dense and creamy and leaves one of the densest lacings I've seen. Smell is musty wood, leather, raisins, and oranges. The taste is surprisingly sweet, and not at all acrid or burnt as so many others I have tried. It tastes of coffee, soft malt, leather, and a pleasant chalkiness. The mouthfeel is a good balance of carbonation and chewiness. The drinkability is limited by the bitter finish. This fades nicely through the aftertaste, but it is a bit intense for a while. Probably the best of the style I've tried, but I suppose I'm just not a true believer.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,ROBORB,4.33,"12 oz bottle poured into a Sam Adam's Perfect Pint glass. This RIS poured a dark black with a 1 1/2 finger mocha head that lasted forever. It smelled of roasted malts, chocolate and a faint smell of coffee. The taste is dominated by bitter chocolate up front. That quickly changes to a creamy roasted malt/coffee finish. This beers seems to stay on your tongue for a while. This is an awesome RIS and a bargain at its price. Everyone should search this beer out if it is available in their area.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,wiseguy142,3.71,"Pours jet black, oily with a rocky/creamy mocha head. Lacing actually looks like lace.. weird connection. Lookin pretty good so far.  Aroma is fruity and sweet.. slight touch of alcohol. Lacking in roasted grain aroma. A little vanilla and cream. Could be stronger, or the beer could be a little cold.  Taste has a pleasant chocolate flavor with a very slight alcohol bite. Dry in the finish, like a good porter. Malt and alcohol sort of stick to your tongue. Freshly roasted coffee towards the end. As it warms up a little more balanced milky sweetness and bitterness from the roasted malt comes through which is nice. All is a little subdued though, was looking for something a little more flashy.  Pretty light mouthfeel. Rush of carbonation towards the end of the sip. Disappointing, should be thicker.  This beer's got some good flavors but some of them need to be more pronounced. I would even scale this back a bit and up the body and it'd be a great porter.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

A: pours dark black with some nice mocha colored head that settles a little bit  S: smells like milk chocolate, slight coffee and roasted malts  T: a little more of the roastiness comes though in the flavor, but not overbearing...other flavors are the same as the smell  M: a little on the thin side of creamy, highly carbed  D: solid flavor, hard to taste the alcohol content, and the short side of creaminess helps the easy to drink factor",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,IMincedTheKing,3.76,"Pours an opaque chocolate brown with a head like tightly packed brown sugar. Some bubbles can be seen crawling up the glass.  The smell is roasty and yeasty with some coffee and chocolate.  It tastes somewhat malty, but the rest of the flavors are overpowered by drying citric hops and a dominant aftertaste of chocolate. It feels thick and full in the mouth, almost like a milkshake.  A big bold beer, but I think it's a little too over-the-top (in flavor, mouthfeel, and ABV), to be extremely drinkable.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,CityBoy1986,4.08,"Poured into a pint glass from a 12 oz. (355 ml) bottle.  The pour is a very dark brown with the faintest hint of ruddy hues near the bottom of the glass. An inch of head slowly recedes into a more manageable size, but it never really goes away. Lacing is on the good side.  The nose is mostly coffee and chocolate with some burnt notes. There is a tiny hint of alcohol. The taste is more of the same; again the alcohol is well-hidden. A mild bitterness is present throughout the sip.  Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy without too much carbonation. Drinkability is good considering the ABV (and ABW, for that matter). If I didn't know the alcoholic content (and had more than one bottle), I could drink at least a few of these.  This is a nice example of the style that seems to fit even on a warm April night.

112,412,hokies1999,4.76,"This beer had an amazing jet-black appearance with a reddish head that just never quit! I couldn't believe the head was not brown/black to match the beer but had a definite red hue. The beer had a wonderful coffee like aroma but that drew me in but didn't knock me off my feet when compared to its other attributes.  The taste just blew me away. An amazing toasted malty sweetness on the nose with espresso, dark chocolate and maybe, just maybe a touch or raisin or caramelized sugar in the middle with a slight alcohol taste in the finish to let you know this beer packed a punch. The mouth feel was exceptional, best beer I've ever had (with Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout a close 2nd) in this category. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy. I didn't think a beer could be this creamy without the addition of oatmeal, but North Coast did it somehow.  Drinkability...I can drink this beer each and every winter night! Obviously b/c of the dark malt and heavy/creamy mouthfeel, this is not a summer (think 90F and 70% RH) beer. But on those cold Northern NY nights, this work of art will chase those winter blues away!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,ClockworkOrange,4.23,"Picked up a single at the Beer Stop in West Hazleton. Poured from a stubby 12 ounce bottle into my shaker glass. Appears a nearly opaque black color with an inch of tight ecru head. Minimal lacing sticks to the inside of my glass as I make my way to the bottom. Smells and tastes of rich, dark roasted grains, caramelized malts, milk chocolate, bitter coca powder, fresh coffee beans, grassy hops, and molasses. Rich and full bodied with medium carbonation. Slight alcohol burn from start to finish. A really great RIS. It's year round availability is a plus as well.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Nick3,4,"Beer is a syrupy, liquid black with a small chocolate brown head that disappears quickly. Smell is coffee, molasses, chocolate, and roasted malts. Taste is smooth, rich malts up front with a slightly bitter finish that's accompanied by hints of dark chocolate. Alcohol warms and lingers in the finish as well. Carbonation dances across the toungue and leaves you wanting more. Beer is sticky and chewy in the mouth.

Tiny notes of bitter chocolate, west coast style coffee, creamy chocolate.  Taste is creamy coffee, bitter chocolate, a decent amount of smoke somehow.  Mouthfeel is oh so smooth on this one.

112,412,Ricelikesbeer,3.97,"Pours with a huge, billowing head. Jet black and hard to see through. The head is cloudy with huge bubbles. It smells very chocolate like, with a little roasted flavor and earth. When you sip it sweetness immediatly fills your mouth, and coats your tongue. Almost too sweet for my taste in Imperial stouts, but nonetheless delicious and drinkable. Mouthfeel is very smooth and goes down easy. Not too thick. It is very inviting and you could drink plenty of it if it weren't for the high abv.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Very fine and spritzy carbonation lightens the mouthfeel up front. Fairly full body with a smooth & creamy texture. Luscious, roast and bitter character with plenty of coffee and bittersweet chocolate, and subtle notes of baked prune, molasses, and faint licorice, all with a dry edge. Big, lengthy finish. Very flavourful. Leaves a lingering bitterness, with a roasty and tangy character. Superb!  Surprisingly drinkable for its alcoholic strength, with some burn on the finish. Small bits of foam cling to the glass. Outstanding example of the style.

Nose was oak, oak, oak. Just the way I like it. Roasted malt aromas too.  Tasted dry for a RIS with a bit of woodiness and moderate roasted malt with touch of coffee and a wee bit of dark chocolate. Predominately oak/malt though.  The regular RIS is average by itself but the oak definitely kicked it up an interesting level.

A bit of bitterness and a dry finish to round it out. There is some alcohol flavor to it, but it's not overwhelming.  M- Very smooth with little carbonation. Heavy body.

112,412,sd42790,4.31,"For starters, I got a Russian friend to translate the phrase on the label; it had been bothering me. It states ""A true, hearty friend won't be born suddenly"".  A- Pitch black, with a coffee brown head. Great cascading bubbles.  S- Pure roasted chocolatey malts on the nose, with an alcohol singe that betrays the 9% ABV.  T- Upfront roasted malts bring the bitter coffee and dark chocolate, with a nice balance of hop bitterness to subdue the raging malts. On the tail end I detected sweetness, reminiscent of raisin, blackcurrant, and port wine. Sublime balance.  M- Thick but not oily on the palette, subdued by a considerable effervescence.  D- I'd have no problem pounding two or three, but beyond that I could see it getting pretty saturating on the palette. However, extreme drinkability is not an aim of this genre of beer, so that sits well with me.  Of the three RIS's that I have had (Old Rasp, Boulevard, Dark Lord), I find this one a nice equilibrium, the Boulevard a bit too thin, the Dark Lord, while delicious, was extremely thick, perhaps impeding on drinkability.

I like this one because it was the strongest served in pint size. I like the different type of glassware, i.e. a chalice, but they use it to give you less beer. Anyways, great looking stout, as I think stout are usually very good looking beers. Somewhat fruity taste. I tasted this next to a Rogue Nut Brown and the Rogue was more like a coffee/nutty, where is this was more fruit forward.  I could have a few of these a night.

One of the best tasting RIS's around. Burnt malt and espresso up front, followed by a sweet and slightly bitter dark chocolate and toffee flavors.  This one is super smoothe and thick. Really good mouthfeel that leaves a bitter aftertaste.  As rich as this it, it is very drinkable and I can easily throw back a few in a sitting. The only downside it that it's very filling.

112,412,Magpie14,4.85,"A: a huge erupting head resulted as my pour was somewhat reckless. This volcanic cap was brown sugar in color, foamed, chunky, and lasting. Lacing was intricate and consisted of the usual strands, blobs, globs, and the like. The body poured dark walnut, burnt sienna, and black. A great look in the class  S: luscious fudge-like chocolate dominates with heavily roasted malts a close second. Even some green cones can be smelled as well as ground coffee beans. This is spot on!  T: mildly bitter chocolate drizzled coffee beans and fudge brownies mixed with blackened (borderline burnt) roasted malts. Tremendous conglomeration of flavors! However, amidst the black look, rich chocolate, and malty flavors a few hops have a well placed wallop on the tongue. Hops are grassy greens with a squeeze or two of citrus. I find the balance to be very nice. This stout maintains a rich complex profile with a ample supply of hops. It never gets overly tangy or real bitter, it stays nice and sweet  M: this is my ideal stout consistency...heavy! Chewy, viscous, and velvet on the tongue. Carbonation is right where it should be and never in the way of the delicate creamed goodness  D: by and far one of the best stouts in the business, I will never tire of this beer!

Each sip is an adventure that starts with big roasted malts and expresso and leaves hints of dark chocolate & molasses on the palate. Finish is that of moderate hoppiness that completes this beer wonderfully.  M: Not too thick, not too thin but very creamy. Coats the mouth and the mild carbonation makes it very silky and smooth. This is one of the best beer experiences I have had.  D: For a RIS this is the most drinkable I have had. The relatively strong 9% abv is hidden very well.

This may be gross but the smell reminded me of straight Skoal chew spit. Kind of unappetizing and I wish I hadn't have made that connection. However the flavor totally redeemed the beer and made up for the aroma. Chocolate cream and dark roast burnt coffee beans with just the right amount of slight hop bitterness at the finish.

112,412,johnmichael712,4.88,"Appearance: Poured out of a 12. oz bottle into a nonic glass. This beer pours an opaque mahogany color with ruby tints around the edges and it allows light through when backlit with a lamp. The dark khaki colored head starts is absolutely gargantuan in size and rises from the depths of the glass the way a nitro-bottle or nitro-can pour does. The head has a wonderfully soft, pillowy texture and takes a long time to dissipate. As I'm drinking this beer a moderate amount of lace is left clinging onto the glass for dear life.  Smell: My first sniff of the nose reminds me a lot of Victory's Storm King Russian Imperial Stout because the hops dominate the nose in a similar way, but in subsequent sniffs the aroma of bittersweet chocolate is dominant. There is also a strong roasted malt presence in the nose, and hints of coffee, molasses, and brown sugar.  Taste: This beer starts off with a wonderful chocolate and malt flavor with a hint of espresso (the usual chocolate/espresso flirtation that Imperial Stouts have) and finishes with a very light citrusy hop flavor and a good amount of alcohol warmth. I disagree entirely with those that say this beer is too hoppy, as I found the hops to be very toned down and much more subtle than Storm King. Dominated instead by intense chocolate and roasted malt flavors, this is one exceptionally delicious beer. I wish I had a better grasp of the English language to more fully describe this beer, but it doesn't really matter because only sampling this beer yourself will truly do it justice.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is where this beer truly shines, and to rate it at anything lower than a five would be criminal. My first sip took my breath away with how creamy, luxurious, silky, multiple other adjectives, this beer feels on my tongue. This silkiness is supplemented by an insanely thick and chewy body and a very light amount of carbonation that makes this beer feel more like drinking a melted chocolate bar than drinking a beer. This is definitely the best ""feeling"" beer I've ever drank, and if I could give it a six I would.  Drinkability: One of the most drinkable stouts out there. There isn't even a slight mention of the 9% alcohol, and the smooth, lavish mouthfeel mixed with the decadent chocolaty taste make it possible to quaff this brew all night long. At the moment I'm having a tough time imagining a more perfect night than sitting in front of a fire with a good book drinking a couple of these baddies.  Notes: At the time of my review this beer is sitting at number eighty-nine on the best of BA list just above Storm King, thus I was expecting something qualitatively similar to Storm King. Boy was I wrong. This beer is superior in every way, and is one of the best Russian Imperial Stouts out there. It definitely deserves to be higher on the best of BA list, and right now only Stone's Imperial Russian Stout seems to be the equal of this beer in the RIS category. If you ever see this beer in the store do yourself a favor a pick up more than one. You won't be disappointed.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

S: Strong roasted malts with high amounts of alcohol with noticeable hops and coffee.  T: Big flavor. Roasted malts hit upfront turning into espresso with a bitter chocolate finish with a bit of a hop bitterness tagging along. Not as much alcohol comes out in the flavor as does the nose.

112,412,biegaman,4.77,"Pitch black with hazelnut lining; my glass has become the sight of one big oil spill. The complexion is utterly unyielding - even when held directly into the light the beer refuses any highlights or transparency. This defines the word 'opaque'. The rustic toned carbonation seems selective about which parts of the top it chooses to amplify. Nevertheless, it's fairly thorough and leaves a coating of lacing that sticks like drying cement.  The nose is everything you'd ask for in an Imperial Stout (chocolate, espresso, heavy roast, molasses, black licorice) plus an extremely generous inclusion of hops. We're talking West Coast style hops - lively, spicy, tangy, fruity, acidic, green, fresh from the vine hops. Although they do interfere a little with all the dark chocolate and roast malt decadence, they also provide a level of sumptuousness of their own. This smell is divine.  Each sip is like drinking liquefied dark chocolate. Well, it's not that simple actually. It's like drinking liquefied dark chocolate that has been infused with a strong, heavy roast espresso and a farm's worth of macerated hop cones. There's a big spoonful of dark caramel, a layer of crunchy toffee crust and nibs of black licorice. Bittersweet notes resonate with increasing intensity on the finish. Surely if there is an ideal tasting Imperial Stout this must be it.  Words like ""smooth"" and ""delicious"" have been so overused in reviews that they've lost much of their meaning. That said, a beer like Old Rasputin comes along and there's no better, more appropriate adjectives to describe it. It not only rejuvenates these words, it might even redefine them. The flavours are luscious, the body is full, the textures vivid and the alcohol never to be seen. This whole thing just feels like a warm (decadently rich) blanket.  They may not all be easy to get your hands on, but there is no shortage of great Imperial Stouts. The bar for this style is set ridiculously high, arguably much higher than most other styles. Although Old Rasputin may no longer be recognized as one of the top, most decadent RIS it damn well should be.

Coffee and malts also ever present. Nice balanced aroma.  T = Wonderful sweet fruit and chocolate notes to start. Warm coffee and hints of chocolate bloom in the middle, with a mild hop bitter to finish.  M = This is where I feel like this one lacks slightly. A little more thin on the palate than I would expect. I guess I was hoping for it to be a little creamier and chewy.  D = Excellent drinkability. ABV is well hidden. Could go for another right now.

A tiny bit of lace remains after the head recedes calmly.  Smell: Heavy malt aroma and plenty of dark fruits. Cherry, plum, apricot and raisin. There is also a sweet chocolate aroma, almost like chocolate milk.  Taste: Subtle flavors of milk chocolate, roasted malt, licorice and coffee. Slight hop addition gives some IBUs. Nice balance, but not overly complex.  Mouthfeel: Medium to heavily bodied, ample carbonation, and a lot of RIS qualities. Belly warming alcohol, ample sweetness.  Drinkability: A decent brew.

Right after the pour, I smell plenty of hops, but soon the smell is mostly musty and earthy. On first sip, Old Rasputin is a massive, chewy beer. Early on, I taste loads of bitter chocolate, but the finish is mostly grassy hops and a little alcohol. As this warms, however, I begin to taste coffee and some plum and apple flavors. For the style, I think drinkability is above average, because the flavor, hoppiness, and booziness are not over the top like in others I've tried.

112,412,Deadstar,4.32,"This is one of my favorite Russian Imperials for a few different reasons; it's one of the more affordable offerings in the style, it's very tasty, and while not the most over the top or out of the ordinary, it's dang solid.  I poured this out of the bottle into a snifter. The color is almost black, minus some deep amber around the outside of the glass. The head faded away quickly, leaving only a remnant of itself to float around on top of the beer.  Smell: Dark fruits, roasted malt.  Taste: Much like the smell would indicate, there's a lot of dark/dried fruit flavor here, followed up with a solid roasted malt backbone; hop bitterness was right where it needed to be.  Mouthfeel: Relatively light but slick, leaves the mouth coated between drinks. Carbonation was spot on for the style.  Drinkability: I could drink a few of these in a sitting, but I feel that the strong flavors and the higher ABV would limit me to one or two.  Solid beer, very affordable. Great stuff.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,PerzentRizen,4.47,"Wow so this is what everyone was talking about! Old Rasputin has to be one of the easies drinking RIS I've ever had the opportunity to try. I poured this one into a Duvel glass (7 more in the cellar - yes!) at around 48 degrees - just chilled slightly.  The aroma is wild. I can detect dried fruit - raisens, figs, cherries and tongs of malt. There is almost no hop aroma.  The first taste is packed with flavor. Each sip is like a small explosion of tasty stout goodness. This has to be one of the best beers for the money. The aromas are echoed in the flavor with lots of dried fruit, massive malt, and now I am getting hop bitterness.  The mouthfeel is a little too light for me. I like my RIS's to be a little thicker. This is really thin compared to other great RIS beers like Ten Fidy and Stone's version. I still think Old Raz is good.  The drinkability is off the chart. I don't know how to explain that you could actually have 2 or maybe even 3 of these beers and still ""live"" through the experience - try doing that with Ten Fidy or Stone. In short you should grab a 4 pack and start enjoying today!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Brenden,4.5,"The color is black, and the head pours a full thick head that retains very nicely and leaves some pretty incredible sticky lacing all over the glass.  The smell is malts and a hot of alcohol with something like licorice and a hint of bitter dark chocolate.  The alcohol is strong in this one. The toasted malt is also prevalent; this is probably the ""maltiest"" beer I've ever had. If you really give it some time on your palate the malt, hops bitterness, and light sweetness with really make themselves evident so that the complexity can truly be appreciated. Very nicely balanced.  The mouthfeel is thick and smooth with a pleasant alcoholic sting to it. A great combination of thickness, alcohol, bitterness and toastiness.  This one is a definite must.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Bartian,4.32,"Upon opening the Old Rasputin, I was immediately struck by the wonderfully dark, full pour - like a stream of black gold flowing into the glass.  At first, second and third glance, the beer is black as midnight with tight seems of carbonation flowing throughout. The head set at about an inch with a color of dark tan and very strong lacing.  The smell was prototypical Russian Stout but with a bit extra in the dark chocolate and licorice arena - a real treat . . . so much so that I actually had to remember to drink it.  The first drink was pleasent with no indication of the greatness that I've heard for years. But as the glass emptied the score improved. Whether it is the abundance of alcohol or the overriding complexity of the drink, it improves like the finest of coffees and cigars.  The mouthfeel is striking, the syrup that is called a beer surrounds the tongue like an impenetrable forecfield; drifting away only after several seconds of bliss.  As for drinkability, the balance is surprising given the complexity of the beer. Without any overly biting flavors like molasses, anice, chocolate or otherwise, the drink flows as smooth as silk. But the high alcohol content means drinker beware . . too much of a good thing can make Rassy a dull boy!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,Mistofminn,4.66,"12 oz brown bottle. Old Rasputin looks evil as he stares into your soul (at least that's what it feels like). I almost feel as though I'm not judging the beer, but Old Rasputin is judging me....  Bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours black as night, producing a thick and creamy brown head. 1 finger head dissipates quicker than I expected. Absolutely no idea if there is any kind of carbonation going on, I can't see a damn thing! Leaves decent lacing.  The aroma is heavy on bitter chocolate, but there is also a sweetness. A light coffee smell goes along with a roasted barley character. Little in the way of bitterness, save the bakers chocolate.  Old Rasputin hits my lips...fireworks! Holy mackerel! This symphony hits my taste buds and explodes into something so complex it's almost beyond words. At first I thought the chocolate was the dominant flavor, then the next sip I was convinced it was the coffee. Now, I'm certain it's the roasted character, but then again, maybe it's the warming alcohol. One thing is sure, the aroma, while very impressive in itself, doesn't do this flavor profile justice, in my opinion.  Very very creamy and smooth. Definitely a sipper, but something you want to keep sipping on. The alcohol does show itself, and has a friendly warming presence. What a great beer, I can't believe I passed it up on the shelves all those times. That definitely won't be happening again!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Pours a 1/2 inch tan head that eventually disappears.  S: Lots of dark chocolate, roasted coffee with some alcohol scents. Very robust smell.  T: Nothing short of fantastic. Big flavors of chocolate, mixed with espresso on the front end, but not too sweet. Some slight hop bitterness on the back end balances out this beer.  M: Thick and creamy. Extremely smooth sensation left on the palate.  D: An excellent beer. One of the best imperial stouts that I have had.

Head is thin and almost nonexistent.  S: Extremely aromatic. Dark chocolate and roasted coffee/ malts. Some faint spices and anise seeds, with hints of pear and cloves.  T: Highly complex: roasted coffee and malts lay out a base for bitter chocolate and dark fruits. Do I detect a hint of grand marnier? Alcohol is definitely present and warming.

112,412,BARFLYB,4.35,"12oz bottle poured into a regular pint glass. 1st from a 4-pack  A- Old rasputin is a dark brew, black as night. Some spots of brown can be seen on the surface A very hard pour yielded a nice 1 inch tan head that faded with ease. Around the glass thin patterns of lace are seen.  S- This RIS has a roasty aroma along with a milk chocolate creaminess. Bittersweet. A bit of licorice and even less on the dark fruit which I don't get much of. Some old coffee as well. Roasted malts all throughout and hops to round it out.  T- Starting off I get a bunch of roasted coffee with malt backing with some hops too add. As I got into it the chocolate came out more with warming as well as a bit of bitterness. Some of the alcohol comes out as well in this 9%er, but rasputin is delicious non the less.  M- Medium to slightly full bodied. This one is smooth as hell & creamy. A bit of carbonation as some warming takes place 6oz in. Nothing overpowering though except a slight bitterness. Great stuff.  D- 9% is nothing to scoff at but this is so good I would gladly drink it till I couldn't no more, in the spirit of Rasputin's story. This one is more on the creamy side and not too harsh making it almost chuggable, although I don't advise that.

A hop sharpness only barely makes it through the malt. Deep malt sweetness takes a while to give into hops bitterness. Malts fight back in the finish, blending with a slight alcohol astringency.

112,412,superdedooperboy,4.18,"Savored this one on-tap at The Pizza Joint in Evans, GA. (Incidentally, the only way and place I've ever enjoyed it.)  Dark black, mostly opaque, with a thick espresso-like brown head that shows wonderful retentive properties and holds tight to the walls of the vessel, leaving behind nice rings of lace.  The nose is powerfully delicious, filled with sweet and bitter chocolate notes along with a bit of coffee.  Thick and velvety smooth in body, with flavors mimicking those of the nose: creamy chocolate, both sweet milky chocolate notes as well as the dominating bittersweet dark chocolate, with a bit of espresso snap that lends a bit of dryness to the finish, which is mildly sweet as well. Roasted character, in both the nose and on the palate, is rather subdued, though it peeks through at times.  Going down smooth and satisfying, this is an imminently drinkable Imperial Stout, but drinkability can only be issued so much in a beer with 9% alcohol by volume.  A wonderful example of the style, and the one that introduced me to Russian Imperial Stout to begin with, not to mention its being the first ""big beer"" I ever tried, and it was love at first sip. I always come back to this one, and it never disappoints.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Smell: Dark, earthy, coffee, chocolate; very smooth. Not much by way of alcohol which is surprising weighing in at a hefty 9%  Taste: Glorious. Full flavored. This is as fine as the best espresso on earth and blended like a well aged cigar. I always forget how much I love this beer and am very happy to have that surprise.  Mouthfeel: A little carbonation; I would say it is a heavy bodied beer but not too over powering.  Drinkability: Surprisingly high; for me the only way I would be able to consume more would be to have a nitrogen version of this or a still beer version.

M: coats the mouth nicely, but not especially creamy or full. No carbonation to speak of once the head dissipates.  D: nice beer overall but the ABV would keep me from having more than 1.

S - Cinnamon and roasted smokey malts. I was expecting a little more considering the style.  T - To me, taste is most important, and OR delivered. Chocolate, roasty malts, espresso, even the faint sweetness of marshmallows. It was full of strong flavors that we were not compromised in their individuality.  M - Pretty good for a stout. Rolled through the mouth pretty well. Not too sticky or thick.  D - I don't think I could handle 3-4 OR in a session. Too much going on with too much alcohol to contend with.

A sweet chocolate malt flavor up front that holds. A hint of bread right before the alcohol comes through and leaves a bittersweet flavor in the aftertaste.  Medium body brew.

There is also a toasted wood taste, even a few malts to balance.  M - Good full feel. Can't really see carbonation, but you can feel it. Very full feel.  D - Low, but typical for the style to me.

The smell is of dark roasted malts, coffee and a slight hint of chocolate. The taste is very rich and dark with a mild alcohol warmth at the back of the throat. Moderate carbonation and a full-bodied feel that finishes with a slightly charred finish. All in all, a wonderful quaff to be enjoyed regularly.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Hoagie1973,4.48,"Thanks to kbnooshay for the bottle.  Black as night with a massive caramel-colored head. Nice and lumpy with good sticky lace. Great retention; stays until the end.  Chocolate malt aroma with some espresso and slightly sharp hops. Smells awesome! Alcohol is well masked and doesn't come through much in the nose at first, but shows itself a bit as it warms.  Well roasted coffee and molasses. Has a heavy sweetness while nicely balanced by a strong hop presence. A little char/smokiness. Residual sweetness in the finish; this is also where the alcohol shows up and provides a nice warming sensation as well as lending a hand with a little balancing bitterness.  Mouthfeel is thick, chewy, and full. Soft carbonation is just right.  Great RIS in the same vein as Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout. A BIG beer; not for the beginner.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

The smell is strong of roasted coffee malts & dark fruits. The taste is very complex--coffee, dark chocolate, some bitter roasted malts, then followed by raisins & dried fruits.  Mouthfeel is smooth & thick at first, but then there is some acidity at the end brought out by the alcohol warmth.  This is a drinkable RIS.

112,412,dotsonjamesg,4.48,"I was attracted to this brew for the simple fact that it was titled ""Old Rasputin."" At that time, I did not know anything really about Russian Imperial Stout. Having fell in love with the brew immediately, I became a regular drinker of the stuff and also moved on the other brands of RIS. This opened the gateway to my favorite style of beer, Russian Imperial Stout.  A: Poured black, very black, yet filtered, with a deep brown two finger head. Nice carbonation. Moderate lacing is present.  S: Smell is rich of coffee, currants, bitter-burnt malts, dark chocolate, raisins with hints of alcohol.  T: Rich and very sweet with currants and chocolate. The flavor is also moderate on the alcohol but is matched with the moderate sweetness of the brew.  M: Thick and syrupy but very drinkable and simply delicious.  D: I prefer my Russian Stouts to the brink of freezing but the flavors are unlocked as the brew approaches 45-55 degrees and it becomes more drinkable.  Its great but not of the same quality of some of the more expensive Russian Stouts. Still great and is one of the best things I can get in Jacksonville, Arkansas(since no one here seems to enjoy anything but natty ice and bud light).  Just as a side note, I don't recommend aging the stuff. I doesn't hold very well over several months. I think you have to seek out richer brews, this one is a bit too ""light"" for good aging.

Maybe the faintest hint of raisins or other dark dried berries.  Taste: Lots of chocolate malts. Coffee, some dark berries maybe. Some nice hoppy balance.  Mouth: Pretty smooth.

It has everything you could want in a RIS: pitch black color and a creamy mocha colored head that leaves great lacing.  Smell: Really nice amount of black coffee/espresso and secondary smells of chocolate malt. The one thing that stops this from receiving a 5 for smell is the fact that there is a pretty apparent alcohol smell to it.  Taste: Espresso and hops with a little bit of licorice/anise flavor.  Mouthfeel: Creamy with a nice amount of carbonation.  Drinkability: Good.

Smell: The predominant aroma is a roasted chocolate/coffee malt. Malt presence is impressive and quite in style for this style. Excellent.  Taste: Immediately the roast coffee comes to the front. During systain a hop essence emerges. Excellent.  Mouthfeel: The totality of the taste and palate pleasing character of this selection make this a wonderful choice or experienced drinkers. Novices may find that the palate is a little crouded, however for this style, I find this selection to be very crisp. Great job making this a very tasty brew.  Drinkability: As with most heavy alcohol and malt drinks, this sits a little heavy on the stomache, but alot of this is due to the style character rather than this particular selection.

Mouthfeel: Very thick, what you would expect from an RIS.  Drinkability: Not as high as I would usually rank a RIS, mostly because there was a reasonably noticeable alcohol presence.

Frothy crema cap lets rich roasted black malt, baker's cocoa, espresso, some anise or licorice detected. When tasting, chocolate is prominent and the spicy hops fit well with in the beer - distinct enough for balance. A chewy mouthfeel keeps slick and leaves well attuned - a classic Russian Imperial Stout.  Please take my advice on this one - pour this after a full dinner and pair it with an Onyx Reserve Robusto. This full bodied maduro created with Dominican, Nicaraguan blend tobacco and Blackened Connecticut wrapper creates dark aromas and a roasted character that pairs impeccably well with the brew.

112,412,TehAnkh,4.3,"A: This stuff pours black as night with little to no light shining through. Where it does, you can see this uber dark brown elixer for what it truly is. Gives up about a finger of head that recedes quickly to leave a nice thin layer of light brown froth like one would expect on hot chocolate, but darker. Leaves little lacing, but what's there is appreciated.  S: Coffee, roasted nuts, some caramel, and the overwhelming STINK (I used to be a baker, so I use this term affectionately) of yeasty rising bread. This stuff smells fantastic, it definitely gives the impression of being exactly what stouts are sometimes thought to be, liquid bread. Roasty, toasty, sweet and yeasty are all words that apply here.  T: A bit less hop presence and bitterness than I typically associate with a Russian Imperial Stout, but this lends to the drinkability by a truckload. Coffee, caramel and roasted walnuts are the major flavors I'm getting here. A little bit of a cocoa flavor is detectable, while at the same time that yeastyness seems to carry over in to the taste as well, suggesting a crusty bread-to-be rising in a warm proof box. Fan-freaking-tastic.  M: Somewhat creamy, very very smooth, and a perfectly comfortable level of hoppy bitterness that doesn't hang out on the tongue for too long. Lovely.  D: I could kill a 4 pack of this by myself in a few hours. The 9% is hidden so well you're liable to be dancing on the coffee table with a lampshade on your head at 3 AM before you even realize that you've had enough.

112,412,hreb,3.8,"Cold 12oz bottle poured into pint glass. Beer pours a dark cola-brown color, agitating just enough to produce a medium-sized brown head with a hint of red.  Aroma is not as strong as it could be: coppery, nutty, with a hint of caramel. The hops are immediately more apparent in the first sip than they are in the nose. The flavor balances out and carries the alcohol well: hazelnut and citrus. The flavors are big but not numerous. It's complex, but not interesting. I have to say this beer is overrated. This beer executes well, but it's not easy to make a highly bitter imperial stout -- it requires a lot of the beer.  Revisting my review from February 3, 2009 (above) four and a half months later: I kept around a bottle from the same batch and let it age in the fridge. This time I'm trying it in a wide-mouth Chimay glass. One thing which is immediately apparent this time is the deep, nutty, coffee aroma.

Poured a bit flat then generated a rich, thick, pillow or tan froth, head retention was excellent. The smell of the beer was nothing suprising, the normal smokey, toffee notes of most of this style. Allowed to warm up abit the flavor is ""phenominal"" and was very enjoyable. Was quite a bit more drinkable than I anticipated, with roasted black malt dominating the pallate, with some caramel/toffe notes swiming around and lingering on my tounge. Mouthfeel was rich & creamy, enticing another drink. Not quite as hoppy as Storm King, but somehow slightly creamier similar to, but not nearly as sweet as a Cream Stout. The alcoholic flavors were not present as in some beers of this magnitude.

The smell is, typically, a dark roasted coffee and chocolate one. However, there is a bit of fruit following up, possibly raisin.  The taste is primarily the roasted coffee, with a lot of sweet malt flavor. There is a bit of hoppy bitterness, but nothing to compete with the malts.  The mouthfeel is actually extremely light for this kind of beer. Very heavily carbonated, and this leads it to turn to foam once it hits saliva. A thin coffee-bean aftertaste lingers on the taste buds afterward.

Has that wonderful chocolate, coffee, roasted, smokey malts flavor. But it also had this stale wheat smell that you get from macro lagers. Taste, fortunately, doesn't have any trace of that. Great roasted, smokey flavor. You get the coffee, chocolate sweetness too. I gave it a bit of a lower score on mouthfeel because it is quite dry. Not as creamy as you would think you can do with the possibilities of a stout.  Overall, there are better stouts out there. And I'm sure many of them don't come with the same rarity and price tag.

Smell is primarily of cocoa, but there is a definite air of sweet maltiness and some alcohol. Taste is big on the roasted malts with some chocolate in the background and a pretty healthy dose of hoppy bitterness to finish it all off.

Aroma was a roasted malts, unsweetened chocolate, a bit like coffee.  Taste was more of less in line with the aroma. Wonderfully complex flavor of the roasted chocolate malts with a nice bitterness at the end. Couldn't really tell if the bitterness was from the hops or more from the roasted smokey tasting malts. Either way, exceptional.  Thick, full-bodied mouthfeel like a soup. The flavor lingers on your palate for a good while after the taste is gone. Can't really detect the alcohol either.

Dizzying caramel nose with hints of vanilla and molasses. Toasted and blistered quality with each smell. Delicious aromas do justice to the impressive appearance. Dark cherries dipped in melted dark chocolate and topped on to honey biscuits.  T: Immediately what stands out about this beer and makes me an instant fan is the hops component. I found this to be tilted more on the hops side than other offerings from this style. Mocha and figs with huge blasts of cocoa powder. Strong malt backbone with delicious chocolate and roasted coffee tastes. Everything is smoked intensity. At 9% this drinks very easily which can either be a good thing or a bad thing. The only minor drawback is a metallic tinge which is hardly noteworthy.  M: Moderate body with decent carbonation. Enjoyed the bitter hops finish.  D: Picked up a four pack for about nine dollars and considering bombers of other RIS's go for upwards of seven bucks I found this to be a very solid deal (especially for the quality). This was one of the first, non macro, beers I tried and it was nice to see it hold up so amazingly. For the price and availability (being in the PNW) this is highly recommended and beyond drinkable.

When my friend first shared an old Rasputin with me a few months ago, I wasn't prepared for its complex notes of chocolate, oregano, coffee, and cherry. At first, I couldn't taste these flavors at all. However, I quickly came to appreciate them in a way that brought me closer to beer. I have long been able to describe the wines that I drink, but it took a very challenging beer to force me to see beer in the same way.  I'm glad that I did. On top of its complex flavor, this beer has a great aroma. Considerably lighter than its taste, its scent smoothly compliments its balanced taste. Its mouthfeel is silky and smooth without feeling particularly heavy for a stout beer.

Pretty light on the carbonation, but it's very full.  D: Be careful with this one, 'cause it'll knock you on your ass. I can handle maybe two of these in a sitting, but it's almost a challenge. It's such a powerful beer that it can be tough to hve more than one sometimes.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,sonicdescent,4.08,"Pours none more black with a thick and creamy tan head. Leaves a ton of lacing. Simply beautiful.  Smells strongly of coffee and chocolate. Hop presence found in the taste doesn't have much place here.  Tastes of..coffee, chocolate, and a nice bitter hoppy finish. This is definitely a hop-forward stout.  Thick bodied and medium carbonation with a warming sensation.  Very good, very easy to find, but as it warms the hops tend to overtake the other flavors making it more difficult to drink as I prefer hops take a backseat if any seat in my stouts.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,FirstMan,3.9,"I've had this beer in lots of different ways - on tap, in bottle, and most recently, on nitro tap. This is a very different beer in those three modes, I think. Bottle I would rate the worst, then normal tap, then nitro-tap. Thus, I'm reviewing the nitro-tap version here:  A: Black like black. Black black black. Like black, blackly. Blackiest blackity black. Head is light cocoa. Very distinct difference between the head the liquid once the nitro pour settles given the color of said liquid, which is, how to say... black.  S: Distinct hop presence in the nose, but not nearly as prevalent in the nitro pour as in the normal tap version. Non-nitro, I remember being a little scared of this one upon smelling because there were wicked strong hop and roasted chocolate notes. Almost cindery notes. These are there in the nitro pour, but not nearly as ... loudly.  T: This beer does not mess around. It will hunt you down in the dead cold of winter, shoot you, and dump you in the river, standing there while you slip under the ice. It will then go and make love to your sister. It will remain unshaven through all that. That said, on nitro, it will shave. It will also perhaps give you a nice fur hat to wear before all that. Huge biting hop bitterness and full roasted, smokey malt with big coffee and chocolate tongue anvils.  M: On nitro, surprisingly creamy and full given my experience with this being a dryer, more abrupt beer when on tap normally.  D: It's probably just me, but I can't really drink more than one of these at a sitting. I could, but it's just a bit much.  Overall a delicious beer and one of the better Imperial Stouts out there, imho, but the style is not of great drinkability to me.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,gpogo,4.29,"A- Black body with a dark cream colored head. Large head after pour dissipates to a small foamy covering and leaves a small lacing.  A- Very complex aroma. Fruity esters along with a perfume like aroma mixing the fruitiness and hops. Malt aroma behind this fruitiness brings forward a roasty chocolate aroma. I get almost a slight mintiness.  T- Quite a bitter monster of a beer. Incredible spicy bitterness that is definitely felt in my mouth. Lots of roasted malt flavors and chocolate coffee flavors that stick around into the aftertaste.  M- Full bodied beer, but it's incredibly smooth despite the bitterness. Moderate carbonation.  D- This is quite an aggressive stout, almost a meal in a bottle. I highly recommend trying this beer out.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,MPLS,4.42,"Well named beer for a Russian Imperial Stout. By far the most impressive beer I have had from the North Coast Brewing Co. There other beers lack the power of this black brewdoo.  A: Coal-black, a dense cloud of oil, with a mocha whipped 5 cm head.  S: Dark Coffee chocolate like roast, the person next to you could smell it. The smell alone indicated a serious beer, a whisper of alcohol.  T: Instant taste bud erections, the taste lives up to the smell, a dark roasted coffee in front, with a dry roasted door prize in the back. You get a glimpse of the alcohol in the back of your throat, but is never astringent or harsh, nice warming effect.  M: Medium-Heavy, still born , negligible carbonation.  D: Minnesota winters beckon you to buy this thing. Very affordable, one big beer that appears to have lots of distribution.

112,412,ricke,3.96,"Serving date: 2009-01-16. Served in snifter.  Presentation: 355 ml bottle with nice, and quite freaky, artwork on the label: A picture of one of history's most enigmatic and mythical persons, Grigorij Rasputin, surrounded by a quote in Russian (haven't been able to figure out what it says, though).  Appearance: The pour is jet-black with a 2 cm brown head that settles rather quickly, leaving a brown coat over the beer. Small but thick lacings sticks to the glass. I love how the beer reacts when I swirl the glass, it just keeps reproducing a small but dense coat of brown foam.  Smell: A very prominent character of roasted barley. Aromas of coffee and dark chocolate are there as well. The smell is slightly bitter as well. Overall, this one has a rather sharp and robust profile, regarding smell.  Taste: A big and bold taste of roasted barley is coupled with bitter chocolate and notes of coffee. Some sweet flavors are present to. It has a significant hop character, with a nice and sweet malty background. The finish is a nice mixture of bitter hops and sweet chocolate. It hides the alcohol very well, considering its strength.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, full-bodied and medium carbonation.  Drinkability: This is one big imperial stout. A very good beer with a powerful and aggressive profile, pleasant aromas and nicely balanced flavors. Highly recommended.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,ThirdLap,4.4,"Rasputin has been my 'go-to' imperial stout for quite some time now. With regard to the style, it is probably the best deal I've ever found.  This bottle comes from yet another 4-pack purchased at the Davis Co-op for $6.49, however other merchants have begun pricing it at $6.99 to $7.99.  Rasputin fills its namesake nonic glass nearly perfectly, an inch-thick head settling close to the brim. Pouring it, you can see that it isn't quite as opaque as many other 'big' stouts. After several minutes the head recedes to perhaps a 1mm thick coating, with heavy lacing now filling the head's place.  Imagine opening a package of gourmet dark chocolate and taking a good sniff of the wrapper. That's probably the best way I can describe Rasputin's strongest olfactory contribution. Heavy notes of dark chocolate, dark berries, plums, roasted grains, and a just a hint of anise. [EDIT: Since the minor label change that took place around November '08, the amount of anise on the nose seems to have increased significantly.] I'm in awe that such an inexpensive beer can smell so damn good.  My handy little thermometer (in true beer-geek style) is showing 56°F (286° K). Right where I like it. The first sip sends tons of adjectives flying at me, and I find myself torn between typing what I'm experiencing or taking another sip.  Be with you in a moment.  Alright, I'm back. Can you say hops? I think this may be what sets Rasputin apart... few other examples of the style allow for such a perfect marriage of hops with traditional imperial stout characteristics. It is the IPA drinker's Imperial Stout.  Chocolate and mouthfuls of hops are the order of the day here, but the finish is filled with coffee and cola syrup. Malt backbone is right where it should be: just enough to remind you that it's there.  Carbonation is just about perfect, and the velvety smoothness leaves the tongue with just the right amount of residual bitterness and fizz.  While a favorite, Old Rasputin is not the best imperial stout I've ever had. That said, its drinkability is unmatched. I could drink this one all night (and have, on many occasions).  With that, it looks like it's time for me to refill my glass.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,yourefragile,4.43,"10 month old cellared bottle poured into a snifter.  A: Dark chocolate, mahogany color that seems relatively clear despite the darkness. Dark brown still, thick head that has great retention and slowly receding streaks of brown lacing. S: Sharp, slightly medicinal bitter chocolate aroma with light coffee and strong hop aroma. T: Rich, bitter coffee and chocolate flavors with a heavy helping of dark fruits (plum, etc). Strong hop flavor still persists in the finish. A dry, sweeter chocolaty flavor persists long into the finish. M: Full, lightly carbonated body, fills the mouth and is very light and smooth. D: Exceptional, no hint of alcohol anywhere in this beer. One of my favorite RISs, especially at price and availability. Comparable to Storm King, but I think I prefer this.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,ncstateplaya,3.95,"Appearance: As dark as used motor oil, when poured into a glass a golden brown head erupts but receeds to a nice wispy cap of the surface. In line with the head, the lacing was minimal (would have rated higher if the head held up, possibly my glass???).  Smell: I thought the nose was dominated by roasted nuts with hints of coffee. There is a little bitterness that is pleasing to the nose. The alcohol is masked, but can be found with deep breaths.  Taste: Bitter, but contained. Slights flavors of coffee accompany the hoppy bitterness. Creamy malts create a nice backbone. The finish is characterized by biscuity flavors and coffee. The alcohol goes surprisingly undetected.  Mouthfeel: It is lighter bodied than I had expected, but still nice. It has moderately high carbonation, and stays lively in the mouth. Nice and smooth with a coating effect throughout the mouth.  Drinkability: I would have to say this isn't the most enjoyable nor tastiest RIS I have had. But I will point out that it is a very drinkable beer that I could solely enjoy for the evening, albeit it would be a short evening at 9%.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Bootscraper,4.31,"At another board this beer was talked about and raved up and down for some time. I just thought it was awesome that it pays tribute to Rasputin. Served a little bit over 50 degrees F in pint glass listening to The Best of Mountain. Pours like motor oil, and looks like motor oil in the glass. Seriously, this thing is as black as 4-chan's humor and opaque even when held right beside a light bulb. Beautiful. A 2 cm bubbly (but very creamy) very tan head sprung up, and briefly continued to rise after the pour. After a good 5 minutes, it had shrunk to just a thin layer, and stayed that way for a good while down the glass. The lacing was pretty steady, and clung on for dear life, not going anywhere for quite some time. For as much as this beer was hyped up, I was honestly expecting a little bit more impressive head, so at this point I'm wondering what I did wrong. The smell was modest, yet what was there was robust. I had the Thelonious Monk beer by this same brewery, and they both had the same ""barbecue"" smell to it. I'm assuming now that it is roasted malt. There is also some cappuccino right behind it. The taste, unsurprisingly, is a very roasted, charred one. It progresses towards the finish, along with some dark fruit flavors. Throughout the entirety of each sip, that creamy coffee is slightly present, as well as alcohol. The alcohol actually blends with the flavors nicely though, so it is hidden quite nicely. At most, it puts up a slight sting in the back of your throat at the swallow, but it mostly just translates to a pleasantly warming feeling. If nothing else, it comes off as a very dark chocolate (at least in the after-taste). The mouth-feel is pretty darn smooth, considering how upfront and robust this beer is in general. It's also fairly full-bodied, and I enjoy the low carbonation levels and yet there is a very slight tingly feeling to accent this nicely. This is pretty damn syrupy as well, at least for a stout... though I understand that this particular style is supposed to be quite sticky from the addition of much more malt. In all, I guess this is quite drinkable if you enjoy a beer of this style on this caliber. I'm in my second and determining that this would be best accompanied with a rich dinner, but I am having no trouble sipping through this.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,MrIncognito,4.35,"A - Incredibly dark brown to black with a fluffy mocha head. Head lasts quite a while and simmers to a nice 1/8-inch lace on top. Great sticky lacing on the sides of the glass as drank.  S - Espresso, dark chocolate, and roasted malt all at once like a slap in the face. Boozy alcohol when I really stick my nose in and take a good long whiff.  T&M - I taste the espresso off the bat and then chased by the roasted malt and finally with a nice twinge of dark chocolate in the aftertaste. Nicely balanced in these flavors and none of these overpowers the other, rather compliments each other. A bit of a thick brew with a sticky mouthfeel. The alcohol is warming and not as noticable as I expected. The alcohol seems to meld into the flavors as the beer warms.  D - Such a great sipping beer and nice to drink. It would be hard to drink more than two of these in one night as you have to sip and savor this or the alcohol will knock you out.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,beerorRIP,4.3,"on tap @ stuff yer face (from notes i remember taking on a phone that died)  a full pour into a standard pint glass revealed a black as night body. a dark brown 1 finger head crowned the glass, which eventually crept down. some sticky brown lace was hanging on the sides of the glass throughout.  smells like RIS... nice deep roasty barley, chocolates, some coffee (although not as much as others), and a whiff of alcohol. no noticable hop aroma.  the taste was soooo nice. rich and chocolatey. slight coffee and perhaps sweetness of a ripe fruit. bitter balanced well with the noticable malt character of the beer. the alcohol is really well hidden and only peaks out from under the covers when i rolled it around my mouth for a while. delicious.  not super thick, but a thick and creamy mouthfeel that is of course expected for the style. it does suit the flavors of the beer really well.  dangerous. that is the drinkability of this crazy old man. after one i started to feel it in my head and promptly got something to eat. the second one told me ""you ain't gettin' away that easy"" and made me feel quite relaxed.  overall, highly recommended! a great RIS that i overlooked for a long time... and do i regret that? yes.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,schroederm,4.58,"I had the privilege of drinking this beer on nitro, so my opinions are a little skewed by the benefits of serving this kind of beer in that manner. First off, it looks fantastic. The head is full, looks sort of like chocolaty whipped cream with a sheen across its surface. Dark as night. Smells quite good, with a little bit of alcohol coming through roasty notes. Tastes even better than it smells: excellent maltiness, nice bitter finish, notes of anise, chocolate, and coffee.  The mouthfeel is really what did it for me, again, probably due to nitrogen. Exceptionally creamy, perfect level of carbonation. Avoided swallowing as long as I could bear...  Overall: great RIS, I highly recommend it.

Hops really come through in the taste. Also present are hints of coffee, vanilla, cinnamon, licorice and a roasted nut profile. Alcohol can be detected on the way down but does not overpower the flavor.  Exceptionally smooth with a medium amount of carbonation.

112,412,bigkahunas4,4.92,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Tulip glass.  Brew came out of the bottle jet black, not too thick, not too thin. Dark cookie head starts at about 2 fingers, and settles down to a voluptuous half finger. Spotty, sticky lacing that really clings to the glass. The aroma on this out of the bottle was huge, and now as the glass settles about a yard away, butterscotch is just flowing under my nose. Upon further inspection I detect some sttrrronnggg vanilla and a dark roast.  This elixir is incredibly creamy, bringing immense sweetness to the front of the mouth. Big sweet malts like I've never tasted before in a stout/RIS - tons of oaked vanilla. As this bubbly brew begins to settle on the tongue, bitter coffee nibs take control of the palate. A slight smokiness to the brew as well. Alcohol is apparent, but masked incredibly.  Certainly the best RIS I've ever had, and according to others, it perhaps is the best out there. Just incredible balance, and enjoyment with every stage of that balance for me. Honestly, I'm not a huge stout guy - but this one is just making me drool. I dislike the finish of most stouts - but this one just hits it on the head. Give me more!  Pretty sure the ratings I'm giving this will make it my top rated beer.

So all these years later and I finally tried it again... it pours nicely and is like any other good RIS, dark black and with a tan head, etc... the aroma is chocolatey with a bit of espresso.. The main thing I have to say about it now is that it is very smokey. Its got a very smokey, burnt bread taste and aftertaste to it. It has a bitterness that is really similar to black coffee.. I wished it was a bit sweeter. It's definitely a fine stout and I can understand why it has such a high rating, but I think it could stand to be just a tad bit sweeter to give more balance to the smoke/burnt bread taste and mouth feel.

112,412,jokelahoma,4.45,"Had this one on tap at Old Chicago in Olathe, KS.  Poured into a small brandy snifter/tulip style glass. Came to me completely opaque black and a decent sized creamy head that lasted the entire way to the bottom.  The smell on this one is fantastic. It's full of dark fruits, roasted grains, a bit of pleasant hop aroma... it's everything you can really ask for from the aroma of an Imperial Stout. Extremely appetizing, and enough to make your mouth water.  The taste doesn't let you down, either. Up front you get hit with a healthy dose of roasted malt flavor, followed by the sweetness of the base malts. That sweetness stays throughout the sip, but it balanced nicely by the deceptively high level of bitterness, both from the hops and from the more astringent character of the darker malts. The darker fruit aromas also make their presence known in the flavor, giving the beer a plum/currant note that is very nice on the tongue. And to top it all off, there's really no hint of the 9% ABV in the taste. It's way too easy to drink, but that's not necessarily a bad thing, now is it?  The mouthfeel was a tad lighter than I had expected. Not light, by any means, but lighter than one might think an Imperial Stout would be. This both aids the drinkability of the beer, and disappoints in some odd way. Overall, though, it isn't a big hindrance to the enjoyment.  This one is really, really well made. Sweet without being cloying, well balanced, not trying to be grabbing you by the throat and screaming ""Imperial Stout Here! Bet you can't drink me!"". It's very well put together, easy to drink, satisfying, and just generally a very, very good beer. Highly recommended.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,DefenCorps,4.45,"Grabbed a 4-pack in Sept 2007 and sat on two bottles for a while. This is one of them.  A: A very black Old Rasputin under an inch thick cap of brown head that leaves a nice pattern of foam along the side of my 22oz snifter.  S: On the nose, there is some rich chocolate, absolutely gorgeous. Not very dark, there's some creaminess and a hint of coffee to back it up. Some sherry-like oxidation is present, adding to the complexity. Mellow and wonderfully well-balanced, this beer's a charm.  T: After drinking as many BA imperials as I've had in the past week, it's remarkable how wonderful a straight up imperial stout is! Smooth, soft medium dark chocolate with a hint of sweetness, a little bit of cream and a wonderfully bitter finish. Oxidation isn't as noticeable as it was on the nose. There is some licorice that's noticeable as it warms up, though. All told, wonderfully mellow.  M: Moderate in body with carbonation that's solid (maybe a little bit too much) and an excellent finish  D: Wow. This is one dangerously drinkable beer. Definitely stocking up on this.  **Edit 03 August 2012** This is my final bottle from that 4-pack from Sept 2007.  The nose has taken on a decidedly roasty, ashy and unsweetened cocoa tinge. Mildly fruity, not particularly oxidized, but it is mellow. The palate opens fruity with mild raisins along with heavily roasted grains, a little char and a little ash. Pretty intense. The mid-palate has fallen off, it's too mellow and lacking in character. Medium in body with a roasty, mildly ashy and moderately fruity finish that's also got some cocoa and caramel, this feels nice on the palate.

Dark chocolate and intense roasted coffee as it warms. I think that I also picked up some molassas.  T: Strong dark coffee dominates the flavor, but it doesn't mask the alcohol. A little bitter.  M: Tighter carbonation than expected. Warming on the back of the throat. A little thinner than I expected.

112,412,SwiftyMcBeer,4.05,"Pours jet black with a tan head that has a wonderful oil layer on top. Really nice looking brew. The smell is even better, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate. The taste continues the trip to Chocolate town with hints of coffee and caramel to boot. This is an intense beer, you really take your time with it and one is probably plenty, but I really enjoyed it. I've never been a stout guy, but this is a couple in a row that I've enjoyed. I would definetly have this beer again, it would be a great dessert after a meal.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,TMB0424,4.85,"12 oz bottle poured into snifter.  Pours an complete pitch black body. Black as night. Medium sized, loose, creamy coffee colored head quickly dissipates into fine outer ring. What is left of the head is only now a murky, pond-scum (but a strangely delicious looking pond-scum!). Pretty good amount of carbonation wisps up to meet the diminished head. Dense, thick lacing along my glass. Damn good looking.  Aroma of freshly brewed roasted coffee... perhaps even expresso. A light scent of ale-like fruity yeast complimented by a subtle touch of melted dark chocolate. Very rich smelling. Smokey, roasted malts as well. A light, pleasant splash of grassy, earthy hops is lurking somewhere in the background of this beastly brew as well. I'm also getting the spicy warmth of the alcohol. Exceptionally well smelling.  Taste is incredible. So many flavors just attack your palate. Rich, smooth dark chocolates blended perfectly with a bitter splash of expresso. And right in the middle of all that is a dash of fruity sweetness... but so delicate and well-placed. Fresh, ripened fruits. Plums are coming to mind. The smokey malts in the aroma are in the taste as well. The finish is refreshingly bittersweet, with a wave of alcohol warmth. Outstanding.  Mouthfeel is indescribably creamy. Talk about thick... talk about chewy. But creamy as all hell. Full bodied. The term bittersweet is used a lot... but this is the epitome of bittersweet. Unreal.  Drinkability is exceptional. The alcohol warmth and kick at the finish designates this a sipper - but a damn good sipper at that. The best Russian Imperial I've had. This is a must try for any stout lover. It's just perfectly balanced, perfectly brewed, just perfect.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,damienblack,4.35,"Pours thick and black, your standard RIS appearance with a consistency like chocolate syrup. Nice little tan head with good retention. Has that cocoa powder smell, with the idea that ""you are about to get your ass whooped by a huge stout."" We'll see if that holds true.  First impression: someone robbed a tin of 90% cocoa powder and poured it in here. It's like the superconcentrated intense chocolate experience of Weyerbacher XIII, except I don't have to choke it down. A little hop presence to balance out the chocolate/coffee, and that's it. Nice and coating without being overly cloying, and no crappy aftertaste to speak of, which is quite a feat when you consider the ABV and intense flavors. A great sessionable RIS.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Mouthfeel is great, so nice and smooth, not too carbonated. Some alcohol taste present, but still very drinkable. Overall, this tastes like a very good RIS, but the quality lies in how well is drinks. One of my favorites.

112,412,Wackyfoot,4.58,"One of the darkest pours I've ever seen, thick and heavy with a medium brown head. Massive hits of coffee beans and bitter chocolate with just a slight hint of the alcohol buried beneath it all. How I miss my youthful days when I used to regularly drink four of these a night.

112,412,Reagan1984,4,"Thick brown head with excellent retention. Virtually black beer. Thick walls of lacing.  Aroma is heavenly. Smells a bit like Kaluha. Some deep dark coffee, a bit of alcohol. There is also some sweetness that almost makes me think of coffee syrup. (From Rhode Island)  Strong roasted grains up front. You get a real sense of this and its just shy of burnt. Like a deep espresso. Then some alcohol comes in to warm your heart. Is the finish big bitter hops or dark roasted malts? I think its both. The sweetness is there and enough to balance the dark notes.  Its almost creamy and has a thick body. Huge mouth feel. I enjoy splitting a bottle with my wife.  Very good.  Note, had this on nitro-tap at Deep Ellum last week. It was even better in that format.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

The color was black and there was no carbonation to be seen. The dark roasted barley and the chocolate came through the beer immediately. A very nice aroma to this beer. The smell definitely had me looking forward to tasting this beer.  Very thick fully bodied beer, that had a touch of bitterness coming right through. The smokey, dark taste was really impressive. I thought that I got some coffee flavor breaking through the beer, which made for a nice aftertaste.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Coffee and espresso. Roasted flavor is restrained not harsh. Very complex and layered with plenty of booze.  MF: Thick and silky smooth. Dry finish. Well attenuated.  D, notes: Not sure I waited so long to try this classic. Very good.

112,412,wheelinshirt,4.76,"12 oz stubby brown bottle from Abe's in Bethlehem. Cost me $2.50 which I think is a real steal.  Pours pitch black with a big, cascading ,cocoa colored head. Retention is great and leaves a bunch of lacing down the side of the glass. Amazing looking.  Smell is rich and full of dark roasted malts and booze. Very nice but not complex enough to get a 5. I think my sense of smell is fairly weak, though.  Tastes of rich roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, a nice boozy kick. This is amazing. There really isn't anything here that you wouldn't expect or wouldn't want. Basically a perfect RIS.  Mouthfeel is full, rich, creamy. The foam was thick, too. It was like eating stout ice cream.  Drinkabilty is awesome. This is a big beer (9%) and it is really big on taste, but I could easily drink a couple in a night. The hardest part was stopping myself from getting too tipsy and waking up with a hangover. Highly recommended.

Smells of roasted malts and booze. Hints of smoke, chocolate, and coffee.  Tastes of darkly roasted malts, dark coffee (sumatran, e.g.), with a perfectly complimenting sweet side to it.

I love stouts and porter's but where I live the selection is not great.  This beer pours a great head (my myspace picture is a fresh pour into a snifter glass). The aroma is respectable, the taste is dominated by dark chocolate, it's a pretty sweet beer. It reminds me of Rogue's Chocoloate Stout but is not quite as complex and bites harder than the Rogue Choc. Stout. However, it does not fee like 9% alcohol that is for sure.  This is one of my new favorites, my only request would be a little more bitterness or a second malt flavor to jump out other than just the dark chocolate. As is it is very drinkable and worth the price.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Soneast,4.11,"This pours a pitch-black color. The head was quite explosive, even with a fairly gentle pour I ended up with about a 3 finger, light brown colored head. Had to wait for the head to die down a bit to finish pouring the rest of the bottle. Just thick and creamy, leaving large pillows of bubbles on the glass as I drink the beer. By the end of my beer the entire glass was just coated with the brown colored head.  A thick, earthy roasted malt aroma up front. A sort of resinous, dark chocolate aroma in the background.  A burnt/bittered chocolate flavor initially. Sweet, roasted malts throughout and a very nice balanced bitter hop flavor that ends with a delectable sweetness on the palate. I'll be frank, this tastes AWESOME! Well balanced and it has a complexity that I trust is only going to improve with age.  This beer has a thick, filling character. The carbonation is very well balanced with the heaviness of the beer. This just tastes so good and I love the aftertaste. Another great stout to compliment the cold, snowy weather we've been contending with in central Wisconsin for the past few weeks. This is 9% ABV? Coulda fooled me, cause you sure can't taste it. It's a sipper, for sure, but something that I could sip on all day.  *EDIT 12/25/09* Add a year to this beer....and holy crap is it amazing. I thought it was good before. Now...it may very well be my favorite stout. Just delicious! Screw Rasputin XII, it doesn't get much better than this.

This beer is definitely not for the weak, or for people who can't appreciate the style. This beer starts with a rich molasses pour, that is as black as black can get; great cascade into the dark tan/ light brown head. The smell is of rich black roasted malts, with hints of rye and oats. I know each person is different, some prefer to sip this beer; but I can't help but almost chug it, if that says anything about the drinkability.

Aroma has the usual chocolate and brownie characteristics, but it doesn't overwhelm as a lemony citric aroma is also present from the hops. Taste hits like fudge cake and dark chocolate, coating the tongue before the citrus from the hops hits, a unique taste I find for this style, at least in my experience. Finishes dark and bitter with an undercurrent of sweetness like a nugget of dark chocolate.

Has 9% but is one of those beers that'll sweet talk you, only to steal your wallet later.  One of these bad boys usually satisfies but could easily be a 'session' sipper for the hardy.

The aroma is of dark roast coffee, dark chocolate, resiny wood, mint and licorice. It is full bodied, soft and sparkling and leaves the tongue dry.

Two-finger head like a tan colored leather car seat that dissipated relatively quickly. Lacing was incredible, though. A beauty to look at.  Wasn't blown away by the aromas. Chocolate malt with a roasted character, sure. Small hint of coffee. A bit of alcohol. Some raisin, but I had to hunt for it.  Taste is a different story. What was fleeting in the smell is assuredly there on the tongue. Chocolate washes over the mouth in waves. A surprising floral hop character says 'hello' for long enough to kiss the sides of the tongue and linger until the beer finishes strong with toffee and dark fruit. None of the flavors, except for perhaps chocolate malt, were as strong as desired, but everything was quite lovely and balanced.  The first sip had an heavy alcohol note, but the 9% ABV was hardly noticeable after that, especially as the beer warmed. There is a strong temptation to drink more than you should. Mouthfeel was pretty good, not too awfully thick but still with a desirable stickiness.  Old Rasputin probably deserves its canonical spot as a point of constant comparison, a standard-bearer, for the style. It seems impossible to be displeased by it.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

The beer is almost black. It does not let any light pass through.  Aroma of copper is most prominent, with secondary aromas of earth and charred wood.  Tastes of copper and earth. As it rolls around the mouth slight taste of hops and chocolate, just the barest of hints.  Feels like a lightly carbonated zero weight oil in the mouth.

112,412,PDXHops,3.88,"This was one of the first ""big"" beers I had a few years ago, but I haven't had it for quite a long time. Old Rasputin is one of those beers that it's easy to take for granted, given it's fairly wide availability. Ran into it on tap today, and decided to give an old friend a try. Served in a chalice glass.  The pour yields little head (perhaps due to the width of the chalice opening), but the carbonation is surprisingly zesty and long lasting. The head lingers til the end with a bit of lacing. The beer itself is near black and opaque  Nothing jumps out aroma-wise other than nicely toasted malt and chocolate, but the first sip reveals a lively combination of bitter chocolate, milk chocolate, fig newtons, raisins, and a nice bitter bite of hops on the finish.  The mouthfeel is pretty good, as the zippy carbonation makes up for a thinner body than I expected. At 9%, the drinkability is pretty dangerous- this one goes down nice and smooth!  Very solid beer, and again, one that it's easy to take for granted without the buzz of a seasonal release. Good stuff, and I'm glad to have found it on tap.

112,412,3leggeddub,2.88,"If I trawl the old memory banks I think good ol' Rasputin was one of the first imperial stouts that I had and the one thing I've always liked is the way it looked. Pitch black with a respectably thick tan head that thins down to a thin cover that leaves sticky lacing all the way down. No light getting through this stuff at all. The nose is pretty appealing with sweet notes of dark fruit like plum or raisin. Of course at 9% ABV you can definitely smell the booze in there.  To be blunt the first sip of Rasputin is a kick in the mouth. The carbonation is sharp and hits your tongue first. After that it's big bitterness around the edges. There's a coffee flavor that goes beyond dark roasted into burnt. The word acrid comes to mind to describe the first third of the bottle. The fruit in the nose are pretty much nowhere to be found in the taste. As you make your way through the bottle your palette starts to get used to the bitterness. With that acclimatization comes the realization that Rasputin has a nice velvety body that bitterness aside is very pleasant. Flavor-wise you notice some fleeting hints of unsweetened baker's chocolate and a touch of roasted malt. Lingering underneath that is an earthy, chalky aftertaste that isn't all together unpleasant. Aside from the bitterness there's little other flavor in here to hang a hat on and enjoy.  Put all of this together and Rasputin is a decent imperial stout, but personally I don't see it as balanced, complex or amazing as many others do. For those still trying to find their preference in the world of RIS's I would recommend trying Rasputin at least once to see if a more bitter stout is for you.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,Wetpaperbag,4.07,"A- This is very jet black, with a finger width and a half of tan fluffy head. This is very much like one would expect to get from a RIS in terms of the appearance.  S- I'm getting a great coffee and chocolate smell with a hint of vanilla. There is a slight anise smell too, which I'm excited about, I'm a fan of anise in RIS beers. I'm also getting a some hop smell, lets see if that is there with the taste.  T- The coffee taste is there in the beginning...stays in the middle of the taste, but is more of a force in the end. The chocolate taste is slight, and I'm getting some cherry there with it as well. The anise smell didn't stay with the taste. The taste is good, a bit more coffee then I would want, I guess its not the amount of coffee that is there, but the bitterness that results. I do like the sweetness that is there from time to time though.  M- This is slightly dry, and I feel kinda a weird coating over my mouth.  D- Very drinkable, and tasty. I'm glad this is regularly released in my area.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,kshankar,4.2,"Appearance: Black with a brown/tan head.  Aroma: Coffee, chocolate and some hops in the background. Complex.  Taste: Bitterness, mostly coming from the coffee and chocolate, very complex. And the flavors are very upfront. Hops contribute little to the bitterness as well.  Mouthfeel: Smooth going down, creamy-ish, and decent carbonation.  Drinkability: I would feel bad giving it low ratings for this, so I won't. Its not meant to be a drinkable beer, in the sense of being able to go through a few. This is a sipping beer. Not really something you can go through a few of.

A great beer... definitely in my top 5.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,MacDomer,4.67,"Poured into my standard pint glass. This one is about a year and a half old - more due to forgetting that it was there than actually making an attempt to cellar it.  A - Dark tan two-finger head even with a soft pour. Dark as night, but not quite black. Hints of dark chocolate brown around the edges. A light brown, thiner lacing all the way through. Appears very thick.  S - Rich and complex. Coffee, expresso, licorice, and chocolate. A bit of alcohol and very faint hops.  T - Delicious! Complex with many layers of coffee, dark espresso, chocolate bitterness and dark roasted malts. Bitter though the finish with some hops and roasted bitterness, and a bit warming .  M - This is a pretty full beer with moderate carbonation, which really makes it smooth. Finish is very long.  D - Very high!

Oder is that of roasted coffee with a hint of chocolate. Alcohol is also a prominent scent.  Taste is pretty much roasted malt with an alcohol backround that's not too overpowering. Very good tasting stout. Kind of a coffee backround to it, yum!!!  Beautiful creamy mouthfeel that stuck to my toungue. OUTSTANDING!!!  This is definatly an after dinner beer.

Smell is of rich, tasty dark chocolate with a touch of caramel and some coffee notes as well. Taste is of rich, chocolate and coffee with a bitter twang of hops in the background throughout. Little hints of dark fruit, plum and cherry on the mid palate and one of the smoothest, chocolaty, yet dry finish I have ever tasted. Wow, mouthfeel is full bodied and very creamy - again, what an incredibly creamy, dry finish - beautiful.

A great balance of coffee, darker plums and red cherries, and chocolate arrive at the nose. Sweet chocolate is present as well.  Coffee and Roasted malts come out right away in the taste and ride all the way through. While the fruits and bitter sweet chocolate come on more towards the end. A pleasant bitter coffee after taste rests on the palate.  Not as creamy as I was hoping for, and a little on the over carbonated side for the style.  But all in all, for the price a great go to RIS.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Mouthfeel: very silky goes down smooth..and also you dont get a burn from the alcohol for a 9% beer..leaves you wanting more and more of this great stuff  Drinkability: i could drink a couple but not so much  one of my favorite RIS beats brooklyns any day and im a big fan of brooklyn,North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,optiontwo,3.9,"12oz. poured into tulip glass  Appearance: Pours extremely dark with no transparency and a generous amount (about two inches) of tan head.  Smell: Reminds me of a standard RIS but smokier. Dark chocolate, coffee, and maybe a little tobacco detected.  Taste: Good stuff but I can't believe this isn't a smoked stout. All the flavors (chocolate, nut, coffee) are all backed by a strong smokiness. Not to say that's a bad thing, it's nice actually, I'm just surprised.  Mouthfeel: Good. Nice amount of carbonation, not too overpoweringly thick.  Drinkability: This brew is actually lighter than I expected so that ups the drinkability slightly, but it's 9% so it's not like you're going to be drinking this one all night.  Overall: I enjoyed this brew. It has a very solid flavor to it and is relatively easy to drink. Personally I enjoy a little more dark fruit flavor to my imperial stouts but that by no means is to say I don't like Old Rasputin. I understand why this is such a highly rated beer. I will be picking this one up again.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,jbsmth,5,"This Northern California brewed Russian Imperial Stout is one of my favorite beers. Old Rasputin is absolutely deliciously overwhelming with roasted malt and alcohol.

Retention is pretty good- halfway through I've still got a nice thin layer which leaves impressive and sticky lace. As for color: it's black. What else is there to say?  Smells of roasted malts and booze. Hints of smoke, chocolate, and coffee.  Tastes of darkly roasted malts, dark coffee (sumatran, e.g.), with a perfectly complimenting sweet side to it.  A bit more carbonated than I would like (and the bottle more so than on tap, if I remember correctly). Still pretty smooth, though.  Goes down easy for an RIS. Excellent beer.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Gish,4.35,"I had this beer a few months ago and was a bit overwhelmed, so I put the rest away for a few months and now am trying it again to review.  Poured into a snifter. Has a huge tannish head and good lacing. Smells of smokey malts with an undercurrent of alcohol.  Old Rasputin tastes much better after a few months in my opinion. The flavors blend together very nicely now. Roasted malt, chocolate, a bit of sweetness in the aftertaste. Has just a slight twinge of alcohol, but the overall effect is much better.  The mouthfeel is almost creamy, definitely very smooth. Not the most drinkable Russian Imperial Stout I've had, but it's close. Maybe my palate has just matured in the last few months, or Old Rasputin needs a little aging, but I have definitely changed my mind about this beer.

112,412,JordanC,4.18,"Loved the dark appearance that was strangely obvious as a dark dark brown, but not black  Smell lacked a bit, perhaps because it was too cold at first. As it warmed, the roasty smell of malts and sweet molasses came through  Loved the coffee hints and chocolaty taste. Went incredibly with a slice of coffee-ice cream cake  I thought it was slightly over carbonated, but not distractingly so. A good thickness on the tongue that lingered  This is a highly recommended beer. One of my favorites, especially since it comes in 12 ounce bottles and so many good stouts are 22 ouncers",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Dark, roasted and beguiling, with a hint of hops; coffee and chocolate to boot.  see smell above, and add the fact that that i'm weeping as i type this...  like carbonated molasses, and i mean that in the in the best possible way.  here we reach a dilemma, do i love imperial stouts, F*CK YES!!! could i drink them all night?? probably not, even if they are god... uh, i mean, good.  epilogue: i made a black and tan with this and pliny the elder. needless to say, i've put in an order for a new set of taste buds...",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,Atlas1,4.45,"Love me some Old Rasputin.  Poured into a belgian snifter glass, this beer is pitch black with a thick, light brown head on top. Good foam retention and lace. The nose is dense with strong caramel, licorice, coffee, chocolate, molasses, dark cherries, candied sugar, fig and other assorted fruits. Very complex interlay of malt and hops, although the hops take a back seat in the aroma. The taste is rich and satisfying, but also well-balanced. Coffee is heavy, as is a chocolate/cherry flavor up front in the mouth. Good lingering coffee bitterness at the end. Dry finish in the mouthfeel really rounds things out nicely.  A readily drinkable imperial Russian stout. And, given the fact that it's accessible in most major markets around the country, it's even more appealing. Totally accessible for beer geeks and neophytes alike in my opinion. A great intro to the style, and a wonderful example of what all imperial stouts should strive for.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Buebie,2.7,"Poured from a 12oz brown bottle with no freshness date, into a snifter. Color is pitch black with no color to be found. 3 finger creamy brown head, sits there and sits there. Big thick clumps of lace rings around the glass. Retention is outstanding.  Great big sweet chocolate aroma of the knose. Some grainy earthy aromas, mixed with hints of grassy hops. Oh that sweet milk chocolate aroma is intoxicating. No alcahol fumes off the aroma.  More carbonation than anticipated, mouthfeel is somwhat thin for an RIS. Yet there is still an inky like texture. Bitter chocolate grainy flavors. The sweetness in the aroma is now nowhere to be found. This is quite bitter. Kind of a chalky aspirin flavor at the swallow. Some alcahol warming at this point. Becoming increasingly bitter with hints of spicy hops at the lingering finish.  It was a terrific beer, until I took a sip. Then it became an ok beer for the style. Way too much carbonation, not thick and creamy either.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Gmann,3.97,"Pours the color of used motor oil, nice fluffy brown head that settles slowly into a cap. The aroma is of dark roasted coffee, bittersweet chocolate, burnt wood, and a touch of grape sweetness. All big and bold. The flavor is of freshly ground coffee beans, roasted chocolate, some smoke/burnt wood, vanilla and rum notes, and bad vodka?. The feel is a bit harsh for my liking. The body is nice and chewy and there is a nice smoothness to it but there is also a raw booziness that I am not fond of. Not a red wine booziness but hard alcohol booziness. Like I mentioned before, kind of reminds me of bad vodka out of a plastic jug. Definitely a big and bold RIS, great roasted malt and chocolate malt flavors but the hard booziness is getting to me a bit.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,germanbeer1,4.32,"Excellent dark color with a tan head that gives off strong scents of chocolate, mocha and some malts. I particularly enjoyed this imperial stout, because even though the ABV is 9%, it is very difficult to recognize any traces of alcohol.

Smells of rich chocolate , slight coffee and alcohol  Tastes of some chocolate and coffee. Strong alcohol taste up front with a medium bitter aftertaste  Has low to medium carbonation with a bitter mouth feel towards the end  Beer was overwhelming, too strong with the chocolate/bitter combo. Couldnt possibly drink more than one at a time. Beer is very highly rated, this was my first Imperial Stout , maybe im not accustomed to this style.

112,412,sgoodship,4.08,"My friend Brian gave me this because he thought I would like it. He was right. Cheers Brian!  A: Proud looking stout. Poured an extremely large, really dark coffee stained bubbly head. Surprised by how audible the carbonation was. Lovely oily black liquid with a nice amount of ruby red showing through against the light. Lacing is great but doesn't really stick. Head dissipates to a thin dusting and eventually to a ring.  S: For me, the big malt and alcohol strength came across loudest at first. Coffee was very dominant throughout. From time to time, I got a slight phenolic reading too.  T: Massive roasted chocolate malt taste. Strong coffee, anice, licorice & dark fruit. It is not all bitter though, there is also some crystal type sweetness there too. The alcohol was pretty well masked at first but it started coming through as sherry or port toward the end of the drink. The aftertaste was a little too acidic for me but moved swiftly into a lasting bitter coffee and hop that was pleasing. Nice and chewy with plenty of complexity to keep you thinking.  M: Full bodied. Slickness that coats the mouth. Generally very smooth and creamy apart from the liveliness of the carbonation.  D: In the spirit of it being imperial, I felt like it was a very rich and high quality RIS. It was lovely and warming. Rasputin is a great label for it - it certainly had a mysterious aspect to it. I don't find this style highly drinkable, I like to have one once in a while. Having said that, it was an easy drink to put to rest. A fine brew that I'll happily pick up again in future.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Blursimarsi,4.5,"(Bottle) The"" pop"" sound from the bottle cap is very inviting and calming; there is carbonation! Some haze rising from the bottleneck seconds after. The pour is dark brown with some mahogany notes as well as a dark reddish hint. In the glass, the beer looks darn black. On top of everything, you get a one finger high, medium brown head. The first thing that hits you ones you sniff the beer is a massive, 50/50 blend of dark caramel and deluxe-ish, dark creamy chocolate. Higher, more burned tones of blackcurrant/tar-like liquorice, bitter cocoa, deep caramelized brown sugar and black coffee beans/aromatic espresso. The hop profile in this beer is becoming more extreme for every year. I have stored this beer for more then one year and the aroma hops is still full of citric/grapefruity and resiny notes. The alcohol is also impressive; not too sharp nor too aggressive, it just adds more elegance to the nose. A light dark fruitiness is lurking in the background. The roast is dry and the caramel is sweet - just perfect. The flavour is a mix of elegant roasted and burned malts with tones of dark chocolate, dark caramel, black coffee/espresso, liquorice, tar and asphalt. The hops bring obvious notes of citrus and resin, but there is also some room for earth and grass. The mouthfeel is round, smooth and light silky with a soft, easy carbonation. A dark fruity touch of prunes and dry raisins. The aftertaste is noting less the stellar with a touch of citrus, dry coffee/cocoa roast and a light sweet port hint. Medium to full bodied. This beer is has a perfect malt profile. The hops a bit too tart, still fantastic!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,tbart428,2.88,The beer pours pitch black. The head is light brown when first poured then settles to a off white colored foam. The smell is of roasted grain but all in all not much of a smell. The first taste is intense roasted flavors followed by a intense bitterness of hops.Neither one of the intense flavors in this beer are all that appealing to me. As I drink this beer the drinkability of this beer is decreasing with each sip. The beer is increadibly roasty at first then it transitions into a very bitter flavor from the hops and then it finishes with alcohol. The beer is intense in the mouth it is increadibly rough with the bittering hops. Overall the beer is a good night cap beer that is ggod to drink once in awhile. Compared to other RIPS it is slightly better than average. Worth trying and would buy again. I live in Portland Maine and buy this beer off tap at Novre Res and have to say off tp this beer is increadible. The flavors are subdued a lot and there is more of a balanced flavor.

112,412,sweetbrew82,4.08,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass:  P: Pours a very dark brown from this cool ass looking bottle, and sits nearly opaque black in the glass. The tannish colored light brown head is about 1 ½ inches deep, with tiny bubbles frolicking about. Not great head retention, probably due to the high ABV, but actually pretty decent considering. Fits the bill of an RIS.  A: Big whiffs reveal the scents of bitter-sweet chocolate, coffee, molasses, roasted malts, and a nice hop presence as well. Not as robust as I was hoping for, though.  T: The chocolate reigns supreme here, followed by the coffee. The hops make their arrival about halfway in and threaten to overtake the regime, as a nice amount of hop spice kicks down the door and introduces itself. The balance that is subsequently achieved here is superb. Great roasted malts upfront, followed by the hops which levels the playing field and provides a nice and spicy bite on the tongue on its retreat. The more I drink it, though, the hops seem to overstep their boundaries and get in the way of the RIS show a little too much. Still, this is well done and very tasty!  M: I would classify the mouthfeel of Old Rasputin as full-bodied, chewy, rich, and an absolutely pleasantly creamy treat for the palate.  D: Personally, I could drink this one as a session beer, but then again I love me some stout!  Notes: The Old Rasputin provides a nice balance between the roasted chocolate and coffee malts, and the hop bitterness. Although it's a little too hoppy for my tastes, it's still a real winner in my book! And a great QPR beer as well (4-pack for only $7.99). For anyone who loves stouts, and especially Russian Imperial Stouts, this one should be on your short list of beers that you must indulge in.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Aroma is coffee, dark chocolate, roasted grain, espresso beans, a little bit of fruit. Mouthfeel is slick, chewy, coats the tongue, with good carbonation, good balance between medium-heavy body and medium carbonation. Taste is roasted grain up front, with coffee, vanilla, dark chocolate, cocoa, charred oak, and a dry finish. As it warms, wood flavor becomes more prevalent, as well as a little alcohol warmth, although not overpowering. Drinkability is high despite the 9% ABV because of how well it is hidden.

112,412,abankovich,4.25,"A pitch black liquid poured into my snifter with a great tan head that holds up very well and leaves behind great lacing down the sides of the glass. There is also some carbonation moving its way through the inky blackness that can be seen as bubbles on the side of the glass.  The aroma comes through as rich mocha, coffee, toffee, molasses and malt sweetness. All this is balanced very well and smells delicious.  There is an intense bitterness followed by a mild alcohol burn when I take my first swigs. As the beer gets to a better temperature the rich mocha is noticeable with a lingering roasted coffee bitterness on the back end. The molasses notes and a good hop presence are also within the folds of this beer's character profile.  This mouthfeel is, of course, full-bodied and it's also very rich and creamy with a good play on the tongue thanks to the carbonation and mild alcohol burn. The 9% ABV makes it hard to have too many of these but at least it's only a 12oz bottle.

Mocha seems to be the best explanation. Loads of bittersweet chocolate, Dark Roasted coffee with a semi sweet kind of finish. Mouthfeel is quite creamy, leaving a great balance of sweetness & bitterness all around. Drinkability is also quite nice. At 9% I could definitly not pound these, but drinking 2 of these consecutively wouldn't be a problem. IMO this a widely available world class beer that can certainly run with the big boys within it's category, a must try for anyone who enjoys a super high quality RIS.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,GeoffM,4.37,"Appearance - Pretty standard stout coloring and head; beautiful opaque, inky black, impossible to see through, head is tan and rocky, moderately sized. Head diminishes a little faster than I'd like or would have expected, but the lacing is good.  Smell - Malty. Very very malty. Chocolate, coffee, something remotely chalky (for lack of a better word) but not unpleasantly so.  Taste - Wow. Seductively smooth. Moderately bitter with an excellent, and I mean excellent, finish. This is such a pleasant beer, wonderful mouthfeel. I sip it because I want to savor it, not because it's too bitter; in other words, quite drinkable. Malts are apparent, to say the least. Just awesome.  Overall - The only other Imperial Stout I've had was Yeti's Imperial Stout from Great Divide Brewing Company (another favorite around here, apparently), and this one is so much more approachable and drinkable.

I felt like I discovered something new each sip I took.  M: This was my favorite part. I buried the majority of my face in the head and took a good draw. It was thick, full and smooth.

112,412,BeerlyHuman,4.55,Poured from bottle to pint glass. BLACK! Perfect example of this style. One of the best! A must drink for the stout lover!! Wonderful nose appeal and equally as pleasant on the palate. Nice coffee chocolate flavors you would expect. Smooth upfront. Don't drink a dozen!!! Nice sipper!! Awesome brew!!!,North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,barleywinefiend,4.25,"This put the stout in stout. WOW!!! Very black beer with a nice, dark brown head that left nice lacing on the sides of the glass. Smelled mostly of coffee and dark malts. Taste started with strong coffee with a bit of alcohol, followed by lots of hop bitterness. The mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy. This is a very good, strong, sipping beer. A few of these and you will be wrecked so watch out.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Beer-Zombie,4.05,"this brew pours up black with a decent little light brown head. pretty decent lacing. the nose is sweet roasty malts, subtle coffee, hints of dark chocolate, a nice aroma but pretty much the average Imp Stout smell. Nothing too insane. the thing that I like about Rasputin is the grainy rough texture it has. This is truly a man's Stout that will easily put hair on your chest even if you're a woman. The taste is the same as the nose except it also has a little bit of an alcohol note and a good spicy hop balance. Both the alcohol notes and the hops give this beer a nice lil kick. Medium to full bodied, high spritzy carbo. A nice rough Stout...",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,CHSLBrew,4.3,"Poured into an imperial pint glass.  A-An attractive deep black and opaque beer with a deep brown head rising above. Head dissipated quickly into a thin layer of bubble on top. This beer appears to coat the sides of the glass when swirled, indicative of it's thickness.  S-Strongly of chocolate and roasty malts, with some dark fruitiness. No appreciable hop aromas.  T-Starts with a ver chocolatey and roasted malt oriented flavor, followed by esters and a very present bitterness. Some of this assertive bitter could be due to some astringency from roasted malts.  M-Low-moderate carbonation, appropriate to style, with a chewy, heavy mouthfeel (again, indicated by the coating of the sides of the glass). Alcohol warmth noticeable at the end of the taste.  D-Drinkable, in that it's a good beer, and it makes me want to have another one. Of course, being a little heavier could get in the way of enjoying too many in a sitting, but this is a very enjoyable beer to sip on during a cold winter evening.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Shumista,4.04,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into my snifter.  A- Old Rasputin pours a thick, syrupy, pitch black color with a 1 inch tan head. Huge amounts of lacing stick to the sides of the glass as the beer is drank. S- Not as good as I was expecting. Vanilla, coffee, and chocolate are all there, but not as strong as I expected. There is an odd almost metallic smell as well. T- The taste makes up for the slightly off aroma. Very sweet, lots of chocolate, coffee and roasted malts. The aftertaste is sweet and a touch bitter. M- Thick, creamy and good carbonation. I don't really notice the high ABV except for a slight warming in the back of the throat. D- I don't think I would ever drink more than two RIS's and this is no exception. It may be slightly more drinkable than other RIS's if I had to rank it though.  Overall, a great beer that I will certainly buy again the next time I am looking for a sipper, especially with the coming of the cold weather.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,RJUGA03,4.28,"I had the beer on tap at Brixie's bar in Brookfield,IL. (The bar turned me into a craft brew snobb, but that's for another date.) I found the beer to be black in appearence with a typical crawling stout head. On the initial sip I noticed a bitter hard alcoholish stout/ malty beginning iwth a choclatey milkshake like robust finish (hoppy).

T- very chocolate-y with a bitter coffe after taste, mild smokiness, definitly 9% ABV  M- creamy and thick, with a slight carbonation bite.  D- very good, need to pair this with a meal probably something fatty instead of drinking by itself. Very impressed with this brew. I will look for it again.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,beckje01,3.12,"This is my second review of Old Rasputin this time on nitro.  A- Black with a very very creamy head.  S- Ok something just isn't quite correct for the style, maybe the nitro.  T- Malty yet light, some hops which goes well. Overall a good taste for a RIS.  M- Super smooth but its nitro so can't mess that up.  D- Ok on drinkable its overall just an ok RIS much better on nitro then other version so make sure to try it if you get the chance.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,ibbjamin,3.42,"Paid $7.99 for a 4 pack of 12 oz. bottles from BevMo in San Jose, CA. Poured one of the bottles into a snifter.  Quarter inch tan head. Somewhat fizzy, but does not seem too carbonated. The beer is black with minimal head retention. Some lacing.  Alcohol and a complex malt blend in the nose. Roasty and some chocolate.  Taste is of nicely roasted malts. Not as complex as the nose.  Mouth is more carbonated than I expected. Pleasant. Medium body and a bit thinner for a RIS.  A bit overrated IMO. There are better RISs than this.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Rum raison, roasted dry malt. Definitely baking chocolate.  Smooth. Extremely well balanced with the carbonation.  Well. Something could be better here, not exactly sure what it is, but there is something missing. Maybe a bit more malt.  Would love to find this on draft.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,chuckd123,4.2,"Have had this on tap and in bottles several times now, and it never disappoints. As expected, it pours a deep, thick black-as-night black color, with a dark brown 1/2 finger head. Laces up somewhat and lasts.  The smell has hints of coffee, maybe even toffee, some slight chocolate, malt and alcohol. As with most imperial stouts, the alcohol is right there for you, no hiding it in this thing.  The taste has to be textbook spot on for the style. You notice a coffee-ish flavor blended nicely with the malt right off, and the alcohol nose isn't far behind.  Mouthfeel is excellent, no sting from the alcohol, just a very (very) smooth, somewhat creamy feel to it. Excellent.  I've not found any imperial stouts I would call sessionable, and this is no exception. A tad on the heavy side, and the alcohol catches up to you pretty fast. I'd recommend spending the better part of 45mins to an hour on each of these, and after 2 you'll probably want to call it quits.  Excellent example of the style, well done North Coast.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,katan,3.95,"12 oz undated bottle  A - Pours dark as night with a strong mocha colored head. Very well retained.  S - Reminds me of chocolate and caramel notes - backed up with some roasted barley sweetness.  T - Very chocolately throughout the flavor profile. Mid-stream is a well defined sweetness. Ends with a lingering after taste of something like smoke. Aftertaste is dominated by bitterness.  M - Creamy and thick - coats the mouth completely. The after taste strength would indicate that some of the bitter balance has left a strong hop oil base.  D - While the flavors are certainly pleasing, this beer is certainly a sipper. Not high on the ABV bell curve for the RIS category, it still is potent enough to be more of a loaner night beer.  Fantastic beer - one I guess I'll have to do more importing of to Iowa over the winter.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,ncvbc,3.65,"Dark pour, close to black with ruby brown hues around the edges. Somewhat frothy tan head, not too dense and settles to a ring. Good smell of molasses, raisin, light roast and ash, and chocolate with a cocoa. Taste is pretty good. Much of what was noted in the nose but with a bit much bitterness. A bit heavy on the booze, especially for a lighter RIS. Mouth is more toward medium than full, not thin but the bitterness keeps it from being to creamy. One isn't a problem but two or more might be a task.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Chelsea1905,3.9,"Poued very dark, was in a dark pub when I tried it, but almost no light breaking through this dark mahogany beauty. Think white-brown head, that left substantial lacing  Smelled like a stout, chocolate and malts, but a sliht hoppy-citrus note in there too  Hops and floral mixture, which was really suprising, then the malt and chocolate hit after.  Heavy, full meal-like mouthfeel.  Drank a couple and that was good enough. A little too heavy for a session beer, but nice for just a couple",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,BretSikkink,3.98,"Mahogany colored with highlights, tight head doesn't budge in the snifter glass. Good lacing, but it's gone by the time this big beer is.  Aromas of chocolate, slightly roasted but not as dark as some. Tiny whiff of coffee. On the tongue it's very hoppy and bitter while also bringing loads of chocolate sweetness.  Somewhat chewy and full, but not quite the best - very little carbonation, which is fine, but it might help cleanse the palate of the harsher aspects of the brew.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,allergictomacros,4.08,"A - Pitch black. Dense brown head of foam and good lacing.  S - Dark, roasty aromas predominate. Molasses, dark frut and berries, some graininess and metal.  T - Very wine like and fruity with roasted character as well. Mixed berries, coffee. Not overly sweet and alcohol is well hidden.  M - Carbonation is sharp, which seems to lighten the body somewhat.  D - Pretty good, but not my favorite. Could be a victim of raised expectations. Feels light for a RIS and flavour is solid but not mindblowing.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,gford217,4.18,"This is one of the beers that got me started on craft beer and just getting around to reviewing it. Bottle poured into a snifter.  Pours black as night with only a hint of light penetrating the edges leaving a mahogany hue. The huge tan head sits atop the blackness for a long, long while leaving big sheets of lacing.  The aroma is of massive dark roasted malts, bakers chocolate and licorice. There is also a pretty sizable hop kick in the nose up front as well, mainly citrus.  The taste also starts with an interesting citrus hop kick but it quickly gives way to the bittersweet chocolate and dark roasted malts. There is a hint of coffee as well as dark fruits.  The mouthfeel is sticky and lingers for ages, just coating the mouth with the massive malt and hop battle on the palate.  This is a great example of an RIS and old standby. Highly recommended.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,vrazionale,4.45,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a snifter.  A - Pours thickly, with a slight head that quickly dissipates. The brew's color is nearly opague, like a cup of dark-roasted coffee.  S - Again, dark-roasted coffee, and a pleasantly bitter dark chocolate. Only a very slight hint of smokiness.  T - Not to keep harping the same point, but the taste is very similar to the pleasure of eating chocolate with a cup of good coffee. This gave me an idea - I tried a piece of (baking) bittersweet chocolate that was lying around the house with this brew - I thought the beer interacted very well with the chocolate. But I digress. Without chocolate, there is only a slight acidity on the finish, with hardly any alcohol taste.  M - A bit unsatisfying, but creamy and smooth. The finish was a little less lingering that I might like, but overall, an outstanding Russian Imperial Stout. Surprisingly high in carbonation, but I found that this made the texture a little more complex and interesting.  D - An outstanding, enjoyable brew. Take your time with this one. What the hell, I might as well use the coffee analogy once more: drink this beer as you would a cup of coffee on a lazy morning.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,n00tz,4.43,"A- Friggin' Dark thick body with a tight brown foamy head. Undetectable carbonation.  S - Bitter coffee and a sharp fruity scent like a champagne. Slight smoke.  T - Dark roasted coffee bitterness, creamy hot chocolatey, slight hint of the alcohol with some mellow fruitiness like dried figs.  M - Thick body, I have to convince those that I've shared with that they are not drinking oil. Smooth going down, palate clears but the mouth stays coated like a light syrup. Fantastic stout.  D - MORE NOW.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,JBogan,4.02,"Very dark with a small tan creamy head which disappeared soon after and left little lacing.  Smelled of chocolate and coffee, along with a hint of alcohol.  Tasted as it smelled, although the alcohol was a bit more pronounced, especially as it warmed up. Nicely balanced.  Very smooth mouthfeel, slippery and creamy. Full bodied. You know this one is in your mouth. Very nice.  This is an excellent brew for this time of year, but probably a bit too much for the warmer months (especially here in Vegas). A couple of these will make you feel all warm and toasty inside.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,beerbart,4.85,"This is, to me, a really delicious beer. I've been lovin' the dark ones, porters and stouts, a lot. And this one tops the list at present.  It's deep dark and serious. It makes cheese, caramels, chocolate, even pie, taste better. It's like taking a swim in a pool of warm molasses, watching your favorite horror movie, laughing at funereal humor, dancing with your best friend. 'Cause you can. 'Cause it's good to do.

S - Espresso and chocolate are the 1st things to mind. Roasty caramel sweetness. Epitome of 'mouth watering'.  T - Rich roasted coffee and caramel malts. Alcohol in the nose on the finish. Dark chocolate is picked up on the 2nd pull. Excellent.  M - Very complex and big bodied with that head cushioning each sip.  D - Is there a better brew for the winter? I doubt it.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,DoctorDog,3.13,"Presentation: 12oz. bottle into an over sized wine glass. No freshness or bottling date indicated, which I presume is fairly inconsequential.  A- Deep brown/black in appearance. Pours with a bare minimum off-white head, which fades quickly, leaving a thin ring. Minimal lacing.  S- Alcohol, coffee, and vague hints molasses, though taken as a whole, all are fairly muted. After ~1/2 an hour, molasses odor become more prominent.  T- Crisp as it hits, but then quickly followed by alcohol and burnt/hoppy bitterness. Alcohol hit and bitters mellow as it warms, and the essence of coffee flavors become more present and pleasant.  M- Medium/high carbonation. Fairly smooth.  D- Moderate. In my book, this is a ""one glass slow-sipper"" of a beer.  Future outlook: Possible that I would pick this up again for rare-occasion sipping, though not something that would rank prominently for regular imbibing.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

A: Pours an opaque ebony color with a two-finger, caramel-colored head that fades to a thin rim of foam. Great lacing.  S: Chocolate malt, coffee, and a whiff of alcohol. A hint of wet wool. (That's a first.)  T: Roasted malts, semi-sweet chocolate and coffee. Bittering hops in the middle. Notes of malted milk balls and blackstrap molasses. Alcohol is well-concealed. Finishes with a snap of licorice.  M: Medium-bodied, smooth and creamy. Generous carbonation on the tongue.

112,412,Dalem,4.23,"This is dark one. Almost black in color and just a sliver of light getting through. Half inch head that faded fairly quick but leaving slight cap when done and some spotty lacing that lasted all the way through the glass. A creamy, malty chocolate aroma with a touch of something that reminded me of hazelnuts and liquorice on the nose. The complex and pleasing scent alone had a very warming effect and made looking forward to the taste even more..and damn what a taste it is! A huge & flavorful dark roasted coffee taste up front followed by a tasty warm malt flavor. The finish is an interesting contrast in the complexities with a dry, hoppy bitterness and the liquorice nuances coming out. As it warms a bit in the glass even more of these little details come out making this a great one to sip on as the days get colder and the wind howls louder. Though the brew itself has a bit more of a carbonation texture than in other stouts I usually go for, which makes it a little less ""oily"" feeling I guess, there is still a nice creamy and full body to it.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,AustinBeerLvr,4.13,"Poured a 12 ounce bottle into a brandy snifter glass. No freshness date on the bottle.  This brew pours a nice big, creamy head, with a very deep black color. Nose is an interesting blend of roasted malt hints with chocolate and a fair amount of alcohol.  The sip starts off with a heavy dose of roasted, chocolate malt flavors that quickly blend with a hit of alcohol and hop bite. This brew's potency actually hits the nasal cavity almost like a good glass of red wine, but despite the strong alcohol presence, keeps everything well in balance. Hint of alcohol and hope bitterness round everything out at the end. The mouthfeel of this big brew is truly outstanding. Creamy, yet not too heavy, full malt body, but not overdone. Without a doubt, this beer has one of the best balanced mouthfeels of any brew I have ever had.  At a whopping 9% ABV, this is no doubt a sipping brew. Best enjoyed in a snifter glass, at cellar temp, with slow, thoughtful sips. I bought a single bottle of this to give it a try, and I am very glad I did. For the cold months approaching, I plan to buy more, as this is one of the ultimate winter splurges out there.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Has a brownish two-finger head which lasts a long time (as in several minutes) and leaves some good lacing.  Smell: This beer smells of chocolate and molasses, and has a very sweet scent. Heavy on the malt, with a little bit of caramel in there. Has a slight bitterness in the undertone.  Taste: COFFEE. Seriously, the first thing that comes to mind is the taste of coffee. Bitter at first, then gets a little sweeter. Molasses, caramel, and toasted malts are in there. Very dark, rich, and creamy.  Mouthfeel: Thick and full, like heavy cream. Not acidic or overly carbonated. The aftertaste is very similar to coffee and cream, with no sugar.  Drinkability: This is a delicious Russian Imperial Stout, and an ideal sipper. It's also great with a snack, or while playing a game of darts or pool. If you like this kind of beer, especially one with a heavy coffee taste, check this one out. Just remember there's no caffeine in it.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

A caramel colored head forms reaching ~3/4 inch before receding to a thin lace around the edge of the glass. The smell is unique with some dark chocolate and coffee notes and a sweetened alcohol scent, that blends fairly well with the malt and other scents. The taste is again noted to have a coffee component mixed with the bitterness of dark chocolate, which lingers on the palate nicely. The alcohol is definitely present in the mouthfeel, which is a thick and pleasantly warming mix. There is a reasonable level of carbonation.

Taste/Mouthfeel: The taste is very chocolately and warming, with a hit of cream and bitter coffee beans. The alcohol is very present with a heavy finish in the aftertaste and back of the throat.

I get no hint of alcohol at this point - maybe some will poke out as it warms. The taste mirrors the smell with plenty of chocolate and coffee followed by a long, bitter finish that invites you back for more. The beer is very full bodied and somewhat sweet - making it more of a sipper than a quaffer. My only other RIS reference point is Sprecher's, which I find unbalanced and plodding on the palate.

Incredibly smooth when you first sip it, the roasted and chocolate malts really kick in. Definitely a sipper.

112,412,LumpyGuitar,4.03,"Poured a solid black. At first there appeared to be no head, but after a few seconds head formed, which I found both interesting and awesome. Head has good retention at a fingers width, is nut brown in color, and is thick and foamy.  Smell is strong with roasted malt, oatmeal, chocolate and molasses.  Taste is well built, starting with the bittersweet from the roasted malt. The flavor mellows into a roasted nut with chocolate hints, and as the beer warms the flavors become a bit more harsh.  Mouthfeel is heavy bodied with a very thick and syrupy feel. As I poured the last sip the beer hung onto the bottle like it didn't want to let go.  Drinkability is good. This is a great stout, no wonder its won so many medals. Goes down pretty easy too, considering the ABV.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,popery,4.4,"This beer was one of my early favorites after I started going online to look at reviews for beer. It's a dark, dark brown and has a head that's a bit lighter than ideal, but it still looks good. The nose is full of chocolate with some coffee, malt and other complexity. Chocolate comes through strongly in the flavor. There's really a lot going on, more than I'm able to describe accurately, anyway. There is some sweetness, a lot of malt, some coffee and some hoppiness. It's a good RIS, which puts it beyond my relatively undeveloped descriptive capabilities. The mouthfeel is fairly smooth with good carbonation. The drinkability is high, and the beer has a nice dry finish to complement its complex flavors. It's a really great stout with a lot going on and a smooth feel.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,philipquarles,4.1,"Pours black with a dark tan head that has decent retention. When it does disappear it leaves very nice lacing.  Smells of strong roasted malt, sugars, and dark fruit esters. Carries on into the taste, but much more boldly. The roasted malt is predominate, along with a bit of balancing bitterness. The fruits are nearly gone, though there's a hint of chocolate.  Mouthfeel is quite nice. Thick, with a creamy head; pretty much what one would expect of a stout.  Overall a very nice RIS. Not exactly terribly drinkable, but that's just in the nature of the style.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,lacqueredmouse,4.18,"Pours a very, very deep and dark black, with just flashes of blood-red hints at the very edges. Head is a solid, crusty cap of coffee-crema brown. Tiny streams of minuscule bubbles float up at the edges. Lacing is exceptional. An excellent looking beer.  Dark, smoky characteristics on the nose. Dusty dark chocolate, roasted grains, barnyard, even a light meaty character. It's not overly powerful, but it is dark and pleasant.  But wow, the taste is where it packs a punch. Light roasted bitterness first up, mellowing to a chocolate-coffee sweetness and a lingering chalky dryness, but still toasty and warm. The alcohol is exceptionally well hidden, leaving just that residual heat on the palate. Long and drawn out on the palate, lots of complexity but all on a hearty and solid base. Mouthfeel feels just slightly too light to me, for such a heavy-flavoured beer, I was expecting something a bit smoother and creamier on the feel.  But this is a very tasty, and very robust beer. Lots of character, lots of flavour - too heavy for more than one in a sitting, but worth waiting around for the occasional sip.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,ATLbeerDog,4.33,"Poured jet back with a small caramel colored head from a 1/6-barrel keg. Smells of beautiful deep roasted coffee, chocolate, and deep roasted malts. First sip is sweet chocolate and a ton of coffee - lovely and delicious. Complex and somewhat creamy, its backbone is not nearly as heavy or complex as a DL but it is creamy enough to make Old Rasputin one fine World Class RIS.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Mdog,4.18,"Appearance: Black, unexpectedly huge head.  Smell: Rich dark chocolate.  Taste: Rich, semi-sweet dark chocolate dominates. A little touch of coffee. Enough bitterness to give some more character.  Mouthfeel: Thick stuff.  Drinkability: Usually the lowest priced Imperial Stout in the store means it can be purchased more often and therefore, drank more often.  Four packs of this were on sale for $6.99 so I picked one up. A high quality brew in a relatively inexpensive package. Not my favorite IS but pretty tasty too.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,bearcamp,4.33,"They had this on tap @ the local flying saucer.  Wow! Wow! Wow! This is a great imperial stout. I was planning on getting a different beer but got another glass of Old Rasputin. Hopefully, I can find this in a bottle somewhere..  Appearance: About a 2 inch coca tinted head. Served in a unique glass that I don't know but it was between a pint and a snifter. Almost a wide wind glass.  Smell: Strong dark malt and a hint of coffee, but this had hops. i'm a hop head so this was a good thing  Taste. Smooth, nitro carbonated very flavorful. Love the hop taste of this beer.  Mouth feel. Very thick, probably because it was on tap. Like a hoppy thicker Guinness.  Drink ability: Do you have to ask? I ordered 3 of them that night. I wanted to try other brews but this one was so good I had to have more.  This is a great beer. Great example of an imperial IPA. Will definitely try more of this style in the future. Best non-Guinness stout I've had",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,kylephillips,4.02,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle.  Creamy looking head, tannish in color. Good head retention. Lacing sticks to side of glass. Beer is very dark brown, almost solid black, cannot see through it.  Smell is thick with chocolate flavors. Smells like it would be a very sweet drink.  Excellent mouth feel, with a decent amount of carbonation that sort of bites the tongue.  Initial taste is very sweet but immediately becomes bitter as you swallow. Finishes with an excellent roasty flavor that stays on your tongue. Almost has a salty taste that lingers.  Drinkability is good considering the finish leaves you wanting another sip for the initial sweetness.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,100floods,4.41,"I am now fortunate enough to appreciate any kind of stout. If you asked me a year ago what I thought about the genre, I would have said, ""ouch."" Now my attitude has changed to ""BRING IT ON!!!!""  I have had this beer a few times and never appreciated its wonders. This beer embodies all the characteristics I've been looking for in a Russian Imperial Stout.  I poured the 12oz bottle into short, stalky tulip glass and immediately the contents yielded a pitch black liquid with a rugged gold foam that resembles the gold colored lining on the label.  There is a subtle alcohol nose, at first, but there wasn't enough for me to care about. What I was looking for was the body, and this beer has a full figured. This beer has a thick, roasted body with a heavy dose of espresso. Having spent some time drinking espresso, I was excited when I noticed that this beer resembles a smooth cup of espresso, it wasn't too bitter and left a pleasant oily feeling on my tounge afterwords.  This beer is great for the seasons to come: fall and winter. Have this one before you go to bed, for a great sleep. This beer comes in a four pack, and I recommend holding on to a few and see where the aging process takes it.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,kcillini77,4.12,"Wow - this is one tasty brew, and the price is not too bad either.  Pours deep black with a huge head into a Duvel tulip.  Smell is of coffee, maybe a little english toffee, cocoa nibs, and a bit of fusel alcohol.  Taste is roasted coffee, some cocoa powder, and maybe a little bourbon. Aftertaste is mostly coffee-like.  Alcohol is warming and apparent, and there is a lot of carbonation here, so the mouthfeel suffers a bit.  Overall, a great beer and a great value.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,DeepSix,4.39,"Poured into a pint glass. A half an inch initial brown head head. Lace is again brown along the glass.  Smell its quite strong, roasted malts, coffee, and some chocolate here. mmmm  Taste of the chocolate more pronounced in the taste then the smell, the coffee was pretty strong here too, roasted malts to a lesser degree then these two, with barely noticeable hop presence but given the style... The feel is thick and creamy, like a coffee, just minor carbonation, the alcohol is there as it goes down.  This a beast of a beer, the thickness and the texture coupled with the high ABV probably couldn't have too many of these in one sitting.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,abfraser,4.47,"A: Dark as the night, with a dark brown head. Nice cascading.  S: Coffee, roasted malts, chocolate  T: Serious hit of coffee and roasted malts. Almost tastes like an alcoholic espresso  M: Smooth and creamy. Not the faintest hint of too much alcohol given the 9% abv  D: Given the complexity, not one that I'd want more than one or two in one sitting.  An awesome Russian Imperial Stout. One of the best out there.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,seangroves,4.7,"Poured into a pint glass.  Appearance: Very dark, almost black in color. Poured with about an inch of an almost caramel head. Very carbonated and has a very inviting presence to it. Retains the head for a matter of minutes.  Smell: Very strong smell as soon as the bottle was opened and the beer was poured. When brought to the nose it is quite easy to smell the sweet aroma of the roasted/chocolate malts (smells as an almost balanced degree of chocolate malt v. roasted, with maybe a minor upper hand to roasted) with an almost citrous-type hoppiness to it.  Taste: Very smooth in tasting, goes down easily despite the high ABV of the beer; not a typical strong beer in the high degree of its smoothness. Very strong taste of the malts followed by the citrus of the hops. Obviously that it was brewed in Russian Imperial manner with a focus on your darker roasted malt but it also has a pleasant balance of hops to counter the increased use of malt in the beer. Malts are very well balanced with the chocolate prevailing paired with the taste of roasted malt. Very true to Russian Stout fashion with a surprising degree of hops used to balance the beer.  Mouthfeel: Feels like a very light, smooth beer. Easy on the palate but alive on your tongue with the malt/hop mix. Feels slightly over carbonated but with this beer the extra carbonation isn't overally out of place.  Drinkability: This beer is considerably easy to drink. This is a beer best suited for sipping. Especially on a cold night, this would be the beer to sit with and enjoy the evening. Very easy to drink another one, and as it warms it does add to the taste to a slight degree, given the style of the beer. I would highly recommend.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,erratic,4.43,"Thickest, darkest beer I've had...still hoping to try Darklord, though :) Creamy, mocha head.  Smells like coffee and chocolate. Really nice  Tastes great. Roasted malts, chocolate covered raisins, coffee and just a hint of celery. Yes, celery. Odd, but it works.  Chewy mouthfeel, smooth, low carbonation, slight astringency. The alcohol warms the throat.  High alcohol and strong flavors limit the drinkability a bit, but it tastes so damn fine, that I would keep drinking it if offered!

112,412,Natural510,4.38,"Pitch-black pour resembling ink; nice tan head which dissipates but leaves a decent coat of lace on the glass. Smells of roasted malts with a sweet milk-chocolate overtone. Flavor is heavy. The roasted malts coincide with a bitter cocoa flavor which leave a very dry aftertaste. A milky sweetness creeps through, as does a very subtle hop note. The flavors give an overall coffeelike quality as well. Very creamy, heavy but smooth. Drinks like an espresso...definitely a sipper. I can see why this is so popular; doesn't try to go too extreme in the RIS category, merely offers a finely-crafted, drinkable brew.

Poured a pitch black with a beautiful brown head that left fat lace rings with each sip.  Strong chocolate, roasted malt, espresso, and anise were pouring off this one.  Tastes were incredible and very blatant. Heavy chocolate and espresso bean followed by licorice and hop-like bitterness. Thick and chewy, this one is a sipper. Finishes with chocolate malt flavors and a nice alcohol warmth.  Old Ras has been one of my top fives for a while now and it was all the better being I hadn't had it in months.

There seems to be some coffee notes as well. I am not picking up a very big aroma on this one at all.  There is some bitterness up front which is quite noticeable. Definite hop bitterness with a combo of bitter coffee/chocolate. Roasted/burnt malt flavor is picked up easily.  Very creamy slightly warming alcohol on the back end.

Mouthfeel: Wow this is so smooth. Such a silky smooth feel for such a strong, roasty brew.  Drinkability: Well I'm not going to drink more than one because of the alcohol, but the smoothness allows this to go down easy.  Overall: I'm impressed by this Imperial Stout.

112,412,LoRezDave,4.49,"This is one of my favorite beers. Seriously. Even cross-style.  Pouring the 12oz bottle requires a little coaxing to get the head to appear, but once it starts watch out! It's thick, rocky, and golden-brown. Head retention is good and a lace lays tracks down the glass.  Appearance is pitch black - all available light is eagerly consumed by this beast. After it's poured allow it to warm up - should feel closer to room temp than fridge temp. It will really open up the flavors and aromas.  Once you dive in, notice the super-licorice on the nose and tons of rich malt. The taste is very heavy roasted-malt but kept in check by a slight hop prick. Slight booziness (but not unpleasant), overtones of espresso and licorice, undertones of caramel and a light pepper.  I once had this bad boy on hand-pump at the Map Room in Chicago.

Drew it into a snifter and watched the oily head build up and shrink to a layer that leaves a very wet and sporatic lacing on the glass.  The aromatics hint of coffee, chocolate and black licorice but not very strongly.  Taste is full blown chocolate malts with espresso and black licorice. Very well balanced and complex.  Mouthfeel lets the beer explode its flavors in your mouth and simply adds just another exciting part of the beer. Tends to lend itself to the carbonated side for this style.  Drinkability, for a 9% ABV beverage, is outstanding.

112,412,danny013,4.82,"12 oz. bottle poured into a 16 oz. English style tankard. Pours a deep black body with light hints of brown around the edges, topped with a thick 2-finger brown head. Head falls into the beer and leaves a nice .25"" cake over the beer for half the brew and thins out after. Great lacing.  Smell is mainly of a complex malt/chocolate balance, some sweet hints with a big dark chocolate aroma with some roasted grains thrown in. Hops are present, assertive to push through that malt base, somewhat citrusy, piney. Very nice and complex.  Taste is as big and complex as the aroma. Some slight astringency up front initially, gives way almost immediately to a big, dark chocolate malt base. Roasted grains push through, hops tagging along. Good mix of roasted grains and hop bitterness push the huge initial maltiness back and take control, revealing another facet of this brew. Hops are a mix of citrus and some gentle pine. After swallowing the beer a light, tingly carbonation is left on the tongue that brings through some pleasant roasted grains and more hop bitterness, along with a nice warming sensation from the alcohol. Alcoholic warmth left all down the throat. Dark chocolate flavors linger on the tongue. Wow.  Mouthfeel is great, thick, viscous body with a perfect carbonation level to move this thick beer around the palate.  Drinkability is great. A delicious, complex ale to sit and sip and pick out it's gentle nuances. Not something to drink more than 2 of. Perfect for cold evenings, I'm going to let a bottle or two of this rest until winter time here.  Overall, a fantastic, complex ale that will knock your socks off with it's aroma/flavors as well as it's ABV.

Medium full in body, low in carbonation. Smooth and creamy with nice chocolate and roasted notes and a good bitterness.

A strong alcohol finish helps clear the palate.  Yeah, this one is full bodied, and chewy. Very impressive.  Find a place in the rotation for this one. It lives up to the mysterious nature of it's namesake. Perhaps best with a sirloin, or a strong flavored roast.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,thekevlarkid,4.46,"Poured out of the bottle an opaque black through which no light would pass. Cascades into the glass too, damn! Voluminous, foamy, three finger head of brown bubbles displayed nice retention with very sticky bands of lacing like mocha garters all the way down my glass. Rich aromas of sweet malts, roasted malts, coffee and some alcohol. Flavors were also fearless, lots of freshly roasted coffee, roasted malt and a high hop bitterness. Some unsweetened chocolate appears as the brew warms and the 9% ALC becomes more apparent. Very smooth on the palate with a perfectly balanced malt/hop ratio and low carbonation helping to give this one a high drinkability. Bold and almost evil in character, this beer is everything a Russian Imperial should be and not for the faint of heart.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,PatronWizard,3.95,"Wife told everyone to bring me a unique beer for my birthday. This is one of the three BA Top 100s I scored. Lets do it...  Guess what....it's dark. Fairly black. Nice mocha head. Began to thin out.  Stout smell.  Well the flavor is more commanding than the smell. Not that the smell is bad, but the taste kicks it up a notch. Bam!It's actually a bit too cold right now so I'll let it warm. *Lets it warm* Bitter in a chocolaty way. Coffee of course, possibly some black licorice.  After warming for some time, the aroma filled out with some dark cherries and alcohol but the mouthfeel got even smoother.

The billowing beige/brown head hung around for a few minutes with some linear lacing around the glass.  S: Light alcoholic whiff at first. Overall this is a rich smelling brew with hints of coffee and chocolate.  T: The flavor here is also rich, the chocolate flavor is slightly bitter(i love bitter dark chocolate flavor). There is a light hop punch, could use more.  MF/D: Full bodied beer. Very very smooth and creamy. I would only have one of these but it is a delight.  I have had a lot of amazing russian imperial stouts over the last years and this one is closer to the top than the bottom.

112,412,Bananaman,4.6,"Wow! I really love this one. Pretty much in the same league as Brooklyn Black Chocolate. Got two more in my ""beer cellar"" and I have high hopes for them.  Almost Black/Red color with a nice beige head.  Smells amazing, full on raisins, hops, sweetness, fudge, vanilla and some rosted malts.  The taste is pretty similar to the smell, but is much more roasted and bitter tones in the taste than the smell. Medium palate, not thin - not thick.  Amazing beer! This is a so called ""must try"".",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,sstackho,3.6,"Four 12oz bottles for $9 from Bauer Wines in Boston. Pours black, with a good head. Very good lacing. Rich nose of malts and hops. First taste is strong and warm, but the main taste is hurt by what feels like too much alcohol, so it goes down hot - and I typically have no problem with big beers. Tangy flavour. Nice lingering hop and malt aftertaste. Overall, I'm not actually enjoying this one too much. I will let its brothers age.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,JRed,4.23,"Welcome to the darkest, most ominous beer ever made. Opaque color invites you to take a dive into this abyss and lose yourself in the black waters. Deep dark chocolate aroma with coffee notes. Dark chocolate lounges on the tongue with malty aftertaste that becomes even deeper and more intriguing than the initial flavor. Deep chocolate indulgence with 9% ABV that disguises itself as an ordinary stout.

Tons of dark coffee and chocolate in this one. I can tell the taste is going to be immaculate  T: Extremely rich and flavorful of dark coffee, cocoa, and some dark fruits as well. There is a noticeable hop bitterness in this that I absolutely love!

The aroma is thick and roasty with a hint of chocolate and dark fruits. Somewhat creamy as well.  Taste is very roasty with hints of chocolate, coffee and dark fruits. Smooth and creamy and it finishes with a decent amount of bitterness at the back of the throat.  Mouthfeel is bitterness followed by creamy chocolate. Very smooth. Does not overpower.  I think this is a very drinkable Imperial Stout. I was expecting it to be harsh because there's no way to tell how old it is. However, that isn't the case. I better pick up some more to age while it's still available. As for personal preferences, it does have that creaminess in the mouthfeel that I desire and a good balance of roasted malt and hops.

S- First off, I get a huge hopiness reminiscent of pine and pineapple. I also get a big dark chocolate, some vanilla, and some nice spiciness.  T- This beer starts of with a bitter dry chocolate and slight vanilla with a nice big hopiness of pine then moves into a nice dry chocolate and hoppy finish. Nice.  M- Carbonation is a bit more than low which makes me think it could be a bit less. I would love to see a thicker, smoother mouthfeel, but overall, this is good.  D- There is 9% in here somewhere. Pairs great with dessert or an chocolate. Definitely a great, widely available russian impy.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Kraken,3.93,"Reviewed from notes. Again, the internet is great, dont know how I lived without it. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a standard pint glass. FYI I love every North Coast product I have had so far. Pours an absolute Jet black, ebony, with 3 fingers of latte colored head. Head is thick and viscous, not much lacing but good head retention. Nose- The scent of this one is something special. Nose is thick, like you walked in a coffee roasting, coco packing, pine tar factory. Hops enice you to taste. Taste- Like a mouth full of coffee chocalte pine needles. But very smooth. Long bitter finish. Mouthfeel- Coats the mouth in a very pleasant way but not cloying, not as heavy as it looks. Again the finish wonderful. Drinkablity-Not as heavy as the color would indicate. But I think 2 wouild be more the enough. Alcohol is nicely hidden but noticable.

112,412,beachbum1975,4.01,"12 oz brown bottle poured for me at Fox and the Hound in Mason, OH. No freshness date.... I love the packaging, very noble and almost ominous.  An easy pour produced a nice, creamy, tan 2 finger head. Highly active, frothy bubbling on the head for a few minutes. Nice and sticky lacing remained through the glass. Color is black with the slightest dark brown and possibly ruby hues when put up into the light. Viscosity is high on this one - not a sludge bomb. Looks like a nice example of a Russian Imperial Stout.  Sniffing on this guy reveals a delightful blend of dark chocolates, coffee grinds, lactose creaminess and molasses.  The taste is what you'd expect after smelling it, no surprises. To summarize the taste, this is a richly flavored, heavily roasted coffee, roasted grains, bittersweet chocolates, a healthy dose of smoke and charcoal finishing with some crisp (non-floral) hops. Flavor is nice because it doesn't linger in my mouth forever. I got very little alcohol in the taste, as the prominent roasted flavors hid it well.  Mouthfeel is surprisingly light for the menacing color and creamy head of this beer. Very drinkable and enjoyable, but don't let the 9% ABV creep up and kick your ass.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,ShrLSU,4.47,A - Poured a syrupy black like used motor oil. Had a nice dark tan head which settled and left nice lacing and a thin foam layer on top.  Smell: Roasted & sweet caramel malts and coffee. A slight chocolate scent as well.  Taste: Bitter chocolate hit me first. Then the sweet malts kicked in followed by a slight hop bitterness. If finished with a nice coffee and bitter chocolate flavor.  Mouthfeel: Very full bodied and creamy. Definitely a sipper.  Drinkability: I'm glad we got this beer back in south Louisiana.

112,412,hooligan,4.35,"Pitch black beer with a burnt-coffee and milk head that settles to a wispy lace on top after a sip or two.  I can smell cherries, plums, and faint licorice. Not a lot of hop in the smell besides some astringency at the top end, but that could also be the alcohol.  Burnt toffee with a hint of cherry invades the palate with a faint overripe plum flavor towards the finish... which is cut by a very sharp, very crisp, but otherwise unknown hop. Quite a bit of warming alcohol throughout.  Rich and thick with a very slight, porter-like fizz at the back end.  One of my all time favorites.

T & M: Wow, my beer journey has led me to my first RIS and I knew this was the first one I wanted to try. I used to strongly dislike stouts and porters but my tastes have changed so much that I love this beer. Very smooth coffee tones up front but a nice amount of bitterness in the mouthfeel. I also agree with other reviewers in that there is some smokiness as well. I now see why RIS as a whole and especially Old Rasputin specifically are well regarded.

112,412,prsguitarsr4me,4.75,"One of my favorite RISs - easily ranks up there with brews like The Abyss, Peche Mortel, Goose Island, etc. It pours BLACK and it is a very heavy drinker. The taste is just about as good as it gets for me, as are the smell and look of the beer. Its got some chocolate, espresso, even some fruity undertones - the whole sip is just awesome. A bit more hoppy than other Imperial Stouts, but I love it -- very particular taste. Great with some chocolate.  Old Rasputin will always be especially special to me as it was not only the first craft beer I ever had, but also the first Imperial Stout I ever had, which is now my favorite style.

112,412,CrellMoset,3.88,"Bottle from Total Wine in Chantilly, VA. This bottle's been sitting in my (dark, cool) closet for a few months - poured into a Watou chalice.  Appearance: A deep, thick brownish-black beer - a few shades white of black - with a fast fading coffee-colored head, streaky, runny lacing.  Aroma: Chocolate and coffee, a little woody smoke, higher-weight alcohols. Fairly subdued.  Taste: Very interesting - lots of burnt and smoky notes here, more so than in most other RISs I've tried; a few faint lighter toasted notes (dark coffee, bitter chocolate), but the smoky notes really dominate this one. A earthy, grassy hoppiness abounds for the last half of the sip, jarringly so at first (I thought the bottle was infected!), but it grows on you a little. Slightly harsh alcohol in the finish.  Mouthfeel: Bigger bubbles than I'm used to in an RIS, but it's still largely uniform and therefore smooth. Mouth itself is thick and syrupy, creamy and velvety, but maybe a little thinner than many RISs.  Drinkability: Lower in abv% than other RISs, and pretty interesting. A well crafted beer, especially if you like the darker, more highly-toasted RISs.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Aroma is mostly malty with some hops; more than I would have expected in a russian imperial stout. It's roasty like coffee and slighty sweet smelling.  Flavor is awesome and just what a russian imperial stout should be. Lots of roasted/toasted malts, chocolate, and coffee. It's sweet at first but followed by a strong, dry, bitter finish.

112,412,PatrickJR,4.02,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into oversized snifter. I wasn't too impressed with the flavor directly out of the fridge, so I let this warm up to just under room temperature.  A - Completely opaque black. Even in the snifter, about a finger of brown head forms with pretty decent retention considering the high ABV. Lots of lace.  S - Overripe dark fruits with a hint of caramel. Deep chocolate aromas as well accented by smoke and wood. A whiff of alcohol hits with a suggestion of floral and earthy hops. There was actually a much less pronounced malt presence and a much stronger hop aroma while the brew was refrigerator temperature.  T - The caramel and chocolate wash over the palate at first with an undertone of fruit. Smoke/wood hits briefly, and then a wallop of rum-like alcohol takes hold, leading to a very earthy hop finish. The burnt flavor of the roasted malt along with the hops make for an intensely bitter finish.  M - Full to medium bodied, with moderate to low carbonation.  D - This is a big, intense brew, one certainly being enough.

Big nose of coffee, roasted malts, dark chocolate, and a hint of red fruits.  Taste is dark red fruits and bittersweet chocolate before some roasted malts, a hint of smoke, and coffee.

Drawn to the great name and label I was intrigued in the high alcohol content. Pours easily with a thin head. This beer is very aromatic and has a thick consistency. The flavor is wonderfully complex to say the least. I was very surprised to discover that the overall flavor hides the strong alcohol content really well. To date this is the best stout I have ever enjoyed. I Will definately keep a few of these in stock for my personal enjoyment. \Additional rating on 12-10-07 of (2) cellared bottles, exact age is uncertain. Opaque, rich brown pour with a 1"" thick lasting dark tan head and amazing lacing. Aromas of dark bitter chocolate, chilled coffee, and sharp hops. Alcohol is detectable to the nose. This beer is very full bodied and bitter-sweet. Thick and creamy with a light alcohol burn and smooth finish. Rich flavors of coffee, fudge, burnt and nutty malts.

112,412,Romulus141,4.31,"Appearance: Pours a dark, almost jet black color. No light can seem to pass through this brew. Even a delicate pour produces a large amount of head, which leaves behind heavy lacing. The head dissipates slowly. This is a really hearty looking stout.  Smell: Sweet malts are the predominant characteristic, as well as toasted coffee beans. Given the strong alcohol percentage, it is pleasing that there is no alcoholic smell to note. A quite pleasing aroma.  Taste: The flavor begins with a strong taste of malts and coffee, which gives way to a strong bite of hops. The finish is very dry, and quite forceful. This stout has a distinctive flavor, and is a good example of the style.  Mouthfeel: Full, rich, and carbonated, this has everything one could want from a stout. Pleasing.  Drinkability: The taste is great, and these are easy to drink over an evening. However, given the strength of this beer, one needs to be careful, as it is easy to have one too many.

It settled fairly quickly, but left behind a nice lacing.  Aroma- Lots of roasted grains with hints of dark chocolate and coffee. As expected, the aroma strengthens and becomes more complex as the glass warms.  Taste- Stong, bitter (but not unpleasant) roasted grains. Yum. Notes of coffee, bitter chocolate. Has a very dry finish.  Mouthfeel- Medium body (for the style, which means it's failry heavy). Good CO2 level. Really pushes the roasted notes and bittering hops to the fore-front. Coats the lips, mouth and throat well, so you get as long, lingering aftertaste. Really can't fault the Czar for loving this stuff.

Not much head maybe I poured it a little colder than it should of been. The thin head that is there is dark and creamy looking. Good amount of lacing.  Aroma is of slight coffee with a big chocolate back bone. Nice roasted malts come through in the end. You can smell the alcohol too.  That first sip and you can taste the alcohol. Once that settles down it's a strong toasted malt flavor that gives way to coffee. There's a hint of molases there for a second then it gets overtaken by the alcohol and roasted malts. This is a sipper for sure. The 9% ABV doesn't hide itself.  Mouthfeel is very nice, creamy with good carbonation.  Glad I got the chance to try this.

Coffee, bittersweet chocolate, creamy smooth malts, a hint of smoke & a beautiful, earthy hop finish. The pleasing carbonation teases the tongue. There's a hint of warmth in the swallow with a really clean, crisp finish.  The mouth isn't too heavy...but, it IS slick, full bodied & substantial. This is a MUST try if you like Russian Imperials. This is a BIG, explicit example of the style ~ in my opinion. My first try here. This is a future stand by as it's widely distributed & affordable. The 9% ABV limits the drinkability (for me), but warrants a frequent visit.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Zadok,3.81,"A-Poured almost a pitch black syrup. Had a half finger dark brown head for seconds after pouring. Minimal lacing as I consumed.  S-Rich malts and dark roasted coffee, alcohol squeezing through in the background. Mild Dark fruits.  T-As with the smell, deep roasted malts and dark coffee bean. Each drink is an enjoyable kick in the pants. Malty/hoppy finish. ABV comes into play pretty quickly. Baker's chocolate and dark fruit hang mildly in the distance.  M-Rich and creamy, double shot espresso cappuccino doesn't do it justice.  D-1 of these in a setting is more than enough, that being said, this is an explosion of the taste buds and should be consumed at a moderate rate.

112,412,sorryaboutbrooks,4.75,"Poured from bottle to glass. Smells choclatey. Rich black opaque appearance. Nice head that rings around the glass until the last sip. Nice bite at first but balanced with smooth mouthfeel. Nice chocolate malt aftertaste lingers. This beer is really put together well.

112,412,beerthulhu,4.5,"A: Poured a dark opaque coal color with a tightly bound dark beige head that was mostly lasting.  S: a huge fruity aroma starting things out before yielding to dark espresso beans, and bakers chocolate.  T: The flavor was fruity and dark with raspberry like tartness that was backed by a huge palate of dark roasted malt and citrus hopping. There was some charred woodiness, dark coffee beans and some rum raisin as well. The palate was huge, robust and full of complex flavors of dark malt and fruity sweetness leaving a pleasant aftertaste that lingers long after you swallow. At 55 F brings out strong coffee flavor. Great desert beer and one that should be sipped and savored for its huge complexity of dark fruit, coffee, and chocolate providing the standard per style for all others to follow.  M: dark and slightly astingent, bitter, creamy with a full body and thick viscostity.

Roasted malts dominate, but light scents of sweet fruit rest beneath.  Tastes of sharp coffee and bitter chocolate. I would rate this taste higher, but I don't like coffee.

Very well distributed, and priced competitively.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Some bitter hops, but lots of coffee, toast, and a little tar. But then WHAM- here comes the alcohol freight-train. The best way I can describe this one is a combination of a Black Russian and a beer.  For uniqueness, craft, and quality, this is dynamite. Not for someone who dabbles, though. This is a serious drink. Not the summer BBQ swiller. One or 2 is about all I would wnt to do per session.  Pricey.

It pours silky smooth straight from the bottle and is very brown/murky black in appearance. The lacing is very nice on the glass and also retains a nice, small head in between sips. A great looking beer.  Smell is of fine rich malts, chocolate and coffee. This stuff is certainly as natural as you can get.  Taste is awesome. This really tingles in the mouth for a few moments and all the chocolate coffee flavors really come alive. It's a nice blend of froth and flavor and certainly goes down nice. Very well done!  Mouthfeel is great. Very frothy, thick, full and pleasant. Flavors retain well after it has been swallowed. A certainly great stout!  Drinkability is beyond great.

112,412,BeachBumC,4.63,"I've been wanting to try the Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout since a friend told me of it. I finally found it at Hamilton's in San Diego.  Poured out of a bottle, nice clear black color with a thick 1 inch head.  It has a very roasted smell with hints of chocolate or bourbon.  Tasting it gave an instant zing on the tip of my tongue with a medium to thick body. Flavor was almost too roasted, almost burnt, but complemented well by the chocolate/espresso taste. The flavor was lasting and stayed well on the back of the tongue to the point that I had to have another sip.  Good thing I take quick notes because this beer didn't stay in the glass very long. I'll be having many more of these!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,TrevorGW,3.83,"Had this on tap at Deep Ellum in Allston, MA. Was very thankful they had it available, since I had been meaning to try it out.  Looks wonderful in the glass. Deep, deep brown with the thick tan head.  Up front is a lovely rich and creamy experience. Perfectly carbonated and with all the fantastic stout flavor that you can imagine. The creaminess swims around your mouth. The finish is quite abrupt and bitter. This is where the hops come in. At first it was very pleasant, but I then found myself desiring more malt flavor left in my mouth.  All in all, an amazing beer experience.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,KeefD,4.28,"The look reminds me of a quote from the movie ""GO"" - ""Bitch was black as night!"" Ok, maybe it was the darkest brown imaginable, but dark nonetheless. Developed a three finger head that spilled over the top of the glass with an amazing cascading effect that would make any Guinness lover proud. Lacing is thick and chunky to the bottom. Aroma of coffee, a bit of chocorama, and some nice hop bitter character which was a pleasant surprise coming to the nose of such a dark ale. Taste off the bat was of bitter roasted malt, followed up by some strong espresso, a bit of sweet burnt caramel, and finished off with a nice dry chocolate tinge. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. Full-bodied to say the least. Carbonation is excellent for such a thick brew.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

One finger creamy tan nitro head that sticks around forever.  Aroma is awesome: dark semi-sweet chocolate, coffee and even a subtle red grape character.  Texture is velvety smooth.  The flavor is substantial roasted dark malts, resulting in a profile similar to the nose: bittersweet chocolate, rich roasted coffee with a hint of cream and sugar and restrained but noticeable bitterness on the aftertaste.

Black as night with a luscious brown head - most unique head I've ever seen.  Roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, and slight alcohol all crawl up to the nose.  For such a strong beer, the taste is amazing, vanilla and chocolate with plenty of roastiness, yet not overpowering.  Feels like drinking a milkshake, so creamy and smooth, you want to savor it as long as possible.  Excellent beer to finish a meal, especially with a piece of dark chocolate.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,GatorBeerNerd,4.33,"A: Pours an opaque black with about a quarter inch frothy chocolate brown head. The head thins down to a small ring fairly quickly. The ring leaves a decent amount of lacing as the beer is consumed.  S: Molasses, coffee, and dark chocolate are the main aroma. The roasted malt taste also comes through as well. The aromas are normal for the style, but they mix better than some of its competitors.  T: All the items that added to the aroma mix just as well in the taste. Dark roasted malts, coffee, dark chocolate, and a hint of molasses mix perfectly to form an extremely tasty brew. The initial taste is slightly bitter with the coffee and chocolate being the most pronounced. They are balanced well with the malts. The finish leaves a slick coating in the mouth but its not as syrupy as others in the style.  M: It is a very full bodied brew. There is very little in mouth carbonation. The finish is cleaner than most of the ones in the style.  D: The cleaner finish makes this one very drinkable for a RIS.

Aroma is chocolate, some dried fruit, coffee, caramel, perhaps some smoked wood, hops, and then alcohol towards the end.  Flavor is dominantly coffee, with dark chocolate, and smoked wood flavor coming on the finish along with a bit of hops that may or may not be citrusy.  Mouthfeel is not like some Imperial Stouts, it's less syrupy. Still full, but not quite as good a feel as some others. Despite that fact, it actually makes it a bit more drinkable. Finishes dry.  Great beer. I love the strong coffee presence in the flavor and the other subtleties that come along with it. Unlike many other Imperial Stouts, I can drink a couple of these. It's usually pretty cheap too.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

It has a giant aroma of roast and chocolate. Some coffee and alcohol are also noticable.  In the taste there is a lot more coffee than I had thought from the aroma. The roast also takes a front seat, while the sweet chocolate nose is lost in the taste. There is also some strong hop bitterness to it. The alcohol begins to come through on the end of it, and it has an extremely dry finish. The flavors really do not quite blend together as nicely as they should, but it is still excellent.

A good balance between the roasted malt and alcohol smell. T- Although you can taste the strong roasted maltiness of this beer, a subtle bitterness of hops does squeeze its way through. The warm burn of alcohol follows this flavor. M- Very full bodied, but not syrupy. Outstanding!  D- A very good beer and very drinkable.

Very potent starts spanish espresso strong coffee with a definate burst of alcohol. Good carbonation tingles the throat. Background notes of very bitter chocolate. Bitterness lingers a bit.

It looks so inviting, so perfect. As the head slowly fades it leaves very thick lacing on the side of the glass.  Smells of strong dark malty goodness, citrusy bitter west coast hops and fresh brewed black as night coffee. Who would have ever thought those three distinct smells could come together and be so amazing. Along with those more intense smells comes a faint smell of alcohol. I love the smell of this beer.  Taste is chocolate milk, bitter citrusy hops, coffee and sweet cream. There is a nice smooth, silky mouthfeel with this beer with nice carbonation and an almost immediate warming sensation from the alcohol, which also provides a dryness in the finish.

I felt like I was diving into a rich cappuccino, chunky thick head, which dissipated nearly completely, but is still hanging around a little.  Smells like coffee. Has hints of chocolate in the aroma and taste. Roasted flavor. Nice medium carbonation. Good bitter aftertaste that isnt too strong and doesn't stick around for too long after.  Something I really like about this beer, is that it isn't too syrupy, it has a certain dryness while still being thick and deep. I like that.

A: Very, very black body (No light comes through at all) topped by a thick tan head. It laces decently at first, but then dies away. I was expecting more I guess. Maybe it is the glasses fault, but I thought the head would stick around for the whole beer.  S: There is a BIG smell to this glass of beer. I smelled hints of chocolate and coffee with a strong hop presence. That balance in the aroma between hop and roasted malt is a wonderful combination.  T: BIG smell is followed up by a BIG flavor. Chocolate and espresso notes are contrasted by a strong bitter hop flavor. There is a serious warming presence by the alcohol content. In the aftertaste is where you will find the subtle fruit esters.  M: Full-bodied, though not too much. There is a rich, chewy sensation brought on by the leftover sugars in this beer. Delicious.

Very rich brown head rises after hard pour and leaves plenty of lacing all the way to the last drop.  Nose Candy-Somewhat atypical of a stout smell with a rather big presence (for a stout IMO) of hops. Coffee and chocolate malts present and a good toasted grain flavor there as well.  Tongue Candy-Good and solid at the beginning. The coffee flavor hits you off the bat and sits well. At the end of the taste, an earthy flavor of hops comes out and fights against the malts. I wish there was a better balance here between hop and malt flavoring. Body seems a little light and a touch over-carbonated for my likes.

Taste is almost immediately coffee, with chocolate following, finished by an almost (raisin?) rum like followthrough. Alcohol warms in the finish. Very clean tasting beer but with lots of flavor. Hop bitterness is present but not in the fore; malt is the leading character in this play.  Medium to high carbonation and jam packed with flavor give the feeling of drinking a meal.

112,412,TroyS,4.01,"I was a bit shocked to find this Old Rasp Shout in the new beer and wine store locally; the new shop here in good ol' Blackfoot, Idaho mostly carries America's favorite lawn-mower brews and ""fine wines, "" but only carries a small percentage of truly envious brews to date. One benefit of this particular store is that it's in Blackfoot, Idaho, which is where I live now...Just kidding....kinda;) The benefit is that they charge a very fair price for the few great beers that they keep in stock. What more could you ask for, right?  This true Russian imperial stout is a great ""evening beer,"" and I say that not because it's such a ""warm beer,"" but because it's really light on the tongue yet memorable. This is a very nutty brew. This beer also carries a lot of coffee like robust flavor, but is lightened w/booze. I was taking the last sips of an Alaskan Ipa when I opened this bottle of Rasputin. Normally I'd pour it into a regular pint glass, dimpled mug, or a tulip, but after taking a whiff and a quick sip from the bottle, I decided to enjoy this one in a Chimay glass.  Nice and dark yet light in mouth feel. Chocolate + chocolate + more chocolate is super nice and roasty. Old Rasp Stout drinks like a cool cappichino. A bit heavy on the alcohol and light on the hopps, however a great....no....fantastic nutty Imperial Russian stout if you ask me;) I think that the only thing missing is a bit heavier mouth. When I say that it's ""light,"" what I'm really trying to say is that it's not very thick, but warm and thinner than I'd like to see from this Russian Imperial Stout. Delicious!

The flavor is vast, with a massive attack of bitter, earthy smoke and a huge, round undertone of sweetness.

112,412,kkipple,4.21,"Enjoyed on nitro-tap at the Flying Saucer in Columbia, SC.  Arrived in a fine looking branded Old Rasp pint glass, sporting a gorgeous 2 finger tall toffee-tan head. The head is amazingly dense and milkeshake like. It was fun to draw pictures in with a straw. But I digress. The beer is pretty darn dark, not *quite* black, and the contrast between light and dark in the glass is a thing of joy. Did I mention the sticky lace that runs down the glass as the beer goes? This is a beaut.  Tastes of heavy one-note roasted grains and rich coffee. Molasses, burnt raisins and a little astringency tickles the palate. The bitter hops are there but seem toned down from what I recall. Malt sweetness is complimentary and nicely balanced for me. Bittersweet and cunning, as it warms a few new flavors trickle out -- chocolate, alcohol, and a dry, almost chalky note.  On nitro-tap, the mouthfeel is hideously creamy. Smooth and very lightly carbonated, which makes it all the more easy to drink. It's a little thinner than I remember, but no matter, the big roasty finish with a hint of sweetness lingers and keeps me coming back for more.  Oh yeah, the nose. Grainy, roasty and boozy, this is simple and respectable for the style. Sweet, simple, strong, safe. It doesn't go for the jugular immediately, but the sheer drinkability of this means it may betray you later.  Old Rasputin on nitro is wickedly different from the bottle, and like the vile priest himself, sneaks up on you and gets under your skin. I had two pints before I knew what was happening.

It took all my good upbringing not to nick it. Appearance. Thick motor oil black with a tan head. Smell: Not much - - a bit malty. Taste: chocolate, roast malts. a little hop bitterness at the back of my palate. Mouthfeel: creamy, smooth, thick, silky. Drinkability. Not too boozy for an RIS.  Overall, this is a very nice RIS.

112,412,Portertime,4.22,"Such a good imperial, you can never go wrong with this beer. Had it the first time in Fort Myers. Srved it slighty chilled in my Samuel Smith pub glass. Poured a bittersweet choclate brown with a milk chocolate colored head that left some fine lacing. Aromas of roasted malts and baker's chocolate waft my nose. Taste has the alcohol edge in the finish with smokey, roasted chocolate malts in the front. A great after dinner quaff.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,davidchollar,4.73,"Ol' Raspy pours into my trusty Full Sail pint glass black as night with a very impressive big, chestnut head. The foam takes its sweet time settling, leaving this looking like an amazing, huge shot of dark-roast espresso. After the second and final pour, the head never goes away. This is a perfect-looking brew! Great lacing.  My very first impressions of the smell are of cherry and chocolate. But the massive maltiness hits me quickly, and there is definitely some caramel. I haven't had many RISs, but I believe the nose here is a bit subtle compared to the others I know. Still quite good though. Check that - after warming up for about 45 minutes out of the fridge, this thing has opened up enough to earn an extra half point.  The taste blew my mind. Jeez. This is exceptional. The hops were a pleasant surprise. What an amazing complexity! Thick and velvety smooth on the tongue this beer goes down way too easy for a 9%er. I could totally go for another right away! World Class.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,nasty15108,4.37,"Poured from a sinister looking 12oz. bottle into a mini snifter.  A - Poured black with a tanish brown head. The head quickly subsided and formed a spotty film and left scattered lacework.  S - Aroma of roasted malt and dark chocolate with ample alcohol in the finish.  T - Malty with a slight sweetness and a fair amount of smoke upfront followed by a bitter chocolatly finish. This stout is well balanced and delicious.  MF&D - Full bodied and sticky. A lip smacker after every sip. I think Rasputin has cast a spell on me. Pour some over vanilla ice cream, I did! Highly recommended.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,FtownThrowDown,3.03,"Pours near black on the pour with a nice half inch head. Smell is hops, roasted coffee and some dark malts. Taste is just way too much hops for my liking. Just not my style. I prefer my stouts on the unhoppy side. I appreciate it, but just not for me.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,mashedpotatoes,3.96,"Brutal, strong and complicated and I'm not talking about my ex-girlfriend. This beer it the real deal. I should preface my review by stating, this is by far my favorite label design ever. Just by looking at the artwork you know you've gotten yourself into something serious, kinda like a mix between, satanism/black magic/and an orgy.  All that being said, this is not my favorite stout, however, it is an extremely admirable stout. I don't even know where to begin. It's kinda like expensive artwork. You stand in awe of it yet you can just throw it around.  The appearance is jet black. Period. The smell is complicated; chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toffee, molasses, the whole nine yards. The smell is like a flower garden in hell. Figure it out. The taste is complex and mechanical like something from a Tim Burton movie but with a twinge of bitterness due to the high Abv%. Mouthfeel is thick and strong as it should be. Drinkability I'm going to have to say is not as high as other Stouts. Simply due to the sharpness and complexity, you just can't pound these down, you have to enjoy one or two of them and think about it for a while.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,tronester,4.48,"Pours pitch black into a pint glass. The head is medium sized and tan in color. Smells of toasted grain. Taste is rich, molasses, espresso, and chocolate. There is an earthy hop presence as well. The beer is quite well balanced with the malt sweetness, and the bitterness from the specialty malts and hops. Mouthfeel is rich, carbonation levels are a bit high though. The alcohol presence is minimal, this is quite a drinkable beer. One of the best tasting RIS's I have had, highly recommended.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,gunnerman,4.23,"Had this on nitro tap at the Yard House PBG, FL. Poures an amazing motor oil black with a foamy frothy nitro head that stays the entire time, Beatiful looking beer. The smell was pretty intense with ints of malty molasses prunes and also a bit of chocolate in the nose. Taste was even better, roasted malt character that goes down very smooth with hints of oak in there as well. This is a damn fine stout one of the best that I have ever tried and just amazing on Nitro tap.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,maximum12,4.3,"Picked up a single. Mistake!  Pours an amberish...no wait, that's something else. This is black. Dark. Cute little head on it. Smells very good, one of the first beers I've tried that I can actually smell a touch of chocolate, a shade of coffee.  Tastes fantastic! Smooth & creamy & malty, with a hint of the hop & coffee & chocolate all wending its way silkily down the back of the throat.  Feels like someone stroking the back of my throat with a velvet finger. Goes down nicely, clearly a sipper, but one I could sip for a while. I wonder how it will go with my corn dogs.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

As head dissipates, it leaves raindrop like holes scattered across the top.  Smell is of bittersweet chocolate, espresso, roasted malt, dark fruit, booze and a grapefruit hop presence.  Taste is primarily of bittersweet chocolate, espresso, and grapefruit hops. The alcohol is noticeable, but the big chocolate presence really cuts through the booze.  Full bodied and thick, however it has a fizzy quality.  Drinkability is par for the course for a RIS.  After looking at my empty glass, a large, sticky ring holds strong at the top of the glass and leaves some spider web like lacing.

Smell is of roasted malt with a coffee presence.  Taste is very creamy with a good roasted malt presence, chocolate is more prevalent than the smell indicated which adds a good deal of sweetness, the alcohol is well hidden unlike some RIS's that I've had, good level of carbonation that's not too low or too high to ruin any creamy smoothness, easily my go-to RIS now that it's available in Maine.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,bboven,4.4,"Deathly black with a huge initial head fading into tow full fingers. Thick, copiuos lacing.  Initial aroma is roast and coffee, then a swirl reveals dark fruit and a hint of alcohol.  Licorice, alcohol, raisin, and burnt toffee are the most prominent flavors. Big warming alcohol burst in the stomach is great.  Big alcohol dryness in the mouthfeel. The carbonation is a touch high, this should be almost flat. Great example, though.  Wonderful example, even if it's a very big example. Highly recommended.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,blakesell,4.78,"Poured from the nitro tap into a standard pint glass.  Appearance- Beer pours a solid jet black with a three finger head of solid tan that doesn't dissipate for a solid five minutes. Lacing clings to the sides of the glass and doesn't let up.  Smell- Roasted smoky malts and slight hops. Head is sticking in my moustache giving a bit more in the way of aroma. Milk chocolate and black patent malts very similar to a malted milk ball. Slight prune and fig, LOTS of black licorice.  Taste- Creamy, black licorice, black and milk chocolate, caramel, creamer, dark chocolate again, light vanillanin, chocolate milk, prunes, figs, brown sugar, light burnt malts, dark burnt malts, black patent, 350L+ torched malts.

112,412,Phillyduke,3.18,"A: Black as night with a two-finger head of mocha colored foam that settles into a thin coating on the surface of the beer. Fizzy lacing slides down the sides of the glass.  S: Alcohol sensation burns the nose. Dark roasted malts and chocolate round out a somewhat sour scent.  T: Burnt toast and dark malt with hints of chocolate and a nice hop bite. Alcohol is most definitely noticeable with each sip. Slightly hot and acidic. Bitter hop finish lingers and builds in the mouth over time.  M: A little on the thin side and slightly more carbonated than I would have liked.  D: I couldn't have more than one of these. Far too 'hot' to enjoy with the overwhelming sensation of alcohol. Definitely needs to mellow out a bit. Would like to revisit this beer after some down time, as it obviously has impressed many people. Not my favorite RIS by a longshot, though.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,HereticDivine,4.28,"This is, without a doubt, one of my favorite beers.  The appearance is awesome. Poured black, with an inch of tan/orange head.  Smelled of dark mocha. Has a very deep, fine dark chocolate undertone.  The taste is of thick dark chocolate, with a few dozen shots of expresso. As it warms up, the chocolate becomes more pronounced and much richer. This beer as a lot of alcohol, but you would never know that by taste alone.  Mouthfeel is great. Very thick and creamy.  Two of these would definitely be enough for one sitting. It's extremely heavy.  This beer is unreal. One of the best stouts I have ever had. It's something I will reserve for special occasions.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

A nice earthiness.  An excellent beer. Roasted malts dominate, with slight acidity. Heavy and creamy rather than light and bubbly. Like a meal in each beer. Looks great the whole way down, with rings left along the sides fo the glass.  Nice work. Probably better for winter months than spring and summer. And the acidity lowers its drinkability, because that gets a little old. But it's a very good stout.

112,412,SQNfan,3.53,"Black in color the beer poured a 1"" thick light brown head that dissipated slowly (and never completely). The nose had scents of roasted coffee, raisins and bitter chocolate. The palate was concentrated though light on its feet. While nice, similar to the nose, the palate was fairly simple. It did build nicely from the front palate into the midpalate and then lingered with a bitter chocolate flavor. Overall, it was very nice though rather simple.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Kendo,4.73,"Got it on-tap -- the nitro-tap -- at the Lionheart in Albany on 4/23/08.  A: Body is black -- dark black -- but with a hint of crimson on the edges when backlit. A thick, foamy 1.5-finger tan head rests on top with great staying power. As expected, it leaves behind sheets of lacing all the way down the glass.  S: First impression is roasted malt with a hint of chocolate. Also hints of anise and black licorice. Pleasant all around, but not terribly strong on the nose. I suspect the serving temperature may have had something to do with that (it was a little colder than I like my RIS's to be); as it warmed I got stronger chocolate in the aroma. . . .  T: First impression: roasted malt and coffee, with dark chocolate at the back of the mouth. Then I get some black licorice on the front sides of the tongue, a touch of alcohol warmth at the back end of the sip and a dry, coffee-like bitterness coating the back and roof of my mouth. As it warms it becomes more chocolatey.  M: Wow. Heavy in weight but creamy. The nitro-tap has turned this into one smoooth-drinking experience.  D: Excellent. Again, the addition of the nitro has smoothed out any rough edges, and for this fan of chocolatey flavors in my RIS's, I find it actually becomes easier to drink as it warms and the chocolate becomes more dominant. The pint was gone much too fast. . . .  Notes: Normally I don't bother adding a 2nd review of a beer just because I get it from a different source (i.e., on-tap vs. the bottle). But having this on the nitro tap made for a substantially different experience and I was glad I'd brought pen and paper along to memorialize that experience. Truly excellent -- on more than one occasion I took a sip, shook my head and said something like ""damn, that is one excellent beer."" Kudos to the Lionheart for getting this. . . .",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,everetends,4.35,"Purchased at a Whole Foods in Atlanta, Ga as a four pack of bottles. Must say that this is a fine beer.  Black as night and allows (what appears to be) no light to penetrate. The foam is almost brown, giving it a wonderful presentation.  Smell is of malt, chocolate, and alcohol.  Beautiful tastes of malt and chocolate, but has a fine taste of alcohol to give you an appreciation of its power. There are bitter undertones in the after taste, but this in no way hurts the beer.  As far as mouthfeel goes, it is a little heavy with the alcohol and does coat the mouth a bit but this is what you expect from an imperial stout.  This is not a good beer for meals in my opinion. It is going to overpower anything else that crosses your palate. It is a beer to be savored and appreciated. Fine after dinner beverage, but many can be conusmed and the price makes it just that much better.  Fine brew from a fine brewer.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,aerozeppl,4.56,Had this on nitro tap at the Lionheart in Albany. $3  A: Black. It was sunny outside and still no light got in. The nitro yielded two luscious fingers of off white head. Just about perfect.  S: Tons of chocolate and roasted malt. Little bit of sweetness and just enough of a hint of booze to let you know it is serious.  T: Wow. I have had this before but never on tap. The chocolate really pops out in front of everything else. The roast is there but not as prevelent as it is in the bottle.  M: Beyond sex. Super creamy. Oh man was this awesome.  D: Damn this was good. I am going to go back again this week for more. Yes I can stop whenever I want. Glad I got a small one though.

Well, I *know* why it's empty--same reason mine's empty--but I've yet to come across a bottle of beer that looks better empty than it does full.  I emptied mine into a Chimay glass, revealing a thick black brew with a tan head that dissipated to form what I could only describe as a nebula pattern, continually evolving due to a nucleus of constantly emerging bubbles.

Now I have developed a taste and can be more understanding of the style. So I went to browse the beer shelves and notice this one needed to be retried.  I like these stouts for their heads. They have big head on the pour but goes away fairly quickly, which is good. I really don't like heads for drinking only for show and appearance. The color is dark and robust. This one has a very sharp bite at first but disapates through the drink. Basically, the alcohol isn't hidden from the other ingredients. I like the style but not fond of the particular one. I do think it reflects the style's representation.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,gubbt,4.08,"Very dark brown, with a nice tan, creamy head.  Nose is highly roasted malts with dark, dark chocolate, a little black licorice and some piney hops.  Taste very much follows the nose. This one is about the roasty, black malts and hops. Rasputin is more on the dry/bitter side for the style, not much sweetness here. The most impressive thing is the finish: bitter, roasty, earthy, piney, and high cacao chocolate.  Nice full body, without too much carbonation.  A classic big stout that is thankfully available year round. Cheers!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Settles to a nice 1/4 inch and simply refuses to go away. Great lace. Roasted, malty aromas of coffee, chocolate, and a hint of caramel are present along with a bit of alcohol. In a way the taste is sweet and a bit milk like in taste and texture. The taste is also exactly like the smell, but even better! Toasted malts and coffee along with chocolate and hints of caramel, and light hints of some hop bitterness and alcohol . Excellent.

112,412,Ben4881,4.58,"Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout North Coast Brewing Co.  Appearance: This beer pours black as night. Absolutely no light passes through the full glass. A very thick, inviting, khaki-colored head erupts to the surface and sticks around awhile. This beer is alive! As it slowly recedes back to the surface, a beautiful lace pattern lingers on the entire surface of the glass. The lacing continues throughout the experience and a wealth of microscopic bubbles retains the 1/8 inch head down to the bottom of the glass.  Smell: My nose detects a strong, toasty, roasted aroma that is by no means overpowering. Slight chocolate and nut notes creep in with the subtle hint of coffee mixed with something sweet. A miniscule alcohol aroma dances in the background. For an imperial stout, the smell is a bull's eye.  Taste: The first mouthful is a delightful punch to the gut of delicious roasted coffee bitterness. The swallow elicits a dry finish that cleans up the bitterness and momentarily arouses a sweeter nutty flavor before the bitterness, this time more hops than roasted coffee, returns for a slight comeback. The slightly bitter hops flavored aftertaste lingers quietly at the back of the tongue, requesting another sip. The warm feeling of alcohol slides down the esophagus to the stomach.  Mouthfeel: On the palate, this stout lives up to its name. It is smooth as silk and rather thick. The notable carbonation keeps it from becoming chewy and lightens the load a bit. The carbonation does not overpower the feel, but there's enough to acknowledge its presence.  Drinkability: As an imperial stout, this beer's alcohol content is appropriately high. The glass seemed to disappear much quicker than I anticipated. I would definitely have another, but two would be my limit for one session. I would most certainly have one tomorrow. However, more than two in one sitting would toss me over the edge.

Overpowering burnt coffee taste for me. Also the beer was too thick and as I find with American stouts, too fizzy.

112,412,Kemmerlin,3.87,A: dark black and pours a huge foamy head that surprised me by how quick it grew and how long it stuck around I mean it is still there and it left awesome lacing down the glass.  S: Smells like a wet drunk dog. There is a faint tobacco scent but other than that it smells just like a wet drunk dog.  T: Burnt cigar and charcoal are the characteristics most defining in this brew which is a welcome relief from the typical chocolate and molasses flavors you get from a stout. The aftertaste is very earthy and still leaves a burnt wood taste in the mouth for a very long period of time. Basically this is a taste that keeps on giving.  M: At first the alcohol is very strong and almost over powering but it mellows out as you continue to consume. The flavors blend well with the mouth feel which is mostly gritty and earthy but good to swallow.  D: At first I thought it would be a little hard to swallow with the smell being so bad and the alcohol being very present but it really does mellow out and becomes a lot more drinkable as time goes on. I suggest watching out for the quick rising head and let it air out for about 5-10 minutes before you take your first sip.,North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

The alcohol is easily noticeable on the nose.  Its taste is extremely malty, packed full of powerful chocolate and coffee flavors, with hints of plum, smoke, and caramel. It is also has a good bit of hoppy bitterness for a nice balance.  It is extremely heavy and viscous, probably one of the thickest beers I have ever sampled and almost too much so, and as such it leaves a very long aftertaste on the palate.  It is a very smooth and drinkable beer; however, due to its thickness and high alcohol content, I do not think that I could drink very many of these in one sitting.

Grapefruit bitterness up front and continuing through to the end. Charcoal and coffee flavors come on late. Nice warmth going down. Finishes bitter and dry.  M: Medium body that belies the beers strength. Right amount of carbonation. Feels a little slick.  D: If you like heavily hopped Imperials, this is your beer. I like them a little more balanced.

112,412,dhd1491,4.03,"On pour, thick and black with dense foamy tan 3-finger head on pour. Alcohol jumps out a little in the nose. In the taste there is dense smoke and caramel, mocha and lemon rind. Malty sweetness at first, then gives way quickly to bitter smoky finish. High viscosity coats the tongue. Carbonation is light, somewhat fizzy.  This is a complex and potent brew to be enjoyed like a good espresso. There are tastes present that would be unpleasant on their own, but are delicately balanced together to form a challenging, but enjoyable concoction.  I admit that stouts have generally not been my favorites, but this one is so well crafted and complex that it is impossible not to appreciate and enjoy its effect. Much like a good cigar, to me.  I am drinking this without the accompaniment of food. However, I think that this brew (and maybe all stouts) would go better with a meal or dessert. The suggested pairing for this beer is chocolate-based dessert. I'm more than willing to try that combination.  ===  Note: Third time's the charm. Tonight (4/7/08) I had the third bottle out of the 4-pack. Really enjoyed it as a dessert beer. Aftertaste is fairly strong, smoky and bitter, but all-in-all, a very enjoyable brew. High ABV was just the right accompaniment to working on my tax returns.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Very well balanced between the chocolate and coffee. Hops and malts are very well balanced in this one. Mouthfeel is very creamy.

112,412,blackjack000,4.45,"Appearance: The stout pours out as a dark rum color and sits in the glass as a glistening coal black. A thick and tall creamy head forms, with beautiful, textured dimples within. After the beer pours, the head and beer sits in a beautiful, unyielding stasis, as if it would remain at this consistency forever. As the stout is drank, beautiful tiers of lacing sit on the glass like layers of a bustle dress. To the last, some head remains and clings to the edges after each tip of the glass. The beer's appearance matches it's wonderful taste perfectly.  Smell: Deep and aromatic alcoholic brown sugar scents come up initially. Brown sugar bubbles up from a pan and starts to burn into a hard coating. A smell like oak barrels full of Caribbean rum comes up with the alcohol scent heavy underneath. When drawn through the mouth, the scent feels deep and almost like wilting flowers.  Taste: Rich, roasted coffee beans; age-conditioned oak beams scavenged from Old World furniture; harsh baker's chocolate; molasses poured from a mason jar; a twist of old-time liquorice thrown in for good measure. As the beer slightly warms, a strong and bitter coffee comes out.  Mouthfeel: The beer feels thick and chewy as the sip draws back into my throat. The stout sticks to the contours of my tongue and reluctantly leave several seconds after the swallow.  Drinkability: The beer was very large. A person would not feel tempted to consume much of this beer in one sitting.

The texture was thick and heavy, as you would expect, but it wasn't overly strong or too heavy like Rogue's imperial stout. It had tons of bittersweet/dark chocolate flavor with a bit of hops in the aftertaste. The alcohol wasn't too apparent, and there actually wasn't much coffee in the flavor either.

I get a hint of licorice and the alcohol. The texture of the smell, it's smoothness and balance, seems like a red wine.  T - I was intimidated by this beer at first, but I like something challenging. There is so much complexity and subtlety to it. I can taste coffee, roasted malts, dark chocolate, and the aforementioned licorice (black licorice, mind you). Old Rasputin has a lot to him that kept me intrigued throughout the entire experience.  M - Slight hint of carbonation. Smooth and easy to drink. No alcohol burn.  D - Old Rasputin isn't for everyone, but I certainly enjoyed it. It's a good beer to sit down and invest yourself in.

I'm expecting this beer to have as much character as the man himself.  Quite a complex mix of aromas: Most noticeable is the chocolate and coffee aroma followed by a crisp hop scent. Also some roasted hints.  Wow! I let this warm for about 15 minutes prior to indulging. More roasted character on the palate than I anticipated; still obvious flavors of chocolate and coffee beans. Let this legend dance on your palate and the hops become more apparent.  There is so much to enjoy about this beer, very lively on the palate with a fair amount of carbonation and hop bitterness that lingers.

Tastes of caramel and toffee at the forefront followed by a slight hop bitterness that fits in perfectly. Being a neophyte, the complexity of the smell and taste is more than I can tackle description wise. Mouth-feel is sinewy, creamy and smooth. Probably the tastiest stout I've ever had.

S - Complex nose of raw chocolate, dark fruits, and the tinge of hops. This aroma is worth taking several moments to absorb it all, especially if served chilled. Chances are you won't even catch most of the scents until it hits room temp.  T - Rich flavorful profile of fruit notes with a dry, bitter hop backing. Finishes with a toasty, dry malt flavour.

Notes of raisin, molasses, vanilla bean and figs linger in the background.  Mouthfeel was moderately full, but a tad too fizzy for a big RIS. A bit thicker and creamier would really make it.  First sip was a bit surprising relative to this stout's considerable bitterness and bite. This was not a negative, but most Imperial Stout's I've had have leaned toward the sweeter side. Flavors very reminiscent of the aroma with lots of roasted and black patent malts, charred wood and dark dried fruits along with a generous addition of hops to give it a long, dryish finish.

The nose is mostly roasted malts and coffee with a bit of hops. The flavor is more of the same, but with greater intensity. The hops really come out in the aftertaste. I'd say this is one of the hoppier Imperial Russian Stouts that I've had. Surprisingly, at 9% ABV, there's no aroma or taste of alcohol. It's completely overwhelmed by the malt and hops. The mouthfeel isn't as thick as most Imperial Russian Stouts, which is neither a good or a bad thing. It just is.

I always wonder why people mention raisins in their beer reviews.. but there it was waiting for me in Old Rasputin... just a touch at the end, along with some bitter hops.

112,412,BigRedN,4.53,"Appearance: Poured from the stubby 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. The beer is black. Even when held to the light nothing comes through. My pour produced a thick brown head, at least one inch in height. Head slowly fades to a solid cover and leaves sheets of lacing. Just amazing.  Smell: Big bold burst of roasted malt aromas. Chocolate, roasted coffee beans. A faint hint of piney hop aromas as well.  Taste: The taste of this beer follows the scent. Brings the malt right up front with a bang. Roasted malt, chocolate and coffee, not sweet malts, a touch bitter. There is also a blast of hop bitterness on the finish. Even at 9% ABV this is not boozy.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied, yet surprisingly this one does not feel overly heavy to me. Smooth going down a touch dry at the end. The 9% alcohol is fairly well hidden, although after two I feel it a little.  Drinkability: Typically, big, high ABV beers do not get high drinkability ratings for me. However, this one is an exception. I like malty beers and this one has what I like in spades. I was surprised to see this in Nebraska, and am happy that this RIS is a permanent part of the line up (usually I see this as a seasonal or one off beer).",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

The drinkability is a little low on this one, but I don't mind all that much because that's not what I'm looking for in an Imperial Stout.  Side note: I had that at Bada Boomz in downtown Indianapolis. I originally asked for a Stone IRS (2004), which they had on their menu but were out of.

The flavor is full of malty goodness but it is a bit spoiled by a burnt and bitter aftertaste. Alcohol heat is also noted. Carbonation and the body are spot on leaving a creamy mouthfeel that is an awesome part of RISs. The ABV and cost hurt drinkability.

A nice dark chocolate look to the beer itself and it looks very inviting. It almost looks like night itself.  A caramel burnt roasted flavor hits my nose as i take a whiff. I can also smell the malt from the beer as well. It smells great and i can tell this is going to be a great beer.  The taste is that of a roasted yet burnt chestnut. It is a tad too strong of the burnt flavor. It tends to overshadow the malt flavor but still good nonetheless.  A full burnt flavor in my mouth as i hold there for a few seconds to take it all in. I love the flavor but like i said it leaves behind that burnt roasted flavor a tad too long. It is thick and creamy yet smooth like silk as it goes down.

Thick one inch rusty brown colored head sits matter of factly on top and wont go away. I smell chocolate and coffee and malt and even some hops.  Taste is of dark chocolate, coffee, and there are definitely some hops in there. Quite unusual for this style, but not so much that it makes it bad, just enough so that you know its there. Actually its a nice suprise for a hop head like myself. Feels very smooth in the mouth with a fair amount of carbonation.  Finishes dry with a roasted coffee and caramel and hoppy aftertaste.

112,412,ommegoose,3.83,"Purchased at Whole Foods Market in Evanston for $6.99 a four pack.  Pours out pitch black. Leaves a head of about a quarter inch of large tan bubbles. Chunky, almost like a root beer float. Leaves sticky lacing around the glass. Giving the glass a little swirl restores some of the head. Very slight amber when some light peeks through at the end of the glass. Looks good, but does not distinguish itself from other RIS's in any way.  Smells like it will be pretty potent at first. I can catch a whiff of the dark malts from about two feet away after I open the bottle. Upon closer examination, the aroma is not as big as I expected. There are the usual culprits; dark malts, chocolate, caramel and some coffee. I do get the feeling that I'm only finding all those because I expect them here. Some alcohol is present too.  Thankfully, there's more complexity to the flavor than the aroma. Big espresso bitterness dominates. Too burnt to even say that it's chocolate or coffee here. This, plus generous hopping seem a bit much. There's also a surprising citrus hop fruitiness buried in here. This score would be higher, but I'm getting an off metallic note on the finish to go with espresso. I'm glad I like espresso a lot. But even espresso has that initial hit of sweetness that I'm not really getting here. The alcohol is not a secret here.  Mouthfeel is fine. A little hot from the alcohol. Carbonation is maybe a little too much. These issues sort of go away about halfway through as the beer sits, or the effects of the alcohol kick in a bit. Pretty solid.  One of these is fine for me. I probably won't rush out to buy this again soon, although it is a pretty good value compared to trying to track down the elusive RIS's. I could see myself picking this up if I happened to have a craving for espresso in beer. I would give the nitro-tap a try though. I suspect it would improve a bit.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

T: Roasted coffee and chocolate mingle with a little bit of hop flavor to create an absolutely delicious taste.  M: Creamy and thick with a very smooth finish.  D: So tasty, it demands multiple servings.

112,412,MisterStout,4.66,"The technical reviews below make it plainly obvious that this is an exceptional RIS. A few comments, though:  The first thing I noticed other than the midnight color and the very substantial head was the smell. Sniff it, and your nose tells your palate to pucker up. I started drinking mine pretty cold, then let it stand for a few minutes to warm up. As it warms, the burnt malt gives way (slightly) for the bitter chocolate to intensify. About halfway through the glass, you really begin to appreciate the lace--an intricate spider web made of creamy goodness.  I love this stuff.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,shabbtastic,4.6,"A - Poured a deep black into a pint glass. Beautiful two finger brownish tan head with impeccable lacing, (like the aging of a tree).  S - Coffee (espresso) with hints of dark chocolate. Dark roasted malts with a nice hop companion that adds just the right touch.  T - Wow, really full of flavor. Rich and smooth, perfect balance of creamy and bitter. Alcohol is noticeable, strong but very subtle. Earthy hops in the back make this an exceptional RIS.  M - Full bodied, nicely carbonated.  D - This is a benchmark for the style IMO. I could (slowly) drink these all night. Warm and inviting and probable one of the best RIS I'm had. Highly recommended.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

T: Roasted coffee bean (like a strong, dark roast), dark chocolate, and a rich smoky flavour.  M: Some reasonable weight to the body.. creamy and full with a smooth and slick finish.  D: Smooth sipping, though big enough to take at just one or two at a time. I'll be trying it out again.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,TheTrevor,4.15,"This beer poured pitch black with a big steady three-finger dark tan head that remained for the whole time I drank the beer. The smell is mostly roasted malts with some chocolate and coffee notes with the chocolate becoming more prominent as the beer warmed. This beer doesn't screw around, the taste starts off with sweet chocolate that's quickly dispersed by some bitter coffee taste and finished by a punch of alcohol. The mouthfeel is thick and slippery with some warming from the alcohol. This is a very powerful beer, which means I couldn't imagine drinking more than one at a time but not for lack of quality.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,morebeergood,3.93,"Had this on tap last night at Deep Ellum. I saw they had this on nitro tap, so I figured it was worth a re-visit. Pours with a huge frothy head, that unfortunately got so big that it spilled onto the table. The smell was what I expected, a symphony of roasted coffee and chocolate. The taste was even more delicious. I have had this beer before on tap, and I love it. But the nitro makes it that much more smoother and silky. Tastes like a chocolate imperial stout milkshake. Goes down way too fast for a 9% beer. One of my favorite RIS on the market. The nitro makes it that much better.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

As it lightens the smell of coffee and chocolate emerge and some bitterness from the alcohol.  T: Chocolate malts induce a luxurious sweet taste that is met quickly by the coffee biterness and alcohol to make this one amazingly balanced and tasty treat.  M: very creamy and thick, loved how it coated the tongue and mouth  D: note, do not session, might end up with headache, bloated stomach, and extreme dehydration...kidding...kind of",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,pershan,4.35,"Had this on-tap at Frisco Grille in Columbia, MD.  The beer poured an impenetrable blackness into a chalice with a thin, dark head. The smell was of roasted malt and alcoholic esters. Alcohol was the predominant flavor initially, with roasted malt in the middle and a nice lingering hop bitterness at the end. This is a full-bodied beer, with a great balance between the alcohol, malt, and hop components. Very drinkable.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,mnstorm99,4.2,"Nice black pour with a good tan head that stick around very well, and the lacing was nice throughout as well. Little hoppy on the nose and smokey, spicy notes in the hops. Flavor is of smokey coffee malts (but not overly smokey), a touch of spicey hops rounds it out, this one is overly sweet like some RIS can be, nice change. great chewy thick mouthfeel as expected with this type of beer, this is a pretty easy drinking RIS, overall a great beer.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,prototypic,4.38,"Appearance: It pours nearly jet black in color. Head is creamy, chocolaty brown and a massive two and a half fingers deep. Excellent retention and lacing.  Smell: Chocolate and roasted malt blend extremely well with coffee scent. Malty and sweet smelling. Perhaps a hint of toasted nut. Hops are more noticeable than I would've expected, but far from overpowering. Didn't pick up any alcohol on the nose.  Taste: Chocolate malts provide an initial sweet taste that is pretty well balanced out by the bitter/sour coffee flavor. Very creamy and smooth. Light hop bitterness and toasted nut flavors and complexity and depth.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's medium bodied to thick. Carbonation is excellent and abv is perfect for this beer. It's extremely smooth and drinkable despite the 9% abv. Overall, this is damn fine beer. Highly recommended.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Kegatron,4.45,"On tap at the Capital Ale House (Richmond, VA).  Pours a deep black with just the smallest amount of red highlights around the bottom and a thin creamy tan head that retained beautifully and left thick lacing down the sides of the glass. The aroma is thick with notes of chocolate, deep roasted malts, dark fruits and hop bitterness.  The flavor profile is deep with chocolate sweetness, espresso notes, and dark fruit tartness. The real highlight of this beer though is the combo of burnt and hop bitterness that pervades throughout. A honestly think that this beer almost achieves a perfect balance of the sweet and bitter. The mouthfeel is full bodied and creamy with just a touch of warmth. That 10.5% is insanely hidden, making for a most smooth and drinkable experience.  IMO, Old Rasputin is one of the most underrated beers on the market right now. Just packed with all the flavors you would want in an RIS but in one hugely drinkable package. Plus you can usually find some fantastic prices on this at the store. For the money, one of the best beers on the market.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Strix,3.98,"Black with barely dark ruby edges and a huge head that lasts forever.  Smells of roasted flavors and chocolate.  Roasted flavors dominate this, with the bitterness of very dark chocolate and hops and a bit of alcohol. Long-lasting bitter aftertaste is nice.  Feel is nice and smooth. Perhaps a little less dense than I expect in a RIS.  Definitely a nice one. It could stand to have the bitterness dialed back a bit to let some of the malt shine through, but I can't complain too much.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,IBUnit63,4.08,"Thick, coffee ice cream-colored head that sticks around for a while. Espresso-dark and thick - coats the mug nicely. Mild, dry aroma with toasted-burnt but pleasant crispy malt. Taste is very dry with slight bitterness on the palate. Deep, dark roasted backbone that's very warming to the senses. Strong espresso roast tones. Slight metallic aftertaste (packaging?). No overly alcoholic flavor - this is very well balanced. This stuff coats the mouth - even though it's a little dry and bitter at times it's very thick and soothing. Very well-made to enjoy in moderation.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,TYE,4.46,"A - Wow! Massive head!! Really over poured this one easily. Thick brown foam head like malt. Looks like a sponge from the side. Good retention and sticks on glass. Looks like liquid chocolate and very inviting. Very black. S - Smells like scorched dark chocolate, roasted malt and liquor. Very strong aroma. T - Holy $*^! - very full flavor. Mild bitterness at back of tongue. Slightly sour on the sides. Roasted goodness like drinking a fired almond. M - Lightly carbonated. Well balanced. A little bite on the back of the tongue. Feels slightly heavy. D - I LOVE THIS BEER! So much character!! This is my first Imperial Stout, and I have to be honest, I was a little scared. The aroma almost made my knees shake.

112,412,BMan1113VR,4.18,"A little bit disappointed by this one, good beer, but I find the reputation to be better than the actual product. Pours the standard Imperial black, with a large creamy head and excellent lacing (could see every sip taken). Aroma is strong malts with some light piney hops and even a bit of clove. Taste is of bitter coffee grounds. It has an exceptionally long after taste, with a slightly warming alcoholic finish. Mouthfeel is creamy and the carbonation is flat. As for the super stouts I feel that this is a good product, but nothing compared to Great Divide's Yeti. Still good, and that is coming from a non-Stout drinker.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,JEdmund,4.48,"Appearance Black like espresso with a quickly rising head. The bubbles come up quickly and are tiny, giving the head a lighter body that dissipated a little quicker (or maybe I just drank it off because the glass was so full). I could see lots of little fizz bubbles coming up to the head, and those are certainly felt when drinking it.  Aroma Malt, roasted/toasty, a little spicy, some dried/candied fruit, coffee; not overly big like other imperials (Yeti)  Taste & Mouthfeel So impressive from the first sip - it goes down so nicely it just begs to be drank quickly. It feels really fizzy in mouth, but not like it's going to turn to foam either (it's hard to explain, but a good quality). There's a big upfront flavor of roasted malts, followed by dark chocolate, finishing with an espresso and hop bitterness, and finally, the aftertaste is even more of chocolate and some coffee. It has a peppery quality to it, although it doesn't sting at all unpleasantly. The whole thing is so pleasantly balanced it's unreal. It's almost too smooth to think you're drinking an imperial; however, the flavors are big enough to make you aware.  Overall This is one of the best Russian Imperials I've ever had. I haven't had lots to try from though to be fair, however, it is in my top two, tied with GD's Yeti.  ***  3-Year Tasting - '07 Bottle, cellared December 2007, tasted on February 1, 2011 (during a blizzard!)  Tasted at 55F  Immediately amazed by the strong head that forms and the lively aroma; aroma is still strong with cocoa and coffee. Flavor is still robust, though certainly not to the degree of a fresh bottle. What strikes me of its difference is it seems a bit thinner in body (though still has good carbonation) and the finish has a bit of a metallic edge to it. But the finish isn't off-putting; in fact, it has a fairly assertive bitterness still. It's leaving thick lace curtains! Getting good chocolate and coffee flavor throughout. Maybe a hint of some woodiness too. I'm pretty impressed with how well this beer has held up and consider it a success.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,fitzy84,4.15,Drank it at Moan and Dove. It poured out deliciously dark looking and settled to a thin head. Sharp malts were definitely sensed almost with some hops. There was a beautiful sense of roasted flavors overall. The taste had a bitter and creamy attribute to it. It seemed a tiny bit off being so bitter but it was still really enjoyable. The drink was surprisingly thin for a Russian imperial stout. It also had a slightly crisp aftertaste!

112,412,cfleisher,2.46,"Never thought I'd say this, but this beer was too highly hopped for me. Nice dark espresso color and low carbonation, smelled of caramel malt, but could barely taste it.

M - Astringent, not overly carbonated, but definitely tingles your tongue.  D - At 9.00% ABV, its more drinkable than World Wide Stout, but still not something you can drink on a daily basis.

112,412,seaoflament,3.5,"Thanks Floydster for this beer.  I used to drink this beer more frequently, before I got into trading, and this was one of the beers that got me hooked into this particular style. I haven't had one of these in months. Let's see how it holds up now.  Pours jet black with a huge 3 finger thick head that slowly trickles down. The foam takes a few minutes to ""settle"" to an inch of foam and leaves behind thick soapy lacing behind.  Smells of citrus hops upfront, I forgot how hoppy this RIS is. Great toasted and bready malts in the background with some notes of toffee and milk chocolate. It smells like a citrus flavored chocolate. There are also some dark fruits hiding in the back along with some grains and a touch of alcohol.  Tastes of bitter chocolate with some citrus and deeply roasted barley finish. Lots of burnt toast and hops as well. Dark fruits and some alcohol. Tastes a little rough actually. I'm picking up some flavors of alcohol soaked raisins.  Great carbonation and almost silky mouthfeel.  Sadly, this one isn't what I remembered it to be and it's not even among my top 10 or 15 RIS I've tasted. Tastes too rough, the alcohol is a bit intrusive and it could use a sweeter chocolate taste instead of the dry, dark and bitter taste.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,hustlesworth,4.7,"A- sweet bubble action like millions of gumballs cascading downwards. tan head is puffy and creamy like frothed chocolate milk with great retention, hanging over the thick pitch black body like an evil donut storm cloud and a ring of lace along the lip of the glass that seems to drip down forever. held up to the light, the faintest hints of rosewood and mahogany can be seen at the bottom of the glass.  S- roasted malts and chocolate, woodsy and herbal with a bit of coffee here and there. tart smoked currants and prunes. smells like there's a good deal of hops in there too, as there should be. citric, floral, and slightly piney is a nice contrast against the big load of malt. bitter oranges dipped an molasses, and some aromas similar to kahlua or tia maria.  T- tart fruity roasted malt starts to become sweet before it's neutralized by sharp hop bite. pine and deep dark citrus peel take over becoming pungent making way for fruity vodka-like alcohol solvents to become apparent. as the hops get re-balanced by the dark malt, the after taste smoothes out to woody and herbal and a lil smokey like old furniture and burning rosemary. some cigar as well, and old charred tobacco pipe, this brew is only sweet for a half second, the rest of the way it's dry and complex and i could probably taste new things for hours.  MF- this is one rich and luxurious brew, not quite creamy, but more like drinking melted chocolate mixed with poorly filtered coffee. seemingly grainy texture is so thick and viscous that it just comes together with the beautiful amount of carbonation the make a dense full bodied brew.

Lots of lace and good head retention throughout. Mostly sweet aroma with a coffee roasted bitterness, cocoa. A bit of chocolate and a bit of lactic sourness balancing with some juicier notes in the background. Smells good, straightforward and clinical stylewise.  Taste is good, but a little raw for my liking. There's a distinct background note of rubber beneath the inital whack of lactic sourness and bitter roast that assaults the palate. Bitter cocoa and milk chocolate. Bittersweet with a schwack of flavour and a big alcohol burn going down. This is still a bit rough for my liking, very flavourful though. Body is heavy, but not too heavy, carbonation is zippy, and finish is dry and satisfying. This is a drinkable stout, is small quantites of course, but it goes down pretty well.

Smells of dark roasted malts, bitter chocolate and fresh-ground dark roasted coffee. Tastes of iced coffee as it begins to warm. Creamy and chocolaty with an air of sweetness that never turns to the bitter finish you would come to expect. There is some mysterious spice to this RIS as well. Some licorice and/or anise thing that leaves the back of the throat a little tingly. Maybe a little alcohol burn in there two, but not as hot as you might think.

Lucky for me, I got a four-pack of it for Christmas and almost cried tears of joy when I ripped it from the packaging.  From tip of the bottle to the bottom of the glass, Old Rasputin pours a rich dark-brown/molasses-y coloring that resembles coffee with a light dose of cream. Its rich brown head smells of caramel and nuts and it offers up a profoundly robust flavor that smacks of classic stout taste with a nice punch of alcohol to round it out.  This little number was no slouch and it lived up to all of my expectations. It's powerful, flavorful and delightfully nuanced: it's definitely become an all-time favorite and one most stouts should aspire to be more like.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,YankChef,4.62,"12 oz. bottle poured into my eagles mug. No freshness date  Appearance: Pours a mean looking pitch black with a one inch puffy, foamy chocolate milk color. lacing is very nice.  Aroma: Smells roasty of dark bittersweet couverture chocolate and dark grain (barley and rye). There is also a pretty heavy coffee note, but almost a sweet coffee like a frapucinno.  Taste: One the front it is almost sweet with the coffee and chocolate flavors melding with other complex notes of dried fruit and toasted candied walnuts and pecans. Then the balancing bitterness kicks in from the very healthy amount of hops in here to leave a bitter astringent feeling in the mouth that really makes you salivate. This beer is definitely ""dry"". Kind of stings the tounge on the finish, with an almost metallic taste.  Mouthfeel: Full and rounded, it really coats the mouth and is just fat and chunky.  Overall: In the world of RIS, this one just plain kicks ass. It has all of the body and flavor to represent the style with pride, a truly world class beer from North Coast.

And while there are a few that approach the overall quality, taste, and experience (e.g. Mikkeller Black Hole) of this delicious imperial, none really match the value for money in this area. Wish it had a bit more head and lacing, but otherwise, the mouthfeel, the smooth blending of the (fairly high) alcohol, and above all the flavor and the aroma, make this a real winner.

Not as big on hops as other American Impy Stouts, but a great balance. Easy to drink, and only gets easier after a few. Luckily it only comes in a 4-pack because the 5th would seem easy tonight, but not so easy in the morning.  Note: One of the first ""true"" craft beers that I purchased in college.

There is also a strong hop presence. Taste - it's like there's a party in my mouth and everyone's rich and tasty. Huge flavor. Chocolate mostly, as the smell made quite clear. A meal in itself. Great, thick beer with enough carbonation to keep it lively. A great beer to sip and contemplate, read, or enjoy a chat with a close friend. Don't have too many of these.

112,412,sjohansen,3.65,"Got this in a mixed pack from a holiday beer club event. And I dont know who picked it, but I should write them a thank you card.  To start off, good Ole Raspy on the front scares the crap out of me. Once I build the courage to open the bottle, it pours black black as night in Norway during the winter. Got a nice dark tan three-finger head that sticks around for a while, gets rocky and then dissipates with lots of lacing, sticking to glass thick.  This one obviously clocks in high. I get a little rubbing alcohol in the nose. Even as it warms, that alcohol smell sticks around. I think this one would be interesting to age to see if that mellows out a little bit. As far as complaints go, the fact that I cant pick up anything else in the nose is the only one I have.  The alcohol is in the taste, but not as strong as it is in the nose. As it warms it is even less apparent. This stout is good. You get a little sweet on the tongue (I assume from the chocolate malts,) a little bitter in the finish, a great balance from the malts all the way through. Very slight carbonation to tickle the tongue and create a great mouthfeel. It warmed me right up on a cold December day as I watched a Flyers game.

The taste follows the nose quite well with big flavors of chocolate, smokey peat, toffee, roasted malt, and some dark fruit (mostly plums and raisins).

An interesting combination of prunes, licorice whips, and chocolate...dark chocolate. No hint of the fruity esters or alcohol presence I've gotten used to with Imperial Stouts. Well, maybe a hint, but not much at all. No hops to be found. My mouth is watering in anticipation.  Taste: Dark and roasty with just a dab of alcohol. There is a sort of bitter flavor in there, like a really dark chocolate, but it is also round and mildly fruity. It just tastes really good and stout, if somewhat hard to put into words for some strange reason. This beer is big, but not an alcohol monster, and I even think of the word ""subtle"". Not to say that it isn't full of flavor, because it is highly tasty. I wish I could find the right words. Mmmm is the best I have.  Mouthfeel: It coats the mouth, but has a bit of water, just in the center, which serves it well to keep it honest. It lingers for a while.  Drinkability: This is divine. My new favorite for the season. I wish I had a dark chocolate cake with chocolate frosting, laced with vanilla highlights and a few black cherries to go along with this marvel of brewing science and technology.

S: immediately briny hops and slight molasses hiding behind a strong co2 release. [poured very cold] as it warms, espresso and herbally bitter notes, fernet and echinacea with a suggestion of prune, and faint molasses edging in shyly.  T: immediately bitter in the mouth, receding to strong roast burnt espresso, astringent charcoal bitterness, barely a suggestion of the fruits hinted at in the nose. this is an overwhelmingly dry and earthy, bitter herbal stout. slight acidity strikes in a flash as the bitterness subsides, finishing dry fading into alcohol warmth late suggestive of melted bitter chocolate.  M: medium full mouthfeel, balanced with a medium carbonation, high for a stout of this gravity, leaves with bitter astringent dryness that mellows.  D: this is one of my go-to's, good punch and hits the hop craving in the back of my toungue. for a stout, it's lacking the robustness and dynamic layers of malt fruits that balance a beer this intensely hoppy, roasted and alcoholic. it's not inherently drinkable, but does play an enjoyable foil to a night of IPA.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Smell was all that imperial stout stuff- roasted barley and chocolate are the main things. The taste was very rich with a pretty big roastiness. Had a nice slick mouthfeel but didn't overwhelm with thickness or syrupyness. A very good tasting stout, much different than what I experienced from the bottle I tried a few months ago. Ratings have been updated.  ___ Bottled version 12.16.07  A- Poured into a pint glass, a nice dark brown to black, can be seen through at the bottom of the glass and had a fluffy light-tan head.  S- The smell was pretty faint but definitely roasty and slightly acidic. This was much more tilted toward the roast then other RIS's which tend to be sweeter to me (ie Stone)  T- Roasty with a deep bitter chocolate second half. There is just a bit of alcohol at the very end. On about my 8th sip, something happened and the taste just became unbearable. At first it was an average, maybe even slightly above average beer to me, but at that point it turned to something that was making me sick having in my mouth. The taste just became a big alcohol and astringent mess. I don't know what it was but I couldn't finish half this glass.  M- Exceptionally smooth, the carbonation you know is there, it wasn't flat by any means, but in the mouth you don't get one hint of carbonation as it is all hidden under a blanket of malts.

The taste is amazing for those who like dark beers. You have layers of flavor, malt and hops, even some chocolate hints. Very complex flavor and surprisingly lighter then it looks. The most interesting thing to me is that the flavor out weighs the bitterness in your mouth. All that dark goodness coats your mouth and blends very well. A big, complex beer with a lot going on.

A bit of the chocolate in the middle, along with some bitterness, and then a huge toasted finish.  MF: A bit bubbly for a stout. Huge, thick and chewy, but maybe not quite as smooth as others in this style. The alcohol makes its presence known, but doesn't take over.  D: Not my favorite of this style, but a solid brew. The flavor has a nice balance with the slight bitterness which in some ways makes it easier to drink. A bit overcarbonated for my taste.

112,412,BACTAdam,4.2,"I went with this brew totally blindly, not having read any reviews and not having any expectations. Here is what I found...  A- Dark as night. Charcoal black with only the slightest hints of brown with a dark copper head. Head was medium but faded fairly quickly to thin.  S- Smells of dark coffee with hints of dark chocolate.  T- Old Rasputin is a whirlwind of flavor. Honestly, at the start, I was puzzled by it. Quite bitter for a stout with sort of a burnt taste. Made me pucker a bit from the bitterness and I wasn't crazy about it. By mid-glass and as the beer warmed, the true amazing flavors come out and I was sold. The alcohol burn becomes more apparent but I also get notes of espresso, dark and milk chocolate and a nice sweetness I love in imperial stouts. By the end, I was begging for more.  M- A very solid mouthfeel- heavy, makes you feel like you're drinking a beer and not water.  D- What to say about drinkability. It's certainly not a session beer but it's very drinkable for an imperial stout. The alcohol doesn't start to kick in til mid-glass so it's deceiving. Still, one or two of these per session is more than enough.  Overall, this is a high quality Imperial Stout.

Head dies very slowly and leaves a thick coating on the glass.  Smells of rich roasted malts and chocolate. Very smoky, but not ashy like some Imperial Stouts. Hint of caramel in the background.  I think I'm in love. First taste is bold, roasted malt, followed closely by the chocolate and caramel. The perfect amount of bitterness (in my opinion) for a strong stout, coming from the roast and smokiness.  Creamy, thick body, more carbonation than I would expect but it's not unpleasant. The three main flavors just roll around on the tongue in perfect harmony. There's something about how they roasted the malt that strikes me as very pleasing, but unfortunately I don't have enough experience with stout production to know what it is.  Overall this is a stout-lover's dream. Not for a weak stomach, because it has a hefty bitterness and high ABV that shamelessly displays itself in the taste, but it is just one hell of an enjoyable drink.

The head is dirty brown. The smell is thick, oily, molasses, cherry overtones, dark roasted coffee, and sweet malts. This beer is full bodied, strong, bitter, and not for the faint at heart. Perhaps I'm the faint at heart because I couldn't imagine drinking more than one. I can appreciate the style to a point, but then it is just a strong espresso, molasses, bitter and biting roasted malt brew that just stings in the mid section. On the very tail end, some sweet malts and cherry like flavors emerge, but not until I've been hit over the head by the mid section and beyond of just bitter and strong flavors. As the beer settles a bit, the more warming alcohol notes and the sweeter malts present themselves sooner. The aftertaste is a bit over the top for me as well.

Smells rich and dark, like espresso. This is a very complex brew here. Aroma of fruit and licorice, malt and coffee.  This is one fine tasting stout. This is what I want a stout to taste like. Very rich and dark with a nice alcohol finish and a good warming end to it. You know you're drinking a strong beer when you drink this one. Not the strongest of stouts, but just the right amount of kick to it. The alcohol is present but it isn't overpowering or overbearing in any way.  I loved this beer. I had to travel an hour west to get the last two bottles that the store had. It was worth the trip and I guarantee you that I'll make it again.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,bushbeer75,4.28,"Since this brew has such an outstanding reputation I was wondering if it would live up to it, or if it was just hype  Well it sure deserves that fine rep!  Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout poured an almost opaque [reddish] black color with a bumpy 1½ finger tan head and leaves behind some lacing. This is a complex brew with a rich intense robust palate that is creamy, buttery [smooth] with the right amount of carbonation. Old Rasputin has a light fruit aroma. The taste is dominated by dark chocolate and coffee with touches of blackberries.  Drink ability is a little lower due to its rich flavor [it hides the alcohol well] but that is NOT a bad thing! Rasputin makes for a GREAT nightcap.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Kadonny,4.03,"Poured from a bottle into my imperial pint glass.  A: A dark almost black color with a beautiful light brown head. Nice glass lacing as the head subsides.  S: I'm not sure why others don't smell what I did, but right up front I smell hops. Maybe I had a really fresh bottle, but there was no mistaking the initial hop smell. From there when I kept sniffing I picked up the sweet roasted malt with coffee, cocoa, dark chocolate and the sweet burnt caramel smell.  T: Incredible. Once again, hops bitterness right off the bat, but as the beer settles in your mouth you get the traditional stout flavors of coffee, dark chocolate, caramel and the malt. Nice finish that lasts on this beer with some alcohol presence, but far from offensive. This is one complex excellent tasting beer.  M: Great mouthfeel, the alcohol is there and you can taste it as it finishes in your mouth, but it's just really enjoyable.  D: Excellent, boy I could easily put away many of these (if I could stay upright).  Overall this is an excellent stout. I am new to this style of beer, but no doubt hands down this is a favorite of mine. I'm a hop guy and I just loved the upfront hops in this beer. Well done North Coast, cheers to you. I see me drinking a lot of this beer in the future.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

T: Burnt black malt, coffee, dark chocolate, spicy hops, ripe plums, figs, molassas, and fresh green/resinous hops. Masterful!  M: Creamy, spicy, bitter, and at the same time, sweet.

Some sweetness here also.  t: A fantastic combination of semi-sweet dark chocolate and bitter hops dominate. Or maybe thats just unsweetened cocoa? Hint of coffee at the end.  m: Absolute perfection here. The carbonation and viscosity are spot on.  d: I'd like to always have some of these in stock.

It has a creammy, light brown head with average retention and some lacing. aves a bit to be desired as well. Nice aroma of dark chocolate, some fruity hoppiness and coffee opens way to a full-bodied brew, with bittersweet chocolate, unsweetened and at times burnt coffee and a bitter, dry hoppy finish.

Big aromas of coffee and anise, with a subtle chocolate and a nice oakiness. Very good.  Taste is huge RIS. Sweet, roasty malt backed by massive dark flavors of coffee, anise, and maybe a subtle fruitiness. Very woody, and surprisingly bitter on the finish. No perceptible alcohol, very smooth and slick.

T- a heavily roasted scents build up immediately on top of the strong maltiness of the stout. the strong roasted flavors give a delicious flavor which then slowly fades off.

I think the whole taste pattern also goes well with the amount of alcohol in the brew as the alcohol sort of hits and adds flavor to the lasting taste. moreover, it really does warm you and make you feel like you just enjoyed that cup of strong coffee.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Gehrig,4.6,"An impressive, complex, tasty Russian Imperial Stout, Old Rasputin is the antithesis of nastiness represented by its namesake. It pours a very dark brown, with a finger thick of long-lasting head and a latticed froth that adheres to the pint glass throughout consumption--impressive. The smell and taste are bold, hoppy, and rich with malt, chocolate, coffee, and maybe caramel--strong but smooth in taste and texture. The finish is wonderful, and I'm ruing the fact that I only picked up one in a sampler pack at the local Piccadilly.  Very tasty, helping me bounce back strong from being under the weather yesterday. Easily one of the best stouts I've had, and right at and near the the top of Russian Imperials I've had the good fortune to have tried. Definitely a great find, more than worth the try, and don't make the mistake of buying just one. Get the pack. You won't be sorry.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,bigdogplaypen,4.52,"A Dark Black Stout that pours heavy with a two or three finger head leaving behind a dark tan lace. Bold flavor of dark roast coffee and semi sweet chocolate finishing with a slight alcohol bite. At 9% this beer should be enjoyed responsibly and drank slowly to experience all of the rich complex flavors. I usually drink one or two of these in a sitting and enjoy them alongside a good cigar and then finishing with my favorite dark chocolate. This is one of my favorite beers of all time and definitely my favorite Russian Imperial Stout. I recently spent painstaking hours translating the Cyrillic writing on the label and found that &#1057;&#1045;&#1056;&#1044;&#1045;&#1063;&#1053;&#1067;&#1049; &#1044;&#1056;&#1059;&#1043; &#1053;&#1045; &#1056;&#1054;&#1044;&#1048;&#1058;&#1057;&#1071; &#1042;&#1044;&#1056;&#1059;&#1043; means HEART FRIEND IS NOT BORNE SUDDENLY. I feel that this means that a dear friend is not made overnight, so I recommend that you never drink this beer alone but always try to share one with a friend in honor of the Old Man which had many enemies who tried killing him on several occasions and finally succeeded but not before he had his fill of women and brew.

There is no freshness information.  Pours viscously opaque black into a brandy glass. A creamy dark brown head adorns the infinitely dark body. It's real sticky and nearly tattoos the glass with its lace.  The aroma is surprisingly dominated by Cascade hops instead of chocolate or coffee like I had expected. The taste also has a hoppy bite to it, as well as a deep bitterness of dark chocolate. Several levels of bitterness blossom across the tongue and linger after each sip.  All the bitterness makes me think this is a fresh bottle. I'd like to see how this ages.

Initial milk chocolate aroma up front especially when swirled at around 55 degrees. This is followed by some mild roast and coffee notes.  More roast in the flavor than chocolate followed by a bitter espresso like taste at the back of the tongue. Burnt and acrid as you go on. Probably from the roasted barley. A little sweet also which is nice.  A very smooth full bodied beer. A creamy,slick feeling on the tongue. Alcohol shows up later in the finish but is well hidden until then.

112,412,neobassman,2.84,"Ok, here I go again, trying to decide if my dislike is for the brew or the style. I'm not a fan of Guinness, and I'm not a fan of Old Rasputin RIS for the same reasons. The appearance is enticing; this stout has an inviting syrupy pour with a rich, dark tan, modest head. The bottle opened with more carbonation than I would have expected from a stout. There is moderately sticky lacing as the head slowly subsides. The color is black and passes virtually no light, which I always find amazing for beers that are also free of cloudiness. The smell is good, but with some coffee bitterness that starts the downhill slide for me. (In the interest of full disclosure, I've never learned to like coffee, either.). This beer is all stout, but its taste has a top and bottom without a middle. The top is a prominent hops bitterness, and the bottom consists of slight saltiness with strong roasted, even burnt, flavors. What came to mind was ""catmouth"" because I kept trying to get it past my tongue long after the swallow. I would have expected the mouthfeel to be more creamy than it is.  If you like Guinness, you will probably really like this offering - the high Ba rating attests to this. However, it is not for me. I gave this a 3.0 overall in deference to the style, but based on personal preference I would have gone lower. So there it is. If you like bitter, cooked coffee stouts like Guinness, this may be for you and I urge you to try it. If, like me, you like rounder stouts like Young's Oatmeal Stout or an imperial like Old Heathen, this North Coast offering may not be your cup of tea.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

I actually cant even remember what caused me to beging saving and aging this one, but I got a new place and thought I'd cristen it appropriately.  Pours a pitch black in color with a head I can only describe as some sort of irridescent peanut butter brown color. Thick and heavy, just as expected.  Aromas of alcohol seems to mask any other odor that may be seeping from my glass. Smells a little more like deep red wine than it does a beer. Maybe some raisins and dark chocoalte seep through, but mainly its just alcohol.  Wow, this one is definitly a sipper. One of the most complex-tasting beers that have ever graced my lips. Drinking any faster than a snail's pace would be wasting the excellent flavors this one has to offer and any opportunity to decipher them. At the front of the palate it is fairly simple, maybe roasted malts, coffee, and alcohol. . . but as the sip continues, and onslaught of flavors pour through. It seems as every sip is a bit different than the previous one, so picking them out is a bit of a task. Dark chocolate, coffee, herbal/plant-like (maybe that is the hops), vanilla bean, raisins, dried fruits, buscuits, chalk. It seems as if the list could continue on and on.

112,412,elmore,4.68,"I had this beer from the tap at Bodega in Columbus, OH. I have had this beer from the bottle in the past and thought it was great, but it completely blew me away from the tap!!  From the draft into a pint glass in front of me at the bar. The beer was black as tar with a thick, rich, velvety, creamy, tan head. The beer was given to me with about 3-4 inches of head which settled down nicely. Absolutely a beautiful pour - looked like Guiness only this one has some taste. Very rich smell with hints of coffee, burnt malts, toffee - very complex. Rich chocolatey taste with a great creamy mouthfeel and a nice bit of alcoholic burn. Beautiful beer with a taste to match - great from the bottle - excellent from the tap. If you like stouts give this a try.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,geetlord,4.72,"This beer poured a dark thick black with a thick and creamy brown head. It smelled strongly of coffee chocolate and somewhat of alcohol. The flavor here is intense. Dark roasted coffee and dark unsweetened chocolate dominate, there is also a toasted sweetness like roasted marshmallows that are almost burnt(the best kind). The finish is smooth with a touch of alcohol. This is currently my favorite stout",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Douglas14,4.83,"WOW, this beer is amazing. It pours black and oil like (but slightly less than other RIS's). Has an amazing dark tan head that is fluffy and dense and leaves pretty good webbing. The smell is very complex with caramel, coffee, chocolate, burnt woods, and many other dark scents. The taste is even better, same flavors as listed above but more concentrated. Its absolutely amazing ,and pretty much beyond words that I can express right now. Amazing, one of my favorites.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Jedimaster1,3.95,"This beer tastes much different on tap than it does from the bottle. Btw, I had it at the Yard House in Rancho.  A: It looks exactly like a Guinness. Same look in a pint glass -- especially the darkened head.  S: Guinness again!  T: Tastes like a thick, creamy, alcoholy Guinness. Definitely a stout similar to the Irish Stouts -- could it be an Imperial Guinness? lol. Little too much alcohol in the taste, but still a good imperial stout.  M: The alcohol definitely resonates in the mouth. Takes the enjoyment away from the next sip.  D: With the ABV at 9%, not too many of these can be taken in a sitting without not being able to walk upright.  This is a fine brew. The funny thing is, to me it is an Imperial Guinness on tap, but an Imperial Stout from the bottle -- definitely different based on how you have it. Great brew. The only caveat, as others have mentioned, is the alcohol that sometimes comes to the forefront of this fine brew. Still recommended if you have never tried it on tap.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,dnichols,3.38,"I poured a 12 ounce bottle into a mug.  A: The beer poured a creaamy and nearly black hue. Even back lit I could find not color other than black. An aggressive pour resulted in a massive sticky milk chocolate head of more than four fingers. The head receded leaving a beautiful tan lacing.  S: It smells of bitter dark chocolate, thick molasses, a hint of black licorice, and a deep smoky aroma that reminded me of my last campfire after I doused it with water.  T: It reminds me a a quad chocolate latte on the front end. That is folled by a rich bitter chocolate bite.Finally, there is a dry finish accented by a smoky sour flavor that lingers long after swallowing.  M: It was medium to full bodied. I didn't detect much carbonation but there was an alcohol drying in my mouth after swallowing and a a lingering bitterness that began pleasantly but developed into a sour taste that was not appealing.  D: I have yet to develop an appreciation for stouts. This one was enjoyable through the first half of the bottle then the bitterness got to me. A small 12 ounce serving is about enough for me.  Comment: For years I equated stouts with the bottles of Guinness my Irish friend would try to foist on me. Granted my palate was immature, but I never developed a taste.

Two finger head the color of a good roux that settles around the edges first while the puck in the center tries to hang on for all its might.  S - Coffee is the dominant smell, but I get just a whiff of cedar  T - I was a bit taken aback by the hops that hit right up front. Not really in a bad way just unexpected. The hops usually hit second in the RISs I remember most. I like this better I think it balances well with the burnt malts  M - Medium heavy mouthfeel more like a great porter than a heavier stout. I think its the upfront hops that cut the richness right off the top.  D - I feel the alcohol in my belly although its well hidden on my palate.

Chocolate and coffee aroma flavors ... not as bitter as many stouts, though not as strong tasting either. Mouthfeel was a bit thin, but there was a touch of hops and more than a touch of roasty bitterness. Ugh. Too much roast, too acrid, not enough chocolate or sweetness to balance it.  A really overrated stout.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,jbsteiny,4.49,"What can I say about old Rasputin that hasn't already been said? That crazy bastard inspired what is probably the finest Imperial Stout I've ever tasted. That said, it is not for the weak of heart. Tread lightly, ye who enter here...  Pours near-black with some ruby highlights in there. Light brown dense head leaves some lacing the color of creamy coffee. Nice. It would make a lot of sense if there was a part of Heaven that smelled like this, but I really like dark chocolate. Actually, North Coast should team up with a NorCal chocolate company to make an Old Rasputin bar... Hmm... Um, I guess I also get some coffee, maybe some esters and hops. It's kind of hard to tell. Definitely a wee bit of booze, which should prepare you for the 9% ABV that will hit you shortly.  Tastes amazing -- huge roast malt characteristics (a strongly choco-mocha), intense hopping. Would be a five if not for the booziness. Bit o' licorice? Why not? Thick and chewy, sticky and sweet, somewhat dry and bitter finish. Part of me wants to give this beer all fives, but it's real strong. I know that's what makes it ""Imperial"" (what with the not freezing on the way to the czar), but maybe somehow it could be incorporated better into the flavors? I don't know -- sometimes I'm drinking this and wonder if someone dropped a shot of Everclear in it without telling me. Regardless, the biggest, baddest Imperial I've ever had (though I've yet to try the World-Wide monster... maybe for Chanukkah?",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,trekbiker3000,3.8,"As a person that enjoys stouts I looked forward to trying this brew. The color wasn't as black as I expected, but still a very nice dark brown. Before I was finished admiring the appearance and nice frothy head, I caught a whiff of the sweet malt aroma, and a hint of the alcohol.  A rich malty flavor, but there was a noticeable alcohol kick. The roasted malts really come through. The carbonation seemed a little rough, but ok. As for the drinkability, I would find it hard to have more than one or two of these at a sitting.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Willibomb,3.82,"I am not a huge stout drinker, but this one was quite enjoyable, my only hangup was that it was upfront with a very strong alcohol taste that took a few drinks to blunt. As the bottle went down, it became more of a 4.5 beer, but the first hit is only a 3.0 beer if you catch my drift.  Color was the first thing I noticed, it is very dark as an imperial stout should be, and had a blended head from white to tan.  Also like many stouts, there was a chocolate/coffee smell which was probably the best feature of this beer.  Taste, was much like I mentioned before. The taste evolves from the first drink to the last, so don't judge this one until the bottle is empty!  Mouthfeel was smooth, but still a bit harsh alcohol-wise which lead to....  Drinkability which I scored low due to the fact that after one, I was ready to move on despite the overall pleasant experiance after my first drink.  Overall, I think this beer is worth trying, I think North Coast produced a winner in this stout, but only buy it if you are into stouts, which if you are reading this, is probably true.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Dark tan head which stays around for a long time and leaves lacing all the way down the snifter. Aromas of bitter chocolate and hops and some alcohol Taste: Hop bitterness in front and hops in the finish, hoppier than I remember in the past. Dark chocolate, espresso notes all meld together with the hops as the beer warms. The chocolate becomes especially prominent the warmer the beer becomes. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth, especially as the beer warms. Couldn't handle more than one of these a night so drinkability suffers a bit.

S - Spicy, velvety aroma of hops combined with dark, chocolate malt. Slight floral notes and a bit of coffee and caramel.  T - Begins with smooth, mouth coating hop bitterness, quickly followed by roasted malt flavors of coffee, charcoal, and roast barley and a nice sweet note right in the middle. Strong dark grain bitterness and moderate alcohol warmth in the finish with lingering notes of dark caramel, smoke, and perhaps a bit of tobacco.  M - Smooth fairly thick body with moderately low carbonation. There is some astringency from the grain and hops, but much less than you might expect.  D - This is a beer to slowly sip and savour as the dark flavors only truly show themselves when the beer begins to warm. It is immensely enjoyable, though I would not want more than one in a sitting. The most remarkable aspect is the long, complex finish; it is reminiscent of a good cigar more than any other beer I have experienced.

BIG head took a few minutes to get all the enitre bottle into the glass. The head was the color of chocolate milk. Im still looking at the lace the head left even though the glass is almost empty.  The smell was a mix of sweet chocolate and coffee, dirt (not really as bad as it sounds)  Taste was of dark chocolates, coffee, chalk, some hints of fruits.

The usage of chocolate malt is really smooth, but makes the beer smell a bit burned. A real sniffer.  Taste is full of nice coffee, more burned or roast in the taste than in the smell. A distinct maltbitterness, which is not sharp determines most of this beer's character. The hops are overshadowed by the malty roast, so bitterness and hoppy notes are not really detectable.

A great way to end such a gret weekend. Poured into a big hefty mug.  AP: Looks amazing, big, deep dark body with a large mocha brown head that dissiptes real-sloooow. This is what a RIS should look like.  Nose: A really nice aromatic balance is obvious with big musty oak and chocolate with vanilla malt and a very distictive herbalized hop profile that is not as aromatic as some really big RIS that i've had.  Flavor: Once again. the balance of the flavors is the really impressive part, I've had much bolder RIS's with big heat and very sweet malt or very intense hop profile's, this one is a seemingly perfect balance of the flavor's. Not as bold as some with a very nice chocoalte-coffee and vanilla malt riding shot-gun to the ever-present natural oak-wood mild bitterness. I think the earthy hop flavor of this one is almost just-right, very noticable but not over-powering in anyway. This flavor is a total team effort that has no big ego super-star A-ROD to demand your attention constantly.  Feel: Full body for sure, just as hefty and thick as it should be, could be more so, but that's not the point, it's pretty dang right-on. The big-fat constant head makes for a creamy experience.

Great  M: Rich, Creamy, Silky Smooth. Has enough body to make it stick to the mouth and throat, which is a very good thing.  D: It goes down very nicely for a RIS. There is no hint of the ABV. It's a great drinking stout come summer or winter.  Overall: I have loved this beer since the first time I popped one open. It is very big on taste yet not too over the top. The flavors and aroma keep pulling me back to the glass. The flavors are soo complex, and they seem to hit you in waves. One sip is dark chocolate and coffee, the next may be sweet dark fruits and buttery chocolate.... So complex with so many flavors. It is so boldly subtle, I can't really explain it. It is one of the best stout's out there and deserving of its place in the top 100.  I just popped open a second bottle with a slice of chocolate mocha cake, and a dollop of birthday cake ice cream.... Yummmm. North Coast you RULE! Gotta go buy some more, because I just put down both of my bottles in one sitting.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,0tt0,4.4,"I'm not into stouts as a rule, so this should be interesting...  Pours a dark mahogany into my Duvel glass. Big tan head, fairly tight that slowly dissipates to a nice solid collar. A bit or ruby red highlights around the curves of the vessel... The dominant smell is of chocolate, specifically cocoa with a bit of toffee and heavily roasted coffee in the background. Smells absolutely delicious. Taste reflects the nose, but with a stronger toffee presence in the middle and nice hop tingle that I didn't expect given the scent. There is a dry, bitter finish that lasts quite a while that lingers with cocoa flavor.  If most stouts are as good as this, then I am a convert. Its a shame I tried it on a July night, because I am suddenly yearning for winter. A fabulous thing...",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,TheBierBand,3.92,"Picked up a four-pack from a newly discovered beer source.... Trader Joe's in Blue Ash - suburb of Cincinnati. Not a huge selection, but some off beat brands and nice policy on singles... you can mix and match individual beers and they just charge you individual bottle pricing.  The Old Rasputin poured from the 12 oz brown bottle into a pint glass to produce a 1/2"" dense tan head over a black beer.  The scent was very aromatic with shades of coffee, chocolate and malt sweetness.  The taste was very good. In keeping with style and on par with the aroma, chocolate, coffee and and nice malt sweetness prevail.  Mouthfeel: Not as heavy as expected. Carbonation is a slight bit higher than most RIS's I've had. I enjoy the chalkiness of this beer.  Drinkability: Typical of the higher ABV of most RIS... proceed with caution, but you can have as many of these as your body will allow. I will look for this again.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,jamie2dope,3.97,"This is one of those beers I have had lots of times, but never bothered to review. It poured into a mini Old Rasputin pint glass a dark brown, with ruby hues toward the bottom of the glass. Aroma was filled with milk chocolate, sweet bread and powdered sugar. Taste starts off rather sweet, with more of the milk chocolate coming through. Towards the end it becomes a bit more roasty and bitter, leaving a burnt coffee flavor on the palate. I would say the body of this beer is medium for an Imperial Stout. Alcohol does not seem prominent at all. A four pack of this brew did well for me. This is a great brew that is always reliable. Cheers",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,AlephNull,4.26,"A- Pours black as the darkest night. There's no light that gets through this one held up to the brightest of lights. The head takes a while to grow, and disappears to a thin ring around the glass quickly as well. It leaves a heavy lacing that drips back down the glass.  S- Toasted malts dominate with a chocolaty flavor over all others. There's a nice burnt grain that follows closing with a hint of sweet cherry.  T- Mmm... toasty goodness opens with roasted grains, quite a variety to these grain flavors that develop briefly into a bit of a coffee flavor.  M- Always an issue with strong stouts, this comes of as a bit chalky, but this has a bit of an oily basis behind it. Less chalky than many other high alcohol stouts, it's not too bad on the palate, but very dry.  D- While I really enjoy this, it's primarily on an intellectual level. Not an everyday beer. The dryness of this beer is perhaps a little overwhelming.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,baos,4.82,Beer is black as night coming out of the bottle with a nice dark oatmeal head more of a head than i expected from this black beer. Has a nice roasted caramel bouquet. On the first sip its all coffee and unsweetened chocolate but this melds with the bitter albeit piny aftertaste. A truly remarkable beer.,North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,LeftyBWS,3.95,"On tap at the Publick House, Brookline, MA. Served in a smaller glass, somewhere between a shot and a pint. A: When it arrived in front of me, I could see three layers. The bottom third was very deep, dark brown; in the middle was a much lighter, café au lait color brown; on top was the very creamy and thick head. As a minute or so passed, the dark brown gobbled up the middle layer and the head very slowly but surely receded. An intriguing effect, to say the least. S: Smells of roasted coffee, chocolate, and perhaps some sweet toffee. There were also notes of raisins, and maybe a buried cherry flavor, like chocolate-covered fruit. T: Very imperial and stoutish. I can definitely taste the coffee, chocolate and raisiny notes. Somewhat bitter mid- and aftertaste. M: Thick, creamy and heavy. Just what I expected. D: This roughly half-pint was plenty for me. It tastes great and is a beer I would get again, but any more than a pint would take work, especially with a meal.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,khiasmus,4.28,"A- Black with ruby highlights when held to the light. Poured with two fingers of dense, fluffy head into my snifter, that soon settled to a ring... can't ask for more at 9%.  S- Roasted grain, dark malt, charcoal, coffee, chocolate, molasses, alcohol. Smells excellent.  T- Initially thick, sweet malt, followed immediately by dark roasted grain and alcohol. Hints of soy sauce, sherry, chocolate, coffee, honey, cane sugar, and burnt bread crust. Wonderful.  M- I actually noticed the mouthfeel more than the taste on my first sip. Thick, chewy, medium carbonation, full bodied, leaves a slightly dry feeling at the back of your tongue, but the rest of your mouth feels coated in oil. I can't give it a five, though... Dark Lord has ruined me forever from giving fives in this style.  D- Quite good, especially for the 9%. I wouldn't drink it all the time, but if it was readily available... sigh. I'd be a happy man.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,largadeer,4.34,"Nitro-tap, served in a tulip glass.  Appearance: Pitch-black with a huge, dense and frothy nitro head.  Smell: Dark chocolate and burnt grains.  Taste & mouthfeel: Unbelievably rich and creamy. Baker's chocolate, espresso, toast and chocolate pudding. Hops are very much present in the finish, providing a balancing bitterness.  Drinkability: Not necessarily sessionable, but as close as I've found in an imperial stout. Despite the high ABV, this is incredibly smooth and drinkable.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Night,4.23,"Pours pitch black with some dark crimson to brown flecks. Very large, bubbly, light-brown head with a good amount of cream and lots of arced lacing. Aroma is warm and woozy: prunes, spruce resin, milk chocolate, cream, vanilla, some red wine, and lots of alcohol. Mouthfeel is juicy and creamy. Flavor is mildly sweet with chocolate and molasses backed by a somewhat milder acidic coffee / grass and a deep, rich hop spice. Notes of custard and dark fruit throughout. Deep roast with charcoal in the finish; burnt meaty aftertaste.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,tempest,4.03,"Served in a Westy chalice and it looks beautiful. Smells and drinks with a mellow chocolate and roasted malt backbone. It's a nice flavor, but I can't pull a lot of depth from it.

Highly recommended.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,cjhofelt,2.93,"This beer is almost opaque (as a stout should be) but if you shine a bright enough light to it, it's actually magenta in color. Thin head that fades to a thin film.  The smell is hard to describe. It's fruity on top of a strong malt aroma. I'm not so sure I like it.  Well, it's not too bad. There's a tasty maltyness up front followed by a fruity flavor then finishes up with coffee, chocolate, and finally, something like, well, a bit like Juicey-Fruit gum and alcohol, as one of the low reviewers said. In some ways, this tastes a bit like a winter warmer. There's also sort of a back flavor here that's reminiscent of other North Coast beers. I'm not sure what to call it other than the North Coast taste.  Heavy mouthfeel, a bit chewey and syrupy. Not a real thirst quencher, more of a hunger quencher.  Something good to drink on a chilly night. I like it, but I've had better RIS. Worth a try.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,bunnyhustle,4.1,"First stout reviewed, not typically a fan but this was a treat. Received as a gift from an employee and was hesitant to drink due to it not normally being my style and the high alcohol content. Pours dark, virtually black, with nice thick, tan head. Head stays around and leaves great lace. Smell is of coffee mainly but some chocolate as well and a little bit of alochol (only a little). Looks good...smells good...taste...its good too. Very thick and creamy, low carbonation and strong coffee (cant pinpoint what kind as I'm not a coffee drinker) and nice taste of chocolate at the end, little bit of alcohol taste but its hidden beneath everything else. The most complex tasting beer I have ever reviewed. For being so strong and thick you hardly notice, great mouthfeel, great beer.

112,412,Halcyondays,4.25,"12 oz. bottle, #50 review.  A: Dark opaque black, with tan head, good retention. The bottle has a picture of that psychotic Russian mystic that helped put an end to Nicholas II's reign.  S: Robust, smells of heavily roasted malts/French roast coffee, dark chocolate, soy sauce, fig, raisin, a bit of citric hops, but it is faint.  T: Not as thick and robust as I would have thought. Tastes of roasted malts predominately, with good amounts of coffee and chocolate. A little to burnt for my tastes, but this is a minor technicality.  M: Smooth, rich, creamy, this is how an RIS should feel. Not overbearing, but the perfect balance of robustness and smooth dessert like feel.  D: A delicious tasty brew, worth its accolades. Not that expensive in this neck of the woods, and its even available at my local Vons. A classic brew, that is a good choice for RIS fans low on cash and looking for a thick warming dessert-type beer. Would think this would be the perfect complement to rich chocolate cake.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Nesued,4.45,"Appearance - Served this one a bit warmer than recommended temp. I just couldn't wait to get a hold of this one. Poured a jet black color with a very big head forming upon pour. The carbonation reminded me of what the Westy 12 looked like (i.e. very small fine carbonation bubbles). The head was a very dense frothy tan coloring that clinged to the glass.  Smell - Bold aroma of sweet malt and candy. Also coming to the show was a chocolate/caramel aroma that offered a more practical frame of reference. A bit yeasty as well. Bring the beer to your nose. Note the beer's aromatic qualities. I didn't really get a sense of a hop presence.  Taste - If I closed my eyes, I would have not thought this was as dark of a malty beer as my first taste. The hop hits you square in the taste buds and marks it's turf. The citric/hop was at first both unexpected and overwhelming, but the malty body did come to the show. I didn't get a feel for the alcohol during the entire sampling.   Mouthfeel - The carbonation really didn't add much to the transportation of this beer. The body was fully due to the malt/hop one-two punch. This was a very chewy/dense beer that made it's presence known to your mouth, in a good way. As it slid down, be thinking about the hops, 'cause they will be thinking of you.  Drinkability - A nice sipping beer to end the day. I really enjoyed this one. One of my top Russian Imperial Stouts.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,iconoklaztor,3.93,12 oz bottle at 55 degrees  A: Great appearance! Dark stout but not much of a head. I poured it fairly fast too. What head that did appear was an amazing tan color. I wish the head was bigger  S: Smell is good! Smells like a stout. Enough said  T: Finally! The taste it great. (takes a sip) First taste is a chocolate taste and near the finish comes the coffee taste. Its well balanced and simply tasty...note the slight alcohol taste  M: The mouthfeel is nice a firm. Stays on the tounge for many mins. I like the boldness of this stout and how it takes your tounge hostage. By the time its about to surrender you take another sip and the waiting beings again!  D: not very drinkable due to the noted mouthfeel  I enjoy this stout and for 2.50 its a steal!,North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,OKCNittany,4.85,"12 oz bottle in a pint glass  A: 3/4"" tan head - beautiful black body. Head thinned fairly quickly, but left a nice lacing.  S: Rich, powerful aroma with coffee the strongest. Roasted malt & alcohol quite noticible. Some chocolate & plenty more.  T: Big, rich expresso flavor. Plenty of hoppy bitterness, but the malts win - chocolate lovers will not be disappointed. Alcohol is present, but it's completely overwhelmed by everything else going on and not a problem at all (unless you're driving). Dark fruits are present as well, but does not interfere with the roasted/burnt malts. Man I love this beer.  M: Very smooth & creamy despite the alcohol presence. Perfect (light) carbonation for the taste. A loooong lasting dry finish - very tasty & still sweet.  D: Spectacular beer - one of my top 5. I will never tire of this beer. However, hide the women and children - this beer does not fool around. Also, at 9% abv, if I ever find this beer in a bar in OKC, someone better take my keys.  The only real flaw here is that I just finished the 4-pack. Damn North Coast for not making it a 6-pack!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Mechphisto,3.08,"A- A nice, rich opaque black pour. Not too thick of a head, but a nice soft tan. Doesn't last long, but keeps a lacing a decent time.  S- A toasted chocolate coffee smell. Rich, deep smell. Not complex, per se, but the notes change as you smell it and as it warms up.  T- Just like it smells, rich chocolate coffee--but a HEAVY toasted nut taste as well. Very bitter, almost burnt nut taste. Like a coffee brewed with ground burnt nuts with a touch of chocolate.  M- Very creamy, rich, thick. Chewable. Bitter on the back of the palate but doesn't stay around longer than appreciated.  D- Can only handle one, being very thick, stout, filling. You want to drink it slow and savor it (I dare anyone to drink it fast,) which helps that the taste and aroma changes as the temperature changes. Unfortunately it gets TOO bitter toward room temperature.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,josiahschlender,4.6,"The stubby bottle in a little four-pack belies how huge this beer is. Yeah, Rasputin looks cool, but the real stuff comes with the syrupy pour into a pint glass. Medium, very brown head with decent retention. Very dark lace, also has medium lasting length. The beer itself is very dark, not quite black.  Very rich, sweet smell dominated by chocolate. I also detect an undercurrent of earthy hops, possibly even yeast? Some alcohol present in the aroma, as well.  Taste is sweet, earthy, explosive, complex, prolonged. Wow, lots going on here. Lots of dark chocolate and some coffee. Not a mocha though. More like bitter baker's chocolate melted in espresso. The dark roasted malt manages to be very sweet while tasting burnt. Hops are also surprisingly strong and bitter. It's earthy, very well complimenting the baker's chocolate malts. Tastes keep lingering long after swallowing.  Mouthfeel is very thick, full and creamy. Little carbonation. Surprisingly little alcohol bite or taste for being 9%. It's there, but it's masked. I more realized it after I finished the glass.  Wow, this is an excellent stout. It's powerful, a meal to itself, but doesn't punish. Extremely well balanced. I'll be coming back to this one.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,letsgopens,4.4,"I love the bottle art. I'm not sure why but for some reason I have a n overwhelming urge to tattoo it on my face. Anyway, this selection pours a dark brown, near black with amber highlights and a rocky light mocha head that holds well and recedes in to a dense cap with solid lace.  The aroma is heavy and malty with coffee and and some dark cocoa in the finish. Very nice.  This is a very favorable brew. Strong and pronounced with spent coffee grounds, dark cocoa, roasty malt, and a welcomed alcoholic warmth in the finish.  Thick and moderately heavy mouthfeel. Nice and smooth.

112,412,StonyB,4.53,"What new can be said about this modern classic? Suffice to say, when I took a mixed 6-pack home from Andy's Corner Bar the other day, there was no doubt a bottle of this Russian Imperial heaven would be included...  12 ounce brown bottle. Cool, slightly sinister label. Oh, that rascally Rasputin...  Appearance - Silky smooth pour, generates a beautiful, rocky, two-fingered head of foam. Lacing pasted all around my goblet (had to break out the appropriate glass here). Nearly jet black, opaque. Like the perfect cake, it's almost a shame to disturb it...you just wanna stare...  Smell - If Hershey's melted one of their milk chocolate bars, and added alcohol, I still don't think it would smell more chocolaty than this. Malt bomb. Make that a malted milk bomb...  Taste - Um, wow. Combination of sweet milk chocolate, balanced by a roasty, slightly tar-like bitterness. With time, reveals some fruity notes, as well as an increasingly warming belt of alcohol. Yum.  Mouthfeel - Viscous, chewy. Just enough carbonation to remind you you're drinking a beer, not a milkshake.  Drinkability - Well, it depends on how you define drinkability. Clearly, this 9% ABV malt assault doesn't easily lend itself to sessions. But is it easy and enjoyable to drink? You bet your balalakas it is...  If the Russian Czars were around today, this might be the stout they would import. A beautifully crafted, delicious beer. Highly recommended.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Pours a tan very chunky three fingers of head nice head rentention.  Aromas: Large amounts of very dark roasted coffee or espresso. The malts in this pint of darkness are roasted something dark wow. The chocolate notes are incredible.  Taste: The coffee chocolate and espresso flavors stand out absolutely perfectly. The dark roasted malts roam all around the palate nice and slowly. The mouthfeel is beyond creamy it's like silk remarkably smooth and smooth is an understatement.  Notes: My fellow Beer Advocates this Russian Imperial stout is the Czar of Russian Imperial stouts.

112,412,jjayjaye,4.35,"Gave it about 30 minutes to warm up outta the frig. Pours an opaque darkness with a huge stiff tan head that resists fading. A good amount of lacing, some of it in 3-dimension.  The aroma has it's own complexity; shifting around a bit. On the initial pour the foam released a smell of hops that i wasn't expecting. It also gave off a vanilla-whiskey character. As the head settles down you get a sweet syrupy malt that's lightly roasted...like a number of double stouts i can think of.  Full bodied, the mouth feel is creamy and adequately carbonated. The flavor fills the mouth but it doesn't give you that coating sensation. The flavor is a lightly roasted malt and the complementary texture takes it to a light mocha zone. Has an enjoyably light lingering chocolate coffee aftertaste.  Quite drinkable.

112,412,bluemoonswoon,4.15,"12oz bottle poured into a pint glass, no freshness date.  A: Pours a deep dark amber almost black, with a thick tan head that fades into a thickish cap with very nice lacing. A decent cascading effect when first poured into glass fades when head forms, very pretty beer.  S: I could smell this stuff as soon as I opened this thing. When it finally all gets in the glass a big chocolate aroma greets the nose, lingering a bit longer over the glass and with a bit of agitation fermented fruits begin to appear, apples and grapes tied together with a thick carmel scent, very inviting.  T/MF: I'm not used to drinking stouts but I have to say that this is not only one of the best stouts I've tasted, but one of the best beers I've ever had. That being said the beer slides over the entire pallate, super rich and creamy as to be expected, incredibly thick and pleasing. The tastes are everywhere and beautifly balanced, coffee and chocolate appear first with sweet molasas and carmel, I almost don't want to swallow because this beer tastes so good. There are also nice hints of fruit that helps balance the intense chocolate and coffee flavors, excellent, excellent beer.  D: No matter what the occasion I would have no qualms about drinking this beer, though I imagine it would be even better paired with some rich chocolates while sitting in a big high backed chair with a large bearskin rug covering the floor next to a roaring fire.

Hints of chocolate and coffee. Burnt charcoal flavor with a mild chocolate background. Excellent bitter-chocolate aftertaste on the tongue. Mouthfeel is full and thick, like a layer of charred steak on the tongue. Not much expansion, a little more carbonation might spread the good stuff around. Probably two at the most in one session.

112,412,wanker,3.45,"It is mandatory that you let this beer warm before drinking it - what a difference it makes.  When I take my first sips right from the fridge, the hops are way too harsh, making the beer unbalanced and killing the other flavors. But -- if you let it warm up some -- the hops mellow out and the other flavors come through. The beer then becomes nice and balanced.  This is a good, complex imperial stout. A bit too syrupy in the finish for me, but not as syrupy as Samuel Smiths.  Given the choice, I'd prefer Victory Storm King, my favorite impy stout.

Appearance is a perfect black brew with a little bit of light sneaking in at the edges and a beautiful tan head with lots of sticky retention. This is probably my favorite smelling imperial stout; mocha, malted milk and dark chocolate aromas dominate. Tastes are these same flavors but with an alcohol warmth and a hoppy balance. Old rasputin is creamier than most imperial stouts and has a thick mouthfeel. Drinkability is high for the style but this is still a sipping beer.

112,412,jettjon,3.76,"From a 12 oz bottle into a pint glass. A vigorous pour yields an utterly opaque pitch brown color with a huge, milk-chocolate brown head that fades away at a moderate pace. Heavy cap and plenty of clingy lace remain. This is certainly a fine looking stout. Nose is somewhat subdued with milk chocolate, cocoa, and sweet malt in evidence. Taste is bittersweet with biting hops and toasted malts complementing a dry, dark chocolate/powdery cocoa flavor. Bitterness is high, so if thats your cup of tea, you should enjoy this. However, I am not a fan of highly bitter stouts, so this detracted for me. There are hints of dark fruit sweetness (cherries?) but it doesnt do much to balance the bitterness. Despite 9% ABV, no real alcohol presence. Mouth seems a bit thin for a stout but thickens as the beer warms substantially past what Id normally serve at (typically 50-55 degrees). Semi-syrupy-creamy with mild, smooth carbonation; just not as chewy as Id prefer. Drinkability is merely OK for me; the bitterness just turns me off.  Overall: This is a highly rated imperial stout but obviously I was not as impressed as most people have been. Its a great looking stout to be sure, but its seriously aligned toward the bitter end of the spectrum, which to me overwhelms the underlying flavor complexity. Definitely allow this one to warm up for maximum viscosity and mellowness. Certainly worth a try; Im just not certain that it lives up to its reputation. Maybe Ill try another batch next year.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,EmilNoldSinclair,4.23,"Gave this sucker a hard pour and got a nice head out of it that retained decently enough. The head is tan brown and the bubbles are very small and leave a few occasional strands clinging to the glass. An almost opaque black motor oil appearance, but held up to the light it looks like a very very dark reddish brown. Sweet smell of prunes, raisins, dark chocolate (standard), and ethanol. Nice. An initial flash of bitterness that mellows out in the middle to the typical dark chocolate taste but also with a sweetness like currants. The aftertaste smooths out even more. Very pleasant. Full bodied with medium carbonation. Can hardly taste the alcohol, and could drink this until I die. It feels like a session beer until you realize that it's twice the abv. This is a good imperial stout available year around, but I either prefer something with stronger flavor (Stone) or complexity (Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout).",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Poured it into a pint glass, absolutely black and abysmal, just perfect for the style. Smelled of burnt coffee and bbq'd meat (maybe that's casue I'm hungry). Tastes of chocolate and coffee, with a nice little bit of heat at the end, warms the belly nicely. Overall, a very nice beer.

Poured into a brandy snifter - I don't know if this is the proper glassware, but I love how it opens up the flavors and warms it. Nice, oily black color, completely opaque, with a thin, tan head. Very good retention - left rings around the glass. Smells and tastes of all sorts of dark wonderfulness: cherries, dark roast coffee, some dark chocolate, raisins, red grapes. At times the aromas reminded me of a great red wine - a tad woody, smoky, and spicy. Lots of complexity all around, and the flavors and aromas changed as it warmed up in my hand. Thick, heavy mouthfeel - not too creamy - it fits the character well. Overall, a very drinkable beer - highly recommended.

112,412,JerzDevl2000,4.92,"Saw this at a local liquor store and was amazed that this was actually being sold in my neck of the woods. I heard good things about this on here, and even though I'm not an aficianado of this style, and it's not the time of the year to drink stouts, I took the plunge and gave this a shot. Thankfully, I made the right choice, as I'm having to pace my drinking. That's the only way I've had any left in my glass, as I write this review!  The pour was one of the best I've ever seen or smelled - hands down. A nice, deep brown hue could be seen with some light around the edges. The roasted, toffee-like aroma filled my glass and quite a bit outside of that, as the head nearly overflowed. The sight of the bubbles and their long-lasting duration was quite a sight to behold, and the taste lived up to that and the smell that I could discern. The toffee was present there too, with notes of dark chocolate, caramel, and coffee tossed in. What amazed me the most was the smoothness. The few stouts that I've had all had one thing in common, and that was their bite. Alcohol could be felt front to back, and it didn't take long before the flavors were overpowered by that trait. In this case, that never happened. The flavors lingered beautifully and the dark chocolate lingered long after I finished each sip. It was only when I started to feel buzzed did I realize how strong this was.  Yes, I know that I'm not the most experienced when I come to this style, but I'd have to wholeheartedly say that this is worth the hype and a great introduction to this style for novices like me. The mouthfeel is enjoyable and solid, and there's not bitterness to be felt here. Just richly deep layers of flavor, and plenty to ponder between sips. No wonder this comes in 4-packs - I'm not quite sure that I could handle six of these!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

The nose was roasted, slightly smokey, a little burnt. The mouthfeel wasnt as creamy as some stouts--but not thin or watery at all. This stout was not dry, rather a bit sticky and syrupy. The moderately strong alcohol (8.9%) was not noticeable at all. The taste was very nice.

Bittersweet chocolate, coffee, creme brule, some spice and dark fruit also show up in this complex taste experience. Good hop bitterness on the finish to leave you wanting more.  Really nice, leaves a whole bitterness in your mouth after each drink that gives the impression of a bittersweet chocolate coating rather than gripping hop lupulin.

112,412,SaltyLime,4.7,"Appearance - it's a Russian Imperial Stout, if you don't already know how nice these look, you better go out and get one!  Smell - Robust malts and solid presence of alcohol.  Taste - I was holding the bottle up to read while I sipped this from a pint glass at a friend's house. Then I felt the beer punch me in the face. I had a couple of other much larger bottles on standby to drink after this one and mistakingly made the bad correlation of little bottle / little beer.Do not make the same mistake. This had a quality mix of ingredients. Two big swigs and I already started to wobble. My alibi is that we were hauling rocks for a landscaping project.  Mouthfeel - Solid. Nice thickness. Left a film of flavors inside my mouth. Not sure if it was a good thing or a bad thing. But I wasn't trying to suck it off my tongue like when you get something too yeasty.  Drinkability - This is becoming my favorite, but I can't drink too many at a time. Respect it, I think Rasputin would have.

The aroma is heavily consisted of roasted malts and coffee. The taste is just amazing!! Strong roasted malt bitterness, coffee, and good amount of chocolate sweetness. Alcohol is not detectible, suprisingly being 9%. Mouthfeel is thick and extremely smooth. No harsh finish associated with other RIS. Drinkability is high, except for the abv.

112,412,baxterbrew,4.75,"So, I'm about to brew a RIS so I thought I'd stop at the local beer store. Picked up this crazy looking bottle with the cursing Rasputin on the label.  Poured it out into a pint glass and it is darker than dark...blacker than black. A hint of red when brought to a bright light. The head is voluptuous but fades quickly with minimal lacing.  The smell is pure, unadulterated malt with a hint of come hither alcohol. I was a little intimidated but it drew me in. It said, 'come closer, I won't hurt you.""  The taste is very complex. There is a strong coffee/espresso taste upfront and you can definitely get the hops - they are kickin' maybe a little too much (dry hopped maybe?). Very astringent, almost made me want to pucker. The thing that really surprised me was the overwhelming sweetness of the aftertaste. Sugary almost overpowers the hops. You're left with a mix of the sweet and the bitter. Nice warmness in the belly when the alcohol rams its way home. One of those beers that makes you sit and think on what made this happen.  Mouthfeel is there and very heavy but not as heavy as one would think in a beer this heavy. There is an oily component but the astringency drives it away.  Drinkability- wouldn't want to drink more than a couple. Might be scary!  A very good beer especially given the style. This one is a good one to show new BAs.

112,412,MiguelMandingo,4.04,"This is my fourth review, and my first for a RIS. I have tried to sample a few RISs over the past several weeks to get a feel for the style before trying to write a review for one. So far I have really enjoyed how complex they tend to be. Oak Aged Yeti, Stormking, along with Old Rasputin have been my favorites so far.  Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance- Not bad looking for a stout (but tends to scare off anyone that I drink it in front of that hasn't experienced the glory that is a RIS). It is opaque coffee black in color with a foamy milk chocolate 1 1/2 finger head. The head doesn't last as long as I would like, and there is no lacing to speak of - which is where it loses points with me. When I swirl the glass the beer washes any would-be lacing from the glass and leaves oily black streaks.  Smell - The smell is awesome. Coffee, roasted malt, dark chocolate, and alcohol.  Taste - This is another one of those beers that smells pretty much just like it tastes. It had an spresso and roasted malt front that bleeds into dark chocolate and hops end.  Mouthfeel - This isn't the thickest beer I have had, but it is pretty thick. It coats the mouth with a pretty oily texture. The carbonation saves it for me - just enough to break up the oil so-to-speak.  Drinkability - It has a pretty good drinkability despite the mouthfeel. It goes down very smooth, very easy. It took about 30 minutes for me to finish, but I would probably limit myself to 2 of these in a night.  Overall a very good beer. I was impressed. And not a bad RIS to start with if you have never experienced the style. Try pairing it with some dark chocolate after a hearty meal - it makes an excellent dessert.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,shadow1961,3.98,"North Coast Brewing's Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout pours out a lovely thick chocolate colored head over an opaque black brew. The nose is raisin, coffee, and booze. Carbonation is steady. The flavor is coffee up front, with a sharp finish of bitter chocolate and hops. The alcohol (9% by volume) is well moderated by the strong flavors of the beer. The mouthfeel is surprisingly light for such a dark brew, and a bit dry as well. The aftertaste is grassy hop.

T: The flavor is much like the aroma, with a very sweet background containing a bunch of malt and chocolate. There is a bite in the end of the taste from the roasted malt and hop bitterness. Unfortunately the alcohol is detectable in the flavor.  M: This is a good full bodied beer, although the alcohol presence does detract slightly.

The foamy head falls quickly, but leaves its mark behind on the glass, also staying as a thin ring until the end.  The first scent I picked up on was chocolate, shortly followed by coffee. Roasted malts take the stage as the aroma works its way into fruity smells, such as figs and oranges. After warming a little, floral hops come into play. No scent really overpowers the blend, very well-balanced aroma. Very subtle, but wonderfully complex.  Roasted is an understatement, charred malt is the first to come followed by burnt coffee grounds. This is the most roasted, toasted beverage I've ever had. There is a dry hops taste toward the finish, topped off with a citrusy sweetness. Also notable in the flavor are dark chocolate and alcohol.  Heavy, full-bodied with a slight dryness at the end. Pretty minimal amount of carbonation, not even noticeable. The alcohol can be a little much at times, making its drinkability fall.

I bought 8 of these to lay down, but wanted to have a fresh one first (I've only had this once before, on draft, a few months ago).

The Monk Rasputin lost his balls on his assassination. This beer has not. It has all the requisite Russian Imperial Stout qualities: somewhat bitter, somehow caffeinated, and so on. Its suchness as an example of the style rests in how it combines the elements. The mouth feel starts as a hoppy/espresso-ish annunciation somewhere on the outskirts of taste and rises to ride through one's oral cavity, like a Cossack cavalry charge. That done, it retires to rest on the back of the tongue, awaiting recall. I can't exactly explain how, but the story that Rasputin was a womanizing peasant mystic fits this brew ...

Slight alcohol fumes show up at the backend.  Flavor is layered more than the aroma. The roasted malts set the stage for waves of chocolate followed by the freshly ground coffee beans. The nuttiness and a hint of vanilla glide through on the swallow and mellow things out before the fusel alcohol hits in the throat. A light coffee ground bitterness lingers nicely.  Body is on the heavy side of medium but is supremely smooth. Velvety with a nice alcohol warmth in the throat.  This is a very easy drinking Imp. stout. Very enjoyable and if the weather is right one I can easily drink numerous bottles of.  This is my go to stout. Easy to find and the price for such a tasty Imp. Stout is unbeatable. A classic and for good reason.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,kajerm,3.85,"Pours black, totally opaque with a thin, intriguingly asymmetric ring of tan foam; good lacing.  Huge coffee nose, with dark-roasted malt and a little bit of semisweet chocolate. Some yeasty/alcoholic spiciness.  Coffee is definitely evident from beginning to end, with some hops and even more black malt bitterness. There is a strong background flavor of dark chocolate. The alcohol is clearly evident, and that's not necessarily a bad thing.  The mouthfeel was initially disapointing; the palate was thin and overcarbonated, but it inexplicably settled down and turned into a proper imperial stout-- super creamy and chewy. Nice.  Drinkability is about what you'd expect for an imp, no surprises here.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,crayphish,4.03,"The Russian Imperial Stout pours a midnight black, nice dark khaki head. Decent lacing. Smell is strong roasted malts and coffee. Alcohol and hops in there as well. Some sweet chocolate. Taste is the roasted malts and chocolate. Some alcohol here as well. Good balance between the sweet and bitter.Mouthfeel starts full and finishes fairly dry. Very enjoyable.

112,412,Jmamay22,4.25,"Appearance - Pitch black brew with a half inch of head that settles and leaves minimal lacing.  Smell - Heavy roasted malt and coffee smell.  Taste - Strong alcohol taste and coffee and hops balance out the heavy roasted malts, but clearly the malts win this battle. Alcohol can be a bit much.  Moutfeel - A sipper as its fairly heavy and a very thick rich flavor. Lightly carbonated as this sort of brew should be.  Drinkability - I could never see myself having more than one unless I was horribly snowed in with nothing better to do with my time. That said its always a great one and done.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,SacoDeToro,4.2,"On tap at the North Coast Brewpub across the street from the brewery.  The beer poured a deep coal black with a small brown head.  The aroma of the beer was full of rich coffee, roasted malts, dark chocolate, and some faint vanilla.  The flavor of the beer was full of intense flavors that transitioned well from one to another. Coffee - Chocolate - Rich roasted malts. The hops were there in good presence, but not too intense.  The mouthfeel was thick, but not too heavy. It coated your mouth with a ton of flavor. The carbonation seemed dialed in well.  This is a great beer and a very drinkable RIS. It's an American classic and the beer that brought this style back from the brink of extinction.

T - Strong alcohol esters over coffee and chocolate. Nice bitter balance to the sweetness, but alcohol is almost too much.  M - A touch heavy, but very creamy and rich.  D - This is a one and done brew. Very good, but high ABV makes it an occasional item.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,DoubleJ,4.49,"My first Russian Imperial Stout. Will I bow down before Rasputin? Or will I persevere through the 12 oz serving? On to the beer:  It pours pitch black in a glass. One smell from the beer brings lots of flaovrs to the nose. Fruity, piney, chocolate, raw cane sugar, and alcohol flavors run around freely. This stuff is extremely complex, but I assume thats the nature of RIS's. A light roasted bitterness sits on the tongue after every sip, reminding me it's still a stout, but a very beefed-up one. At less than $2 for the bottle, it didn't drain my wallet, and I got something new and exciting.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,BradBLR,4.42,"This beer poured a very dark brown (almost black) with a chocolate brown head, that lasted most of the beer with very thick lacing. The smell of this beer was a tart chocolate aroma with a toasted malt smell accompanied by a hint of hops.  The taste was very malty chocolate flavor with a slightly dry malt and with a nice kick of hops at the end. Not as sweet as some RIS's and that is a good thing, very tasty. The mouthfeel of this beer was really good, very thick almost syrup, a beer that you could literally chew on. C02 slightly week, but hardly worth noting.  Great beer, especially if you like RIS's. Give it a try!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Aroma is of coffee, dark chocolate, roasted malts, toffee and some hazelnut. Interesting.  Taste is dominated by bitter dark coffee. Also some dark chocolate, roasted malts and some alcohol at the end.  Mouthfeel has a medium body and lightly dry at the end.  Overall, this is an interesting brew that I wouldn't mind having again.

Aroma has a surprisingly fruity nose: fig & plum. Of course, the roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate notes are strong on this one.  Taste is quite chocolatey and has a nice roasted maltiness to it. Feels smooth, yet full-bodied with a nice bitter coffee bite saved for the back of the tongue and throat. I'll be having this one again for sure, good taste & complexity.

112,412,kdoc8,4.42,"I found this on sale for $1.79 at the Franklin Market of Choice in Eugene, OR. It pours out a dark, dark black color with very little shades of red-brown. It pours with a thick, tan bubbly/creamy head and lots and lots of lacing. The smell is very subtle but complex - chocolate and roasted malts dominate. I has a bubbly mouthfeel and starts out with a taste of chocolate and then finishes with a great chocolate and coffee blended taste that just keeps going. The complexity of the taste takes a few seconds to hit you after swallowing. An excellent RI stout - almost no taste of alcohol at all.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Melchizedek,4,"Pours a nice brown into an opaque black, with a big tan head that settles into a nice cap and sticky lace.  In the nose, plenty of roasted barley and resiny hop, and a strong coffee-like aroma. Not overly bitter in the mouth, but with that aroma coming through strongly. Coffee matched by a caramel malt flavor, and the mouthfeel isn't too heavy but very substantial. A little harder to find the hops than in the aroma, but they're there, helping keep things from getting sweet. Alcohol isn't prominent, but noticeable.  This is just a really tasty imperial stout all around. Can't find fault with it. I think I'll have to make it a go-to.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,barefootbrewer,3.92,"This beer is black and has a nice tan/cream colored head  lacing is pretty in this beer. The aroma is sweet of malt and there is some spice that Im having trouble identifying. The taste is bold and bitter. There is plenty of malt and a slight sweetness. Coffee flavors and a hint of spice are present. This beer starts off quite intimidating, but mellows slightly as it warms and my palate adjusts.

The beer poured coffee black, with a light brown head about one-half inch thick. It smelled of coffee and chocolate. It tasted great, but had a little alcohol burn in the aftertaste.

Smells of highly roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, vanilla and some dried fruit. How do you describe the taste of this stuff. Heavy roasted malts with espresso like flavors, chocolate, dried fruits and alcohol in the finish. Almost like a dubble or triple but made with roasted malts. Smooth and creamy. Highly complex.

I dont know if I could drink multiple of these cause of the abv content but it is pretty well hidden,let see when it warms.I think OLD RASPY won this war.I would say to the people who want to know what is compares between,its more bolder then Stormking but not as Czar.Very good indeed.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,travelfrog,4.43,"I tried this interesting stout at my favorite local pizza pub/watering hole. It was on draught, served in a brandy snifter of all things.  Appearance was very good, with a nice creamy dark complexion and creamy head (perhaps exaggerated somewhat by the dimensions of my snifter). There were a few air bubbles mixed in, and the beverage was less opaque than I would have expected.  Aroma was good, again perhaps concentrated by the snifter. Notes of malt and chocolate.  The flavor will come as quite a surprise to Guinness drinkers (remember this is Imperial Stout... ;). A bold combination of sherry, malt, coffee, and chocolate. Pleasant, lingering aftertaste of caffe corretto.  Mouthfeel was excellent: smooth and creamy with no burn or cloying on the roof of the mouth.  I also have to rate the drinkability quite highly for a stout, though it is certainly best sipped rather than gulped. I would not have known it was 9% alcohol if I hadn't read it on this page.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Luchman,4.17,"A: Black body with a 1 1/2 finger, light tan head that dissipates fairly quickly leaving great lacing on the sides and clumps on the top.  S: Roasted malts, coffee, and chocolate hit the nose first. Some light hops, alcohol, molasses, and slight burnt grain are there as well. Smells pretty darn good.  T: Matches smell, but only better. Great coffee/roasted malts, graininess, definitely chocolate, some dark fruits (plums, currents, etc.) and some nice hops to add to it. Some boozy alcohol is there that increases as the temperature rises. Has a dry finish. Damn... This stuff is better than I remembered.  M: Fits it nicely. Medium/full body with medium carbonation that goes done as easy as can be!  D: Not bad... Not bad at all. A very good tasting stout that I once thought to be over rated. Alcohol booziness gets there a tad bit in the end, which no doubt they intended it that way, but lowers my drinkability rating a .5.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Taste: Wonderful imperial stout here. The roasted malts give way to some earthy chocolate, and espresso beans. There are some wonderful hop bitterness at the end and some roasted nuts in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Creamy with some slight carbonation which excites the taste buds and allows the bitter chocolate espresso to seep in.  Drinkability: This is a wonderful stout.

112,412,udubdawg,4.75,"12 oz bottle.  Pours a nearly black color, thick but not nearly as syrapy as many of the style. Big rocky brown head that subsides to a third, and then lingers. Pretty nice lacing.  Nose isn't as strong as I expected, but improving throughout the glass as it warms. Notes of dark chocolate and coffee...liquorice?...definately fruity - almost vinous...and behind it all, a bit of floral. Some alcohol, and an overall intriguing complexity despite the lack of overpowering aroma.  Adult milk shake - that was my first thought. On the full side of medium bodied and intense. Definately big carmelized sugar sweetness, with just the right amount of lingering bittersweet chocolate and hops in the finish. Roasty malts mostly short of charred - delicious. Where is the alcohol? - none of the strength noted in the aroma is here. Extremely smooth and coats the tongue nicely.  I simply cannot sip this beer - it screams a ""5"" on drinkability, but if I drank as many now as I'd like, I'd be under the table talking to my shoe. Gotta knock this one a touch.

112,412,jjmunro,4.04,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.  A: A beautiful midnight black, as expected for Imperial Stouts. A healthy, mocha head shrank, but remained throughout the beer.  S: I was not overwhelmed by the smell. I was able to pick up apples and brown sugar. The only facet of the beer that I was not wow'ed by. There is a distinct smell, but it was just kind of average for me.  T: Rich and earthy taste that is instantly quite impressive. It was a pleasing, lingering taste that was not overpowering by any stretch of the imagination, a rarity for many American Imperial Stouts. This beer was extremely well crafted, the alcohol content was designed to be apparent, but surprisingly smooth for the style. Many compliments to the brewers of this fine stout.  M: Again, very nice for the style. Unlike many Imperial Stouts, there was not that lingering heavy aftertaste that can detract from the beer.  D: Remarkably drinkable for the style. Superbly smooth on the palate. Could easily drink 2 or 3 in a session.  Fantastic, fantastic beer.

Smell: Charcoal briquettes, root beer barrels, alcohol and grape pixie stix are all present in the smell.  Taste: Starts off like sweet strong coffee, still am getting a grapey/raisin hint as I swallow. Nice hop bitterness balances out the sweetness of the beer. Complex taste consisting of light smokiness, chocolate, sweetness, coffee, and bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Medium to heavy body. Appropriate carbonation.

A rocky mocha-colored head rises and falls quickly leaving sparse bubbles and lace  Surprisingly, big, green hops dominate the nose with a underlying edge of char and coffee. Flavours explode in the mouth with a big cocoa-powder-baker's chocolate intro laced with a soft lactose edge. A deep toffee sweetness mingles with the still-smoking coals from last night's campfire. A powerful hop presence gives a massive bitter finish. Who baby, a big delicious beer which really benefits from serving almost room temp.  Medium viscous body with a pleasantly coating wake that begs another dive into the huge flavors. Alcohol produces warmth and only a slight phenolic presence. Who's your daddy?

The beer is nearly black. I can tell from the foam on my hand that it is a very sticky brew. The smell is really fresh. I don't know how else to explain it. Green, not as in 'green beer', but floral with chlorophyll aromas. Well roasted malts with a touch of piny hops. The flavor is great. Bold, rich, smooth, and burnt. It tastes similar to storm king stout, but it has a much more creamy and smooth body. Very well balanced overall. I like the little bite at the end that comes out at the same time as the hops.

112,412,screwcitybeernut,4.47,"Rasputin was a Russian mystic who contributed in the downfall of the tsarist Romanov dynasty in 1917. Rumor has it that he refused to die after being stabbed, shot, and poisoned only to have his assailants finally bind him and toss him through a hole in the ice, which apparently finished him off.  Funny. It took me only 20 minutes to finish off Rasputin. And he was delicious.  Old Rasputin Imperial Stout is typical of the Imperial Stout style - brewed to 9% abv or higher to withstand the cold Siberian train rides from England. It leaves you feeling a bit more resistant to cold than before you drank it - some sort of exothermic reaction must have happened because halfway through the glass, I started shedding layers.  Not a beer for the faint of spirit or faint of palate.  Appearance: 4 - Black as midnight - little to no light shines through. Rocky tan head at first, subsiding to a lingering layer of light brown foam that lasts until the last sip.  Smell: 4.5 Burnt coffee, bittersweet chocolate, alcohol and roast malt.

The head retention was pretty good. It held a sizeable head more than half way through the beer. The lacing was moderate.  S - This one didnt have a big aroma, but it was pleasant nonetheless. I pickup bits of dark chocolate and coffee. There is also just a little hop-citrus smell and a touch of alcohol present.  T - Wow, a roasty chocolate flavor is the first thing I notice followed by an equally present coffee taste. Also I get a little bit of caramel, kinda like a riesen candy chew (excellent). Not much in the way of hops, but there is a touch of hop bitterness. A light bit of alcohol warnth comes through, but not as much as the 9% alcohol would suggest.  M - Kind od chewy, like riesen chew in your mouth.  D - This has become my stand by RIS. It is very drinkable, borderline sessionable. A very tasty brew.

Taste: Almost a milk chocolate like sweetness comes from the malt, acts as a sweetener to the coffee like character, tastes of irish cream, hint of orange citrus, stays this way until the very tail when a dose of hops hits the tongue.  Mouthfeel: Rich and full bodied, but smooth, not sticky, creamy and ever so drinkable. Carbonation is light and cleansing.

I think this beer could use a little less hops because it feels a little out of balance. I would definitely recommend this beer for people that enjoy a heavy stout but i would not drink more than one bottle of it per night or it would be too much.

Rich malt, chocolate, toffee, some hops. The alcohol burns through a bit too much, but it's a minor flaw. Taste is magnificent - complex, something different with every sip. Rich chocolate, not too sweet, balanced by a strong bitterness. Warming, dry. Texture not thick or syrupy like too many Impy Stouts, but not as thin as a porter - these guys nail it. After each sip you want to go back immediately, but at 9% this is one to spend time with. The dryness overstays its welcome just a bit.  Works together almost perfectly.

The smells of coffee and chocolate hits you right away. The taste is a lively, for sure. Though the taste of alcohol is noticeable, but not detremental. Taste of rich malts that have a heavy accent of chocolate and oats. Mouthfeel is very pleasent for 9% ABV. Appearance is very dark, but with some very deep amber. This is a sipping beer, not for dinner and one to savor (it lingers in very good way). Something to relax with on cold winter nights.

112,412,jmalex,4.5,"I fell in love with Ol' Raspy the first time I had it a few months ago, and tonight is the night the second bottle comes out of the fridge for a more formal tasting. At long last!  APPEARANCE: Pours a very dark brown to black with a 1-inch, dense, beige head. It lowers to a splotchy, rocky cap and tops off the beer with striking contrast. Eventually the head vanishes, leaving a thin collar and patchy lacing up the glass.  SMELL: Aromas all over the place! As I'm assessing appearance, I can't help but get a whiff of the fantastic scents. Upon further inspection, this beer smells like real heavy hitter. Sweet, dark and toasted malts, alcohol, dark fruits, and floral hops all stand out. The hop aromas are nicely subtle, and do I detect a faint hint of smoke?  TASTE: Holy Tsar! The initial taste is dominated by chocolate and fruit esters. Alcohol is fairly apparent but not as much as I expected. This beer really starts to shine as it crosses the palette. The roasted flavors really make themselves known and linger long after the final gulp. The hops play a background role the entire time but are definitely an important part of the overall taste.  MOUTHFEEL: Medium full bodied and chewy. Like drinking beer syrup. It leaves a generous coating in every corner of my mouth. Nicely carbonated - maybe could use a bit more.  DRINKABILITY: Never mind that it's 9% ABV. Never mind that you can absolutely tell. This beer goes down quick and easy. Perfect for a snowy night like tonight.

It's got 8.9% ABV, but don't worry, you'll sober up when you see the picture of Rasputin on the label. Man, he is one creepy bastard.

112,412,dickieb,4.56,"Poors Black with a thin tan head. You know you have a good stout when you cant see light through it when held up to a lamp. Anyway tastes a little sweet, chocolatey, some hints of coffee. Some alcohol sneeks through, but it really adds to the over all flavor, and is in no way overpowering. A grate body, and excelent drinkability.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,kevinhulit,4.33,black liquid with creamy tan head. rich aroma character (cofee/malt). a bit of a ting on the palate but tasty... rich finish. this beer opened my palate to stouts beyond the sam adams/guiness portion of the varitey. there is so much more to stout! a must try.,North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,wcudwight,4.79,"As black as a night coon hunting with a new moon. 1/4"" tan head that quickly recedes to a heavy lace. Lace last as long as the beer. Ohhh man this smells good. Licorice, syrup, dark fruits, rich bread and dark cocolate. Taste is as good as the aroma. This beer has a sharper hoppy type bitterness than others of the style I've had. More of the rich chocolate flavors and less of the coffee. It's fantastic. This and Storm King are my two favorite of the style and two of the best beers I've had over all. Mouthfeel is velvet. This beer is over a year old and that may have contributed to the slick mouthfeel. It's a sipper and it's feeling but I gave it a 4.5 because it's so good. I was taking inventory of my cellar and came across 2 bottles of these. They have to be over a year old and I was suprised I've not reviewed it yet. This should be a staple for you to sip on cold evenings.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,SaCkErZ9,4.58,"This may be one of my favorite Imperial Stouts. I have had it many times but am just now getting around to reviewing it. Mmmm. Pours a very nice opaque black color with a thickness like hot maple syrup. Nice, dirty white head of about one finger forms and leaves lacing all the way down the side of the glass.  Aroma is chocolate and coffee and alcohol and dark fruits. Raisins and figs stand out. Some fruity esters. Chocolate seems to be the dominant flavor and of course the alcohol becomes more noticeable as the beer warms.  Nice chocolate flavors with some nice fruitiness. Coffee and caramel tones. Full of raisins.  This is a wonderful impy stout. It would have been nice to have this on a cold day, as I have before, but I was a little excited about the 65 degree weather here in NC today. Been a little cool lately. Definitely go out and get some of this.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,bjoyce12,4.63,"Unbelievable. Pours out black. Not brown, not deep amber, but black. Very thick foam head with staying power. Aroma is one of freshly baked dark bread. The outstanding quality of this ale is in its taste. The best comparison I can make is that it is like drinking a loaf of fresh rye bread. The rye really comes through, but with a smooth velvety texture. Any harsh bitterness of rye hops has been balanced away. You really need to sit and enjoy this one slowly. Its smoothness and balance provide a great mouthfeel. I selected a slightly lower grade for drinkability, because it is a heavy ale. Great wintertime drink.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,ttfreek,3.78,"Dark, slightly ruby red around the fringes. Small head for me, but i doubt i was using the right glass as i do not have alot of proper ones to use anyway. Dark taste, slight choclate taste, espeically in the head. The 9% ABV is hidden very well, and is not noticeable upon consumption. Moouthfeel is milky and frothy, and sloshing the liquid within your oral cavity causes the chocolate taste to come out a lot more, almost like a dessert. Coffe and nut flavours are apparent as well.  This was one of the first real stouts i have had that i enjoyed. Drinkability i only rated slightly above average, as the taste is really strong and the beer leaves your mouth with a slight dry feeling.  Good bargain for the price, definitely filling but not overtly so (mayube i have room enough for a second? No Doubt!)  Dora thhe Explorer could not make a better find.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,demcorhip,4.38,"Found this one yesterday in Duluth MN, only two bottles on the shelf so i grabbed them both, one for me, one for the boys back home to share.  Appearance Poured nearly completely opaque black, its burnt ruby body revealed itself where the light was able to pass through its body around the edges of the glass. A big, three finger meringue like head formed on the pour. Finely yet persistently carbonated. Thick and clumpy lacings stuck to the sides of the glass as i drank this awesome stout.  Aroma Nutty malts and bitter roasted grains. Scents of creamier hazel nut and bitter black walnut are in the mix, as well as a good, clean espresso aroma of dark roast coffee and dark chocolate, without excessive bitterness. Hint of woody and earthy hops also present.  Taste WOW, to sum it up in one word. Amazingly rich and tasty black brew. Some hazelnut creaminess as in the nose, which quickly morphs with the roast flavours to leave a more bitter black walnut impression. The roasted grains quickly assert themself with the tasty flavours of dark roast coffee and dark chocolate as in a good espresso. Some minor hints of treacle toffee present, as well as a slight touch of anise and a whiff of smoke flavour all add significant depth to this stout. Slightly woody and earthy hops round out this excellent brew.  Mouthfeel A rich, full bodied stout, slightly creamy, and quite velvety. Very well put together, with substantial yet not overdone bitterness from the roasted grain.  Drinkability Was going to give it a four, but i drank this one so quickly and effortlessly i had to bump it up another notch. Definitely sessionable, would love to sip on this all night long. The 9% alcohol is very well hid. Probably wouldnt use this to introduce someone to stouts, but would definitely recommend it to someone who appreciates stouts and porters and is looking for more. Ill definitely be grabbing this again, and the price was pretty reasonable too!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,bobquick,4.5,"One is great, two and the world is happy, three...that's what my friend calls ""a fist in the eye"". Full flavored, dark and pure. Tasty alone or with a meal.

112,412,Sconnie,4.75,"Quite simply a fantastic beer. Looked great; black with a nice creamy head, just like a stout should. Smelled of strong hops with a background of roasty maltyness. The taste kicks you right in the mouth; tons of flavor in all departments. Hoppy, roasty, with some chocolate malt sweetness. It's very filling and would be hard to drink more then one, but the 9% abv is covered up very well. Probably the best stout i've ever had.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,younger35,3.81,"Drank out of a regular ol' pint glass. Served it slighty too cold but it quickly warmed to a suitable temperature.  Appearance- Looked awesome. Poored a nicer head than I'm used to seeing off of a Imperial Stout. A very dark, chocolaty brown with pretty good lacing.  Smell- Had a very deep burnt malt smell. Wiffs of chocolate and nuts in the background.  Taste- Burnt. That is the first thing that jumps into my head. Was unsure at first if I even liked the taste but after a few more sips I was convinced. Pretty tasty. The roasted malts overtake this beer with very burnt like qualities. A nutty, chocolaty malt flavor comes through, tasting very much like the smell. A mild hop bitterness balances it pretty well. Was surprised I couldn't taste much of a alcohol undertone.  Mouthfeel- A nice creamy, malty body to it. But I was very surprised by how carbonated this beer was. More carbonated than any other Imperial I've had. Didn't really like it to much. Maybe I just fear change.  Drinkability- Overall, I think the beer was pretty good. A couple drinks into this I was really enjoying it. Other than it being a hair overcarbonated for me, it's a solid Imperial Stout.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,weeare138,4.42,"On nitro at Capones... Appears black with a cascading brown head that sticks around like a creamy, floating top. Tons of typical-of-nitro chunks of lacing are left all around the glass but this is just a marvel to look at. Smell is of bitter baker's cocoa, coffee, molasses, along with a touch of fruit and bitter citrus hops. Really nice. Taste is of the mentioned aromas with a yeasty fruitiness that compliments the dark malts wonderfully. It really comes together well, especially on the nitro-tap...never seen it on nitro before. Mouthfeel is full bodied, creamy, rich, fulfilling with just the right amount of sweetness, roastiness, and bitters all working together to a finish that is chewy and delightful.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,stevegamburg,4.5,"After reading the low scoring reviews, I can understand why someone would hate Old Rasputin. But not a single ""hardcore"" Imperial Stout drinker will say that this is not a fantastic beer. Very full bodied, heavy, and complex. Burnt malt, coffee, and chocolate dominate the palate. Old Rasputin is, at least in the Chicago area, available at most liquor stores and Trader Joe's and is very reasonably priced ($6.99/4-pack). I always keep it stocked on my ""stout shelf"" (along with Victory Storm King).",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

T - Same flavors as it smelled, with more emphasis on the coffee. Finished slightly bitter.  M - Nice balance of carbonation and smoothness, almost creamy.  D - So drinkable, especially for a beer this thick. Could even be a daily drinker.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,umustdrink,4.33,"A - Pitch black completely opaque even when held to light. Head is a medium brown that sits nicely at an eighth inch. Lacing sticks all the way up the glass.  S - Rich roasted coffee bean aroma with hints of raisins.  T - Deep bittersweet coffee flavor with fragrant dark fruits,burnt sugars and a sweet vanilla sugar taste up towards the front of the tongue.  M - Medium to thick consistency that is smooth and chewy. Carbonation is at a higher level that brings an unexpected bite to the mouth.  D - One of the most original tasting stouts out there. Price is also very reasonable at around 7.99 for a four pack.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,RidiculedDisplay,4.2,"Poured into an oversized wine glass.  Appearance: A half-finger light tan head with some of the best lacing I've seen on any stout, Imperial or not. Large, dotty, with small arms sticking out. Head settles into a small, eight-finger head. Dark black stout body.  Smell: A nutty almond aroma is up front, which is quite nice, followed by a huge amount of dark borderline bittering chocolate. Possibly the most bittering chocolate aroma I've ever smelled in a stout. The chocolate and almonds then coalesce into, yes, a chocolate-covered almond aroma. Heavy cream and cinnamon. Some vegetable-like aroma very faint on the back end, sort of like bell peppers, but pleasant. Really quite an aroma.  Taste: Some coffee in the flavor that I didn't pick up in the aroma. Some cinnamon. Alcohol is much more prevalent here than the lack I detected in the nose, but it is only prevalent upon some mild searching. Still a huge amount of dark chocolate, which I am still pleased with. The almond-like nuttiness is very faint in the back end.  Mouthfeel: A little too fizzy at some points, but otherwise coffee-like siltiness with some fullness.  Drinkability: Surprisingly drinkable for an RIS, while still maintaining an RIS kick and complexity. I downed a 12 oz of this in under a half hour, which, for me, is hard to do with an RIS. Anyway, a fantastic RIS for those wanting to step up from ""lesser"" stouts, or for those wanting to maintain the RIS punch while not going for something as big as a Stone RIS, etc. - in other words, this is about as close as an RIS gets to being sessionable. Especially sessionable with an extra sharp, aged cheddar. Mm.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

As for the taste, hmmm.Big Flavors right off the bat. Roasted, caramel sweetness, The alcohol can definatly be tasted and this is warm going down, yummy. Coffee undertones as well as the tiniest hint of chocolate, I mean tiny but it is there. Very nicely carbonated, and thick. This is a definate sipper.

112,412,Commandogeraldo,4.08,"Poured into an imperial pint glass after allowing beer to rise to a temperature of about 50 degrees. Head was three fingers thick, faded after a couple of minutes. Very full flavor, I was impressed with how it had sweetness coming through in the midst of the coffee overtones. Speaking of, that's what this reminded me of: a well-made cup of black coffee, but with more going on, and no need for milk or sugar. I also mark this as part of my evolution as a beer drinker, because a few years ago I would not have been able to appreciate a stout of this caliber.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Smells of alcohol esters mixed with a strong tone of roasted and chocolate malts. Slight hints of caramel and coffee flavors in the nose as well. Smooth rolling chocolate and roasted malt flavor. The alcohol taste is quite strong in the finish. Has a rather dry finish with a definite alcohol tone. Quite roasty and lots of bold malts in the mix. Nice full body and very drinkable.

112,412,Greenfloyd,4.48,"This is a Russian Imperial Stout that can turn out the lights...  This 9 percent stout poured into my snifter with a vengeance....dark molasses color, with a substantial, lingering cola colored head. This beer had a nose of dark chocolate, toffee, and traces of low alcohol tones. The heavy, complex taste of chocolaty roasted malts, warming alcohol, and meandering hints of dark ripened fruit, finished wonderfully with a subtle black coffee trail. The mouth feel was very substantial....probably the reason this beer comes in a four pack instead of a sixer...a heavy, heavy, brew.

T: Strong as any stout I've ever had, close to perfect. Tastes of coffe, hops and a very earthy taste.  MF: Excellent. Smooth and full  D: Great, but strong.

It has a nice crusty bread smell with roasted coffee and dark chocolate.  Now when I take the first sip...every time it makes me go "" Ahh thats a good beer."" It kind of reminds me of Breakfast stout. Only because of the very obvious and sharp coffee smell and coffee bitterness in the taste. It also reminds me of the taste of Founders Black Rye. It has a balanced blend of coffee, chocolate, bread, roasted nuts...its very good.

Chocolate, plenty of coffee with light hints of sweetness in the backround.  M- Smooth and rich, viscus, and just a bit of heat in the end of this one.

112,412,BeerBelcher,4.4,"In a word, this beer is excellent. It is easily the equal of AleSmith's Speedway Stout, and much more easily obtained (and in 12oz bottles to boot). Given the number of reviews it has already received, I will keep this relatively brief.  Color is an opaque black, through which no light passes. Head is tan, abundant, and perpetual. Aroma is malty and bourbon-y. Taste is of burned pizza crust and chocolate malt (and deliciousness!). Mouthfeel is full, and this beer definitely lingers in the mouth. Excellent all the way around.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,benito,4.65,"Old Rasputin is a black brew with mahogany highlights around the edges and a complex bouquet that mixes a clear alcohol presence with citrus, brown sugar, and tobacco. It's most pronounced flavor is its smokiness, but this doesn't overwhelm the bittersweet edge, hints of pineapple, alcohol bite, and leathery dryness. The flavors meld together in one of the most drinkable and smooth imperial stouts that I've ever had, with each sip revealing a new hint of flavor and depth.  The fruitiness (which may be an effect of my aging) does detract slightly from the overall heft of the body and the finish is just a little too watery, but the length and mix of flavors as well as the overall smoothness of this brew easily make up for those flaws.  This is a fantastic RIS and a must try beer. No wonder so many BAs before me have found a way to get their hands on this brew.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Appearance: A Pitch black amber with a wood brown head that sticks very nicely to the glass in which it was poured. The cascade was also a sight to be seen.  Smell: A very roasted malt smell with hints of dark roast chocolates and hazelnut.  Taste: An Extremely great tasting beer with a burnt chocolate and molasses taste. A malt and hop bitterness that finished surprisingly sweet.

Seems like chocolate and coffee. Great combination; it is obvious they spent a long time perfecting the malt combo and they hit this one out of the park.  Ideal balance between sweetness and dryness. 9% is definitely not apparent. Very easy to drink considering how thick and strong it is.

Taste: Immediately I notice how rich this beer is; very creamy with roast malts and toffee. Some alcohol is present in the taste as well, and the aftertaste is bittersweet.  Mouthfeel: Again, very creamy... and thick-bodied. Possibly a bit too creamy, but it is still very good.  Drinkability: Alcohol does tend to hit fairly quick (taste-wise), as it is quite strong. But as long as you take it slow it works just fine.  Overall this is a really exciting and interesting imperial stout, and a great starting point with this style.

112,412,jmichaeldesign,3.97,"Pours dark black with a two finger head that lingers longer than I had expected. This is partially due to being a little warmer than it should be, and a sub par pour.  Smell is fantastic. The chocolate is right there in your face without being overwhelming.  Taste is not quite as strong as other imperial stouts I've had. Very well balanced. A little bit of hoppiness. Aftertaste is all chocolate.  Mouthfeel is good. A little too carbonated for the style in my opinion.  It's incredibly drinkable for an imperial stout. The flavor isn't cloying, but it's too carbonated for me.  Overall a great beer. I'd definitely buy it again. A great nightcap or first beer of the night.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,barleyman,4.25,"Poured from the 12 oz. brown glass bottle into a tall chilled pilsner glass,(thats the glass they brought me.) The dark brown liquid passes no light through. The dark white head quickly dissapates to almost none, while leaving a nice Brussels lace down the glass. The smell is of roast chocolate malt and bread. The taste is quite warming, of roast chocolate malt with very little hop. Mouthfeel is quite good given the size of this beer. It seems I could session this beer for at least an hour, if not all night  Once again, bravo North Coast,  barleyman",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,pmcadamis,4.61,"A - A black brew with dark brown highlights is capped by a solid looking thick brown 1 and 1/2 finger head that sticks around for quite some time. Thick waves of lace coat the glass.  S - Solid scents of milk chocolate, dark chocolate, and roasted grains fill the nostrils. This is actually pretty mellow smelling, and the high alcohol level is not detectable. Burnt notes are there also.  T - Wonderfully full flavors of roasted cereal grains, chocolate, firewood, hickory, coffee, and tobacco. The taste is very bitter, but balanced by a little bit or chocolatey sweetness. This is really the most pleasant stout that I've had!  M - Full bodided, sweet and dextriny and first, slighty spicy and warming from the alcohol, and very dry on the finish. This stuff wicks the moisture away from you mouth and leaves you clucking, trying to make more spit. Wonderful.  D - Despite the alcohol content and strong roasty burnt flavors, I believe that this is about the most drinkable stout ever. Give me more!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,xymyl,4.35,"Very deep red/black with a creamy light tan and ever-present head and good carbonation, with small to very small bubbles.  Aroma is a clean singular hop aroma drifting in among fresh bread (or even fresh bread immediately made into toast), coffee and a little milk chocolate.  Taste is full of rich sweet notes (brown sugar, rasins, plumbs, a slight apple note and some other fruity notes that I just can't match) coffee, a tiny hint of milk chocolate and a bigger bite of dark chocolate, hops surface at times but generally I don't notice them, after that the alcohol shows up (just a bit) and then it all dries out.  Body is medium full/full and is very drinkable to someone like myself. Would be a sharing beer for some due to the richness.

112,412,scottoale,4.41,"Fresh on nitro and served in a pint glass...WOW, a beautiful imperial stout of black-ass brown with incredibly thick and creamy, cocoa butter lace. The 1"" thick head forms after a beautiful cascading display occurs, the kind that only nitrogen carbonation is capable of...buttercream froth. Fat, juicy rings of the stuff mark each sip of this fine looking brew.  Burnt and roasty dark malt smell is bluntly bitter and comprised of dark, black French Roast coffee and a heap of baker's chocolate...breakfast or dessert anyone?  The intake of a very short lasting sweetness is anise or black licorice if you will, followed by instant roast bitterness...an awesome tasty dark malt that is mostly black French Roast coffee (nearly espresso) with heavy bitter chocolate notes...rich and roasty to the finish. Very tasty I.S. with a smooth and creamy big body, accompanied by a well hidden, high dose of you guessed it...alcohol.  Great appearance, good smelling, excellent taste and mouthfeel lead up to an imperial stout that is all too drinkable...especially when on tap and charged with nitrogen...love this stuff!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,ultralarry2006,4.85,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle. Leaves an espresso-foam colored head of about one finger in depth, and has very good retention, and good spotty lacing. Body is almost black, being the deepest possible brown. Looks very beuatiful.  Smell - the nose is filled with roasted, smokey malt and dark crusted malt bread, as well as chocolate, figs, raisins, plums, dark dried fruits, and spicy, medicinal alcohol. Mouthwatering.  Taste - pretty much as promised by the nose, with the additon of caramel swirling throughout, and a slight lemony hop twang at times. Again, roasted, smokey malt with taste of dark dried fruits such as raisins and figs, and some ripe ones like plums. Malt bread baked long enough to almost burn the crust, with some chocolate and caramel to go along with the fruits, all in a swirl, with spicy, medicinal alcohol tying it all together. Delicious. And no harshness from the alcohol at all - it's well integrated into the taste, being pretty well hidden, only by lending its big spicy medicinal flavor do you know it's there.  Mouthfeel - full bodied, smooth, chewy at times - sort of "" fluffy "", like when one eats puffed grain cereal.  Drinkability - this is an excellent ale, with well hidden abv. Very hearty, and delicious. It's that abv that holds down sessionability, so it's a sipper to be enjoyed slowly with only a couple of servings at a given session - but do so often, I will.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Minkybut,3.45,"Poured into a tumbler at 5o degrees. Beer was black as night. Smell was dark roasted malty nutty smoke laced like wood fire smell. Head went away rather quick. I though this was a right strong stout a little bitter for my taste, but stout folks I think will like and shuld try it. I most likely will not purchase again though.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,kzczp0,4.42,"Pours a rich dark brown like espresso. Fine beaded head that lays at a half inch or more for a few minutes and then recedes to circle the glass with minor lacing over entire surface.  Smell is exquisitely rich, strong of roast malts, cigar and alcohol. Taste is straight on with dry feel over palate and not a complexity of flavors but rather intense burnt malt and bitterness from alcohol that does not change. I am not complaining about the taste. It is completely as expected.  The brew gets a little flat for carbonation quicklly which is to be expected but not a big change from beginning. As the beer warms I notice increase of chocolate and some hoppiness. This is an excellent Imperial. 2 or 3 of these would make for an interesting evening with good friends.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,jletts,3.92,"Purchased this tasty beer at the local PCC at a bargain price of $1.75. Served in a pint glass at about 50 degrees.  Appearance: Poured a very dark reddish brown, which is perceived as black in all but the brightest lighting, with a large yellow-brown head.  Smell: Earthy. Smells of dark leather and peat, some cloves and hops, and just a hint of sweetness, maybe sugar or vanilla.  Taste: Burnt sour cherry, cocoa. Charred and a little smokey at the end where the alcohol finally comes in, though not overpoweringly so.  Mouthfeel: medium body, a little syrupy.  Drinkability: An excellent Imperial Stout, but a little high in ABV to drink too many. But it is very drinkable because it is so tasty!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Smell: Smells of slightly overcooked coffee with a hint of sweetness.  Taste: Smooth, tingles the tongue. Sweet espresso flavors followed by bitter chalky feel towards the back of the mouth. Creaminess at the front. Hints of a cocoa.  Notes: A very enjoyable stout. Getting down into the beer allows the nose to be engulfed in the delectable aromas wafting up from the brew before the wonderful flavor hits the lips. Enjoy this one as it warms up.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Franchise,4.72,"This offering from North Coast pours a onyx color leaving a tan head that is thick and luxurious. The aroma is strong hop citrus and earthy licorise feel followed by a sweet chocolate essence. The taste starts syrupy bitter with herbal hops that are abundant in this gem. The taste continues with marshmallow, chocolate, coffee roasted beans come though this brew. The finish is bitter espresso, but that caramel cooked sugar sweetness helps balance this big bitter beer. Overall this is an outstaning stout one that should be in my fridge year round. I paired this baby with a gourmet chocolate chip cookie and it was delicious.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,tjthresh,3.6,"Pours and inky opaque black with a brown head that disapates to a ring. Molasses, smoke, bitter dark chocolate, dark roast coffee, chewing tobacco, spicey hops and alcohol in the nose. Prunes, very bitter, chocolate grit. Light smoke. Rather thin. Higher carbonation for the style. Slick and oily. Very good.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,dedrinker,4,"I love this beer from start to finish. It's a blessing that it is available year 'round. It smells of yeast/ fresh dough and roasted malts. Bitter chocolate, a little coffe. Tastes roasty, chocolate, hint of coffee and every once in a while - licorice. More hop bitters and more roast distinguishes this one from its British relative, but this has to bridge the gap as well as being an all around benchmark for the style.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,maundythirsty,4.12,"Interesting looking RIS, being that it is not a glass full of squid ink. Very dark brown, to be sure, but I can see through the edges, with are bottle glass brown. Very little head to speak of, off-white and thin. Smells yeasty, like dark bread, with a big roasted malt note  Tastes of clean, round roasted malt all the way through, with some coffee edges and a wee hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is very creamy and consistent.  Wow. So that's a really good, even-handed Russian imperial stout that does its work without tasting like a bag of sugar. Beauty of a label, too, with the spooky little wave from the Mad Monk.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,MVassar,4.41,"Black as pitch in most of the glass, with a lovely dark ruby outline. After some beautiful cascading fireworks there's a most respectable medium-amber head, and fine lacing.  Some roasted malt, which is sweet and toasty. A hint of black coffee, and some unsweetened cocoa powder.  Plenty of well-roasted malt, chocolate, sweetened coffee extract, and even a touch of hops in the finish to provide a kick in the pants.  RIch and creamy at the start, with some serious bitter hops to balance things out.  This is a kick-ass, make-your-head-spin stout that is so smooth and supple that it qualifies as ""dangerously easy to drink.""

All the advertised aromas strike. Mild fruit, dark and ripe. Pronounced American hop flavors in the end: floral and citric.  Thick and smooth. Moderate oral foamation. Almost no carbonation.  Impressively rich and deep array of flavors at first taste. So strong is Old Rasputin that this effect is lost near the end as my tongue slips into submission. I really like the hop flavors, they are a nice touch. Definitely worth a retry.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Dizzy,4.17,"Pours very dark, faint garnett highlights when held up to light. Lots of tan head with plenty of lacy. Aroma is a wonderful blend of chocolate and toffee with some fruitiness. Taste is carmel like initially, with some fruitiness. Dark, roasted malts dominate the finish and the alcohol becomes evident. Full bodied with moderate carbonation. I like this one, but I wouldn't want more than one. In addition to the high alcohol, too much roasted malt bitterness accumulates to enjoy more than one.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,JudgeRoughneck,4.64,"A hard pour of Old Rasputin produces two fingers of curiously striped head with a two-tone fade that prety-much is the same color as the white and tan parts of espresso froth. Disappointingly, the show is over in a few seconds and I am left with only a thing ring around the glass, with minimal strings of lace. The nose is spicy hop, earthy chocolate, coacoa, just a little coffee, dark brown sugar, molasses, and fig or date. Very little roasted aroma.  This beer is suprisingly light on the palate. I would describe it as a creamy blend of coffee, sweet milk chocolate, roasted grain, and then just a touch of roasted bitter that makes way for a little suprise. There is a twang of tart rasberry flavor in the finish. A very subtle molasses flavor shows itself as the beer warms. The aftertaste leaves a very gentle, lingering roastiness mixed with alcohol warmth. This is a very smooth and layered beer.  The artful blending of flavors makes reviewing it kind of a chore because it is difficult to dissect exactly what you taste, and it is so smooth you just want to gulp it down. In fact if I have one complaint of this brew, it is that for an Imperial Stout it is almost a little too smooth, lacking a certain ""oomph"" factor on the palate. All this combined with creamy, silky-smooth mouthfeel make this a dangerously drinkable Imp. Stout, and it would be all to easy to end up smashed, knocking these back like nothing.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Present yet very balanced roast. Plus a hint of semi-sweet-bitter chocolatey goodness. Bitterness gently creeps in on the after-taste. Doesn't taste like a 9% ABV.  M: Thick yet not overdone. The taste is definitely a lingerer, the kind of way a scantily clad lingerie model would linger in the morning.. only this isn't fantasy land.  D: At 9%, you're going to want to be careful with this. But should I have the opportunity to put a few of these away, I definitely would. Tremendous representation of the RIS.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,AaronHomoya,4.12,"Pours with a decent amount of head, especially for a RIS, and a black color. Smell is a delicious mix of rich, roasted malts and chocolate. Taste is sweet, malty, and roasted with coffee notes and a nice, balanced hop finish. Medium-bodied mouthfeel with solid carbonation. Nicely drinkable, especially for the style as it is ONLY 9% ABV and smooth.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Grundle20,4.1,"Appearance: I've said beers pour black before, well I lied, this beer pours BLACK. Light can almost not pass through the glass. It's thick black beer with a creamy nut colored head.  Smell: Primarilly burnt chocolate and coffee in scent but there are some very minor cherry and biscuit notes. Pretty much what you would expect but good and balanced none the less.  Taste and Mouthfeel: There is a very strong flavor of good dark chocolate. While beers to me tend to taste more like bakers chocolate this really tastes like good edible dark chocolate. The beer drinks incredibly smooth with bitter stings on the front and sides of my tongue. The finish is again chocolatey only with a little coffee in the mix. There is a full on aftertaste to this beer which I don't really like but the beer itself is good enough for me to look past this.  Drinkability: Pretty much everything about this beer says not so drinkable aside from the taste. High ABV and an unclean finish are really what takes away from this for me, but it's a really tasty beer and would probably serve a stout fan well in terms of drinkability.  Bottom Line: A pretty awesome stout. Not exactly my cup of tea but this was an enjoyable drinking experience and I would recommend this to anybody looking for something good or any fan os stouts.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,becktone,4.58,"After walking about two miles to pay my rent in very unfavorable conditions here in Cincinnati, I finally returned to my humble abode and asked myself ""What do I have in my fridge that can warm me up after that?"" At about 35F outside and winds that made walking down a hill one of Hurcules' 12 Labors, I hoped I had something very dark, malty and strength imbuning in my fridge. As I looked in my fridge I almost started to sigh, and lo and behold forgotten in the back corner behind some other sixers I find I've an ample supply of Old Rasputin. Here are my thougts.  The pour is dark-black infact- With a tan creamy three finger head this brew looks just too good. Head begins to receed in size to a stable one finger size leaving some sweet looking lace along the sides of the glass.  Aroma is strong, sweet, and alcoholic. A robust chocolate character comes through and maybe a little bit of a coffee aroma as well, other notable smells are dark fruits, maybe some prunes. No hop aroma, or roasted bitterness aroma. All in all a great smelling brew.  Oh yes, this lifts my spirit and warms the soul. Strong sweet malty backbone gives real character and life to this brew. Chocolate malts take the foreground in this brew's flavor profile. Just a tad of hop flavor in the back of this one, one of the noble varieties I should think. Just there in the back, fleeting. Tastes great, but more complexitiy would add more to this brew....My upper body is now pretty much thawed, but my lower body is still pretty cool.  The body of this RIS is thick and full bodied and creamy just the way it should be. Carbonation levels are fairly low as benefits the style. I'll most likely buy this brew again. It is great to warm up with after coming in out of the cold and being pounded by the elements. Not something that I could sit around and drink all day, and it shouldn't be. I don't think that any RIS is meant to be that way. Definitely something to slowly savor. However, I also know that there are other RIS's that represent the style differently and I would definitely love to try those before I came back to this one, but I would not be adverse to another go-round with this brew.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

The head was gorgeous, like every nitro-tapped stout should have and the black color was quite nice. The smell was standard stoutish, but gave off more of a sweet coffee flavor than a bitter coffee flavor and that was rather enticing. The taste really developed the sweetness to bring a very nice balance to the beer. The mouthfeel was better than average, but probably because it was a nitro tap and added to the smoothness. It was drinkable in all respects, and I will keep getting it on occasion, but have a hard time going through a few pints in a sitting.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

A slight nod to a gentle hop flavor on a third sip that is ever so slightly pine citrus with a nicely place hop bitterness cleansing the palate.  m: medium to heavy body, but for style leans toward a thinner drier RIS, not in a bad way just certainly a contrast to some of the ""thicker"" versions I have had.

Smells first of a hint of hops then strongly of sweet chocolately roasted malts. Great taste with lots of flavors. The sweet roasted malts dominate but as with the smell I am able to detect a hint of hop bitterness. I am able to pick out some coffee, bitter dark chocolate, and some dried fruits. A pleasantly bitter dark chocolate flavor lingers in the finish. Despite clocking in at 9% ABV the alcohol is masked quite well. Mouthfeel is great.

Taste was more of what was found in the aroma (less the steak), and the 9%alcohol blended in nicely to be a perfect complement to the malty sweetness, as the beer warmed .

S: Dark chocoloate notes. Roasted barley and choffee. Sweet dark fruit, mostly figs and cherries T/M: Roasted malt flavors stirke right off the bat. Milk chocolate and sweet caramel notes ring in as secondary players. Dark fruit and fig flavors also come through. Aftertaste is a tad bitter with the hops showing their presence. Faint burnt coffee notes also present themselves in the finish. Thick and chewy, but very smooth and silky on the palate. Mouthfeel is absolutely wonderful. Abv is definately noticeable and comes through with a spicyness. Big abv isn't overly obstrusive. D: A RIS you've got to get your hands on. Very tasty and amazingly smooth.

The head is small now but was bigger on pour and has laced nicely.  S: The aroma is one of roasted malts and sweet chocolate held together by a strong alcohol presence.  T: The stout has a strong, bold presence taste-wise. The first flavors to hit the tastebuds are roasted malts and alcohol strength. The intensity of the alcohol gives way to a vinous complexity. That complexity gives up hints of chocolate and warming alcohol. My only complaint is that the flavors are not big and bold immediately, they require a bit of time to really shine.  M: The roasted complexity is very pleasing, giving the stout multiple levels of flavor that build well upon each other.  D: The drinkability is limited by the 9.0% abv.

Taste is great as well. Same as the nose with a bit more turkish coffee and dark chocoate. Wonderful flavor. Alcohol bites a little but is welcome in the flavor.  Mouthfeel is great. This stout coates the tongue as well as any RIS i've had. Carbonation is above average making this beer smooth in the finish.  Drinkability is good. I could drink a few 12oz bottles in one sitting but that would be about it and that's probably because of how big this beer is in terms of flavor and alcohol (9%).

A nice taste that combined french roast coffee and chocolate. Exceptionally creamy and smooth taste with the chocolate again and more roasts, but not with an overpowering, burnt taste like many in this genre.

In the mouth, it starts with a bit of sweet chocolate, then dries fairly rapidly into a strong coffee-laden finish, complicated by some hop bitterness and slight astringency. Alcohol can barely be sensed, and only when the beer is chewed vigorously. Mouthfeel is highly pleasurable, with perfectly gauged carbonation.  This stout definitely leans to the dry side of the spectrum. However, it is balanced enough to be remarkably drinkable. The extent to which the alcohol is hidden is admirable as well.

112,412,BeerSox,4.5,"12oz bottle into snifter.  Almost perfect black color with a dark tan frothy head that hold well. Settles to a razor thin cap. Stringy lacing along the glass.  Dark coffe like roasty malts with a strong creamy presence, and hints of bitter choclolate. Some warming alcohol in the background. Some dry fruit aromas are mixed in there as well.  Bitter roasty malts with some bittering hops to compliment the flavor. Full bodied, with low carbonation, giving it a very thick and viscous feel. Light dark chocolate flavors. Finishes dry from the bitter malts and the acompanied hop bitterness.  This is an amazing beer, expecially since I only paid $2 for it. The 9%ABV and 12oz size makes this beer great for ending the night without going to far. It's also fitting as a desert. Highly recommended.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,terrabyte,4.17,"Pours a very dark black with a medium tan head.  Aroma is rich with malt and sweet mocha chocolate.  Flavor is a deep, very rich chocolate. This is one of the richest chocolates I've tasted in a beer. Blends well with a dark oak flavor, hints of chocolate, a caramel smoothness, and roasted malts. Surprisingly, not on the sweet side, just rich. The alcohol bite also works with the flavors, not against it or even as a 'result'.  Mouthful is medium and full. Low carbonation.  Very drinkable. Very enjoyable.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,flexabull,4.2,"Bottle aged about a year.  Pours jet black with a big tan head with equally big bubbles.  Smells like dark bitter chocolate, and alcohol... whoa!  Taste is big, as is the mouthfeel. This is a very well rounded beer. Taste is hops and alcohol up front, finishes with still a little bit of an alcohol burn, and roasted coffee and deep dark chocolate notes. There is a little carbonation noted on the mouthfeel as well.  One of the standards for Russian Imperial Stouts. There is a little pub in my hometown that serves this on nitro. What a treat that is... but it's hard to have just one!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,andrewmartin,4.35,"The bottle I had has no date on it, but it has been kicking around in my basement for at least a year or so, and boy, does it show.  A: This baby is one shade lighter than pitch black with a huge, thick tan head.  S: Strong brandy notes, syrupy and toasty as well, can almost smell the warming alcohol.  T: Wow, almost too many flavors to pick out. Very winey and dryish, notes of roasted coffee and dark chocolate as well as dried fruits. Surprisingly little alcohol taste.  M: Mouthfeel is biting and very dry.  D: Not something to play around with, definately a slow and easy brew that needs to be savored.  Although I haven't reviewed a younger version of this beer, I have tasted it, and I would recommend cellaring it for at least a year.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,socalde,4.47,"Appearance- Dark mahogany with a light lace and a head that slightly lingers atop the brew. When held up to the light this brew is ebony with a hint of reddish-brown at the edges.  Smell- First thing I noticed was a bit of hoppiness followed by an overwhelming aroma of malt with a hint of sweetness (maybe chocolate?)  Mouthfeel- Creamy, lightly carbonated.  Taste- Delectable. Sweet malt taste but with a hoppy undertone. Aftertaste is delightfully malty and dark. Chocolate comes to mind when I drink this beer, as with any fine stout.  Drinkabilty- Surprisingly drinkable considering the 9% ABV label. Easier to sip compared to other brews of this calibur.  This beer holds it's own when compared to other stouts in it's league.

112,412,Oxymoron,4.08,"I found a recipe on Old Raspy and brewed it, so I decided to compare and contrast. And then compare. And then compare some more. The pour is a creamy with a very black color that when held to the light has a feint brown hue. A good mahogany brown head that is pretty soapy and good lacing.  The nose is rich with maltiness. Mostly a chocolate smell but some stronger astringent malts are present as well. Some coffee and a hint of caramel on the end.  The taste has a strong malt flavor. The astringency comes out stronger then the nose would indicate. A good bite that is enhanced with a light earthy bitterness. Bigger coffee notes but there are some lighter milky aftertones at the back end that kind of clash. I also picked up some roasted nut flavors.  The body is full but some of the milkiness brings it down a bit. Some phenolics are present, but not suprising with the high ABV. A viscous feel as well. Overall it's a good brew to clone and well worth to drink.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Dark chocolate, coffee, nutty, and roasted caramel/toffee aroma..  Somewhat mellow and understated for the style, but still a full-flavored brew. The citrus hops are the first thing I notice, along with the full and complex malts. Bitter chocolate and coffee with healthy, but not overpowering alcohol flavors.  Creamy but somewhat syrupy full-bodied mouthfeel. This is probably the most drinkable RIS I've tasted too, since the flavors are so subdued and there is almost no bitter aftertaste.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,trep,4.05,"12oz Bottle, not sure of the age, but i'm sure it has been sitting on the shelf for quite a while.  Dark body when sitting down, fairly translucent when held to the light. A nice cappuchino head that quickly fades after a vigorous pour. Sweet, hot, bitter, fruity, chalky, pretty complex. I like it, although I can't distinguish many of the aromas. A bit of alcohol.  Initially coffee bitterness, then a smooth chocolatey downfall to the vanilla cream finish. Very nice, not too fierce either. I was expecting this to be fairly hot, but I guess it has had enough time to mellow out. Not spectacular, but not bad by any stretch of the word. Also an incredibly good value at 6.99 per 4-pack.  Medium-full body with light carbonation. Very smooth for an imperial stout. I look at Old Raspy as kind of a baby imperial stout. I could see myself drinking these as long as I was standing though. Too delicious and easy to drink.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

If you could ever claim a beer can warm you up, this is the one. Complex dark oak flavor with nodes of coffee, chocolate, a bit of caramel, roasty malts, and yet the beer isn't sweet at all. The alcohol is hidden very well, making this a highly drinkable beer. Mouthfeel is full and chewy. This beer is thick, and here to warm you up.

112,412,SudNut,4.12,"This beer pours to a disturbingly dark concoction with a tan head about two fingers thick quickly dispersing to a thin head over the top.  A toot of suds is like smelling a malty dark mocha with a couple of extra shots of espresso. I detect roasted malt, dark semi-sweet chocolate, coffee and a bit of alcohol.  Nice big gulp and aaahhhh almost exactly like it smells the order of taste some times clashes though, roasted malt, semi-sweet chocolate, coffee and alcohol respectively. Sometimes it seems the chocolate and coffee switch seats on the bus. Also there is an undertone of hops near the finish, good stuff!  Creamy medium body with a touch of stickiness to the mouthfeel, it almost feels like painting a coat of beer on your tongue, although just for a moment.  This beer has above average drinkability and I will have another. The fact is I can only endure so much real coffee and this beer tastes like coffee. One or two is great any more than that is too much for my taste.  Enjoy!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,esurreal,4.44,"Over the course of the last year or so I have tried more beers than I have in my entire life. This beer is one of the best I have tried. It's taste is biting, strong, and delicious.  The appearance is extremely black. No light passing through at all. On of the darkest I have encountered thus far. The head is a little small, but that's the least of my worries.  The smell gave this one away. I knew it was a winner. Coffee, chocolate, and raisins is what I smell the most. It smells incredible. A good strong smell.  Tastes like a really good stout. Guiness who? Seriously, it has it's own league. Very good bite in every sip. I can taste the beer each time it hits my tounge. With some beers I can taste them for a little while, but eventually I grow numb to their taste. Not so with this one. Chocolate and coffee with an ever so present slip of alcohol burn. I love the taste of this one.  Mouthfeel is creamy and good. Just like it should be. I could easily make this the only beer I ever drink again, but who would want to do that. Overall you can't go wrong with this brew.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,goschool,4.5,"Appearance: The pour is dark chocolate with red hues. The light brown head starts off massive before rescinding to a thin layer covering more than half of the beer.  Smell: There are big roasted malt aromas in the nose, namely chocolate, coffee, as well as a touch of alcohol.  Taste: The taste fallows the nose to a tee. Roasted malts bring semi-sweet chocolate, coffee (a darkish, roast with low acidity like Sumatra), fruity hops in the background, and warming alcohol at finish.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied, smooth, and creamy, yet somewhat sticky at the same time.  Drinkable: There's lots of alcohol and the flavor profile is intense, but this is much more quaffable than it has any right to be.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,johnbonham1980,4.13,"Had this with a steak and root vegetable dinner. The steak was a great pairing with it, and the stout and meat played off each other in very pleasant ways.  Tons of potential here if cellared. I sense a lot of flavor that hasn't had the chance to emerge yet and will with aging.  Aroma and taste, to me, are dominated by a smoky character, raisn and dried cherry, espresso, and molasses. It's easily the best imperial stout I've had. It's remarkable to me how little it actually comes across as a 9% beer. Wonderful balance.  Awesome beer for cold nights in front of a fire. Next time I'm drinking it with a cigar, which I think will make for an awesome pairing.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

A: The beer is a deep dark black color, with a thin tan head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.  S: It has a very rich aroma of dark chocolate and roasted malt.  T: The taste is creamy & malty with flavors of roasted coffee, dark chocolate and caramelized malt. For a beer with 9.00% ABV you sure wouldn't know it. The dark chocolate flavor comes out a little more.  M: Very, very smooth, low-to-medium carbonation, medium-to-heavy body, finish is kind of sticky.  D: Very tasty, quite easy-to-drink, not as filling as other beers in the style, this is a beer that can be a sipper or a pounder, even if the ABV creeps up on you.

The smell is sweet roasted malts, chocolate, alcohol, and biter coffee.  The taste is excellent: a near-perfect blend of malty-roasty-ness, chocolate, and coffee, that is neither too sweet nor too bitter. Also, for a 9% abv beer, this surprisingly smooth.  The mouthfeel is very creamy, with just the right amount of carbonation.  This is a very drinkable beer, especially for its style. Very nice for a sipping beer on a cold day.  Overall, this is an excellent beer, and a great example for the Russian Imperial Stout (RIS? Why does IPA get an acronym and no one else does?).

This RIS had a big, full mouth feel and flavor. Specifically, what really stood out to me as I sipped it after a big steak was a really nice burnt malt flavor followed by a smooth dark chocolate linger. Unlike some in this class, there was really no strong sense of alcohol for its high ABV. While drinking several in an evening may not be in order, one or two will really work well after a steak or on a cold winter evening.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

S - Fruitiness with slight malts. A green beer that would do well with some sit down time. Caramel twinges that were underage. A supreme classic with a few years under its belt, but right now it is quite young.  T - Didnt quite balance out. The caramel and the bitterness clashed, but not in a significant way. Both were gentle but didnt agree with eachother. Like I said, let this hang out for a year or two.  M - A little rough, carbonation was out of wack with the gravity of the beer. All would be resolved with some time to work things out.  D - Now: Easy to drink, definitely recommended if you are at a bar that serves it.

S: I had to let it sit a little but it became very sweet and even citrusy.  T: A rich, roasted espresso. A hint of alcohol but in a pleasantly flavored, not malty, waykind of like baileys Irish cream or even a very, very dark coffee-infused white Russian. Deep and delicious.  M: A wonderful full body.

The head is so creamy it reminds me of the crema on a a well-poured cup of esspresso. Retained a good head through the entire glass and left residual rings, as well. Friggin' beautiful.  S--Sweet malty smell with strong alcohol that leads to a slightly anise smell.  T--Strong but not atringent tast of bitter-sweet chocolate finishing ever-so-slightly sweet. The rich taste remains for some time. To me, this would be a wonderful after-dinner beer. A good dessert substitute.  M--A full rich and creamy swallow. Can't ask for more.

The scent is heavy but sweet. Has a very dark malty aroma, but with a slight sweetness that is a nice counterpoint. There is a very hard, alcoholic smell. I can tell this is going to be strong.  The taste is a karate kick of alcohol to the taste buds. A very deep coffee flavor. Very harsh. Need an appreciation for stouts and/or a strong palate to appreciate this baby.  It's a syrupy and thick feel. Leaves a heavy residue on the tongue. It's a very good beer, but it's a one-and-done for this advocate. It's way too heavy for me to have more than one per night.

Poured into a heavy glass chalice, formed a 1/4"" brown head over the barely translucent reddish dark brown brew. Head is down an uneven layer of bubbles pretty quick, with slow-falling lacing. Aroma is heavy, rich dark malts, chocolate and coffee doing battle, just what you expect and want in the style.

Rich and viscous, it covers the inside of the glass with an unctuous coating. Essences of roasted chicory and hazelnuts soar from the glass. Well-roasted malts and vanillin are in attendance as well, as there are hints of some oak also; a nose reminiscent of Weyerbachers ""Prophesy"". The taste is creamy, soft and unctuous in the mouth. Profound flavors of roasted carob and coffee offset by slightly bittersweet chocolate round out the package here. Amazingly drinkable for a brew of such concentration and depth, the medium body, light bitterness, and very soft acids make this a brew to engorge one self with.

Looks delicious already! Lacing is pretty evident as the beer goes down.  The smell is very complex, with strong coffee and fruity scents most prevalent.  When sipped, mouth is overcome by a citrus-like flavor, followed by chocalates. Aftertaste is a strong coffee/mocha flavor. Lots of sweet flavors. Delicious!  Slightly heavy on the mouth, but that is to be expected when drinking a strong stoudt.  All in all, my new favorite beer. But don't have too many, in fact, one is probably sufficient.

T: Burnt roastiness leads to very dark chocolate and burnt espresso, finishing with a dark, berried sweetness masking the alcohol.

After a minute or so, the head subsided somewhat, leaving an even lacing, and lightening in color to more of a cream color.  The dark, roasty coffee/cocoa aromas hit you first, with a faint bready aroma in the back. It is a very inviting smell, but you know from the first whiff that it will take a long time to finish this beer.  There are some sweet malty notes, but the flavor is dominated by the roasty/bitter notes that finish out. It reminds me a lot of baker's chocolate. There is a faint flavor of alcohol, but the bitterness balances it out. The mouthfeel is very thick, but not to the extreme. This is a very heavy beer.  The finish lingers for several seconds, and you will want to savor it until it subsides before having another sip. Then you will definitely want another sip.

This is setting the bar pretty high & Im a little concerned Ill be let down upon tasting  And Id be wrong! Oh, this viscous, delectable drink is every bit as good as I remember. Creamy & almost sweet at first, becoming bitter (but in the best sense of the word) after spreading across the palate. The malt presence is intense & the alcohol is certainly detectable, but every flavor works so well together that its hard not to love. To add to the sin-factor, I paired this with a little dark chocolate & have to say that I prefer the beer on its own.

Taste was upfront medium milk chocolate sweetness, and light banana sweetnes and bitter burnt malt, followed by a bitter ascent into the harsh burnt piney bitterness of the malts (and hops?), keeping its medium chocolatey sweet backbone throughout and dies slightly vinous trailing behind, leaving only the initial chocolatey taste and some roasted character.

A thin layer of foam remains to give moderate lacing.  The aroma malty sweet. Like nearly burnt sugar.  It tastes exceptionally smooth. Full hop character rises through strong roasted coffee and caramel flavor. I have trouble sipping this beer. It is like candy. The alcohol is present but I notice it more as it warms my stomach than in my mouth. I had planned on letting the other 3 bottles age but it will be a struggle.,North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,gonzo138,4.2,"A- Pours a dark black with a small amount of red mixed in if you hold it up to the light, nice cramy brownish head that doesnt stay around too long but retains very well  S- Smells of rich almost earthy chocolate malted sweetness  T- very rich chocolate/coffee-ish taste nice sweet desert taste  M- very, very thick, coats mouth, suprisinglty carbonated, taste stays in mouth for moderate amount of time  D- Something to slowly enjoy, have bought plenty of this beer and plan to buy plenty more",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,thelagerheads,4.5,"Just as Pluto is no longer recognized as a planet sometime in the not too distant future macro brews will not be considered the KING OF BEERS but rather dwarves in an ever growing universe. Then the true forebearers and rightful heirs of the past (stouts, porters, ales, etc.) will once again become the standard bearers. With this brew that future is already here. This heady stout has a potent sludge of choc-smoke-offee and is more like a dreamquest than a heavy beverage. Smoke is rising through the fog laden hills and the old spirits are churning skyward to meet the Gods in the newly refined air.  I may have met my match here though as I dozed off for a few minutes in the tub clutching my notepad! If Breckenridge Vanilla Stout is the high watermark then this is me undertow and drowning. The Beer Cave of American brews (so far!)!!!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,mmcave,4.2,"Pours dark blackest coffee and a tan head with light high lights on edges. The head is mild and seems it will slowly fade except on the edges. Sents of coffee, caramel, dark chocolate and hops. The taste is robust, well balanced, coffee and chocolate present with a tinge of bitterness. The finish is little bitter, but only in the best way as in a great after taste. This is a nice beer, I would definitely buy it again.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,w1n0,4.37,"Another great effort from the people at North Coast.  appearance: pitch black (even against light), a modest tan head.  smell: green tea, corriander and toasted nut notes.  taste: a plesantly light bitter chocolate and red berry notes bound together with a smooth coffee and toffey finish. light in the gut with little to no blote.  mouthfeel: moderate weight, chewy.  drinkability: one of the best russian imperial style stouts ive had.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,phisig137,4.05,"Pours a deep black, with ruby hints around the edges, and a two finger creamy head. Nice retention and lacing.  Aroma is cocoa-ey, and filled with scents of roasted barley, and a bit of coffee. Toffee also pops out, along with a hint of burnt toast. Only the smallest hint of alcohol present.  Flavor is smooth, and dominated by coffee nuances behind the roasted grain. Chocolate is also present, along with a hoppy finish. Dry finish, balanced between roasted grain and (what taste like noble) hops.  Mouthfeel is creamy and heavy. Begs for another sip. Drinkability is pretty good considering the ABV and heft of the beer.  Yet another fantastic beer from North Coast. They almost never disappoint.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,GimpyCane,4.3,"appearence: poured burnt caramel brown w/ a 1/2 inch light brown head. Looks alot like molasses and left virtually no lace.  smell: got an intense whiff of roasted coffee and burnt caramel, also has a nice hint of alcohol present.  taste and mouthfeel: loved how it starts off w/ a creamy sweet caramel and ends hoppy harsh almost tart, medium to full body w/ a fizzy carbonation feel. Great hint of alcohol on tongue that wondered on my tongue for several minutes.  drinkability: nice sipping beer  Overall, I like this Russian Imperial Stout alot, especially at room temperature. While it is smooth to drink, it's quite intense and well balance w/ roasted elements, alcohol and body. Careful the ABV is 9% and will kick you in the ass.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,RedChrome,4.25,"Poured an almost ink blank with only a hint of red at edges in the light. Half inch tan head stayed a few minutes. No noticable carbonation. Minimal lacing.  The scent of this beer has a huge chocolate strength. There is a strong alcohol smell. Subtle not of dates and caramel finish the aroma off with a complex hit.  A very strong tasting beer. The flavors of chocolate strike the tongue quite strongly. There is also a very strong bite of the alcohol. There is a lingering taste of bready raisins.  A nice thick beer. Hangs to the sides of the mouth. Not much carbonation to move flavors.  Quite a good beer in the style. A little to strong for an everyday beer. Would go very nice as an enjoyable beer with a cigar as an afer dinner drink. If looking for something in this style, don't pass this up.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,BlindPig,3.32,"It poured with a 1/4"" tan head. Black and deep brown. Head fades at medium pace to a thin lacing. S- Coffee aromas mixed in with some deep rich malts. T-Bit of coffee flavor with really nothing else. Coffee flavor wasn't to strong and grew in after taste. The whole overall flavors were not to strong at all. There was also a little bitterness in aftertaste. M- More carbonation than I expected. Had about medium carbonation and a medium body. Was sticky also. D- It was a very simple beer lacking complexity. Not to strong flavors. Not much going on with the beer at all. Smelled good though. Is drinkable but nothing special at all.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Beer pours a nice dark brown with a hefty head that seems to stay relatively firm, ala rootbeer float. Smell is very roasty!  Taste is very smooth at first, sweet and mocha-y. Then it grows into a pretty heavy alcohol finish...a bit of a burner really. Mouth is really round; the tongue really fills up with flavor.  This is a great return beer. But not a session beer.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,kmbaker,4.13,"holy smokes i forgot how much i like this beer! Brian 700 hooked me up with one the other night and it was like finding an old 20 dollar bill in my laundry from way back when. anyhow on with it....  pours a dark rich black. light cream mocha head, residing into a thin and consistent lacing leaving some oily blotches here in there on the surface.. thats what i like to see on a stout!  Notes of vanilla and bourbon and the nose mixed with whiffs of black patent  taste: chocolate to snappy and zesty black patent sort of smokiness and finishes with what comes to me as an anise characteristic spiking the front of the palette as the robust smokey notes work on the peripheral of the tastebuds. aftertaste lingers and finishes with what you would expect from a shot of expresso. creamy mouthfeel somewhat oily.  dangerously drinkable for this caliber of beer.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,jackorain,4.62,"I've had this bottle since the summer of 2005. Just split it with my mother-in-law.  Poured into oversized whine glasse, for a lack of tulip or snifter.  A-dark thick black, what little head poured out immediately fell to a thin ring that provided some lacing. Almost no light gets through.  S-Unbeleiveable aroma, coffe, chocolate, dark roasted malt and hop.  T-very dark roasted malt hits strong right up front, followed by a nce hop bite. I'd imagine the hops may have even dissapated some over the year I have held it. Molasses, coffe, chocolate on the very long lingering finish. really good.

Taste is smooth with a lot of roasted malt, a bit of bitter chocolate, coffee and hops. There is a seemingly never ending bitterness to the finish. Overall, North Coast really did an excellent job with this RIS and should be commended.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Brian700,4.1,"Again another beer I got from nflmvp a few days ago.  This one pours dark black with a brown head that doesn't leave to much in the way of lacing.  The aroma is of coffee, black patent, bitter chocolate, alcohol.  The flavor is chocolate and coffee mixed whith alcohol and plum. There is a nice alcohol warming but it isn't as chewy as I thought it would be.  The mouthfeel is nice and creamy. It is full bodied with medium carbonation.  This is a very drinkable beer especially for an imperial stout. Definately worth picking up.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,MLegendre,4.49,"A: Jet black with some slight transparencies towards the bottom of the glass. Very thin tan head that disapates before it even gets anywhere.  S: Very very roasty which I love. Chocolate, toffee, coffee... pretty much anything you would expect from a IRS, only WAY roastier!  T: First taste the roasted malts and chocolate dominate the palate followed by some licorice and a slight sting of alcohol. Aftertaste is very bitter like a strong coffee leaving the tongue throbbing and begging for more. Sticks to the tongue like glue. I can taste it for a long, long time after I've swallowed. A little alchol burn is noticable after a while, but for the most part it's pretty well hidden. As it warms the malts become stronger while the alcohol becomes weaker. Tastes better and better as you drink it.  M: There is a slight burn of alcohol on the way down, but not too bad. Carbonation is a little high.  D: This has quickly became one of my favorite beers of all time. I can drink it like water and I drink it very often. Very easy to drink for something of such high ABV. I really can't see it getting much better than this.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,LordChesterfield,4.06,"I've been hearing about this beer for a while and I finally was lucky enough to find a fourpack at hyvee for 9 bucks. I went back a few days later and not a trace was left. It pours black. Not inky black like some others but dark enough. The amazing part is that you can see the bubbles rise from the bottom of the glass to the top! I don't know what is causing it and it's the firts time i've ever seen in it. Head retention is pretty good not that I care. It smells like the typical Imperial stout, burnt. It tastes pretty complex for suck a heavy beer. I can detect a bit of citrus and rose on the front of the toungue. Maybe a little bitter for my taste but still delicious. The picture of Rasputin on the front is great. I'm surprised I found this in august as i usually thing of imperial stout as a winter drink.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Kayakjim16,4.13,"Poured absolutely pitch black into the venerable old globe glass, with little head and a small amount of lacing. The smell is of dark chocolate and coffee with a matching, very dry taste and noticeable alcohol in the finish. The mouth feel is very heavy and silky. As enjoyable as this beer is, I dont think that I would tempt fate by having two, but this is easily a beer that one could have in place of a brandy and desert after a good meal.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,uconnalum2,3.95,"I looked forward to trying this beer. It poured black with only a small head that went down to mostly a ring around the glass. I held it up to a lamp and could not see any light coming through at all. It had a roasted smell similar to coffee beans. The taste started bitter and then turned to coffee and some bitter, dark chocolate. There is some alcohol in the aftertaste and it lasted a long time. The mouthfeel is the most interesting thing about this beer. It is smooth, oily and thick and coats the inside of your mouth. This is a slow sipper. It went down easier as it warmed up (and maybe as it warmed me up). Overall, this is an intense beer. The bitterness, heaviness and ABV keeps me from having too many. I'd like to try one that has aged to see if it smooths out a bit.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Wasatch,4.43,"Revisited 1 Feb 15  Poured into a chalice a very nice black color, very nice carbonation with a nice one-finger creamy/fizzy med tan head, which leaves some nice sticky lacing and a huge island in the middle of the glass. The nose is malty, with some very nice dark notes (chocolate, toffee, and some coffee), slight vanilla. The taste is very nice, malty, dark stuff. Medium body, with a slight dry finish, ABV is hidden very well for a 9% brew. Overall a very tasty brew, it's been here in UT for a few years, and I'm very glad it is. Highly recommended RIS at a very nice price per 12 oz. bottle.  A - Pours a nice black color, lots of carbonation, small fizzy head which dissapates quickly, not much lacing at all.  S - Scents of roasted malts, and toffee/caramel.  T - The taste is slightly bitter and of roasted malts and caramel.  M - Medium body.  D - Very drinkable.

S- sweet, chocolaty coffee smell, molasses, liquorice, hops  T- complex malty chocolate coffee, alcohol peeking through  M- heavy, creamy, bubbly. Takes a while to drink because it's so heavy.

Great aftertaste, some, roasted bittersweet cocoa beans and good hops. Full and sturdy mouthfeel. Powdery somehow. Some coating and very slick sensation.

112,412,lancecjohnson,4.08,"It was difficult for me to figure out the ""drinkability"" score on this one. On one hand, it's not the kind of beer that I can see myself having every day, as it's a bit on the strong side, flavor-wise. On the other hand, when I'm in the mood for one, it's perfect. That's the trick I guess - being in the mood for one.  That said, this beer almost looks syrupy when you pour it into a glass. You definitely notice a distinct mouthfeel with it, as it's smooth and creamy.  The high alchohol content is not that noticeable, but this is the kind of beer that hits you from your tongue all the way up to the bridge of your nose.  For me, the perfect time for this beer is at night while I'm settling down and watching TV. It usually takes me about an hour to get through, as it's not the sort of thing that I could - or even want to - just pound down.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,DaveFL1976,4.35,"Now there's a fine beer. Black, black body. There should be a word that expresses a darker color than black. This would be it. It's topped with a dark tan head, too. The head settles down into a skim but never completely disappears. The smell is dry, bitter bakers chocolate. But sweet, too. An excellent balance. Taste is huge. It all wraps itself up into a beery, chocolaty dream with 9% alcohol. Taste is smooth, but with a bit of alcohol harshness at the very last part of the swallow. This is a fine beer.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,Toddv29424,4.41,"I'm never really sure what to give a beer for its appearance as opposed to what I have seen in the past, but this beer most definitely deserves the top. After its poured there is absolutely no light that passes through it, even when the glass is tilted. Really Impressive. The smell has to be teased out but is mostly like sweet grains and dark malts. The taste is just phenomenal. Its big, but is really well mixed. There is a lot of traditional stout flavor, but lots of chicory on top of it. The mouthfeel and drinkability are both great, again with a big flavor that is really well balanced.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,cabsandking,4.92,"The nose offers plenty of anticipation with prunes, molasses and prunes. Thick mouth. The beginning is smokey, earthy, toasted malts. Bittersweet chocolate notes. A little sharp tartness rounds out the hops balance. Towards the bottom some traces of woodsy oak, port wine, and even cherry come through. This beer I will definitly drink again, and probably North Coast's top beer.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,OStrungT,3.65,"This beer pours a jet black color letting absolutely no light shine through. It boasts a thick brown head that fades surprisingly fast, leaving too few laces.  This beer has a huge malty aroma. It smells of roasted malts. Licorice aroma is present. I smell a huge coffee aroma. Some chocolate is present. I smell a slight hop aroma also.  This beer tastes coffee like. It has a bittersweet chocolate flavor. Hops are present. A slight fig like flavor is also making an appearence. The alcohol is hidden well.  This full bodied beer goes down smooth, leaving a coffee like aftertaste. It is a little too carbonated, but not so much as to detract from the beer.  This beer would probably not make a good session beer. It is high in alcohol, and it tastes quite aggressive.  Overall: Although this beer is good, it is far from my favorite Imperial Stout. The aggressive flavor can sometimes be cloying. I will drink it again, but usually I buy it because of its great availability. It is slightly overrated.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,AmorousAngel,4.01,"Poured opaque black with a small brownish head. Small brownish ring remained around the glass for most of the life of the drink.  Predominantly coffee and alcohol aroma with hints of chocolate.  Lovely roasted malt flavor and coffee followed by stong hops. The flavor really lingers for a while after each sip.  Very smooth feel, with just a bit of a burn from the alcohol.  Not as heavy as some imperial stouts I've tried. Very good for sipping. I would probably rate this higher if the hops were a little less apparent.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,mjc410,4.34,"The pour into my La Moneuse tulip raises a massive, effervescent head, the color of old parchment. Falls pretty quickly to one finger. Very loud bubble popping. The nose is wildly chocolatey, sweet, and full of coffee. Strong notes of alcohol and port come through. Taste is very bitter, but with a sweet finish. Incredible chocolate covered espresso bean aftertaste. Body is massive, the biggest I've had in memory. So incredibly smooth. Pairs very well with some strong chocolate. A very slow sipper, but a joy.  Develops some vinous and milk chocolate notes when paired with chocolate. Interesting. Becomes less bitter and rich.  This has improved so much with a year in the cellar. Fresh, it was abusingly bitter, and, if I remember well, far too hoppy. That has all changed, and I have some more left!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

It also had a slight bitter coffee-like taste. An interesting contrast between the sweet chocolate flavors and the bitter coffee.  M - Very soft and smooth. It is a heavy beer.  D - It is a very good stout. It is very powerful in terms of ABV, which is a slight drawback. I wanted to have many more but two was my limit.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Exceptional coffee and chocolate aftertaste, with spicy pepper.  M: Dry chocolate with a hop and alcohol bite. Exceptionally smooth.

It has a smell of espresso, dark roasted malt, and bitter hops- really great.  Great long flavor of roasted malt, coffee, followed by a stinging bitterness with a long, long finish.  Mouthfeel is creamy, maybe a little overcarbonated and a little too light in body. The alcohol is very well hidden despite all that.  Very drinkable. I'm a sucker for anything with a long bitter finish and some complexity. If the body were a little heftier, this would be a 5 as well.

112,412,beveritt,4.23,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a standard pint glass. No indication of when this thing was brewed. I got it as a single.  Appearance: Opaque. I hold my glass up to the light and cannot see through. Looks black, maybe a very dark brown. The initial head was less than a finger and quickly dissipated. It looks like there is a fair amount of bubbles coming up, judging by the activity on the surface.  Smell: Chocolate and roasted malts are the overwhelming scent.  Taste: Wow, this is like a kick in the taste buds! You can get a hint of the high alcohol level, but it is really balanced out by the large number of flavors. Roasted malts are probably the strongest flavor, nice and dark roasted malts. Coffee would be next, followed by chocolate. There is almost a sweet aftertaste, maybe the high ABV. You can feel it warm your stomach.  Mouthfeel. Just the right level of carbonation for a RIS, helps present the flavors well.  Drinkability: Maybe not the best thing to try in the middle of August, but this would be great to warm you up in the winter. I think the high ABV would preclude having too many, but there is a lot more here than just high alcohol level. Great beer.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,peabody,4.1,Two fingers of suds on this Russian Stout. Not much lacing but the bubbles stay with the beer quite a while. I smell chocolate and coffee and some sort of fruit/raisin. Bittersweet is what I would describe the flavor to be. It starts out bitter but ends up with a sweet dark toffee flavor. I love the aftertaste on this one. While not as good as the Stone it is still a great beer. I could drink a couple of these at one sitting but wouldn't want to down a case of them.,North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Litterbean,4.48,"Black as black can be. Stouterific, indeed. One fingered tan head that diminishes to a frothy cap that's thicker around the fringe, clinging to my imperial pint glass.  Ah, the sweet smell of a well-made stout. Sweet, dark chocolate notes intermingled with the pleasant aroma of bitter coffee, alcohol, oak, and cherries (with some medicinal notes as well, hooray!).  Yes, it tastes great also. Bitter and dry, this baby has a whole lot of roasted flavor going on. Coffee, chocolate, and alcohol blend together with other wondrous estery flavors to make a thoroughly delicious beer. Feels good on the tongue and in the back of the throat. Scarily drinkable for such a ""thick"" beer.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,MusicmanSD,3.6,"Oh my god, you cant even see through it! Now this is a stout! First taste was like an uber concentrated form of Guinness Extra. Bitter as f$#^! In fact, I felt the effects of the alcohol about three sips into it. Then it hit my yacking mechanism.  I couldn't even finish it halfway. God I feel like a prick. Wasted such a good beer on a drain pour, but it was just undrinkable to the max. Overwhelming flavors topped with alcohol that seemed like there was 5 shots of rum in it. Maybe I'm not ready for a real beer, or the other beers I had earlier in the day maxed out my consumption for the day. I'll start with this next time because it was just beautiful beer. Darkest I've ever seen with a head that filled a hefe glass with just a 12 oz bottle. Suprised that the lacing wasn't that heavy. Very well done on the appearance, but drinkability? Horrid. Don't get me wrong, the taste is awesome in about 200 different ways, but blah!

112,412,Beerzebub,4.49,"Black, dense tan head that persists and leaves some lace. Smells of chocolate, raisins, buttery toffee, sweet coffee, molasses cookie, cinnamon, dark rum, solvent. Layer upon layer, becoming indescribable. Some compound in durian? Paint? No, I can't pin it down. In any case, the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. This smell is veryy complex, yet completely cohesive. One of my favorite smells of any beer I have had.  Taste matches nose well, only missing something ephemeral that I cannot pin down. Luscious flavor and mouthfeel. Chewy and delicious. Cohesive. Alcohol is noticeable, but very well integrated. Perfect touch of roasty bitterness. Finish lingers, with rum-raisiny alcohol taking over.  This is an immensely enjoyable beer.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Doomcifer,4.55,"As usual, pulled one these babies right out of the cupboard and got a glass to accompany it.  Pours a black as midnight black, looking like overused motor oil. Great brown head that sticks around, leaving behind great lacing. Smells of dark chocolate, rasin sweetness, hints of alcohol...hard to stop smelling really. One of the best tasting Imperial Stouts I've ever had. Tastes of dark chocolate, coffee, malty sweetness, with a light hop dryness hitting you in the middle, ending off with an alcohol warming and lots of hop bitterness. The coffee/chocolate overtones staying with your palate long after each sip. Mouthfeel was pretty oily and thick, but not sludge like thick as would be expected from the appearance. Very pleasant creaminess and not too much carbonation. I've tried many Imperial Stouts as it is a favorite genre of mine, and Old Rasputin blows many out of the water. It's not that hard to find around where I live and the price isn't exhorbitant either. Northcoast should be proud of this exemplary brew.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,HoustonTX,4.18,"12oz. bottle poured into Chimay goblet.  A - Incredibly dark brown, white frothy head. Nice head, and lacing retention.  S - Licorice malt/strong alcohol/chocolate/spicey notes.  T&M - Full-bodied. Taste upfront has tones of chocolate, infused with a strong alcoholic bite. Hop bitterness is definitely there upfront, and also near the end. Medicinal phenols bring a sharp bite to the palate. Licorice waves come upfront and near the end, spicey and awakening on the palate. Burnt tones, earthy and nutty also come through. Aftertaste is smooth and creamy with a small amount of bitter, that slowly fades to dry and then lingers for a good while.  D - Great for such a big beer.  An excellent Russian Imperial Stout, has a lot of compexity and depth. Rich, satisfying, and friendly on the palate. Definitely check this one out.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Damian,3.64,"Poured an amber brown/black with a small head that faded quickly. Virtually no lacing present.  Smell was very malty rich and hoppy with hints of dark chocolate, coffee and toffee.  Taste was espresso-like, hoppy and bitter, with the bitterness becoming more intense as the beer moved along the palate. Alcohol flavor was very strong.  Mouthfeeel was full bodied and heavy. Moderate carbonation.  Definitely a sipping beer.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,acrawf6,4.64,"Pours out pitch black with foamy tan head. Nice lacing.  Aroma. Strong licorice aroma. Under that it has very nice chocolate smell with espresso notes to it. It is an interesting smell because I see it as sweet and dry at the same time. Hops really give this a nice crispness, yet it seems creamy. Very interesting.  Taste. Very nice RIS. Starts off with a nice bitterness, thick flavors of malts too, very roasted malts, and some bits of burnt malts. Also has a slight yeasty and waxy character to it. As it warms up, I get a good amount more of the licorice tastes to it. Aftertaste is roasted malts with black coffee hints with a nice warming.  Mouthfeel. Very full mouthfeel, creamy and chewy. Nice amount of carbonation. Balance is excellent- Im overwhelmed with both the malt character and the hops.  Overall. A great RIS and an incredible beer! A perfect sipper, yet Im drinking this quicker than I expected, I could probably finish it in about 30-40 minutes. Just great balance and great flavors. One excellent beer I am glad I can pick up in baton rouge.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,brushpig,3.68,"Found a 4 pack at Trader Joes in Chicago, but you can find it almost everywhere here.  The appearance is interesting, very very shimmering black with a tan head that unfortunately diminishes rather quickly.  The aroma is like dark espresso coffee with a light friut smell as well. Not too powerful.  This is a very good imperial stout, with it's coffee like flavors, chocalate, and alcohol bite, however the fruity flavors left a strange aftertaste in my mouth. Nothing too terrible. Still a very fine beer  Wouldn't have to many of them in one sitting,a little overwhelming. But worth a try.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,dancinwillie,4.13,"My first review, so here goes:  appearance: dark black, with an off white head that drops to 1/8 inch, and stays put.  smell: chocolate, roasted grains, maybe a hint of alcohol, but not overwhelming.  taste: pretty much as in the nose, without much of the alcohol coming through. Nice and chewy, maybe some oatmeal, or other head grains. Good balance between bitter, and sweet. I could drink a few of these, and not feel like I'd overdone it.  Overall, a fine example of the style, and another fine beer from North Coast.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,tfp4268,1.62,"I know this beer gets rave reviews, however...  I have enjoyed other RIS's but this one is just plain ugh.  It looks good enough, very dark brown, almost black, ruby around the edge against a light. Nice brown two finger head, goes down to a pretty lace after a while.  Smell is a little strange, very fruity, but not much else.  Taste...ARRRGH! Fruit and alcohol, kinda like Boone's Farm or something. Yuck!  Mouthfeel is as it should be, kinda thick, but not really thick.  Drinkability Well...I bought four of these, and have managed to choke down two, but the other two are probobly destined for the trash hopper.  Like I said, I have enjoyed other RIS's before, Sam Smith's is my fave, but I think Old Rasp is a little high on the ABV at 9%. It makes it too heavy more my taste buds to handle.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,TheBeerWolf,4.23,"Between this and Stone Russian Stout I am now a fan of the this style. The beer pours like black crude. Thick and dark with creamy tan head. Smelling immeditely after opening the bottle I definately get a smell of smoke, chocolate, and malt. The taste is slightly bitter at first but then goes on to sweet smokiness. Hints of smoked almonds and a bit of coco. You can definately taste the alcohol in the background. Moutfeel is not bad at all either. I prefer Stone Russian Stout by just a hair because the Russian Stout has just a tiny but more alcohol bite which I prefer. But don't get me wrong I would drink either happily. The drinkability is a tiny bit better with Old Rasputin but some of that might be because it comes in smaller bottles so its a little more cold then having a 22 of Stone sitting there getting warm.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,andrewm190,4.27,"This is quite the beer. The Abv is one of the most intense experiences one will have with this beer. The benefit (besides the obvious) is that having such a high abv encourages the drinker to drink at a moderate pace and thus enjoy the taste that the beer has to offer. I am a big fan of the darker beers and this one is one of my new favorites. The smell is unique and powerful. The taste is strong and more complex than simply a high abv content. there are two distinct tastes with an underlying chocolaty taste. The mouthfeel is very nice. the alcohol does tend to make its presence felt a little bit, but the beer leaves a nice coating in the aftertaste. Its a drinkable beer; its a little intense.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Poser,4.33,"I picked this one up in Atlanta.  Appearance: Darkest beer I've seen so far. I held it up to a 100W bulb and couldn't see anything. Has a good, dark head.  Smell: Very chocalate-like with strong aromas of expresso and malts.  Taste: The malts hit you like a brick. It tastes a lot like a chocolate expresso. The aftertaste stays with you for a very long time.  Mouthfeel: Full-bodied  Drinkability: It's hard to drink more than one in a single sitting. High ABV and full body makes you want a glass of water.  Overall, I was very impressed with this stout. I would recommend it to anyone.

112,412,fank2788,4.4,"I would like to start by saying that this is my first russian imperial stout so I don't have anything to compare this beer to but I'll do my best. I poured this from the bottle into a glass and was really impressed with the deep black color, it has only a hint of ruby hues if you hold it up to a light. The head is a dark khaki tan that laces the glass nicely. The smell is really complex roasted and chocolate malts dominate. The first couple of sips present a bitterness that seems almost overwhelming but this soon mellows out once you become used to it and then you can really taste the chocolate malt flavors. Despite the high alcohol content the alcohol isn't that noticable but the beer does have a nice warming quality. I don't know if I would want to try drinking more than one in a sitting just because of the really powerful flavor but it is definitely one i'll buy again.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Orrshow,4.33,"Appearance  This Stout is as black as they come with a plentiful amount of tan head. It stays reasonably well on the top and leaves some lacing.  Smell  Strong roasted malts on the nose to begin. There is some chocolate, toasted coffee bean, alcohol, and earthiness as well. A good effect which makes me anxious to sip.  Taste  Very roasted malt and burnt wood flavors kick you right in the ass when you take a sip of this. There is more coffee flavor than I expected from the smell which is pretty nice. I can taste slight amounts of chocolate as well along with a pleasant bitterness. A very slight hint of prunes arises as well. On top of it all alcohol makes itself known in a nice warm way. This beer tastes excellent.  Mouthfeel  A decent mouthfeel. Carbonation was slightly high but I could get over that because this one was nice and creamy.  Drinkability  Great. I had an easy time here.  This is a robust and balanced ale which Im glad to have acquired. Makes me want to try more of this style in a huge way.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,MSchae1017,4.65,"This beer was tasted in a imperial pint glass from a bottle.  This beer pours jet black with a creamy tan head that holds amazingly well the whole way down the glass and leaves some impressive lace. The smell is sweet roasted and dark chocolate malts. A very nice very strong flavor. The taste is also great. Fully of dark roasted malts and chocolate malts. There is a great sweetness to this beer which is immediately balanced by some huge bitterness. The mouthfeel is exceptional. This can be described as chewey and creamy. Just fantastic. Overally Highly drinkable. A fantastic RIS.

T: Malts up front, real bitter hoppy aftertaste, followed by roasty malts (coffee and chocolate are defiantly there) that linger.  M: Moderate carbonation and pretty full mouthfeel.  D: The bitterness seems to build here, and the high abv makes it tough to drink more than one.

Reviews would be similar, tho at home was the better version: warmer = more taste & aroma.  A: Almost perfectly black, with the faintest hints of copper red at the edges. One finger light tan-colored head. A beautiful stout.  S: Rich coffee and chocolate, grows more intense the warmer the beer gets.  T: The chocolate and coffee are here with a definite lingering sweetness. Heavy bittering hops initially which evolve into the sweeter flavors. Alcohol warming and fruit flavors come out with warming. A decadent group of well-balanced flavors.  M: Medium/full body. Slightly thick & heavy for a stout. Lingering bittersweetness.

Also a jet black color that is traditional of Russian Imperial Stouts.  It smells like coffee and dark cocoa and a little sweet. A sweet licorice and fruitiness that are just great. I believe I smell black currants which were described in the Dark Lord, but I have not had any before.  The taste is sweet and bitter at the same time with spiciness. Coffee (expresso), licorice, dark fruit, and flowery hops are all flavors that hit me very nicely.  Mouthfeel is very nice and smooth, smooth and a little creamy feel is in it.

112,412,instrumentality,4.1,"Poured a thick brown-black with three fingers of creamy brown head that settled into a thin pool of lace of various shades of white and brown.  The odor conjured images of chocolate malt with a shot of espresso.  The smells translated well to my palate, somewhat bitter with the added flavor of red wine.  Initial mouthfeel seemed a bit chalky, oddly enough, but intensity-wise, it was pretty mellow with only a slight burn of alcohol and minimal carbonation. The aftertaste was just a bit too strong and coating, a bitter mix of espresso and red wine.  I was disappointed to find that this brew smelled better than it tasted--not that the taste was bad, but I expected more. To take a more positive spin on this, for an RIS, it's well balanced and fairly easy to drink.  I'll probably save the last couple bottles of my four-pack and let them age a bit. I have a feeling a little time will make this one a real treat.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Head is very thick and tight, lightly tan and creamy like froth on coffee.  S - rich smell of roasted grains, nuts, coffee beans. Backed up by firm earthy hop aroma, English hops. Hints of alcohol. Smells like a stout.  T - I have rarely given out 5's, but this one deserves it in the taste category. Rich and very complex. Initial malt sweetness like bitter, dark chocolate mixed with licorice, espresso, dark fruits, followed by assertive hop bitterness and earthy hop flavor. Extremely well balanced beer. Warming aftertaste of alcohol. Lots of different flavors bouncing around in my mouth on this one.  M - very, very smooth and silky despite alcohol content. Very full bodied mouthfeel, but not overwhelming. Alcohol is slightly warming. Carbonation is moderate to low. Slightly sweet finish.  D - amazing brew, give it a try.

112,412,Liquids,3.91,"Looks delicious, dark black with a red-brown hue peeking out from the bottom of the glass, with a massive, bubly and creamy head that is comparable to the color of, say, wheat bread, for lack of a better comparative. Smells like an american variation on the grassy english ale aroma--more piney and resinous--but the aroma is rather gentle for an imperial stout. Hmm. More like a straght ahead stout. The taste is malty and focused, with a charred finish that tastes, again, mostly like a standard stout. This may have some time on it, in which case, considering style, this is how it would taste after reaching Russia. The expectedly intense hops have mellowed out I think, comparing it to when I had it fresh on tap months prior. The hops again are american, piney, and slightly floral even. Mouthfeel is medium and well- or possibly over- carbonated. Stout like in feel, not as heavy as anticipated, but not light either. Overall, I am not a fan of the hop profile here. Nor do I love the less than smooth, charred malts that acompany it in the finish. This is a very good beer, but it is not the best of style. Tastes more like an american stout than an imperial stout, but it somehow hides the 8% well. I love the label and russian phrases. North Coast is consistently good, despite brewing beers that don't personally appeal to my palate enough to be my pick as favorites given their style. Drinking this left me dreaming of Storm King, which I find delicious both on tap and in the bottle, while this was absolutely better on tap.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,JBStith,4.32,"Old Rasputin. I've had it in both bottle and draft, but bottle most recently. As I remember, it wass slightly better on draft. However, this is an exceptional beer regardless of serving type.  A: Dark like crude oil with nice tan head. Initial head is about 1/4 inch with slight retention and lacing.  S: Acrid smell of dark roasted coffe and black patent malts.  T: Similar to smell. Great roasted, coffee and acrid flavors supported by slight malt and good bitterness. Alcohol was not readily noticeable, but became more apparent as the beer warmed up. Became slightly sweeter as well.  M: Mouthfeel was not too heavy, though heavier than most regular stouts.  D: Due to high alchol content, I don't recommend drink more than 1-2 of these per session. However, very drinkable from a flavor and body point of view.  Overall, a very nice example of Russian Imperial Stout. I will have this again and recommend it to others, esopecially stout fans.

Smells of coffee, caramel, and grapes (reminds me of something like a shiraz from the wine world). Tastes unlike it smells. I taste wood and oak, although the coffee and caramel is still present. High marks for mouthfeel - it is creamy and lingers nicely. The alcohol is masked nicely - especially at first - but it becomes more present as the beer warms.

112,412,Lupin,4.87,"My third tasting of this brew. 12oz bottle kept at standard fridge temperature. Rasputin's hypnotic techniques have reined me in. I love this brew, but I can only take one in at a time.  Pours an utterly opaque black coffee. I violently throw the last 5 ounces or so in to coax out a 1""+ roasted sandy head. Minor lacing at the top of the glass. Easily the best smelling brew I have ever sampled.  The taste is utterly dominated by a raw, dark chocolate. There is no other way to describe it. It even leaves the same dry feeling on your tongue that a bar of any dark chocolate will provide. Bitter bitter bittersweet.  I wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who likes beer and coffee or beer and chocolate of any type. I warned my dad, who loves dark chocolate, that he'd better drink the bottle I offered him that night or else it was liable to disappear from the fridge.

The smell is of roasted barley with some malty sweetness and notes of coffee.  The taste is huge! Lots of roasted barley, chocolate, and coffee with some grain and a bit of anise. Very very complex and very rewarding to my taste buds. I've had this one a few times in the past and it never fails to impress me with its flavour and how well it hides the rather substantial 9%abv.

This was one of my first better beers (before I was a BA) and I have tried it since both in the bottle and on-tap, and even have one aging, but somehow haven't reviewed it. 12 oz. stubby with no freshness date. It pours almost black with a quarter-inch of light brown head that reduces to a collar and doesn't leave much lacing. It smells of big, dark roasted malts, cocoa, chocolate, blackberry, and chocolate-covered cherries. It tastes like coffee, dark, unsweet chocolate, and lots of hops (green, piney, leafy, oily, maybe citric) that contribute a big bitterness. The beer has a good balance, with lots of malts and hops, on top of a medium to thick body that leaves a very long finish. A great beer that I will always come back to revisit.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,elricorico,4.23,"Pours quite dark with a strong redness to it. In the glass it appears black, and keeps up a creamy tan head. More head retention than I expect from a high alcohol beer of this style. Lacing left everywhere.  My nose detects alcohol and an almost burnt malt aroma. Bitter chocolate and charcoal. Coffee bean becomes more and more prevelant the warmer the beer gets.  Smooth into the mouth, this is fairly sweet overall. Dark roasted coffee flavour with a hint of vanilla. Finishes with a bit of charcoal and alcohol, warming the throat all the way to the belly. Alcohol is not overdone though, it feels very appropriate.  This beer is relatively thick and carbonation is low. Both good for the style, but nothing extraordinary here.  Quite nice, perhaps my favourite of the Imperial Stouts I've had.

112,412,Fish113d,4.13,"Pouring into a tulip glass from a bottle a bit chilled, it pours a black color with a brown, dense 1/4"" surface layer that sat on top of the brew for most of the tasting.  Aroma leads on a bit of black liquorice (sp.); roasty chocolate aromas also are prominent. A decent amount of alcohol hits my sinuses as well. A slight oak aroma also.  Sipping, it reveals a lot of roasty nuttiness (almonds) w/ dark baker's chocolate. Lots of coffee w/ a dry oak barrel flavor also seems to come across my palate. On the finish, I sense a bit of the black liquorice flavor i was smelling just a few minutes earlier.  Mouthfeel is overall, nicely balanced. Carbonation is nice; very drying finish. A bit of alcohol on my palate; huge body!  Overall, the hype around this one is well deserved.

112,412,jetfanzee,4.35,"A: Liquid Midnight in the glass. No light gets through this dark black pour. About half an inch of foamy tan head that slowly melts into a ring around the glass, nice lacing as you drink.  S: Strong coffee, dark chocolate, and a slight licorice smell on first sniff. Maybe some toffee but just a hint.  T: Sweetness as this beauty first hits the tongue, but the bitterness of the hops stops it from being overwhelming. Slight alcohol burn in the back of the throat along with the hops leaves your mouth calling for the next sip.  M: A little thinner than I would have thought from the color and head. Also a little more carbonation than I usually like, but it helps cut through the sweet start.  D: This beer definitely wants to travel in groups! One just won't do it. I don't know if I want this all night, but 2 after a hard day will definitely take the edge off.

Smells of bitter cooking choclate, black currant, roasted chocolate malt, roasted coffee, vanilla, and a dense hop aroma.  Tastes of a bitter dark choclate bar. With a big roasted malt component and grainy drying hops to help balance. A finish of coffee, some smoke, burnt flavors, heavy cream, and a few choice dark fruits.

I drank this one side by side with the Raspberry Weyerbacher, which has currently taken over as the best reviewed beer in Backer2004's history to this point.

Liquid dessert coming right up.  T: Just great. Begins a balanced smooth freefall across the palate...making a play for one of the smoothest Imperial stouts then switches gears into a sultry sweetness...only just for a moment until the hops bitterness sends a swaggering dash down the center of the tongue then finally relenquishs control to the roasted malt burnt character that massages the side-back of the tongue.

Taste is very powerful, sweeter than most, with a noticable alcohal flavor (not suprising considering the ABV). A bitter aftertaste leaves you wanting more. A good balance in flavor, not much carbonation which adds to the mouthfeel. I could have a couple of these after dinner or for a nice nightcap. This is not to pricey and is well worth trying.

Strong flavor with dark chocolate and coffee, with a harsh bitterness that comes directly from the alcohol. Hops do come through at the end of each sip - and definitely at higher temperatures (though not invisible at colder).  Overall - an excellent imperial stout.

112,412,hero27,4.23,"12 oz bottle. 9% abv.  Pours a menacing dark mahogany color. Bubbles cascade up & down to form a perfect head of frothy tan foam (that seems to have the staying power of Rasputin himself)..it just will not die. Smell is dominant dark roasted malts with fresh ground coffee & black licorice tagging along. The taste has more of a hop kick than you'd expect, and creates a nice bitterness. As this approaches room temperature, it really matures into the beer it's supposed to be, with the dark chocolate flavors keeping you yearning for more. I always pick up some of this when I find it..unfortunately, I can't get it in my immediate area yet. Always mentioned among the great stouts, this is one that is certainly worth trying.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,jwc215,4.45,"From 12 oz. bottle, poured black with thin tan head that became a well-retained lacing. The aroma was robust with roasted coffee, black currants and a hint of chocolate with a noticeable alcohol bite. The taste was of robust, rich coffee - on the thick side. There were hints of black currents and some plum-like fruitiness in the background. There was a great balance of bitter and sweet with a touch of smoky charcoal. Overall, the taste was very well-balanced, rich and complex. Some of the complexities were slightly masked by the alcohol. There was a touch of sweet stickiness at the finish, though it began more bitter. It was very drinkable - a worthwhile and delicious treat!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Normally this brew has a nice hop presence, almost over the top. Roasty, charred and good. On the nitro, while all these characterstics are there, just expect them to be dumbed down.  Notes: excellent beer. Why is it on nitro? No reason, in my opinion this is just a way to market it as a guinness...I heard this many times throughout the night...bartender "" its similair to a guiness but slightly stronger"" ...ok.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

As drank, lace continued to coat glass. Half way through beer, lace continued to cling to top of the glass and coat the entire glass all they way down. A Bback beer held up to the light, this had the *slightest* red translucence. This was a fantastic looking beer.  S: Notes are sparse here. ""Malty? Spices."" That's all I wrote. It was pleasant, but nothing that merits more detail.  T: Smooth and creamy. Chocolate over coffee flavors. Moderately chocolatey with a sharp coffeesque bitter finish accented by a slight tase of spices. Alchohol is well hidden by coffee like flavors.  M: Light carbonation tingles and smooths the beer. Incredibly well balanced. The bitter after taste is slight  D: The combination of pleasant flavors and great mouthfeel combine to make this a very well balanced beer. This makes the beer very easy to drink.

112,412,SilentSabre,4.54,"This will be my second of three planned reviews of this beer. My only problem with it, is that is has too much hop bitterness when fresh. It's almost like eating mouthfulls of grapefruit and chocolate pieces together and washing them down with coffee. Not exactly my idea of a tasty treat. So, what I have planned, is to rate this aged about 6 months, and then again in a year. So far, tonights session shows that Rasputin does, with time, improve. The 6 month old example poured the same colour as a fresh one, obviously. The smell, however, seemed noticeably sweeter. Lots of stewed fruit and loads of chocolate and caramel. The taste, while improved, still has that hop bitterness that I am trying to age away. Mouthfeel was nice and smooth and drinkability was a bit better than a fresh example. We'll see what 12 - 14 months worth of aging does to Rasputin around Christmas '06 or Jan. '07.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Shaw,4.31,"Pours totally black with a substantial tan head that reduces to a thin layer with lovely lacing. This beer looks very nice.  It smells of caramel, toffee and roasted malts.  The taste is creamy, with many complex roasted flavors competing. The alcohol flavors are there but aren't as obvious as in other beers of the style. Very nice!  The body is wonderfully creamy.  Overall this is an excellent RIS. It's widely available, which gives you very little excuse to not try it.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

T- Malty coffee flavor that was really very good.  M- Fee carbonation start at the center of my tongue and spread out to my cheeks. Thick.  D- Drink slow to enjoy it.

Laces very well.  Smells of roasted caramel malt, and a hint of fruit.  Tastes very smooth, with strong espresso or coffee flavour and chocolate, that gradually gives way to a more tangy hoppiness.  The alcohol is masked well by the ingrediants and only shows it's head slightly. The roasted coffee flavour stays with you as you drink.  Very smooth and very flavourful.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,badbeer,4.92,"Very dark brown to almost black in color with a tan head that dissipates leaving some lacing. Nose is bursting with chocolate, coffee, maybe a hint of vanilla and cherry in there as well. Chocolate, espresso, and molasses with a hop bitterness in the end make up the taste.

112,412,doubleipa,4.5,"Stouts are becoming more and more one of my favorite styles and the Rasputin is near the top of the list. This baby pours black. Big thick head that mostly diminishes. Big time strong coffee aroma and wonderful dark chocolate. Taste matches the smell, for the most part. Not much of an alcohol taste, but one can feel the warmth. This is right on style. I've had this on tap and in the bottle. This is great and relatively cheap and accessible RIS.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,bort11,4.95,"I love the label design on this bottle. That crazy mad monk staring out from a smoky haze, I think that alone does a lot for the near-legendary status of this stout.  A- Poured into an Imperial pint glass. Pefectly black in the center. Dark reddish tints on the edges. Thick and creamy tan head, about a finger high from my pour. It receeds a little fast for me, but maintians a tight lace which makes up for it.  S- Espresso aromas POP! I can smell that from an arms length. Chocolate notes linger and some spices hint around the edges.  T- Excellent follow through from the smell. Espresso, chocalate, some maltiness, finishes with some hop bitterness. A little alcohol warmth. very well balanced.  M- It feels a little overcarbonated to me, but that is the only drawback. There is a chewiness to it that a RIS should have.  D- This is an all around great stout and one of my favorites. With this session, I had it with a slice of DQ ice cream cake. Oh man, that's good. This is a great dessert beer by itself, but it added to the overall enjoyment. Now that my local beer store is carying North Coast beers, I will keep this on hand.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,ILOVESTOUTS,4.68,"The name and bottle caught my attention immediedately while I was shopping.  The pour on this beer was perfect, with a thin tan head that developed. Once poured, it was completely opaque when held to the light.  The smell was strong with noticable aromas of roasted malt and alcohol.  The taste on this beer is out of this world. It is very complex with coffee and chocolate taste to this stout. At the end the hops come through with a slight bitterness, but not overwhelming.  The mouthfeel on this was the low point of this beer for me. It seemed a little thin. However, a mouthfeel such as this could be considered a strong point in a beer that did not have such a complex taste.  The drinkability of this beer is great in my book. I would not want to drink more than 3 or so. But if you like the style, and don't mind a strong taste of alcohol, then this is an imperial stout to enjoy after a long day.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Smells strongly of roasted coffee and very dark chocolate, some caramel. Tastes very strongly of roasted coffee with hints of sweet caramel, but the chocolate from the smell is missing from the taste. Alcoholic bite right at the end that I like very much. Mouthfeel is right where it should be for a stout. The only thing really holding this brew back is it's drinkability. With an alcohol content of 9%, I can't see myself drinking more than 2 a night.

112,412,ColoradoBobs,4.37,"Vigorous pour from the interestingly-shaped 12 ounce bottle yielded a large, firm tan head that lasts well and sticks to the glass as it tightens and becomes rocky; all this over an almost completely opaque black-ruby body. Don't call what it leaves on the glass ""lacing,"" but rather ""sheeting""!  Aroma is superb: vinous, figgy, chocolate-covered cherries with espresso. Is that cinnamon back there? Maybe some pink peppercorns? Definitely some caramel malt. Mmmm.  The taste fell off a bit from the aroma -- it smelled more complex than it tasted. The fruity notes seemed absent from the taste. Mind you, it's still good, but not up to ""sniff.""  Mouthfeel is a bit thinner than I thought -- still good, just not a chewy as I was hoping.  Good drinkability for an RIS, at only 9%.

S: Dark roast, vinous malty alcoholic stone fruit with molasses chocolate ashy husky whiffs. Yeasty Vegemite beef bullion. Malt acidity beckons a sip.  T: Sweet coffee, ash, molasses, herbal hops, lingering bitterness, large warm yeasty presence, dark cocoa chocolate milkshake. Graham crackers and wheaten scones lurk in the shadows. The finish is rounded by iron aerosols left over from John Henry's frenetic activities.  M: Sweet, cleanly balanced with bitterness, herbs, iron.

The smell is a robust toasted barley aroma. Strong hints of coffee and subtle hints of cocoa.  The taste mirrors the aroma. A very rich roasted coffee flavor with significant lingering coffee and cocoa flavors. Pleasant flavor lasts minutes after the sip. A suprisingly slight alcohol taste considering the ABV. The balance is very good in this stout - just enough hop to moderate the roasted flavor.  The mouthfeel is rich and long lasting. The lingering flavors produce a prolonged mouthfeel.

112,412,TheBungyo,4.57,"I consider this the textbook version of Russian Imperial Stouts. To be a good one you'd need to be close to this one. To be a great one, you'd need to exceed it. The pour gives way to what looks like it could be a mixture of cola and coffee. Nose is full of roastiness, and dark fruits like plums and raisins. There's a bit of tartness in the nose that I don't care for. Taste is layer upon layer of different kinds of chocolate, sweet chocolate, bakers choclate, and cocoa. This is offset by a bit of molasses and some tartness. The tartness seems a bit out of place. Mouthfeel is near perfect with light carbonation to welcome the liquid to the tongue.

Alcohol is hidden brilliantly by a wall of flavors, all of them complementing each other about as well as possible. It's moments like these you realize the brilliance of buying a four pack as opposed to hunting around for a single. It's going to be a pretty sweet night... What can you say? This is pretty amazing.

The smell is fairly robust and slightly sweet, with an aroma of malt, brown sugar and molasses. The smell of alcohol is also present.  The taste is very strong, rich and robust. It tastes like sweet coffee, with hints of unsweetened chocolate and malt. There is also a somewhat bitter finish. The aftertaste is both sweet and bitter at the same time.  The mouth feel is think heavy and syrupy.  This is a drinkable beer, but heavy, filling and a little long on ABV. Its good but I wouldnt want to have it very often, not more than one or two in a sitting, and I wouldnt want to drink them very fast. Certainly not an every day experience.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

The taste is of moderately sweet roasted (slightly burnt) malts supported by alcohol and some light herbal hops. More chocolate and more coffee than in the nose. The slightly astringent finish combined with the warming alcohol give your cheeks and tongue a bit of a tingle. It has a full body, slick texture and soft, low carbonation. As far as the style goes, this isnt a heavy-hitter. But again as far as the style goes, this is rather easy drinking. Nicely done.

Defineitely coffe and roasted chocolate flavors. There is a wonderfull fruity flavor behind it all... at first I thought maybe cherry but it is defineitely more of a berry flavor... maybe blackberrys, either way it tends to show more as it warms. A bit of hop spice shows through and there is a bit of hop bitterness. Still most of the bitterness comes from the roasted barley. This Russian Imperial Stout is medium to full bodied.

Appearance is good, but should have a larger head, especially considering this is a well carbonated brew. Scent is of chocolate, taste is of chocolate, but also some coffee flavor in there. There is a nice balance of hops and malt (malt being dominant here of course) that makes this brew very drinkable. I really can't get past the chocolate flavor here, this is almost a chocolate stout imo. Very good for the style, I was shocked at how quickly I finished this bottle.

The body is an opaque black, except for the faintest hints of brown highlight at the edges.  Sm: pure cocoa powder, Van Leer chocolate, rich and earthy Tamari soy.  Ta: a full malt start, smooth texture while those toasty malt flavors become a bit bitter at the end. Not amazingly complex, but not boring either. The malty and bitter flavors take a little getting used to before the balance of this stout can really be appreciated. The malt hides at first and the hops stick out, in the end it works well and is very enjoyable.  Mf: Heavy, smooth, well carbonated despite the appearance of being flat.  Da: The bitter, somewhat sticky finish takes away some degree of the drinkability for me.

There is some raisin and date flavor at the back of the tounge. Alcohol comes out as you make your way through the beer.  Mouthfeel: Near perfect.

Aromas carry that dark roasted smell paired with some dark chocolate and a good deal of alcohol. Texture isn't all to heavy and high carbonation brings down the mouthfeel and drinkability a bit. I enjoy these heavier beers with a bit less. Anyway, flavors are particularly drying and hoppy towards the end with the carbonation and alcohol both making quite a sting.

Strong espresso flavours especially, with the typical chocolate and dark fruits. A bit of caramel. However, the one thing I'd complain about with this particular brew (and why I don't like it as much as some others of the style) is how upfront the alcohol is in the flavour as it warms. Really decreases flavour and drinkability scores for me, unfortunately, although it's still a killer beer.  Excellent smooth mouthfeel though, and a pleasant bitter aftertaste with slight brown-sugary notes. Food note: Tastes great with some good pecan pie.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,orfeu,3.4,"Barely translucent dark brown with ruby-garnet highlights and a thick, frothy espresso crema head. Clean smelling aromas of chocolate and light roasted coffee; toasted grains and earthy piney hops. Dark coffee flavors predominate at first. Spicy pinecone hops mixed with an acidic vinous quality overtake during the middle. Bitter coffee finish, but hops ride it on through to the sour mineral aftertaste. Alcohol warms down the throat. Moderate body, a bit thin for the style, actually, and somewhat slick. Seems as if it could be dry, if the sour finish didn't get in the way. This acidity mellows somewhat at about mid-bottle. Much less interesting than I expected. Underwhelming, to say the least.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,etenbus,4.5,"Never Say Die is the motto of this stout. For the man who helped bring down the Romanov dynasty it's appropos. For this ale, let's hope it rings true.  The pour brings a hush, with the body of the beer acting as a cushion and sound absorber. It looks like Quaker State 10W/30W. I could not see any light through the glass. The head is dark caramel in colour and lasts halfway through the beer.  The aroma brings notes of bitter chocolate, hickory, and leather. There is a slight musty smell that is not unappetizing; it adds an earthy quality to the ale.  The flavour brings the malt up front. It is somewhat smoky and has an espresso dryness. The hops dry it out. It has a big punch of malt and hops paired well--neither dominates the other.  The mouthfeel is rounded, soft, and thick, like a stout should be.  It does not drink like a 9% ale, like some 9% Belgians I've tasted that leave me with a headache forming. I'm ready for another.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Appearance: Super black, no light coming through this beer. Frothy tan head lived briefly and left tons of tan lacing.  Smell: Mostly roasted malts and some chocolate. Slight coffee aroma.  Taste: Sweet maltiness of the roasted malts with some chocolate. Some hops present which helps calm down the sweetness.  Mouthfeel: Big body on this one, which is certainly expected after watching the pour.  Drinkability: Obviously not a session beer, but not a bad bar price tag and certainly not over the top in price at the beer store. I like this beer very much and recommend it to anyone who likes stouts.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,eph,4.58,"There is a fabulous bar out in western Massachusetts that caries this on tap. It was served in a goblet and was a thick black color with a dark brown head. It smelled of roasted coffee, almonds, chocolate, and a hint of alcohol. This beer has a good heavy mouth feel with a mellow carbonation that gives it an almost creamy feel when you swallow. It has a thick chocolate malt taste with a few shots of espresso to boot. After I swallowed I noticed a bit of a sweet dull fruit finish to it, not overly hoppy for sure. This beer was a great experience, I would recommend it as a sipping beer to fully enjoy... and the 9.0 abv has a way of sneaking up on you if you over drink this brew.

The beer pours a nice black color with a smallish head that disappears quickly. The aroma is of roasted malts, chocolate and alcohol. This is a mighty fine tasting brew with a huge malty flavor and a nice hint of hops too. I would say this is one of the best Imperial Stouts out there. It's very drinkable indeed.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Smell is a fabulous blend of nuts like hazels, cashews, almonds, etc. very well balanced with some slight fruit tints.  Taste is a malty chcocolate, licorice, toffee, caramel type thingy with some cherry hints on the back much like a good piece of dark chocolate would.  The mouthfeel is too sticky and syrupy. Drinkability is about avg or a little better than avg for this style.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Jaynuze,4.53,"A beautiful pour out of the bottle. The color, black as night, is topped off with a thick caramel/white head. Head retention is great till the end and a nice Belgian lace behind is left behind. Hints of charcoal, toffee, caramel, and chocolate emanate from this beauty and it coats the mouth with a wonderfully smooth malty sweetness that gives balance to the mouthfeel. I've found the beer to be less bitter from the bottle than it is when it's served on-tap which I found a bit odd, but I'm not complaining!! The finish is a bold coffee flavor at first but rounds out with a hint of creamy-sweetness.

The taste is rather fleet in the finish, leaving an alcoholic taste.  M: Big and heavy mouthfeel that finishes very dry. I'd like a beer of this body to be a bit less carbonated.  D: I'm a little disapointed with this after first having it on draft.

The flavor is rich, creamy, and semi-sweet with a bit of a dry finish. Very impressive actually.  Mouthfeel: Feels a little heavy and you can sense the creamy nature of this beer.  Drinkability: Very drinkable beer! Its sneaky though, you dont taste or even get a warming from the alcohol but it hit me pretty hard since I had not eaten in a great while.

112,412,geexploitation,4.7,"Old Rasputin pours black as coal with a rich dark tan head. Huge aroma of roasted malt, burnt chocolate and even a bit of toffee. It's an intimidating smell, and portends that the beer will be big tasting... as it turns out to be. ""Big"" doesn't say it, though: more like humongous. First it's bitterness from the malt (and, I assume, some hops), with tons of espresso. Then the palate shifts forward in the mouth for some coffee and even a bit of fruit (dried strawberries?). The finish is long and active, with an alcoholic burn and malt bitterness left over at the back of the mouth. With all this, you might think that this beer would be a bit rough on the palate, but that's not the case. It's no oatmeal stout, but given the massive flavors and roasted malt presence, this beer glides through the mouth rather well.  Overall: a huge, wonderful beer that will knock your socks off.

Body is deep black with barely a garnet hue only when it is held to direct light. looks clear.  Aroma: Smell is kind of like a baltic porter. Has a very vinous aroma but with a more pronounced roastiness than in a porter. Some alcohol, roasted coffee bean, dark malt, plum, and apple. A pleasant aroma.  Flavor: strongly roasted with a porter like background. has similar flavor characterisitcs of the baltic only it reverses the roles of the roastiness and the fruitiness, bringing the roastiness to the foreground. Not overly bitter or sweet, but a bit unbalanced it seems. Quite clean with a moderately bitter finish. Very clean and straightforward.  Mouthfeel: Full, but a bit too carbonated. It has a nice body, but the carbonation bite takes a little bit away from it. Still, it is nice and smooth, and better, I think, than the mouthfeel of Samuel Smith's.  Drinkability: Quite easy. This gives you a straightforward flavor with a decent body that you'd expect from a stout. The warmth from the alcohol is very nice.  Notes: I have yet to be impressed by an imperial stout. I have not tried the best ones, only Samuel Smith's and this one, but I much prefer barleywines. They balance out flavors and don't try to overload you on one. This is a nice after dinner beer, but I don't think I'll be buying it again any time soon.

Tons of malt -- all the roasted/burnt chocolate/caramel you could want, a reminder of the high ABV, and a slow, pleasant fade on the tongue, tinge of bitterness. No carbonation to speak of. Full flavored but not overwhelming. Then again, I sort of like being overwhelmed. Yum.  M- Rich, creamy, smooth. Seeks out all my tastebuds and shows them what it's got, which is formidable.

Chocolate, coffee, i detected some hazelnut but that could just be my imagination running wild with how much i love this beer. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy.

112,412,denali99755,4.75,"First off, the bottle was remarkably unimpressive for such a heavy-hitting beer. Coming from familiarity with Belgians and the bottle styles of the Rogue brewery, this beer's standard-issue brown bottle belies its singularly impressive quality. I do like the label, though, and especially the 'never say die' inscription.  Pours like stouts I'm used to, pretty smooth, with minimal head (although my pouring style is inconsistent at best, so it's hard to judge). And it's, well, dark like an Imperial should be.  Aroma is crisp and tart, with some definite hops and chocolate. Maybe some coffee? The nose might be a tiny bit more bitter than I would love.  But the taste--terrific. Nice and round, hugely full-bodied, with chocolate and coffee, but the hoppy bitterness (for me) balances the heavy bottom-end perfectly. This is my kind of beer. And it is remarkably light on its feet for a 9-percenter--dangerously so. I could drink a lot of this, and quickly. Love it.  Mouthfeel is smooth except for an odd almost grittiness that I experienced much more in the tap beer, but is still present from the bottle. Slightly odd--but the bottled version goes down smoother. Better, by my taste.  Like I said, I could drink way too much of this beer, way too quickly. The nice hoppy top end balances out a very big, meaty flavor. A definite 5.  This beer, from the bottle, might even surpass my other two favorite stouts--Alameda's Black Bear XX Nitro and Rogue's Shakespeare--although I have a hard time shaking my affection for Oregon breweries. All around, though, this is a terrific offering.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

S- Rich, deep, molasses-soaked licorice and chocolate... pure and liquid, and very intense. Very strong... the forecast calls for inebriation, if we are not careful.  T- A chocolately, richly deep, molasses-and-malt driven experience, which detours into a nicely balanced hoppy bitterness. Drying, flowery, and complete, we come full circle from the initial dessert-like debut.  M/D- Too smooth for the ultimate in roundness... the sheer strength of this beer calls for some balance in the mouthfeel, but it simply fades into obscurity.

Taste: Dark chocolate, strong burnt coffee (in a good way), bitter hoppiness on the back of the tongue. Great sweet/bitter interplay. Warming.  Smooth, creamy mouthfeel, so nice it almost steals the show from the strong flavor.

Everything about this is dark and rich. But what is so remarkable to me is that there is no element of unpleasant bitterness (I often detect something approaching bile in many stouts). As I sip it, there is some definite hops bitterness, but it complements the sweet, roasted malts so well. Wow. Very balanced and pleasant. Surely this is the standard of RIS.  Awesome. Not as thick as some Imperial Stouts, and perhaps for that reason, very drinkable (at 9%!).",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,AltBock,4.1,"12oz. stubby bottle with a picture of Rasputin doing what I believe is the sign of the cross. He was also doing this sign when they pulled him out of the river after he was poisoned, shot, and drowned. On the side of his picture is some russian, which I can not read. No date on the bottle what so ever.  Appearance: Poured a pitch black color with very few ruby highlights through it. You can find these ruby highlights only if you really look for them. I only got a little skim of tan colored foam, but did leave some traces of lace around my Snifter.  Smell: I was expecting this beer to be rich in roasted malt and roasted coffee beans, but to my surprise it was vey fruity. I believe the cherries were the most predominate in the fruit aroma. Behind these fruits was just a little bit of roasted malt. The one smell I thought was going to be the most predominate was just in the background.  Taste: The taste was unlike the smell, it had plenty of dark roasted malts, dark chocolate, roasted coffee beans, and this all ended with a dry fruity bitter alcohol aftertaste. Very good and very unusual.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel was alot like Rasputin, that strong roasted malt aftertaste did not die until I drank some water.  Drinkability: Overall an excellent beer, but since this at a strong 9% ABV this is definitely not an everyday beer and only good once in a great while. A 4-pack is more than enough for me.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,redwolf1,3.83,"Poured four 12-ounce bottles of Old Rasputin over the course of a week to give me some time to properly judge the contents. Dark black charcoal in color with a rich frothy light mocha head, which was thicker than I had anticipated. Moderate lacing around the glass. There was a subtle smokiness in the aroma after pouring; however, the smell of dark roasted malts and coffee abound afterwards. As for taste, a little bitter at first, which mellowed with time. A very good beer to sink your teeth into, real chewy. Didn't get that warm alcohol feeling while drinking this one like you do with some others, so I would say that the alcohol is pretty well hidden until you finish the bottle. For overall drinkability though, I would think some people would stop with one or two. At 9%ABV, it will hit you. Good thing, it comes only in 4-packs in my area.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,dweideman,3.77,"Poured a large frothy light-medium brown mostly lasting head. Aroma was extremely sweet  I detected dark cherry, ripened banana and a slight hint of citrus. Initially a light sweet taste with lively carbonation followed by moderate bitterness. The roasted malts really came through late in the finish with dark chocolate the predominant flavor. I really enjoyed the different aromas of this offering.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Enola,4,This beer poured out a thick dark black. It had creamy tan colored head. The smell is sweet and malty. Hints of the alcohol come through. The taste is roasted grain with a big alcohol finish. The alcohol is not as overpowering as others of the style. The mouthfeel is decent but due to the higher ABV it is somewhat diminished. I could drink these again. I would not want to slam these down but an occasional one would hit the spot.,North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

S: Lightly smoky, sweet chocolaty malt aromas  T: Starts out with toasty sensation and quickly turns dry with a unique chocolaty sweetness. This then evaporates into a mildly bitter finish. After a few more sips the bitterness catches up to me and is very moderate. The alcohol is clearly well hidden.  M: It has a good deal more carbonation than it appears. Very smooth, fairly thick, but not chewy, it's just rich.  D: Highly recommended, a perfect balance of flavors, nothing is overdone.

112,412,braubeater,4.33,"Appearance is very dark, opaque, with a subtle, fine-bubble head that remains thought the session. Very impressive lacing on the glass.  Aroma is subdued (hop-wise) with chocolate notes coming through assertively.  Initial taste is dry, with a slight alcoholic tinge followed by a parched feeling on the back of the tongue, but the malty residue and faint hop aroma provide a well-balanced finish.  This is probabably the most drinkable Imperial Stout I have ever encountered. This makes my top 10 list.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,baiser,4.26,"Pours motor oil black, with a thick, creamy brown head, wonderful lacing, great retention. Looks like a rich espresso. Roasted malt, alcoholic aromas. Taste is something else. Smooth, rich, creamy, espresso flavours, molasses and a heavy roasted and almost burnt flavour. Finishes dry, bitter and satisfying. Lots of complexity, flavour but still extremely easy to drink. Great body and mouthfeel. One of the best imp stouts I've had.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,scooter231,4.25,"Dark dark brown with tan head, very dark and mysterious. Smells deliiicious with chocolate filling my nostrils begging me to sip! And sip I do, and it is, in fact, also, delicious. Chocolately and caramely and espresso-y. A bitter finish completes the taste cycle. Mouthfeel is bubbly and fluffy, very clean and smooth. Very drinkable, though too sweet after a while. And did I mention how sneaky this is? At almost 9 percent, it's definitely sneaky.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Smell: Smell is dominated by chocolatey malts with alcohol scents in the background.  Taste: Roasty, toasty, burnt breads that lingers in the mouth with a sweet, fruity flavor mixed in.  Mouthfeel: Not as thick as I was expecting, or as carbonated, but it goes down smooth.  Drinkability: A pretty good stout, one that I would buy again but probably not on a regular basis. I could probably drink a few of these in a night.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,hrockefeller,4.23,"Bought bottle at Northside Indianapolis Kahn's as my introduction to the imperial stout style. I have had quite a few stouts, but this is my first review as I felt I should develop my tastes a little first.  Appearance: Opaque black, with a 1/2"" head on initial pour. Head dissipates rather quickly into a thin layer that clings slightly to the glass.  Smell: Complex smell that is heavy with alcohol ( I realize this states the obvious a bit when the brew is 9% ABV). Other dominant scents include chocolate and coffee. Hints of fruity smells including raisins. Very toasty/bready.  Taste: Wow! The presence of alcohol does not seem to be as dominant with the taste as it was with the smell, allowing the other flavors to make their presence known. The toastiness and chocolate really come out at this point with a nice balance of hop flavor that allows for a somewhat dry finish.  Mouthfeel: Thick, creamy, leaves my taste buds craving more.  Drinkability: If it wasn't for the high alcohol content, I think I could easily make this a session beer. Leaves a clean, dry feeling that prepares you for the next drink.  This has instantly become one of my favorite beers. I was a little unsure, as I am somewhat partial to milk/sweet stouts. However, if this example is any indication of what to expect, imperial stouts may just take their rightful place on the throne.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,Tupperwolf,5,"Pours from a 12oz bottle into my nonic glass with a HUGE HEAD. Be super careful on the pour because this thing just wants to rise right out of the glass. Piercing black-hole darkness reveals just a tinge of ruby when held up to the light; It actually looks somewhat clear, just incredibly black. So much whipped-cream dark tan head. Thin but super persistent lacing rings mark each and every swallow. OMG. A five if there ever was one.  Huge! huge bursting sweet chocolatey coffee malts, so much sexy, sexy stout flavor. If I try hard I might be able to pick out some hops... But it might be my imagination. This beer completely scorches my sense of smell. I have to give it a good minute of rest before going in for another whiff, which immediately burns up my scent receptors with coffee, and chocolate, and more coffee, and more chocolate. A little bit of metallic twinge.  Okay, you're kidding me, right? I think North Coast has bottled a mocha chocolate milkshake and called it beer. The taste is so intense, so strong and bittersweet with coffee and chocolate, toffee, roasted nuts. It tempts me to guzzle, and I give in for a few swallows. Wow, wow, wow. Awesome slow and savory or quick and greedy.  Mouthfeel... Like I said... milkshake. Thick, lustrous, creamy, silky. Not chewy, but full, full, swirling, frothy, creamy. Swallowing almost completely clears the palate, which is welcome - there's a lingering, almost (if I may be crude) phlegmlike sensation of sweet, delicious flavors that hangs out on the very back of the tongue and coats the throat. Soooo good. Where the heck is the alcohol? I guess it must be in my belly!  Buy, beg, panhandle, or steal for this beer. Buy out the whole shelves. I want to give it fives across the board. Do I dare? Do I dare? I dare! Utterly one of the best beers I have ever, ever had in my life. A life-changing experience!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,heyitsbyron,4.11,"Received a bottle from a friend in exchange for some of my brother's homebrew. Poured into a pint glass.  I don't expect much in the way of head from high gravity stouts, but this did very well. Perhaps not as viscous as other imperial stouts, but it left about 1cm of head and the head color was a pretty tan. Beer color was a deep dark brown. The head was velvety smooth.  I didn't smell a whole lot, very little aroma. What I did smell was similar to a macro beer, maybe a bit of coffee and purple fruitiness. It's too bad. These smells are wonderful, but just not strong enough, especially considering the over the top flavors.  Taste is quite good. I think it's complex and strong, even for an imperial stout. Coffee flavors overwhelm, so do roast malts, but there is certainly a bit of dark condensed fruit. I was suprised by the latter because I haven't had many beers that taste this way, but the more I taste, the more apparent these flavors become. A few seconds after I take a sip, I get a bit of an alcohol bite. No real complaints here, and I like a good strong beer.  I like the mouthfeel, though it's not a slippery smooth as other imperial stouts I've had. Real solid body, perhaps just a touch over carbonated-- a bit unpleasant on my throat. Again, no big complaints.  I'd love to have a six pack of this beer, but it's not something I'd sit and pound consecutively. It's heavy, of course, and doesn't slide down like some other imperial stouts. A bomber would be nice, but I'm afraid I couldn't drink a less strong beer in that same evening. A great beer; it would be a joy to purchase it again.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Also hints of coffee, fruits and slight alcohol.  Taste: The most noticeable part of the flavor is the roasted malt. There are also hints of chocolate and a coffee like bitterness and a slight sweetness. There is also an alcohol warming that is present but not overwhelming.  Mouthfeel: Thick Mouthfeel with hardly any carbonation.  Drinkability: This is definitely a sipping beer and because of this I could only have 1 or 2 in a sitting.  This is my first beer from North Coast Brewing Company and I look forward to trying their other offerings.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,IgnorantBastard,4.25,"This is the first RIS that I have the pleasure to taste. And I liked it alot. The best aspect is the chocolate mid palate.

112,412,FLAbeergutinMASS,4.1,"A wonderful stout. Nicely balanced, one thing I really like (or dislike) about stouts is the roastedness of the beers body. This one was not too roasted, but it had enough bitterness to warm me up on a single digit western New England evening. Highly drinkable at %9  Purchased as a 4-pack for $8.00, a good deal.

Pours an engine oil black in color, totally opaque in my pint glass with a brown head that fizzled down into a thin swirl atop the pint. Lots of sticky lacing. Nose is very, very, nice, nutty and fruity with lots of coffee and cocoa character, complex and multi-layered. Taste is very good as well, initially reminds me of chocolate covered raisins, but quickly overtook by a milk chocolate tone and a strong roasted coffee flavor. Mouthfeel is heavy, very full bodied and complex. Drinkability is quite high as it warms and the bittnerness recedes, at cooler temps there is a definate unbalance, but at proper temps it's marvelous. Overall a bit too overdone with the hop presence, in my humble opinion it's just not necessary or warranted.  Slàinte!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

First sip reveals a fairly thick body and super mild carbonation. The flavor is deep and robust with dark bittersweet chocolate and some roasted malt.

The lacing will coat the glass. Dark fruits in the nose like raisins and dates. Strong bakers chocolate aroma and some fusel vapors as it warms to room temp. A hint of coffee to top off the complex aroma; but not much in the way of hops or roasted notes. The roasted barley becomes very evident in the initial taste, with a slight black patent twang. Unsweetened chocolate and faint spicy hop aftertaste mellow out the strong sweet flavor. Dark fruity alcohol is apperent in the finish, but there is enough residual sweet to hide the fusels and retain a silky mouthfeel.

Quite lovely. Aroma is beautiful. I don't usually find aromas that wonderful, but this is quite remarkable. Roasted malts, chocolate, coffee, licorice and alocohol, perhaps a trace of brown sugar. Taste is just as great, with a complex mixture of the same hints from aroma, a potent blast of roasted malts and espresso-like aftertaste, finishes moderately thick, smooth and creamy.

Pours almost pitch black (when held to intense light goes mahogany to purple) with a whipped up tan bubbly head, Great head retention and insane lacing, a feast for the the dark beer lover's eyes.  Smell: Coffee, chocolate and licorice notes, with alcohol and roasted malts lurking in the background.  Taste: Some fruitiness, then bam! Burnt coffee taste, chocolate, molasses, hops/grainy bitterness &alcohol.  MF: Chunky, silky and just hits the marks.

Smell: A rich nutty aroma emerges right away. Dark chocolate bursts through as well. Hops are difficult to distinguish in the midst of this full maltiness.  Taste: Here dark chocolate predominates. The tongue also recognizes some mocha, while confirming the nuttiness that introduced itself in the smell. The dark chocolate provides a pleasant bitterness, which the hops tend to intensify. Nicely balanced overall.  Mouthfeel: Nice and chewy. A fine body, probably medium for a stout. Not the heaviest I've had. The carbonation is rather subdued.

Rich aroma of roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, a touch of bitter hops, and a bit of a vinous character. Palate is deeply complex and somewhat earthy. Truly, it tastes as black as it looks: a huge malty backbone is met towards the finish with a good complement of bittering hops for a touch of balance. Notes of milk chocolate, oak, espresso, and a touch of molasses. Body is rich, velvety, and creamy, with very little of the oiliness that seems to permeate many Russian stouts. The alcohol packs a punch, for sure, but this is most certainly a beer to be savored (preferably with a Five Star chocolate-hazelnut bar). Once you start, you're in for the long haul.

112,412,goochpunch,4.22,"Pours out a rich black with ruby hues with a thin tan head that slowly dissipated to a thin layer of bubbles. Aromas are of roasted malt, dark chocolate, coffee, toasty malts, slight smoke, and marashino cherries. Taste is of sweet, dark chocolate chased with some strong, black coffee. There is some toasted malt in there as well as cherry candy and dried fruits. Finishes a bit smoky with pleasent astringent bitterness and a bit of a lactic acid twang. I detect a bit of citrus and pine in the hops very faintly, although these hops come out more in the burps. This beer really needs to sit a while before the mouthfeel is anywhere near decent. When its freshly poured and a bit too cool, it's thin and prickly, but just letting it sit a while and come closer to room temp., it becomes a bit fuller and mellows out a bit. Still, it could be better. Really drinkable RIS that has tons of flavor and a decent mouthfeel, once it warms up.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Dithyramb,4.41,"The evil monk was sampled on tap in a proleterian pint glass in Frisco's in Columbia. Poured an opaque black, like the heart of the wicked one. Like the Neva River itself, it was impassable to the light of day. A thick, lucious dark tan head and excellent retention/lacing stealthily masked the high ABV.  Aroma was mostly of bitter roasted malts, with just a bit of sweetness in the background. Interesting, it was just as complex served slightly chilled on tap as it was cellar temperature at home. Cream and sugar laden roasted coffee was followed by bitter chocolates. Toffee in the middle was literally beat down with some ashy coffee grounds onthe finish. Hefty, strong, memorable.  Bitter and acidic at times, it still finished like a nicely done cream and sugar coffee. Smoother than one would expect, and very drinkable.  Overall: Razzy was drugged, poisoned, beaten and shot, but only died after being wrapped in a carpet and thrown in the river. He grew from a womanizing peasant thief to a holy man helping the czars family with both the needs of a hemophilic son and the decisions for war with Austria.

Anyways, enough on the bottle, lets talk beer. Pours jet black with a one inch toffee head. If you listen closely you can hear the carbonation rising to the frothy head. As it sits for a moment for all to gaze upon the head slowly disappears. Some lacing holds to the sides.  Smell: Espresso beans, certainly. Mild dark chocolate backbone lofts around your nostrils. A toffe'ish smell is noticable.  Taste: Slight notes of caramel, which surprised me, but stuck to the tongue, I am a fan of this. But where is the chocolate that I smell? Lets let her warm up... Ah yes, there it is, slight hints of dark unsweetened chocolate, but not overwhelming at all. Buttery, somewhat oiled hops are quickly joined and overtaken by a beautiful roasted barley purity.  Mouthfeel: The carbonation that was oh so prevelant with that first sip fades away as the beer warms up, which is strongly suggested. This allows it to slicken out. Lovely as it goes down and lingers on for quite some times.  Drinkability: No more drinkable, no less drinkable than any other stout I've had in the past.

I like them meatier and full of roasted flavors. This is an interesting taste. As far as matching what I expect it is not. It is sweeter...almost milky. Very tasty, but lacks a lot of the rich roasted complexities I enjoy. It tastes like hops might overshadow the malts too much. It is a very full bodied beer. Almost a cake like texture to it. Alcohol just lightly warms the stomach and mouth. Excellent mouthfeel. This is a very drinkable beer.

The taste is a bold malt with a bit of bitter roastieness then has an alcohol burn for a finish. Not quite as sweet as I like my RIS, but a nice change of pace. The feel is appropriately heavy and quite smooth, even creamy. I will definately be back for more. I had a serious thirst for a RIS this summer and the store I went to only had this in stock. I have now enjoyed the first 3 from the 4pack and I think I'll set the other one down for a while. I'd like to see if the cherry aroma will show in the taste as it ages.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,blitz134,4.2,"Pitch black body...only the hints of Coke brown around the edges. Small light tan head on the pour, reduced to pockets of bubbles after a few minutes.  Sweet wine like aroma of dark grapes. Overtones of chocolate and some hints of toasted malts. Hints of alcohol come through and blend well with the aroma. Simple aroma but pleasing. Taste is loaded with toasted flavors. Big hits of chocolate and toffee with coffee coming through as well, quite the contrast to the aroma. Alcohol contributes a bit of a biting burn at the end, but doesn't really detract. Definately a sipper.  Mouthfeel is a little thinner than most stouts, but I find this to be typical of Russian Imperials. Drinkability is good. The alcohol feeling on the stomach limits this.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

D: Maybe even a little below average.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Bumpon10s,4.15,"After well over a month of not reviewing to make my taste and views more finite, I thought this was a good beer to start up once again.  A - Pours black with the slightest ring on the outside of the glass and a slightly thin consistency. It appears to be solid, the surface is so blemish free.  S - Lots of coffee and chocolate. I noticed deep fruit upon decanting, but no longer once poured.  T - I've had this on tap, and the bottle isn't any less. Once more, lots of coffee and chocolate. It could be what I had to eat prior to this, but it is finishing a bit sour, the score won't reflect this, but simply making note.  M - Much thicker in the mouth than it looked during the pour. I am a bit more impressed now. Very slippery upon enrty with a tingle going down, well done.  D - The drinkability of this beer increases with each sip. It gets smoother and better as it goes. I hate having the same beer one after another, but I could sure see it happening with this.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,EStreet20,4.38,Finally saw this around here at random. I was picking up beer for a concert tailgate and I wasn't even at the good liquor store in my area and saw a lone four pack in the top shelf of a cooler so I had to snag it.  12 Ounce bottle poured into a Brooklyn snifter.  A - A dark oily black with a tight one finger head. Some tiny bublles rush up the side. Lacing sheets the walls of the glass like crazy.  S - Big roasted malt aroma with a candy smell that I can't identify. It's wierd but it seems like all of the malt smells are backed by roasted marshmellow aromas. Very unisue.  T - Wow definitely not what I especet but a very nice flavor nonetheless. A very roasted beginning that makes way to pure espresso flavoring. After that a bit of the sweetness with a tiny alchohol kick comes in. At the end a hop bitterness with a roasted charcet lingers. Definitely an interesting effects since there isn't much of a hop character in the taste. Still that sweetness that really reminds me of roasting marshmellows lead the way and hangs on throughout.  M A great smooth feeling on the tongue.  D - A great one to sip and savor. The sweetness makes you want to sip this one really slowly and relax.,North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,IntriqKen,4.6,"Pours a deep opaque black. Nice small bubbled head clears to a fine lace that lasts forever. Scents of chocolate, carmel, vanilla and perhaps figs &lt;?&gt;. Very little carbonation in the mouth, creamy and smooth feel. Tastes of chocolate, espresso, and alcohol. Mega alcohol warmth burs a long time afterwards deep in the chest. Aftertaste of mlt and bitter chocolate. Very nice stout. One is enough....two would have an old man naked on the table singing rap. Not a pretty sight. Edit: I was drinking another Rasputin tonight and wanted to re-review. Actually, my review would still be 4.5 across the board. This is an excellent beer....not the best...I still like Stone more...but an excellent, EXCELLENT beer available every day of the week, at a reasonable price..

112,412,BillyB,4.28,"Excellent Imperial Stout! Dark brown to almost black color with a thick frothy tan head. Opaque. Smells of chocolate, caramel, vanilla and very strong alcohol scent. Again a very strong alcohol taste just like in the aroma but it doesn't take too much away from the overall. I expect alcohol in an imperial stout anyway. Kind of a coffe-ish cappuccino flavor with hints of vanilla. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth going down. Not much carbonation and a slight alcohol warmth. Drinkability is good but is a little hindered by the strong alcohol taste and smell.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Phatz,4.8,"I don't believe in a perfect 5 but I had a real hard time not giving this beer a perfect score. Serve in a pint glass at just below room temp.  Appearance: When you crack open the bottle and pour into your pint glass it initially looks black, until you hold it up to the light you'll notice it is very dark brown and completely opaque (no light gets through this one). Fantastic 3-4 figure head, super frothy. The head is a light brown very tasty foam that lingers for a while and as it fades away, leaves behind thick evidence, that it was there, clinging to the slides of the glass.  Smell: Amazing, enticing smell. Dark roast, mocha coffee. Truly, it made my mouth water at the very sent of it. A complex -- sweet, toasty malty aroma that just echoes in your nose. WOW! Upon further contemplation, there is a slight hint of vanilla and caramel, then its back to the chocolate coffee.  Taste: The taste is just as magnificent as the smell would suggest. It is complex and interesting. As stouts go this is not TOO sweet but just sweet enough. When I think about the taste I come up with: black and toasted yet sweet vanilla chocolate coffee. Whatever all that means. I think this is one of my absolute favorite flavors. Then, to make matters even more heightened; I broke out some dark chocolate Christmas morsels, and snaked on them as I finished my beer. The way they complimented each other was out of this world; divine, or some shit like that. Incredible!  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel was near perfect. I like stouts, but most stouts (at least the ones I like) are very heavy, thick, syrupy and sticky in the mouth. Some ice cream or pie helps wash them down. Not for 'Old Rasputin'. This beer is medium bodied, but light for a stout that tastes this dark. It makes this dangerously easy to drink.  Drinkability: While I love most everything about stouts, they are usually not the highest scoring on the drinkability because they are so sweet and so heavy. They taste great but then your full. This beer may be heavier than many, yet as stouts go, (in my experience) this may be the most drinkable, easy down the hatch beer (that is a RIS) Ive found yet!  Hope this is helpful. Cheers!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,NClifestyle,4.25,"This is a good one! On tap at Brixx tonight. After a pint or two, I had to switch to something creamy. This was it. Dark, but not quite black, medium tan head, tight bubbles. Smells of dark chocolate and alcohol. Taste was coffee, but somewhat harsh, a hit of alcohol, some creamy sweetness, and an earthy, not exactly hoppy flavor that i'm not exactly sure about. In any case, this tasted great. Mouthfeel is medium, creamy, smooth, with some alcohol warmth and tingles everywhere. A great beer, definitely go back, but can't have too many in a row.

The tan head that is creamy and smooth so fades into a wisp around the rim.  S- Smells of dark roasted and toasted malts are combined with some notes of raisins, coffee and a faint hint of tar. The finish has a nice green spicy quality perhaps from hops.  T- This beer has a slight sour note in the beginning with deep roasted malt and to toasted malt flavors aswell. The hint of coffee and some caramel notes are also the taste. The finish has a dark malt bitterness combined with some hop bitterness.  M- The mouthfeel is medium-full with some creamy texture to it.

112,412,deBeers,4.33,"This is currently on tap at My Place in Newtown, CT. Thanks Mark.  The tap is very intriquing. It shows an old Russian gentleman (presumably Rasputin) in black & white with his right hand raised to the crown of his head which I gather is some type of religious symbol. The top of the tap is like the top of a tower. Wish I could explain this more intricately.  Smells and tastes a lovely coffee aroma/malt. Creamy cappuchino looking head. This one is too smooth when the keg is very fresh. Puts the drinkability through the roof for how heavy the brew is.  Pitch black with rose hues at the edges of the glass when held in the light. The bitterness in this beer is balanced so right. It's like a siren calling to you in the night.  Seek this one out on tap. My apologies for the haphazardly written review.

Ballaced out with lots of sweet base malt. Great fruit flavor and fermentation. Dried cherries, smokey esters. Hop bitterness is pretty high, no hop flavor, in style. Some hot alcohol.

It tasted somewhat hoppy, with hints of sweet furits, roasted malt, coffee, bitter chocolate. The taste was somewhat more pleasant than other Imperial Stouts I've had, but I can't exactly place what was different; I'm going to say it as the balance of the flavors.

You can have your IPAs, your best bitters and all the rest of 'em, because for my money you just can't beat a quality Imperial Stout like this one.

112,412,SkeeterHawk,4.42,"Appearance: Pours a rich deep black color that doesnt look like it is capable of passing any light through it. There was a half inch tan head of small bubbles that sat around for about a minute. Finally there was a small thin ring left on top of the beer  Aroma: Nutty toasty roasty and just about any other adjetives that I can think of that end in Y. There is a noticeable plum and other ripe fruit presence along with some floral presence that I would guess is from hops. As the beer warms a bit, you can notice the hops a lot more  Taste: This is a very revolving flavor. It starts out with a mild sweet flavor, and soon there is a sharp roasty presence that sets in. Just as soon as you think that the roasty flavor is going to be around for a while, there is an assertive nutty and toasty flavor that oozes down your throat for the finish. There is a mild alcoholic burn that sets in somewhere around the syrupy finish to linger around for quite some time.  Opinion: This is a really nice beer. It is a bit milder than some of the American micro-brews version. It has a lot nuttier flavor and a whole lot more depth of malt character than most. The flavor is multilayered, so if you pay attention, you can taste at least three different beers in just this one.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

I can barely see some color highlights of dark brown and possibly dark, dark red by holding it up to the light. 2 fingers of thick and foamy tan head. Leaves very thick and sticky lacing.  Nose is rich and dark with roasted malt. Heavy on the coffee and smoky as well.  Flavor is intense! The deep rich RIS profile, coffee, chocolate, caramel/toffee, but also very smoky. Very bitter aftertaste from a bold dash of hops, but also carries a hint of sweet black cherry. Complex and nuanced, I will probably get different flavors on subsequent tastings.  Mouthfeel is chewy and viscous. It's not nearly the motor oil consistency of Stone RIS, but very nice nonetheless and a fine example of the style.  Drinkability is good.

Retention is decent, as is lacing. Smell is somewhat subdued, but is a nice mix of baking chocolate, ameretto, and coffee. Taste is excellent, a very nice roasted expresso, rich bittersweet chocolate, a roasted malt base, and a finish with a slight taste of alcohol. Very rich and luscious.

112,412,soulgrowl,4.65,"Appearance: Intensely dark burgundy-brown; almost black. Opaque even when held up to the light, with a fiery brick-red glow along the edges. The head is frothy and resilient, its color a dark, coffee-stained, cinnamon-infused beige, very reminiscent of a double capuccino. Overall, the beer would match nicely with a ski lodge.  Smell: Aroma is surprisingly subtle and subdued compared to the beer's visual impact. It is earthy and natural, with campfire-like burnt tones. The bitter combination of chocolate and coffee and sweet overtones of maple trees foreshadow the beer's complicated taste.  Taste: Wonderful! Chocolate and espresso provide the beer's foundation, covered with an intense, burnt-to-perfection malt flavor. Then there is a layer of stewed fruit-and-vegetable sweetness (especially cherries). An undercurrent of almond (specifically amaretto and marzipan) pops up now and then. Lingering finish retains roasty and nutty elements in your mouth for a long time. Amazing! This would go so well with dark wheat toast spread with Nutella, or with any dark chocolate. Might also be good with some kind of flaky pastry, like a Danish, turnover, or kringle.  Mouthfeel: Although the beer is very viscous, it is not as creamy as I expected due to its medium-sized bubbles. Probably for the best, since the lightness helps keep the beer from being too overwhelming. After you swallow and lick your lips, the beer still clings to you.  Drinkability: The high alcohol content and richness of this beer make it something that demands to be drank slowly and deliberately, but the flavor is so enchanting that it wouldn't be hard to knock back more than a few of these between dinner and bedtime.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

The roasted coffee and dark chocolate shine through as there is a touch of milk chocolate. The mouthfeel is thick and full.

The head's bubbles are precise and poppable, rather than creamy. There is a nice lingering aftertaste, but the flavors don't over stay their welcome. Despite its alcohol content and robust character, Old Rasputin doesn't fatigue the taste buds.

It is a thick deep black with an ever so slight hint of ruby around the edges with a nice brown head that laces really nicely.  The smell is delicious. Very strong and roasty, a bit chocolately, and really toffee like. The taste follows up strongly. It's thick and syrupy in the mouth with a very strong roasted flavor. A bit of coffee and a mild chocolate flavor comes through along with a bit of a burnt fruit flavor. The only fault I can find in the taste is that the finish has a bit too much bitterness for my taste. After a few sips the alcohol warmth hit my stomach strongly. This goes well with a chilly winter day.  There is a downside to this. The flavor is perhaps a bit too strong, and it is hard to drink this at anything faster than a snails pace. More than one (*maybe* two) of these is a bit too much for my palate to handle.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,germaniac,4.45,"Old Rasputin, my little friend in the stubby 12oz. bottle. Deep and dark, a black that matches the nefarious deeds performed by the Mad Monk. Except the bottled version sports a halo, one made of pale brown foam.  Smells of chocolate malts, with a nice vanilla-bean twang and earthy hoppiness.  Taste just screams decadence. Rich and creamy chocolate, like a liquid Hershey's Kiss coating the back of my mouth, with a distinct roasted malt taste. Overshadowing everything is a surprising hoppiness, reminding me that this is Northern California's take on a classic style.  This is one of my anytime beers. Always available, always enjoyable. For just under seven bucks, a four pack can spend a few days in my fridge. The 12oz size is nice, too. I don't think I've ever seen another RIS in this size, for this price.

Old Rasputin - does anybody remember the movie HBO did about the now dead Russian legend starring the bad guy from the original Die Hard movie? - poured with a finger of thick, off white head that retained mediocrely well and left some lacing down the side of the glass. The beer is the thick blackness of the empty theatres I had left behind at work: hiding and betraying no secrets, forever comlex. The aroma was thick was and heavy on roasted malts with a little alcohol peaking through. I took a sip, a big sip to be honest, of the syrupy, full bodied brew and allowed it to wash over my tongue. The flavor seemed to attack and hold my senses at bay: strong coffee flavors, with well roasted malts, and a alcohol finish. Old Rasputin and I sat around the family room and finished the evening in style. After finishing the beer, fully enjoyed, I wanted nothing less than another of the same exact beer and scolded myself for not purchasing more than a single bottle of this brew.

Very roasty aroma with some vanilla and a good hop presence. Raw and untamed. Some licorice as well...  Big roastiness combines with a huge leafy-bitter hop character for the main part of the flavor. Starts off like this and becomes more pronounced in the middle, leaving with a hop bang in the finish. It's most definitely woody too. A bit of vanilla creeps through the cracks of the rough roastiness and hoppiness. Hops stay big and leafy in the aftertaste. Again, quite raw.  Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, but jagged-edged from the hopping. Big and bold body.  This is the old standby Russian Imperial, $8.49 for a 4-pack, which is not bad for the style. Fresh it's a raw roast and hop monster, but aged I imagine the vanilla and other subtleties would come through more and create a smooth sea of complexities. Either way, excellent.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,DarkerTheBetter,4.25,"I gave this a straight poor from a 12 0z bottle into a pint glass and the head came above the brim. Didnt expect that. The color isnt exactly black, but a beautiful dark brown. Leaves slight Belgian lace.  The nose is deceptive. There are obvious roasted malt notes, but there are some fruits there as well. Perhaps some black licorice. The bottle says 9% abv, but theres no alcohol yet.  Big roasted flavor. Too delicate to be called coffee. Theres a sweetness that prevents the coffee from dominating the flavor. Theres also a slight bit of sour to it near the finish. The finish leaves the roasted malt with you and the 9% abv finally lets itself be noticed effervescing into the nose.  Big texture in this beer. Its very thick, but the bubbles are a little small for my liking. Very creamy feel.  This is an awesome beer. It has a very distinct taste thats good for sipping. However, the lasting roasted finish keeps me from wanting to immediately crack open another one.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Now that I can buy this beer in NC, the anticipation of cracking this one open is exhilerating. The beer pours black, nearly opaque, with a 1 inch light brown head. I can detect a whiff of coffee, dark malt and hops. The initial taste is of chocolate,coffee, plums, dark fruit and hops. As the beer warms, the alcohol taste comes out more, but does not take anything away from the drinkability of this beer. I could easily drink several of these in one night.

Starts of full of roastiness, espresso and bitter chocolate, some slight fruit midway, then the hops emerge through the finish coupled with a slight alcoholic spicyness. It doesn't suffer from being too sweet like some impy's i've had do. It's very nice. Perhaps that's why the body is a bit thinner than expected, but that's a tradeoff I can make.

112,412,Dubblebock,2.84,"Old Rasputin was certainly a beer that I have been looking forward to trying for quite some time now. I have seen it quite often but never had the chance to pick up a bottle to sample until recently. I have to say, this was definitely a case of expectations exceeding reality. The bottle looks good, the drawn face of Rasputin himself cocking a wary eye towards the drinker.  The pour was excellent as well. The beer was nothing but inky blackness, with a chocolate head of foam. I began to get the idea that something was amiss, however, when the nose came at me with alcohol stringency and bitterness.  The taste was less than impressive to me. There were notes of dark chocolate and burnt coffee, but all of the complexity in this beer was totally masked by the alcohol. Granted, it's a bruiser of a beer at 9% ABV, but there was clearly no attempt to hide the potency behind the flavor. The beer just got bitter and uninviting as I made my way through the mug. I did get a few notes of hops and dry grains, but all was lost in the end.  Mouthfeel was ok, the aftertaste bitter. Not drinkable at all, IMO. I won't be reaching for Rasputin's face any time soon. Disappointing, as this is always considered a classic beer by most. It's definitelty too over the top for my tastes.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

The flavor is fantastic, and I could really taste the darker malts -- but without the overwhelming bitterness and over-the-top burnt coffee profile that haunts other Russian Imperials.  There is some sweetness to found here, as well as some bittersweet chocolate and roasty/toasty elements. This full, rich beer is complemented by a very good mouthfeel. The nearly 9% ABV is expertly concealed by serious depth of flavor. Old Rasputin is a great brew at a great price. I will pay this one a visit again soon.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,amicar,4.42,"Pours a nice toffee brown/ black with a bit of seriously brown head. The smell is a bit of a surprise- almost floral in addition to the usual caramel/ roast/ soy stuff. The taste is heavy on the acrid/ roasty/ burnt side with a hint of chocolate and italian roast coffee- flirts with being too much, but never really goes too far. Mouthfeel really stands out in this one- less body than some other impy stouts that lean towards the thick syrupy side- but that's perfect in this beer; nice to have one that doesn't feel immensley sticky. Alcohol's nicely balanced, too.

Taste is strong flavors of roasted coffee, smokey roasted malts and some powerful hops busting through.

Aromas similar to whisky were first noted, as were indications of chocolate and coffee. Flavor was full and rich, with notes of molassas, cocoa and coffee, with some smokey elements to it as well. The big drawback for me with this beer was the alcohol. Way too present, as it almost overpowered the other flavors. Very hard to ignore. Full and thick mouthfeel was similar to what I would imagine having motor oil in your mouth being like. I guess i'd have another, but certainly not right after having one.

112,412,jaluria,4.42,"Summary: A very tasty and enjoyable beer with relative complexity and smoothness  Appearance - It poured a very dark brown, almost black in color and seemed somewhat viscous. It had a very nice medium-brown colored head that stayed intact for more than a minute. Smell - Hint of nutmeg, but first impression was of chocholate and Ethiopian coffee. Very pleasing because it was subtle & slightly unexpected. Taste - Smooth and full-bodied, and yet crisp with a dry semi-sweet chocholate taste. Mouthfeel - Lingering dryness that just doesn't seem to go away. My mouth felt like I was continuously tasting the beer. Drinkability - Very good; can easily have a few of these. I'm not sure what it can be paired with because of it's accented texture, but I think a fruit-based dessert would be good.  Additional comments - I think this beer is well-balanced because no one ingredient is over-powering, but that also causes it to not be distinct and memorable.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

The Mad Monk is a deep and evil black that's basically headless--something the Romanovs probably should have considered. It smells like roasted malts, caramel, and chocolate. Taste is deliciously bitter, like coffee grounds, with some chocolate and toastedness. The kind of big beer I like, lacking in the grossly sweet prune/raisin character that I dislike.

The taste is of roasted nuts, oak, chocolate mocha and the bitterness of hops with whipped cream. The mouthfeel is light and smooth but warms up at the end because of the alcohol.

Other reviews have listed raisins in the taste, and for the initial hit, this is pretty spot on. However it gives way to a very smokey, burnt-coffee-grinds taste that fans of Imperial Stouts will like. However, know what you're getting into when you drink this beer...my first try of it a year ago resulted in instant revulsion (""Tastes like a barbecue grill"" I think my words were). It's just now that I'm getting around to the masochistic appeal this beer has. I still have a hard time getting around just how much this beer tastes like it's been burned in the aftertaste. I like to think it gives me an excuse to keep drinking more (no aftertaste if you don't stop drinking). Also, be warned, this beer is a heavy hitter.

112,412,macpapi,4.29,"Old Rasuptin Imperial Stout is quite an interesting brew. It pours a chocolaty black color with a thin, purplish-tan head. It is deep, dark and mysterious--perhaps much like the ellusive Rasputin himself. I love the smell of this beer. It mixes roasted coffee aromas, with the sweeter remnants of chocolate, caramel and toffee. Sweetness epitomized! There is also a nice, bold noticeable tinge of hops to the overall inhalation. It tastes like carmalized coffee with malt and a slight hops kick at the end of each swallow. Alcohol is noticeable, but barely. In the mouth, this beer is amazingly bold and full. It holds well, with low carbonation. There is also a nice biting aftertaste, allowing its overall substance to be reckoned with. On the whole this well documented Russian Imperial Stout does not disappoint. Not normally my favorite style, but this one is a keeper. It is a candied/coffied delight for the palate.

112,412,danielharper,4.15,"Purchased from Woody's Smokes and Brews, Franklin, TN.  My first Imperial Russian Stout, and I only wish I'd bought a whole four-pack of these instead of sticking to the single.  Pours dark, dark, black with a thick brown head. The head was very foamy and dissipated only after letting the beer set for a few minutes. I also love the bottle on this one, the picture of Rasputin and the Russian writing around the bottle are pretty nifty, thus giving it a highly impressive presentation.  The aroma is very much as I expected from a stout, with a heavy coffee nose combined with subdued alcoholic notes. The alcohol was present, but worked well with the overall aroma -- I enjoyed it quite a bit.  Taste is really nice, very much like the smell, strong coffee and ""stoutish"" notes combined with some bitterness. As the beer warms, though, the alcohol becomes more pronounced and gives the beer an overall astringent quality, the only thing keeping this beer from getting a higher score on taste.  Mouthfeel is really fantastic, thick and full-bodied, like a velvety texture that slides around the mouth and into the throat. Quite enjoyable, and the fairly mild carbonation helps to keep this beer interesting and pleasant, but not overwhelming on the mouthfeel department.  Overall drinkability is low only because of the aforementioned astringent quality to the taste as the beer warms, and the high alcohol. I drank this one over the course of about an hour and a half, and while I enjoyed it quite a bit, I don't think I could have easily drunk two.

Aroma is sweet roasted malts lots of chocolate some light coffee underneath the sweetness. Under lying citrus hops coming thru the roasted malt also some of the usual fruitiness in RIS's.  Taste is roasted malt lots good chocolate flavors coming thru fairly smooth but touches of gritiness. Coffee flavors come out after the sweet chocolate peaks and mingle with the fairly large amount of hops citrus grapefruit and pine resin mixed for the finish, some light alcohol apears in the finish also.

112,412,BEERchitect,4.45,"This is THE staple of Russian Imperial Stouts that paved the way for unreal American stout brewers of this depth, boldness, and aggression.  The beer pours with a deep onyx black color, a 1"" froathy tan head that rises to the top of the tulip and proves to be steadfast til the end. A fair amount of lacing, soft legging, and retention.  Strong aromas of roasted malts, burnt toast, deeply roasted coffee, and waves of burnt cocoa. Truely aggressive, attacking the nose.  Equally strong flavors favor the espresso character, while the burnt toast and cocoa provide complex flavor to the highly roasted grains. Milder fruity flavors of plumbs, dates, licorcie, and raisons round out the roughter grain-related tastes very well. Not to be outdone, the hops also provide a piney, light resin tone to the finsihing flavors. Lightly acidic flavors later remind me of bitter coffee once more.  Sweet, smooth, creamy textures conjure up a full and round body with a billowing and expansive initial mouthfeel. The beer settles and allows the hops, acid, and light sourness to cause a lightening in the body to allow for ease in drinking. Hop bitterness begins to gain dominance over the astringent coffee, toasty bite. The light warmth of 9% abv. kinda gets lost in the complex flavors and textures.  Very well attenuated and controlled yeast character made this beer a Godfather of Stouts and continues to outlast newer Stouts with its restraint and boldness.

A thick dark tan head dissappeared slowly leaving no lacing behind.  Smell - Molasses, dates and malt. Delicious odor, but not very strong.  Taste - An upfront sweet flavor. The date flavor hits first then a molasses, cocoa and espresso tone joins. A mossy bitterness lets you down after the more dominant flavors. I think the beer would be better with a less potent bitter aftertaste - of at least a different flavor than moss. The espresso flavor and the bitterness dominant at higher temperature.  Mouthfeel - The alcohol stings the tongue. Stouts should be viscous or creamy, this one was a little thin for my taste. Not terrible though.

A fruity sweetness quickly falls out into a bold roasted malt flavor. The finish is long lasting and reminiscent of burnt toast and dark unsweetened chocolate.

The sweetness is still there under all of that alcohol and hops. But still. It's definitely not terribly offensive. Just....it tastes best at nearly room temp where the alcohol is more subdued.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,KarlHungus,4.75,"Pours a solid opaque black color, with a nice dark tan head. Good lacing through out the pint. Smells of caramel, chocolate, cream, and alcohol. The taste is of chocolate and roasted malt. The alcohol warms the throat as it passes into the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is full bodied and dry. Overall, this is a very nice brew.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,bobbyc881,4.78,"Adventures of South Carolina Guy at Brickskeller in DC:  Wow. My first Imperial Stout. This was goal #1 on my journey of better beer. Being such a stout fan, I was really looking forward to this.  Appearance was decieving at first. A small, unassuming little bottle. Maybe I was expecting Beer Angels to sing... Rasputin then told me to pour, so I did. Black, black, black. A nice brown head that settled down thin. Very little carbonation.  Smell was incredible. Big roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, dark fruits, and a bit of alcohol...oh, 9%, we don't get that in SC.  Perfect taste. Best beer I've ever tasted. Period. Insansely complex. Chocolates, fruits, coffee, hops bitterness, and a faint reminder that there's a wad of alcohol in there.  This felt great going down, with a very pleasant sweet taste hanging around, inviting me back for more. Nice and thick.  I think these are meant to be had one at a time. So, I came back 2 days later for my second.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Shiredave,4.63,"I just shared this beer with a friend - because his fave beer is Youngs Dbl Choc. Stout. He now has a new fave. I wont waste time waxing poetic - Im sure it has all been posted before. This is THE Imperial stout - at least from the USofA. Full of roasty/ toasty burnt chocolate flavor - immensely complex and drinkable with a reasonable alcohol content. If you like robust stouts and Porters, and haven't tried an Old Raspy, do yourself ( and a friend maybe) a favor and find it. Absolutely Outstanding!!!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,joecast,4.75,"hmmm, my first RIS review. looking forward to it. this is actually my third bottle of this, not that im counting. the first two having been shared with a cousin who so kindly brought me four bottles.  great loking label with Mr. Rasputin seemingly giving last rights to whomever may unleash the spirits from within. listed as 9%abv, no dating obvious to me. maybe its what is written in what i am guessing is russian. makes learning spanish in high school seem even less useful.  pours deep black forming a thin, dark tan head which disipates to a lace. ends up with small groupings (islands) of small bubbles. only the slightest carbonation.  aroma is a delightful, no offence to raspy as he seems rather grumpy, mix of all things stout. strong roasted and burnt malt. some coffee. finishing with a bit of astringent alcohol which is the only thing keeping the aroma from a 5.  taste is phenomenal. espresso, roasted malt, bitter chocolate, strong hop bitterness, alcohol heat. all of it in truck-loads.  mouthfeel is like no other i have tried. smooth and filling. just the way i imagine it should be.  although this point is obvious, ill point it out. this stuff is intoxicating. tough call for me on how to score this as i doubt it could really improve. the only area for improvement i could see would be hiding the alcohol a bit better, but that may not be a good thing. its like a 20 year old mike tyson punching you in the head. if you didnt feel the hurt, he'd probably kill you (then eat your children or something). but if you could feel the hurt, you'd call the fight after the first round. ok, maybe not the best analogy, but i just finished an old rasputin, and i know ive had enough.  8/4/05- just enjoying the last of my bottles. a sad day, but one i knew was coming eventually. i am enjoying reviewing my review almost as much as drinking the fabulous brew. the only adjustment to my previous score is to up the taste from 4.5 to 5.0. cheers to north coast for producing this fine ale, and please do continue. i will have to seek this out next time i am in the states.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Vancer,4.31,"Good ol Ratty  an outstanding RIS. From the moment that black tar poured, and the foamy, dense tan head appeared  I knew this would be bliss. Rich, malty, dark chocolate aroma. Not quite as strong as anticipated. EXcellENT heavy hitter taste  oh the burnt toast, malty, balanced well with hops. Slight anise finish. Upon warming, raspberry and plums tickled the tonsils. Thick and creamy, I spilled a smidgen on my arm  looked like black blood as it trickled down. Slurped up what I could.

112,412,neonbrown82,4.46,"I love me an Imperial Stout. Unfortunately I only have access to about 3 examples of the variety even despite having such a massive selection of beers available. This beer was acquired from BIF20 thanks to axisjones. This is exactly what I have been craving.  The appearance was awesome. I poured it into my paper thin John's Grocery tulip. I could feel the sludginess of the liquid through the thin glass as it poured. I never would have imagined I would be able to say something about the appearance and presentation of a beer based on a tactile sense, but I could tell how viscous this beer was just by watching it fill the glass. It was very oily and delicious despite what my witnessing friend thought about it.  The smell was a bit lacking, but improved as it warmed obviously. Smells of chocalatey malt, only slightly roasty. It even SMELLS thick and oily.  The taste is quite sweet and chocolatey. Once again, only slightly roasty. Has a hint of a soy sauce taste in the background, but this is not discouraging. Very good, and only improves in the aftertaste.  The mouthfeel is very smooth and oily. Has a bit of a dry finish in which the roastiness finally shines through with a coffee hint. Quite exceptional.  Drinkability could be higher, but at almost 9%, this is a delicious and highly drinkable beer. I wish I had it readily available here. Thanks again, axisjones (I was secretly hoping from the start that I'd recieve my BIF package from CA).",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,mentor,4.15,"12 oz bottle picked up during travels sometime in 2004, cellared for about a year, and consumed in June 2005. Pours a half-finger brown head over a nearly clear dark brown/ruby red liquid. Smells or alcohol, cofee, chocolate and licorice. Not in my face alcohol, it's a gentle stingy alcohol that supports the other scents. Tastes thick dark sweet. Chocolate is strong and over the nice rich roasty. Like a chocolate coffee desert. The potent chocolate is almost like a syrupy chocolate, like you would pour over vanilla ice cream, but it's not a cheap chocolate. It's a really rich chocolate, like you would get from a reputable foreign producer The alcohol plays with it nicely to make a rummy taste that has raisin and plum characteristics. In later sips, as the beer warmed, a strong toffee made itself evident. The creamy thick mouthfeel really adds to the character of this beer. Carbonation is mild, but forms an interesting acrid sting that negotiates with the rich sweet and reinforces the tinge of alcohol burn.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Buildscharacter,4.58,"What's not to love about this beer. I would have to say that this and Brooklyn's Black Chocolate Stout are two of my favorite brews.  The brew is black as night with a nice brownish head that just screams for you to throw it back. The bottle is quite with old Rasp just pointing his two fingers at you.  The taste of this beer is just amazing. And not to mention that of the 100 times or so that I've had this great beer, it's never failed to impress, so you know that quiality and consistnecy go together.  Very malty and thick in your mouth with great chocolate and coffee undertones. It's just so mellow and well balanced that you really can't find anything to complain about. Also, while hovering in the high alcohol region it makes you feel great after a single bottle. Love this beer. Not for the faint of pallet.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,AlexJ,4.45,"Thanks to my new friend Mickey aka Michelle for sending me a duo of these bad boys.  A vigorous pour unleashes a tarry black brew wearing a tightly knit cap of oatmeal colored foam which lingers for a while, eventually settling down to a light ring, leaving only a notion of lace.  A big, bold aroma of sticky sweet dark fruits layered with bittersweet chocolate and fresh, damp coffee grounds. A harmonious marriage of bitter and sweet.  Initially bittersweet, filled with dark jammy fruit and dark, rich chocolate. Freshly ground and wet coffee with bitter baker's chocolate washes over, leading to a hoppy exit filled with notes of pine sap and crushed citrus peels. There is a mellow campfire smokiness throughout the tasting that lends itself well to the bittersweet nuances. This beer ends with an oaky, earthy dryness that trails off to a lasting finish that leaves my mouth tasting like I just ate a dark chocolate covered pinecone.  Body is medium, yet dense and slick, lending to full and creamysmooth mouthfeel. Very coating and filled with oily resins. There are few beers that posess a finish this long. ""Never say die"", indeed!  note: Old Rasputin goes exceptionally well with the chocolate almond pistaccio biscotti's we had for desert.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,warriorsoul,4.18,"I have been craving an Imperial Stout, so I figured I'd finally try this bad boy...a carry over from New Beer Sunday if you will. Cloudy dark w/ dark brown edges only in the pour. A nice full finger of creamy light brown head...lacing clings to the side of my snifter and goes nowhere. A bit too carbonated in the nose, taking away from the olfactory experience at this point...sweet carmelized malts, cocoa, butter rum and just a touch of alcohol. The taste is much sweeter than I was expecting, but also has a deep, dark smoked flavor within a robust coffee blend. The finish is a bit dry, but not bitter. Refreshing in its finish for the viscousity of this bad boy...it's still a few steps below Founder's Breakfast Stout, but IMHO, it is a nice substitution if you can't obtain the aforementioned. Mouthfeel is thick, but not syrupy. The alcohol is very well hidden..only makes its way to the surface at the last few sips. I would enjoy a couple of these, but since I am a true hophead at heart, I would not pick this for a session brew.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,sinistermadman,4.28,"This brew pours a deep black with a nice nut colored head that lingers for a good time. Smell: Toffee, burnt malt, expresso, faint chocolate aroma.  Taste is classic stout. Delicious roasted malt coupled with bitter expresso/chocolate. Hops are warm up front, but then the brew tapers into an almost sweet finish. Bitter chocolate rides out until the end. The taste lingers after the drink. Nice. This brew is medium bodied, creamy, and very much at home on the palate. A must try for all stout lovers. Cheers.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,JackStraw22,4.73,"Appearance: Nearly pitch black body, inch and a half of caramel colored head. Retention and lacing were both nice.  Smell: Chocolate/mocha, coffee, and roasted malts galore hit the nose. Slight citrusy and fruity aromas sneek in underneath.  Taste/Mouthfeel: Wow! This stuff knocks you on your ass then kicks you in the face. And that never felt so good. There's so much going on it's hard to know where to start. The hops are loud and fierce. The roasted malts are king in this, though. Burnt wood, coffee, mocha all come through nice and balanced. Mouthfeel is bold and creamy. Maybe a slightly dry finish with the alcohol, but it all works.

112,412,malty,4.47,"Poured from a 12 oz. stubby brown bottle - no freshness date.  Appearance is midnight brown with the faintest dark ruby highlight on the edges. A khaki colored head settles down to 1/4"".  The scent of this stout is very intriguing... There's the strong roasted malts, damp coffee grounds and dark bitter chocolate. But what's this liqueur-like boldness I'm getting? Ahhh! It smells like a cross between licorice and root beer. Quite odd but very interesting.  The taste is very fresh with a stong flavor of bitter roasted earthy malts and there's that intriquing liqueur flavor carried in from the nose, hmmm... A powdered sugary sweetness complements the boldness of this gracefully. The hops hold-up nicely to this bold and bouistrous brew, creating a herbally dryness which is quite pleasant.  Mouthfeel is superb! A very creamy texture and full bodied. Fine carbonation at just the right level. A semi-dry long lingering finish.  Drinkibility is dangerously high. Alcohol is masterfully masked, would have never guessed 9%.  Overall utterly complex and a multi-layered tower of flavors. Strong but not heavy-handed. Bold but not brash. Big but graceful. I'm positive I'll detect many more flavors and nuances the next time a try this fine stout. Oh well, I'll endeavor to persivere.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,horndecker,4.2,"Deep dark brown black, a decent head, purple-edged tan, full and creamy, very fine carbonation. The smell has a tricky mix of espresso, raspberries, medicinal hops and raisins. A bit off the beaten track. At least the track I'm on. But it's very nice. The flavor is a big hit of espresso and french ultra-bitter chocolate. Burnt malt underneath, then the hops chime in, leading to a dry and dusty finish. Nice mouthfeel, pleasant and foamy, and a nice balance between all the flavors.  A real nice imperial stout, not Sam Smith's (my fave), but an interesting change of pace.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,asabreed,4.08,"4-pack purchased for around $7. This is sampled from one of those bottles.  Appearance: What I expected from a stout with such a solid reputation. An off-white / tan and mocha-colored head, big and frothy. Body is dark black and opaque.  Smell: Lots of things going on when it warms. Raisins, honey, coffee, dark and burned chocolate malt, slight toffee, slight berry. Doesn't smell too sweet, but rather melds everything together quite well.  Taste: Poweful on the burned and chocolate malt, but not overbearing. Slight berries and sweetness mix with the malt character for an interesting complexity. Drink this at celler temperature for sure, as I only had mine in the fridge for about 30 minutes, and halfway through the glass -- as the slightly colder temperature's gotten back down to cellar temperature -- there's already so much more going on. Lingering aftertaste that stays nicely on the back of the tongue with some burned and sweet notes.  Mouthfeel: For as much of a whopper of a stout this is, it's not really heavy, but maintains creaminess and balanced carbonation levels. Pretty excellent.  Drinkability: This is rich stout, and one that would be a waste make a session of, not to mention the high ABV. Can't wait to try it with a rich dessert.  North Coast continues to impress me with their solid representations of almost all the styles they do. For me they're up there with Rogue, Victory, DFH, Great Lakes, and Stone. I just wish they'd add some more style / variety to their line-up, so hopefully the coming years will provide that.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,tgbljb,3.78,"somewhat ominous-appearing bottle. Poured a deep black almost opaque color. The head is puffy cream color and long-lasting.

112,412,Higravity,3.43,"I think this beer gets by on reputation alone. It is as mild of the road Imperial Stout I have had. It has the oil color and profile one would think with very little tan-cream head. There are some hop notes in the nose but it is nothing but burnt wood shavings with out the smoke after that. It is just a roasted heavy body, mostly from the alcohol, stout that can't be called creamy, it is very acidic. It lacks the smoothness of a better stout and the fruitness that can hide in the beers is also not present. I am not impressed, but by the end I almost enjoy chewing on burnt wood, but then again maybe not.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,NeroFiddled,4.42,"Old Rasputin is not as dark as many other Imperial stouts, with luminous dark mahogany highlights beneath its creamy yellowed-tan head. And it's head retention leaves a bit to be desired as well. It does leave some thin lace, however, which is nice. And what it lacks in appearance it makes up for in aroma. It's slightly vinous with some yeasty fruitiness coming through the maltiness, followed by a touch of dark chocolate, espresso, and a waft of hops. It's quite slick, and a touch creamy, across the palate with a full body and a restrained, natural carbonation. The yeasty fruitiness carries through into the flavor with notes of prunes, plums, and berries; all backed by a massive assult of malt that offers espresso, burnt black coffee, dark caramel, and the suggestion of molasses as well as a pinch of brown sugar. It finishes with some resinous hops and a drip of black licorice before fading into a long, very dry finish. Quite nice!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,SupaCelt,4.3,"Old Rasputin. The pour released an ultradark brown stout that would be called black in human speak. A cocoa head of small stature dispersed into a ringer without much procrastination. This ringer remains intact due to the efforts of falling lace curtains throughout the excursion. A nice looking glass of heaven.  The smell threw me a big shout out of hops as a salutation while Old Rasputin on the bottle was throwing up his ""What it is, Blood?"" hand jive to egg me on. Alright then. Nice chocolate covered coffee bean and black malt aromas march in behind the hop bouquet. You smell good for an old dead guy, Rasputin.  The flavour was grand. Nice chocolate syrup and cream flavours along with the coffee and bitter impressions make this a great tasting imp. There is a very pleasant roasted appeal to the taste. This coupled with the hop character make for a truly excellent taste amplifier for the choco-coffee expressions. Very nicely juggled components indeed. This stuff is really quite good. Warmth and sting are provided by the alcohol which meshes perfectly to the flavour framework. Utterly consumable. Very nice.

112,412,NearerMyBeerToMe,4.15,"Ebony-colored liquid, nicely sheened, fills the glass and raises a noisy tan head, about 1"" deep, to the rim. Bubbles of various size crackle away and leave handsome pock marks in the head as it works its way down the glass, leaving a somewhat soapy cling. The aroma kicks off with big sniffs of cocoa and prunes that get pulled by a tarry woodiness into a bitterness of coffee-and-lemon. Here's an American-made Imperial Stout that recognizes that when it comes to hops, modesty can be a virtue. Baking-soda nosefeel is powdery and dry. Over a base of mellowly toasted cedar can be detected light--not burnt--fruit flavors of orange peel and melon rinds dipped in dark chocolate. Black coffee takes over, with black peppercorns rounding out the finish. The tastes distribute widely and fluidly through a dryish, clean, and softly carbonated mouthfeel that carries the bitterness all the way to the back of the throat. At no point could I detect the 9% alcohol level, except for my light daze at the end of the serving.

112,412,BadBadger,4.6,"A very pleasant imperial stout. Pours nice and dark into the glass, with a very nice tan and foamy head. The head retention was brief. But a bit of swirling easily recreates the head for enjoyment, with each raising. Smell is a wonderful mixture of malt sweetness, bitter hops, and alcohol. The taste is much more than pleasant. However, at very limited points the alcohol content is unmasked, something my palate prefers not to notice-but this does not detract from the wonders of this fine beverage.

Finish is bitter hops mingling with the well-roasted coffee tastes.  Mouthfeel: Good body. Much heavier than (say) Guinness, but lighter than (say) Victory Storm King.

Roaseted coffee, bittersweet dark chocolate, and dark sugary fruit mix seamlessly with an assertive pine-accented hop component. A wonderful smelling beer! Rich, roasted malt flavors up front meld with some sweetish, overripe dark fuits. Light chocolate coffee notes pick up right before a big rush of bitter hops. Cascadey and delcious, they provide nice balance. Finish is hop bitter, with vinous notes, tannins, and some warming alcohol.

Tastes of burnt coffee and black malt, with a pleasant bitterness and a dry finish. More carbonation than I expected, but it goes well with the flavor. The high alcohol content is not as evident as it was in the nose; I could not even discern the slightest alcohol flavor.

Rich aromas predict assassination of the Imperial Family of beers. Born in Siberia on the banks of the Tura River and renowned for his drunkenness, stealing and womanizing were activities Rasputin in fact was developing into a rake, a man with a debauched, and endless, sexual appetite. This brew will change you in a similar way. This extreme aromatic stout is truely a liquid full of flavors. Rasputin was an advocate of the renegade sect within the Orthodox faith, the Skopsty trying to reach God was through sinful actions practicing ""sin to drive out sin."" A awesome brewed RIS to drive out all other RIS's this miracle worker's powerful aroma and stong flavors hypnotize and cause the bleedings for the ultimate RIS to stop.

Smells like figs, like date pudding with a carmelly crust, and a small hot espresso. Don't dismiss the appearance of alcohol. It's so carmelly and fruity and malty.... Rich, sweet raspberry, milk chocolate ganache gives way to toasted malts all dark and smokey. The alcohol twists this all up into a robust bitterness with a metallic edge.

The smell is dry and robust with flavours of coffee, lemons, liquorice, roasted malt, white bread, and porridge rolled oats.  The carbonation is fresh and surprisingly strong, but it suits the beer fine.  The first taste is a creamy one with a touch of cocoa. It develops into a dry, very bitter flavour with some citric notes. The body is rather weak, or is it just hiding below all that bitterness?

Some hops present here aswell, perhaps grapefruit in there aswell. Dont know, just great smell on this.  Runs over tastebuds with quite so much burned malts. Chocolate mixed with coffee tones in faintly leaving place for sweet and harsh traces lifted by carbonation. Nice, fruity taste with a bitter harsh aftertaste give a nice bitter aftertaste with a warming alcoholic prescence. Sweet, yet burned and rough. Excellently balanced in there.

112,412,yoko,4.5,"Wow, Old Rasputin greets you himself with a hand raised high (some sort of signal to those in the know), unyielding eyes and a few words left not understood. The brew on the other hand I understand as a great imperial stout. I didn't expect it.  The pour was an espresso color (oils and all) with a short lived, short head much like the tail of an espresso pour. What lace remained was like a milk mustache -- just there. The nose collected in greatness - semi-sweet chocolate mocha...thank you roasted malts. For such a dark, light filtering beverage the carbonation went throughout. The mouth was soft, round, full.  I pause to let the temperature come down a bit - to allow for all to come through and called zatte bie who was walking the Haight /Ashbury scene, filling my senses in another way.  The time warp was a wonderful excursion. Old Rasputin exceeds itself. The nose softens, the taste broadens and the sharp and/or high tones balance. All became bigger yet softened. What was initially a hoppy finish with a high squeal followed by a dry note with a metal element transformed. I found Rasputin to be balanced from nose to finish.

Coffee, chocolate. I dont catch the black cherry in the flavor. The level of bitterness and the alcohol give this an almost spicy character. Very bright, smooth mouth feel.

112,412,Stimack,4,"Was able to give this brew a try the other evening, my first experience with Old Rasputin. It pored to a pitch-black color allowing no light to filter through. Had a frothy dark tan head that was slow to break down leaving a nice amount of lacing through the first half of the brew. The aromas are of dark malts, coffee or espresso, dark fruit, chocolate and a few other things that seem to be hard to pinpoint. The taste is very warming as you do notice a nice slight alcohol flavor that goes perfect with the tastes of chocolate and coffee and has the right amount of hop at the end. This is a very good brew one to be enjoyed during the cold winter.

112,412,whartontallboy,4.33,"Pours deep black with a tight tan head that holds well. Smell is alcohol, roasted malt, chocolate, and a bit of espresso. Flavor is very nice. The alcohol comes through, but so do the big roasted malts, and the aftertaste is full of chocolaty goodness. There's a hint of citrus rind on the tongue that rounds things out nicely. And again, each sip finishes with a big chocolate burst. Medium mouthfeel complements these flavors very nicely. Surprisingly drinkable for a stout its size; I think I really dig this one!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,beersarang,4.03,"Pours a near black with a dark tan rocky head that leaves sheets of lacing down the glass. The lace is thick and vinuous and slowly creeps down the glass. Quite nice.  The smell is of alcohol and fruit.  Flavor is of heavily roasted malts and apples. Alcohol plays into this beer rather well, and the hop bitterness brings it all together. For an imperial stout I think this one may be a bit sweet. Still quite good, mind you.  Near syrupy mouthfeel with large bubbles, big beer for sure. Pleasing to drink, and for a 9% beer it wasn't too much effort to finish a bottle.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Riggo,4.15,"Appearance is deep, dark brown to black and opaque. Definitely one of the darkest beers ever. Head is creamy and tight and colored a chocolately-beige. Smell is cedary, burnt ash, espresso, and olives. On palate, notes of bubblegum, bitter, dark chocolate, smoky/peaty, bitter, tangy and sweet. Finish is bitter, and fruity. Mouthfeel on this one is thick, viscous, syrupy. Impressive.  This is a big beer. Packed with character (and alcohol), it's not for the faint of heart. A first-rate sipping beer.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,ypsifly,4.47,"Black like a Spinal Tap album cover with a head that is more tan than expected. The head dissapears rather quickly and leaves thin lacing.  Hearty aromas of roasted malt and dark chocolates with some hop in the end. Very nice.  Tastes much like it smells with the hops being more pronounced in the finish. I know the alcohol is in there, but I can't taste it.  Has a very balanced, almost velvety mouthfeel. More, but not too much, carbonation than most examples of this style. Adds a nice touch that shows attention to detail on the part of the brewer.  Drinkable? Oh yeah!  I'm really impressed by what I have seen from this brewery. Rasputin was one of the more interesting characters in Russian history. Its very fitting that someone would chose to name a brew with such character after him.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,medic25,4.23,"Finally found this beer in New York; tough to find in CT.... Pours a pitch black, with a slight brown head that quickly dissipates. Delicious, roasted malt flavor. Little hint of hops; for the high alcohol volume it really isn't an overwhelming part of the flavor. Picked up a taste of raisins too. Nice smooth mouthfeel, and not a huge aftertaste. This is a beer I could see drinking all night. This was my first experience with a Russian imperial; big difference from the Irish stouts I'm used to, but definitely a beer I'd drink again.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,MuddyFeet,4.32,"Wish the bottle had a bottled date. It's the same as the one pictured on BA, but the words ""Old Rasputin"" are in black and not gold. It was also just delevered to the beer store that day, not sure how much that goes towards quality control, but at least it was not on a shelf for the past 9 months. The beer poured into the glass a midnight black in color. Light was not even making it around the edges of the beer. A finger-width head formed on top of the beer, then dissipated to ring the glass. Stringy lace would form in small amounts around the glass as well. The aroma is of malts and burnt toffee. Also, just a touch of smoke. The taste is chocolate, old coffee, and malt. Hops come through in the aftertaste. Alcohol is just slightly present in the mouthfeel, but not in such a bad way. The only problem I foresee with drinking this beer is that it is kind of overwhelming and you will lose your taste buds after too long.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Appearance: No light getting through here - completely black, with a dark tan colored head. Fades relatively quickly to leave a thin lace.  Smell: Aroma of cocoa and coffee with a slight nuttiness.  Taste: Mmm .. yummy. Lots of roasted flavor. Smooth and drinkable despite the high ABV. Great mouthfeel - slightly thick but not overly so - low carbobnation level that works great. Some great hop flavor manages to sneak in - must have been lots in there to make it over the great malty flavors.  Overall impression: Wow .. very nice stout. This is highly drinkable for the style - great for a winter night. This would also make a fantastic companion to a nice strong cigar .. in fact, time to crack another and light up!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,necoadam,4.08,Oh yeah!  Poured out a nice solid black color with a tan head.  Smell consisted of lots and lots of coffee/espresso aromas. Roasted malts also come through. A hint of earth can be found in the background.  Taste was good. Big roasted malt flavors ride through the beginning and almost into the aftertaste. Some hops thrown in to balance it out. Big flavors in this one. The coffee comes through underlying the malts in the middle. Quite nice.  Mouthfeel was medium to full bodied. Carbonation was on the light side to make the flavors show up.  A nice evening sipper for sure. Didn't except to see the flavors to show so much muscle. A nice surprise.,North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Nose: First whiff and it is full of alcohol, almost burns the nose. Chocolate and burnt and acrid roasted malt smell. Probably has a lot of Black Patent.  Taste: Starts with sweet maltiness. Upfront alcohol bitterness. Very roasty, tons of chocolate and some coffee. Light bitterness throughout, and sweet finish.  Notes: Tasty, a little solventy alcohol flavors, definitely needs some cellaring.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,cracker,4.3,An exceptional imperial stout. Pours almost like a viscous expresso with very little head out of the bottle. Smell is overwhelmingly 'chocolate' like with a slight coffee aroma. My first impression when sipping it is hops and lots of hops. I prefer my imperial stouts with a strong hop backbone to support the loads of roasted malts otherwise the alcohol presence is overwhelming and they tend to be on the 'sweet side'. In this case there is a great balance and the alcohol isn't as noticeable. Overall is very similar to Storm King Stout by Victory Brewing. I highly recommend this beer to any imperial stout fan.,North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Excellent notes of coffee, chocalate, and licorace in both aroma and taste. good balance. Very dry on the palate encourages slower, more reflective consumption. I will have this again to drive the cold winter chill away. To BAs, as I drank this, I wondered about how it would mix with the Mad Elf? I think pretty good. I will also have this again with a nice spirit accompaniment. Any suggestions?",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,ncbrewerbun,4.32,An unexpected gift to get to try this one in North Carolina! Smuggled in by my buddy Jim.  Poured in inky black with a creamy tan head.  Aroma makes this beer -- a huge chocolate hits you right off the bat. Slight fruitiness; malt (comes through with caramel and vanilla); and the hops are present.  Flavor is coffee-like with an alcohol presence. Malt also creates a tasty brew.  Aftertaste is hop bitterness with coffee beans.  An enjoyable sipping beer for this time of year.,North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,LarryKemp,4.45,"The esters, raisons?, prunes? whatever, grabbed me as soon as I popped the cap. What a nice, strong, complex aroma But the chocolate in the background will finally come forward. Makes for a very complex nose.  THe beer poured a jet black with a firm tan head that lasted a very long time. Just after I poured the beer, I was distracted for nearly 10 minutes and there still is a solid layer of foam resting atop the liquid.  The malts really kick in on the taste buds. Great chocolate and roasted intermingled. Really rich and VERY intense. Particularly when the bitterness wrestles with the sweet. I can barely make out hints of the esters on the tongue. They add a little variety  Very full bodied with a high viscosity. The bitterness tingles the roof of my mouth. The alcohol does not make itself known. All 9% is hiding somewhere I am sure but the other elements are so strong and interesting, the alcohol does not have room to shine.  I would recommend this beer. It is true to style and never is overbearing. Each sip showcases a different aspect of this fine beer.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

The aroma was somewhat sweet, with prominent dark raisins, and hints of dark malt. I expected more roasted character... but what I got was good, in its own way.  The taste... DEFINITE Imperial stout. Very strong roasted malt, with a not-quite-coffee aftertaste. Good stuff.  VERY good mouthfeel... nice and full and chewy. had to take off a bit for drinkability though, it was just too strong.

A bitter undertone, but this does not detract from the taste. Roasted malts with a bitter-sweet aftertaste. This is thick, but smooth and easy drinking. In my opinion, the only detractor of this beer is its limited availability.

Pours black as night with a dense beige head. Thin and quick lacing. Great roasty aroma with malt, and robust coffee. Rich body with a great balance of sweet malt and caramel, along with coffee and sneaky hops that poke through periodically. The alcohol is well-hidden too but you can tell it is there.

112,412,GClarkage,4.87,"12/09/04- On tap at the Englander in San Leandro, CA  Appearance- Pours a dark tanish-black opaque color. Great head and good lacing.  Smell- Ahhhh, lots of chocolate and lots of coffee mixed together. Both roasted to perfection.  Taste- Frickin awesome! This compares almost equally to Stone Imperial Stout IMO. I had Stone two weeks ago and needed to give this one another try to compare. Tons of chocolate and coffee swirling around in harmony. Roasted malt thrown in for good measure.  Mouthfeel- On tap this is phenomonal. Carbonation level is near perfect and after it warms up it's even more tasty. Fairly thick, but goes down like a fat guy on a waterslide. (fast) :)  Drinkability- The only drawback is that you can feel this one after you finish it. You can still have another, but two is almost too much. Always will be one of my favorites.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Smell: Smells very strong of chocolate and coffee malts, with an almost sweet, fruity back. The nose is very complex, and very intriguing.  Taste and Mouthfeel: At first it's balls out Russian Imperial Stout, with no holds barred. Strong coffee barrage the taste buds. Slowly a tiny hint of hop bitterness comes through, with an almost fruity and sweet flavor. The finish is mostly hoppy, with a nice lingering aftertaste. In the mouth the beer is just right. Thick and creamy, without sacrificing any amount of flavor. Superb.  Drinkability and Overall: This is definitly a classic beer. Full of flavor and complexity without being too overboard like most Russian Imps. A nice, well-balanced flavor makes this is drinkable beer, expect for the fact that it's 9% ABV. Overall, try it.

112,412,HardTarget,4.62,"Stubby 12 oz. brown bottle, no date, Cyrillic lettering but Product of the U.S.A., and abv listed at 8.9% (oh momma!). Aged this one a good year in my cellar. Aroma: Rich malt, rum soaked raisins, burnt chocolate and a nut aroma, somewhat like almonds. Appearance: Glass is an opaque black with some brown edges showing trace amounts of carbonation coming up to feed a very thin collar of dark tan head. The collar persisted through the beer, but left no lace. Flavor: Outrageous! Scandalous! Divine! Insane! All of the above. A syrupy dark roasted and toasted malt taste that quickly shows a rum raisin heart that is attacked and pierced by an acidic hop spike. I also get some black cherry and wood flavors as well. Very intense and heavy flavor, I can see this as a love or hate beer. Mouthfeel: Medium body, surprisingly light given the dark rich taste. Carbonation is firm. Overall Impression: When the world has beaten, berated, shot, stabbed and thrown you into a frozen river, this beer will revive you and help you overcome. It is one of my favorites (can you tell?) and was a gateway for my life as a BA. Drinkability is more along the lines of I want this beer again, later.

Aroma: Quite intense aroma of dark fruit, bitter chocolate, coffee, strong herbal hops and a pronounced alcohol note.  Taste: Opens with dark roasted malt flavors, followed by dark chocolate notes and bitter coffee, after which a wave of vinous sweet alcohol washes over the palate and offers a note of gracious warmth. Later in the taste, notes of bitter cocoa surge. The taste finishes with a lingering bitter coffee and chocolate note, and a wave of fairly strong herbal hops.  Mouthfeel: Pleasant and smooth with a little zesty carbonation at the opening; quite full, with a velvety texture.  Drinkability/notes: A superb winter beer, truly deserves to be sipped and savored in the manner of a liqueur. Perfectly suited to the darkest, coldest nights of winter.  Presentation: Packaged in a stubby twelve-ounce brown glass bottle, with a pry-off crown, served in a La Fin du Monde tulip.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Ego,4.79,"A classic in my book. Dark brown head that dissapates, beautiful lace clings to the sides, classic roast aroma with the sweetness of the alcohol quite present.  In the mouth it has just enough carbonation to make it non syrupy and also to mask the heavier alcohol content. This may be too heavy for many people but if you like dark, malty, alchol laden brew.. this is a must try.  nose: Savor the nose in a big snifter glass, wonderfull, better than a starbucks venti hazelnut cappucino... the nose is unreal on this beer.  taste: The malt takes over early (front of tongue) on a sip and then fades into the strong coffee notes (back of tongue).  verdict?

112,412,mgdeth,4.35,"Appearance - This beer is essentially black. Just a thin slice of light reflects its way in throught the bottom of the glass. The thick tan head drops quickly, leaving some lace.  Smell - Roasty and malty. I do not detect a hop aroma. Inviting.  Taste - This one has a taste that knocks you on your ass, just the way I remember it from back in 1997. A strong, roasty, coffee flavor dominates this beer. There is also a bit of a salty taste, which is strange. Somehow, it seems to fit with the flavor explosion this beer always promises, but can be a bit distracting. I also detect a chocolate flavor in the aftertaste, Delightful.  Mouthfeel - Thick and meaty. This is not a first-time beer for macro swillers by any means.  Drinkability - This beer is surpisingly drinkable, but watch out for that 9% alcohol. My guess is that less experienced craft beer drinkers will find this less drinkable.  Comments - This beer more or less rules. Run out and buy some. Now. At one point in my life, this was the most intense beer experience imaginabe. Today, it is not far off from that.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

It smell like one terrific stout on steroids AKA a Imperial Stout. The flavor is very robust and is a good mix of dark malts and heavy hopping. Although a bit low on the alcohol for the style, this beer still packs a punch.

There is a lot to taste here. I've never had a more balanced stout. This is a superior beer. Mouthfeel: Creamy and velvety like no other.

Develops a few fingers of rocky tan head with a moderate pour, which dissolves to a creamy film and leaves moderate lace. Deep roasted malt aromas, predominantly burnt toast with underlying alcohol esters. Somewhat phenolic initial flavor which develops into roasted caramel and butterscotch and finishes with burnt toast and a long-lasting drying bitterness. A surprisingly complex and well-developed flavor, though I'm not crazy about the slightly phenolic note. The alcohol is, amazingly, nowhere to be found in the flavor profile. Nice rich and creamy medium body.

112,412,BuckeyeNation,4.35,"Deep, menacing mahogany with ruby highlights and a medium brown cascading head that would make a nitro pour proud. Initially four-fingers-and-a-thumb in size, the cap looks as if it'll last for a good, long while. Dark brown lace--some of the darkest I've ever seen--coats the glass, but doesn't last all that long.  The nose abounds with bittersweet chocolate. Yes, there's some coffee; yes, there's heavily roasted malt and hops; but chocolate is king as far as the aroma is concerned. On the palate, hops return with a vengeance. ""Regicide or death!"" they scream as they pound away at King Cocoa... sorry, I got carried away there for a moment. A huge quantity of heavily roasted black malt results in a constellation of flavors that includes bittersweet chocolate, espresso and anise. Each and every one fills the mouth with Godiva-like goodness.  Even with all that malt, the citric hoppiness is unrelenting and is at least as prominent as in a middle-aged Storm King. Strangely enough, I'd prefer to see the hops ratcheted back a few notches in this beer, something that I never thought I'd say.  The mouthfeel is akin to heavily silky melted chocolate and is some kind of chewy, as befits an Imperial stout. Those who don't believe this is a true Imperial stout have different standards than I do. Nearly unnoticed carbonation is a perfect capper on a nearly perfect mouthfeel.  Old Rasputin is a mega hoppy stout, perhaps a tad too hoppy. It's definitely not for the faint of heart or the faint of palate. Proceed only if you enjoy immensely flavorful, luxurious stouts that could fairly constitute a meal in and of themselves. Old Raspy is North Coast's best beer, I do believe.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,abcsofbeer,4.02,"I am a big fan of the Imperial Stout, so I was looking forward to this one. Pours a dark dark brown with no transparency. The head is tannish and poured to a thickeness of 1 inch. There is a fair amount of sticky lace at the top of the glass that goes away toward the bottom.  The aroma is of strong coffee, a bitter smell. Very malty and toffee smelling as well. The taste is much like a bitter, strong coffee. It is not thick as some stouts I have tasted. The aftertaste is like a bitter dark chocolate. The one thing apparent in the taste is the strong alcohol flavor. At 9%, it is not surprising, although some beers are better at masking the alcohol flavor than others. This one does not hide it, thus the reason for the drinkability sliding down the scale a little.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,HochFliegen,4.62,Now this is my kind of beer. When I poured it reminded me of a syrup it looked so dark and thick. I was hoping it tasted as good as it looked. It was black! It carried a nice brown head that just hung around the top of the beer. So far so good. The smell was quite potent. It had a hint of alchol in the nose but was was mixed really well with the chocolate and rasin like smell. It had a slight tart smell as well. This beer packs a punch in the flavor. I have to start with the ending since it is so much of the flavor in my opinion. It lingers for awhile with a tart/bitter sweetness that I enjoyed. The start is felt right away as soon as it hit my tounge. I could taste hints of chocolate and almost grapefruit/citrus like tones in there mixed with a nice malt flavor. This is one of my new favorite beers.,North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

No head in the pour, but a 1/4"" brown top emerges from nowhere. It is quite appealing! The head doesn't stay around, and there is no real lacing. A slight foam ring hangs around for a while.  Smell - I notice a lot of chocolate. Some coffee.  Mouthfeel is rich, but slightly creamy and alcoholey at the end.  Taste is quite thick. A syrupy chocolate sits on the tongue, and resolves into a slightly sweet and buttery finish. There is a strong alcohol overtone in the finish. There is very little unpleasant aftertaste.  This is an interesting mix. Stout like with a huge alcohol overtone in the finish. Lots of chocolate. Some coffee. If you are into any of these aspects of a beer, you MUST try this.

112,412,KoG,4.5,"Got this one at a Grocery store with the Hennepin, I'm not too sure how old it will be being as I believe this particular store probably doesn't sell much.  Poured out of the bottle a dark as oil black sludge that created a dark brown cascade that made a small brown head, not sure why there wasn't more. Didn't leave any lacing, but given the head I wasn't really expecting it. When I picked it up to sip it I noticed a small amount of light around the edge of the glass, made me think ""Gee, this seems more like a porter than a stout.""  EDIT: Second bottle was a much better appearance, lots o'head and lacing, better smell as well.  The smell was a bit lite, especially for a stout of this calibur. Picked up faint espersso and dark malt with toasted barley.  The Taste... Hrmmm, very BOLD. Reminds me of an 8-Ball stout but more bitter, finishes sweet with a definate dark dark dark chocolate aftertaste with a hint of alcohol, yum.  Mouthfeel was great, active carbonation from the tip of the tongue to the throat. Creamy yet not, but definately good.  Drinkability for me was pretty good, although I could see the 9% catching up quick after about 2 or 3.

112,412,MrNuggets,4.27,"Hey, I see light around the edges, what gives? Sure smells imperial! All the things that make bere great, all right there. Heavy hit of roasted malts in the initial tastes. Firm bitterness abundant throughout the layers. I've hated black liquorice even since I was a child. But, it doesn't seem out of place in this beer. It actually works very well. Taste would have most likey gotten a 5 had been a fan of the flavor. Mouthfeel is very out of place. A light bodied imperial stout? If you say so! Makes the thing drinkable. This has been my party brew for about a year now. ""Party at Joe's tonight? I'll bring Rasputin!""",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,Beersignal,4.02,A very seductive stout that pours dark and rich like cocoa. Difficult to judge the clarity due to its obscure nature but the head left me wanting. Not as abundant as I would have expected with no lacing and almost no retention.  Aromas were pleasing and beautifully harmonized. A well balance marriage of fruits and malt open the nostrils to let in heady vapours of alcohol. Quite nice.  The beer is medium in body despite its rich texture and provides a warming alcohol reflux after being swallowed. Soft malt up front is followed by fruitiness reminescent of black berries and currants. It finishes with a decidedly alcoholic bitterness supported by hoppy burnt character which hangs around for some time.  For me this is a solid imperial stout. It has an enticing character but is not too powerful. Complexity develops as the beer warms which keeps me interested and wanting another.,North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,beerceller99,4.05,12 oz. bottle. The color is black. The head is thick and brown. The body is thick and chewy. The taste is of burnt grains with a hint of dark fruits ( plums ). The finish is of bitter burnt grains and alcohol. As I drink this I see myself goose stepping in a WW II victory parade in Moscow Square !  A classic Russian Stout ; ),North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,oxmasterscream,4.03,"Appeared nearly black with dark brown highlights if angled correctly; a half finger tan head which left a nice, thick lacing as I drank. Aroma was spice, chocolate and raisins with a hint of prune. Taste up front was sweet, burnt dark malts, spicy and tangy in the middle with a nice bitter coffee finish, coupled with a warming from the high ABV. Mouth was thick and a little syrupy, not as syrupy as I would've liked though. Carbonation covered the tongue nicely. Taste wasn't as complex and exciting as I would've expected for an imperial stout but nonetheless, still quite good and not to be overlooked.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,rdrummer,4.6,"Okay, this is the best beer that I've had recently. I really hadn't read about it, although I should have. But it was a really pleasant surprise. The liquor store clerk didn't want to sell me the four-pack because it was very dusty. I'm glad I didn't let it sway my buying decision.  This is a very dark, almost black and opague stout with a medium sized brown head huge lacing. There are a lot of hints of flavors in the nose, but the roasted maltiness comes through more than anything else. There are hints of chocolate and coffee.  The taste is unbelievably smooth with a real roasted quality but rich chocolate, coffee, caramel, and fruity undertones. There is some hint of bitter hops or bitter chocolate at the end.  It is thick in the mouth and very satisfying almost like a meal. I finished the four-pack quickly and will be heading back for more of the dusty gem.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,odeed,4.6,"this is the first and i would say best imperial stout i have ever had.i just cracked another tonight and it never disapoints. black as all heck apperance with a nice smokey smell.very smooth considering the alcohol content.what else can i say but,its yummy!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,FormatKid,4.22,"This beer is not available in my area so a friend on a road trip brought a couple through to me. This style is quickly becoming one of, if not my most favorite style in existence so I appreciate it.  The packaging is a stubby 12oz bottle with a somewhatintimidating looking label. I poured this into a standard tumbler pint glass. The body is jet black with direct exposure to light yielding the slightest red tones. The head is off-white and is surprisingly white compared to other Russian Imperials Ive had. It recedes eventually but leaves sheets of lacing on the glass as the beer is consumed.  The nose is very roasty and bitter, this raises my anticipation to taste it even more. I smell deep dark, roasted coffee and ripe dark fruits.  This is a really fine beer on the palate. The mouthfeel is a little light, but this is made up for with the flavor. Charred malts come across first and maintain their hold on my senses throughout the drink. Again in the flavor I get that deeply roasted dark coffee taste, very delicious. The finish registers the hop bitterness and a piney, oily presence attempts to fight off the deep, luxurious flavor of the malts, somewhat successfully. A spicy alcohol kick peeps its head in slightly and leaves a subtle warmth in my throat. The flavors cling to the inside of my mouth and lips, thats one of the things I love about a good Russian Imperial.  A great, great beer from an amazing style of brewing. I have to say I felt the mouthfeel was slightly lacking compared to beers Ive had of the style that have totally blown my mind. None-the-less I look forward to having this one again and it is going great with the slowly cooling weather of the southern fall. Thanks again John.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,bashiba,4.33,"Upon pouring this beauty I received a very nice 2 or more inch head of tan threatening to overtake the top of the glass. As it relapsed it showed a lot of Lace down the side of the glass. The color is black with just a small hint of Deep Red that is only visible looking at the brightest of lights. Looks fantastic!  The scent has several nice scents of Dark Roasted Malts, Dark Chocolates, and Dark Coffee and a slight nuttiness.  The Taste is superb. It has a nice full upfront flavor with lots of Coffee and Chocolate flavors followed by a sweet but dark roasted maltyness and a little bit of nut with some small bits of alcohol notes. A very nice finish that was pleasant in the mouth from start to finish although feels a little thinner in the mouth than imperials.  In the drinkablility department it is a little high on the ABV so lends itself to be enjoyed in moderation, but I still found myself disappointed I didn't have another in the fridge.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Southernbrew,4.37,"Black with brown hues, small tan head.  Full aroma with bitter chocolate, espresso and burnt notes.  Full bodied, quite smooth. Rich chocolate and espresso show up first followed by caramel sweetness. Some hop bite in the finish and then you are left with a bitter-sweet aftertaste.  Delicious imperial stout. The alcohol is well hidden and the flavors are mixed very well.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,bensiff,4.07,"Poors a dark brown to black color with a quickly dissipating dark mocha colored head. Aroma is complex with a distinct roasted character, coffee, chocolate, and I even venture to say the slightest hint of toffee hiding in the mix.  The taste is complex as the aroma and almost as enjoyable. It rolls on the tongue lightly until it hits the back where the flavor kicks in fully. The roasted malt has a smokey character, bitter chocolate, espresso, and a kick of hop to round off the flavors. The finish is dominated by the high alcohol of this brew and is a lesser beer for it. The mouthfeel is not as smooth as I expect from this type of beer and is my largest complaint. Overall this is an enjoyable beer for those in a slow sipping mood and worth revisitting time and again.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Ninjaworm,3.61,Appearance: Blood black with a large creamy head that finally subsided leaving a 1/16 head with amazing lacing.  Smell: Faintly sweet vanilla blends into a linear alcohol nose.  Taste: Silky vanilla alcohol flavor with hints of oak.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and creamy.  Drinkability: Smooth alcohol flavor that melds into a vanilla profile making one dream for another.,North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,mudhoney,4.23,"I love a nice Imperial Stout. This one wasn't one of the best I have ever had, but still a very good choice. It poured black as night. Almost impossible to see through. The aromas are smokey. Hints of coffee and chocolate peek through. The flavor is bittersweet and chocolatey and slightly watered down for an Imperial Stout. Not thick in mouthfeel or flavor, but the taste is somewhat notable. Definitely a good choice for dessert or as a winter warmer but by far not my favorite.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,StuFox,3.73,"Not as thick as it looks. That being said, damn, this tastes good. Not quite the flavor level of the Founders' or Sammy Smith's Imperial Stouts, but delicious none the less. It has a bitternes and smokey character that few other beers have. Less solid of a body as those beers too. That, of course, still makes it thicker than carro syrup, but hey, let's keep this beer fighting against brews of the same weight class. Everyone should try this once, it's a good time.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,ALESwhatCURESya,4.2,"This beer is HUGE. The flavors are intensly amazing. The deep dark black that pours out immediately fills the air with a heavy dose of sweet and toffee-like aromas. This beer to me seems very complex...if you take just a small sip, the sweetness is very evident and somewhat single layered. With a larger sip, more layers seem to expose themselves and the high ABV becomes increasingly evident. In a sense, I would have to say that reviewing this intensely flavored stout could vary greatly by your drinking style. IMHO, this is one of the hardest beers to truly appreciate because of its power. Definately not a beer to waste on a friend who says ""sure I'll take one of those....I love the way Guiness tastes""",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Goldorak,3.55,"Sampled 11aug2004 (thanks Beersignal)  Pours down black, with a of hint of red when you place it against the light in just the right way. Small tan head, a little bit of a cascade as it poured down.  Smells alcoholic, with a definate sweetness I couldn't quite pinpoint. Strawberries? Sort of. Bubblegum? Maybe.  The alcohol is very present in the mouth, and stays with you, which is great in the dead of winter, not so much in August. The drinkability would have gained a solid point if I just got back from a few hours of pond hockey or x-country skiing, but would have lost a point if I didn't have air conditioning. As it warms a little the toasted malts take a bit more space, but not much. I didn't detect much coffee in this one, which is a great change of pace for this style.  If I ever get my hands on another one of these, I'll definately slap a ""do not open before x-mas"" sticker on it.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,HiroProtagonist,3.7,"Old Raspy was served from a stubby 12 oz. bottle. In a pint glass, the beer was black (deep ruby edge accents with backlighting), and was topped by a thin but persistant light brown head. The nose yielded deep-roasted-choco-molasses aromas that were accompanied by enticing though subtle notes of sasparilla, vanilla, and toasted sesame oil. Little sign of esters in the nose. The taste consisted of a rich dark-roasted cocoa-chocolate malt profile that was joined by some nice sharp dark cherry and plum notes that helped cut through initial roastiness. A robust smokey cocoa-bitter dark chocolate flavor dominates the subtle fruitiness in the finish, which left some rather flat lingering dark chocolate notes. The flavors are tasty and rich as expected, but I was dissapointed in the lack of complexity and interesting accents. I thought the finish was a bit too ""smoky"" as well. The body was appropriately smooth and full for the style. Old Rasputin is a full-flavored and robust Russian imperial stout, but for me lacks some of the important details found in many other examples of the style.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,sweethome,4.49,"Poured with a nice tan head which dissipated fairly quickly. Nose is complex - coffee, plum, roast malt, and just a hint of hops. Attacks the palate with a flood of roast malt, full of flavor... hint of raisin, coffee, toast. So beautifully rich. The hops are there late to provide a nice bitterness, but finishes out with an incredibly long roast malt finish.  I've tasted this blind versus Bells, Rogue and other world class Imperial Stouts. It is always worthy of the competition, but not quite there with the best. Savoring the flavors by itself, its hard to imagine why. A great beer in every way.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Phyl21ca,3.82,"Bottle: Poured a dark black colored beer with almost no head. Aroma is comprised of a strong chocolate and coffee mix. The chocolate and coffee also hits you right at the first sip along with some roastiness. A bit too much bitterness at the end for my liking though. Carbonation is bit weak and body is strong which was expected. Overall, this is a very good drink but maybe not as much as some make it out to be",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,skybluewater,4.27,"Appearence: Deep mahogany. Head dissapates, leaving a thin head. No lacing.  Smell: Chocolate, pure chocolate.  Taste: Outstanding, like chocolate-covered coffee beans. There's a warming alcohol present, but it's not obtrusive.  Mouthfeel: Coats the mouth with a thick glaze. Very nice.  Drinkability: It took me an hour and a half to drink, and at 8.9%, I wouldn't want to have more than one.  This is one fine, soul-warming beer, sure to ward off the cold on those winter days. I do believe that Mr. Rasputin and I are going to spend a lot of time together in the future.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,WetCoaster,4.12,"I almost fell into my cart when I saw that Old R had found its way back to shelves of Safeway--happy days are here again. In honor of this most joyous occasion, I thought I'd review it.  Appearance: A deep mahogany that takes on a nice ruby glow in the light, although it's not as dark as many stouts. The carbonation is fine and mild, and the head is tan and short lived. There isn't much lacing, oddly, but there is a collar that lasts throughout.  Smell: ""Booming"" does not come close to describing the aroma of this brew; even ice cold, it fills the room. Initially, it's one tight ball of sweet, dark fruit. As it warms, it begins to unwind. The darkness is still there, figs and raisins come on strong. There is also surprisingly strong Myer's rum-like alcohol in the nose. There is the usual molasses, caramel and a perplexing ""maybe it's chocolate, maybe it's not"" undertone. Finally, there is also a sharp, almost chardonnay aroma--hops? You'll notice this one.  Taste/Mouthfeel: No real surprises here; it tastes pretty much like it smells. In a word, chocolate-covered raisins. It's pretty straightforward, but you'll find some smokiness. Deep into the finish, a drying hoppiness emerges. Not surprisingly, the mouthfeel is medium/full with a sticky coating, although the carbonation is sharp enough to keep it lively.  Drinkability: It's a wonderfully tasty beer that's lighter than you might expect. But at almost 9%, it'd be a rough session.  While I really enjoyed this beer, it didn't quite have the ""wow"" factor I might have expected. Still, if you kick back, pour an inch or two at a time into a good tasting glass and spend and hour or so with Rasputin, he'll be your buddy for life.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,HopHeadKen,4.1,"This stout pours with a thick foamy cascading head, creamy and light Brown. The color looks black but has a rich dark amber around the edges when viewed in bright light (in a sunny beer garden).  The smell is malt; taste is malt and sweet. For a beer with 8.9% ABV It doesn't taste alcoholic, but does have a roasted coffee chocolate aftertaste with a smooth light mouthfeel.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,IronDjinn,4.53,"Alright, I get to round the reviews for this up to 300. I've been waiting to try one of these since I first found out about it in 1995 or '96. You see, as twisted as it sounds, I'm a big fan of Rasputin. Back in art college I had a 3 by 4 foot oil painting of him commisioned, and the painter did such a good job that those icy penetrating eyes follow you around the room, no matter where you are. I've read every bio, I'm your A-Z man when it comes to Rasputin, fact and fiction. I even popped Boney M into the CD player to write this review. It was a shame how he carried on...  Poured out of 12 oz stubbie type bottle, a pointilist ink rendering of an infamous portrait of Grigory Efimovich Rasputin. The body is impermeable to light, pitch black like a moonless Siberian midnight sky above a Gulag camp. A thick and creamy tan head crowns it, and later subsides to a thickish cap. A lattice-work of lacing left in it's way.  The aroma is comprised of roasted malt, coffee, dry dark chocolate, licorice root, fermented orange peel, and a sweet booziness, although not very overpowering. I can barely pick up a bit of lactose sweetness as well.  The first sip warms the heart and soothes the soul, I've been hypnotized from the start. Coffee and dry chocolate are apparent up front, followed by a base of roasted malt, boozy orange rind in the middle, with a dry semi-spicy finish of licorice and pepper. The alcohol can be tasted hiding beneath all of this, but does not detract.  This is a very luscious experience regarding the mouthfeel, the body is full and sensuous, it rolls smoothly over the tongue with the slightest alcohol kick on the aftertaste.  Highly drinkable stuff all year round, but I'd love to have a stock of this to soothe me in the winter time. I'm very impressed, the wait was worth it, but I want more now. Lucky are the people in Vancouver, where I had to go to pick some of this up here in Canada.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Crotor,4.3,"Old Rasputin comes out with a big and highly distinct wiff of slightly musty, gamey malt. Opaque black with a low, tan head and slight amber windowpanes, it has a first class appearance.  Rasputin is suprisingly dry and has an expertly balanced body for a beer this big, making for top drinkability. Hops are definately present, but only to the level necessary to compliment the malt. Sharp, roasty mocha and toffee flavors are in the forground here, backed by a restrained caramel sweetness. I can detect no fruit, though a touch of currant would not go awry.  Truly a masterful beer.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,PorterLambic,3.18,"Poured a very dark brown, with a dark tan head that reduced to a film. Good lacing. Smell was just hops and coffee. Taste was somewhat better, coffee, chocolate, malt, strong(!) alcohol. A decent balance but ... Mouthfeel was smooth, creamy, full-bodied but the aftertaste was a little bitter with alcohol obvious all over the place. Drinkability is alright but, because of the high octane, would only do it once in a while. Not a bad beer by any stretch, just not consumable often.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,orbitalr0x,4.72,"I'm sitting her drinking one right now and all I can says is, WOW. This is one of the best stouts I have ever had the pleasure of drinking outside of fresh from the tap at a brewpub. An incredibly flavorful mix of coffee, chocolate, hops and more. The smell is intoxicating and just begs for you to savor it. I'm very glad I found this brew and I will be getting more soon. Cheers to North Coast Brewing Co. for brewing an incredible stout. I definetely recommend anyone who enjoys stout to run out and try this now!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,sitbooboosit,4.23,appearance is a dark brown to black with brown head that foamed nicely at first with a few large bubbles developing. aroma is of dark roasted barley and hints of coffee. tastes very much a coffee with what seems to me a hint of dark fruits. an alcohol pepperiness is quite apparent. the beer finishes with the same peppery flavour that eases into a strong hoppy bite. very enjoyable.,North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,mobyfann,3.67,"Paid $1.99 for a 12oz. bottle...  The appearence on this defines the qualities of a good stout, almost black-like base, with a dark brown head, retains well, laces well, little carbonation going on... well done. I love the smell of this stout, dark chocolates, dark-roasted coffee, hints of caramel and a few other spices and candy flavors.  The taste was pretty good, giving up what the aroma gave off until the aftertaste kicks in, and then you taste alcohol, thus lowering it's drinkability to just average, the mouthfeel is a step above that, but that kind of goes with the style.  Final Thought: Storm King is 9.1%, this is 8.9%, same ballpark, but the alcohol in the taste ruins the total picture... still sticking with Victory for a Domestic Imperial Stout.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,jlervine,4.6,"Poured near perfect black with only very faint ruby brown tinges on the edges of the glass. Tan head formed, but sank quickly beneath the surface leaving a smattering of Belgian lace. Ring of foam stayed the course through the entire pint.  The aroma is chocolate malt, plums, raisins, alcohol, thick graininess. Kind of vinous, coffee and toffee notes come through as it gets closer to room temperature. And did I mention alcohol?  The taste is strong on roasted malt and chocolate, with a nutty character to it. Strong alcohol flavor. Balancing sweetness fights with the alcohol in the finish. As it warms, the alcohol leads the way, lightly burning the nostrils and numbing the tongue. Then the onslaught of thick dark malts slides over top of it and down your throat. Hops are there for the party, but are playing the part of wallflowers. Yeah, they are there and in great number, but they are watching the fight rather than being a truly active participant.  Carbonation tingles the tip of your tongue while the alcohol and roast grains wreak havoc on the roof of your mouth. Not quite as mouthcoating as other impys I've had, but it tries hard enough. When the beer warms further, the alcohol just numbs your mouth while the carbonation tickles it. The dark malts coat the palate while the hops and roasted grains do their part to squeegee it off again, ready for the next sip.  An absolute pleasure to drink - slowly.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Bruiser81,3.98,"Appearance is a solid black color with an extremely thick head. Very sticky beer. Tons of lacing. Aroma is dominated by dark malt. Little hints of dark chocolate accent the malt. The taste is powerful. Lots of malt with little bits of coffee, dark chocolate, and dark fruit. The finish is almost sweet, maybe a little like black licorice. Spice from the alcohol lingers throughout the whole beer. A very thick beer, almost chewy. Also very smooth. A little too big to drink more than one though.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,silenius,4.13,"Beer pours a dark brown/black with a crimson red where the light manages to peek through. The head is 2 fingers thick for a short time and then dissapates to a patina on the top. A substantial collar follows the beer as it retreats in the glass.  I only got some minor soy sauce, figs, molasses, and most of all fusel alcohol on the nose. Nothing big and nothing impressive.  Taste is bolder and bigger than the nose. First thing I taste is chocolate covered espresso beans dipped in grain alcohol with some spiced rum notes, molasses, figs, and it finishes with an espresso bitterness. Pretty good, but the alcohol taste detracts. My 4.5 is generous, but this beer ranks better than just under a 4.0, so I fudged a little.  Mouthfeel is a tiny prickle at first then a creaminess that ends with a drying note making me want to take another sip. The alcohol warmth makes me hesitate knowing that if I drink this too fast, I'll be whoo-ha'ed quickly.  Drinkability suffers from the very noticeable alcohol, but I'll definitely buy another.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,bigbeerdrinka,4.3,"Appearance: This beer pours with a nice thick dirty white head which grows to about an inch and laces the glass completely. The beer itself is a dark pitch black which no light can be seen through.  Smell: Dark roasted malts, minor caramel, a bit of cocoa and a medium alcohol presence are present in the nose.  Taste: A nice bittersweet chocolate flavor hits intially which follows with a nice roasty flavor from the dark malts. There's also a bit of a biscuit like flavor in the mix, and a bit of smoke which adds a nice complexion to the brew. This beer finishes with a strong warm alcohol sensation that warms the mouth, and a nice bitter hop finish that keeps things in check.  Mouthfeel: This brew is medium to light bodied with minimal carbonation.  Drinkability: Overall a very drinkable beer for such a strong alcohol tone towards the finish. Fits the style well and the malts help back up this beautiful beer.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,beertaster13,3.02,"Wow this review is going to be all over the board. Old Rasputin pours a black hole dark that is chilling to look at, very nocturnal. The tan thick mocha head is amazing, by far the best head I have seen in sometime, the lacing coats the glass, almost feels like it becomes the glass. The smell is amazing, mocha caramel and hints of dark ghiradelli chocolates. Picked up cinnamon and toasted marshmellow characters as well. The taste was very dry and weak, the roasted malts were bland and dry, alcohol was easy to pick up on, the bitterness outweighed the sweetness a little to much. A full bodied stout and very dry. Nice to look at and warming on those chilly days, but a true stout will make you crave it all times of the year, this was not one of them.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,mattcrill,4.5,Pours black with ruby edges and a tan lacing. This is a good looking stout. Smells of prominent carmel and roasted malts lead to my anticipation. Tastes malty and has a hint of dried fruit to finish. A nice balance of malts and sweetness. This is another beer that makes me sad when I get to the bottom of the glass. This is a fantastic beer.

Smell:  Smells like a winner with roast coffee dominating, a sweet malt backbone also makes its presence known, with a touch of smoke as well.  Taste/Mouthfeel:  Not as smooth and creamy as I would like, but the flavors pack a wallup. Alcohol is there and lets you know it, accompanied by an unsweetened coffee ice cream flavor. This one needs to cellar a little while. A bit harsh now, though with potential.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,meathookjones,3.99,"This was the first Imperial Stout I ever tried, had it a few years ago that turned me on to the style and havent had it since for some reason. So I decided to pick it up and see what I thought of it now. Pours an opaque black color with a decent tan head. Not much retention, but it does leave a bit of lacing. Aroma is brimming with dark chocolate and coffee flavors with a bit of sweetness in there as well. The flavor is a bit mild with chocolate and coffee being at the forefront and a bit of hop bitterness as well. The alcohol defiantly comes out the more this one warms. This has a full-bodied mouthfeel with light carbonation.

112,412,TastyTaste,4.7,"Completely black, except at the bottom of my glass where there is a brown glowing base through the murky beer. Big tan head that sticks to the sides of my glass in a cobweb pattern. Smells of bittersweet chocolate, espresso, raisins, and a tinge of alcohol. Flavor is just a kick to the teeth. Like drinking an extra strong cup of coffee, with a good amount of alcohol and hops bitterness thrown in for good measure. Very big beer, the best Imperial Stout I have had, tastes more like a stout than Sammy Smith's. I like this one, and would recommend it to any stout fan.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,marcobrau,3.51,"Poured into a small goblet with minimal foaming. Opaque in color. Aroma of espresso. Starts with intense coffee and chocolate flavors, then more chocolate, almost burnt chocolate until a long bitter finish laced with alcohol. Mouthfeel and body are almost similar to a fuller bodied wine such as a cabernet. The most memorable character of this beer is its profound bitterness in the finish. I've had this on tap before and I think I enjoyed more off a tap than out of the bottle. It went especially well with some Mississippi Mudcake. On its own, and out of the bottle, it comes across as a bitter strong stout and bit brash. Still, a damn fine stout.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Sammy,3.83,"Black with blonde head. Roasty, salt and bitter and high acid. In sip: Cinammon, rye bread, bittersweet chocolate, fruit,licorice. Could be less hoppy. Medium plus texture.

112,412,jahred,4.22,"Many thanks to beerluvr and BIF 6.0 for this bottle!  Pours a dark black color with a medium, dark tan head. The head disappears fairly quickly, leaving behind traces of tan foam on my glass. The scent is particularly strong. Burnt fruit, malts and alcohol.  The taste at first is surprisingly milky and rich, followed by a burnt malt taste, then more sweet milk flavors. As the beer warms, most of these goes away, leaving me with oily burnt malts, perhaps some chocolate, and what I might even call peanut butter flavors! Towards the end of the glass, I got some nice hop notes that finished off the beer wonderfully. Throughout I got the typical (and enjoyable) imperial stout tingles on my tongue.

The chocolate malts also dominate the taste, the wingers are some bitter hop and slight alcohol spice. Full creamy mouthfeel.

112,412,hobbes2112,4.06,"Finally getting around to reviewing this beer while it was in my hand.  Poured into a pint glass, no snifters were available.  Almost no head even with a slightly abusive pour. Black as they come in the glass, slight cola color around the top edges. Smell is of the roasted barley, coffee and anise.  The taste backs up the aroma, it is a very bitter and heavy. Sweet coffee with malt lead into a dry and bitter hop.  Not the easiest beer in the world to drink, but worth every sip.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Scent is initially hoppy and alcoholic, but chocolate malts are present too.  Initial taste has noticeable hoppy bitterness and alcohol.

112,412,andyo,4.27,"Wow...this is a great beer! I'm not too big on imperials (yet) as I don't particularly care for the high alcohol content. I had been eying this ber at my local supermarket for months. It seems as if the same 4-packs have been sitting onthe shelf for about 4 months, so, on a whim I talked to the manager and asked if she wouldn't mind breaking a 4-pack for me so I could ""sample"" this beer and see if I liked it. She was really cool, and said ""only for you"". Nice.  On to the beer-  This one poured jet black, and when held up to the light exposed the slightest hint of ruby red around the edges. The head was a nice gray pillowy delight. The aroma that came off of this beer was one of the sweetest smells I have ever experienced in a beer. it seriously smelled like hot cocoa. Mmm....too bad it was 87 degrees outside...hard to imagine hot cocoa in the midst of spring, but the smell of this beer took me back to the cold winters of my native Ohio. Oh yeah, the beer. Sorry. The taste of this beer was quite big! Nice and sticky in the mouthfeel, with a smooth chocalate, rum, and toffee flavors. Not roasty like other's I've tried. I thoroughly enjoyed holding this one in my mouth and experiencing the complexity of this brew. Slight alcohol taste which I could do without, but other than that, a stellar brew!  Looks like I need to go back to the market and pick up the other 3 I left behind!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,LuckySevens82,4.18,"12 oz stubby brown bottle with a b/w picture of the mad monk. Pours a deep brown, nearly black, with a light brown whisp of a head. Lacing, is however, very nice. Smell is roasted malts, chocolate and coffee (boy oh boy is it coffee). Very smooth, espresso, chocolate, caramel, and just a hint of alcohol. This beer is quite deceptive. At 9% abv, I would expect to taste more of the alcohol that is present. Nevertheless, the folks at North Coast have done a fantastic job hiding the alcohol. This makes the beer sneaky, perhaps not unlike the monk himself. This is a great beer, will definitely be added to my list of favorites (especially since it's now available in FL...yay!)",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,FranklinPCombs,3.41,"Appearance is a dark brown with ruby hints behind it. Head is less than a finger and recedes very quickly to a tiny layer of foam. The smell is chocolatey spice, but it is also very alcoholic too. Very little hops or malts are evident. The taste is actually very sweet, and it actually tastes like a less tasteful stout with a shot of whisky in it, adding a heavy alcoholic and sweet taste to it. Besides that there are some fruity tones to it, but I really cant get by that initial sweet alcoholicness. The mouthfeel is medium body with plenty of carbonation, which is fine. However, I find this beer tasting way too alcoholic to me.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,rajendra82,3.84,"Poured out of a stubby bottle with a picture of the Russian mystic on the label (I am assuming this is Rasputin, as I have never seen other pictures of him). When poured into my trusty goblet, the dark brown body is nearly completely opaque, but displays red highlights at the edges when held up against the light. The head is brown in color, massive in size (at least three inches), and has the consistency to stand up on its own above the rim of the glassware. This is one impressive looking beer indeed. The aroma is a mixture of medicinal alcohol, and powdered cocoa, and is relatively mild. The taste is like roasted cracked grain, bitter coffee, unsweetened dark chocolate, dark skinned dried fruits, and charred wood. Very pronounced hop bitterness and a very dry aftertaste are also present, as is the noticeable warming effect of the significant alcohol content. Mouthfeel is soft and soothing, but a bit thinner than what I anticipated. Very good representation of the style, but a bit less in your face than others like Victory Storm King Stout.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Suds,4.12,"Impenetrable, solid black color with a thin, lasting light brown head. Somewhat vinuous aroma, with heavy smells of coffee and chocolate. Taste is initially sweet: roasted and burnt malts. Very faint grain. Alcohol, which is hidden in the smell, comes forth in the mid-taste, and presents a pleasant warming.. Hop bitterness is strong and crisp. Finish is relatively dry. Soft and full mouthfeel. This is a very drinkable and complex beer. Theres a lot of interactive, well-balanced flavors in this beer. Its a pure treat.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,CarolinaCardinals,4.35,"Picked up two singles at AJ's recently. Thick, dark brown brew poured a very generous head that surprisingly did not leave much lacing. The wife who poured the 1st one commented that she had to hit the bottom of the bottle to get everything out a la catsup. Smells of toasted malts and coffee. The taste complexity is interesting as it starts of smooth but quickly is taken over by the toasted malts finishing with a seemingly higher than usual (for a stout) hop somewhat sweet finish. Nice full mouthfeel. A very enjoyable brew which I plan on enjoying again.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,CRJMellor,4.05,"Pours a midnight black with a tan head that generates spotty lace on the pint. Aroma has some vinous notes along with coffee, chocolate and mint. Flavor is chocolate chips, some minty hints and a roasted coffee finish. Mouthfeel is sweet chocolate to start, shifting to a roasted and bitter middle with a zinging, spicy kick on the finish. Drinkability is a little bit thin for an Impy Stout but very pleasant beer.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,SeanChouffe,4.02,"This is an intense beer. A deep dark red with a yellow/brown head. Sticky lace. The head dwindled quickly. Aroma is of hops, roasted malt and coffee.

A good Imperial Stout, however, it is not as well balanced as others in its class.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Leaves pretty lacing all the way in rings. Faint aroma, chocolate and alcohol, a hint of coffee. Light body, with low carbonation, ho-hum. Flavor is just on the sweet side, chocolate malts, with espresso emerging as it goes down smooth, finishing with a slight hop bitterness and alcohol. The body becomes more full as it warms. The head and lacing is still there.  Ol' Rasputin on the label is hypnotizing me and making my ratings go up... must... resist... Not as powerful as Brooklyn's Choco Stout or Victory Storm King, but a good, robust stout.  Great way to finish my taxes and welcome the Springtime.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Running4beer,4.42,"Pours out a dark black with a medium brown head that remains with you and your beer till the very last drop. Sweet malty chocolate roastiness and dark espresso was the combination in the aroma. Taste was similar chocolate, roasted malt, plums and espresso/really dark coffee. Very good stuff had a sweet flavor but not overly sweet, as it warmed it smoothed out and the flavors came out a little more. Easy drinking brew very little carbonation and a medium to full bodied texture. This is all good here.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,bditty187,4.27,"Almost pitch-black in hue, when I held the glass to the light I could notice hints of ruby around the edges. The beige head reached a lifeless finger in height before swiftly fading to a sparse soapy collar. The subsequent lacing was very minimal and hardly noteworthy. The appearance is average and thus disappointing. The potency of the nose is small, it is too calm for a beer this big and far too quiet for how warm I allowed it to get before I poured it, anyway, the bouquet does have lovely aromas of chocolate, dates, raisins, a slight hint of coffee beans but more so espresso, and a kiss of vinous liquor. I found the detectable aromas to be very pleasant and quite welcoming. I am impressed with the flavors on the palate, upfront is a roasted malt bitterness, coffee beans, espresso, and bark. In the middle these flavors wane and allow a softer, more rounded chocolate covered dark-fruit to surface; the brandy/sherry-like alcohol swallow these flavors. As the finish begins the piney, slightly citrusy hops emerge; the aftertaste is roasted and hoppy. This is a very nice beverage; the mad monk is damn tasty! It does seem a little sugary as it sits on my tongue but this seems to be more of a mouthfeel concern than a taste issue. Medium-full in body, low but natural carbonation, I like the mouthfeel, it is nothing special but full enough for the style. The big alcohol content is scarcely noticeable; it provides more flavor than anything else. This is a very good Imperial Stout, I know this is a broken record, but I wish this was available locally. If it were, Id drink it regularly. As is, I will sip and savor my lonely 12-ounce bottle that I purchased in Loveland.

There are chestnuts roasting on a open fire and then there are the grains that go into Old Rasputin roasting in the heart of a California wild fire. This brew looks and acts like a Storm King after the brewers at Victory have had a few too many. Intense espresso backbone with huge hops to back it all up. Astringent. An evolving beer, Old Rasputin moves into raw cocoa beans, licorice, rum-soaked raisins, a vat of fudge, and sweet fruit.  Parching finish. Fudge, fudge, fudge!  A domineering beer that, though complex, is tight and restrained from the focus on charcoal malt. The hop character is benchmark, however, and the warmth this beer puts on you reminds me of a Belgian quad.  Thanks to my friend Drew at The Corkscrew for the bottle.  Relax, relax. ng",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,99bottles,4.39,"Apperance: Old Rasputin pours a dark brown, not quite black color. It seems to be less viscous than some other Imerpial Stouts I've tried. Atop it billows a fluffy cream colored head that fades to an inch and a half of light tan peaks and valleys.  Smell: The smell of this beer is first bitter hops-- my requisite for a good imperial stout. The nose is very sweet, with mild roasted notes coming across through the hops. Nutty molassess.  Taste: My mouth is watering. Yum. Heavy roasted and black malts come through, with a Very astringent bitterness in the aftertaste. Hops are there in a big way, quite nicely balanced. Dry and fruity, like currants dipped in roofing tar. Maybe even too bitter for me. I was expecting more of a coffee/choco flavor, but this rolls right over it. Alcohol warmth bursts right through. At ""only"" 8.9%, I would expect better coverage.  Mouthfeel: Thick and malty, slick and sticky. The initial thinness of the beer and its light transparency have absolutely no bearing on the feel of this beer across your palette.  Drinkability: This is a good one, for sure. As with most things, I have others I would look to before this one. It is quite good, and quite roasty and bitter, if that's your thing. I could put back a couple, but it is a filling stout and the alcohol seems so much more strong than 8.9%.

Old R. kept staring out at me from my fridge and giving me the willies.. so I had to get rid of it..  This beer is quite dark, but doesn't seem as impenetrably black as other stouts. Thin mocha colored head, that dissipated quickly, but left thick lacing. You can smell the alchol on this one, along with a subtle smokiness from the roasted malt. Also a hint of coffee. The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy, which is one reason I love stouts. That along with the warming effect of the alcohol makes this one a good one to sip on a cold night. Wow, big flavor here. Initial tartness or sourness as it hits the tongue, then mellows a bit turning sweet, only to surge back with a big alcoholic hop finish.  A complex brew, but with a bit too much emphasis on the alcohol. It seems to dominate the other flavors to a point where the overall effect is compromised.

112,412,GreenWBush,4.51,"Old Rasputins' ghost emerges from the bottle with a better cascading action than Guinness (its the lack of nitro). Blacker than doom? Not exactly, you can see through ruby-colored glass if you try hard enough. Quite impressive is the head that is created, a dirty ivory that squirms like its alive. A fine sticky lace has formed even before the first sip.  Hmm, interesting aroma. Sweetness is the first thing I encounter, scrambled with dates, prunes, and malty alcohol. Roastiness abounds. Also, an unfortunate amount of metallic twinges.  An amazingly carbonated hoppiness greets you initially, then follows the gulpingly thick sweet mass of Stoutitude. The mouthfeel is right on, thick enough to back up the huge amounts of alcohol, but light enough to allow carbonation to cut through the mess. The hops aren't out of control on this one, but quite noticible for the style. Like many stouts, your mouth is left with puddles of sourness on the beers' way down, but in this case it cloaks the alcohol perfectly.  If someone handed this to me as a stout, I wouldn't instantly think ""imperial"" and would probably put down one too many. Read: VERY drinkable.

Aroma is assertively malty which shows as bubblegum, melon, milk and candy flavours. Hop profile is rather chalky, dry and alcohol is not particularly well hidden. Fruity palate with watermelon, pepper. This is a complex beer with a sweet side that I love, but I just can't get myself to appreciate this astringent, chalky and roasty sour hoppiness and very obvious alcohol.

Hints of dark chocolate and toasted nuts. You can smell some of the roasted bitterness for sure, though this is clearly not the hop monster many imperials are these days. Snappy bitterness is present throughout. But overtones of chocolate and vinous flavor swirl around atop the bitterness. The bitterness, of course, re-emerges at the finish supplemented by hops. I think this feels a bit thinner than it actually is for some reason. Quite easy and fun to drink for an imperial.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Smell is of caramel sweetened coffee sheathed in a tart bitterness with an aura of alcohol warmth.  Taste begins surprisingly sweet -- milk chocolate melted into a healthy dose of espresso. The middle opens with notes of roasted coffee beans, even some faint traces of licorice. The close is a delicious rub down of toasty bitterness and a distinct, yet not overpowering, alcohol buzz.  Barely any carbonation noticeable. Goes down like a melted milkshake.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Fluffy tan head stands atop with very nice lacings on the sides.  Smells of cinnamon, deeply roasted malts with that tinge of alcohol deep inside your nose. You sort of know what's coming your way... Cocoa, caramel and brown sugar linger about.  Tastes of chocolate, caramel and a light sour/acidicness. Nice, rounded flavors of roasted malts. Alcohol presents itself as a major player and comes through the dark roasted grains. Finished bitter with malty sweetness continuing on after swallowing.  Quite smooth in the mouth.

Pours absolutely dark. Could not get any light from a 75 watt bulb to shine through. Nice tan head. The head stays with nice lace. Nose is exceptional. Roasted malt, smoke, chocolate. The taste and mouthfeel are the real appeal here. This is creamy at first with a dark chocolate and dark caramel. The hop bitterness finish is really nice. This is a very complex beer.

I like the smell, sweet and smokey. The mouthfeel is quite silky while remaining quite syrupy as well. It's certainly heavy and the high alcohol content is obvious. I think the real treasure of the brew is the finish, in which you're hit with a smokey, cherry, and alcohol taste, in that order. This is a beer you have to sit back and enjoy.

It smells distinctly of cocoa, and I can't stress distinctly enough. I've never had a beer with the same smell. There's also some alcohol in the aroma. The taste was a little disappointing.

112,412,RasputinsRevenge,4.5,"Given my handle on BA, I figured I ought to review this fine beer.  I could not in good conscience give an all 5 rating for the simple fact that *nothing* is perfect and without room for improvement. But to be perfectly honest, I can not find anything wrong with this beer.  This pours a deep brown that under normal light appears black (opaque), held up to light though, you should see a nice reddish-brown tint at the bottom edges in particular.  The head is a somewhat thin layer of dark tan foam made up of larger sized bubbles (as opposed to say a tightly packed head of a Guinness Draught, for example). In the glass in front of me, the head eventually settles to a small desert island in the middle of a black sea - with a thin ring around the edge of the glass.  I have a hard time describing tastes and smells, but I'll try my best here. The aroma is a pleasant fruity, sweet smell, and I'm pretty sure I smell chocolate or even coffee in there too. The taste is about the same as the aroma, only with the taste of alcohol in there. But for a higher alcohol content beer, I'm still surprised as to how subtle it is. I have to agree with the last reviewer on the aftertaste, it has a bitterness to it that is not unlike coffee - so if you enjoy a cup of joe every so often, as I do, I would think you might enjoy this.  The mouthfeel is fairly unique - it's a sharp feeling, but it's not a bad or burning sensation. I would think it might have something to do with carbonation, but there is a relatively small head, so I'm honestly not sure on this one...  As for drinkability, this is a beer with a lot of flavor and body, so as long as I drink it slowly and deliberately, it's very drinkable.  Anyways, if you are a fan of darker beers, stouts, porters, etc, I would say poney up the cash and buy a 4-pack of this, you will not regret it. If you are not much into the style, I would say this is the king of (relatively) available Imperial Stouts (well, in my opinion, perhaps it shares that title with Samuel Smith's Imperial Stout), so why not sample the best of the style?",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,BitteBier,4.15,"Based on the ruby fringes (visible only with the lamp turned up to max), this seems to be a clear beer. That being said, this one is black enough to appear opaque. Topped off with a finger's worth of chocolate milk-like froth that reduces quickly to a thin but persistent and clingy layer of bronzy beige. Despite the ominous darkness, the smell is remarkably complex and pleasant. Roasted notes are lighter than expected and complemented very nicely by the scent of milk chocolate. Some bitterness up front followed by a creamy mouthfeel that succumbs again to the bitterness. A blast of alcohol warmth shows up and fades very slowly. As mentioned above, the mouthfeel is creamy, but it also maintains an astringency rather than the clingy fullness one might expect or desire from a potent stout. Roasted grains and chocolate are there as well, but again are balanced nicely by the assertive hops. This is more complex than I anticipated and is a nice change of pace among stouts.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Sweeter flavors too like prunes, Nice but not quite what the Samuel Smith's version is.  Mouthfeel is very good.

112,412,MobBarley,4.5,"This stunningly black beer pours with a slick thickness. A nice creamy tan head billows up but flees before I can really take it in. Moderate lacing in the glass. Aroma is all roasted malts and a slight alcholic tang. Notes of licorice and chicory are fleeting but round out the smell nicely. Taste is sublime, especially at cellar temperature. A bitter roastiness makes a quick entrance and sticks to the mouth throughout. There are interesting notes of strong, real maple syrup, horehound and something almost camphoracious. The finish is sweet and smooooth. A lovely hop bitterness with some mineral notes lingers. Mouthfeel is akin to cooled-down hot chocolate. Certainly not refreshing, but one hell of a smooth Imperial stout. A true ""meal-in-a-bottle"" beer. Drinkability is fantastic one one hand, because of the unique flavors and smooth feel. Conversely, the high ABV makes it a serious sipping beer, which is detrimental in my opinion.

I hated it but kept the bottle for my bottle collection with a big fat 0 out 10 on the back of the bottle. Yes I rated it back then. Recently, I have had quite a bit of Mr. Rasputin.  So right now it is about 25 degrees out. It has snowed about 6 inches today. I just got home from school and it took me about 45 minutes longer than it should have (snow) and I could hear Old Rasputin singing in my fridge even when I was driving home. He was speaking to me and we were communicating. We understand each other and love each other.  He poured pitch black with a large light brown head that stood very tall and proud. Within minutes, his the head faded but left a beautiful lace of where the head once stood. I love when beers do that and Old Rasputin knows I do.  Roasted coffee, bitter chocolate, crushed nuts topped with hard caramel, vanilla and lots of roasted malts in the nose.  Wow, Old Rasputin you taste great! Very well balanced and well hopped. Nice hop bitterness towards the finish and an onslaught of flavor just coats my entire mouth. This is the type of beer that will linger in my mouth for hours upon hours. Black licorice, roasted coffee, bitter chocolate, salt and more roasted malts were the dominant flavors. My only issue with Mr. Rasputin is that he seems a little thin in the mouth but he makes up for it in other ways.

For such a high alcohol beer this drinks very smoothly as well, though the mouthfeel isn't quite top of the imperials, but still plenty of coating to go around.

112,412,RockyTopHeel,4.37,"I've been waiting a long time to try this mystical Russian...  Poured a very, very dark brown with glints of ruby where light penetrated. Big aroma, with notes of bourbon, toffee, and about a hundred other things mixing beautifully. Rich, deep taste, where the warmth of alcohol sits atop an earthy blend of coffee, dark chocolate, subtle fruit sweetness, and a nice, bitter edge of hops.  Exceptionally compex and wonderfully warm. This is a very good beer.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,filabrazilia,3.85,"This beer pours a ""midnight without a moon"" black with a gorgeous brown head that settles into excellent lacing. A very nice looking beer.  I am struck by how much chocolate exists in the nose. This is like opening a box of fine imported chocolates and allowing the smells to embrace you as you anticipate the first taste. Toffe and carmel are present as well.  The taste, unfortunately does not match the aroma and is nowhere near as complex or as smooth as I anticipated. It is a tad bitter--I suppose from the roasted malts. There were some pronounced alcohol flavors as well. While not bad, I'm a little disappointed with it.  This is a medium bodied beer that is mildly carbonated and pleasant on the palate.  This is not nearly as drinkable as I'd like it to be. I think I will let the remaining beers age for a while before I try it again. The taste just didn't quite match the smell or the appearance. Hopefully time will give it some more character.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,CBFanWish,4.57,"Grigory Rasputin's ability to control Nicholas II while he was sleeping with his wife, made him one of mankinds darkest and most mysterious men in history. Like its namesake, Old Rasputin is truely dark and mysterious. As black as the heart of rasputin, himself. Atop was a thick, frothy dark tan head. A wonderful aroma, sweet with the slightest bitterness, of dark chocolate and rich coffee fills the air. Upon tasting, I am brought back to my childhood, biting into a chunk of chocolate, yet it is mixed with the more mature flavours of mocha and roasted coffee beans. Smooth and robust. Also has a prune finish. This is not a beer for the timid. It's strong, rich flavours can be overpowering, but wonderful at the same time. I would recomend this as a dessert beer. It would be perfectly paired with chocolate cake, cheesecake, molasses cookies or ginger snaps. One problem. I decided to review this as a porter other than a stout because it has qualities found in porters rather than stouts. I think it should be classified as an Imperial Porter.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,JamesBerry,2.88,"This one has a black cola-like coloring with a brownish/orange head. Immediately after opening the bottle, a strong chocolate smell emerges. The taste is intensely bitter, like baker's chocolate, but with noticeable amounts of alcoholic tone. Old Rasputin has a tannic mouthfeel, like sucking a teabag or coffee grounds. Not as creamy or as say, a porter or (non-Imperial) stout, but admittedly, the taste mellows out significantly after the first half. Not exactly what I'd call a session beer. This is more of an experience than just any beer.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Smell--Rich chocolate malt aroma; some burnt coffee  Taste--Predominately coffee, some caramel. Excellent hop ending that perfectly balances the powerful malt.  Mouthfeel--Warm oily texture; nice hop bitterness lingering after the swallow.  Drinkability--Very true to the style.

112,412,Foxman,4.33,"It pours a deep, dank, rich brown, almost, but not quite, black. There are opulent deep ruby highlights at the edges and udner the head. Speaking of head, it's quick and light brown, mottled in texture, and it soon fades to cirrus wisps of frothy vellum. There's spotty, rapidly dwindling lacing.  The aroma powers foward with dense, raw espresso currents, dark, bitter, and almost burnt. There is a deep roasted grain sweetness right behind. A dark chocolate essence pokes its head through intermittently. There are dusky earth tones at the finish, along with a poignant hops bitterness.  The tidal wave of dense flavor begins with an intense roasted and burnt maltiness backed by a black coffee bitterness. The malt delivers a fleeting but memorable earthen sweetness quickly upstaged by a second surge of bitterness, this time from the hops. There's a very distant, almost obscured, port character accompanied by the mouth-and-throat-warming glow of alcohol. Chocolate slips through late, giving way to an almost tongue-numbing dry hops bitterness that lingers just long enough to make its mark. Quite simply, the overall flavor is not especially complex, but it packs some serious testosterone.  It's thick bodied, oily and syrupy, not only coating, but providing a tangibly chewy texture on the palate. Roasted grain and hops bitterness charge the tongue and back of mouth with an almost electric tingle.  This is something the Russians obviously must not do half-assed, if this domestic offering is any gauge. This is thick, dark, full-bore flavor, never dancing, but rather plowing straight foward. The muli-layered bitterness is capably offset by a lesser but poignant underlying sweetness. The dense balance makes a grand impression, and despite the hefty ABV, more than one is virtually a certainty. I may not be a czar, but this down-to-earth elixir is welcome in my dacha anytime!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Hagbard,3.93,"Rasputin is famed for the difficulty his executioners faced when trying to kill him. He escaped death when being fed poisoned bread and reportedly, a point-blank gunshot wound; finally succumbing when drowned in the icy waters of Russia. Luckily for me, my bottle of Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout wasn't so hard to kill. (sorry for the horrible setup)  This beer poured black with a thin tan head that disappeared disappointingly quickly. Perhaps the glass wasn't pristine, who knows. When held up, light penetrated on each side and the top and bottom of the pint glass to form beautiful pockets of amber amidst the darkness. I'd have easily given appearance a 5.0 except for the thin, disappearing head.  It smells of roasted, burnt malt and chocolate espresso. It has a very powerful aroma...one of the strongest I've seen (or smelled). As the beer hits your toungue, you're assaulted by a malt presence. A very interesting burnt character moves in and settles in next to the malt. The chocolate espresso moves in towards the end. As you swallow, the alcohol makes itself known as it warms your belly. You are left with a nice malty aftertaste that has a touch of metallic in it. I could do without the metallic taste, but it's a minor quibble and by no means dominates. Though the alcohol does make itself known, as it should in an Imperial, it is still well hidden among the sweet malt and espresso. The mouthfeel seems a bit on the light side for the style, but the carbonation level was perfect.  I thoroughly enjoyed this offerering and I'm glad I bought 2. It lacks a little of the complexity of the Storm King, but it's a damn fine beer that can help warm you on frigid winter nights. It is easy to imagine yourself drinking a few of these in the royal Russian court listening to Rasputin spin tales.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Quite a lively mouth and tongue.. also the brew is much lighter on the mouth than it looks. Initial black malt taste gives way to a a dry cocoa powder and expresso finish. A slight touch of metalic tin and sweetness is left on the tip of the tongue as well. Quite a roasty treat, it is a great night cap beer.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Ieatlambfries,4.37,"A friend gave me a bottle of this as part of a Christmas gift, and boy am I glad. I had high hopes for this Imperial Stout based on what I've read about it and the fact that Imperial Stout is my favorite style of beer. I was not disappointed.  The appearance was great, dark brownish black. Very small tan head that dissipated quickly leaving a nice bit of lacing. It smelled of burnt coffee, toffee, chocolate and burnt molasses with a slight bit of alcohol in the background. The taste matched the notes of the smell. Very burnt coffee and chocolate/molasas. I also detected a weird soy sauce taste?!? Hard to explain but something reminded me of it, perhaps the molasses. There was also a bit of alcohol in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel was excellent, smooth, creamy, hearty. I'd like to drink this after a long day outside in the cold. The drinkability was excellent. I could drink a few of these. The only thing slowing me down is the high abv, but if you're at home and staying in, I guess it's no problem.  All in all this was an excellent example of an Imperial Stout. I would defiantly try it again, hopefully on tap.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,babyhobbes,4.52,"I had this on-tap this evening and it was just great!! It came with a nice thick light-brown head that died down slowly leaving a small creamy head for the entire glass. It smelled of coffee, chocolate and a little alcohol. It tastes smooth and is inline with it's smell. There was some bitterness that really stuck to the tongue and throat. It felt creamy and smooth in the mouth with a small bite of alcohol in the throat. I could drink a few of these at my local pub. I doubt if this will be on tap again very soon in my future. I will have to try the bottled version to find out if it as good.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Dmann,4.95,"This has to be the most easy to drink Imperial Stout I've ever had. It poured an almost opaque black with a awesome brown head that was so big I had to wait a few minutes for it to die down. The smell was of dark chocolate and hops. The taste was just about the same as the smell, with a perfect mix of coffee flavors in there. The thing I loved about this brew is that it was powerful but not overpowering. I could sit back and enjoy the whole 4 pack in one sitting, even though they are 8.9% a piece! Great beer!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Poured a wonderful dark opaque brown with a tan head that had patchy lace all over the sides of my brand new 3 phils chalice. Smell was very sweet with huge molassas and brown sugar and some figish ester notes. Smelled similar to the brooklyn black chocolate. The taste was very dry and chalky with a slight metallic twang and bitter chocolate notes. There was little hops present, which surprised me coming from a west coast creation. Aftertaste left a sweet, dry red wine effect and a distinct roasted grain taste. Very minimal carbonation with small bubbles here and there. I would like to try a vertical to see how well this holds up. Not a bad Imperial, but I have had much better.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

The smell of chocolate, starts wafting as soon as I crack the bottle. In the glass I get a lot of deep dark toasted malt.  The taste is incredible. Big waves of coffee, burnt malt, dark malt, licorice, and fig crash down on my tounge. The alcohol is well hidden and the finish is slightly dry. Just an incredible big, thick, chewy stout.

Smelled very nutty, almost reminiscent of some porters I've had. Malts hit the nose right away. Nice sweet taste, the alcohol is present. However the nice coffee taste covers it up nicely.

The taste followed the smell with a roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate flavor. Bitterness and high alcohol was also noticable. Medium-heavy bodied beer.  The mouthfeel was somewhat dry, smooth, and creamy. The coffee, slight bitterness, and chocolate last on the tongue long into the aftertaste.

A reddish African Mahogany brown color in my tasting glass. A meager nose- the dry alcohol is the most notable element followed by the bitter tones of hops surrounded by slight sprinkles of malt.  This beer had wonderful heavy long lasting flavor, but light bodied. The ""carbonization"" helps produce a tart feel on my palate with a bitter stance of hops then bounded by definite malt notes. If I were blindfolded I'd declare this beer a Russian Imperial Stout.  Long finish that dissipates with its dry alcohol character as the ending cadence. The living finish cleansed my palate and left my taste buds yearning for the next sip.   In my opinion, this is beer third to the A.Lee Coq 2001. Doesn't have the flavor complexity of the A.Lee Coq 2001 nor the body / and overall mouthfeel.

This is certainly a complex beer with a strong coffee and chocolate bitterness. The appearance is nearly black, a slight tinge of dark red is visible when held up to the light. The smell is potent and prepares the drinker for the flavor to come. This is definitely a well crafted beer that is full of flavor. However, I marked it down in some areas mainly because of personal tastes. I found it somewhat difficult to drink because of the strong almost burning presence of the alcohol. I have had other high alcohol beers before and not been put off by the alcohol, I am not sure why I was by this one. Overall it is definitely worth a try.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

The smell is chocolate and coffee as well as some of the alcohol coming through. The alcohol kind of hits you right away with this one. It leaves in the middle and then comes back for that warming feeling in the end. The beginning is coffee and chocolate. The middle is where the bitterness comes in. Nice! The ending is more coffee and alcohol than anything to me.  I recently purchased this four pack so I am assuming it is pretty fresh. Doesn't appear to be bottle conditioned but I think that I will cellar the other 3 for awhile. Just to see how they do.,North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Pilsner, which in size may be appropriate, but I would prefer a beefy pint glass.  This beer pours well, and ends up with a nice tan head over a black body. Some residual cascade is attractive, and the head hangs around for a little while. A sniff reveals malty chocolate notes with a little coffee. The taste is the same, with some hops and a little crisper than expected. Finish is malty again with a slight alcohol warm. After a couple it will sneak up on you. Overall body is not too heavy, and it has a good mouthfeel.  Among my favorite beers by North Coast, brewed an hours drive from my town back home.

Nice balance of roasted malts, hops, and an essence of prunes that jumps into the mix somehow. Slightly bitter hoppy aftertaste.  I'm new to imperial stouts, but this one is very drinkable.

Thick, typical stout head, cratered and foamy like a root beer float, with excellent lacing.  But, thin and slightly gritty in the mouth. Not thick and chewy enough to be Imperial, I don't think. Taste is burning cocoa and chocolate, sour on the edge, but a wash of sweetness overall.  Not a bad stout, but lacks the fullness and breadth to be an imperial. An excellent stout overall, and many no doubt will overlook the thinness in deference to its amazing sweetness.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

The smell is one of the most enticing I've ever encountered, and the taste follows up with gusto. So many of the imperial stouts I've had have been sweet almost to the point of nausea but nay, Rasputin was a hardier fellow. Poisoned, shot, beaten, and drowned, he lives.  ...In a bottle.

Not for the faint of heart.  Taste is not too different than the taste would lead you think. The alcohol is perhaps a little more obvious than I'd like it too be, but considering the freakishly high ABV on this one, it's impressive how much it's been minimized.

The smell was malty with some alcohol hints, but it was a different kind of malt, not only sweet but with a smoothness that I haven't encountered before. Poured a jet black with a nice chunky head that laced nicely. I'm not an expert, but I can sense something complex going on with this brew...sweetness,,,chocolate..coffee...alcohol, but blended so beautifully, it was a rare pleasure.  I'm not a strong brew fan, but the mouthfeel was equally impressive for its strength. True, it's a sipper, but warm and full-bodied. For what it is, very drinkable for the high abv.

Pours with zero carbonation, and not as thick as expected. No head retention and has a dark brown body. Held to the light it has a ruby glow to it. Nice chocolatey aroma with notes of sweet candy and hops. Flavor follows in kind. Bitter dark chocolate gives way to a nice roasted malt flavor, followed by a crisp hop finish.

Guess they saw the light on this one.  Pours thick & black with some ruby highlights when held up to the light. Nice frothy tan head that gave the ""waterfall"" effect upon pouring. Aroma is strong in the malt department. Very sweet, yet there are some hops to calm things down a bit. An alcohol bite clears up the sinuses. This is one beer that's full of taste. Starts off with a deep sweet maltiness, followed by some hop bitterness fighting back, ending with a nice roasted malt aftertaste. There is some fruitiness in there all the while just trying to make things even more interesting. Decent carbonation that gives way to a nice slick mouthfeel, with a quite sticky aftertaste.

Quite thick, though not overly so. Strong malt presence, definite roast malt character as well. This beer is like chewing on a roast malt kernel, it has the same after taste and everything. Even though thick and malty the roast character lets this beer finish like it is quite dry. There is a bit of oiliness in this beer. The beer is very smooth, yet still carbonated. Almost a cola not to this as it first hits my mouth.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,HossMcGraw,4.51,"This is a great Imperial. The head is surprisingly huge. Very dark brown color. Not much aroma detected. The taste is very similar to Storm King, only not as cloying.

In summation, better than Storm King, not as good as Willy Shakes.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Dantes,4.42,"Package: 12oz. crowned brown bottle, labeled 8.9% ABV; no date information. Black and gold label with a forbidding portrait of a greeting or saluting Rasputin. Russian inscription I can sound out but not translate.  Cost: $5.49 a 4-Pack at Total Wines  Presentation: Imperial Pint glass at ~50º  Appearance: Opaque, but of a slightly lighter brown than the typical imperial stout. More like a bittersweet chocolate than ebony. Copious gunsmoke on opening. Generated a medium-dense one-finger cocoa head, which resolved into a patchy slick.  Smell: This exhibited a deep, rich, roasted malt aroma, with some coffee and chocolate notes. Surprisingly subdued hops.  Taste: Good first impression. A bit sweeter than I expected, with lots of different sensations happening at once: coffee, bittersweet chocolate, nuts, malty sweetness, and just enough hops to keep it interesting but not so as to be intrusive. Much less espresso&#8211;like than the Storm King. More like a Sam Smith&#8217;s. As it warmed, the more fruity elements came to the fore, with currants, prunes, and some gentle eau-de-vie warmth. Medium finish despite the relatively light body.  Mouthfeel: This was somewhat roughly carbonated and not as thick or creamy as I expected. Certainly doesn&#8217;t have the viscosity of an Expedition or Sam Smith&#8217;s, but the flavor makes up for a lot. Similar in body to a Storm King, but with better balance.  Drinkability: Very drinkable for an imperial stout. The relatively light body allows for an extra one, and it has a nice balance of flavors (not too hoppy, not too espresso-like). Alcohol is unobtrusive.  Backwash: I have to say that I enjoyed this MUCH more than the Storm King. I found that it had better balance, allowing the perception of many different flavors. It has all of the flavor and is smoother. Perhaps the Storm King is a beer better sampled after aging (I have some from last year for comparison), while this is ready to go now. The lighter body and slight sweetness remind me of Perkuno's Hammer. I&#8217;d love to try some of the Millennium Edition, as it is described as being very thick. Unfortunately, I passed on the one bottle of it that I saw.

Appearance: Pours deep viscous black toned deep purple ruby highlights full tan two finger sized head perfect looking beer, oh so nice with perfect evenly laced foam. Aroma: Deep cocoa, espresso infused, undertones of alcohol infused fruit along with a great bready sweet malt tone this is one awesome imperial stout in my opinion it sets the bar. Taste: Wow complex swirling spiral of flavor alcohol infused fruit, doses of hardcore strong coffee notes, and dark chocolate playing the tie the flavors together predominantly bitter from the dark roasts there are some hops evident in the flavor. Creamy balanced mix of so many flavors works so well, gotta love the Ol' Raspy. Mouthfeel: Full bodied syrupy goodness of massive flavors this is one extraordinary beer, a must try. Drinkability: No questions as to it's placement on the top 50 beer list, this one does it so well remaining amazingly drinkable and flavorful is the key for an Imperial stout not cloying in anyway and you yearn for another one the glass is empty that's what it's all about.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,pio,4.42,"damn near opaque beer with just a tint of amber around the edges. the tan and amber head was strong and stout leaving a very impressive lace. scents of caramel, toffee, espresso, pumpernickel, rye and a half dozen roses.balanced scents, also the alcohol is evident and warming. a sweet start of caramel, coffee, espresso, molasses, a dark bready malt that brings a roasty sweetness before it dries up and gets a warm bitter, similiar to a cafe au lait. the mouthfeel was so creamy and rich, just a few bubbles making it so silky and oh how nice. what a hearty beer.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,JMH_,3.61,"this is one of the oddest reviews i'm probably ever gonna have to make, with my ratings all over the map, pretty much. this brew is made exceptionally well. it looks damn near perfect, with a dark as night pour and an awesome tan head that provides an equally awesome cascading effect. so far, a damn near perfect beer. smells of coffee, chocolate, roatsed malt with hints of fruitiness (raisins, perhaps?). nothing that blew me out of the water, but a good, solid smell nonetheless. the taste, while obviously appealing to most drinkers, just wasn't for me. i don't like coffee to begin withm and the coffee taste here simply overpowered all other tastes too much. the other dominant flavour here was the alcohol, which was surprising since the smell gave hardly any indication of, and at 8.9%, i figured it'd be all over the place with this one. it's a generally smooth brew overall, but i can't say that i'd be able to have any more than one at a time, and would probably only try this again on a rare occasion. i was surprisingly disappointed here...like i said, a well made brew, just not my cup of tea (or coffee, in this case).",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Quaffer,4.33,"Appearance: A very cool looking label, complete with some Russian text and a picture of the mad monk himself. This beer poured a deep black that showed its true, ruby nature when held up to the light. The tan head rose up big and rough, but smoothed out and became dense as it settled back down. It was very slow to dissipate and never completely disappeared, leaving a thick cap of foam floating on top of the obsidian liquid. There was no lace left on the glass. Overall, I was surprised at the amount of head and its retention qualities. Many imperial stouts don't ""behave"" this way.  Smell: The main aromas were exactly what I expected: coffee, chocolate, and cream. After the head had settled down, a underlying toasted aroma emerged that contained hints of cinnamon and allspice. Very strange, but not bad at all. Also, there were hints of plums and cherries. There was no alcohol present on the nose, which surprised me since this beer tops out at almost 9.0%.  Mouthfeel: I half to say that this beer breaks into the full-bodied catagory, something that I rarely run into. It was very full in the mouth with a nice, creamy, slightly fuzzy, texture to it. There was a great smoothness that gave way to a numbing tingle caused by the alcohol.  Taste: On my first drink I was assaulted by a myriad of flavors. They were so numerous and intense that I had troubled picking them out. After my pallet had acclimated itself, I became aware of flavors of dark coffee, deep roasted malts, alcohol, and a tart cherry fruitiness. On the aftertaste was a lingering bitterness that was the only evidence of hops that I could find in the flavor. As the beer got really warm, the aforementioned alcohol gained some spicy characteristics and became more pronounced.  This is a helluva beer. A great change of pace from the wussy beers that I have been drinking lately. Too bad this stuff isn't available here in Wichita.  Thanks Bruiser!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Sudmissle,4.7,"A great stout that probably is the flagship brew of North Coast Brewery. Pours a black/brown color with a dense foamy head reminding me of real whipped cream stirred in. Very thick mouthfeel that lingers on the palate. This beer has 8.9% alcohol, but it is not apparent in the taste because it is so smooth. The alcohol is only slightly noticeable in the aftertaste. A quality blend of toasted wheat bread and coffee notes with a lace that clings to the glass as well as the tongue. This is a very competitive stout overall.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,winomark,4.18,"Appearance: Black, with little or no light seeping through the glass. Dark and inviting.  Smell: Freshly brewed coffee, vanilla and molasses. No overpowering alcohol smell, nice and maltly.  Taste: Coffee all over the palate, with some nice malty sweetness. Slight alcohol taste in the finish.  Mouthfeel: Quite rich and coating, but not cloying by any means.  Drinkablilty: Not something you can sit down and drink a few of at a time, but overall, a very enjoyable beer to be savored while watching football on a cool autumn day. I will seek this beer out again, and enjoy it as often as possible.  P.S. I am glad this was such a great beer that I made it my first review.

112,412,Boilermaker88,3.18,"Presented in a 12oz. brown bottle as pictured. This beer allows no light to penetrate its inky black depths. A short-lived mocha colored head rose and fell as quickly as Italy changes governments, leaving minor lace behind. The aroma is a withering blend of bitter coffee grounds, alcohol, roasted black malt, wet leather, and dark fruit. This brew has a pronounced bitterness to it, far more than I expected. There are hints of bakers chocolate and coffee mixed with some prune/date flavors but the overall effect is rather out of balance. An astringent alcohol taste fires a parting shot along with a mild warmth. Feel is medium with a real rawness from the alcohol. Well, if this is what Rasputin was drinking the night he was killed, it explains why he was so difficult to take down. Old Rasputin has a rugged, hard edge to it that cuts into its drinkability.

The taste is just as fantastic...the predominant taste of coffee mixes with a nutty flavor as well as the licorice/anise taste. Mouthfeel is very smooth. As for drinkability, I couldn't drink as many of these as I would want to!  Mmmm...imperial stout...truly one of the great treats of the beer world. Though I sadly don't get to enjoy its unique pleasures enough, when I do it's a treat to be savored.

112,412,slitherySOB,4.44,"Thanks too Brent, I was finally able to consume this long sought after beverage. Just the look through the bottle let you knew, this is a beer not to be reckoned with. The old picture of the monk himself teases, just teases you to try and dare consume this liquid concoction. The beer pours a very dark black. The only thing blacker than this liquid is my ex girlfriend's heart. When held too the light, this beer shows a shimmer of blood ruby. Only problem in presentation? Next to no head. Just a little film of bubbles, which does last throughout drinking. Scent, oh the scent. The nostrils are kicked in the sinuses with roasted malts, dark chocolate, arabica coffee beans, bitter hops, raisins, plums, prunes, red grapes, and various spices from around the world. One could write an essay on the olfactory pleasure of this beer. Taste is very damn similar too smell, though hops were stronger in the tongue than on the nose. This is actually very hoppy tasting. Like an IPA turned stout. But that roast malt is still their, ever so powering, ever so warm. Coffee and chocolate entwine together in this erotic dance that would leave any man's scrotum with a case of rigomortis. The fruits act as a sweet song, which the coffee and chocolate dance too. Spices are the final touch, the decorations on the ballroom walls. Just beautiful, damn beautiful. The mouthfeel is hard too explain. It's strong, but neither thick nor syrupy. Though this is not flattering to the brew at all, it's like gasoline. Gasoline is like oil, both are fuel, but oil is thick and gasoline is not. I shall definitely be drinking this again, if I can find it again. A beer meant to be enjoyed like an old port or hand crafted cigar. Any more than one at a sitting is simply too much of a good thing.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,clvand0,1.91,"Usually I'm not a fan of Imperial Stouts, but this one looked cool and I was hooked into buying it for the looks and name. Pours a very dark color with a moderate sized tan head that dies off after a few minutes. Leaves a little lacing on the glass. The aroma was burned malts and coffee/chocolate and some sort of spiciness (odd for an imperial stout?). This is a big beer. The flavor was majorly strong. Way too strong for my taste buds to accept. Tastes of alcohol, burned malts, slight spiciness, and maybe a little fruitiness. Didn't care much for it.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

I'm crazy about imperial stouts and I read the praise everyone has for this beer, but I can't help but think that I'm unlucky enough to keep purchasing skunked beer upon skunked beer.  Sharper than other imperial stouts, spicer and hoppier than I would prefer. Acrid taste, almost far too sharp to be palatable. Sample has drain pour written all over it, but I've bought this beer three different times during the past year with the same experience.

I had this one immediately after Stone's Imperial, and thought this one was at least as good, if not better. Jet black appearance, pretty much on par with other top imperials I've had. A very strong aroma consisting mainly of alcohol and burnt coffee. Tasted pretty much just as it smelled, and was a nice combination of the two (alcohol and coffee).

112,412,PZuke,3.9,A nice black Imperial stout body with a slightly tan head. It smelled like coffee and a little bit of chocolate.

My wife said it smells like a Swiss candy bar. Bold and aggressive flavors of dark roasted coffee, dark chocolate and aged port. Nice finish with a strong mochaccino aftertaste. Thick and rich palate. This beer becomes increasingly bitter as the flavors build and is a long, slow, and pleasing sipper. Strongest elements are of espresso and port.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Brown sugar, molases, dark malts, alcohol. It was actually a little tricky to make out, not as prominant as I expected.  The taste was a very meaty full bodied. Very fine high level of carbonation. A very sharp initial roasted barley bitterness started it off. It was almost metallic. Burnt chocolate, unsweetened chocolate. Coffee beans. An intense coffee/espresso bean type bitterness. The sort of bitterness you get when chomping on dry espresso beans all day. Or like overly bitter black coffee. Some nice earthy hop flavors. But mostly just the intense coffee flavor and bitterness.  This beer ended bitter, but a bit more subdued. It deffinatly took it's time to fade.  Overall it's not a bad beer by any means. A classic Russian Imperial Stout. Extremely drinkable. But just a little too much of the coffee bitterness for me.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

The aroma is intriging with bubblegum like esters and tons of alcohol with a bit of chocolate and a piney hop character. Flavor is intense with a slightly metallic chocolate and roasted barley malt profile accompanied by a strong pine hop flavor with a sweet finish. Has tons of alcohol and this definetly adds to the body by increasing the length of time the flafors linger.

The head is mostly brown with slight white hues. A tall head with some lacing. The scent is strong coffee bean with some chocolate and a burnt toast quality at the end of the smells. A great nose.  The flavors are complex. A heavy coffee taste. Very coffee bean. The burnt toast quality is there but the chocolate that was apparent in the nose is overwhelmed and has disappeared. A very rich flavor that stays for a while. The aftertaste lingers just a bit too long.  It feels heavy and strong in the mouth. Nice bite for a stout. This stout pushes the limits in my opinion. The only negative is a bit of an alcohol bite to it. This stout will definately find its way in to my fridge. I am also happy to report that there is no sweetness attributed to the after taste as many stouts have. Some stout drinkers like a sweetness ending I do not.  A very well thoughout stout. I just cannot say enough about it.,North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Aroma was toasted grains with chocolate and coffee along with some alcohol hiding in the background. The taste started with plenty of sweet malt up front and then moved to roasted and black malt flavors. This was followed by flavors of coffee, chocolate, and some dried fruit flavors blending with the roasted malt flavors and just a wee hint of hop bitterness. The finish was very smooth with the caramel and chocolate flavors coming to the fore front. Aftertaste was a mix of all of the above and a much more noticeable alcohol taste. Mouthfeel was smooth and creamy with a full body and an alcohol warmth to it. Overall a very complex stout that leaves you with a smile and a glow.

Dark color but not as dark as expedition and with a little more head on it. The aroma seemed faded and it was not extremely thick which was it's only downfall. Other than that this was a very complex brew. Had a definite licorice taste to it and very apparent hop bitterness. A coffee taste was there and it was of strongly burnt coffee at that.

Aroma is extremely rich...roasted sharp grain, similar in ilk to Kalamazoo stout, espresso, black patent, and a nice touch of whiskey. There is a peculiar woody dryness to the aroma. Taste is phenomenal..this is especially silken and roasted, but not burnt and thin, with a very smooth and even hoppiness. The mouthfeel is full and chewy with a dense body. Bitterness and hop flavor are in perfect balance with the malts. Carbonation is mild to moderate. The alcohol is noted in vapor, but not so in taste.

The dark tan head was quite active and lasted several minutes as I allowed the beer to warm before tasting.  Man, I could tell by the aroma that this was going to be a kick in the nuts...again, compliment or insult? I dunno. The beer smelled like a cookout. Just replace the steak with malt and you got it. ""One malt burger! Well done!"" This beer is like roasted malt incranate.  OK, now, the taste. BAM! Down on the floor I go! In reality, I don't remember much from the first taste. It was so overwhelming, I had to gather my thoughts...including, do I really like this or not? I decided to walk away for a few minutes to gather myself and return. I'm glad I did.  After a few more sips, this beer is beginning to grow on me. The flavor is overwhelming. Espresso, a hint of chocolate, alcohol in the distance (which would be pretty dangerous for a beer with a 8.9% ABV but you can't chug this!) and a bitter finish. This is a beer that kicks your ass, follows you home and sleeps with your wife.  The mouthfeel is very good...creamy and chewy...like coffee taffy. The beer is actually easily sipped (I wanted to say drinkable but it's too harsh for a gulp) after a few minutes. However, the drinkability is pretty low for me given the strength of this bad boy.

112,412,brewdlyhooked13,4,"I tried to pour this one roughly but nothing doing. While the minimal tan head reduced to a mere crown on the glass very quickly, it does manage to maintain that crown quite well. Color is as dark as it gets I suppose, absolutely no light going through.  Aroma is heavy with coffee and light with alcohol notes.  Taste has a big alcohol hit in front I thought, almost too soon. The mouthfeel comes into play immediately as well, extremely smooth, heavy, thick almost like syrup, but not sweet, oh no, not at all. Past the alcohol taste comes the primary taste sensations of coffee and dark roasted malts. These mix with a mild carbonation which enhances the roasted taste, IMO. As that initial flavor surge subsides, some smoky, perhaps burnt coffee or espresso flavors emerge coupled with a hop bite to keep you honest. All that complex flavor and some nice balanced hop presence to boot. Finishes on the bitter side with remnants of charcoal lingering.  I gotta hand it to North Coast BC, this is a busy beer to drink, lots going on if you take the time to experience it.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,tavernjef,4.65,"Solid black, black as a moonless night....one finger high head of super lumpy, solid crunchy top, but also looks fluffy and light, tan in color, leaves some spotty lace patches. Smell, dead on, is a great sweet dark chocolatey aroma with notes of dark fruit - banana, starfruit, mango, strawberry, and black cherry all noted. Taste is a swirling light chocolate, sweet and dark smoothness throughout, yum. Nice twinged hops in the finish that brings out just the right bitterness and dryness to say hello kindly and leave you with a smile. Feel is full and creamy with a way easy smoothness that makes this a amazingly drinkable stout. North Coast has a winner here.  Thanks to Feloniousmonk for serving this up. YUM!!!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,darklager,4.31,"This beer is definitely something to behold. It pours beautifully with a nice head that sticks around for a while. The aroma is chocolate and alcohol. While the alcohol is present in the aroma, it is well masked in the taste. It is a strong brew, worthy of drinking slow and savoring every last drop. It finishes slightly bitter, and the strength of this beer is pretty great, so I don't think I'd want more than a couple at one sitting. It would be great in the evening to sip on while unwinding.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Winter,4.31,"Pours soot black in color with a rising brown creamy head. Aroma consists of chocolate malt, alcohol and dark fruit. Luscious full-bodied mouthfeel. Taste consists of chocolate malt and coffee. Very well balanced. Alcohol makes its presence known in the finish and a slight warming effect can be felt. Finish can be a bit dry at times.  Old Rasputin definitely has quite a kick to it. Unbelievably smooth for a beer with such a high alcohol content. Definitely a benchmark Imperial Stout to judge others by.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,BierReise,3.9,When I first opened the bottle I took a little sniff. My first impression was chocolate and alcohol. Almost like a chocolate cordial. Dark chocolatey appearance small head that started to dissolve immediately. First sip was roasty tasting with bitter chocolate notes at the back. Wow this is a smooth Stout. A little on the bitter side but malt is seeming to wrestle for advantage. It's warming up now and I start to smell coffee or espresso. This is a great stout and deserving of it's wide praise. If it weren't for the bitterness I'd give it an even higher rating. Just my opinion.,North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,AtLagerHeads,4.15,"Wow! This is a really grand stout. Wanting to finally taste this bad boy, I popped the cap on its stubby little bottle. Immediately the nose of roasted aromas comes forth, beckoning me onward. The nose portends the roasted coffee and chocolate flavors that await the drinker. The pour created a huge dark beige head over an opaque black body. The head lasts and makes lots of nice lacing. Beautiful. Flavor is here in abundance giving the drinker a full force assault on the palate. Coffee. Check. Chocolate. Check. Prunes. Check. Hop bitterness. Check. This is a tour in flavors. Great stuff with great body and feel. Wow! High ABV holds down drinkability, and there's lots of bite in this brew.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,bewareOFpenguin,4.5,"I actually drank this at room temperature, not waiting for it to chill. It poured nice and blackish, with chocolate colored bubbles. The taste was roasted malt, coffee, carmel. It had a bold taste, the ABV mixed well, not overwhelming. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,BeerResearcher,3.9,"This Russian Imperial Stout is dark/rich tar in color with a nice tan head. The lace cascades down in spotty trails. The aroma is a multi-directional bombardment of coffee mocha, malt, hops and alcohol. The ample citrus and metallic hops are almost overwhelming. A hint of apples and sherry-like flavors weave in and out as does coffee & chocolate. Sweet! Strongly alcoholic and complex. Almost too much at once with little thought to balance...maybe that was the intention to begin with?",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,MJR,4.12,"Appearance: Pours black with garnet highlights. It's mostly opaque, with a minimal amount of light getting through. What started as a 3/8"" tan cap is now a small ring around the top of the glass. No lacing whatsoever...  Smell: Very basic aroma of bitter, roasted coffee with a hint of dark fruits. A small whiff of alcohol too...  Taste: Lots of roasted grain and coffee flavors take center stage is this brew. The dark fruits that are expected in this style are here, but they're much more subdued than in most other Imperials. I taste a touch of buttery rum, as well as some toffee. The hops are there, but they don't really draw any attention away from the malts. The alcohol is well hidden. Finishes with a touch of sweetness.  Mouthfeel: Round and smooth with a medium mouthfeel. It's too thin for the style...  Drinkability: Good for what it is...a nice, basic Imperial stout. There are much better examples to be had, but I wouldn't mind this on a cold winter night in front of the fireplace. I did expect this one to be better though...",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,dwarbi,4.54,"1/2 inch thick light brown head. Most of it goes a away rather quickly, but some remains to make me happy. What a nose! Amazing. Very solid presence in the room. Malty, a little sweet, and when you get in there, you can detect the high alcohol content, but it does take away from the effect. Chocolatey, roasted flavor. Again, the high alcohol content is evident but does not take away from the experience. Feels good in the mouth, but the sweetness is a little too dominant in the aftertaste.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,philipt,4.32,"My goodness, I really like all types of imperial stouts, and the more I sample, I develop a greater appreciation for the style.  Nearly black in color (really dark, dark, dark, dark amber) with a rather diminutive khaki color head. Sensational aroma that is noticeable from a relatively great distance as it is poured. Smells of roasted malt, and smells quite sweet. Taste is malty as first, followed by a bready and roasted malt flavor. Tastes somewhat sweet as well. The body is thinner than hoped for. The alcohol is evident but, by no means, is it a problem.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,scottum,4.21,"Pours out blackish black with a nice big tan head. A very nice Imperial Stout. Burnt malts rule this brew like a tzar. Hop bitter balances out the malts.

112,412,kelticblood,3.59,This is my 100th review so I thought I'd choose something worth remembering.  The pour yielded a 1 inch off-white head that reduced to about a 1/2 inch and stayed.As It reduced it left a solid ban of sticky lace around my glass.The color is an opaque black.Alcohol is evident on the nose and in the taste almost right away.wheeew this is strong.Long very bitter finish.Full bodied with a thick mouthfeel.Alcohol makes the mouthfeel somewhat harsh..The alcohol and the strong hop bitterness seems to hide any real flavor here.Very creamy with a rolling texture.Hints of chocolate and coffee are noted on the taste.Very malty with a dry finish.,North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,PhantomVodoo,4.28,"Black in color with a brown creamy head that leaves lace. Aroma of bittersweet chocolate and alcohol.  Taste of bittersweet chocolate, alcohol, and a hint of coffee. Hops there to balance.  Creamy and full-bodied. Drinkability: This is a big beer to be savored in the proper setting. Not something to look for after you've just mowed the lawn on a 90 degree day. The alcohol is pretty evident.  Overall, this beer is quite the treat on tap. Very enjoyable.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Jarod,4.57,"12 oz bottle, Russian writing encircling the image of Rasputin on the label.  This beer poured a dark brown black color that when held to the light, some penetrated casting a ruby glow on the edges. The head was thick, rich and creamy resembling in all aspects, even the color of the inside of a Milky Way candy bar. It left a lace behind that was sheety and lacey in different spots of the inside of the glass. The aromas that came from the glass were fairly complex, changing with each degree of temperature. I nosed coffee, dark and roasted malts, caramel, chocolates, slight fruits, some burnt chocolate, wood ash and alcohol. All smells seemed to couple up with each other and accent each other very well. The tastes were just as complex as the aromas and seemed to get only better as it warmed. I tasted bitter hops, burnt and regular coffees, roasted malts, caramel (slight), chocolates, alcohols, flowers, wood ash and some slight dark fruits. The first sip had some bitter hops to it, then an explosion of flavors all through the middle and then ended the same way it started. This is one complex beer. Big, full, creamy, lovely, luxurious and fabulous. Lives up to its name and its history behind it. The Czars would be proud.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,goz,4.5,"Pour is a super dark black with slight hints of ruby at the edges, thick tan head that fades and leaves good lacing. Aroma is chocolate, roasted malts, and some hops (flowery, light perfume) in the end. Flavor starts with chocolate, middle the roasted malts show through, some hops towards the end. Alcohol barely shows through at the very end when it reaches it's warmest temp. Full bodied, long lasting taste. Truly outstanding.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,goindownsouth,4.27,"North Coast brings out yet another winner. A very good brew. It almost appears, to me, to be a porter-like brew. But this beer is so much more. It offers a porter-type body and consistency complete with malted aroma and flavor. There are hints of chocolate-like sweetness, but not too overbearing. If you can find it, please seek this one out. It is well worth it. Prost!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,nomad,3.55,"Pours out just about black with light tan head that doesn't amount to much. Real rocky and frothy lace that dies fairly fast and eventually turns into a nothing of a lace. For the nosey stuff, it had an interesting turn on the common imperial stout nut scent, a lighter but more complex type of nut. Real bright fruitiness to the nose, has a citrusy kind zing to it from the very high level of hops.  As for taste, there was an almost salty type of hop bitterness with a long and multi-leveled finish: started with a quick bitterness, then turned to a fruity hoppiness which then mixed with the roasted malt flavor, and lastly it all evened out and washed over the majority of my palate. Fairly thin mouthfeel.  Overall, an overly hoppy version of the Imperial Stout. The more it opened the more malt attempted to balance the strong hops, but in the end the sharp onslaught of hoppy bitter, fruit, and salt won out. I love me a hoppy IPA, but in my opinion an Imperial should not stray too far from its malty base.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

Taste is how can I say it?..out of this world ..first malt then hops..but theres great chunks of black coffee..unsweetened dark chocolate..a great but not overwhelming stuff.

112,412,Bang34,4.63,"Wow, I tried this brew after seeing it on the ""Top Brews"" list on this site. I have always been a fan of Stouts and being from Mendocino County, CA just one hour's drive from the birthplace of this beer, it seemed like a match made in heaven. If I could find it. A while back I remembered seeing this brew on the rack at my local Safeway. But when I finally decided to try it, guess what, it was nowhere to be found. After about a month of absence from the shelf, it was finally there. I bought 2 four-packs, just in case it disappeared again.  Now, the rating. Appearance, black, dark, stout-like, with a tanish brown head that sticks around and gives a nice creamyness and lace. The aroma, malty coffeeness comes to mind with a hint of Chocolate. Taste, creamy, chocolaty , coffee like with an after warmth of the alcohol. Even so, this is so smooth, you woul not believe that it is 8.9%.  Brewed in the historic logging and fishing town of Fort Bragg Califonia. Part of the Karate Kid III was filmed there as was the Kurt and Goldie Flick ""Overboard"" but it is probably most famous for being the final stop of the Skunk Train. I only whis I had found this beer sooner. Along with Anderson Valley's Barney Flats Oatmeal Stout, it is one of my favorites. Available in four packs, and with the alcohol content and thickness, believe me, that is all you will need.  I moved to Missouri about 2 1/2 years ago and really miss this beer. It is availsble in my hometown, the small Hamlet of Gualala at the local Supers and I buy it whenever I get back there. On one of my last trips home I was able to get my Mom and Step Dad to take me to lunch at the brewery and they were impressed with this brew as well.  Missouri Import laws don't let any craft Cali brews in, save Pyramid and Sierra Nevada thanks to St. Louis based AB.

Raosty malts also find there way into this fine aroma. Very spicy and roasty at the same time.  This brew is loaded with flavor. It is rich and full-bodied. Chocolate and roasty malts start you out. Then, spicy hops come in like crazy to make this one complex brew. It is very creamy in the finish. The flavors are intense and could wake you up in the morning. This is simply a near perfect brew.

112,412,49degrees,4.43,"Ive never really fancied stout beers. Ive tried a small handful over the years, but never found myself attracted to what the style had to offer. I could probably even count on my fingers the number of stouts that Ive tried. Having become quite the hophead and Barley Wine fan in recent months, it was about time I started to take a real serious look at what stouts have to offer. Several weeks back I had the chance to split a bottle of Rogues Imperial Stout with a fellow Beerfly at the Rogue brewery in Issaquah, WA  at little more than a 1/4 bottle, it was little to truly test my taste buds with, but the initial impact was definitely applauded.  Having played with real Russian beer earlier in the evening, I thought Id tackle a Russian Imperial Stout Old Rasputin to be specific. In a single word  IMPRESSIVE! Now I know the Old Rasputin is a highly regarded stout, but Ill have to admit, my taste buds, palette, stomach and the rest of me was really ready for this one. I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Sold in traditional 12oz dark brown, stubby bottles, the label features a sketched image of Rasputin to help prepare the drinker for battle. This brew pours exceptionally dark black, not quite as heavy a pour as some stouts, but suitable characteristics nonetheless. The head is a thick dark creamy consistency that sticks around for a long period of time.  This beer has an incredible rich aroma packed full of robust hints of chocolate, coffee, plenty of hops, and even some subtle fruit essence in the bouquet. An extremely appetizing aroma that makes you want to dive right in.  Taste wise, it delivers everything that one would hope based on the initial inspection of sight and smell. Very rich, intense flavors of dark roasted coffee (very bitter like many of Starbucks blends), a strong but even chocolate flavor which works well with the nutty flavors that come through in the brew too. Theres an almost spicy hint that this beer leaves on the palette, something Im thinking it a result of the roasted malts, 8.9% alcohol and bitter hops. Its an interesting flavor that works very very well.  This brew is a super drink that worked well tonight as an after dinner relaxer and would make for a perfect winter warmer. Kudos to North Coast Brewing Company for this stellar addition. I wasnt a stout drinker before Rasputin, but if this is what the world of stout beer is all about, consider me converted.

112,412,OldFrothingSlosh,4.5,"Presentation: 12oz. amber bottle with Old Rasputin himself daring me to attempt to conquer the liquid contained within. Dare I venture further?  Appearance: If evil was a liquid, this would be it. Poured a insanely dark and dastardly color. When held up to the light, a wonderful ruby tint around the edges is revealed. Amazing.  Smell: Chocolate...coffee...and a little alcohol. Very, very nice.  Taste: Wow. Where to begin? Silky chocolate flavors mixed with a chewy malty sweetness. The flavor is large and in your face, asking what kind of a beer drinker you think you are to dance with this brew.  Mouthfeel: A lovely Swedish massage for the palate. The incredible smoothness of this beer make for a frothy, silky mouthfeel.  Drinkability: I was amazed at how much better this beer tasted as it warmed up. I lacked the willpower to just let it sit...I'm not worthy. The alcohol gives a great warming feeling and the smoooooooooth aftertaste make for one spectacular beer. Must get another one.  Note: Finally found this on tap at Brew's Cafe in Granville, OH. Even better from the tap. I could even bump up the Taste and Mouthfeel.

112,412,SamuraiJack,4.42,"An excellent American Stout. Perhaps not on par with either the Shakespeare or the Brooklyn Chocolate, but still a great beer. On first pour we have a nearly completely opaque brew, deep, dark, black as black. The head isn't very strong or thick or creamy, but has tight and even sized bubbles. Nice cascade forms to introduce you to the pleasures to come. The aromas are nearly overwhelmingly alcoholic, but somehow balanced by the deep and rich roasted malt and dark roast espresso notes. The first taste is oh so smooth. Flavours are dominated by coffee, charcoal, malt and bitter hops. The alcohol adds potency and spicey notes, but is still balanced. Aftertaste fades into impressive sweetness, still balanced by the ongoing espresso notes. Mmmm.... this is a stout I could even session drink. Nice.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,kbub6f,4.9,"Bought locally (Grapevine refrigerated shelves), 2-3 weeks in my fridge, sat 30 minutes before pouring (the longest 30 minutes of my life). I've got one in the cellar for next year, but if I ever run out upstairs, that baby's a goner.  This is my all-time favorite beer. It just makes me happy from first sip to last. I'm always nervous when I open a bottle that it can't live up to the impression the last one left on me. Ok, enough.  Rasputin pours with a coarse tan head that clings to the glass as it collapses. Pour it hard to get cascading, but then pay the price of having to wait or wade through the head to get to the prize. Once the head is gone, it's gone for good. All that's left is a black hole where your glass used to be. Speaking of black, you'd better drink this in a well-lit place so you don't lose it.  Roasted, sweetish, somewhat fruity nose. It doesn't smell that strong. The alcohol is hiding, but somehow you can sense the evil lurking.  It's a mistake to start this one cold, but it opens up surprisingly fast. The start is maltacular. The middle is strong and complex: is that coffee? chocolate you ask? Just as you think you've pinned the tail on the palate, the alcohol kicks you in the head for being such a pompous ass. ""Here, have some hops and shut the f--- up! Pansy.""  I'm giving this a 4.5 on drinkability because not only can you only drink one, you can't drink any other beer when you're done.

However, by the time I'm halfway through the second one, it's a beauty. Has a bit of that powdered chocolate taste that you find in lighter stouts, but improves as you go (ABV, warming?).

112,412,AtrumAnimus,3.92,"Russian Stout - Who would have thunk it? Anyway - this one is a real surprise for the stout lover. It compares well to Rogue Shakespeare Stout.  It is a dark stout (of course) with a dark brown head that is not as creamy as the Guinness style of stouts. The taste is more malty with a strong taste of hops in the finish. Another beer that I rather enjoy. A little hard to find in stores. Definitely worth a try. Has a clean finish. And read the article on the side - what a hoot that is. This beer even has a history that is more than just how they make it. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- It's been speculated that no one had a greater appreciation for this rich, roasty elixir than Rasputin, the mystic wag (and favorite of the ladies of the court), who was the ultimate downfall of Czar Nicholas II.  Rasputin is probably best remembered for his dramatic exit. Having been deemed politically expendable, he was fed poisoned wine and tea cakes by his rivals. Surviving that, he was shot several times - whereupon he attacked his assailants. He finally succumbed when bound and stuffed through a hole in the ice to drown in the River Neva. Legends that attribute his tenacity to his appetite for Russian Imperial Stout are unproven.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,TheLongBeachBum,4.13,"For a small, unassuming looking bottle, there is one mighty beer contained inside. Old Rasputin himself stares at you with those eyes from the simple looking brown, black and white label, whilst doffing his right hand in a kind of salute to the brave souls that are tasting this beer for the first time  myself included. Am I to be yet another Virgin to add to the Mad Monks long and varied list, I wonder?!. The beer pours a color twixt a very deep oily-brown and an almost bituminous black color. Once poured, the body of the beer lets little light through, although a deep brown red- hue can be detected from the refracted light at the edges of the glass. Atop this darkest of beers sits a regal looking fluffy brown-tan head that remains a solid ½ throughout, though dies a little towards the end. The smooth looking velvet creamy head looks fantastic and hints at the smoothness of this beer. Immediately I poured this beer, I thought to myself liquorice, for the fresh pungent smell of this fine root-extract flavoring filled the air around my desk. Malt is perceptible in the nose at the start, with some roast character, although surprisingly I found the aromas to be less pungent than expected. A powerful introduction, an assault on the tongue almost, tells you that this is a beer that you dont mess with. A marvellous strong roast coffee flavour interspersed with roast malt flavours, roll around together in the mouth and punch the cheeks. This is a fighting beer. Deep, dark chocolately middle, with a hard-wood, oaky dry bitter finish that leaves hints of raisins and liquorice on the palate. The beer leaves a warming trace that slowly tracks the path of the fluid as it descends the gullet, a warmth that would quell any Siberian winter. Fantastic. A bloody marvellous Imperial Stout.  More Russian than a Vodka Breakfast. More Imperial that Darth Vaders Dark Side. And More Stout than John Candy.  A truly hypnotic beer that clearly has Rasputinious powers of influence.

112,412,johnrobe,4.17,"Rasputin the ""mad monk"" was legendary for, among other things, his drinking ability and high tolerance which helped him evade, if only temporarily, attempts on his life involving alcohol and poisin.  This brew pours black as onyx, letting only a dull shimmer of light through around the edges of the glass. The head is medium tan and maintains just a cap but leaves a respectable amount of lace.  The aroma is like rich hot chocolate, molasses, and a bit of dark roasted malt. The taste is of decadent chocolate and cappucino with some dark roasted bitterness making an admirable appearance before being held in check by all the sweetness. The mouthfeel is slightly syrupy which is very fitting for this brew. Perhaps a bit sweet for the style but nonetheless a delicious beer. Have this one after dinner.  Nostrovya!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,feloniousmonk,4.85,"An old, old favorite that I've been loyal to since my very first sip. Huge, cocoa-colored head, properly boisterous and fizzy. Phenomenally aromatic: all the regulars for this style and more are here in attendance--cocoa, coffee, toffee, nuts. Very mellow, despite the flavor and strength. Perfectly black in color, fantastic texture: thick and chewy, but not overly so. This is a great accompaniament for any meal, particularly rich and spicy food. I'd compliment the finish, but it never stops! The flavor sticks in your mouth forever, it seems. One of the finest stouts in all the universe.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Mark,4.15,"Black as night with a dark tan head. Head was thick,retention was good, and lacing solid. Very nice roasty aroma, strong alcohol notes on the palate. A very complex big beer that mellowed me out just right. Not really my favorite style but I sure appreciated this big beer. I did like that the 8%ABV made this more drinkable than some of the 10% Imperials I have tried. Great brew!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,garymuchow,3.71,"I'll state it from the outset (as I have before), I have problems with beers that move to the ""cloying sweet"" taste, and this one does. Maybe it'll be something I accomodate in time, but for now it's a distraction. However, it doesn't take away from many other fine attributes of this beer. Very good head considering the abv, with nice lacing almost to the end. Really nice red/mahogany color when held to the light. Nice complex flavor and aroma that leans toward caramel as much, if not more than, roasted malt. It's the heavy fruitness that moves towards excessive sweetness that I struggle with, but I'm working on appreciating it. Very well hopped leaving a very long dry finish. And as others have said, a well hidden alcohol content. Mouthfeel was just a tad thin. Somehow I'll manage to get through the rest of my bottles.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Gusler,4.57,"The beer pours as ""Dark as the inside of a cow"", monumental and frothy chocolate head with tons of lace. The nose simply reeks of toasted grains, chocolate, and caramel. Big sweet malt start, top ""Don't get any fuller than this"", finish is hop spicy, minimal acidity, droughty chocolate malt aftertaste. Just cannot remember having a better ""Imperial than this"". A must try for all ""Lovers of the Dark side"", and if your a ""Stout"" lover, ""Baby your ship just came in"".",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

"" Mabey I'll Move""!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,mjohn27603,3.88,Pours opaque black with a slight reddish tinge. Small head indicates the low carbonation common in this style. Aroma is of chocolate and roasted character but a little short of perfect. Taste is on the bitter side. Some chocolate. I must say I enjoy Bell's Expedition Stout more it has some fig or prune tastes that add another layer of complexity to the mix. High alcohol is present and noticeable. I did enjoy this at night on the first day of our first snow that stuck. I did the the atmosphere right.,North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Zraly,4.32,"As soon as the bottle is cracked open, one is assaulted with a very forward aroma of coffee and alcohol. This beer pretty much announces itself. Old Rasputin pours a warm black color. The head I poured was not overly impressive. (I may be at partial blame for that.)  This beer is no joke. There is deep, bittersweet pungency to this brew. There is an exciting malt-on-malt, layered flavor. It is extremely complex and with an alcohol content of 8.9%, you will feel this beer. At moments, it tastes as though I am drinking a stout spiked with a shot of Stoli vodka. Holy sh@t.  Enjoy. And be sure to note the hair on your chest in the morning.  Edit - January 20, 2009  The taste buds have adjusted to many new types of beers, so I thought I'd re-visit a style, and this ale in particular, to see what I think of it now.  Dark as night with a clingy tan head. Faint, crisp note of alcohol and malts hit the nose.  Smooth, but bitter, malt kick. A smoothness resides underneath some of the upfront flavors. Tastes like a wonderful, french roasted coffee bean that has been french pressed --- with just a hint of sugar and cream. Bittersweet. This is so complex and delicious --- and would work well with black forest cake or a dark chocolate pairing. I'm having mine with some ""morning after bread"" that my girlfriend made: a whole wheat bread made with coffee and Kona Pipeline Porter. It's heavenly, and you should be jealous.  I'm glad I picked up a four pack of this and re-evaluated this selection. I think it has ""cult"" status for a reason. It's a cold night here in VA, and a few of these will warm me up the way I like.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,dolem98,4.34,"Highlights: -Overpowering burnt coffee flavors, faint smokiness -Lots of bitterness, reminds me of chewing espresso beans -Improved as it warmed -Reminds me of quadruple shot (with a hint of raspberry and light on the chocolate) mocha  Notes: I didn't give it a higher rating in appearance, because I like it when Imperial Stouts pour like syrup. This one poured just slightly thinner than expected. Excessively bitter to get a higher drinkability.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,chilidog,4.17,"My first Imperial & I purchased this as my first offering of ohio's new apv law. At 8.9% this was a great sample of things to come. This brew was stunning for me as soon as I cracked the cap. The scent and aroma take-over to kick-start the taste-buds. Pour this black, low carbon stout and get a half-inch head that settles to a film but has enough in it to lace well, thicker than one might expect.The taste of dark chocolate, roasted coffee beans with a not shy alcohol presence. The strength I think smooths this brew to the point of creamy. Enjoyed this-one on a cold rainy night.....Perfect!!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Jon,4.4,"750 ml. Millennium Edition bottle. Pours jet black with a creamy, tan head. Hops, alcohol and coffee are present in the nose. Coffee-like taste presents itself along with a generous dose of hops, malt and alcohol. Mouthfeel is rather oily and fitting for the style. Quite smooth overall. This imperial stout certainly has its warming effects at 8.9% ABV. An impressive creation from North Coast.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,boblinneman,4.03,"Dark dark dark brown, not black. Roasted alcoholic nose. Roasted malt flavor followed by a strong alcohol and hop bite. A very good imperial, true to the form. Storm King still is King of the Imperials.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Wildman,4.15,"This beer pour almost black dark amber color. It formed a nice dark tan foamy heal that left some nice circular lace. The aroma was of malt and coffee. The flavor was of malt, coffee and chocolate. The body was a bit thinner than the few others I have tried. The finish was of a burnt bitter style.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,mzwolinski,4.59,"This is quite a substantial beer. Pours jet black, of course, with a thin head which dissipates almost immediately -- your first clue to the alcohol content of this beer, in case you missed the tiny 8.9% ABV on the bottom of the label.  Alcohol is present in the aroma as well, but surprisingly, only on rather close inspection. The scent that hits you in the face is the highly roasted malt. Deep, intoxicating and luxurious aroma, with hints of black cherries.  The beer is as bit rough on the tongue, but I'm not sure this is even a fault. Coffee-like flavors of malt with a surprisingly high hop bitterness. Alcohol warming sensation and a nice, sweet aftertaste. Full bodied in the extreme. Approach this beer with respect!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,BeerAngel,4.23,"Pours a dark coffee color with deep garnet if held up to light, but who cares ;-)...and has a dirty tan head. Smells of faint coffee and chocolate mildy roasted come through and blended nicely. Taste of burnt coffee and a nice balance of hops tapers into a nice malty roast that is delicious! Very nice balance of flavors that ends with a dry hoppy taste on the tail. The mouthfeel is a medium body and just mildly creamy. Awesome brew! Cheers!",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,putnam,4.14,"After a glass of Lion Stout...this has a warmer tone to the color of the head and warmer, woodier aromas as well. The liquid is suprisingly light in color. Raw cocoa and coffee beans, like kahlua, with a little green bean, pine nut, and cherry jam on the nose. Now licorice and cough syrup...Rich, round, sweet chocolate fudge. Burned chocolate cookies. A nice assertive bitterness on the medium-long finish.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,marc77,3.94,"Approaching black in hue, w/ trace deep brilliant garnet when held to light. Dark tan head slowly settles into a tight lace leaving layer. Light chocolate and butterscotch, w/ mild roasted barley and nuttiness. Subdued vinous alcohol soaked dark fruit. Not as delectable in aroma compared to other imperials. Sharp roasted barley bitterness hits the palate initially, then is ensued by a wave of milk chocolate sweetness and prune like fruitiness. Mild sherry notes and black licorice emerge mid palate then are rendered abrupt by assertive hop bitterness. Hop flavor, although overshadowed by the malt profile, combines w/ the fruitiness to leave a pleasant citrus rind undertone. Fairly light in body for an imperial, but the dextrinous mouthfeel does not reflect that. Finishes w/ a slightly smoky, lingering bittersweet chocolate flavor. Old Rasputin is delicious, but falls a bit short aromawise. The rich malt character isn't represented in aroma. It lacks the complete package of richness, but is highly enjoyable nonetheless.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,aaronh,4.77,"After searching for this beer for 10 months, I finally got my hands on a 4-pack while on vacation. It was worth the wait. This is a wonderful Imperial Stout. Nice dark color, almost black with a beautiful tan head. The aromas from this beer are almost as good as the taste: coffee, chocolate, malt. I savored each sip of each beer, spending almost an hour with each. The alcohol is noticable, but not overpowering. But I wouldn't choose Old Rasputin for a night of drinking. It's more of a beer for a relaxing evening. If this beer is readily available in your area, drink it regularly. If not, stock up when you find it. I'm ready to make the 6 hour drive to get some more.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Bierman9,4.25,"Old Raspy was very dark brown, almost black in color, with some ruby glimmering through. Had a good, creamy tan head, with nice lacing. Big-time coffeeish-roasty aromas coming forth. Good body, and slid nicely over the tongue and down the hatch...  Lots more roasty/coffee flavors produced some bitterness. Found some hints of dark fruits hidden in there as well. Comes through with a nice little hop zing at the end. But it's mostly the bitter roasty flavors which stand out. A good belly-warmer!

112,412,aracauna,4.2,"Typical appearance for any rich stout or imperial stout. Deep black with dark tan head. Head wasn't very large, but not overly small either. Aroma is has the burnt chocolately aroma typical of the style, but it's in competition with the sharp citric peel of the hops. Seemed very balanced between the two. Some sweetness in the aroma as well. The flavor is lighter than I expected. There's a thin burnt bitterness and citrus peel flavor (although sharper like lemon or grapefruit than fuller orange peel flavor). This is all backed up by by the rich malt, but less so than Expedition or World Wide. It was also less sweet than those others. Not quite as overwhelming as the others and a bit more drinkable.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,ZAP,4.62,"Midnight black with a creamy tan head....the nose on this beer is outstanding...I just want to smell it and smell it and smell it, but I figured I'd better get around to drinking it too. The nose is very heavy on the hops, with a wonderful blend of spicy, earthy, herbal hops..some chocolate on the nose too.. The hops shine through on the buds as well, but there is an excellent chocolate bite to it also...like dark semi-sweet chocolate..Body is thick, but not over thick like Bell's Expedition...this is pretty drinkable in my opinion...the only drawback to me is there is some alcohol taste evident..It finishes with the hop bite, but also with a smooth butterscotchy texture...I really like this one...rates right up there with the best..",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Viking,4.03,"Dark brown, almost black body. Thick brown head, with excellent retention. Aroma thick with roasted malt, raisin, and molasses with undertones of the 8.9% alcohol coming through. Good flavor, roasted malt dominates with a nice bitter finish. Alcohol apparent in flavor, but less so than in the smell. Thick beer, but not really heavy or oily. This is a good choice for an after dinner/late evening relaxation beer.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,ADR,4.07,"Slightly thin pour (not as dense as a Bell's Expedition), nice dark brown head -- 1/4 inch. Very dark color but does let light through at the bottom of the pint glass. Nice fruity aroma, definite notes of vanilla. Full-bodied mouthfeel but not quite coating. Alcoholic, but not excessively so. Lots of bittersweet chocolate flavors, a little java and raisin. It can come off as showing excessive artificial blueberry flavors. Not as complex as Storm King. Partly bitter finish, not bad, mouthfeel brings down my drinkability score. Obviously a decent quality beer, just a definite step below some other Imperials. Nice smell.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,John,4.85,"(12oz. bottle) Awesome black opaque liquid. Rocky tan head. A truly remarkable appearance. A thin creamy layer of foam lasts, leaving residual lace. Huge aroma of chocolate, burnt molasses, ripe prunes and alcohol. Perfect balance of bitterness and sweetness...doesn't possess that sticky sort of sweetness. Just of multitude of flavors happening here; chocolate malt, prunes/raisins, coffee with a welcome alcohol warming sensation in the belly. A delicious, outstanding treat.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,StevieW,4.6,"This beer grew on me. Pours deep dark black with maybe a hint of purple shade ? Nice big tan foamy head, faded into a thin head but fell down the glass nicely. Smells of roasted malt, toffee, coffee. Big roasted coffee taste, strong bitter finish that stays on your tongue.The taste expanded as the beer warmed, don't let the first sip, get you down. The alcohol makes it taste thinner than other stouts. Cool bottle and label. I bought this based on other beer advocates reviews. It is very good.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Bighuge,4.92,"Pours jet black. Medium brown head that dissipates quickly. Beautiful roasty aroma. Also get a bit of smoke on the nose. There's some burnt malt tastes. Very strong bitterness. I love that in an Imperial. The IBU must be approaching 100 in this brew. Incredible malt load balances nicely with the hops. A bit of alcohol dangles on the tongue nicely. This is everything I look for in an Imperial Stout. Not as viscous as Bell's Expedition, but tremendous in its own right. One of my all time favorites. This is in the elite category of microbrewed Imperials that I have tried (along with Bell's Expedition and Rogue).",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,Murph,4.41,"Man, I really love Imperial Stouts and this is a real good one. It is real dark with only the slightest hint of light getting through but kind of a thinish head. For some reason I couldn't get a whole lot of aroma. What I do get is dark chocolate and roasted malts with a slight hop undertone. A different taste for an imperial stout but not one that I am necessarily against. Huge amounts or dark chocolate and roasted malts start on the tongue. This is then followed a nice cascade hop flavor. The bitterness of the hops is nicely balanced with the sweetness of the chocolate and a faint dark fruit presence. I can't find even the slightest hint of alcohol. The mouthfeel is creamy and a bit tangy which leaves me wanting more of it. I would have to say that the hops balance to the huge body of this beer makes it exceptionally drinkable. This is one kick ass beer. One of these days I am going to have to make a pilgrimage to California to see all these amazing breweries in person.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95
112,412,cokes,3.9,"It pours a black body with just the faintest hints of scarlet on the edge. Curiously transparent when held to light. Shifts towards ruby. Head is light tan and relatively thin. Mocha nose with amaretto, port, earth and powerful cascades. Taste is all over the map. Big time bitterness from the roasted coffee/dark chocolate, as well as from the hops (cascades). This is counteracted by some pronounced sweetness in the form of more (milk) chocolate, black grapes, hazelnut and evident alcohol, in the form of vanilla liqueur. Nicely roasty and vinous up front, but it lacks ""stick"", as the flavors seem to drop out quickly. Espresso notes linger, acridly, post-swallow joining with the chewed pill hop notations. Pretty thin for an Imperial. Over carbonated too. Nevertheless, this has quite a bit going for it, and it's quite a fascinating drinking experience in the fattened porter realm. It hasn't the depth nor the body to qualify as an elite Imperial Stout. Price-wise, though, this hits the spot, and its widespread availability is a bonus.",North Coast Brewing Co.,"California, United States",Russian Imperial Stout,95

112,412,Jordan,5,"Pitch black, thick dark tan head. Extremely rich roasted malt and alchohal aromatics. Thick roasted malts, burnt chocolate, coffee flavors penetrate deeply on the palate.

Black as night, with a brown chunky head that seems to crawl, rather than stick, to the pint glass. A very impressive cascading effect when poured.  Highly roasted malt aromas and alcoholic to the nose.  Smooth, potent and espresso like with a high burnt malt and hop bitterness that finishes on the sweet side to say the least.  Very complex, and true to its style. Well worth the $3.00 (+/-) paid for the single bottle, and I'd definitely buy it again.
