259,1708,UWDAWG,4.33,"Poured from a 11.2 ounce bottle dated enjoy by 10/2/23 into a tulip glass.  Look- Deep amber brown, plentiful visible particulate, sudsy medium tan head, opaque, average head retention, below average lacing.  Smell- Banana, fig, chocolate, between weak and medium strength of scent.  Taste- Fig, bready, apple, banana, earthy, slightly boozy, slightly sweet, medium strength of flavor.  Feel- Between thin and medium body, highly creamy, low bitterness, slightly below average carbonation, mildly mouth warming.  Overall- Deep amber brown with plentiful visible particulate and average head retention. Bouquet was delicate with between weak and medium strength, but very appealing. Flavor was medium in strength with a nice mix of fruitiness and notes of malt. This beer was highly creamy with between thin and medium body. Overall this was a very pleasant experience with a style I’m not overly familiar with.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

259,1708,cwm51662,4.07,"I don't think I can add a lot to what was said by those who actually reviewed and didn't just say it was best ever: Surprisingly dark and hazy, big head at the pour- be careful! Not much smell, less alcohol than I've ever had in a 10+abv. Raisin/prune flavor. Gotta love the Monks!",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,NanookinTexas,4.87,"Just finished a 750ml bottle of ABT12. And one that's been in my collection for at minimum 2 years. I haven't had an ABT12 in God only knows how long, 5 years, 6 years? What a SPECTACULAR brew. Wish I had a few other bottles of the same vintage to consume during this New Year's Holiday weekend in a more focused way. Even so, this much I will say : Definitely not for the faint of heart. It's FANTASTIC in color and complex in flavor and, super rich, thick and frothy (be extra careful when you pour it). It's been a LONG time since I last posted a review on BA. Finishing this bottle tonight, I simply had to add some thoughts. A PERFECT brew for this time of year. CHEERS to all. And may all of you have a joyous 2023!",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

259,1708,Davidstan,4.13,Definitely a quality brew! New to Belgian beer so no expert but was surprised how well the abv is disguised. Great malt combo with solid hop after tones. Will buy again but when will the euros get off the 11.2 bottle scam. We lose a good sip on every beer!,Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,UncleReemus78,5,This beer still blows my mind. It's wholesome and delicious and everyone that I've showed it to ended up loving it as much as me. It's better than Chimay and Duvel which are also great Belgian ales. I imagine that Belgium saves it's best brews for themselves and send us the bottom of the barrel of their good beers so to say which I'm not complaining about.,Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

259,1708,Legendary_Geko,3.77,"Look: Dark brown. Very nice head, excellent look.  Smell: Weird to me, earthy and metal.

I’m a drink it right now! Smell is simply luxury - sweet and inviting, warm Holiday spices, sourdough bread, dark fruit. Taste follows, with a great alcohol kick. Feel is a mouthful. The carbonation expands all the aromas and makes you sit and chew awhile. Righteous stuff. Overall, fresh, fulfilling, rich, nice in the head.,. one of the finest beers in the World.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,crazyspicychef,5,One of the best available offerings of this style. Delicious! The perfect digestif or special occasion brew. Top notch stuff.,Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Chocolatefreak,4.33,"Love the smell of this ale - dark fruit & bread. Taste matches smell; dark fruit & bread with a slight sour yeast flavor. A well done beer, but not a personal favorite because of the taste.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,HappyGuy12345,4.85,"12 ounce bottle poured into a pint glass Look: Dark brown with 1.5 fingers of head with excellent retention Smell: Complex array of sugar and fruits Taste: Follows the nose, with a tasty arrangement of caramel/sugary tones plus fruit. The high alcohol content is barely noticed. Feel: Full-bodied, silky smooth going down with moderate degree of carbonation. Overall: An incredible beer perfect for a special occasion.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,jngls,4.6,"BBE 6/8/25. 33cl bottle to wine glass.  Look: Pours a dark, murky brown with a lightly brownish/beige fluffy head that lasts quite long and leaves just a bit of lacing.  Smell: Brown sugar and caramel. Sweet, malty and slightly alcoholic. Even a bit fruity.  Taste: Malty and sweet. Some roasty notes, some bitterness. Caramelized, almost burnt brown sugar. Dried plum and red apple.  Feel: Full mouthfeel. Low to medium carbonation.  Overall: Prime example of the style. Very complex. Not too alcoholic despite its high ABV. Should be drank at the recommended temperature since it unfolds its full potential as it warms. Fantastic beer.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,CBlack85,4.32,"Poured from an 11.2oz bottle into a Boulevard Smokestack Stemmed Tulip  The beer pours a deep mahogany/brown color with about three fingers worth of fluffy head that slowly recedes leaving behind lots of chunky lacing.  Aroma pleasant, but a bit less robust than I expected. Bready with notes of raisins, plums, dates and a faint yeastiness that rounds out the beer.  Taste follows the nose closely, dark/brown bread, dark fruits, a mild spiciness, and a mild banana-esque yeast flavor. Medium bodied, slick on the tongue, and moderately carbonated.  Overall, this is quite a pleasant beer that I look forward to revisiting.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,BlakeT49ers,4.57,Yah this one’s legit. Was happy to find at Rock&Brews Orlando. Smooth and trippel notes but so much more. Lovely feel. Very balanced without being too malty or too hoppy.,Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,JZH1000,4.24,"Poured from a 75cL corked bottle into the biggest glass I have, a spieglau American wheat beer glass and It barely fit. A dark murky brown red letting almost no light through. On the pour I got a 2 finger head that started overflowing. After a little while it disappeared to nothing. Not all that carbonated looking.  Smell is very yeast forward with fruit notes and some malts coming through. Very similar to a dry wine with grainy notes very heavy smell. Some alcohol.  Flavor is quite similar to the nose but malts are much more present. Still some acidity and fruit notes mixing with the roast to make it a bit winey. Very dark and fruity beer at the same time. Some alcohol is detected but it seems to compliment the beer at warmer Temps (20 minutes out the fridge). Very nuanced beer.  Feel is a bit thinner than I would've expected. I thought it would be thicker from all the grain that went into it. But its still very nice and almost easy to put down if it wasn't so extremely flavorful.  Overall, its a very interesting beer with lots of flavors to explore. This beer is pretty extreme to the point of giving me winey vibes, but still at its core it is beer. This is my first experience with a real belgian ale other than an old bottle of duvel a long time ago so I don't know all that much about the style. However I enjoyed this beer",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Steve_Studnuts,4.18,"Some fluffy, beaten egg white foam forms over a deep copper, almost brown body. There's some sediment floating about, but not as much as anticipated considering I can't remember how long ago I purchased this bottle. Been meaning to pop the cork for awhile now. Smells super bready and yeasty, but not in the way you generally find typical of Belgians. This is its own thing, at least to my nostrils. Lots of sweet, dark fruit; figs and such. Also some fruity notes you wouldn't necessarily expect with raspberries standing out to me. Smells fookin' great. Tastes it as well. Not as good as implied by the nose, but very tasty all the same. Yeasty up front with a fruity middle and a bready finish. Nowhere near as boozy as I'd assumed with something of this octane. Low carbonation suits this beer very well. Complex yet easy drinking beer = big thumbs up from me.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Perioddicals,4.68,"L - Poured from. 12 oz bottle into a Dogfish Head Signature Glass at around 60 degrees. One finger tan frothy head. Dark opaque brown color. Frothy lacing just stays on the glass walls  S - dark fruits like cherry, raisins, etc. and sweet bread malt scents.  T - taste follows scent with sweet bread and dark fruits. Some alcohol comes through at 10% ABV, but it’s more balanced and easy to drink than you would expect. The lightest of a floral hop bitterness in the taste. A little smoky/toasty cola comes through on some tastes as it warms up. Agitating it half way through brings back the sweet flavors. The complexity is great.  F - frothy and great thick mouthfeel. Solid carbonation.  O - This is a great beer. Obviously at 10% ABV this is a one drink and done. But the scent and flavors are excellent. Nice complexity with each taste and smell. I really enjoyed the fact that agitating/swirling partway through brought back the initial flavor and scent profiles. All in all, even at the higher ABV, I drank this one pretty fast as I kept going back for different tastes. Highly recommended as I add this to my annual rotation.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,AlexandraDen,4.33,"Pours a deep ruby, two inch off tan head that fades after two minutes  Rum soaked deserts, malt, bread, raisin on the nose.  The look is strong, aromas fairly decent, but the drink is where the beer is, as described, formidable. Tastes of sugared bread, dried fruits such as raisins and even dried candied melon and cherry. Powerful malt backbone that lasts for days  General alcohol warmth to the sip. Assertive mouthfeel with good carbonation. My beer hid the bitterness quite well, with the sweet malt notes winning every time. Might be due to this bottle being a little older (likely).  As it warms the beer opens up quite a bit. The malty, bready notes are even more prominent if that’s even possible. Once again that rum raisin alcohol warmness presents itself. What is harder to describe is the melding of multiple flavours and tastes that’s hard for me to pick out. I’d love to come back to this beer eventually.  Complex, and even more so as it warms. One of those beers that deserves a revisit every year. I wish I could give this a better review; I chose this beer as its strong as we just receive news Russia has invaded Ukraine. A beer, a moment in time, I don’t think I’ll ever forget and will likely become a home for me and my memories in the future.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,KomodoDragon,4.53,"Beautiful look and scent to this classic. Big tan head, wonderful lacing.  Taste of biscuits and prunes. Quite sweet, although that tapers as it warms. Heavy, with some alcohol warming. Big mouthfeel, malt that lingers for days. Excellent balance for such robust flavors.  Formidable brew",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,MistaT,4.13,"Overall: a triumphant beer that definitely stands out when you want a heavy beer but not a stout. It reminds me of old/stock ales but with less hops and bitterness. Tastes of raisin, rum, bread, and a slight pucker from prunes.  Great right ahead or right after the coldes of months, or when you need something to sip all night and a stout would be too much.  I do think there may be better quads, but as of yet I haven't found one that tops Abt 12.  Look: a dark mahogany brown that looks almost deep purple if not under light. Beautiful lacing with the a thick head that dissipates into a nice creamy top coating of bubbles.  Smell:right up in your nose, this one carries a pervasive aroma though it's not heavy. I catch the smell of Belgian yeast (sharp/sour) and it's lovely.  Taste: don't tackle this one when it's too cold, I enjoyed it after 40+ mins out of the fridge. Bold flavors that are balanced between raisins, prunes, rum, and dark bread. Loved that I can't taste any rock sugar, a common issue with me and high ABV Belgian beers.  Feel: top of the mouth silkiness and a long lasting presence on the top of the mouth/cheeks.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,SWORunner,4.89,"Spectacular example of the style. Deep, profound aroma and taste profiles. Vivid dark, dried fruits with a subtle hop back profile. Simply sublime.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,CobraChicken,4.62,Beautiful ruby/cola color poured with an off white head. Substantial and lingering. The smell is malty with hints of dark fruit. The first sip tells you a story. I am still new to tasting but even I can tell that this is exceptional. Sweet on the front end with dark raisin and toasted bread crust. Finished with a bitterness paired with a crisp clean bite. The mouthfeel is beautifully balanced with the carbonation. It’s a meal. I polished off a large pint +9oz bottle tonight in short intervals. I wish that o could fully appreciate everything that was going on with this and plan to revisit again in the future as my beer palate matures. Top notch beer and deserving of a world class title.,Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Collinss,4.65,"I'm not traditionally much of a Belgian beer drinker, and at $22 a 4 pack I was skeptical on the recommendation, however I must say that I am impressed the dark ruby and brown color and off white head lead to an aroma of wine and dried fruit on the nose, particularly red wine and cherry. On the taste it feels exactly that like that with a more pronounced flavor of sweet raisins rather than dry wine, which leads to a funky Belgian ale finish which is just intrigued. I'm just blown away at the complexity of this beer and the warmer it gets the more interesting it becomes, it is truly a unique experiance and I Highly recommend trying it once in your lifetime. Prost.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Explorer_Bill,4.75,"Actually first time to have this legendary beer. Draft in a goblet. Dark brown and hazy great lacing. Rich, toasty, malty, molasses, and rich smell. Sweet and funky taste. Belgian yeasts are obvious. I love the mouth feel; velvety. Dried fruit and a noticeable but appreciated slightly bitter finish. After enjoying Abbot 12 I can fully appreciate its lofty status.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Giampiero,4.58,"Poured into a Goblet from a fairly fresh bottle, at around 9° Celsius. Mahogany colour, with light leather notes when seen in direct light. Nice foamy head, creamy colour, not very persistent but consistently present, if faint. Somewhat lacking smell with hints of floral characteristics, and that usual smell of Belgian yeast... but in the mouth? Oh dear... so many things to take notes of, the intensity is out of this world! Raisins, plums, strawberry and cherry, it's an explosion of dark fruits, with strong hints of chocolate and lighter ones of coffee dominating a somewhat bitter aftertaste. It's just... so balanced, and extremely drinkable, as the high alcohol content makes itself known only in the aftertaste, enriching the bitterness. Near perfect!",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Until you are half way through it or towards the end you can feel the alcohol more . Leaving a lace as you drink it . It's very enjoyable beer to drink sipping on it.

Flavor & aftertaste: Moderate bitterness, grainy, hints of dark malt and spiciness.  Mouth-feel: Medium bodied, very effervescent.  Overall: Very strong Abbey quad ale. Complex aromas & flavors. Don't drink too cold or you'll miss some nuances. Seems a tad more bitter than some of St. Bernardus' other brews, but the malt base & alcohol appropriately balance it. Alcohol is noticeable, but amazingly well hidden. Has the signature highly effervescent carbonation from the bottle conditioning. Very nice.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Overall very enjoyable, but personally I tried it for the first time right after a Rochefort 10 and found it lacking by comparison. Make sure it comes up to temperature before serving. I would recommend as high as 55 to 60 degrees, as the flavor profile comes out much more profoundly after it warms.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

I’m not a fan of the style so that could be it, but anything rated in the top 100 should be excellent to virtually any beer drinking.

259,1708,hank_and_als_beer_reviews,4.07,"7/11/2021 5:21pm EST Fort Myers Beach, FL  Poured from a 11.2oz bottle (FL 07 03 23) into a 15cl St. Bernardus tasting glass.  Look: This beer is an expedition into the deepest depths of tawny. A 38 SRM with a rambunctious head that understays its welcome.  Smell: Complex dark fruits and nuts make way to a trio of maple, warm figs and American oak. Yeast makes its presence known, but not overbearingly so. Sweetens as the head dissipates.  Taste: A punch-like blend of dark fruit cut by just the slightest hint of bitterness leaving behind a crisp hint of roasted caramel and a suggestion of barrel-aged sweetness. Warmth permeates the body.  Feel: Delicately carbonated and full-bodied with a warmth that permeates the entire experience. Almost syrupy in texture, but not serious detraction.  Overall: Abt 12 is an extreme beer, perhaps best meant to be split with a friend after a complex dinner and sipped and enjoyed slowly.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,md3kcn,4.89,"Purchased as a single bottle from Fresh Market for $13.99. Poured into a crystal goblet. Posting this review from some notes I wrote down a couple of days ago, but only now could post to BA.  L - A thick, deep amber/brown. Glorious four-finger yeasty bran-colored head that stays the entire time. S - Wet hay, caramel, and wet earth. Slight plum and honeycomb. Closes with freshly baked pumpernickel bread. T - Heavy caramel and vollkornbrot. Molasses and stone fruit leads into rich notes of earthy toffee notes. Hints of pipe tobacco and bran. Finishes on a faint bitter note of an almost cherry-fruitiness. F - Heavy yet extremely drinkable. Slightly carbonated with a full body. O - If there was ever a type of beer to sip on while playing a relaxing game of chess, this would be at the top of my list. Wonderfully warm and complex, yet welcoming and inviting. One of the best beers I've ever had. Well worth the price, and I would highly recommend trying this sometime in your lifetime.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

259,1708,LeBron_James,4.74,"Wow so this one really impressed me.  Pours a deep blood red colour with big white head. Translucent and very seductive.  Smells very very nice. That Belgian smell comes through like crazy with nice dark fruit and malt sweetness. The sweetness is kind of a cross between fresh doughy bread and maybe a kind of banana character. This is very very pleasant. Some earthyness comes through on the nose and there’s a small bit of alcohol.  Taste is amazing. Follows the nose in the fruity, malty, balanced yet kind of sweet goodness. This is a very malt forward and very traditional Belgian style quad and it gives its personality through the taste. Very awesome. Small, hardly noticeable alcohol and nice sweet earthy tones with lots of zappy malt breadyness.  The mouthfeel is a nice full body with perfect carbonation. Coats the mouth in this kind of bittersweet dry finish. Beautiful.  So before this beer I thought I didn’t really like quads. This is by far my favourite Belgian beer I’ve had and it’s one of my favourite overall. This is so drinkable and seriously amazing. The fact this beer existed in ww2 era is hilarious.

259,1708,harrypowers,4.58,"Pours a dark reddish brown. If you pour hard you get a runaway fluffy head. A careful slow pour works better.  Smells of yeast, bread , dark fruit and alcohol. Tastes of malt, yeast , raisins, plums and booze.  This brew has a surprisingly light body and mouthfeel given its strength.  This excellent sipper earns its ""World Class"" label fairly!",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Sigmund,4.25,"Rerate, 330 ml bottle, Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 10%. Dark brown colour, huge off-white to beige head. Aroma and flavour mainly as the first time, but I drank the beer a little colder now, and the sweetness was not overwhelming. I’m upping it a couple points. Original rating: 330 ml capped bottle. I had trouble getting the very hard cap off (no proper opener at hand), and 1/4 of the beer was driven out by the carbonation before I succeeded. Drank it at temp. appr. 14 degrees C. Beer was murky brown with floaties, large tan head. Aroma was malty sweet with prunes, figs, dates, chocolate and cedarwood. Flavour was again malty sweet with prunes, figs, dates and chocolate. No detectable bitterness. A complex beer, but too sweet to be ""perfect"" IMO.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,DanfromVan,5,"Sweet and syrupy, pretty tough to turn this down at any time . Rich complex flavour. Nice legs, perfect mouth feel. Favourite beer overall, but I would be 250 lbs if I drank it every day. 100.00 for a case of 24 that lasts me about 2 years. I reward myself with a bottle after a successful project. Sometimes you need to check on what the words ""Quality"" and ""First Class"" mean in your life. I just have to grab a bottle and am reminded that some people care about the products they produce.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Nose is rich with raisins, stewed prune, roasted cherry, rum-soaked fruit cake, fruit wood, baking spice, fruity yeast esters, and alcohol. Taste follows up front with rich, dark fruit notes, but there isn't an overwhelming sweetness here, similar to a deep molasses. Mildly bitter, tannic notes as well balance out the fruitier notes. Toasted brown bread expresses itself midpalate. On the finish, fruity, yeasty flavors carry through along with well-expressed alcohol. Mouthfeel is moderate with sharp carbonation.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,highdesertdrinker,4.64,"I luuurve this beer, dahlins. It pours a nice eggplant color with lots of head. Smells like plum, raisin, spice.

Overall, I preferred Abt 12, although both were great. The Christmas Ale was actually a touch smoother and easier to quaff. But Abt 12 had more of a potent aroma and more spiciness and depth of flavor. Really a wonderful beer overall, especially for those chilly winter nights.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

A bready aroma greets you with hints of stone fruit and booze.  Flavors of brown bread, raisins, dates, and spices explode on the palate and finish cleanly.  Mouth feel is a lighter leaning medium with excellent carbonation.  Overall a clear standard bearer for the style.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

The front end of the palette is reminiscent of yeasty whole grain bread followed by hints of molasses and warm spices. It finishes slightly bitter with hints of raisin and a touch of booziness. Mouthfeel is full with light carbonation. Overall, an outstanding example of Belgian brewing.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,papposilenus,4.51,"From an 11.2oz bottle, date stamped 04 06 24. Served in a cervoise.  Pours a deep, dark maple-brown with an enormous fat and pouffy head of foam insulation. It takes a good long time to get the whole bottle into the glass and, when I have, I could literally bite chunks out of the head. Retention is excellent, leaving a thick, foamy cap and gobs of bubbly lacing.  Aroma is warm and inviting. Reminiscent of Grandma’s kitchen, whole grain bread, molasses, cookies and tea.  Taste follows the nose, dense, under-baked whole grain bread, dark and yeasty, molasses and spice, dry wood and old tea bags. Ends with some toasty bitterness on the palate and raisiny, boozy, sweet currant fumes in the sinuses.  Feel is soft and mouth-coating, chewy but no more than medium bodied - the denseness of the palate keeps fooling my brain into thinking it’s thicker than it is and then the very bright carbonation reminds me that it is not.  Bitter and sweet, yum. I was sad when the glass was empty but at 10% abv it’s probably just as well.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Great balance and dangerously easy to drink.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Wattie83,4.44,"Poured from bottle to glass chalice. Color is deep brown with an ivory, almost khaki head. The head falls to a loose cap. Smell reminds me of me of a warm bread pudding with notes of brown sugar, malt, and candied fruit. A healthy dose of spice here too. Taste is much more balanced than the nose would suggest. Sweet entry, with raisin, fig, brown sugar up front. Middle balances out with some bitterness and a layer of hope spice. Finishes clean with a bit of alcohol bite. Feel is medium to full with decent carbonation. Overall, this is tasty. I wish the flavors were a bit bolder, but still an excellent beer all around.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,TedHead,4.45,"Pours a beautiful garnet with an ivory head that dissipates quickly. It smells like dates and raisins with hints of Carmel and brown sugar and just a slight hoppy floralness. The taste is truly incredible with hints of carmel, figs, dates, molasses, and a very slight hop bitterness to compliment the perfect amount of sweetness in this beer. It goes down incredibly smoothly and honestly it would be dangerous to not disclose the alcohol percentage to the drink. Overall truly world class.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Robinshutedrums,4.51,Dark brown beer. Reminds me of a wheet/white beer but with more body. Smells sweet and flowery. Flavours are bitter and sweet but with a light malty backbone to make it not over sweet. Lovely beer!,Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Charles_Ball_Fuller,4.65,"Look: Cloudy dark reddish-brown. No need to add to the head, the head builds quite quickly. Smell: Smells much sweeter than it tastes. Smells like dark bread and mildly of baked fruit like pears and cherries or plums. Slight aroma of baking spices. Taste: Not as sweet as it smells, much breadier; think dark bread crust, not the sweet middle. Still tastes mildly of dark fruits. Honestly reminds me of Dr. Pepper. Very pleasant, and easy to drink. The bitterness and alcohol is extremely well hidden, so it's easy to forget the 10% abv. The bitterness is negligent, making it very easy to drink more quickly as well. Feel: Medium-full bodied with thick carbonation. This makes for an exciting mouthfeel in what could otherwise be a bogging mouthfeel. Overall: Very pleasant and drinkable beer.

259,1708,JohnniEMc,4.68,"The experience begins with a pour from 25+ oz. brown cork topped bottle into a clear pint glass. A cork stopped beer, so this must be special. The posted 10% ABV is dully noted. It's a beautiful result. The beer is a bright brown with substantial biege head atop. Much less yeasty to the nose than many Belgian Quads. Instead, it's a nice harmony of malts and hops, with a hint of the yeast. Next visual notice is only a little lace follows as the head ebbs. World Class is the appropriate designation for the taste. Remarkably light for its richness and incredibly balanced between the big three; yeast, malt and hops. The alcohol contributes to the taste as well, but only as a typical five percenter, not something double that. If the often overpowering yeastiness of Belgians is offsetting, this is for you. Caveat: Be forewarned, the 10% ABV is for real, for real, regardless of how easy this one goes down.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,nick_perry,3.61,"I'm confused by all the extremely positive reviews here. I really enjoy this style, but this one just didn't impress me. Maybe I got an old or bad batch? Pours a cloudy, dark brown color. Almost no head. A little maltier than I expected. Somewhat of a pumpernickel note. I wish there were some dark fruit flavors, but there is very little in that department. No yeast flavors are present, which is also disappointing. In general, not bad, but lacks complexity and seems unbecoming of the style. Again, I'm not sure what happened here, since this is such a highly rated beer.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,SimplySinister,4.5,"A - Restrained pour into goblet producing a highly carbonated, cloudy milk chocolate colored brew. This brew presented with a sturdy 2"" ivory colored head and moderate lacing. Off to an amazing start..  S - Bread, raisin, malt, tart, chocolate, and coffee. One of the other reviewers said ""pumpernickel"". I have to give credit- I wish I could have nailed that. But totally- totally pumpernickel. Pumpernickel in the best way possible.  T - Every single aroma that came thru the nose transferred directly to the palette- and then some. This brew is confusingly complex. And no- I'm not inebriated! It's the truth. This one is hard to pin down. There are levels of flavor here that are hard to reverse engineer. I'll leave it to you to decide!  M - Thicker than I expected.  D - I have to be honest- this is an amazing beer. For so many years at home on BA I've heard the praises sung of this beer. I smirked and laughed it off. I figured the upper crust felt inclined to pontificate about their overpriced indulgences. After all, it felt like I caught them so many times before! I was wrong. This one rocks.

Occasional warmth of alcohol comes through. Definitely smelled better, which was kind of a let down. F: Very high carbonation for my taste. Medium bodied, sweet/bitter with some odd astringency.

259,1708,Shiredave,4.7,"11.2oz. bottle has a best before date of 07-03-23 I poured approx. 10.5 ounces into the goblet as the over charged bottle produced a bloom of doeskin colored foam 3 inches high. The head slumped slowly and I topped it off leaving most of the trub in the bottle. Dark, mahogany brown, some lazy carb bubbles visible and splotches of chunky lace smeared on the glass. The aroma - or should I say bouquet of this amazing ale is sumptuous. Still, I smell rich ale fruit - yeasty rising brown bread, raisins and milk chocolate, then when I swirl the glass new aromas of smoked rum, grass and wet dog. Flavor is even more complex and intriguing than the nose. Rich, fruity malt up front, notes of cherries and more raisins or figs, chocolate covered caramel all blend together deliciously. Hop flavors and bittering moves in mid swallow and wrap the tongue in a warm peppery blanket while the sweet, malt character coats the rest of the mouth in a variety of subjective ale-fruity notes. It's like but not like you took different flavored sweet tarts and mixed them with a pumpernickel bagel and some dark rum......nah.... this is way better. Body is on the soft side of full with incredible mouth feel and the 10% so well folded into the beer, it only adds and never detracts from the overall amazing flavor profile. Truly remarkable and world class example of a Belgian Grand Cru that ranks up there with Rochfort, Westmalle and Chimay.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,BelgianHops,4.71,"In my opinion even better than Westvleteren 12. It's such a beautifuly balanced beer with a strong, complex body. It's delicate and smooth.

259,1708,Ernald_Elbertson,4.57,"First Quad I've ever tried, and despite my questionable past with Belgian styles, this really delivers.  Look: Deep dark brown, only allows the smallest amount of light through. Great fluffy head, lots of carbonation which I wasn't expecting, but I'm not opposed to it.  Smell: Pretty subdued actually, mostly just a general malty smell with perhaps a hint of the Belgian yeast coming through.  Taste: Sweet, spicy, caramel, fruity, vanilla, almost like root beer even. If Stouts are the fine coffee and chocolate of the beer world, this is the craft soda. There's a great combination of dark fruits, vanilla, and something vaguely tropical (reminds me of coca-cola as well somehow). Finishes with a pleasant alcohol heat that warms you up; probably ideal for the winter as opposed to now. Will probably save the rest for that season.  Feel: Probably the highlight, feels practically like drinking hot chocolate. Comforting, thick, and warm. Best enjoyed in small sips, as it really is a lot to take in with each drink you take. The alcohol burn really actually boosts this beer quite a bit as opposed to most styles. Additionally, the beer is quite carbonated for such a high ABV, making it smooth rather than syrupy.  Overall: Pricey, but probably worth it in the end. This beer is perfect for a freezing winter night with pot roast or something like that. If you don't like Stouts or Porters, this might be worth a go as a cold weather choice. It has an entirely different flavor profile while still warming the soul.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

An interesting burnt sugar note that pairs well with dark fruits like plum. Malty sweet in the finish with a nice caramel character  Despite the dark color and bold flavor, this drinks pretty light! Does not drink like 10% at all, finishes super smooth with a perfectly attenuated sweetness  Wow, one of the best quads I've ever had, if not beers in general!

This beer was my favourite beer of all time at one point, but I do find everytime I drink it I wake up congested the next day. It's almost like there is something in the beer I have an alergy too. This also might have something to do with the fact the beer is typically only available at the LCBO in 750 ml bottles. This beer still earns an A+ in my book for the beer drinking experience. The next morning experience is another matter.

259,1708,Nugganooch,4.31,"St. Bernardus Abt 12 is a true liquid bread delight. The pour showcases a dark brownish amber looking body with a healthy stack of khaki foam head. The nose is a bouquet of dark grains, sweetened dried fruit like fig/dates/currants, subtle spices, and fresh well water. The flavors emphasize more of the same with dark malts and dark fruits at the forefront followed by a bit of dark Belgian candi sugar and a nice peppery bitterness to help cut back on all that ABV. In fact the alcohol is incredibly well disguised at the 10% bill making this dangerously delectable. There is a bit of mild spice noted and a finish of rich mineral water. Somewhat tinny at times but never so detracting from the overall balance of this fine brew. The mouthfeel is highly carbonated from the bottle conditioning that lends a frothy micro-bubble action keeping things light and airy on the palate. Really solid stuff, difficult to replicate likely. A beer to be revered over the ages.

259,1708,SierraNevallagash,4.33,"330ml (11.2oz) bottle - best before 03 03 23 - poures into s fancy tulip at 50F.  Pours a delightful deep cola brown - quite cloudy, and with ample visible effervescence. When held to the light, the ale become a bright, firey scarlet red, absolutely streaming with bubbles. The elixir is topped with four fingers of dense, foamy, khaki head that retains its shape for an eternity, eventually settling fiwn to a finger, leaving tenacious lacing in its wake. What a stunning beer.  Nose: Rich roasted malts evoke aromas of cola, prunes, raisins, figs, dates, cherries, red apple, allspice, nutmeg, dark bread, ale yeast, Belgian yeast esters, brown sugar, toffee, milk chocolate, some European spicy hops, a slight metallic note, and just the faintest whiff of funk.  Palate: I had to take a minute with this one, because after the first sip, I realised that I was dealing with something significantly more complex and nuanced than I had anticipated. This is going to be interesting. Let's begin. Upon greeting the palate, the ale carries a mild malt sweetness, with an absolute ton of maltiness. Fresh baked still soft dark bread, rum-soaked fruit cake, and cola emerge, peppered with dark spiced rum notes. An explosion of dark fruit reveals notes of prune, fermented cherry, dates, raisin, and fig. Along with these dark fruit notes comes a character I generally only find in red wine cask-aged ales - fruity, yet dry wine grape/red berry notes, with the typical fermented wine flair. This actually shifts along with the dark fruit notes to become fairly earthy, and extremely similar to the port note in a port cask-aged imperial stout. Some subtle European hop spice and earthiness pair up with this wine-like character, and the initial malt sweetness begins to fade to the background, followed closely behind by much of the dark fruit notes. Into the finish, it becomes earthy and spicy, with the earthiness coming primarily from hops, but some of that tawny port note still lingers. At this point - well into the finish - the flavour takes a turn, and it suddenly takes on the characteristics of a traditional German amber/dark lager. The caramelised bread notes, the subtle spicy hopes, and most of all, the yeast flavour takes on a lager-esqu flavour, complete with the very subtle metallic note. The cola, spice, sweetness, malt, dark fruit, and earthiness fade away, and the ale concludes with the aftertaste of European hops and a whisper of dark bread.  Mouthfeel/Body: The body is rather unique, because it's both rich and crisp at the same time. It greets the palate medium-bodied, with a very tight crispness about it. Soon after, the maltiness lends a big, soft, not-quite-chewy richness to it, pushing it close to full-bodied territory, but constantly remains balanced by a very lively fizzy effervescence. It's wet, soft, and even a bit slick upfront, but as it finishes, it dries out and becomes fairly crisp once again. There are stages where the ale is crisp, medium, and full-bodied, but it's a harmonious transition, and in the end, I would put this in the medium-bodied category. Slight acidity in the first half of the beer, which is slowly extinguished by the malt. Semi-dry finish with mild drying properties, and some slight hop resin cling. Becomes sticky around the lips. Very mild alcohol warmth from the back of the throat to below the sternum, from its 10% ABV, and fluid nature.  Overall: This is a truly fine example of nuance, and does not strike me an an ale that is easy to properly brew. There is a lot going on in here, but it's never loud or abrasive. It's soft, friendly, and comforting, offering a warm, gentle embrace, and a velvet caress. I've never had Westvleteren 12, but if it's truly significantly better than this, then that must be one spectacular beer. I hope someday to try it, but for now, this stands as the best Belgian quadruple I've had to-date.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

259,1708,MissouriMule,5,"The part of me that wants to be different (just like everyone else) strives to find some aspect of this beer to ding, to no avail. If you want a heavier, more complex, or otherwise more extreme beer, there are barleywines, imperial stouts, barrel-aged porters, and over-the-top IPAs to suit. This beer has the benefit of being a nigh perfect execution of the genre. It balances sweetness, malt, bitterness, mouthfeel, and that “skunkiness” of Northern/Central European beer to perfection. The result is a beer you can turn to regardless of mood or season with the assurance of enjoyment. It is the penultimate decathlete of suds.

I cannot comment on much about it because I was enjoying it too much to take notes. Simply the best beer that I have ever tasted. Thankfully, I'm waiting on two more bottles, so I can take notes then!!  I recently brought a 750ml bottle to a wedding that I cellared in 2019 for a special occasion.  It blew the minds of the beer lovers.  With the aged bottle compared to a fresh bottle, I'm torn because they are so different. Both are very warm, smooth, and strong.  The fresher iteration is sweeter, maltier and has a heavy fruit cake-like flavour.  The matured iteration is much more complex. It was much smoother, which I didn't think possible. It also developed an almost brandy-ish type of alcohol heat on the first taste, which gave into a fruitiness, but not sweet in the usual sense.  Whenever I try to review this beer, I just can't seem to put into words how brilliant this quad is. For me, it's hands-down better than Rochefort 10.

All-around brilliant-looking brew.  Aromas of candied figs, vanilla, plum, and toffee, all rounded with an ultra-balanced malt character; pronounced dark fruits and hints of brown sugar become more prominent on the back end; notes are all pronounced but never overwhelming.  Taste profile shows a great variety of subtle, well-rounded notes including molasses, dark fruits, raisin, plum, caramel, banana, clove, and hints of earthy spice throughout the mid-palate; bubble gum and a slight hoppiness leading through the finish that leaves a faint herbal touch.  Mouthfeel brings a medium body with heavy carbonation integrated to a great benefit on the palate; bits of spice, yeasty, and faint hops influence a uniquely dry kind of stickiness that adds weight but refrains from setting a more cloying, imbalanced tone. This is ultimately smooth, robust, very faintly boozy, and quietly deep on the palate.

T: Initially a semi-sweet malt-forward taste which evolves into a rich, fruity taste with hints of raisins and dates as it warms in my mouth. Finishes with a distinct brown sugar/molasses taste with warming alcohol that stings the tongue in the best way possible. Amazing. F: Excellent strong carbonation with a full mouthfeel that isn't too heavy. Velvety and creamy. High ABV gives a nice warming sensation.  O: No wonder why this beer is so high on the Beers of Fame list. It is rich and complex but still refreshing, even at 10% ABV. At $9.99/25.4 oz bottle, it's fairly priced.

It’s almost indescribable the amount of different tastes coming out of this beer. It’s very complex but it’s not overly complex to the point that it loses its balance.  It’s a full bodied beer, definitely getting the alcohol out of this one. It’s a little warm but not burning by any means. This would be a perfect winter beer.  This is my first Quad and I’m impressed. I’ve been a big fan of other brews by St Bernardus and this one does not disappoint.

Complex, yet well balanced, very little alcohol hotness. For my first Belgian quad, this was excellent! A full and hearty brew, not for the weak, especially if you favor this style of beer.

Beautiful five star glorious nose of prunes, brown bread, green apple, papaya, it's equally enjoyable to smell this beer as opposed to drinking it, where you're almost robbing yourself of the wonderful aroma by finishing the bottle.. I'm usually more into dubbels than quadrupels, this is my favorite example of the latter, and pretty much the only one I'm well familiar with that I'll readily buy. For the flavor I get this sharp round malty masterpiece, candi sugar seems to contribute but in only a supporting manner. Caramelized malt, strawberries and huckleberries, a flash of pear or mango, than the mild funk and strength show their hand but it's so balanced with a wintergreen pineapple loooong lasting but light refreshing finish, where the the subtle beta-linoleic Belgian hops respectfully wrangle in amongst the other powerful contenders.

259,1708,BlunderfulGuy,4.51,"Fresh bottle, served in a clean Chimay glass at around 55°F with a bbq spiced pork chop and sweet potato fry dinner on Independence Day in the Rocky Mountains.  Clear, dark reddish brown with burnt orange tints at the edges and ruby highlights in the light, several streams of bubbles visible, about a finger of tannish white head with some nice lacing and even some short legs.  Unmistakable, lightly fruity, malty Belgian quadruple. Hints of sweet cherry, plum, red grape and a smidgen of raisin, caramelized malts and sugar. Fresh. A little bit of mountain air and spring water, but maybe that's from the fresh mountain air and rain clouds coming in.  Same, unmistakably Belgian-y quadruple. Follows the aroma exactly, but with a little less fruit and a little bit more semi-dry red wine character (almost a hint of Cabernet Sauvignon). The spiciness of the yeast comes through very well, as does some minerality from, I can only imagine, crisp Belgian water and good barley. Pleasant alcohol warmth in the finish with a bit of sweet fruitiness and even some dry, brown (but noticeable) hops in every second or third sip. Towards the end of the glass, there's a tinge of some, well, almost ""off"" note that isn't a buttery flavor, definitely not cardboard, perhaps a slight cocoa butter and dried pluot something-or-other. Interesting, not off-putting at all.  Fairly full-bodied, creamy, a little fluffy, rich but not too rich. Exactly how it should be. Scrubs the palate very well during a meal.  Overall more drinkable than I was expecting, not quite as fruit-forward or richly malty as I was hoping, yet in another way exactly what I was expecting. Pretty much perfect.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

A little zing of alcohol, but it's not overpowering. Flavor is complex and well balanced, but could have a little more pizzazz, ala Chimay Grande Reserve.  Feel - Medium body, lively carbonation, and a sinus clearing alcohol wash when swallowed. Not the best feeling beer, but it goes ok with the taste.

Taste is an excellent balance of toasted, caramel malt, chocolate and estery/dark fruits, with notes of banana, raisin and fig, hints of estery spice, with notes of clove and licorice, as well as hints of floral hops as well. Finishes with a medium sweetness and some chocolate, dark fruit and estery spice lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a rich body and medium carbonation.  This certainly makes for a very enjoyable and well-balanced Quadrupel, which focusses a bit more on the estery fruit and spice than dark fruits and chocolate, although the malts are a little too toasted and the hops a little to floral for my personal taste, with a good spiciness and bitterness, although the body and mouthfeel don't feel quite as rich as with its contemporaries.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Holding it up to the light, the beer has good clarity and ample carbonation. Head retention is decent, with the large froth subsiding fairly quickly. Lacing was minimal.  S: Ah, Trappist...er...Abbey. Great abbey beer. Sweet malt, fruit candy (banana and orange taffy), alcohol sweetness, baked Christmas bread.  T: Sweet up front. Phenolic . Peppery, fruity notes intermingle with a slight herbal note. Mid palate picks up the alcohol heat and rounded fruity notes. Belgian yeast plays more here with an ever so slight barnyard and fruit candy (I get a lot of banana runt here). Malt notes are again with the slightly sweet Christmas bread. Finish picks up more of the alcohol heat with a slightly spicy/peppery note on the back end. Finish is dry but warming.  M: Lighter in body than the abv would have you believe. Fine carbonation does a great job at balancing the modest (for the abv) malt body and alcohol warmth. Balanced and light on its feet for 10%.  O: I've been drinking too much American beer lately. This is good, great even. But I feel like the subtleties compared to US beers of similar strength are a bit of a weakness.

259,1708,SaltofOH,4.58,"330 ml bottle best by 1-10-20. CBF Tulip.  A: pours a deep brown with 2 fingers foamy, sandy head, and roiling carbonation.  S: cherries! Sweet, complex fruit, cherries, plums, bright, lively and sweet. Caramel and a hint of white grape.  T: mildly sweet, phenolic and fruity arrival, alcohol and chocolate toffee. Like a tootsie pop. Not as sweet as I would have expected; perhaps the least sweet Belgian dark ale I've had (which is not saying much).  M: lighter than expected; midweight and highly carbonated. Very clean finishing, remarkably so.  O: this is dangerous beer. It is loaded with complex fruity aromas and flavors. Alcohol is present, but not unpleasant. Dangerously drinkable for something of this strength. This could be a yearly tradition, for sure. Clearly a best in class performance.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

A: Lots of dark dried fruits, figs, plums, dates, raisins, toffee, Belgian yeast, slight dark red wine aroma as well, no alcohol on the nose at all, smells amazing.  T: Loads of Belgian yeast notes, malty, toffee, caramel, brown sugar, banana as well as some sweet dark fruits, apple, pear, very complex and deep, alcohol is slight there at the end and becomes more present as the beer warms, moderate amount of bitterness, finish has lingering notes of Belgian yeast and banana, very nice full flavor.  M: Full bodied with a lot of carbonation that rolls over the palate, finish is slightly dry, and there is a slight alcohol burn as the beer warms.  O: A very tasty beer, it's like liquid raisin bread with Belgian yeast added, world class mouthfeel and taste, definitely know where to go for a big beer that's a sipper.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

But there was one perfumey/room cleaner aroma I got at the end of the glass that was really weird and disgusting.  Taste: malty and vinous, rich and sweet with a touch of belgian hops to counteract those notes.  Mouthfeel: no alcohol detected, smooth and full bodied. Surprisingly dry finish given all the sweetness involved.  Overall: really nice brew. Only let down was that artificial perfumey aroma at the end of the glass.

259,1708,Thomas_Wikman,4.65,"What struck me first is how similar the taste is to a Westvleteren no 12 (which I've had many times). I did not do a side by side test, but I think St. Bernadus Abt 12 is a bit more boozy and prickly than a Westvleteren no 12. In any case this is an outstanding Quadruple. If I do a side-by-side test I'll update.  Look: Cloudy dark brown with a thick fluffy mocca head.  Aroma: raisin bread, figs, very nice aroma  Taste: the flavor is sweet dark raisin bread and dark fruits perhaps figs, it's complex, and there is a soft rum like booziness.  Feel: full bodied, slightly boozy, silky",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Smell: Sticky sweet on the nose. Notes of fresh baked raisin bread, dried figs, dates, brown sugars, plum, light burnt bread notes, wet leaves,cinnamon, and a pronounced alcohol note.  Taste: Rum soaked raisin bread on the attack. Then the body builds with notes of date cake, honey covered baked figs, vanilla extract, cloves, musty forest floor, and pecans. The finish is dry with more baked whole wheat bread notes with a hint of molasses.  Feel: Big bodied and sticky on the palate. Boozy alcohol. Soft carbonation. Body is quenching but the finish is bone dry.  Overall: A big brew. It looks, tastes, and sits in the stomach like a whole loaf of raisin bread. It is delicious and full of complimentary notes. However, it could use a bit more carbonation. Also, it’s a small gripe but it’s a seriously ugly beer to look at.

You wouldn't think this beer was 10% and for that I applaud this beer. But I would have liked it thicker such as what you'd get with blue Chimmay. I got flavors of chocolate, figs, dates, and nuts but is so watery that the flavors are subtle.

It’s amazing how the brewers can coax out such a depth of flavors without the use of barrels or a long list of adjuncts. Unbelievable.  Bottle aged two years in appropriate conditions, still within BB date. Dark amber, brownish pour with a sumptuous head that lingers all day.  Aroma is dried, earthy fruit - fig, date, raisin, plum - with sweet undertones of freshly baked bread sprinkled with brown sugar. Mouth watering.  Taste is spot on - fig, dates, brown bread, plum, raisin, caramel, brown sugar. Wow. True depth of character.  Thick, chewy, heavy on the palate. Warmth not heat from the ABV. World class sipper.

Overall: Incredibly smooth and easy drinking, with the complexity of a world class quad.

Wonderful complexity without being difficult to approach. Mouth feel is medium-thick, with a pleasant velvety texture. Overall, a wonderful quadruple ale that provides world class complexity in an extremely approachable fashion. It's delicious through and through, providing a wonderful experience.

A caramel and grape combined with plum and almost a licorice spice to it. A lovely malt flavor to it also. More dark fruits and even some apple is detectable. Lovely.

Velvety, creamy mouthfeel with an almost burning alcohol presence that detracts a little from the spicy, fruity flavors. Dessert in a glass. The best Belgian beer I've had to date  93/100  EDIT (5/28/18):  Had on tap at Six Degrees North in Edinburgh. Raspberries up the wazoo, both in aromas and flavors, this time around. Love it. Less fluffiness in the mouthfeel, but that's ok  EDIT(10/25/18): Finally trying this side by side Rochefort 10. Appearances are roughly the same, with marginally better head retention and lacing on the Rochefort 10. As noted last time, raspberry dominates the aromas, with some doughy maltiness and fruity yeast ester. Flavors of banana bread, caramel, fig, prune, raspberry, currant, and dusty earthiness.

259,1708,Lone_Freighter,4.24,"This was poured into a chalice. The appearance was a dark brown close to black color with a slim finger’s worth of head that quickly dissipated. There wasn’t much lacing. The smell had some sweet dark fruits - fig, raisin, prune with a light touch of warming cocoa. Light breadiness with some Belgian spices round it out. Light sweet apple comes in nicely. The taste was moderately sweet with the breadiness gracing in and around the previously mentioned flavors. Gentle sweet to spicy aftertaste slides into the finish. That ""deep throatiness"" I normally get seems to be contained a bit, really nice. On the palate, this one sits about a medium on the body in the front of my tongue but seems to get that ""heavier"" feel as it runs to the back of my tongue. Still good.

L - dark brown, raisiny; creamy off-white head that dissipates quickly S & T - raising yeasty wholewheat breaddough; raisins; honey on toast F - not as boozy as the XII; creamy, smooth  O - this seems to be an slightly less 'full'-flavored version of the Westie 12, trading the punch-in-the-face fullness of flavors for a more harmoniously balanced brew. It's less boozy, and despite the ABV, almost sessionable in how easily drinkable it is. Solid brew, but I personally preferred the Westvleteren.

Pours a two-finger head that quickly dissipates. The lacing is fine throughout, though somewhat underwhelming. The color and appearance is otherwise spot-on for a Quad--garnet hued and hazy bordering on cloudy.  The nose is vinous and supple, with unique fruit components for the style. Berry and dried fruit are welcome and expected components, but there is a clear grape and citrus component as well. Unique and crisp to the nose.  The taste is quintessential Belgian abbey ale. Sweet fruity malts, with a strong dark fruit component, balanced by tart cherry and wine notes. And then the yeast---oh damn, the yeast. It's just perfect. I give up. You have to try it.  The mouthfeel is, i a word--balance. Thick, viscous and vinous in its initial presentation, but like other offerings from this brewer, it is just carbonated and boozy enough to keep things remarkably light for such a heavy ABV.

I'm so glad this one marks this milestone for me...  Picked this up at a bar in Pasadena and I was so happy my son had picked it for me. It showed up as a beautifully dark beer, with frothy head and lacing that stuck to the glass all way down. The smell was fruity, without be a fruit beer, malty without being overpowering, and a light touch of hops just to let you know there was more to this beer once you would bring it to your lips. And at 10%, it did not have that distinctive tang to the nose that comes with the high alcohol content. Mouthfeel was smooth, medium-bodied and dangerously drinkable. Though there was definitely a booziness to the taste, it wasn't overpowering as other high-alcohol beers provide - it was a perfect blend of fruity taste and booze that makes me with now I had had a second one.

Raising the glass to our nares the intense complexity of the Abt 12 begins to come alive with a bright and grainy scent that filled the olfactory with pleasure. Swigging a mouthful, the tastes of bread pudding, caramel, grains, and a hint of hops rush across the tongue in tidal wave of flavor. As we settle into the beer a pleasant, medium viscosity mouth feel is established, followed by a potent yet refreshing balance of banana, toffee, and dried fruit ester. At 10% ABV, the Abt 12 packs a hearty, warm rush in less than 12oz. Nearing the bottom of the chalice, with plenty of head still chasing the beer down the glass, the taste of black current swirls with a mixture of fresh farmhouse scent, leaving us both satisfied a mildly drunk. It is a fantastic beer for anyone hoping to enjoy an authentic, high quality Belgian beer, that would make an Abbey proud.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

259,1708,Everydayoff,4.56,"330ml bottle poured into a snifter.  Cloudy dark burgundy brown in color with thick silky light tan head that withstands with good retention before slowly collapsing to an eternal foamy layer on the surface that doesn’t go anywhere until the last sip and leaving fair amount of lacing patch and spot on the glass-side.  Very inviting and enticing aroma of mellow, yet tart and sharp fruity ester with notes of ripe banana, grape, berry, fig, date, prune, and plum. There are also notes of orange peel, candy sugar, molasses, licorice, spicy alcohol, coriander spice, and peppery while malt is also there so upright with its bread, vanilla cream, caramel, and buttery toffee while hop exhibits with some earthy and herbal touch.  The taste is displayed what reflects in the aroma with all those goodness and tasty flavors ranging from mellow, yet tart and sharp fruity ester with notes of ripe banana, grape, berry, fig, date, prune, and plum, as well as orange peel, candy sugar, molasses, licorice, spicy alcohol, coriander spice, and peppery while malt is also there still so upright with its bread, vanilla cream, caramel, and buttery toffee while hop exhibits with some earthy, herbal, and bitter kick in the finish.  Full body with some bold touch through the palate but it is not that too syrupy or sticky with proper amount of body, carbonation is rather low but it is crisp enough to carry all the things well under the smooth mouthfeel. Finish is very pleasantly dry that will quickly lead to the next instant sip.  There are lots of thing going on and changing all along the tasting, from smooth to a bit sharp, from simply tasty to sheer complexity, and from good to truly great.

I can't quite see the carbonation in this dim light but I can see lots of floaties. The aroma is overall very sweet and there is lots of dark dried fruit and an alcohol hit that together reminds me of rum raisin ice cream, without the cream part. In the flavor, quite sweet but there is a red wine like bitterness that keeps that sweetness in check. Lots of dark dried raisins, figs, plums, and prunes. A very Alka-Seltzer like carbonation, tight. Which really works for this style, to me. Very dry but a little sticky on the lips, and medium full bodied.

Overall I know this is a classic, but I just cannot get behind it. While I love big, bold, sweet beers, this one is somehow too sweet - like there is never enough booziness to balance of the sweet.

259,1708,Pundit_of_Potability,4.6,"This quad pours a nice dark chocolate cover with a huge 3 finger head and tons of sticky lacing when sipped. It smells of yeast and sweet malts. The first sip surprises: its not as tart/sweet as other quads out there (Sam Adams quad and Ommegang's Three Philosophers both empasize fruit), with a heavier emphasis on roasted malts with a slightly bitter finish. Dark chocolate malt flavor, with some nice caramel, molasses, nuttiness and plummy sweetness and breadiness from the yeast. The carbonation is high, but not as high as some other quads I have had, and the ale is rich and creamy. This is delicious, and at $11.99 for a big boy bottle, well worth the buy. There is a reason St Bernardus is considered one of the best beer-makers in the world. This one didn't blow my mind, but it was fulfilling, potable and enjoyable. If I had the patience to age my beers a little, I wonder how that might change the character. I'm told it gets better with age.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

259,1708,breezyday,4.88,"This is my go to beer when it comes to having a great Quad (Belgium/Americans are getting there). It has a delicious faint sweet dark roasted malty taste with huge smells and flavors of fig, prunes and malt. The feel in your mouth is also very distinct as it is smooth, but thicker than most any American attempt at Quads w/ the craft beer industry boom in the United States. It is an exceptional beer with a hearty beef, chicken, pork and potatoes meal. This beer actually has more subtle dark fruit, malt and light spice flavors tastes and aromas appear as it warms from the refrigerator. Thus, it actually tastes even better then when you first start drinking it. I highly recommend this beer to Americans who want to know what a quality 'Quadruple' beer is all about. I also recommend if you are a Costco member to look for it. In the Dallas, Texas area this beer is $2 cheaper than any store I have found it stocked. In other words, this beer is a bargain at Costco...and actually anywhere you can find it is a great Belgium Trappist beer that is hard to match and compare when coming to taste, texture, smell and overall pleasure.

259,1708,gregy55902,4.5,"Excellent stuff here. Poured very gently so this wouldn't overflow my snifter (I know it is highly carbonated from previous experiences!), and this yielded a very dark beer with carbonation streaming up the side of the glass. Nice 1-finger off-white head that recedes leaving nice bubbles and lacing.  Aroma is a classic combination of dark fruits - plums, figs, dates, cherries. Some dark malts, bready yeast and faint herbal hops in there as well.  Taste follows the nose - very smooth blend of dark fruits and malts. The harder water they used also makes an appearance here. Not mind-blowingly complex, but very good and smooth. Nice dark fruit characteristics and a hint of spice from the yeast.  Feel is smooth, abv is well-hidden. A bit of bite from the carbonation, but it feels lively in the mouth. Coats the tongue with delicious flavors!  Overall it's a very solid, relatively inexpensive, easy to get, yet high-quality authentic belgian quad. It reminds me a lot of the quad I made a few months ago that claimed to clone Westy 12 (got another batch of it in secondary - *rubs hands with glee*).

Has a lot of complexity, perhaps overshadowed a bit by the booze within. I'm getting figs and viney notes, with firm hits of molasses, some smoked ham, plum, peated malt, and then the booze creeps in and smacks hard, ending on booze drenched grapes and some flecks of citrus.  Feel is hot, with stinging carbonation and a dry dusty finish.  Overall, St. Bernardus' Abt 12 isn't the white pony it's played up to be; rather it's a decent Quad with some interesting qualities going for it (the smoked ham, the peat, the boozy grapes).

It smells pleasant, but honestly doesn't have a strong odor, looks darker than I remember. $5 for one 12 Oz bottle was a bit much, but I got 3 others just in case :) Tastes a little too much like tree bark to me. I'm sure there's a fancy way to say that, but I don't know it. Taste is the most important thing to me, so that brings it down overall quite a bit.

259,1708,FLima,4.54,"One of the first craft beers I had. I had no idea what to expect on that one, simply it was tagged to check my beer list. I recall it was a shock; it was very much different to main stream and other more regular ales. Back then I had both Abt.12 and Rochefort 10 at the very same day. I recall well, I preferred the former. I would do the same experience this weekend. This one I have been cellaring for 3 years. Now on to the beer. It poured a hazy brown color with a thick dark beige head with good retention. Nice aroma with notes of creamy chocolate, prunes, figs, mild vanilla, some banana, cinnamon and red wine (without the alcohol). Delicious flavor with notes of chocolate mousse, cocoa, lots of spices (cinnamon, ginger, cloves, white pepper), plums, mint, figs, molasses, grapes, noble hops, pear juice, some banana, candi sugar, raspberries, coconut, blueberries, licorice and black currants. Amazingly no evident booze, just some Brandy flavor. Dry aftertaste with a medium bitterness. Full body with appropriate carbonation of tiny fellows. Neither syrupy nor heavy. Alcohol of 10% abv is superbly well hidden. I love this beer, utterly satisfying. It is very complex and still the myriad of flavors are subtle enough not to overshadow each other. It does not fell heavy at all; you don’t have to sip very small quantities at a time. I see this at the same level of the Westvleteren; I still need to drink both with the same aging and at the same time to state which one is better.

Notes of sweet dried plums, raisins, brown sugar, rich dark malts, and some spice.  Taste is just incredible. Initially there is some sweet plums, prunes, raisins, dark stone fruit and brown sugar. As the flavors linger on the tongue they mellow out into a lovely array of smooth oak, dark fruit and leather and brown sugar.  Feel is spot on for a quad. Fizzy carbonation.

259,1708,archyquaffer,4.53,"A semi-aggressive pour from the magnum bottle into a clear glass chalice produces a short, creamy, tan colored head that recedes but never disappears, leaving attractive rings of lace. The beer is a deep, ruby highlighted brown, with a swirl of carbonation in the center of the glass. I don't think I've experienced a more beautiful lace pattern, with swirls of more viscous foam separating itself from the rest in a spiral pattern like some sort of beery galaxy.  The first thing I get in the aroma is a whiff of pleasant DMS of a subtle vegetal quality. As I taste, and as the beer warms, the malt aromas become more rich, showcasing dark fruit and caramelized sugars. The flavor is rich, fruity and mineral-laden, with notes of plums, dark cherries, plums, black currants, caramel, and subtle hints suggestive of fortified wine. Balancing the fruity and vinous notes is an earthy bitterness that lends to the vinous notes. The ABV is hidden except for some very slight medicinal notes which complement the other flavors nicely.  This beer is living up to my high expectations. I had never seen it around here until recently, when I purchased a bottle for $12.19 (cheap!) at Front St. Market in Butte, Montana.

The taste follows, adding rich layers of vanilla ice cream, banana chips, fig, cherry, clove, brown sugar, and rum. Mouthfeel is thick, but still carries a pleasant buzz of carbonation.  Note that despite its drinkability, this is a true sipper that only improves as it approaches room temperature.

259,1708,LostDog13,4.66,"This has a very fruity aroma, but does not come across overly sweet. It is a heavier, dark Belgian quad with a higher abv. I prefer to drink this slowly in a tulip style glass, and allow the flavors to enhance as the beer warms up. Definitely a beer that is to be enjoyed and appreciated. Dark and creamy beer that is sweet without being too sweet or overwhelming. The high abv is noticeable, but doesn't overpower the wonderful flavors.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Squire,4.09,"Dark reddish brown color with good cap and lacing.  Complex aroma of clean yeast with floral hops and more than a hint of spice.  Flavor is surprisingly complex. There is an element of dark or roasted malt yet no hint of bitterness, rather a smooth transition between depth of flavor with the lighter elements of sweet bread yeast and indefinable yet present spices. I will say dark fruits such as figs, dates or dark plums but not so much here as I've noticed in other Belgian Quads. I mean they're in there but so well blended together nothing stands out so much as everything melds seamlessly together. Flavors are consistent to the finish and linger just a bit in the aftertaste.  Medium full texture with balancing carbonation.  Ok, it's 10% which makes it whopping strong for a beer. Yet it doesn't seem so, rather a pleasant food accompaniment sort of drink with remarkably fresh vivid flavors that are not so strong as to overwhelm any but the lightest of dishes.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

No alcoholic tones nor fruity profiles. T: The taste is very rich, raisins, blueberries, blackberries and the alcoholic end to it. But very nice! M: The body is medium to high but the carbonation seems too harsh, probably due to the bad maintenance of the keg. O: This was drank on draft, and I have never had this beer on bottle.

259,1708,davidperez,4.19,"I got this bottle a few weeks ago, and it is only months fresh. Nevertheless I'll have it and compare afterwards with an aged one.  Served in a Chimay chalice, it pours a very dark brown with a two-finger head, of a light brown, with some retention.  The bouquet is very sweet. Aromas of toffee, brown sugar, slight hint of vanilla, cinnamon, a little booze, prune and raisins.  The taste is quite intriguing. It starts with a nice balance and notes of prunes, raisins and cherry. Short after, phenols, a medicine-like flavor arises, and the malty backbone enters mildly as well. Clove is definitely present all throughout the flavor, and so is the alcohol, which gives a bit of a wine-like taste to the beer. The aftertaste is long and predominantly sweet, it lingers very pleasantly. Medium to full body, very smooth. Superb balance.  I'm eager to taste how this beer ages. As of now, the phenols and the alcohol are very high. Excellent beer notwithstanding.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Very good rounded taste on this beer the taste is just amazing.everything I feel is done right with balancing the flavours, the high alchol is very little noticable in this beer  O: Nothing more to say than this is one of the best quadruples that is .

F- Medium body, with lots of carbonation as stated in the appearance. YMMV.  O- This beer is definitely one of the better quads out there.

Looks beautiful. S: Bready, some tanginess, maybe some mild spices but not overpowering at all. T: This was my ""5"". The aroma combines with the taste to produce a beer that's so thoroughly simple, yet complex at the same time. I enjoyed this beer the first time with a steak, potato, and some fresh-baked bread and I was in heaven 2.0 - It's flavor is a mixture of some natural sweetness from raisins, maybe dates, cinamin, and maybe a touch of clove. It's yeasty malt and just goes does well and given the high ABV, is just delightful. F: It's not overly effervescent but not flat by any means. It's heavy, yet light, and the only reason I marked it down a half a point is that it is a little hot. No so much that it was unpleasantly so, just that I could feel it.  O: Overall a word-class Belgian beer worthy of recognition. Not so much that anything heavily stands out, but rather that is so good withOUT anything standing out. It's even better with the right food so watch your pairings. Don't go trying to drink this with you sushi or something ridiculous. This is a hearty, delicious meal in bottle as it is and deserves to be paired with a meat and potatoes (or brown rice of pilaf) meal - or if it's not mealtime, stick to the best cheese, quality sourdough breads and pretzels, and maybe some figs or other dried fruits.

259,1708,Beginner2,4.51,"Learning its trade from the Trappists, St Bernardus produces only a few ales... all probably with an average rating close to excellent. (I've have 7 of St Bernardus' 11 listed on BA.) It seems as if St. Bernardus is the Trappist artform of brewing in commercial form. That, to me, explains why their ales are so consistently good.  12 is so well made and so highly regarded, it doesn't need my review. But even better than its rival Chimay Blue, 12 lets me transcend the Trappist tendency for bubbles. This is a truly great ale inside.  Reviewed in Roger Protz' ""300 More Beers To Try Before You Die"", a sequel to his CAMRA classic. He spends two full pages on the brewery's 3 most popular ales and its relations with the Westvlerten Trappists. MJ's ""Great Beers of Belgium"" puts these Trappist ales in perspective. Of 12, he says ""almost ebony in colour, even bigger and more assertive, like a warming coconut brandy."" (I don't get the coconut, but that's why MJ is MJ and I'm not.) 12 also is reviewed in ""The 1001"" and most certainly deserves to be there. Truly, one of the great beers of the world. When you think the world is not blessed, savor a 12.  5/9/20 Had again. Revised review. Then, embellished it a bit. Increased rating for Looks and Smells. I'm satisfied.

I''d describe the beer as a (complex) fruity Belgium style beer.

There is a plethora of small, yeast particles that are floating through the beer. I should have poured gently. Oops. A moderate amount of medium-sized rising bubbles remain once the foam head settles. Lacing is thin and moderate. SMELL: Strong aromas of figs, plums, and brown sugar deliciously combine with mild aromas of toast and bananas and subtle clove and earthy hop aromas. The 10% alcohol can barely be detected. TASTE: The first flavors to strike the palate are of strong brown sugar quickly followed by strong fig and plum flavors. Strong clove flavors enter next along with subtle flavors of toast. Subtle flavors of banana, earthy hops, and hints of alcohol debut lastly as all previous flavors persist, except for toast, which grow slightly stronger. FEEL: Full-bodied and highly carbonated carbonated. Goes down somewhat rough. Finishes with a strong dryness. A mild and welcoming alcohol warmth can be felt as it goes down the throat. NOTE: An exceptional beer, to say the least. The clove flavors were more perceived in taste than their aromas, which did somewhat bother me.

My favorite currently is Rochefort 10. I heard good things about this one, I am giving it a try.  Look: Pours frothy and dark brown with minimal head into its own St. Bernardus Watou glass. Looks similar to Rochefort 10 minus the chunks of yeasties.  Smell: I sense the alcohol almost immediately. This smells similar to Rochefort, also. I am getting the dark fruit hints here and there. Not a lot of it, as the alcohol is dominant.  Taste: Heavy carbonation, tongue numbing but welcoming. Surprisingly smooth in flavor, tiny bitterness, followed by a little spiciness, tiny bit of dark fruits on the back of the palette that hits the back of the throat. Very nice quad presence.  Feel: heavy carbonation that surprisingly goes away fast, strong alcohol presence but surprisingly smooth with that being said.   Overall: A really good quad, but not my favorite. I still give it to Rochefort 10 for my favorite ale. Rochefort delivers so much complexity I love in a quad, all the hints of raisin, plums, alcohol presence and deliciousness.

It continues to be sweet with some slight fruity taste. At the end you get some of the alcohol on the tongue, but not as much as you would expect from a beer with 10% abv.

259,1708,aleigator,3.71,"Pours an ember-brown color, with a fluffy, big head, collapsing to a spider web lacing.  Smells of warmed walnut shell among molasses and bakers chocolate. The aromas reveal a hot peak within a profound rock sugar coating, getting wrapped up by moldy earth and mellowed toffee. Its nutty qualities are distinguishable in the most pleasant way, featuring a spicy cardamon note, together with freshly cracked walnuts and heated chestnut, blending perfectly into earthy malts.  Has a lower carbonation, while the mouthfeel is surprisingly thin till the finish, in which its rich maltiness unfolds its true potential.  Begins with rock sugar from the very beginning, balanced by dusty earth and walnut. A watery quality evolves, going along with the malts, while the flavors do not change at all until after the swallow. A warming spice punch becomes detectable out of nowhere, while the initial rock sugar quality returns in an alcohol soaked fashion, balanced by bakers chocolate and licorice. Dried orange peel, spruce and clove add depth to rock sugar and molasses, while the beer finishes clean, with a gentle bitterness of matured hops and dough bread.  This one I kept in the cellar for about a year, in hopes of this might be smoothing out a bit. While its maltiness doubtlessly is well accentuated, there is not much going on, apart from an overly pungent, boozy sugar quality. For being recognizably full-bodied, its mouthfeel is a bit too thin for me, especially when compared to a stout in the same abv region.

T- As the smell, with fruit and maillard (is this kettle caramelized?) up front. There's an acidity here that keeps good balance, and it finishes dry, just like it should. There's more of the rummy, brown sugar flavor in the end at the same time.  F- it's weird when a beer is both effervescent and creamy, but I wouldn't sacrifice either.

Bananas and milk chocolate.  -Flavor: Immediately you get the malt and yeast backbone of this beer. You get the bananas as the nose suggested you would, and what I surmised would be the case given my past experience with Belgians. Also get some nuttyness from the malt, hazelnuts which kinda lends it to the chocolate I got on the bouquet. Toasty bread and Allspice notes in there as well. Finishing with a slight bitterness from the hops. My favorite part of this brew is its super smooth mouth-feel.  -Rating: 2.5/5: Not as boozy as I expected from a beer with a 10% ABV. Especially with my past experience with high ABV Belgians. Still has the fruitiness that I’m pretty sure comes with the Belgian yeast and I’m still not a fan. All in all it’s a pretty balanced beer.

259,1708,JNPIII127,5,Pours a dark brown to amber color with excellent head. The beer leaves great lacing in the glass and goes down very smoothly. Hides the high alcohol content very well. Overall a great beer.,Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,D-Rock,4.13,"Poured from a pint cork and cage bottle into a tall tulip style glass.  Look: First impression as I slosh the beer into the glass is the voluminous off white/tan head that foams up, taking up about a quarter of the glass. The beer itself is a deep tan to brown with ruby red tinge. Carbonation bubbles constantly stream towards the surface while flecks of lacing cling delicately to the sides of the glass as the head slowly settles, never going away completely. Skipping ahead, in the final pour of the bottle a lot of yeasty sediment clouds the brew making it nearly opaque.  Smell: The smell belies the look here with a dusty odor, slightly musty and somewhat leaning towards clove. A hint of booziness accompanies it all.  Taste: As soon as the beer hits the mouth the taste opens up with a dry-grain cracker flavor immediately melting into sweet sweet maltiness. Undercurrents of sweet honey mingle with the malt character. The finish is dry and smooth and fades back into dry cracker. The flavor is big and bold and the alcohol is present but resides in the background dancing about the very sweet malt. Each sip invites another and leaves me puzzling over the flavors.  Feel: The carbonation is high but the mouthfeel is silky smooth, velvety even. The high malt character and 10 % ABV makes for a heady ale with some real heft to it. There is something irresistible to the feel here and I cant help but take another sip and mull it over.  Overall: This is a big, bold and unapologetic brew, heavy, malty and sweet, there is a lot of complex scent and flavor going on here. The phenolic character plays a big role and forms the backbone of this powerful complex brew, the malt fills out the body of the beer in an exceptional synergy of flavor. This is one of the big ones, a classic Belgian ale and a timeless style.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

A little apple/pear and more banana as it warmed. T - More spicy than the aroma, some cloviness. Not much else right out of the fridge. But as it got warmer it really blossomed. More sweetness, bitterness, tartness. Like a hint of tart cherry, bread crust. Surprisingly bitter after taste. F - Not as heavy as I expected. Damn near refreshing. Ample carbonation. O - Highly rated, and rightly so.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

259,1708,plaidowl,4.41,"I can describe this beer as seeming heavy and light, rich and refreshing, simultaneously. There's rich complexity to the malty flavor, yet it's crisp and clean, leaving just a hint of bitterness that fades quickly. Like the other reviewers have said, the alcohol content does not emerge into the flavor. The color is the beautiful mahogany red of other beers that sit a bit heavier and satisfy sooner than this one does; I can drink more of this beautiful beer than other darker offerings. The aroma is slight, but pleasant, and the head foams up quite a bit, initially, but quickly recedes. And, even though it has a low carbonation, it resists feeling flat, even when left unattended for a time. And it tastes as good when ice cold as it does when nearing room temperature; that's a multifaceted, quality brew! And you can pop the cork like champagne!  Recommend pairing it with beef and chocolate.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Brown sugar, dates, demerara, nutty caramel. Tastes like dark fruits, figs, dates, slight nuttiness, a faint spice palate of nutmeg, anise, allspice, but a slightly metallic flavor towards the finish disrupts. Tastes better and more flavorful as it warms. Quite a bit fizzier and thinner on the palate than I expected, especially for a quad. Very drinkable- a quad that isn't necessarily a sipper.

Like a (well filtered) homebrew, there's just a few 'meatier' brown drops at the end of the pour. Head is short-lived.....virtually all gone in a few seconds. Taste is thick, syrupy sweet malt. Resiny on the tongue, dry on the throat. As only the second quad I've had (Trappist 10 being the other) I'm apparently just not a fan of something THIS sweet. Diabetes in a bottle.

Abbey ale brewed in the classic 'Quadrupel' style of Belgium's best Abbey Ales. Dark with a full, ivory-colored head. It has a fruity aroma, full of complex flavours and excels because of its long bittersweet finish with a hoppy bite. (10,0% ABV) Worldwide seen as one of the best beers in the world. It's a very balanced beer, with a full-bodied taste and a perfect equilibrium between malty, bitter and sweet. One of the original recipes from the days of license-brewing for the Trappist monks of Westvleteren.  Appearance: Very dark brown, almost black. Very deep red tinge when held up to light. Creamy cappuccino coloured head, starts off at 2 fingers then drops off to just keeping beer completely covered. Leaves lacing on side of glass. Lively, noisy carbonation that pushes the beer around the glass, moving the head.  Aroma: Vanilla, ripe banana, alcohol, Christmas pudding, sherry, candy floss, toffee apple, chocolate, alcohol, damp wood in forest, dark fruit, sweet candy,  Taste: Figs, slightly metallic, alcohol, sweet. - Going to let sit to increase temperature and release more flavours. As it’s warming up the metallic taste has gone and has developed a lovely big hit of black liquorice along with all of the flavours that are present in the aroma. Beer has really come alive now it’s a little warmer. Bottle suggests 8-12 deg.C. Checked with thermometer, temperature now 18 deg.C.very enjoyable at this temperature. Strong taste of bananas in the middle from the yeast. Can feel a little alcohol burn in the finish now, but in a nice warming way and a brandy taste which fades out slowly. Beer now at 20 deg. C. and tasting fantastic.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, think and creamy. Full bodied with lively, prickly carbonation. Dry in the finish.  Overall: A fantastic quadruple from Belgium, one of my favourite beers yet. 10/10.   St. Bernardus Abt 12 – UPDATE: 30.03.2016 330ml bottle - Bottled 30.01.15 (1 year old)  Served at cellar temperature of 15 deg C.

S: 4.5 Textbook quad right off the bat with lost esters, mostly bringing roasted banana and clove. Some salted caramel works its way in as well followed by toffee and dried cherries.  T: 4.5 While the nose is a touch muted and pretty standard for a quad, the flavor is where things really open up. It has the same qualities as the nose (as do most good quads), but there’s also a darker, earthy component that really compliments the sweeter, caramelized flavors. It’s endlessly complex making it a joy to drink. The only flaw is that it’s a touch boozy on the finish.  M: 4.75 Great body and perfect carbonation with a slightly tannic finish.  O: 4.5 One of my favorite quads, right up there with Chimay and Rochefort and maybe even a bit better. Perhaps my favorite quality of this beer is how much it develops as it warms, much like a great stout; excellent right out of the fridge, but gets better every minute.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Luxurious offwhite head, decent lacing.  Smell: bread pudding, brandy, figs, caramel, wheat ale, candi sugar, nutmeg.  Taste: just fantastic. Sweet up front, but with a pronounced savory aspect, like chocolate-covered bacon. I get maple syrup, vanilla, brandy, figs, molasses...

Feel: a bit fizzy, light to medium, dryish finish. I think I'd actually like this better with about 10% less carbonation.

259,1708,Apellonious,4.08,"12 bottle best by Jan 16 2019 poured into a tulip glass.  A - Murky, dark brown with ruby highlights. Two finger clear white head that moves to a half finger lace. Active carbonation on the pour, and visible sediment in the glass.  S - Grape, fig, booze, clove/spice  T - I must have a palate problem. Having a hard time picking things out at first. Clove, banana and grape qualities, toasted malt. Opens up more as it gets warm (I let it sit at 20m at room temp, maybe it should have been longer)  M - Almost has a champagne/white wine feel to it. Carbonation is high, sits medium light in the mouth, and finished dry.  O - Admittedly, I have not drank many quads to compare, and will probably come back to this one, but I was a touch underwhelmed based on the hype. Still a very tasty beer (maybe too young at 18 months?), and there is always a question of how/where it has been stored up until this point, but it's worth a go, just prepare for pricey.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

259,1708,Brutaltruth,4.51,"Enjoyed from a growler from Eight Ball Brewing company via The Party Source. This true treat on tap pours a lightly cloudy brownish red with a modest off white head of foam that fades to a thin ring and nice light lacing. The nose is of figs, raisins, heavy Belgian candy sugars, leather, tobacco, and moderately strong alcohol. Flavors surpass the nose with sweet candy sugars and caramel notes that fade to a raisin and fig flavor profile that is warming on the back, yet well hidden considering the ABV. Mouth feel is lively with carbonation, slick, and ends with a Belgian candy sugar note like a light molasses. Exceptional. Begs for a warm fire in winter....works exceptionally well in the air conditioning away from the heat of summer.  At 20 dollars a growler I feel privileged to enjoy such a wondrous treat considering the cost of a bottle.  A favorite to be certain, worthy of the praise that is heaped upon it.

Aroma: Very aromatic, with lots of complex, rich, earthy, aromas of bready, toasted malt, which imparts aromas of freshly baked French baguettes. There are also notes of candied sugar, toffee, dark molasses, lots of dried stone fruit, such as raisins, prunes and dates. I also get notes of funky, spicy, Belgian yeast, which imparts notes of saddle leather, clove, and interestingly, a touch of dark chocolate. Smells awesome!  Taste: Wow! Just…wow! Delicious! Earthy, rich, amazing. Lots of bready, toasted malt up front, followed by some nuttiness and candied sugar, toffee and dark molasses-like sweetness. There are lots of deep, fruity flavors of dried stone fruit, such as raisins, prunes and dates. I also get notes of funky, spicy, Belgian yeast, which imparts notes of clove, and as stated earlier, a touch of dark chocolate.  Mouthfeel: Slightly chewy and smooth as there is very little carbonation. With an ABV of 10%, there is practically no alcohol on the palate. It’s amazing how well masked the alcohol is. This beer could be…no, check that, it is a dangerous beer in that its incredibly easy to drink, like three or four of them, and not taste or feel the alcohol…that is until you try to stand up and fall on your ass!  Overall: This is an outstanding beer! Malty, fruity, spicy, earthy, rich, complex and utterly amazing.

The nose has a regal compactness to it, molasses, rum raisin ice cream, spiced oranges, cola, clove and bubblegum, green apple, apricot and red cherry fruit interwoven, there is also an element of cigar ash and earthiness, definitely does not overplay sweetness. In the mouth it’s medium-bodied and, again, more dense than fluid and expansive. This said allowing for the big foaminess and softly round carbonated mouth feel. Caramel, bubblegum, banana, clove, anise and a slight pie crust doughiness. The cherry, blackberry, plum fruit takes on a darker complexion here without undue sugariness, hint of fig or date. Mild metallic to earthy qualities, mostly as residue.

Appearance: Dark chestnut brown with some reddish notes in there but not completely opaque. The head is of light small white bubbles that linger throughout the pour.  Aroma: Ripe dark fruits, grapes, plums and other northern European fruits, possibly some blackberries notes in there as well or perhaps black raspberries.  Taste: Has some vinous notes with a slight tinge of yeast esters going on. I detect more of the clove and banana notes from the more readily available Belgian beers than in the Westy 12. The mouthfeel is also not quite as clean as in the Westy 12, which to me deducts some points.  Overall: Amazing beer, and considering you can get this one at most bottle shops pretty easily and not all that pricey and the fact that Westy 12 is so hard to come by (I am totally happy I had the opportunity to try it and if I ever find myself in Belgium, I will be heading there for sure!) this one is a dead heat in my opinion. I will say that I did enjoy the Westy a little bit more due to the clean flavor and finish and to me that is becoming a majorly important component of a quality beer.

259,1708,ludachris,4.56,"Garnet red with plenty of haze. A thick puck of light tan head shows great retention. Wide and sticky legs of lace rim the sides of the glass. It's a hardy, deep looking beer.  The nose really takes its time opening up as it warms. There's a rich vinous quality to it. Sour cherries and sweet booze drenched raisins. Ripe plums and dusty chocolate. There's a surprisingly lively ripe berry character that's really amplified by its alcohol level. Its very intriguing and complex as it slowly unravels.  There's a sweet phenolic tinge to its alcohol character that paints the entire palate. On top there's the same ripe berry and raisins. Sticky toffee sits in the center. There's a lot more caramel and bread. The richness from the nose carries over into the taste and it lingers.  Full bodied, slick and residual. Its drinkability is worth noting at 10% ABV. An excellent, unobtrusive level of carbonation.  This reminded me of how complex a beer can be. I loved how it gradually transformed as it got warmer. There's plenty of flavors that kept my interest until I finished the bottle. I'm still learning to love the style but this is fantastic stuff.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,PostRockandCats,5,"Pours a beautiful, cloudy dark amber with a fuffy, tan head. The lacing is spotty, but thick. There is a fair bit of carbonation still visible even after being poured for a while.  Smells almost bourbony up front with toffee malts, dried fruits all over and dry hops at the very end. Very balanced in the nose and not too boozy smelling despite the ABV.  Tastes surprisingly grapy at the start, with banana esters and spices. Brown bread and brown sugar at the end with a slight dryness punctuating the experience. Tastes like it should be boozy, but it doesn't taste as such.  Mouthfeel is unctuous and smooth; your mouth is coated. We are not in Pilsner country, here!  Overall, it's earned every word of it's reputation as one of the best Quads out there. It's balanced, smooth and drinkable while still allowing for complexity and depth. I think part of it's charm is the heavier carbonation; it lightens everything up. It's, without a doubt, one of the best beers I've had.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

259,1708,Ian_B,4.61,"Slightly translucent brown with hues of reddish-orange; the color of dried dates, which is fitting.  Esters of figs and dates, with very subtle phenolic hints of nutmeg/clove. Slight warming alcohol present, and maybe just the slightest note of banana. Smooth, brown malt sweetness provides an excellent base an balance for these awesome yeast characteristics.  Taste closely follows, with more emphasis on the savory malt sweetness; very smooth and somewhat creamy -- perhaps from a low and very well-balanced amount of diacetyl. Still plenty notes of fig and date. Subtle alcohol warming; would not guess this sits at 10%.  Mouthfeel is also superb. Extremely smooth, with a slight dryness. Medium-thick mouth feel that actually seems to fluctuate to the lighter side on the finish, again highlighting the excellent yeast character.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

259,1708,Meganomiidae,4.84,"Poured from 750 mL bottle into a Tin Roof Brewing Co. snifter.  Pour: Murky, foreboding maroon-brown; the kinda color that tells you you're in for a treat. Light brown head which dissipates rather slowly.  Smell: Dark honey (think buckwheat) and raisins very prevalent. Finishes with a twang of cinnamon and burnt caramel.  Taste: Dark fruits, specifically plums and chocolate cake, with that classic belgian ester and a twang of slight bittersweetness on the finish. Delicious.  Mouthfeel: Slightly heavy on the carbonation directly out of the bottle; when allowed to sit for 5 minutes, becomes more approachable. Results in a good carbonation level with a smooth-as-silk yet full mouthfeel.  My first quad, though I'm no newcomer when it comes to Belgian beers. This brew far surpasses any I've had, and may have just leaped into first place in my book.

Raisiny and more of that graham cracker pie crust. Very sweet and full upfront but finishes dry enough to avoid being cloying.  Medium carbonation with full but not thick mouthfeel. Not exactly a dry finish, but less sweet than the aroma and taste suggest.  A classic quad/strong dark. Definitely rivals Rochefort and perhaps Westvleteren.

There is a luscious, sticky cap of beige foam that remains for the entire drink. Excellent head retention. A few random spots of lacing dot the glass.  S: Right off the bat you get hit with rich aromas of sweet, candied dark fruits. Raisins, figs, plums, and some dark cherry all seamlessly meld together in a perfect mix of fruity sweetness. This beer has just the right amount of sweetness and is only slightly tart. Absolutely perfect! Aromas of lightly roasted malts and a caramel/brown sugar sweetness quickly follow. Some faint Belgian yeast notes of clove and banana.  T: WOW! The flavor starts with ripe dark fruits and brown sugar sweetness; almost a candy like sweetness. So much is going on its hard to put my finger on everything, it just perfectly blends together. The dark fruits I detect are raisins, figs, plums, black currants, and a bit of dark cherries also in the mix. The yeast profile is phenomenal as well. I'm getting yeast esters of clove and banana, with a hint of apple occasionally coming out. The use of caramel malts blends perfectly with the dark fruit flavors and compliments them well.  M: This beer is full bodied with medium carbonation. The mouthfeel is rich, creamy, and smooth with no hint of the 10% ABV. Perfect!  O: I have never given a perfect rating before, but in my personal opinion I feel St. Bernardus ABT 12 deserves it. This is the definition of complexity, and every time I drink it it manages to blow my mind time and time again. The sweet, dark fruit flavors along with the caramel maltiness and the yeast profile truly make this a delight. This beer almost has a wine like quality to it, it really is something special. The only negative is that it is expensive, but then again you usually have to pay for quality. However it is well worth the price tag, and it is without a doubt one of the greatest beers in the world.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

259,1708,MrWilliams,4.42,"Poured from 11.2 oz bottle into a snifter. Best by date of 19 04 18, so brewed April of 2013 if I am correct.  L 4.75: Color is a deep murky brown that shows little light unless held right up to the lamp, then the edges show a tarnished golden hue. Initial head about 1/2 in fairly head that dissipates quickly leaving a sickly tan film along the top. Despite word like murky and sickly it really is an appealing looking brew.  S 4: Initially overly sweet dark fruits, fig and raisin with a bit of toffee. As it warms bread, slightly toasted, and bananas push their way to the fore. Fruit smells still come into play but not as strongly or as sweet.  T 4.5: Burnt sugar is the first flavor that I notice and it holds throughout the sip leaving a slight bitterness that lingers on the tongue. Flavor isn't as sweet or fruity as the smell would indicate. Hints of raisins and something else in there that I can't quite put my finger on. Also a bit of a mustiness, possibly horse blanket or mildewed hay, not entirely familiar with either of those flavors.  F 3.75: Has a medium mouthfeel to it but the extensive carbonation makes it feel even lighter. Carbonation seems to sit on the tongue after the sip leaving little bubbles of pleasure. I'm not the hugest fan of overly carbonated beer and this one just pushes the boundaries of what I would consider acceptable. Also very dry, enough so that it leaves the mouth wanting another sip, and another just to keep the juices flowing.  O 4.25: As one of the mainstays for the style I expected a lot from this beer and for the most part it delivered. This bottle has about a year and a half on it from what I can tell and I am interested to see how it will hold up after some more time, and would love to try it fresh as well though I know that this may be a pipe dream. I think the only thing that holds this beer back is the lingering burnt sugar flavor.

Popped the cork and wasn't paying close attention, next thing I knew, great smelling beer was all over my counter. Shared with my wife and son, poured into a Belgian style glass. The color was a deep mahogany, with just a bit of opacity. Kicked up a nice head that faded pretty quickly into a thin film. Very little lacing down the glass. The smell was nice, with some dark fruit smells, lots of sweet malty aromas and just a touch of sweet caramel and cherry notes. The taste is absolutely phenomenal, with huge dark fruit and candy sugar flavors up front. Lots of different flavors on the back end, with a bit of toffee, caramel, fresh baked bread, pepper and raisins. The mouthfeel is luxurious, rolling so smoothly over the tongue, no alcohol bite, and just the right amount of carbonation bite. Overall, this is one of my favorite beers of all time, when one considers the price and availability, it's gotta be pretty high on everyone's list of the greatest beers out there!",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Mlkluther,4.5,Bottle. Pours a surprisingly dark brown with a three finger head that persists. The nose is malty and fruity and the taste follows.

259,1708,dmgeng,4,"I've looked for this beer for a while due to it's very high ratings and then my liquor store started carrying it and I had my chance.  A - Deep brown color that is almost ruby in the light. Medium white head with fine bubbles. Slightly cloudy from the yeast still in suspension.  S - The typical Belgian yeast spice character (phenolic) is predominant. Just underneath that are the malt and caramel tones with some fruit character like dark cherry. No hops present.  T - Very similar to the smell the Belgian character holds true but isn't the only player with lots of malty and caramelized sugars mixing. This beer is softer and not as flavorful as I had expected but there is still significant flavors mixing together. There is some dark fruits and alcohol on the back of the taste and quickly chased by the Belgian flavors.  M - Medium to full mouth-feel. Has some light bitterness and finishes complex with an aftertaste. Light carbonation making the flavors sit longer on the tongue.  Overall, a very good beer but not as flavorful as I had expected. There is quite a bit of flavor but for the coveted nature of this brew and in comparison to some of the other Quads on the market I truly cannot see why this one is ranked so highly. Though I would still recommend this beer; I would definitely not preface the conversation with the fact that it's ranked among the very best in the world.

Aroma is mostly malty sweet, syrupy, with some fruity overtones. Heavenly taste and feel! Oh so malty sweet! Fruity; like figs and wine like grapes. Bready and nutty. A slightly dry finish. So much complexity and nuance to this taste! High alcoholic content but not boozy. I drink beer for the taste and the buzz; and this one offers both in spades! Feel is a lively carbonation, full bodied, robust, but oh so drinkable! It is refreshing and hearty at the same time. What a beer! These Trappist monks are/were geniuses!!

259,1708,JackRWatkins,4.62,"A: Pours with a strong, creamy, three-finger beige head, and a beautiful mahogany body, dark chocolate and cola brown tones with hints of ruby peering through the haze, strong head retention and prominent lacing.  S: immediate raisin and dark candi sugar, with a clean, somewhat neutral, astringent hop bite, some cinnamon and hints of chocolate appear too, followed by a jammy note that is reminiscent of a berry medley  T: the first note to hit the palate is the strong malt body, with suggestions of cinnamon and nutmeg, reminiscent of holiday bread, followed by a more subtle chocolate undertone. This is met with a pleasantly warm, boozy character. As the beer begins to mellow, a tannic quality, similar to red wine; begins to emerge. This is followed by the presence of dark grape and cherry notes, there is a clean hop aftertaste with marries well with the flavor of the alcohol to produce a clean finish.  M: Full but not viscous, it sits smoothly on the tongue, as the effervescence provides a tingling sensation, before leaving behind a decently dry finish  O: This is a phenomenal beer, worth countless revisits. Part of the beauty of St. Bernardus Abt. 12 is that while there are a certain range of experiences you will always have when you taste it, there seems to be more to discover every time. This beer has been brewed since 1946, and it is still under appreciated with the world at large. To compare this to wine is something of a logical conclusion, but it is in a way a disservice to the experience that is this beer.

259,1708,doktorhops,4.88,"Holy Mother of St. Bernardus! I’ve finally got my hands on a bottle of St. Bernardus Abt 12. This one comes from the greatest bottleshop in Australia, aka Plonk (in Canberra folks), I asked for it and they got it in (I love those guys!). Well this has been one at the top of my list for ages, isn’t it great when you finally get to topple giants? Anyway without further ado (I hate ado’s) let’s crack open some Abt 12.  Poured from a 750ml bottle into a St. Feuillien chalice as it is the glass that compares most to the one on label, plus how happy does that monk look? I want to look that happy.  A: Cloudy, with yeast particles everywhere, deep ruby ( and I mean really really really deep ruby) body with a 1cm fawn head that stays like a champ. 10/10.  S: First whiff is a combination of dark fruit (plum, fig, date) esters and white wine spirit. Further notes of heavy bread yeast, brown sugar and a hint of peppercorn is revealed afterwards. That touch of wine spirit is the only disturbance to a perfect score. 9/10.  T: One massive dark fruit experience! With added bold characters of brown sugar, rye bread and alcohol warmth at the back. There is a light medicinal hop note providing a hint of bitterness to cut through the sugar, and a slight peppercorn spice plays in to the flavour as well. What’s amazing about this brew is how flavoursome it is at 10% ABV. A buttery diacetyl opens up as the glass warms. Damn these monks in their fancy cassocks can brew! 10/10.  M: Medium bodied with velvety smooth carbonation, it paints a rich tongue-coating tapestry throughout the mouth, mmmm. 10/10.  D: Well the points are flying left right and centre for Abt 12, and so they should be - this is one brilliant Quad. Better than Trappistes Rochefort 10? Yes, this one has a touch more character in the flavour. As Doc (i.e. me, I’m doing a Caesar referring to himself in the third person thing now) always says: “The T in my reviews is king”. Indeed it is with the Abt 12. Let’s talk about the cons of this fine Ale: None. No wait, if you’re the designated driver going to a party and they’re serving bottles of this you might end up driving home drunk, getting caught and having your licence suspended... that is however a very specific and unlikely scenario (err, someone serving Abt 12 at a party that is, not the drink/driving part). 10/10.  Food match: Some Trappist cheeses would go down a treat along with crusty bread.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Bone53,4.5,"This is my first quadrupel, and after high anticipation for some time, i am stoked to dig in!  Appearance (4.75): An aggressive pour resulted in almost all head. After it settled, theres a creamy head atop a beautiful dark amber colored beer, with phenomenal lacing.  Smell (4.75): Brown sugar, caramel malts, ripe, tart, port wine like dark fruits, yeast, spice. There's so much going on it takes me a while to really put all the aromas together  Taste (4.25): Right off the bat i'm hit with some alcohol that reminds me its a big beer, then i get the candied sugar and dark fruits followed by a caramel and almost slight roasted malts, then ends with spiced yeast and slight hops  Mouthfeel (4.5): Medium to full mouthfeel; Slightly alcoholic upfronf yet silky smooth that sort of coats my mouth for a second until my palate is hit with moderate bitterness  Overall (4.5): Being my first quadrupel i never really knew what to expect, but i can see why this is so highly rated. I actually found the nose more pleasing than the taste with the latter having a more pronounced tart port wine like character that i have some getting used to. The finish and aftertaste definitely has a spiced floral note with a good amount of bitterness. I dont know if its the yeast or what, but something about this beer reminds me of Samuel Smith.

Sweet bready caramel sugars, wreathed through with raisin and plum notes, and something that reminds me of an oaken single malt scotch barrel.  T: Oh, that is glorious. Malt candy, indeed - yeasty caramel sweetness right up front, uncut by any hoppy notes. Raisin, plum, cherry, and fig notes writhe through this delicious beer, with some faint woody-oaky echoes.

Pours pretty much hazy brown with a large amount of medium-bubbled head that reduces slowly to a nice layer of soapy-to-foamy head. The nose is dark brown sugar, date, a hint of old wood or leather.  The feel is so smooth for a higher ABV beer, and similarly, the alcohol is hidden well. The carbonation is felt but is very light in feel. There's a slight cola nature to the taste, but not as much the feel. The taste otherwise follows the nose pretty well, and reminds me of a rich, fresh-baked date bread. The end feel has a bit of a toffee candy feel to it.  I expected a denser feel, but the simplicity and balance in the flavors are so well done.

There is a phenolic, medicinal flavour in there and a fair level of bitterness hiding beneath the sweet flavours.

259,1708,coriswrasse,4.79,11.2 oz bottle shared in two special glasses which accentuate the head and smell. Best by 30-07-18 I have had this in the past but it was before BA. Pours a huge excellent head. Smell is wonderfully Belgian and strong. Plenty of good esters abound. Taste is boozy malty dark strong Belgian just as the style suggests. Mouthfeel is middle to heavy and malty sweet. Overall this is a fantastic beer in a under appreciated style. A must have to expand your study of beer and always delicious on cold night.

259,1708,orcrist_cleaver,4.52,"A: Real gorgeous tawny, ruby port color. Just brown when not in light. A bit murky, with slightly off-white head 2 fingers thick on top of tulip. Presentation of head wasn't that sexy though, reminded me more of ocean foam. Persisted and gave some nice lacing though.  S: Booze scent is easy to find, and resembles the rubbing variety a bit much. So are the fruits-predominantly dark cherries, prunes. Some chocolate from the malts possibly, thorny spiciness, and that distinctive Belgian yeast.  M: Smooth, not creamy and actively carbonated. I'm thinking it should be softer for an Abbey. Enhances flavor profiles of the beer precisely and succinctly. Some yeasty alcohol warmth at end.  T: Lots of fruit. Raisin, fig, banana. Good Belgian yeast finish. Just the right amount of doughiness to pair well with the sweetness. This beer is like a liquid liege Belgian waffle, just like the one they serve at Brewery Ommegang.

Smell; Aroma was boozy and wine like, but not unpleasant.  Taste- Taste was strong yet strangely smooth, first comes some spiciness, with cloves the most obvious flavor, then comes a strong punch of alcohol, followed by lingering notes of grapes and red cherries, vague malt flavors provide balance, the mixture of the alcohol and the malt creates a certain woodiness that lingers as well.  Mouthfeel; Full/ medium body, slightly creamy but finishes dry, low carbonation, which is very appropriate for the texture of the beer. very smooth.  overall; This is a beast of a Belgian.

259,1708,amendt,4.16,"I have had many a St. Bernardus 12 over the past year. In the beginning, I was dazzled by its novelty. And though thinking of it now is making me thirsty, terribly so -- it is not for a St. Bernardus 12. You see, I have changed my thinking on this beer. I've been burned by it too many times. Case after case I have ordered, and with each successive wave launched against me, I have pondered: what do I think of this beer?  It is a crappy version of a Westvleteren -- that is what I think. While the Westy is complex and buoyant, the St. Bernardus 12 is like a Westy you left a piece of tree bark in overnight. The St. Bernardus 12 is somehow thinner and more bitter. Acrid might be a better word than bitter. St. Bernardus 12 has an unpleasant sharpness to it (whatever the medicinal qualities of its high abv) like waking in the morning to find you have an unsheathed razor blade in your mouth. The only way to mitigate the sort of acrid unfriendliness is to chill it to at least the recommended temperature -- and probably lower. The Westy I drink and feel I am encountering something higher, greater than myself.

259,1708,CalgaryFMC,4.16,"330 ml bottle poured into a goblet. Initial pour yielded a massive amount of creamy beige foam, which will eventually settle into a murky yeasty light cola brown colored liquid with a rich buttery aroma of dried dark fruits (dates, figs, raisins), cocoa powder, faint red berries, toffee, and an earthy tobacco-like note that also shows up on the palate. This is another fairly legendary Belgian and certainly the taste stands up well to intense scrutiny. Rich, dark, sweet, and a little roasty, with a warming but not overpowering alcohol presence and tons of dark fruit and woody, earthy notes yet quite drinkable just the same. Dark chocolate cake and dates yield to some medicinal licorice or anise notes at the back end, along with some spicier potpourri-style cinnamon and nutmeg. Moderate body (not super thick) and a similar mid-range degree of carbonation do not surprise me, although the finish is VERY interesting ... Almost a barrel-aged coconut/sulfur note that lingers and lingers along with faint gooseberry-like hops. The candy bar sweetness becomes more pronounced as the roasted bitterness subsides and I am digging the evolving complexity after the initial blast of chocolate, yeast, and booze. Supposedly this is the same basic recipe as Westvleteren 12 and I am eager to do the comparison (soon). In the meantime, the last few drops are going down and I am feeling little pain. I might go on record and say that I prefer Rochefort 10 but that's no real insult. This manages to sustain a solid runner-up position.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

259,1708,Jugs_McGhee,3.6,"Truncated review below. Reviewed side by side with a Rochefort 10 and a Westvleteren 12. I'll come back and give this its own proper review in the future.  1 pint 9.4 fl oz brown glass bottle with cage and corked cap served into a Biere de Saint Louis Alsace teku. Expectations are very high; I've had this before and loved it.  Overcarbonated - the cork shot up and hit the ceiling upon opening.  HEAD: No bubble show forms as it's poured. Head is 2 fingers of pale khaki colour. No lacing is left on the sides of the glass.  BODY: Red-brown colour. Murky and muted. Not looking fantastic, but it's more than acceptable for a quad.  Not the rich appearance of superior quads, but appealing.  AROMA: Kind of muted. I have to search for the dark fruits: plum, fig, that's about it. Not finding the prune or the dates of superior quads. Belgian malts. Some biscuity yeast. Raisin. Maybe some cream. Starchier than the Rochefort 10.  A pleasant but reticent aroma of mild strength.  No hop character or alcohol is detectable.  TEXTURE: Smooth and wet, but it has enough slight coarseness to coax out a bit more depth of flavour. I love the creaminess, but it could be more soft. Complements the taste well. Nice presence on the palate. Comfortingly soft. Very approachable.  TASTE: Belgian malts. Biscuity Belgian yeast. Wisps of faint dark fruits - plum, fig, and raisin. It's a teensy bit starchy, which I don't dig. Much more muted and reticent than I remember. It lacks the depth and duration of flavour of Westvleteren 12 and Rochefort 10.  O: Certainly a good quad, but not up to par with the other two in this side-by-side. I do like it, but I'll plan on reviewing it on its own properly.

Taste is fruity with raisin, cherry and fig, lighter in body overall and a tad sweeter than Rochefort 10 and Westy 12. Slightly spicy and peppery in the finish with some clove. Has the typical perfumy alcohol and the booziness typical of quads but again is lighter than the Roch or Westy. Slightly oily mouthfeel with active, creamy carbonation. Overall, it competes with the best as far as quads are concerned. Not as bold as the others but just as good.

259,1708,Zraly,4.96,"A bit surprised I never wrote a review for this as it is a fantastic ale. Before I rain on my own parade...  Dark amber with ruby highlights with light tan head. The bubbles are very compact and small, beautiful bottle carbonation -- something I don't see as often from keg pours. Poured into a 15cl St. Bernardus tasting glass that came with a sampler pack -- a gift from my brother-in-law for Christmas. Splitting a 11.2 ounce bottle with my girlfriend as a ""it's Tuesday, why the hell not?"" nightcap. Drink by date: 04 07 18.  Very fragrant upfront, with notes of yeast, spice and malt. A gentle swirl reveals interesting candy-like smells, almost something like a cherry candy wrapper. There is also something a bit ""other worldly"" about the way this smells; like a lover that you never met but maybe you should have. Maybe her skin -- with day old perfume worn in that is now tangled in your sheets -- smells something like this. Now I am sounding like a pretentious asshole. I'm going to carry on.  Fruit and brown sugar notes provide the essence; the spice and unique yeast provides the quirk. Clove and spice notes are heavy, and the clove comes forward right from the start. There is a nice caramel undertone, propping up the luscious prune and apricot fruit notes. Alone with the sweetness and creaminess in the body, it reminds me of a rich spice cake spiked with a bit of rum, cream cheese frosting and all. It is damn good.  Warning: this does NOT drink as if it is 10% alcohol. It drinks like it is 6%, at best. Be careful with your ravenous behavior! The body belies the bite.  A fabulous and classic representative of the Belgian Quad style. If you've yet to sample some, find some and do so. Drinking a glass of this is an education, and a lesson that a good beer advocate would take seriously. Well-prepared meat dishes of a variety of sorts work well, but probably best with a stew. Also, cheese! Please, eat soft, ripe cheese and she'll thank you more than once.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

It looks incredible. A thick, cloudy brown with just the right amount of head on top. Classy beyond measure.  The smell is complex from the very moment you open it. A mixture of fruit aromas and yeast.  Even after trying out a variety of great beers in the US Northeast, I never thought I would stumble upon something so delicious. The taste is rich in dark fruits like plum and even a bit of grape in it, yet is balanced to absolute perfection. There is almost no hint of the high alcohol content; quite a feat for a beer with this much alcohol. None of the flavor are overpowering, and the aftertaste is extremely pleasant, sort of syrupy.  It sort of feels like a wine/champagne/beer combination crafted carefully. It's just right. Not too thick, not too thin, and a very pleasant, elegant carbonation. It's worth mentioning that it absolutely no effort to drink as well. The only sad thing will be realizing that you actually emptied your glass so fast.

259,1708,LambicPentameter,4.42,"Enjoyed out of an 330 mL bottle with a date stamped on the back label that can only be a 'best by' date, given the fact that it occurs in the future: 1/23/2018. Poured into a Boulevard Smokestack Series chalice.  Appearance - One of the most beautiful beers I've ever seen, with the body a steady gradient from dark brown/mahogany at the top, where the density of the liquid and the proximity of the head keeps it bathed in shadow, all the way down to a reddish/lighter mahogany at the bottom, narrower end of the glass, that allows light to filter through. Some darker freckles of sediment float in suspension as a cacophony of carbonation bubbles rise to the top, replenishing a one-finger khaki head that resembles Lorraine Swiss. Retention is excellent, due to the continuous flow of bubbles from the bottom, and as I drink it down, there are sparse but noticeable rings of sticky lace adorning the sides of the chalice.  Smell - This one tends more towards the sweeter dark fruit notes of fig and date rather than raisin and plum, which I like. Alongside the subtle fruit there is a caramel-like sweetness that gives the impression of candied fruits. Subtle roasted malt is gentle and any sense of chocolate is more cocoa powder than bakers chocolate. But the primary components of this one are dark fruit and subtle spice, like clove and nutmeg. This would be a fantastic winter beer, but it's not overpowering.  Taste - Delivering on the promise of the aroma, the moderately-dark fruits are front and center, with figs, candied dates and the sweetness of hazelnut. Yeasty phenolic spice is present again as well, with clove and faint cinnamon. It's wonderfully delicate in spite of the richer notes of molasses and brown sugar, and it's hard not to be reminded of the famous Westy 12, although perhaps a slightly simpler take on the style. I get a lot of similar aromas, but not nearly the number of flavor impressions as I did from that one. Not really a problem as this one is good enough to be breathing down the neck of its label-less counterpart.  Mouthfeel - Medium-bodied and moderate-to-high carbonation, providing a wonderful effervescent counterpoint to the richer flavors therein. Finish is slightly sweet with minimal bitterness.  Overall, a wonderful beer, and while I'd choose Westy if all else was equal, the simple truth is that this one is much, much easier to obtain. Given that, it's more than an acceptable substitute--the difference in difficulty obtaining Westy 12 is not inversely proportional to the difference in the experience of drinking it.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Taste - Sugar and etoh notes, clove and over-ripe banana  Mouthfeel - Full-bodied and velvety with moderate carbonation.  Overall - Good belgian; though not my style. Too much sugar and alcohol undertone to feel balanced.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Macko,4.57,"Appearance: Dark with ruby highlights. Creamy head with good lacing which lasted well.  Smell: Fruits, but somehow apples dominates for me.  Taste: Sweet to start. The more I drank, the more I thought of bananas. Syrupy with hint of cherries. Working to a more caramel finish which can even be a little tart. No hint of the strong alcohol in the taste.  Mouthfeel: Creamy but with good carbonation throughout. Takes a little while to feel a pleasant mild burning in the throat.  Overall: Compared to the Westy 12, it has a little more life to it. Sometimes I like to drink this with a few cherries and/or taste of brown chocolate between sips. When I look at the smiling monk on the bottle waving his finger at me, I'm generally smiling back at him.  A joy to drink. Reminds me how good it is to be alive.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,MattNidiffer,4.79,"Poured from a bottle into a flared, oversized Tulip with a full two-finger head. (As a footnote, I would recommend this beer to be enjoyed at a bit warmer than standard refrigerator temps; it tastes way better once it's settled and slightly chilled.)  Appearance - Very dark, almost ebony with deep ruby highlights. Not very much light. Creamy beige head is fluffy, foamy, and lingering. Lacing is consistently thick throughout.  Smell - Fruity and spicy esters are very prevalent up front. Very slight caramel and toasted nut aromas near the finish, with a sweet overtone.  Taste - Surprisingly sweet. Banana and clove esters right up front, with an almost syrupy aftertaste. If left in the mouth for a moment, and then swallowed, the banana flavour is far more prevalent. Minor toasty and caramelly hints throughout. Surprisingly low alcohol taste, considering its high ABV; almost as if it is masked by the fruity spiciness.  Mouthfeel - Almost seems to expand on the palate; perfect amount of carbonation. Very smooth drinking, and almost leaves the mouth with a mildly oily feeling after swallowing. Leaves the lips feeling almost syrupy.  Overall - This beer is one of the best beers I've had the pleasure of reviewing. From the full and fluffy head, all the way down to the last drop, the Abt 12 is astounding. This beer has more than earned it's place on BA's Top Beers on Planet Earth list, and it has definitely earned it's place on my shelves. Very highly recommended paired with food, friends, or even just to sip on.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Smell: Inviting, cherries, faint ethanol, warm pumpernickel bread, figs, dark fruit.  Taste: Slightly sour citric acid at the very start that quickly fades into bing cherry, raisins, caramel, brown sugar and a bit of alcohol. Very delicious, intense, complex, balanced and the finish lasts a good long pleasant while.  Mouthfeel: Slightly oily, medium to thicker bodied, nice amount of carbonation that prickles throughout.

Mouthfeel - Full-bodied and creamy with lively, tingly carbonation, giving it a much lighter feel. Goes down smooth and easy, with a drying alcohol finish. Leaves a syrupy feel on the lips.  Overall - Maybe the best Belgian Dub/Trip/Quad I've had, but I'm still not sold on the style. Too much sugary sweetness and alcohol undertone for my liking. Probably a can't miss for quad fans.

259,1708,itsscience,4.93,"Abt 12 is a beer that changed my life. Before I tried it, I was your typical college senior who had tasted a few strong craft brews, maybe enjoyed one or two, but for whom beer did not yet 'click'. When I was at the bar and saw this sitting in the cooler, I had a foggy recollection of a ""greatest beers"" list I had seen somewhere with this on it, and so I bought a bomber. At first taste, I knew this was everything I had always hoped beer would be, and that I had to keep seeking out stuff like this. That is the moment I fell in love with beer.  The pour that I'm reviewing now is from draft. It pours a muddy ruby color with a 2 1/2-finger pillow of moussy head. The nose brings clean and sweet bread malts, plum skin, cherry, wild earthy yeast, brown sugar, and caramel. It tastes rich and sweet in its malty goodness with dark fruit esters, especially plum and raisin, playing a huge role. There's also a toasted oat/nutty character to the beer, some coriander and other spices from the yeast, and big bread flavor on the finish. It has the perfect carbonation to pry open the taste buds without overdoing it, and a medium body that hides the alcohol well.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

259,1708,thehyperduck,4.64,"750 mL bottle from the LCBO, served at cellar temperature. I shared a bottle of this a few months ago and really enjoyed it, so I went out of my way to pick up a second bottle for reviewing purposes.  Pours a murky copper-brown colour, topped at first with a lofty three fingers of frothy, pillowy off-white head. The foam recedes slowly over a period of five minutes or so, leaving behind a nice swath of sticky lacing as it shrinks down to a modest cap. I absolutely love the aroma on this one - it's quite fruity and yeasty as one might hope, with elements of raisin, fig, toffee and molasses, as well as some spicy clove notes. Quite yeasty, and a little boozy, but at 10% I'd be shocked if it weren't.  This is a rich-tasting, fulfilling Belgian-style dark ale that is a pleasure to sip. Dark cherry, plum, raisin and fig fruitiness come through initially, with sweeter notes of brown sugar and treacle following after. It becomes yeastier and increasingly spicy toward the finish, offering a bit of an almond-nut vibe that is soon overtaken by clove and a faint touch of licorice/anise. The aftertaste includes a pleasant mixture of candi sugar, spice and just the right amount of ethanol warmth. On the heftier side of medium-bodied, with surprisingly restrained carbonation (for a trappist-style ale), giving this brew an exceptionally smooth mouthfeel.  Final Grade: 4.64, a superb A+ grade. St. Bernardus Abt 12 is a true classic - a full-flavoured, satisfying quadrupel with no serious flaws for me to gripe about. I haven't had nearly enough quads to suggest where this one might rank on a relative scale, but I can't deny that this is one of the best Belgian-style dark ales I've ever had the opportunity to try. A great deal at its ON price-point - I'm hoping that this one will become a regular listing, but just in case it doesn't I'll probably snag another bottle for the cellar. A must-try.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

I wasn't disappointed. Just like the others who reviewed this beer I was treated to a nice lacy head. I enjoyed this in a 1 liter glass beer stein so I could enjoy the opaque tea like color.

259,1708,bball208,5,"Each time I have this beer, I love it more and more. Kind of like the movie Friday.  Anyway, this pours a lovely and hazy brown. As you pour, you see a fade from dark to light, then slowly you can see a head forming, and this one was huge, 2-3 fingers worth, and slow to dissipate. #hashtagporn  Aroma: burnt sugar, dark fruits... maybe charred raisins, those chewy dates, maybe even a slight bit of plum. This all accompanied by a beautiful classic aroma of belgian yeast and the kind of alcohol it makes. You do get a little bit of that alcohol in the nose, but for this one, it's very appropriate. Overall, you get a bit of tang, sweet, and booze in the nose.  Taste: Finally. The carbonation is the first thing I notice. Does great, because it starts off as dark-fruity and sliiightly bitter, but those bubbles on the tongue explode those flavors into malty sweet and bready. Sooo decadent. I definitely sense raisins and figs, and a communion bready yeast. If you've had communion bread, think about the exhale on that bread, that's what I'm getting. I am loving this beer.  Overall: As you begin having this beer at a colder temperature, allow as much as you'd like to have it at the temperature it should be had at, 60-65 degrees. Once it started climbing towards the warm side, the flavors became ridiculous. It becomes soft, velvety, rich, almost milky.

It forms an aggressive head of creamy, off-white foam at two fingers. It leaves a tightly woven lace.  S: Right up front there are dark dried fruits: figs, dates, prunes, and raisins. There are some light phenols suggesting cooling winter spices like nutmeg and cardamom. In the background is a sturdy malt presence with light roastiness and a hint of caramel.

There is absolutely no sourness of tartness here. The alcohol is definitely present, but it contributes a welcome, fiery snap. Everything is then rounded off by a deep and rich earthy molasses sweetness and then finishes with a pleasant bitterness.  M: There is potent alcohol here (no hiding that!), but it's accentuated by flirtatious carbonation and then alleviated by the medium body and the slick, oily finish.

Sediment floating around inside the bottle.  AROMA: The aroma is fantastic on this beer. There's dark fruits, like plum, raisin, fig. Sweet, caramel malts. I also detected brown sugar and a little bit of cinnamon. There's also a whiff of alcohol in there - at 10% it was expected.  TASTE: What a great, complex taste, with just about all elements of the nose showing strong. The malts offer a sweet caramel breadiness that's well complemented by the plum, raisin, and fig, as well as a little bit of banana. Brown sugar is also noticeable, with a trace amount of chocolate mixed in as well.  MOUTHFEEL: No surprises. Thick and heavy, with alcoholic warming. Also somewhat creamy. Where I think this beer shines is that despite the sweetness, it's never syrupy or sickly.  OVERALL: People who've had both tell me that Westvleteren XII is marginally better than Abt 12. I haven't had Westy, so for now, Abt 12 is my favorite quad.

It unfolds and becomes so many things. It starts with fresh plum and fig, then becomes dried prune and raisin. then there is a touch of tart cherry. The yeast stays soft and dry and keeps things light and uplifted. The carbonation is effervescent and while that's true this beer is creamy. CREAMY. The fruits are sweet and resilent and the alcohol has a touch of dryness, a touch of spice and a bit of pepper and bitter to impart to the finish.  The finish is sweet and warming and by the time you finish this glass the alcohol is sweet not sharp. It has won you over with flavors that surrounded it. The fruit danced on the palate, the malt richness was cake like and light. The spice intriguing.

259,1708,krustster,4.63,"It's widely known that this is good so I'll keep my review brief.  Appearance is actually kind of gross. The head is a bunch of giant bubbles like a sink full of dish soap, which quickly pop and leave a sickly bit of swirling foam on the top. The beer itself is a cloudy dark brown. As a beer fan I know this is still probably going to be good, but I had a few moments of doubt as I was pouring it. A pretty large amount of chunky sediment on the bottom as well. I know it won't affect the taste, but it really does look kind of nasty overall.  Smell is where things turn around. Incredibly rich, bread/pastry aromas, toffee/caramel, with a hint of ""dark fruits"". Slightly present is a touch of alcohol heat. Amazingly sweet, almost candy-like aroma. I was a little grossed out on pouring this, but once I sniffed it I was hooked.  Taste is more of the same. Hearty bread and biscuit tastes, maple syrup, caramel, some fruit. It almost tastes like a cake donut in liquid form. There's a moderate burn which feels totally appropriate and balanced given the sweet, desert-like quality. I would give this a 5 but technically it was not quite as good as Rochefort 10, so I have to mark it down slightly. But really, this is an amazingly delicious treat.  Mouth feel is creamy, almost like a shake. Just enough carbonation to give a bit of bite on the entry. Again, super rich without being too thick, and dare I say it, decadent.  Overall this one is a classic for a reason. If you haven't tried it before, you're doing yourself a disservice. I waited years to buy it due to the price.

259,1708,hagbergl,4.8,"The venerable St. Bernardus Abt 12–one of those Belgian Abbey ales that absolutely truly lives up to the hype surrounding it.  Appearance (4.5/5): A 750 mL decanted into my St. Bernardus chalice, the beer looks truly majestic: a massive, billowing beige head sitting atop a deep brown base. Held up to the light, you can see garnet highlights.  Smell (4.5/5): Huge aromas of sweet caramel, a light booze (nothing harsh and fusel, though), dark and stone fruits–fig and plum–and toffee. Lightly spicy Belgian yeast. Exceptionally aromatic, deep, and complex. This is how I EXPECT a world-class Quad to smell.  Taste (5/5): The taste takes the exceptional flavors and complexity hinted at in the smell to the next level and then some. Dominant flavors: toffee and caramel, fig and plum, a mildly spicy yet fruity yeast. The sweetness is cut by the alcohol, which certainly–at 10%–makes its presence felt. This is a good thing; with a beer as intensely malty as this the alcohol really plays a constructive role in tempering the sweetness and keeping things balanced. Extraordinary depth of flavor and complexity that proves itself as the beer warms.  Mouthfeel (5/5): Abt. 12 is a full-bodied beer but doesn't drink ""heavy."" The bottle-conditioning provides a great medium carbonation that makes the beer nice and active. The feel is exceptionally creamy, not syrupy like some American-made Quads can be. This quality really allows the flavors the shine and steer clear of becoming cloying.  Overall (4.75/5) AKA TL/DR: This is an incredible beer and an easy pick for my favorite Quadruple of all time.

259,1708,TheBiercast,4.26,"Appearance: It pours a very deep brown with hints of ruby red as you hold it up to the light. It’s a pretty beer with about a finger and half of creamy tan head that dissipates rather quickly due to the higher alcohol content(10%).  Smell: With true Belgian abbey ales, you’d expect a very rich nose, and this does not disappoint. It’s almost a little overwhelming, but luckily, the aroma of dried dark fruits is not something I’m opposed to. Different strokes for different folks, but if you don’t like how this beer smells, then you live in bizarro world.  Mouthfeel: This version of St. Bernardus really packs a punch in the small, tight bubbles of effervescent carbonation. The mouthfeel felt slightly chalky from the bits of that fine, fine Belgian yeast that found its way into the glass, but the crisp feeling of the alcohol smoothed it out.  Taste: Overall, this beer tastes like a true Quad. What I would say about this that sets it apart to where you can tell the difference from another quad would be that it was slightly sweeter. I’m not saying sweetness from candied fruits, but it is almost a honey like quality that smooths and balances out the flavor. Don’t get me wrong, this is as rich as Macauley Culkin was in 1994, but there is a slight honey flavor there to help subdue it. Basically, I shouldn’t be reviewing these big Belgian beers. I always give them major kudos, but I sure think they deserve them.  Overall: I would definitely split a bottle of this again, but that’s it. A whole bottle is way too rich and would do me in.  4.25/5 on the scale. Nailed it.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,LightnerLiquorKS,4.56,"St. Bernadus Abt 12  25.4Oz Caged Bottle poured into a Watou (official glass)  Look: Dark Brown, reminds me of a dark stout in appearance. There are more colors present when held to a bright light. A very small amount of head/foam arises when this amazing Ale is poured. Many Belgians have a large amount of head that dissipates slowly. This Quad gets right to business!  Smell: Dessert time! My goodness, I have drunk this beer many times, however reviewing it is another matter entirely! A very sweet aroma arises and the malt is very noticeable on the nose. I smell almost different things entirely each time I drink this beer. This time, it was cherries, caramel, dark...dark fruit, and brown sugar. The cinnamon in this specific pour overtook my senses and indeed, this beer can be enjoyed by itself or with dessert.  Taste: A yeast and fresh-baked bread taste is immediately noticed...then comes the dark fruit, such as hints of raisins, dark cherries, and aged grapes. The heat (10.00abv) is hidden so wonderfully that ALL you can taste is a very special Belgian beer. Put it this way: there is no ""syrup"" feel or taste to it. It tastes like beer!  Mouthfeel: Since this Ale is not heavily carbonated, it is heavy and bulky on the tounge. Most connoisseurs say ""chewy"" on how it feels in your mouth--and I am inclined to agree!  Overall: This Quadruple is not as hot as most of the others that you have been used to. It goes more along the lines of a triple or even a dubbel. It goes down easy, but still lets you know it is there- especially when you stand up from 25 ounces of the stuff! This is the tastiest Belgian Quad and very akin to Gulden Draak 9000 Quad- as it goes down easy but it is amazingly complex and the heat is masterfully masked. It goes down SO easy despite the heaviness and complexity: watch out! This is a serious beer and one of the World's best. Since I am a Belgian lover, there is nothing better than a Quad that masks itself down a little. This will always be one of my favorite beers and is endlessly drinkable.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Dark, hazy burgundy with a huge fluffy off-white head even from the most careful pour. The head actually is still growing slowly, into a mountain of foam, as it sits. Only after 5 minutes or so, it finally starts to dissipate around the edges of the mountain. Leaves big rings of lacing as it descends. Smell is powerful; as soon as the cork popped I caught a big, boozy whiff of that belgian yeast scent. In the glass, it smells of belgian yeast, sweet soft malt, some dark fruit and sugar, hint of booze, and spiciness. First taste is malty sweetness, with lots of spice and fruity flavors. Puff of alcohol comes up before the swallow, but wouldn't give away near as high as 10%. Fruit flavors include banana and some darker fruits, but they're not as present; brown sugar and belgian yeast also floating around. Not as complex as some belgian strong dark ales, but much more balanced. Mouthfeel is absolutely perfect; smooth, fluffy with carbonation, excellent.

Somewhat dry finish except for evident alcohol burn at the back of the throat.  m: Substantial body. I have yet to use the term ""chewy"" for any beer I have reviewed, but if I did, it would be here. Lots of carbonation adds even more to the weighty sense of this brew.  o: Not #32 on the BA top 250 list for nothing! Very easy drinking despite its high ABV and solid mouthfeel.

A: Pours a murky reddish-brown color with about a 1/4 inch off white head that thins down quickly. Still a thin layer of head that just rests on top of the beer.  S: I get the alcohol right off the bat which is accompanied by traces of apple or fig and some molasses. It has a sweet, but funky wine-like aroma to it.  T: Initially, I get some apple or grape flavor followed by the tartness from the fig and molasses. Similar to the smell, but you pick up on more adjuncts in the taste. The finish has just a faint trace of the alcohol, but the flavor is pretty strong.  M: Light to medium bodied beer, coats the mouth slightly but not really heavy. Good portions of sweetness and tartness throughout!  O: I dont drink a lot of quads so I am not really appealed by the funky taste, but I do understand that this is a highly regarded beer and a true Belgian, so I would suggest to give it a try.

The mouthfeel was superb: smooth and velvety with possibly slightly more alcohol than I would have ordered. But, nonetheless, that doesn't detract from the overall experience which is fantastic.

In the current lighting conditions the head seems to sparkle as carbonation bubbles rise to the top. Beer is dark brown with red hues thrown in for good measure. Glorious.  Smell - Yeasty scents dominate up front with some dark fruits following. A bit of a caramel maltiness on the back end.  Taste - Very complex, lots of different flavors going on. Cloves and bready flavors up front transitioning quickly but not too quickly to fruits and brown sugar flavors. Every sip seems to alternate the emphasis between bread and cloves followed by fruits and sugar on the next sip and vice versa. All of this while being able to taste each the transition of each profile in every sip.  Mouthfeel - Thick rich creamy texture. Dry finish a given considering the booziness. After the first few sips a considerable warmness in the back of your throat. Perfect for a rainy fall day.

On top sits a truly astounding head. Like 3 fingers of fluffy, foamy off white goodness.  Smell - Typical quad smells. Spices and a crazy amount of yeast. Getting some dark fruits as well, cherries and maybe..prunes?  Taste - Some complex stuff going on here. Sweet malt off the top. Light toffee maybe. Followed by that dark fruit picked up in the nose, along with some grapes I think. Finishes with some grain and a strong alcohol presence. Yup, Lottsa alcohol.  Mouthfeel - This is one of those things that doesn't get talked about enough, and maybe for good reason....it isn't normally very interesting. But this isn't a normal beer. The body if medium, carbonation is high...finish is...unique as it's neither crisp and dry nor smooth. It just is. The beer itself is rough on the tongue, in a pleasant sort of way..kinda grainy.

Well-balanced, and a hint of licorice and clove spice to pull the flavor to the back of the tongue. A little yeasty and definitely a touch of alcohol.

The finish is sweet, and warming courtesy of the 10% ABV, but balanced extremely well.  O - Complex, boozy and incredibly balanced. This brew is well deserving of its reputation.

Few beers have blown me away, and this one humbled me greatly. I know I will come back to it and try to review it in the future.

Taste: The first impression is of the dark fruit and melanoids described anove. But medium bitterness forces its way in with welcome assertiveness, along with prickly pear and white pepper. A but too phenolic. Methinks my bottle isn't the best, considering I've had this before and haven't tasted the phenols like this.  Mouthfeel: Mad carbonation, with prickly alcohol warmth that coats the throat. Medium body. Too dry and harsh for the style, in my opinion, but I've had this before, and I think my bottle this time may be a bit bad.  Overall: This is the second time I've tried this beer. The first time, I was blown away. This time around, I felt like I didn't rember the carbonation being so strong, the finish being so dry, or the alcohol being so obvious.

Very light head of lightish-consistency bubbles that remained thin throughout. Little to no lacing on the glass. Nothing about the appearance wowed me.  S - Again, nothing special here. I continued to sniff the beer as it warmed to the proper temperature, and still never really smelled anything that knocked my socks off. Typical darker malt scents including brown sugar and toffee. Not much in the way of hops.  T - Do as the bottle says and drink it in the 50 degree range. The flavors changed significantly as the beer warmed and I feel that I missed out a bit. In the last portion of the last glass that I had I detected far more interesting flavors. Alcohol is definitely present at 10%, but it adds to the malty and dark fruit flavors, rather than detracting from them.  M - Take what I said about temperature in the Taste section and double down on it. As the beer warmed the mouthfeel became increasingly lively. The carbonation, which is barely visible in the appearance, is quite obvious in the feel. Truly an exceptional feeling.  O - This beer improves significantly as it warms. I took it out of the fridge maybe 20 minutes before drinking, and it should have been longer, although I was fortunate to see how the flavors changed. The other thing is the alcohol. I had about 2/3 of a bottle and I really feel it. This is a really nice beer to split, probably after dinner.

Glowing ruby highlights illuminate small floating particles when held to the light. A one finger airy beige head formed on the pour and slowly fell to a cap of creaminess leaving some spotty lacing on the way down. Has the look like the good, big Belgians. When you look you know it's going to be packed with flavor. Murky and dark like it's trying to hide it's secret before they spring out on you.  Aroma is big on the dark fruits including plums, prunes, raisins, and figs. I believe there's even some bing cherries in there, not many, but there are a few. Doughy malts are all over the background. A touch of sugary sweetness and slight earthy mustiness. Very nice.  Big tongue coating amount of doughy and bready malt hit right away. not as much of the dark fruit on the tongue as in the aroma. It's there but not as distinct and comes along more mid palate and finishes things off. Figs, prunes, and raisins are the fruit present on the tongue and mix very nicely with some candy like sweetness and a touch of milk chocolate. Earthy dusty yeastiness and a very welcomed alcohol spice add to the complexities.  The mouthfeel of this beer is outstanding. It actually seems light and airy up front but becomes medium-full with a superb velvety texture. Alcohol warmth on the swallow. Great mouthfeel.  This is an easy beer to put away. Far to easy for a beer this large but it is something I could probably only drink a couple glasses of in a sitting just because of the sheer size and complexities.  An exceptional quad from an exceptional brewery. Loaded with complexities and the only alcohol present comes in as another added layer of spiciness. Only gets better and better as it warms.

Very thick mouthfeel, like drinking a spice carrot cake. A slight touch of hop at the very end.  Overall: I like this so much better than Westy 12.

Head is an off white that lingers  S: All over the place. Initial sensation of toffee like sweetness followed by breadiness from the malt. Looking for the hops reveals, well, nothing. There's some candied fruit as well.  T: If it is possible to have every taste you can find in a beer, this is it. Up front, I get candied fruits followed almost immediately by a disappearance of the candy sensation with lingering fruitiness. Breadiness tamps down the fruit before it takes over and then, just when I think it's dominated by the malt, the hops come into their own. All of it is followed by some warming alcohol that plays a role but never takes over. Actually, nothing takes over. Everything is insanely well balanced.  M: Mostly creamy with a sweetish finish but, as with everything about this beer, not too much. The hops dry it out enough that you don't get a sticky aftertaste.  O: If I was a condemned man and got to choose my last meal, this might well be it. There is so much going on in this beer that I think I could drink it over and over and never figure it out completely.

This beer is unfortunately one such case for me. While imposing to sight, it's very tight on the tongue and nose and there's even an evident disharmony in terms of palatal balance with a clear clash between the needling astringency and soapy dexterous finish.  Picking off anything other than dried fruits and alcohol at both nose and tongue feels like an incredibly ambitious task.

Abt 12 has a deep brown/red color, and doesn't seem to have much (any?) haze. Marvelous to look at.  Smell: I've never had a quadrupel... that's my disclaimer here. I didn't know what to expect going in, other than that this is one of the very best beers in the world, according to a lot of people. I got a lot of doughy bread and dark fruits. The cracker aromas sort of came through in the initial whiff, and the fruits were in the ""after smell"". Very good smelling stuff.  Taste: 10%? Really? Initially I didn't think I really loved this beer all that much, but then I noticed that I was sipping it more often than the other beers I had in my sampler. There's just a lot going on with this beer. The cracker/dough flavors are there in a pretty big way, then the non-descript ""dark fruits"" come in a little bit, and then there's just an alcohol warmth and it's all gone. All the while, Abt 12 is never bitter and never really sweet (and therefore cloying) at all.  I got this beer for a few reasons. First, I've heard insanely good things about it. Second, I had never tasted a quad (to my knowledge) before. Third, and most college-boy esque of me, it had a pretty high ABV and I didn't think it would hurt to get a little buzz going on. Turns out, this may've been my favorite beer from the night. I don't tend to drink imported beer (local jobs, yadayadayada), but this is impressive. It's not cheap, by any means, but this is something worth treating yourself to, time-to-time. This really makes me want to try beers like Rochefort and Westvleteren now... my interest has officially been piqued.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Roguer,4.35,"A - Nut brown pour, leading to a dark, not-quite-perfectly-opaque appearance in the glass, shot through with garnet hue. One full finger of beautiful, thick, cream head, that sticks prodigiously to the sides of the glass. The head lingers for a long, long time.  S - Prunes, nuts, cherries, super dark fruit in general. There's an underlying hint of Belgian yeast and a wine-like alcohol whiff. Toffee. Just a super complex nose.  T - Everything represented in the nose comes through in the flavor, starting with nuts, cherries, and prunes. There is a not insignificant alcohol presence. This is not as sweet as other quads, with an enhanced pecan or walnut profile. Wheat malts and toast. So much going on in every sip.  M - Full mouthfeel, extremely foamy if it sits or chews. Slight sting. Well-balanced and complex. Noticeable alcohol warmth down my throat and into my chest, but not unpleasant.  O - It's inevitable that the big quads will be pit against each other. So, how does this rank? As far as craftsmanship, it does not lag Roche 8 at all. As to the flavor profile, however, there is a definite difference. This is the least sweet quad I've ever had (aroma notwithstanding). All dubs and quads come across as a little nutty to me, but this one perhaps the most. It also has the most noticeable alcohol presence.  None of this makes St. B 12 a bad beer or worse quad. Perhaps not as perfect for my personal palate, and perhaps not for yours (there's only one obvious way to find out). In fact, it's a fantastic beer. I'd love to have one aged.  Poured into a Chimay goblet.  Thanks to BigJon for the trade!",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,XavierK31,3.99,"To be honest, this isn't my favorite Quad that I've ever had, but it was good. Very thick, with a rich character and flavor. My only complaint was that it lacked the complexity I prefer in beers. Not as many undertones of other flavors other than the essence of strong beer",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,JerzDevl2000,4.59,"Finally got around to giving this a go, as I picked up a bottle of this at Top Hops a few weeks back. I only got the 11.2 oz one since this was so strong and I figured that it would take a while to down. Sure enough, it did...but that's not a bad thing at all. This is so strong, rich, and refined that anything less than a slow savoring of this beer would be a disservice and a way to cheat oneself out of all this has to offer.  Wonderful appearance to the pour, as the radiant dark raisin hue was still thin enough around the edges to show some light through, revealing the sediment that had to be swirled out of this bottle. Nice head to this too as I had to let a lot of it settle before pouring out the last little cloudy portion of the bottle, and the lacing wasn't half bad either. Not as strong an aroma to this as I would have liked, but there was enough candied sugar, plum, and pear to be detected in the nose and in the taste as well. This faded to a well-balanced back that reminded me partially of a fine Belgian Pale Ale crossed with Champagne, since the carbonation came through and carried with it just a hint of earthy, sour funk. The aftertaste kept this lightness with a bit of spicy, dark bread, which melded nicely into the next sip as I repeated the process.  Yes, this was strong but it never tasted it and I could have easily downed a few of these over a given night. There's a reason why beers like this are rated so high - anything balanced this well, smooth, and is strong without being overt is the hallmark of a great brew and this fit that bill. I'm always amazed at how much Belgian beers have to offer and how something like this is so highly rated by so many. Even on a muggy night like tonight, this was refreshing and anyone who reviews beers on here needs to get their hands on this and find out for his or herself why this is one of the classics. Highly recommended.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,BonerKoozie,4.88,"Bottle poured into a chalice. A- DARK. Normal quad coloring. This beer is not normal though. S-Malts, fruit, banana, toast. T- too many people think of rochefort (sp?) 10. As the ""perfect"" quad. Wrong. Abt 12 has a universal taste profile mimicking perfection. It's warming as it goes down, and gets sweet and toasty towards the end. Low hop presence, smokey roasted malt content evident.  F- bigger, but not huge. Enough to notice, but nothing crazy. Medium feel,but in no way a session beer. Overall- one of the best as far as the style goes. Not if, but when you try it, thank yourself for indulging a monks philosophy of making beer.

Pours a deep murky amber brown with just a touch of red. Two fingers of light tan head, fuzzy and full. Good retention, okay lacing. Very nice.  Smell is fruity and rich, but weaker than I'd like it to be. Smells like a solid, malty quad, it's just not potent enough.  Taste is outstanding - a blend of deep fruity flavors like figs and brown sugar, with a higher, balancing, slightly astringent bitterness in the finish. Polished, and quite good.  Feel is fantastic. Full-bodied, frothy and fluffy. Divine.  An excellent quad. I'd probably pick Rochefort 10 over it, but it's obvious that it's in the top tier.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Brown sugar and molassis with some spice (clove, cinnamon) on the finish.  T: The taste is just like the smell! Big dark fruit Raisins, cherry, fig, and plum come in waves, as if they were candied with brown sugar. A touch of burnt toast, with alot of yeast. Reminiscent of dark rum. Some spice in there. A little bit of an earthy, grassy quality. Lots of caramel and toffee. So good.  M: There is a good amount of carbonation in here. full bodied. highly drinkable.  O: One of my favorite quads.

The beer is dark, but light travels through easily when held to a light source.  S: Malt and yeast esters predominate, with fig and other fruits alongside dark candi filling out the aroma profile. A little bit of spiciness is detectable, but isn't strong. A little bit of eathiness, and maybe something vaguely metallic are evident, but again, not strongly.  T: Sweet, smooth, and delicious. Everything from the nose is there, and on the finish the alcohol shows through, strengthening as it warms.  M: Well carbonated with a medium mouthfeel that finishes smoothly and refreshingly. Incredibly drinkable. The conditioning and the mouthfeel that I get from the 750mL bottles is on the average much better than I've gotten from the smaller bottles or draught, so I tend to stick with these bottles. The mouthfeel is perfect. More highly carbonated than I'd expect, but it contributes only in positive ways. Wonderful.  O: One of my favorite beers.

259,1708,thecheapies,4.29,"11.04.07. That would be a best before date, in European date-coding. Served in a Westvleteren chalice.  Practically opaque chestnut brown. Very cloudy, probably, but hard to tell for sure. Barely the purpley-brick red tint to the color. Looks solidly brown. Looks good. Head crowned up at about an inch and trailed slowly away with soppy tan foam sitting up top.  Maltiness hits the nose first, and a good dose of it. Then, big dark fruits and a vastly estery yeast character takes over. Heartily phenolic and a little spicy. Some rustic earthiness comes through like an aged hop. Fig, plum, black cherry, red grape, ripe apricot, and quince all come through with a lightly vinous touch and lots of candi sugar. Hints of vanilla. Well-tempered, with the maltiness smelling big, at first, but then just showing off with the adjusted balance of the fruity yeast notes.  A ripe phenolic burst with notes of tobacco and clove-y spice marries with malty dark fruits, a la plum, prune, red grape, and overripe apple. Nice little tinge of an earthy aged hop brings out more of the Belgique. Finishes with grape and red apple skin tannins, something described as peppery, and more clove. A tad figgy, too. Vinous notes (pinot) are tame, but there. Alcohol is nice and fat; chewing through the girth of the flavor with a gluttonous whoop. Enough richness here to cover it, and then some.  Drinks with a warm flatline of booze. Rich with body, almost full. Carbonation adds a little slap, here and there. It's very realized.  Just another great experience with good ol' Abt 12. A phenomenal beer. And, if ya don't know, now ya know... !!",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,BreweryRun,4.65,"Have had this bottle for maybe 9 months at ~45. Bottle was foaming over when I opened it but I got it into a Leffe chalice relatively quickly so no harm no foul.  Smell has light esters, darkfruit/dark malt, and spicy phenols.  Taste starts out with light fruitiness that quickly turns into more of a dark fruit (raisin, plum) mixed with cereal grain flavor, the finish is a spicy peppercorn flavor with a slight alcohol sweetness. As it warms the finishing flavors creep into the middle of the mouth and the spicy/alcohol flavors become more dominant. That being said the subtle alcohol is not solvent-like at all, it adds nicely to the other flavors.  Mouthfeel is medium-full.  Overall a great Quad with everything I like about good Belgian beers and nothing I don't. Personally I think it better slightly colder (high 40s to low 50s) as its slightly more harsh at higher temps but a world class beer that is incredibly balanced without being overwhelming.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Misanthropy_Sipping,5,"I think I am pretty sure this was the first quardupel ale I had ever had. Still a favorite and often what I compare to other quads as it is just so straightforward and so good for the style.  Pours a very deep rust/ deep deep brown. There is a very beautiful ruby hew when held to the light. Has a vigorous khaki head.  There is a lot going on in the smell. Almost a woody scent, cherries, Belgian candi sugar, brown sugar, plums, dates, vanilla, , spice, a bit yeasty. Very earthy tone going on. A mellow smell, but awfully complex.  Tastes wonderful. Again, a whole lot going on. There is almost a cinnamon dryness to it. There is spice and cherries, a bit of yeast. Dates, brown and Belgian candi sugar, burnt caramel, a tad plumy. There is a hint of vanilla... just awesome. everything is in the right place and well balanced. There is a bit of an herbal/woody hop bitterness to finish it all off.  Mouthfeel is really great too. I like to pour mine a bit vigorously but the carbonation still clings on nicely. Surprisingly drinkable. A bit sticky on the back of the mouth but it matches with the sweet taste of this beer. It's what's expected. For being a medium to heavy body, I am always surprised at how drinkable this is.  Overall, excellent. As mentioned, this is one of the quads I base opinion of others off of just because it is so solid.

Okay retention and okay lacing.  S: Spicy, sweet, boozy, warm. Spicy bitter orange tones right off the bat with a lot of earthy banana and vanilla. A little clove-tinged spice. Smells pretty exotic and busy.  T: Nutmeg, cinnamon and banana. Sweet and relatively creamy. There is earthy sweetness but the spiciness is what predominates.  M: Nice and smooth. Really warm and boozy (not so much in taste), Medium body with good relatively strong carbonation.  O: In general a damn fine beer. Not completely my style but fantastic nonetheless. I think that it would be a really great beer for a cold winter night or to cellar for a while. Really tastes like ""Fall"". Nutmeg, cinnamon, cardamom, raisins, booze. It's a delicious beer.

259,1708,RobertColianni,4.15,"11.2oz. Bottle 16oz. Coffee Tulip  A: Abt. 12 pours a deep scarlet body with large, floating yeast sediments that eventually stagnate towards the bottom of the glassware. A meticulous head collects large, perfectly shaped orbs shooting up from the base. These perfect orbs are truly a beautiful work of art to observe as they quickly find their place within the khaki , creamy head. Watching this beauty form reminded me of watching a computer play Tetris on a professional level. I could watch this natural wonder for days.  S: The aromas permeating the air around me were absolutely joyous: pure raisin, perfectly sticky dates, glazed prunes, and a rumbling raspberry tartness combines in what can only be described as bliss.  T: A wonderful taste profile spurs from Abt. 12 as a rum-like toffee or syrupy sweetness engulfs my palate. The deep, rich sweetness of a well aged fruitcake comes to mind.  M: Abt. 12 was slightly syrup-like to the tongue, but with the beautiful waves of carbonation, the viscosity was toned down to the tune of a perfect sipper.  OVERALL: St. Bernardus Abt. 12 is truly a work of art, however from my experience, I found this quadruple to be far too sweet to handle. As discussed in my group, we could all enjoy and appreciate the deep aroma, the rich taste, and the heavenly appearance of this magnificent creation, but actually moving forward beyond five or six sips just became too much of a task. This is a thinkers beer and one that was created with much love and quality, but the sweetness is just too close to a confection and that's not really very pleasant.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Smell - There is a plethora of smells from this delightful brew, including but not limited to caramel, malts, breads, yeast, and a little chocolate. There is even a little hint of spices in there as well. It smells delicious.  Taste - Dark fruits, nuttiness, caramel malts. There is a bit of mild hop bitter in the front, but the primary taste of the drink is malty sweetness. A bit of a kick from the booze  Mouthfeel - Creamy, smooth, wonderful. Booze is detectable, oh well. If you don't like booze, you probably wouldn't be reading this. Good level of carbonation, just a thick, rich beer throughout.

259,1708,SpruceMoose,4.54,"When it comes to Belgian beers, most of us see it as, mainly, a dichotomy between Trappist beers and Abbey beers. We love our Chimay and La Trappe, but also our Leffe. However, one of the more legendary examples of Abbey brewing brilliance, the St. Bernardus Abt 12, adds heavy weight to the argument between the two produces of beer as to who should be revered as the greatest producer of quality Belgian beer. Who would've thought that beer could be so divided by religion?  Serving Type: 330 ml bottle, along with its characteristic smiling bishop, poured slowly into a Grimbergen goblet.  Appearance: The slow pour produces a thick head, neither white nor cream, which retains itself with remarkable precision. Beneath it the body sports a deep copper or ruby red colour. Bubbles can be seen quickly rising beneath the head that cling to the glass and add to this beer's remarkable appeal.  Smell: Aromas of fruit, honey, toffee, caramel, nuttiness, chocolate and darker malts enchant the senses. Bewdeful.  Taste: Toffee and bittering hops are immediately noticeable, followed by an even sweeter malt finish. The head is delightfully creamy and an absolute pleasure to sip through. The alcohol is not well masked with a booziness noticeable after the swallow, although the 10% ABV strength enables me to forgive Brouwerij St. Bernardus for this very minor flaw.  Mouthfeel: Bold and dense; everything you'd expect from a Belgian abbey ale. The soft, marshmallow texture of the head contrasts beautifully to the thickness of the body. Carbonation is consistent and not overwhelming.  Overall: An absolute treat for quadruppel aficionados or even those who are mildly interested in delving deeper into the Belgian beer scene. St. Bernardus serves as a brilliant winter warmer on those cold nights with its robust taste and glowing warmth. I would actively seek this out again, for having just one of these would be akin to the highest of sins and would probably result in me being tried in front of some Benedictine court for my gross blasphemy.

The flavors just blossom amongst all the malt, caramel, leather, dark fruit, belgian yeast, slight wooded root, spices, and biscuit when warmed. Aromatically dreamy though not as deep as the taste. Wonderfully textured in the body, this quad has every aspect you would hope for, warm, yeasty and malts are definitive, and the subtle spice textures are done well!

259,1708,KBomb,4.53,"A delight to the eyes. Murky brown body is nice and has depth and complexity, but the lacing and carbonation is unparalleled. A little tilt to the glass reveals cascading effervescence that leaves thick lacing that looks like thousands of tiny diamonds, retreating back into the beer like a receding tide at the beach.  Fresh fruits dominate the aromas: green apple peel, plum, & grape. Behind it are sweet bready malts and anticipated belgian yeast. A note of peppery clove sneaks around the aromas as well.  The taste is actually a little less sweet than other quads that look this dark and smell this fruity. There's that bready sweetness for sure, but without much of that candied sugar taste you expect from similarly ""big"" quads. The flavor has an earthiness to it that makes it distinct. Finish has a touch of sour and a touch of spiciness.  That carbonation that delighted the eyes first brings happiness to the tongue as well. Manages to feel creamy but dry.

259,1708,THANAT0PSIS,4.69,"St. Bernardus Abt 12  Appearance: This legendary Abbey-brewed quad pours a deep, opaque mahogany, bordering on the color of pipe tobacco. It is crowned with a massive, fluffy, khaki-colored head that overflows out of the glass on even a gentle pour; it is out of the range of measuring with fingers. The retention is astounding, and the lacing is equally as impressive. There is very obviously (and predictably) sediment floating throughout the syrupy liquid, and this makes it an ugly-yet-pretty beer not unlike Heady Topper. This beer has been made this way at St. Bernardus since 1946, and the recipe is presumably older than that, so it is difficult to dock the beer too much for being somewhat unappealing.  Aroma: As expected for a quad, dark fruits (plums, figs, cherries) and candi sugar dominate. Belgian yeast, of course, is also a big presence, which imparts the classic bubblegum, slightly medicinal notes. Alcohol is reasonably prominent, which hits beside with a curious wood character. Lastly, spiciness and indiscriminate fruity esters linger on the nose, along with a sugary sweetness. This smells like a classic and delicious quad.  Taste: Like most beers, this follows the nose pretty well. There are lots of the dark fruits described above, in addition to a nice malty nuttiness that was not detected in the aroma. The cherry notes even have a nice twinge of sourness. The middle of the mouth is sweet and sticky but not overly so, and it is swept aside by a slight hop bitterness and yeasty spiciness, as well as the warmth from the alcohol. The spices and fruit esters, just as predicted by the nose, linger on the tongue. This is a very tasty, and surprisingly drinkable example of a quad. To put the taste in a word: ripe.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, medium bodied, slick, chalky/yeasty, creamy, and perfectly carbonated are all words that could describe this beer. The alcohol is there, but in a pleasantly warming capacity. The sour cherries and mild hops impart the barest hint of dryness, but they really do not stand a chance to the huge malt bill and complexity of this beer.  Overall: While it does not quite match the complexity and overall drinkability of Rochefort 10, this is still a delicious and widely available example of a Belgian quad. The plus is that this beer is available in larger, more sharable quantities, whereas Rochefort is only found in 11.2 oz bottles. There is really nothing more to say other than this does the quad style damn near to perfection. Nothing more, nothing less. 18.5/20",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

The after taste is dominated by alcohol; as if you had just taken a shot of smooth bourbon.  Overall- There just wasn't enough flavor.

On a recent trip to Philly, the wife and I popped in to Monks as I heard they had Pliny the Elder on tap and I was very eager to try one of the highest rated IPAs on this site. I ordered the Pliny while my wife got the St Bernardus. The Pliny was unbelievable but the St Bernardus was just on a different level.

259,1708,artoolemomo,4.08,"Appearance- Very similar to Westy 12 but the head does not rise up as vigorously and dissipates a lot quicker. The head is light beige and leaves lacing around the rim with not much else; the body is lighter than Westy 12 and is chestnut brown with orange, red hues.  Smell- It also is not very strong. I did not even put this in the fridge after buying it at the store. It has been out for an hour so it should be fairly warmed up. The nose is mainly ester and fruit with typical Belgian yeast and spice. This does not smell very alcoholic. There is peach, banana, melon, and cloves. There is also apple and pear and strawberry. Its aroma is much more balanced than Westy 12.  Taste- The front of my first sip reveals much of the aroma characteristics intensified. There isn't as much carbonation as with Westy 12 and it follows with much of the same bitterness as Westy 12 does- a bitter cheese and yeast taste with fig and dates and smoke. These beers would be a little difficult to distinguish. Westy is much more robust and in your face and sizzles with carbonation. I think that I prefer the Westy slightly more. I'm really going to have to get Rochefort 10 to make a more informed decision about these types of beer. It starts with slightly bitter strawberry and moves into wood, dark bread, and smoke. If this is the style, I may have been to harsh on Westy 12 and I may simply not like Quadrupels. Although I do remember Rochefort 10 to be quite enjoyable. This does not have the complexity of Westy 12 though it seems like I am tasting more. My palate has been out of practice.  There is a lot of raisin in the taste and bigger gulps reveal and more integrated and less abrasive taste. It's pretty much as subtle as I want it to be so I don't really have any desire to cellar this beer in the future. There is also honey at the end.  Mouth- Slightly carbonated and seems a little heavier than Westy and a little syrupy. It goes down very easily.  Drinkability- This is very drinkable with none of the astringency and heat of Westy 12. Plus at 13 bucks for a 25.4 oz, I have no problem taking swigs from my tulip. It's a little liberating in fact.  Overall- A very nice beer which is changing my opinion about Westy 12, for the better. I would give this beer an A- to A with Westy 12 moving between B+ to A+ depending on potential. This is great for the price. At 10 %, you're pretty much getting 4 beers for 12 bucks. Not bad at all.

259,1708,Chrysostom,5,"God has a Son, Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is God the Son, the Son of God, and is fully God himself. He is God manifest in the flesh. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God...there was a man, John, who came to preach the Word.  Now, the Beergod has a son, St Bernardus (Abt 12). St Bernardus is the Son of the Beergod, and in him the fullness of the Beergodhead dwells bodily. He is Beergod manifest in the glass. God created the Beergod, and St Bernardus was in the beginning with the Beergod, and St Bernardus is the Beergod...there is a man, by the name of Chrysostom, who came to preach the Word.  ""When the Beergod became flesh, after dinner, he likewise took a bottle of St Bernardus and poured it, saying, This is my blood of the Brew Covenant, which is poured out for many for the inebriation of souls.""  St Bernardus is the best beer in the world. Chimay is magnificently superb: it is a signal beer. Other beers: excellent. But St Bernardus Abbot 12 is the Beergod incarnate, made in to a liquid in a glass by some not-monk-monks, to dwell amongst and be drunk by men.  The only thing I have a question on is ""appearance""... It's hard to pour, and if poured poorly, will get a bunch of the black yeast-floaties in it, which are unappetizing. If poured poorly, it's a 4.75 on appearance. If poured correctly, it's a 7 out of 5.  Presentation: 750mL, corked and caged. Absolutely awesome label of a jolly, tipsy monk (they changed the colours of his robes when St Bernardus became ""not Trappist"" about 20 years ago, so he's not a member of any identifiable order now... he used to be in Trappist habit) with ruddy cheeks, making the Priest's sign of benediction with one hand, and toasting your health with an overflowing goblet of St Bernardus in the other. Is there any better way to do so?  A: Poured in to Chimay chalice. A cloudy dark brown, like clean mud made from good earth, which appears black from many angles. Light will show through edges when held directly to a source of light, but the heart is impenetrably opaque, much as the complexity of this beer itself is. On a proper, smooth pour, one finger of thick, creamy, pillowy head, overflowing the rim, is left, which recedes slowly to a thin layer on the face of the beer. It laces the glass in an almost-solid sheet of foam. Don't judge a book by its cover? You can judge this beer by the label, and the pour.  ""It looks like what a quad should look like.""  S: Surprisingly subdued for such a big beer. There are strong notes of brown malt (think Samuel Smith's Nut Brown) and Belgian yeast, with a mild alcohol character. However, the malt smells -thick-: there is no other way that comes to mind to describe it. There are hints of molasses, brown sugar, grape, prune, date, fig, and other dark fruit, as is par for the course, although the fruit character is much more mild when compared to such a beer as Westmalle Dubbel. The smell becomes more pronounced as it warms. I'm surprised I can smell so little - I'm more-than-likely halfway-ill, so that's probably dulling my olfaction.  ""It smells like what a quad should smell like.""  T: Much as the smell, but bigger, bolder, and not subdued. Incredibly complex interplay of malt, a dominant grape-like flavour, sugar, the slightest spiciness, and Arabian dried dates. There is no perceptible alcohol character in the flavor. There is a mild sweetness without cloyingness as it hits the tongue. There is a carbonic astringency on the finish, whether from the subdued hops or carbonation, I don't know. It finishes surprisingly cleanly for such a thick, full, malty libation.  ""It tastes like what beer should taste like.""  M: Highly-carbonated, but blends well with everything else. Causes the flavours to explode on the palate, and contributes to a dry and lingering clean finish. There is a tingle that is left for a moment after the beer has gone, probably due to carbonation. Does not coat the mouth like many malt-bombs that are more familiar, such as double IPAs. Absolutely perfect.  D: Extremely high. A clean beer with complexities begging for another sip, and a completely-hidden, occulted 10% ABV. I could drink 4 or 5 fifths of this, but the drunkenness would have affected my tastebuds to the point that it would be a waste of money; anything more than 2 fifths of this, and you're not getting the full taste - switch to something else.  I gave the smell of this, and appearance, a 4.75 to start, for what reason I don't know, maybe comparison to the Platonic Form of ""beer"" existing in the Third Realm. However, on this earth, I think it unlikely this beer can be surpassed, and know that it has not yet been surpassed.  It was $11.99 for a fifth, but, like Macallan 25 (which is generally in the ~$750 for a fifth), if this was $50+ a fifth, it would still be worth it to taste, even if too expensive to drink regularly.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,GreesyFizeek,4.53,"12 oz bottle split with my girlfriend at Giacomo Hotel in Niagara Falls, NY. Great memories associated with this one as we consumed it during our one-year anniversary trip.  Pours a hazy beautiful brown. Decent sized head. Some sediment is suspended in the glass.  Lots of fruit, bready, biscuity malt in the taste. Some hop bitterness that almost gives it a nice grassy flavor. Strong Belgian yeast flavors as well. Seems to be spiced- possibly with cloves? I'm not sure, but I like it.  Full bodied mouthfeel, well carbonated.  One of the best Belgian beers on the market in the US. A true classic. I will always hold this beer dear in my heart due to the memories associated with drinking it.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Lemke10,4.76,"This pours a medium brown color with a foamy, beige head. It has a very inviting aroma of malts and yeast. The taste is rather amazing and easy to see why this is considered one of the best beers in the world. The texture is well carbonated as wheat, spices, and yeast tickles your taste buds. Quite filling and very well made, as if I would expect anything less from Belgium.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,csrbv,4.96,"A – Dark brown with a dusting of white bubbles that looks fantastic, but it dissipates fast and some lacing that make this brew look even better!  S – Very complex smell. I would have thought the smell was going to be much more intense. It is somewhat mild with medium-fruits, it’s earthy and somewhat peppery spicy aspect to it. Just smells unbelievably good!  T – The taste of this beer just screams quality, is so incredibly complex, and still so drinkable. And it only gets better as it warms in your glass, so each sip is better than the last.  M – The mouth-feel is surprisingly lighter than I would have expected, but it just just about perfect as well. If it was heavier it wouldn't work as well. The steady carbonation gives it a creaminess that is just delightful.  O – This is one of the best beers that I have ever had and surely one of the best beers on the face of the earth. I have been told that is beer is a near duplication of the legendary Trappist Westvleteren 12 (which I have never had).

259,1708,tectactoe,4.59,"Enjoyed this one side-by-side with an '11 Westvleteren XII - thanks to Mike for cracking his open. I've heard from many people that the Abt 12 is the closest (easiest) thing to get to a Westy XII, so I guess we'll see. The pour is certainly a very similar color - brown, copper and murky, maybe a little bit brighter. Unlike the Westy, the Abt 12 has quite a bit of tiny sediment particles. Another big difference is that the head on the Abt 12 is huge, frothy, and has excellent staying power - looks like the froth on top of a latte or something.  Whoof, I close my eyes and take a whiff, and honestly, I could have easily mistaken this for another pour of the Westy. VERY similar in the aroma. Huge complexity and just a never-ending array of components: grapes, figs, dates, candied plums, Belgian yeast and spices, brown sugar, molasses, sweet licorice, light bready malts.... Where does it end? It only gets more inviting and more perplexing as it warms up and introduced some new aromas; pecans, light herbal-ness, more earthy tones, fruity esters, mild booze aromas... So far, I don't think I could draw any ""major"" distinctions from the aromas between Abt 12 and Westy XII. And this was after having them directly back-to-back. Given only one, I probably couldn't accurately discern which was which from the nose alone.  At this point, I'm incredibly impressed, and I'm thinking about just copying and pasting my Westy XII review and using it as my Abt 12 review. Just kidding. The mouth feel is similar, though Abt 12 has a bit more of a sharpness from heavier carbonation, as evidenced by the superior head formation. They both share that delectable Belgian-esque creaminess and they are both full-bodied without being too heavy, sticky, or syrupy. I love the silky smoothness that most Belgian quads deliver, and these two beers are no exception.  I'm sitting here swishing Abt 12 around in my palate, and I'm almost as amazed as I was when I first tasted the Westy XII - just a huge romp around of seemingly millions of flavors. Candied and sugary fruits, grapes, plums - sweet and pleasing without being overly sugary or cloying. Licorice, toffee, light molasses, Belgian yeast, mild spice, and sweet breadiness from the malt. I can see why people compare this to Westy XII - it's the EXACT SAME THING. In all seriousness, the flavor profiles are eerily similar, but I did notice that the Abt 12 was a little ""sharper"" and ""brighter"" - sharper from the carbonation and brighter in the form of softer fruits - I picked up some more definitive apple skin and white grape notes. The Abt 12 also has a touch more of a hop profile, but maybe that's because the Westy XII was a year older? This gave the Abt 12 a bit more bitter leafiness with the bread, butter, and slightly boozy aftertaste.  Wow... Wow, wow, wow. People weren't lying. The Abt 12 really is ridiculously similar to the Westy 12. When all is said and done, I don't think I could tell the difference if I was blindfolded. You could hand me an Abt 12 in a blank glass, tell me it was Westy XII, and I wouldn't be able to argue. That being said, they are both fantastic beers - pinnacles in brewing, and quintessential beers for the style they both represent. At the end of the day, I must give a slight nudge to the Abt 12 though, given it's relatively low price point and incredible availability.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

259,1708,PsilohsaiBiN,4.65,"Appearance: Crimson, with a small beige head that recedes after a bit.  Smell: Coriander, sweet malt, brown sugar, caramel, toffee, dark fruit, cinnamon.  Taste: Follows the smell nicely. A mildly spicy beginning gives way to delicious, bready malt, with some caramel sweetness that all fade away nicely into the finish, leaving some residual spice and bread. It finishes kinda like cream soda, wow. Really good. I think I like this more than Westy 12. The booze is masterfully hidden as well; it's hard to improve on this.  Mouthfeel: There is enough carbonation to keep this from being a syrupy burden, and that makes this a pleasure to drink. It's just right.  Overall: This is the best quad I've ever had. There aren't many points you can deduct from something that's near perfect.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,JamesMN,4.16,"Best by date on bottle of 12/7/17.  Appearance: An opaque amber color with hints of browns and oranges. Poured into the official St. Bernardus glass so the half finger head is spread across quite a large surface area. It is smooth and frothy, almost glossy.  Aroma: Mass quantities of belgian candi syrup giving a caramel and fruit sweetness. Smells better with every whiff. Some darker fruits and dark malt but really buried beneath the wonderful sweet overtones. I just wish it was slightly more aromatic.  Taste: I'm genuinely surprised by the nice amount of bitterness up front. It viciously attacks the palate until the finish with each sip. The dark malt and belgian candi syrup flavor comes through in the middle but it's not nearly as complex as I had expected. The flavor mostly consists of dark fruits, caramel, and bitterness until the finish comes. The aftertaste is a heat from the 10% ABV that seems to warm up all the flavors as well. This creates an interesting contrast because during the actual drinking of Abt 12 you get a lot of bitterness and lighter fruit flavor and then the aftertaste is very hot and dark.  Mouthfeel: Very high carbonation on this one definitely makes the bitterness more intense. Feels like it's only medium in body. Average drinkability if you can get over the intense effervescence.  Final Thoughts: I'm a little let down here because I was hoping for a mind blowing experience. However, it's still a great Quad that I won't say a word against. Would I drink it again? Yes, I'm going to see if that expiration date is for real.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

A couple of is decided we were going to take tonight and visit a few easily accessible classic old world styles and I'm glad we did.

259,1708,trxxpaxxs,3.99,"A: Pours a deep brown with red hues throughout. There is about a finger and a half of a light tan frothy head. The foam settles leaving rocky bubbles all along the top of the beer.  S: The nose is a mix of soaked bread, dates, and brown sugar. The yeast is the dominate scent, but the dark fruit and sugars are still very prevalent.  T: It starts out with that yeasty, soaked, brown bread quality. Big malt and big yeast. That flavor stays on the palate for a bit as the dates, raisins, figs, and candied sugars make themselves more noticeable. As it moves towards the back of the palate, the sweetness mixes with big alcohol and more yeast.  M: Full bodied beer. It's hefty and yeasty up front, sweet and coating in the middle, and yeaty and boozy on the back end.  O: Quads are really a love/hate beer for me... long story... but this is a very well made beer. There are others in the style that I prefer more, but this is solid.

Again, very nice bread notes, brown sugar, Belgian yeast, raisins and plums, citrus, and just a slight touch of chocolate. Nice subtle bubblegum/sugar candy notes create a bit more complexity. Big smooth finish.  M: very nice carbonation, solid medium bodied, and it coats the palate with a awesome sugar candy and bready note.  O: just a terrific brew all the way around. extremely well balanced for its big complexity.

The head is white and fluffy, then slims down to a white sliver on top. Spotted lacing.  S: I get some banana-chip scents, some alcohol scents, and some faint plum scent.  T: I get caramel flavor, and a little alcohol. The flavor is very faint and calm in this beer. Very simple flavors.  M: The mouthfeel is very smooth, and highly carbonated. Medium bodied as it enters the mouth, but airy and light as it leaves the palate.  O: Overall it was enjoyable to drink, mostly because the flavors blended together nicely and it was not too strong of a beer, despite the 10% ABV. I would have liked more complexity to the flavors, but I would not sacrifice the overall experience if it meant complicating the flavor.

A thin blanket of lacing slides back down into the glass, leaving a thin jagged ring behind.  S: Brown cocoa, bakers chocolate, bread pudding, mixed nuts, a bit of bread crust. Dried figs and dates. Plum. Golden raisins soaked in rum. Spicy, estery alcohol. Baked apple pie with cinnamon. yeasty aromas of various spices and even some garden herbs.

T: Bread crust, brown cocoa powder, mixed nuts. Stiff jab of spicy alcohol on the mid-palate. Mildly phenolic with peppery and spicy/garden herb tastes. Dried figs. Brown sugar. Bready desserts. Touch of caramel. Fairly dry throughout. Finishes dry with tastes of bakers chocolate, fig, and lots of fading spices.  M: On the heftier side of medium bodied. There's a little bit of weight to it, but it certainly isn't heavy. Very slightly chewy, creamy and full. Carbonation is ample but not overly aggressive. It picks the body up and has a mild scrubbing effect. The alcohol had a very warming and soothing effect the whole way through, from mouth to stomach. This is one of those beers that warms the body and soothes the mind.  O: The complexity of this beer is outrageous, and rarely rivaled. Truly one of the elite sensory experiences in the beer world.

A lot of spice and light fruit aromas are though. I'm getting a certain pepper aromas, but there fruits and other spices are too well mingled together for me to discern any of them.  With any quad you can expect caramel, a mix of spices such as cloves, a good bit of sugar, and with a darker beer some middle to dark fruits. All that said what makes this beer really stand out and I'm shocked to say this, but justify the high rankings is how they've put it all together. The sweetness in this beer never gets out of hand. The sugars are matched by a clean crisp finish. The spices are over powering to the senses nor are they to be ignored. This bottle is relatively fresh and there's a nice hop bite at the end, imo that is to the beer's advantage as well. Just a flawlessly put together example of the Quad it simply blows beers such as Rochefort 10 out of the water.  It very well be that my enjoyment of this beer over other quads is purely in the mouth feel. The beer is creamy yet light on the mouth and it finishes with this amazing dryness that one might expect from a triple, but never a quad. This is perfection for the style.  This is a true master piece. It isn't a beer I'll drive an hour and a half for again nor one that would be a regular in my rotation, but imagine any real beer drinker not enjoying this one. I really don't generally think much of the Belgian styles, but this beer has found a way to both give the full flavor of a quad without going over the top with spice or sugar.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

259,1708,spoony,4.44,"From an 11.2 oz bottle (best by March 22, 2017) into a chalice.  A-The brew pours with a typically underwhelming (for a Belgian) one-finger head of grey-ish tan head that fades to a thin cap. The beer is murky and tea-colored.  S-The smell is mostly dark, sweet, malted fruits like black cherries, plums, and raisins. There is a light touch of molasses and a pretty significant whiff of sweet, warming alcohol. Just a hint of spice, too.  T-The taste mostly tracks the smell, but with more force. You get the same fruit components, but there is a more earthy, almost vinous taste (maybe tobacco and minerals) that underlies the whole thing. The alcohol, while noticeable, is well-integrated into the rest of the flavor profile. You notice the 10%, but it fits right in.  F-The weight is medium with a light touch of carbonation. Nice balance.  O-This beer was one of the beers to start me into craft some 12 years ago and it is almost as delicious as I remember it, which is a good thing. I cannot say that this is my favorite quad, but it is close and there is nothing wrong with this brew. More particularly, and less nostalgically, I can say that the taste is a nice, complex mix of sweet, fruity malts with subtle touch of earthy, Belgian character. The feel is spot-on for a quad and the whole package is well-balanced.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

S: Orange peel, prunes, and peppercorn. A bit light for the style, but nice.  T: Like the aroma, this is quite light. Prunes mix with orange peel and peppercorn to form a nice, but mild flavor. Integration is nice, but the intensity just isn't there. Booze is quite evident.  M: Medium thickness with high, but appropriate carbonation.  O: The flavors in this integrate very well, but I'd like more complexity and sweetness, and a bit less booze. Maybe it's a bit too green. People talk about this being among the best Quads and very similar to Westy 12. I don't think this is anywhere near as complex as Westy 12, and I find it drier than the already fairly dry for the style Westy.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

259,1708,Tomhet,4.92,"Pours a really dark, opaque brown; virtually no light penetrates this massive brew. A massive three finger, tannish head emerges after a painful pour and dissipates rather quickly, leaving no lacing. Looks pretty syrupy based entirely on the appearance, which is a nice portent for the overall big nature of this beer. Aroma is a miasma of of dark fruits (mainly spiced cherries), figs, and sweet caramel malts. The 10% ABV here can be detected in the aroma in the form of an absolutely intoxicating (no pun intended) scent of sweet fruits (especially the aforementioned cherries, along with other similar smells I can't quite pinpoint) that meld perfectly with the sweet malts. Amazingly balanced aroma.  The first thing that hits me is a distinctly sweet bready note almost completely void of the dark fruits that the aroma would indicate. However, they soon appear in full force as the aforementioned dark cherries supersede the bready malts. The finish is a perfect synthesis of the previous two bready and fruity components I mentioned, which is something I love so much about this: its perfect balance. Mouthfeel is very warm and comforting, and the high alcohol presence leaves a very faint but noticeable warming sensation near the sternum. I would love to drink this on a brisk late autumn night. Carbonation is medium to low; certainly something to sip on over a gradual period, but nothing too heavy.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

S: A notable yet atypical smell coming of the beer is white wine, something reminiscent of a standard Chardonnay (e.g. creamy, nutty). As the beer warms in my hand it develops a significantly hotter more alcoholic tone.  T: Not as in your face as I expected it to be. Heavy on the alcohol, dark fruity plum tones, slight licorice, and bready/sweet cakey maltyness.  M: medium to full bodied, modest amount of carbonation.  Overall: it was good for being available pretty much anywhere. But for the price, the quality wasn't what I was expecting.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

There's something in the smell that reminds me of champagne.  T: Plum, clove, super sweet. A slight citrus note.  M: Oily, plenty of carbonation.  O: I was pretty excited about this beer, but in my opinion it didn't live up to its reputation. It's a really good Quad, but not a great one. Don't not drink this beer, but I highly recommend drinking the Rochefort 10. Better yet drink them side by side.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Not very strong.  T - Sweet cherry, light roasted malt, light clove and banana, candy sugar. A bit yeasty/estery as it warms. Touch of bitterness in the finish. No bold flavors but well-balanced. I like a bit more oomph in my brews but my wife quite-liked the balance and subtlety of flavors here.  M - Medium-heavy body and light-medium carbonation. Smooth yet a bit bubbly.  O - After tastings of the (arguably) top four Belgian Quads, I would rate them in this order for my personal taste preference:  1 = Pannepot 2 = Westvleteren XII 3 = Rochefort 10 4 = St. Bernardus Abt 12.  Of interest, my wife would rate them in this order:  1 = St. Bernardus Abt 12 2 = Pannepot 3 = Westvleteren XII 4 = Rochefort 10  Quads aren't my favorite style, but I/we enjoyed everything about this beer and the others mentioned above.

259,1708,Cylinsier,4.71,"75 cl  This is a re-review. Original December 2012 review is below for posterity. New review April 2020.  Pours dark brown, slightly red when held to light. Head is yellowish, coarse, and pillowy. Retains as a film.  Aroma is of fig, grape, walnut, oak, biscuit, candi sugar, banana, clove, and bretty yeast notes.  Tastes of grape, fig, biscuit, honey, clove, banana, maybe hints of coriander, bretty funk, and light zest.  Full body, fluffy carbonation.  Having now had this beer after the Westy 12, I can say they are extremely similar. The Westy is one of my favorite all time beers and this one certainly emulates a lot of the same elements. The big difference to me is in the taste. The nutty elements in this beer are much more subdued in the Westy, and the dark fruit is a bit more layered in that one. This is still a world-class beer and a real treat any time. Absolutely try if you haven't.  Original review: 4/5/4.5/4.5/4.5  Pours an opaque wood brown with a light tan head, over an inch, somewhat coarse, which dissipates slowly to a film.  Smells of coriander, bretty yeast, wine, grassy malts, and candi sugar.  Tastes of citrus and bready malts, candi sugar, some mild nutty bitterness and some spices like cinnamon and coriander.  Full body with big fluffy carbonation.  A really good beer. I tried this one because it is supposedly the same as Westvleteran's older recipe and since I will have the opportunity to try that soon, I wanted to be able to compare. I really like this, but I've had a couple quads I like more. Still, I wouldn't pass this one up.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Morpheus,4.42,"It was with eager anticipation that I tried this landmark beer. There is no denying that it is representative of 'quads', and as such it becomes the benchmark in comparisons (as placebos are to clinical trials -- Yet, this ain't no sugar pill!)  First, I selected a tulip glass and poured at around 45°F (I prefer a little on the cooler side, as it can warm a little as I sip) It pours with a beautiful foam in a deep brownish-gold, exhibiting a gentle cloudiness of particulate yeast.  Next, I inhale through my mouth first, as to not overwhelm the olfactory senses - faint yeast and malt as to be expected, yet not overpowering. Confirmed with nasal inhalation, and I am pleased at the level of balance, as this is a beer of diligent attention to brewing details.  Foreplay over, we progress to the act of tasting. Notes of a light bitterness, moderate tones of malt, all in a well-balanced exhibition of flavor. I search my mind for ideal food pairings: Wild elk or moose would be appropriate. I think smoked salmon would also provide a pleasing contrast.  Time for cuddles, I mean kudos. This is not my favorite style, and I have previously been disappointed by the offerings of St. Bernardus, yet I am impressed by this product. For my tastes, it is not for down time after work, or as a thirst quencher. This is one to crack open to accompany a wonderful meal.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,JCaweinstein,4.47,"Ruby brown in color and from what I can tell it is cloudy. There I a one finger off white head that has excellent retention. This beer looks very inviting in my Duvel tulip. The aromas are popping out! I'm picking up caramel and fruity esters which make this a wonderful smelling beer. Caramel with roasted malt flavors are the star. There is also a very nice fruity (raisins) ester that goes along with this Belgian ale. As the beer warms I am also tasting the alcohol. A full bodied beer that's very smooth. There is also some crispness from the high level of carbonation. Again, as it approaches room temperature there is a bit of heat coming from the alcohol. It's been a long time since I've gotten to enjoy this classic beer. It is quite a treat to be drinking this Belgian on such a cold winter night. I will be having this beer again, sooner rather than later and I also plan on grabbing a few of these for my cellar, see it again in about 15 years!",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Color is actually very similar to the beer the monk on the label is holding!  -Smell 4.0: Bouquet speaks volumes about this brew. Lots of deep, earthy tones that indicate a long cellaring. I also pick up, on the opposite end of the spectrum, some light and pleasant sweet notes from the malt.  -Taste 4.5: Front is both slightly sour and sweet and just in the front of the palate. Middle is smooth, dry and almost non-existent. Finish has a cloying sweetness, but just on the sides of the palate. Finish also features delightful light anise, leather and dried fruit flavors. Aftertaste is long and dry and features a clean maltiness. Nuanced, balanced and excellent.  -Mouthfeel 4.5: Very rare experience: the conditioning of the beer actually ties into the taste. Without the balance of the bubbles, the layers of the finish would be lost.  -Overall 4.5: Excellent beer. Surprisingly light considering that this is a Quad, and there is no hint of the 10% ABV.

Huge billowing head of tan foam forms after a slow pour, first leaving behind a thin collar, then delicate arcs of lace that slowly settle back into the beer.

I an detecting some nice vanilla scents and of course the characteristic ""dark ripe fruits"" everybody describes when reviewing Quads, in spades.  T - I waited to take it all in before sipping this fine brew and it doesn't disappoint. Lots of dark, sweet, vinous fruits linger on the palate before being washed away by leafy hop goodness.

The bottle describes it as a ""brown ale"", kind of in the same way someone might call a Ferrari a ""red car"". There is so much going on yet it never overtaxes the palate.

Interestingly, when the Brouwerij Westvleteren Monastery needed to update its facility, it gave St. Bernardus the recipes to its beers, including the 12, so that production would continue. After the update, St. Bernardus's 12 recipe seemed to change to match that of Westvleteren's holy grail of a beer. In addition, the bottles are exactly the same size and shape, the only difference being that St. Bernardus has a label. When speaking to the locals, they will tell you that the only difference in the beers now besides commercial availability is the water source, which gives Westvleteren its claim to fame.

There is a LOT of lacing on the glass - not the ringed lacing of a good IPA, but spotty with large clumps.  S: Lots of caramel malts, stewed dark fruits (like fig, plum, and raisin), lighter fruit esters (pear, apple), and a hint of chocolate. Perhaps not as enchantingly nuanced as Rochefort 10, but still wondrously aromatic. Nicely bready.  T: The very first sip is loaded with chocolate, caramel, and dark fruit. After a few more sips, a balanced sensation of pears and phenols pop up on the finish along side faint alcohol warmth. I can also pick up a touch of raspberry and leafy tobacco as well, and the aftertaste has a bit of a milky cream flavor that is immensely enjoyable. It takes a while, but eventually, a spiced sensation of subtle nutmeg and cinnamon on the palate will show itself a little more than half way down the glass. Quite complex, but a little less so than Rochefort 10 - which is a moot point at the end of the day. This still has top caliber balance and craftsmanship.  M: Not perfectly delicate, but the body's thickness is perfect. There's just enough of a cleanliness to the finish to encourage one to drink this faster. The booze manifests as a slight warmth on the tongue and stomach - but because of its balance, it just works in concert with the whole experience.  O: It might be one of the more drinkable and balanced quads I've ever had. 'Course, I've never had Westy 12, but Hell, doesn't Westy 12 have a very, VERY similar recipe to this? Ah well, that doesn't matter, because it's every bit as mindblowing as I hoped.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,augustgarage,4.42,"Best before November 26, 2013 (making this an '08 vintage I think). Poured from a caged-and-corked 750mL bottle into my Westvleteren goblet. Served lightly chilled.  Something of a slow-gusher, requiring frequent re-fills (not that I'm complaining). The liquid is a rosewood/carmine body with crimson highlights, suffused by dark tiny particles of sediment and capped by a thin persistent beige head. Superior retention; ornate delicate arcs of lacing swim in a sea of viscous tears.  Delicate but complex and lovely aroma reveals some oxidation with pleasing notes of port, demerara sugar, leather, tobacco, and deep bready malt and yeast elements. Very low floral notes (roses, violets), treacle, and toast.  Time has married all the flavors into something greater than the sum of their parts, but teasing apart the different tastes is difficult. Perfect integration of stewed fruits, leaf litter, biscuit dough, breakfast tea, fresh cream, and on and on. Alcohol is toned down and contributes additional body and flavor, but the heat is completely tamed now. Medium-finish with enough dryness to draw you back for another sip. Pretty close to perfection.  Creamy, soft, slighly oily mouth-feel. Still fully carbonated...you could probably cellar this for a decade without it going completely flat.  A superb ale; while not my very favorite quad per-se, it is more widely available than the very few examples I might prefer.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,ujsplace,4.65,"Poured into a chalice.  The deep brown ale yields a massive, rocky cream colored head that fades to about 1/4 inch and then simply stops, leaving a thick blanket. Ample lacing clings to the sides of the glass. A good looking brew.  Smells of caramel malts, toffee, dark fruit - cherries raisin and toasted bread.  The taste is predominantly dark fruits; cherries, raisins, plums along with some nice spicing. Maybe a hint of cloves, nuts and some vanilla along with some faint hop presence. The alcohol is definitely present and warming, but it is nice on a cold night.  Medium, well carbonated.  A tremendous brew. A pleasure to savor and enjoy slowly - the temptation is there to go nuts, but some restraint is in order given that I only have one bottle. Wow.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Onenote81,4.25,"Spent the holiday weekend down in Greenville, SC with some friends and had to go the Trappe Door for my Belgian fix. I really wanted a Quad, but alas, there were none on draft. This is one I've wanted to try for quite some time, but keep passing up. Not this time. This was the small 11.2oz bottle, poured into a St. Bernardus chalice.  Pours a dark ruby-mahogany garnet with a small sheet of lace on top. Rich aroma of plum, grape, stawberry, alcohol, all washed in a pleasant floral scent. Carbonated well. Good heft to this makes this a great sipper. Holds up the richness of this beer quite well.  The flavors mirror the aroma making this one a nice decadent treat. Fig, raisin, plum, molasses, syrup, and just a touch of booze on the finish. There's a lot going on here, and I'm not sure this bottle was big enough for me to capture all of the nuances. I guess that's what the 750s are for. This was a treat, and one I would gladly have again.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,KKB,4.8,"A – A caramel-orange body with a nice heaping pile of wheat bubbles that looks just glorious, even if it dissipates somewhat sooner than I might like and leaves little lacing—probably owing to the high ABV.  S – Very interesting smelling, really you don’t see it coming. I would have thought the smell was going to be much more intense. It is somewhat caramely and mild with not quite dark fruits, more like medium-fruits, it’s earthy and somewhat bready as well, and it has a beautiful clove and peppery spicy aspect to it; also, dare I say there are some hops involved here? It is very clean too, my first reaction was that there was a little bit of hay-funk going on in here but it really was just the blending of smells. It’s a plus really. Just smells unbelievably good.  T – This is up there with the best tasting beers that I have ever had the pleasure of imbibing. It’s funny, how you know with the very first sip whether or not what your are drinking is a truly great beer, it possesses a quality that instantaneously identifies itself—almost a magic element to it—and this has that. This beer just screams quality, is so incredibly complex, and compulsively drinkable. It has a toasted bready flavor to it, steely caramel, unsweetened figs, tobacco, clove, big pepper, slight hops, very mild raisins. And it only gets better as it warms.  M – The mouthfeel is surprisingly lighter than I would have expected, but it just just about perfect as well. If it was heavier it wouldn’t work as well. The steady carbonation gives it a creaminess that is just delightful.  O – This is one of the best beers that I have ever had and surely one of the best beers on the face of the earth. I would highly recommend this to just about anyone from a novice beer drinker like myself to a seasoned veteran. Bravo St. Bernardus, bravo.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

259,1708,Maakun,4.03,"Pours a nice dark brown with hints of red. Nice compact head that lasts for a very long time in the Orval glass.  Smell is slightly sweet and not very strong. Dades, malt, maybe even some chocolate.  Taste is sweet, some dark bready malts, almost rye, dried dark fruits. A slightly burned touch. Then a nice touch of hops, some dark sugars, light yeasty bitterness.  Mouth is medium with medium carbonation. Feels very light for a 10% beer, but not very remarkable.  Overall this is good stuff, but the balance between the sweet and more bitter flavours could be better. Still very enjoyable.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,williamjbauer,4.04,"Bottled served in a shaker pint glass  A - Murky tea colored brown hue with 2 finger very bubbly head with average retention and minimal lacing, with some yeast sediment to boot.  S - Cloves, tobacco, malt, biscuits, coriander, peppery spice, stagnant water, funky yeast.  T - Immediately the booze, clove, peppery spices, and a bit of bitter hits me. My palate is so warm my face feels like it is turning red. The bready yeast is very present in the background but there is too much going on to take real notice of it. The booze dominates for me with a quick dry bitter finish that is not entirely to my liking.  M - Medium body, effervescent high carbonation, very dry finish, moderate-high warming alcohol.  O - This is one of those beers that I appreciate and can see what others enjoy, but I don't particularly like much myself. This is a high quality quad, but it a little bitter and too spicy compared to others in this style I enjoy.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Very murky reddish/amber/brown. Two finger fluffy head that lasted thirty seconds leaving a small layer around the top of the beer. Did I mention the yeast is now making its way to the top of the beer?  Smell- Cherry, malts, yeast, grapes. Smells like any other quad I've had. Alcohol is hidden though.  Taste- Yeast, malt, a little alcohol. Some fruit, maybe what I was smelling earlier. Not overly impressed.  Mouthfeel- Quite carbonated. Sits in your mouth pretty heavy. Its pretty big.  Overall. Good. Not the best quad I've ever had, definantly not bad by any means. Smell is great, but the taste lacks in my opinion. Good on a cold night like this though.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,mcanderson0,4.38,"Poured from a 25.4 oz bottle into a bordeaux wine glass.  A: Deep brown when poured but against light is a deep opaque orange color. Head pours thick and recedes to a thin off white film that lasts throughout the quaff. Lacing seems thick at first but slips down the glass gradually.  S: I smell lightly fried hash browns/potatos with a touch of roasted nuts. A sugary sweetness breaks through eventually revealing maltier undertones. Figs and walnuts.  T: The taste follows the nose except the sweet character is noticed ahead of the earthy tones. Some raw nuts and fall time bread flavors are evident. Theres a spicy tinge I can't quite place. The taste on the back of the palate reminds me of a very smooth and earthy Yunnan tea.  M: Smooth and wholesome. Again, like a luscious Yunnan Gold black tea variety.  O: Delicious. The look and palate of an English Porter but with a spicier and more complex flavor, likely due to the Belgian yeast. The great availability of this beer in my area means I will keep this one in stock in the pantry.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Thehuntmaster,4.37,"750ml bottle 10,0% ABV. Served lightly chilled in an over sized wine glass. Best Before: 11/10/2017  Appearance: The beer appears medium brown in the glass, with a back light showing it so be a fairly clear deep red, with beautiful golden edges. A gentle pour yields a massive cream coloured head, that displays excellent retention and leaves some patchy lacing.  Smell: Dark fruits (figs, raisins and plums) dominate the nose, along side a bready quality and sweet caramel. Other notes include: Toasted brown bread, some spices (mostly clove, with a little black pepper), an earthy note, Belgian yeast and a vinous character.  Taste: Mmmm, this is an absolutely delicious quad. Dark fruits dominate the flavour with figs, plums, raisins (dark and golden) and vinous notes. Other notes include toasted brown bread, toasted grains, distinct yeasty esters that almost give a banana character, a touch of earthy tobacco, some spices (cloves and a touch of pepper) and some sweet caramel. There is some alcohol present in the flavour, but it is far from unpleasant.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied (maybe a little fuller), with a high level of fantastically smooth carbonation.  Overall: St. Bernardus ABT 12 is a fantastic quad, but it is not quite as good as I remember.

Mouth: Very smooth, and light bread after-taste with medium carbonation.  Overall: very good beer but you and I both have had better especially factoring in price.

259,1708,Mavigo,4.92,"I've been looking forward to this moment for a long time now. Poured this fine and highly anticipated beer into a chalice.  A: Poured a wonderful cloudy reddish-orange-brown color with a almost purple- maroon tinge to it. Had a very large, about a three finger head, that lasted for a long time, about 10 minutes, the head has a fine, creamy consistency to it. Does not have much lacing.  S: Has a light, refreshing fruity smell to it, smells sweet, yeasty, grainy, like fresh baked bread  T: The taste is outstanding, it's sweet, tastes like burnt brown sugar, tastes like dark fruit, very sumptuous, tastes very yeasty and like bread, followed with a slight warmth from the alcohol, which is well balanced by the flavor.  M: It is very rich and fulfilling, it's on the more carbonated side, but its contrasted with such a thick, exquisite, and complex body, and its complemented by it's rich and intriguing flavor, and as a added bonus, it has a light warmth from the alcohol, but you would not be able to tell that this is 10% ABV, It's strong but it is so well balanced, it's at perfect equilibrium, just wonderful. Does not have much after taste to it at all, just leaves you a smooth and satisfied feel afterwards.  O: It is a stunning beer, the best I've had so far, it has such a rich and bold flavor, very sweet, balanced with bubbly and refreshing carbonation along with the higher ABV, It's a wonderful mixture, I don't know how they do it. All I can say is, I know it's expensive, but just live outside the box for one day and try this beer, It's outstanding.

There's a little bit of fruit there, but it's unidentifiable to me.  Mouthfeel. Medium-full body, medium-strong carbonation. Silky smooth with just a little prickle. Very nice.  Overall.

Beer pours deep brown in color, transmitting basically no light, with a thick and inviting paler brown head. Aroma is deep, malty, and fruity (raisins, prunes).  Flavor is pure enjoyment for any lover of strong beer. Big complex malt backbone, dark fruit, belgian yeast, and perfect balance. I get molasses from the flavor but sweeter treacle in the nose. Moderate carbonation. All together these things add up to a beer which is clearly for slow sipping, but the beer is so damn good that you just can't help but go back for more. So it's kind of a ""fast sipping"" beer although that might change after the first one. As the beer comes to temperature the carbonation becomes creamier and the alcohol emerges a bit headier.

The rich, yeasty flavors that linger long after the crisp finish imparts one hell of a taste experience to this fullest bodied ale. The pour explodes into a foamy head instantly, and the initial effervescence within seconds transforms into a robust fizz that carries the bread-like base into at least 10 different flavors (you can actually discern intermediate overtones of vine fruits, assorted spices, etc.).

Flavour is impecable, it starts with a very full malty sweetness. Shows layers of complexity with plenty of dark fruit flavour. It is lively and very rich at the same time, with remarkable balance. Then a lot dryer toward the end, slightly acidic. This flavour of dry cherries, and aged red wine vinegar lingers on.  Mouthfeel is very big and full.

Seriously caramelized. Some nice underlying spiciness from the yeast. Clove and even some ripe banana in the back. Nice complexity. A little dry earthy/herbal. Sweet and spicy.  Taste: Chewy malts.

259,1708,Arno,3.98,"They say it's a near copy of Westvleteren 12. Reviewed by many as world's best beer. I'm not sure how close this is to the W12, but this is not my favorite beer.  appearance: Copper brown with creme firm head. Nice lacing.  smell: Hard to pin point what i'm getting. It's sort of a acidic medicinal smell together with brown sugar.  taste: There is some medicinal flavors going on, green apple and spices with alcohol in the nose. Some clove and very faintly some cinnamon. Followed by a more bodied brown sugar kick. It's at this point the beer feels more defined and whole. But the finish is then again quite spicy and alcohol tasting. The flavors seem to be gone quite quick.  mouthfeel: Loads of carbonation. Actually quite a kick. Lacks a bit of creaminess to it. It's slighly milky maybe, but leaves a bit of a slimy effect on the pallet.  overall: Not the best beer i've had. Maybe it's because i had high expectations. But i've had 3 the last few months and i've had mixed experiences. Still have 3 in my fridge, so i might change my mind.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

It looks to be clear, near as I can tell. Foam is let loose in a fury of fizziness, eventually condensing to a smooth, dense 3/4th inch cap. Overall retention is a thin layer with a smooth, thicker middle. Very good lace for a quad.  A multitude of complexities are had in the aroma, from fruity to spicy and from spicy to malty. Banana, pear, apple butter, clove, tea leaves, wet flowers, pollen, something akin to coriander, dark bread, raisins, prunes, grape skins, pine needles, toasted sugars and butter toffee. Alcohol is minimal in the aroma.  The taste of Abt 12 has a far greater presence of bread and alcohol, the former occupying much of the flavor profile, while the latter provides a long lasting, moderate burn. Light fruit drift on the peripheries, while the spiciness of the aroma is diminished in vibrancy. On the whole, the flavor are much more blended than are the aromatics. Mild toastiness throughout. On the dry side.  The feel is a medium-full, coating body with moderate carbonation. I was expecting more carbonation based on the quick-rising head, but I'll not complain about fewer bubbles.  Abt 12 is pretty good; it's an enjoyable sipper. I just wish it had more depth of flavor.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

M: Highly carbonated, probably a little too much so as it wipes the flavors out of your mouth fairly quickly. Body is modest for the strength of the beer.

Juicy dark fruits, some dates, spices and some fresh doughy qualities. This beer is hot as well, but that's right up my alley. Almost like drinking a damn good glass of scotch. Burns so good for the first couple of sips and once you get used to the heat you really start to get all of the flavors it has to offer.  Full in body with a ton of carbonation. The combination or high carbonation with the heat of te alcohol makes for a hell of a tongue stinger. The finish on this beer leaves my tongue watering for more.

It poured a very deep mahogany color into the glass, light can barely pass through it. A creamy chocolate to then a semi-light khaki frothy head sits on top of this wonderful quad. The retention is beautiful also, it just won't give up. A decent lacing stares back at you from the side of your glass. Just perfect.  S- Smell and taste are pretty hand and hand with my tastings, but smell is usually the first factor to entice me into a deep ale. The second my nose hit this monumental beer I was hit with a notes of pear, a deep spice and a yeasty/breadiness. It sucked me in almost immediately! Very strong!  T- Yum, and more yum! Fruity, hints of fig... apply pear-ish notes and again the breadiness. There is a a little kick of alcohol in this ale, but a well balanced taste. It finishes with a banana drive and leaves you wanting much more.  MF- Just thick enough but creamy/chewy. An intense mouth feel but a good intense for lack of better words. This quad sits around your palate just long enough to leave you wating for more.  O- 5.0! Just amazing!!! I was hesitant towards grabbing this beer, I don't know why... But this wonderful concoction of smell, taste, look and feel just blew me away! I would recommend this to many, if you see it.... BUY IT!

The aroma is pleasant, lots of yeast up front, dark fruits, a bit of alcohol sweetness and some dark grain. The flavors are wonderful, lots of yeast, cherry, fig, plum, grain, sweetness from the alcohol, which is less detectable, but the yeast provides so much flavor here and it's balanced very well. The body is a bit thinner and crisper than I'd like, not as thick and syrupy as some of the other famous quads.  Verdict: This is definitely one of the best beers that's as available as it is.

259,1708,Darkmagus82,4.17,"Served on tap in a 10 oz chalice glass  Appearance – The beer was served a brownish-red color with only a tiny white head. The head faded very fast to give only a light amount of lacing.  Smell – The aroma was a nice mix of fruit, bread and yeast. There were stronger notes of dark fruit, such as prunes and plum, as well as a good yeast cake aroma. These were all balanced by a semi-sweet brown bread and biscuit aroma. Overall it was quite nice.  Taste – The taste starts out with a good shot of fruit and malt. A sweet dark cherry flavor mixed with a biscuit base great the tongue. As the taste moves on other dark frit flavors enter the tongue and are mixed with notes of a yeasty flavor as well as some candied/sugary flavors. All the while a prune flavor accompanied by an alcohol flavor creep into the taste. At the end a somewhat alcohol flavored, dark fruit sweet and lightly bready flavor are left on the tongue. Delicious.  Mouthfeel- the body of the ber was about right for its abv., being on the creamier and thicker side, with a carbonation level that was on the lower side. Both the body and the carbonation accentuated all the dark fruit and malty flavors as well as complemented te warming feel of the alcol quite nicely.  Overall - Rated high for a reason.

259,1708,rickyleepotts,3.15,"This beer uses the same recipe as the Westvleteren, and is apparently made by the same people. Or should I say… the same monks. From what I hear, the Westvleteren is only available at the abbey. Well, we just ordered two bottles on eBay. The beer is on the list. We will drink one and cellar the other for a later date. Anyway, Sheryl went to the store earlier tonight and grabbed a bottle of the St. Bernardus Abt 12. I had this beer once… on draft at a bar in Chicago. I might have been drunk that night… but I don’t remember this beer being that impressive. But tonight I am focused and ready to give this quad a go. Time to stop talking and start drinking!  In the Glass: I don’t remember this beer being so dark. It pours a dark brown, almost like liquid chocolate in the glass. When pouring I poured for a head, and a head it has. It’s thick, tan, and leaves a nice healthy lace on the site of the glass. This beer has a lot of expectations, so I am excited to see what she tastes like.  Nose: There is a LOT going on in the nose. It has subtle sweetness with some earthy dirt notes peaking through. It smells like a typical quad, but I haven’t had a lot of quads so I am not an expert by any means. I can’t get over how earthy this smells after a second sniff.  Flavor: The flavor is pretty complex. Now, I will warn you… it won’t knock you off your chair. I mean, it’s 10.5%… so it might, but the flavor won’t. It has a very smooth flavor and you would never know it had that much alcohol. The earthy overtones continue on the palate, and the sweetness peaks through at the end. It sticks around into the aftertaste, but isn’t a barleywine sort of sweet.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel is nice. It isn’t very carbonated, and goes down smooth. I wonder if this beer tastes better in Belgium. Maybe I will order one when we are in Belgium this fall. Man, imagine the beers we will drink. Anyway, the mouthfeel is nothing short of nice, and while this isn’t the best beer I have had, I find it hard to believe that the BeerAdvocate “bros” gave this a 100. On that scale, an 85 would make more sense.  Aftertaste: The aftertaste is subtly sweet, but the sweetness doesn’t last for long. It quickly fades and leaves the palate begging for more. As much as this beer doesn’t impress, it does leave for an enjoyable beer that you could easily chug. With the complexity of the nose and the different flavors across the palate, I could see a typical beer drinker not liking this. But thinking about the history of the beer, and what this beer is modeled after, it’s hard not to appreciate it.  This is my second time trying this, and before we started drinking we ordered two bottles of the Westvleteren. Apparently this is impossible to get, but we got two bottles for $60. They are on the way! I will be excited to compare the two. I am sure the Westvleteren tastes better at the monastery, but still. The beer is good, but it’s not great. I would have a hard time rating this anything higher than a 3. Sorry guys, but the beer is just OK. Not worth the hype. It seems to be readily available, too.  I wonder what cheese would go with this beer…",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Went with a very bold pour to release some of gas/carbination into a St B Chalis. Let's rock?  Oh yeah! The head and aroma are all there but break down a little quicker into the magic. The first two step sips are perfection. The slight sweet candy malt, moderate dry fruit and hop just what I was hoping for in depth of flavor. Perfect. The alcohol is warm, compliments but does not over power even on a warm day. Hard to find in such a strong brew.  Had to semi gulp/chug the remainder (come on most of have done it) before it got too warm but then two bottles split among friends solves this dilemma.

Not much lacing, but I have trouble faulting a beer for something so minor. Plus less lacing means less beer on the glass and more in your mouth. S: Cherries and lemongrass the whole way through. Not overpowering, just nice. Could have been a stronger bouquet though. T: Cherries and lemon again leading into a very pure, malty, ""ale"" taste, which I really appreciated. M: Butter.

259,1708,JohnnyHopps,4.25,"Poured from the bottle, the beer was a cloudy dark brown color with tan head. In my case, the bottle became a little over-excited and tried leaving the bottle the moment the cork popped. This did not affect my drinking experience. The nose was familiar to most Belgians. A malty aroma was accompanied by hints of dark fruit. The initial taste was alomst mediciny in the variation on the dark fruits. The degree of carbonation was higher the I would have anticipated for a Quad. The carbonation brushed away some of the notes I was seeking rather quickly. Dark fruits, burned malts, and a hint of chocolate were obvious. In the aftertaste, the beer gave a pleasant warming sensation. This is an easy sipping beer.

A: Pours a murky medium-brown/caramel color, with a thick 1+ finger's worth off-white head on top, with big ""pancake batter""-like bubbles towards the middle of the glass, near where I poured.  S: Yeasty candied sugars and a touch of dates on the nose.  T: Bitter-sweet dark chocolate, figs, and dates, all artfully balanced. The dark chocolate arrives first and probably stands most prominently. There is just a touch of yeasty breadiness near the finish that works nicely within the confines of its role here. Perhaps some of the ""bitterness"" is hops-related? Far from overpowering, I'm not sure if it's related to a roastiness of the barley, a particular fermentable added, or the presence of hops, but it's there, and helps make this a truly ""well balanced"" belgian dark.  M: Initially hefty and bubbly with great carbonation that wisks away nicely.  D/O: A tasty treat. My only complaint in terms of drinkability would be that, as I worked through the glass, a bit of a ""black licorice"" taste started to shine through. I like black licorice, but I just thought it was ""odd"" and didn't quite work here. Still enjoyable, overall, though. Certainly repeatable.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Sweet aroma of malt and dark fruit. Dark fruit, sweet malt and light Belgian spicing. Caramel and malt finish. Excellent body, mouth feel and flavor. A world class quadrupel.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,BuccoFan,4.42,"I poured this into a 10.5 ounce tulip glass.  Pour: Nice amber brown color. Only slight head forms at the top, eventually settling into only a ring around the glass.  Aroma: Caramel malt. Smells delicious.  Mouthfeel--Not much in the way of carbonation, which is good. Not too thick either. I tried the Westmalle tripel last night, and it seemed to have more body (not that the two are necessarily comparable).  Taste: In line with the scent. It's a caramel malt treat. Delicious. Wonder what the best food pairings for this would be.  Overal: I recently had the St. B dubbel, and I think I prefer the dubbed to the quad. Don't get me wrong--this is a beer to savor. But for quads, I might be inclined to reach for the Ommegang 3 Ps before this (again, though, it's a close call).",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,DmanGTR,4.97,"I've had this beer from both bottle and from tap. The 2 styles are identical in all respects in my opinion, except of course, the carbonation can be adjusted accordingly when on tap. Thus, my review for the draught version is identical to that of it from the bottle, except for the mouthfeel category. I will add, too, that I had a slightly overcarbonated pour from tap at a bar once. I talked to the bartender and they dialed the carbonation down a little bit. I tried it again the next day and it was much better and thus, the review came from the better of the two experiences:  Deep plum brown with a nicely retained beige head in a St. Bernardus goblet. Garnet hues barely shine through in the light. Nicely sweet, predominantly caramel, plum, raisins, and a light toffee hint. Perhaps even a touch of burnt sugar in the very farthest reaches of the crevices of your palate. This beer commands respect to all those savoring its greatness. Very, very light hint of hops keeps it from being cloying, yet remaining undetectable by conventional means. It's almost as if the hops are simple leaving a shadow to dance with the malts and fruity flavors. Carbonation is spot on. Sweet and almost chewy body, but still incredibly smooth.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Flavor follows the nose pretty well. Belgian candy sweetness with some fruits noted in the nose. A touch a caramel. Nice flavor.  Mouth is medium bodied with a high amount of carbonation.

Figs, raisins, cherries hit on the very tip of the nose but quickly becomes a strong rum soaked scent. There's a sweet bread character lurking in the background. Very sweet overall and almost wine like. Phenols are blossoming left and right. Extremely complex and heavy on the nose.  The sweet raisin and fig notes carry well on the front of the tongue and they dominate the top of the palate. The a strong sweet bread character on the center of the tongue that starts to blossom in warming alcohol at the end. The sugar shines on the center but doesn't carry to powerfully to not let the bread character shine. I'm impressed by the alcohol lightness.  Very, very carbonated and I think that helps the flavors move better than the would otherwise. Things could be quite strong without the powerful carbonation and it makes sense here.  A wonderful example of the Quad as a style and a new favorite.

259,1708,DougT,5,"Poured slowly into a St. Bernardus Watou snifter. Bottle dated 23 05 17.  Color a dark, root beer brown. Gentle pour resulted in 1 finger tan head with lots of lace. Settled into a light layer of foam that last the whole drinking time. Even a gentle pour I still got some yeast in suspension but it's so dark you really have to look hard to see it.  Smells of yeast and dark fruits. Dark bread, raisins, figs, dates and a little bit of spices. But not an overwhelming smell, very pleasant and constrained. Makes my mouth water and stomach grumble.  Tastes is very complex. Starts with a malty sweet flavor like beer made with raisins or prunes, then moves to notes of spices and figs or dates. Hops are hardly present, but there are some bitter notes in the finish to let you know it's there. Alcohol is hardly noticeable in the taste, even at 10%, but the kick is there even after a few sips. Gets even better as it warms. The flavors start to merry together and become a flavor that defines Belgian Abbey Quad Ale.  Mouthfeel is amazing. This beer involves every sense in your entire head all at the same time. Effervescence tingles the lips and tongue helping hide the alcohol. Flavors dance across the whole tongue. Even the cheeks get involved as they react to what they perceive as food. Smell up front is enhanced by smells that enter from the throat and develop the complexities of the aftertaste. After 1/2 a glass the sensatin is like you are sitting in a vat at the old Abbey. Wholly engaged.  The cheesy Happy Monk label does not do justice to the sophistication of this brew. This beer elevates the art to levels seldom achieved. This stuff is wonderful. Very easily my favorite beer. Worth every penny.  I would love to save some to see what it's like after a few years, but I'll never make it. It's too good to leave on the self! Maybe if I gave some to my son he could hide it at his house for a couple years...  I had 3/4 the glass writing this. I now have a warm glow and a huge smile.

Intense vanilla and fresh fruit with a cidery tang.  T- Fruity sweetness, some brown sugar up front followed by coffee and a mildly tart finish that captures the cider notes in the nose.  M- This has a surprisingly heavy body that borders on syrupy but it is smooth and rich. The carbonation is pervasive but not over powering.  O- Deep, complex flavor.

The appearance of this quad is wild... a medium-thickness white head that, as it dissipates, reveals this strange chocolate-swirl that makes it look like a cappuccino. The brew itself is also very cloudy, looking almost alive as mist glides through the liquid. It has a wonderful apple scent that comes off the top of the brew in a noticeable but not overpowering way. The taste is spot-on, especially as the brew warms up in temperature, really making that 10% ABV present. The only downside to this brew to me was the excess gas and the sometimes harsh aftertaste that accompanies it.

259,1708,deadonhisfeet,4.51,"For my 200th review, I wanted to drink something special that I've had before, but hadn't gotten around to reviewing yet. I picked up two large 750mL corked and caged bottles of this on a recent trek into Ohio. The cork eagerly came out of the bottle with a deafening pop, after which is was poured into a Chimay goblet. The appearance is very dark, clear, reddish brown (like a cola) with a big coarse head that has excellent retention. It never completely left the beer and a lacing of foam remained the entire evening. I expected the nose to be assertive, but it is very faint and delicate. What I can detect is bready and yeasty, like a pastry, with some subtle dark fruit notes (currants?).  This beer drinks like a meal. It truly feels nourishing and sustaining. The flavor is simply off-the-scale. It is full-bodied with a lively mouthfeel from high carbonation. On the front of my tongue I get sweet, bready, yeasty flavors which develop at mid-palate into dark dried fruits like raisins and figs. I also get molasses, brown sugar, cloves, and gingerbread. It has this wonderful sweetness but is never cloying or syrupy or difficult to drink. The only knock I have on it is that the carbonation, while delightful on the tongue, may be a bit too high. I actually thought the beer tasted even better after it had rested a while, degassed, and got a little flat.  This beer has forced me to re-evaluate the need to attend release parties or fight for hard-to-get special releases. Why bother when this stuff is so damn good and so easy to get? It is easily one of the most complex and best-tasting beers I have ever had. I deeply regret buying two big bottles of it.

Not much fruitiness, a good amount of hot alcohol. Some prunes, black cherry and cinnamon. Hops are floral and pine. Some malt flavor.  Mouthfeel: Medium-light body. Lightly astringent. Watery, not oily at all. Little carbonation. Very warming.  Overall: Too much hot alcohol in the aroma and taste. Flavor is ok, not overly sweet which is good, but not enough flavor, a bit bland. Very surprised, perhaps this bottle was tainted?  Notes: Fresh by 6/28/2016, drank on 2/2/2012",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Maintains the spicy aroma but no perceivable alcohol presence. Spicy flavor; brown sugar; like the smell, no real strong alcohol presence. Body seems a bit thinner and airy.  The look really improved this time around. Smell and taste were pretty much the same while the mouthfeel, while full-feeling, just seemed a tad on the lighter side. Still, an impressive ale. ---------------- Appearance: Great ruby red body. Head had funky, huge bubbles...  Smell: Dark fruit, cinnamon, anise and clove, noticeable alcohol scent  Taste: Dates, figs, honey, a hint of caramel; bitterness at the finish is overshadowed with the alcohol presence. Complex yet balanced for the style  Mouthfeel: Thick and chewy, glass smooth with a rich malt sugar characteristic playing throughout  Overall: A very good beer, but could have been better with a decent, rich head (perhaps my 12 ounce bottle was old or my glass dirty, but I'd never seen such large, glass-thin carbonation bubbles - virtually no head at the finish and no lacing or rings on the glass). Otherwise, the taste elements were pretty much spot-on for a quad.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,GeraldFunk,4.89,"Poured from a 330ml bottle into a pint glass.  A- Pours a murky walnut colour with foamy beige head. Head dissipates quickly leaving good lacing.  S- Amazingly complex. Banana flambe, rum, cocoa, alcohol comes through but in balance with sweeter smells. Incredible.  T- Strong banana notes with amazing balance and a pleasantly bitter aftertaste.  M- Good carbonation glides nicely on palate. Not as heavy as I was expecting.  O- An incredible beer overall, as I was expecting from the beer that has almost an identical recipe to Westvleteren 12.  A little tidbit I just learned. St. Bernardus was once a contract brewer for westvleteren and the abt 12 is based heavily on the 12, is it possible that if westvleteren wasn't so hard to get it might rate right around St. Bernardus?

Very kind, inviting aromas. Plums, raisins, toffee, biscuit, caramel, vanilla and sweet candy sugar. A hint of booze.  T- Did I already say the words ""kind and inviting?"" Plums, raisins, a toffee like presence somewhere in there. Complex and beautiful. There is definately a kiss of booze but it all comes together to form a very nice sipper.

Taste many dark fruits. plum, or prune... maybe a fig or two. haha nicely toasted malts. Brown sugar/caramel underlying flavors.  Has an amazingly creamy yet clean finish.

259,1708,acevenom,4.68,"Poured into a chalice. Pours dark brown with a finger length tan head that slowly dissipates. Toffee, raisin, date, fig, and some alcohol are present in the aroma. It's very pleasing. The flavors of bread, toffee, yeast, and dark fruits explode in the mouth on the first sip. The alcohol taste is there, but it's not overpowering. However, the alcohol taste becomes more apparent the warmer it gets. The mouthfeel is full and the carbonation is abundant. Overall, this is a most excellent example of a quad that is relatively easy to find. I recommend this one.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,mjtiernan,4.55,"11.2oz bottle poured into a goblet. Best by 9/27/16.  A: Bottle was a bit of a gusher. One finger pillowy off-white head w/some sediment floating on top. Body is a gorgeous deep ruby red. There was quite a bit of sediment despite the fact that I left a solid 1/4” at the bottom of the bottle. Head was fully lasting and lacing excellent.  S: Bready yeast and dark fruits. Mostly plum, currant and raisin with a little grape and a hint of cherry. Some nice toasted caramel malt.  T: Huge flavor and complexity. Wonderful balance. Starts sweet with earthy yeast and fruit. Lovely breadiness and clove. Some of the caramel malt comes through. Tons of figs, raisins, plums, and the like. Finishes more acidic than the start with a little fusel alcohol.  M: Fizzy carbonation. Medium body. Finishes chalky with a moderate dose of warming alcohol burn. Drinkability is surprisingly high for such a big complex beer.  O: One of the finest quads in existence. Easy to drink but that’s not really the point with a beer like this. Love it.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

As poured the aroma fills the room with a nice variety of dark fruits, roasted malts, molasses, and bread. No hint of higher abv. The flavor builds on the pleasant nose and is a delight. very thick and creamy and rich from the get go but incredibly approachable. The sweetness of the malt is most prominent at first but mellows quickly as a light bitterness enters. The dark fruit gives way to hints of raisins, molasses, figs, and liquorice and is very nice. Finishes creamy and smooth with a lingering sweetness. Full bodied and well carbonated. Overall, this is a treat. I can't wait to purchase more to age and enjoy later. Highly recommended.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

The head that forms is fluffy and tinted ivory. The pinhead sized bubbles dance in the glass and give it a creamy appearance. It's thick and substantial.  The taste is somewhat sweet and very satisfying. A little heavy, but in a good way. You definitely know it's got a kick of high gravity. It's reminiscent of a fine barleywine.  Definitely going on my rotation, but it's a little pricey... you get what you pay for, though.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Duke,4.53,"Appearance: Abt 12 pours a cloudy dark-red raisin colour, complete with a big, fluffy, white head that shrinks quickly and audibly down to a thin cap.  Smell: I smell lots of bread, along with the usual quadrupel dark fruits - in this case the raisins are very distinct - and there's a healthy dose of booze here too.  Taste: Abt 12 tastes quite sweet. I think I got liquorice at the start. The brown sugar is eminent, and the figs are there too. I don't taste the raisins, but at the back I do get a general sense of the slight bitters of dark dried fruits, and the sweet excesses of Grandma's naughty Christmas cake.  Mouthfeel: The beer feels very big and full, and the carbonation is healthy too, drawing from me belches and smiles aplenty as I look forward to bringing the glass back to my appreciating mouth.  Overall: This was the beer that introduced me to quadrupels. I think I have it ranked ever so slightly behind the Rochefort Trappistes 10 and comfortably behind the Westvleteren 12, but that's because those beers are phenomenal. The Trappist quads set a ridiculous standard, and Abt 12 is a brilliant beer.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

S: Yeasty bread along with dark fruits of dates and raisons. Winter spices on the nose, cloves, nutmeg and cinnamon. Alcohol is apparent along with brown sugar - overall it is reminiscent of a fruitcake.  T: Initial taste is of malt, yeasty bread and dark dried fruit - plums and figs and overripe bananas - which is followed by noticeable alcohol. Despite the apparent alcohol, there is no burn but rather a very smooth finish.  M: Medium bodied and above average carbonation which leaves a slight sting on the tongue.  O: This beer is warm and inviting after dinner dessert drink although it would pair well with a hearty meal such as a meat stew. I think this would be best with bread, cheese, nuts and dark dried fruits. It is sweet, malty and complex.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

However, surrounding that is a ruby red-brown liquid that is partially a ""see-through"" experience, but the floating yeasties keep it from being 100% so.  S: Raisons, dates, and figs.... all wrapped up inside a world class Belgian yeast strain. This is all faint, yet effective. Gotta love it!  T: I always get an intense licorice bit on the front of this for some reason. However, after a while, that starts to subside and the dark fruit and fresh filtered water and Belgian funk really kick in!  M: This is one of the creamiest brews in the history of mankind, and the raison and fig notes keep getting better and better, mellower and mellower after every sip.

Not overly aromatic but definitely has a nice pleasant smell that is typical of Belgian Quads.  T- Slightly sweet, a little bit of a slight lemon taste (not too citrusy, just a slight sweet/sour lemon taste), mixed with yeast and malts. Leaves a slightly sweet bready aftertaste.  M- Light to medium bodied, definitely a little bit lighter then I thought it was going to be. Very very smooth and insanely drinkable, does not feel like 10% at all. Very well balanced.  O- This was a great Quad. While the smell and taste didn't blow me away, the mouthfeel is what made this beer fantastic. The beer was incredibly smooth and drinkable. Definitely one of the better Belgian beers that I've had. The beer was very well balanced between the bready yeastiness and slightly lemony/floral sweetness.

Faint aroma of cocoa dust and nuts.  The taste can be described as nothing less than perfect. Full of milk chocolate without being overly sweet. Hazelnuts maybe? Belgian yeast esters definitely there. Mild molasses.  Mouth feel is also amazing. Leaves the palate clean and wanting more. Luscious and velvety. I could drink this all night, until I fall off my stool.  This is my go to beer that I have been drinking for years.

The head has great retention continuing to be over a finger tall for a long time and never completely going away. Significant lacing is observed.  S: The smell is of sweet malts, Belgian yeast, and dark fruits - black cherry, date, plum, and raisin. There are subtle hints of spices and caramel/toffee/molasses.  T: Lots of dark fruits - date, plum, raisin, and black cherry - upfront with the malt body and sweetness. That is followed by the candi sugar and a caramel/toffee flavor. The finish of the beer has some spices/pepper, hints of noble hops, and just the most subtle hint of alcohol heat.  M: Medium bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. Slight dryness in the finish.  O: A wonderful beer with a very nice complexity of flavor and balance. I shouldn't be surprised as I have been impressed with every beer I have had from St. Bernardus.

Aromas are rich and complex, with notes of licorice, molasses, and slight pepper and spicing. The flavors are rich and deep, with a blend of plum, date, and raisin on a crisp, well carbonated body. The alcohol gives a nod here and there, highlighting the palate. Biscuit and bready flavors throughout balance the other characteristics, and the overall malt profile is complex and delicious. At any given time you can get notes of caramel, toffee, molasses, old world fruits, and even some buttery tones. The aftertaste is creamy sweet and rich, almost like cake batter. The finish, remarkably, is kept light by the carbonation, and leaves the palate fairly clean. Great beer.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Easy 3 fingers of cream/khaki colored head. The head looks thick, creamy, and rich. Really thick lacing is left all over the glass with this slowely fading head.  Smell: I gotta say that you dont even need to smell the beer to get notes of belgian yeast, dark fruits and sweet malts! Wow! When you do put your nose into this beer you get a giant malt profile that smells really sweet.  Taste: Lots of dark fruits upfront and a nice malt profile to compliment. I get a lot of figs and mixed with the malt it almost reminds me of a fig newton. Some caramel, toffee, brown sugar and candied sugar. Mid palate you get a really decent spiciness that is mixed with a little boozey burn. The finish has just a little bit of bitterness and more dark fruits. Decent complexity from this beer.  Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation. It got decent drinkability for a beer of this style and one thats 10%. Its just a little bit thin, but not too bad.  Overall: Really solid Quad! I did not think that ABT 12 would stand up to the likes of Westy 12 and Rochefort 10, but it does. This beer is really close to both beers, but its just a little rough around the edges compared to the the other two beers; very minor differences I gotta say. In other words...ABT 12 is an easy to get Westy 12 without all the hype/rarity surrounding it. Just like Rochefort 10, but I like Rochefort 10 just a little bit better.

Leaves a decent amount of lacing.  S: Clove and peppery spice, mild dark fruit aromas not as strong as I anticipated.  The whole aroma is fairly mild, but pleasant.  T: Big dark fruit and candied sugar sweetness.  Lots of clove and white and black peppery spice. More spice than many quads (in a good way).  There is also some caramel malt sweetness, and bread/biscuit flavors at one point.  As it warms more of the dark fruit flavors come out....plum and raisin.  There also is an alcohol presence which works nicely as a balancing agent, rather than being dominant or overwhelming.  This beer starts off strong and only gets better as it warms with more sweetness coming out to balance out the big spice presence.  Really an excellent tasting beer.  M/D:Pretty heavily carbonated but still able to remain relatively smooth, and gets smoother as it warms in the glass. Does a really nice job of keeping the ABV in check and warms the body quite nicely. Very good drinkability for the ABV and massive flavor profile.    O: Overall this is an excellent beer.  Great palate profile and surprising drinkability.  I do think Rochefort 10 is better, but this is great in its own right.

S- Toasty malt in addition to rich Belgian yeast brings about notes of chocolate and banana.  T- A quick flash of wet cardboard that thankfully dies away after multiple sips to reveal the dark fruit characteristics. A bit of a metallic taste as well but not very boozy at all. I feel the alcohol in my gut and head before I feel it on my tongue. Definitely not a quaffer, but it's easy to drink considering the ABV. A little bit of a capsaicin burn comes around after a while which is a bit surprising but welcome. Notes of raisin, banana and pear.  M- A bit prickly but overall smooth. Medium-high carbonation.

A deep ebony appearance, but when held to the light of a candle it becomes translucent and the whole glass glows deep burnished maroon. A gentle carbonation runs through the liquid. The head, when first poured, is half a finger of ivory foam, which quickly settles down to a thin layer.  Aroma is not pronounced, soft and benign - hints of sweet dark fruit and fails to prepare you for your first taste. Complexity, initially hard to pin down what's going on. Its sweet, soft and warm, the alcohol is here but melded with deep malts and a tumble of fruit on the tongue; figs, cherry, lexia raisin, come licorice and spice perhaps.

It is a heavy beer for sure. Pours out like the quadrupel it is, but has a bubbly, frothy white head that one should let dissipate before enjoying.  It is a deep mahogany color and has a tangy, sweet, almost BBQ smell with a strong after scent of the 10% alcohol that resides in the beer.  When drinking, it should be a little warm, and is a heavy, syrupy mouthfeel that is pretty well carbonated for a quad. The taste is a strong, sweetness (almost Cherry-Coke like) with a winey, port sort of after taste. As it warms up it really mellows out into a sweet beer with a malty after taste, and is an adventure in and of itself.

You stick your nose in there and really get a sense of the different aromas. This one in particular is incredible.  Each whiff provides a perfect blend of fruity and spicy notes including bananas, cherries, and plums. The “quad/alcohol” aroma is clearly present but not overpowering. It balances very well with the fruit and rich malt flavors.  The beer is a dark red-maroon like color. For those of us who love dark Belgians, the complexion is flawless. The Abt 12 has a nice big head, which usually settles relatively quickly. Depending on the style of beer, specifically with Belgians, I’ll usually wait for the head to settle; I want get all the good stuff, none of those foam bubbles for me.  The first taste is the amazing. Going back to that whole wine thing, I can’t help but savior every sip. I take my time with it. Not so much that these things aren’t cheap, but mostly because they’re so complex.  Pretty much what you smell is what you get; A lot of dark rich flavors including cherries, raisins, bready caramel notes, and that great unique Belgian yeast flavor, all blending together to make an absolutely incredible beer.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,thekevlarkid,4.64,"Out of a bottle purchased at the Hop Heads bar this beer was a cloudy, dark chestnut color with a towering head of foam. The retention was impressive and the lacing in fine bands with fishnets in between. The aroma was complex and appealing. I detected bready malt, caramel malt, Belgian yeast, dark fruits, some bananas and spices. The flavors were equally complex and yet complimentary. All the same notes from the nose were apparent in the taste with a perfect core of caramel and chocolate malt. Spicy and punchy without being hot, I thought it was an excellent example of balance and finesse. Dried fruits and plums became more pronounced as it warmed up and the hops presence was just enough to counterbalance the malts. The mouthfeel was creamy, the body medium/full and the carbonation perfect. An excellent beer in every way and one of the finest Belgians I’ve had.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,greencovesteve,4.73,"A: slightly hazy reddish brown, plenty of carbonation leaves a thin tan head.  S: ripe fruit abounds, cherries, plums, bananas, spices notes. A sweet wonderful nose to this one.  T: smooth and fruity. The malts balance the sweetness of the fruity tastes nicely. Ends with a slight bitter and a slight reminder of the alcohol content. Still finishes nicely.  M: so velvety smooth with nice dancing bubbles that lead into a great warmer, of the soul and the tummy.  O: When the Quad style is mentioned this is a prime example of what it should be. The balance of this beer is World Class. So many things going on, yet seemingly so simple. This one will one will always have a special place in my heart and my refrigerator.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Smell- notes of dark fruit and caramel malt. Taste- wonderful dark fruit balanced by caramel malt, Belgium yeast, heavy carbonation and some alcohol on the finish but not overpowering for the amount of ABV. mouthfeel- pleasant, lots of carbonation. Overall- the best Belgium strong/quad I have had up until this point. I will defiantly be gravitating back to this again and again.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

S: Wafts of fruity belgian yeast, some bready caramel notes and dark fruit were apparent on the nose... and only grew as the beer warmed.  T: Very strong, sweet malt - caramel and molasses, yeasty bread and dark fruit notes of fig and raisin. Spicy alcohol is apparent throughout, but doesn't overwhelm.  F: Smooth, medium body... carbonation present and can be felt on the back of the throat - but blends with fuller body better than many other belgians I've had.

The body and mouthfeel are superb and at no time does the beer feel heavy, nor does the 10% abv over-rule the experience. I would buy this again in a heartbeat. I think this is also best shared, so that you can discuss all of the different flavor nuances with the person(s) you're enjoying this with.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

I get dark sweet fruits like raisins and figs then that great yeasty smell that comes with all quads, followed up with a slight presences of alcohol. The taste is great that raisin/fig taste with a some addition sweetness from caramel flavor then that discernible Belgium yeast flavor. When compared to other quads this one does have a noticeable alcohol bite that the others do not have. The mouthfeel is medium, but it is too carbonated for my taste. Overall this is a good beer but when compared to other Quads it places in the top 5 but near the bottom.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,McD0uche,4.23,"Poured from bottle into a tulip glass:  A: Now, I'm not sure if I poured this wrong, but the head billows to 3 fingers thick--and the thing stays there for a good couple minutes. The beer itself is a dark velvety brown. As the head recedes, it's apparent how sticky this beer is. The lacing is pronounced.  S: Silty, earthy malts and fruits, including pears, apples, maybe some banana. The medley smells awesome and invites me in.  T: A fruity plum, sweet licorice flavor. Yum. It melts in my mouth, and has a nice boozy aftertaste. Overall really delicious.  M: Dry, crispy, and warming. I guess the ""melts in my mouth"" comment should go here.  O: I'm not a big fan of Belgians overall, and hadn't really had a Quad I could say I liked. This stuff has completely shaken my perspective, in a very good way.

259,1708,legalpete19340,4.5,"A: Poured dark cloudy brown with a huge sticky head. Nothing escaped this as it stuck to everything and laced like a champ.  S: Exactly like slightly overcooked raisin bread. Dark dried fruit jumps out with raisin and prune. The sweet bread is close behind with a slight burnt note.  T: Exactly as the nose advertises: big spicy sweetbread with a burnt characteristic slides into the raisin and prune flavors. The malt really holds up and keeps the sweetness and spice back but its all there in high quantities. The end is alcohol and it warms until the next sip.  M: Pretty much medium with a heavy quality. Very creamy and smooth.  O: Fantastic. For me this is the right balance of bready malt and fruit sweetness. Its a monster to drink though and the ABV is noticeable, but it was hard to stop.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,djbow,4.82,"A: Dark hazy brown like strong sweet tea. Quickly forming head of tight tan that form a rich two finger head. After the head dissipates beautiful lacing and alcohol legs take the stage.  S: Ripe dark fruit, dates, rasins, cherries and rich honey / malt sweetness balanced by a slight aroma of alcohol.  T: Just like its smell suggests, ripe dark fruit, dates, rasins, cherries and rich honey / malt sweetness balanced balanced a very slight alcohol taste. This beer tast is quite complex and I think if I try it agan (and I will) there will be more flavors that become apparent. Like most beers of this style, as it warms the taste becomes more pronounced.  M: Crisp, Champagne like feel that cleanses the pallet with each swallow. This is accomplished by the medium-high carbonation combined with a silky soft medium - heavy body.  O: This is truly a World-Class Belgian Quad. There are other more expensive and lauded Belgian Quads, but in my opinion St. Bernardus Abt 12 is on a nearly equal plane. Also, St. Bernardus is affordable and readily available. Finally, is important to not that this beer gets better with age and can be aged up to four years before consumption. Strap in, try this beer and get ready for a wonderful taste journey.

259,1708,JohnnyMc,5,"My all-time favorite Quad!! This was a 2012 bottle.  Pours out a dark mahogany, with deep amber highlights and a big, slight khaki head.  The aroma is full of dark fruit, some banana and clove, caramel, toffee and molasses, followed by some bready malt notes. The spice this has when fresh has definitely faded a bit.  The taste has tons of dark fruit; plums, figs, raisins, dates and there are notes of banana and clove, some caramel, toffee and molasses all finished by a nice yeasty/bready finish. It's pretty dry and there is some bitterness to balance it all out.  The 10% isn't noticeable on the taste or aroma, but you can feel it slightly. The body is full and the mouthfeel is slightly creamy with a crisp, kinda dry finish.  This beer is awesome fresh or with a year on it! I don't believe this is the perfect or best beer in the world (or that there is such one), but it embodies the Quad style perfectly! It's very easy to drink, complex and balance and I don't think there is anything that could improve this.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

A real tale of two beers here.  Smell. Very sweet with lots of dark fruit and sweet caramel and sugary smells.  Taste. Starts out with a quick hit of slightly bitter grape and dark fruit flavor. This is very quickly taken over by a very intense sweetness that is reminiscent of hard candy with a hint of rum soaked raisins. Some spice is introduced along with a much drier character, yet still some lingering sweetness. The finish is semi-dry with the lingering flavor of rum soaked raisins.  Mouthfeel. Perfect amount of carbonation with a moderate to thin body.  One of my favorite quads so far. This is one of the few beers that I have had more on tap, in fact this is the first time I had it out of the bottle.

S: Rich but balanced smell, Almost difficult to describe.. Raisins, Plums, A ever so slight aroma of alcohol.  T: For me.. Luxurious.. A light/medium carbonation hides this beers 10+% alcohol content EXTREMELY well. Sweet burnt caramel, Raisins, a taste of Honey come to my mind quickly, but this beer is much more complex to the taste then I can describe. I am writing this review on the last of 3 equal pours from this bottle. Taste has become extremely more pronounced as this beer has warmed to proper serving temperature.  M: Personally a little less intruding to the palate compared to a Rochefort 10. Also deceivingly a little lighter also most likely due to a bit more carbonation. best thing I can use to describe it is ... Silk  O: my favorite Belgian Quad. Working at a beverage center that distributes over 1200 beers, Including over 175 Belgian selections. The discount I receive from this job allows this to be my ""GO TO"" beer. I can not get over it.

A: Beautiful, intense and clarified dark brown. Profanely creamy with a tan head that sits atop this beer like a mystical pillowy crown. Nothing short of a 5/5 for this. Head retention is top tier, along with the latticework type lacing. Wow, how did they get this kind of retention on a 10 abv...  S: Ripe banana, malt, and granny smith apple. Floral notes. Slight alcohol phenol. The aroma doesnt jump out all at once, but needs to be coaxed.  T: First notes are of pears, Belgian spices (nutmeg, coriander and orange zest) and banana bread. Secondary profile is a very complex malt blend, mixed with a smidgen of hop bitterness. It also has tertiary flavors of canna lilly flower and a huge hit of creamy maltodextrin towards the end of the beer. Non dry finish with returning notes of banana, pear, plum, belgian spices, and cherry. This taste profile is so complex, I was worried I wouldnt be able to pick out each flavor. Im sure there are some that I am missing.  M: Medium to heavy body, with light carbonation. More sweet than bitter and very creamy. Slight alcohol warmth.  O: This is THE beer, top of the spectrum. The alpha. I have had nothing better to date. This is on par with the rochefort 10, probably a little more complex. If you can find this, absolutely buy it and buy some more and ship them to me.  Note: This beer is far too good to be alone. I paired this with a roasted garlic hummus, pretzels and gouda cheese.

Very pleasant aroma - not overpowering. Just smells delicious.  T: Bittersweet dates, burnt malty figs. There's a burnt toasty richness that bakes all the flavors together perfectly. Just when you think it is going to turn sour, the flavors pull back into that fresh toasty warmness. Quite delicious.  M: Nice and bubbly, but not overdone. It strikes a rare balance there.

T-- The alcohol is very well hidden in this delightful beauty, it barely seeps through between the fig, apricot, plum, apple, maple, malt, bread and yeast as the finishing touch. Complex and keeps me guessing until I take another sip.  M-- First the distinct carbonation hits like high quality champagne; the tiny bubbles tickle the tongue and kiss the palate. Then it settles into a smooth, rich and soft flowy creaminess , almost too much-but wait, no it's just right.  O-- Amazing beer, worthy of being within the world class selection.

Appearance- The foam is puffy, airy and reaches an impressive three fingers of an ecru hue.The body is an opaque molasses with some caramel highlights.  Smell- Wow, where to start the dissection of this complex beer. Okay, lets start with the currants and general dark fruitiness. There is also some sweet honey in play that butts up with some raisin.  It gets a little edgy with the bready malts and alcohol.  Taste- I appreciate that the sweetness is one of the first things to come across the palate. The honey and raisin then starts to get some bready malt and figs working with it.  The finish has some booziness and earthy yeast. What a great and spicy drink.  Mouth feel- The beer is a little rough from that booziness, but it is also creamy and a very solid medium body. It could be creamier, feels a little fizzy on the tongue.  Overall- There are great, complex flavors in this beer that get greater and greater with every sip. I also enjoyed how the nose was able to be just as complex as what I experienced on the palate.

Plenty of the belgian yeast banana scent as well, strong. Malts are hard to pick up but get distinct butterscotch tone.  T: Taste doesn't disappoint. Immediately, as in the aroma, I get tons of sweet fig preserves. Some richer raisin or prune in their too, very fruity. Somehow doesn't become overly sweet, but it's on the edge. Bananas hit as well, but muted. Some dark cherry comes into play, a bit more tart then the other flavors.  M: Thick, velvety, chewy beer through and through. Maybe not surprising for a Belgian, but somewhat higher carbonation then expected.  O: I admit to not being a fan of Belgian styles, particularly Quads, but I really enjoyed this.

Head is massive, 3 fingers, with nice staying power. Head color is a very light tan. Lacing is plentiful. This about nails it in the appearance category.  Smell: Raisins, plum, caramel, alcohol, sugar. A lot going on in here, and smells very nice.  Taste: Plum, alcohol, caramel, and figs intertwine with Belgian yeast esters to tingle the palate. Strong banana flavors in the after taste. As the beer was colder I got a hint of oxidization, which lead me to think there might be a bit of age. As the beer warms that seems to have diminished, so perhaps this is still pretty young but not totally fresh - a year maybe?  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, but quite thin for the style, and highly carbed.  Drinkability: Slow, low to moderate.

I'm at home in malt country. Surprisingly light. I was expecting heavy and thick and dense flavor. The booze taste that normally distracts me in high ABVs works instead here as part of the harmonious flavor balance. Ingenious!  Aftertaste: It winds up pretty dry on the tongue afterwards, with not a lot sticking around except a faint memory of perfect buttered toast. A bit of top tongue sting. Nice fumes and warmth in the back of the throat to exhale. Very pleasant burps.  Overall: Very good. Balance, quality, harmony. There's an unassuming humility though too.

A deep and dark brown with a touch of red, lightening slightly at th edges of the glass. A tan finger of head settles quickly to a tin film. Minimal lacing. Raisin and plum and banana on the nose, brown sugar and a little oak rounding it out. A really fantastic aroma.  Tastes of sweet, caramel malt and a lot of dark fruits; raisin, plum, and fig are all there, with some banana for kicks. Balances with a slightly earthy, slightly spicy bitterness. Very smooth with a pleasently prickly carbonation. A nice alcohol warmth is felt all the way down. Finishes sweet and lingering.

A: Bright mahogany. Single (light tan) fingernail head on Jeffo's pour - I was playing along.  S: All-spice, oak, cinnamon, dark fruit. More spice. Hint of brown sugar, vanilla, and cloves. Smells nice!  T: Deep, dark figs with subtle hint of spice, honey, and vanilla. Well-balanced and nicely done here.  M: Full bodied with smooth carbonation (for the style).

The head is off-white, and rises up to about two fingers. The head drops quickly and has very little lacing. The color is deep, deep copper brown. Really beautiful.  S- Holy complexity batman! Super deep aroma. Caramel, brown sugar, dark raisins, cinnamon, some oak and booze. Wonderful warm aroma. Really good.  T- Solid. Really solid. Many of the same flavors as the aroma, with an extra level of complexity. Dark raisin, brown sugar, sweet caramel, and awesome oaky notes. Maybe even a little chocolate in there as well? There is also a spicy yeast taste with some clove and a warming boozey sensation at the end.  M- Pretty solid. Really aggressive carbonation. Maybe a bit too much carbonation, but it doesn't really detract too much from the overall experience.  O- Awesome beer. Really phenomenal. I think i still actually like Chimay Blue a tad bit more . . . or maybe not. It is really close. Anyway, this is an awesome beer. Definitely world class.

Mouthfeel is superior, lots of carbonation; extremely smooth and creamy; perfect. Alcohol is noticeable, but it's not boozy. Pretty easy to drink.

259,1708,BMoldy,4.29,"33 cl. bottle best before 08/06/16. Served in St. Bernardus chalice.  A: A relatively slow pour yields a dark brown brew that's just a few shades shy of opaque. A stable, 1"" chestnut head takes a few minutes to settle and leaves a brush of sparse lacing. Nothing remarkable in my opinion.  S: Damn. Banana phenols sit on top of layers of dark sweet malts and mix with a blend of further fruit and spices. Apples, various stone fruit (namely cherries and plums), and even something more exotic. Melon maybe? Spices are relatively classic: cinnamon, nutmeg and maybe a hint of black pepper. The malt is mainly sweet caramel, but chocolate is also present. Super complex overall and certainly outstanding for the style.  T/M: Blend of syrupy malt and dark fruit is tempered by a surprisingly present bitterness and fine yet active carbonation. Not as impressive as the aroma would suggest. The body is smooth and solid, and the mouthfeel is surprisingly light for the alcohol, the latter being very minimal is both feel and taste. The flavors correspond pretty well to the aroma, except that the fruits are more classic (cherry, plum) and there is almost no spice presence. Finishes long, fruity and sweet.  O: I like this beer, don't get me wrong, but I'll take a Rochefort 10 any day. Sure the aroma on this one is better, but the Rochefort packs more of a punch in terms of flavor. The body feels maybe a little too weak on this one, which is kind of funny since the Rochefort is a bit too heavy for me. Maybe that's what makes Westvleteren is so good. Still worth seeking out though.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,blakelive784,3.95,"1 pt 9.4 fl oz bottle served in a snifter, reviewed live:  A - Pours a murky brown/copper color with a decently creamy, light tan 3 finger head. Retention is amazing considering the abv.  S - Awesome spicy yeast, pepper, banana, floral notes, clove, caramel, toast, candied sugar, and sweet malt. Moderate strength, and incredibly appealing.  T - Complex spice notes abound- pepper and clove namely. Sweet malt foundation and candied sugar work nicely against biscuity yeast. The yeast is present. The flavors are complex, but a bit too subtle. I wish they were a bit more bold.  M - Medium bodied, smooth and wet. Generally suited to the flavors but could use more body.  D - I'd have it again, though I've had better quads. It hides it's abv well, but I think it's a bit reserved.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,wiscokid920,4.93,"Pours a luscious three finger head that lingers forever. Despite sipping on this beer for nearly an hour it still retains a thin cap and the lacing rides down the glass with every sip.  Nose features lots of dark fruits, figs and plums, whose candied qualities play well with the sweet caramel malts and Belgian esters.  The flavor profile follows the nose nicely, yet adds greater complexity. Candied dark fruits join in on the sweet notes of the caramel malts. The sweetness is subdued with a nice dark bread character which gives way to an earthy tobacco, and finishes with subtle alcohol heat.  The mouthfeel is really what makes this a word class beer in my opinion. The first few sips offer a fantastic full bodied chewy experience. As the beer opens up the carbonation really makes itself known. What was once full bodied, chewy, and rich becomes light and fluffy. The experience ends with both a nice dryness and a warming alcohol presence which begs for another sip.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,jazzyjeff13,4.05,"A 330ml bottle with a BB of Oct 2015. Purchased from the York Beer & Wine shop.  Poured into a Duvel chalice. A dark amber-brown hue with hazy yeast sediment and strong carbonation. Produces a massive head of frothy light-brown foam that remains for a few minutes before reducing to a surface layer. A rich, fruity aroma with notes of brown sugar, banana, figs, prunes, yeast esters, hints of spice and a big whiff of alcohol. Possesses a dry, vinous complexity.  The taste has a sweetish, fruity character with a dry, boozy finish. Notes of bananas, brown sugar, figs, dried fruit, cake, yeast and spice. A warming hit of alcohol upon swallowing. Mouthfeel is silky smooth and tingly, with considerable astrigency. The body is perfect - neither too thick nor too thin. Aftertaste of fruity yeast.  Impressive - rich and tasty. A smooth and complex quad that deserves the acclaim heaped upon it. Swirling it around the mouth is a pleasure. Not one I'd want to imbibe every day, but a must try for any beer lover.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Smell - Sweet candies and floral scents prevail  Taste - Superb beer. Strawness and earthy notes to start like many Belgian beers. Sweet/sour notes with a crisp hop presence in finish with a tad of booziness to note. Very complex beer on the pallet.  Moutfeel - Perfect.  Overall - This is one of the best. Nothing else really needs to be said. Split a 750ml with a friend and enjoy the best life has to offer!!,Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

The date is 3/29/16, making this baby 10 months old--fairly fresh for a quad, I do believe.  A: Very dark ruby red, that appears brown unless held to the light. A beautiful two finger head sits atop the beer and gradually fades as the beer is consumed.  S: This smells like a slightly grainy, red wine. Very ripe, red fruits, with notes of clove strongly present. Rich, sweet malts, and alcohol definitely noticeable in the back.  T: Largely follows the nose-really nice example of the Belgian style. Spicy/clove notes upfront, before waves of rich fruits roll over the tongue. Big pear and grape flavors, specifically. Mild fig notes. The yeast is noticeable, but not overwhelming as I was slightly concerned about.  M: Smooth and creamy with a good-albeit slightly high-amount of carbonation.  O: Great quad.

T: Dark fruits including figs, red grapes and cherries along with pears up front. Some alcohol esters and candy taste in the finish.  M: Medium viscosity and a high level of fine carbonation.  O: I have had this before on tap, and have to say that it is much better from the 750 mL bottle. But, I have a feeling that it was sitting on the store shelf aging for a while.  It is so much better in the bottle that I fully intend on deleting my previous review as having it on tap does not do it justice.

As a staple Quad, I was very anxious to give this brew a try and it definitely didn't disappoint!  A: This brew pouted a deep cloudy brown with a thin, yet resilient cream colored head that gave excellent lacing as I progressed through.  S: Very complex aroma with great hints of dark, caramelized fruits with a malty sweetness, a hint of flowery hops and very rich chocolatety/caramel scents to finish.  T: Very complex flavors that follow its aroma. Starts with a nice chocolate/caramel/coffee flavor adding a nice richness followed by the nice sweeter rich dark fruit flavors with some lingering flowery hops and finishing with a very nice alcohol heat that somewhat cleanses the palate for the next sip!  M: Very nice mouthfeel with a great syrupy richness that coats extremely well with amazing carbonation, as expected, that perfectly balance with the flavors.  I will definitely be drinking this much more in the future!

259,1708,TheBrewo,4.27,"This was served from the bottle at The Old Toad in Rochester, NY. Poured into a St. Bernardus goblet, it shown a rich chocolate brown color. It held a whitish two finger head of thick, chunk bubbles that receded at a medium pace. This left little lacing. Carbonation appeared medium, and thick, chunky yeast floated about the drink. The beer was served at cellar temperatures. The aroma was bright with fruity sweetness, from fig and strawberry. This was souring and tart, but nice and strong. There was an additional sweetness from honey and fermented apples. The malts were strong and quintessentially Belgian, with caramel and toasty darkness. The yeast was also strong in the nose, with lighter banana esters. Phenols were also present, in the form of vanilla, cinnamon, and clove. As we sipped, cherry fruit sweetness sitting amongst evenly sweet caramel malts presents up front. The malts quickly took center stage, and a huge wet grain pulled us into the middle. The middle peaked with sweeter and lighter malts, steely and clean yeast, and a complex depth of sugars, afforded by those fermented fruits from the nose. The end was light, but robust in flavor, with strong banana esters and more mixing fruit from the beginning. The aftertaste breathed of huge fusel alcohols, clove, citric rind (not of hops), and a thick yeast. This was all contained within a nest of old strawberries and clean caramel malts. The body was medium to full and the carbonation was high. The booze dried the mouth slightly, but otherwise the mouth had bi slurp and gulp, and a nice finish dry smack. The beer was quite warming thanks to the abv, and it drinks as a sipper.  Overall, what the enjoyed most about this brew was the taste. The fruity and estery inclusion helped maintain a lightness of flavoring. This also helped calm the huge malt framework of the beer. The complexity was there, and everything was expertly blended together, working in harmony. The aroma and feel also delivered as expected, in a very Belgian way. This beer is damn near perfect for a cold winter day.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,DrDocRudge,4.65,"Enjoyed this on tap at a beer bar in West Palm Beach. Served in a tulip glass, the dark nectar had a beautiful tan head. Definitely fruity but somehow butterscotch and vanilla notes arrived about mid-glass. Has very smoooth and long finish. Huge sheets of belgian lace clung to the glass.

259,1708,Brew33,3.03,"Corked and Caged 750ml bottle.  I've had this beer multiple times and I've always thought it was a below average Quad. I received this bottle as a gift for Xmas.  The cork was under extreme pressure so I could tell right away this beer was going to be over carbonated and I was right. It pours a towering, tan-tinged, 4 inch head into my Duvel tulip. After letting the foam settle a little I take a huge whiff expecting that figgy, spicy, malty delight that this style is known for but instead I get very little aroma. You can actually smell the Co2 from the bottle. Very weak aroma. After you let this beer breath for 30 minutes the flavor is okay. Dark malts, slightly metallic flavors, rather dry for the style. Not much in the way of residual sugars. Yeasty to be sure. Slightly phenolic and spicy at the end.  For a 10% Belgian Quad this beer is VERY thin. Highly attenuated, no heft on the tongue. The bordering on ridiculous level of carbonation really damages this beer. It mutes the aroma and destroys the mouthfeel. Not in the same class as Westy 12 or Rochefort 10.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

S- Immediately fills the nose with dark fruit aromas and hints of vanilla. Ever so subtle alcoholic burn.  T- Rich with the sweetness of dark fruits: dates, figs, raisins. Again with the undertones of vanilla... this tastes like it smells, no surprises. Very smooth. Warming, rather than boozy.  M- Very full-bodied. Rich and smooth as I said before. Makes your mouth water.  O- A fantastic beer all around and one of the best of this style. It's possible its availability downplays the comparative quality. Can't wait to side-by-side this with a Westy come April.  Cheers!",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Hopdaemon39,4.64,On tap at Cleveland's Bier Markt- served in a 12 oz tulip with a small head. Appears to be a dark amber color (sorry dim lighting in the bar makes it difficult to determine). Has minimal head retention and no lacing. Smells mostly of yeast but has some hints of nutty malts. The taste is medium bodied with the same nuttiness and yeastiness as the smell. It is well carbonated and not syrupy at all. It tastes different on draft than in the bottle but of course still very enjoyable and drinkable.,Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

The smell was fantastic.  T - A few sweet, fruity flavor. It finished very smooth - all the aromas that came out in the smell were captured in the taste. It all blended together quite well.  M - Light body, medium carbonation.  O - Fantastic Quad - the alcohol was masked very well through all the fruit flavors that came out.

I get a bit of sediment when I hold the glass to the light. 3.5  S-Very complex. Not sure exactly what we have here. Lots of spice, figs, raisins, red wine perhaps? Some cinnamon, vanilla and caramel sweetness plays nicely as well. 4.0  T-Wow. This beer is for sure a first for me, as I would have remembered. No detectable booze, LOTS of dark fruit flavors come through. Candy sugar, vanilla, and Belgian yeast. All of these mingle with a nice, creamy sweetness. This is a damn good beer. 4.5  M-Medium bodied with the perfect amount of carbonation. Every sip was a treat and the sweetness was never too much. Just about perfect. 4.5  O- I am not too familiar with Belgian styles such as quads, tripels and dubbels. I am assuming this is one of the previously stated. I am guessing a quad, as it is SO complex and delicious. Whatever it is, I want more. 4.5  The reveal- St. Bernardus Abt 12.  I have seen this beer around, and never pulled the trigger. Thank you for this, and it is going to become a part of my regular rotation. I have had a Westy 12 in the past, and as previously stated, this style is not one I have a lot of experience with.

S - My god no Alcohol smell and a great medially of plum, raisin,figs, and Belgium sugars. Smells great even after it warms.  T - All the flavors pretty much mesh perfectly to deliver a punch of dark fruits. Brewed so well this beer has no alcohol flavors to speak of and a semi sweet finish with sugars. Lovely.

A - Pours just like the Westvleteren - murky dark ruby swamp water with a stubborn island of foam that sticks around the middle of the head, just like the Westy.  S - Smells fantastic. Dark fruit, toasted grains, some kind of sweet syrup. Smells fresher than the Westy even though it predates it by a bit.  T - All the points of the smell carry through in the taste. Wonderful. Great quad without that lingering tobacco that I found in the Westy.  M - Perfect. Not syrupy or oily - medium body, medium to low carbonation, really fitting for the flavors it carries.  O - This really is on par with Westvleteren 12, and seemingly much more consistent (and cheaper).

I sampled it along with some of my other perennial favorites including Maredsous 10, Aventinus, Delirium, and Chimay Tripel.

Pours brown/dark-copper with thick head that fades very quickly.  Smells sweet with a hint of cinnamon and spices and yeasty, slightly boozy but overall strong of spices and yeast.  Flavor is complex but not overwhelming. Again kind of a spiced sweetness that has a hint of nutmeg and is a bit boozy, however this was a fairly fresh bottle and could definitely age for a bit.

This bottle has a best-by date of 2013; not sure exactly how old that makes it at the time of reviewing. The color is an orange-tinged brown; pretty much opaque, with a smallish head that falls to a thin band quickly; lacing is strong.  Complex aroma is fruity, with lots of raisins, prunes, and figs, followed by a heavy dose of spice. Cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice; has more than a little fruitcake. Boozy rum-drenched candied fruit. Caramel, toffee, yeastiness.  The flavor is also quite layered; with moderate but not excessive sweetness, the combination of fruits, mostly figs and a bit of raisin, a warming alcohol note, spices, and yeast. Less dark and intense than say, Rochefort 10. Nice dose of caramel and bread, faintly peppery flavor as well. Maybe a touch of puckering tannic wood that’s a little wine-like. Everything intensifies as the beer sits and warms.  Nice mouthfeel, lightly creamy, medium bodied, good lively carbonation. Long lingering finish that reinforces the earlier wine aspect of this beer. Truly excellent, a bit lighter in body and overall feel and flavor than many other quads. Elegant and well constructed.

Taste is very much like the smell, spices, toffee, fruit, roasted nuts and molasses bread. Nice alcohol presence make for a well rounded complex flavor.  Good carbonation give it a light feel, but has the hint of alcohol and thickness of the sugars to make it a very nice feel.

Lots of dark blegian candied fruit and as well as some dates and figs.  Surprisingly carbonated. Big full chewy body. Flavors are subdued and blended unlike Americanized quads I've had where the flavors are too massive and all over the place. Slight candy like sweetness with a mild hop presence for balance.  Very well held together. Super smooth as well. Some belgian dark fruit and banana bread presence can be found along with dates and figs but nothing too overpowering like (again) American quads.  quite the drinker.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

259,1708,zoso493,4.58,"Poured from an 11.2 oz bottle into an unmarked snifter.  Appearance: St. Bernardus Abt 12 pours just about as well as any quadrupel around. The beer itself is an immensely murky copper-orange that lets only a minimal amount of light through. The beer is crowned by a massive ecru head that is composed of millions of tiny carbonation bubbles. This was to be expected, however, as the cap practically exploded off the bottle upon opening.  Smell: As far as big-time Belgian strong dark ales are concerned, this one tends to shy away from the big, bold ""dark"" smells that predominate the style. The nose, however, is still superb. There is a beautiful scent of yeast and esters right away, which gives way to an undercurrent of candied orchard fruit. There are only traces of the darker malts which might be expected, yet this is still a great nose.  Taste: This is a very complex beer to be sure. The trademark yeast and esters are very much present, while the light malts play a big role in the background. I was expecting some of the bigger, darker malts, but they are few and far between in this in this brew. Still, the light malts and yeast are extremely enjoyable.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel in this brew is decidedly luxurious. The beer is extremely smooth, and being highly carbonated, it doesn't leave any stickiness on the palate. It could, though, be slightly thicker, as a quadrupel does call for a slightly heavier body.  Overall, St. Bernardus Abt 12 is a very, very good beer, and one which deserves to be mentioned among the very best Belgian quadrupels. It is slightly atypical for the style, but when a beer is this good, it tends not to matter.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

259,1708,Agent1,4.97,"This may be the first beer to intimate me before conducting a well-deserved review. St. Bernardus: One of only seven remaining Trappist Monasteries in the world still preparing beer to this day. Made by hand, by monks in Belgium. Wow. What else could you possibly ask for...  **NOTE: It is very important to enjoy this beer closer to room temperature. I believe this beer has not scored as high as it should, given that most people may be drinking it too cold. Like other quality Belgian ales, try serving anywhere between 12-16°C.  Appearance - This a highly compressed quad. Fantastic ivory head. Extremely creamy in appearance. The body is rather dark and far from opaque. A very deep brown, almost black, cradled in my official Watou glass.  Smell - Heavily malted. Lots of dark berries, fig, bread, biscuit, raisin, with faint, clean aromas of yeast. Very strong sugars coming through.  Taste - Insanely complex. Even more insane is how hidden the 10% abv is. This is not easy to do and somehow these talented Trappist monks have managed to disguise the alcohol exceptionally well. There are so many ingredients to this quad that it is staggering. Bread, fig, dark cherries, plum, light herbs and spices, prunes, dates, etc. Plenty of dark fruits. Lightly dry hopped. A very, very faint 'smokey' aftertaste (perhaps induced by the hops). Also, flavors of biscuit are noticeable.  Mouthfeel - Spreading across the tongue, this quad does the work for you. It immediately surpasses most beers in the way it disperses within the mouth and stimulates almost every area. Again, very balanced.  Overall - Phenomenal. As a quad, it arguably does not get any better than this. With so many taste notes and so many hidden subtleties, it is hard not to think so highly of this Monastic beer. Remarkably balanced with both sweet and dry flavors, it is virtually perfect in every way possible. I have enjoyed this beer countless times in the past and it always manages to leave me breathless.

Appears to have low carbonation. Light lacing.  Aroma is deep and complex. Very malt forward and full of belgian yeast qualities. Reeks of sweet dark fruits, including raisins and figs.  Very complex and intricate flavor that matches the aroma quite well. Dark, sweet, malt really dominate the flavor, but really nicely rounded out by the belgian yeast qualities. Had a nice dose of dark fruits, spiciness, and warming alcohol (tad bit of rum flavoring). A little bit of a molasses, brown sugar-esque quality as well.  Perfect mouthfeel. Nice fuller body and just enough carbonation. Perfect balance of drinkability and alcohol, making it a nice sipper.  Great quad. Will have to revisit some of the other big names to see how it compares. Great balance and complexity.

Caramel malt with some biscuit notes. Every sip has a few different flavors I didn't notice before. Let this one sit out for a little while to experience all the flavors.

The aroma is candy sweet with a mild soapiness. There are light hints of dried fruits and a faint smell of booze. The flavor of the beer is sweet and spice through and through. Raisins, molasses, caramel, figs, and spice are all there intertwined beautifully. There is just a hint of bitter and the aftertaste is a lingering spice and warmth that seems great for cold weather. The MF is smooth, slick, and slightly watery. The carbonation seems to be a tad high and the alcohol leaves warmth in both mouth and throat. This is a damn near flawless beer in my opinion. This is a perfect blend of flavor and alcohol. The flavors are rich and decadent and all wonderfully in check. This is one of my favorites and I always enjoy it.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,TheHammer,3.55,"Appearance: Wholly crap, the head it out of control. A fairly gentle pour produced three fingers of head that both laced and sustained incredibly. The body is an opaque dark chestnut brown with little bits of sediment floating in it.  Smell: Has a fruity molasses and nutty character to it. Blackberry, currant and grapes with notes of hazelnuts and almonds. The sweet molasses however is really the dominant force here and warming, like most belgian beers, improves it considerably.  Taste: Pretty much like it smells, it starts with a caramel malt that is somewhat obscured by the creamy carbonation as the sweet molasses and nut taste hits a bit quickly a light citrus hopping takes over leaving a mixed berry aftertaste that brings some redemption, but also struggles with a high alcohol twang.  Mouthfeel: There is too much creamy carbonation going on here, it's actually somewhat hampering the beer flavour, even if it is making it very smooth. Add that to a sticky kind of sensation when you hit the molasses note and transitioning that could be a lot better, I can't say I'm impressed. However, the nice aftertaste lets it make up some ground.  Drinkability: Medium bodied so I wouldn't want more then one, but that one does go down well enough. The high carbonation seems to dissipate by the time it hits the sack. A bit too much high alcohol taste for my pleasure though.  Final Thoughts: I think I'm getting tired of belgian beers, and they don't see to quite be for me. Each time I have them, they come across as high class, but snooty and disconnected. I mean, the higher end ones seem to get it done right, but most of the others come across as close but no cigar and frankly almost like they are trying to cheaply imitate other beers. I know that's not the case, but that's just how I feel about them. Anyways, this is one fares better then most, so I'd say give it a shot.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Converge,4.09,"330ml bottle poured into a 16oz goblet. The bottle foamed madly as I tried to open it.  A - Little over a finger of head; bubbly, frothy, and tan. Murky garnet-brown hue. The head thins out and leaves bits of lacing around the glass.  S - Aroma is ripe and sweet upfront. Nice, ripe plums, bananas, green apples. Not as much dark fruit as expected. Obligatory Belgian candi sugar creates a strong sweetness in the scent as well. A little fig with fresh bread and yeast in the finish.  T - The fruit flavors are quite subdued initially. Sort of a medicinal mixture of candi sugar and alcohol. The yeast is done fairly well, not too much and not too little. I'm sitting here sort of perplexed at the lack of complexity in beer. The typical flavors are all present for the most part, but I guess it hasn't really delivered the punch I expected from such a renowned beer. The flavor never really culminates to form anything too impressive, allowing the alcohol to take center stage in the flavor profile. Spices in the finish don't do anything to subdue the warm alcohol flavor already present.  M - Smooth, bubbly carbonation. Medium bodied feel with a pretty sticky feel on my lips. Sort of slick/oily.  D - Still a solid quad, but at 10% ABV this beer just doesn't offer enough in the flavor department. Despite all these complaints, this beer was still very good and in fact really easy to drink.

Head dissipates after a few minutes leaving some slight lacing to a thick collar of bubbles and an even film across the surface. Plenty of carbonation streaming up from the bottom of the glass.  Nose is as I remember it, dried dark fruits, prunes, dark cherry, dates, clove, brown sugar, and dark bread malt. A touch of alcohol still on the nose, rum like in the sweetness.  Taste follows the nose, dark fruits upfront, rum soaked prunes and dates especially, though there is still a bit of dark sweet cherry flavor. Some spiciness shows up mid palate, cloves, light anise, with light brown sugar and baked dark bread. Finish is medium, clean, but some light dark fruits and spice at the back of the tongue. Smooth and balanced, with no alcohol heat at all. However, age seems to take some of the boldness in the flavor that I thought Abt 12 had.  Medium to full body, smooth carbonation fine carbonation that is very soft on the tongue. For a 10% beer, this is way too easy to drink at this point.

There's also a pretty strong toffee, caramel presence that stands out amidst the fruit. Virtually no alcohol in the aroma at all, which never ceases to amaze me.

A bit yeasty, with some tartness prevalent as well. Peppery. A bit of sour cherries when warmed. Doesn't hide it's alcohol as well as Rochefort 10 does, even though it's lower in ABV. A bit disappointing in that regard.  Body is slightly over-carbonated as the beer foams a bit too much on the palate. Medium bodied. Agree with others that the fizziness decreases as the beer warms. Finish is dry, slightly syrupy.  Overall, this was a tasty quad, but I found myself preferring Rochefort compared to this. Alcohol was too noticeable and carbonation a notch too high.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,bobbypaulson,3.97,have tried both the larger corked and the smaller capped version. It pours a merky light brown color with an off white head that leaves a little layer of white bubbles at the top after it subsides. The smell is sweet an some what yeast. The taste is strong and boozy up front full but then evens out with a sweet dried fruit finish. Nicely balanced and an over all nice Quad.,Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,cooler4life,4.45,"A: Half finger white head that slowly dissipates. Appears to be highly carbonated with a chorus of dense, fine bubbles as the head settles. Lacing is moderately evident as the beer swirls around the glass. Color resembles a sun ripened date. Almost two tone when held to the light.  S: Brown sugar first, followed by dark fruit. I hesitate to say this but...grape soda? This would indicate a complex smell that my mind can't comprehend. Malty, fruity fermented goodness.  T: Malty breadiness, followed by plums and raisins. Almost like a holiday date bread with some rum. Toward the end, I pick up on the alcoholic warming undertones and it finishes with a lingering nutty sweetness.  M: The mouthfeel is really fantastic. My tongue seems to hover in my mouth elevated by mini hot air balloons of carbonation. Magic carpet.  O: Mouthfeel and smell stand out to me as exceptional qualities.

259,1708,magictacosinus,4.2,"Poured into a goblet from a 330ml bottle. Freshness date is listed as ""22/02/16.""  Pours a cloudy, extremely traditional looking color for what a quad should typically look like. A creamy looking head fills the glass with glee but slowly descends as time goes on. Looks pretty delicious, resembles liquid bread in one of the more striking ways.  Upon smelling it, instant notes of rum, raisins and sugar malts arrive. Caramel is really intense here. Oranges, prunes, cream - there's so many complex flavors to derive from. The dried hops really tingle the nose here. Smells like fresh dark bread, straight out of the over. This is a prime example of an ideal sniffing beer.  As for the taste, it's unbelievably malty - as expected! However, getting past that, there's a lot going in this beer. It contains a yeasty, fantastically lasting taste that remains on the tongue for a long time. The alcohol permeates a bit, and then warms up the throat generously. The dried fruity tastes are what really captivate me here. It's great mouthfeel makes it very redrinkable. It's an absolutely perfect quad in those terms, as it is creamy, slightly chewy and balances bitter and sweet flavors carefully.  Uses the original yeast strand of Westvleteren, eh? Including many other similar regional ingredients? Makes me more willing to merely stick with this for now! This bottle I bought (in France) was not nearly as tasty as the 750ml corked bottle I drank from (in the US) or as fresh as the 33cl bottle I had in Brussels! Still, while it's not my favorite quad, this is a massive beer. One of the greatest quads, and a recipe that deserves respect and acclaim. In my opinion, one of the best beers to convert safe beer drinkers to the ""dark side"" of good quality beer.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

259,1708,bramsdell,4.75,"Poured from 12oz bottle into imp pint glass. Yeah, it isn't optimal, but I don't have a chalice (yet).  A: Dark brown body that reveals a beautiful dark ruby when held up to light. The head is very large for a beer of this color and, while it does recede, remains at least 1.5cm throughout.  S: Fruity and spicy. I would say that the predominant aroma is the spiciness, but there are very full notes of both raisins and malt. This ups the sweetness of the aroma, overall, making for a great balance for the spicy smell. Finally, there is a bit of boozy bite in the smell, which balances the spice and sweet very well.  T: The order of notes changes. First is the raisin flavors, followed by the malt sweetness. This is a quad, of course it will be sweet, but this is a thick, full sweetness that is fruity and malty in nearly equal parts. The spices are noticed as the sweet flavors begin to reside, providing a bit of a biting contrast to such sweetness. Combine this spiciness with the bit of alcohol at the very back end, and you have a wonderfully balanced beer without any remarkable hop notes.  M: Thick, fully, sweet. It's awesome. It feels like a very light, slightly bubbly, syrup, but in the best of ways. Truly a beer to be sipped and enjoyed.  O: Awesome.

The etching at the bottom of the glass is forming a slowly-bubbling island of head in the middle. Nice to see the etching actually doing its job, great retention.  Lots of yeast on the nose along with bread, light spices (coriander, nutmeg), astringent minerals, tons of fruit (fig, raisin, pear) and a hint of alcohol.  Very malty but perfectly balanced with earthy hops. Lots of dark fruit and caramel up front, figs and raisins; lightly-roasted malt, yeast and an alcohol bite in the middle; cocoa and dry spices (coriander, cinnamon and nutmeg) toward the finish. As complex and packed with flavour as it is well-balanced. I'm sure I would be rating this a perfect 5 with the right amount of age on it.  This one fits right in with other trappist-style ales with its near-perfect mouthfeel. Full, creamy medium body with moderate carbonation.  It's easy to see why this one is regarded as being among the top few Belgian quadrupels; I would need to try it alongside Rochefort 10 to remember which I prefer.

(Kasteel glass.)  The first thing I notice in the smell is the alcohol. It is quite appearant. dark fruit, caramel, banana and dark malts.  Taste starts out a little sour then the malts kick in and give it a bit of a bready flavour. The sweetness and tartness stay. Dark fruits, some hops not much.

T/M: The sweet, complex, malt hits the pallet first, dominated by cherries. The tastes shift quickly as the beer moves around on my tongue--there is a grape quality, and a tongue numbing anise flavor that really coats the mouth and lingers along with a bit of the alcohol's heat. The beer is incredibly smooth and creamy, despite the carbonation evident in its appearance.  Overall, this is one heck of a rich beer.

259,1708,bensiff,4.35,"Into a St. Bernardus goblet from a 750ml bottle this is a deep mahogany brew. I half inch head rises and quickly dissipates to a small island leaving no lacing on the glass.  The nose is of figs, cellar dust, and molasses laden sugars. These odors continue onto the palette while adding notes of spice and clove. Mouthfeel is a full robust body with enough attenuation to keep it from being cloying. Overall this is an outstanding beer that warrants plenty of time to contemplate. Unless your liver is well trained don't open the 750 alone.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Knapp85,4.47,"I liked this beer quite a bit but in all honest I must say that the La Trappe and the Rochefort 10 still remain higher on my favorites list. This beer poured out as a medium color of brown, the head was a bit fizzy and doesn't leave behind on the glass. The smell of the beer has a bit of alcohol on the nose followed by the dark fruits and yeast. The taste of the beer is good but I find it less pleasing than the two Quad's I mentioned before. The mouthfeel is medium but remains kind of thin too. Decent amount of carbonation, overall I think this beer is worthy of trying. I would love to do a sampling party of Quad's to see how they hold up against each other.  Just had on tap the other night and it was sensational. Very enjoyable brew.

Light tan head leaves some decent lacing.  S - Raisins, figs, good dark rum, a little bubble gum.  T - Rum cake? Very good rum cake. Booze is just enough to bring all the flavors out. Buuble gum again on the end. Not to sweet, also dries out nicely.  M - Medium low carbonation. Body is on the lighter side of medium. Allows the flavors to get to every part of your mouth.  D - Medium. It is going down smooth. The rum/alcohol bite reminds you to take it slow.  Great beer! Extremely flavorful and complex.

259,1708,output01x,4.02,"Poured from a 330 mL. capped bottle (Best Before 07/15/15) into a chalice.  A strong pour yields a 1-finger tan-colored head that quickly recedes to a thin, clumpy dusting and thin foam ring. The body is a mahagony brown that nears black. Some decent lacing can be seen throughout consumption, but is not strong enough to stick around.  Sweet dark fruits comprise the majority of the nose. Notes of plum and raisin are joined by banana, candi sugar, and licorice.  Sweet and earthy at first, this beer's taste is as complex as it is delicious. Like the nose, it carries notes of dark fruits including plum and raisin. It also has flavors of brown sugar, molasses, burnt caramel, and spices. Some light alcohol warmth is also noticeable, but just barely.  Medium to full bodied with good carbonation, this beer is as sippable as it is gulpable. The body is nice and light considering the flavors, giving this beer a very refreshing quality. The carbonation is only slightly fizzy and does not get in the way of the flavors at all.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

A mild sweetness with some dark fruit. The finish has the spice notes along with some warm alcohol and a mild bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Medium body with very smooth carbonation and a slick finish.

259,1708,MaxSpang,4.35,"APPEARANCE  Poured into a chalice.   The color is a hazy Coca-Cola brown. It's a deep reddish brown and is very murky. The head is super foamy with teeny-tiny bubbles. It was about a pinky's worth and stuck around throughout the whole bottle. B-e-a-utiful lacing to the bottom of the glass.   SMELL  The aroma has that slicy Belgian smell. The smell is fairly subtle, but there is a lot of dark fruits and sweetness. There's also a good amount of alcohol in the nose which mixes well with the other smells.   TASTE  Lots of dark fruits in the taste - raisin, prunes, and over-ripe plums. Even though the beer is dry, there's a lot of perceived sweetness. It has that Belgian yeasty character, but isn't quite as spicy as other Belgian beers I have had. This beer is wonderfully balanced. It's almost a paradox - it is sweet yet dry, and simple yet complex. Almost NO alcohol is in the taste.  MOUTHFEEL  This beer is extremely drinkable. The beer is nice and sweet up front, but finishes dry. Carbonation is minimal, but the bottle-conditioning creates tiny bubbles that add to the perceived body (much like Nitro-tapped draft beers). The beer is very smooth and goes down ridiculously easy for a 10% ABV beer!   OVERALL  This beer is awesome! It's pretty easy to find in the States, and it has everything going for it. This is the type of beer that can be aged and brought out for special occasions, or just as a nice way to end the night. There's a reason Belgians are so well respected when it comes to beer - this beer is one of those reasons. ",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Head on the beer was an off-white that was fairly fizzy and didn't last long. Left a nice lacing around the beer S - Fairly complex smell. Picking up a floral type smell, spice, and yeast upon initial smell. Upon additional review, picking up dark fruit smell and subtle alcohol esters T - Complex tasting beer, which is a good thing. Taste yeast, malts, kind of bready. The aftertaste brings out the sweetness of the beer, which continues where the nose left off with dark fruits and floral smell. Really enjoyed the long aftertaste. For such a ABV the alcohol is hidden very well. M - Very carbonated, tingles on the tongue, brings a fizzy, light feel to the mouth O - Really enjoyed this beer, thought it had many qualities of a great beer...and it tastes very good",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

A thick off-white head was present and lingered. I could detect a bit of fruit mixed in with the alcohol on the nose. Taste was quite sweet with fruit, carmel, and yeast taking the palate. On the mouth, it was not too heavy and had a good finish that was not too hoppy.

Alcohol is noticeable throughout, but the brew is surprisingly mellow for such a high ABV. Plums, cherries, and spicy notes are also present.  M - Good carbonation with a wonderful coating and a slightly dry and bitter finish.  O - Not bad.

The raw materials of bread and some dark fruits are present. It has a distict smell that lets you know it's Belgian. Great!  T: It begins with that yeasty taste and then the fun starts. You get a VERY balanced combination of bread, dark fruits and alcohol. It also has a light note of marzipan which makes it so much nicer. It finishes with some hop bitterness and it finishes very dry. That makes it even easier to drink.  M: Just one word. Medium. Nothing overbearing. I'll say probably a notch up of Rochefort 8.  O: Everything is just right in the center it's so great to drink. It's never overbearing so I recommend it to those who are thinking about starting to drink quads.

259,1708,Callaghan,4.47,"I've had this one a bunch, but never tried it in an oversized wine glass. So, this goes into the wine glass. Usually, it's a Chimay chalice...  750ml corked bottle, best before date of 15.03.16. Poured into a DaVini wine glass. As soon as the corked was popped, foam started spilling from the bottle, thus, I had to act quickly. I think this was a result from letting it sit on the counter top to warm up a little.  A: This Quad pours a rusty, cloudy, brown. A slight bronze hue when held up to the light. Up comes a massive, khaki colored 3 finger head, but it quickly dissipates to a 1/4 inch creamy layer. Lacing was spotty at best, and after the first few sips, it's all but gone.  S: Dark fruits come through strong, as does the yeast. It smells a little sweet too, which is pleasant. Alcohol is present, but doesn't hint that it's 10% abv.  T: I taste a lot of dark fruit. Malts also play a big role, and the alcohol just mixes wonderfully with everything. There is a lot going on with this one. It reminds me of brown sugar on the finish, with a nice sweetness that mixes again with the alcohol, and lingers for a little while. It invites another sip, and another...  M: A swirl in the glass suggests that it is medium to full bodied, but on the tongue, I get a nice medium body. Carbonation is just right, not too much, but enough to entice the senses. It lingers for a little while, as if to ask ""would you like another?""  O: A spectacular beer. To be honest, I enjoyed it better in the wine glass than the Chalice. Satisfying, good alcohol warmth throughout, wonderful tastes and smells, and easy to drink, though, for me, it's a sipper.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

A very sweet finish and a very complex beer. I drank it out of my Westmalle chalice at around cellar temperature. The first time I had this beer was at a pub and it was on draft. A shame b/c it was served very cold like the other draft beers and many of the flavors weren't noted.  I absolutely love this beer and would drink it anytime, anywhere.

259,1708,hoptualBrew,4.7,"Bomber of this classic poured into a big wine glass. Cant believe it took me this long to give this beer a try.  Deep & dark thick amber brown - like a raisin. Huge light khaki head with fine little mini carb bubbles.  Smells very boozy & alot of dark fruits and malts. The only thing I can relate it to is soaking raisins and plums in liquor & mashing it with brown sugar. Smells really good.  Wow! With each sip my tongue plays host to an orgy of intense flavors. Up front, along with a prickly carbonation that awakens the palate, are the dark fruits - raisins, plum, grape. The brown sugar candy & nutty like sweetness remains throughout. Booze takes a strong stance starting midway back, especially on the aftertaste - a nice warming alcohol burn.  This quad weighs in pretty nicely on the body (7/10) matched equally by the carbonation. It is nearly champagne-like in that sense.  I can see why this is a classic & at $8.99 - $1.00 (coupon) = $7.99 from Total Wine & More, I highly recommend it.

The first thing i am tasting is just the beer's pureness. I wonder if it has anything to do with the well water that they use to brew it. Much like the smell, I am getting a lot of darker fruits: Cherry, Plum, Raisins, Blackberry. The alcohol is there but that is to be expected for a 10%ABV brew.  MF - Medium-full bodied brew.

This beer is great in the bottle and is exceptional on tap. It is smooth with dark fruits (especially grapes, slight hint of raisons and figs as well, but not too much fruits to ruin the smooth malts that follow. The 12% is SO well hidden that this beer should come with a warning. At $9.00 a glass, I forced myself to stop at three, but I could drink this all night. It pairs well with spicy food (in my opinion), but does so well just by itself.  Overall: This is in my top 3 beer list of all time and is a cant-miss.

S: You can hear the groans from the anticipationists a mile away, guess what it smells like? Yes, deep boozy figs, raisins, dates, and a nice malty back bone. If it didn’t, would it really be an exceptional Quad? Maybe but do rhetorical questions still perform well in a global economy? We shall see.  T: This has a nice syrupy quality that is abated by the tiny bubbles that pump up the palate mildly. I don’t want to take deep swallows of this by any means but, it is a great beer to sip on if only a 10oz pour were provided. I don’t want to say that you can’t opt for the old 3 Liter chestnut that we have all seen, however, I will opine that you have demons that you are chasing that the public remains aware of.  M: Again, this has a decent coating lying somewhere between the crazy OG of an imperial stout, that hates you, and a loving DIPA that lingers for a bit too long after dinner parties. This is perfect if you want to brandish a huge corked masterpiece and impress a “boss” languidly. “CORKS IN BEER WELL I NEVER!” the Applebees hostess exclaims as a cork rickochets against a picture of a a tube filled with ice cream.

Tasted of spices, notably cloves and pepper, a pinch of anise, plenty of sweet molasses and brown sugar, dark fruits, and yeast. The alcohol was not as well masked as some quads and was evident in the flavor.  Mouthfeel was rich, full bodied, slick, with fairly tangy carbonation for a quad and a powerful alcohol warming.

Maybe i should let it warm a bit more. Ah yes, after another couple sips and an amp in temps, this brew is tasting much better. The sweet breadiness goes quite well with the dark fruits presented. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied and has a smooth finish.  Overall, this is another great example of a Quad and I will be revisiting this brew in the upcoming colder months of winter. Just not much of a summer brew here.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,MadCat,4.7,"Appearance: Pours a dark brown with a good tan head that lasts, and leaves good lacing  Smell: Very bready smell at first, then it turns into some Belgian yeast funk, sweet malts, and a hint of cloves.  Taste: Plums, sweet bready malts, cherries, hints of cloves, some earthiness, and a little grape.  Mouthfeel: Full body, good smooth carbonation, creamy feel  Overall: A very good quad, I personally feel it is way better than Rochefort 10. I wouldn't change a thing about it.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,K9AleingPiss,3.91,"The appearance is better than the label...once poured into my glass the dark flavorful color entices the senses. The smell was more of an odor unfortuantely almost medicinal,wont be coughing tonight. Thankfully the taste is better than the smell,a nice vibrant tingling,as I tippled. Should have a ninja on the label....thought this beer was kinda dead..but then ""pow""..nice malty,breads..and fruits with a good balance of tangy hops and alcohol. Almost makes me want to become a monk and move to Belgium. To me this is a seasonal taste,however,better in front of a fire, and snow outside. Its 104 degrees outside right now so maybe i should have waited and reviewed this @ winter.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Ruger,4.75,"A - Pours a dark brown with a a thick tannish white head.  S - Bread and dark fruits it's really sweet smelling and not as much booze as I expected.  T - I started drinking it while it was pretty cold, which is what I like to do with most beers, to see how flavors progress as they warm. And as this beer warmed the flavors just really came out caramel, dark fruits, brown sugar and bread to just name a few.  M - Perfect mouthfeel extremely smooth and the carbonation was not overwhelming, just a little on the watery side but when drinking on a warm summer night I'm not going to complain it was amazing.

Strong presence of molasses. M-Very thick and rich. Lots of carbonation. A sweet beer. Overall, an outstanding Belgian ale. Very rich, dark, sweet flavors.

T: Drunk at several temps; cool to warm. The longer you wait, the more complex and exciting the taste. Caramel and malts hug your senses. Like drinking a symphony that just gets better with each note.  Mouthfeel: thick and sweet. You just want to let this baby roll around on your tongue.

Head has long lasting staying power, and leaves plenty of lacing on the glass.  Nose is much lighter than I expected. Slightly sweet, with some caramel and maybe a hint of plum.  While the nose might have been light, the body certainly is not. Initial tastes are raisins and plums. Some mild caramel malts. Maybe a hint of alcohol, but I certainly would not guess this was 10%. A bit of spice, along the lines of black pepper, towards the end. All this gets better as it warms up.  One of the very few quads I have tried, but right now one of the best.

Smell-Lots of dark fruits, spice, and alcohol.  Taste-Raisons, Figs, and some cherry. Spices are of the likes of coriander, black pepper. Alcohol is lets you know it's there. Lots of yeast and lots of carbonation. Very nice flavors.  Mouthfeel-Prickly on the tongue, a shit ton of carbonation. Full bodied. Carbonation acts as a great palate cleanser, just a little too much for me. Would love to try one aged a couple years.

This is the strongest point for this one, in my opinion. Malty and sweet with many wonderful scents coming through, including yeast, which was unexpected. I wonder what strain this is, I would love to brew something with it.  T- A bit harsh compared to some other quads but still good. See other reviews for flavors etc.  M- Nice on the palate. Somewhat heavy carbonation keeps the sweetness from lingering too long.  O- A great example of the style, but nothing extraordinary.

Flavor: A noticeable metallic twang appears at first. Dry malty sweetness w/ an almost minty quality. Light apple cider. Interesting flavor profile, but not exactly what I was expecting for the style.  Mouthfeel: Medium body w/ high CO2. Peppery alcohol warmth thru the finish in the mouth and throat. Alcohol creates a bit of a sharp, drying feeling on the tongue.  Overall: I tried this one next to a Trappistes Rochefort 10 to compare the two, and this one definitely lost out. I was expecting slightly different, yet excellent, interpretations of the same style, but this one let me down a bit.

Smell - immediate and up front a bouquet of plumbs/figs with undertones of malty sweetness, and a hint of caramelized sugar on the nose.  Taste - exactly how it smells, plumbs/figs/prunes, malts present balanced, alcohol is well hidden.

259,1708,Rifugium,4.63,"First had: on tap at Eulogy, Philly, PA  Most enthusiasts know and love this beer, as do I. Many said enthusiasts also prefer this beer to such heavy hitters as Rochefort 10 and Westvleteren 12. Well, it's certainly more obtainable than the latter, and cheaper than the former, but as far as being better, I supposed that's a matter of personal taste.  Pours--preferably into a chalice, and more preferably into a signature chalice--a deep carameled mahogany color with a firm, creamy half inch of ivory head that retains through the session, and leaves beautiful lacing. When you see a beer presented like this, it's just...this is what beer is supposed to look like. This is craftmanship. Aroma is rich with dark sugars, dark fruits, and spicy Belgian yeast. Taste of toasted bread, with lots of brown sugar up front, along with dark dried fruits--raisins, figs, plums--caramel, tobacco, almond, subtle hop spiciness, and an ubiquitous alcohol bite. Not heavy, but full-bodied, and highly drinkable.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Dark fruits and nice bready tones throughout. Not quite my style though, this is my very first Quad!  M - This was my favorite part about the beer. It went down relatively smooth and hot mostly because of the high alcohol content. I should have waited longer after I pulled it out of the fridge because it got way better as it warmed.  O - This was a good beer. I love Belgian style beer and this was my first venture into Quads. I feel like it probably does the style good justice but I still want to try the Rochefort variety and maybe someday the Westy.

Taste: slight oak, somewhat fruity and spicy at the same time. The high ABV is completely masked. It's hard to pick out any one flavor as they all blend together so well.

Definitely like it as it warmed up!  M- medium bodied with little to no carbonation. Note: as I opened the bottle to ""breathe""and walked away for a few minutes, the bottle erupted and the beer spilled out of the bottle.

Smell - The smell of the beer is quite sweet and full bodied. I smelled raisins and plums. Very malty aroma.  Taste - The beer was a little bitter when it first hit my tongue. The bittnerness mellowed out into a faint sweetness as it passed to the back of my mouth. I could taste raisins and plums as it went down.  Mouthfeel - Pretty heavily bodied. The beer was very smooth though and pleasing.  Overall - This beer was quite good. It was not as good as a Rochefort 8 that I had, but it was still exquisite. A very well-brewed beer.

259,1708,mactrail,3.83,"Dark amber and well carbonated. Rich but only slightly sweet. Complex rhythm of flavors as you'd hope from a good Belgian ale. Honeyed taste with nutty flavors. Interesting bitter twang adds to the long aftertaste. Raising, caramel, bitter chocolate.  Great dessert beer. Rich and perks up the taste buds.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,GoldenChild,4.13,"Bottle into a Glass A= Gorgeous, solid dark brown, carbonating body fed the head until I got tired of waiting for it to go down. Im diving in.  S- The wonderful yeast and dark chocolate malt aroma fills the room once the ale has warmed. The fragrant raw brown sugar and ripe fruit come along as well. This was has a beautiful bouquet.  T-  Lovely malted dough supports the remaining flavors. The malts are dark, as are the sugars. This really has the most remarkable sugar flavors that Ive ever had. The sugar mixture and the present but very smooth alcohol create a new food group: Liquid alcohol sugar. As Lucille Ball would say, It tastes just like candy.  The yeast too deserves a second mention. This has got to be one of the smoothest doughy yeast flavors Ive ever tasted. These are all complimented tremendously by very light spicing (hint of clove, cinnamon, etc) and fruity sugars such as the taste youd find in ripe apricots, pears dipped in honey, and apple slices rolled in brown sugar and cinnamon.  M- Lightly carbonated and smooth, smooth, smooth. The ale is full-bodied for sure, filling the mouth with a chewy wad of malty sugary alcohol with every bite (I mean sip).  D- This was a yummy beer My wife and I both loved it. For the price i would buy Trappistes Rochefort 10.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,jkcurran99,4.7,"St. Bernardus Abt 12 is the beer that got me hooked on quad Belgiums. A big thanks to my boss Kent for introducing me to this wonderful brew.  The color is a deep brown, accompanied with an offwhite head which dissipates rather quickly.  This is a very strong beer, with a 10.5% alcohol content. While some say they taste the alcohol in the beer, I do not notice it as much as in other high alcohol content beers. The taste is very bold with sweet, fruity undertones. It is very smooth, and shows no signs of bitterness. The beer is heavy, but well carbonated.  While the label shows a picture of a monk, St. Bernardus beers are not true trappist beers (made by trappist monks).  If you ever get to try Abt 12 on a nitros tap, I would highly recommend it. The nitros changes the head on the beer significantly, creating a creamier, longer lasting head.  From all aspects, Abt. 12 has become increasing popular. My local beer merchant is not a big fan of the beer due to this fact. He prides himself on helping people discover new beers, and it is difficult for him to see people get stuck on one beer, like many have with this quad. However, overall this is a great example of a dark, rich quad Belgium.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Lacing is thick and very heavy.  S: Aromas of dark candy sugar, and dark fruits. The aroma is quite strong and gains intensity as it warms. A sweet aroma and very complex with a juicy malt influence.  T/M: The front is a smooth and creamy mouthfeel, with plum and dark currants. The body is thick, while still not too heavy, but full of dark candy flavor. Lingering taste is high, with a nice backbone of malts. Not to hoppy, but the bitterness runs a nice thread down the middle.  Overall: This is a very nice Quad, and one that is well suited for the price.

It had an off-white head that dissipated quickly. Very little retention throughout the drink.  S--You can smell a faint hint of alcohol. There is also an overwhelmingly warm smell. Like warm banana nut bread. Raisins, dates, plums, and other dark fruits.  T--Wonderful. You get a little bit of an alcohol hit, but mostly it's the sweetness of the quad coming through. A lot of the dark fruits play on the tongue, and there's a hint of brown sugar on the back of the tongue.  M--Tiny bit of carbonation. Medium bodied mouthfeel overall.

ABT 12 has a very dark brown color and pours extremely murky. Lots of alcohol feet on the sides. Retention of the thin, off white head is ever-so-slight. Lacing looks rather ominous.  Lots of sweet malt characters in the nose. Candy-apple sweetness, some dark fruit, a little spice, caramel, and a little yeast funk. Taste backs this up strongly. It's far more sweet and not all that bready. Toffee, caramel, less dark fruit. Good balance on the tongue. Nice crispness overall.  Feel isn't hugely thick which matches the drink quite well. Medium body. Good carbonation as often reported. Slight ABV in the taste but none in the nose. Considering the gravity, it's drinkable. Probably quaffable. Okay, Belgians could drink this by the gallon. But I'm not Belgian, so I'll just stick with the single pour for tonight.  I enjoyed it, it was very much what I hoped for and I will revisit.

259,1708,BarryMFBurton,4.58,"Ahhh, cracking open a St. Bernardus Abt. 12 while listening to Camille Saint-Saëns’ “Carnival of the Animals;” never have I felt so refined. The snobbery only lasted a few moments, though, before I remembered that I was sitting in my tiny college apartment, just steps away from the place where I got sick on Busch Light less than a year ago. Ah well, a slight delusion of grandeur every once in a while never hurt anyone, right?  There’s nothing false about this beer, though. Its reputation describes it as sophisticated, well-crafted, and worthy of its international fame. Sounds good to me! Let’s see how it stacks up:  A: Whoa, did I do something wrong here? As soon as I popped off the bottlecap on this one, a rush of foam rose straight to the lip – almost like champagne. I can only assume that this is what was meant to happen, so I quickly grabbed my glass and poured away. Carbonation erupts from the body, churning the mixture as I pour. What I end up with is a reddish-brown brew with hints of orange. A large, beige head stays at about two fingers for quite a while, leaving an impressively thick lace as it recedes. Bits of sediment dance along the bottom; not surprising, as I noticed an oozy dark residue in the bottle after I poured it. This is one of the best looking beers I have come across thus far.  S: A robust statement here. A big malt character carries its way through fresh peaches and mandarins, to a syrupy citrus marmalade. Wheat is in top form, giving the fresh start a nice crisp following, and transitioning easily to some breads and booze toward the end. A noticeably full introduction to this offering.  T: Damn. This is a meal in a bottle. The alcohol is big and warming, and it’s the first to make its presence known on the palate. It couples with the gargantuan breadiness of the yeast to form a relaxed, warm-meat-and-potatoes-entrée feeling. Satisfying to so many degrees. The fresh citrus that was so prevalent in the nose is nowhere to be found; only the thick marmalade is evident. That’s really the only thing I would have liked to see more of, as the freshness would have added a wider, more complex palate. Everything else was executed perfectly, though, and it’s very, very tough to try to focus on any negatives when you’re drinking such a great beer. I would love to taste a bottle that’s been aged for a year or two longer.  M: The carbonation does more to mix the body, I feel, than excite the tongue. After such an explosively foamy start, the bubbliness bypassed my taste buds and I found incredible smoothness. As in, aged-in-bottle-for-months smoothness. Tremendous.  O: Well, if you’re having this beer with a homemade dinner, you’d better be a killer cook – this will likely outshine any of your culinary creations. This is on a completely different level when it comes to beer; I only wish we had more breweries like in the states. This was truly a landmark in my beer journey, and when I get a cellar, this will certainly be one of my first additions for aging purposes. If you haven’t had it, spend the extra money and get it TODAY – you won’t regret it!",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

There is some sediment floating around in the beer. Smells of dark fruits, some malty bread, and spices. Taste is very much like the smell with the dark ripe fruits, bready malts, spices (clove/cinnamon), and some yeast flavors. There is a good level of carbonation in this one with a crisp and clean mouthfeel. This makes the beer very smooth and easy to drink.

S: A fine bouquet of dark fruit, muddy malt, trappist yeast, aromatic space and more. Wish it was a bit more aromatic but what there is is a classic quad.  T: Juicy dark fruit and musty malts mix with hefty flavors of molasses, dried fig, some dry hops, brown sugar, straw, and more. A nice warm wave of flavors.  M: Medium in feel not coating like I like in quads and plenty of carbonation.

Dark brown, light tan head. After all of this talk about the ""Flat Abbey"" I crack this one open - made at a real abbey no less - and it fizzes over relentlessly. It was still in my fridge for hours, but almost blows up on me. Not surprisingly, the head lasts for quite some time and the lacing is on the low end of epic.  Good God, this beer smells good. I mean great. Malty sweetness, but also this floral aroma - like tulips, man. Just so pleasant and inviting. Phenomenal aroma, really.  A luxurious, warming, boozy, sweet concoction. Brown sugar and some dark fruits, but nothing extreme. This one maintains a buoyancy.  Incredibly smooth mouthfeel, despite the *overflowing* carbonation. Insanely drinkable.  This is a lovely brew.

There is a slightly smoky coffee flavor and many of the same fruit flavors from the smell.

Not much of a head (no more than a fingers worth) as I saw a youtube video saying to pour it straight down the middle.  Smell: This is where I was a bit disappointed; I was expecting a strong aroma, but it just wasn't there for me. I smelled dark fruits, but I really had to place my nose as close to the beer as possible before I got anything.  Taste: Exceptional. I was able to taste the dark fruits in the beer, which helped make my experience as good as it was. I'm not able to describe (yet) the fruits that I'm getting, but I know that because of them, the beer just tasted outstanding.  Mouthfeel: This is a heavily carbonated beer. Even as I poured it, I could here the beer fizz all the way through my pour. For having 10% ABV, this sure doesn't feel like it does- very crisp as it goes down the hatch.  Overall: This is an excellent beer, and I would definitely recommend everybody who hasn't tried it to get themselves a bottle.

259,1708,crnipeter,3.51,"The beer with obvious good aging potential has been sitting in my cellar for nearly a year and a half but still seems to need additional time for maturation, so a re-review is pending for this one. A gusher pours airy beige head with poor retention that quickly dissipates. The coppery brown body initially exhibits good clarity but gets hazed and flooded with yeasty floaties with the consecutive pourings. Aroma is an interplay of malty sweetness, fruity esters, alcohol and spiciness. The rich malt with caramel and bread crust qualities embeds strong fruity esters of grape, perfumy, spicy alcohol that flares out and peppery spiciness from yeast-derived phenols. The flavor is non-excessive malty sweetness counterbalanced by alcohol, then comes the bread crust, grape-like fruitiness and prominent peppery spiciness. Finish is medium-dry with light bitterness and alcohol warmth. Medium-light bodied with fine, effervescent carbonation that quickly dissipates leaving flat texture behind. Not as good as I remember it to be and far from my conception of the secular-version of Westvelteren 12. Too thin, with poorly masked alcohol and fruitiness limited to grapes, lacking heavenly orchard of all kind of ripe dark fruits and almond character that once possessed - or I'm just getting more demanding?

T: Similar to what is picked up in the nose. Lots of brown sugar and spices, plums and raisins with some alcohol all packed into sweet bready malt. Very nice combination of flavors, delicious, surprisingly refreshing and drinkable for a 10.5% ABV ale.  M: Plenty of carbonation and a medium-full body smooth from bubbly start to sweet finish.

Decent sized tan head that fades into a film coating.  Smell: A sweet aroma of dark fruits including cherries, and raisins. Hints of spice, caramel, and hops.  Taste: Strong taste of the dark fruits, caramel malt, yeasty sweetness, and spice. A lot more hop bitterness than came from the smell. A hint of chocolate in the finish. Very good balance.

Almost dorve to Quebec city but finally found it 15minutes from my house at the Cavendish Mall. Really nice looking bottle. Wish I had the right glasswae but I guess the Sam Adams perfect glass will have to do. My bottle says 10%  A- Cloudy auburn-brown. Light beige, pillowy, dense head.  S- Pretty light. I was expecting more. Kind of dusty. Usual quad dark fruit and spices but all very, very tame... maybe it's too cold. Some molasses. Red licorice. Dark malt ( a bit stout like) in the end.  T- Tastes a bit like a maple beer. The dark fruit and spices is all quite subtle. Really getting some maple syrup in here even though it's probably just dark candi sugar. Really nice after-taste. Maybe my buds are off but this really tastes like maple syrup.  M- Kind of disappointed here. One of the top reasons I enjoy quads and great beers from Belgium is because of the mouthfeel. This is more prickly and thin than creamy and dense. Medium to high carbonation. A forgettable mouthfeel unlike my first Quad love: Chimay Grande Réserve and Rochefort 10.  O- Well this is very good. I do want more but am glad I didn't drive all the way to Quebec for it. Great beer but I still feel let down.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Everything present in the aroma is here too. Yeast, fruit, and chocolate. Sort of sweet up front. But the sweetness is cut short with a slightly bitter finish. It almost tastes like the bitterness is from some dark roasted malts rather than hops. A slight warming from the alcohol, but surprisingly, the alcohol is hidden quite well.

Very large head that is light tan off the pour, takes much time to recede, with some tightness and retention. Gorgeous clear indian red body. Leaves a good small puck and collar while drinking also.  Smell is kind of small. Sensing some yeast , not much really going on here, a small hint of gaseous carbonation. Kind of disappointing. This isn't very open it seems. Kind of powdery too.  Taste is much improved. Small malty tones but also a spicey almost phenolic tasting hop. This is different, a feel of gaseous carbonation and malt backbone. This is not fruity tasting or sweet at all, it's kind of neat like that very unexpected. Has a nice warming pit stomach feeling too, but feels a little wet also and slight hint of tonic water taste and prickliness.  Overall it's interesting but I was expecting a bigger nose on this. It does feel very much like a sipper that's for sure.

Aromas of Belgian yeast, toasted chocolate, sweet fruits (raisin), and rum all come out.  T-Completely balanced. Upfront I taste the sweet malts (caramel)and spicy sweet yeast. While drinking, slight banana notes and brown sugar are also detected. The hops are noticeable and tie together this great beer. Each drink has a new taste and complexity to enjoy. The high alcohol content is well hidden.  M-Thinner than some Quads but creamy, smooth and keeps you wanting another drink.  D-Unbelievable for the style-could drink this one all day-although I'm guessing the alcohol would catch up with you before you got sick of drinking this one.  Overall-this is the best Quad I've ever had-yes this includes Westvleteren 12. Excellent-if you like Quads and haven't tried this one-this is one you have to try a bottle of.

Next smell reveals layers of dark fruits and Belgian yeast and bread. Very intense.  T - very sweet but not cloying first sip has flavors of ripe dark fruits and a slight mix of fresh ripe berries. Mid-palate liquor soaked more complex dark fruits followed by yeast and sweet bread. A touch of alcohol is noted but it's so well disguised it's almost like you're tasting one of those candied impersonations of a liquor. Banana and clove are more noted as the beer reaches room temp.

A great bouquet of dark fruits (figs, prunes, and dates) and roasted malts (with caramel, chocolate and bread notes), with yeast and just a bit of an earthy hoppiness.  T - I feel that trying to describe all the tasting notes of this beer may do the whole experience more harm than good, but nevertheless... You should first get a bursting flavour of dried fruit (most notably, dates), with almost a port-like grape flavour to it. Then comes the sweetness, with an almost chocolatey finish to it. Slightly bitter, a little bready. An outstanding taste all in all!  M - This is an exceptionally smooth quadrupel! Medium-bodied, not at all heavy or hefty. The alcohol can be tasted, but not enough to make it boozy. Moderate sweetness to it, and a very velvety, smooth texture.

There was moderate carbonation in its cloudy very dark brown body.  AROMA: Moderate nutty chocolate with a bit of caramel, a light floral scent, a hint of alcohol, and very light smells of brown sugar, plum and raisin. The entire scent gave off an enticing hint of what was to come.  TASTE: The malt taste was a bit heavier than the aroma had led me to expect: a heavy taste of caramel and nutty chocolate was well balanced with a light floras hops flavor, some light alcohol and light brown sugar, plum, and raisin. Altogether, a very well balanced and pleasantly tasty beer.  MOUTHFEEL: This beer had a medium body with a nice creamy texture. Carbonation was soft and there was no particular aftertaste. The initial flavor was a moderate sweetness. The medium-length finish was also moderately sweet with just a slight hops-induced bitterness. Body lacing was good and the lacing dissipated slowly.

259,1708,ShogoKawada,3.31,"tiny bottle (33cl?) into wide chalice. Cannot locate date, looks like label has been through hell.  A- A ruddy brown with a bit of red in the pour, head was larger than expected and took a while to settle. Sandy off-white.  S- Nose is pretty light.. candi sugar/dark fruit and miscellaneous spices. Opens up a bit as it comes closer to room temp.  T- A lot of chocolate and dark fruit. Lots of caramel/toffee and red grape skin. Fleeting taste of ginger has me scratching my head. Sometimes I can't find it, but it crossed my mind a few times while imbibing.  M- No sign of the ABV, very impressive balance.  D- Moderate. This drinks very easy, but I'm not convinced the flavor profile is top-tier- or even at the head of the 2nd-string. It might be sacrilege, but I like some american Quads more than this one. A bit muddled/some confusing flavors keep this one from scoring higher. I liked Westy 12 better, and still can't shake St. Amatus from my mind as the leader of the pack.  Some people say this is one of the best beers in the world. I won't be buying it again, however.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,JesteR14,4.06,"A- I love this look. Very dark amber, with a light head. i know im in store for a lot in this beer... GREAT quad color.  S- malty and a smell of roasted nuts. Some sort of fruit making its entrance..  T- Strong and a first impact of boozyness. The sweetness of the fruit comes out in the aftertaste. I believe that tase is an apple/cider type of taste. A great sipping type of flavor i got out of this beer.  M- Highly carbonated. This makes it an exciting and enjoyable experience for your tongue. Its def a sipping beer, but an undeniable great craft beer.  D- Strong beer, but one that lasts as a quality beer. And to a person like me, these are the type of beers that we savor and enjoy with such a high ABV. Cant drink a 6 pack but it is a great brew to sit back and relax with.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,LairdChisholm,4.87,A - Pours an opaque chestnut brown color with a one finger tan head that has excellent retention and leaves some great lacing.  S - Smells like ripe apple cider. Very very nice and it stays like this throughout the whole drink. There are maybe some notes of sour grapes and slight caramel but this is really good.  T - Follows the nose almost completely. Sour apples and grapes create a great balance. There is some slight caramel notes mixed along with underlying yeast tones. Incredible.  M - Manages to be slight and bubbly at the beginning and sticky at the end so the taste lingers. Amazing.  D - At 10.5 ABV this is still real easy to drink. but something stops you because you want to savor it. Go out and buy this now.,Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Cozzatoad,4.33,"330ml bottle  A- Dark brown, with reddish hints if seen through light. Not big but nicely persistent head. A lot of lacing is left on the glass  S- The aroma is mainly malt, with dark fruit and nut to back up. Not as strong as i expected  T- The beer is overall sweet, with the malts filling the mouth and giving some sort of a buttery feel. Behind the malts there's more sweetness from soft fruits, but a nut like flavour brings some balance and a more complex feel. Suprisingly, the aftertaste is drier with a hint of bitterness to make up for the otherwise excessive sweetness. Very good  M- A creamy and very good mouthfeel that really fills the palate, being smooth at the same time. I don't feel totally right about this though. When still a bit cold the carbonation is high and burns a bit on the palate, preventing flavours from spreading out fully; once warmed carbonation is no longer to be felt but the buttery feel gets too dominant and leaves the tongue covered with a pastry feel  D- Despite some small mouthfeel issues the drinkability is still very good. Alcohol is perfectly hidden and the beer goes down smooth despite its complexity",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,veinless,4.52,"Pours a murky dark brown, with a reddish/maroon tint and a very cloudy body. Head is two fingers and moderately fine, with a nice assortment of bubble sizing. Thick cotton candy center of the head is awesome. Leaves not too much lacing and dissipates to leave a thin layer on top.  Smell is oh so complex, with lemon, cherry, bread, and red winy smell that is intoxicating. Nose is a bit funky in the middle and the yeast is palpable.  Taste hits you with a unique buttery start, which then moves into a medley of fruits and malts. Citrus zest takes a backseat to dark fruit (including some cherries and figs) and belgian yeast, which tastes of coriander. A bit of booze comes in near the end, and the warmth it provides is nothing but beneficial, with no unpleasant alcohol taste at all.  Mouthfeel is truly phenomenal. The texture is perfectly creamy and whipped, the body is as full as it gets, and the combination of the cooling start and warming finish makes this an easy five. Drinkability is great, regardless of the 10.5% abv (which makes this beer that much more admirable). Goes down easy, has every flavor you could ask for without any of them in excess or shortage. I can't get over the fantastic contrast between refreshing and warming in each individual sip. This beer is a work of art. Can get a bit strong on the back end of each sip, but that's just nitpicking. This beer is special.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,BeerBuckeye,4.13,"A - Pours a rich burgandy/mahogany color with a very large head that leaves a ton of thick, creamy lacing.  S - Very nutty smell. Good sweet malt adds to the smell of the grains and yeast.  T - The taste reminds me of a good jar of preserves, some nice dark fruitiness. The malt adds a bit of rich caramel to the overall taste.  M - A light syrupiness to the mouthfeel, alcohol is hidden very, very well. No burn at all actually.  D - Incredibly drinkable. In fact, it may be the best quality of this beer. I really enjoy how easy this is to go down.  Overall - I thought it was just a solid beer. I didn't find it to be spectacular, but I think it captures the essence of the style and is just a remarkably good and drinkable beer. One interesting thing, I found the first few drinks to be a lot better than the rest, it was if the palate ""adjusted"" to the overall complexities of this beer",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Slight spicy taste with a hit of cocoa and more dark fruits. Maybe figs or plums. Also a nice hint of alcohol.  Very full mouthfeel with some chewyness.  Very drinkable for a 10.50% alcohol quad.

It had a beige head with great retention and lots of lacing. The smell was dark fruit, dark malt, and yeast. The taste was dried fruit, yeast,some dark malt and alcohol. The finish was long, dry, a bit fruity, malty, and warming. The mouthfeel was good with a medium-full body and high carbonation. The drinkability was good.

T - Nice buttery flavours of dark fruits and a little hp present. Lots of dark stewed fruit and well balanced sweetness. It's divine really.  M - Medium to full body with perfect carbonation  D - It's not surprising Westvleteren saw fit to give St Bernardus the brewing rights to their beer because this is an absolute treasure that I rate on just blow the West 12 itself.,Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

259,1708,OttoPeeWee,4.62,"I've drank quite a few of these over the years, so I decided to review this Belgian beauty. Fantastic beer, a real original. The smell is light sweet sherry or similar to a well aged scotch with yeast. The taste is sweet and has almost a grape jam quality, in the best way, up front and a dried apricot or raisin finish. Lite hops. Even though the alcohol is very well hidden and is warming, this is a sipping beer.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,xodin,4.28,"Pours a dense, deep oak brown, with some sediment floating around, plenty of head that dissipates readily. Aromas of grains and caramels flow from the carbonation like a thick brewing wort. Every drink assaults the taste buds with chewy caramel, molasses, and ripened fruits, while some spice becomes more evident in the swallow and finish. The carbonation dances off the tongue as it's going down, finishing you off with a warming, slightly dry finish. Exceptional flavor, with complex character that's not matched in many places outside of Belgium. Packs a pretty serious punch, probably best with some food in the stomach and enjoyed on a cold winter's eve--or you could do it like me and have it on an empty stomach when its 80 degrees out :) Still just as good.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Good bready head on first pour with just a shade of off-white. Clingy sattelite lacing with a great halo of retention.  S: Smells of dark burnt caramel and sweet hay.  T: The cocoa flavors were first on my pallete, finished by a buttery sweetness of dried fruits. Mango, dried pineapple on the exhale. Sweet flavored with a medium-bold punch from the hops in the middle. Alcohol level is well masked. A good foray into Big Belgians for people that love stouts.  M: Smooth and creamy. Full bodied beer with a decent dry finish.  D: Sipper, not a chugger, simply from the alcohol. Oh yes, you'll want to chug... be warned. Very warming on a cool night. Would pair nicely with pumpernickel bread, hearty butter and a good cheese like stilton or roquefort.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,heysuz,4.68,"Intro: 11.2 oz. bottle served in a tulip glass  Appearance: Color is deep, rich, opaque, reddish brown that I would characterize as the color of nutmeg. The pour had a thick, dry head that was light tan in color, dissipated slightly, but stayed throughout with thick lacing that clung to the sides of the glass. Generally, I thought the pour looked very appealing and inviting.  Smell: The aroma is rich, layered, and complex, with a host of different ingredients. Initially, I detect dark fruits, caramel, brown sugar, malts, and spice. There's a lot going on with this one and the bouquet continues to develop and becomes even richer and more complex as the pour warms. All of this seems to hide the alcohol rather well.  Taste: Slightly earthy with a certain amount of sweetness that becomes a little stronger as the beer warms. There is a definite alcohol taste but also a fruit and nutmeg spice that adds to the richness of the full body in this beer.  Mouthfeel: Crisp and clean with moderately high carbonation without an aftertaste. Only a very slight oiliness is perceived. The alcohol is present but not overbearing.  Drink: Very smooth and leaves you wanting more. Went down pretty fast for being a rather high ABV. The alcohol is well hidden but the beer should still be a sipper. A dessert beer.  Conclusion: Again, there is a lot going on with this beer. One can tell it is the culmination of years of development. It is a rich, complex beer that needs a couple of sessions to really appreciate the nuances and complexity. I consider this to be in my all-round top 10 list and I always keep an ample supply to break out and enjoy with friends.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

A tiny head of off-white fizzes away quickly, leaving a fat ring behind.  Smells deep. Maple syrup, strawberries, grape juice, cinnamon, raisins. Yum.  The flavor is similar: prunes, figs, grape juice, green tea, cinnamon, maple. Slight tinge of ethanol, maybe even a bit of chocolate. Sweet, complex, delectable.  Moderate and moderately painful carbonation amidst a velvety medium body with an alcohol that burns the tongue lightly. Very slight drying on finish, which increases drinkability tremendously.  Having now tried all three of the big quads, I'd rank St. Bernardus above Rochefort 10 but below Westvleteren 12.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Lots going on in the nose, fruity and sweet, with a hint of alcohol as well. Flavor here is excellent, sweet and malty with fruit notes. Could pick out toffee and bready flavors, as well as apple and grape. Finishes nice and dry. Mouthfeel is very light and highly carbonated, which fits well with the dry finish. Drinkability here could be trouble at over 10% abv as the alcohol is well hidden and the overall balance makes it easy to drink. Can definitely sneak up on you after a couple glasses. Great example of the style, and one I can see picking up regularly.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Some spiciness, but again not too much; more than a little fruity. Very complex flavor without a heavy body. My only significant criticism is that it seems a bit too sweet.  Savored slowly... Although the taste changed a bit with changing temperature, there was no overall sizable change in quality: great chilly, at near room temperature, and everywhere in between.  High ABV mostly hidden.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

There's a lot going on here, but it's hard to pin down any one flavor that sticks out. M - Mouthfeel is full, almost bordering a being syrupy. It's heavy and slightly viscous in the mouth, but not sticky. It does hang onto you a bit after you've swallowed though. D - It's a big beer. High alcohol content, and heavy. It's a beautiful, wonderful beer. But I can't put down more than one or two. The flavor kinda hangs with you, instead of finishing clean like other styles. That's good and bad.

The head rises quickly to the rim of the glass and sits there unmoving. Cloudy and yeasty with warm orange edges as the light tries to shine its way through.  The aromas are many and changing as the beer warms. I smell warm baking bread, dark fruits, spicy cinnamon, and black pepper. Intoxicating.  World-class taste! As with the nose, the flavors change and grow as the beer warms. At first I noticed hops and sweet caramel malts and then the flavors of cherries, raisins, and figs begin to shine through more and more. The beer only gets better as it comes up to temperature.

A - Pours a deep mohogany with a three finger off white head on a pour that wasn't terribly agressive. Was expecting the head to dissipate at fairly quick pace, but it held strong until I finished the pint. Excellent head retention. Lace is a little runny, but definitely still present. Very nice...  S - Figs, plums, brown sugar, various spices, and a hint of citrus hops...  T - Sweet malts up front, followed by figs, brown sugar, raisins and plums. Ends on a very smooth fruity note. This one is super smooth. Abv is exceptionally hidden...  M - Nice and creamy with a moderate amount of carbonation. Really surprised by how smooth this one is. Could probably drink a few of these throughout the day. Won't go as far as calling it a session beer, but if your in the mood to get hammered while drinking world class brew, you can't go wrong here...

Retention is very good, the head takes its time fading away to a thin soapy layer. Lacing is very plentiful, lots of schtick all along the glass.  Smell: Sweet raisins, plums, figs...a general assortment of dark candied fruits. There is a slight boozy quality, but it gives the beer a nice warming quality that is a bit inviting.  Taste: The candied fruit quality reminds me of fruit soaked in booze. The alcohol does stand out, but it is matched with sweet raisins and plums and a classic Belgian quad flavor.  Mouthfeel: Nice medium to full body, but a little too effervescent. I probably could have let this sit longer to let the fizz settle.  Drinkability: This is a great, great quad, definitely one of my favorites. I usually have at least a bottle or two of these in my cellar at all times, it's one of my few staple beers I keep around.

First I taste a tarte plum or grape taste, you get a hint of alcohol, clove, toasted caramel malt and there was a smokey woody aftertaste.

The nose is full of fruit with a light floral scent along with the belgian caramely malts. Flavors include some raisin, toffee and darker fruits. Sweet malts with brown sugar and caramel notes are dominant on the palate. Slight yeast presence along with a slight alcohol finish but not overwhelming, particularly since this is 10% ABV. Fairly high carbonation, perfect for the style, yet strangely full-bodied due to the malts, an excellent mouthfeel. In terms of drinkability, this beer is top notch for a belgian.

It tastes fine but I feel lacks the depth I was expecting. Not much alcohol flavor (which can be good or bad.)  Surprisingly thin, I was expecting a thick, full body. I would call it medium-bodied. Descent level of carbonation.  Overall, it's not a bad beer by any means. Never having tried a quad before, my opinion may not be completely sound but I think this beer is quite overrated.

The head is off-white and about 2-3 fingers. Very nice. Stout-like but brown in appearance. Thick and creamy looking as it pours.  S: Excellent. Very complex array of aromas. Raisin, prune, sweet malt, some unique florals from the yeast. Some faint over-ripe banana.  T: Delicious! Raisin, prune, fig, dark cherry fruit notes are the highlight....but in a balanced way...not overpowering as in some of the Trappists. Also less obvious are some banana and clove notes. Also lots of brown sugar/molasses and breadiness from the malt. Nice balance. Just a hint of alcohol on the finish.  M: Perfect carbonation. Creamy and chewy. Very full bodied.  D: Very high drinkability here. The flavors are perfectly balanced and the alcohol very well hidden at 10% ABV. I finished this one very quickly....much quicker than I should have. Such an easy drinker but you feel the alcohol afterward. Drinking a few of these in tandem could get you in trouble if you don't take your time.  O: Highly recommended. If this is really as close as you can get to a ""Westy 12"", short of the real thing...I get the hype! This is a great tasting, perfectly balanced beer. Not something you might drink on a daily basis....but a great beer to sit down and share or reward yourself with. In my top 10 and my favorite Quad/Trappist/Abbey Ale to date.  Update: This one is truly one of the greats. I picked up a 4-pack of this puppy for $ 19.99 because I can't overstate how much I enjoy it. Only 1 of 2 beers to get my ""Perfect 5"" rating. Truly epic stuff. I could drink this all day long if not for the ABV and the price. One of very few beers that has you smiling and saying ""ahhh!!!"" upon the very first sip.

There is probably some yeast in the bottle so I should review this in full when the bottle is finished.  Aroma of fig, souring grapes, clove, some dark fruit. Taste is phenomenally balanced and delicious, leaving loads of spice on the palate. More taste of very sweet malts, lots of honey, raisins, Belgian yeast....the rest is a mystery. Gets spicier when getting to the bottom of the bottle. This is an instant classic.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Laced the entire way down  S-Intense smell but the bitter characteristics come threw stronger then the the more appealing smells  T-The taste got way, way better once it got warmer. I could taste a clove like flavour, and with raisin and fig. The alcohol flavours come threw strong, which is by design and was much enjoyed.

Aroma smells of Malt, clove, raisin and grape. Smells mildy spicy with some light hops in the end.  Taste is very well balanced. Cloves, dark fruits, sweet malts, spices and a touch of hops. Delicious.  Mouthfeel is pretty amazing too. Well carbonated, very creamy and real smooth.  Overall its way above average.

Scent is malt-heavy with a sweet cola-like quality and notes of dark fruit. Deeply malty flavor with elements of caramel, plum, molasses, honey, black cherry and a hint of wood. Hops creep in nicely for balance. Yeast is apparent but nicely understated. Mouthfeel is full and creamy, right up there with everything else.  What else to say? This is a great beer.

A small layer is permenantly a top the beer.  Smell- Dark fruits, mainly raison. Spicy belgian yeast. Clove. Earthy.  Taste- Yummy, ya I said it. At this stage in the beers life the darker fruits are the main act. More dried raison like than vinous grape; cherry, fig, dates. Some light brown sugar and licorice. The belgian yeast shines at the back end. Adds some spicyness and complexity.  Mouthfeel- Medium to full sided body. Good carbonation, a tad prickly, but smooth overall.  Overall- Quite tasty now, should get even better and more complex with a few years on it, time to throw some in the cellar. At about 10% this is almost too easy to drink!",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Carbonation is quite present, though hard to see given the colour.  S- It is definitely a Belgian! I don't find that I have a particularly refined sense of smell, but there are no particular aromas that stick out. The smell makes clear that this is a fairly complex beer.  T- Needs to warm a little, but once it does, this is a fantastic beer! Brown sugar is present, but it is certainly not overly sweet. I can faintly taste raisin. A slightly bitter aftertaste. It is clear from the taste that this is a strong beer.  M- Very good. This beer is substantial, but not overly heavy.

Surprisingly turbid appearance as there is little dark sediment left in the bottle.  All the expected aromas are there. A bit alcoholic, phenolic, yeast, prune and sweet sugar candy. All done incredibly delicately and balanced. A serious sniffer.  This beer definitely needs to warm up to come out of it's shell. Though again here it is delicate and balanced. The considerable alcohol warms on it's way down. Big sweet malt comes in with unorthodox character. In that it's not chocolate, it's not roast, and it's not your generic crystal sweetness. Much more to it than that. The yeast plays a role with it's influence in creating yet another layer.  Amazingly after a whole bottle I still haven't reviewed this beer as thoroughly as I would like. Also amazingly, I Haven't had a quad in ages, or even a bsda. Certainly I enjoy hops to be more dominant, but these complex Belgians have a lot to be desired.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,CaptainTripps,4.6,"Notes from 12/25/10  Was part of a christmas day beer tasting i called ""Battle of the Quads."" Was compared to the likes of Rochefort 10 and Wesvelteren 12.  Poured into a Duvel Tulip.  A: Very dark brown almost ruby in color, pretty different compared to both Westy 12 and Rochefort 10. Poured a fingers worth of tan head that last for a while, left a good amount of lacing on the side of the glass  S: Like most Quads, Dark fruits really are standing out here. Little heavier on the rasion/cherry side of the dark fruit spectrum though. Brown sugar/belgian yeast is present as well as some alcohol heat.  T: Excellent beer. Dark fruits like raisin's play in harmony with the brown sugar and belgian yeast. Some alcohol warming is there affecting the score, but not over powering. Some bready malts present within the beer.  M: Really good amount of carbonation. Mouthfeel is excellent as well. As the beer warms, the alcohol becomes more warming which is why i am deducting .5 off of the grade.  D: Excellent tasting beer and part of its best quality is its availability. You can get this at any craft beer store and for a reasonable price. So you could kick back many of these but be careful! At 10.5% alcohol this thing will sneak up on you fast!  Very good quad, but just didn't compare to Westy 12 and Rochefort 10.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Smells of plums, nuts, alcohol, and a hint of citrus.  Taste is sugary up front with a mix of dark fruits and nutty flavors mixed in. Alcohol is apparent.  Mouthfeel is full, but not much carbonation. Strange for a BSDA/Quad.

The beer pours winelike in colour, dark ruby and brown, with little galaxies of spotty lacing.  The smell is warm and inviting, rounded and spicy with red apple, strawberry, clove, brown sugar, some aged musty aromas, and hints of root beer.  If the smell invites you in, the taste throws you a party. It's a wallop! And yet a voluptuous and many-layered wallop. Cloves, caramel, red apple, some medicinal notes, very complex malt flavours that range from bright and sugary to almost smoky.  The beer is well-carbonated and light on the palate, effervescent and then turning creamy with a long, slow alcohol creep. ABV is actually well concealed in the creamy mouthfeel, and this one is definitely a slow sipper.

I can't see much carbonation due the darkness of the beer and there is some very nice lacing running in stages down the sides of the glass. The head lasted for over 5 minutes before it began to dissipate.  Smell - malts, cloves, raisins, cherries  Taste & Mouth - The beer has a lot of carbonation and it feels very light and lively yet creamy on the tongue. I can taste cloves and malts mixed with notes of dark fruits such as raisins and cherries. The alcohol is extremely well hidden and it has a great full bodied flavour. It finishes with a sweet dark fruit aftertaste.  Drink - Surely one of the better beers I have ever had. Definitely worth seeking out.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

As soon as you pop the cap, and those early wafting moments wrap around your brain as if a wax-dip of aroma, and the final drips of yeasty dreg-discoloration land gracefully on the spore-like blanket of one's mind... you know you're about to lose your head. (But you don't.)  I could obviously smell on this all night- if I had the self-restraint. Layer after layer of delights wait in this glass, and if I had the nose to peel them apart for you I would, but I hesitate to use the obvious descriptors here (dark fruit, medicinals, merlot), because what stands out most are not the flavors of this beer but THE flavor, the majestic accomplishment that is the balance of Abt. 12.

The smell is very soft and exceptionally smooth. It is pure yeast and sooo bready with very light and subtle sweet malt. The flavor is kind of hard to describe. Let me begin by saying that it is amazing. It's kind of funky and has light spicyness to it. It's very yeasty and full of bready malt. There is a light presence of alcohol but it's every so slight. Wow. This is one of the smoothest beers I've ever had. It tingles the palate initially before melting in your mouth. It's perfect as far as mouthfeel goes. It's also very, very drinkable. The alcohol is well hidden and all aspects of the Abt 12 are well rounded and complex. This is definitely world class. I'm glad I could try this before my Westy 12, which I'm saving.

There's a lot of balance in the flavor, and even a little hop bitterness mixed with a bit of alcohol burn at the finish. This beer is perfect for winter.

Caramel, Belgian yeast, dark fruit flavors pop on the tongue. Also tasting a bit of the alcohol in back, a nice warming feeling during consumption. Both complex and well balanced - just a wonderful tasting beer! Medium bodied, with a nice creamy texture - lighter carbonation helps the mouthfeel.

After a twenty minute warm-up the taste is like overripe damson plums with a hint of sherry and a dry finish reminiscent of cloves and cinnamon. Lots of fruit in the taste--black cherries and dried fruits and figs again with some black mashed banana. As with most Belgian beers, the warmer it gets the better it gets as the alcohol and caramel slowly creep into the picture. I'd leave this out to warm up twice as long the next time.

After awhile, this less-than-appetizing look will clue you in that you are about to enjoy a good-to-great ale. The head is coffee with milk brown and dissipates in less than three minutes. Small bubbles after that.  The goofy monk on the label prevented me from taking this beer seriously for many years. What a shame!  S - Malt. It takes a lot of sniffing to detect any hops in Abt, at least for me.  T - Here's where the rubber meets the road, and what a long, wonderful trip it is! Strong raisin, dark, DARK! fruit and a hint of cacao bean. Absolutely the most enjoyable Belgian I have had. Each sip entices you to take another.

259,1708,SkunkWorks,4.8,"Review is from notes.  On tap at the Orlando World of Beer. Served in a St Bernardus signature glass. I've never had a quad on tap before so this should be an interesting experience.  Look: dark, musty, and bordering on a grayish purple, with a thin, one finger head that is slightly red, slightly beige. There's a bit of lacing but not a whole lot.  Smell: caramel, earthiness, some mild dark fruit, but overall this smells a bit on the light side for a quad. It has all the complexities of a quad without the ""punch you in the face with flavor"" qualities that is signature of other quads... at least for the aroma. Smells quite nice.  Taste: follows the nose. Some bread, caramel, and dark fruit notes stand out. The alcohol is sublimely hidden. Hints of esters from the Belgian yeast pop out also. Its not as densely flavored as other quads are, but its still quite good and quite complex.  Feel: medium tending towards thin, which is quite nice. Lively carbonation lends a crisp character that lightens up as I let it warm. The alcohol is incredibly well hidden. Very nice body.  Drink: this is the most drinkable quad I have yet to drink and so I give this the 5 rating for drinkability. It could be drank in a manner that many drink BMC if you wanted to. I had to be on guard for drinking it too fast so I could savor the flavor, but still found myself drinking this a bit quicker than I should've.  Overall, a marvelous beer. This might be my favorite quad I've had to date, even if it strikes me more as a dubbel with a quad's alcohol content. I am amazed that it was this good on tap and I am surprised I even saw it on tap.

259,1708,Swedes21,4.5,"Served in a chilled glass  Appearance - beer pours a dark auburn, reddish colour. The beer allows some light through, however the center is fairly dark. At the bottom you can see some amount of carbonation, The head is a off-white/light brown colour that is fairly bubbly. There is some nice lacing.  Smell - amazing smelling beer! I can smell some raisins right off the start, then come deep fruit and caramel. The smell is fairly dominant, but the alcohol is well hidden.  Taste - very smooth, almost dry tasting finishing beer. You can taste the raisins and deep fruits upfront with a little finish of the caramel and sweetness. Carbonation levels are nice as well, find this to be a smooth finish.  Mouthfeel - lots of carbonation added brings a strong bitter taste of alcohol to this beer, makes the finish very bitter. I found it to be creamy and full bodied, WOW!  Drinkability - What a fantastic beer, i would rate this beer right up there and great for the LCBO to put this on their shelves. This is a nice full bodied beer that brings your taste buds fwd.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,wrb357,4.2,"I finally tried one of these. I'm still getting a handle on Belgian ales, and this is a pretty hefty style to get into (quad) but I tried it from a 11.2oz bottle into a goblet.  A - Looks really dark, reddish, like cherry juice or something. Had a decent head to it.  S - Smelled like various fruit juices combined with wine, and some figs or something  T - Carbonation was very present. At first it reminded me of a port or sherry because of its bubbly nature and overall fruit flavor, but as time went on it subdued a bit and I could taste all of the flavors. Sort of like chocolate covered bing cherries, or prunes or really thick dark caramel. It was sweet but not overly. Really tasted like a dessert wine, if you ask me.  M - Felt good in the mouth, definitely a sipper (like I said, dessert wine) but I loved the bubbly nature of it after awhile.  D - Went down smoothly and easily, due to its sweetness and light nature, but fruity taste. Would be great to have a couple of these but not for the head - very alcoholic! Perfect thing to bust out for dessert when others are having port or something.  I'd get this again, but it would definitely have to be for a special occasion or something. A nice after-dinner drink to celebrate a promotion or something. I like session beers, but this is a nice treat.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Jmaths,3.83,"Bought a 16.9 oz bottle at Wegman's.  Appearance: Cloudy, Reddish-Mahogany-Brown, pours medium thick pale head.  Smell: Not bad. Was expecting more, based on its rating. Very similar to taste.  Taste: Wheat, Fruit, Sugar, almost a candy-like taste. Slight yeast. Similar taste to Chimay Blue, but not as good in my opinion. Was expecting more. A good beer, just not extremely impressed with it. Rochefort 10 blows this out of the water.  Mouthfeel: Relatively carbonated, not very thick, alcohol is barely noticeable. Somewhat more thin than I was expecting.  Drinkability: Not amazing, but not horrible either. But let's be honest, who cares about drinkability anyway?  This just makes me want Rochefort 10 even more. I yearn for that mind-bending flavor, for that mouth-orgy.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,mkorpal,4.94,"My local beer store opened up their cellar recently. Went in today to find a beer or two to celebrate the BCS National Title game. Found this beer, a 2004 cellared version. The beer is already great fresh, so i can't wait to taste it with some serious age on it.  Beer is opened with a lot of old CO2 escaping. That CO2 has been waiting for a long time. The bottle, which was in great shape, pours into my New Belgium globe glass pretty dark amber, which clears considerably on the edge. Lots of yeast grains floating in the beer. Small off white head with solid lacing.  Smell is strong, very strong. These esters just attack the nose. I love the bombardment of figs and raising and plums, with lots of buttered rum, some bourbon, and freshly baked whole grain bread.  Taste is much more bread, and even more rum and bourbon and sugar, along with a boatload of fruity esters. I'm surprised at the bourbon and rum notes. I know there is nothing in there like that, but I'm picking up quite a bit of oakyness, vanilla, and spicy like esters. Man, it's complex.  The beer feels almost perfect on the tongue. Not too chewy, but still has some weight to it. Nothing dry at all.  Fresh, this beer can have some boozyness to it. It has disappeared with the 6 years of aging. There isn't the slightest hint of alcohol.  Oh god, this is awesome. One of the best 8 bucks I have ever spent. Thank you Liquor Max for providing me this beer.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,dubinsky,4.37,"11.2 oz bottle into a C&B Bruges snifter.  A - Pours hazy and cloudy with some precipitate that i can only assume to be that yeast that we all love so much. Wonderfully dark and brown in color. A one finger off white foamy head was a result of a the pour.  S - Deep aromas of dark fruits, mostly prunes, black cherries, and dates. Some sweet caramel, nuts, black pepper, vanilla and of course some alcohol present. As the beer warms up, it opens up like a fine wine.  T - This is an amazing beer. No wonder its rated in the top ten, and the third most awesome quad. Very sweet, but not cloying. Tons of dark fruits as the smell suggests, with a great warming effect from the 10+% ABV. Tastes a bit like cola, but for grownups.  M - Very carbonated, almost a bit over-carbonated. Very creamy and full bodied.  D - What can i say, its very drinkable to say the least. Its fairly up there in ABV, yet i don't feel like i need to go too slow with this one. What can i say about a beer that has already been beaten to death. Its all true. This is a great beer.

Pours an extremely hazy brown with burnt orange hues and a tan one finger head that fades to a cap with good retention and lacing. Smell is dominated by Belgian yeast, fruity banana and citrus esters, some vanilla, caramel malt sweetness. Taste follows, caramel malts, slightly bready, lots of yeast and a touch of aclohol in the finish. Mouthfeel is medium to light bodied with a heavy active carbonation. There is a strange off flavor/aftertaste that I am not crazy about and the body is kind of thin.

Starts with a spicy and sweet combination of dark fruits (raisin) and candy. Transitions to a warming alcohol with hints of brandy. One of the more interesting beers I've had, period.  M: Thick, buttery mouthfeel. Coats your palate and helps to contribute to the longevity of this beer's flavors.  Notes: This has been one of my favorite beers for years and it never seems to disappoint. This particular bottle had been aging for the last two years which seems to have cut a bit of the carbonation - but this didn't take away much from my enjoyment of the beer.

The fizziness tends to linger, its a bit creamy towards the end.  D: As other reviewers have noted, it is *very* difficult to put the glass down, but somehow you get the impression this is a beer thats meant to be savored first.

Produces a large white head, which hangs around for a little while, and leaves some minimal lacing.  It smells very good, very malty, more like a traditional dark beer than many of the Belgian beers.  Taste is excellent, leaving a warmth as it makes it way down the throat. Fruity flavor.

Leaves just a little lacing.  S: Strong dark fruits, fig, buttered biscuits, sweet bread, alcohol soaked fruit.  T: Very dark earthy robust flavors dominated by the dark fruits. Is pretty sweet in a sweet bread kind of way, a little musty/nutty. Alcohol gives a little bit of a kick behind the carbonation and mellows out until the finish, it actually works quite beautifully. Finish is dry, earthy, and sweet. Everything comes together so harmoniously to create robust, deep, complex flavors while maintaining a level of delicacy.  M: Fairly high carbonation, medium to full body, very smooth and creamy. The higher carbonation than most quads leads to a very creamy mouthfeel, though I would wish the body be a little thicker.  D: I'm torn drinking this. It's so good I can't put the glass down but at the same time this is something that is best savored slowly.

According to ""Brew like a Monk"" by Stan Hieronymus, they claim to brew the same way they did for St Sixtus. I have a Westvleteren 12 from ""Keith"" from Cedar Grove, Fl. I have done a back to back tasting to compare the two and have updated this review below the original on 5/12/2010  05-12-2010 Original review  A dark color, but when held to the light it appears a deep deep red. Thick creamy head, but didn't last long as it settleed down to a nice even layer that was supported by a continuous flow of bubbles from the bottom of the glass. The glass ended with a shot of beer and the remainder of the head, quite nice.  S sweet raisiny smell, no hop odor was noticeable. Very clean.  T high carbonation bite, sweet fruity caramel flavor that sticks to the back corners of my mouth. Reminds me of dark dried fruit, very complex flavors, even, well balanced, no one flavor dominates. Quite nice.  M full body, very nice feel. There is a hint to the alcohol in the warm atertaste, but otherwise its undetectable.  D overall a nice beer. Might be hard to drink more than a few, it's high in alcohol and pretty heavy.  12-28-2010 Review after a Westy12  Abt12, 13 08 14. Tasting with Westvleteren12 and Rochefort 10. 350ml bottle.  A Dark chestnut, thick course head, a nice looking beer. Of the 3 beers Westvleteren12, Abt12 and Rochefort, the Abt12 and Westy are the closest in color. 4.5 same as original review.  S Plums, apricot, and licorice aroma. Fruit is up front, but not as prominent as it is in the Westy. 4.5 lower than original (5.0).  T Fruit is present in the taste as well, but not as much as the westy 12.  Not as clean and a bit rougher compared to the Westy. Overall a very good beer, but for me it comes in a 2nd place. 4.5 same as original review.  M As with the other Belgian big beers, the mouthfeel is thick and substantive. Carbonation is good, in fact better than the Westy. 4.5 same as original review.  D A good beer, but with the high alcohol, you won't be having too many.

T: Quite unique to the style, but again...does a good job of staying within the guidelines (sounds like an oxymoron, I know). I guess what I'm trying to say is that unlike some other Quads I've had the pleasure of trying, Abt 12 comes off less robust...but has a complex quality that others sometimes lack. Tons of dark berry flavors, a touch of sweet sugar and a slight smack of hop bitterness.  M: I feel that this could have used a little more body and less carbonation, but overall...not bad.

Thick body, citrus ""vapor"" in the aftertaste, very smooth and rich, the ABV is very apparent and not for the feint-of-heart, but definitely a great example of a quad.

Rich sweet malts with touches of caramel, raisins, and dark candied fruits (possibly candied prunes).  T: A spicy, alcoholic sensation was readily noticeable upfront which quickly subsided and blossomed into a beautiful bouquet of flavors.

259,1708,bamadog,4.1,"This offering is readily available to us in this area, and I've eyed it up many-a-time and just never committed to picking it up. Finally did so to celebrate the end of another semester's worth of work. Review is from notes taken on 12/19/2010 and poured from the bottle to a tulip.  Appearance: Pour is a dark coppery/ruby color and it starts with the standard big 2+ finger light tan/off-white head that is fluffy and has pretty good retention; head never really seems to fade entirely and lingers down to a full and thick, frothy cap and leaves patches and swaths of lacing, but a lot of slides back into the drink; body is fairly dark, but not opaque and it is a little hazy and murky, and shows a lot of floaties bouncing around throughout the strong carbonation that bubbles up;  Smell: Really what I would look for in a big quad of this caliber -- lots of the big sweet caramel malts with big whiffs of Belgian yeast that brings about some artificial banana-like scents; some dark fruitiness (fig, raisin?) and some acidic apple-like scents as well; bit of a spiced finish -- coriander, cardamom.  Taste: Oh this is nice -- lots of sweet Belgian candi sugar, caramel, but perhaps more like toffee malts and a very sweet and dark fruitiness with a nice blend of the acidic, green apple-like flavors; big Belgian yeast like in the smell; spiciness is played down a little bit, and it seems to compete with some definite warming alcohol  Mouthfeel: Mouthfeel is just lighter than medium, and the carbonation is very full and lively -- not sharp or anything, but very ""frothy"" in the mouth and it definitely leaves the gums tingly (likely aided by the near 11% ABV, though); body is actually a little slick on the way down and it manages to leave a moderately thick and semi-dry sticky coating on the roof of the mouth; the belly is left quite warm from the higher ABV and potent carbonation.  Drinkability: A very nice beer, and I kind of regret not trying it sooner. Looks great, smells and tastes even better -- the ABV is definitely a little big in presence as well as in the flavor set, which lowers the drinkability by a little bit, and I have to wonder if aging a few of these for a few years would be beneficial to it (the bottle claims you can age it up to 15 years, not sure if I could try my patience that far though);",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Deep aromas of dark fruits, yeast, caramel, alcohol, nuts, and even hints of vanilla. It seems like when I stick my nose farther into the glass I get more and more from it.  T - There is a reason why this is considered among one of the top beers in the world. Defintetly getting alot of the fruits here with a nice warming aspect coming from the alcohol. Hints of caramel and the yeast in there too.  M - Full bodied and very creamy. Great amount of carbonation.  D - I will be picking this up in the future for sure.

259,1708,AlCaponeJunior,4.03,"Another of my great box from CaptinRedBeard~!  A deep brown, hazy brew with a great head that lasted and excellent lacing.  You could really smell the fruits, plums and raisins seemed to stand out most. A spicy malt backbone, yeast and alcohol rounded out what is a really nice smelling brew.  Tasted of spices, notably cloves and pepper, a pinch of anise, plenty of sweet molasses and brown sugar, dark fruits, and yeast. The alcohol was not as well masked as some quads and was evident in the flavor.  Mouthfeel was rich, full bodied, slick, with fairly tangy carbonation for a quad and a powerful alcohol warming.  Drinks well but a bit overpowering. A once in a while selection for me.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,ChadQuest,4.05,"Poured into a St Berardus goblet, rather appropiate. :)  Dark brownish and course looking, nearlry permanent cap over the top. Aroma is of peppered malt and spices, along with crispy toasted breads that carry over into the flavors. There is a plethora of dense spice character all over this, so good. there is a strong dark yeast note and toasted/burnt marshmallow. creamy and course at the same time the carbination levels are faint but tightly woven.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,DovaliHops,4.12,"Pours a dark reddish brown color that is almost transparent. Medium off-white head that diminishes rather slowly. Scent is a lot of sweet malts with dark fruits and somewhat of a strong alcohol smell. Very sweet-smelling. This is what is expected from a Belgian quad, and it's quite delightful. Taste is dark fruits with a slight licorice taste. Great Belgian yeast flavors and nice malt flavors. Mouthfeel is a bit more bubbly than I remembered, but feels very nice. Not syrupy at all. Drinkability is fairly high.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,tewaris,3.84,"Described on the label as a Dubbel.  750 ml bottle poured into a big snifter, in stages of course, at little below room temperature. The beer was allowed to warm up in the bottle and in the glass over the course of the review.  Appearance 5/5 Deep garnet colored, moderately clear, with a big murky brown head; excellent head retention and fantastic lacing.  Aroma 3.5/5 Yeasty to the extent that other aromatics get pushed to the background. There is a good amount of toasty-bready malt character, fruit and esters, and malty and alcoholic sweetness but all of these are unfortunately dominated by the strong yeasty smell.  Taste 3.5/5 Aromatic sweet, with all the character from the smell coming in, and some hop bitterness and the tiniest bit of tannins towards the end. The taste is not bad and certainly above average, but it dominated by what I assume was strong yeastiness.  Mouthfeel 5/5 Medium body and medium carbonation: feels right.  Drinkability & Other 4/5 A good beer for sure but the strong presence of a character that's not to my liking surely affects my ratings. Stylistically I don't see the need for this strong yeast flavor. It's hard for me to appreciate why this beer commands the respect it commands or how is it, what some people say, ""practically same"" as Westvleteren 12. I have had the top rated Quadrupels/BSDAs side by side in a tasting that included this beer and I failed to see its charm then, and I fail to see it now. In my opinion it's not close to Westvletern 12 in character and nowhere close to Westvleteren 12 or Rochefort 10 in merit.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Very malty and sweet all around. The ABV is hidden very well here.  Taste: Follows the aroma with caramel, figs, and dark fruit throughout. Some spiced rum and clove notes in here too. Some bready notes in here too. Balanced with a clean, warming finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied and really creamy. Great to sip on.  Drinkability: The ABV is very well hidden and the flavors are balanced and integrated. Definitely something I could sip and savor all night.  Overall, a really nice quad.

Smells of a sweet drink  Taste - Too many flavors to describe! For a minute, a hint of brown-sugar or a maple taste, followed by chocolate. Can also taste the hops but they are a small percentage of taste.  Mouthfeel - Great smooth, medium-bodied beer with every taste and smell on the spectrum. Amazing in how they do this!  Drinkabilty - Wondering why this was the top beer of the month on-tap, I chose it and am glad!

Taste: the ""bros say it the best"" Clove is certain to be the first flavour you taste as it rides the wave of sweetness, big brown sugar flavour with some cake like malty qualities. Some buttery and phenolic flavours shoot to the palate in the middle to make it a bit juicy. Some earth and carob flavours in the mix.

(I say smokey orange peel sour yeasty alcohol flavor)  Mouthfeel: smooth slightly creamy good carbonation.  Drinkability: I could sip it all night but would probably throw up. the curiosity of the flavor leaves you wanting more, but the 10.5 % says hold up..think about what your doing hours from now.

Slightly murky dark brown body.  The aroma is of yeast and fruits. More yeast in the nose here than any beer I can remember - almost like bread dough proofing. Some sweetness and a little maltiness as well.  The taste is super rich and yeasty as well but with lots of malt, port and raisins. Some spiciness comes across as well as a little molasses like sweetness. Some alcohol there but not much.  Slightly viscous, bubbly carbonation and a drying finish - it feels wonderful.  Easy enough to drink but there's enough alcohol in the flavor to remind me that it's over 10%. For the amount of alcohol it's supremely drinkable, though. Every single sip leaves me wanting the next.  [Edit 9/18] The last category was originally Drinkability - at 10+% not this beers strong suit.

Smells of sweet malt, raisin and other dark fruit, caramel, yeast, toasted grains, toffee, syrup or molasses, spices and some light alcohol. The nose is more complex then just those odors, but the rich malty sweetness dominates and smells great.  Tastes sweet and malty, with caramel, nut, yeast, grass, toast, dark fruit like plum or date, raisin, toffee, toasted grains, toffee, syrup and/or molasses, cinnamon, pepper, allspice, herbs and then the sweet malt kicks in again at the end with a roasted taste as the alcohol comes through as warms up the sensation. A really enjoyable brew that's complex and enjoyable with each sip.  Mouthfeel was creamy on the tongue with little to no carbonation, a light watery feel, a medium to heavy body a smooth semi-dry finish.  Extremely tasty beer, which was rich and dark and didn't have the spice or fruit bite to it; the 10% alcohol is very well hidden, but still makes it's presence felt.

259,1708,obywan59,4.65,"12 oz. bottle. 2nd of the St. Bernardus gift pack. Poured into the St. Bernadus oversized wine glass.  Dark mahogany away from the light. Much thicker than the Pater 6 I just finished. Held to the light it yields a lighter mahogany and the aforementioned orange starry sky is apparent only around the edges, Held up to my brightest light it shows a lovely, but deeper red color than the Pater. The lettering on the glass is not visible. Call it translucent.  Smell of clove and Belgian yeast. More citrusy than the Pater. Ripe citrus. Plenty of sweet caramelly malt as well.  Wow! I was ready for a letdown after the Pater 6, butI think this tastes even better. Spiciness up front, (mainly clove), sometimes almost vinuous in the middle, and somewhat bitter in the end. Much more so than the Pater 6. Ssome caramel as well.  Medium thick mouthfeel. Definately thicker than the Pater. Slightly less prickly carbonation.

Lots of brown sugar and some notes of chocolate. Buttery and bread-like notes as well. Fruitiness is there, but not overly so. Alcohol comes at the end adding a medicinal note just as it finishes. Absolutely excellent.  M: Full-bodied with a medium to wet finish despite the alcohol content. Exceptionally smooth from start to finish.  D: I could sip this brew all night.

It has great retention and leaves some nice frothy lace.  The aroma seems fairly subdued with an inviting malty fruity character to it. Cherry, raisin, caramel and some alcoholic heat emanate from the nose. There is a slight tartness in the aroma, some iron like notes and a hint of spice as well.  The flavor is also very fruity, but perhaps a bit more nuances. It has a definite cherry vibe to it, as well as that of raisin and perhaps prune, but cherry is the main fruit character that I get. The spice of the yeast is much more present and is a bit peppery and clovey. There is a nice sort of earthy quality to the caramel flavors that works really well. Surprisingly I am getting no chocolate or roasted malt character; this is pretty much all fruit and caramel goodness. This beer has a pretty good amount of bitterness, and far off in the finish there is a bit of herbal hop character that builds on the tongue. I also detect some alcohol, but far less than I would have expected.  The mouthfeel is medium and very smooth. This beer is well carbonated, but the bubbles have an interesting feel to them, as if they are smaller than usual. I am not sure if this is possible, but that is what my tongue is telling me it feels like. This beer finishes amazingly clean with almost no sweetness and just a touch of bitterness lingering after I swallow.  This is a very drinkable beer and though it shows some of the ABV, it goes down incredibly easily. I gave a sip to me wife, who does not drink beer regularly, and even she thought it was something she could drink. When I told her it was over 10% she was quite surprised.

259,1708,KDeLibero,4.45,"Abt 12... what does that mean? Well, Abt is the strongest beer that a monastery produces in order to honor or please their high priest, known as the Abbot. The number 12 is derived from the Belgian specific gravity reading, which is much like our Alcohol by Volume (ABV) reading of the beer. While Abt 12 is no longer 12% ABV, it still rings in at 10.5%, and remains the strongest beer produced by St. Bernardus. This beer has been produced since the late 19th century, it is a Belgian Quadrupel style ale from St. Bernardus in Watou, Belgium. It is their flagship ale and it doesn't get much better than this!  Abt 12 pours a muddy chestnut color with a big off-white head. The aroma is malty and reminiscent of dark fruit and toffee. It is smooth and creamy on the palate with a big rich flavor of figs, toasted bread, earthy tobacco, and caramel. This is all beautifully balanced by adequate carbonation and a bit of alcohol. Abt 12 truly deserves its reputation as one of the finest beers in the world. It delivers astonishing complexity that is coexistent with great drinkablity.  Not only does Abt 12 have all of the above going for it, but it is fantastic with food as well. On the savory side, try it with grilled sausages, Cassoulet, or Veal Parmigiana. It will go great with your favorite chocolate desserts too, or a fine cigar. On the other hand, this beer is so great on it's own that you may just want to enjoy it with something simple like fresh bread and Brie de Meaux.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

This beer pours a dark muddy brown colour, with some violently eddying sediment, a slight reddish tint, and two broad fingers of fine foamy pale beige head, which leaves some solid streaks of roaming lace around the glass as it duly recedes.  It smells of mildly sweet caramel malt, dark distinct fruit, a soft yeastiness, and alcohol-soaked demerara sugar. The taste is sweet, dark sugary caramel/toffee malt, a bit of raw cocoa, some ethereal spicing, and subtle, but well balancing earthy, leafy hops. Little to no booze warming, quelle surprise.  The carbonation is there, but quite sedate, the body medium-full in weight, smooth, and clean. It finishes off-dry, but only minimally so - the malt is present and accounted for, but well tempered by an unobtrusive dryness.

The scuttlebut is that the ABT 12 may be a viable and more easily acquired alternative for Westy 12. We'll see...  Poured from a 750 bottle, deploys as a dark, cloudy root-beer, iced tea color with a quickly dissipating foam made of tiny bubbles. Head lingers when poured right (takes me three times) and stays creamy.  Smell is very Earthy and Belgian-y. but, as with some of the similar Trappists, mild. I don't picture the monks really giving a crap about aromatic hops, but who knows.  Taste is excellent. As it warms, the fruits come through - dark plum, maybe some tropicals - the aftertaste is cocoa and molasses.  Doesn't have the majesty, complexity or mystery of Westy 12, and really - it's unfair and stupid to compare beers to other beers, unless that's what they brewer intended.

Lots of carbonation bubbles released throughout  Very malty notes on the nose: raisin, figs, & brown sugar. Grassy lemon and hops on the back end with a faint smell of alcohol mixed in.  Starts with candied sugar ( reminds me of sweet potato casserole I had today for Thanksgiving), dates, cloves,& bananas. As it warms, bitter hops and sour candy become more prevalent. Very light alcohol on the throat.  Medium body with ample carbonation.  I have never tasted a 10% beer this drinkable. Very well balance and smooth. one of my favorite quads.

S: Sweet toffee is the primary aroma, but with a lot of complexity laying beneath. There's some dark fruit, some spiciness I assume is from the yeast, and a little alcohol to round it out.  T: This is what Belgian beer is all about. Delicious enough for everyone to enjoy, but complex enough that you could go through dozens of bottles and still find something new. There's dark, caramel, sugary malt. There's some dark fruit. There's a good deal of spice. There's a bit of alcohol. I'm sure there's plenty that I can't discern. This is a big boy beer for sure.

Notice a nice, orange hue when there's light in the background. Also present is this great, 2-finger tan head with good retention. Results in a droopy, sticky lacing that doesn't go away. Good looking stuff.  S - Sweet maltiness with that Belgian yeast I love so much. Great mixture of dark fruits and a bit of spice. Nice fragrance... Not mind-blowing, but nice.  T - Okay, a little more mind-blowing. It's complex and subtle at the same time. Mixture of spice, hint of chocolate, and a great presence of dark fruits. Just fantastic, really.  M - This might sound weird, but it just dissolved when it hit my tongue. The carbonation combined with the body made it feel like something falling apart in my mouth. I've never gotten this from a beer before; however, I love it. There's a pleasant, warming hint of alcohol at the finish. My oh my.  D - Pricey, and alcoholic, but whatever bottle you do have will scream, ""Drink me! Drink me!"" until you pass out in a drunk stupor.  Overall/notes - Pretty much exactly how I remember it. Really great beer. Actually, not quite the monster I remember, as for a long time, I called it my favorite. Still, I'm no going to complain at all.

The beer is a murky red/brown with one finger tan head that sticks around. The nose is full of dark ripe fruit, toasted caramel and a brilliant sweetness. Something about it screams dry red wine to me (maybe it's the fruit). The flavor is fantastic! Cloves hit your right up front and then there are dark cherries, red grapes, and a moderate alcohol presence. The body is moderate with solid carbonation.  This is definitely a world class beer. Rich fruits mixed with spices, slight alcohol burn and then a sharp dry finish. I love this beer! Probably the best Quad that I have had to date.

As the head receded it left thick foamy residue (not quite dainty enough to call it lace). Strong, rich malty/yeasty aroma, with elements of dark fruit, toffee, and clove.  Flavor matched the aroma well. The spicy, clove-infused yeast taste was the first element to jump out at me. The flavor is very complex; it's hard to distill all the elements; there's a certain bready maltiness to it; sweet sugar, a pleasantly warming alcohol component.  It was smooth, medium bodied with good amount of carbonation and finished dry. I really enjoyed this beer.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Aromas quite similar to what I remember with lots of yeast aromas, clove, spice; dark fruits emerge as it warms. Tastes like the fresher bottle only more integrated and less in your face if that makes sense. The slight alcohol heat that was present in the fresh bottle is completely absent in this aged version. Same dry, raisiny finish as the original. Def a winner and the epitome of excellence for Belgian beers and Quads in general.  Aromas are sweet caramels, dark fruits (raisin, grape and plum), Belgian spiciness, clove, fine Belgian dark ""chocolate"" smells probably from some dark candy sugar additions and some slight alcohol. Amazingly complex and balanced. The taste is moderately sweet up front; the sweetness of a rum-drenched dark banana bread loaf. It is a little spicy, though perhaps not as clove-heavy as some of the other Belgians. Alcohol, while by no means overbearing, isn't afraid to poke its nose in at mid-palate and let you know it's there. Dry-ish finish with a raisiny aftertaste. The mouthfeel is rich and smooth, warming the throat. A light effervescence all over the tongue, as well. Medium-full bodied. Overall this is an absolute winner and by far one of the 5 best Belgian beers on the planet. Few, if any better in the style.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

A rush of toffee sweetness, biscuit, and dark fruit followed by vanilla, spice, and raisin.  Full-flavored, balanced, and completely easy-drinking.

259,1708,stakem,4.05,"On tap at Al's served in a snifter. Pours a murky color of dark puddle water brown. The head appears as a tan film across the top that doesn't last long. Spots of lace cling to the glass. Once the beer warms, it it gains some retention power when the glass is swirled.  The aroma is a mixture of dark sugary sweetness mixed with belgian yeast character like clove. The sugary sweetness of the aroma seems slightly fruity suggesting plums and a touch of chocolate malt before returning to the spiciness of the belgian yeast character. As it warms, it really picks up a young ""green"" yeast quality that is acceptable but not really all that appealing.  The taste includes the belgian yeast characteristics upfront tasting spicy and quite a bit clove-like. A solid layering of seemingly numbing alcohol is present with both a solvent flavor and warming factor. There is a mild amount of fruity flavor tasting like pear skins that never gets too sweet as it is kept in check by both the alcohol and a bit of hop bitterness that is quite earthy. The major player throughout this experience is the spice of the yeast and it finishes quite dry for how fruity sweet you might think this is based off of the nose.  This is a full bodied offering that is lightly carbonated. Easy drinking for how big the abv is but my guess is this particular offering is quite young considering the young yeasty quality that is quite bold in this brew. For all the praise and glory this beer gets I was not that big of a fan and prefer Rochefort 10 by a wide margin compared to this.

App- Poured a myriad of browns into the glass, it was a kalediscope of browns in there. I got at least for different shades. Almost no head on it but great lacing and a wonderful swirl pattern.  Smell- It smelled strong and I don't normally say that about beer. It was earthy and robust, malty with some fruit.  Taste- The taste of the beer is rich and complex like that of a mild red wine. It had a strong alcohol taste but the grape like tannic qualities would mix with a bready quality to a candied sugar taste. Very complex indeed.  Mouth- Slight dry that keeps the palate engaged for the next sip. It was clean, not muddled. Flavors know where they want to go and where you should follow. Has the right amount of flavor in the drink. Doesn't overpower you though for 10%.  Drink- It's a bit heavy for a session beer, but I liked it. I can see why for this Quad to be as highly rated as it was. For me it was the younger brother to a SA Utopias. It had the same qualities.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Poured into a Delirium Tremens tulip and built a nice, creamy 3 fingered head that stuck around for the majority of the beer. Pours a very dark brown with copper edges, muddy with some sediment and completely opaque. Not very much lacing which I was a bit surprised about.  S - Smell is definitely boozy at first. Behind the alcohol you get some really nice, sweet, dark fruits, figs, some sweet malts, and grapes. A nice mix between the alcohol and fruit.  T - Taste follows the nose for the most part. Get some hot alcohol at first and then tannic grape. Reminds me of a complex wine. Can really taste the Belgian sugar and candied fruits. Keep getting a range of different flavors from the malty breadiness to the dark fruit back to alcohol. A relatively dry finish that really helps keep the palate refreshed.  M - Mouthfeel is medium to heavy bodied and has a good amount of carbonation to keep things interesting.  D - Drinkability is pretty moderate. The flavors are quite complex and enjoyable, but the hotness and tannins detract a bit. Drank over about a span of 40 minutes and it was interesting to see how the complexion changed as it warmed up.

Overall it goes down much smoother than anticipated, there are dark fruits inter-mingling with bready malts and caramel. The finish is mildly tart, which helps to cut through the sweetness and and leaves a mild fruity/yeasty flavor on the tongue. After re-reading this description it sounds a bit to plain, this beer is much more complex but the subtleties are hard to place.  Mouthfeel is thick, but not as much as I'd expected, it's quite pleasant and the flavors coat the mouth well. Below average carbonation.  Overall this beer is as I said, smooth, rich and malty.

Buttermilk colored head sits about about 1.5 fingers before wisping away after two minutes to almost nothing. The only lacing left was at the top rim of the glass; haven't seen that before. Nice looking Quad all-in-all, with points credited because this is on-tap.  Abt. 12 smells like a typical good Quad smells. Nothing surprising, just marvelously executed dark fruits and sweet pastry malts and some brewing spices and a dash of herbaceousness. The plums and brown sugar are stronger here than in the bottled versions I've had. The aroma is... smoother, I guess you could say.  Plum, fig, date, pear, appleskin, preserved orange - all drizzled with port and rum. Breadcrusts and sugar. A bit of umami that sort of tastes like mushrooms meets old coffee grounds. Clove. The malt takes on new depth. Cinammon rolls and walnut logs and fruitcake. Again, the nutty malt and the plum are stronger here than in the bottled version. This is less vinous and decidedly smoother, earthier, than the in the bottle. It works though. Still good, but perhaps less special.  A nice, hefty body on this beer; more viscous than in the bottle (less dry too, not that the original was lacking in sweetness). It feels luxurious though, never too heavy. Carbonation provides an initial prickle but it quickly yields to a sense of smoothness. Nice coating effect. The drinkability is kind of insane. I drank the whole glass without feeling anything, and the added creaminess to the body and smoothness to the flavor makes for one of the most drinkable Quad experiences I've ever had.  The Alcove charged an arm and a leg for a glass of Abt. 12 on-tap, and I suppose that it was mostly worth it. Excellent Quadrupel with enough differences from the bottled version to warrant a purchase. I'm glad to have this in Tuscaloosa, that's for sure.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

259,1708,Patrick999,4.43,"Have had on several occasions, but inexplicably, never reviewed. I don't know why, so I'm now going to give it proper live review treatment. Poured from one of the small bottles into a St. Bernardus goblet that looks like an oversized wine glass. Muddy brown dubbel/quad appearance with excellent foam retention. I'll give it a little time to warm up - on this 88 degree October day, it shouldn't take too long.  It smells like an enormous malt bomb, massive aromatic slabs of deep caramel, overripe plantain and rum raisin. Malt for miles and miles.  While it smells very sweet, the taste has more going on than just pure sweet malt. It is moderately sweet up front, which is entirely appropriate, the sweetness of a rum-drenched dark banana bread. It is a little spicy, though perhaps not as clove-heavy as some of the other Belgians. Alcohol, while by no means overbearing, isn't afraid to poke its nose in at mid-palate and let you know it's there. Dry-ish finish with a raisin aftertaste.  While this is a full-bodied beer to say the least, it achieves the heavenly cloud-like Belgian mouthfeel like few others of this strength not named Rochefort 10 or Westy 12.  In fact, I think this can stand with the above as one of the finest quads available. Personally, I am not in the mood for quads very often, but when I am this is easily a go-to.  This is one of those beers that is ""Required Reading"" for any BA. Here's a prime example of one of the world's great beers just sitting on your liquor store's shelf at an affordable-luxury price. Go pick one up today. Better yet, pick up the St. Bernies gift pack with bottles of the 6, 8, 12 and Tripel *and* this sweet balloon goblet - really a kick-ass glass. Money well spent.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,ramseye4,4.67,"Earlier this year, I had originally ordered a St. Andrew's by Belhaven at Capital Ale house and out they brought St. Bernardus on accident. I said screw it and tried it out. I had been sort of tinkering with craft beer, Sierra Nevada Pale ale had started by cracking the door for me. And St. Bernardus ABT 12 strapped a demo charge to it and blew the door wide open. Several months later, I finally am getting around to doing a proper review.  Poured into a Red Hook tulip, it displays a massive head that retains all the way through the tasting. It is a beautiful looking beer, a reddish brown color that looks just wonderful, especially with the head. The smell is incredibly complex, and a tad hard to describe. I would say it has dark fruits, figs, and a bit of berries, with some alcohol and clove. The taste is sublime, with raisins, grapes, roasted darkish malts and a pleasing alcoholic sensation washing around in the mouth and continuing all the way to the stomach. Man is this good. The mouthfeel is sticky, and definitely full bodied, with a good amount of carbonation. This beer is a flat out awesome. Surprisingly it is relatively easy to find where I live, and is even on tap at Cap Ale. I definitely recommend this.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,BillHilly,4.82,"Appearance: Pours a dark chocolate hue, nice lacing, very enticing.  Smell: The malt smell leads, with a nice sweet fruity finishing note.  Taste: Light molasses in the front with a sweet malty finish and caramel highlights. Simply fantastic.  Mouthfeel: Very creamy with a balanced carbonation. Seems subtle yet pronounced at the same time - very complex.  Drinkability: Amazingly complex, yet so easily consumed for a 10.5% ABV. A marvelous Quad and well worth the price.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,yapi,4.47,"L: I somehow find it more difficult to pour this one than a westy 12 or a rochefort 10. Never seem to get a good head on this one.  S: dark fruits, spices, alcohol, nice! Love these quads...  T: dark fruits, bubblegum, medium sweet, more white then brown sugar  O: this is a very good change of pace when you love the westy 12 or the roch 10 (I can't help to compare). However, the latter 2 have my preference. Not as complex as the westy and not that caramel, dark brown sugar & port-like finish taste I love about the roch. But all in all a very enjoyable quad",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Spices, Fruit, Alcohol  High carbonation, slightly course feeling, maybe spices and yeast floating.  Very drinkable, the 10.5 percent seems more like 7, very tasty. A very good quad, very very good for the style.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,r0nyn,4.08,"Poured from a bottle into my DFH snifter.  Pours a chocolate brown hue that fills the glass with big, dark opacity. Tan head settles into a quarter-inch cap and leaves some serious sticky lacing. Really very enticing. Smell is full of dark fruits and esters, along with a ton of maltiness. As it warms, the alcohol is just slightly detectable at the end.  Taste has that bready malt kick to start things on a good note and gradually gives way to the sweet dark fruits and a bit of clove and spice. There's a roastedness that permeates the flavors, giving it an interesting balance and something of an earthy, woody feel. Towards the end is the mildest of hop bittering that lingers on the back of the tongue somewhat. The booziness shows up at the end as well, especially as the brew warms. Expected, and it manages to blend with the other complex tastes well enough to be pleasant. Mouthfeel is nice and creamy, with a minimal amount of carbonation. Slight chewiness as well.  Drinkability is quite good, even though you'll definitely need to sip this over time to really get the full experience. This is a full-bodied Belgian brew with a complex taste and should be savored as befitting one of the best beers on the planet. I would actually place this just below the Rochefort 10, but that is by no means a negative mark on this exceptional beer. I'll definitely have to have this again with a bit of age on it.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,NODAK,4.53,"Aroma here is definitely malty with dark fruit and sweet, but I find there's a distinct liquorice smell in there as well. Also some alcohol.  Pours a medium shade of brown in the glass with a rather large head.  Definitely some molasses, caramel and dark fruit from the onset of the beer. There's also a slight spiciness sitting in the background. Some yeast is perceptible as well, but it's fleeting and not very ""center stage"". In fact, not all sips even projected a yeastiness to me. Carbonation is surprisingly high for style. There's some brown sugar on the back end of the beer, but what strikes me about this beer is just how smooth it is. Many times, the sweetness and/or roasted qualities of a beer this thick and high in ABV can be astringent on the back and cause some grimacing. Here, it's a bit thinner and comes across as more of a caramelized sugary sweetness that finishes the beer out. The alcohol isn't even noticeable to me. This makes the drinkability higher to me, and makes it even more dangerous.  This is another winner from Saint Bernardus....I can see why this beer is routinely mentioned among the best there is. Scarily drinkable.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,cleolicious,4.08,"Pours a cloudy reddish brown. Three finger head.  Clove aroma. You can smell the alcohol.  Cloves, butter, fruits alcohol. That's the best way I can describe it. I understand this is a quad so of course the alcohol is strong. You can taste it but it seems to be masked in sugars. Smooth with an easy carbonation. It's like Rochefort 10 but more aggressive.  Drinkable but I would have only one, maybe two glasses of this, not because it's a ABV of 10.50% but because it's so present in the taste. Due to personal taste I wouldn't say I'm in love with this beer, however, I respect it because I know that anyone who loves quads is going to want to marry it.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,BBP,4.8,"A- Pours a thick faded chestnut brown with a formidable head, and a barrage of tiny bubbles from the massive amount of carbonation. Little bits of yeast float through the brew.  S- Incredibly elaborate, but very hard to break down. Sweetness from the beginning. Definite malts, and a bit like tea. Hard to discern what fruits are in it.  T- Quite sweet from the beginning with only a small amount of bitterness from hops and yeast. Tons of fruitiness. Raisins, pears, prunes, figs, and I'm sure I missed a few. This is bliss.  M- Pretty full bodied, and very creamy. Carbonation is superb. Feels light and heavy at the same time.  D- Scary how drinkable this one is for 10%. I'd be drinking it faster for sure if not for the price, how hard it is for me to acquire, and how I'd be on the floor in no time.  I'd if these were inexpensive and I could give them to my friends.

It pours a dark, deep brown color with a dark tan colored head. The aromas from the nose are dominantly malty and sweet. Dark, dried fruits mix with roasted malts to create a complex and enticing aroma.  Sweet malt flavors are most apparent on the palate. Same roasted malts from the nose are detected on the tongue. Fruits such as raisins, prunes and plums are present in the center.  The body is smooth, creamy, and rich. Really quite delicious and one to enjoy.

T: wow, nutty and fruity. Hazel nuts with pomegranite and lemon. Somewhat earthy and soapy. Not dissing it on the soapy, thats just the best way i can describe it.

Taste: Clove spice right up front followed by sweetness, banana, biscuits, dried dark fruits - plums, dates and raisins. Layers of flavor. Malt and alcohol really tie the whole experience together.

Big fluffy tan head that has excellent retention and leaves plenty of lacey rings around the glass. Great looking beer.  S - The requisite notes for a quad -- raisins, figs, dates, all the dark fruits. The yeast provides a biscuity aroma, and a little alcohol backs everything up, maybe a little more than I'd like.  T - Well, I haven't had Westy 12 yet, but if I had to hold up one beer as a standard-bearer for the style, this would be it. Dark fruit, caramelized sugar, and that biscuity yeast. The alcohol just lurks in the background and fills in all the gaps. There are so many layers to the flavor -- sometimes you get Belgian sugar, sometimes a pancake-like biscuit, sometimes the fruit. Vanilla is in there somewhere, almost like is sat in some barrels at some point. Just fantastic.  M - This is where is differs significantly from beers like the Rocheforts -- where they can be a bit harsh, this is very smooth, almost silky. Carbonation is soft and inviting.  D - The flavor makes me want more more more, but the abv makes me say wow, I'll be asleep if I have one more.  O - For me, this is the benchmark for the style.

S: Very bready, yeasty aroma dominates, but underneath there is a sweet malt smell with some deep fruits (maybe dates?), also alcohol. A really strong, pleasant aroma.  T: Spices, yeast, malts and alcohol. I'm not surprised to see that it's 10% alcohol because it comes through. The flavor's really strong but really well balanced. I don't know that any flavor dominates, but the alcohol cuts through all of it, which is a nice addition.  M: A little bit syrup-py, not great. Makes it really heavy to drink, and I think that the pint bottle might be a bit much for one person.  D: Definitely drinkable, though the mouthfeel is, for me, really heavy and thick.

A-Pours a hazy mahogany-amber hue with a three finger, beige head with good retention and ample lacing.  S-Fruity, malty, sweet, and sour (in a pleasant way - from the yeast I suspect). Nice aroma is dominated by dark dried fruits like raisins, figs, date, and caramel malts. Fruitier than sweet.  T-Prominent flavors include brown sugar, black cherries, rum-soaked raisins, and toasted toffee malts. Best enjoyed by sipping and rolling this around the tongue and mouth before swallowing. All of this leads to a long-lived spicy, cloves finish. Taste is also fruitier than sweet. This is very good. Taste improves as it warms.  M-Very smooth for 10% ABV. Carbonation level is spot on.

S: The aroma is chock-full o' sticky sweet malts and juicy ripe mouth staining fruit with a wonderful golden raisin note.  T: Initially a rush of brown sugar, melted butter and slightly tart dark cherry hits the palate. It evens out into the sweet malts and dark fruitiness that one comes to expect in a quad. At 10.50% the alcohol is definitely apparent but in a pleasant warming way that bolsters the flavor of the ale. Finishes with, do I dare say it again, a sweet dry complexion with whispers of clove and raisin making you craving more and more.

Yellowish-brown is the closest thing I can think of to describe the color. You can almost peek a sneak through. Topped with a crisp white head.  Bananas? I must be crazy, though is the way the malts come off to me. Sweet, malty goodness. Overripe bananas, clove, slight tinge of alcohol, deeply inviting. You can smell it across the room as it invites you a tango meant for two. You devilish beast you...  Again with the bananas! Anyways, smooth malty flavors, banana's, candied walnuts, figs, allspice and nutmeg. Intriguing, as the complexity only increases as it warms. alcohol is definitely present, but that is permissible as the spicy notes are melded into the alcohol notes. All in all an incredibly drinkalbe brew.  As widely available as this beer is, it is hard to believe it is still this dang good. A strong carbonation, smooth on the tongue, and a fun to drink.

This beer is a lot lighter in color than the other two Quads we have had.  S: Not really much going on even as it warmed. If anything, I thought it smelled slightly of some sort of chemical, but I could not place it. I expected much more yeast aroma, but it never showed.  T: Bland. Not really anything to report. It was not bad, it just was a very bland tasting beer with a slight sharpness to it.  M: Wonderful balance of body and carbonation the whole glass. I suspect that most people might expect a slightly thicker body on a Quad, but I am not an expert, so I will say that for me it felt fine.

259,1708,Kinsman,4.42,"So what is this beer? The brewery says its a dubbel, its listed as a quad on this site, and I say its delicious.  Pours a deep and dark chestnut brownish red body with the slightest bit of light being able to make its way through. A massive ecru-colored head, foamy and dense, sits on top like the Kings crown.  Aroma is noticeably sweet at first, as I could smell raisins and grapes before I even put my nose up to the glass. However, as the beer opens up, the fruitiness fades, bringing out more of a spice note and a toasted malt presence.  With a nice big sip, the taste greets your palate with dark fruits and a bit of malt. But with subsequently smaller sips comes more of a spice note, most notably being cloves. The alcohol comes out more as the beer warms, giving it more of a cough syrup type flavor without the harshness that comes with the syrup.  Mouthfeel is much lighter than expected for a 10.5 abv beer, and the carbonation levels gave it a rather bubbly feel compared to other quads. Still it came across as very smooth and warming on a cool early autumn evening.  Overall, this beer is simply world-class. It doesn't receive a lot of hype, but judging by its rank on the Top 100 (currently 10), it's no secret that this is a great beer.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Apolloster2,4.65,"This is my first review on BA so I wanted to start off with a great beer, and to be honest, this is one of the best beers I have ever tried. One of the best features I noticed right off the bat is the amazing carbonation. Between that, and the robust flavor it packs in, it really is party for the mouth. For a 10.5% abv beer, it really hides the alcohol well. Great buzz.  Just a fantastic beer - I usually am more of an IPA guy and don't go for Belgians often. But this one you just have to try.  Serving: 25 oz, Corked, caged bottle.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Vaison,4.16,"Poured from a 11.2oz bottle into a Maudite tulip.  1 finger of light amber head and excellent lacing. The color is a dark brown, nearly identical to the color of most brown beer bottles. I really didn't get a good aroma, it seemed pretty bland and it smelled mostly of alcohol I thought. It tasted of dried fruits and a malty finish. ABV is hidden well and carbonation was high but not too much. For a 10.5, this was very easy to drink and went down smoothly.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Sweet and malty w/ slight fruity overtones just to the point of hiding the high alcohol content but not so much as to overpower the beer. They even did a good job on the labeling. I love the image of the happy drunk monk.

Tastes of dried dark fruits (raisins and plums maybe?) with a creamy aftertaste. It may have tasted even better as it approached room temperature! M: Medium-full body. Just enough carbonation. Very smooth. D: The 10.50% ABV is well-hidden. Although I prefer to sip on this beer as to enjoy it for longer, one could easily drink a few of these in a night.  This continues to be one of my favorite beers and I seem to enjoy it more each time. A job well done, Belgian monks!",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

The first thing I get is a nice malt smell. a little raisins smell to it as well. not as good as Rochefort 10 smells.  T.  Taste is of sweet malts. a very slight dark fruit taste. a slight bite of alcohol towards the end.  M.  medium to full bodied beer. a good amount of carbonation. a nice little tingle on the tongue from the carbonation and alcohol  D.  very good drinkability. could easily down a large bottle of this stuff, even with the high alcohol content.

259,1708,haazer,4.41,"Reviewing this from my notes on 8/25, poured into my tulip glass.  A- Very big, slightly offwhite head. Takes a long time to settle and leaves plenty of lacing all down the sides of the glass. Beer appears as a chestnut color, or a dark brewed iced tea.  S- Smells like lots of quads do, fruity, tingling alcohol in the nostrils, and hints of raisins.  T- A good bit of what it smells like, but more complex. The fruit aspect is there as I taste berries at first. Then it transitions to apple, raisins, and then the last taste is bananas. At the same time it has the bread and yeasty feel to it. The alcohol warms as the taste leaves when the beer goes down. It's almost as if this would be the equivalent to a beer fruit punch. Delicious.  M- Incredibly smooth, and very warming with the alcohol. As above in the taste description it has the bready feel, and also chewy. This beer invites you to swirl it around in your mouth to hit every taste bud. Deffinitely savour this one.  D- Maybe its just me but Quads like this one are too damn appealing. So much taste and flavor, such a good mouthfeel for such a high abv. I have to give it a 4.5 because if you drink two of these you'll get a buzz.  Notes: I've been dying to try this one, and held off till my birthday to open it. What a treat! I happened to try 5 diff beers in all that day, this one came in 2nd, a close 2nd though. I tried this with a piece of birthday cake and it went perfectly with that. IMO a dessert beer for sure.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Smells of roasted malt and you can pick up the higher ABV on the nose. Tastes great, huge and malty, with a minute alcohol burn.  Drinkability does not suffer at all with the big ABV.  I would recommend this to anyone.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

A- three big fingers of fluffy tan head from a hard pour that settles slowly to bunch of sticky lace and a floating raft of soapy suds on top. Deep chestnut brown in color with burnt orange glow at the edges when held to the light.  S- spiced fruit cake and yeasty dark bread. Sweet malts and brown sugar. Some booze and a lite must.  T- rich sweet malts with light brown sugar and some dark breads. Cloves and cinnamon with some orange peel and plums. There is some fusal alcohol that kicks the spice down a bit and brings out some more sweetness.  M- luscious mouthfeel with a fuller body and carb that work well with each other. Some significant heat and belly warming for this brew.  D- great quad, truly a stand out for the style. The fact that its so easy to find and cheap just makes me even happier. Doesn't make the beer any better but I get to drink it more often.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

259,1708,lifeboyq,5,"11.2 oz bottle poured into a St Bernardus chalice. Dark mahogany, not fined beer with deep chestnut tones. Monster cream head typical of the strong carbonation in Belgian offerings. Smell is of caramel malts, unrefined sugar and that all too familiar peculiarity of a belgian yeast phenols with bready overtones. The beer tastes like figs and dates and caramel and toffee, bready, sweet and again that all too hard to put your finger on delicious belgian pecularity. Incredibly complex, incredibly deep that improves as it warms. One of the top few beers of the world. Most closely resembles the Westy of any other offering. Absolutely amazing. In my eyes, as close to perfection in a beer as you can get. This is so good it hurts. Lip smacking good. One of the finest examples of the most complex tasting beer class, Belgian Quads.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Agold,4.75,"This beer is a very dark garnet with about an inch of white fluffy head which recedes to about a quarter inch. It smells amazing, with notes of spice, figs, and sweetness. It tastes amazing as well, with a taste which mirrors the nose, adding a little bit of yeast bite and some caramel. These flavors mostly, if not completely mask the high abv. The higher carbonation gives it a deceivingly light mouthfeel, but as it warms and the carbonation dissipates, it becomes thicker. Most drinkble quad i have ever had. Amazing. It seems like it would hold up well with age, and I would love to see how it changes with a year on it.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

S - Caramelly malts and banana esters. A lot of dark fruits reminiscent of prunes and raisins. No hop aromas detected. Alcohol is subtle and perfumy.  F/M - Deep malty goodness and esters mix into a fruitcake-like aroma of deep, dark stone fruits and dried dark fruits. Hop bitterness is light, but enough to allow a clean finish. Aftertaste of dark fruits and bready malts. Alcoholic warmth as it moves down into my tummy.  D - Excellent. This is the best-drinking BSD/Quad around.

259,1708,alkemy,4.44,"The pour is a caramel/amber color with a very slight head. Perhaps using caramel as a color descriptor is a product of the smell, which is rich in caramel and dried dark fruits. The figs and raisins really show themselves in the taste along with vanilla and again a touch of caramel. It's really malty and sweet. I was hoping for a hint of banana or some bubblegum, but it was not readily apparent. Felt really nice with some decent viscosity.

Drank while baking Coca-cola cupcakes.  Muddy diarhea colored light brown. Large, bubbly tan head exhausts itself down to a decent bubbly tophat and remains that way for the duration of the beer.  Aroma is, to quote Black Rob, ""like whoa."" Earthy dark fruit, pumpernickel bread crust, steely caramel, molasses. I can smell figs and grapes but it's also like a can smell the dirt they were grown in, the sun and the water that fed them.  Taste is again earthy dark fruit. Chocolate covered black cherry, bread crust and burn toffee. Taste lingers warms and loves. My palette is not worthy. Snappy carbonation. I never would have thought something so complex with such a high abv would be at the same time so accessible and demand sip after sip.  My girlfriend has got me hooked on the show Trueblood and in it 2 people get high on vampire blood and dance around, feel one with nature, themselves, and the world.

Taste is even better than the aromas in a solid batch of Belgian goodness that will knock the socks off of any beer lover(or non-beer lover for that matter).

259,1708,kiddynamite920,4.32,"Corked and caged 750 ml bottle.  A: Huge head sprung up immediately after the pour, a bit off white. Resting underneath is a dark red/brown beer, which is nearly opaque. Some highlights of copper when held up to the light. The head on this beer is quite impressive and lasting.  S: Cork smells of raisins and figs. Hit right off the bat with Belgian yeast with some banana. There is also an initial booziness. Can't get over the yeast character here, not usually a fan of the banana/bubblegum aromas but this one is very well balanced against the other characters in the aroma. Some cherry, fig, wood and vanilla. Can see why this ages well.  T: Outstanding. Deep, dark fruits fill the palate while the Belgian characteristics are present throughout. Not even close to overly sweet like some Quads can get. Alcohol presence is subdued but still noted, as it is playing a great part in the flavor of this beer. There is some tartness that I believe is cutting what would be an overly sweet quad. Well crafted beer. Definitely what a quad should be.  M: Absolutely loving every aspect of this beer. Good carbonation that leaves the mouth tingling a bit, yet it stays thick and full bodied. Flavors linger for a good while.  D: Taking it slow with this one, each sip reveals something new. A slow drinker for sure, this beer represents the quad style phenomenally.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

The pour produces a big, fluffy, creamy tan head that has extremely great retention and pretty nice lacing. Noticed some of the ""waterfall effect"" in the initial pour, a la Guinness, et al. Smell is sweet, fruit (raisin, cherry, grape and plum), malt, oak, spice (clove), fine Belgian dark chocolate and some alcohol. Amazing complexity and great balance. Taste is every bit of what is promised to the nose without the noticeable, and expected, alcohol. For a brew this potent I am very surprised that the ABV is so well hidden. A whiskey note is there as well. Mouthfeel is rich and smooth, warming the throat. A light effervescence all over the tongue, as well. Medium-full bodied. The only downside I found was a bit of roughness in the aftertaste, kind of a bitter cherry/oak flavor. That being said, this is an absolute ""cream of the crop"" beer.

The beer itself is an opaque, dark brown.  S- Alcohol at first. Later some sweetness and fruit. Not the fragrant monster some reviews described.  T- I'm not really sure how to describe this one. Very faint caramel sweetness, a tiny amount of hops, with a bready/yeast finish. Underwhelming, but incredibly well balanced. Some faint alcohol occasionally, but very well hidden all around.  M- Light and smooth. Nice active carbonation at first that died back as it warmed.  D- I was disappointed by this to be honest. It was incredibly well balanced and nice to drink, but it was underwhelming. The flavors were weak and I missed out on the strong smells others described. I had an amazing dubbel last night that blows this beer out of the water. I hardly detected any malts in the at all.

Looks amazing when brought to the table in a cute little snifter/globe. Brownish with plum highlights. Nice head at first, but it recedes faster than my ideal quad. A touch more lace would be good as well, but this is still superior to many, many beers.  Smell is soooo good! Raisins, figs, fresh plums, dried prunes, grapes - if it's purple or brown and wrinkled, it's in there. Unique for sure, this has more sweetness than just about any quad I've had. Westy 12 is just a touch more spicy, while Rochfort 10 is more raisin straight-up. The muscat sweetness sets this apart and makes it very appealing.  Taste is exceptional. AKA the bomb. The flavors from the malt match the raisin, grape, and fig smells. There's a caramel bread thing that I love as well. The yeast adds complexity by way of some clove and perhaps even vanilla. Alcohol is well hidden but perceptable. Phenols are slightly spicy but very moderate. A perfect tasting beer, at 10.5% this is just so well crafted, nothing needs changed, an instant hall of famer for taste.  Nice creamy, full mouthfeel. Perfect carb.

Nose is cherry, plums, figs, white wine, yeast, spices, overlain with a foundation of classic Belgian ale malts. Inviting.  Tasting notes are similar to the nose, which work brilliantly together. A nice toasted brown sugar and caramel flavor as well. A wonderfully balanced brew, hard to believe it's a quad, considering the absolute lack of an alcohol taste. Finishes slightly dry and crisp. The brew only gets better as it warms, which opens up all the richness within. Superb stuff.  Carbonation was initially high, but became less of an impediment as it warmed, making it easy to quaff. Definitely a brew to be served after being given a chance to breathe.  A real joy to drink, a first-rate Belgian strong ale.

259,1708,appenzeller,4.4,"Pours a deep mahogany with a thick vanilla lace. Aroma is sweet, malty. Taste is complex with breadiness, sweetness, spiciness of cinnamon and clove. This is a beautifully rich beer, moutfeel is silky smooth and drinkability is superb--for what it is. One of these is plenty!",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Radome,4.42,"A - Dark brown and opaque beer. The head is off-white and made up of tiny, creamy bubbles. It is very thick and persistent.  S - Sweet malty aroma. Plum and raisin notes , maybe a little alcohol in the background. Delicious smell.  T - Malt is up front, with nutty and biscuity notes. I also get some raisins and dark fruits and a hint of smoke in the background. Overall this beer starts out sweet and finishes drier than I expected.  M - Body is fairly heavy. The carbonation adds some creaminess that lightens it. No alcohol burn.  D - Very nice. It is complex and delicious, yet not overly sweet and cloying.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,racer2k,4.5,"Poured 33cL bottle into a St. Bernardus goblet glass  A - Pours a dark ruby red cherry color and creates a two finger off white head which is quite frothy and dense.  S - Dark fruit - prunes, raisins, apricots, plums and a pizza bread dough like aroma. There is a very balanced sweet malty flavor to the aroma with some noticeable alcohol tones which is not a surprise given the 10.50% abv  T - Dark fruity and chewy flavors with a balanced sweet malt profile and a subtle yeast accent to the taste. The complexity of this quad is amazing and the alcohol heat is hidden quite well which could be dangerous given the fantastic taste.  M - Some nice carbonation action going on in the glass but the beer is quite smooth and has a moderate body. The finish is crisp and dry.  D - Excellent Quadrupel brewed by one of the finest Trappist brewery's in the world. Highly recommended if you enjoy this style of beer. You will no doubt smile and grin like the jolly man on the label!",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,andrenaline,4.23,"A - Pours a dark, hazy, copper brown with a finger of head with good retention. Dissipates to a thin layer of fine bubbly head. Holds a thin bubbly film on the edges as well, but doesn't leave any real lacing.  S - Very fruity, with plum, raisins, banana, cloves and bit of orange citrus. The alcohol is noticeable, but seems to be less strong as it warms.  T - The fruity flavours come through in full force, led by plums, and raisins, followed by a rush of cloves and banana on the finish. I'm dumbfounded that the alcohol is not more noticeable.  M - Very light and bubbly, and to my surprise, goes down incredibly smooth. I would've though it would be much thicker and more syropy, but it's the perfect balance of carbonation.  D - Highly recommended to anyone looking for a bold and flavourful quad. Absolutely yummy. Could probably throw back a few of these as a time, but I would recommend only doing so with caution as the alcohol sneaks up on you! Enjoy!",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,rawthar,3.98,"A- A hazy cherry wood brown, the murkiness of which obscures what must be some very active carbonation judging by the thick creamy brown head that starts big and bad but dissipates at a manageable pace to a strong film.  S- Lots of farmhouse funky yeast up front and high in the nose, carrying a malty sweetness that opens up into raisin bread, overly ripe apples, and prune preserves, followed by an almost undetectable hint of heat.  T- First wave to the tongue is surprisingly subdued, but upon swallowing, a very intense flavor of the dark fruits from the nose expands from the back of the palette to fill the entire mouth. After the fruits wash away, a more crystally brown sugar flavor lingers for a moment, then subsides back to an aftertaste of fruity, bready tones, and a slight bit of alcohol, though much less than 10% abv would seem to produce.  M- An initial surge of carbonation to the tip of the tongue accounts for the initially mellow flavor, after which the beer turns to foam, and heats up a bit on the way down.  D- Tasty enough to enjoy en masse, though strong enough to merit caution, a good beer with a lot of complexities, best appreciated by the sip.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,AgentMunky,4.3,"Poured from a 33cL bottle into a Rochefort glass.  A: Pours a murky red-brown with light head that disappears quickly. Moderate lacing. Dense and foreboding.  S: Not as strong or as fruity as I had hoped. Instead I'm getting alcohol and a spicy, bitingly pleasant scent.  T: Excellent, but not exceedingly so. An initial alcoholic burst mixes with tingling carbonation, fading into a nice, lightly fruity body tempered by spices. Never cloying or overbearing. The aftertaste is a long, light throwback to the very first sip. Overall, I am pleased.  M: The bite provided by the carbonated spiciness is a truly lovely feeling for the tongue. I anticipate each sip with delight. Never does this beer stick to the mouth or cause any discomfort. Mouthfeel is great.  D: A hefty 10% is definitely present, but I feel this adds to, rather than detracts from, the beer. A sippable brew to be enjoyed slowly and sparingly. Not my everyday fare.  EDIT: the following review is of a bottle aged 14 months. Poured from a 33cL bottle into a Rochefort chalice. Stamped ""04 02 15.""  4.25A: Generous, frothy head. Decent retention. Heavy initial lace. Opaque, mahogany brown.  4S: Complex, winey, and fruity. Fermented grapes. Faint sugars. Somewhat faint.  4T: Hrm. Not sure how this one aged. It's a tad...muted? The sense of alcoholic grape juice is here, with an obtrusive spiciness. Almost puckery-tart, but the aftertaste is not entirely pleasant -- lots of yeast that reminds me of an old ale, but feels out of place in a quad. Touch of sugars.  4.5M: Still carbonated and surprisingly light. Really refreshing and pretty good. Smack worthy.  3.5O: I prefer this beer fresh. While an interesting evolution of flavor, it's a bit sharp and sour for my taste. Won't cellar again.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Lots of sediment in the beer.  S - Very bready, yet sweet. caramel and fruits dominate the smell. This is a very complex aroma and I don't know if I am experienced enough at reviews to actually place most of the things that are going on.  T - Very sweet taste, malts dominate the beginning of the taste. Fruits take over very quickly. Once again, very complex and I can't really pick out individual things.  M - Very smooth, I was worried when I saw how much yeast was floating in the glass. Slight drying finish, might be a bit much, but it's not too detrimental. Has quite a bit of carbonation which gives a nice tingle complimenting the sweetness of the beer.  D - Extremely good drinkability given the ABV. If I didn't already know, I would have guessed 6-7% max.  I will need to get this one again sometime I am more experienced at discerning tastes. Very complex, very good beer. I haven't had many quadrupels but this is definitely the best I have gotten around to.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Poured brown in color with a frothy and bubbly off-white head. Excellent head retention and moderate lacing.  The aroma has a sweet, malty, caramel, chocolate, dark fruit aroma to it. Very nice and complex, not too dark for the style either. A little yeast flavors round out the nose.  The taste is full dark fruit and malty sweet goodness. It has some notes of caramel, brown sugar, chocolate, figs, plums and bread. Very nice and complex tasting, probably the best of the style I've had so far.  The mouthfeel is on the thicker side and carbonation is moderate to below average. Drinkability is good, it's a great tasting beer for the style and abv.

259,1708,donniecuffs,4.74,"At the Eulogy Tavern in Philadelphia. Into a chalice, poured a mahogany/reddish color with slightly less than a finger of off-white, which collapsed quickly, but I suspect that it may have had something to do with the way the glass was washed. Smelled of plum, raisin, sour cherry, and nutmeg. The flavor was off the charts; molasses, nutmeg, plum, and raisins, which dissolved to a sour, black cherry finish, which zero hint of the high alcohol content. Nicely full-bodied, but very smooth with nearly no carbonation. Despite the fact that this is a strong beer, I'd make an attempt at sessioning it, as it was super smooth and satisfying. Needless to say I ordered another after the initial sample.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Label dated: 07 05 14 Pours a hazy brown with tan head that grips the glass.  Nose: Similar nose to the Westy 12 but brighter, a little hop quality creeps through all those raisin, fig, date aromas. Something like model glue is there too. Carl had an awesome observation: uncooked white bread dough.  Palate: Rich but not as creamy as the Westy 12 with warming alcohol. Bright yet wooly. Nice rough texture with flavors of fresh figs, bittersweet chocolate, and old leather. That pizza dough note is present on the palate, too.

S- dark fruity and sweetly tart, prune, black plum, raisin, fig, date, clove, nutmeg, apple cider, milk chocolate, brown sugar, damp wood, pinneapple alcohol scent, cedar, and orange. spicy and acidic. alcohol vapors give this strong quad an intense bouquet and i'm feeling more at ease with the relatively off-putting appearance.  T- sweet, chocolatey, fruity, nutty... malty. some grassy hop flavor but this one tastes well, flat. as far as i know this bottle had been handled properly but i expected far more from the saint. i can't appreciate the richness of flavor i get from other quads so near to my heart. this one seems 2-dimensional. chocolate, brown sugar, some prune, date, and fig, a little black pepper and an earthy woody nutty flavor and a touch of smokiness. finishes a bit metallic and on the water side but with some floral alcohol taste. finishes neither dry nor cloying with an odd bitterness.  MF- again somewhat boring. carbonation is present but dissipates quickly. texture is nothing to rejoice over. i can feel chunks of yeast when i sip and they stick in my throat when i swallow making for an unpleasant experience. a bit sticky on the lips.  D- i'm convinced that this bottle has seen better days as the retialer that i purchased it from has a questionable reputation. i assumed that i couldn't go wrong with such a high abv brew but i guess i was mistaken. sadly i have to dump this one due to the yeast chunkys. i will be in pittsburgh next month and i WILL stop by the sharp edge, the best belgian beer bar i've ever heard of, and a reputable source, and try this one again hopefully on tap, and certainly re-review. sadness from watou to alliance. sincerely, james.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

S: Smells of bread, raisins, yeast. Hints of sour/funk/tartness abound as well.  T: Tastes the same, though the fruits overpower the yeasty breadiness.

One finger off white head that sticks around for a bit before leaving some decent lacing.  A- bready malts and spices. There is a sweet brown sugar smell and some dark fruits highlighted as well.  T- the bready malts and the spices really start things off. The spices are clove and nutmeg if I'm not mistaken. The plum flavors start to come through as the temperature of the beer warms. There is a candied fig taste. The sweetness is nice and isn't overwhelming. There is a yeasty presence also. Only a slight hint of the abv.  M- medium body. With spot on carbonation.

Other: nuts, brown bread other yeast stuff.  T: What has been said for the smell. Also, it has more nut taste than the smell would have let me know, and a light milk chocolate taste too.

259,1708,BricksandPorter,3.2,"Got this bottle from Wegman's great selection. After a month of aging, I set in the fridge over night and poured into a tulip snifter. I just cant have nice things...  Pour - beautiful maroon brown color. Hues of brown, red, orange, purple, plum and lavender - really nice looking. Has a great pour too - good creamy one/two finger head that smooths out but lingers in reduced form. Lacing is minimal, it sticks to the beer column rather than the glass. Seems a little dark for the triple style I'm used to.  Nose - Carmel and fruit. Sweet on the nose with a definite sour alcohol undertone. Simple and straight forward.  Taste - begins with a bombardment of fruit sweetness. Esters bring about notes of banana, sour cherries, fresh strawberries and even citrus. Full malt sweetness isn't apparent until about midway through the finish, making it even sweeter. Alcohol not hidden at all. This is actually not very appealing - too much going on at once.  Mouthfeel - great carbonation and a medium-full body with lots of character, but balance is not present. All sweet, nothing else. Rather chunky on the way down, and the burp is marshmallowy. Kind of weird, especially for a trappist.  Drinkability - nope, not a session beer. Too much booze, too much sweet, not enough balance. I usually like St. Bernadus alot - the Prior 8 is phenomenal. They missed on this one.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Very lively, gorgeous tone.  S : Notes of dark fruit, spice, and yeast. Rich. Pleasing.  T : Yeast hits you up front with a bready feel, followed by a very slight alcohol tone that meets with spice & dark fruit.  M : A quite heavy brew with a soft feel. Leaves just a light film to the mouth that retains the pleasing taste.  D : At 10% you're supposed to sip this one, and its complexity will reward you for it. It's so delicious however, don't be surprised if you want a second.  How do you add anything to a review of a legendary beer? Not much can be said that can't be.

Poured a lovely deep reddish brown with over an inch of nice tan head that had very good retention and lacing.  The aroma was a great combination of deep fruits, solid malt, a hint of spice and tangy yeast. The flavors fit that profile as well, just amplified and bolder. The beer had a surprisingly dry finish for such a sweet and fruity brew.  The body was full, rich, enveloping and a bit sassy. Drinkability was excellent. If you're only having one, or if you're having several, you won't soon get bored with this top shelf brew.

It is well balanced, nothing is coming out too much as to mask the other tastes. The 10 degree of alcool is well soften by a sweet taste (but not as much as the Rochefort 10) and it's mouthfeel.

259,1708,Naugros,4.35,"Poured from the bottle into the DFH tulip glass. Foam sprang from the bottle mouth upon opening.  Dark garnet with yeast sediment flaoting around in the ample carbonation. A light tan head with good retention, very slow to dissipate. Not much lace on the sides of the glass and it slides down quickly. This may have been a function of the heat and humidity on the day drank, since most others report nice lacing.  Dark or dried fruit dominate the nose with a hint of citrus and clove.  Figs come through as a dry sweetness on the tongue and there is some citrus bitterness at the back, but it doesn't linger. The alcohol is well-masked, but you can feel it tickle the top of your palate. Belgian yeast ""funk"" is present, but expected and minimal.  As mentioned above, the palate is tickled by a very mild alcohol burn and some clove astringency. Carbonation is also present.  A very drinkable quad, even at 10.5% ABV.

What remained left a nice sticky lacing which held up until the last sip. Noticeable fizziness.  Smells sweet with dark fruits, chocolate, and caramel.  Taste is incredible - roasted malts, rich dark fruit flavors, and overripe grapes. There is a lot going on, almost a sweet/sour flavor. Just the right amount of hop backbone. Alcohol comes in on the finish which is long.  Love the mouthfeel, the carbonation cuts through the heavy syrupy goodness.  This is a supremely drinkable beer.

Pours deep amber and honey-like; one finger creamy head that took a little while to settle.  Smells like heaven ought to. Strong aromas of honey, raisins, dates, and a smidgen of raspberry. Also a little whiff of the alcohol. Stupendous nose.  I found the taste to be not quite as amazing as the smell, but this is a really great and enjoyable quad. I found it a tad maltier, nearly no hops character, and flavors like the nose which mellow on the tongue.  Not too heavy, but with good carbonation.

259,1708,BuckeyeNation,4.8,"Glazed persimmon orange with a fine sprinkling of yeast drifting downward against the tide of uprushing carbonation. The wheat toast colored crown is a firmly creamy, rocky, sticky masterpiece of the sort that only Belgians seem able to create. What a fantastic way to start.  Does Brouwerij St. Bernardus (and do other Belgian breweries) recognize the quadrupel style, or do they consider Abt 12 to be a high-ABV dubbel? The silk-screened label on the 750 indicates that this ale is 'brewed in the classic Dubbel style'.  The aroma isn't as dark as some... or as dark as expected. There's more steely caramel, earth and toast than anything even remotely resembling chocolate or roasted malt. It's also more medium fruity than dark fruity. A wonderful clove-and-pepper yeast-derived spiciness pulls it all together in beautiful fashion.  St. Bernardus Abt 12 easily deserves its reputation as one of the world's finest beers. It delivers the same seamless quality, mind-boggling complexity and compulsive drinkability as the rest of their outstanding lineup. Along with Brouwerij Het Anker, these guys are my favorite Belgian brewery.  This flagship ale really does taste more like a BSDA or a big dubbel than most quadrupels. Specifics include well-toasted brown bread, steely caramel, unsweet figs, earthy tobacco, ground clove and black pepper. What was a solid 4.5 during the first few ounces is now a much-deserved 5.0 as the middle of the bottle is breached.  Warming brings greater flavor intensity, several more flavor facets, and a more complete melding of flavors. We're now talking 'gold standard' for the style. My tongue registers the ABV as 8.5% while my brain is beginning to feel the Full Monty. Time to start sipping rather than greedily gulping.  This big bottle must be fairly fresh (estimated age is barely more than one year) because a surprising amount of hop bitterness is still present. Sweeter would be fine, but I like it just the way it is. Aging this beauty for 15 years, as the label suggests is possible, doesn't seem like such a great idea.  The body/mouthfeel isn't far from perfection. It's lighter than most triple-digit ABV ales, but heavier probably wouldn't have worked as well. The smooth-edged creaminess can't be faulted. Nor can the ideal amount and well-integrated feel of the carbonation.  Abt 12 is a true classic that deserves mention whenever the topic turns to the best beers on the planet. Even though Tripel is the finest ale that St. Bernardus has to offer, this big brew isn't far behind.

Smell -- Sweet and malty; raisins, prunes, a little bit of licorice, a little bit of milk chocolate. I might be the only one to make reference to Rainsinettes, but that's what I'm getting. Faint alcohol presence, but is to be expected.  Tatse -- Dried dark fruits, some carob, buttered rye bread. Sweet, earthy, smooth, and buttery.  Mouthfeel -- Full-bodied, mild 'prickly' carbonation. Much smoother than 6 and 8. Warming in the finish.  Drinkability -- Definitely my favorite of the St. Bernardus lineup. Smooth, complex, buttery, earthy.

259,1708,homebrew311,4.44,"We've got yet another gusher... that's 4 for 4 in the gift set I got for Christmas. Fortunately these beers seem to be victims of overcarbonation rather than infection. once I poured it in my St. Bernardus chalice, it settled down just fine.  A: pours a deep purplish red with a fingers of slightly tan head, dissipates to a very thin layer which sticks around. Lots of lacing. Somewhat cloudy in appearance (possibly because of the gushing)  S: smells of candied grapes, very sweet on the front with lots of fruitiness, this smell seems to fade into alcohol presence, but nothing unexpected for a 10.5% beer.  T: delicious sweetness on the front, reminiscent of grape jolly ranchers, nothing overly sweet, the palate dries out as it finishes and leaves a slight hint of residual sweetness on the palate. Excellent balance for a big beer, this beer accentuates everything that I love about Belgian beers  MF: thick body with an almost syrupy presence, not as high carbonation as the gushing would suggest, goes down smoothly  D: well this is the beer that really showed me what Belgian beers are all about early in my craft beer drinking time. It is still just as good as I remember, however I pick up much more delicate flavors as my palate has developed.

A little bit of brown sugar almost as a background to the plethora of fruity smells emanating from this beer.  T - What can I say? It's as fantastic as everyone says it is. This is the second time I've had it, didn't review it last time. Just sweet plums, apples, almost all of bits of the smell. The back-end has some dark toffee notes. A very smooth boozy finishes it off. Usually I'm not big on beers being hot, but this one I think just adds to it.  M - Feels great, I'm usually quite picky on carbonation levels, but I think this is perfect. To nitpick: just a hair thicker than I like, but really that's just me looking for something.  D - So drinkable it's absurd, even with the boozy back-end. I could probably beer bong this if I wanted to. Well, maybe not, but still, it's so drinkable for a 10% beer.  Fantastic brew.

Bubbly taste with a fruity flavor and some mild malt on the swallow and a slight peppery taste. A nice looong aftertaste is present with a lot going on well after the sip is down. A slight numbing effect on the gums. Foam with every sip is a nice touch. Drinkability is way high as the going down is very easy. Dealing with the after-effects? Not so much.

Nice nutty chocolate undertones without being too sweet. It is smooth and well balanced with the high ABV in no way dominating, instead counter-balancing the sweetness perfectly.

Awesome-looking bottle, which might inspire friends to suggest that you have some kind of magic elixir in your closet.

Bready yeasts back up the flavors as well while the considerable alcohol being perfectly invisible with just a gentle warmth on the palate.  Mouthfeel is full and creamy and well carbonated.

A very pretty beer  Smells of malt and fruity Belgian yeast. Spiced and dark fruit most noticeable. Some caramel and brown sugar are also noted. Every inhale I feel as if I notice something else- amazingly complex brew.  The primary taste is of sweet, dark fruits- raisins and plums especially. Then comes the sweet caramel malt notes and the bready yeast flavors. Some alcohol warmth is present but not off-putting in the least. Ends with tantalizing vanilla and caramel tease.

Ahhh, but not just any stone fruit, stone fruit that has been dried in the sun, plums, apricots, and prunes.  T-Well this baby, tastes just as sweet as it smells. But now the flavor has intensified into dried cranberry, raisons and currants. I am beginning to get the Finnish of a great tartness. Man is this good.

Dark fruits and slight molasses are the primary aromas, coupled with that quintessential abbey smell.  I tasted plum, prune, and ripe apple. It's amazing how this doesn't taste boozy at all. It's dense, but delicate because its flavor layering.  Mouthfeel is a little crisp at first with noticeable carbonation. It's drinkability is strong given then ABV.

(S)- Some nice ripe dark fruits of plum & grape. Touches of dry clay & biscuits. Finishes with a yeasty horseblanket.  (T)- Some thick bits of banana & biscuits up front that flow into ripe dark fruits. Finishes dry, with plenty of yeasty clay & earth.

The 10%abv is hidden extremely well.  (D)- A solid Quad that has everything in the right place for the style. A crisp & ripe flavor.

259,1708,AmberMan22,4.77,"Figured earning my 'Empty Mug' Karma status deserved a proper beer in celebration. This is the first Quadrupel I've had, which gives me reservations about making a review -- but I have had plenty of good dubbels, tripels, BSDA and BSPA before, so that helps.  Had this on tap, served into a St. Bernardus Chalice.  And wow, does it look good. Color is a deep, hazy cherry mahogany mixed lightly with plum, with a lightly toasted colored cap on top. The only demerit this faces is that I expected better head retention and lacing.  Smell doesn't disappoint in the least. Candied plums, raisins, a hint of blackberry(?), all mixed beautifully with the heavenly malt smell.  I'm just going to clump the rest of the categories into one grand paragraph.  Tastes literally like sugar-plum fairies (thank you Tchaikovsky) are dancing on my tongue. Carbonation is of superfine bubbles which tingle and only enhance the experience. Alcohol is certainly present, but remains tucked behind the rest of the symphony. The fruit-laced malt flavors are out of this world. A dash of bitterness sneaks in towards the end, and dissipates before the sweet and malty finish.

The nose is sweet with hints of green apples and a hint of dusty yeast.  The taste is immediately very thick and malty with intense apple and banana flavors as well as a brief alcoholic warming. Sweet hard candies and a sharp tartness are in there as well. Silky-smooth mouthfeel and intense but fine carbonation give an amazing tactile dimension to this brew. Fantastic drinkability.,Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,SDHoffers,4.26,This has to be one of the most balanced quads I've ever had. There is nothing offensive about this beer. The look is coppery but not thick. The nose is small with hints of sweetness like dried fruits but doesn't play the starring role. I actually think the drinkability is the real winner on this one. Since nothing is standing out as the main influence here it's hard to pick it apart. The high alcohol would be the only catalyst here because I'd be expecting it to go down a little hot but it doesn't. I had this on tap one time at our place and it lasted 12 hours. Definitely one I will get again when it becomes available.,Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,sullenbee,4.7,"Poured into a snifter - healthy head, lots of lacing. Dissipated to a small spotty layer. Cloudy, mahogany.  Fruity aroma, and yeasty. Getting a strong apple scent, swirling it brought back the head that had previously dissipated. Nice. Bit of raisin bread pudding, sweet and warm, with some spiciness.  Taste is sweet, but with a slight fruity tartness. A smidge of vanilla. Very well balanced.  Mouthfeel is slightly carbonated, but not to excess. A delight to my senses. I want more.  I expected far more of an alcohol burn for the ABV. This is an incredibly drinkable, tasty beer. Obviously world class. Beer really exploded with more flavors as it warmed. I wish I had the vocab to really give it justice.  On the bottle - ""Bringing Heavenly Nectar Within Reach."" Indeed. This one rates on my personal beer scale as nectar of the gods. There is something about the Belgians that really get to my heart. (Future husband, if you are out there, take note.

259,1708,Chico1985,4.73,"I put this brew off for too long, finally decided to pop open my 750ml on a beautiful Saturday afternoon with no distractions and music-a-pumpin'.  Pour is beautiful, dark blood red with huge 3-finger off-white head on each pour. Head shrinks over time but never comes close to disappearing and leaves great, thick lacing. A bit of sediment.  Smells more fruity than I expected, I'm getting apple, plum, brown sugar, some booze. Smell is much more potent once the head dies down a bit.  Taste is so excellent, dark fruits aplenty mix wonderfully with a generous amount of brown sugar/caramel richness. If I had to pick other particulars, I'd say raisin, plum and sugar cookie. With the flavors I've listed here, you might think this is overly sweet, but it definitely is not. Everything is balanced wonderfully here. Every sip gets better and better. The booze taste is surprisingly VERY well-hidden, it is slight but only adds to the overall taste and leaves a great warming feeling in your face and stomach. The aftertaste is amazing, the yeast really starts to show through and the brown sugar/caramel element is to die for.  The mouthfeel is quite carbonated, but extremely luscious and creamy. Swishing this in around in my mouth is pure bliss. I have a glass of water standing by and I haven't taken one sip, I want this taste to cover my tongue forever.  I personally think this drinks extremely easy, especially compared to other quads I have tried. This is definitely an entirely different beast than the Rochefort 10, more fruity, I have to say I prefer this. Easily the best Belgian I've had so far. A beer that, like most rich Belgians, definitely deserves to be drank respectfully and to be drank in the right mood and environment. If it's true that this is the closest beer to Westy 12, than that has been hyped about 20 times more in my mind. I will be buying a 4-pack of this to age for sure.  *** edit -- 5/4/13  Opened up a 2010 bottle that is a little over 3 years old at this point. Huge dark fruit (red grape & raisin) overtakes other flavors a little bit but still quite excellent and opens more with warmth.

This beer smells of rich malt, dark fruit, mostly fig and raisin, followed by a bready aroma and fruity esters from the yeast. Other notes are of dark cherry, banana, ripe fruit skin, and clove. The first sip is prickly carbonation from the bottle conditioning, but quickly turns into a creamy sweet malt bomb that then displays dark fruit on the palate, followed up by a dry cocoa powder that plays nicely with a warming alcohol finish.

My choice for 1st beer back, St. Bernie 12.  11.2 oz bottle pours a nice dark cola color with an abundance of spice-flecked foam: very bubbly, has great retention and leaves lacing down my Chimay chalice. Fair bit of sediment floats to the bottom of the glass.  Bready nose with an underlaying of sweet dark fruits, a hint of cola, and light spicing.  Taste blows the nose out of the water. A sharp entry with a load of spicing (cloves) and an earthy, bready base. Touch of cocoa, dark fruits, a hint of booze in the finish. Rich caramel sweetness comes through in the finish as well. Nice, drying finish with a bit of alcohol warming on the way down. Perhaps a little too bubble for me, though without it I can see it could become a little syrupy.  A really excellent world-class quad (pretty sure we all know that going in) whose key words I would choose: spicy, earthy, and warming. Not sure I would grab more than one at a time.

Raisins, plum, cherry, fig, caramel, toasted pecans, toffee, vanilla, and clove. Smells like toast and jam or a good danish. Inviting!  The taste is like the nose. Sweet dry/ripe fruits, spice, nuts, with toasted bread. The alcohol doesn't play into the flavor but does dry out the finish.  Not too heavy, not to light.

259,1708,BeerNemesis,4.4,"St. Bernardus ""Abt. 12"". 750 ml. 2009 vintage.  Appearance: This hazy beverage falls somewhere between a muddy brown and faded purple. The off-white head spills foam over the edge of the chalice as it mushrooms upwards magnificently. The glass is coated in lacing.  Aroma: A spike of cloves, the dense and pleasant fog of malt sweetness, and dark, sun-dried fruits is what it's all about. Roasted malts, nutty, some light floral notes, the pungent waft of light alcohol, brown sugar, a spritz of cola, the smallest hint of sherry, spices and dark fruits galore - dates, plums, prunes and raisins. The dark fruits wallow in my nose, tripping over each other and filling me with a hazy sense of comfort.  Taste: Clove is first, riding the wave of toasty malt and deep brown sugar. The dark fruit lurks beneath the surface -- plums, raisins, dates, prunes, and suddenly cherry too. Carob flavors -- so much light chocolate powder, subtly hide in the background, while the alcohol takes heart about halfway through the sip. Overall, it's earthy, brooding, fruity, dark, chalky sweet, and spicy too. The finish is smooth and warming, and leaves the taste of dark fruit and mild solvent flavors mingling in my mouth. Quite well balanced -- though a bit on the malty side, and there's nothing wrong with that.  Mouthfeel: It's all buttery, smooth, creamy and a whole host of other thick and pleasing words. The fruitiness is brooding and palpable -- almost squishy. The carbonation itself takes on a smoothness that is uncharacteristic of it's bite and vibrance. I really felt I was drinking something substantial, and the varied textures made beautiful music in my mouth.  Drinkability: While the alcohol is evident -- and it really starts to seep in mid sip -- I found it was really well hidden towards the end. The peak in alcoholic punch quickly softens, leaving a happy warming feel. While it's obviously not a beverage to be taken lightly, I had no problem enjoying it in bulk.  Notes: I'm very pleased with St. Bernardus as a whole after drinking this. I've had the Christmas Ale and their Tripel, and each one was beautifully crafted. The same goes for Abt. 12. Oh, one more thing: I'm not sure if this was a fluke, but the cork was incredibly difficult to dislodge. It took a prolonged and herculean effort to pop it, but I must say that it was worth the time and effort.  On the label: I find myself pleased by the aesthetics of the label featuring a jovial monk drinking deep from a chalice. On the back of the label it says:  Brewery St. Bernardus was founded in 1946 in Watou, Province of West Flanders in Belgium.  These exceptional quality ales are brewed by using only the finest malts, local grown hops, yeast and artesian water pumped from a depth of 500 feet.  After the brewing process these traditional ales are matured in tanks for three months before being bottle conditioned.  The result is a naturally carbonated ""living ale"", which can be aged for up to 15 years and will satisfy the taste of even the most discriminating connoisseurs.  ""Bringing heavenly nectar within reach""  Abt. 12 - abbey ale brewed in the classic ""Dubbel"" style of of Belgium's best Abbey Ales. Serve this noble and wonderfully balanced brown ale at 52-56°F in a goblet glass to best enjoy its delicate bouquet.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,steelerguy,4.47,"A - Pours a mahogany like liquid caramel. High tan head that is quite creamy, lasting, and leaves lace. Moderate carbonation helps keep the head around as you drink.  S - Complex malt aroma. Sweet caramel, raisins, bananas, with a Belgian spiciness.  T - The complex aroma continues on in the mouth. Starts sweet and spicy, then it is all ripe fruit, ends with some phenols and alcohol.  M - Tingles the tongue, warms the mouth, and although you get lots of sweet fruit and malt in the taste, it finishes nice and dry.  D - It is damn near magical that they have hidden a 10% ABV (according to my bottle, not 10.5%) in this beer. It is so flavorful and balanced, the alcohol warms and tingles but is not harsh in any way. A great beer that should be sipped or it will sneak up on you quick...and it is hard to sip!",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Beerenauslese,4.77,"Pours a dark but translucent brown into my St. Bernardus glass with an initial ample head that quickly dissipates into a fine ring of foam.  Lovely nose with complex aromas of raisins and other fruit, chocolate, ginger and other spices. I am in the bakery here.  Taste is wonderful, sweet at first but finishes dry and crisp. This is one of the great Belgian beer taste sensations. Lots of complexity, with flavors of coffee, chocolate, ginger, cola, hops, pepper, and salty finish. Defies complete identification.  Mouthfeel is medium body, very creamy with good carbonation.  This is a beer I'll drink until it is clear I shuddah stopped. Addictive.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,ekmoody,4.25,"Pours a deep beautiful brown with a fairly thick foamy head that dissipated somewhat quickly.  Aroma is quite fruity and sweet, maybe a hint of spice.  Taste is similar to the smell, this beer is very good. Nice and sweet with some nice malts and with a back note that is a bit spicy, but certainly not overpowering. I definitely wouldn't have guessed the 10.5% abv if someone had given this to me without telling me what it is.  Lightly carbonated, this is not as a heavy of a beer as the abv made me think it would be. Very enjoyable, one of the best Belgian beers I've tried.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,bengtaaron,4.72,"My first review and my only quad yet -- and what a hell of a way to start...  Poured from a 750mL bottle into a sort of bordeaux glass (it was the best I could do).  A: Color is a turbid ruby with a bit of sediment throughout. The head crops up a beautiful one-finger beige and quickly dissipates with minimal lacing.  S: Dark fruit -- particularly raisin/fig, brown sugar, and clove. A swirl or two reveals sweet bread and candied apple.  T: Pleasantly warm alcohol mingles with dark fruit, malt, and clove before balancing out with a lusciously sweet (not overpowering) finish.  M: Medium and creamy with just the right amount of carbonation. Very pleasant.  D: This beer reminds me of my other spirited love: Absinthe. You can get blissfully lost in the complexities of smell and taste without realizing (or caring!) about the high ABV. Don't get me wrong -- this brew is delicious enough to drink all night; but the sweetness, the ABV, and most importantly, the complex depth, make this a beer that commands appreciation and respectful moderation. Excess would just feel decadent.  Overall, a true treat and a relatively accessible precedent for the world of beer.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

The head was almost overflowing and tan with quickly dissipating bubbles. There was just a touch of lacing and looked good.  Smelled like burnt sugar, sugar cookies and maybe a little rum.  Taste was sweet and WHOAH...ALCOHOL! Lots of rich sugars and a little grape danced around with this one.  Mouthfeel was a little thin. Maybe this was a little watery for my preference but not bad at all.  Despite the big warming alcohol kick, this was very easy to drink. Probably the thin mouthfeel that did it but I could definitely go for another one!",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Appearance: Pours a cloudy chocolate brown with a bubbly 1/2 inch beige head that lingers for a minute or two before it dissipates. Finishes with a film on the surface. Visible yeast sediment is suspended in the brew. Lacing was minimal.  Smell: Complex - ripe fruit and sweet malts. Predominantly aromas of green apple and grapes. No noticeable hop aromas and overall pretty clean.  Taste: Very sweet and earthy with slight souring. Green apple appears and adds tartness. The alcohol struggles against everything else going on here - surprising for such a high ABV.  Mouthfeel: Light carbonation. Rich with a smooth and full body.  Drinkability: One of the most inviting brews I've ever tasted. I approached the Abt 12 like a sipper, but it disappeared quicker than I anticipated, primarily because of a well-hidden ABV and smoothness on the palate.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Floaters abound. Smell is of candied sugar and prunes. There is a bite on the tongue followed by a sweetness with dark fruit. Can't put y finger on it, but the finish is the least enjoyable part of the beer so far. The body is medium to full and smooth with a creamy feel to it. Drinkability is decent but not great due to the finish that is not agreable to my taste.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Very sweet malty aroma. Smells absolutely delicious.  Taste: Complex flavor which combines the sweetness of dried fruit and roasted malt with a nice bit of spice. Strong alcohol flavor is apparent throughout. Very nice warming finish with just a hint of bitterness.  Mouthfeel: Full-bodied with a high amount of carbonation and a distinct alcohol bite.  Drinkability: Excellent drinkability; however, you don't want to drink too many because the high ABV will catch up to you.  Overall: An excellent beer all around.

Murky brown with red highlights and a giant light beige head that is super fluffy and luxurious looking. The pour was very gentle as to not disturb the sediment, but the head was still jumbo sized, with a good amount of stick, and left a nice pancake of head all the way through.  The aroma is overwhelming even while pouring, it just rolls out of the glass even from a foot away. Sweet malts, chewy vinous ripe fruits, tobacco leaf, and bready yeast. Some banana as it warms.  Taste is immense of dark dried fruits, raisins and ripe plums, clove, spicy and peppery alcohol warmth. Some dry yeast on the finish, and did I mention some alcohol as well. The hops give a little bitter kick at the end.  Mouthfeel is typical of something on this level, carbonation is high, body is moderate, and it all comes together in a gourmet-style and beautifully put together beer.

259,1708,ThoughtPolice,4.35,"Bought at Peabody's - Boone, NC. Cost me 5 bucks. This is a celebration beer cuz I got my first official investment in my nano-brewery from momma. Now to get the loot for my permits and such...  I had no expectations for this beer, because I was totally ignorant of it before buying the bottle.  Appearance: Very nice. I gave a pour that ended up looking too vigorous, had a 3 finger head (my fault, lol) but ended up settling at a light covering throughout the serving. Nice ruby red color. I like it.  Aroma: Raisins. Dried fruit in general (I would be more specific but I need to work on the palette understanding a bit). I'm not getting any hops, really, maybe a little floral. Smells like something sweet is coming, but no alcohol bite in the nose. EDIT: Somehow forgot to mention the strong Belgian yeast FONKIness in there.  Flayvah: A little spicy, a little alcohol. I just don't have the right words for thisun I don't think. I do, however, like it a lot. Raisins, prunes, dried fruit thing is prominent in the flavor, for sure. Sour apple candy thing is going on, too.  Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Mouthfeel is medium thick. Alcohol doesn't dominate whatsoever. The flavor sits around for quite a while, which I like. The flavor that dominates the aftertaste and MF is raisins. Drinkability is pretty damn good, too. The price compensates for it, however.  Overall: I wish I didn't have to pay for cross-world transportation of this beer, because I'd like to drink it more often. Maybe I should consider a job in the US congress, they seem do to well, what with all the revolving door and lobbying loot. Then again I'd feel like a douchebag.

D: this is one that I can drink all night long but at an extremely slow pace. this is a world class beer I can tell its a bit rough and need some time to mellow out the date on the bottle is 11/18/2013 so I think this one is young depending on how the brewery date its beers.

259,1708,ToasterChef,4.42,"Reviewed from my notes. Abt 12 has a deep plum color. A thin grey head settled to a skim of bubbles. There is lots of bubbles clinging to the sides of the glass. It has a spicy aroma with some lightly sweet malts and a little bit of musty Belgian yeast. There is a purple fruit in there as well, red grapes or plums. It has a good, crisp, complex flavor. I can pick out a graham cracker-like grain quality to it. I can also taste red and white grapes, especially in the finish. There is a small bite of alcohol and floral hops in the aftertaste. Overall, it's a hearty, big flavor. It feels very crisp with lots of carbonation. The coating feels very good; it leaves a lot of malty flavor behind. It's very drinkable.

S - Smells of Belgian yeast, figs, cloves, dark rye bread.  T - Rich, dark malts, plums, figs, the taste of yeast.  M - A little on the light side. Creamy, decent carbonation.  D - This will probably end up a drainpour simply because of how much sediment is in the glass. I can't take a sip without getting a mouthful.

T - The flavor follows up on the olfactory; impressions of dark and dried fruits, brown sugar, etc. reassert themselves, this time paired with a peppermint, nutmeg and cinnamon spicy essence.

S: Very robust. Musty and malty with a strong presence of dark fruit.  T: Again, a lot going on. Dark fruits, especially raisins really come out. Malt flavor is faint as is the alcohol, which is surprising considering the 10.5% abv. Black licorice in the finish.  M: Full bodied with some light carbonation and sweet finish.

T: This is a BIG beer and yet still very refined, with a complexity and fine balance only the Belgians have! This beer does have a strong bias towards malt (expected) and has a high alcohol content, but there are plenty of other fantastic subtle flavors and my gosh, this beer is just soooo smooth and pleasant. Frankly, you're not going to get any better in this pricerange. It's hard to describe what's going on because as with all good Belgian beers, every sip tastes different. Just a note, if you get any ""booziness"" at all, you are drinking an example that is too young. Usually with this beer I let them sit on the shelf 6 months or a year or so before drinking just to be safe.  M: Medium-high carbonation (lower than typical Belgians), high alcohol, but still very smooth on the palate. I was very surprised at this particular aspect of the beer.

Pours a solid brown, slightly reddish color. Thick (obviously) brown head and tons of active carbonation. Mostly clear.  Sweet malt aromas with plenty of caramel and a bit of chocolate present. Lots of spice notes from the Belgian yeast - clove and coriander and a bit of peppercorn. Lighter raisin fruit notes as well, with a very slight alcohol aroma at the end.  Tastes of strong Belgian yeast up front - the clove is very prominent. Moves to a solid caramel and malt flavor midway through. Mostly on the sweet side with a hint of candied sugar towards the end, along with a very biscuit-like malt flavor. A very faint solvent alcohol taste is noticeable in the finish but it is relatively minor.  Nice medium body and a warming, creamy mouthfeel. Not too crisp for all of the active carbonation present.

The taste corroborates the nose, with those fruits coming back with a sweet vengeance (those lovely malts!), including a hint of molasses/maple syrup all the way in the back. The body is a heavy medium, but does not sit poorly; rather it stands at attention, saluting, declaring itself, but not overpowering.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,DenverLogan,5,"Yeah...this could be a benchmark for Belgian strong dark - quad beers. Absolutely lovely fresh or aged up to 7 or more years. Beautifully balanced malt body of rich dark fruit, raisins, toffee, roasted malts, dark chocolate all blended together where none stands out overwhelmingly. Big alcohol but not hot. Great with soups. meat or rich vegie dishes, deserts. I've had this in Belgium, in various states, on tap, in small, big, and very big bottles. This is a great beer to serve fresh or after years of aging. I should add that while my rating across the board indicates 5.0, I can't add my own specific point rating, say, 4.6 for mouthfeel. There's a few beers I might want to rate higher, but this is definitely in the running for a dessert island beer. Exceptional!",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,mdwalsh,4.1,"I picked up at 750 mL of this beer in Chicago because I had heard it was a great stand in for Westy 12, the best beer in the world. If it is, I do not need to get a Westy, I was sorely disappointed. I even drank this on my one year anniversary for being a BA as my 250th review. What a let down.  A: Three finger tan head on top, medium-brown beer with decent active carbonation on bottom. Less lace than I would expect to see here. All in all, ok looking, but not amazingly beautiful.  S: Here I get a mild roast, and some mild Belgian yeast, but not much. Neither is there a lot of the Belgian Candi Sugar. It's pretty weak and really just needs to be stronger.  T: Similar to the smell, mild roast, mild yeast. There's a little bit of a sour taste, the good kind for a Belgian, though perhaps not a Quad. It's still just not full bodied enough.  M: Can't stress it enough, too light! But it is very very smooth and has perfect carbonation.  D: Can't argue with the drinkability here. It went down perfectly smooth, and I wouldn't have suspected 10.5% abv.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,jxhowell,4.47,"Appearance Poured a garnet color with an off-white foamy 1 finger head  Smell Initially aromas of bread and yeast fill the nose. As the head slowly fades you begin to smell ripe fruit, brown sugar and spiced rum  Taste Initially clove and spice esters, rich ripe fruits such as plums and dates with a slight drying sour aftertaste  Mouthfeel Effervescent with rich full body that lingers near the middle of the tongue and slowly covers you entire tongue with bubbles and ends with a slight dry finish.  Drinkability Rich and enjoyable like a decadent dessert. Perfect for the style but definitely too rich to be a session beer.  This is my favorite Belgian Quadrupel and in my opinion even compares with more exotic and rare versions of the style only available in Belgium. It's even more enjoyable with age and at 10.5% ABV it can age for quite some time with no adverse effects.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Chrisco88,4.71,"Appearance: Pours a murky deep brown (borderline black). An inch or so of off-white, foamy head lasts a good while, so long in fact that it was a bit annoying. The head is quite dense and frothy.  Aroma: Not very aromatic due to the massive, thick head. With some swirling and settling I caught a little bit of the dark fruit notes. Smells a bit like dry champagne to me, maybe a touch of alcohol.  Taste: What a complex beer we have here! First hit with dark fruit flavors, reminded me of red wine so I thought maybe grapes, currants, cherries or plums. I get a slight taste of some malts in there but the carbonation really brings out the fruit above all else. Not much bitterness if any. Aftertaste dominated by a dry alcoholic taste.  Palate: Good effervescence makes for a crisp, dry finish but overall the beer goes down smooth and is perfectly balanced in the mouth.  Overall: Definitely a new favorite, excellent Belgian ale in every way. The interesting esters and hints of malt combined with the ability to hide an ABV of 10% make this a deceptively drinkable brew. By all means grab a bottle and find out for yourself, a glass or two later and you'll be damn satisfied- and DRUNK!",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

S - Sweet malt aroma, with dark caramel hints and some perceived alcoholic esters that are very attractive. Some mild yeast character as well as some phenols can be perceived. Very attractive smell.  T - Very attractive malty sweetness with some grain finish. Sourdough bread comes to mind. The alcohol warmth is felt rapidly and is very attractive. There is some very mild perceived bitterness at the back end. The phenols in the nose aren't as present in the tongue. There is some yeasty flavors as well.  M - Nice smooth and creamy mouthfeel with some nice CO2 character like most Belgian beers. Very nice and warming. Nice for the winter months.  D - Very high except for the higher ABV.

259,1708,Stimack,4.47,"Was able to pick this brew up in my last trip to the store. Had been looking for it for a while but just had not been carried. The brew pours to a deep murky brown color with a small to medium tan had that has a creamy consistence, good retention and has left a fair amount of lacing. The aroma of this brew is a nice mix of malts, dark fruit (Plums and cherries) , candy sugar and a yeast slurry. Really inviting aromas for this one. Has a excellent favor, malts come through here and make a great base, slight caramel flavor. Fruit seems to be there - raisons, plums and slight cherry flavors. Slight port like flavor that really goes well with everything, seems to linger a bit on the tongue - excellent. Some sweetness is there that is real nice, candy sugar, and is not over the top. Has a slight spice to it as well. This one drinks very well, goes down smooth, can't believe that it is 10+%. Overall this is a simply excellent brew, I really can not see a major flaw with anything.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,BARFLYB,4.4,"11.2oz bottle into a St. Bernardus Tulip late at night. Review numero 550.  Bernie 12, rustic burnt wood brown and spots of faded orange around the sides. Parts of the liquid look darker than others while the upper half has a dirty tap water thing going for it, I like it. Floating particles of Belgium yeast among other things in suspension. Even with the aggressive pour the yield of dark ivory foam comes to 1/2 an inch. Old cobweb lacing that does not stick at all. I expected a bumpier head with mountain peaks.  Twelves' nose is muted in distance with a less than pungent effect but what's there is good, you just gotta sniff it out. Possibly the best nose out of all the Belgium Quad's IMO, Bernie spits forth sweet sugar out the ying yang with a candi like sweetness. Turbinado sugar, plums, slight caramel/toffee mix, toasted malt, more dark fruit, and more suga on top. Some melted chocolate in the finish.  12 is well rounded and while the sweet sugar is very prevalent in the nose, it does not make for a cloying mess, this melds almost perfectly. Candi sugar graciously sprinkled on top of a bed of plums with caramel covered apple slices. This is very light on the raisins and I'm grateful. Toasted malt and the huge amount of yeast and particles made for a bready/doughy. Did I mention that the 10.5% does not come into play at all, this drinks more like 6.8%.  The feel is smooth like baby skin with a sweet start, a fruity middle, and a yeasty ending, I might as well call it a 'happy ending' cause the alcohol presence is zilch. Not hot at all, it's actually amazing. I thought I was drinking iced tea in the summer. The feel is a strong medium with just enough carb to not linger, but enough to showcase the flavors.  Let's face it, everytime I have a small bottle of this, I always kick myself for not getting the 750ml version for two reasons, one being that I just have a craving for more and this is easy drinking. Two being that there is no way to not get the dregs/yeast of a small bottle into your glass, trust me, I've tried on several occasions. I would like to fill two snifters of 12, the 1st being a clean quad, with the 2nd being a dirty pour, I expect the differences to be slight but noticeable.  This is a beer that everybody needs to try once. I try to have at least two every year. This may be my favorite out of the St. Bernardus lineup but it's in a tight race with the Pator 8, that stuff is also excellent.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,220emaple,4.42,"The thing that I love about this beer is the almost hidden alcohol flavor. It's 10.5% but can pass as 7%.  The color is a very dark, murky brown. The head ends quickly and has very little lacing when poured into my tulip.  Very drinkable but unfortunately expensive--best for special occasions.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Longhorn22,4.62,"A - This beer doesn't look very appealing. I gave it a 3.5 because after i poured it, the head lasted until I finished drinking it. The lacing was very thick, and there was a little ""iceberg"" of floating froth left for most of the drinking ""experience"". The drawback is that the beer is medium dark brown and murky looking.  S - The smell is not very powerful, but the actual scent is good. It just isn't especially strong. It smells sweet and subtle, which is an achievement with the high alcohol content.  T - The taste is great. This is truly a world class beer in terms of taste. It is remarkably sweet, and barely any taste of alcohol. It sort of has a lambic berry taste to it, but it isn't as strong as a lambic. It has some darker nutty/smoky flavor as well.  M - The beer has a good amount of carbonation, and it feels very considerable in your mouth, yet, it goes down very easily. It has a little over 10% alcohol, but I wouldn't have noticed had it not been clearly stated on the front.  D - This gets top marks for drinkability because it is so smooth while having such a high alcohol content. I have a harder time finishing a bud light than this beer.  Bottom line: This beer is sweet, strong, and smooth with a high alcohol content that you wouldn't expect with the amazing flavor. The flavor and drinkability are top notch, and the only draw back is the appearance.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Too much for a small review.  F/D: Yep it's a quad. Not for the faint of heart. Big on the mouth and a lot to swallow. I would drink this everyday if I could.

The taste is much better than the smell. Exceptional flavor of spices, dark fruit and, yes a tiny bit of banana and vanilla.

The green apple disappears and is replaced with booze, caramel, some clove esters and oxidized alcohols, a bit of banana as well. Musty wooden crates.  Creamy smooth mouthfeel until the clove and alcohol spice sets in on the finish. Soft booze presence on the palate, but an ecstatically pleasant booze buzz after even the first swallow.

The bready artisanal malts and Belgian yeast flavors are dominant, but there is a ton of nuance here ranging from candy sugar to cocoa to dried dark fruit to some faint stale hops. Incredibly delicious and incredibly complex.  M- A nice firm, creamy body with a metaphoric ""velvet blanket"" of soft carbonation.

I bought a bottle of this nearly a year ago and haven't thought about opening it until the other night, when I did just that. Caged and corked 750 ml bottle split with some reluctant friends.  Pours a dark, coca-cola color with a huge tan three finger cap. Retention of the head is decent, and it leaves some nice lacing. Surprised by the intensity of the carbonation.  The nose is really fruity, more so than I ever imagined. I get a weird strawberry like aroma, and it looks like other reviewers are picking up the same. Sweet and bready malts up front, with a spicey character, and a light hop aroma.  Dark fruits dominate the taste, and that odd strawberry aroma isn't in the taste. Sour raisins, dates and prunes, sweet and doughy malts and a lingering spiceyness. Very Belgian and very malty.  Medium to heavy bodied, with a smooth and crisp texture. Carbonation is a bit high, but I don't think it takes away from the taste at all. Alcohol is totally hidden, making drinkability great.  A world class Quad for sure, there is no doubt about that.

What this beer lacks in the nose is made up on the tongue. The taste melts in the middle of the mouth and lingers to perfection.  M: Nice carbonation lifts some of the flavor off the tongue and keeps this from felling too heavy. Body is fairly heavy, but lightened by the carbonation.  D: This is the second time I've had this and am way more impressed this time. Maybe it's because the winter suits this better than the summer.

259,1708,BeerFMAndy,4.96,"750 ml cork and caged bottle poured into a tulip. 10% ABV, Serve between 52-56°F  A - The clear crimson brown beer pours into the glass, filling with with a dirty pond water color that's topped by an effervescent, loose off-white head. Legs drip down the glass following the foam but lace is surprisingly absent.  S - With plenty of dark fruitiness, St. Bernardus Abt 12 embodies the Quad style to a T, filling the aroma with candied raisins, plum and dried pear wedge. Suggestions of yeasty spice bring notes of clove, faint pepper, and a sprinkle of brown sugar sweetness on the finish before rich malt undertones give the beer it's necessary bready body and warming alcohol presence.  T - Almost entirely hop-absent, Abt 12 has a warming boozy beginning that brings the bready malt character into the picture before quickly shifting to it's overly dark fruit flavor that focuses on Sun Maid raisin with candied plum and a kiss of maple syrup swetness.  M - The effervescent, highly carbonated texture of this beer is not only burp-inducing but also serves to alleviate some of the rich and full-bodied malt presence in this quad. Warming alcohol does the same, drying out the mildly sweet finish nicely while leaving some of the dark fruity presence on the palate.  O - St. Bernardus Abt 12 is said to be the exact recipe of Westy 12, brought from Westvleteran to this location to be their ""commercially produced"" and accessible brew. Equally as orgasmic, these Belgian quads beg to be sipped and pondered as their depth and complexity are quite incredible. Or, if you're a heretic, slam that shit and get drunk during pass over.

Poured the abt in a Westvleteren chalice. When i compare it with the Westy 12 i notice that the head is not as firm as the head from the Westy. The colour is also a bit lighter.  The first sip was ok but not as good as the Westy. After that first sip my taste became better and i drank the abt with a lot of pleasure.  The alcohol is strong in this one. After i had finished the bottle i felt the alcohol in my body (and head).  This is a VERY good quadrupel but i can't match the Westy 12 and the Rochefort 10.

Stuff sniffing around, imma dive in to this bad boy!!  Impressive flavour. Again, heaps of the fruitiness and clove. Definite caramel and light toffee flavours. Get that belgian yeast taste near the end followed by a boozy finish. Fine for the alcohol level and style though. On a side note, the sweet boozy alcohol warmth lasts for ages.

Perhaps some red currants as well. A delight for the olfactory system.  T: Cherries again, but mostly of the dark variety. Taste doesn't change that much for me through the sip, stays pretty consistent and fades a bit. Doesn't have the somewhat bitter aftertaste of the 3 Philosopher's which is nice.  M: A bit lighter than what I was expecting, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Carbonation is right where it should be.  D: Quite high. I could easily polish off another.  The smell was the highlight of this brew for me. Would have liked to give it a 4.75 and the taste a 4.25, so I compromised on my scores.

259,1708,brokensail,4.35,"A: The pour is a cloudy dark mahogany color without much head to speak of.  S: Good but not great aromas of sweet malt, caramel, and yeast. There might be a touch of alcohol as well.  T: I was a bit let down by the aroma, but the flavor does quite well to redeem itself. A slight warming feel of alcohol goes well with some dark fruits and sweet, caramel malt. The yeast is not as quite prominent as many other Belgian beers.  M: Even with the high level of carbonation, the body is still quite full.  D: The alcohol makes itself known more in terms of the subtle warmth it provides the beer but isn't aggressive by any means. The flavors are sweet but balanced and are helped out by the carbonation.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Sweet bready, yeasty aroma with some alcohol.  Flavor is rich and complex. Yeasty, bready, with some spice, fruity notes, and a bit of alcohol. Alcohol is relatively well hidden considering it's sitting at 10.5%, but it's still there.  Mouthfeel is amazing, rich, creamy and smooth, low carbonation with a flavorful finish.  An amazing, delicious brew that is one of my favorites. Wish I could afford to drink this regularly. Oh, and this monk packs a punch!",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Smelled of nice cakey yeast, fresh bread, biscuits  Tasted very similar to aroma, a great biscuit flavor, some caramel flavors, some alchohol, but I sipped this one slowly and let it warm a bit in my mouth before drinking and I don't think the booze was as noticeable as some others have said.  Overall not too much carbonation - but seemed on point for the style - a good quad and one that would recommend at that.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

A: Very dark, lace froth left on the glass edges, poured with only a little bit of head.  S: Smelled a little bit like red velvet cake, faintly sweet, and almost cakey.  T: Fairly sweet, not very bitter, I detected some fruitiness, with cherries being the most predominant.  M: Light carbonation and creamy, somewhat velvety.  D: Would definitely have another, very drinkable.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Bisho,4.2,Good quad but unfortunately not quite near the top of the class like The Rochefort 10 or Gouden Carolus Emperor Blue.  The flavor is good but the alcohol is overpowering and always present which is a little distracting. I do prefer this one slightly chilled as there is a little too much alcohol burn which spoils the drinkability when it warms.  Note: Do not believe the hype that this is the same beer as Westvleteren 12. It may be of the same recipe but is not of the same class!,Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Old fashion front label design with the image of a smiling monk holding a glass of the brew. Lengthy note on the back with historic touches covering the main characteristics of the beer, including some general serving indications. The label indicates to ""see top"" for freshness date but the top (cork, cover, neck...) is absent of any date. Shows only Alc. by Vol. (10%) Poured into a snifter.  A - Deep brown with ruby edges with a frothy head, with great retention and a rather nice lace on the glass.  S - Malt sweetness, Belgium yeast tones over dark fruits and a sugary sense.  T - Assertive malty sweet malty flavor with a fruity range and a tad of spices. Alcohol booziness only emerges as it warms up.  M - High carbonation for a medium body that works rather smoothly, with even a creamy feel under the tingly bubbly texture.  D - It is rather drinkable, a great sipper, although it does not feel like a tremendously complex or layered quad.  Notes: A very nice quad/dubbel, and somewhat underrated? Mmmm, lacks a minor kick to make it a total favorite but there is not a trace of displeasure in drinking this one.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Nose- Dark fruits, yeasty spiciness (predominately clove) and tons of caramel.  Palate- A raisiny sweetness is the first thing that hits. Cherries and figs are easily picked out of the stone fruits. The Belgian yeast twang cannot be missed and closely mimics the nose. Caramel is apparent along with the alcoholic warming.  Mouthfeel- Full bodied, high, creamy carbonation.

Having 36 beers on tap is like walking into a candy store. St. Bernardus Abt 12 is on tap and sold in the store but getting this on tap was more than a treat. This is silky, mysterious, dark delicious brew that is hard to compare anything to as it is in a class all its own. At 10.50% you need to go easy on this but I could easily drink a growler of this beauty. Mixing a well balanced carbonation with sweet dark spicey clove and slightly dry end to finish makes this one of my new favorites at the bar, thanks Matt Lonardo, co-owner for this find!",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Creamy caramel & toffee, sweet malt, dried plums, figs with hint of sweet orange citrus. High alcohol contect is apparent but not over powering. A very complex & smooth dark brune.  M) Ample carbonation -- just perfect & actually feels mild, yet yields in excess of 10% ABV. This is strong stuff but so smooth. Warms but does not burn... a finely crafted Quad.  D) St. Bernardus consistently produces a quality product. ABT 12 is in a class of its own. This is a fine beer -- but beware it's strong.

The entry in the mouth is a drought of toast, only then the flavors of fruit soaked in alcohol and coconut are emerging. Finish of roasted malt.

The aromas are powerful and well delineated focused on spices, nuts, and dried fruits. The flavor follows up on the nose with some nutty notes added to the spice, dried fruit (like dried figs, prunes, currants). Great texture and lovely balance. Hints of sweetness. The only thing keeping it from a 5 on mouthfeel was that I hoped for a touch more astringency. Very smooth and drinkable. The alcohol is well masked by the powerful flavors.  Overall one of my favorite beers of all time.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Minotaur,4.75,"I've it on tap and in bottle; this is reviewed at the time drinking a bottle.  Deep deep mahogany with a half inch head that endures. You could draw a monk face in it. Dense and almost opaque except at the very edge.  The aroma is fruity, prune, yeasty almost sour but with a constant candi-sugar malt aroma. The tang of the hops balances the massive malt.  Woodsy, bourbon, seep sugar flavor. But despite the darkness and depth the slight bit of sour bitterness hits th back of the tongue and balances. There is a hint of grape, apple and raisin. The bitterness increases down the chalice and as the beer warms. Bread and yeast come through with just the slightest hint of stray funkiness. Despite the heavy weight nature of the twelve there is little predominant alcohol aftertaste. But it is warming like a liquer. There is a hint of the bitterness taking over the malts towards the end of the glass but with this level of malt it could easily become syrup.  The mouthfeel is smooth but not thick. The carbonation seems to offset the overall smoothness a tiny bit. On draft I recall the flavors melding with a little less carbonation.  The head, nose and lacing remains strong through out the goblet. All the sensory impact of this beer lends it to be very drinkable. Dare I say, addictive.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Too much, want to smell this all day.  T- Baking spices/cloves right away, belgian yeast is delicious, candied fruits, dates, cherries, and those roasted nuts followed by some nice light cocoa notes. Everything in the smell is followed in the taste, very good.  M- Still plenty of carbonation in this bad boy, almost too much, but it is a very nice fine carbonation that tingles your tounge showing its aging potential. You can't even tell that this has any alcohol in it, very well hidden.  D- Very nice, just starting to feel some of the effects of the alcohol that is lurking within this one.

Tingles the tongue with lots of carbonation. The bottle says you can age up to 15 years and i'm sure it could do nothing but improve this one.  Drinkability, this one is a sipper for sure.

259,1708,Pahn,4.74,"1 pt 9.4 oz bottle into a Duvel tulip.  Appearance: Careful pour yields a fizzy 1 inch head that dissipates slowly. Color is a deep reddish brown. Bits of yeast sediment present. Spotty lacing.  Smell: Full-bodied smell of Belgian yeast, clove, grass, leather, raisin, some phenol. More going on than I can get in one whiff, and stays strong throughout. The smell says: you're about to taste a strong Belgian ale.  Taste: Even bigger than the smell. Starts smooth and creamy with mild esters and grassiness, then explodes into a spicy, hoppy assault of flavor. All the elements present in the aroma and more (banana, caramel, various other spices and fruits) make themselves known as the flavor intensifies then transitions into a long, alcohol warm finish that lasts a good 60 seconds or more. This beer is clearly meant to be sipped and savored. Despite the spice and complexity, the beer retains a pleasant sweetness from start to finish. The flavor doesn't stop; this is a perfected quad.  Mouthfeel: Smooth and creamy with prickly carbonation and drawn out alcohol warmth.  Drinkability: This isn't a beer to pound, obviously, but I could sip it indefinitely.  ---  Why did I wait so long to try this renowned quad? Everything about this beer is beautiful. I like Trappistes Rochefort 10 a bit better... mainly due to some differences in the taste and mouthfeel, but really both are perfection. There is nothing about this beer that disappoints. It's the kind of beer where, if you don't like it, you need to ask yourself what you were doing drinking a quadrupel in the first place. It is an exemplary quad.  Final note: not that I need to say this (as it's written on the bottle), but this beer is *begging* to be aged. Huge complexity right off the shelf plus strong carbonation plus high ABV plus a bigger hoppiness than most Belgian strong ales equals this beer couldn't be anything but amazing with a few years of age on it.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

A- A 330ml bottle poured into my Trappistes Rochefort chalice reveals a dark brown body with some reddish-orange hues when held up to a light, some suspended floaties as well. 2 fingers of creamy tan head that slowly fades to leave a fairly thick layer on top. The chalice is coated with lots of lushy lace.  S- I absolutely love the smell of this, so complex and warming. Rum soaked raisins, plum, fig, lots of dark fruit. There's some spice in here as well, most noticeable is the clove. A little bready & yeasty. Candied sugar, bubblegum and a touch of the alcohol round this one out.  T- Again, loads of dark fruit, sweet malt, belgian spice, and candied sugar. This does finish fairly warm from the booze. Really complex, I can't do it justice.  M- A rich creamy and smooth full bodied abbey ale. It sticks to the mouth long after it's gone.  D- You sip this not because you have to but rather you do because you want to savor every last drop of this heavenly goodness.

A: This, when poured into a pint glass, produced some nice head, roughly 1-1 1/2 inch head, with steady head through out the drink which lead to outstanding lacing. The beer color itself was a nice muddy brown, with a fair bit of bottle yeast.  S: The smell of the beer was very aromatic to say the least. The smell of fruits was very present, but there was an overwhelming, a good overwhelming smell of hops.  T: This beer was outstanding. I didn't want my drink to end, but wanted to drink more and more of it. The taste itself was warming to my tongue, with a sort of citrus aftertaste that softened to a nice relaxed, almost vanilla flavor.  M: The mouthfeel was fullbodied and perfect for consumption.  D: If this beer wasn't so expensive per bottle (5.00 for a 11.2 FL OZ), I'd be all over this like white on rice. However, because of the price, I'd have to rate it slightly below exceptional, however since this is one of the lowest parts of the scale, I felt that it was more than alright to do so.  Overall, this beer is outstanding, with out a doubt. I found myself taking smaller drinks each time to try and savor the flavor and to push myself to find new flavor notes.

Mouthfeel was full with some heat and a fruity sweetness. Finish was juicy, sweet, raisiny. Why did I let The Chauffeur talk me into this? Too good to be true.  WHAAT?!? That miserable review was from my visit, with The Chauffeur, to Capital Ale House in Richmond, VA back in June 2008 at the outset of our month together. I will claim partial non-compus mentus on that one in return for today's (M, 14 December 2020) review.  I had my eye on the 4-pack that included a chalice for some time & during today's visit to the Friendly Greek Bottle Shop (FGBS), I decided to pull the trigger, even if it was all Bottles (uh oh!).  From the Bottle (my my!): ""Abt 12 Abbey Ale""; ""02[-]07[-]24"".  I am getting a sense of their aging/shelf life from this indulgence, at least. Next came my Pop!ping of the cap, followed by a slow, gentle C-Line pour into the awaiting chalice. I got just better than two fingers of dense, foamy. light-tan head with great retention for my efforts. Color was Very Dark Brown to Black/Opaque (SRM = > 34, < 44), although closer to 34 with its NE-quality clarity & ruby highlights. Nose smelled like the alcohol-soaked cherries currently being marketed! 8=O I love cherries & I dig alcohol, but they are dangerous little cherry bombs (or so I've heard). Would this be equally dangerous? Mouthfeel was big & full, like a dollop of cherry-vanilla ice cream had been scooped into my mouth & onto my tongue. 8=O No wonder The Chauffeur liked this. The taste was a little more subtle than the nose had led me to gird myself for. Yes, it was still plenty cherry-like, but it was neither as alcohol-driven nor as sweet as I had been led to expect. Phew. It was entirely too easy-drinking, though. Lacking a perceptible alcohol presence or even a real sweetness, I was cruising right along, drinking through it like it was an N-A beer until I glanced at its label. Eeek! It was like being behind the wheel of a T-bird, pedal to the metal without a care until you realize that you are flying at ~ 100 per! 8=O WAY too easy to drink! Finish was semi-sweet, right on the cusp of semi-dry, but just a wee tad too sweet to call ""dry"". I now feel compelled to buy the mix pack!

Appearance: A two finger head that has some retention, the head is creamy foamy and light tan in color. The color of the beer is a rich dark brown color with rusty hues. The clarity of beer is mostly opaque with yeast floating around. There is some carbonation coming from the bottom of the glass. The head left lacing on the glass.  Nose: A very rich complex bread, yeast, and toasted malt aroma. A light spice profile with aromas of cloves, oak, bananas, a mild solvent, phenols, floral, and orange.  Taste: A very rich malt flavors that encompass yeast and toasted bread. The flavors are white pepper, cloves, bananas, oak, phenol, solvent, oranges, grapefruit, and floral bouquet.  Overall: The mouth feel is strong alcohol warming, carbonation, and slightly astringent. The body of the beer is medium with a full finish. This beer is on steroids the flavors just blow up in your mouth and yet it is pleasant to drink. I have only review a few quads and this is one of the better ones that I have tried. I was in fear that since the bottle erupted on me that it was going to compromise the beer's flavor, nonetheless, I feel that it has, but it still it very good.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,callmescraps,4.38,"I'm actually reviewing this one for a second time. The first was when I was a newbie and basically a complete moron. This time I'm just kind of a moron.  Appearance - Very deep amber/but brown as it pours into my awesome new Westy chalice. A nice thin cap of foam head settles in, possibly for the duration.  Smell - Rich and hearty malt. Rum soaked raisins. A hint of funky yeast. Definitely some vanilla. Also some dark fruits, plum especially. Quite nice.  Taste - Follows the smell wonderfully. Wow, I can't believe I didn't appreciate this the first time around. Definitely those dark fruit, but less raisin and more plum. Possibly chocolate covered. It's pleasantly sweet. The malt is balanced out by the booze, and the yeast. Black bread and maybe a little nuttiness.  Mouthfeel - Maybe the best part of this beer. Rich and creamy, with very nice carbonation. A pleasure.  Drinkability- Quite good. It is a little heavy, so a 750 would be a bit much. But it's a great sipper.  Wow, re-reviewing this beer makes me realize how far I have come. I can't believe I couldn't appreciate how excellent it was the first time around (I gave it a B). A real pleasure.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,bismarksays,4.97,"It was served to me with a nice finger of head which lingered above the beer which had a dark brown almost chocolate like color. The nose was spicy (clove?) with hints of sweet fruit (raisin and plum perhaps). The taste is both biscuity, spicy, and sweet all at once. Although there is an alcohol presence, it is not over the top, but rather soothing and warming. This is a thick, strong, sweet beer that if you are not careful, could turn into a session beer and lead to questions of what went on the night before. One thing you will not have to question, however, is whether or not this beer is worth its price.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,timrosenblatt,4.8,"Looks awesome. I can't see anything on the other side of my glass. I bet I could safely look at a solar eclipse through this.  It smells sweet. I don't know what it smells like, but I wish I could buy a Glade scent packet with St Bernardus for my living room.  It's nice and tasty. The sweet is there, with some kind of spicy something that comes in halfway through the drink, and stays in my mouth. Someone else said cloves...yeah.  It's too thick to drink on a hot Florida summer day, but right now it is December, and it's down to at least 60 at night.  I gave it a 4 on drinkability, just because I don't think this could be drunk over the course of a whole evening. Then again, I only really need one or two.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,lisaode,4.47,"1 PT bottle poured into a snifter glass  Pretty dark, opaque even. Nice creamy head that still clung to the rim after the glass was empty.  Smelled the yeast and was a bit sweet. Smell was not overwhelming, but still strong.  I taste a lot of cloves and alcohol. Very strong. Kind of a light fruity licorice aftertaste.  Lots of carbonation and a bit tart. Left me smacking my tongue to the roof of my mouth.  I started drinking this after dinner and then went to play Wii, but found that the beer took more of a break because it needed my full attention to drink. There was no way I could gulp this down quickly.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

My roommate said ""It looks like murky creek water"" Shes actually kinda right. Its a muddy garnet colored beer. Despite the cloudiness there are lots of floaty pieces yeast visible in suspension. No head left so that means no lacing either.  S- Big malty aroma. Sourdough, raisins, bread pudding. This is a really great smelling beer.  T- Clove and an almost wine like presence of grape and raisin. Some alcohol astringency on the back end right after a sourdoughy biscuit malt bill.  M- Bubbly and prickly carbonation, full body, finishes dry.  D- The alcohol is there slightly, this is a pretty warming beer.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Solid bready malt backbone that mixes well with the medicinal characteristics. M: Fantastic creaminess to it. D: Stop to savor.  I'm not sure why it took me so long to find this.

Good head that stayed intact for several minutes.  S. Rich fruity smell. Liked dryed dark fruits. Some spices were present as well.  T. This one is good. Somewhat sweet and fruity. Rasins, plums and maybe, just maybe a little apple. I also tasted some molasses.  M. Very carbonated and full bodied. A slightly dry finish. A lovely alcohol warming finish.  D. Like most quadtruples it hides the alcohol well. I could drink several of these without much trouble.

Three fingers of creamy tan head forms, loses a couple of fingers quickly with one clinging on for a good long time. Some sparse but stubborn lacing is left on the glass.  S - Very yeasty smelling, a bit of spice, maybe cloves, some sweet fruity smells, and some spicy hops in the aroma. Not as ""Belgian"" as I expected to get in the aroma. Still smells good, just a bit lower in strength than I expected to get.  T - Where the aroma is a bit subdued - the taste does not follow suit. Flavors jump out of this beer. Lots of bubble gum, cloves, yeast and alcohol, maybe some anise in there too. Alcohol is a bit hot, but I find that to be the case frequently in quads. Very good flavors overall.  M - Full bodied and loaded with carbonation. Carbonation gives a very prickly and almost foamy feel in the mouth. Something other than carbonation is leaving a tingly feeling on my tongue well after the swallow - some kinda spice? Interesting...also this beer leaves my mouth literally watering...something just causes the saliva to flow - almost the same effect as hot peppers...unusual - can't recall another beer with this effect.  D - Quads in general are tough for me in the drinkability category. Lots of alcohol that tends to be on the hot side...not at all subtle. This is no exception. Definitely a sipper. Has good flavor and aroma and is a really pretty beer, but one is definitely enough in a sitting. Very good, but tough to drink a lot of.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Liverpool08,4.42,"Pours a deep muddy ruby brown, with a nice tan/off white head. Aroma of dried fruits, rasins, oranges, and cherries. Also a nice malty aroma. Taste is just what you would expect. A malty smoothness followed by dark cherries and fig sweetness. Although it has a high ABV its very well hidden and makes this a real nice multi-sipper if you take your time. Make sure to let it warm a little as this will really bring out the great flavors of this beer!!",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Phenolic characters uncharacteristic compared to other Quads. Faint hop aroma.  T - Malt complexity soon overwhelmed by fig and dark fruit palate overload. Phenolic profile of various herbs and spices unique to Abt 12's nostalgia. Well balanced with a dry finish of intense flavors and palate overload.  M - Creamy body with high carbonation. Warming from ABV is subdued by matured palate.  D - What many consider one of the quintessential beers, and quite possibly the closest thing to Westveterlan 12.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Smells of dark fruits raisins prunes fig come to mind. Also has a sweet dark sugar and molasses aroma as well. Twinge of alcohol evident too. Taste is sweet with dark fruits, molasses, brown bread, melanoidin and alcohol. Carbonation is high, mouthfeel is full and sticky sweet, body is thick. I liked this one, but I thought the alcohol was a little to present. Good, but maybe needs some age to mellow it out a bit.

Wonderfully intense and lush.  T - Black bread, caramel, browned apples, raisins, and fig. There's also a nutty quality from the yeast. There's a lovely molasses-tinged sweetness that never manages to become cloying. Little hop flavor - what there is tends toward the earthy side - and mild to moderate hop bitterness. A touch of warming alcohol isn't surprising or unwelcome in a beer of this heft. Despite all this, the beer manages to pull off an airy, ethereal presence on the palate.  M - Full, rich, and creamy.

259,1708,BedetheVenerable,4.15,"Presentation: Snifter, poured on tap; thanks to Stanford at Sycamore for the sample on the house (and the first couple of glasses out of the keg)...much appreciated!!  Appearance: Dark hazy walnut beer with a nice light tan cap with good retention  Smell: Sweet cotton candy, dried cherries, and light candied fruit...some slight Belgian yeastiness in the background...overall, ""sweet"", ""soft"", and ""fruity"" are the three best adjectives for this beer's aroma.  Taste: Lots of spicy/fruity Belgian yeast, vibrant fruitiness, light candy sugar notes, and a touch of cinnamon round this out. This is sweet and mellow to the extreme; you have NO idea you're drinking a 10%+ beer. The flavors meld together to form more of a broad picture than jumping out at you individually. Also, the malt seems a bit more subdued than I remember it being in the bottled version. Bliss.  Mouthfeel: On the light side of medium-bodied; supremely drinkable, which is even more remarkable considering the abv  Drinkability: High  Conclusion: This is crazy soft, supple, fruity, and delicious. Glad I got to try it on tap!.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Appearance: Poured with an inch of head, which may or may not be due to the bottle being a gusher as noted above. Color is a dark ruby, which looks amazing.  Smell: Hints of candied fruit and spices. Smells a little boozy, but not overly powerful.  Taste: AMAZING. The above mentioned fruit really comes through with this. I'm also picking up spices and malt. Very balanced.  Mouthfeel: Silky smooth on my tongue.  Drinkability: I had high hopes going into tasting this beer and it did not disappoint.

259,1708,scootny,4.38,"I unfortunately had the 60th anniversary before this one so I am tainted by what may be the best quad this side of a Westy 12. That being said this is one hellova beer. A ruddy brown fluid with garnet hues and bit in susupension. The light tan head leaves tons thick lace and never full goes away.  Smell is rich and fruity with a deep caramel malt and notes of chocolate and coffee. Dark fruits abound and each sniff reveals lovely layers of complex blending. A burgundy like undertone flows subtly through.  Taste is a continuation of the nose. Dark malty sweetness and mocha. Intense fruitiness. Belgian yeastiness brings an overripe banana into the fold. A tannic component shows up and flexes, especially in the finish. It leaves a leather like dryness on the palate. Burgundy and alcoholic heat gently fold in on the edges of your tongue. Feel is velvety with a lightly creamy carbonation. While the OG carries some weight the fluid is supple as it flows around the mouth.  Drinkability is quite good for the abv. A good all night sipper that goes down easier than it should.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

The flavor is a super smooth mix of malt, candied fruit, cinnamon toast, citrus, slight chocolate, and a kiss of hops. WOW!  The feel rich and smooth. Has some bite to it with above average carbonation.  Overall this a fantastic beer. I can see why it gets so much praise.

Huge complexity here, but I am clearly getting raisins, plum, cherry, amaretto, fresh-baked bread, and a hint of alcohol. Flavor is complex as well. Sweet and fruity up front with unripe cherry, amaretto, and caramel malt. Alcohol is definitely noticeable at the beginning and in the finish, but not offensive, and gives an immediate warming feeling that is quite pleasant. I'm not a big fan of alcohol flavor, but this is quite enjoyable. Carbonation is high tickling the tongue and body is medium. Overall, a delicious beer.

259,1708,flagmantho,4.31,"Poured from 750mL bottle into a tulip.  Appearance: highly opaque dark tawny brown. Enormous four-finger head which, while very nice, will make this difficult to drink.  Smell: the first thing I notice is that it is quite grainy. There are some fruit aromas, notably plum, but mostly grain. As it warms, I get more of the nice fruit aromas than grain; it's good, but aroma is Abt 12's weak point for me.  Taste: malty, grainy and full of dark fruity flavors. I'm glad to say it is significantly better than the aroma, but, frankly, that wouldn't take much. Fruit concentration is plums and raisins. As the beer warms the fruit complexity gets much broader and deeper: I get some pear, some cherry; really, it's quite delicious.  Mouthfeel: medium body with a fantastic carbonation. It is supple and velvety; perfectly divine. I love it.  Drinkability: a nice flavor profile combined with an out-of-this-world texture make this a deceptively drinkable beer, despite its incredible ABV.

It sticks around a while as a thin cap, but by the end of the glass is gone, save for a few wisps of cirrus clouds on the surface. Only a bit of lacing remains.  I love the smell of this beer. This is actually the beer that really got me started on craft beer. Thus, it is very nostalgic for me. I will attempt to be as impartial as possible. The aroma is beautiful and complex, with raisins, prunes, figs, sweet malt, and a bit of alcohol shining through. It's very similar to Westy 12, but brighter and more explicitly fruity.  Taste followed the nose. Sweet dark fruits, rum-soaked raisins, some noticeable boozy heat (that does not detract).  The mouthfeel starts off just a little too carbonated for my liking, which reduces the score just a notch. But about halfway through the beer, it's perfect. Thick, chewy, full, it dances on your palate.  Drinkability is fantastic for the style. If I didn't have to work in the morning, I might go have one or two more.

M - full, velvety smooth (especially for a beer only moderately dark), with a very fine tingle  D - really should be a sipping beer, but I find no need to be reserved about quaffing it.

S: Valorous sweetness, cocoa + dark fruits is what it was first described to me as and I pick up on that. Alcohol is there, small amounts of spice, other unrecognizable dark colored matter!  T: Taste much like the aroma...a good sweetness that cannot be described right away, I'll give it the cliche ""it's complex"" taste line. The alcohol isn't masked but works wonderfully as I am struggling to figure out what dominates the flavor of this beer. It's sweet, but not overly, glimpse of hops in the finish.

259,1708,jlindros,4.75,"Easily one of my top 5 beers of all time, the St Bernardus Abt 12 is what put me on the map for Belgian beers. I drink it on special occasions usually, and its pretty cheap for the amazingness of the beer. And having the availability it has, its awesome. Well, today marks the special occasion of needing some yeast for a homebrew, and I decided to culture the bottled yeast from this awesomeness. This bottle also has been sitting in the cellar for a year or so getting yeasted up to hell. Also, why not drink it. This just happens to be the first time I'm drinking it while sitting in front of a computer and can log it into BA. Anyways, enough with the Stahlin and drink it already.  A: Huge loud pop sound goes the weasel, I mean cork. Steamy mist of Pandora blazes out the top. Pouring into my Corsendonk tulip glass reveals a large 3 finger semi dark head that is pretty thin and full of large bubbles that pop so fast, its down to 2 fingers in a mere 10 seconds! Then leaves an airy pot-marked frothy mess that would make Courtney Love blush!. The light dark colored head is down to a light covering in not time flat! The dark raisin colored brown lets just enough light through to reveal the secret of the Nymph, as well as the huge amounts of yeast and sediment dancing around inside as if they are at the dance, getting prepped to mate soon!  N: Yep, thats the aroma all right! Some dark malts, mostly Belgian style, some raisiny fruit flavors, perhaps some fig aromas as well. Some light nuttiness and perhaps cinnamon tickle the nose. However, a touch of alcohol and sweet dark Belgian candi sugars fill out the back bone of the nose. It's not overpowering either. A slight yeast tones down the final touches, but the delicious raisiny Belgian candi sugar and alcohol really just bring the aromas into so much awesomeness.  T: Tasting such an awesome beer is almost unworthy of.... glug glug glug... mmmppphhfff.... starts right off with more awesome raisiny Belgian candi sugar and some alcohol tastes right off the bat. Who woulda thunk? Delicious Belgian malts sit around the mouth in a nice thick mouth. A very slight Belgian yeast flavor adds some fruitiness as well, more than just the raisin. A slight spice, like cinnamon and some nuttiness cuts through the malt flavors like a raptor's claw through that guys stomach in that movie. I get some deeper fruits as well, perhaps plum or snozzberry. Some thick molasses and more candi sugar come back again towards the finish of the taste. Some alcohol burn and warmth adds a nice touch, which has really kicked into overdrive with the bottle aging  M: Pretty thick and heavy, sweet and syrupy, its almost so thick my tongue is weighing itself down and almost out of my mouth. It's filling up my taste buds so much they can't taste much else after. Then a slight alcohol burn reminds you how heavy the beer is when it comes to abv! Decent carbonation for the bigness of the beer, actually is really high!  F: Finishes with a slight sweetness but seems to dry off pretty well considering all the age its had. A slight alcohol warmth and sting singes for a bit, then disappears enough to let you get more of the raisin, cinnamon, candi sugar, molasses, and delicious other flavors. Perhaps if anything, the aging has formed a little too much carbonation. I get some earthy flavors as well, on the finish mostly, I think a product of the yeast turning the Belgian candi sugar into the ginourmous alcohol.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

I tasted this back to back to a Rochefort 10 and I thought this beer was a much better offering as it provided a more balanced mouthfeel. Great, great beer.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Flightoficarus,4.65,"Serving type - 11.2 oz bottle into glass  Appearance - This one pours a deep, rich mahogany color, with a huge foam head that lasts several minutes. After it subsides, it leaves a nice, thick lacing around the glass. This beer means business.  Smell - Brown sugar, Belgian Candi, Molasses, dark fruit (cherries, raisins).  Taste - Lots of dark fruit, with moderate spiciness. Sweet, rich malts with a flavor like that of the smell. Hidden alcohol, minimal hops. Complex, and absolutely delicious.  Mouthfeel - Rich, creamy, and full bodied (expected for a beer of this ABV). Makes you want to savor each sip.  Drinkability - Deceptively drinkable for it's ABV, but it's still a sipper.  Overall - A great example of this style, and one of my personal favorite beers. Highly recommended!",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,mirish72,4.2,"Poured into a Chimay goblet after a 10-15 minute warm up period on the counter.  Pours a mahogeny red with visible yeast throughout the beer. One finger head with nice lacing.  Has a sweet aroma, smells of fruit and spices. I could smell this one when I opened the beer and it was almost wine like. There was a good deal of carbonation to start with.  Tastes like it smells, and it got smoother as it settled. There is a dry finish and nice balance overall. Hides the 10.5% ABV well and was very drinkable.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

259,1708,BillyBoysPie,4.75,"On tap at the Nachbar, Louisville, KY - poured in a St. Bernardus Chalice.  Dark ruby/garnet color, beautiful pale/light tan head about half an inch thick. The head retention was slim, typical for a high alcohol beer. Lacing covered the entire glass when I had finished. Quite beautiful.  Smell of spices and dried figs. Some malt presence, but not overpowering the complexity (and main interest) of the dried fruit/spice character. No heavy notes of alcohol, but it is present on the palate.  Taste is quite what one would expect from the smell - rich dried fruits and spice dominate the flavor with malts and a touch of bitter to finish the flavor. I don't really feel the alcohol at all, and drinking this over the course of 30 minutes didn't have any effect.  Well balanced mouthfeel - the carbonation offsets what could have been a boring texture. Nothing overdone in this beer.  I'll be having this again. A delicious Quad that is a great introduction to this style of beer.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Let's give it a try.  A - This beer just came alive again. It has a ton of action and the head is a perfect light tan color and is as frothy as can be. There is allot of suspended yeast here.  S - Sweet cherry aroma with a malt background.  T - The flavors of sweet brown sugar, malt and hint of alcohol.  M - The feel is a bit fizzy. It has allot of action going on which is evident in the texture.  ~ This is a very good brew. It's a beauty and smells just as good as it looks. It seems very complex in the flavors and feel, but I think overall, I will certainly partake in this abby again.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Beer is brown, high haze, white head made up of smallish bubbles, lacing on glass, carbonation mild.  Aroma is very weak and subtle. Some sweetness a little alcohol, no hops or roast.  Beer is full bodied and smooth. Yeasty flavor, tons of malt, some sweetness from the malt / alcohol. This is a really good beer. It is not as good as I remember though. I feel like I've had better quads to date.

259,1708,infi,4.35,"750 mL - best before 24/01/13; bottled on 24/01/08.  Poured into a snifter.  Gentle pour reveals a frothy off-white head about two fingers in width with soapy sheets of fine bubbled lacing on the glass. Great retention time and size. A translucent and reddish mahogany color fills the glass along mini streams of bubbling action. A conglomerate of sediment can be found floating throughout the liquid when held to the glass. There's actually a considerable amount, I don't know whether to be intimidated or amazed. As per the Belgian template, Belgian yeast, candied sugar and caramel are immediately noticeable along with the dark fruity qualities of figs, dark cherries and raisins. There's also the great bready presence of the malt, clove spiciness and slight heat of the booze.  Great intermingling of flavors as you take a sip. Right off the bat is the malt breadiness alongside the dark fruits mixed in quite well. Caramel sweetness smooths out the transition to the end of a mild hop bitterness and clove spiciness. As it warms up, hints of vanilla appear and add to its already pronounced appeal. The alcohol is actually no where to be found in the taste. This exudes great complexity and refinement.  The mouthfeel is light- to medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. Just enough on the tongue with no aggressive feel. The 10.5% ABV is very well hidden - it's not as predominant as the Rochefort 10. Therefore, it's a bit higher on the drinkablity scale. Still a sipper, but not one you would want to intentionally let sit. This is very much enjoyable and flavorful. I can't imagine how much better this could get with a few years on it, let alone it being the next best quad only to Westy 12.  *Originally reviewed on October 24, 2009.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Smells of sweet dark fruit, caramel, molasses, just waiting to be savored. Tastes like it smells ""nectar of the Gods"", I love Quad's but they are well beyond my ability to describe. Mouthfeel is great, smooth, carbonated,sweet, with enough bitterness to balance it all.

The color of the beer is dark brown and when held to the sun you can see the sediment from this unfiltered brew. The head is a light tan color, lighter than I expected.  The aroma of the beer contains hints of spices and figs and a strong smell of caramel malts.  Take a mouthful sip of this beer and enjoy the complexity. Sugary dark fruit and caramel malt up front. Some spicy notes of clove and cinnamon come out in the middle with chocolate malt flavors. Finishes sweet and malty with an emphasis on caramel and dark Belgium yeast character. There is just a hint of hop flavor that produces a mild bitterness that balances the thick malt.  Overall very good brew and I recommend it if you get the chance.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Fron the head, I could tell this beer is well cabonated as I felt the fizz at my nose as a well balanced aroma of dried fig filled the air... Taste was like having a date shake with that earthy aftertaste of figs which I love. Very pleasant aftertaste of caramel as it rushes down the palate along with the 10% ABV and carbonation makes this beer very drinkable... The best part is that this beer gets better with age, up to 15 years.... Awesome",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

259,1708,TheJollyHop,4.28,"Heavenly nectar of the Belgian beer gods! After pouring this dark brown, sticky sweet ale, a large latticework of foam appears and is a prime example of a beer with great head retention. Scents of toffee come to mind. Tastes of dark chocolates, candi sugar, and some nice warming from the alcohol. Also there is some dried fruit and possibly peaches? There is a nice light hop backbone in this chewy, medium/high carbonated ale. It is evident that this beer was produced with the powers of good as the ABV is hidden very well, and it is very nicely balanced as there are no overpowering elements. However, temptation is always nearby. This is a delightfully drinkable beer that demands proper respect. Too much of a good thing could lead to the dark depths of the underworld (or the floor).",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

259,1708,nickfl,4.59,"A - A loud pop upon removing the cork signals a slow gusher that gives me just enough time to begin pouring before the foam escapes the lip of the bottle. It pours with a two finger head of off-white bubbles on top of a clear, reddish brown body. The head settles pretty quickly and leaves thin traces of lace on the glass.  S - A rich aroma of sweet caramel and fruity yeast. Black cherries, figs, sweet chocolate, cloves, and coriander. The fruit notes are full and juicy and work well with the malt.  T - Sugary dark fruit and caramel malt up front. Notes of black cherry, caramel, and toffee. Some spicy notes of clove and cinnamon come out in the middle with milk chocolate malt flavors. Finishes sweet and malty with an emphasis on caramel and dark cherry/plum yeast character. There is just a hint of herbal hop flavor in the finish along with mild bitterness that just barely balances the thick malt. Some darkening of the malt character in the aftertaste with light chocolate and smoke notes.  M - Smooth, moderately thick body, high carbonation, and a slightly sweet finish.  D - This is a true classic and while there are a great deal of varied flavor elements at work here, the yeast is the real star of the show. The malt provides a background of caramel sweetness on which the yeast displays a profound level of juicy, deep fruit character, balanced by lightly spicy notes. The hops make themselves known but only play a supporting role, though they posses a classic spicy, noble character. This beer is extraordinarily well balanced and despite a high alcohol content, it goes down smooth and shows no boozy harshness. If Rochefort is about malty complexity, then this is about yeasty fruit and sublime balance. It is a wonderful, and rare, experience to have a beer that lives up to its hype and as I sip this I realize that I had gone far too long without popping the cork on an ABT 12.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Liquid is a very dark brown with red highlights. Superior in appearance.  Smells of grapes, currants, pear, alcohol, and raw cane sugar. Tastes of grapes, maraschino cherries, and is slightly meaty. Medium in sweetness with a tingly bitter character on the midpalate. Full bodied, though a bit lighter than its brethren, but a nice low-medium level of carbonation (in contrast to the massive head).

Nice lacing and head retention.  Smells of of date bread, raisons, light mulled spice.  Taste is a barrage of spiced dark fruit--figs, dates, prunes. Caramel and molasses work their way in, with a nice bready note from the yeast. Alcohol makes its presence subtly known in the finish. Tasty.  Mouthfeel is extremely creamy. ""Best before"" date is 2014, and I have reason to believe it was aged for quite some time prior to purchase.  Drinkability is fantastic.

S - Big and malty with a nice Belgian yeastiness. Dark chocolate covered dark fruits and nice whiff of spicy alcohol.  T&M - So complex in the taste and incredibly balanced. Tastes very much like the smell which I think adds to the balance as you drink. A touch more caramel malt in the taste on the back of the tongue that I did not pick up on in the smell. Love that malty, dark chocolate taste with a light yeastiness and ripe figs. The alcohol is noticable, especially as it warms, but it really adds a nice spiciness. Not cloying and not overpowering in any ways.  D - I could sip this all night, all day, and always. What a great beer.

From the dark mahogany body topped with a head that you couldn't blow off if you tried, to the finish I'll still be tasting and enjoying tomorrow. Amazingly complex nose of figs, nutmeg, chocolate, cloves, cinnamon and forest fruits. I knew it was gonna be good on the palate but fuck me, this rocks hard. A full flavour that gives sweetness, bitterness, weight, more of the flavours that aroma hinted of and then a few more.

T: Awesome flavor, as it's moderately sweet with the ripe fruit and cloves, and finishing with a slight alcohol warmth - and this really IS slight, for a 10.5% ABV... could've fooled me!  M: Medium-bodied and a creamy texture, with the typical fizzy carbonation that seems to be there with most St. Bernardus beers.

The white wine, figs, dates and caramel malt flavors dominate the profile. I would say this is one of the most complex beers I've tasted.

This is very good for a Quad - although this type of brew is not for me to session.  This brew is a sipper. Not to session, but a very nice taste for a cool night. Has a nice warming effect.

Nice.

In the finish a sweet herbal edge as of aniseeds lingers, as a belated ""re-reminder"" of how well yeasts have interacted with hops and candy sugar. The most surprising fact about the drink is how little alc. my palate has come across! M&D: silky-smooth all way through, the carbonation is tuned to perfection (as far as my palate is concerned) and lifts up the whole body ever so skillfully, while the lack of any sign of alcohol also helps in this regard. The low level of saltiness works so well with the sweet side of overall flavour and the exotic yeastiness is just about moderate - sufficient to make a nice difference...

Hint of alcohol and low hop presence. A bit trappisty if I may say so :) A bit to estery and alcoholic after a couple of sips. I didn't find it well-balanced, it could've been better.  M/D: Thick and creamy. The head was really nice, but disappeared too quickly IMHO. It takes a while to drink, and it's meant to be.

It is an excpetional beer and the only way to get a beer made with this yeast strain, as westvleteren lost it unfortunately. It is a big beer, made for sipping.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,jdg204,4.26,"I was looking for a great brew to go with the big OSU-USC game on Saturday night. I looked through the beer fridge and decided that the time had come for my St. Bern Abt 12 from Abe's Cold Beer in Bethlehem.  A: Dark caramel brown hazy color with a creamy head and lots of lacing. Plenty of sediment at the bottom too.  S: Ripe dark fruits, bananas, earthy soil, and alcohol.  T: Starts out with a touch of sweetness and clove which is followed by the more predominant hoppy bitterness and alcoholic warmth. I was expeciting a few more undertone flavors, but solid overall.  M: Medium bodied but light and fizzy on the tongue. Decent aftertaste.  D: Nice autumn sipping beer and one I'm glad I finally got the chance to enjoy. After this and Rochefort 10, I'm pretty sure I'll never enjoy Quads as much as some, but I can still respect a beer with this level of quality. Not an extreme US brew by any means, but a very well rounded classic. Even if you're not a bit Quad fan like me, all beer lovers should try this brew!",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Lots of head - if you are a bad pourer then you could have a foam party with this one.  S - Great aroma of sweet malt, abbey ale yeast, candi sugar, and dark fruits.  T - Intense flavor of sweet caramel malt and candi sugar. Also fairly yeasty with a deep fruity quality - plums and raisins mostly - and some grassy hops.  M - Smooth mouthfeel with substantial carbonation that is fairly soft.  D - Decent, but not on the same level as something like Westy 12.

It pours a nice hazy dark-brown color with a two finger thick head which gradually changed into a nice lacing.  Smell: Sweet caramel, roasted malts, dark fruits (raisin, plum), hints of red fruits and clove  Taste: Very similar to the smell. Clove, roasted malts, brown sugar, full of dark fruits, some alcohol, with a nicely bitter aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: smooth, creamy and full bodied. medium-high carbonation.

Excellent retention - head eventually settles into a dense, half inch cap with thick, delicate strands of lacing revealed as the brew was consumed. The nucleation point in the glass did a great job keeping things moving. Nose was dark fruit (plums, figs, raisins) and slightly vinous on a big malty backbone; maybe a hint of brown sugar, candi sugar and chocolate malt in the mix. Taste consistent with nose; however, a little boozy and some heat at the finish - vinous quality really comes out and lingers at the end. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied, lightly, yet evenly carbonated, with some mild astringency at the finish. Probably one of the most drinkable quads out there.

Set it on the counter for about an hour to let it come up to temp.  A- Poured easy into a goblet glass and the head crept up on me, bigger bubbles than I expected though still thick like airy egg whites. Colour imitates the bottle to a t dark dark mahogany. Great carbonation to start but it slowed down on me a couple minutes in.  S- Had a cold for a while but this aroma busted through it anyway with some rich heavy scents that hung around, though it's difficult for me to identify them.  T- wonderful combination of bready malty flavours that hit you on the back of the tongue and linger pleasantly. Prunes come out the most for a beer this fruity, dried fruits not cooked in any way, very intense with a little bit of raisiny finish. Nutty, I work at a imported food shop and this beer reminds me of a tomme de savoie with its walnutty style taste all the way through. I'm aware that viscous isn't a taste but all the elements of this beer make me want to say that. Coffee flavours come in the end as well as an odd cocoa bit. I've been told vanilla is present but I'm still working on identifying flavours, I can't pick it up.  M- Sticky, creamy feel that just wont go away, very very nice finish that lasts a while. The only aspect that isn't quite attractive from this beer is the film that hangs around on the roof of your mouth, nowhere else though.  D- I could certainly enjoy this beer for a whole night, I'd rather sip this from a glass than any wine I've tasted. It's heavy and the long finish is great, sipping this beer could take the place of a meal no problem.  Def. happy to have had the opportunity of trying this out, and its a great way to wow someone new to the beer world, this guys got history and all the aspects to back it.

Thin, bubbly head disappears in a flash leaving behind minimal lacing. Color is cloudy iced-tea orange, and the aroma is a pleasant bready-citrusy cloud; if I could bottle it as perfume I'd make a mint at beer tastings. There's a pungent smack of alcohol that at first masks the fruity base of this beer, leaving bread and wheat at the forefront but the aftertaste reveals bananas, oranges, cherries and cloves and a sweetness that lingers for minutes after each swallow. A nicely dense body carries a super-fizzy tang that burns a bit. Drink this one slowly, and not just because of the ABV which sneaks up and hits hard: the flavors that develop long after you've swallowed develop into a wonderful bouquet. A nice treat for me and my wife at the end of our summer vacation.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Tastes amazing; ripe dark fruits... picking up raisin/prune mostly, sweet caramel maltiness, and the classic Belgian yeast in the finish. The mouthfeel was nice and full, although the carbonation was a little high at first. Drinkability was surprising for such a strong beer.

The transition to the middle brings sweet concord grapes and fresh green grapes which carries over into the finish. Just as this finishes there is a slight hoppiness and dry finish leaving a malty, yeast and slightly dry aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation but has a slight coarseness in the mouthfeel.

259,1708,Wisconsinality,4.6,"Poured from a bottle into a goblet.  A- A deep burgundy/ brown color that look marvelous. Poured about a fingers worth of head that receded a little quicker that I would have thought. A little cloudy but hard to tell from how dark it is. S- A hint of raisins, spice, maybe a little clove and a hint of candy. Kind of reminds me Dr. Pepper in a way. T- I picked up dates, malt, a little bit of yeast and spice. This is a pretty complex beer and I thought there maybe even a little bit of grape in there. M- I would say this is a medium to light-heavy bodied beer but doesn't detract from how it goes down. The right amount of carbonation really adds to the feel. You can feel the warmth from the alcohol just a bit. D- What more can I say about this beer, it goes down great, super smooth and only gets better when it warms up a bit. This I could sip on all the time.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,nomomentwasted,4.5,"Had this on-tap at the Back Abbey in Claremont, CA. Poured into a Moinette Chalice and served around 50 degrees. It was 110 out for most of the day, and this beer disappeared rapidly.  Appearance: Dark brown with a nice tan-ish white head that laced very nicely as it went down. Carbonation is dense and tight, like a champagne by the looks of it, but the head dissaptes rapidly.  Smell: Dark fruits, like plum, raisin, and almost a bit of sweetness from an apricot like ester. Slight anise, not too licorice like, with hints of herbal, medicinal notes as well. Marty presence is balanced out by the Belgian yeast, which is sweet and fruity as always, and very sweet for a 10.5%.  Taste: Wow, very very refreshing and tasty. The dark fruits are up front, followed by the bite of the bitterness from the sharp carbonation and slightest rum-like booziness. The alcohol though is in no way harsh or off-putting, but rather just flavorful. Some beers over 10% just get too alcoholic, whereas this beer only had the delicious notes of a rum-raisin style. Medicinal scent from the nose translates slightly here as well, but in no way negative. Just smooth, tasty, and delicious. As it opened up, I could tell from some increasing sweetness that this beer could use a little time to age and take some of the sharper corners off, but what a great beer. Just fantastic.  Mouthfeel: Carbonated sharply, but it aids the taste and gives the heavy beer some much-needed body. Fruity aftertaste that has little burn and only slightly syrupy. Yum.  Drinkability: I could've drank cold cat-piss yesterday and have cooled off, but this beer was everything I could've asked for and more. Smooth, tasty, complex, and delicious. I'm definitely grabbing a few bottles to age, this beer deserves to be known as one of the best.

Head is small and creamy but still dissipates fairly quickly, minimal lacing is left on my glass. I remember my previous Abt. 12 leaving good lacing though. Smells like a good Belgian beer, raisins, yeast, bready scents and some malts, maybe a small bit of alcohol. Tastes like all of the above things mentioned with some good spice to it, probably my favorite tasting Belgian that I have had yet. Mouthfeel is good, medium with some creamyness and alcohol warming, a perfect amount of it, a raisiney aftertaste coats the entire mouth.

The smell is yeasty with some dark fruits (raisins, plums, figs), and baked goods, with a splice of alcohol in there. Taste is all the flavors with a bit of extra spice thrown in there. Sweet flavors dominate. The mouth feel is beautiful. Covers every square inch with a silky sheet and balances it out with a good dose of carbonation. Finish is subtly dry.

A: Pours a dark brown, cloudy body with scarlet highlights topped with a large, persistent beige head. The first pour leaves surprisingly little lace, while the second fully refreshes the head and leaves lots of sticky lace - interesting.  S: Very sweet, with dark fruits (plums and figs) predominating. Some spice as well. Very inviting.  T: Carries through all the flavors adumbrated in the smell, plus a deeper level of Belgian candi sugar and just a touch of drying hoppiness on the finish. Delicious.  M: In a word, perfect. Medium-to-full bodied with rich, velvety carbonation. Simply beautiful.  D: The alcohol isn't completely hidden, but neither does it make me keep from wishing for another 750 right now. Pretty good.

259,1708,SpdKilz,4.35,"Poured in a Russian River stemmed glass and as a celebration for starting my second year of law school today.  Appearance - Pours out a very nice dark oak looking color with a redish tint. Poured slowly then a bit faster right at the end which produced about a finger and a half of beige head that is...yep...still almost all there after pouring this ten minutes ago. There is the beginning of some very thick lacing being left on the glass. Looks absolutely inviting.  Smell - The first thing I get a waft of is figs/prunes. I smell spices, fruits (dark fruits) and a bit of chocolate. The aromas are being carried around my outside porch as I eagerly await to try this beer.  Taste - I can taste the sweetness initially and with the bubbles of carbonation hitting my tongue instantly. The spices become prevalent with the malt sweetness continuing throughout and also toffee. It finishes with a warming touch (Edit - Wow...I can definitely feel this warming all the way down - I've only taken a few sips and each sip I get an uncanny ""warm"" feeling).  Mouthfeel - Moderate in body and decently carbonated - you can feel the prickling of the bubbles on your tongue and honestly it feels pretty good. Creamy goodness.  Drinkability - I would say relatively drinkable for a beer of this caliber and ABV, though quite honestly I feel it does not hide the alcohol as well as I thought it might be able to (in comparison to other higher ABV beers). However, this is not a problem for me because I am thoroughly enjoying it on my porch with the coolness around me.

M- Excessive carbonation seems to be the St. Bernardus MO, which I loved in the tripel but dug a little less in this one. Toward the end of the beer it mellowed out and became quite nice.

259,1708,crossovert,4.64,"11.2 oz yellow/baby blue labeled bottle. The hype on this beer is really high, I will try not to think of it in this review.  Gushes slightly when it is uncapped, but I sniffed the initial whiff (tropical fruit blast) and poured it before it over flowed, it was just a very slow gush. Pours with a nice 3 finger off white head into my Duvel glass. Head stays for a little while before receding. A blanket of foam still covers the liquid. The thick, creamy lacing/head has little specs in it.  The beer is a very dark, murky brown. There is a hint of red. Tons of little things, yeast and more, are floating around in there.  After letting the oxygen mingle with it for a while I give it a smell. It smells very rich, almost creamy. Has a ripe banana/plum/peach/dried apple scent, along with some bubble gum twang. Theres also some spices in there including clove and pepper. I can also smell a faint bit of chocolaty roasted malt and a kiss of hops. You can pick up on the alcohol a little bit, it prickles your nostrils ever so slightly and warms them.  The carbonation is really biting and I like it. Mouthfeel is utterly superb, some what thin at first but with a thicker, stickier smooth finish. This aids in the taste of a million flavors. Nice sweetness, though not too cloying, and the alcohol shows up just a bit, warming as it does down. Some nice roasted bitterness in the aftertaste. A massive flavor.  Overall, this is a great Trappist style ale, and for a quad it isn't too sweet.

Poured into a tulip glass.  Cloudy plum red color with tasty-looking bubbles nucleating from points on the inner glass surface. Smells alcoholic, fruity, a little spicy and a little sour. The fruity flavor reminds me of fig and alcohol-soaked fruitcake (the good kind that they age for awhile where all the fruit is stewed in alcohol first), followed by a hint of malt. Spilled some on the table while attempting to swat the team of fruit flies that have flocked towards the aroma.  Tastes sweet and sharp with alcohol. The carbonation is light and permeating, letting the hop bitterness through after a few sips. Very warming. Candied fruit comes to mind, but the kind that's so candied you can't tell the original fruit anymore. Slightly spicy, but quite smooth on the tongue and medium-bodied.  For a quad, I find it pretty well done. The strength and sweetness of the beer is tempered by its complexity and tastiness.

Now once again, I was not going to buy anything, but when even a two and a half year old knows about Abt 12...  Serving glass: Poured from bottle into my large Goblet.  Appearance: Very dark reddish-brown with lots of floaties (I poured everything in as I like the yeast). Very foamy, sticky head that mostly subsides.  Smell: Plums, raisins, cloves and a definite musty smell.  Taste: I get a predominate taste of musty dark fruit - that sounds bad but it's not. Strong notes of clove, molasses, butter and alcohol are also evident.  Feel: Moderate carbonation, very chewy but relatively light all things considering. Very warming from the alcohol.  Drinkability: Sip, sip, sip. No matter how good this beer is, I would have a hard time really wanting a second one. Of course, it is still fantastic.

259,1708,illinijer,4.92,"Had this on draft at Jaks Tap in Chicago. Came in a distinctive St. Bernardus goblet (not sure what the correct name is).  A: It was a deep brown, almost black. Very lightly carbonated. Small 1/2 inch head. In appearance alone, it reminds me of a RIS.  S: This is probably the best smelling beer I've had the pleasure of smelling. Smells of plums and brown sugar, with just a hint of spice.  T: Tastes like heaven in a goblet. Full of malty sweetness. Very subtle hop profile. It's all about the malt. The plum smell comes through on the taste as well. The alcohol hits in the middle, but soon goes away as the sweetness wins the day.  M: Thinner than it looks. Was expecting a thicker brew. That being said, the mouthfeel was still good. I would describe it as ""smooth"".  D: Extremely drinkable. Quickly working its way to the top of my favorites list. I could enjoy a few of these without a problem...in fact, after one it makes me want to have another! The alcohol is well hidden and doesn't detract from the experience at all.

Huge head, guess I had a bad pour because my beer exploded all over the place. Slowly dissipated with minimal lacing.  S - Sugary and fruity, get some carmel, maybe some chocolaty-coffee tones. A little pungent.  T - Sweet, sugary taste followed by decently strong alcohol taste. Not a lot of carbination, but enough to give it a little bite on the end. Lingering finish a little sour.  M - Not really that heavy, expecting more substance from a beer like this. Pretty smooth.  D - Easy to drink. For a quad, I could put away a couple of these because of how relatively light it is. Would do this one again.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Though we were ooutdoors so it didnt make any difference. Except maybe losing a large mouthfull (which arent usually taken with this beer).  A- Very large head, should have poured it slower, my friend saw mine and made his pour extremely slow almost getting no head. Which is strange for a beer like this. In all i would say my pour was better. Darkish red beer and very bubbly. Beige head that will not quit.  I left the foam lacing after drinking this in the glass and forgot about the glass in the pool fridge area. A week or two later, the foam was still there dried in the exact position it was  TALK ABOUT LACING!  S- very sweet and fruity. Caramel notes maybe because of the amazing sugariness probably giving it its high abv. But very fruity.'  T- sweetness accompanied by figs and other dark fruits. Slight belgian yeast taste but is masked mostly by sweet fruits.  M- Very thick and sweet. Coats the mouth well and leaves a lingering delicious taste.

Cherries, chocolate, carmel as well I think.  T-- Got the sugar off the bat, still being warm and all. Still quite well carbonated. Got some of the spices and sugar but more toned down.  M-- Well carbonated. Not as heavy as I had kind of feared. Not as heavy as others in this type, possibly needs a little more chill to it. Solid beer though. Not as much candied sugar to it. Much more aggreable to me.  D-- one 750 is enough. Could do 2 smaller ones. not nearly as big as others in this class but still solid. I love the Christmas Ale and like this but I prefer the Christmas just a bit more. Will note that this a review of a warmer beer as it was in a cellar.

Some cake like malty qualities. and some buttery and phenolic flavors are present. Alcohol is there a little bit. Finishes sweet and warming with heavy carbonated mouthfeel.

I'm sipping as I type this :)  a - my beer glasses are all at my girlfriend's house, so I just went with a regular glass. Little to no head. Dark, caramel-y appearance, a little cloudy.  s - Everytime I open a bottle, I smell before pouring, and this one told me immediately that it was going to be very good. It's allergy season, so I can't smell perfectly, but it told me enough with what I could smell. Sweetish, but not too much.  t - awww yeah. All sorts of flavors, malt, subtle fruit flavors, things I can't put my finger on but I like. It's a little bitter, you can taste the alcohol, but it's not overwhelming. I like bitter though, so that should be taken into account. Suffice to say it's delicious.  m - light carbonation. Just enough to feel refreshing, not enough to make me burp with every sip. I like it.  d - I could easily go through 4 in a night(and, subsequently, be trashed). You can taste the alcohol, but it's not overwhelming. It has a high ABV, though, so it's best to go slow. I would take this as a conversational beer, one to sip while discussing music or philosophy.  Overall: I'm going to stock up before it goes away. I'd never seen it before in the supermarket, and I don't want to not see it ever again. Excellent beer.

Smells quintessentially belgian with a dark roasted fruit medley that excites the taste buds and challenges the part of the mind that has to name scents. Figs, red apples, powerful yeast, and maybe toasted marshmallows.  Tastes, at first, just sweet and fizzy, but this changes constantly as it warms. Sit with a glass for a whole hour taking a small sip every couple minutes, you find innumerable fruits from prunes to peaches to figs to apples and apricots, all blended into a very palatable roasted caramel backbone.  The way this beer leaves your mouth when its warm is a must-have experience. It is so warming and satisfying when the bubbles melt on your tongue and the alcohol spreads out those fruit esters with a potent burn. Swallowing a sip of warmed up abt 12 is comparable to brandy. The mouthfeel when cold is quite fizzy and rich but with suppressed flavor, wait for this one to warm up if you aren't extremely impressed at first.  Very drinkable with some smoked cheese or tender meat, maybe dark rye bread. My favorite belgian and one of the best beers out there.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Some nice peppery spice and mellow hops charachter. After sampling multiple times in the last few months, this may be the best tasting beer i have ever had.  M: Medium bodied. Creamy mouthfeel. Perfect carbonation levels - prickly without being too bubbly.  D: Exceptionally drinkable for a beer of its ABV profile.

Aroma: Large notes of alcohol big notes of dried fruits. Not alot of aroma from the malts but the hops give off fruit esters like an avalanche off of a mountain.  Taste: At first sip it packs a punch of malty goodness. Oh did I say punch more like a sledge hammer of flavor. A little bit of a buttery mouthfeel. The hops in this monster were roasted something dark that's so wonderful. Nice subtle notes of dried apricot see to round it off.  Notes: Definatley a great beer for a cool summer or spring night.

Ruby highlights taper to a deep orange. Head swelled to 3 fingers with a little swirling.  Nose struck me initially as big ripe plum and candy--sweet tart? Fun dip? Pear. Honey. Flowers. A little bit of runts banana. A tiny bit of toast or cookie. Some fresh-cracked pepper.  Very candy-like flavor. Tangy and zesty. Malt-forward, rich, sweet without any lingering cloy. Warming in throat and chest. A little spicy--peppery. More phenols as it warms--fresh pepper and a touch of clove. Overwhelmingly delicious, complex flavor. A gentle push of bitterness to clean up and dry the swallow. Booze noticeable but not distracting. A brightness from phenols. Slight roasted aftertaste--reminiscent of horehound candy?  Soft, full mouthfeel. Creamy and firm, with dancing prickles from strong carbonation and alcohol. Leaves a slightly numb tingle--perhaps a touch astringent? I can feel the sides of my tongue.  This is alarmingly good. I drank that bottle FAST. I remember not liking this one a ton the first time I tried it because of phenolic brightness, but that isn't striking me this time.

While the bouquet isn't highly intense, the spectrum is, and quite varied.  Flavors of candy, figs, kiwis, hops, and a certain level of bread-iness, possibly the pumpernickel another reviewer mentioned.

259,1708,jrallen34,4.35,Drank from a bottle into a chalice in Brussels.  This beer pours drank brown with a tan head that stays around for awhile. Has good lacing as well.  It smells fruity with a tad of spice.  It tastes a bit like chocolate and coffee. Its a heavy beer that goes down smooth with the right amount of bitterness at the end.,Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,rapidsequence,4.97,"11.2 oz bottle. Took it out of the fridge and poured it into an oversized wine glass, then let it sit for 30 minutes.  Appearance: Hazy light brown with some red-orange tints. Thick white-tan head still leaves some remnants after half an hour, with lacing stuck to the glass.  Smell: Well, truthfully, I smelled it for much of the warming time. Its almost worth buying just to smell. Sweet, sweet dark fruit and spice. Yeasty bread.  Taste: Up front, its all spice, then sweetness, then strong bready yeast flavors on the back. So much spicy, sweet fruitcake and yeasty bread. Its as much like food as it is drink. The alcohol is clearly present, but doesnt take anything away (cmon, alcohol is part of the reason you drink, right?). The finish is so nice.  Mouthfeel: This is a very full feel. Strong carbonation makes it feel creamy or foamy in your mouth. Its great.  Drinkability: Well, nothing makes me happier. This was actually the first Belgian that I ever tried at the suggestion of some random beer store guy about 7 years ago. It has been my favorite beer ever since and opened me up to Belgians in general (I've never had a Westy and I like it better that Rochefort). At six bucks for 11.2 oz of perfection, its a steal.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,StarlightSeraph,4.05,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into my St. Bernardus goblet.  Appearance: Pours a deep, hazy reddish brown, with a finger and a half of white head that dissipated somewhat quickly. Good bit of lacing.  Smell: Tangy fruits (cherries), some raisins, some nice bready malt in the background.  Taste: A nice tart bite right away, with an incredibly long-lasting, smooth, bready finish. The flavors are subtle in this one, but the bready notes last a nice long time. The initial fruitiness is tangy, and a little bit cloying, but still very good.  Mouthfeel: At first I thought it was a little thin, but I think it's just about right for this kind of beer. Any thicker would have accentuated the sweetness and probably made it too sweet to drink. Good carbonation.  Drinkability: Surprisingly easy to drink, and no way this seems like 10 percent alcohol. The flavors are more subtle than full flavored, so it's a good sipping beer. I enjoyed this.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

It starts with a sweet beady malt, follows with raisins and plum. There is a bit of alcohol. Slight notes of spices.  T- It is a very well rounded Belgian quad. It has all the right notes Bread pudding, fruit of plums and raisins. Just a tuck of spicy hops towards the end and finishes with a sweet aftertaste.  M: Medium bodied, Plenty of carbonation. Finishes slightly dry. A slight warming from the alcohol.  O: This is a very good got to Belgian quad. It is consistent and delicious.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Stavage,4.5,"Looks good, a nice rich deep dark brown liquid with a bubbly off white head that reduces to a very good stick lacing.  Smell is full on with ripe fruits, clove and other 'sweet' spices and sweet maltiness. It's a good full on smell, not as complex and subtle as a Rochefort 10 but much more present too.  Taste follows on from this really. The most evident spice note is clove, which compliments the sweetness quite well and this is a sweet beer. Ripe fruits and biscuity/cakey malts. A little bit too sweet for my tastes, but theres enough in the esters and spice to give it decent complexity. Alcohol is in there but pretty well hidden and gives a much needed bite to the proceedings. Overall quite full tasting. Like the smell, I find for example a Rochefort 10 more subtle and complex but this one makes up for it in fullness of flavour.  Smooth and full. Very good mouthfeel. Nothing much to say about it, it's up there with the other top ales in the calibre.  Very drinkable too. Almost a 5 but the sweetness just takes it down a notch for me.  I dont think this would be my choice to sip by itself at the end of the day. But with the fullness of flavour this is possibly my favourite quad (so far) to drink with a good meal (say a spicy red pasta dish).",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,cgraham5,4.62,"A - Pours a deep mahogany color with an off-white head. Head retention is adequate to good, lacing isn't uniform but scattered. Carbonation is very apparent in the strings of bubbles that rise to the surface.  S - Smells rich of malt and and then very sweet fruity esters.  T - A very complex drink. It warms the back of your palette as you sip before almost ricocheting back to the front of the palette to reveal its fruity nature. I can't emphasize the warming nature enough at second sip...  M - The carbonation hits the tip of your tongue and accentuates the spiciness of the brew. For the thick nature of the brew, the carbonation couldn't be better.  D - Overall an excellent quad. Smooth to drink, easy to enjoy. At 10%ABV(although BA says 10.5%) it'll be knockin' you back all night instead of the other way around. I think you'll be satisfied but, you certainly won't be dissatisfied. At a price of $11 and change it may seem pricey, but what great beer isn't? (Don't answer that...)

Pours with a good solid 2 fingers worth of tan colored head that quickly dissolves into the body and leaves behind moderate lacing. Body is dark like a deep rich chocolate or macchiato.  A soft, almost sweet-like, clove aroma drives the smell in combination with malt and dark summer fruits.  Taste is a complex mixture of the aromatic features except with a tactile, sweet and sticky malt character thrown in.  The mouthfeel is extremely rewarding with a sweet, creamy smoothness. The finish has warm alcohol properties but isn't quite dry.  A very good representation of the quad style and much more sweeter than Rochefort 10",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

It smells spicy with yeast, dark fruits and sweet malt. Taste is complex; first there's spicy cloves & phenols. Then there's sweet malts, bread & lastly, a fruit & wood flavor. Mouthfeel is carbonated but leaves smooth.  This is the best Quad I've ever had. Deliciously drinkable, which makes that ABV a little dangerous.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

259,1708,DannyS,4.45,"Poured from an 11.2 oz bottle (i think) into my duvel tulip.  A - A dark, rusty opaque burgundy with an airy, off-white pillow of head that leaves broad swaths of loose lacing. The carbonation looks suspended in the beer. Awesome. Only slightly disappointed that the head retention isn't perfect. Scratch that; the head triumphantly returns with a little swirl from the glass.  S - Lots of full bodied dried fruit and dark belgian sugar with a twinge of boozy character and caramel sweetness. Like smelling homemade candy. Also slightly bourbon-esque.  T - The delicate yet dark, full sweetness gives good balance to the robust malt, with raisins and prunes complimenting the lovely palate experience.  M - The carbonation is more lively than I thought it would be, but I liked how it contrasted the thickness of the brew, the head adding a dimension of creaminess as I sipped.  D - The alcohol is tempered well, but at 10.5%, this is definitely a sipper, which is the only way to do justice to this excellent brew.  Overall - This is at least one of the gold standards for big beers; the kind you relax with at the end of the day, sipping away and enjoying every flavorful nuance while sitting in an easy chair with a velvet robe, acting snooty. Or you could do what I just did and say 'This beer rocks!' before belching loudly. Heavenly nectar, indeed.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

At first I couldn't put my finger on it and then it just came to me, it kind of reminded me of the meal replacement that we used to drink before swim practice, Boost Chocolate. Don't let that be a turn off though, it was an interesting on to hit. There was a noticeable 'chalkiness' as well.  M - Weighty but turns has a significant velvety feel.

S: Wonderfully complex nose of sweet caramel, dark fruits (plums, dates and figs), spices (clove, coriander and nutmeg), and some yeasty goodness. So much going on.  T: All the olfactory components merge into the flavors, and then some. It's almost like drinking a fine red wine. Everything comes together so perfectly. My favorite part is the strong malty backbone which ties everything together. Absolutely magnificent!  M: The feel is very smooth and creamy. My only knock against this beer is that there is perhaps just a bit too much carbonation for my liking. However, it bothered me less as I made my way through the bottle.  D: This one should be enjoyed slowly, so as to expose and contemplate all the flavors.  This beer is damn near perfect... period. At the time of this writing, it is my favorite Belgian, and while I do enjoy others, they pale in comparison, at least in terms of sheer complexity and grace. Mandatory drinking.

Pours a deep, murky dark brown, with a solid two-finger dense head that settled to about a half an inch and (eventually) an 1/8"" cap; never less. Doesn't want to let go of the glass, but eventually does on its way down.  Nose is teeming with rich dark fruit notes - raisins and ripe plums, prunes and even hints of red grapes. Brown sugar sits alongside of that, with sharp clove spiciness holding all that fantastic richness in check.  Taste is everything expected of it. Rich brown sugar malt sweetness surrounding notes of ripe plums, raisins, and red grapes, complemented by a big clove character; just a bit vinous towards the finish, and a light, earthy, over-ripe bitterness that pokes it's head out right before the finish. The rich sweetness of this one never quits - fantastic from start to finish - but what's really remarkable is the lightness, that makes this one almost ethereal. Fantastic beer.  Mouthfeel is creamy and light, but full and lush at the same time. The never-ending head adds a fullness to it that's superb.  Drinkability is exceptional. Alcohol is apparent in warmth but not in the mouth, and it's never boozy by any stretch of the imagination. World Class.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Creamy foam tan head that fell to about half-a-finger and stuck around.  Smells like a red wine, dark fruit (raisins), sweet melons, caramel and toffee. A bit of phenolics from the yeast.  Taste - vinous quality comes through. Port like, with some spice. Definitely a big malt backbone. No hop bitterness - spice seems to come from yeast.  Full body, lively bubbles followed by a slick mouthfeel and a definite alcohol warmth as it goes down.  Overall, was somewhat put off by the appearance, but flavor makes up for it.

Also perfect.  Boy, the flavor is wild. Very spicy and fruity with brown sugar, raisins, and a huge alcohol wallop. Bitter finish.

Very little head on top but nice lacing is left behind on the glass.  Aroma is complex and sweet with really nice fruity esters and belgian yeast.  Flavor is excellent as it was from the bottle. Complexities from the yeast and the sweet caramel and figs from the malts. Very mild hopping but extremely well balanced.  Mouthfeel is much different and, for my tastes, much better on tap. The carbonation is subtle and the body is full and smooth. Easier drinking than the bottled version which had considerably more effervescence.

Perfectly smooth with little bitterness and not overly sweet. Accents unfold beautifully with the sort of complexity hitherto untasted by me. Dark, woody overtones with some subtle cedar and cherries. Mouthfeel was thick but not in a bad way - it complimented this brew perfectly.

259,1708,originalsin,4.52,"I'm staring at a half empty bomber of the stuff and felt like I absolutely had to log on and review this brew.  The cork was a lot easier to jimmy out than some other beers I've struggled with lately. That's certainly a plus. And this god damn crazy monk is giving me the eye and laughing at me for not having a Bernadus chalice like the one he's holding on to. 'It's in the mail, I swear I swear...'  The pour on this one was quite nice. The off white head was one of the most beautiful billowing pieces of art to ever appear atop a beer. Really a spectacular sight. Unfortunately, head retention wasn't that great (and certainly sub-par for a quad, from my humble experience). Lacing, to say the least, was not sub par. My glass now has a ring of head around the beer and some odd shaped continent of head looming in the middle, daring me to drink.  There's a ton of sweet malt on the nose. A little raisin but more grape and most certainly all kinds of apples: Smelling this reminds me of apple picking as a kid with my father and brothers, seeing apples rotting underneath the trees and getting yelled at for picking them up.  This beer tastes great. What else can I say. The sweet malt is ever-present. Raisins, figs, and plums all lay themselves out on the table quite clearly while some spices and coriander try to hide but inevitably come through. There's a bit of an alcohol kick to this one but it doesn't detract from the deliciousness at all.  St. Bernadus abt 12 is a bold beer--medium bodied and intensely sweet at times, the drinkability is really good in spite of the fact that's it's most certainly a sipper.

Tonight is the time I dedicate to the review of this Belgian classic  Upon opening the bottle, slowly some foam started rising out of the bottle. Poured into my snifter glass and a deep off white head formed and remained for quite some time. When it began to fade lacing was left clinging everywhere. No surprise that the beer is a purple/brown color that is almost opague.  Interesting aroma, I always get dark sweet grapes... Almost like grape jelly. Also some yeast and obviously some sweet malts.  Well, the flavor is as complex as always. Some alcohol, some phenolic flavors and lots of deep dark fruit. I taste the same grape that I smelled. Layers of malt flavors that just keep coming. Some bitterness mixed with the alcohol. The yeast provides some strong flavors and subtle spice as well. Lots going on her.  Thick and creamy mouth feel.

Yeast adds some nice complexities of figs, raisins and dark bread loaves. Chewy, toffee and nutty even...hell, nearly any beer flavor can be found in this brew besides hoppy or citrus notes. What I like about this beer is that it maintains a sweet malty profile without being syrupy or sticky. Has a mineraly/gypsum flavor in there that helps add some dryness.

259,1708,PatrickJR,3.02,"Re-review, original posted below.  Poured from a 750ml bottle into red wine glass. Bottle lists the ABV at 10%.  A - Cloudy brown with some orange and amber on the edges. Three fingers of light tan head rise with moderate retention before falling to a persistent 1/8 inch cap. Minimal lacing.  S - Lots of dark fruit in the nose; plums and raisins stand out most with a touch of overripe berries. Vanilla peeks through also atop dark, sweet bread. Rather soft overall and lacks a bit of the punch I would expect, but still lovely.  T - I'm on my fourth glass of this, the brew is probably 5 degrees shy of room temperature, and I'm just not finding much in flavor. I've given it a fair shot. Early palate yeilds vanilla-laced dark bread with nutty accents. This doesn't last nearly as long as I'd like, and the sweetness is swept away by chalky, medicinal flavors. Dark fruit, specifically raisin, try to break through this phenolic onslaught but it's too little too late. A growing and frankly disgusting bitterness grows late palate while an underlying vinous character makes a cameo. Abt 12 finishes quite bitter and medicinal with a moderate kick of alcohol. Unpleasant aftertaste of crushed aspirin.  M - This is just unacceptable. I've poured the beer harder and harder each glass, and it's still ridiculously carbonated. Doubtless the huge carbonation is muting sweet, bready, fruity flavors and ramping up all the bitterness and phenols. Body is medium bodied at best, more consistent with a dubbel than a quad. The mouthfeel really inhibits this beer from lingering on the palate and brings out its worst while restraining the beauty that the nose would suggest.  D - I really hate to be so harsh on this vaunted beer. I've become a big fan of Belgian and Belgian style stuff in the almost year since I originally reviewed Abt 12, and I hoped to approach it with a more refined and experienced palate and fully enjoy what others often laud. I guess this beer just isn't for me. I'm not even sure if I can get through the last glass or two left in the bottle. Somewhere between the emphasis on the medicinal bitterness (the worst kind of bitterness in a beer, in my opinion) and the absurd carbonation, the brew misses the mark in the worst way. I have no doubt it all (mostly) comes down to the carbonation; the aroma suggests a wonderful beer but it just doesn't deliver. If this is as close as I can get (easily) to Westvleteren 12, I think I can continue my journey with even more happiness than before.  ---  Original review from 06.04.08  Poured from 750ml bottle into red wine glass.  A - 4.0 - Hazy brown with 2 finger off-white head. Decent retention, settled to thin collar, expected considering high ABV.  S - 5.0 - Marvelous. A deep foundation of dark freshly baked bread runs underneath. Overtones of brown sugar with some dark fruit, followed by phenols and the obvious alcohol.  T - 4.5 - Starts off with a caramel plus phenol taste followed by a very predominant vinous character. Less like wine and more like actual grape juice. Grapey character dominates mid palate and leads to a sharp yeast component late palate followed by an obvious alcohol burn.  M - 4.0 - Medium bodied and moderately carbonated. Would've prefered this slightly heavier and slightly more carbonated.  D - 4.5 -T hough the alcohol is noticable, it's still hidden quite well. Price is the ulimate deterant.

259,1708,Jeffo,4.07,"Got this at the bottle shop down the road.  From a bottle into a St. Bernardus Chalice.  Note: Part of the Quad Showdown, including Rochefort 10, St. Bernardus 12 and Westvleteren 12, in that order.  APPEARANCE: Pours a 1+ finger medium thick off-white / tan head with good retention. Colour is an opaque auburn or raw umber brown with a decent amount of carbonation evident. Head has good retention and eventually fades to a nice film cap, which remains the entire time, but leaves minimal to no lace down the glass.  SMELL: A very fruity nose of raisins, grapes, plumbs and dates. Lots of dark fruits. A slight hint of spicy cloves, but it's all about the dark fruits here. The nose could be a bit spicier, and perhaps a little bolder as well, but the fruitiness is nice in and of itself.  TASTE: Very bold flavours here. Very fruity as well. Raisins and dark grapes mostly, with some dates and prunes, like the nose advertised. More spices than in the nose, with cloves and coriander evident, along side touches of caramel malt. Some spicy alcohol at the end as well, but very well hidden for the ABV. Aftertaste is fruity, spicy and alcoholic, as is relatively long lasting. A touch of bitter sweetness at the end. Very nice profile and is more impressive than the nose.  PALATE: Medium-thin body and a bit light on the palate. Not quite as creamy as others in the style, but smooth going down with not bite, surprisingly. Finishes slightly mouth coating as well. Fine, but needs to be a little thicker and creamer for top marks here.  OVERALL: A very tasty treat, but the feel kept it back a little bit. A thicker feel would get this one over the hump. As part of the Quad Showdown, this one was comparable to the the Westvleteren 12, but both were well behind the Rochefort 10. Though this is a good beer and I'd definitely have it again, I find it is overrated and, in the end, more hype than substance.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,FleeVT,4.5,"330ml brown dated bottle poured into a Bernardus chalice.  A: A deep hazed brown that leaves no light penetration, topped with cream colored clingy head.  S: Sweet malty goodness. Dark fruits, especially raisin, do well to mask the alcohol.  T/M: Sweet ripe berries and raisins with a spicy backdrop. The alcohol builds up slowly and crescendos with a faint medicinal improve. Nice heavier bodied quad with a surprisingly creamy texture for all the carbonation.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,PDXHops,4.59,"750 ml bottle poured into a Duvel tulip  Deep brownish red body. Initially a massive 3-finger fluffy cream-colored head develops. After a minute or so, it recedes to a thick skim that sticks around til the end of the bottle without so much as a swirl needed. Lacing varies between clumpy, crackly and creamy, although I'd love to see a little more. Looks like the 'big boy' beer that it is.  Wonderfully complex nose. How many fruit smells can possibly fit in one beer? I pick up cherries, raisins, figs, peaches, apples, oranges, plums and grapes. Aside from the fruits, there's plentiful Belgian yeast, cloves plus other spices I can't seem to identify. Maybe a little charred wood in there, too? I spent a good five minutes smelling it over and over before I ever tasted, and I still am not doing it justice. The aromas are dancing around in my mouth and throat. I can already taste it before I even take a sip.  Tastes every bit as good as it smells, perhaps even better. I taste pretty much everything I smelled, plus tobacco, leather, bananas, sourdough bread, maybe even apricots and some vague earthiness. I feel like I could have a bottle a week and still keep finding new subtle flavors. It's sweet, it's sour, it's boozy, it's smooth, it's fruity, it's spicy. Great stuff.  Nice feel. Hits the tongue silky smooth, yet froths up and makes the deliciousness rain down all over the tongue, palate, and halfway down the throat (seriously, seems like I can taste it even in my throat). Incredibly long finish, the kind that makes you want to keep chewing and smacking your lips to see what else you can taste even after you've swallowed.  Overall impression: Awesome beer fresh. Very much looking forward to trying this aged.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,lacqueredmouse,4.2,"Deep, lightly hazy dark brown, with a frothy, but surprisingly loose-bubbled head of beige foam. Lacing is excellent though. Shame the head looks so weak. Otherwise very nice.  Very powerful rich, sweet nose, full of dried fruit, vanilla caramel and some spicy alcohol. Very pleasant indeed.  Very smooth and rich palate. Sweet, with lots of malt and a pleasant phenolic alcohol, which stays spicy and warm under everything. Notes of liquorice noticeable. Very smooth and sippable.  All things considered, it's not a huge and boisterous Belgian bomb, but it's tight, accurate and true to style. Very, very easy to drink for what it is. I could drink it all night, which is quite an amazing property for such a strong beer.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Brenden,4.4,"Another incredible beer I got in a great trade with BeerLovinGrl...  This one is a deep brown that, when held up to light, had highlights of...lighter brown. I let it sit for a few minutes and when the just off-white head dissipates, it's to about two fingers of tight foam. Lacing is almost relentless. There's no carbonation seen, but it's beautiful nonetheless. The smell is rich, pure, sweet malt with cloves and some complex fruit notes. There's a noticeable but gentle and unbecoming alcohol notes with some molasses undertones. I also get some honey and a biscuity smell as well. The taste follows suit almost perfectly. There a slightly more evident note of dark fruits (plum and raisin, most noticeably) and alcohol is very well hidden in flavor while very evident in its immediate warming effect. Otherwise, cloves hit the tongue first with a powerful malt overtone giving way to ripe dark fruits and a gentle peppery bite. There's a nice buttery note and alcohol is most evident in the finish. Brown sugar and molasses add to the complexity. The body on this one is moderate to full and it's incredibly smooth and creamy. Very nice. This is a very fine brew and one everyone needs to try. High ABV lowers drinkability just slightly.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,BZero007,4.4,"Poured from a bottle in to my Chimey Goblet. Pours a very amber brown with lots of clouds spinning in the glass. Sediment floats all around in this brew, just looking at it you know it has allot of flavor to it. The head forms with out even trying and releases a great set of smells that are greatly respected. Lots of dark fruits hit the nose, figs, raisans and others. Dark Alcohol molassas smell aswell hits the nose possibly from the malt. The taste is also very refreashing one thing I noticed of the bat was the beer did not seem 10.5 alc and more of a 5. alc. The flavors in this beer mask the alcohol amount very well but are still present and help lift the flavors. Again dark fruits with molassas and a bit of spice to it. Everything is balanced in this brew exceptionaly well. The flavor is not overly complex were I need to sit, relax, and reflect but one that I can continue to do what im doing and drink. The mouthfeel is very good and the carbonation is perfectly matched. The carbonation lifts the flavors to your pallet with ease and does not dmg your taste buds in anyway. Drinkability is good due to the taste and smoothness this brew carries. The alcohol level is 10.5% and it will sneek up on you. Love this beer and will continue to stock it.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Rayek,4.32,"Looks like I'm the 1,371st person to review this. I don't know if I can add anything new to the discussion, but I'll try. Abt 12 was poured into my St Bernardus chalice, which seemed the proper thing to do.  A: Deep copper with nice clarity given the bottle conditioning. Carbonation is quite active. Fluffy cream cap has a bit of a reddish tint to it. Head retention is very nice, but very little lace is left behind.  S: I think I could smell this beer from a mile away. As it exited the bottle, I was greeted by a rush of dried fruits. Raisins, prunes, currants and raspberries all came through. All that fruit mixes with a heavy dose of alcohol to to create a very vinous overall aroma. There's a bit of pepper and clove in the back that helps keep things balanced.  T: Very wine like. The dark fruits and alcohol make this drink like a fine red. If it weren't for the carbonation tingling on my tongue, I could almost be convinced this wasn't beer. Hop flavor is very low, as the fruit and alcohol take center stage. Finishes dry and tart, with a heavy warmth going down.  M: The body on this feels lighter than the beer's strength made me think it would be. It's somewhat syrupy, but not overly so. Carbonation feels just right.  D: This is one fine beer. I was through my little bottle in what felt like no time. I'm really happy I finally tried Abt 12.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Buschyfor3,4.73,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into the appropriate St. Bernardus chalice.  A: Pours a murky, rusty brown body with a thin, creamy beige head; head is only about a cm thick and quickly dissipates to a ring of lacing. Body is not quite opaque to light, as there are faint, dark amber highlights that appear near the bottom of the chalice. A lot of sediment in the body - remnants of the yeast, I presume. Good lacing throughout the glass.  S: Wow! First note reminds me a lot of brandy - sweet and with a nice, spicy alcohol punch. Plenty of dark fruits - prunes and raisins. A good dose of Belgian spiciness as well. Then there is the obvious alcohol note underneath the fruity sweetness and it carries a noticeable spicy quality. Malts come in the back door and add layers of complexities to the sweet aroma of this quad - honey, a light, fresh biscuit aroma round out the nose.  T: Ridiculously complex and enjoyable. Where to start? Dark fruits up front with an initial wave of sweetness: raisins, prune juice, plums, very sugary up front. Caramel sweetness follows the fruit. The alcohol peaks here with a spicy, peppery and slightly medicinal/band-aid taste which quickly disappears beneath the encroaching malts. Mid sip the malts come into the dance as a fresh, doughy biscuit flavors melds with a hint of fresh clover honey. Then a slightly drier, grainy wheat flavor arises and carries a nutty, buttery taste well into the finish.  M: Medium carbonation provides enough of a refreshing tingle to lend a textured edge to this quad; otherwise, the mouthfeel is smooth and velvety delivering its complexities to the palate in a slick, pleasing experience.  D: High ABV, but this beer's complex demeanor makes for quite the enjoyable experience. It begs for each quaff, just for the opportunity to discover another nuance of flavor across the palate. Decadent, sweet, delicious. I would say it is one of the more drinkable higher gravity ales that I have had to this point, even if the booze hits you fairly noticeable heat towards the end of the bottle.  This is my first Belgian quad and it is a beauty. I don't have access to Westy 12, but I can get the Abt 12 easily and for a reasonable price, and this is a gem. Complex, delicious and seductively powerful. Definitely deserving of one of the best ratings on BA.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Well retained - hanging around at 2cm  S- At earthy, yeasty, and sweet nose. Almost like bread. Some phenolic undertones in there as well.  T - Starts off with some sweetness, malt forward biting. Strong yeast notes build mid-stream - edgy. Finishes with a sour bite with a balancing sweetness. A bready aftertaste sits on the tongue.  M - Biting carbonation - certainly a quad. Very think from all the sugars and other unfermentables.  D - Moderate to low drinkability. Sweetness is palette wearing and the high carbonation is very filling. And watch out after drinking a few of these.  An okay beer - guess I've come to the conclusion that quads aren't my beer.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,ericduran,3.51,"I've had this beer several times before out of the bottle and loved it, but off the tap is a different story. Had it at Tapwerks in Oklahoma City.  A - Good. It looks the same as out of the bottle. I don't see the point in elaborating since if you're reading this you probably know what it looks like out of the bottle.  S - This was a huge, bad difference. Very strong phenolic smell that other reviewers are calling 'rasin cola' that I couldn't place. I gave it to my friend with quite a sensitive sniffer who hit it dead on - urinal cake. Blegggh. Yuck! Ptooey. Gross. Well that ruined it for me. Yeah, this beer really needs time to age. Why can't they let the kegs age too before shipping them out? Oh well, too bad for them...they are wasting all their hard work! I will only take this beer in the bottle from now on.  T - The actual taste was good. Tastes like it does out of the bottle. Maybe a bit *fresher* but for this kind of beer that's not better, just different. Depends on what you like.  M - Similar to out of the bottle but the carbination was a lot mellower. Meh. Has that same weird texture that manages to be both thin and syrupy at the same time as other heavy belgians.  D - I finished the glass no problems, putting the thoughts of urinal cakes out of my mind. It's still a good beer, just give it time to grow up guys! It's a stinky child.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

S: Lots of dark fruit and a bit of spice on the nose. It smells like raisins or maybe prunes.  T: The taste is a lot like the smell. I get a mainly dark fruit and spices. A bit of pepper too with a bit of warming alcohol. It is sweet, but not too sweet. A very delicious quad.  M: A full mouthfeel that I find somewhat lush. It has the right amount of carbination for the style; a little prickly but not overwhelming.  D: I really enjoy this beer and find it to be very drinkable. It is definately a sipper at nearly 11% abv, but I would not put it past me to have two in a sitting.  Notes: I recently had this on tap and found I preferred it from the bottle. From the tap the alcohol seemed to be more assertive. This is quickly becoming my go-to beer when I am in the mood for a big Belgian.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Taste starts off with strong notes of dark fruit and spices. Hints of vanilla and brown sugar make an appearance along with just a light touch of alcohol in the finish.  Full bodied, maybe a little more carbonation than I would like to see.  This is about as drinkable as it can get at 10.5%.

Aroma of dark fruits, malts. Some dark wood aroma in there.  Taste is of dark fruits [raisins, plums], malt, vanilla, baked apples. Has a sweetness to it and quite complex.  Mouthfeel is medium+ bodied and quite cleansing.  Overall, just an amazing brew. Very complex and soothing. Hides the alcohol very well.

Appearance - Poured a dark red and produced a nice light tan head.  Taste - A hint of spice near the beginning giving way to a malty sweet profile hiding just the smallest amount of discernible alcohol. Even as this beer warms the flavor profile stays pretty consistent.  Mouthfeel - A medium body carried by a ton of carbonation. A really good mouthfeel.  Drinkability - Amazingly drinkable for 10.5%. The spice really helps from being overwhelmed by the sweetness.,Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Maction,4.47,"A: In a St. Bernardus chalice, it shows a pale burgundy with brown undertones. A hearty 3"" head collapses to a compact disk, leaving thick lace down the side of the glass.  S: A complex aroma, cherries, hard candy, traces of clove.  T: It just tastes so good, with flavors of brandy and candy, but it's not namby-pamby. There's a smoothness balanced by a slight alcohol tinge. Then there's the tart and acidic flavor that my wife identifies as grape Kool-Aid.  M: It feels dense, but not viscous, and the carbonation keeps things moving on your palate.  D: This beer is so delicious that it's hard to drink slowly. Even though I know it's 10% ABV, it's hard not to rush through one of these and order another.  Notes: My wife's favorite beer of all times. Her question: ""how could you not love it?""

Head retention is stellar, renewing itself with tiny rising bubbles after every sip. Maintains a half inch of rocky foam all the way to the last sip with thick, sticky lacing. Has an aroma of spiced fruit (black cherries), nuts, bread, and alcohol. Flavor is a perfect blend of all of the above. Alcohol is very noticeable, but warming and welcome. Finishes sweet and fruity, also has a mild earthy, herbal quality. Mouthfeel is thick and full; smooth and creamy. This isn't something to drink hastily.

259,1708,bulletrain76,4,"33cl bottle at De Wildeman, Amsterdam. Dark, murky brown with a big tan head that lasts a good bit. Aroma is really malty with ripe fruit, brown sugar sweetness and some alcohol. The flavor is very sweet - the sweetest of the quads that I've had. It's a nice sweetness though; not cloying. Very good as a dessert drink. I think that the sweetness does suppress other flavor qualities though. Thick with smooth carbonation and a slightly sticky finish. Very nice, but not as elegant as Rochefort, or a drinkable as Westy. Had it a just below room temp at De Wildeman, and tried it the next day on draught at Gollem, which served it much colder, and I have to say that it was much better warmer.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Smell is an amazing blend of yeast, alcohol, spice (coriander? cardamom?), biscuit, toffee, raisin, cherry, peach brandy, and just a hint of herb and citrus. The complexity is astounding. Each sniff brings a differing wave of fragrance that sets my taste buds to alert.  The sip starts with yeast, caramel, and warm alcohol that seems to coddle my tongue as it introduces incredible amounts of brilliant flavor to the sip. The fruit and spice aromas of the nose now roll like a wave of delicious flavor across thankful taste buds. Peach, pear, raisin, currant, spice, a sweet backdrop, a bitter edge, an earthy undertone, all balanced into a sip that won't peak, a finish that doesn't end, like a wave that refuses to break. I'm mostly through the glass now. It has warmed near to room temp. and the alcohol has not become dominant, but all the other flavors have grown more pronounced, more delicious.  Mouthfeel is superb as well. It is like carbonated heaven upon the palate, cheeks, and tongue.  Drinkability ought to be judged within the style, and it is a solidly drinkable quad.

Appearance: The appearance of this is amazing. I had to pour quick as the foam was starting to gush out of the bottle. The head was so big it required two pours. A deep burgendy color. One of the best I've seen.  Smell: The smell was very strong even at fridge temps. As it warmed up, more smells became apparent. Plums, grapes, alcohol and candy.  Taste: Everything included in the smell. I was surprised by the sweetness and similarity to a dark wine of this brew. Normally I am not a huge fan of wine, but if it tasted like this I think I could learn. The alcohol bite, although well hidden, starts to be exposed as the beer warms.  Mouthfeel: Probably the best part about this beer. For all the complex flavors it has, the aftertaste is more of a lite coating with little residual flavor. The alcohol is minimal for a 10% beer. Perfectly smooth and rounded flavor.  Drinkability: This beer was great and I'll deffinately seek it out again, but one 750 mL bottle is more than enough. The alcohol kills your tastebuds towards the end, so I feel trying to drink more is just a waste.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

The head retains quite well at about a quarter of an inch. Minimal lacing.  Initial fruity esters of banana and fig, caramel and sweet malts. Moderate amounts of belgian spice and yeast add complexity.  Taste is similar to smell, but just one step even better.  The mouthfeel is exactly what a great belgian is.

Look is dark and murky, a very dark amber/brown. Great head to start, mediocre retention and lacing. Smell is of dark fruit and brown sugar, very enticing. Taste is dark fruit including plum, black cherry, and overripe berries. It also has a deep brown sugar flavor to it, no molasses like other dark beers of these variety. Booze has low presence due to sweet flavor, but is definitely there. Mouthfeel is full bodied, this beer drinks like a meal, this will allow me to skip a meal, or at least delay during finals studying. Drinkability- while I have savored this beer over 2 days due to its high alcohol content, this is a beer that I would happily imbibe (22 oz) if it were not for finals. Anything more than a 750 ml bottle is not only irresponsible, but I would also not drink that much of such a delicious beer and I am also not a millionaire.

Quite malty on the palate with again, quite a sour flavour coming through, also very spicy with a peppery, Shiraz kind of character. A bit of a flat palate profile though, with only one note sounding. That one note is very complex and unique though, with hints of licorice, a lot of pepper and methinks a a fair hit of alcohol which gives it quite a burning mouthfeel, like a good slug of scotch.

Nice chestnut-colour, with beige head, thin but persistant. Very fresh smell of herbs, also fruits like apricots or grapes, a bit of caramel and coffee. I would say the taste is a balance between sour and sweet and spicy, and it also has robust flavours of malt, black coffee, even tobacco. the alcohol is present.

259,1708,grayburn,4.78,"She pours a murky marroon with a huge tan head. The lacing is beautiful and the retention is perfect. Beautiful beer.  The smell is dominated by some clove and apricot notes. There is some alcohol hiding around that peeks out a bit as the beer warms up. Every 2-3 degrees of warming (from 50 degrees) the beer changes a note. There almost seems a bit of a funky sour note, which really blends nicely.  The taste again shows just a touch of a sour note, followed nicely by some caramel and toffee notes. There is a huge fruit presence in the background that leaves your tongue curious for a while. Very impressive.  The mouthfeel starts with a firework show of carbonation, which carries the alcohol in this brew like nobody's business. The finish is longer than most romantic comedies. Such a complex and amazing brew.  I could drink a good bit of this if I were to throw caution to the wind. An excellent beer and worth buying by the case.

259,1708,zachisspeaking,4.76,"I bought a bottle of this beer at the local beer shop, and had a glass after my stew lunch. The tase, exceptional. The smell---okay for a bottle.  But later that night I went over to Bob's Keg and Cork, and serendipity or providence had it that Bob had this beer on tap. It wasn't there last saturday.  The freshness is impossible to describe; a trappist beer on tap is heaven with a creamy head.  This is the quintessential Belgian Quad. No immitators, even New Belgium's Lips of Faith Series, can match this nearly.  At 10 percent alcohol, you can't feel it. It is such a well balanced brew. The malts are not too dominant; the bitter character is reminiscent of angustoro.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

S- A pleasant boozy smell that is closer to a rich wine than a beer. Usually that turns me off, but this beer uses that to draw one in to its charms.  T- So much going on here, that words escape me. The malt base holds up a very fruity and fig rocking beer. There is an easy sweetness that changes as the beer warms.  M- Medium that goes down nice and easy. The active carbonation smooths out the alcohol that is very obivious.  D- I can't add any more to the joys that have been written about this beer.

Flavor is very complex and everchanging, a bready yeasty malt with notes of grapes,cherries,clove,wood,some burbon like flavors at times, more dates and rasins as it warms.

259,1708,drtth,4.74,"Lightly chilled and poured into a Duvel glass. Glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically. The date code is blurred but this should be from a September of 08 bottling.  Appearance: Upon opening the bottle the beer foams up out of the bottle mouth and into the glass. The beer pours a dark brown with reddish undertones and a 1 ½"" light tan head that quickly fades leaving a ring around the glass, lots of small speckled lacing and a thin layer of foam on the liquid. Sipping consistently leaves lacing.  Smell: The aroma contains bready notes, hints of yeast and sweet candi sugar. There is also a component of dark caramel malt or carmelized sugar with some dark fruits (plum, raisins). I don't tire of this aroma and it seems new and fresh every time.  Taste: The flavor contains sweetness and hints of bitterness with flavors of plum, malt and raisin. There is some vanilla in here and a slight hint of alcohol. But the impression is of a dynamic balance, with flavors bouncing back and forth over the back of the tongue but without any one flavor becoming dominant.  Mouthfeel: The mouth feel is medium bodied with light creamy carbonation. The finish is medium long, lightly bitter and dry.  Drinkability: This complex beer is quite nice for sipping and the aroma and flavors almost seem to become even more complex with time. But one does not tire of them as is the case with some beers. At 10% ABV this is a one a night beer, but one I'll be revisiting in the future. This is one beer that illustrates why drinking beer can be a true pleasure.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,wagenvolks,4.37,"750ml corked & caged bottle into an oversized wine glass.  Not quite sure how I went so long without reviewing St. Bernie's ABT 12; after all, I've only had it about 10 times! Nevertheless, this classic Quad pours a translucent, mahogany-tea color with a superbly retained tuft of khaki head that attaches itself as thick webbing to the inside of the glass. Fantastic aroma, with sweet caramelized raisins, toffee, fig, faint chocolate notes, and a dash of pungent, floral hops.  Mmmm...gotta love the Bernardus. First come rich, chewy notes of dark fruit such as raisin, fig, and apricot. Then unfolds complex layers of caramel and chocolate malts. Lastly, a dusting of spice and earthen hops leave a peppery bitterness along the back of the palate that mingles with a nice booziness. Body is a bit too over-carbonated for my liking, but finally mellows after ~20 minutes in the glass. Still, the medium-thickness is relatively slick and smooth on the whole. St. Bernardus ABT 12 is the greatest Belgian friend you'll ever have; always there in the clutch, and the company is never disappointing.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Riccymon,3.62,"After uncorking the 750mL bottle, I have to pour quickly to avoid losing any beer, but it's not a terrible gusher. Still, the first pour into my goblet is 80% head. After two more pours, I finally have the glass filled with an impenetrable black beer and a finger and a half of frothy, off-white head. Even the foam is delicious--sweet and creamy like a root beer float. I've never seen so much lacing from a beer before.  Expecting a rich, full nose, I'm a little disappointed in the fairly bland smell I pick up. Some spicy clove, plum, and not too much more. In the taste, however, these flavors are tasty and magnified. The first couple of sips have an annoying metallic taste, but I think it was just a matter of getting used to the alcohol. There are also herbal, grassy notes in there that I don't pick up right away.  Mouthfeel is fairly creamy and medium-bodied with a small alcohol burn in the finish. Also, the spicy flavors leave my mouth feeling a little sticky. One glass into the bottle, I'm feeling its effects, but I imagine its drinkability is average for the style.  This is a big beer, but I'm glad I finally had the chance to try this one.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Almost the perfect smell. No hint of the 10.5% alcohol by volume  T: Ridiculous.... This is my favorite Quad to date. And that says alot when compared to the two higher ranked ones. Nice spicy taste with a great dried fruit kick. No major alcohol taste. Perfect beer in my honest opinion.  M: Right on here. No major burn, just a very complex yet perfect mouthfeel.  D: I almost drank this too fast. It really is perfect. I could drink this all day and all night. I am sure that would not please my wife but I can't stop.

I'm not sure if this is a sign of a ruined beer or not, and I have nothing to compare it to as this is the first time I've had St. Bernardus 12.  In any case, it, for the most part, fits the description of the majority of the reviews here; I'm no longer concerned as much about this bottle being ""ruined.""  Poured into my Westmalle chalice, it's a deep brown with a small tan head. Good lacing. I'm getting all the fruity, sweet smells, and there's a good balance sweetness and spice in the taste. The alcohol is well-hidden, and despite the incredibly complex taste profile, it's so balanced that it's very easy to drink.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,rwdkosak,4.38,"This is a great beer and I'm pretty sure that to date this will be the highest rating I've given.  Poured at cellar temp into Westmalle chalice finding a nice 1.5cm frothy and light head over dark brew that smelled of sweet malts, floral, almost raisen and carmel-like nose to me. The head melts throughout the session but doesn't fully dissipate which is nice. Taste is again full of raisen/currant sweetness, malt, carmel later..floral notes and alcohol at the finish that more than hints at the higher %ABV. Mouthfeel is quite good, in my opinion very drinkable though obviously one to sip and savor.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,MDekker,4.62,"A: Poured into a cheap chalice - nice rich mahogany color, not a substantial head, but a nice coating over the top that sustained itself throughout. Serious floaties that are visible through the glass. I tried to decant it, but if I stopped when some sediment started to come through, I would have left half the bottle. So, I went for nearly all of it.  S: Very rich aromas of dark fruit, like grape juice, mixed with dark grain, licorice, and clove (?). Very interesting and compelling.  T: Incredibly potent - I can't get away from the adjective ""rich"" - so flavorful, of ripened fruit, grape juice (again), spices, and plenty of malty. Not much bitterness, but a pleasant finish. Noticeable alcohol, but in balance with everything else.  M: Right like it should be.

Taste is great, fruity with dark chocolate and a small amount of spice with a very small hint of alcohol. I'm surprised I cannot taste more of the alcohol since it's a 10.5%er. Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Very smooth and has a nice clean finish.

Smell: Slightly nutty with dried fruit, yeast, cane sugar, you can start to pick up some alcohol notes in there as well. Reminiscent of Brandy aromas.  Taste/Mouthfeel: More fruit. Figs come to the forefront, also sweet dates, something almost berry-like in there I can't put my finger on. Brandy-esque alcohol notes even more present here along with oily nuts and some spice. A pleasant, difficult to define, earthy quality that brings to mind Trappist Quads like Rochefort 10 and Westvleteren 12. Great light mouthfeel avoids the syrupy feel some other beers of this ABV have.  Drinkability: Very drinkable for the style, although for obvious reasons Belgian Quads are not by any means session beers. Two of these is enough.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

D- Despite the dark color and nature of this beer, it still leaves a light and up lifting flavor. Despite the high ABV it is a smooth sip from start to end.

Head was robust at first but died down to a surprisingly small crown with little of that characteristic beligan lacing.  Smell is of dark bready malts, some fruits. Not as champagne like as the Westy 12, more dark fruits involved.  Taste is similar to smell, a darker tasting Westy 12. Bread/Belgian yeast is present, alcohol is surprisingly not. I actually prefer this to what I felt was an overly boozy Westy.  Mouth is relatively thin and bubby, exactly like it needs to be.  I hate to keep comparing this to the Westvleteren 12 but it's impossible not to. With that said, I feel that Berny is the superior beer.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,tr4nc3d,3.75,"Thanks to ""mikereaser"" for this one. Acquired in a trade.  Well I have been wanting to try this beer for months now but its not available in my area so Im glad I get to finally try this brew. Its been said its a lot similar to Westveleteren 12 so here goes.  Poured this into my St.Bernardus glass which I have been waiting to use. This pours a light brown color mixed with some hints of orange in there when held to the light. Two finger off-white head that leaves a top layer of bubbles throughout the beer. Some lacing clings to the glass as you keep gobbling down the beer.  Smell is very much like a westy 12. I get yeast, spices, dried fruits, and a faint alcohol smell.  You can definately taste the yeast upfront with a little bitterness which mellows out to a sweet malty taste and finishes again with a spicy bitterness. The booz in this one can be tasted. Once again this reminds me like a Westy 12 which I had a couple times.  Mouthfeel is creamy and high on carbonation. Spicy alcohol taste is there again.  Well overall this definately is a cheaper version of the Westy 12. Drinkability is not high for me and I could not see myself drinking more then one.

Taste is also sweet with a slight tartness to it. One can notice the sweetness probably from the sugar that is added. Alcohol is noticeable. The aftertaste lingers for while.  M & D is overall good.

Dried fruit noted prevail: raisin, prune and a slight caramel that is deep enough to be toffee. banana too.Very nice.  Taste: Dried plum, a hint of green apple, and dark caramel/brown sugar. Aftertaste is caramel turning into toffee, All the while I get a slight hop bitterness that helps balance out all the malty sweetness. This drys out fairly quickly, but following this there is an alcohol warmth that lingers on. I do find the carbonation to be a bit biting, and find myself swirling the beer to try to get some fizz out.  Mouthfeel: full yet not overbearing. Right on for the style.  Overall: My first time trying this beer, and I am indeed impressed. Wonderful beer.

The only downside was the amount of sediment in the glass/bottle. It was a bit too much and was impossible to decant. S: Raisin, dates, banana, clove, and overall very malty and sweet smelling. An excellent aroma. T: Provides a great balance of sweet, bitter, and a tiny bit of sourness. Smoky, spicy, with a very well hidden alcohol burn at the end. M: A bit sticky, but very full bodied with a good amount of carbonation. D: A real treat. I savored this 4 pack over a span of about 3 months. I didn't look forward to the day it would be gone, but I know I can always pick some up at the store. Excellent availability, excellent taste, and not too heavy body allow this beer to be consumed in almost any season. It is quite drinkable for a quad.

259,1708,taylorhamrick,3.79,"Pours out a hazy dark brown, with some ruby highlights. The head fluffs up then fades back, leaving very little lacing, but a thin layer of bubbles sits on top for quite a while. A little light and a little less frothy than I like, but still looks good. The smell reminds me a little bit of pipe tobacco, with very earthy, woody notes and some dark fruits, whiffs of alcohol and sugar, like rum and raisins. There's also a bit of dryness mixed in with a kind of bitter chocolate smell. A lot of complexity in the smell, but I'm not sure if it smells as rich as some quads. The taste hardly matches the smell as well as I'd hope. At first there a caramel taste, like a good, clean dubbel, mixed in with a heavy earthy flavor. Then the dryness kicks in. There's also a spiciness, peppery and almost like Indian spices, with warming, almost harsh alcohol. After getting into the drink, I notice a kind of candy sweetness in the finish. It isn't bad, kind of like the cleanest of quads, but it lacks the really enjoyable depth, and the huge spicy, earth (read: tobacco) notes don't bring it to where I expect. The mouthfeel is nice and chewy, but not entirely full. The carbonation is also a bit annoying, it stings the tongue and mouth with every sip. But it is still about what I'd expect.

A nice 3 finger head is formed which slowly dissipates into thin coat on the beer after a few minutes and a few sips. Beer is dark chocolate brown in color with ample yeast floaties (I did pour the entire bottle into the beer as I enjoy the yeast). Nose is very complex with a mix of dark fruits, chocolate, nutmeg and some spices . . . a very rich and tantalizing aroma; really can't imagine anything better. Taste, I wish I could explain why I rated this a 5.0 but I can't other than to say it's amazingly delicious and complex. It's strong and you can taste the alcohol but it's balanced out nicely by some sweet maltness and a little bitterness in finish.

S - A wonderful mixture of spices, yeast, sweet malt, and dried fruits.  T - This is one complex beer. Sweet malts upfront provide flavors of dried fruits. Apples, bananas, and pears. The heavy yeast reminds me of sweet cinnamon bread. Finishes smooth with little alcohol burn.  M - Very creamy and just perfect on the tongue.

Smell - 4.5 Cocoa, subtle raisins and cherries, cloves and a little pepper at the end.  Taste - 4.5 Rich, malty, spicy, boozy and really, really good. Tastes of cocoa, pepper, liquor soaked pudding with raisins, cloves, faint pear and woodiness in the boozy finish.  Mouthfeel - 5.0 A truly lush mouthfeel, fine and lively carbonation, goes down far too easily for one so strong, alcohol is warming.  Drinkability - 4.0 More than two would be an excess, the only thing that detracts from drinkability is the alcohol, which is more evident than in some strong Belgian ales.  OVERALL - 4.5 This is a strong, boozy beer, so don't make the mistake I did and pour it too cold. The closer it got to room temperature, the better it tasted, finishing with a flavour that is closer to Westvleteren 12 than anything else I have tried (although better balanced, as it is considerably less sweet than the Westy).

Smells like rootbeer (I'm not kidding), with those dark fruits like figs and plums and a powerful sweetness riding on the ethers. If I could give its taste a ""10"" I would. It's one layer of dark fruitiness upon another, each one revealing something different as its rich body slowly expands into a fine bubbly mass that fills the mouth.

Best by 12 07 11 poured into a Duvel tulip  Pours a dark reddish brown with a huge 2+ fingers of dense moussy light tan head that recedes very slowly and leaves copious amounts of lacing. Aroma is quite good, lots of malt and some dark fruity esters. The malt presence has lots of Munich and is bready with some slight caramel. Moderate dark fruity esters include some raisins and figs. Alcohol aroma are low in intensity and quite soft. Flavor is quite similar to the aroma. Overall this beer is quite malty but still moderately dry. The alcohol provides a balance to the strong malt profile. Fruity esters are more prominent here than in the aroma and lean a bit more towards figs and maybe some dried cherries. Mouthfeel is good, medium bodied, moderately high carbonation and some smooth alcohol warmth. Drinkability is pretty darn good, the high ABV is well masked, the flavors are complex and meld together quite well, and the beer is properly attenuated.

259,1708,Arbitrator,4.82,"Chilled bottle into a glass, courtesy of Uwftke26.  A: Pours a murky mahogany with reddish / gold tint when held to the light. Slow and generous carbonation up the sides of the glass. Unfortunately, this was a gusher when opened, so it poured with several inches of fluffy cream-colored head that left sticky lacing down the glass as it receded. The final appearance is half an inch of thick foam patches filming on top of the drink, and substantial lacing down the glass.  S: Caramel malt, brown sugar, molasses. Fruity and slightly sour Belgian yeast produces hints of candied apples, raisins, plums, and apricot. Spices include clove and cinnamon. Quite a rich nose. No alcohol detected, and at 10% that's a hell of an accomplishment.  T: Follows the nose, but mixes up the order. The initial taste is a spicy groundwork of clove and cinnamon. A sweet backbone of caramel malt, brown sugar, and molasses follows. Then a complex sweet and sour fruit mixture of apple, plum, apricot, and raisin enters the picture, with a slight bready malt touch. As the beer warms, I detect hints of vanilla and cream. Superbly complex. I've had very few beers that match this.  M: Full-bodied and just higher than medium carbonation, which works against the style. A small warming effect from the alcohol, but nothing too offensive. I've been told that this beer benefits from being laid down for a few years, and after trying it, that's my initial instinct, too. It's good young and it has the potential to age well.  D: Very high. I don't know if I'd get a bomber of this, because it would put me on my ass. But I'd love to have a few more singles, and I'll search around for them. This is undoubtedly one of the most complex and delicious brews I've ever had, and I will sing its praises.

I noticed a lot of yeast sediment in this pour. It will leave some off white lacing down the entire glass.  It has so many smells to it that I'm sure I won't be able to point out all of them but here goes. Smells of sweet caramel malts, brown sugar, molasses, fruity raisins and alcohol.  This brew is full bodied and silky smooth. It has strong sweet malt flavors, brown sugar, raisins and will wash down a little bit dry due to the high ABV.  This is a great beer to sip on, very creamy and pleasant.

Pours a very rich, mahogany/amber color with a very thick and pretty white head. Man, the head just looks so tight and creamy its almost unreal.  Smell is lots of dark fresh and baked fruit. Its very sweet smelling, like candied apples, caramel, sugar cane, brown sugar and maybe some sweet cherries as well. Very intense.  Taste is equally as fruity, like a mouthful of sweet, alcoholic stewed fruit. Wow, so intense and flavorful. I'd like to say I sipped the 12 oz of this chalice worthy beer but it was tough not to take sizeable gulps. Very delicious stuff.  This is a flawless quad in my opinion.

It fades after a while, but traces remain to the end. Body is dark brown with barely any light getting through. Good amount of lacing.  S: Mainly dark fruits. Also a big-time blast of spicy Belgian yeast.  T: All about sweet dark fruits. Yeast is more subdued than the nose would indicate. Some alcohol burn as well.  M: Nice and creamy with good carbonation.  D: If you like dark fruits, this is absolutely the beer for you. Truth be told, though, the sweetness does become a bit cloying after a while.

259,1708,thirdeye11,4.82,"Presentation: Poured from a 750ml corked and caged bottle into a Duvel tulip glass.  A: This beer pours a beautiful dark brown color with yeasty sediment all throughout the beer. Pours a 2+ finger head which recedes slowly; retains nice lacing throughout the entire drinking session.  S: This beer has a complex smell profile. Dark fruits abound in the nose, brown sugar in the back of the nose, very sweet smells here. Swirling the glass intensifies the awesome smell and revives a good bit of head at any time while I drink this. No alcohol detectable in the smell at all.  T: This beer is astoundingly good. Probably the best beer I have ever had. I have gone back to St. Bernardus Abt 12 many times, and am never disappointed. Taste reminds me of what a really good soda should be. Lots of nice dark fruit flavors, very hidden alcohol profile. I would never have known this is 10%+ unless I paid attention. Not too sweet, malty, hoppy or anything. This beer is perfectly balanced with no one component overpowering the other. The yeast is also amazing as I get bready notes occasionally. The complexity still surprises me every time I drink it because with each drink there is a different taste. The flavors only get better as this beer warms to its ideal temperature in the 55+ degree range. Make sure you hold your hand on as much of the glass as possible to get this to the right temperature.  M: The carbonation, viscosity, and overall mouthfeel of this beer is amazing. The only way I could think to improve it would be to maybe make it only slightly creamier, but without changing the flavor profile (something I am completely against) I'm not sure how it would be accomplished. Still nothing is perfect.  D: Due to the intense flavors it is definitely a sipper, but one that I can enjoy several glasses of in one evening and never ever get tired of it. I'm not sure exactly what drinkability means, but I assume it means you can drink a lot of them. I can, but I am also limited not only by the intense flavors, but the alcohol content. Regardless I can sip this beer all night.  Overall, St. Bernardus Abt 12 is one of the beers that got me into the position I am today with enjoying new and unique beers. The guy who first told me to buy a single 11oz of it in California (Sean from the Pizza Port Bottle Shop) probably has no clue the maelstrom he unleashed upon me when he recommended this beer, but this is the one that started it all for me. Despite all of that, it is still hands down my favorite beer in the world. I highly recommend this to anyone who has not tried it.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

259,1708,everetends,4.28,"11.2 oz bottle I bought quite a while back in a brewery mix pack, but somehow I forgot about the ABT 12. Well, tonight is the night. Served up in my St. Bernardus goblet.  A: Pours a really rich and deep dark mahogony brown. This is more dark brown than it has red hues, but the red is there barely. THe head is really beautiful. A really rich and frothy light tan head with just a slight pink hue to it, rests easily on top at almost a full finger. I have been nursing this for a while and then head just has great retention. The lace is on the glass and has a good amount of stick to it, but the foam is just too heavy. It slowly slides back down into the glass, furthering the lasting head. Just a great looking beer.  S: Smell is real nice with some boozy wood at first. There is a really nice malty presece that comes out almost at the same place the yeast does. Then comes some nice plum and raisin scents. There is also an earthiness that comes out with the fruits as well. Very nice.  T: Taste is just damned good. That malty goodness is just barely sweet while mingling with the belgian yeast. The boozy wood is here in the flavor as well but it is not as bad as the nse lets on. Lot of fruit going on here. Plum, raisin, dark grape, apple skins. There is also a slight flavor of some nuts roasted in brown sugar. So good.  M: Light side of full in body, but this beer has some weight to it. Has a really nice silky smoothness to it, creamy. ABV comes out a bit with a slight heat on the palate, throat and stomach but it works very nicely with the flavors going on here. After taste is mostly of some wood with some boozy apple and plum. Carbonation is damn near perfect for this brew.  D: There is no doubt that this beer is amazing and lives up to its place on the top 100 brews. It does have a heaviness to it and it does sit a bit heavy in the stomach though. I wouldn't go as far as saying I would stop here, but I would definitely stop at a 750 of this. The flavor, look, aroma and feel are all on point, but you still have to remember this is a big beer.

259,1708,jaxon53,4.82,"It's been quite a while since I've had one of these, so I figured it was time to revisit. What a great beer it is. Served at cellar temperature, in a Westy chalice, from a stubby 11.2 ounce brown bottle.  Appearance: Abt 12 pours out a deep mohagony brown color I guess you would say, but looks a fiery burnt orange when held to a light. A rather easy pour yielded a massive, thick off-white head that was about three fingers high. Maybe the most perfect head I've seen on a beer. Head settled very slowly into a thick, creamy mass of foam that was about three quarters of an inch thick. Each sip left a thick ring of lace behind on the glass. What a beautiful beer.  Smell: A great nose as well. A huge, thick, malty aroma that smelled quite sweet. Hints of raisin and plum stand out. Touches of wood and peppery spice are also noted. A slight Belgian yeast shows itself as well. Very fruity and earthy. Just a tiny bit of booze in the nose.  Taste: Definitely a bit of a fruity flavor out front. Raisins with a bit of rum com to mind. A slight plum flavor pairs up nicely with the raisin. Noticing a caramel flavor deep in the background with a touch of wood. Finishes with a smooth booziness, and a little spice. Quite complex in my opinion.  Mouthfeel: Beautiful, full bodied mouthfeel on this brew. Slightly thick and perfectly carbonated.  Drinkability:This beer is, in my opinion, is a sipper. It is quite drinkable overall, but the alcohol in will get you.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

It is extremely well made with flavors of clove, and brown sugar with grains and dark fruits followed by a creamy smooth finish.

259,1708,basscram,4.43,"This beer is my #1. How come I never reviewed it before now? Maybe I was seduced!  This beer poured from a caged and corked 25oz bottle is a dark golden brown, like ice cold tea from a pitcher. sparkly white bubbles dance as the goblet glass is filled that I drink from. Head is a wet froth, not creamy. goes away slowly but not so slow as to keep you from drinking it.  The head is about an inch thick or less. Smells like caramel malt to me. Its just the right sweetness too. A dark kinda sweet but an aroma of a tiny bit of bitter. Thats how it smells to me. There is another smell I cannot describe, but it is the only beer I know of with this smell.  The head of the beer once again, has a slight sweet irony light taste to it. First cool sip is has the sweet prunish alcohol hit to it. As it dashes over the tongue, it absorbs all the alcohol and the taste comes through. As my tongue becomes used to the higher alcohol content, and well, as before, the tastes come. A few more sips and I taste some rum cake taste, if that explains it. not quite a carrot cake taste.  If I let the beer sit under my tongue, it froths up... cause it wants to be swallowed I guess! It does that though. Lacing is exceptionally thick this time. When it warms, is when you can really enjoy it. Kinda tastes like a tad bit of brown sugar and angel cake sometimes. The alcohol becomes more grain tasting. but is not intense as when it was cold. Also I may add, there is a caramelish taste that I taste slightly.  Well, that sums it up. I love this beer but better in the bottle than on tap. My tastes. Good to the last drop. Will always be my favorite and as my tastes grow, I will be able to taste more in this.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,ThatWineGuy,4.03,"I got the second pour from a well-aged bottle, it appeared chestnut brown to me with suspended yeast particles. Mocha head was one finger in my Chimay goblet with low carbonation and a stagnant centre of large bubbles just hanging out. The diminishing head could be reproduced with a swirl that would just cover the surface area, carbonation on the low side.  The aroma was distinct but hard to describe: patent leather, brussel sprouts, mild tobacco. The taste was semi-sweet, semi-bitter, pine, sour dark fruit, caramel malt. The finish was long and distinctive, a bit tart with sour fruit and dry. The problem with evaluating a beer like this is that we're so seldom able to fidn them in these parts, it's hard to know what to compare it to. Having enjoyed the St. Bernardus 8 the other night, I have to confess that I enjoyed that much more than this. The mouthfeel here was, for lack of kinder words, somewhat lacquer-like and cleansing and that took away from a more impressive rating overall. Mind you, I'm well aware of the reputation of this brew and I'd love to try it again ... but if I said it knocked my socks off, I'd be stretching the truth quite a bit - good plus some, but not outstanding on this night, at least not for me.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,biegaman,4.72,"Dry plum that turns a vivid, lustrous black cherry when held up to the light - you wouldn't expect such dazzle from a beer that otherwise appears so conservative. The beer really changes its place on the light spectrum when back lit, it jumps at least a full octave brighter. Its surface is mildewed with a firm but feathery hat of off-white ostrich fur. Curiously, it opts not to leave any markings down the side of the glass. Still, the beer looks luscious.  Give me a couple minutes to collect my thoughts about this aroma... and exhale. At its base it's bready and yeasty but it's coated with layers of dimension. Listed least to most prominent: herbal cooking spices, mostly clove but hints of black pepper, cinnamon and ginger as well; secondly, dried fruits (prunes, raisins) doused in brown sugar and caramelized under a scorching hot flame; lastly, the most rich and soothing note of pure bourbon vanilla.  The taste of whole grain bread, toasted and smeared with some sort of prune, raisin or currant jam is hearty and delicious. This taste resembles an Hors d'age Armagnac - it exhibits flavours of ripe, dried and preserved fruits (orange, prune, apricot, apple, pear), spices (vanilla, cocoa, cinnamon, mint, pepper), nuts (almond, hazelnut, brasil nut) as well as dried flowers, watery honey, tobacco, leather and oak. It is layered with flavour.  St. Bernardus Abt 12 drinks like it's been slowly matured in oak casks for years. It drinks velvety smooth but with a tremendously rich texture. It shows no indication of its strength. The flavours have mellowed and blended together so intricately that pin-pointing precisely what you're drinking can be difficult. It has a dimension not often achieved unless allowed to evolve in a barrel. Perhaps this is merely the work of a pure and ancient yeast strain?  In my mind, there is no doubt this is the Armagnac of Belgium: its colour is striking, its bouquet intensely aromatic, its flavours endless and personally subjective, its disposition elegant, smooth, and refined and its story is one rooted in the geography, culture, and history of where it's made. I'm no expert on French brandies or spirits, but I know my beer, and there are few that I'd put ahead of this for meal pairings or after-dinner digestifs.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

259,1708,superdedooperboy,4.23,"Popping the cap causes an eruption of foam to issue forth from the mouth. Poured into a goblet, the brew shows dark chestnut with a massive tan head, which slowly settles to a thick half-finger layer of foam that remains for the rest of the draught, leaving behind curtains of lace on the glass. Bits of yeast dance around in suspension when the brew is held to the light.  The nose is rather spicy, with cinnamon and nutmeg, perhaps a passing hint of clove, along with plums and a whiff of figs.  Surprisingly light on the palate, with a medium body that beguiles the beer's maltiness. Sweet caramel malt flavors mingle on the tongue with raisins, figs, and spice, with a sharp dryness that carries into the semi-sweet finish.  The wonderful balance of sweet, spice, and dryness combine to make this an incredibly easy-drinking beer that hides its strength well, which is sneaky and goes straight from the glass to the head, skipping the palate altogether, albeit with perhaps a slight warming on the way down.

Lots of head on the pour, maybe 4 fingers wide, settled down after a few minutes into a really creamy head that sort of floats onto the sides of the glass. 1/2 finger width ring of head remains until the last drop.  I pick up some awesome yeasty qualities in the aroma. There's an earthiness there with a nice vibrant red fruity tone. Figs, raisins, strawberries, and raspberries fresh from the vine.  Taste is sublime. The reason I like this so much more than others is because the yeast does not take over the overall flavor profile. The malt backbone is exquisite, starts slightly bready with some caramel and then quickly migrates towards beautiful ripe dark fruits. Raspberries, blackberries, stawberries, figs, plums, raisins and cherries all come to mind. Finishes up with a little bit of vanilla and some earthy pepper from the yeast and hops.  The bubbles are very small which creates a nice mouthfeel that is right on the money. It's smooth yet lively, and dances softly on the tongue. The body is just the right density as well, slick yet not too heavy, velvety.  Extremely hard to find the alcohol content anywhere in the flavor profile. Mellow on the swallow as well, don't feel the warming effect. So complex and interesting though that I enjoyed this slowly over the course of an hour.

Very thick and chewy, but the tastes don't initially hit you that way. In your mouth you only get a small taste of the rich malty sweetness until you swallow. THEN the full flavor hits you. It finishes very very strongly with a strong (but slightly chalky) malty sweet flavor. Alot of flavors in here. Slight smokiness, sweet fruity flavors, like rasins and dates, very very strong malts. As it warms the alcohol is very noticible, but very warming.

A warming alcohol note handles the finish.  M- Full/medium bodied, fizzy yet smooth.  D- I keep having to remind myself of the strength.

S - Caramel malts, raisins and cloves assault the nose. Sweet smell is overwhelming and immediately starts my salivatory glands to gush.  T - Cloves and fruit dominate at first giving a wonderful sweetness. Shortly there after there is an almost sourness that comes with the bite of an apple or a plum not yet ripe. Complex malts and yeast make this a an exceptional beer.  M - Highly carbonated, leaves the palate slick and clean waiting for and wanting more.  D - Entirely to drinkable.

It pours an opaque black-mahogany color with yeast visible at the bottom and all around the sides (and in the head). The head is large a dark tan and the lacing is great. It smells like Belgium Yeast largely. I can pick up a few fruits, mostly dark fruits with a hint of sour grapefruit. The taste is great, only held back by the alcohol coming on a bit too strong. The flavor is powerfull overall though, as a mix of dark fruits and malts with an interesting bitter & sour finish. Even while cold, this beer is still great, and it is hard for me to wait for the Abt 12 to warm. It's a nice beer to have a couple of, but the price and high ABV may prevent you from going all out on this beer. Highly Recommended.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

However, I believe my expectations were too high for this brew, since it was a bit of a letdown from the Westy. This is not to say, though, that this isn't an outstanding brew on its own.  A: Very strong pitch color that turns blood red in the light. Slight, almost unnoticeable thin head.  S: Sweet molasses, caramel, dates, cloves, and other spices. Alcohol is present but not overwhelming.  T: Very malty and bready. Possesses a strong, complex, earthy, and biscuity flavor. Caramels, coffee, chocolate, dark fruits, all there. Somehow, though, the flavors seem to be going to war with each other in your mouth instead of complementing each other.  M: Smooth and creamy; leaving an oily and slick feeling afterwards.  D: Drinkable, but definitely a sipper. Just the mere gassiness and heaviness of this ale makes it hard to finish the bottle.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

I thought it was finally time to give this beer its due. Poured from a 25.7 oz bottle into a Rochefort chalice.  A- Pours a dim, ruby color with hints of brown throughout. Produced a fingers width of off-white head that dissipated quickly.  S- Rather complex. Detected hints of raisins and plums mixed with sharp notes of candied sugars. The malt presence reveals a sharp, alcohol booze scent that pierces the nostrils. Just layer upon layer of things that I cannot even describe.  T- Cloves provide a subtle and distinct sweetness that first grabs the tongue. As this passes the various dark fruits make their presence felt, giving off wonderful flavors. Layered on top of this is a great combination of malt and burnt sugars. Finishing off each sip is a nice, alcohol burn that just warms you up.  M- If there was one fault I could find in this beer, this is it. With every sip that I took, the beer seemed to have a highly carbonated feel, giving off a bubbly, soda type imitation. I was hoping for something with a little more viscosity.  D- The unique part about this beer is that it doesn't try to hide the 10% abv. Instead, it embraces the alcohol and utilizes it as part of the experience.  Overall, this will always be one of my all-time favorites. It's one of the first beers from the craft world that I had, and it will be one that I will always come back to. Highly recommended!",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

T- Caramel and dark fruit sweetness, lots of plum with a hint of raisin. A little bit of hops come through but are overpowered by sweet complex malt character. Some roasted almonds and hints of charcoal. Your mouth is left with a nice sweet almost fruity after taste that makes you want to keep drinking, also some alcohol warmth in the end.

Leaves a very strong taste in your mouth that's quite pleasing. It's very rare that a beer keeps a smile on my face for the entire drink, this was just amazing.

259,1708,Soneast,4.37,"Mmmmm. I love quads and this one is an old favorite!  Pours a cloudy dark brown color with burgundy highlights. The light brown colored head erupts to about 1 inch in size, then slowly recedes to a 1/4 inch layer of cream that leaves a delicious ""beer mustache"" with each sip.  Very complex aroma in this beer. I detect predominately dark fruits, raisins and such, with a lot of sweet malts and brown sugar-ish aromas and a pretty rich booziness.  Flavor is awash in sweet malts, dark fruits, brown sugar, toffee, booze, buttered bread. I generally cannot detect the flavors that some people describe in their beers but when it comes to Belgian Quads and Trappists in particular it's hard not to have all these various flavors run through your mind. They really are THAT complex! The only thing it doesn't have is hops and associated bitterness...which is A OK.  Heavy body with mild carbonation. Such a rich beer that improves decidedly as it warms like most quads. So flavorful yet quite strong. Easy to drink but a careful sipper.

259,1708,ThirdLap,4.63,"St. Bernardus Abt 12 has been a long-time favorite of mine, and is what I consider to be the best widely available Belgian beer. Let's see how it stands up after a long hiatus since my last tasting.  Pours a deep mahogany brown with a centimeter thick light-tan head into my St. Bernardus goblet. The head begins to dissipate slightly after a few minutes, leaving these honeycomb-shaped figures floating in the remaining creamy covering. Slight agitation causes a quick return of head. This is an awesome-looking beer.  Tons going on in the nose. I get banana, pears, green apples, raisins, and plums. Very sweet smelling, with little of the cough syrupyness that seems to affect many big Belgians. Perhaps a touch of soapiness. Minimal hops. It is most definitely reminiscent of a Westy 12.  The first sip spurs sensations in a Joycesque stream-of-consciousness from me. I find myself thinking faster than I can type: fantastic carbonation, caramel, sweet dark fruits, nougat, brown sugar, raisins, figs, spices, butter, and cherries. No other beer has thrown this many adjectives at me all at once.  Alcohol is perfectly balanced, providing just a slight warming sensation. It is well-masked for a 10.5% abv beer. A slight bitter finish prevails, but even this is balanced in well, almost as though it was put there to encourage you to sample another taste of the much sweeter elixir sitting before you.  One of the most wonderful things about this beer is how much better it gets as it sits and warms. If you can hold out long enough for it to do so, you are in for quite a treat. Everything you've perhaps only been 'catching notes of' before is magnified, with new flavors coming forth with every taste. I can't help but think what an excellent beer this is for a beginning reviewer, as there is so much going on, yet nearly all of it is easily discernible and describable.  St. Bernardus Abt 12 has one of the most perfect mouthfeels of any beer I've ever had, with the carbonation and thickness coating every inch of your mouth just right. Holding it in the mouth provides these little peppery explosions on your tastebuds, with all of the flavors coming together just right as you begin to swallow.  Drinkability? Jesus, I could live on this stuff.  One of the top five beers I've ever had, and every bit as good as Westy.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,aletales,4.18,"To be able to pack this kind of punch in ABV and keep the drinkablility this high is a credit to the brewer's art.

It was there, but not overwhelming. It was pleasantly thick and velvety on my tongue, and it soon had me smiling.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

It looks like that crazy organic unrefined apple juice you buy at hippy stores, not that light colored Mott's crap. The taste and mouthfeel here are certainly the highlights. It tastes different depending on where you let it travel in your mouth - but definitely a deep malty, caramel/honey flavor that overwhelms everything in there.

259,1708,KeefD,4.57,"Pours a very lovely, hazy dark amber color with a one finger off-white head that fell slowly to a nice lasting cap and left very little lacing. Very yeasty aroma, dark fruit, raisins in particular, grainy, grassy, earthy. Taste is very complex, lots of great things going on here. Raisin flavor is predominant, followed by some grape flavor that was also present in the Prior 8, apples, light chocolate, a peppery spiciness in the middle, rum booziness, grassy hops, light bitterness, and a long dry yeasty finish. There is so much going on in this beer it's hard to determine all the flavors. Very complex to say the least. As with all the other St. Bernardus offerings, carbonation is aggressive at first but mellows considerably as it warms up a bit in the glass. As the carbonation subsides it becomes creamy and the flavors really start to develop. This is easily the best of the St Bernardus mixed 4 pack that I got for my birthday from a very awesome GM. Glad I got to try these beers. As far as the 6, 8, and 12 go, they get better as the number gets higher.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Mouthfeel: Heavy mouthfeel but very smooth.  Drinkability: Very high drinkability for a quad, not gonna be able to pound down 3 of these but easy to drink a glass or two.

Dark fruit like raisins offer a nice characteristic. Not getting any hop profile, at least I can't make it out.  Taste: The presence on the palate is much like that of the nose, malty with loads of sweet characteristics. In addition, I thought it to seem somewhat biscuity and yeasty. Plus there was a little spicyness of the finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and highly carbonated. I found it to be crisp and very tasty. Seems to linger after the swallow causing the mouth to water for more.  Drinkability: The price of this abbey far outweighs my ability to contiuously enjoy this beer.

Low level of Belgian yeast and hop.  Rich and creamy, the alcohol is ever-present. A little oily in the body. The aftertaste reminds me of a swallow of brandy. The flavor has some hard-stone fruit tones, such as plum and cherry.  The story of this beer is the alcohol, which I find distracting. IMHO, the dilemma with Quads is that they are made extreme without placing stronger flavors in the brew (like darker malts or more hops).

Tasty roasted porter- or stout-like malts. Maybe coffee. Flavors are strong but smooth and subtle. Hops do not stand out, but are there and balance out the sweetness.  Mouthfeel is wonderful. So silky smooth which the right amount of carbonation.  Because it's such a rich brew with a lot of alcohol, you won't want to drink a lot of it. One 11.2 oz bottle is good for me.

The scent is of dark fruit, some spice, sweetness, Belgian maltyness. Hint of alcohol on the nose.  The taste is intensely complex...the only thing my taste buds could detect on the first sip was the boozy warmth. This is perfect on a cold night like tonight. Lots of dark fruit present, apple seems the most prominent with the others providing a solid backdrop. I'll admit, I was stunned at first. This thing hits you from every angle.

259,1708,Nesued,4.87,"Poured from an 11.2 fl oz bottle. Stamped with an ""08 05 13"" date on the back label.  Appearance - Develops a big frothy tan head upon pour, easy to over pour. Resolve to a small head with ample lacing that clings to the glass. Dark amber color with a haze due to the settled yeast (I swirl and add to mine).  Smell - The sweet malty nose jumps out at you, followed by a vanilla and a slight clove nose. A caramel aroma is present as well. Lots of complexity here and I'm just trying to describe the smell. Amazing.  Taste - Summary: Wonderfully sweet and smooth. An ample carbonation starts the transport of a sweet malty opening. The middle expands upon the rich malty taste to encompass the presence of the 10.5% ABV. The finish has just a slight bite, but not worth more than a brief mention.  Mouthfeel - An ample level of carbonation allows the expansion within your mouth. Rich and chewy with a sticky sweet retension on your lips.  Drinkability - No hop-heads here. In my opinion, this is one of the best beers around for those who prefer a deep, rich malt flavored beer. A good sipper and a good reason to explore Belgians.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

A but of spice and earth from the yeast. A dash of leather.  T - Major plum & fig notes, balanced by yeasty spices and earth notes. Alcohol burn is a bit sharp at the beginning, but this mellows somewhat as the beer warms.  M - Medium bodied, with bright carbonation. Dry finish. Dude, this is a SMOOTH beer!  D - The alcohol presence brings the score down, but I could still enjoy a few glasses of this. The bomber was a pleasure from top to bottom.

259,1708,roadhouse,4.32,"Poured from an 11.2 oz. bottle into a tulip glass. The first St. Bernardus bottle that hasn't foamed over on me.  Appears a somewhat hazy brownish red with a one inch off-white head that sinks to a skim that retains well throughout. There's some sediment visible when held up to the light but luckily this one is pretty dark. A bit of lacing is left behind.  Aroma is full of dark fruit like figs, raisins, plums, sweet dark cherries, as well as a hint of alcohol, some yeasty phenols, and a sugary sweetness.  The taste is about what I expected from the aroma with the sugary sweetness leading things off alongside the dark fruit flavors. Raisins and figs are what's coming to mind mostly. There are some spicy phenols but they are fairly subdued and leave to be followed by a rich turbinado sweetness. Some alcohol warmth is definitely noted on the finish with lingering fruit and trace phenols.  Mouthfeel is medium, verging on full. Pretty chewy, I'd prefer it be a bit lighter and effervescent.  I really like this Quad, it's almost up there with Westy and Rochefort, but not quite as good.

259,1708,Klgkenny,4.97,"Poured from a fridge temp bomber into a room temp, oversized wine glass.  A medium density, one finger head rests atop a murky brown, translucent body. When held up to a light, ruby accents appear around the glass and accentuate all the floaties that comprise so many vital nutrients... The head is a creamy off-white and dissipates after a minute or two, producing a delicate, full lace skirt down the edge of the glass.  Smells of grapes and malt. Very complex aromas lie underneath; I smell wood and alcohol, peppers and peppermint.  Tastes like heaven. I'm pretty sure that this is what Jesus turns water into. Grapes and spices. Cloves, pepper, peppermint, and alcohol. So much more.  This is a medium-heavy beer, but the carbonation cuts through the biggest flavors and the heavy body making it an orgasm in the mouth, but much better than the one from your college experimentation.  Even though this beer has such a high abv, I can (and have) sessioned this beer. The only drawback is the price, but aside from that, this is an all day beer.

My review is based on the glass I had last night at The Trappist in Oakland.  Pours a dark brown with a moderate head, good retention through most of the glass.  Smell was sweet, raisen & carmel were distinct.  Taste was complex. (I gotta start taking notes in the bar.) Just trust me, it was delicious. You didn't notice the 10% ABV.

Taste is rich with similar notes as in in the nose. Chocolate and caramel notes balance with fruit and spiciness. Not too sweet, extemely balanced actually, not only between sweetness and bitterness but also between all the many flavors present. There's plenty going on here but no one flavor really stands out- everything works perfectly together to make this one of the best tasting beers I've had.

Healthy head of light tan foam stood 1 1/2 inches tall. Good retention, and leaves nice webby lacing upon descent.  A: Port-like alcohol is quite pronounced, with some chocolate, dark fruit, belgian yeast, caramel and honey. Smells good!  T: Not too far from the nose. Hits the palate with sweet chocolate, caramel and honey. Dark fruits then work their way to the forefront to become much more pronounced. Tastes like chocolate-covered raisins with some plums and figs to boot. All of the flavors meld together so well, and provide great complexity to the brew. Finish is dry and full of port-like alcohol that is always present, but much more so in the back end. There is also a great belgian yeast flavor with some pepper that rounds out the finish and leaves a good aftertaste. Excellent!  M: Full-bodied, smoother than a baby's ass, creamy, and gently carbonated.  D: Let's just say that I was amazed at how fast my glass disappeared.  Notes: Extremely flavorful, great complexity, and a nice alcohol punch to make you notice it. This is one that every serious beer drinker should have at least once.

Taste: Upon first touching the tongue, the sweet malts surround the tongue. Highlighs of carbonation provide a great vehicle or flavor transfer. Very impressive. Caramel and a fruity/rasin flavor rolls across the palate. Excellent and impressive.  Mouthfeel: Wow. Wonderful flavor curve. Flavors mix well and tend to pleasantly suprise the palate.

I can only describe the first sip as breathtaking. It tastes much like the nose, dark fruits and a hint of milk chocolate, but also with some spice. Once you swallow your mouth is thirsting for more, but you cannot rush this, it must be savored. You feel a slight warmth of alcohol as it goes down and you can taste just a hint of it.

A deep rich mahogoney/black with a brown head which was small and subtle on the top of the liquid. It lingered for the majority of the brew, and left some strong lacing on the sides of the glass.  Where the begin on the aroma. The usual strong caramel and honey, but more intense with stone fruits thrown in the mix, which was interesting. Lot's of fig and tropical fruit. Insane.  A big sip brings in lots of raisin and dark fruits, with some sweeter tropical fruits aswell. It is similar to Rochefort 10, but with more tropical, sweeter fruits to it. Absolutely insane when trying to digest everything about this.  The alocohol is pretty much non-descript and it is insanely smooth. It honestly is like drinking Rochefet 10... times 10.

Poured slowly into a large wine glass this concoction pours a deep mahogany red with a very steady off white head. Some yeast inevitably found its way into the glass as I'm not sure how this had been stored. Drink by the 21st day of the 12th month of the 12th year. Hmmm! Lots of '12' going on here. Halfway through a surface film remained and continued to contribute to an artsy lacing.  Smell is sweet with raisin and fig and a touch of fresh dark cherry. Can one get intoxicated by smelling a beer?  Taste is rather complex and inviting. Dried fruits give way to a cherry flavor which then turns over to offer a bit of chocolate on a lingering finish, and only then reveals a bit of alcohol.  Feel is exquisite, with a carbonation that matches the flavor pretty precisely. This beer is strong and sweet, yet doesn't really come across to be either.

T - Figs, plums, very spicy to match the smell. A tasty and malty, complex sweetness that isn't matched by many ales I've had. Alcohol is noticeable, but no more than the other, weaker St. Bernardus offerings.  Very tasty for a quad, definitely a sipper but it's been difficult to keep the glass down. I've had this beer in a 750, and on tap, but this is the first time I've had it from a regular bottle. This is also the first time I've been able to truly sit down and thoroughly enjoy this beer. Would love to compare this to Rochefort, because I usually always think the Rochefort is better, but I'm not so sure now.

Light spices enter in at the end. The alcohol is hardly noticeable, except for the nice warming sensation it lends out.  Mouthfeel is great. Good thickness with a subtler carbonation than most other quads. Exceptionally smooth.  Drinkability is of course great. This is too easy to drink for 10.5%, and I can't imagine anyone finding something they really didn't like about this beer.

Taste: Fruity and a bit sweet, wonderful complexities here- though no one flavor tends to dominate. Hints of cherry, fig, black licorice. These qualities tend to be more pronounced as the beer warmed. Mouthfeel: Warming alcohol presence noted, medium-bodied feel- appropriate for the abbey profile.

The bottle describes it as a ""delicate bouquet"", and I'd be inclined to agree. It's nothing earth-shattering or super complex, but conversely, it smells like a quad is supposed to smell, and has an air of refinement to it that most faux-Belgians just can't mess with.  T - Big time prune and maltiness up front. Lots of boozey notes in the mouth, but surprisngly not as warming as expected. Finishes almost sweet, but a nice dryness comes in at the end to wrap it up. It's just a well-made quad, nothing more, nothing less.  M - Sparkly, but it works with the bigness of everything else. It's rather crisp for everything that's going on.  D - Not supremely drinkable, and still falls behind Westy 12 in my book... but for being available here and at a fairly reasonable price, it's hard to not want to drink it up.

Moments later, hops finally make an appearance. Alcohol very noticeable.  Mouth: Silky smooth and warming while effervescence nibbles at the sides of the tongue  Drinkability: The complexity of this beer sires a longing for the next sip. Once the 750 is drained however, I've had enough. The sweetness has become too much while the alcohol begins to assert its power. Should be enjoyed with food.

The reason that I gave a 4.5 for flavor is that the alcohol is quite detectable where I think it could be hidden a little more.  The palate has a nice dry, lasting bitterness. With an alcohol sting.  It's pretty drinkable. I could have one more.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

259,1708,vikingloki,4.35,"Poured into a goblet, I had bought a case last winter '07 and this is from that case, a year later.  Pours tawny brown with impressive carbonation leaving a two fingered bronze foamy head that lingers for a good minute and disappears to a 1/8 coating.  First sniff is almost winey, a little fruity and almost overpowering.  First sip tastes nothing like the smell, oh baby baby, it's so smooth and good I go back for a second sip immediatly. Very malty, no noticable hops, sweet and carmelly with depth, amazing mouthfeel, I want to drink it all now but will have some respect and linger. No alcohol up front, but has that nice warming quality that sneaks up on you.  This ale is even better this year, it's so much better than I remembered it. I thought I wouldn't like it this much because I've been enjoying hoppier beers, but WOW...this ale deserves every bit of praise that it gets.  Highly recommended, get a case and drink some and save some...worth every penny of the $$$$",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,TMB0424,4.01,"750 ML caged-cork bottle. 10% ABV. Poured into a tulip.  This brew pours a delicious looking deep amber brown, with a thick creamy head with excellent retention. Lacing as I drank, simply great looking.  Aroma of smooth malts, a hint of caramel, yeast, with delicate hints of peach and other fruits in the background. Nothing overpowering though.  Good stuff. Extremely smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Taste of peach, apple, hints of banana. Finish is very warming and has a slight spice to it, a perfect offset of the creaminess and fruitiness.  Alcohol content is extremely well hidden, although you know it's there. Quintessential sipping beer.  Definitely highly recommended. It's a beautiful looking brew and the creaminess is simply fantastic.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Also picked up some brown sugar and some wood notes as well. Finish was slightly bitter for a great complimentary balance. Mouthfeel was medium heavy, and quite silky.

Spicy caramel and charcoal taste. Absolutely wonderful and rewarding spicy caramel aftertaste that appears after the beer has gone and is just as strong as it was when the beer was still on the pallet. The alcohol is there for sure  M_Somewhat heavy bodied and lightly carbonated. I expected it to be even heavier and chewier  D_Pleasing but not overwhelming flavors and aromas make this beer unoffensive and easy to enjoy, but the 10,5ABV might be a bit prohibitive.

The re-pour produced a HUGE head, but it settled more quickly.  Aroma: Malty, bready and fruity with hints of clove.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with nice, light carbonation.  Taste: Sweet and malty with clove flavor predominating. I also taste plum fruitiness and a bit of tobacco. The alcohol is there and warms the belly. It is very dry with just a touch of bitterness in the finish.  Overall impression: This is a very nice sipping beer. I had trouble identifying the aroma and taste that seemed most prevalent, but after reading some reviews that mention cloves, I broke out a bottle of cloves from our spice cabinet and sure enough, that's what it is. I enjoyed it, but I enjoy other quads more.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

T: Sweet malt and candi sugar notes start out. Fig juice, green seedless grapes, and a fair amount of ethanol are in there too. Light coffee note at the end.  M: Sweet start with a dry finish. Very smooth, low carbonation actually in the finished product for the gusher it is.  D: Very drinkable for it's strength; this is a good beer. Is it top 25 for me?

Taste: Slightly malty with a very strong taste coming from the yeast and hops of slight bitterness but mostly fruity, close to a banana-like taste.  Mouthfeel: Feel is medium body with a bit of a higher degree of carbonation yet very smooth for the most part.

Eventually poured a murky brown with mahogany highlights and a substantial tan coloured head. Aromas of caramel, chocolate, coffee and dark fruits. There was also some hints of nuts and woodiness. The palate was excellently balanced and smooth, despite drinking at room temp. Chocolate and coffee notes were most prevalent. The mid palate brought some sweetness with honey, caramel and dark fruits. The finish displays some earthy hop spice and yeasty dryness.

Sweet, sour, toasted malts, bitter, fruity, alcoholic. Balanced. Flavor of raisins, plums and dates. Balanced but very warming alcohol. Strong taste of toasted malts.

259,1708,CHADMC3,4.12,"A frothy and intensely carbonated ivory head erupts from even a slow pour of this chestnut brown quad, giving way to a thick sticky lacing existing throughout the beer.  Aromas of dark fruit such as fig and cherries joins the yeast, sugar, and phenol alcohol follow up. The figs, cherries, and raisins become more pronounced as the temperature increases in the glass.  Again sweet dark fruits and spice dominate the flavor with a slight phenol aftertaste to accompany the roasted malt.  Great drinkability exists in the medium body with generous carbonation and dryness of the beer.

259,1708,sprucetip,4.33,"From 750ml bottle into Midnight Sun goblet.  Thick tan head with good retention and some lacing. Medium amber, but with ruby highlights when held to light. Also very clear but with some yeast chunks (no fault in my opinion) even from the first pour.  A rich, malty, sweet aroma with a touch of alcohol hits the nose first. A faint hint of something spicy appears, and a gentle but penetrating sweetness persists. Pleasant but not overwhelming.  Complex flavors are very nicely balanced. Sweetness on the tip of the tongue comes first, but it is gentle even as it lingers and blends with the yeasty and dark fruit flavors. A slightly bitter dryness at the finish points to some modest hopping and fermented candy sugar. Some mild spices are present too. The sweetness balances throughout.  Very well carbonated, modest warming. Feels slightly viscous at first, briefly, then finishes dry.  To me, this is a dangerously drinkable ale for such a big (10%) and precious ale. It is definitely full bodied, but goes down rather easily.  This sample reminded me of how I recalled it in my fonder memories, where it is one of the world's greats. Not all samples have left me feeling that way, and this satisfied. Not sure if it is me, or the beer, that causes this dissonance. It happens with other beers as well.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,DefenCorps,4.3,"11.2oz bottle decanted into my St. Bernardus chalice at near-cellar temp. I've had this beer a good number of times on tap but this is probably the first time out of the bottle, this beer's a year and a month old at this point.  A: Pours a crystal clear crimson with a solid 1"" light tan head. Head retention is outstanding and is dense and dimpled. Incredible amounts of carbonation is visible when held against the light. Excellent.  S: Incredibly rich with a ton of dark fruit - figs, plums, over-ripe apricots - as well as a rich rum-like aroma. Dark brown sugar, floral honey notes (minus the sweetness). As I let this sit a bit, I almost get a hint of a nut-like aroma. Pouring the yeast and dregs adds another layer of complexity to this beer.Wonderful stuff  T: On the palate, this beer has a lot of rich malt complexity with a lot of dark fruit character. It opens up with a dark, unrefined sugar flavor with figs and plums as well as a sweet rum taste. Pretty darned light in body, this beer dries up on the finish, leaving a fruity sweetness. This beer is rather boozy, though, with the alcohol apparent towards the finish  M: Like every other St. B beer I've had, this beer is simply spectacular on the palate - flavorful yet light, wonderfully carbonated and an excellent finish. The alcohol heat does take a bit away from this beer, though  D: You really can't go wrong with this beer, it's quite wonderful and easy to drink  **Edit 27 Jan 2013** This 11.2oz bottle has a best-by date of 18 Oct 2012. That puts this at just over 63 months of age.  The nose is fresh, bready and vibrant, lacking in the alcoholic brashness that fresh bottles have. Mildly spicy with clove and nutmeg, toffee, a little bit of brown sugar, cotton candy, a touch of yeast... so complex. The palate shows a little bit of oxidation (the good kind) with mildly jammy cherries, raisins and plums, along with toasted bread, bread yeast, a little bit of burnt sugar/toffee/ candi sugar. The mid-palate carries some of the spice character, with the nutmeg working quite nicely with the fruit. Drying on the finish with just a little sweetness, this beer is medium-light in body, has a marvelous creamy carbonation and is a joy on the palate. The blend of alcohol and toffee/ candi sugar on the finish brings to mind almonds. Masterfully integrated, this beer is ridiculously good. 5/4/4.5/4.75/4.5",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

The aroma is dark fruit with prunes, raisins, and brown sugar. The flavor follows suits with raisin and dates in the forefront with brown sugar, barley, and just a bit of cherry. Also there is just a hint of spiciness to it, probably from the Belgian yeast strains. The 10.5% alcohol really comes through, especially as it warms. The mouthfeel is full and leaves a nice boozy sensation on the palate. The colder this beer is, the less drinkable it is. As it warms, it really shows its true colors. It becomes a very drinkable quad, but it's still a bit on the boozy side for me.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Very little lacing left behind on a snifter.  Smell: Sweet, fruity aroma from the esters with a smoky quality from the malts. Floral and citrus notes.  Taste: A balanced combination of ever slight bitterness and sweetness from fermentation, sort of like molasses. The fruit comes in in the end, along with a warmth from the high alcohol content.  Mouthfeel: So light and smooth on the palate. The carbonation feels just perfect.  Drinkability: This beer is unbelievable. I can't get enough.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Smell: Sweet Belgian yeast aroma, hints of dark fruits, maybe a touch of citrus. Very complex, very inviting.  Taste: Sweet up-front, mostly from the yeast. Very yeasty overall, very malty. It's a very mellow beer considering the alcohol -- while it has a very complex and distinct flavor, it's difficult to talk about because the flavors are so elusive and unidentifiable. It's a wonderful flavor nonetheless.  Mouthfeel: Thick, chewy, lots of yeast in the glass. Leaves a nice coating to the palate.  Drinkability: You can't even taste the alcohol here.

A: pours a medium brown color with light highlights, some transparency but mostly hazy; very light tan head with rocky consistency, tight beads, and good lacing.  S: starts with noble hop--floral-spicy aroma; quickly followed by malt and molasses. A bit of candy.  T: wow. grapes, caramel, toffee, bread, figs, and all perfectly balanced with a spicy hop flavor, and finally finishes with dry alcohol. Does not leave a cloying sweet flavor in the aftertaste that some others in the style do. The complexity is interesting but the best part of the taste of this beer is the balance between the sweet flavors and the hops.  M: feels somewhat fluffy on the tongue; effervescent and well carbonated, which probably lightens the body. The alcohol finish at the end is somewhat puckering but helps to balance the sweet flavors, making them more enjoyable.  D: This has to rank w/ WV 12 for me. I am astounded by the balance of this beer, but moreover how the balance helps me to enjoy the distinctive flavors more, as none are overwhelming.

Delicious roasted and malty aftertaste, like sweet coffee. Kind of buttery as well, with a thick toffee-like malt character. Very rich. Smooth, creamy and yet slightly syrupy mouthfeel.

It starts with a shot of carbonation that shocks the mouth a bit, then a smooth fruity malt kicks in that leaves an almost perfect taste.

Caramel malt, apple, plum, and sugary molasses dance in the aroma. Sipping the brew brings a lace of candi (rock) sugar to the lips while pear, caramel, dark fruit, cinnamon, and a slight bitterness to the palate.

259,1708,number1bum,4.1,"Pours a mahogany color, quite cloudy and somewhat dense looking, with a fizzy finger and a half of beige head. Although the head is fizzy it's also pretty creamy and retention is exceptional, keeping a full lace and leaving a nice amount of webbing.  Smell is a nice bouquet of sweet malts, fruit and earthy yeast. There is some caramelized malt and candi sugar, lots of dark fruit like plums and figs and dates and raisins. Yeast is earthy and somewhat woodsy, with a bit of anise and clove in there, too.  Taste has all the aforementioned qualities that the smell had. Very earthy and woodsy, with some peat flavor to go with the sweet malts and candi sugar. Also some clove, and lots of dark fruit like the smell. The smell hid the alcohol well but it comes through a bit more in the taste. A bit astringent, too.  Mouthfeel doesn't seem as full as I expected. It's medium bodied, or maybe on the plus side of a medium body, but it's a bit too fizzy and not all that creamy.  This is a very good beer, but I'm a victim of expectations because I'm a touch disappointed.

It tasted like earthy caramel and milk chocolate malts, with sweet yeast, citrus hops and mulled spice. It was fairly thick with some carbonation (although surprisingly little considering how much head was on the pour), and a bittersweet aftertaste with alcohol warming. Overall this was absolutely fantastic. It had great, complex, subtle, and generally delicious flavor. It had an extremely smooth body and hid the alcohol fairly well, making this quite easy to drink and enjoy.

A off-white head quickly forms reaching almost 2 inches but dissipates reasonably quickly to a thin lace. The scent that initially caught me was bananas mixed with spices and turns to a mixture of sweetness. It is quite pleasant. You can definitely tell there is alcohol in the aroma. The first drink gives heavy alcohol notes which quickly turn sweet. It is hard to put my finger on the exact taste because it blends so smoothly. Medium/high carbonation makes the flavors blend quickly and go down nicely. The carbonation is something that caught me a little when it comes to feel. The flavors blend nicely but the carbonation is a little more than I'm used to. However, it is also what makes this flavor blend so well and makes the drinkability high. I will definitely drink this beer again.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,ECioffoletti,4.3,"Appearance was medium to dark brown and opaque. When I went to pour, I was overwhelmed by the carbonation. The head rose to the top of the glass like a bullet out of a gun and I was lucky it didn't spill over the top of my glass. Then, the foam sort of sat there, immovable and simmering away at a painfully slow speed. It was frustrating but a very good sign of freshness and quality at the same time. Healthy amount of lacing remained along the side of the beer glass long after drinking as well.  I could actually smell the alcohol in this one. It reminded my nose of something earthy and underground; dried fruits. As the beer mellowed and warmed to room temperature with time, it seemed to me to start smelling sweeter and reminded me increasingly of a dark chocolate perfumed with malts. Also, the light smell of alcohol subsided after a while which I really liked.  The alcohol hit me hard at first. It's well masked and never overwhelms but it was pretty clear to me without any prior knowledge that this brew was going to pack a punch. Tremendous amounts of yeast and brown sugar permeate the taste of this one. I pick up on raisins. It's light on hop bitterness but the taste of the alcohol and the complexity of the aftertaste were enough to satisfy my IBU craving. The aftertaste is something of wonder. Two minutes after a sip I still tasted this brew. The strong alcoholic front kind of disappeared in those long moments and I was left to marvel at other fragments of flavoring that hide under the surface: caramel, pine, molasses, brown sugar.  The alcohol hit me right away but the taste when combined with the heavy mouthfeel gave the entire experience a warming quality. This would be a great beer to have to warm up to on a cold day.  Certainly not a session brew. At $3.50 a bottle where it was purchased, this is something of a rare treat. If sipped slowly and treated with respect much like some fine sparkling wine (or perhaps a cobra), the drinkability is rather high I think. Once I became familiar with this style and knew what to expect, the alcoholic taste didn't bother me. It's something I needed to sort of grow into.  Final Thoughts: Certain beers I know aren't going to let me down even though I've never had them before. St. Bernardus has earned that reputation for me. I've tried several of their other offerings before and been blown away each time. There may be better Belgian Quads out there but I personally am yet to encounter one better than this. It's exciting that this is one of few Belgian brews that is available near me.  Although, as alcoholic and strong as it is, I'm not entirely certain if I could stomach it every day. Or every week for that matter. Sometimes, I'm simply in the mood for something more accessible and easier to relax to. The lingering aftertaste combined with the power and complexity of this brew make it something very special though. It lived up to its high rating and hype in my humble opinion.  Also, I drank mine in just under twenty minutes. Maybe I'm a lightweight but I felt tipsy and had a little bit of headache after. Note to self: remember to sip the deliciousness next time.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Lots of aromas here, very broad. Raisins, figs, apples, cherries, brown sugar, honey, toffee and caramel. They all kind of blend together for a sweet, yet mysterious smell.  Caramel with raisins and figs make up the majority of the body. The cherries and apples rush in early and the toffee and brown sugar take over late.  Medium bodied and perfectly stealth carbonation. Very smooth and easy going.  A definite sipper at 10% but it drinks like a 7%. One of the best examples of the style.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Very well balanced, with lots of depth. Fantastic.  Mouthfeel: medium to thick, with good carbonation.  D: Notwithstanding the ABV, this can easily be consumed in large quantities.

The bottle exploded when I uncapped it, and I lost about half of it. The head looked oddly uneven after I frantically poured the bubbling brew into my tulip and dissipated undoubtedly more quickly than it normally would have, or so I assume.  It's spicy and bready and incredible. There's a lot of aroma, sweet caramel and spiced nuts. The flavors adds in raisins and smoke. There's a lot of carbonation sizzling the flavors throughout the mouth.

Very strong fruit aromas with a little bit of earthy yeast. Some phenols come through.  Creamy fruit flavors mix with some spicy phenols. Very smooth throughout. Full bodied with spritzy carbonation.

T: Malts, roasted nuts, and rum soaked raisins. Ultra complex- spicy and chocolate sweet with a pinpoint balance. Bit of any oxymoron but it tastes strong without having the feel of the alcohol.  M: Thick and malty. Light carbonation adds to the alcohol burn some but it is warming in a very good way right down the throat. This is the perfect feel for a quad.  D: This is a legit quad.

Appearance: Chunky, opaque, earthy-tree bark color with TONS of carbonation. Bubbles stick to the glass as streams of carbonation rush toward the surface. Massive, loose, soapy khaki-colored head with great retention. No apparent lacing. Jorge gives it a 4; Nick gives it a 4.5.  Smell: Milk chocolate (maybe more of cocoa powder), banana, raisins, sour Belgian yeast, smoke, some spicy notes. Nothing overwhelming. Alcohol is well-masked. We both agreed on the score here.  Taste: Cocoa and figs jump out at us first. Doughy malts, dark currants, cola, spices (cinnamon, black pepper), banana, and alcohol. Aftertaste is surprisingly dry. Jorge gives it a 4; Nick gives it a 4.5.  Mouthfeel: A good amount of sting in this one. Not really fellin it. Carbonation, alcohol and spiciness attack the mouth and throat. Other than that, a very solid body with great warming effect though not much mouth-coating.  Drinkability: This beer is 10.5% and certainly feels like it.

I typically split a bottle of this size and strength, but there's no reason someone couldn't finish this one alone. It's good enough where you'd certainly want to.

This is the kind of beer that will definately expand your palate and your insatiable craving for better and better beers.  I poured this beer into a St Bernardus Watou trappist ale glass - wow was I lucky to get ahold of this glass in Cincinnatti - thank you Giri from Dorothy Lane in Springboro. The head rose quickly and stayed around a half inch throughout the session. I poured this one at around 48 degrees and decided to let it warm to keep the carbonation in a little - based on much appreciated reviews.  The aroma is of big vinous fruit and medicine - but in a good way. It has an almost indescribable frothy, malty, sour aroma that seems to change as you inhale.  The taste confirms the complexity. I am completely overwhelmed by the fruit flavor, the malty juiciness, and the alcohol is only observable by the fact that I am getting more and more giddy as I drink it. It has a very zen like quality that seems to very much calm me as I enjoy it.  The mouthfeel is huge. I cannot believe a beer with such vivacious carbonation could be so creamy and malty. It's like a lamic in carbonation and a scotch ale in maltiness with a Belgian big beer character that seems to say, ""you are one lucky individual.""  This beer looses a bit in drinkability - not because you don't want to drink six of these, but because 1) It has 10% ABV and 2)It's around 9 bucks per 11.2 ounce bottle (but oh so worth it).

The taste also included some rum-like alcohol, dark fruit, and yeast, but the burnt malts were overwhelming. Mouthfell was medium/full bodied. Nice balance of carbonation and thickness.

By using a flashlight, I could glimpse some reddish hues and some floaties, which I assume were from the yeast. The head is MOST prodigious in size .. 3 fingers on a chilled sample. It is long lasting but in the end reduces to a fine cap. Some lacing is noticeable on the sides.  The nose is a quite pleasant mixture of dark fruits (raisins, plums and perhaps dates. Also in there is the unmistakeable hint of spicy cinnamon .. like the kind you'd find in 'red hots'. Very enjoyable just to sit and inhale.  The taste pretty much follows the nose. Big dark fruit tastes, with that spicy cinnamon (red hot) taste in the background, providing a little warmth. The 10% abv is completely hidden, except for the warming of the stomach. Mouthfeel is medium-full, and smooth. I wouldn't say 'creamy', but smooth definitely covers it. Drinkability? Well, I think this should be quaffed slowly whilst enjoying some classical music and/or reading a good book. A fine after dinner drink, or even an aperitif.

Splotches of lacing that clung to the side all the way down.  S: Rich, dark fruits overlaid with spices.  T: Caramels, nuts, toffees, rich dark malts. Alcohol bite. Very complex. Pleasantly warming.  M: Full body, dry alcohol finish. Alcohol and carbonation gave it a lighter feel than it really was.  D- Easy to drink, goes down smooth.

259,1708,CrellMoset,4.23,"Bottle from Market Street Wine, Downtown location, in Charlottesville, VA. Poured into a St. Bernardus chalice, appropriately enough.  Appearance: A ruby-brown beer with a bubble, effervescent tan head w/ average retention (in a head-killing glass). Runny lacing. Looks like what liquid bread - or a quadrupel, for that matter - should look like, all around. Good carbonation, good color, good everything.  Aroma: Faint - or maybe that's the glass - but there're plenty of good, light fruity notes, blueberries notably, brown sugar, a lot of sweet, simple candy sugar smells, and it's all wrapped up in a very wholesome, slightly nutty bready malt aroma.  Taste: Brown sugar, cherries, other berries, dark fruits - figs, raisins (which, in conjunction with the alcohol, lend that great quadrupel rum raisin note) - lots of Belgian spices (cloves) and the banana note (good ol' yeast one-two punch), sweet simple candy sugar, bready biscuity notes. Comes through like Fanta grape in places, which I'm assuming is the way the carbonation, fruity esters, and candy sugar meld - interesting. There's some earthy yeastiness, some grassy, herbal, balancing bitterness, and only the faintest feel of well-hidden alcohol in the finish.  Mouthfeel: Spritzy and bubbly, big-bubbled, with a good pillowy sublimation-esque mouthfeel. A little uneven at first, but this improves as things warm (strangely enough).  Drinkability: Very well-hidden alcohol, but it's up there, and you can feel it after a while. Plus, the grape fanta soda thing starts to freak you out after a while. All that being said, the sheer scatterbrain-like quality of my above review should indicate that this is a really complex and tasty beer, and comes highly recommended.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,GOGRANDE,4.28,this is both a complexe and strong beer. At 10% it literally can make you sweat a little....But the monks know their stuff the balance is very good. Great flavors...the famous beligian yeast and faint fruits. then followed by a slight bite/burn senstion at the end reminding you that this is a mans beer. no bitches allowed! It is quite dry and winelike but smooth at the same time. It also has a fair amount of carbination. Once again...hats off to the monks.  P.S. much stronger tasting out of the bottle then on tap. (if my memory serves me right),Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,changeup45,4.36,"Pours a brownish body, slightly hazy and full of carbonation. A huge foamy head that leaves a lot of lacing. At first the beer tastes a bit winey and tart, with an alcohol rush and some malts and dark fruits mixed in. But it really does balance out quite well to make a very good beer. For a beer with this much alcohol in it (10%) I found it to be quite smooth and easy to drink. Also, slightly sweet but doesn't over do it and the finish is clean and relaxing.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

A: Pours a deep, rich brown/mahogany color that produces a nice, off-white head that retains well and leaves a nice consistent lacing along the glass.  S: The nose is very unique to any other beer that I have encountered. It is very bready and yeasty with notes of fruits (both dark and light), caramel, and perhaps some vanilla, but very faint  T: Dark fruits, caramel, sweet malts, and a more dominant note of vanilla than the nose had indicated. Alcohol is present, but hidden pretty well.  MF: Medium, almost full in body. Very smooth and creamy, aftertaste is dry  D: Good for a beer of this ABV and style...Looking forward to the other St. Bernardus' I have left",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

The aroma was of sweet malt and berries. The taste was surprisingly moderate, but wonderfully put together. It was simply berries, malt, and a pleasant alcohol burn. The feel was light and dry. This was a great beer to experience and I look forward to finding it on tap again in the future.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,ChainGangGuy,4.3,"Best Before: 12 07 12.  Appearance: Pours a near opaque, dark brown body with a full, cascading, and lasting, ivory-colored head. Sea foam lacing on the way down.  Smell: Aromatic blend of stewed, spiced fruit, liqueur, and chopped up chocolate cookies and candy bars.  Taste: First and foremost, it's fruity, tasting of golden raisins, plum juice, and candied figs. Then you get some maltiness, mainly dark chocolate and nutty caramel. Hit of dark candi sugar. Not really much in the way of hops here. Touch of clove and nutmeg. Sip of creme de cocoa. Maybe a bit of fresh, oily orange zest. Finishes malty, sweet, and rather warming.  Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Moderately carbonated.  Drinkability: Paired very well with some Pinback mp3's (particularly ""Tripoli"" and ""Seville""). Full of flavor, rich complexities, and yet it's easily accessible and generally readily available from coast to coast. What's not the like?

259,1708,PatronWizard,3.75,"After some rather lackluster tastings, I decide to dip into one of my BA Top 100. This will be my first quad ever so cut me some slack willya?  Pours out like liquid caramel. The wife made such hilarious comments during this trial that I just have to include them (in quotes). ""Looks like crap brown"", ""as ugly as the bottle"", ""look how ugly and boring the bottle is"" Anyway, it frothed up a great head, light mocha/off white. Continuous bubbling on a tiny scale. Nice looking beer.  I can smell the alcohol. Maybe some grapes. Missus says ""oh boy"", ""smells good"", and ""I'm digging the smell"". Alcohol is a little much in the nose. So I'm sniffing away as the wife looks up some of the other reviews. As I take a whiff, she reads ""dates and molasses malts"" and damned if I don't get a big whiff of dates and molasses malts. Cool experience. The next sniff is something different.  Not sure I'm in love with the flavor. Wife says ""yuck"". Maybe just not my style of beer.  I think I just truly discovered the meaning of smooth and dry. Took a sip and this puppy ran all the way to my belly! Very nice feel.  Because it's so silky smooth, it drinks like there's no tomorrow, but the alcohol becomes more apparent as the bottle dwindles.  Overall: Very glad I tried it, but as an IPA lover, I probably won't stock up on this.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Gehrig,4.83,"Abt 12 pours a rich mahogany with light trim topped by three fat fingers of slightly tan soda foam; excellent duration and dense lacing seal the deal on the appearance. Sweet, spicy nose with vanilla, cherry, raisin, and pepper; very smooth.  The taste is so delicious that words can scarcely do it justice. Plenty of raisin, date, and plum with vanilla and cherry in a rich, complex fruit flavor, but with enough spice (clove and pepper) to maintain a strong balance. Bready malt is prevalent. There is a good, slightly bitter aftertaste to finish off a terrific second half, which is a bit spicier from the clove than the first, sweeter half.  The very high ABV (10.5%) doesn't interfere with a truly magnificent Quad, perhaps the best I've ever had and certainly one of the best beers in any style I've tried. Well worth the coin, and one worth cellaring. A masterpiece.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,koolk,4.62,"Pours a deep dark mahogany with a small beige head that lingers the whole way down.  Very yeasty/bready nose that also swings into some sweet fruit notes of plums and apples. Maybe even some dry fruit in there as well. And some spicy wood notes start to appear with warmth/air. So too figs, prunes, more plum and red currants. Wow. Grows and grows with time.  Spicy palate of cacao, vanilla, oak and clove. Dark fruits come into play as does the strong malt flavours. Happy sugar level, and some real aniseed warmth on the finish.  Body is smooth, creamy and very well balanced.  Must admit, on the first sniff and taste it seemed very very 1 dimensional - hard yeast on the nose, alcohol on the finish. As it warmed/aired it grew and grew, filling out the palate with creamy sweetness and a very complex nose to boot.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,AlexF,5,"Dark hazy brown. Chocolate, brownies brown. Deep! With a LOT of yeast floating. A nice beige head is also persisting throughout the session, with wonderful lacing. Perfect appearance for a rich quadrupel.  A sugary odour of brownies, dark fruits and hints of caramel suggest that this beer will be heavy, real heavy.  No disapointment. This beer rocks! Layers of dark ripe fruits, generic sugary dessert (cookie or brownies again), with a touch of... magic? This is real good.  This is the best quadrupel i've tasted, by far.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,MattChaos,4.5,"Appearance: The Abt. 12 is traditionally poured in a goblet or snifter-style glass. This allows its thick and rich head to make itself known, and not without good cause. The dark-to-light coloring of the pour is absolutely brilliant for a Belgian, and impressive to anyone familiar with the style.  Smell: Tough to get past the froth, but pleasant and suggestive. The smell is specific, and omits several key ingredients to the beer, leaving the aroma to be slightly misleading, but encouraging nevertheless.  Taste: A credit to its style. This 10% beer drinks almost like a 7%. Smooth, but pungent. A ""sipper"". Roasty and malty. Perfect trappist.  Mouthfeel: Sweet front-end, boasty back-end.  Drinkability: Be careful with this one! It's soothing taste and attractive appearance has been known to tempt one too many beer-geek into a quick intoxication. This is a quality beer, and should be enjoyed as such. It's a social beer, but one could easily spend an evening drinking nothing but the Abt. 12, and enjoying every last drop!",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

S- Brown sugar, fig, and green apple dipped in warm caramel  T- A very chewy mouth feel that erupts in a full bouquet of living breathing wreathes of dark malt, toffee and hints of caramel.

Only missing that certain ""wow!"" response for a perfect 5.  MF: Thick and full bodied, with ample carbonation. Perfect!  D: A perfect beer for slowly sipping, but keeps me coming back for more.

Pours a deep ruby into my Pabst goblet with a bubble khaki head, evincing plenty of carbonation - as it should be. Smells lovely and quite strong - cherries, raisins, prune, bourbon soaked oak and candi sugar. The last note comes first to the taste buds, followed by an explosion of dark fruits, with cherries at the epicenter of the blast. Candi again, then some pepper and alcoholic burn in perfect harmony. Taking more sips, a few other favors show up - cocoa becomes more apparent, something close to tobbacco crops up briefly, a very slight touch of caramel. A little hotter than I recall, a tad spicier.  Mouthfeel is near perfect, thick and coating but with the carbonated ""lift"" i like, vaporizing the liquid rolling down the tongue. There's something to the Belgian water. I can't think of a single American quad that nails the mouthfeel. Obviously not going to session this, but there's nothing off to the brew, very drinkable for the style.

259,1708,jordoo,4.92,"750ml bottle poored into a Chimay glass.  This one is an original color for sure, the best way I can describe it is as a dark ruby red thats really brown. It is super carbinated with a large creamy tan head that holds well and left decent lacing. While it certainly has the look of something special the nose is even better. I get a wide range of carmel/sweet malts as well as earthy yeast, plumb, slight raisin, slight alcohol and grassy/floral hops, wonderfully complex. The taste is again just out of this world just so much going on and yet at the same time its majically refreshing. Plum, raisins, sweet carmel malts, spice, candied fruit sugars, nuts and alcohol all make a home on your palet. I can't remember a beer with more carbination than this one and yet it seems to fit it well, providing a nice airyness to the overall medium feel without making it seem thin. My one serious gripe is that I only picked up one bottle of this, because I simply need to have more I wonder if the abbey is accepting new recruits. LOL.

It poured thin, but with lots of head retention. Pour slowly unless you want a glass full of foam. Semi-dark, with a sweet, apple cider aroma. The flavor begins with the dryness of an aged cabernet, then explodes with notes of alcohol, overripe figs and balanced with a mandarian orange acidity and sweetness. This is one of the best beers of the year for me. Strong but refreshing. A definite sipper.

259,1708,garymuchow,4.23,"Took me long enough to make it to this top 25 beer (currently at #20). Pours with enormous tan head made up of many size bubbles with largest ones forming in time. Really attractive red color when held in proper light. Very clear (at least from the top of the bottle). Funky aroma made up of assorted phenols with malt, sweet fruit, and mild alcohol (something about a diaper comes to my mind as I experience this). Remarkably clean drink, especially considering all that's going on here. Malts dominate, spiciness from the yeast, strong alcohol warmth and only somewhat less flavor. More dryness than I expected but it leaves fairly quickly and quietly, leaving a very mild bitterness and a touch of astringency. It's seems like two different drinks. It begins soft and relatively smooth with subtle flavors from the malt, then suddenly sharp and forthright flavors make their presence dominated by the yeast and alcohol Surprisingly the fruit appears in the latter half. Boy there is a lot going on. Much beyond my verbal/written ability to express. Fully carbonated and includes an addition to the sharpness as it pricks the tongue. They soften in time releasing a smoother ale than initially revealed. Rich, rich, rich. Makes me want to find something to eat cut the intensity. (hmmm, what to have - I think I don't have nuts, maybe some cheese). Largely due to the style this wont' make my list of best beers. Too rich and biting. Nonetheless a fine, fine beer, but I could have done just as well with a smaller bottle. Ah, that's better. A little cheese help cut the intensity and it becomes a much more enjoyable beer.

Finishes semi-sweet with a touch of hop bitterness and some warming alcohol.  Medium-bodied mouthfeel. Well-carbonated, but smooth.  Very easy to drink.

A little smoother and subtler than the nose would suggest, with a strong alcohol presence in there as well.

Again, tons of cookies, roasted chocolate malt, and a ton of raisins, prunes, etc. floating around. Body is huge and creamy, perfect for the flavor and aromas.

259,1708,chefnash51,4.61,"My first experience of this beer was actually on tap. Blew me away. Made me a life time fan.  A - I love this bottle, it just says.. hey I am a delicious Belgian Quad. You won't be disappointed with me. The beer itself is a dark drown color, sporting a gorgeous thick, lustrous head. I usually pour this into my St. bernardus chalice and admire it for a minute as I let it warm a bit. Beautiful.  S - I can smell the Belgian yeast, figs, plums, caramel..sweet heavenly nectar goodness.  T - So complex. So rich, So good. the alcohol is present, but it adds a nice warming effect. Rich ripe fruits swim threw my mouth.  M - Alive! the bubbles dance on my tongue. This beer has always had a bread like feel to it, full body indeed. I could have this for a meal.  D - To me, the drink ability is high. This beer has always been the beer that whenever I don't know if I feel like a beer.. or I don't know what kind of beer I feel like.. and I have this beer.. I am never let down. the higher alcohol content is the only thing slowing me down.  I have had this beer fresh and with some age on it. The older the better. If you like this one.. Pick up a bunch.. and lay them down. I say at one year, they really start to shine. But now that I have over a case in the cellar.. I should be able to make it past 2 years.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,tronester,4.43,"Pours a dark, cloudy brown, with a big, rocky, off-white head. Smells strongly of alcohol and super ripe bananas. Taste is strongly malt based, oak like flavors, as well as a hint of cider. Just a hint of bitterness and flavor from the hops. Highly carbonated. The yeast flavors imparted by this beer are more neutral than I would have expected for a Belgian Ale, but this does not affect authenticity. Mouthfeel is rich, carbonation levels are high due to bottle conditioning. Drinkability is great, very smooth beer, that while smells greatly of alcohol, hides its 10.5% ABV quite well. Quite an expensive beer, but is a great treat every now and then.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Smells and tastes of figs, dried fruit, cinnamon, pear, grape, and some other fruits I can't place, but there's lots of them in there. A great blend of aroma and flavor. Nothing overpowers, and the flavors are intriguing enough that I keep drinking more. A helluva beer.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

There's also just a nice presence of dark roasted grain and that familiar belgian yeast.  The taste shows an array of dark ripe fruits, banana, yeast, and a lingering alcohol warmth. It's lightly medicinal as well.  Mouthfeel is full bodied and perfectly carbonated.  Drinkability is moderate. Great flavors make for easy consumption, alcohol may limit this beer slightly.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

T & M: Beautiful, yeasty, fruity creaminess flocks to my palette like the salmon of Capistrano. The medium carbonation carries the spice and complex fruit, and the alcohol warms all the way down.  D: It's a sipping brew, no doubt. Its ridiculous balancing act of flavor and texture make it unmistakably one of the best beers I've ever had.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Soft spicy aroma of cinnamon and fruit.  The palate: the thick bodied beer was served a bit too cold, I think. Dark, sweet malt (almost molasses but not quite that sweet and thick) and an odd metallic tang that disappears as the beer warms. Subtleties emerge as the temperature goes up: spicy yeast, pitted fruit.  A small glass is appropriate for this big beer, which is sippable but fairly heavy.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Appearance is a dark brown, almost black at the top with a Tootsie Roll colored brown touching down at the bottom of the glass with a nice frothy head. Bubbles crumbled quickly leaving a nice lacing around the edges of the glass. Definitely a very thick brew going on here.  Smell was very pleasing. The fine aroma of apples and sweet citrus fruits layered around the rims of the glass along with a nice ale smell. This is a beer to behold.  Taste was beyond awesome. From the moment it hits your lips, the alcohol makes itself aware and leaves a nice, stinging feeling. The flavor itself is a mixture is nice malts and citrus and it goes down very smoothly. Very exceptional.  Mouthfeel was very satisfying. This stuff really is thick, frothy and retains the flavor shortly before swallow. Definitely a great brew.  Drinkability was very top notch. For a bomber, this still will do you in quickly and in a pleasant, happy way.

Head looks kind of clumpy.  S: Strong malty flavor with a big fruity smell: apples, apricots, dark fruits, maybe a hint of banana. Some woody undertones, as well. Alcohol can also be detected.  T: Wow, this is very intense, yet smooth. The more the beer warms, the more the individual flavors develop into a cohesive whole. Very dark fruity taste, with lots of malt character and lots of complexity. Some smoky, woody overtones help tie it all together. The alcohol percentage is amazingly masked by this flavor.  M: Very smooth and creamy, but the alcohol leaves a slight tingle in the throat as it goes down. Easy to drink.  D: The flavor is really intense, but this beer is incredibly easy to drink nonetheless. I really wish I had another, but alas, my backpack was only so big when I was in Belgium.

M: Highly carbonaed and medium thickness.  D: Quite easy to drink beyond the ABV and gets even better with time.

Has a pungent smell of licorice, dark fruits such as raisins, and alcohol... the licorice and alcohol combine to have an almost menthol like effect on the nasal passages. Tastes suprisingly subtle yet just as complex when compared to the intense smell. Spice and hops back the malt, dark fruits, and licorice for a balanced flavor and mouthfeel; yet finishes with a silky vanilla taste and feel. Alcohol is not overly present by any means. This is very drinkable and restored my faith in belgian and belgian-style beers, as I was sort of being let down recently. Great beer.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Hornet2003,4.32,"Appearance: Pours a dark ruby, red-brown. Little fizzy resonance.  Smell: Musty, yeasty quad smell. Dark fruit and candy sugar. Figgy and date-y. A little sourness as well.  Taste: Sweet fruit flavour. This is a 1-year old bottle so it is excessively smooth. A little buttery, almost like an English Christmas cake.  Mouthfeel: Wow is this stuff smooth. Very silky and perfect carbonation.  Drinkability: Too much alcohol for drinkability to be too high. The smoothness makes it relatively easy to drink but not too much can be had in a sitting before you're keeled over.  Overall: I poured out the bottle I had when it was fresh. I just found it too sharp and annoyingly alcoholic. But I find this to be a great improvement. A year of aging really helps this so I'm thinking it only gets better with age.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

The Abt 12 follows the same basic recipe as the Westy 12 (with different water and yeast of course), and results in a similar complex mixture of raisins, other fruits, nuts and spices. Almost as good as Westvleteren at a fraction of the price and inconvenience, its biggest problem is that its just good enough to make you really long and wish for the good stuff.

The aroma is of dark fruit, chiefly raisins and plums. Definitely get those easily identifiable spicy/fruity Belgian esters. There is also a bit of earthiness. The taste is very sweet and earthy as well with lots of raisiny goodness coming through. The alcohol is also quite noticeable, as my whole head seems to be warmed with each sip.

Massive amounts of flavor are present in this brew. It's hard for me to discern them all. Clove is present, but is tamed by creamy fruit flavors, almost like an ice cream float.

S: deep malts, slight sweetness, nutty and almost caramely with a faint phenol and alcoholic aroma  T: Medium carbonation, very sweet with a caramel finish. Alcohol content barely noticeable! Deep fruity flavor (fig, what else? maybe plum) but mostly dominated by the heavy malt and spicing.  M: This is a smooth and crisp drink, and only gets smoother. The sweetness lingers and the fruit flavors really linger on your palette after the mouthful. Perhaps a bit too carbonated masking some of the flavor.  Well rounded Quadrupel.

T: The taste is outstanding. It went very well with the BBQ ribs that I cooked for 4 hours over charcoal that I had with them. The taste was sweet, because of the fruit, and it blended well with the alcohol.  M/D: Highly drinkable with a good level of carbonation, not overpowering but enough so that you notice it.

I have never thought this was one of the more complex Quads out there, but classic and really good all the way, and that fruity character is amazing. M/D: I use to think this was over carbonated, but that crisp refinement is hard to come by in lots of beers in this style or otherwise. After this breaths and warms, it becomes really smooth though. The ABV is nowhere to be seen, outside of a nice warming feeling. A great one to sip on.  I didn't always hold this one in the best light for some reason, but its easily a classic.

The fruit flavoring is what I noticed most - grape, cherry, sour apple, pear - and then a bready malt sweetness mixed w/ caramel and chocolate.

The rockiness of the head makes this my all time benchmark for appearance, but the last two bottles (from a 33cl and now this 750ml) I've had in a goblet haven't quite measured up. While this bottle is more of a 4, I've had plenty of these that were a perfect 5, so for the formal review, I've got to go 4.5.  Smells fantastic, man do I love the aroma on this one! Sweet and fruity, grapes but not the cured, musty prune like aroma of many quads, nor is it too thick. Just awesome.  Taste is very nice, but not as fruity as the nose, countered by the spiciness of the yeast, a nice, light ruminess from the sugar, and firm, but clean alcohol character with moderate fusels. Yummy, and fairly smooth. I need to have the patience to age this beer for a while, with a couple hundred beers in the cellar, I still can't hold onto these more the a few days!  Mouthfeel is highly carbonated (this ones bottled to last up to 15 years per the label), light in the belly.  Drinkability is very good, damn tasty, highly digestible, and smooth enough that you can easily overindulge. I love it so much, I find myself drinking it to fast that my buzz gets ahead of me, and as much as it pains my palate, having to let it sit before I come back.

259,1708,Phenom,4.58,"Let me just start out by saying this is a great beer that is absolutely deserving of the high rankings on BA and elsewhere.  A: Pours a dark, nearly opaque reddish brown with a creamy off-white head. The head sticks around for a long time and leaves great lacing on the glass. The beer has a lot of carbonation, so be careful on the pour to avoid a glassful of foam. Carbonation bubbles and suspended yeast particles are visible in the beer.  S: To me aroma is the least impressive aspect of this beer. Smells like a solid Belgian brown, but nothing remarkable.  T: This is simply a delicious beer. Has a great blend of fruity flavors, caramel, malt, dark dried fruits, molasses, and a little spicy bite on the aftertaste that is very excellent. The alcohol is so well hidden or balanced that there is no heat whatsoever.  M: Full bodied, excellent carbonation, not too syrupy or cloying.  D: The most drinkable 10% beer I can imagine. Dangerous  Believe the reviews, give it a try if you have the chance. A quintessential Belgian.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

The steady streamer feed a cap of soft, grainy, light-tan head that retains nicely and leaves sticky, frothy lacing on the glass.  The aroma of Abt 12 is sweetly floral and fruity with a scent of apple blossoms, bread made from overripe bananas, raisins, prunes, brown sugar, a sniff of allspice, and just a hint of alcohol.  The taste is fruity and complex with tart, juicy notes of both green and ripe cherries, ripe plums, crisp pears, soft banana, dark brown sugar with pumpernickel bread and spicy ginger. The malty, fruity sweetness is cleaned up with a nice dry finish. Slight alcohol warming warns the drinker as to the wallop this wolf in monk's robes is packing. A bit of bubblegum emerges as the drink warms.  Fullish-medium in body with exquisitely fine carbonation. Exceptionally smooth and very drinkable given the potent 10% abv.

The nose displays an earthy character with some dark fruit, carmel, and esters. Flavor continues may of these, with carmel sweetness and some light fruit flavors (dark cherry and raisins). High effervescence creates an explosion of carbonation as it hits the tongue. I find this detracts a bit from flavor complexity. There is also a touch of alcohol in the finish.  Overall, a nice strong-dubbel Belgian ale. Tasty and enjoyable, though I did not enjoy it as much as I expected I might with the very high ranking this beer enjoys on BA.

In the mouth it was medium to full-bodied with a denisity and weight that was full bet extremely well-balanced by the effervecance. In fact the effervecance keeps this very light on its feet for such a high alcohol and powerful beer.

Only a bit of booze.  T: Pretty similar to the nose. Overripe apples, raisins, dates and bubble gum at first, A hint of alcohol can be felt at the end. It's a perfect concoction of boozy sweetness.  M: Heavy in body, with a slightly dry finish.  D: Very good for the ABV, truly a world class beer that is even better on draft than from the bottle.  Overall: This is a wonderful brew that is more than worthy of it's top 25 ranking. It is one I have had numerous times from the bottle but never on draft. I think it is even better poured from a tap if you can imagine that. One glass was not enough.

The first pour was rough, though only slightly, and produces 3 massive fingers of lightly tinted frothy head that held nicely. Some patchy lacing.  S: A nice alcohol line just like Westvleteren 12. Not quite as profound but very enjoyable. Deeply sweet caramel and dense bread notes.  T/M: Pleasant alcohol but it's not as rich as I'd have liked. Very tasty nonetheless as it swims through all the flavors. Strong enough to leave a prickle on your tongue and a warmth in the belly. More of the rich caramel flavors as well as some of those tasty alcoholic dark fruits. There's a nice bitterness on the tip of the tongue for a bit in the beginning but falls out during the creamy malt wave, only to return to a drying alcoholic finish with some lasting bitterness. Body is full but not heavy and carbonation keeps things lively.  D: Tasty but this should be a rare treat that needs to be sipped and enjoyed.

259,1708,prototypic,4.35,"Appearance: Nice roasty, brown color. It's opaque and has quite a bit of sediment swimming around. Head is about two fingers deep. Retention is top notch. It might even outlast the beer. Lacing is very solid.  Smell: Pepper and clove spices hit the nose first. Caramel and sugar malts smell sweet. Dark fruit aromas (plum and raisin mostly) blend well with the spice and malt scents. Light alcohol scent toward the end. This is a pretty complex and nice smelling brew. Quite enticing.  Taste: I've got to admit, I was not quite expecting this to be this tasty. The flavor is extremely full and robust. Dark fruit and spice flavors are an excellent combo and provide a complex kickoff. Caramel and sugar malts provide a very sweet follow up. Hops are more notable than in smell and provide just enough bitterness to balance it out really well. It's a bit bready on the tail and that remains on the palate. Alcohol warms you up just a tad at the very end.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This is medium bodied. Carbonation is high, but far from offensive. It's very smooth and goes down a little too easy. That's especially true considering its 10.5% stature. But, I find myself wanting more. It's extremely drinkable. Perhaps it's a good thing I only have one.  Abt 12 is excellent beer. As far as Quads go, it's right up there at the top. Frankly, it's every bit as good as Westvleteren 12. And that's saying a lot. Westvleteren 12 may have a very slight edge. But, it is an extremely close call.

I sense cinnamon, dark fruits, cherries, caramel, and citrus. It's a balanced and complex beer. There's some alcohol warmth on the finish, but it's very silky and smooth and creamy.

Medium-full in body, smooth with nice effervescent carbonation. Alcohol presence is noticeable, but it is 10% alcohol and it has a very warming feel to it and accompanies the other flavors nicely, completing the balance.

The wait was well worth it. For an alcohol content of 10.2% you barely taste it. The best part of the beer is the after taste. It finishes very smooth and delicious.

Even the smell is dry, which makes me wonder about the feel. A bit of earthiness and spiciness to the smell.  T: Mild funky start quickly develops into a huge bready/sweet malt along with some white wine type grape flavor. Finish is sweet sticky alcohol.  MF: Quite thick and bubbly, dances in the mouth. I guess I didn't expect this level of carbonation from such a high ABV beer. Really really dry finish. Overall this is just an assault on the mouth from a feel standpoint, but in a good way.

259,1708,goschool,4.52,"Appearance: The pour is amber-brown with a quickly fading tan head.  Smell: The nose has a lovely mixture of toasted malts, toffee, esters, cherry, plum, and Belgian yeast.  Taste: The flavor profile screams Winter to me. It's full of rich sweet toasted malty deliciousness. Brown sugar, caramel, and toffee are complimented by plumb, black cherry, esters, phenols, and Belgian yeast with soft hop bitterness and a kiss of warming alcohol at the finish.  Mouthfeel: It's medium-bodied and lush with plenty of carbonation.  Drinkability: There's something about this beer that makes my imagine sitting by the fire on a snowy night. I suppose it's vaguely similar in look and flavor to a spiced winter cocktail. Either way, the alcohol, while fairly high, adds a faint sweet warming note, yet it doesn't overwhelm my palate.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,t0rin0,4.42,"This beer is a very close 2nd to the Val-Dieu Grand Cru as far as quadrupels that I've tried go. Its a treat every time I've had it.  The beer pours a dark brown, darker than most of the quadrupels that I've had. Hazy and there are noticeable chunks of yeast floating around in there. Thats the only negative on the appearace. The head is rather tall and fluffy and tan. Lots of carbonation.  The smell is of yeast and malt. Not real complex, actually very simple. That yeast and the dark malts are both very strong. This is a very aromatic beer. A bit sweeter and richer than the 60th anniversary version. There is a little alcohol smell at warmer temps but its not distracting in the least. Can't detect a lot of spices unless I'm confusing them with the yeast in the beer.  The taste is sweet with some bitterness. The yeast chunks floating around probably contribute to this. Some dark fruit flavors come out with a small hint of roasted malt (very small hint). Sugary for sure but can't tell if thats candi sugar or just a lot of malt.  Its too bad that these bottles are so small because this is something I'd like to drink by the pint.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,blakesell,4.18,"Poured from 11.2oz bottle into a Belgian chalice style glass. Best before 5-24-12, relatively fresh.  Appearance- Beer pours cloudy and dark brown with a huge pillow of foam that comes to a foamy rocky head of tan and cream bubbles that rise to the alarming edges of the glass, but not to worry, this is the correct glassware. Head subsides and lingers, clinging softly to the glass. Not much visibility, but one can see various floaties running around in the glass.  Smell- Yeasty and creamy with the very unmistakable St. Bernardus yeast. Thick fumes of cream, almond, raisins, plums, and of course belgian yeast. Not a lot in the smell in the way of spices. No real hop nose. Malty and thick with just enough wheat.  Taste- Wow, just like I remembered every time. Heaven in a bottle. Thick with the yeast once more that I love so much. Figs, hazelnuts, raisin, plum, a decent level of wheat malt and rich Belgian pale malts. A bit warming with alcohol which strikes me as a bit off.. I guess time on every other bottle I have had has done the beer a bit more good. Still amazing all around. A bit spicey but only due to the yeast. No outside spices on the tongue. Light caramel flavours.  Mouthfeel- A bit heavy on the alcohol, creamy, high carbonation, thick and rich. Somewhat warming.  Drinkability- Great for an occasional faux trappist treat. Good for a session? Not quite, but I would enjoy a day of Bernardus just for grins.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Biscuit033,4.48,"A: Dark garnet with a white head adn great lacing and some good head retension.  S: Earthy notes asd pepper. Perhaps served a bit to cold to pull anything else out. Didn't get much more out of the nose as I let it warm.  T: Bursting with fig, date, some prune and fresh ripe plum, the malty flavors hit next with chocolate, coffee, and toffee, then the spicy yeast and it finished with some alcohol warmth.  M: Creamy yet dry and warming in from the tongue all the way down.  D: There is an abundance of fruit and malts yet the sweetness is well balanced by the spicy yeast and alcohol. There is a nice finish and and nice alcohol that slows you down from drinking it too fast.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Tastes like dried candied fruit, plum, dried orange, hides the alcohol quite well. Good mouthfeel.

259,1708,AltBock,4.01,"Corked and caged 750ml bottle with a blue and yellow shield that contains a smiliing monk toasting a goblet that's filled with his beer. You would be smiliing too if you too had a goblet that is filled with Abt 12. The back of the bottle has all the information you need know about this beer. Silk screened to the back of the bottle is a brief history of the brewery, their beer making process, ingredients, how long it will age, best serving temperature, best serving glass, and the ABV%. They do stamp a best before date on the bottle, but they stamp it on the bottom. Mine use to be best before 22/03/12.  Appearance: Served in a Corsendonk Christmas Ale goblet. This beer was murky like a swamp. It was so murky that it was hard to tell what color it was. If I had to say what color it is, I would have to say that it's a dark caramel brown. It had a 1 inch bubbly head of white foam with good retention that left behind a nice sized white film, white foamy rings along the edges, and quite a few streaks of sticky white lace in its tracks.  Smell: Not only was the appearance murky, so was the smell. It was so murky that I had a hard time picking out the different aromas by themselves. All the aromas combined to form one big mob aroma. This mob of an aroma consisted of toasted and roasted malts, dark fruits, candy sugar, citrus fruits, a dash of pepper and yeast, and then ended with some juicy hops.  Taste: The taste was heavy with toasted and roasted malts, caramel, sweet plums, yeast, more dark fruits, bitter citrus hops, and ended with a big bite of sweet alcohol. The alcohol acted as a coating for every taste. For example; when I got the malts, every single malt had an alcohol coating. The same thing went for every other flavor that made it's appearance in the taste. It made for a very interesting taste.  Mouthfeel: It was clearly a full flavored full bodied beer that had a nice sized aftertaste of roasted malts, dark fruits, and crispy citrus hops. After those tastes had their time in the sun, it comes the alcohol. There was more alcohol than flavors. After the taste, I was expecting that to happen. It didn't bother to mask the ABV%. It wanted me to know that it was there and it was staying.  Drinkability: It's about time that I finally decied to pop one open and try it. I was glad that I did. Since it's almost everywhere, I will more likely try this one again in the future. It's one Belgian beer that everyone should try for themselves!",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Smell is complex with a panoply of dark fruits, big malts, grain, nectar, and sugary sweetness. Tastes a bit tart and not as complex as the aroma, but still quite tasty. Raisins, breads and slight hops finish things off. Alcohol is well-hidden. Mouth-feel is medium to full-bodied. Carbonation is excellent.

Nose consists of a delicious malt background of sweet bread and caramel. Ripe dark fruits are also present. Hugely complex and potent. Taste is incredibly sweet. It almost tastes like a wholesome candy. Bread, fruit, and spices are all present in just the right amounts. This feels great - very smooth. Medium bodied. A must-have for beer lovers!",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,MerkinMan,4.6,"Served on draft in a wide red wine style glass.  Color was dark brown and opaque with plenty of head.  Malty smell with small hints of fruit and yeast.  The mouthfeel was quite airy and silky.  Taste was out of this world with fruity / raisiny tones.  I probably would not drink much more than one of these at a time, but excellent nonetheless.  I would recommend this to people, like me, who do not really care for Belgian Blondes because this is quite different. A real surprise.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

It's Abt 12! I can easily polish off a 750 mL of this provided I'm not too full when I begin. Of course I'll be drinking this again.

It poured a very earthy brown with hints of red swirling throughout. A nice tan/red head that disappears in after a few sips. I have had this in a bottle as well and I feel that if you can get it on tap, especially at a place that has it at the right temp. you can smell the aromas of fruit, caramel, and clove right away as well as the alcohol. In the taste you can pick up raisins, caramel, lemon/citrus, clove, and possibly berries. It is very delicious and refreshing on the way down. When it strikes your palate you can really appreciate the flavors in this beer. It is a tremendous balance of everything. An easy beer to drink not heavy in carbonation and no very filling, just high in alcohol content.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Possibly some ripe melon in there too.  Didn't let this one sit out long enough. At (or close to) fridge temperature the flavors and armoa was a good deal muted.  A swirl of my chalice broght things to life, as did the gradual warming up of temperature.  Favors of raisins, caramel, tea leaves, lemon at first. Spicy clove hits towards the finish. There is also some dough there...cake, cookies?  Carbonation is vigorous, which surprised me dispite the quickly dissapating head. Tingly bubbles around the mouth.  Very good one to sit back and sip for the night. There's a reason why this is one of the most popular Belgian Quads.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Essence of pine, nutmeg and sweeter spice flavors with moderate hop presence. This tastes like a quintessential Belgian. Deep, soulful yeast/malt presence with well-balanced sweetness, hop and alcohol presence. As time passes it provides the warming feeling of Thanksgiving dinner with even a hint of sweet potatoes and roasted carrots (I know, now I'm really full of $#!+ - maybe it's the power of suggestion). The carbonation is moderate, inoffensive and pleasant. This is all-encompassing, powerful wonderful stuff.

Finishes dry with the high ABV being very noticable, but not taking away the flavor. This one has medium body with a good deal of carbonation, but still a smooth body. This is definitely a sipping beer considering the big flavor and high ABV. A beer definitely worth checking out.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Flavor is great and continues on for a long long time. The aftertaste has a hint of sweetened Marmite, which shows the yeast in this beer.

The head was about two fingers thick and had good retention as well as it lefe lace after every sip. The aroma was very delicious with a rich dark spicyness that reminded me of a holiday plumb sauce i had once made.

The taste is once again very sweet, maybe overly sweet - at least more than I expected. Very earthy with a lot of subtle spices - so subtle that I can't pick out any in particular, but I can definitely tell they are there (strange). It is a full bodied beer, a bit creamy, with a good amount of alcohol warmth coming through as I drink it. Lacing still hanging on the glass long after the beer is gone...

259,1708,younger35,4.15,"Picked up this 11.2 ounce bottle up at Bottleworks in Seattle. This is my first St. Bernardus brew and I'm excited to try it. Drank from my new Stone India Pale Ale specialty flute. Bottle dated 09 08 12 (assuming best before date).  Appearance- Pours a dark brown amber with a huge 3 finger, super rich and creamy light tan head. Recedes fairly slowly leaving a decent cap and collar that eventually fades away to nothing. A bit of lacing is left at the start but after that, none. Smell- Loads of dirty spicy yeast that give that familiar Belgium nose. Notes of vanilla and light oak are definitely present. Caramel is lightly sweet in the background along with plenty of alcohol. Taste- The alcohol is a bit more present than I'm used to in these Trappist brews (not necessarily a bad thing, it's just the first thing I noticed). Plenty of toffee to start and a light vanilla oak add a bit more sweetness. Plums, raisins and figs add a bit of dark fruit. Light bitterness is just enough to cut into some of the sweetness to leave this thing super balanced (what kind of hops do these monks use anyway?). Finishes semi nutty with a light lingering vanilla. Mouthfeel- Rich and creamy with a very nice full body and really aggressive sharp carbonation. Drinkability- Pretty damn good brew. For the most part the alcohol is hidden well and it's extremely well balanced. I haven't gotten to try all the Trappist brews yet but this one is on par with the ones I have had.

Copped a single, 12 oz bottle from Gary's in Madison... Absolutely incredible pour and appearance with a gigantic foamy, frothy, five-finger head that had incredible staying power and floated aloft a dark-brown, nutty hue... Smell was fresh and intense, with deep caramel and toffee notes... Smell was beyond terfiffic... rich, deep, intense, satisfying, and creamy... replete with candied brown sugars, malts, slight vanilla, and other flavors that are intricate and difficult to describe... a wonderful conglomeration of pure malty goodness that stuck to the mouth long after the first sip... one of the top Belgian beers, for sure... Great creamy and rich mouthfeel... drinkabliity only took a hit because of the hefty 10.5% ABV, which, by the way, is nearly impossible to detect - masked by a interwoven cornucopia of toffee, malts, and fig flavors that pack a punch...

259,1708,Squaretooth,4.48,"The first thing I noticed when I opened this 750ml bottle was the wonderfully complex smell that wafted up. With a mellow fruity apple scent that is almost indescribable, I could hardly wait to pour this. When I did pour it, an amazingly thick full head was realized. If anyone has ever baked before, it looks exactly like a yeast that is proofed. It is just that thick. It takes awhile before the head settles with broken spotty lacing that runs all the way down the side of the Lindemans Cuvee Rene glass I used. It's best to let this warm up a little if refrigerated. You really don't want to lose any of the flavor I'll be describing.  The liquid itself is an opaque, nearly light proof purplish brown color. It reminds me of an old apple cider I used to drink years ago.  Tastewise, this is as good as it gets for a Belgian ale. Very complex, not overly carbonated, with a light apple flavor that is the perfect balance between sweet and sour. At 11% ABV this will definitely warm you up and take the chill out of your bones on a cold winter's night, yet the alcohol isn't overpowering and barely noticeable. Just how on earth they do that is beyond me.  The mouthfeel is slightly bitter with just a hint of a bite to it.on the tip of your tongue I can't say enough about this 60th anniversary edition.

Belgian candi sugar moves in bringing some fruity esters with it. Big bold flavor, sweet. The taste hits you with clove and other spice, followed by candi sugar, light roasted malt, and some dark fruit esters. The feel is moderate to well bodied with very fizzy carbonation. Would have given the feel a 5 but the carbonation is a bit much. There is a nice balance between the sweet, spice, and roasted characteristics. Though it does lean on the sweet side. There is a bit of a belly burn due to the 10.5ABV. A very flavorful brew, perhaps a tad to fizzy and sweet.

It finishes with a grassy hops note that stands up to the big malts and adds a wonderful balance. This bottle ran out too quickly.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Very malty and fruity smell. Taste is basically what you would expect, heavy and good yeast/fruit flavor. This is a good Belgium trappist. Each one seems to bring something different to the table.

259,1708,wyattgene,5,"I was turned on to this beer just a couple of weeks ago at my next door neighbor's X-mas party. I am an Ale drinker but this was my first taste of a Quadruple Ale. This was absolutely hands down the best tasting beer I have experienced. I have tried 3 or 4 quadruples since and I enjoyed all of them. Today my special order arrived and I am just finishing my first bottle. This will be my reference Beer until I try something better. This has it all. I am not yet qualified to get all fancy with my descriptions but this beer poors great, smells great, is awesome on the front end and even better on the back end. This beer fired me up enough to seek it out and buy about a two month supply and join the beer advocate! I have to start somewhere don't I?",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Mudpuppet,3.71,"Thanks to triplecoil for the chance to try this.  A- Poured from a 750 into a Brooklyn wide style Champagne glass. Pours a dark mahogany with about 3-4 inches of head. Clipped the head with a knife like a Belgian bartender and it began to go down.  S- Very light aroma of most dark malts.  T- Starts out strong with malts with light notes of dark fruits. Most of the taste is coppery, metallic though. I enjoy this beer though.  M- Thick and malty. Coats your mouth with medium carbonation.  D- I could drink a few glasses of this. This is a very good quad!",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

It has more of an alcohol taste but it's very drinkable. I found it a much easier sipping beer than Delirium Tremens (my first high alcohol content beer, period).

Full flavored Ale Def alcohol hotness as it warms up..started around 60'F to begin with. Very, very, very subtle autolysis, also can be perceived as the yeast bite.

Smell- Sort of rich and complex but very alcohol filled.  Taste- The taste was not as strong on the alcohol as one would have expected but there is a little alcohol bite. It has some dry fruit and sugar tones that are dominant in the taste. Some mild hops finish this beer's flavor off nicely.  Mouthfeel- Medium body and smooth.

A few swirls brings the head back up.  Rich malty aroma. Very fruity with spicy clove and dark bread. Banana, plum, and dried fruit are all present. Very nice.  Starts with spicy clove before the sweetness hits. Lots of brown sugar with dark fruit and bready malts. Nice and juicy with grape and banana. A touch of butter shows up as well. Alcohol is barely noticeable, hiding under the sweetness and fruit, and slowly builds a nice warming sensation. Finishes sweet before turning dry.  Medium-full in body, smooth and creamy.

A bit of brown sugar sweetness. Basically I feel like this is a bucket of overdone sweetness. Feel is so-so. Carbonation seems to high and I feel it interferes with the flavor. Drinkability has to stay at 4. It just seems too much. I tried the Prior 8 right before this and found I liked it much better.

259,1708,mfreire212,3.45,"I have sampled this beer in the recent past, but didn't review it at the time. So, I decided to try it again for the holidays and pay more attention to it.  A: poured fairly cold (50's) from a standard bottle, into a pint glass. A bit darker then I was expecting, but after the initial surprise, I liked the amber color. The head was average in size and retention, with a slightly off white color.  S: Nice, complex odors as soon as I raised the glass to inspect the color. Sharp at first, followed by a hint of alcohol (which would become even more apparent in a minute). Actually intensified as the beer warmed a bit.  T: Lots of alcohol at first. Almost too much to notice anything else (I guess the proper term is peppery). As that subsided, I detected what reminded me of maybe raisins, or figs. Lingered for quite awhile, too.  M: As stated above, there is a lot going on here. I would describe it as average, once the initial shock wears off. It does have some carryover from one sip to the next (and I recommend sipping).  D: Not bad at all. I can't see having more then one of these per session, unless you were interested in getting hammered. A nice selection to enjoy on a cold night, by the fire.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Just a touch of ethanol heat.  m: As expected, the carbonation is high and smooth. The body is a very smooth medium.  t: Nice Belgian malt flavors and a great, crisp finish of papery hops. Tasty...very clean, yet flavorful. Flavors include dark fruits and clean, dark Belgian sugars. Some banana in the aftertaste.

The taste - that's why we're all here, right? - is fantastic. The alcohol is masked exceptionally well, and you never feel overwhelmed by it. It's an immensely drinkable beer. Only one very minor quibble: it leaves a slightly bitter aftertaste. This, of course, is no reason to throw the baby out with the bathwater. On the whole, the Belgians have outdone themselves again with this beer.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,supascape,4.9,"I first got my hands on this beer at the Brick Store Pub in Decatur, GA., a suburb of Atlanta. I saw a waiter delivering this gem in a rounded chalice to a group of guys. I asked them what they were drinking. They told me that it was the best beer that they had ever tasted and offered to buy me one. They said that I had to experience it. I had one...and another...and another! This brew is exceptional.  The beer was poured straight from the bottle (11.2 oz.) into an authentic St. Bernardus 12 chalice glass. The pub served the beer at 52 degrees F. The head was thick and foamy. The color of the head is khaki. When the head disappears, it leaves almost no lace. The color is deep, rich brown with hints of amber.  The nose is of fruit. Dates, raisins, molasses and a drop of smoke exist. The smell is awesome and reminds me of my great grandfather's pipe tobacco for some reason.  The taste is simply outstanding. It is complex with dried fruit. Apricots, raisins and dates, oh my! Wow. This is great. The semi-sweet malt is insane. This is like comfort food...for beer drinkers. The body warms after every sip. Trust me, this is a sipper. The 10.5% ABV says so!  The mouthfeel is fantastic. It is so smooth, creamy and rich. Very high-gravity. Almost like drinking milk. This is no exaggeration. It is that smooth.  Drink during a nice meal. The high ABV will prevent most people from drinking more than two or three per session.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

259,1708,morimech,3.75,"Poured from the bottle into a chalice. It is a dark amber with red highlights. A large, out of control head forms. Good head retention with sticky lacing. After a few minutes the foam transformed back into liquid. The pour wasn't aggresive in the least but it wasn't so bad if I just topped off the glass when it was half full.  The smell is a wonderful mix of dark fruit. Plums, raisins, cherries with a hint of alcohol and sugar.  The flavor is not as big as I expected. It is a sweet, almost sugar sweet. After you get by the sweetness some fruit and spice flavors are apparent. The alcohol is barely noticeable. It feels medium bodied and feels lively in the mouth. Finishes sweet which hampers drinking.  I tried this beer to see what the fuss was all about. Although it is a very good beer I don't think it lived up to my expectations. Just too sweet for my tastes. The cost is a bit prohibitive as well.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

One-finger head quickly desolves to a thin lingering cap. No lacing.  Ripe plums, raisins, and fig, along with sweet malts and brown sugar. Noticable alcohol.  Wow! Clove-laced ripe fruit and brown-sugar malts perfectly balance (and compliment) the warmth of the alcohol with a surprisingly neutral finish. Slightly metal aftertaste.  Just about perfect mouthfeel and carbonation level. Smooth!  It's kinda scary just how easy this is to drink... I'm doing my best to keep the reins tightened. Also IMO this is much better at the higher end of the suggested serving temp.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Somewhat disappointing flavor/aroma. Some sour cherries, plums, a hint of chocolate and a ton of yeast and spices. Also, the acohol is really prevalent. Bother-ingly so. It's a complex brew, but I wouldn't say the disparate elements are in harmony.

Good amount of head that lasts quite a while.  S: Sweet dark fruits, plum, raisin, a little yeasty. It smells thick.  T: Raisin, plum, brown sugar, very sweet (but not too much sweetness). Lots of alcohol in this one, but it's only slightly noticeable. The malts and sweetness mask nicely. Makes me think of fig newtons. Mmmm...  M: Nice and smooth with just the right amount of zest from the carbonation and alcohol.  D: The greatest beer I've had to date. I love this stuff.

Tasted so smooth with the spice flavors lingering. I wonder if there is some wheat in this-reminded me of a very mild hefe or wit with a better sweet malt base. Hops are there and give a little citrus but are light. Very enjoyable-very balanced. The alcohol is well hidden-a dangerous tripel as I could sip this all night.

Taste is very well-balanced with the tart dark fruits working together with the sweet maltiness. The 10.5% alcohol definitely reveals itself in this one but doesn't overpower.  Lighter mouthfeel, drying, with light fizzy carbonation. Alcohol adds a pleasant zip to the tongue. Well done, St. Bernardus.

The brewers state this is dubbel and after tasting I would agree, this was more or less a dark revved up double versus some Belgian strong dark/quads that I have come across.  Poured a very dark brown to slightly black into a Chimay goblet, with a nice billowy cream white head that kept and had some nice retention.  Aorma profile was light caramelized sugar, dried sweet cherries, citrus zest. No off flavors, some light alcohol present especially in the second pour as it warmed.  Flavor was much the same, some peppery mineral notes accent the sugars and dried fruit characters, some light woodiness as well, very balanced and drinkable, finishes dry.  I think often times people need a beer to WOW them to consider it very good, sometimes it just needs to be without flaws and drinkable. This is a beer worth repeat visits.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Don't get me wrong this is a great beer and I thoroughly enjoyed the sample. I do think this one could stand at least a year in the cellar just for good measure. Anyways enough with the drunken ramblings, burp!  This beer pours to a mysterious murky amber brown with a nice two finger head that dissipates to a frothy cover of bubbles over the top and plenty of lacing. The smell is of rasins or plums with a dash of booze, malt is running this show.  Tastes like a malted up plum soaked in booze, mmmm, thats a good thing. The alcohol takes the back seat to malt up front, and then dark fruity goodness followed by everybodys friend C2H5OH, lovely!  Mouthfeel is good but a shad light, nice aftertaste.

It smells like its going to be full of flavor, but I don't have an experienced nose to know what exactly the aroma is. With that said, I love the smell.  T: I know I sound like a broken record, but deep once again comes to mind. Bold is another great word for this one. Most of the flavor kicks in as after taste, but its a very pleasing strong flavor that once again I cant put my finger on.  M: It is a medium thickness in the mouth with a good level of in mouth carbonation.  D: The excellent but short lived after taste makes me want to go for another sip not quickly. I really enjoyed this one.  I cant put my finger on what the smell or taste of this one is, but I know that both are very enjoyable. St Bernardus' line has yet to disappoint me.

Like roasted cherries and raisins. The alcohol can be detected here but it's by no means overpowering. Malty profile shines through as well.  T - A very warming and spicy sensation tingles the taste buds instantly. Dates and figs make up the fruity end of the spectrum, while a nice malt backbone gives this hearty brew some significant balance. Again, the alcohol is present but not unnecessarily so. Not too complex, but what is present is phenomenal.  M - Warming, medium bodied brew with nice carbonation and a pleasant aftertaste. I wasn't sure what to expect here, as this was my first quadrupel, but I am quite impressed.  D - I'm not sure I could go through more than a few, the abv is rather high, but were I to make a night of this exquisite delight, it would certainly be a night to remember.

Head is thin and not quite as large as I'd expected, dissipating rather quickly and leaving some lacing. Smell is deep and complex, cloves and pepper; raisin, plum, and currants; a whiff of brandy and a touch of caramel, with yeast and bread mixed in for good measure. Taste is similar, dark fruits and spices leading the charge with rich breadiness underpinning it all. Earthiness and a bit of butter(?) as well, with the alcohol evident in the finish. Mouthfeel is a touch thin and a bit watery, though still good, and drinkability is good. A slight disappointment for me, it's very good but doesn't bowl me over the way I'd hoped it would.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Maybe some plum and then in the background a bit of alcohol.  Taste was better than the smell. Compared to other beers of this type I think this one hid the alcohol content better. A complex brew tasting of plum, raisins, brown sugar, malt ...all blended very well without one dominating over another.  Mouthfeel was good, very creamy but with a little carbonation bite on the tip of the tongue.  Very easy to drink this, even with the alcohol content.

It pours a very dark mahogony brown. with a very thick 3 finger cream head. The smell isn't very overpowering, mostly of light malt. But the taste, oh my the taste It is so complex to me I can't fully comprehend it. It's kind of a nutty flavor with the alcohol coming through as the beer warms up.

Head is very soft and 2-3 fingers high. It is like a puffy white cloud. This magnificent head hangs around on the side of the glass and a film on top that never leaves. When I swirl my glass, it leaves a little marshmallow in the middle.  S- The smell is complex. I get cream, vanilla, and brown sugar. Also, I pick up a subtle hop scent. I also pick up figs with a touch of alcohol to complete. The malt smooths everything over and mends all the different aromas.  T- From the tongue, I pick up nuts (pecans?), chocolate, sweet maple syrup, buttery bread with spices and nice malt.  D- Man, what else to say. This definitely ranks up there with the best I have had. Unreal beer. I could have given a *5* I suppose on certain aspects, but I am still in search for the worlds best beer.

259,1708,ndekke39,4.82,"Drank a bottle of this during a house-warming party. Best-by date says August 26, 2010. This turned out to be an exceptional beer. Poured the color of a cherry cola, with a tall, foamy head and amazing retention. A little bit of sediment at the bottom of the bottle. Constant effervescence. Smells and tastes are so complex. Aromas of white wine, concord grapes, apples, dark sugar. Flavors of apples, cherries, brown sugar molasses. And that's barely scratching the surface; there were so many more things that I couldn't identify. Mouthfeel is fizzy with a touch of alcohol bite, but otherwise this beer hides the alcohol quite well. Very drinkable beer - enjoyable for its complexity.

Smells of cloves, blegium sugars, dark fruits and alcohol.  Serving this one rather warm....  Tastes of alcohol up front with a thick brown sugary like taste. Almost brandy like.  Mouthfeel really does it for me! So smooth and creamy for the high alcohol taste. To me, this is the real balance and magic of this beer. Probably the reasons for the high ratings.

Head retains well at about 1/2 finger and plenty of lacing is left behind in the glass.  S- This has a big, deep, warm nose. Dark fruits such as raisins and plums arise first accompanied by a Belgian candy sweetness and lots of bready yeast.  T- The initial flavor is dominated by raisins and plums but quite noticeable in the background are Belgian sugars and a solid, sweet, bready yeast backbone. The fruitiness becomes more powerful for the finish, while a phenolic bitterness and hints of spicy yeast arise. What lingers is fruity sweetness wrapped in a warm blanket of alcohol.  M- Low to medium carbonation and big full body. Extraordinarily smooth.  D- This is a very nice quad that, despite the high ABV, I found to be very drinkable.

Had a haziness from the yeast. Thick head that left some nice lacing.  Smell was very vinous. Plums, prunes, raisins, and candy sugar were very present. A very fruity aroma that just entices you to take that first sip.  Taste was much the same as the smell. Prunes and raisins, with a hint of cherries maybe. There also was a hint of vanilla and an earthiness I'm guessing coming from the yeast. Also some esthery flavors.  Mouthfeel is medium and chewy. Alcohol is ver present.

This is a beautiful beer, and it announces its presence with a dense aroma of figs, vanilla and plantains (you get the picture - sweet, sweet, sweet).  The taste of Abt 12 was as rich and complex as the scent, but unlike other reviewers, I actually preferred it before it warmed - toward the end of the glass, I found the taste to be overly sweet. My only other ""complaint"" is the alcohol content; at 10.50%, I was feeling this beer by the end of the glass. Carbonation was tight and dense, perfect for this beer and the style.

Raisin comes out with tofee and caramel with a slight chocolate taste as the beer moves down the tong. Dried fruit notes and vanilla come out as well. Oh my god, this beer just becomes wonderfully cohesive as it warms. It's fucking amazing. Holy shit.  The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated and clings well. The beer turns to cream when it hits the palate. As the beer warms, the creaminess comes out more and it's a beergasm. Oh my god. This is one hell of a beer.  I could drink this all day. Man.

Poured into a belgian chalice glass, the Abt 12 is a beautiful dark beer, with hues of mahagony, ruby red, burnt orange, all shining through. It could almost pass for a port or a sherry, were it not for the thick mound of foam on top. A great head that does not fade away. A really pretty beer. The nose is sweet. Candied sugar, date, bananas, fig, malted goodness... it's all in there. The taste follow suit, with a lot of candied sweetness and dark fruit. But there's a nice hop balance here which keeps it from being too sweet. The mouthfeel is full and smooth, almost chewy. Very formidable.  This is a great beer. Sure, at 10.50% ABV, it's a big one, but you should what you're getting yourself into with a quad in the first place.

259,1708,Kendo,4.4,"A: Got it on tap at Lionheart in Albany, where they serve it in a pint glass (a bargain at $7 for happy hour or if you're in the dart league). . . . Body is murky brown with crimson hues around the edges. A fairly small tannish/ivory head settles on top. Plenty of sheets of lacing on the way down. . . .  S: Ripe apples, brown sugar, bubble gum, raisins, dark fruit and hint of alcohol heat at first. Alcohol becomes much more noticeable as it warms and I get towards the bottom of the glass -- reminds me of rum, actually.  T: Pretty similar to the nose -- dark berries, ripe fruit, dried fruit (esp. raisins) and bubble gum at first, then alcohol warmth at the end of the sip and down the gulley. There is a lingering dry bitterness on the back and sides of the tongue, however, which nicely offsets the malty sweet stuff. As it warms the alcohol becomes even hotter -- the taste reminds me of rum-soaked raisins or port wine.  M: Heavy in body, but with a good spritzy dry finish which, topped off with the alcohol heat, makes it seem a tad bit lighter in the mouth.  D: Very good for the ABV strength, but the alcohol pops up and reminds you to slow down a little.  Notes: I almost gave it a 5 in smell, but left it at 4.5 b/c of the alcohol as it warms. . . .

259,1708,jmalex,4.21,"One of my first experiences with Belgian beer and definitely my first Quadruppel. I've gone back several times since and get to again today on a beautiful NFL Sunday.  APPEARANCE: Poured slowly into my Trois Pistoles chalice being careful to leave as much sediment as I could. Despite the slow pour, the head is magnificently one finger high and just a few shades darker than white. It's very small bubbled and constantly being refreshed. The beer itself is a dark brown - almost purplish. As I drink, lacing is in sheets. Someone explain to me how this could be any better.  SMELL: The smell is much more fruity and estery than it is yeasty. Citrus, raisin, and dark fruits are quite prominent. As it warms, it becomes much more bready and some darker caramel and plum flavors come out more. Alcohol is well hidden though present.  TASTE: The flavor is bready, spicy, and fruity, though much less so on the fruit than was present in the aroma. The flavors meld so well and are just seamless that individual flavor components are difficult to isolate and describe. Alcohol presence is significant and adds but at the same time detracts from the flavor. A bit is ok, but there's a bit more than that. Overall, fantastic complexity, but a bit hot.  MOUTHFEEL: The body is medium full and very smooth. Carbonation is actually subdued but very fine.  DRINKABILITY: Despite the heat from the alcohol, this goes down way easier than it should. It could have been harsh, but instead it's velvety smooth even though you know you're drinking a heavy hitter. For style, it's nearly perfect.  I'll keep coming back to St. B especially since it's so easily available.

Nice nose, big hit of plummy sweetness, and a darker breadiness in the back. I get a bit of yeast as well, and a cloying sweetness that bothers me. The palate is an attack of candi sugar and Belgian yeast. A lot of fig, and plum and bread as well but that sweetness is not really my thing.

Appearance: Pours a nice and clear brown color with a 1 finger tan head. There is a little bit of lacing on my snifter.  Aroma: Starts with some nice malts and a slight alcohol burn. This is followed by dark fruits, figs, roasted malts, and slight cherry. The aroma on this was a little more pronounced than the Westy12 and less than the Rochefort 10. Very nice and inviting.  Taste: The tastes are similar to the aroma, but not a noticable. Cherry and dark fruits from the start followed by warming alcohol and some spicy hops.  Mouthfeel: The dark fruit and malt flavors hang for a bit. This is pretty creamy.  Drinkability: This goes down too smooth for 10%. A 4 pack of this would be no problem, but splitting this bottle is nice.  Overall. This finished behind the Rochefort 10 and Westy 12 in this tasting and slightly above the Chimay Blue. I aged a 750ml of this for a few years and it was incredible. It was probably all 5's or damn close if I rated it. The 750s are quite a bit better than the 12 oz bottles IMO.

259,1708,HoustonTX,4.35,"This beer has some of the craziest carbonation/head swelling I've ever seen. A sickly untamed head off-white in color with crystal infused flakes. It grew quickly from about a half inch, to well over two. The carbonation pressing upwards maintained and multiplied the head at the same time. Definitely the most out of control head I've seen, especially since I poured it way under the suggested temperature limit. Anyways onto the body. Dark ruby in color with about a 35% visibility rate.  Aromas of figs, prunes, raisins, a hint of menthol, alcohol, and a sweet succulent herbal note. All pressed against an extremely potent malt influx.  Loads of complexity from the initial sip. Sweet and yeasty upfront with a Belgian candied sugar edge. Sweet notes include, cherries, green grapes, peeled raisins, candied sugar, and hollowed out honey combs. Malt balances presents itself midway through the sip. Combined with the yeast complexity, the malt provides a dry earthy tantalizing flavor that rounds out, and invites you to take another sip. Sweet, juicy, succulent, and complex.  Surprisingly perfect mouthfeel for this style. Although it may just be a bit too thin. Still feels right though, and definitely helps the drinkability.

A - Dark brownish color, a deep red when held to light. Small specks of yeast are seen floating about. The head is a fluffy, sort of rocky, light brown with little dark bits in it. Lots of lacing, but not the most I've seen.  S - Smooth bready maltiness with a lighter fruitiness, almost sour. Cherries make up a lot of the fruitiness. Some bittering hops are present, making the beer smell more like a typical American ale rather than a typical Belgian dark. Theres also a very fine hint of alcohol presence.  T/M - The taste starts out with a medium body and some light, simple, malts. Malts are very faintly spiced and very bready. A light carbonation tickles the palate (it feels really fizzy, but nothing like a heavy carbonation fizz). The simple malty taste seems to linger for a while, the first hints of bitterness come in and a sweet fruity flavor quickly follows. The taste really gets going right after swallowing, the fruits become much more defined, amplified: dried cherries, grapes, maybe some berries. Not a very dark fruity taste, but more light and sweet. The (after)taste finally sweetens out a little bit more and a warming alcohol sensation finishes out.  D - Overall it looks good, smells good and tastes amazing.

I have one more bottle and getting one more from my dutch friend but let's take a look at this one first. It pours out with a huge bubbly head that retains pretty well; color was the typical dark brown as like many dark belgian ales. The smell was yeasty, and alcoholic fruity; somewhat vinous but not as pleasing as I would have liked it to be. I had a sip and it was alcoholic plums or raisins leaving a lot of alcoholic fruitiness on the nose. It was sweet and the yeasty taste was also clear on this one. For some reason this taste reminds me of the Gouden Carolus although I forgot to review it when I tasted it. The after taste was plums, raisins, grapes and was pretty strong and pleasant. This Quad is closed to full body and was clearly rich and almost syrupy. Carbonation was surprisingly high but it was still pretty smooth but drinkability would have dropped due to its high and evident alcohol content. I am pretty disappointed as I put this up close with the Westvleterens but seems like it does not even qualify in my top 10 beers list which I expected it to be in anytime.

Having to revisit the beer in disbelief, I found that yes I do get some grape in the flavor, but not like before. Prune, raisin, brown sugar, alcohol. Warming vinous finish. M: Wonderful! The kind that makes you hold it in your mouth, swirling it around, not wanting to let it go. Luxurious I guess is the right word. D: At first I didnt think this beer was going to live up to its hype, but the taste and mouthfeel did it for me. I can see why it's considered a world-class beer.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,BMoney575,4.31,"Sampled on 9-12-07 Best before 12-14-11  Pours with an insane, glass-filling off-white head that yields a deep, red/brown liquid. The foam piles like whipped cream on the top.  Smell is very sweet with lots of dark fruits, lightly boozy with a definite roasted character.  Taste is surprisingly malty, roasted, very doppelbock. Tons of dark fruitiness, with a big-time alcohol bite.  Mouthfeel is great, not too thick but super smooth.  Drinkability is good, but the alcohol is intense.  Overall, the standard in quads. Huge flavors and huge alcohol. A unique experience and highly recommended.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,kernalklink,3.27,"This brew poured a nice cloudy brown with big fluffy white head a great lacing. Aromas were of green apple skins, slight cloves and champagne grapes. First sip- big yeastiness and alcohol on the finish with a sour bitterness underlying it all. There is an herbal spiciness which helps mask the obvious alcohol which does a lot to warm the throat. The malts are not too sweet and overpowering but there is an almost lack of true belgian flavor when compared to their other offerings- i was slightly dissapointed; a little flat on the delivery. Ill try this one again sometime soon.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,IPAcraig,4.43,"Poured into my De Garre snifter from an 11.2 oz bottle  This beer pours a dark brownish ruby with a massive 4 finger head, off white, clingy head. Excellent lacing.  Has a very nice malty smell, that is semi-sweet and is balanced by a slight roasty chocolate aroma. An excellent smell, could be bigger, but very nice.  I have had this once before, and I wasnt too impressed. Upon further review, this is an excellent beer. A nice malty flavor as in the nose, with an unexpected chocolate flavor. However it has a nice yeasty dark fruit flavor that is great. It has a fairly substantial alcohol presence in the aftertaste, but despite being very apparent it is not a bright, harsh flavor; rather it is pleasantly warming.  An excellent beer, lots of flavor without being heavy or out of balance. Perfect drinkability.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,77suburban,4.38,"Appearance: Golden brown, slightly reddish. Pours easily into a snifter glass with a perfect two-fingers of lacing which is fairly thick, but not as much so as some.  Smell: I had a hard time pinpointing the aroma. Others have called it clove, and I do detect that. I can also pick up an orange and ginger aroma.  Taste: Slightly syrupy, the clove is there again, sweet - but not overpowering - and malty. This is not the most technical terminology, but I'm reminded of a high quality root beer in that it is sweet and creamy but not overly sweet as to dominate the other flavor subtleties.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, creamy, heavier up front but much lighter on the finish.  A good beer to sip throughout the evening. It would go well with a nice piece of quality cheese. A good beer for the wine aficionados to cross over to the world of quality brews.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

259,1708,Maracuja,4.5,"Murky reddish brown hue. Well retained, thick, light tan head. Yeast derived nuttiness and rustic must at first in aroma, ensued by ripe peach like fruitiness, mellow banana esters and notes of molasses and butter. Hint of pleasantly salty mineraliness is discernible as well. Toffeeish malt and mild banana esters are perceived concomitantly initially in flavor, then are ceded by smooth notes of carob and clove. Malt character is bready sweet, akin to brown sugar dusted crusty whole wheat bread. Understated notes of dark fruit including typical prune like notes uniquely coupled with a citric tartness. Hint of bubblegum esters. Moderately bodied. Once the initially high carbonation diminishes, the mouthfeel is full, smooth and very pleasant. Finishes with light clove and caramel briefly lingering. Abt 12 is a delicious, complex, and supremely drinkable brew. Flavorwise, it's reminescent of their 8, although much more pronounced all around. Highly recommended and worth the cost.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

The quadrupel pours an extremely dark ruby red with a huge three finger head tan colored head. The bubbles rising to the top indicate the head is here to stay.  What a nose on this beer! Smells of sugar and spice and everything nice. I pick up on cloves and Belgian candy sugar sweetness along with some fruity esters, clove and a touch of cinnamon. Hints of dark fruit such as figs and plums. Quite the delight!  The taste is nearly as extraordinary as the smell. Similar taste as it smells with candy sugar mixed with a slight buttery flavor with some hints of the aforementioned fruit. Finishes warm as this quad flexes its muscles showing off some of the alcohol, but it's in check and not at all unreasonable given the style. The progression of flavor seems well thought out and scripted.  Mouthfeel is medium as the carbonation dance over the tongue spreading the flavors enjoyably. Drinkable given the style as each attribute of this quadruple is in check and enjoyable. I will be purchasing this again, but it will be a rare treat as its an expensive 11.2 oz.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Sitting on top is a light tan head of an incredible creamy consistency.  S: Unbelievable aromas of caramel, figs, rum soaked raisins, cola nut, plums, and lightly roasted malt. So incredibly complex!  T: Sweet caramel malt, cola, coconut, and the aforementioned dark fruits.  M: Smooth, creamy, like drinking velvet wrapped in silk.  D: Truly, the benchmark for the style.

A good way to wrap up a weekend.  Bottle best by March 22, 2011.  Pours a deep dark amber color, with a nice large thick head on top.  Aromas are floral, spicy, bread like, and with some oak as well.  Prickly and tart on the tongue with the first sip. A bit spicy, and with a very creamy and fruity backbone. Only the slightest hint of alcohol noticed on the finish. Very complex, full flavored, and tasty.  Mouthfeel is excellent... nice and full. The feel in the mouth is thick, and the flavors really linger in the mouth.  Drinkability is good. This is a potent beer, even though the flavors aren't overly strong.

Beer pours a beautiful dark brown almost black with a tan head.  Taste is raisins, bread, maybe some candy?  Mouthfeel is chewy - you will actually smack your lips while drinking this.  Overall, this beer is absolutely fantastic. However, it is much better on tap than in the bottle. While still good in the bottle, there's an excess of carbonation that downgrades its drinkability and mouthfeel.

The smell promises a hint of the alcohol and a smell of light malted smell with raisins and figs and dates maybe...it was good..had this with some blue cheese  The taste was out of this world..slight alcohol taste but it was overpowered by the fruity tastes with a just a hint of smoky wood taste or something in the back..(I'm still learning how to describe tastes)  This was a great beer and I'm so glad I stepped out and ordered it, with the nudging of a great waiter at the Brick Store.

The lacing is outrageous and the retention is exceptional.  Aromas of raisin and brandy hit my nose first. Then comes yeast and spice, and ripe dark fruit.  The dark fruits explode in the flavor, coating the tongue with raisin, fig, and plum. The taste elucidates the spicy aroma, uncovering a distinct clove note. Candi sugar and rich caramel. Delicious!  The mouthfeel is so rich and chewy it almost feels like it's not a liquid. Absolutely luxurious. Amazingly smooth and creamy, great carbonation.  The Belgians clearly have the quadrupel down pat. Westy 12, Rochy 10 and now Berny 12 (yeah I have pet names for them, so what) have really highlighted the craftsmanship of Belgian ales to me.

I'm happy to say I've turned some friends onto this beer, but now I've got to protect my stash whenever they're over.  It pours a deep murky brown, though some of the yeast would settle out. The dark tan head is almost an inch and begins to fade immediately, but leaves some pretty lacing over the first half of the glass.  Nose is chock full of malty caramel sweetness, plenty of ripened fruit, clove, and some chocolate and brown sugar along for the ride. Boozy too. Rich, complex, mouth-watering, and I'm considering giving this a ""5"", but the strength isn't quite there to do so...  ...with the taste, however, there is little question to me this is a ""5"" Delicious raisin, plum, vanilla, clove, and cookie dough glides across the palate, with a little unexpected but welcome citrus. It's even a little nutty, and there's even a little more alcohol in the flavor than I noted in the aroma. (I'm not complaining!) A beer to savor...theoretically at least...I myself haven't been too successful at sipping this very slowly.  Carbonation is briefly a bit high, but within a couple minutes this is smooth as silk, with a great full body and warming finish. Overall drinkability is absurd.

With the fruit & malt flavors, it's not a bad overall taste, but the odd spice kind of ruins it for me.  M: Full body - high carbonation - slight alcohol burn.  D: The alcohol is not hidden as well as I'd like, so it's a sipper for sure.

I have never had the pleasure of the Westvytaren experience but if it is better than the St. Bernardus Abt, I need to get me some of that. This beer is pure ectasy, smooth and the type of flavor that makes it very hard for me to drink even the best of the rest, seriously. Some of my favorites of the past just simply are not worthy now. This beer has done real damage to my beer psyche.  Mouthfeel--Silky. Just like silk in the mouth. Did I mention how much I love this beer?  Drinkability--I feel selfish and gluttenous to say that I have had several of these in recent days. I seem to be growing an addiction to the beer. Not an alcoholic type of addiction, more like a love affair that is newly blossomed. This is not for the light of heart mind you, this will put a major wallop on you if you are not careful.

Malt adds backbone while hops add a nice sharp edge. Sweet and slightly syrupy but not cloying. Alcohol shows in the finish with a pleasant warming in the back of the throat.  Mouthfeel: High carbonation that could detract from this beer if not there to help control the alcohol. It adds a creaminess that defines conventional wisdom.

The taste is mainly like caramel, with a hint of banana. Fabulous!  Mouthfeel - Smooth and syruppy, with a fantastic aftertaste. Pretty much impossible to fault in this category.  Drinkability - Very drinkable despite the high alcohol content, simply because it tastes so great.  Overall - Probably the best beer I've ever had, and the best I have reviewed here.

It's sitting next to my monitor .. about three feet from me and notes keep sliding up my nostrils. On closer examination ... real fruit, apricot, cherry, dried peaches, some mellow spices round out this portfolio.  Strong alcohol slams the tongue and I don't know if it recovers. Fruits for sure, again the apricot and cherry but with little or no sweetness like the smell. Caramel, licorice, spices (like cumin or something on those lines) interesting culmination.  Heavy with lots of pop on the tongue. I couldn't quite grasp this beer.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,markaberrant,3.78,"A - Very dark red, only a little light shines through. Small head by belgian standards, but respectable. Good lacing.  S - light smooth chocolate, fair bit of alcohol and some dark malt. Ok.  T - starts out spicy, a bit of dark malt in the middle, and then a fruity finish with a mild chocolate aftertaste (gets overpowered by the alcohol). Sweetness becomes more apparent as it warms.  M - creamy smooth, spice and alcohol combine for plenty of warmth. Lots of carbonation, a little much at the start for my taste.  D - I find the alcohol character a little too strong.  Like most Belgians I've been drinking lately, I find the carbonation rush at the start bring out the harsh alcohol tones. The true beauty of this beer reveals itself only after it has settled down. However, I still find this one pales in comparison to Rochefort 10.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,bluemoonswoon,4.38,"1pint 9.4oz bottle split and poured into oversized wine glasses after the cork blew off as soon as I loosened the cap. Needless to say a very very carbonated beer.  A: Pours a beautiful dark ruby with a tan bubbly head the has great retention but little lacing but I assume that is because of the shape of the glass. Nice ropes of carbonation bubbling throughout the glass.  S: The smell is nice and complex as I would expect with most of the smell being dominated by a sweet malt presence with a fruity yeast backbone, pears and cloves for starters.  T/MF: Big hit of carbonation with touches of pear and clove spice but overly dominated by the carbonation so I let it sit for a while. After a bit of time left to warm the beer takes on its true form. The malts begin to take over and a extra creamy and sweet but there are also nice hints of spice like cloves and lemon zest the begin to appear as the beer warms further in the mouth. Finishes pretty clean with a warm alcohol finish. A deceptivly heavy brew.  D: Shared this with some friends on a cool summer evening and was a bit hit. Would probably try some other styles from this brewer before picking this up again, but a solid offering here.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

A touch of alcohol in the finish along with some fruit, grapes and dates maybe?  Mouthfeel is perfect! Smooth and creamy, fantastic. Slides right down the back of the throat.  Drinkability is very good for the abv. Be careful! It is easy to forget about the 10.5%.  Overall, a wonderful beer!

Tastes like pure bliss, loads of malt and fruit hit first, balenced nicely with a great hop bitter ending with a hint of the wonderful belgian yeast flavor lingering on the tongue. Awesome.

The aroma, like most Belgians is very delicious. Fruit notes dominate, along with a slight alcohol presence. The taste is a complex mix of dark fruits, malts, spice, and alcohol. Again the fruit taste dominates the palate, but there are noticeable contributions from the malts and a hint of spice, followed by a slight warming by the alcohol. Smooth thick mouthfeel.

259,1708,BucBasil,4.35,"Appearance: An amazing looking beer that really tempts you to come and drink it. I poured this monster of a beer into a tulip glass (I tried a wine goblet, but it was too small to contain the head!). The beer looks a deep ruby color when held to the light and contains a 3 to 4 finger head that accumulates very rapidly.  Smell: This is, in my opinion, the best feature of this beer. Initial wafts reveal a raisin-like aroma that changes into something a bit richer and and exotic. Bananas maybe, but not quite - maybe closer to fresh banana bread, but weaker than that. Very hard to describe, but very inviting nonetheless.  Taste: The first sip knocked my socks clean off. I was actually taken back at how strong this thing was. After I got used to it a bit (smaller sips) I could finally start discerning the different tastes in this highly complex brew. Fruits included raisins, hints of pear and rum-soaked bananas. The rum note strengthened as I held it in my mouth longer, forcing me to swallow, but the taste lingered in the finish. Amazing complexity, but not what I was expecting at all...  Mouthfeel: This is the weak side of this beer, though it still ranks pretty highly. Has the slightest amount of carbonation that dies off after a second, leaving a sort of watery feel in the mouth.  Drinkability: High alcohol content makes this a dangerous one, but I'm tempted to go pour another glass almost immediately.

However, I have not run into it nearly as often on draft here in Baltimore, so was very pleased to see it on draft at Max's the other day.  The beer pours an impressive brown, rootbeer color, with outstanding head retention and lacing. The head retention and lacing is about as good as I've ever seen. On the nose one gets cherry and vanilla, but it doesn't smell as sweet as I remember. On the palate I'm equally surprised, as again the beer is not nearly as sweet as I seem to recall. On the palate I get more vanilla, along with sort of a creamy, dry rootbeer flavor. The flavors are complex and quite impressive, and the mouthfeel is amazing. The beer is soft and plush, with a mouthfilling presence. This beer is very smooth and long, with the flavors just lasting on and on. The 10.5% abv. is certainly noticeable, but for all that this beer is remarkably drinkable.  Excellent beer.

Amazing aroma; figs, caramel, toffee, earthy yeast, banana, a touch of alcohol, cinnamon, vanilla, and nutmeg. Enough said.  Beer starts off with caramel, toffee, and a hint of biscuit flavors. This leads into the fruitier flavors such as banana, prune, fig, and a touch of pear. The finish is very spicey cinnamon, nutmeg, coriander, and black pepper notes. Smooth mouthfeel with a bone dry finish leaving your palate fresh and ready for another sip. WOW.

Poured into it's own St. Bernardus Watou chalice  Smell, Big fruit flavors up front, raisins, plums, apples, pretty sweet nose, little bitterness or alcohol  Taste, follows right along. Big hits of dark fruits, mild twang from the alcohol, but not what typically shows itself in a Quad, if I didn't have this beer thousands of times, I would think it was some sort of off flavor. Mild bitterness does counter the sweetness, but lack of strength of the alcohol really lets the malts and sugars do whatever they please.  Overall, A great find at The Beer Yard. While this one certainly doesn't get drank every day, it is beers like this that makes us wish we didn't have a job so we could. Great in the bottle, but so much smoother on tap.

It produces a huge foamy head after poured, that settles down to leave behind some great lacing. What a great looking Beer!!!  Smell is just off the wall, hints of sweet fruit and a touch of alcohol.  The taste is really complicated to pin down, there is just too much going on in a good way. It's like drinking a sweet flower of some kind, with that extra little kick of warmness the high alcohol content provides.  It has the perfect amount of carbonation going on, and the high alcohol content really warms up the mouth. It's still a really smooth beer for it's high alcohol content.  Drinkability depends on what your after. No, you can't just chug these beers, just two of them should get you pretty warmed up. I rated it's drinkability high just based on taste.

No malt or yeast odors, you could smell it 10 times and pick out 10 new compounds. T: Fantastic, bready, sugars (brown) and fruits. M: Smooth, creamy, chewy.

259,1708,NittanyBeerFan,4.2,"Appearance - Pours a deep brown that looks like a combination of raisins and a deep amber color, 2 finger head that lingers for a while and then dissipates.  Smell - Smells largely of raisins with hints of fig and plum. Other scents include roasted malts with a bit of hops in the background. Predominantly raisin though.  Taste - The number of ingredients allows you to get a different taste ever time you sip, as you can focus on a different ingredient's contribution to the beer. Extremely well balanced, as unless you are looking, you can't really pick out one single ingredient. This beer is much better if you allow it to warm to about 50 degrees to allow all the flavors to develop. High alcohol content with relatively little booze taste.  Feel - Real smooth on the palate, lightly carbonated...enough to give you good head, but little enough to be pretty smooth...If you don't get a ton of head, the beer will be more carbonated, so a good balance is important with this one.  Drinkability - Very tastey and satisfying, but too heavy to enjoy more than one, maybe two.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,CarolinaCardinals,4.87,"Original Review 4-15-2007 Picked up a 11.2 oz bottle from AJ's in late October for $4.19. Best before 22 12 10.  Beer poured brown with a nice long lasting off white head. Not quite as good looking as the Dubbel-4.5. Nose is of bananas, dark fruits, and Belgian yeast-4.5. Taste is perfect for the style, of dark fruits, candied sugar, chocolate malts, and balanced perfectly by a dry hop-5.0. Mouthfeel is full, well carbonated, and perfectly smooth-5.0! Drinkability is perfect! The alcohol is perfectly masked. This is a great abbey ale that I will definitely treat myself to in the future! I look forward to the anniversary edition i have sitting on the sidelines - 5.0 (4.85 overall)!  Re-review 1-5-2021 Picked up as part of a mixed pack in January 2020 from TW Arrowhead. Best before 03 11 22. Beer poured brown with a beautiful tan head that has some seriously good hang time - 4.75. Nose is dark fruit, sherry, and candied sugar-4.5. Taste is perfection; sourdough malt base combines wonderfully with candied sugar, plums, and currants with a nice hop addition to balance things perfectly-5.0. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a perfect silky smoothness! Overall this has been a favorite of mine over the years and it never changes - 5.0 (4.87 overall)!",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Carbonization is slightly high (higher than the Rochefort 10, for example), but this is refreshing, not bothersome.  Slightly expensive.

S: Good big malty nose with sweet brown sugar characteristics. Faint clove like phenolic aroma as well. Some fruity plum like notes and a touch of hoppy aroma finish it off.  T: Taste is big and malty sweet, bready. Slight clove taste as well. Some fruity esters detectable. Moderate, gentle hop flavor and bitterness on the back end.  MF: Aggressive carbonation adds to perception of a thick all encompassing mouthfeel. Significant alcohol warmth.  D: Very complex and satisfying. This is a very good beer worthy of its high marks.

Large amount of dark fruit (raisins, plums).  The first thing I tasted was the sweet, clove and fruitiness of the beer. Lots of deep, carmelized malt flavor. Slight alcohol bite as it goes down, but not overpowering. The mouthfeel was fairly full and creamy, and really makes you want to take another sip.  This is an outstanding abbey ale, and a beer to really take your time and savor. I paired this with a baked ziti made w/sausage, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese, and it really stood up well to it.

Pours a dark reddish amber hue with orange highlights. The beer is pretty cclear and filled with an endless flow of rising bubbles like a jacuzzi, some sediment floating. The crown is soft and thick. The crown sustains a presence throughout the entire drinking and laces the side of the glass in parts. The aroma starts with a thick bready, yeast-like smell, followed by softer fruity notes banana, cherry, and grape juice, some tart citrus. Its hard for me to describe the taste. It's complex, malty with fruity notes, some cherry, grape juice, raisins, and a definite noticeable trace of alcohol. Mouthfeel is great, the beer spreads nicely over the tongue and just melts into my tastebuds. This is a delicious beer that I'd definitely try again. You really start to feel the alcohol about halfway through the beer. I'm smiling just looking at the monk on the bottle, I want another.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

I didn't want any of the sediment to get into the glass, I failed.  Dark aubergine purple in colour, the head vanished to leave a thin ever shrinking layer of bubbles, some of which tried to cling to the side of the glass.  Victoria Plum aroma, with rich fruit cake, not a hint of hops, malts or yeast.  Heavy on the alcohol, plum pudding, Dundee cake with malt bread and rich Christmas spices.  A rich fruity, spicey, sweetness lingers on the palate, too sweet for me.  Good beer, but not in my top 100, not from this tasting anyway, I have one more bottle, i'll allow it to age for a few years and re-visit in 2010, if I can store it that long.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

A- Dark brown/ ruby liquid with a large amount of carbonation streams giving way to a 1cm thick white head. Great head retention. A decent amount of floaters too.  S- Very complex. Apple juice is the first thing I notice. Some brown sugar, wood, vanilla, raisin, bread. Can't really get any alcohol here.  T- Wow, this beer never disappoints. There is a strong fruit flavor to this, apples, raisin, and a noticeable grape soda flavor as well. Bready, with some wood and vanilla notes in there as well. Hints of brown sugar too. A little sweet at first and then a little sour.  M- Some great carbonation lightens things up a bit, but does not cause this to feel like foam in the mouth. A little dry, but not anywhere close to being a problem. A great alcohol warming finish on the swallow.  D- This beer is stellar. A great treat, and a great sipper.

Russet brown, minor burgundy highlights. Aroma is all sweet malt, maybe baker's chocolate. The flavor is sweet, powerful malt, notes of cherry, dried grape, possibly currant..dark fruits ester goodness. Big mouth presence, absolutely perfect body, carbonation is just right. The drinkability rating should probably be knocked down just because the warming 10+% does catch up with you, but it's such a small part of the flavor that I can't find it in me drop it more than a half point off perfection.

Apple and pear aromas almost, but not quite, mask the alcohol smell and also come through nicely on the flavour. Medium-bodied, and fairly powerful, but altogether very balanced - every nuance works well together rather than one screaming for attention like with certain big Belgian-style beers.

Fantastic nose, palate, mouthfeel. Exemplary Belgian ale. If you haven't had this, change that. Now. Thank me later.  Appearance: Pours a deep brown/molasses color into my tulip. Huge, fluffy coffee ice cream head. Lacing is FILTHY.  Smell: Belgian yeast is the predominant odor. Bananas and bubblegum, apples and alchohol. A bit of citrus in the nose as well. Some bready malt character, too.  Taste: Belgian abbey ale at its finest. Big yeasty notes surrounded by fruit - grapes and figs come to mind. Noble hops are apparent as well. Just a wonderful flavor experience.  Mouthfeel: Substantial thickness without being too viscous. Low and very smooth carbonation is just perfect for allowing all the flavors to come out here.  Drinkability: Dangerously drinkable for something over 10%. What's interesting is that the alcohol is very present in both the nose and the mouth, yet it doesn't hinder drinkability in the least.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Explodes out of the bottle with a furious off-white head that quickly recedes, leaving a half-finger ring with a shitton of lacing. The beer is dark brown to black and barely admits light.  The aroma is estery and phenolic, with mixed malts and lots of yeasty banana notes. It smells extremely, extremely Belgian.  Turbocharged, jet-fuel alcoholic flavor, but balanced in a way that only a Belgian quad can manage. The spicy notes, fruity esters, and malts just complement the alcoholic warmth perfectly. Strong Belgian yeast on the finish. Good shit.  The mouthfeel is heavy and creamy on the palate, with a lot more carbonation than I was expecting, but it's not bad. After a minute or two the carbonation settles down and the beer is silky smooth-- really stunning.. As for drinkability, it's smooth as hell for the maltiness and ABV, but seriously, I dare you to try shotgunning one of these.  On second though, no I don't. This beer is too good to waste.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,kelticblood,4.14,"Poured into a Brandy snifter. The head was soapy and off-white and didn't have a long life. The color is a dark brown. Spotty traces of lacing are present. Very complex aroma with all sorts of stuff going on there including, hints of raisins, very sweet malts, hops, figs,and prunes. Evenly carbonated fizzy mouthfeel thats balanced with hops,bitterness, and malt. Alcohol is not well-hidden and easily noticed. Very sweet with a dry lingering bitterness. Full-bodied with a creamy texture. I'm going to let the rest warm up to room temperature see if any new flavors show themselves. As it warms I notice a strong Alcohol aroma and more Phenolic notes appear. The warmer it gets the more of the ABV is noticed and is really strong on the taste. All carbonation is gone and gives it the look of basically Brandy. Overall really good. It is worth trying again, but is not very drinkable due to the high ABV. I think one of these will be just fine for any session. Thanks Mitch for the fine offering.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Tan head that is relatively small but lasts a long time, more than most beers of the style, and does leave a nice lacing when it eventually goes. Smell starts with toffe and caramels, evolving into a yeasty smell, with alcohol hints and then back to malts, suagr, molasses and yeast again. Full-bodied and very satisfying in a single small bottle, the taste is as expected from the smell: sweetish and malty, with warming alcohol and mutiple bittery yeasts. I have to compare later to a large, corked bottle, and with less yeasts, but this is a very, very nice beer that deserves multiple repeats, although one at a time.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Here we go:  Poured out of a standard sized bottle into a St. Bernardus chalice, it pours with a fairly decent tan colored head. The head has a medium level of retention and mild lacing.  Look: A dark toffeish color, with a darkened center and gleams of ruby. This beer is cloudy and full of yeast chunks, which is to be expected. The head leaves interesting lacing patterns when tipped.  Aroma: Wow! Huge aroma on this beer, it smells of bread, yeast, sweet grapes, chocolate, and a touch of alcohol. Has a similar smell to the Rochefort 12 and a huge amount of depth.  Taste: Here's where this beer really excels. A big buttery, burnt toffee flavor mixed with sweet malts on the nose followed by hints of figs, plums, and grapes. The finish is layered with chocolate and licorice and a warming hit of alcohol. Wonderful.  Mouthfeel: This beer is smooth. syrupy. and slightly coating, but not too thick or heavy. The carbonation is mild and it has a pleasant overall mouthfeel.

259,1708,yelterdow,3.33,"750ml bottle corked and caged, with a code that reads L04 08 09 on the gold metal cap. Served in a Chimay chalice at cellar temperature. Paired with a chunk of English Stilton, brought to a few degrees of room temperature.  Appearance- Upon unravelling the wire cage, I grasp the cork to encounter a very willing release... a loud *pop* that releases some pressure and causes the beer to begin bubbling inside the bottle. Now, the pour...  It flows a light brown, with the beautiful audible *glug* from the depths of the bottle. As it slowly fills the glass, the creamy bone white head grows to just over two fingers... and stays there for a while as the lacing begins its sticking power. While the center of the beer is being replenished by the etched emblem inside the glass, the remaining head is patchy and broken up. A lovely quad indeed.  Smell- Sweet, sugar coated dates and figs with a spicy, boozy nose. I also get a yeasty aroma that offsets the malts just a bit... the resulting smell is a huge and complex display with an old world Belgian character.  Taste- A surprising, sharp beginning that carries with it loud effervescence... in the mouth, the sound is amped and is quite distracting. The fruity, malty, spicy palate is busy to say the least...  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- I am shocked at the unruly and disappointing mouthfeel of this beer... all judgement aside, this is not at all impressive. Much like Pop-Rocks candy, the beer crackles and bangs in the front of the mouth right from the start... removing all attention from the taste. With a gentle swish, the carbonation goes wild and subsequently flattens the texture to nothing in seconds. Worse, the air left in the mouth is gassy and cumbersome... making the swallow awkward and difficult. As with any high alcohol beer, there must be some balance with the ingredients to compensate for its strength. My ass is being kicked right about now with nothing positive to show for it.  A revisit is pending for this one... knowing full well that this has been a favorite of mine for years.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Aroma is dominated by nice fruity esters like cherry and plums. Slightly herbal note as well that's accented by a hint of alcohol sweetness. Flavor is a bit warm with alcohol, then allows some great malt sweetness to come through. Loads of chewy fruit flavors appear, and then a solid bitterness that seems to come from alcohol as much as it does hops. Slightly astringent as well.

Poured into a traditionally wide brimmed chalice with St. Bernardus branding on it. Thick, fluffy off white head sits upon a beautiful dark purple-ish red brew. Looks like frothy, carbonated prune juice. A few highlights are peeking through on the edges of the glass.  The aroma is full of herbal, spicy, fruity yeast on top of a strong malty sweetness. Dark fruits come to mind...such as prunes, figs and raisins. Alcohol is present throughout which gives it a sort of an elixir character. This could possibly cure some of your ailments!  What I noticed first was the body and mouthfeel. Oh so very smooth and creamy with an acute, prickly carbonation. A full, sweet, but non-overwhelming caramel malt flavor glides across the palate in a wonderful, almost what seems choreographed, manner. Strong clove presence mixed again with dark fruits, but also what I might describe as a Belgian candied apple (read candi sugar). The elixir character is enhanced with faint appearances of spice flavors that remind me of nutmeg and allspice. Slight alcohol presence, but deceptively hidden.

Fantastic appearance, with a solid brown color throughout. Sediment seems to be suspended in the somewhat viscous liquid.  Overall, Abt 12 lived up to my expectations.

The body color is a deep brown, tinged with garnet. The lacing is sticky enough to fall slowly in one thick curtain before leaving a line of bubbles on the glass. The aroma is quite typical for a dark, hefty Belgian ale: sweet, with dark fruits, but also hints of cocoa, and to a lesser extent, pipe tobacco. The taste is rich in maltiness and cocoa, but not as sweet as the nose might have indicated. The cocoa bits remind me of just the hints one can pick up in mole, but somewhat more intense. I love chocolate, and love finding it when I've given it up for Lent. There's a nice, strong cherry flavor that really comes through as it warms. Still, the flavor does not seem to be complex, just satisfying. It is clever for hiding its alcohol, though.

It is insanely complex on the palate, with cherry, red wine, rum, chocolate, molasses?, carob, caramel, apple, pear, melon rind?, banana?, orange?, currant, blackberry, anise (and maybe other spices). In addition, there are green/leafy, almost piney hops, a mild to medium bitterness, yeast, and an alcohol kick. The medium body is quite carbonated, lightly numbing and drying, with a medium to long finish. Overall a very complex and warming ale with a bit too much yeast due to insufficient decanting, but one well worth sampling again and again",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,SPLITGRIN,4.25,"With just a decent pour I got an amazing half beer, half head effect. Body is deep brownish black with only hints of light around the edges. Head is a nice staying tan, leaving slight lace as it fades. Nose is a vibrant sense awakening, fruity and floral while being strong and spicey bold. Amazingly silky as it first hits the tongue. Vanilla honey like smooth up front on the tongue with developing spicey wheat notes as the palate lengthens. The finish is a little darker and less balanced then the body pre-emps to. Alchol is well hidden but does warm the belly well. Avery classic brew.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,TheSarge,4.14,"Abt 12 pours to produce a beautiful thick khaki colored head, which sticks around for a while, and eventually forms into clumps the rest of the way through. The body of this brew is a dark caramel color with slight reddish hues.  This gives off aromas of molasses and slight floral fragrances. The taste is astounding. It has a maple and bubble gum characteristic and feels slightly acidy, but not over powering.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,chrhowe,4.83,"This is the 2nd time I've tried this beer. The first, about a year and a half ago, took me by suprise(due to an immature palate). However, the second time around is very pleasant and relaxing. I poored this beer into a new St. Bernardus chalice just shipped in from Merchant du Vin. The appearance was of dark, thick color. Almost ""muddy"". The smell, especially toward the end was mostly carmel. Taste was exceptional, quite a bit more smooth than what I remembered. For me, its hard to describe further, but I could enjoy it just about everyday if my budget would allow. Overall, one of my favorites. I'm pretty new the the whole ""beer connisuer"" thing(sorry if misspelled), but hopefully it will remain toward the top of my list.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,trevorwideman,4.62,"330ml bottle poured into a chalice. Thanks to fisherman34 for this one, I can't get it anywhere around here.  Pours thick and dark, nearly black with a lilac tinge when held to the light. Lots of sediment in there. 1/2 inch head that subsides to a lovely lacing that's just a bit more than average. Intense aromas of ripe dark fruits and strong red wine. There's a healthy malt backbone here that provides a nice caramel sweetness to the deal. Fresh baked banana-walnut bread with melted butter, and so many spices! Coriander, cloves, anise, vanilla bean, and nutmeg to name a few.  Taste is just as gorgeous as the nose, extremely rich and very sippable. The fruit is complimented by all that bready yeast and one can only describe this as drinking liquid dessert, but a dessert that is never too sweet. There is a definite light tartness in the finish to balance things off. Caramel, spices, raisins and other dried fruits all appear, and as this one warms the complexity just grows. This is a superb brew that demands respect in every sip, and I give it that. Thick with malt in the mouth with a carbonation that rather seizes the tongue. This one is extremely sippable, but not chuggable that's forsure. Warms your core on a cold night. Exceptional brew that would only get better if I had one more to cellar.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,paleoplant,4.18,"Great color and look, the nose is pleasant, high carbonation, not overrun with sugars or alcohol. Paired well with bittersweet chocolate and cheese.

259,1708,Reinheitsgebot71,3.85,"had this one again at the beer bistro and had high hope for it due to all the praise it gets.  A: Large 3 finger head very nice; thick dark caramel in colour, Dark opaque body looks very appetizing. Plenty of lace to go round as well.  B: Bananas, fresh toffee, cinnamon, and most prevalent of all the alcohol.  T: Strong alcoholic taste is what hit me off the bat followed by slightly burnt caramel, light maltiness with a surprisingly prevalent hoppy bitterness. The alcoholic taste mellows out as you drink on, phased out by more of the burnt caramel flavour with hints of allspice. Candied sugar with a bit of peppery spice finish this one off.  M: It is very smooth but the taste of the alcohol makes for a few rough patches here and there.  D: Overall it didn't quite live up to the hype for me but still quite a good beer, I'm willing to give it another go. But don't be put off it is definitely very tasty I just wish there wasnt such a strong alcoholic presence.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,MCDuhamel,4.73,"I should come clean at the outset and disclose that this is one of my favorite beers. I poured it from an 11.2 oz bottle into a 33cl Westmalle chalice. The bottle spent 24 hours in the fridge, and then 45 minutes at room temperature before I poured it.  A. Pours a very dark ruby, almost brown. Translucent; not quite opaque. Farily large, pillowy head, with large-ish bubbles. The head laces down the chalice as the beer is consumed.  S. The nose is surprisingly restrained, even a bit muted. Light bread and burnt sugar notes. None of the usual phenolic qualities from a Belgian yeast strain. Appropriately for the style, no hops on the nose whatsoever.  T. Carmelized sugar predominates, with a slight boozy warmth. It is definitely a malt-forward beer, but not at all imbalanced. A slight prickle picks up mid way through and yields to a dry finish. Truly outstanding.  M. One might expect a heavy, even viscous beer. Surprise! This is light to medium-light on the tongue.  D. Dangerously drinkable. I feel like I could have several, but that would be quite intemperate given its 10% abv.  Overall. If you have never had a quad, this is the one to try.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,petemoss14,4.62,"330cl bottle, freshness date: Oct. 4, 2010.  Pours a deep chestnut with ruby highlights and a medium tan fluffy head that doesn't budge.  Wonderful, estery aroma of dark fruit -- raisins, plums, dark cherry, and a touch of alcohol spice. Port-like. Man, I can't stop sticking my nose into the balloon-like St. Bernardus goblet. And that had hasn't diminished one bit!  ooo-eeee. Delicious! Ripe dark fruit rolls across the tongue. Vinous. Moderate bitterness in a medium dry finish. Nice alcohol warming. Medium to medium-full body with a velvety smoothness.  Wow. Had this beer many times in all its incarnations and always really enjoyed it. But until reviewing it, I hadn't given it much ""love"" in awhile. Man, this is a great beer. One of my absolute favs. How does it compare to Westy 12, well, I'll save that for another day",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Enola,3.38,"This beer is better than the Triple but not as good as the 8 in my opinion. The beer is a deep mahogany with a fair head. The smell is of prunes and cherries. The taste is a little sharp for me. There is a alcohol presence in the mouthfeel. The drinkanbility is fair, but not as good as the 8. I will re-try this one in the future but I think the 8 is the brewers best.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,vanrassel,4.23,"This is a beer worthy of its lofty reputation, even if it's not one I have fallen in love with.  It poured deep mahogany into my goblet, with a one-finger head that mushroomed over the rim. It left beautiful sheets of lace on the sides. The aroma was a little more one-dimensionally alcoholic than I anticipated, though there were hints of yeast, sugar and dried fruit.  The subtleties absent in the smell emerged in the taste: brown sugar, semi-sweet cocoa, rum, blackcurrants and raisins. It ended dry and roasty with a medium body and creamy mouthfeel.  It may be crass to compare, but I prefer Rochefort 10 and consider it more complex than this beer.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,joeskirkie,3.94,"A slow pour from the 750 mL bottle into my St. Bernardus chalice yields an opaque brown body with amber hints on the edges. The head is thumb width and looks a bubbly biege laced with a white halo on top, it's pretty damn cool.  It's mostly a pleasant yeast aroma, with subtle hints of fruit and raisons if you smell hard enough.  Smooth malts at first, followed quickly by a sweet rasiny flavor which is quickly envolped by a spicy finish, with some sugary sweetness lingering.  If you're a fan of Belgian ales, as I am, you'll really dig this brew. Smooth at first, spicy on the finish, it's a winner. I'm certainly glad I have a big bottle to finish.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,dnichols,4.43,Pours a dark rich amber with an off white head that lingers and clings to the side of the glass as the beer is consumed. It has hints of molasses and raisins and the smooth consistency is spiked with chunks of yeast. The aroma is a bold roasted malty sweetness that pleases without being overpowering. It is lightly carbonated giving it a crispness that dissipates after the beer settles giving the beer a smooth finish.,Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,wanker,4.55,"Incredibly delicious. Quite sweet, not hoppy at all.  The alcohol is completely hidden at out-of-the-fridge temperatures, so can easily get ripped on this one. Even as the beer warmed, I hardly noticed the alcohol.  If you don't want to finish a 750ml bottle at one sitting, don't worry -- the carbonation lasts at least 3 days if you stick a cork back in the bottle.  It took a lot of will power for me to stop after a moderate amount. It is so tasty and goes down so easily that I could have easily drunk myself to a brutal hangover.

This dark oak liquid of the Gods has a foamy pillow-top of head to spare. Laces everywhere. Superb.  Bourbon cherry malt in the aroma and quaff  but much more deep and intense than most Belgium ales. A big blast of candied fruits just add to the enjoyment. Just a smidgen, a tiny smidge hot with alcohol.  I sip on this critter, but find my hand quickly returns for another. At $3.50 for the 33cl, not overpriced either.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

T: Enters with a malt sweetness across the palate (delicious!) segueing into a slight bitterness, then to a dry finish that lingers ever so delicately. A spicy tinge in the middle makes for an array of great tastes.  M: Excellent carbonation, flavor presence, and finish. A crispness is present that makes it absolutely delightful.  D: Great complexity and balance. The mouthfeel is near perfect, and it also speaks for the satisfying start to the smooth finish of this beer.

A: The beer is a deep dark brown color, with a short beige head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.  S: The aroma is of yeast, roasted malt, chocolate and a touch of dark fruits.  T: Taste is very-well balanced with flavors of yeast, chocolate, caramelized malt and dark fruits. No one flavor takes dominance. There is a slight hops bitterness in the background. The high ABV is extremely well-hidden.  M: Very smooth, medium body, light-to-medium carbonation, finish is clean.

Smell of soft fruit; over ripe banana, raisin, plum and touch of passion fruit. The malts give a sweetness to the nose, a bit sticky. I love it. Taste; mostly earthy flavors. Dark plum, soft wood and leather. As strange as that sounds, it is wonderful. The alcohol is nicely hidden. Very good feel to it, makes drinking it very easy.

Dissipated quickly though, and the aroma was then black cherries and chocolate. Taste is chocolate, caramel, plums at first, then that sour black cherry at the back of the tongue. Finishes crisply with a toffee-like aftertaste. Mouthfeel is highly carbonated, silky and downright wonderful. The drinkability is up in the dangerous range, as the 10% abv is hidden well.

Allowed to warm significantly and served this time in my Tulip Glass.  Appearance: Pours a dark opaque mahogany color with a huge tan head that simply refuses to recede and plastering lace that coats the entire glass.  Smell: Very vinous. Dark purple grape, port, fig smoky caramel, a touch of something pleasantly medicinal like a lozenge with the yeast character, bread, cocoa, plum and booze. OH HELL YEAH! this beer is a sniffer for sure.  Taste: This is certainly a display of character depth in beer wow. Chocolaty, bready malt with licorice vanilla rum, then grapes and a buttery phenol flavor as well. Suggestions of nuts and toasted brown sugar fish off followed by a boozy vanilla aftertaste that sticks with me long after the beer gone from my mouth.  Mouthfeel: Exceptionally smooth and just barely chewy with a creamy full body that is well  magnificent in the mouth.  Drinkability: Though it goes down with remarkable ease the last thing I want to do is drink this all night. I think I'd like to go to bed now my day cannot get better =)  Hope this is helpful.

It's just not the same when you try it in the bottle. Still good, but not the same.  The Abt 12 exhibited the expected brownish-red hue and was one of the most carbonated beers I've ever encountered, even for a Belgian Quad. Appearance is perfect to style. The smell is inviting with sweet, roasted malts and dark fruits. The taste follows suit, but woa, there was a flavor explosion here I wasn't expecting. The dark fruits hinted at in the nose came to life, now accompanied by dark candi sugar. The complexity here is astounding; it's like a feast of sweet malt, fruit, and candy. Some might describe it as overly sweet. Mouthfeel is of course quite bubbly, but with a nice texture that prevents you from confusing this with a Coca-cola. As several other reviewers have pointed out, the alcohol is VERY well masked here, truly the touch of a master brewer. I could drink this all night on draft.

A thick, tanned head comes out from the pour and maintains a good 1/4"". Leaves thick and raised lacing. Smell is candy-sweet, fruity, spicy, and a bit alcoholic. Aromas are a bit too faint for a beer of this size, and the booze is too prominent. Flavor is very much like grape soda with some roasted malt. There is a slight estery and phenolic hit, but the sweetness runs this. Gets way too sweet as it warms. Mouthfeel is actually kind of thin and starts off rather prickly, but then subsides to a smoother carbonation. This is drinkable enough, but doesn't really do it for me.

Quite sweet, but not cloyingly so. A very complex potpourri of tastes coming through to the palate -- brown sugar, cloves, candied sugar, cherries, dark plums.... with a warming, pleasant and not overly harsh flavor of alcohol. Felt velvety smooth in the mouth and would be great to spend an evening sipping a couple of these.  One of the best I've ever had. In fact, I really can't think of a beer that I've enjoyed more. Just the epitome of what I think of when I rave about Belgian ales. Top of the line.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,tcfishler,3.98,"Dark, dull brown with a large tan head, which is notable for its very fine texture. However, the head is not very sticky.  Sweet but fresh nose of fruit (including banana) and spice.  Heavy carbonation enlivens the moderately heavy, round mouthfeel. Clove is more apparent on the palate than the nose. Alcohol is there to be sensed but not sharp by any means.  Rich but not astoundingly complex.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,thesilverhand,4.69,"Deep, cloudy ruddy brown, nearly opaque. Lots of suspended yeast, and topped with a frothy crema.  Richly spicy. Reminds me of Christmas pudding, with dark yeastiness and dried fruits. Fantastic.  More subtle than I expected. Nicely layered malt and spice, with hints of dried fruits and caramel sweetness leading into a dry bitter finish. Alcohol is apparent, but not aggressive.  Very lively on the palate, which keeps it light despite its richness. Very dry.  Awesome.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,GregBrewski,3.88,"A nice presentation, with a deep dark brown color and a thick tan fluffy head, which left little lacing. A nose of sweet malt, mainly fruity and alcohol notes, some hints of caramel and roasted barley. Its a sweet, malty pronounced brew with the alcohol leading in heavily when displaced onto the palate. It has a medium to light feel, with crispiness in the front. The qualities of this brew improve greatly as it warms up. I wasnt very impressed when it was cold, but is slowly became more enjoyable.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,MVassar,3.92,"My first experience with this beer was dreadful: three spoiled bottles in a row. All had been refrigerated at the same reputable store, but clearly something was wrong with them.  This tasting of a bottle from a different store was more successful.  Somewhat dirty, cloudy brown with an ample yet short-lived head. Tiny bubbles, minimal lacing.  Plenty of brown bread in the nose, with some sweet malt, a touch of raw sugar, even a hint of banana bread.  Tastes of Christmas spices, malt, and a touch of dark fruit. Not as much depth as I would have hoped, but tasty stuff nonetheless.  Medium to full bodied, creamy texture, with too much carbonation.  Nicely balanced beer. Nothing extraordinary, but certainly quite drinkable.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,warmstorage,3.53,"11.2 ounce bottle, states 10% ABV. Bottle has date of 22/03/11, which I take to be a ""best before"" date. Cellar temp, Chimay goblet.  Pours a vigorous head, dense white-cream colored, which goes away rapidly, leaves minimal lacing. For a Belgian beer, the inability to hold a decent head, even in a high gravity beer, is a little disappointing.  Aroma is deeply yeasty, slightly spicy, with hints of fruit. A very slight metallic note comes out, especially as it warms to room temperature.  Taste is also very yeasty, with burnt sugar, figs, and a very slight hint of spiciness. Alcohol is barely noticeable, especially for a 10% beer.  Mouth is tingly carbonation, with a little alcohol warmth.  Nice, pleasant, warming, and good Belgian yeast characteristics: an excellent beer, and one I'll continue to drink regularly (as regularly as I can get my hands on it, that is.) But BA's highest rated quad, and the 14th overall beer on the site? I don't really see it.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Sweet. Alcohol is upfont in the flavor profile. Some sweetness, and a mash of toffee and fruit. Very easy drinking palate. Soft texture all the way through. Velvet. This particualr bottle is very young. I beleive the date is 030310. Im sure it ages very well, but as rated today, not one of my faves.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,dfried,4.35,"You know you have a good beer when the cork unexpetedly pops off about a minute after you remove the twisted wires holding it on, beer and head rolling down the side. This one wanted to get drank, and I felt compelled to comply.  Dark in color, a lot of plum colored violet and red highlights at the bottom and edges, large foamy off white head. Deep fruity aroma, plums, raisins, grapes. Of course some bready Belgian yeast, a bit of molasses, and some fairly detectable alcohol but not over whelming. Alcohol is pretty apparent in the taste as well, but it's smooth and warming, not sharp. Sweet and fruity flavors glore, plums and raspberries. Maybe some hops, citric and resinous, but overshadowed by the malt. Full bodied malty beer.  Verdict: awesome. I noticed the alcohol a bit more than in some, but the flavors were great and right on par.

S - great Belgian yeast aroma of candy sugar, bubble gum, clove, pineapple, pepper. Little hop aroma of noble spice, along with tangy wheat malt aroma. Significant alcohol presence.  T - tangy, slightly sweet malt followed by great Belgian flavors of spice, sweet exotic fruits, candy sugar. Lots of complex flavors bouncing around. Fruits, spices, mixed with slight noble hop metallic flavor and sweet wheat malt and grainy pilsner.  M - carbonation slightly above average, light, fresh mouthfeel. Warming alcohol.

A pop-cork top what fun!  Tremendously large head, fluffy and light yellow. Moderate retention. Nice lace. Dark reddish brown, completely opaque.  Dark fruity malt aroma dominates. Almost smells like very ripe grapes or lightly like apples. Sweet and thick/sticky. Butterscotch notes to the sweetness.  Thick and rich malt flavors. Flowery bouquet. Alcohol present. Nice ripe fruity flavors, soft and juicy like grape (mildly apple)  not so much raisin-like. Alcohol pokes out in the post-swallow.  Very nice oral foamation, thick and creamy in the mouth. Mild carbonation on the tongue. Smooth and thick, rich and chewy. Ive swallowed a good amount of carbonation.  Very low bitterness, hop contribution minimal. Nectar sweet chewy malt backbone with floral hoppage and heightened alcohol. Nicely balanced. The more I have the more I like. This really is a simple (and good) beer. I like it, Ill try it again. Definitely not a waste of a try, despite the price.  Final Notes: I can feel Abt 12 work its alcoholic magic on me. So rich, so thick. My stomach hurts with joy. I wonder if the anniversary brew is worth trying?",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,rayjay,4.53,"BB 22 03 11  Pours brown with reddish-purple highlights. The head is stained red like a Kriek beer.  The nose reminds me of Smarties candies.  How do they cram all that flavor into a beer and still have it come off so subtle? Unbelievable. There are malts galore, bringing along visions of figs, plums, persimmons, cherry candy, there's that ultra-fresh dopplebock vibe, and a porter-like fallout. All flavors melt together perfectly.  The mouthfeel is very refreshing and soft as water. No chalkiness or tongue-coating here. Subtle carbonation. Drinkability is dangerously high; gentle heat is the only hint of alcohol (my previous beer was 7% and felt hotter!) This is a genuine piece of fine art.

259,1708,SacoDeToro,3.97,"Sampled side-by-side with Rochefort 10 and Westvleteren 12.  The beer poured a rich and slightly hazy brown with a small tan head that quickly turned to lace.  The aroma of the beer was that of dark sugars, raisins, and figs, all carried up to your nose by the volatile 10.5% alcohol. The aroma had nice fruity and phenolic sters.  The flavor of the beer had a rich sweet maltiness with many accents of dried fruits, such the aforementioned raisins and figs. The hops were there enough to balance things out. The beer was also very creamy and smooth. It was however, just a tad sweet.  The mouthfeel of the beer was medium and not too heavy. The carbonation was high and tight  Overall, a very impressive beer from a modest monastery.  Having sampled it along side the Rochefort 10, and Westy 12, I actually liked the Rochefort best. To me, the Rochefort seemed to have a little more depth and richness than the Westy and St. Bernardus.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Head starts about a finger's width and maintains a tight lace. A half-dollar sized cap of foam floats in the center. Smell is slightly spicy, with some toffee notes. Taste is fantastic. Warm toffee flavor that finishes with a coffee bitterness. Slight dried fruit notes. Mouthfeel is lighter than what I expected, though completely satisfying. Mild alcohol warmth.

259,1708,SetarconeX,4.6,"Near as I can tell, this is something of the flagship of the St. Bernardus brand, and for good reason. This is the fourth of their beers I've tried, and it is clearly the best, which is saying something because the others were pretty near to perfect.  Very deep reddish brown color, with a hefty froth up top. Tastes exactly the same way it smells, only even more so. Aroma and taste of malt, raisins, chocolate, nutmeg, cane sugar....in short, a lot of different flavors.  If, as Ben Franklin claimed, beer was proof that God loves us and wants to be happy, than this is him showing us how good beer can be.

There is moderate carbonation activity from within the beer visible at the outer edges of the glass.  Smell: Super rich toasted malt up front with some cinnamon & clove. Slightly sweet, brown sugar, caramel, very floral, and somewhat herbal hops on the nose as well. Actually a little more sweet than the regular on tap I had just the night before.  Taste: The taste is of sweet, complex maltiness. Hop bitterness is low, but enough to keep the sweetness from being cloying. Little bit of alcohol on the tip of the tounge. Very full bodied and herbal.  Drinkability: Very easy to drink, excellent lingering of flavors in the mouth. A pleasant warming develops on subsequent pours into the goblet. Insanely drinkable.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Appearance is a luscious dark raisin/prune juice color and has a slight head and carbonation ring.  Smell is of delicious dark fruit/heavy brandy and whets my desire to sup.  Taste is very good, has many levels of flavors, high amount of sweetness but it does not upset the drinkability. Usual raisin, brown sugar notes for the style.  Mouthfeel is nice - carbonation is light but perfect for the beer. Silky and velvety, coats the mouth and tongue with its complexity.  Drinkability is very good but not sure if I could have more than one bottle in a sitting - rated the beer on one bottle per session.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Caramelt malt in nose, but not much else. Hard to smell, but the DIPA I had before this may have blew out my smeller. Big malt and spice in the taste. Very good, but I'll stick with La Trappe.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Not picking up much flavor. Alcohol is noticeable.  The initial taste impression is of strong malty sweetness. This is much sweeter than I had anticipated. Sherry-like character. Not much hop flavor in forefront. The alcohol is not masked at all by the flavor and the carbonation is more than I would expect from a drink with this amount of body.  I'm a bit dissapointed with the lack of hop character but overall very pleased. The acidity is a bit much for me and it finishes like a Merlot. I'll see what the second year of rest does.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Umbra,4.3,"Enjoyed via the bottle during yesterday's successful tailgate. Poors a woodsy brown with reddish highlights. Tan light head with nice lacing and incredible retention. Fruity bready nose comes through in the flavor as well. May have been some choco bits in there. Tingly carbonation, but smooth and creamy on the mouth. Slight warmth comes through and the ETOH becomes more pronounced as it warms. Way too drinkable for a quad.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Aroma is nice malty and fruity nice brown sugar aromas covering figs and apples. Good relaxed inviting smells going on very enjoyable.  Taste is malty dark fruits raisins, plums, figs mixed with nice sweet brown sugars. Mellow spice vanilla hints mixed with cloves that linger. Some hints of alcohol but they blend well into the flavor. Taste is good maybe better the 4.0 but mouthfeel cuts into the taste score.  Mouthfeel is not as smooth and creamy as the Westy 12, little too much fizz on this one for my tastes but it does mellow some as it sits. Of course thats my biggest complaint about most quads.  Drinkability is good, enjoyable flavors but not a sub for Westy 12 as some claim. Might have rated this one higher but hard to do after having the best. Maybe the 60th Anniv will be better.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Aromas are deep and richly fruity - very dark and soft - sweet and lightly bready with a bit of spice. Taste is equally as soft but very layered...malty, rich, and smooth with a dark, raisin-like fruitiness. A woody hint here and there. Dry, fruity, near-musty yeast quality. Creamy mouthfeel floats around easily in the mouth.  A very soft, complex, delicious ale. Let it warm up to get the best experience.

So thorough; layered but blended with a large range of flavors. No off flavors to distract, a perfect moderate but champagne like carbonation, and a warming alcohol touch.

Smell- Ounce poured it had a rich aroma, a hint of maple syrup to it. This sweetness gives it the disguise that you cant tell really the strength of this brew.  Taste- The foamy lace its what first touches your tongue, then comes the sweet tastes like the maple smell. The alcohol becomes more apparent as you drink this brew. Definitely no words to describe how nice it was to drink this excellent brew with my father and brother over the football game.  Mouthfeel- Definitely a full-bodied beer with a good character depth. Easy to taste and definitely satisfied a thirsty palate.  Drinkability- Pure taste that didn't let me down. Great Brew overall.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Light tan, creamy looking, and composed of tiny bubbles.  S: Bready up front, with some dried fruit (cherries, figs, tangy cranberries) and some spice (clove, cinnamon). This has a lot going on.  T/M: Malty up front in the form of a nice, warm breadiness (fresh-baked bread) and some sweet, fruity malt. Bit of a vinousness in the middle, with some dates and figs. Finish has a hint of alcohol (I can only assume this mellows as it ages; this is a pretty fresh bottle, ~6 months old), some chocolate, toffee, and a rumminess. Very warming.

Dark copper body with faint head, much like a homemade sun tea without the foam. In all honesty, this beer is very reminiscent of a Long Island, with cider-esque notes. Thick and somewhat chewy, this would go well with a hearty meal, with the striking ability to clean the palate with carbonation. Right now, I'm not eating, so it's only very good.

Smell is quite syrupy, high sweet malt liquor aroma.  Wow, this is sweet. Reminds me of a brandy or port flavor, along with thickness. Fruits involved must be dark like raisin, prunes, dates. A heavy aftertaste that burns your nose as you breath out. There is also a mellow caramel smoothness that is enjoyable.  This can be a tough beer to be drinkable. It's very strong in liquor and sweetness. For its strength I consider it quite drinkable. There are no negative flavors, bitterness, or harshness.

It started out great, with a dark brown color and fluffy tan head. Smelled great, with lots of dried fruit aromas, mostly raisin and prunes.  The taste was disappointing. Thought the caramel malt flavor dominated too much and did not notice any fruitiness or sweetness to the flavor. Stronger alcohol presence but that was somewhat expected, given the ABV.  Thought it was full-bodied and somewhat silky on the tongue, but the drinkability was awful. I could not finish it.

259,1708,BigRedN,4.44,"From Notes. Final beer consumed on trip to Fort Worth, TX. I had contemplated whether or not to purchase this as I didn't really have the proper glassware for it but thought, When am I ever going to have another chance again?  Appearance: Poured from a corked and cages 750 into a red wine glass. The beer is a dark amber, becoming a dark ruby red when held to the light. A nice 1/2 inch head forms, leaves good lacing.  Smell: A bit bready malt at first whiff, becoming a little yeasty as it warms. Some caramel malt heare, dark fruits (plum, fig, prune) as well. A touch earthy (musty?). Almost wine or brandy like, very complex. Aromas typically associated with hops aren't overtly present.  Taste: Much like the smell, this is a nicely complex beer, truely one to share with a big wine buff. If taste is tied to smell, this beer helps to prove it for me. I am assaulted by a chewy biscuity taste followed by the dark fruits and slightly rasted caramels. Bitterness is kept to the back, just a touch bitter on the finish.  Mouthfeel: Lightly carbonated, a little heavy. I would call this full in body, robust. A bit chewy, warms my throat and chest (the alcohol I would guess) as it slides down.  Drinkability: A nice warming beer, as close to wine as any beer I have had. Stands up well to the hype. I doubt that this is a beer I would have often, but if it was available to me it would be nice to have once in a while, just to truely enjoy a good beer.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

The head is long-lasting, light tan, and sticks to the side of the glass like super glue. The smell -- oh yum. Beers like these take beer to a whole new level. Spicy, sweet, a bit of malty roastyness. Alcohol is quite obvious, too However, in the taste, the alcohol is barely noticable. Tons of sweet (but not too sweet maltmake up the start of the taste, followed by the dark fruit taste that you hope for in a good Belgian. Then the alcohol comes through as a bit of tartness at the end. Nice and complex. Some people say this is better than Westvleteren. I don't agree. It's damn good in its own right, but they're totally different beers. Mouthfeel is charged with CO2, not as creamy as some Belgians.

Looks special :D  Smells of rum soaked raisins, tart plum, chocolate, caramel, and alcohol. It smells thick if that makes any sense!  The first sip filled my mouth with rich malt, lots of dark fruits as the nose hinted: dark cherry, plum, raisin, lots of buttery essences, very sweet with a slight bitter hop aftertaste. This is followed by slight alcohol bitterness.  Mouthfeel is velvety smooth. The beer glides on a tight layer of bubbles and fills the mouth easily. Dangerously drinkable as well.  In the past the samples of this that I have had from the bottle have been dominated a little too much by the alcohol, while on tap versions have been a little on the sweet side. This is the best I have had of this variety to date, and I think the beer's temperature played a big part. do not serve this too cold!

It was colored lighter than I expected, but was very beautiful.  Smell: Not as pronounced as other quads, I picked up some fruityness (apples and raisons) and some brown sugar.  Taste: Again the apple and the brown sugar dominate, with a possibility of cinnamon. There was a slight breadiness to the brew too, but only after warming for awhile.  Mouthfeel: Thin to medium bodied... it was actually thinner than I was hoping for. It coated the palate nicely.  Drinkability: There are more drinkable quads out there, and I probably won't have this one again. But given a choice between this and 99% of other beers in the world...

Take a nice drink and hold it in your mouth to truely appreciate the sweetness of the fruit tones in this one. Not quite as good a finish maybe if cellered longer the carbonation would be higher and finsh it off a little better but I still give it a 5 just for the complexity of it all.  very nice and a good beer to give as a gift instead of wine for the holidays this year.  Everyone enjoy!",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,uberabr,4.62,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip. I would prefer to drink this type of beer from an oversized wine glass, but have had trouble distinguishing smells with the St. Bernardus brews in thick, wide glasses.  A: A unique, solid, milk-chocolate brown . A slight red hue but mostly the murky candy brown. Head is light and fluffy but recedes relatively fast. Settles with good, lasting lace.  S: Fruity banana with some citrus, a little bit of grapefruit. There's a very unique, sweet peanut-brittle effect. Very peppery, and a slight sourdough with lingering vanilla. A little bit of hop, and the malt comes through a tad too. Overall, not extremely powerful or unique but pleasant and refined.  T: Crisp and warming. A spicey, roasted caramel malt. A buttery, apricot, frosted lemon-cake taste. Sweet and a little sour with a definite roasted, peppery bite and a sugary, popcorn-jelly belly type sweetness. It has the distinct Belgian maltyness but all in all the 10% is masked very well; a classy take on what could be an offensive maltiness. Not a lot of bitterness either. Very well done but confident (It's easier to use anthropomorphisms with American ales, but oh well). I rarely rate taste higher than smell with beers of this quality, but this one does it.  M: Goes down real easy, a mouth-watering effect. Well carbonated, moderate body, and sugary aftertaste.  D: This is a very quaffable Belgian. Extremely smooth for such a stong beer. Sweet all the way down. Very nice.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

259,1708,Onibubba,4.52,"My first quad, my first St Bernardus. Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Duvel tulip. Not totally sold on the appearance. Looks like cola. Tiny bubbles rising to the surface look nice though. Not much head to speak of, and what there is dissipates into a nice lacing fairly quickly.  Smell is not my best sense. hard to tell what I am picking up here: Dark fruits, a bit of roastiness, and alcohol for sure. I like what I smell though.  Taste. Not sure what the big deal about this beer is. Small sips...Not bad, but not super. Let it sit a while. Hmmm...Not sure what I was thinking. This is nice. Figs. I see what the problem was. I started too cold, out of the fridge. Definately needs time to warm up to bring the flavors out. Bigger sips. Still trying to wrap my head around all the tastes, and then, before I know it, it's gone.  Mouthfeel was a bit light/flat, but supported by a bit of carbonation. All in all, very quaffable. The alcohol is high, but well hidden in the taste. A 12 oz bottle is simply not enough. I'll be buying this in 750s from here out.  Remember that scene in ""Young Frankenstein"" where the monster is grasping for the notes of the violin? That's what I felt like as I was drinking this toward the end - Grasping for something beautiful that I could not comprehend. A lovely experience that I look forward to repeating.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,pmcadamis,4.97,"Had this at Crane Alley in Urbana IL, served in an orval chalice. This one pours a murky dirty brown with absolutely no trace of a head. Although I like the drunk monk on the bottle, this really isn't an appealing beer. One of the girls in my party even went so far as to say it looks like sewage water....but I think that's a little harsh. Maybe more like river water.  The smell is rife with ethanol, and I smell nice clean malts and a firm hop presence. A bit weedy, outdoorsy, and fresh smelling, but warmly malted also. I smell ripe dark fruits...maybe plum and sweet grapes.  There is something very grapey and vinous about this one. I love the rich warmth provided by the full malts and alcohol heat, and the nice dose of hops was unexpected but welcomed. This is really a slow sipper, and gets much more flavorfull as it warms. With time, malty caramel and brown sugar come out to play, and eventually become the dominant flavor (the hops are more evident at first when the brew was still cold. This came to me pretty damn chilly from behind the bar, but I would like to see this served at room temp.  Mouthfeel is excellent and the nice finish left me clucking my tongue to get avery last bit of flavor. This really is an excellent brew, and the big alcohol warmth is a pleasant quality...like drinking brandy from a snifter.

Bubbly with nice retention. Wonderful frost-like lace. S: Dark fruit malt and fig notes. Nice wheat and yeasty blend. Slighly spicy. T/M: Dark fruit malt with a good infusion of grape and fig sweetness. Big, bold, and rich with a good malty profile. Nice background of yeastyness that lingers on the palate and turns sweet. Spicyness gets a bit caught up with the carbonation. Very smooth and extra silky on the palate--slides across on the way down. Very nice mouthfeel. A full bodied quad. Sweetness becomes subdued as it warms wit the spicyness and malt taking more of a dominant role. D: One of the best quads I've had. I would definately buy this again when I see it--possibly to cellar a few. One tasty brew.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,dblinkhorn,4.77,"Poured from an 11.2 oz bottle into a St. Bernardus chalice.  Appearance - Pours with a creamy two-finger head that is slightly tan in color. It retains well, and leaves superb lacing all the way down the glass. The beer is very murky and is brownish copper in color.  Smell - Fruity and floral hops notes on the nose. Cherry, plum, fig, and host of other dark ripe fruits are evident. A strong peppery spice aroma also hits you right away. A rich bready malt character ties it all together nicely. There is an obvious alcohol presense on the nose, but we'll see how it holds up in the taste...  Taste - Peppery spiciness up front, with lots of the aforementioned fruit flavors and obvious floral/herbal flavors. A hugely rich malt flavor that is bready and doughy is present as a foundation. The finish has some sweetness to it and with pronounced alcohol character and spice. This transforms to the aftertaste which consists mainly of a very slight earthiness from the yeast and a rich flavor from the malt.  Mouthfeel - Medium-bodied and seductively smooth. The carbonation creates a very satisfying feeling in the mouth. There is no bite whatsoever, just a gentle massage from the carbonation.  Drinkability - Having the Three Philosophers last night, this stuff actually seems to have a bit less powerful flavors, but I think superior in their character and the pleasant mixture of the different flavors. Still, this is a powerful brew, and expect very strong flavors from it.  This is an extremely high quality brew from St. Bernardus. Definitely my favorite of their year-round brews. The flavors are fantastically pronounced and work to complement eachother. This is a MUST have beer.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Taste is robust and complex. Begins with some hops and malt onto a slight bitterness, finishes with notes of apples and a welcome alcohol warmth. This is a delicious beer, I could drink these endlessly if one didn't already make me feel it's strength. This is an amazing beer I will definitely buy more.

It had a yeasty aroma, with plenty of dark fruits. A complex taste. It had a strong malt presence, but the dark fruit came through, as well as a nice caramel flavor. It was pleasantly carbonated.

259,1708,soulgrowl,4.39,"Appearance: Thick, opaque, earthy brown. Held up to the light, dark flecks of sediment are visible against a Bengal glow, floating peacefully in perfect equilibrium. Head is unexpectedly modest, the color of a cafe latte with below average retention.  Smell: Fresh hazelnuts, almonds, Brazils, and chestnuts are the first thing I notice. Soon, these are upstaged by tart red wine and dark fruit notes such as raisins, prunes, and dates with an interesting cola-like undertone. On top of all this is a current of sweet caramel, chocolate, and ripe bananas. An extremely harmonious nose; everything is in its place, and every individual aroma compliments the others perfectly.  Taste: Mind-bendingly subtle and complex. Quite vinous, with a red wine-like dry-yet-fruity robustness. Nutty, doughy and yeasty, reminiscent of German dark wheat bread. Spicy and a bit tangy from the yeast and alcohol, which counteract the devastating malts nicely. Caramel is quite prominent. Very tasty and very potent.  Mouthfeel: Creamy and full-bodied, but it can become quite heavy and cloying.  Drinkability: Definitely something to savor slowly and respect. Very drinkable; not at all chuggable. I can't say for sure, but this would probably be a very versatile beer for food pairing; I can imagine it working well with both cheesecake and beef tenderloin.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Head is a few inches thick, and one has to wait for it to dissipate before filling the glass more or drinking. Tastes sweet, somewhat dark fruity. Good level of carbonation but not overly so like some Belgian style ales. Very very very well balanced. You can hardly tell that this is 10.5% alcohol.

Little bitter twinge left on the tongue, but an overall sweet taste in the mouth. Alcohol really apparent.  M- Smooth, peppery, and balanced. Nice, not too thin despite the ton of alcohol.

Very warm alcohol bite with thick, sweet, toffee and molasses malt, followed by subtle fruits and nuts, and finishes with spice and chocolate.

The color is so dark I had to hold it up to a light and saw alot of debris floating around,so pour carefully people. The smell is extremely pungent, as soon as the cap was off the aroma filled the room. Dark fruit, brown sugar, nuts, and alittle chocolate. The taste is much like the smell. Full of dark fruit, raisins, prunes, alcohol, a nutty chewiness, and a rich ""bisquity"" flavor. The m/f is medium with a rich creaminess that hides the alcohol and mellows the dark fruit.

Nuts (slightly sherryish), spice, fudge, earth, dates, raisins, grass/herbs/green tea. Elements that I can't describe, and continuously changing in the glass.  Taste matches smell, complex and delicious. Malty, some sweetness but not cloying. A little alcohol in the finish, but really little for 10.5%.  Mouthfeel is great.

Tastes of ripe dark fruits, figs, raisins, some chocolate, spiciness, kind of nutty, anise, and alcohol warming that is decently masked for such a big beer. The taste is VERY complex and delicious. Mouthfeel is very bubbly, champagne-like carbonation, very creamy and full-bodied. I could drink these puppies all day long if it wasn't for the 10.5% ABV. Absolutely delicious and a work of art.

Hot with alcohol, and firm with bitterness. All up a bit harsh on the mouth, although it seems to improve when the bottle-bottom yeast is swirled and poured, giving a more creamy expression.

Faint notes of cinnamon in the background.

Aromas of malt, fruits, some light spices perhaps, and caramel were certainly present. The taste was pretty much exactly the same as the smell. The alcohol was well masked in both taste and smell. The taste was also extremely well balanced. The taste was overall not as robust and in your face with this beer as with some other quads and Belgians I have had in the past. Has a full bodied, smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Also not as carbonated as I would have expected it to be. Light to medium carbonation.

I felt this needed revisiting. It poured from a 330mL bottle into my goblet a very murky brownish bronze colour with an alarming amount of sediment and debris. I may need a fork for this one. The head was monstrous and I had to wait a few moments before I could begin drinking it. I really don't care for quads, but this beer is so legendary I felt I had to revisit it. The smell on this one is fabulous. Sweet malts and stewed fruit. I detect almost no alcohol at all. The taste is more of the smell, but with a bit of detectable alcohol that gives a warming sensation as it goes down. The mouthfeel is slick and smooth; easy to drink for a 10.5%abv brew. Overall, I'm very pleased with it, and quite glad that I chose to revisit it. I think it's also important to note that the example I had this evening had a bit of age on it. I have had it in the cellar for at least 6 months, and there's no telling how long the guy from whom I got it had had it, as well.

Persistent lacing left around glass.  Malty aroma with fruitiness and alcohol. Also a slight hint of a sour smell, but not unpleasant.  Sweet and malty with a bit of fruit (maybe black cherry?). Alcohol balances the sweetness well. The flavors are complex and intermingled; sometimes difficult to pintpoint, but excellent overall.  Medium bodied with a tingle from the carbonation.

Appearance:  Pours a hazy dark brown with hints of orange, topped by over 2 inches of tight tan foam that settles slowly.  Aroma:  After waiting over 10 minutes for the head to settle (which leaves a beautiful lace) the complex aromas that arise are a blend of pepper, honey, marachino cherries with a tinge of alcohol.  Taste/Mouthfeel:  Rich round mouthfeel that begs to be chewed. A succulent blend of cherries, chocolate and mellow notes of alcohol combine into a rich drinking experience.

259,1708,davidchollar,4.72,"with lagers and pale ales being my beers of choice in muggy japan, and with my recent trip to seattle where i consumed as much local beer as possible, it's been a long time since i've had a belgian dark. or a dubbel, or a quad, although i had one imperial stout, (my first) and i thought it reminded me of a quad in some ways. anyway, as i pour this beer into a chalice i am reminded of the awesomeness of a good dark belgian ale, and i change the favorite beer in my profile to quadrupel.  i got this 750 of st. bernardus abt 12 at bottleworks in seattle for $11. this is my first time buying this beer, which is basically tied with rochefort 10 as the top quad on BA. i've had the rochefort once, and i remember it clearly... what an experience. so i have high hopes for this one. looks a very dark brown, nearly black, but a little brown on the edges when held to the light. the head is thick, creamy and tan. it never goes anywhere, just stays there, leaves a solid wall of lacing as i sip. a beautiful brew, only missing the perfect 5 because personally i like to look at beers with a little color.  whoa, what a bouquet. it took my nose a little while to adjust, to remember what belgian ales smell like. because at first all i got was that big belgian bready yeast smell. but now, it's been out of the fridge for a while, it's opened up and i'm getting a lot of good smells. dark fruits, prunes, dates, caramel and malt, alcohol. this is strong, and although you don't smell it at first, there is an obvious booziness. overall, it smells like some incredible desserts, raspberry mousse a la mode deluxe with coffee. yum.  alright, after .92 years on BA, i can have an opinion on the debate of which is the top quad. the answer is, whichever one is in my chalice. seriously, it's hard to pick one over the other, that's probably why their overall scores are so close. enough about that though, about the taste of this beer, this one is a party in my mouth. tasty, complex, full-bodied, smooth, big boozy and fruity, bitter finish. it doesn't really taste like a 10% abv, but i am feeling the effects after nearly finishing the bottle. it's not the kind of beer that makes me want another right away, and as i sometimes interpret drinkability as the desire to drink more, the grade suffers a bit. i couldn't handle another one of these right now. but i will get it again some day, and i recommend it to anyone who likes belgian beers or wants to try something new and different. yum.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

I noted the smell of apples as I practically dove into the hearty ale with the same enthusiaasm I have reserved for great al great ails  I liked the tangy sweet malt taste as well as the robust character of the ale and thought it would probably go well with roast beef heros.,Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

The smell is distinctly malt with a little hint of hops and a sugar cherry smell.  Taste: A little heavier in currant then the Rochforte. I had a fresh un-aged bottle which leads me to believe that aging is extremely important.  Mouthfeel: Great. I had a hard time with my fresh bottle as the carbonation was high. The texture was great. The thickness left a nice aftertaste that lingered perfectly.  Drinkability: Unbelievable, I love this type of beer and it is perfect for me.

Taste is very good like sweet candy on the palate, I can taste fruit and some slight bitterness followed by a nice tart taste that goes down really smooth, the alcohol content is really masked behind the great flavor.

Big, chewy, and rich. Good amount of alcohol in the throat and chest. Nice balance but not as complex as I like this beer after laying down a few years. Burnt malts, with a mid palate burst of dried fig. A prune flavored finish, with hints of brown sugar and toffee. Finish lasts a good 30 seconds.  Mouthfeel is rich and creamy.

The aromas from the beer are outstanding, caramel, fruit, a hint of alcohol, raisins, grain, mossy earth, wow. The flavors are equally interesting with a huge caramel flavor coupled with some pleasant spice and dried fruit flavors, rock candy. The alcohol warms the belly and cheeks, but is really well hidden among the big flavors. Finishes fairly dry with a little alcohol flavor.

Grapes, syrupy sugars, and a warming alchohol which is somewhat comforting come through most prominent. Mouthfeel and body are a bit light and creamy, very pleasant.

259,1708,FranklinPCombs,4.67,"Nice muted fig color with a deep brown glow. Head is very thick and bubbly, yet without much protein. Delicate lacing up and down, head subsiding to a thick film. Smell is big on medium body savory malts, perfectly balanced fruit notes ranging from cherry and plum to apple, and a nice earthy sweetness. Yeast and phenol are definitelly in there, but it took me a good couple minutes to find them. Spices range from orange to clove. The alcohol definitely compliments the aroma, rather than overpowering it. There are so many layers in the smell alone, I spent a good five minutes just with my nose stuck in the snifter, inhaling deeply and finding something new each time. Taste is held together with a great deep malt backbone, supporting a rich brown sweetness, with a bigger emphasis on spice than on fruitiness. There are definite figgy hints, but more so are the savory spices. Peppercorn, mustard and other unidentifiable tastes glaze over a nice meaty center. The taste is not quite as layered and complex as the smell, but even falling short of that leaves it above most anything I've had. Mouthfeel is great, with an initial bite of carbonation that follows halfway back the tongue, then suddenly drops away for a smooth silky back. This is a real adventure to drink, going down smooth and easy, with so much to offer on the way. I only wish there was a category for 'smellability' because this beer would take my gold for that.

This is the highest rating I have given to a beer yet. I don't believe in giving a beer all 5's but it was very tempting with this one. The best way to describe this beer is ""WOW"". I am a big fan of Belgian Ales, Chimay, Delirium etc, but I think this is the best of them all. I have to go back and have another.  It was served to me in a ST. Bernardus chalice. The pour was very dark with a beautiful one or two finger head. This beer is very complex; fruit, hops, alchohol all are present. But most of all it is smooth and very drinkable. It was gone before I knew it.  I will definately pick up a couple of the 750ml bottles to try at home. And as I said, I have to go back to the bar to enjoy this again.

A healthy two finger pillowy light tan head cap the brew and it's very resistant, clinging to the glass wherever possible as it goes down, and never really disappears from the surface, leaving a quarter inch frothy layer on top.  Nose: Yeast, sourdough bread, oranges, grapes, clove, anise... really enjoyable, sweet & complex, but a tad too faint. Also, as the beer warms I was getting lungs full of alcohol fumes.  Mouth: Enters biscuity and yeasty, spicy and sweet, grape flavors, creamy clove and possibly chocolate, fruity esters. The mouthfeel is a bit disappointing, tingly upon entering then thick and creamy at the end, retaining a bit too much gas, making the swallow a bit hard.

Aroma is fruity, mostly ripe, dark fruit paired with a caramel sweetness with some earthier undertones, some spice notes, warm sugary alcohols finish out the nose. Taste is sweet, candied dry fruit, caramel, malt, light alcohol notes and a similar earthiness of the nose present as well. Sweetness increases as it warms, fruitier profile emerges as well, taste some cinnamon/nutmeg like spiciness as the fruits fade off the tongue. Light sweet and dry aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with very low carbonation, slides down the throat. Drinkability is high, given the intriguing complexity and character of this Quad, hardly hints at it's nearly 11% abv.

259,1708,benito,2.87,"I'm not sure why this is categorized as a Quad, as its flavors sit squarely in the world of Dubbels. Anyhow, I should point out that Dubbels are probably my least favorite style of beer (with the notable exception of Goose Island's Pere Jacques...mmm). For whatever reason I struggle with the mix of fruity sweet and miscellania, so take my review with a grain of salt.  This is a brownish, amber brew with a small head and good lacing. The bouquet and flavor both are dominated by flouride like flavors--call it bubblegum or mint--and in both cases, the sweetness is backed up by a nice salty dryness. In the bouquet, this is mostly a sea-water quality and in taste, more of a alcohol flavor. The mouthfeel is soapy--sweet and then dry, though bubbly and effervescent throughout. Unfortunately, it doesn't do much to aid a rather thin body and flimsy length. I honestly don't care for this beer that much, though again, I recognize that as a quirk of my palate and some sort of strange prejudice against this style.  This is certainly not in my Top 100 beers, but for folks who dig dubbels, I would recommend this, maybe even highly.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

I popped the cork like it was a champagne bottle, not hollywood style, but slowly, so as to let out a small slow hiss. This poured true, not like some other high ABV malt monsters that run thick or syrupy. There was a nice foamy white head that brought a little hop oil to the surface for me to breathe in, as well as some yeast to look at. It is a rare beer that can whollop you with flavor without killing you with its alcohol an dpotential heavyness, but this pulled off that feat. It has tremendous layers for you to go through and enjoy from toffee through stone fruit flavors, with some vanilla rounding off the edge. Much like the pour, it drank clean.

259,1708,GClarkage,4.3,"08/01/06- Purchased at Bottleworks in Seattle, WA.  Presentation- 750ml bottle, not sure from what year. Purchased in September 2005, so probably either 2004 or 2005. Poured into my St. Bernardus chalice.  Appearance- Deep brown in color. A bit of a auburn highlight. Full inch head, very large bubbled and foamy. Excellent chunks and streak of lace left behind. Furious as hell pop from the cork. I thought it was going to explode, it was that loud.  Smell- At first very fruity. Then it turned into a very sweet and caramel scented malt mixture. Kinda like cookie dough, but more like dulce de leche. Seems kinda earthy. Whatever it is, it smells increasingly better as it warms into above room temp. Started out at about 50, and finished it off at about 60-65.  Taste- At first sip it had a somewhat offputting metallic taste. This went away bit by bit as it was consumed. As it warms (key is to drink it at room temp at the coolest) it brings in a really nice ultra sweet candied malt flavor. That mixed with plims, prunes, raisins and figs make it very tastefull. It has a very earthy and irony taste that could be past for metallic, but I think it's more earthy and dirt like. Kinda a newbie to this style...still trying to figure them out.  Mouthfeel- Higher carbonated than I would like, but it calmed down after a good 30 minutes of resting in the chalice.  Drinkability- Probably my top ranked Quad. Was very nice to the tastebuds. What I wouldn't fo for a beer like this on cask. Or at least on tap. Have past it up at the Toronado many times because I knew I had a few bottles at home I was waiting to try. Quality beer for sure.

Holding the glass to my nose I smell a very sweet raisiny aroma that is coupled big a huge alcohol scent. The taste. ah yes my favorite thing about this beer. This beer had a huge taste of raisins that gave this beer of faulty impression that it was overlly sweet with a load of sugars left behind. However, the mouth feel was extremely dry. With the raisin taste I expected there to be a sugary build up on my tounge then I realized no this finishes extremely dry with none of the sugar build up.

Taste is of sweet malt caramel, toffee, vanilla, dark fruits, slightly bitter hops and distinct alcohol presence throughout. The flavors are complex, as a quad should be.

Lots of sweet fruit: apples, raisins, dates, pears, and anything else you could want. No need for hops here.  T: So many flavors merging into a nearly perfect final taste. Tart fruits meeting sweet caramel malt. More flavors than I can pick out and list. Alcohol is not as present as I would expect.  M/D: Mouthcoating and creamy. Carbonation is perfect, the tiniest of bubbles. As heavy and coating as it is, rinses very clean without harsh hops. Drinkability is unique. Alcohol seems very low. Very inviting, but the flavors are so complex that the tastebuds need a rest. Not a refreshing beer, but a perfect beer to sit and think with.

Good roasted malt flavor initially, with hints of many others, mocha, plum, caramalized apple, all blended wonderfully together. Bitterness is clearly apparent but balanced very well.

The smell is of bread, malt and candy sugar, raisins and clove. The taste adds notes of alcohol, prunes, with very little hop balance. The mouthfeel is quite a sublime experience, whether it be a quadrupel or as the label suggests, a dubbel, brown ale. This is the best beer I have ever tried.

Strong scent of dark fruit and bread along with a hint of alcohol. The flavor is sugary sweet dark fruit with a good dose of warming alcohol. As it warms, more fruit taste and a slightly bitter, bready yeastiness comes through. It mixes well to smooth out the taste of the 10.5% alcohol. Rich and complex but perfectly balanced.

No apparent bitterness or hop character (just as it should be).  T: Taste starts off very clean and leads into malt with a slight presence of yeast. Alcohol creeps in at the end, though hidden fairly well, and finishes very warm. Absolutely delicious. All tastes lead to a very balance experience.  M&D: Medium mouthfeel. Malt is not sweet, but more earthy. The alcohol balances out the malt. Highly drinkable, though I'm sure the 10.5 abv will quickly reign me in.  Overall, this is a glorious beer.

The taste is long and complex, with clove, peach, banana, dark rye bread, and winey flavors, and a faint but delicious sweetness underpinning it all, and beautifully integrated hops. The echo of clove and nutmeg persists long after you swallow.  The mouthfeel is bready, creamy, and silky- the high carbonation is just the slightest bit distracting.

Dissipated to a constant 1/4 thick head that lasted until the end.  Smells of sweet malts, earthy green, flowery notes (hops), caramel.  Taste: Sweet and sour! Banana, caramel sweet malts, flowery-non bitter hops. Starts of sour and finishes with an incredible deep smokey taste. Mellows and enriches on the palate.  Full Body(legs last forever and even displays some nice design's after the beer is gone!!)Feels thick, chewy, very substantial, yet a flatness that makes this rather smooth. NO Bite from the 10 % ABV.Well hidden!! You would never figure it was 10%, the mellow complexity masks it's power pretty well understood.  Easily one of the best beer experiences I've had. The complexity and clearity of the taste is rather exceptional IMHO.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,ultralarry2006,4,"Poured from a 750 ml bottle that by the way inists that this is a ""dubbel"", and not a ""quadrupel"" , as it is listed here. Anyway, it left a beige one finger head, that eventually recedes to long lasting surface skim, and this has some decent lacing. Body was a dark brown. Looks good.  Smell - esters and phenols. Dried dark fruits, dark bread, and medicine. Tiny hint of abv.  Taste - plums, raisins, figs, and medicine. It's rather straightfoward, and really no more complicated than that, but it's very good and satisfying. There is a very slight bit of alcohol warmth , especially as the ale gets warmer, but it only adds a pleasing spicy finish on the taste, rather than harshness. Actually, at this level of abv, the alcohol, is very well hidden, a very good thing, as far as I'm concerned.  Mouthfeel - halfway between full and thin, it is smooth, and has medium carbonation.  Drinkability - this is good, and goes down well. However, the high abv would limit this to one 750 ml. serving per session.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

The taste is so well balanced that each taste shows something else. One taste might have a tangy sweetness, the next esters from a warm fermentation, the next, pleasant alcohol warmth. A pleasure to drink from a cold room temp all the way to room temperature. Wow. I think I'll have another.

The pour reveals a shade of amber that leans heavily toward purple, or garnet, or red. Quite a peach to look at really. A wonderfully appetizing head rolls up and holds as a slender slab of creamy froth. Most delicious. Fluffy whips of lace cling heavily and create a rolling topography around the outskirts of this event. A few drips of yeast have peppered a tight pattern in the midground of this head. It looks like a bit of nutmeg sprinkled atop a fine dessert. The nose is complex in dark fruit subtleties. It smells like a bit of fermented black cherry. A sort of sugar crusted candy sweetness booms within the honed confines of this brew as the malt structure is notably solid. I think the yeast has contributed heavily to the delight I derive from repeated and incessant sniffing. The smell is so much different. Wild and tart with an expressive gale of alcohol. The taste is darkly fruity, alcoholic and rootish. The black fruitiness and alcoholic characters lay on the back of a creamy mouthfeel. Unique and delicious. The drinkability is super good. The only problem is it ends up gone. The last few sips are a spectacle. This song has ended on a solid note. I can tell this one is from somewhere else.

Vanilla head of EPIC proportions sits atop the raisin body. Tons of lacing.  Very smooth aroma. Hints of fruit, sour grapes, an acidic tartness, a little funk and some yeastiness. Pretty complex stuff we're talkin about here.  What a solid beer. Everything melds together perfectly. Begins with some funkiness, probably the yeast. Alot of over-ripe dark fruits. Raisins, prunes, and a very sweet aftertaste that is kind of like white-grapes or apples. Quality stuff. So smooth and it doesn't get boring.  Full body, not oily, but definitely something that coats your mouth and your throat as it goes down. Carbonation is perfect and this is super smooth and easy-drinking. The 10.5% is un-noticable.

It poured brown with a thick, creamy two-finger off-white head that after a minute or so went to half the size and remained there - just as a great beer's head should do. Wonderful to look at! This beer has been reviewed so many times - I just want to say what impressed me the most - the spices and fruitiness was very creamy - some of the wonderful tastes were almost lost in the creaminess. It was a wonderful sipping beer - The alcohol warmed the body at the end - This was a great beer - similar to the trappist ales - but creamier, and with a little bite at the end. I don't know - IMO - that it was an all ""5"" beer - but, very close - if 4.75's could be given - I would have given it that.

Short and to the point: A: Deep ruby brown, cloudy opaque. Light brown head that settles quickly. From first sip to the last the bubbles sparkled in the lacing as it trickled down the side of the glass. Beautiful. S: Right up front, there is spice, bready yeast, fruit, cola, and a few others I couldn't put my finger on. T: This one has big flavour. Strong caramel malt, all of the above flavours, and an overall earthiness. That is earthiness in a good sense, like when you take a deep sniff of a handful of top grade farm soil and can tell from the aroma that this is full of goodness. M: Medium to full body. Although this beer was not really cold, it seemed to pass on the sense of coldness more than most beers could. D: Refreshing and smooth. I would say yes to another, but at 10% abv, that would be enough.  If you can get these at a decent price, snap them up.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Poured a dense, murky black with only traces of dark brown noticeable on the fringes of the glass. One-finger, foamy, light cocoa head faded to a thick coating of lace with intermittent bubbles. Large, sporadic patches of lacing lasted long after the beer itself was finished.  Smell was incredibly aromatic and sweet. Super malty rich (caramel malts) and yeasty with fresh, ripe fruits and candied sugar. Notes of powdered cocoa and coffee also detectable.  Taste was decadent. Strong malt presence up front (caramel malts) along with sweet, luscious fruits and brown sugar. So pleasant and enjoyable. Spices, dark, dried fruits (raisins, prunes) and dark chocolate became apparent mid-palate. On the back end, sugars and alcohol dominated and became more prevalent as the beer warmed. Noticeable alcohol warming in the back of the mouth and the throat. At 10% ABV, the alcohol was still not overwhelming. Sugary, sweet, resonating aftertaste.  Rich, creamy, smooth mouthfeel.  This is an amazingly complex beer. With each sip I tasted an array of new flavors. An outstanding quad rivaled by few.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Thick lacing remained on side of glass. Beer looks very dark amber to brown.  Smells spicy and malty. Taste follows nose beautifully. Great carbonation that leads to a spicy aftertaste that tickles the roof of mouth. Taste is smoother on draught than from bottle.  It's a bit heavy, more of a fall/winter beer in my eyes. Would be perfect with a sweater. Overall fantastic beer will have again especially when I can find it on tap.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Heavy roasted malts with slight burnt sugar and a slight fowery hops that do a good job of bringing out the fruit flavors.  Light, hard to taste and watery. Spicy sweet with a slight peppermint and burnt sugar flavors. This was a little dissaponting, I should've rated the one bottle I've ever had.  Mouthfeel is smooth and nice.

Coriander and cloves. It smells fruity also. I smell figs and dates. The alcohol is very well hidden in the aroma. It has an earthy yeast aroma also. It also has a nice sweet molasses aroma.  This beer tastes exactly like it smells. The spict flavor is great. It has a pleasent fruity flavor too. It has a spicy hop flavor. As with the aroma, the alcohol is very well hidden in the flavor.  This beer is full bodied, but it goes down smooth. It leaves a very spicy aftertaste. This beer is highly carbonated, going well for the style.  I dont know if this beer would be my first choice as a session beer. Although it dosent taste like it, the alcohol content is up there.

Giant bubbles slowly dissipated, leaving a healty covering of foam on top of the beer. Lacing was not as good as I was expecting.  Aroma was typical of a Belgian Ale. Strong yeast, fruit, bananas.  Taste was good, but I was really expecting something that would grab me and scream out about how good it was, and this beer didn't do it for me. Slight alcoholicy, sweet, a bit of an overripe banana aftertaste. As beer warmed, alcohol taste came to the forefront. I've had many other beers that I've liked better than this. Very disappointed.  Mouthfeel was good. Very creamy and smooth. Alcohol was waming and bitter as beer warmed. It is very strong, and I could not drink more than one or two at a sitting.  Overall, I don't think this beer is worth the price it commands. It's not a bad beer by any means, but it just didn't do much for me.

Absolutely a beaut -- lots of carbonation, lacing, and a fair amount of head retention. Smells of light caramel, fruits . . . a bit ""fresh.""  A perfect 58 degree temperature makes all the flavors and complexity come out right away. Chewy malt goodness and a taste that is damn near perfect.

Medium body with a fair amount of carbonation. Sweet malt up front but most of the flavor kicks in toward the middle and end with strong notes of pepper, malt, and clove.

Probably the best beer I've ever had the priviledge of tasting. I got to drink this serious beverage out of its 750 ml bottle, and enjoyed every small sip of it. From the three-finger head to the last breath of quality, few beers can compare to the quality and flavor that the Abt. 12 brings to the table. It is so hard to describe something so beautiful; so I feel almost at a loss to even try.

259,1708,instrumentality,4.55,"Poured a dark, rich, translucent brown with mild carbonation and a fluffy, creamy head that refused to subside significantly. I watched a bit of sediment settle to the bottom--was I supposed to leave that in the bottle? Oh well.  Smelled like chocolate malt mixed with champagne. Very appealing.  Tasting this beer for the first time was a memorable experience. The odors translated well to the palate, the malty chocolate flavor with the bittersweetness of champagne, along with the tartness of cherries and a dash of caramel. The champagne and malt prevailed in the aftertaste.  I tend to be heavily critical on mouthfeel - if it burns my tongue, is too heavily carbonated, or leaves a skunky aftertaste, I lay into it. But this one is very easy on the palate. Although I can definitely feel it, I can barely taste the alcohol. It doesn't burn, it doesn't fizz, and the aftertaste is a gentle malty caramel, almost like a classy version of Milk Duds.  I'm still fairly new to the Belgian beer scene, but based on what I've tried, this one reminds me of a Tripel in its champagne-like bittersweetness (I base this interpretation mainly on Westmalle's Tripel) with the added layers of malt and chocolate.  This is an unusual beer, and not one I'd drink on a daily basis, but it is definitely enjoyable and I deeply respect its balance and complexity. It's unusual for a beer with this many flavors to go down so smoothly with no one layer dominating the others.  I picked this bottle up for $4.49 for an 11.2 oz bottle, and I'd consider that a steal. I already had several of these shipped directly from Belgium without ever having tried them, and although I'm kicking myself for not realizing it was available for sale just 5 miles from my apartment, I am definitely looking forward to trying several more.  This is one of the most pleasing beers I've ever had. I'd like to face this one off against the Trappistes Rochefort 10 and see which one I truly prefer. Both are fantastic.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Scents of dark fruit, perhaps cherry, bready malts, some nutty hints. Wine like alchohol is present in the nose  Nutty brown sugary malt flavors mix with those of cooked fruit bombard your mouth first. Finishes with some complex grain flavors and an almond aftertaste.  Starts off very bubbly then get some what chewy and doughy finishes with a small burst of cabonation very clean and dry finish  The only thing that keeps this from being a 5.0 on the drinkability scale is it's deceptivly high ABV",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

It becomes a bit more pleasant as it warms.  The flavor is some sweet and sugary dark fruit with a lot of belly-warming strong alcohol. As it warms, more fruitiness and a slightly bitter, bready yeastiness comes out to balance the alcohol. The mouthfeel is medium with some harsh carbonation.  Overall, a bit of a disappointment. I let this sit for about 15-20 minutes before starting, but it was still a bit harsh at the beginning. As it warmed, it became much better.

I pick out tangy cider in the mostly malt ridden aroma as a whole. Complex, but mingling nicely.  The flavor is malted barley up front, deeper inspection finds dark fruits and more cider from the nose. A delicious beer. Slight alcohol adds spice to the mix, but never overpowers. The brew is of medium carbonation and sits in the mouth well.  This beer is made to savor, with its ABV and its price-to-quantity ratio considered, but can be drunken at a steady pace if you really wanted to.

Spicy alcohol is ever present but really comes forward towards the end and into the aftertaste, but is never over the top.

Wonderful head retention and lacing throughout the duration of the beer. The smell is more complex than my brain can process. I pick up many fruits (plum, cherries, banana and even apples) along with a nice malt and yeast aroma. The high ABV sneaks into the nose as well but is not overpowering. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with just the right amount of carbonation. Taste is extremely complex. Some sips I will get a delicate combination of fruit while others I will get a darker malt/chocolate taste. These tastes are followed up by a large alcohol kick.

One of those beers that, after you take a sip, you put it down, take a step back, and stare at the glass. Starts off with dark fruity maltiness (sugar plums, apricots and figs) with caramel, toffee, and toast joining in, followed by a bitter-chocolatey sweetness/bitterness in perfect balance. Then the alcohol joins in. This may be the best tasting beer I've ever tried. Simply stunning. The finish is merely a continuance of the taste. The mouthfeel is like liquid velvet. You'd never guess the strength from drinking it until you've had two and realize that walking is now a bit more problematic.  I had this in bottle many years ago,and enjoyed it.

It poured into my Duvel snifter a lovely opaque medium brown with sediment on the bottom, a huge off-white, almost tan head, which had remarkable retention and left some of the most exquisite lacing I've ever seen. It was there until the end of the tasting. The aroma was fantastic. Dark fruits, sweet fruits, malts, bread dough, yeasts, alcohol, vanilla and spice, clove, mild citrus even. It was heavenly. The taste was just as complex as the nose. Brown sugar, bread doughs and yeasts, vanilla, clove, sweet malts, caramel, dark fruits, over-ripe sweet fruits, alcohol, rasins. The feel was a little astringent up front with the carbonation and alcohol, but it immediately smoothes out, leaving a sweet and creamy taste lingering, finally finishing with a buttery feeling on your tongue, almost like eating a buttery vanilla caramel. I've never tasted anything like it. This was as cose ot perfectly balanced as I've experienced. It was complex, full of subtlety and flavor. I could easily sip this all night long and then ask for another just to start the olfactory and taste jouurney all over agian; because thats what it is.

A deep garnet with a dishwater head that just won't quite! No matter how long you let it sit, the head just won't go away. No matter how much my moustache releases oils that cause lesser heads to fail. Too bad it's all downhill from there.  It smells like curacao oranges. Why in the world would I want beer to smell like oranges?  And the taste? Nasty yeast gets into a terrible trainwreck with curacao oranges, toffee, and chocolate. Terrible.  The mouthfeel is easily the worst part of this beer. The excessive use of sugar leads to a paper thin body -- so what do they do to compensate? Equally excessive use of crystal malts. Sticky sugars mingling with thinner-than-water body. Terrible.  Drinkability? I could barely finish choking down my 8 ounces of it.

Densely clouded blood red with a thinning and finely attenuated light tan layer of foam. Nose is predominantly port-like, with notes of alcohol heat, maraschino cherries, and yeasted sugar candies. The highly noticeable booziness of the aroma is stunningly masked in the flavor; all I get are dark rum-soaked plums, bing cherries, and a slightly soured date sugar sweetness at the finish. Hearty yeast-flavored aftertaste. The alcohol is slightly noticeable immediately before the finish in the form of a langorous warming at the back of the throat. Mouth feel is chewy and expansive, airy and fluffy with a rapid yet subtle carbonated effect. Without a doubt, ridiculously drinkable for 10% abv. As expected, pure class in a bottle.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,brushpig,3.75,"As soon as you pour this baby into your glass you can tell its going to be a interesting beer with it's rich dark chocolate brown coloring and it full thick head. Cherry, yeasty, alcohol, Cloves, and Coco fill the nose. Nice moderate carbination with a rich and creamy feel. The alcohol does take a little bite. So I took small sips. Taste of carmel, dryed fruits,and alittle strong in the alcohol, but it still tasted dessert like. It is a nice beer to end the evening with. Recommended for sure.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,UncleFlip,4.23,"Had it a few times before....just now getting around to the review....  Looks great in the glass... Nice explosive tan head...medium bubbles....fills the glass nicely, but falls at a decent rate (should have used a wet glass, maybe...). Liquid under is clear red-copper when held to light...looks more aubunr to reddish-brown on the table.  The smell is bready-yeasty, reminds me a bit ofthe crusty brown bread my father used to bake...however, it's a bit spicier, and has some almond and grapefruit notes. Just a slight hint of banana back there somewhere, as well.  Pretty much what I expect form a well-done quad. Nice and spicy up front, slightly sour, with a deep molasses-like sweetness,then a spiciness that returns on the end. Not the most assertive flavour, but very good. There'a a nice chest-warming alcohol as it goes down.  A little oily on the tongue, and the liquid is not thick or hearty at all. Carbonation hits a second or two in, but does not get overbearing.  Were this one just a BIT more assertive, I might give it a 5 on drinkability. As it its, there are other belgians that command my attention a bit more. However, it's not bad, and I'd not turn it down.  Be well -UF",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,mattcrill,3.91,"Aroma: Belgian yeast, cloves, wet grains, a touch estery. Not all that impressed by the aroma.  Appearance: Murky brown ice tea color pour. Fades to ruby edging. A pillowy tan cap develops and the retention is simply breathtaking. Most impressive.  Flavor: Peppery, rum soaked raisins, hints of smokiness, cabarnet grapes, and a firm alcohol punch. A touch hot but seems to blend together better as it warms.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with lively carbonation. Slightly creamy at points.  Overall impression: Certainly a good beer and enjoyable enough but not sure that I would put it in the ""outstanding"" category. I enjoyed the Abt 8 much more. This seems a touch unbalanced with the alcohol taking too much presence. The bottle suggests aging and I'd be inclined to agree with them. Put this back a few years and I could see this as outstanding. Recommended.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Absumaster,3.68,"This beer pours a red brown colour an d a crude head with a lot of carbonation. Smell was not very impressive, slightly acidic and almost like red wine. Some tannine and molasses or soy sauce? Off course the usual dark fruit like cherries and grapes, mhh... this sounds an awfull lot like red wine, I am not a fan of red wine, because of the grapes and dry mouthfeel, so does that make me prejudiced?  Taste was dry, but full, slightly acidic again the wine-like acidity and dryness. Mild and very little maltiness and hop bitterness. The alcohol really warms me up and quickly goes up to my brain, numbing it. Almost forgot to mention the most upfront tastes which are caramel and dark fruit.  I can't really say that this beer lives up too the reputation. For me it is too acidic and too strong to really enjoy the beer.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Pours chestnut brown with two fingers of tiny-bubbled foam leaving copious amounts of lace on my St. Bernardus chalice. Aroma reminds me of a concentrated version of the Pater 6...many promises of rum-soaked fruits, dates, figs, scattered alcohol esters, and that beautiful house yeast which resides at the Abbey.  Entry is perfect, with slightly addled carbonation tickling the sides of the tongue and inside of the cheeks. Midtaste features layer upon layer of rich bready malt, ripe figs, and spicy-rum soaked cherries. The finish is a wonderful mixture of St. B's yeasties, biscuity malt, and wonderful alcohol warming on the back of the throat.  Quads have never been a style to make me cross the street...but I'd crawl naked over two miles of broken glass just to get my hands on another bottle of this.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,jettjon,4.45,"Highs: Appearance, nose, taste, mouthfeel Lows: None  OK, I must admit this is a terribly anticipated tasting. I was not disappointed. From the 11.2 oz. bottle dated 1/27/10, pours a nearly opaque brown color that seems more caramel-like in bright light. Also evident in strong light is the suspended yeast from a pour, resuspend, and finish, though the yeast is transparent to the mouth. Topped by a one-finger brown-tan head of small bubbles that fades pretty quickly leaving a thin sheet-like head and plenty of lacing along the sides that persists until the bottom of the chalice. Odor of grapes, definitely a strong and pleasant bready yeast presence and maybe a bit of orange rind. Taste is extremely complex, a bit much to take in at once. Buttery creamy grape malt, fades to a pretty strong alcohol at the end that culminates in a slow burn into a fruity-dry finish. Mouthfeel is substantial but not creamy with heavy but gentle carbonation. The bubbles persist, slowly fading in the mouth, almost melting away. The mouthfeel is absolutely fantastic. Drinkability is good, but at 10% ABV, watch out!  Overall: A fantastic quadrupel. Well representative of the style. Enthusiastically recommended, if you can find it.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,semihobo,3.66,"Been sitting on this bottle for a year and a half, I've had other bottles of this since then but not sure what the age will do for it. Best by 20-07-09 though.  What a beaut. In the Bernardus chalice, rich and dark with a creamy half inch head, bubbles so fine that you can't even see them individually. Reminds me of tiramisu. 2 inches of lacing drying on the sides of the glass by the time it is finished, and great retention. This Abt 12 -- so hot right now. Seriously though, you could be a model. And I'm not just saying that to get in your pants.  Smells delicious. Cloves and candy. Raisins. Some sort of cleaner product though lurks in the back, could be the alcohol ... I like how cleaner products smell though. Vanilla, yeasty. Yessir.  Taste is ... not as amazing as its been in the past. Alcohol, sadly the dominant flavor, is sharp; the sweetness isn't delicate and is in fact quite harsh. Nothing is too off, but this is not a masterpiece I expect from St. B. A slight bonus for the times it's been delicious.  Mouthfeel is big, in your face bubbles, not creamy. Maybe this fermented more in aging and powered up the alcohol and carbonation... just speculating.  I really like the brewery and this beverage. I guess I took a chance on aging it, in some subideal conditions, and it didn't work out. I'll have to do another review with a fresh bottle and note the differences. The Pater 6 and Tripel are much better, I think, and they were aged side by side for almost the same amount of time so I don't feel the bottle should be spoiled.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

I get alot more phenol than esters in the smell; peppery is the dominant smell with some plum in the background. The taste starts out peppery then hint of orange and plum that give way to a malt, bready type ending. The flavors are all mixed in after each sip, the peppery taste may not be first but it is there as is the fruit and malt. It is highly carbonated and has a medium mouthfeel; the carbonation seems to help mix all the flavors around.

This kind of brew could only take centuries of brewing expirience, to reach a level of this caliber...bless the Belgian's for their expertise here!  Great full bodied quad to be reckoned with.

The bottle is nearly the same, with the exception of a bit more carbonation. The St. Bernie on tap had a softer mouthfeel. I also think that the smell suffers a bit in the bottle. However, this is still a very good beer. Dried fruits and vanilla are present in the nose and the taste. The head on the bottle version is a tad more than that on tap, but both lace the chalice tremendously, till the very end. The taste finishes on the dry side, and the acholol is present on each sip, but that doesn't shy me away from this one. As usual, the Belgian pride shows through.

It is if you can't appreciate the beer. You see, when I first decided to explore the various tastes of beer I decided to try some of the best right off. Good idea in theory but bad idea if the palate is not ready for it. As I've come to see recently many beers I thought of as ""ok"" are now considered amazing by me now that my palate has grown enough to appreciate them. Take this beer for example. I thought it was good the first time I tried it. Now a year later I find it devine. The pour gave way to an attractive brown elixir with floating carbonation. Head is mild, about an a half inch, with minor lacing. Nose is something like an apple strudel. This is just incredible. Tartness, sweetness and a fresh sourness. Beautiful. Taste is a riot of flavors. An almost buttery medley of apple, vanilla frosting and dash of white wine mingled with caramel. All the while the methodical carbonation is massaging your tongue.

Smells are caramel, rum, roasted malts and raisins.  This bottle had been aging while, so maybe that's why the alcohol bite was mellow compared to newer bottles I've had. In any case, I found the alcohol to be present but not overwhelming. The flavors were of dark fruits, roasted malts, toffee and chocolate. And I swear there's a ripe grape essence too. Nice creamy mouthfeel coats the mouth/tongue, keeping those flavors going long after the sip.  Pretty high ABV but an absolutely delicious experience.

My nose is awash with winter-warming aromas of wine, dates, raisins, banana, oter dark sweet fruits and a hint of citrus for good measure. A very full body and a gentle fizz really gets it going in the mouth, and it goes down extremely well. It costs me 2 euros a bottle (less than $3) so it's a regular for me.  Some say this is like Westvleteren, and some don't. The brewery was at one stage brewing for Westvleteren, so no doubt there are influences in there. But if you're confused as to whether it's the same or not, I've got news for you. I've drunk several of these in my time, as well as westy 12, and most were quite different from Westy (hence my comments in my westy 12 review). Excellent, but different. But tonight I popped open an Abt 12 and, well, it was VERY Westy-like. Perhaps it depends on the brewing season, but this one is very much like Westy. It's got that alcohol/port aroma that's not in the other Abt 12s I had, and it's very very similar to Westy 12, though it is a little less punchy. Best before date of this one is 20-09-10, so if you've got one of those, and it's got port-ish aromas, you're lucky to have an almost-westy batch.

The alcohol barely comes through, though it seeps through the nose at the end of the sip, sneaking up on you. It's crushed under the sheer weight of the beer, an assortment of tons of barley malt and dark, bitter cherries and every fruit darker than that. Could stand to have a little more bitterness, as a finisher, but then again, it's pretty fantastic.  This is a beer to sip by a fire and in the company of good friends, a beer to harmonize with a situation of rich beauty and languor.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Prunes, cherries... faint alcohol scent and the barest touch of cinnimon.  Taste: Follow thru on the fruit smell. Sweet and smooth with a touch of hops on the tail.  Mouthfeel: Smooth yet almost shockingly carbonated. The tastes and carbonation combine to tickle and prickle the palate.  Drinkability: Smooth sipping beer with a deceptive ABV.

Aroma was grainy and sweet malts. Fruity like figs or raisins, with earthy and spicy undertones. Taste was just as expected with fruity raisins and figs. Had a very refreshing fruitiness but with just the right amount of hops to smooth down the sweetness and finish with mellow cloves and spices. Has a earthy oaken undertone. Carbonation is medium with medium body. It has a lot of flavor that lasts for a while but with a refreshing mouthfeel. Alcohol is mostly hidden but still has a good warming effect.

Aged for 2 years+, I've just been waiting for the right time...uncaps with an assuring rush of air  Appearance - pours with a quick head-forming froth of bubbles. Viewed straight on, it's got a dull garnet color with a solid foamy cover, the bottom sediment looking like sprinkled cinnamon on top. Held up to a good backlight, there is a whole universe of stuff floating around in that glass. Chunks, flakes, fine granules of stuff.  Aroma - initially a blend of chocolate and alcohol. It settles, the chocolate fades a little but not entirely, and some banana and yeast aromas make it through. After the beer settles, the aroma doesn't. It stays steady, full, and enticing. A sustained head is likely responsible for much of that.  Taste - begins with a dark, malty sweet flavor. Velvety chocolate and a boozy warmth arrive together. Some mild hop balancing on the swallow as the abv provides a warm, fuzzy finish. Not harsh at all, the end is warm chocolate and a smile.  Mouthfeel - perfect. Soooo smooth. Active carbonation balances out the quad heaviness. Really goes hand in hand with the flavor.  Drinkability - this does not comes across like 10%, what a great beer.

That might be, however, because when in the bottle I allow it to warm up a bit rather than drinking it cold, which is where this beer shines.

The nose was spicy, malty and chocolatey. The taste was impressive, with notes of dark fruit, chocolate, port wine and molasses in the palate. This beer was very rich and luscious.

All the flavors just seem a bit more subdued than Westy 12. Malts are candy sweet with some tired Belgian sugars. Spice flavors were present but they seemed like they were out of date too. Phenols were a bit strong, especially as the beer warmed more. Little bits of cherry too. Full body and flavor.

I allowed mine to warm up outside the fridge for at least a half an hour before opening and serving. I prefer my beer warm. The beer poured a dark brown with cm+ of head that retained through the drink. A fine lacing inched its way down the glass behind the liquid. The beer smelled wonderfully: big, doughy malts along with raison and some spices. Excellent aroma.  The beers flavor was big and comlex like its aroma. With a malt presence at the beginning along with overt hints of different dark fruits. A subdued hop presence and a completely hidden abv., Although thils beer's creaminess points it towards the sipping category, it can sneak up on you while being incredibly drinkable.

This was my first taste of this beer, although I have another 12 oz and 2 bombers of it stashed away. Colour is brown, opaque, with a nice 1"" head that sticks around for a while. Attractive pour, although a bit dull in colour for such a highly rated beer.  Smell is very malty, elements of grape, prunes, raisins. Bready, like fresh sweet breakfast buns. Some spicy notes, and a bit of alcohol.  Taste evolves. My first taste, I have to admit I really didn't like it. By the time I finished, I wanted more. It's fascinating, and incredibly complex. Mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy. Absolutely no harshness. Malty, bready, and dark, sweet fruits. A little bit of upfront bite to it from the mild carbonation, but it fits right into the profile.

259,1708,Tupperwolf,4.83,"I've been saving this one for some time now - not sure what to expect, but expectations are high. A beer does't get to be number 4 on the top 100 list without being exceptional.  Pour into my tulip a dark brown that becomes, to my surprise, almost completely black; It forms a beautiful, rocky, fluffy meringue-like head, and in some lights reveals its mysterious depths to be a carefully decanted clear dark, glowing ruby. The head is exceptional, leaving wallls of lacing, and the beer seems to change color depending on the light.  Gentle twinges of alcohol lead and blend into a varied, mixed bunch of scents. Lots of dark fruits here - raisins, plums, black cherries just beginning to overripen, just slightly tart. A slight wet-earth woodiness, and a roasted sugar sweetness backed up by espresso bitters.  This has a nice, soft sugary flavor that builds and smooths out as it warms; It's there, but it's not overdone; It has a sweet, slightly woody dark fruit flavor that carries small, vaguely detectable notes of coffee or roasty smoke - mostly, it's sweet, slick, and very slightly spiced by its alcohol - which, I may add, is almost completely absent, considering this is over 10%abv.  Smooth mouthfeel almost devoid of carbonation despite the lustrous head, which is perfect for me. There's enugh carbonation to build the flavors and sensations of this beer, but not enough to disrupt a smooth, delightful drinking experience.  This is one of the first Belgians I've hadd, out of many, which tempts me to have a second glass immediately after the first.

I have had this beer on any number of occasions, and I was really surprised when I recently discovered that I hadn't reviewed it. Pours a deep mahogany with a pretty tan head made of very tiny bubbles.  The aroma is what makes this beer supreme. There are only a few beers that I could just sit and smell all day long- this is one of them. Rich chocolate and candy and dark fruit (dates and plums and black cherries), some brandy notes and this stuff is heaven.  Flavor is marvelous as well, but not quite as incredible because of the alcohol burn on my tongue (I never know if that should be included in taste or mouthfeel). Somewhat sharper and drier than expected from the aroma, but all the aromas are there in the flavor as well.  Rich full mouthfeel, the alcohol burn keeps this from being incredible. ABV keeps drinkability from being as high as the other scores- for drinakbility, I'll take the 6 or 8, both wonderful beers in themselves.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Every sip left a ring of lace on the glass that formed a curtain of lace that extended to the bottom of the St. Bernardus chalice.  Smell: This beer has some malty sweetness and a raisin/dried fruit smell that I couldn't quite place.  Taste: It has a complex but unexpected flavor. It strikes me as a liquorish, raisin, malty, and slightly warming flavor. It defiantly fell outside the average Belgian Abby-style ale. Very interesting.  Mouthfeel: was medium-heavy with moderate carbonation.  Drinkability: This beer feels like a ""lighter"" Belgian beer to the palate, even though it is not.

I detect some citrusy flavors and something else that I can't identify, but the weird salty/acidic flavors are overpowering everything else.  M: Full bodied with a sticky texture.  D: I tried this once before and didn't care for it much, but I bought it again hoping that I got a bad bottle. Nope. I've enjoyed every other Belgian that I've had, so I'm a little perplexed as to why this one tastes so different to me.

The aroma is very busy -- the things that jump out at me are clove, candi sugar, and a bit of sour apple. Maybe a bit of raisin, too, and definitely some heavy alcohol fumes. Taste is, again, complex, with the cloves asserting themselves once again. Alongside the cloves are two main kinds of sweetness: one a kind of figgy, fruity sweetness, and one straight candi sugar. The high alcohol content comes through in a kind of vodka-ish, peppery aftertaste. This beer goes down very thick -- it's hugely rich and something you want to sip, not gulp.

There is a lot more going on, but I can't think of how to describe it because it's very complex and I'm a belgian novice. Alcohol comes on strong in the end.  Nice creamy but slick medium body.

Kindof a citrusy, vinegar and alcohol smell going on here. I'm getting worried...  T- And my worries were assuaged by the richness and complexity of the taste. Full of dark malt with loads of sweetness. The alcohol adds a nice warming spiciness to the beer. Never have I had a beer where the smell and taste were so completely different.

Once it calmed down there was a bubbly lacing left on the glass.  Smell  Smell is complex. Its hard to pick out what Im smelling. Definitely smells of spice, dark fruits, and Belgian yeast. The strong alcohol scent is there as well.  Taste  The alcohol makes itself known almost instantly, but not in a bad way. The fruity flavor of this beer is wonderful. Tastes of currants or something of the sort. Spice and black licorice also come about. I cant think of anything but a perfect five for this category.  Mouthfeel  There is a lot of carbonation in this beer. Hits hard but suits the beer and its style. The body on this beer is great as well and it goes down oh so smooth.

Some indeterminate spices, raisins, some smoky musty element that is not altogether welcome. The alcohol flavors are masked well but still detectable. Improves as it warms but almost, almost one-dimensional, especially for a Belgian ale.  Mouthfeel is smooth, full-bodied, near syrupy. Borderline cloying, which definitely hurts its drinkability.

Well here it is... lets see if this brew holds up under scrutiny.  Let me first say that this is one of the most active beers I've ever seen. I poured this brew VERY gently, and the head still takes up over half my glass. That being said, the color is a nice ruddy ruby brown... almost opaque, but just barely transparent. As I mentioned, huge head... big and rocky and cream-colored.... monstrous gobs of lace.... a thing of beauty. Large chunks of sediment are battered around by the rising carbonation before settling to the bottom.  There is a musty nuttiness to the aroma... very interesting. Along with that, dark fruit, some pear, perhaps some fig. Malty backbone... barely perceptibe alcohol.  Wow.. a truly unique beer. I think that was my first thought last time I tried this brew as well. Wildly complex... I could sit and think about this beer for hours.... but I wont. The alcohol comes out a bit more in the flavour, but not in an offensive way. A surpising amount of citrus, but then again, it seems as if every drop on the palate brings about a new, previously unnoticed taste. Nutty, malty, and yeasty. What a gorgeous flavour.  Crisp, but moderately thick at the same time. I expected it to be much more astringent and bitter on the tongue after I saw what happened when I was pouring it, but it is surprisingly subdued on the palate. Quite nice.  Perhaps THE most drinkable 10% brew I have ever tasted. While the alcohol is noticeable, it only serves to add to the experience. Unlike many imperial stouts, there is not a significant amount of thickness to the liquid to impair drinkability. All in all... a experience.... an absolutely amazing beer.... and here's the kicker... I'm not even particularly fond of Belgians.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Head is moderate, but dissipates fairly quickly, leaving a good amount of lacing. The aroma at first is dominated by sweet flowers, honeysuckles, and brown sugar.  The palate of this beer displays some amazing complexity, mixing flavors of brown sugar, pineaple, maple, caramel all in a thick, syrupy beautiful beer. The flavors coat your mouth, and linger for a long time, allowing you to savor and discover all the complexities of the flavor profile.  Simply, one of my favorite beers.

Some light gets through, which shows its cloudyness. Nice 1 1/2 inch head rises from the glass. Thick lacing.  Smells so very good. sweet spiced fruits come up first, i get apple, a little banana (with cloves), and slight raison. Its a little lighter than what i remembered, but great. A very nice sweet smell too i might add.  Taste. Sensational. again, sweet but has a little amount of tartness i dont remember, and almost doenst seem like it belongs. I get dried plums at first. As it sits on my tongue i get a white wine, or better yet a champagne taste and mouthfeel to it. Alcohol is slightly present, but is masked very well. I love the complexity of this beer. As it warms, more and more flavors come out. Roasted malts come through.  Mouthfeel is great. Good carbonation. Excellent balance. So full, and yet so slick on my tongue.  Overall, just one of the finest beers around. I could have this all day long (well, until i pass out) and not get tire of the complexities. However, i dont feel this bottle represents what i have had before (or maybe its just me tonight). Great stuff.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,SaCkErZ9,4.35,"Poured from an 11.2oz bottle into a St Berny chalice. Dark cocoa colored beer with a one finger sized head that leaves pretty quickly and leaves generous lacing. Not much light penetrates this beer. Little bits of yeasties floating on top.  Smell is quite nice. Yeast, very bubble gummy. Lots of dark caramel. Nice.  Up front is a sweet taste with some big malty flavors. Alcohol is quite subdued but present.  Nice big body on this one and great drinkability. I think I could have about 3 of these and feel alright. Nice beer.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Franchise,4.5,"Wow, this is my second time having this beer and it was just as I remembered so delicious so smooth. This quad pours a dark ruby brown and leaves a thin tan lace that sticks to the glass and stays with the brew. The aromas is fruity esters, alcohal soaked dark fruit, caramel, brown sugar, very complex and literally makes you salivate. The taste is so complex, it starts dry and tangy with a slight vinos presence but more actually to rum or brandy. It then sweetens on your palate with a carmal malt feeling that then again brings you to more of a dark plum feel on the palate. Fantastic brew I would pair this beer with a fresh fruit plate to compliment the fruit in the beer.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Was really looking forward to it because of how highly it is rated on the site.  Good looking beer. pours like brandy almost but with some small head. looks sticky and reddish brown. Smells like alcohol at first, then kind of like corny malt liquorish. First couple of sips burn with the alcohol and you feel it diffuse into your tongue. then there was a fairly complex mishmash of flavors including prunes, malt, not-quite-ripe apples, and ethanol. I didnt actually think this lived up to its hype very well. too harsh and more than one would knock me on my ass. maybe it would be better cellared for a while but i'm not sure im going to give it that chance.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,babyhobbes,4.2,"So, I just had this earlier this evening on-tap and thought I'd have a bottle tonight to compare. Why? Because I can. My bottle was generously given to me by my bro, he is the man! I so wish he had been here for the on-tap experience. Ah, there will be other times.  Appearance is wonderful. This beer is dark amber,a kind of ruby brown with a hugh light cream colored head in the St. Bernardus chalice. Maybe the head is a bit larger than normal...as I was excited and pouring a bit fast. Head is sticking around...and leaving loads of lacing along the glass. Every sip reminds me of the missing beer.  Taste is not nearly as good as the on-tap version. I taste alcohol. Bitter alcohol. If I hadn't just had this in the bar I definitely wouldn't be as put off by it. Other than that, there is a malty sweetness, with cherry and raisins obvious.  Smell is the best part of the bottled version. The fruity qualities are apparent from a mile away. There is a slight sweet odor of bananas, cherries and raisins. (I really get a raisin feeling from this beer.) There is a malt odor and a very, very slight tinge of alcohol. The smell is vital for this beer and I think the tap version suffers somewhat in retrospect.  Mouthfeel is creamy and thick. There is a buring sensation down the throught and the experience is reminiscent of a decent port.  Drinkability is okay. The buring alcohol is wearing me down as drink this but the smell is so fantastic I just want more. It looks so good in the glass, I want another sip. Yet, each sip brings the burning edge of alcohol. It's so sad and yet so wonderful.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Nose is full of yeast, a nice doughiness, citrus fruits, and a slight peppery spiciness. Taste is a wonderful fruity malt, orange, pear, banana, mango, red apple, raisins--with hints of chocolate, caramel, and almonds, a slight grassy hoppiness--this is a superbly flavorful and complex beer. Full bodied with a medium carbonation and a velvety smooth feel. This is an exceptional beer, one of the best I've ever tasted, rivalling anything produced by any of the Trappist.

Smell is enjoyable, being a nice mixture of fruitiness, yeast, and dough-like notes. Taste presents itself with a pleasant fruitiness, that caresses the tiongue in an extraordinary manner.

Molasses, dark fruits (cherries, plums, raisins) with just a hint of alcohol to let you know it's in there. Taste is solid think molasses sweetness but is balanced out by the alcohol. Also some yeastiness that gives it some bread like flavors. Just a touch of nuttiness and spicyness.  Supper smooth going down. For a 10% beer it is incredible drinkable. This is damn near perfect.

There is a very bready malt feel to it and some candy sugar sweetness. Almost tastes like a spiced apple liqour. It does lack in some areas. The flavor intensity isnt quit as strong as Id like.

This is a terrific beer, but it just doesnt have the same complexities that are found in the westy... a very similar candied fruit taste dominates the front and end of the beer, while an overwhelming popuri fills the middle.

A singularly perfect head of medium thickness with vertical globs of foam crowns a pure brown, nearly opaque body, and imparts superhuman (superbeery?) lacing to the glass--it lingers on the glass like a heroin addict walks down the street. When swirled it makes freckles in the head.  Tastes came as a gestalt, but some individuation can be made: sugary, yeasty, malty, some alcohol, cherry, nutty, esthers present, general fruitiness but perhaps clementine, spicy, perhaps cayenne pepper...but whatever the specific tastes, the general gist is sublime.  Smoother than silk, peppy on the tongue, never cloying, never heavy, never lightbodied, and only overpowering in the same way horniness is overpowering, ya dig? A stupendous beer.

259,1708,PatYoda,4.16,"Pours a nice murky brown with lots of yeast. Ridiculously long lasting head coats your entire glass before you're done. Appearance is perfect for a quad. A bit too much alcohol in the smell, but nice otherwise. There's a lot of clove in there and definitely some spiced rum. The taste is much more complex, however. I sense clove (strongly - it could be a bit less spicy, but this, and the too strong alcohol flavor are my only complaints), doughty yeastiness, alcohol, cherry, and vinous flavors. Some cookie dough is also there. It's not as much of a malt bomb as Westvleteren 12. Note that despite other reviewers saying so, this is definitely not the same recipe as that beer. At one time it was after the brewery stopped contract brewing for St. Sixtus (1992) but since then the recipes have diverged greatly.  The winey aftertaste lingers for a few seconds then is gone. Mouthfeel is nothing special - medium bodied for the style, very carbonated, dry. Very drinkable. A bit overrated in my opinion, but a good beer nonetheless.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

It smells of some fruit that I cannot put my finger on. It definitely does not smell of citrus as experienced with most beers. There might also be a faint liquorice smell about it. The taste is quite similar to the smell. The fruit may be cherry. The mouthfeel is thick and the carbonation is even. It feels fantastic.

259,1708,budsboy,5,"I've grown quite familiar with this beer before reviewing it. Now, I'm so fond of it, the picture of the happy monk on the label is enough to brighten my day. (Oddly, he somewhat resembles my dearly departed father, ""Bud"").  Dark and muddy brown, voluminous head, leathery, tanned.  Thick, moist bready aroma with hints of exotic spice and alcohol. A distinctive smell. Musty, fruity, wet and beautiful.  Big malt backbone, banana and juicy dark fruit, a slow-growing fire in the gut builds to a fully engulfed blaze, then fades just as slowly as it came. A sharp pear-like fruitiness zaps the tounge before it fades to a gentle bitter aftertaste.  Full and smooth, meaty, chewy. A meal.  An adult beer. Not for guzzlers, amateurs, hipsters, liars, slackjaws, hippies, rednecks, punks, grabasses, politicians or cry-babies. Grabs you by the shirt and demands respect. The world's finest craftsmanship. It's not often you can appreciate the sweat and the beauty of such a thing at the same time. If I find a better beer, I fear I shall be dead. This is the pinnacle, the absolute tip of the spire.

259,1708,ChiSox05,4.83,"750ml, shot the cork off the ceiling fan, into the Christmas tree.  Ruby red that turns plum colored in the wider parts of the glass. Myriad columns of carbonation rush upward adding to and holding up a never fading inch thick head of off-white foam, releasing a fruity boozy smell. Something to look at in an over-sized wine glass. S-Familiar Belgian yeast smell mixed with a complex array of scents that could take some time to inventory. Caramel malt, raisins, no doubt about a dark, ripe fruit booze that had been living comfortably in its corked monk emblazoned bottle, now stretching out in the glass. Alcohol adds robustness to the brown sugar coated raisin, prune and plum and some spice too, black pepper or clove. Taste had a well blended plum sweetness. There are raisins, a booziness that is most similar to a smooth, fruit infused darker rum. Where many beers provide a great aroma fronting for a taste that is just co-existing, the taste of Abt 12 defines its greatness. Sweet and malty the whole way through, but without any cloying syrup characters. The finish is drying and alcoholic, which combined with its effervescence cleared the palate well. Left behind is a cinnamony raisin bread taste and a warm throat and belly. Can't wait for another to add to this review, so much to smell and taste at once. Another unique quality of this beer is that its high carbonation doesn't distract from the taste while still aiding in cleaning up the palate and complex flavors. Plus, it ensures a damn fine looking brew in the glass. For the definite high amount of sugar and malt within, it is nothing more than medium bodied. As far as the 10% goes, it will be noticed in the throat and stomach the entire trip. Texture is fizzy. D-Taking notes on this was tough, as all I wanted to do was sip it holding the glass with both hands, pour more, and repeat. All who tried it on Xmas day agreed it was different, complex and out and out good. Will buy another 750 or two next time I am at the store, kickass warming sensation provided by the 10%.

Foam stayed around for the whole glass, and left thin lacing. The body is almost black, held to the light it is a deep mahogany color. First smell is of dried fruits, dates or currants or plums. The aroma also has toffee and brown sugar or molasses. Even though it is 10% alcohol, there is no strong alcohol smell. Taste is full of more fruity raisins or prunes, with the alcohol warmth now coming through. Mouthfeel is thick and chewy and quite enjoyable, leaves a thin coating of flavors on the tongue.

This full bodied beer is packed with flavor. It begins with some sweet malt before fruity tastes of apple and raisin move in. Hints of spices (clove and pepper) blend in at the middle. Towards the end of each sip some alcohol and yeast greet the palate. It finishes somewhat tart leaving behind a rather fruity flavor.  This is a well balanced flavorful beer.

Tremendous beer, and westy 12 has little, maybe nothing on it.  Pours a garnet hued dull brown with a billowing beige head. Rocky all over, diminishing and lacing my glass to death. Aroma is intoxicating, nutty almond, brown sugar, soft plum, faint mint, clove, even slight banana. Taste is immediately almond and brown sugar then there's a flood of esters and burly molasses, drying through the finish leaving my palate aching in its wake.

Initial flavor is moderately sweet that lessens somewhat. More cherry and bread than the aroma indicated. The finish is long. This was lively on th etongue, more so than the draft version.

There was a a nice tan head that looked stoutish down into the Duvel tulip. It was lighter in color and more filtered than I expected.  The taste was intriguing but not as complex as the hype would have you believe; to me this is infinitely smooth and perfect at masking the taste of alcohol and also, nice and dried fruit/plum astringent in the finish;There was remarkable balance as well, with the taste remaining controlled and tight but stilll verging on port wine at times, bittersweet at other times.  So, it gets great marks for taste and drinkability, but the overall depth makes it miss the perfect mark, I must be a sucker for a less polished package when it comes to the filtering and flavor profile; I wouldn't possbly turn one down however...",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Smell: Notes of deep dried fruit. Hints of toasted bread... with a dab of honey on the top. Alcohol wafts through the complexities of this appealing smell. However, what truly lures me to the smell is the dried raisins and toffee combination. Mild phenols are noticable.  Taste: Bliss. The complexities from the smell carry right over to the taste. With a mild sense of alcohol. Up front there is a slight hint of roasted malts with a very small note of walnut and other deep and dark roasted nuts. Next comes the sweetness of dried fruits with paltry lingerings of mustic toffee covered raisins.  Mouthfeel: Slick and while comlex nothing overwhelms the palate. Your tongue will beg for more, as your mouth will not at be turned off by this beer. Perfect amount of carbonation.  Drinkability: At 10% this noble brew tests your drinking stamina.

The mouth feel was thin with little carbonation that worked well with the flavors.  I was really stunned by the alcohol in this beer. It was prominent, but not at all overpowering.

The alcohol is discernable in the aroma, with all components coming together to produce an inviting scent.  Taste: A backbone of sweet malts and fruit predominate. Again I'm reminded of mango, a sweet, succulent fruit flavor giving way to a mildly hoppy, but not bitter, finish. Intensely pleasing. A lot of complex sweetness; there are some hints of brown sugar. Delicious.  Mouthfeel: Full-bodied, aptly carbonated, and slightly numbing due to the 10% abv. Wonderful sensations.  Drinkability: The flavor is addicting. The only thing that prevents one from downing beer after beer is the alcohol content. Absolutely bliss when you're drinking it. What a beer should be.  Notes: This beer experience was unique. St. Bernardus Abt 12 has the power to relax you body and mind after only about half a beer. It is an absolute pleasure to partake of this masterpiece.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,counselor,4.8,"This is a truly great beer that defines the style. Pours a dark brown with a nice head. There are smells of dark sugary fruit, bread, nuts & leather. The mouthfeel is full and coats the tongue with fine bubbles and deep malt texture. The flavors from the malts and yeast dominate bring out flavors of nuts, plums, figs, cherry and fresh baked bread. Broad yeast profile imparting flavors of spice, nutmeg & vanilla. There is almost no hint of the alcohol in this beer. I had some biting Pecorino Romano cheese that really set off the flavors of this beer and made them new with each sip. Buy and enjoy this beer",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

A very loosely bubbled head at first retreats to a silky smooth membrane atop the beer.  Super complex nose. Apples, pears, cinammon, sherry, bubblegum, candy.  Tastes like port wine, brown sugar, cinammon. The alchohol shows a bit but it's not over powering.  Mouthfeel is a bit thin, alchoholic, carbonated.  A big daddy, a fireside sipper.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Scent is of sweet malts dark fruits, but the alcohol is king here.  Taste is huge malt character, dark fruits, molasses and alcohol. I can only pick up the hops in the finish which is dry and quite bitter. The bitterness lasts for a while after each sip. The taste is almost wine-like; fruitier than I would expect, but very solid.  Mouthfeel is definately full bodied, and smooth with lots of carbination of the small bubble variety, very nice.  Drinkability is above average for this huge beer. I could sip (and I do mean sip slowly) all night long..",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Realale,4.05,"Deep brownish with some burgundy highlights. Lovely light cocoa head hangs tight throughout leaving nice, if chunky lacing.  Nose is quite fruity initially, with a hearty dose of dried cherry, prune and raisin notes, more than ably supported by rich, yeasty fresh-baked dark bread. Some initial spicy hopiness seems to dissipate as the chalice warms. Malt continues to increase, though the dried fruits always provide the top notes.  Thinner than expected, but hides the alcohol better than the examples of Westy 12 I've had. Good intensity on the palate with both the dark, dried fruit notes and the dark bready malt taking their expected places at the front of the line. There's some good yeastiness as well, but it's subdued. Quite well-balanced and restrained, though a touch sweet. Definitely more my style than Westy 12.  Length is rather remarkable, with the intensity of flavor continuing throughout. Mouthfeel is nice, with a relatively low carbonation letting the weight of the malt give a really rounded, velvety impression. Sweetness rounds it out nicely. Perilously drinkable for what it is, and a favorite of the style for me.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Applesauce1,3.68,"Bought my first quadrupel ever at the From the Vine Beer Store in Lewis Center, Ohio. Poured into my buddy's stein and got almost a 2 inch head (probably from sitting on its side while I was driving). Color: dark copper Smell: grape juice with maybe some bitter apple cider Taste: good, but nothing outstanding (a little too strong for my liking); it wasn't as strong as a barleywine though; also i noticed a wine type flavor  Overall, this is a good beer, as some of buddy's took sips and enjoyed it.

259,1708,akorsak,4.7,"I am drinking from a 750mL bottle in a Watou chalice.  Appearance: This is a dark ale, very hazy and ruby in color (when held up to light). There is also a nice smattering of yeast particles, as I did not filter the last few ounces.  Smell: A very heady smell, I can detect the high alcohol content. I also can clearly smell the malts used in the brew, imparting a wonderful scent that I just can't place.  Taste: Wow! The taste is incredible. I think that I detect some raisiny tastes that mix well with the malts and alcohol. A truly divine brew.  Mouthfeel: The high alcohol sterilizes the mouth a bit. There is a nice mixture of flavors that sit nicely on the palate.  Drinkability: Very drinkable. It fits nicely into the quad family, not too malty but not too high in alcohol taste.  I highly recommend this beer, especially from the 750mL corked and caged bottles (nice screen printing on the bottles too) and it sits firmly in my top five beers list.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

The sweet caramel elements become more eveident in the flavor, along with additional notes of very mild toasted oak, vanilla, plums, and other dark fruit. Not a great deal of alcohol presence. Complex, yet easy drinking.

Smell: This beer smells of clove spicyness and waves of malty fruity sweetness.  Taste: This is just bliss in a glass. The beer has strong clove intial taste. The next thing you taste is waves upon waves of malty sweetness.  Mouthfeel: Very full bodied not so carbonated beer.  Drinkability: This beer is just fantastic.

I did not find it to be particularly complicated or interesting and yet I didnt mind this in the slightest. St. Bernies 12 just tastes so good that I dont care if its not much more than boat loads of sweet rich malts. To me, this is just about a perfect beer.

The happy monk label on the bottle is pretty low budget but the beer itself is straight from beer-shambala. It poured with a nice dark blue-red color with brownish head that settled down to a finger. The complex flowery smell reminded me of cheap, artificially flavoured soft candy. The taste is actually a lot like traditional Swedish Christmas must but with a lot more alcohol. Some dry hops emerging in the aftertaste, biting the cheeks. Don't try to drink another brand during the same session!",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Maintains a half inch head through out drinking.  Smell is plum with a hint of brown sugar. Hard to take your nose from the glass.  Taste is immensly complex and satisfying. Malt, yeast, old world hops, brown sugar all combine with faint fruity undertones, certainly some bannana in there. Alcohol is definetely here but not overpowering and warms up the beer nicely. Wow, there is too much here to grasp with just one 11.2 ounce bottle. I'll have to review this one again to get a better grip.  This beer is fantastic, certainly deserving of the praise sung by other BA's. I still think Rochefort 10 is my favorite, but this one makes the short list of best in the world. I plan to come back to it shortly.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

The smell was fruity with plum notes taking center stage but it was more of a subtle aroma than I expected.  The taste is a mix of fruit, more of the plum and some banana with a faint clove presence. Yum. This is wonderfully balanced brew that does a nice job of warming *and* doesn't let the alcohol interfere with the flavours' symphonic melody.

It pours a murky deep brown with hints of red. The head is creamy and tan, incredibly dense like all st Bernardus beers tend to be. Lacing is numerous patches and crags. The aroma is bready malts with spices, licorice and a bit of complimentary spicey alcohol. The taste is a complex melieu of thick doughy malts, spices, licorice, plums and peppery alcohol. The mouthfeel is super thick and slightly numbing from the alcohol. The finish is very long and full of malts, alcohol and even a bit of hops.  This is a great beer, full of complex flavors and deceptively smooth for 10 percent. Its worth a try. world class but still no Westy 12.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Beautiful nose of plums, vanilla and ripe fruit.  Sweet brown sugar flavors blend with a thick malty backbone. Clovey and spicy with it's own unique identity. Dark fruits and syrupy liquid sugars please my palate. I can't think of to many other beers that have such a creamy and complex mouthfeel. Pure quality and brewed to perfection.  The drinkability level is beyond good, not to mention it's 10.0% ABV. Each gentle sip is more enjoyable than the next. A world class beer and clearly recommended.

I have previously only had this in the small 11.2oz bottles, and, while it was very good, it was more flavorful on-tap...I have not ruled out that the bottles I had were possibly a bit tainted due to handling/shipping/exposure, etc..  Anyways..that's not important...on to the good stuff. This beer is nothing short of majestic. Always touted as one of the best beers in the world, and now I believe it. Served in a tulip-style glass. Dark brown, rich ruby color with a very large, frothy, immovable head. Yeasty sediment is suspended in the glass and the lacing forms in sheets. Aroma & taste are huge and complex..big brown sugar flavors & rich malts blend perfectly with the subtle and amazing array of spices. Full mouthfeel..little carbonation. The 10% alcohol is hardly even a thought as you're drinking it. Just an outstanding beer, and one every beer lover should enjoy.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,EStreet20,4.58,"Been looking forward tot his one for a while. My St Bernardus chalice came in the mail today so I figured I should break it out tonight.  750 ml glass bottle poured into my brand new St Bernardus chalice.  Holy Carbonation!!!!. Just had my first ""self opening"" bottle. As soon as I removed the cage I placed the bottle down on my desk. I then saw the cork begin to slide upward. Luckily I was able to make a pretty sweet grab and cath the cork an inch or two from the bottle as it popped off, thus eliminating any risk to my ceiling light.  A - Poured out a dark brown with a huge (Slightly bigger than two fingers) fluffy off white head. A nice looking beer. The head is extremely foamy and leaves rings of lace on the glass.  S - A big fruity aroma, heavy on the malt. Definitely what you expect froma high quality Quad. A tiny bit of spiciness in there too, I don't want to say peppery but a little kick in the nose on the spicy side.  T - Wow, bottoms up. A nice malty taste that is balanced nicely by some flavors of dark bread. Some nice fruits in there too, a touch of grapes, some plums (I swear that's what I'm tasting) and perhaps a tiny hint of banana. A nice alchohol kick peaks out just enough to compliment all of the other flavors but is in no way offensive. Finally, A tiny bit of a peppery spiciness on the back of the tongue. Excellent.  M - Feels extremely smooth. Runs all over the mouth with an almost creamy texture. Definitely one to savor.  D - Each sip leaves you wanting more. By far the most drinkable quad I've ever had, and overall one of the best beers I've ever tasted.  Notes: Glad that glass came today, because I wasn't going to drink tonight. However now I'm just going to pop a movie in and sip on this one for a while.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,macpapi,4.77,"A nice 750 of this classic beer was the best birthday gift I received this year. After taking my time sampling and digesting this heavenly brew, I was fully able to appreciate its complexity and balance. Did not disappoint in any way at all.  Abt 12 pours a murky brownish red color with a full and puffy tannish head. Very impressive lacing is left behind on the sides of the glass.  Smells very sweet. Along with the regular malt and yeast one would expect of the quad style, there seems to be a medley of strong, deep and dark fruits. Plums, raisins, apples are all there. Very well balanced. Tremendously impressive on the nose!!  As far as taste goes, I must say the dark side has beckoned. This beer packs an absolutely incredible flavor. Fullness and great body are at its core. All that is in the smell is present in the swallow. But the complexity that is required to balance such a mix of flavors has taken me aback. The ten percent abv is noted with a sharp burn, which makes this a sipper. This sensation takes absolutely nothing away from an incredible taste.  In the mouth, St. B. 12 is full and burning. Every part of the palate is fully engaged with this brew.  Overall this is by far one of the best beers I've ever had in my life. The balance and complexity in the mouth is rave worthy. I've been looking forward to trying this well promoted Belgian for some time now, and am looking extremely forward to drinking it again.

So complex, its hard for me to pin down the specific flavor components. The best I can describe it: a lightly nutty, dark fruit-oriented flavor. This is some good stuff. Very rich.  The mouthfeel is perfect: light carbonation and a creamy body.  The drinkability of this beer is very good. The alcohol is pretty much nonexistent is a sea of flavor.

I did pour some sediment in as well.  The smell is very rich and so complex. Notable malt with a plum aroma. A strictly Belgium smell with limited phenol accents. Very nice.  The taste is malt first. Complex malt taste with sweeter bread type qualities. Some cinnamon and fig tastes. Very rich and smooth to boot. Really this reminds me of a liquid cinnamon roll. The Belgium taste is noticeable as well. The plum flavor and banana twinge mixes well with the malt. It becomes more noticeable, as does the spice flavor, as it warms.  The beer is just smooth.

The beer seems somewhat viscous but not overdone. I can detect dark fruits, alcohol, bread, figs, and some plum aromas. Very interesting and unique even for this style. The taste is just incredible; playful bitterness upfront with a strong, sweet malt finish that is dry and rich. A bit of warming alcohol sensation as well. Takes more like a Dubbel than a Quadrupel in terms of being an 'acquired' taste. As the beer warms, more complex and rich flavors become apparent; some spices seem to appear and linger in the aftertaste. Some roasted characteristics seem to prevail as well as the beer warms. The most incredible thing about this beer is that it is very very drinkable; the alcohol doesn't make itself known until after a glass or two.

Various flavors of different fruits, depending on the tempature of the beer. As it warms, the flavor changes.  Carbonation that is just right. Nice and creamy mouth. Big and bold.

Drinking it is a joy, because as I work my way through the glass, it is a struggle to try to figure out what flavors are coming through.

A very impressive-looking beer. By the look alone, you can tell this beer is one to be reckoned with.  Smell - Complex with hints of sweet mollases, currants, raisins, and a solid malty foundation. Not overly sweet, but very complex and rich.  Taste - Warm and rich with an incredible toffee and dare I say, coconut-like nutty flavor. This beer is tremendous. The mollasses character lingers on the tongue and finishes with a terrific alcohol warmth.  Mouthfeel - substantial and warming, as expected. A great example of how subtle, yet assertive, a quadruple can be. To me, this is the standard by which the style ought to be measured. Not cloying, or overly sweet, this one is well balanced, smooth, and quite complex in every respect.  Drinkability - Being a quad, it's not something you wanna slam down ... definitely a beer to savor and appreciate for it's impressive complexity.

259,1708,Golden2wenty1,4.47,"Picked up a single at Riley's here in Madison. Something a little special for review #150.  Pours a dark, murky, reddish brown with lots of clumpy yeast sediment floating about, a finger of khaki head that looks like capuccino with cinnamon with dark yeast floating in the foam. Wasn't sure if this was right, but reading other reviews it seems standard. Smells strongly of dark fruits, sweet roasted malt, and alcoholic vapors. Taste starts off with raisins, vinuous overripe grapes, banana esters, loads of spicy, brown sugary malts, and a hearty warming alcohol flush. Mouthfeel is smooth but crisp. A nice, complex Belgian here. Reminds me more of a Belgian Strong Dark Ale than a Quad, but either way, a top notch brew worth seeking out.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Sephiroth,4.94,"Poured into a tulip, this is one foamy beer. It is a beautiful deep ruby, with chunks of yeast, despite my careful pour. The label said to consume by the end of 2004.  The nose reminds me of 98 Harvest Ale from J.W. Lees. Raisins, cherries, and dried figs abound. Tobacco and slight anise, maybe some hops. The taste is rich. Everything I described in the nose is there in the taste. The fruits hit first, followed by dryness. The warming in my throat must be from the ABV. Liquid bread, this is.  The mouthfeel is silky and carbonated. It has that feel of an aged beer. Thick and heavy, but not coating. I could drink many of these as long as I didn't eat. Like I said, liquid bread.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,rhoadsrage,4.88,"(Served in a tulip glass)  A-This beer had a nice dark brown body with a creamy tan head. It had good lacing with each sip.  S- Notes of dark malt and raisins with some sweetness and caramel notes.  T- The taste of dark sweet malt was very complex. flavors of prune brown sugar, caramel and some nice faint alcohol warmth at the finish. As it warmed it gave more depth with some cidery and vinous notes also.  M- Medium-light mouthfeel with a medium alcohol warmth. No astringency or fizz.  D-Wow. This beer is bold and complex in flavor but nice and light in mouthfeel. The alcohol warmth is not overpowering and really balances the complexity of the malts. I will take another.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,BEERchitect,4.8,"With ultimate succulent sweetness, robust wine-like tartness, and a gauntlet of flavors that reach the taste buds from multiple angles and with an array of characteristics, this is an epic beer for the ages!  Delivered in a wide lipped, oversized bulb of a wine glass, adorned with the brewery's logo, this is the glass that deserves the beverage. The russet brown beer with burgundy hues carries a mild haze with a deep sheen. Tightly knit head character gives early impressions of thick blanket, yet late impressions are of a rich espresso-like creme. Fantastic retention and a generous allocation of sticky lace leaves intricate lacing patterns on the glass. A most inviting beer.  Rich berry-like aromas are tart, savory, and vibrant. Backed by the succulent sweet notion of cotton candy, caramelized sugars, vinous wine-like character, orange peel, corriander, and grape, this classy ale courts the nose with pin-point seductive response.  Flavors are much more concentrated than the somewhat tame nose suggests. Richly underplayed malts give a nondescript sweetness to the beer that when combined with alcohol delivers a deceptively light powdered sugar sweetness, slight chocolate, brown sugar, and elegant strength. Yeasty esters of grape, plumb, cherry, dates, figs, licorice, and apples all feed into the fruity complexities. Spicy notes replace hop bitterness with mellow white and black peppercorns, light smoke, and alspice with alcohol. Vibrant and bright, but not without the needed aged notes to suggest maturity, this fresh version satisfies just fine.  Rich and succulent, the first sips give a medium creamy notion but a dense weight to the tengemental senses before making a procession across mid palate and marching toward sweet warmth, semi-sweet finish, and a sultry aftertaste of fruit, alcohol, and whimsy sweetness.  This is a masterfully crafted ale that seduces the seneses with each and every sip. Keeping stride with the Westvleterens and Rocheforts, this beer plays no such second fiddel.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Melchizedek,4.75,"Wow.  Pours a deep brown; it's clear, but kind of looks hazy because of the constantly streaming bubbles. Rocky head is massive and enduring, leaving rings and clumps all down the sides of the glass.  The aroma is comparable to the one or two better red wines I've gotten to try, only better. Alcohol is a presence, carrying with it some buttery caramel, nut, and mellow fruit aromas--I'm reminded of oatmeal with raisins and brown sugar, and maybe some other spices I can't quite identify. The mouthfeel is surprisingly light, given the character of the flavor, but just right. The carbonation helps with this, giving a foamy texture on the tongue. The alcohol is obvious but not overpowering, even compared to smaller brews; ""rich and smooth"" doesn't begin to describe the flavor, which delivers the promised buttery notes and strong, slightly roasted/smoky malts. There's enough bitterness to keep it from being too saccharine, although hops were hard to distinguish apart from some mineral/earthy flavors and maybe a bit of pine sap toawards the finish. I think there's a bit of anise to it too, although I'd want to sniff a bit to compare; the alcohol carries with it a lot of spiciness.  I don't think I'm quite worthy to catalogue all the complexity of this stuff. I couldn't resist pouring another glass, even though it was a school night; that should say enough. Delicious.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,silver0rlead,4.4,"Pours into my chimay chalice a murky dark brown with a ruby tint and a thick off-white head that retains well and coats the sides of the glass. The aroma is intense and complex, notes of cherry, candied sugar, plum, fig, date, barnyard, toasted bread, light spices, grassy hops, slight vinegar sourness and some light phenols and alcohol. Flavor begins with some lightly tart fruit (real cherries, fig, date, plum and raisins), then some candied sugar sweetness, spices (clove, corriander, anise), malty toasted bread, some light phenols, vinous alcohol character and some light grassy and floral hops. The body on this beer is huge, with light carbonation and a creamy but thick texture with some moderate alcohol tones coming through. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and it was fairly easy to drink despite its high abv. This beer is definately an experience in a bottle, delicious and heavy it meets my high expectations.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Noxious26,3.91,"330ml bottle poured in a tulip glass. Best Before date 27 04 10. I sure hope that means 27 April 2010.  Dark, murky, red-brown amber colour. 3/4 inch dark beige head has some sediment sitting on top of it. Head is very dense with small bubbles. Head stays solid to the end of the glass. Lots of carbonation bubbles streaming up. Also lots of suspended particles and sediment on the bottom. Big clumps of lacing hang on the sides of the glass.  The most prominent attribute of the aroma is a strong winey alcohol character. Background aspects of various sweetness (dried fruits and malts).  The taste is dominated by an obvious alcohol presence. Very much reminds me of drinking a dry wine. Ripe fruit, dried fruit and rich malt flavours comprise the sweet background that slowly takes the forefront as the alcohol fades. A dry finish causes the back of the throat to feel tight. Aftertaste is likewise dry.  Medium bodied with mild carbonation. A thick buttery feeling is left in the mouth after the swallow.  This is a good beer, but not a great one in my opinion. The strong alcohol detracts from the rest of the flavours and the dryness left in the mouth really isn't satisfying and is annoying after awhile. Really left me thinking that I was drinking a dry wine instead of a beer.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Rich aroma. Spice cake. Big toffee. Dark fruit (plums). Even citrus mingles around in this outstanding mixture of aromas.  Yeast, spice, fruit, caramel & toffee. Alcohol, brown sugar and some orange peel deep down in there. Everything intensifies as this beer warms a little. Very impressive.  Full-bodied and very rich. The long-lasting head adds to the creamy mouthfeel. Silky smooth. Good carbonation. Nice warming effect. Slight sweetness in the finish.

Smells Belgian. T: Full, rich taste. Some fruity. I don't get much malt. Pleasant alcohol burn in the finish. M: Again, full. Coats the tongue. Finishes dry.

259,1708,waldowin,4.27,"This beer was definitely a tasty treat.  It poured a reddish amber, not terribly dark, with a massive head that just stuck around for days. Smelled a bit like fruit, and very strongly of oak.  Tasted very good. Tons of malt up front, hops are almost non-existant. I should have let the whole thing warm up more before drinking it, as it approached room temperature the flavors really came out. It ended up being a very fruity taste, with bananas, raisins, and dates very heavy. Very tasty beer.  It felt like a very thick beer when consuming, however, and that made it a bit hard to drink much of. You really feel like you're taking a swallow of beer and two swallows of a very rich dessert.  I had to dock the drinkability because it's just so hard to drink this beer in any real quantity. I split a 25oz bottle with a friend, and it still took us about an hour to finish our beers at a comfortable pace. It's just a very rich beer. Definitely tasty thought. The alcohol really hides itself in this beer well. There's no ""bite"" to it at all, extremely smooth.  This beer would be good as a dessert beer, but not a session drink, just way too thick to drink much of. Very tasty brew, much thanks to Lrrr for hooking me up.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Bumpon10s,3.96,"A - Pours a slightly thick, nuttly brown a little bit of thick head that never quits and clustering retention.  S - Slight fruit and spice, good amount of alcohol. The aroma isn't nearly as strong as I thought it was going to be.  T - Fruits, nuts, a little spice. Doesn't taste like 10% ABV, but you can tell it's there.  M - It pops on the tongue with it's continuing carbonation, the bubbles just kept coming on this one.  D - It might gain lower marks from high carbonation and high alcohol. At the very least, it is a low price for a good Quadrupel.  I've had it on tap, and I am writing this review from a bottle. The bottle seems a bit more tame then when I tried it on tap. I was expecting a little more power, and it wasn't really delivering, could have mistaked it for a dubbel, but maybe I had an off bottle.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Perfect lacing as I went along. Aroma took a while to coax out as I belieive they had the keg on cold in the interest of preservation. Sweet and fruity, plum aromas ... nothing over the top.  This brew really shines in the mouth. Silky yet well rounded, I couldn't pick up the strong alcochol. That could be the downside for me!  Drinkable as much as my budget permits.  I will be seeking out other Quads to get some reference points.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

My tasting notes are the same as my bottle review (http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/259/1708/?ba=EPseja) but with these exceptions:  S - The smell on the tap version seemed just a touch muted compared to the bottle version. I thought It might be because it was too cold, but even as it warmed, it didn't expand much.  T - Everything about the taste is as mentioned in my bottle review, but all of the fruity notes had a freshness, ripeness, and juiciness that was out of this world. Also, a fantastic fresh-baked date-nut bread character was evident. Lastly, the very few alcohol notes that did show (especially when I was concentrating on them) possessed a sweet Maneschewitz wine quality that blended in very well with the rest of the drink.  D - To steal a quote from the great Michael Jackson, this beer is ""dangerously drinkable"". It's got everything a quad needs to have the drinker going ""mmm"" after each sip.

259,1708,Frozensoul327,4.82,"This is an awesome brew. Truely amazing beer in every aspect. Poured out to a dark cider color, but is more auburn when held to the light. Nice, cream colored head, about 1/2 an inch and consistant to the bottom of the glass. Medium low carbonation. Aromas of yeast, malt, and some sweetness. All around very rich and full. Taste is delectible... flavors of dark fruits, malt, some earthy notes. Smooth and slightly sweet and bitter towards the finish. Some alcohol is noted, but it doesn't indicate the 10%ABV this brew has. Medium body mouthfeel is smooth like velvet, and slightly creamy. Very good drinkability. I could have this morning noon and night. Highly recommended.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

T - Molasses malt with a slight diacetyl. As with the smell, the alcohol dominants the taste. It is lacking in depth, for a 10% abv, it really should have masked its alcohol better than this.  M - Best part of the beer, absurdly smooth and a little thin. Slightly drying, but tolerable.  D - If alcohol flavor doesn't bother you too much, than this is a drinkable beer. But it is very lacking all around. A big disappointment. Rocheforte 10 is much better, and I didn't even like that too much.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

259,1708,scooter231,4.38,"Had this and Westy 12 together for a proper comparison. This guy poured a dark brown color with red tints in the background, with a tannish head that stuck around for quite a while- color is allllmost opaque.  Smell is of light raisins, chocolate and vanilla, with some coffee/espresso at the very end of the whiff. Lovely. Taste is coffee and raisins, with a twing of caramel in the end, maybe some sweet malt? Definitely a wave of sweet brown sugar in there. A tad, tad bitter. The sweetness is well-balanced and the flavor seems... bright, alive. It's really quite a tasty thing.  Mouthfeel is bubbley, chewy, full, and smooth. Something to savor. Quite drinkable- the alcohol content is well-hidden, though you certainly start feeling the warming sensation after a few sips.  Overall, I think this is a lovely beer, bright and very striking flavors, but compared to Westy 12... well, W12 is more mature-tasting, harmonized, and I feel overall a better tasting brew. I'd definitely get this again though. And again...",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

There isn't a dime's worth of difference in taste between this beer and Westy 12. I just did a vertical tasting with a friend, so I'm saying this with confidence. There may be differences depending on freshness and how it was stored, but if you aren't visiting the monastary in Belgium, you should probably care little.  There is more than a dime's difference in price. I bought this bottle for 5 bucks less than Westy 12. Same plum, molases, and chocalate flavors.  Other notes: murky brown and cloudy. Belgian yeast esters on nose. Very smooth.  World-class beer and a great quad.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,kbub6f,4.45,"Reviewed side-by-side with Westy 12.  The head is dense and a little lighter and smaller than the W12. The beer shows more brown, less red and a little lighter. The nose is tangier, more fruity, with less of the toffee/caramel malt. Tangy fruit in front. Nice, deep toffee malt in the middle, but not quite as much butter. The alcohol in the finish is a little metallic. Not as smooth as the W: more woody and apple-y. This is still an outstanding beer. Side-by-side with the Westy, it seems a little raw: not as smooth and buttery/malty/bready. But delicious, no doubt.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,SkeeterHawk,4.87,"Appearance: Pours a pretty cloudy deep mahogany color with a huge creamy head at first pour that looks like it has no intention of falling anytime soon. I haven't even gotten to taste the beer yet, and it already has laced the heck out of the glass. The only thing that I could say is that it could be transparent.  Aroma: Wow! I get all kinds of stuff. I get a rich sweet sugary presence that mingles with flowers and some mild citrus fruit. This is through the foam! There are spicy notes along with a rich molasses-like note. As the head falls a bit, you can smell more of a bready aroma  Taste: The first thing that hits me is plum. This beer is aggressively carbonated, so the fizz keeps your palate guessing. There is lots of everything in here. There are some rich caramel notes to the flavor while having a slighly roasty/nutty impression. All this mixed with some not so subtle spiciness. The entire profile is a ride! You have to be careful how much you swirl this beer so you can give your palate a chance to taste it; otherwise, it fizzes up and you are too busy trying to swallow without foaming over. This is incredible! There is so much going on in here. You somehow start out with the sweetness from the caramel and sugars. You then somehow transition to tasting a fruit basket filled with plums, raisins, and a bit of grapefruit. After all this goes on, the mouthfeel carries all of this down to your gullet with only the soft warming in the back of the throat from the alcohol. Excellent!  Opinion: So what can I say? This beer is fabulous! It is a monument of the complexity of beer and what a subtle blend can do. I only took a tad off for drinkability because you can tell that it is huge. It's not for the faint of palate...but not as bad as Arrogant Bastard! This is a beautiful beer!",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Brian700,4.38,This beer poured a dark brown with a tan head that was nice and creamy and lasted for quite a while. There was a lot of lacing going on.  The smell is of figs and molasses and there is also a small amount of citrus underneath it all.  The taste is also of figs and other darker variety fruit with a molasses-like sweetness and alcohol leaving almost a citrus flavor on the breath.  The mouthfeel is full bodied with medium carbonation.  This is a great beer and is very drinkable. I highly recommend it.,Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,FirstMan,4.25,"After all the hype that I've heard about this beer - especially here on BA, I must admit I was a little underwhelmed when I tried this for the first time last night. Probably I just raised the bar too high, but frankly there are a number of American beers that I would go for before trying this again... (blaspheme, for many of you, I know).  That said, this is definitely a world-class beer and sits high above most beers the average American will drink.  Pours a murkey, beautifully deep orangish-brown. Such a nice head of fluffy foam to gaze at, too. Eventually that head lingers down to little splotchy patches across the top of the liquid in the way that so many good Belgians do.  The nose is rich and complex. Cloves, ripe plums, raisins, and maybe a little tang of overripe orange in there. Subtle and changing. One of the great things about a Belgian is that you can often spend a lot of time just smelling them - oh, and the beer smells good too.  Clove and the tang of overripe fruit is the first thing to hit your mouth. This is very well balanced by the round, malty smoothness of the mouthfeel. This is a beer that lingers well and goes through many mysterious flavor changes as it ages on the palate.  Give this a try first at a colder temperature and then let it warm up. It's fun to notice the changes.  Overall a very good beer that's worth a try. I'd love to have it on tap, actually, because I imagine that will trump my rating of the bottled version.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,CortexBomb,4,"Pours out deep, burnt copper with an inch thick, dirty brown head that stands on top for some time, adding to the aroma which is of pears, white grapes, sweetness (sugary) and a touch of some dark fruits...very nice.  The flavour is very malty, even creamy up front. The fruits from the aroma, particularly the dark fruits are present in abundance, and there is a certain tart edge hanging around as well. The alcohol doesn't make itself known until the back end, and it comes with an interesting sour effect which offsets the opening. The alcohol becomes most apparent on the swallow, where you can taste it, and feel it going down. This is very solid, but not quite tops of the Belgians for me.  Mouthfeel is very full and creamy, nicely carbonated which feels right. The drinkability is rock solid as well.  Overall, I like this beer, but it's not quite the tour de force that I was expecting. It's very good, but not at the top of its class. I would gladly have one of these anytime though.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Where do you begin with this one? Mouthfeel is slightly astringent but not too harsh. Alcohol is evident in the finish. Taste is of fresh fruit, slightly acidic on the palate. The only thing that detracts from this brew is the dominant alcohol presence which lessens the drinkability. Still this deserves to be sipped, would be great on a winter day.

259,1708,elricorico,4.77,"Poured into a goblet. A funny thing happened, that I've never seen with a beer. The pour is a dark brown, with almost a violet hue. The pour resulted in a loose bubbly head, that faded away. However, over the past couple of minutes, the beer has generated a new head, that is thick and creamy. Very nice.  The smell is oh so fruity. Dark grapes and cranberry, raisin and plum. A faint whiff of alcohol and a suggestion of candy sugar. I'd say it is about the nicest smelling beer I've had.  The taste... well... so much there I don't think I could list it all, and I don't believe I have the skill to seperate it. It is sweet, but not overly so, and a bit tart in the finish. I can't say that I am able to detect hops, but with so much malt taste going on I'm not surprised. I'll leave others to tell what ingredients the flavour holds. I'll just say that it tastes good.  The mouthfeel is a tad coarse, at least that is what I find with this bottle. It is still pleasant, but I'd call the carbonation a little rougher than it I desire.  Is it drinkable? Well, it's certainly not a beer for chugging, but as far as a high alcohol beer goes, this is a sipper that keeps you coming back.  This is the highest rated beer I've had the chance to taste, and it only strengthens my faith in the BA community's skill at picking out a winner.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

259,1708,ikats,5,"This one need an introduction. Today I decided to stop by my favorite spot (The Collins Bar in New York) after work. I was looking for a pint or two of something with a lot of character, something to savor. A good stout perhaps. When I got to the place and reviewed current offerings, a line jumped out: ""Belgian: St. Bernardus 12"". Sounds good, I thought. And I'll tell you, I was not prepared for this ale. It was pure perfection in a glass!!! I couldn't stay for long, so from the bar straight to the nearest beer store I went. Picked up a couple of bottles which I am savoring right this minute.  Appearance: Dark brown color. Wonderful off-white head of significant size that leaves behind nice lacing.  Aroma: Maybe it's the picture of a monk on the bottle, but ""heavenly"" comes to mind. Sweet smells mix with hints of sour fruits. The aroma seems familiar, yet it is a challenge to identify all the components of this wonderful bouquet.  Taste: Maltiness and yeast, fruits and caramel, it's all there. Alcohol is there too, but it works with, not against, the richness of this ale. I think this is the first ale were alcohol taste was complimenting the rest. Makes me feel bad that I do not have enough experience describing all the intricacies of abbey ales. Well, this is not the last time I am drinking this ale, so I'll come back to it.  A noble drink. I think I am in love!!!  This abbey ale is presented in 11.2 oz brown bottle that lists both ""best before"" date and suggested serving temperature. Cheers to that!",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Lots of lacing and long retention. The bubbles are so tiny and creamy looking, so inviting.  Smell is sweet and malty, nice candy sugars. Dark fruit, old wood and alcohol.  In the taste I get hit with dark fruits and malts first. They are many mineral tastes (good) that I have only noticed in this and Westvleteren (which I am lucky enought to have tasted side by side) Not nearly as much alcohol in the taste as I thought there would be based on the nose. It't there though, don't get me wrong. There is a little nutty vanilla in there also, but it is passing as you warm up.  The feel of these beer is awesome, creamy and smooth (from those tiny bubbles I guess) and perfect body for the taste.

You don't really taste a lot of alxohol, but shortly will feel its affect.  I definately will be looking for more ot this !",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Smell was slightly sweet with dark fruit smells like raisons and dates mixing with some roasted malt odor.  Taste is very nice, semi sweet fruit flavors mixing with a slight roasted nuttiness and you can taste just a bit of the alcohol. Very Nice!  Mouthfeel is creamy, full, and very warming, perfect!

259,1708,kmpitz2,4.12,"I'm not sure what the freshness date is on this one. There is a mark at 7, 8 and 9 on the scale along the bottom. There is also a double-label thing going on. The bottle definately got hit with two labels.  It pours a deep murky brown color with a solid 2.5 finger head over top that falls very slowly. The nose is full on raisin and fig character, with a nice spicey character hiding in there as well. The flavor is subdued from the nose a bit. The yeast imparts a creamy character, on top of the sweet raisin and light brown sugar character. Very nice flavor. The feel is moderate, with a light carbonation. I'm finding it to be a sipping beer. Not something I can drink a whole lot of at a time. I like it. Definately not as good as the same beer off tap. I'll re-rate this one when I have it off tap again. Still a nice brew.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

The taste is a cross of fruit and choclate mixed with a ton of sweet malt and a touch of brown sugar. It is a brew for all to enjoy. The malty sweetness adds to the thick bready mouthfeel.

The nose is bready and yeasty with a notes of caramel, sweet vanilla, and delicate dark, dried fruit in the background.  The body is medium-full and it's creamy and a touch zesty in the mouth due to its very fine bubbled, somewhat effervescent carbonation.  The flavor is rich and full with sweet, soft dark fruits (plum, raisin); sweet, caramelish malt; and a touch of vanilla. The bitterness is restrained, but it remains balanced, helped in part by a splash of alcohol. It finishes dry with some lingering vanilla, caramel, and almond.  Quite nice!",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Cwrw,4.1,"This one is hard to approach without high expectations. St Bernardus, the jolly monk(and why not??) holding a chalice glass of the stuff on the label seems to exude glee, and the beer seems to as well. Abt 12, or the blue cap bottle, states simply in English on the back ""Bottle fermented beer."" This bottle poured with a medium head, making it able to pour the full bottle without having to wait for the foam to settle. I was expecting a denser head however, because it did not pour very creamily: more large bubbles than small. The head is a very lightish brown colour, and seemed comfortable and stable as a thin but full topping to the beer. The beer itself is an almost impenetrable ruby-dark brown, appearing near ebony from most angles. Lacing is excellent, leaving thin sheets around the glass that dissipate into islands. The aroma is not very assertive, but when coaxed it is quite delectable. Very sublte dark malting along with black currants and prunes. The sweetness is readily evident in the form of raisins and green apple peel like St Bernardus Tripel. Red wine and red grapes; blueberry; licorice and leather; pears and green apples; and spicy, rummy pepper that tickles the nose. This could almost pass at times for merlot or cabernet wine. A distinct creaminess asserts itself through the whole drink. The aroma is delicious, but not unlike anything I have had before; certainly nothing to make it exceptional for me personally. The taste is full of big flavours: spicy alcohol, rich malts, dark fruits and wine. The front of the tongue senses the red wine taste, tannic and dry. The middle draws out some of the toasted malts, and the finish leaves a balanced nuttiness, equal parts dry and sweet. The carbonation was a little high, and the bottle started to overflow when I popped the cap; not sure why. They have been sitting in my cellar for 2 weeks upright. Far too foamy in the mouth, this bottle. The mouthfeel is still quite thick and lingering however. Drinkability, with the balanced sweetness and small amount of alcohol in the taste, is extremely hight for a gravity such as this. I paired it with brie and 3-year aged cheddar. The brie is mostly overpowered by the beer, but the sharp taste of the aged cheddar could compete and added to the enjoyment and complexity of the beer. I fear these bottles may be a tad defective somehow; not totally, but I think the beer is not at its peak quality-wise. If it IS, though, I have tasted this beer's equal and find it good but not sensational or unique.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,IronDjinn,4.25,"Came in a 330 ml brown long neck Euro bottle as part of a 4 pack. So this is the famous Abt 12, I was happy to lay eyes on it locally.  Poured into a Karmeliet tulip glass, which induced a massive sticky light tan head, 4 fingers at least, with impressive retention. The appearance of the body is an opaque mahogany, bordering on black. Fruity vinuous notes on the nose, green grapes, sherry, fresh currants, with hints of the orchard in the way of peaches and plums and golden delicious apples. The aroma of thick malt can be found resting comfortably below all of this in the form of English toffee. It's all quite a wonderful combination, very light and refreshing aroma for a deep dark 10%abv Belgian.  The flavour doesn't disappoint either. It starts out with that chewy toffee malt, and then gets a direct infusion of raisins, prunes, green grapes and apples, the alcohol very apparent by the middle, converting the flavour and mouthfeel into a more vinuous sherry towards the dry finish, with a mouth puckering aftertaste from the dryness. It's a nice little trip this quadruple takes you on, not too long and not too much to see that you can't take it all in without craning your neck back and forth the whole way, it lets you enjoy it all at a comfortable, leisurely pace.  The mouthfeel starts out thick and chewy, but starts to thin out towards the very dry finish, leaving a sticky residue over the palate as a calling card.  Very fine stuff, I shall be investing in more, but only one at a time for me in a sitting, there's enough within a lone bottle to keep me satiated for the time being. The sign of a fine ale, you know you'd like another one, but it leaves you satisfied enough that you don't need it right now.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,BrewMaster,4.85,"Appearance: Pours a deep mahogony color with a rich and foamy tan head on top. As the head settles it becomes more creamy and looks almost like it has a thin skin on top. The head leaves excellent lacing on the sides.  Smell: Rich malty aroma with fruit scents of grape and green apple followed by a light alcohol smell. There are some caramel and toffee scents hiding in the buttery maltiness as well.  Taste: As I took my first sip my reaction was an out-loud exclamation to my wife that went something like, ""Holy shit this is a good beer."" I didn't expect garbage, but I also didn't expect something this good. Oh how I love pleasant surprises. The beer is terribly complex with massive fruitiness, sweetness, and kick ass maltiness. The fruits are very much like the nose with grapes and green apple but there is also a more berry-like character to the fruitiness. Black berries or raspberry seeds and even some cherries. The sweetness blends well with the malty. Caramel, toffee, and a bit of burnt brown sugar pour over a tangy and toasty malt. The maltiness is sweet and lightly floral with a distinct nuttiness (almond, walnut) and woody flavor. More dry grass and earthy bark and dry lemon tree leaves. The ending and aftertaste are sweet with the alcohol flavor and warmth showing up. The alcohol is not strong or burning, but light and it contributes a bit of candy-like sweetness to the aftertaste. That is a very well hidden 10%.  Mouthfeel: Incredibly smooth for such a full bodied beer. Sandy and comfortable. It leaves a light dryness in my mouth particularly on my gums.  Drinkability: Fabulous. Really, it's that good. I thought this beer may have been over hyped but that is not at all the case. This is a truly magnificent beer. There are no offensive or weird flavors. All of the flavors work well together making this a remarkably drinkable beer. All around this is a wonderful beer.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

This is the first time I've ever seen little yeast specs floating on top of the head... maybe this is because it's the first time I've poured an entire bottle of a sedimenty beverage into a glass. It looks really cool, as if someone sprinkled cinnamon or clove onto the head. Frills of bubbles slide up the glass... little yeast floaties are hangin out doing their thing in the beer itself. Has all the head and lacing you could ask of such a brew. Mysterious and noble in appearance. I'd like for flowers in the garden to smell like this does... creamy and fruity.

What an impressive melody of esters, phenolics... clove, spice, fruit, caramel, and just a little bit of hops...  The mouthfeel was outstanding too.

Big yeasty and fruity aroma as soon as I popped the cork. Very nice. Upon a closer nose examination I detect green apple, berries, rum cake, and faint raw alcohol.  Taste is earthy with fruit flavors. Grape, raisin, cherry, banana, clove spice. Finish is a short maltiness and much cleaner than expected. Maybe the slightest lingering hop bitterness.

The amount of lace this one leaves is ridiculous; it's just huge sheets of lace that make the glass completely opaque. It's fantastic.  Smell is complex with hints of rum-soaked raisins, alcohol, and fresh fruits. A little bit of clove in there as well, but just faint.  Taste is rich with dark fruit flavors with the same rum-soaked raisins and the very thick brown sugar flavors. The dark fruits come through as a sort of plum and currant flavor that is very pleasant. So much going on here, and it's just a sweet enough.  The mouthfeel could be a little thicker, I think, but that's the only thing I'd change about this one, and it's very nice as it is.

It was my reward to myself for finishing my first batch of homebrew, and it did not disappoint.  Deep, ruby and brown color with a perfect, thick, frothy head. I waited about 2 minutes and then poured the last few drops from the bottle which literally sat on top of the head and stained it brown at it trickled thru. Outstanding.  This is one of the best smelling beers, if not the best, that I have ever come across. Chocolate malts, berries, caramel to name a few. I literally went around my apartment to each of my roommate's rooms and made them take a whiff of it. Of course, each of them went, ""mmmm"" and then proceeded to grab it out of my hands and take a sip.  Of course, the taste was nothing short of amazing. All of the aromas in the aforementioned paragraph were represented in the flavor, so no need to repeat. Great, creamy mouthfeel from this full-bodied beer and the 10% ABV goes completely unnoticed.

Appearance: In my limited experience, this sets the standard for strong dark ales. A deep orange-brown color, almost completely opaque. The head never really disappears from the top of the beer.  Smell: This beer smells better than the smell of any other beer which my nose has smelled. Smells like fresh bread, with strong malty tones.  Taste: This is possibly the best-tasting beer I've tried to date. If I go fat and bald from drinking this beer, it's worth the price. God bless the monks from Westvleteren, who apparently created the recipe for this beer. God bless also the brewers at Watou who make this intense stuff. The beer is full-bodied, and leaves a coating in your mouth (a good thing). I'm not that good at picking out individual flavors, but I can taste sweet fruity flavors (plums, grapes, and bananas) with malt (chocolate and bread).

While St. B. beers are still an incredible value, the nuance and subtlety in Westy 12 are much greater. The St. B 12 is almost too sweet at points, and the excessive carbonation becomes aggrevating.

But retention was very good. It was very thick and frothy, showing off a moderate amount of carbonation. On the nose, I caught scents of licorice, but the real dominant smell was a sugary, wine-like grape. I could tell right away that there was a slightly higher alcohol content.  Tasting: Gosh, it sure is hard to describe all the flavors that I experienced! On the front of my tongue, there were flavors of dark grapes and sugars. Across the middle, significant malt sweetness, paired with a miniscule kick of alcoholic warmth, came across. On the back, as I drank, I thought I tasted a bit of dark chocolate, but then it dissipated to a wine-like flavor. I was thoroughly impressed by the complexities of this beer. It is as if this is on a different plane of fermented beverage existence. This was a medium-bodied beer with great viscosity and a full flavor. It wasn't as carbonated as the head suggested. In fact, it was even a little bit chewy. Again, I've never encountered anything like this before. I would certainly want to have another, but the alcohol content (double that of your ""average"" beer) deters me.  This beer certainly lived up to all of my expectations, and then some.

Mind you, I just had a Pater 6, so my tastebuds should be primed. The number on the back of this bottle reads 271009. Oops, into the glass went all the sediment. Oh well, it's an abbey ale. Obtained from John's Grocery(Iowa City...and they kept it in a fridge) in May 2005 and consumed about a week later. Pours a 2 finger light brown particulated head over a dark brown particulated liquid. Smells of candi-sugar, alcohol, and chocolate. The alcohol is strong in i) a burning of the nose sense and ii) a volitility aspect that is different and that I can't quite describe. Taste is alcohol with chocolate beneath and a nice nutty finish. Whoa, buddy, this is quite a doozie. The alcohol stands of notice throughout, with a constantly changing and interesting background of malt, spice, and fruit. If the alcohol is the ever-present orchestra, the background is a stage-play of many phenomenal different scenes brought on stage. What the heck is that intriguing spice? It has a pepper and licorice quality about it, but isn't quite either. I've tasted it before, but can't put my finger on it...anise?...but I think more. The end is quite chocolatey, almost fudge-like, but the initial sugar sweet comes to a stark dry finish. Thick mouthfeel and moderately carbonated (a touch more than I would have liked). Nice lacing inside the glass. Really delightful. As the beer warmed, the chocolate became a persistent flavor that rivaled the alcohol. Chocolate carries so many flavors well that this beer was *much* better warm. I recommend drinking this beer between cellar and room temperature.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,mynie,4.55,"Smaller capped bottle pours wonderfully into a chalice. Whoa. This is a fantastic sight. It's not black, it's more of a dark brown, but it's completely opaque. Pretty.  Deep smell of ripe fruit, like a good tripel. Raisins and plums and some apricots.  Zip upfront, hot like pepper, moving into a creamy middle of roasted malt, earth, white spices, cloves, ending fresh and fiery with an explosion of fruit and redwine grapes. Exceptional as can be.  This is a wonderful, wonderful beer.  Edit:  It's 2:25 in the afternoon the day after drinking four 11.2 ounce bottles, and I still have a headache.

A layer of foam laid on top of the beer the whole way down, and was quite thick.  Smell: Mostly alcohol, with hints of raisins and plum.  Taste: Wasn't blown away at first, but as it warmed up...why I began to warm up to the beer, so to speak. The beer itself is rich, with midly sweet malts, tart esthers, banana, raisin, plum, and alcohol mesh together seamlessly. Well, to be honest the alcohol stands a bit more than the rest but I can forgive that quite easily.  Mouthfeel: Mild to thick bodied. Slightly creamy and chewy  Drinkability: I drank that bottle down with ease and was ready for a 2nd",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,daedalus,4.58,"Served from a bottle with a freshness date stamped 12.08.09.  The beer poured a cola-brown speckled with plenty of yeast and sediment into a Westmalle chalice. When held to the light, amber hues appear through the translucent brown. Though the frothy head dissapates slowly, it never disappears entirely and a thin layer remains until the last few sips.  The smell is of green apples and sweet bread with a faint alcoholic presence.  Taste is oh-so smooth for such a high ABV. The sweet bready flavor from the nose reappears along with candied dark fruits. The spice from the yeast is noticable near the back of the mouth and during the swallow. Clove resonates throughout. Slight carbonation lends to an excellent mouthfeel.  Quite drinkable for containing such a high amount of alcohol.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Fat meringue like tan head, which lasts until the last gulp....excellent lacing. Light carbonation... aroma of dark fruits, rum, wine, alcohol and bready malts. Effervescent up front, followed with a complex array of flavors...dried dark fruits, nuts, red grape wine and spicey yeast.... Long finish bread dough, yeasty, almonds and rum in the after taste. As the ale warms in the goblet the malts become cookie dough sweet, spicer and more intoxicating...what a whallop...all ale should be like this.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,ElGordo,4.55,"I've been keeping this in the back of my fridge for a special occasion, and I figured finishing my master's thesis is just the time. I remember when I first tasted this beer I thought it was maybe the best I'd ever had, and I'm not disappointed this time. Popping the cap from the 11oz bottle releases a flutter of banana-y Belgian yeast aroma. Poured into my Duvel tulip, the beer has a sizeable, one-inch tan head that sticks around for a while. Body is a slightly cloudy, deep mahogany color. Nose is dominated by sweet malt and alcohol, with notes of brown sugar, yeast, and a hint of stone fruit. Palate is very nice - sweet malt is dominant, with notes of clove, allspice, and a very subtle hoppiness. The finish is dominated by warmth from the alcohol, but tempered by a lingering sweetness from the malt. Rich, creamy, warm mouthfeel is as close to perfection as you can get. This beer is an absolute pleasure to drink, even if it takes over an hour to get to the bottom of the glass.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

St. Bernardus looks to be hand painted, same design as the other bottle, but you can feel the detail of his bald-ass head.  At first there was a fait amount of carbonation, as the beer settled a 1/8-inch head remained. Uniform lacing as a backdrop to wonderfully rich dark brown velvet. Malt, grapes, citrus, a wonderful finish. For me tastes and smells are everything I have come to enjoy in this style. Tasty alcohol, accented by its wonderful characteristics. A beer worthy of its rating. Get yourself some.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Litterbean,4.18,"I love the look of this beer. Extremely brown and intimidating, with a whispy head that leaves fluffy lace. There is a very noticeable amount of carbonation.  Of course, there is that yeast smell right up front. A plentiful array of fruit in the nose, with spicy deep aroma which pulls through.  The first think you notice about the taste is the warming sensation you get from the liberal amount of alcohol. This is one beer that will knock you down. Very fruity. I detect prunes and other sun-dried fruits. Citric hops in the background. Medicinal qualities abound. Very dry finish, and the carbonation keeps your tongue feeling refreshed. After every sip I would salivate and it would keep my mouth well lubed. Immensely complex and it is obvious care was taken in making this baby. Not entirely drinkable because you are forced to sip this, and one bottle should be enough for a night. Not a session brew, but not meant to be. This was a perfect compliment to my last day of classes for the year.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Taste is spicy, slightly peppery with many layers of fruit flavors, raisins, figs and bananas. Alcohol is quite apparent with a bit of carbonation as well. Quite a nice hop bite as well balancing the sweetness out quite nicely.  A very well put together brew, certainly a benchmark for the style in many ways.

Smells of tart fruity esters, candy sweetness, apples and plums, bready, vinous alcohol notes. Tastes much the same. Initially very malty and sweet, becoming more fruity and vinous in character. Lots of bready banana yeast, sugary sweet mixed with a spicy hop bite, and a lingering vinous alcohol aftertaste. Medium thick, moderate carbonation.

Mahogany, warm brown hue but it could not be seen through. Big malt nose with peat moss and other earthy tones, bread crust. Scrumptious balance of hops and malt, though I tasted more of the latter than the former, and a serious alcohol hit of heat. Crisp and slightly tart mouth feel. Truly a great offering, this is one I would gladly have again and again.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,alexgash,4.87,"500th review time. I wanted to celebrate with a little something special, so I pulled this out of my meager ""cellar."" Anyway, on to the beer!  Dark, shoe leather brown that looks muddy, dotted with some clumps of unavoidable sediment. Two rocky fingers of thick, sandy brown head. Excellent lacing. Nose is made up of ripe, vinous fruits, rock candy, yeast, delicate alcohol, sugar cookie sweetness, oh and some tropical, estery fruits. Very complex and unbelievably inviting.  Taste opens up with some almost tart, vinous fruit notes. Warmig alcohol throughout (but not boozy). Ripened tropical fruits meld with yeast, leather, chocolate, and some roasted bitterness. Banana bitterness swells into the finish. Finish is long, warming, and full of encore performances from all the previous flavors. Very nice.  Full-bodied, with a velvety smooth mouthfeel. Never gets cloying. A wonderful beer!",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Lots of fruit flavors hit your mouth- fig, banana, and plum flavors come out. Wonderful aftertaste, and the complexity and flavor hides the ABV although it can be noticed. This is a truly great beer that I may not be worthy of. I prefer it to any Belgian beer that I have had to date (pretty much everything but Westy at this point). I would highly recommend it to others.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

It poured perfectly into a chalice with a thick silky head that looked like a cappuccino and once the sediment poured out it looked like cinnamon on top. The head glistened and had a subtle sound believe it or not. Dark brown color and a wonderful nose make all your senses go crazy. You must let this beer warm to fully appreciate its depth and range of flavors. Chocolate malt, honey and subtle spices in a silky seductive package. I paired it with a blue cheese and this beer cleaned my palate perfectly. It is like a bolder Rochefort 10, which does not mean better  just stronger flavors. Excellent.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Succulant dark and sticky fruits and yeasty spice explode from the goblet. It is a symphony of luscious malty sweets and warming alcohol goodness. Very promising.  One sip and I'm addicted to this beer for life! There are layers of fruits to pull apart; plum, green melon, figs, banana, dark cherries, and more. It's delightfully yeasty, with raw dough and all the accompanying spice. There's a nibble of artfully added hops toward the end. It's sweet and fruity while maintaining it's dignity.  The mouthfeel is medium big, with a very creamy, full texture. It's ever so gently carbonated and really feels like velvet in my mouth. I lick my goblet clean when I am finished, it's that good!  Note: after trying the St. Bernardus 6, 8, tripel, and Abt 12, I am thouroughly impressed and enamored with this beer. Absolutely top notch in every respect, and impossible to pick a favorite.

I would say a medium head wiith lots of lacing on the glass.  The smells are very sweet and fruity. There is a definite alcohol presence.  This beer is a pleasure, sweet with slight touch of bitterness and a butt kicking alcohol content.  Do I hear angels singing? Maybe.  As Ive been warned, drink it at the appropriate temperature.  It makes a difference.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Pingotas,4.95,"A consistent brew bottle-to-bottle, irrespective of size. Prefer this at about 55 degrees. Interestingly, the warmer samplings produced my most lasting impressions.  Turbid (In fact, nearly translucent) heady brown liquid poured hesitantly into the glass. The head rises ambitiously with a very fine, pleasant bubbliness.  The velvety taste is sensational. What makes this brew memorable is the yeasty flavor of freshly-baked dough. The blending of malty sweetness and distant hops allows the delicate flavors of plum pudding to persist long after the beer has been consumed.  A winner in my book, and perhaps my overall favorite ale.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Globetrotter,4.42,"Purchased in Antwerp and hand-delivered to Moscow (thanks Marjut and Michael), this intriguing little 33cl brown bottle has a blue and gold label featuring a happy monk holding up a chalice full of the good stuff. No ingredient information. Best before 12/02/09 (after five years, I wonder how much worse it would be on December 3?), I opened it on 3/23/05.  Cloudy hue somewhere between copper and burgundy, under a one finger beige head that settles quickly at first, then lingers as very thick film across the top of the liquid for a very long time. I see a few strands of lace, but the head is not very sticky and lacks a bit in body. The nose is just right - not overpowering and not mild. Fruit is the main impression, with yeast and barley backing that up. The mouth is very well carbonated and slightly viscous - not heavy, but there is a coating sensation on the tongue. The taste is sublime, smooth bready malt, a touch of fruity twang, a hint of hoppy bitterness. The alcohol is well concealed, but not invisible. We've got great balance here in a beer that cannot be enjoyed in quantity on a given night, but can be enjoyed on many given nights.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

This is more than beer, it is an event, a meal and wondrous.  I cannot say it any better than Todd, but I'll try.  I poured slowly so no head speak of. At first it smelled like alcohol and a bit sweet but make no mistake, it is a beer. After the first sip I was attached with a spicy flavor. The spicy flavor mellows quickly but not before a sharp alcohol kick finishing with and a warm buttery candy like flavor. All the while bubbles remind you what you're drinking.  Never have I ever had such an aftertaste. This is a drink, a meal and a dessert all in one. Sitting here writing this review I am reminded of a bakery the smell is so inviting.  Points off for drinkability and mouthfeel only because of the excessive alcohol. Other than that, I cannot imagine anything more exceptional.

259,1708,waughbrew,4.42,"Looks very intriguing - a dirty dark brown with a large off-white head with good retention and lacing. Smells of musty yeast, cloves, dark fruits, and sweet choclates. The aroma is incredibly alive. Flavor is huge on the special B type raisiny burnt caramel molasses. Big cloves, some banana. Finishes surprisingly bitter with some hop leafiness. Alcohol is present in the perfect amount to complement the other flavors. The feel of the brew was the major bummer for me. I found it to be a biting, harsh carbonation that combined with the bitter finish of the brew to make it a bit less than stellar. Overall a complex and enjoyable beer.  Re-Rate 3/15/05: Head was a little soap-sudsy this time, pretty sure it wasn't my glass. Body has a lot of dark red in it with hints of deep purple. Smell hit me as oaky anise with blackberries and cotton candy. Flavor is a plum-wine with a spicy, semi-dry finish reminiscent of some red wines. Perhaps last time I did not allow it to warm sufficiently, because the feel is very smooth and marshmallowy with only that little spicy bite. Very drinkable.

A thick, well defined white bubbly head gives way to well formed cloying bubbles that stick with great dedication to the sides of the chalice. Fresh fruit, malts, raisins, traces of alcohol, and some port/wine notes on the nose; very nice. An initial on-slaught of delightful flavorings  plums, raisins, licorise and sweet malts; full bodied and borderline chewy. Further warming evolves figs, grapes and pears; even further into the flavoring reveals a slight hop-based backbone, brown sugar, grapes and even some coffee beans. The ABV at 10% is spot-on, its noticeable, but in a good way. Rich and full flavored, a thing of beauty!",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

I must have gotten a bad bottle before, cause man is this stuff tasty!  Appearance: Poured into my rochefort glass. Pours a very dark caramelly, brown brew with a medium sized, tan head that produces some lacing but immediately begins to slowly fade away. The brew itself is hazy and thick.  Smell: Brown sugar, caramel & chocolate, sweet (slightly over-)ripe fruits (mainly banana but also: apples, plums, cherries, ?), vinous notes, malts. Sweet, delicious and incredibly complex.  Taste: Caramelly sweet and fruity with roasted malts and quite some ""gluhwein-aspects"" (clove, ginger?, ...). Bitter chocolate and hoppy flavours bring some dry notes to the brew. Drool.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied, the beer is smooth and creamy. The carbonation is spot on for this kind of beer. The alcohol warms the throat and stomach, leaving you with a confortable and snuggy feeling.  Drinkabillity: The drinkabillity is great for the high alchol percentage but the complexness and richness of this beer demand a lot of your attention, I think having more than one of these could prove to be an exhausting experience, at least for me.  Final thoughts: This is without a doubt an exceptional beer. As with all quadrupels I've had so far though; the serving temperature is a very delicate thing and could have a great impact on the smell, taste and mouthfeel. Not having had the Westvleteren 12 yet, I'd say this beer is only outclassed by the Rochefort 10 in its style, wich is a little more full, round and bold still. Nevertheless though, this brew is close to perfection and great in its own ways. World Class!",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Warming (and yes smelling a bit) like a good coffee, with a touch of sweet to make you crave more, the dark brown liquid in my cup is leaving me too quickly. Smooth , too smooth, I want to gulp, but NO! Savor... If I could, I would buy a case; regardless, it always seems that I can't find many happy friars waiting around on the shelves.

Beautiful.  First whiff is cocoa, almonds, sweet malts, walnuts?, hints of lime, turkish taffy, barbecue sauce?, yowzah!, chocolate. HOLD IT! Need time to assimilate.  The taste is sweet fruits, roasted malts and lots of chocolate. Luscious creamy mouthfeel, full bodied, milky, hint of diacetyl. It warms the back of your throat.

This beer gets amazing as it warms. Not to say it wasn't great when I started, but I'm starting to wish I had the whole beer at this temperature. Somewhere between 45 and 50 F when I started, this beer turns into bliss around 55 F. Those sneaky monks with their candied sugars made a bohemeth of a beer. Malt and hops both aggressive, then subtle vibes of unending complexity. Vanilla, cookie dough, alchohol, all sorts of spices; a monster of a beer.

I pick up mostly light cherries and a mixing of other fruits in the flavor. This beer is so complicated its hard to really pick out anything specific. There is a slight citrus nature as well, possibly from the hops. The alcohol is barely detectable in the flavor but is definately warming on the way down. Mouthfeel is absolutely delectible.

Rich malt, slightly musty, with hints of caramel, rum, oodles of spices, and a very light hoppiness with such a smooth creamy mouthfeel it just slid right down my throat. Barely a hint of alcohol, despite its high ABV. Well worth the $6.99 I laid down for it.  Easily the best Belgian I have had. Tremendous! One I will certainly go back to for special occasions.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,ypsifly,4.6,"Pours a rich mahogany with a thick beige head that stays around for a long time.  Smells of banannas, bread, clove like spices with a trace of alcohol in the end.  The tastes match the aroma with the clove being a bit more pronounced. It reminds me of Aventinus, but nowhere near as much clove. Just the right amount of carbonation and the mouthfeel coats the taste buds without feeling syrupy.  This is a very delicious and highly drinkable beer. At $8.99 for a 750ml bottle an excellent value. I plan to stock up on this one.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,pentathlete,4.65,"From Capital Ale House in Richmond, VA. This was served in a 10 oz stemmed glass. I am assuming that it was poured from an 11.2 oz bottle with an ounce retained for the house(!)  Foamy head with plenty of lace, though the glass was a tad too small to appreciate it. Smell was a jumble of malt, fruit, some alcohol. I had just had dinner and felt a little unprepared for this brew. It's dark blackish purple cloudy appearance was loaded with carbonation. It was a business dinner, it was expensed, just relax and enjoy.  The Abt 12 has the mouthfeel that I want from a beer. Full, coats the mouth in flavors that appear in both appropriate and surprising ways. Sweetness without cloying, alcohol without burning, fruits without any medicinal taste, and creamy.  The snow was falling and I had a forty mile drive remaining. Do I order my third and continue talking shop? No, better to be safe and enjoy this beer another day. Bottles will be added to my stash. This is a don't miss class act.  Find it, buy it, enjoy it. Treat it with respect.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

It was served in the proper brewery glass and had such a nice head on it that I had to look at it for a while before finally lifting the glass for a sip. Presentation is really important to fulfilling desire and I think that this was one of the best looking beers I have had served to me ever. When I took that first sip I knew that this was something to be savored for a while. Nice rounded malt sweetness and smooth strength. Creamy sweet soft and chewy.

The beer pours a dark brown color, like a belgain strong dark ale, with a medium sized white head, very good retention and a few nice lacing effects. The aromas are everywhere with this one, smells like a nice mixed bag of malts, with a few spice and fruit touches as well.  The taste is medium-body, tastes very sweet like brown sugar. The malt tastes are everywhere as well and the spice is less so in the taste. The slight alcohol taste actually feels good in this case, especially during the winter, which is the best time to drink strong belgians with stouts and porters. The mouthfeel is quite fascinating, for as heavy the alcohol is in this one, the body is moderate and the palette has no issues. The delivery is almost perfect but the sweet brown sugary taste affects the delivery. The drinkability is very solid, at 10% it's amazing compared to Gulden Draak, however I could not see myself drinking more than one of these in any one session.  Final Thought: Belgian ales are still new to me, but through time I may appreciate them more, and review this one again.

Nice combination of everything that your tung& nose can detect in this brew. Sweetfruity, fullmalty and a subtile bitter seem to dominate so.

Aroma of brown sugar, cloves and a whiff of alcohol  Cloves and spices, malt, cake, dried fruit ,ripe fruit, sugar, alcohol, not neccessarily in that order and not the same from sip to sip. Warmer is better.  Wonderful on the tounge and cheeks, lots of fine carbonation waiting to be roused with a gentle swish of the toungue.

Difficult to find this beer, found a 4 pk at Whole Foods. Pours a dark rich chocolate black and is not translucent with a three inch head that dissipated with lacing around the inside of the glass. Very evident rich smell of a cookie roasted molasses malt with a perfume resin, slightly lemon, hop aroma. The taste pronounces the smell with a moderate, slightly cookie, lightly bready, roasted molasses malt; moderate, slightly grapefruity, herb resin hops; a light horseblanket doughy yeast; and hints of the following: tawny port, slight toffee, brown sugar, licorice, and cola into the smooth finish. Mouthfeel is one of the smoothess medium to full bodied beer I've ever had, the texture has a creamy dry feel, the carbonation is lively and soft, and the hops has a metallic piercing into the finish.

259,1708,neonbrown82,5,"I've had a craving for this beer for quite some time. As I drank this beer I consulted my review, and as it was one of the first beers I reviewed for this site, my palate lacked the sophistication necessary to explain the pure bliss of this beverage. The first time I reviewed this beer I gave it a 4.9, but I believe now that is well deserving of the extra tenth.  The beer poured into my St. Bernardus chalice to a very dark nutty brown color with a massive dimpled foam cap that sticks around throughout the entire glass. This beer necessitates an extra category: sound. Sounds like a bowl of rice krispees, but the carbonation does not produce a harsh mouthfeel.  The smell is very sweet due to a quadruple dose of caramelized malts and fermentable sugars (belgian dark candi sugar, caramel, molasses, honey?). The high alcohol content is also noticable through the smell.  The beer provides an initial taste of all kinds of specialty sugars and spices, and as the liquid is passed from the tip to the mid-section of your tongue, the caramelized malts begin to grab hold of your senses. Finally, the finish shows a tiny bite of low AA noble hops, but just enough to balance out the sweetness.  Seems to be slightly astringent. Some aging would probably do her well, but as I said, I have had a craving for this beer for far too long to wait for a cellared product. The astringency is not overbearing though, nor is the alcohol or the sweetness. The mouthfeel is full and a bit creamy, and the foam is a bit metallic tasting (maybe from the minerals in the well water?)  Very heavenly. I may be a heathen bastard, but I believe that there must be some divine force responsible for this fine beverage. When I drink this beer, I seem to transcend beyond the normal state of drunkenness or sobriety. I only wish I could drink nothing but beers of this quality or higher (I'll have to be the judge of whether Westy is better than this or not, but I really don't see how it can get any better) without taking a huge hit on my pocket book just to drink a beer or two from day to day. It goes without saying that this is very highly drinkable, even though the ABV is quite high. If you haven't ingested this holy nectar, you are a sinner and likely going to hell, regardless if you (like me) don't believe in any religion.  In tradition of the holy bible, I hereby damn John's Grocery in Iowa City for tempting me with this forbidden fruit.

The body was a dark, caramel brown with little head, perhaps it dissipated as it was filled to the brim. The nose is figgy and/or raisin? Nice. My first thought is wow, what a taste explosion. Then I immediately notice the syrupy, full mouthfeel. This is quite obviously a world class beer. I find there are a bunch of flavors vying for number one here; brandy/raisin/fig/and a candy sweetness.

So I had to buy a bottle and try it again.  Appearance - Pours a deep, dark brown with a head that refuses to leave. I haven't ever had a beer with such good head retention that I wished the head would calm down a bit.  Smell - Alcohol, lots and lots and lots of alcohol. Some malt comes through.... I don't find it pleasant.  Taste - Big blast of malt and alcohol. Subtle fruityness of either rasins, plums... something along those lines. I think it may be spicy, but I'm not sure. It's slightly sweet up front but dry at the end. The taste of this beer is completey foreign to me; like nothing else I've had. Don't taste any hops at all.  Mouthfeel - Like sipping on a can of liquid malt extract. Just what I want from this beer.  Drinkability - It is what it is.   Wow. This beer tastes good, but I wasn't in the mood for it at all. Come to think of it, I haven't been in the mood for Malty-and-Not-Hoppy beer in a while.

As the head settles (which takes ages...) it forms delightful dimples. I also notice specks of brown on it - I don't know if these are chunks of yeast or what, but they make me think of one thing - grated nutmeg on eggnog.  Smells of big malt and fruit. Sour apple, yeastiness, cinnamon. Is this beer *really* not spiced?  Tastes more glorious than anything else. Big, wintery, spicy fruit. Cinnamon and nutmeg and clove and apple - like apple pie in a glass. Frothy, estery caramel goodness. Chewy and malty to no end.  As for the mouthfeel, it's honestly quite like drinking heavy cream. Feels like frothy espresso. Caramely-apple-pie-flavored frothy espresso.  A damn good beer. Few beers would elicit a ""perfect 5"" from me, but this one pulled it off.

Smell: The aroma is very much like a red wine, with fruity and caramel notes. The alcohol comes on a bit too strong.  Taste and Mouthfeel: The beginning of this taste journey is all about the malts. Sweet and juicy with a great caramel taste. The middle is completely balanced between malts and hops. And it ends with a great hop flavor with a still nicely balanced flavor. This is a phenomenal tasting beer, unique from all others I've ever had. The mouthfeel is superb, slick and creamy at the same time.  Drinkability and Overall: This is one of those beers that changed my life. First Storm King, then Westvleteren 12, now this. I'm still new to Trappist brews but I know I already love it.

A grain prescense is left on the tongue along with a slight coffee flavor at the very end.  verdict: for a beer with the ABV of 10% this is extremely smooth.

Its aroma contains hints of spice, cherries and a red wine character which I liken to a fine Merlot. The taste was the best part of this beer by far. At first you are introduced to a rich coffee and chocolate flavor which later yields to fruitiness. There are also hints of light spicing and roasted malt which comes towards the end. In the mouth this beer had the texture and richness of good coffee. At the same time it was creamy and smooth. The aftertaste left a nice thick coating on the mouth.

The alcohol comes through quite clearly, but is carefully blended with the fruits and spices so that a dark, mellow, and delicious vinous quality ensues.

The initially piercing sweet scent took on more caramel tones as the head slowly subsided. The foam itself had a nice bite that put me in mind of unsweeted baker's chocolate.  The flavor was all about malt, caramel and vinous though it hid the alcohol well. Though full bodied in the mouth and dangerously drinkable, nothing really special emerged until the end.

Aromas of sweetness, somewhat spiciness and whole grains entered my mind. A smooth brew on the palate, this one is a keeper. Borders on a MUST TRY for all BAs.  Prosit!",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Dubblebock,4.61,"St. Bernardus ABT 12 is one truly massive beer in every sense of the word. From the first pour to the last drop, it's a monster. No wonder the monk on the painted label is smiling.  Truly wonderful in appearance. It pours with a generous head of tight, concise bubbles that sticks around a while. Deep, rich caramel color. There isn't any light sneaking through when held up to the bulb.  The nose is all malty goodness with a slight alcohol bite.  The taste is tremendous, all sweet, bready malts and a spreading but not overwhelming alcohol warmth. A light fruitiness swims around in the background, but the malts are the true story with this beer.  Excellent mouthfeel, not thick or cloying an any way. Well carbonated.  Very, very drinkable for such a big beer. You know the ABV is there, it's just hidden behind a slight tingle on the tip of the tongue.  A sheer monster, this is a beer you should not pass up.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,crookedhalo,4.35,"33 cl bottle. Pours a deep, hazed chestnutty brown color with a fluffy, light tan head in the St. Bernardus chalice. Earthy (bark and peat) and malty aromas, healthy yeasty nose, and some faint fruitiness (fig, prune, dates) and spices (cinnamon, ginger and anise). Luxurious in the tongue, heavy malt and fine carbonation give a creamy mouthfeel. Slightly malty sweet, but subtle fruity qualities and a fine yeastiness compact the overall impression of the taste into a fever pitch. This beer is about as close as you might get to a trappist without it being labeled as such. It's impression lasts throughout the duration of the drinking experience. ABV seems hidden well amongst it's complexity.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Brent,4.42,"I cetainly give this beer high marks for drinkablity, which is both complimentary and hypothetical, as the 10% abv demands that this beer be consumed in moderation, or suffer the consequences. Poured a murky, rootbeer brown. Creamy, rocky head and spicy aroma, both yeast and alcohol. Spicy on the tongue, with an unusual dark flavor lurking in the background - not soy sauce, but something akin to that in the manner of a dark, fermented flavor, but more tannic, like flavors leached from a wooden ageing cask. Obviously couldn't put my finger on it, but it was both interesting and pleasant. Other dark flavors from overripe orchard fruit, and a touch of prune. One of the best of the style, in my humble opinon.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Smell: Fruit like plums or raisons and alcohol. Nice mix of sweetness and the alcohol on the nose.  Taste: Alcohol on the first sip, followed by the plummy taste, with hints of chocolate at the end. Very nice.  Mouthfeel: Silky smooth.  Drinkability: Not your everyday beer. Royal beer that fits well with special occasions.  What's not to love about St. Bernardus? This is the gemstone of their line in my opinion.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Taste is dark fruit; plums, raisions, dates with a slightly yeasty sweet bread flavor. Rich, full bodied with a smooth mouthfeel. Finishes faintly bitter with a warming alcohol on the breath.  This is a great brew that lives up to its reputation.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

I can see me in the body, which mades me think it is opaque. The head doesn't disappear until the beer is drunk. Nice. The smell is partly reminiscent of the prior 8. Light hints of red fruits, some peanut butter, and a grassy grapefruit and chocolate aspect. The taste is a bit nutty and shows interesting notes of almost burnt caramel and chocolate with deep wooden notes.Lightly fruity, with some sweetness. Mouthfeel is amazing, an incredible smoothness and creaminess. Very full and round in the mouth. Almost as drinkable as a 10% beer can be.

I will never forget my first taste of St. Bernardus Abt 12.  Nobly inspired by the flavors of Westy 12, this declassified St. Sixtus brew is more balanced, drinkable, and enticing than its trappiste counterpart.  Dominant notes of a grapey yeast and dry, dusty chocolate, St. Bernardus is layered with an extensive finish that reveals to me everything Belgium could ever have to offer the world of beer.  Rich and creamy yet also thinning on the finish. Drinkable with absolutely no detectable alcohol or cloying residual sweetness.  Measured and precise.  But really, St. Bernardus is not to be described in terms of its flavor -- which is, indeed, perfect. With beer this good, with anything this good, the body is wholly consumed.  St. Bernardus Abt 12 is a physiological event that cripples every muscle save the tongue and save the heart.  Relax, relax. ng",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

The taste is pure heaven, as all those subtle esters that make up Belgian strong ales are blended in such a way that the whole is greater than the parts.

Blackberries and raspbery in the background. Perfect amount of carbination. The first sip gives you a nice little bite. Tastes of alcohol, I love that. Tiny bit of coffee with cream. Little hopp. Lightly bitter. Very dry taste, but yet wet mouthfeel. Whiskey like flavors. Flavors are so good with this offering! Buddy at the table who tends to try everything I get said he noticed saki tastes. I don't know that I have ever had saki, so I will just have to take his word on that one.

259,1708,Denali,3.95,"Package: 12 oz. bottle  Presentation: Had a bottle of this at Anam Cara in Brookline, MA.  Appearance: Dark brown opaque color with moderate tan head that dissipated but laced rather nicely the entire time.  Smell: Enjoyable aroma of figs, malt, and alcohol.  Taste: Flavor was a mixture of figs and raisins, a little peppery with sweet malt, and also a strong alcohol presence. Very well blended flavors.  Mouthfeel: Very creamy.  Drinkability: I think that the alcohol warming would get to me if I had a few of these in row, but the one I had was enjoyable.  Comments: This reminded me quite a bit of the Westy 12. While its flavors are very good and extremely well blended, for me there was not as much interaction between the flavors as compared to, for example, the Malheur 12 or the Rochefort 10. Perhaps this really isnt the case for other people and its just how my taste buds respond to these different quadrupels, but I prefer the various flavors to come through over time as opposed to all at once. Therefore, as of this moment, I prefer the Malheur 12 and Rochefort 10 over the St. Bernardus Abt 12 and the Westy 12. However, it is an enjoyable beer nevertheless.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Rio,4.45,"From a 12 oz. bottle, found across the state line in Missouri (not available here in Kansas from what I know). Poured into a chalice as a deep, hazy brown color, with a tower off-white head. Had to let it set to let the head settle before I could pour the second half of the bottle into the glass. The head clinged to the edges of the chalice the whole time.  Nice malty aroma to it, with a bit of an earthy smell, perhaps? Maybe cloves. A bit of sweetness to the smell, as well. Not overpoweringly strong aroma, just a nice, smooth smell to contribute to the overall experience of this brew.  Earthy flavors up front here, with a dark, sweet flavor in there. Perhaps like a brown sugar taste there. There is a nice grape flavor towards the end, but it's nice and smooth, not as bitter as I've noticed in some other Belgians. I can't taste the alcohol much in this one, but I can definitelly feel it at the end, nice and warm. Very nice and smooth, and the head adds a nice, creamy feel to it. Goes down very easily.  Very nice beer here. At three and a half bucks a bottle, not something I'm gonna stock my fridge with, but probably something I'll keep around. For the flavor and feel itself, I think this one is a very drinkable beer, but not something you'd probably want to drink one after another of.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Quaffer,4.11,"25.4 oz bottle, caged and corked. Picked this up in Dallas. Not available here in Wichita.  Appearance: A very deep amber-brown. Quite a bit darker than I was expecting. A heavy bead could be seen when enough light was put behind the glass to actually see through it. Absolutely wonderful, dense, thick head. It stuck to the side of the glass like glue and seemed to not dissipate at all, probably due to the large amount of bubbles feeding it from below. Aesthetically speaking, this beer was perfection in a glass.  Smell: The aroma was comprised of a rich maltiness that was pierced by sharp fruit and spicy yeast. Alcohol spice and some dark fruit lay underneath. Quite a bit of depth, but not heavy smelling at all.  Mouthfeel: Silky smooth upfront and gained more of a velvety texture as it moved back in the mouth. Medium-bodied.  Taste: A nice, dark maltiness was prominent upfront, having a lightly caramel, but more cocoa-like, character to it. The yeast rose up strong in the middle. On the finish, the yeast was joined by spicy alcohol and a sharp fruitiness. This beer became almost sour on the finish. The aftertaste provided a reprise of the chocolate-like malt that was present at the start.  This was a good, solid beer. Not a mind-blowing experience, but very enjoyable.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

The smell was strong of cloves, peppermints, pepper. It bites your nose a bit with the strong alcohol.  The alcohol is warming, but a bit strong. The taste is a glorified quad, with everything you'd expect but so much better. The taste is malty and chewy with cloves, sugar cane, an (licorice?)...

Smell: Grainy malts with hints of chocolate and various spices. Alcohol is also pretty noticeable.  Taste: Rich, dark carmel malts. Some fruitiness combined with spice. Incredibly smooth and mouth-warming from the alcohol. Carbonation is nearly perfect. A lingering bitterness lies in the finish.  Overall: A world-class, dark Belgian ale.

A nice tan head forms, about two fingers thick. It dissipates down to about a centimeter and stays there.  Smell: Fresh baked, whole grain bread. Cocoa. Leather. Sweet Dough. Molasses. Honey. Smells better than most anything else in the world.  Taste: Where to begin? Rich, and with a nice malt sweetness. Not over the top sweet. Some more bready flavors, Pumpernickel? Cream. Some dark fruits and a nicely balanced tang. Yeasty and with a little alcohol character. The finish is huge and the wonderful bready spicy malty character sticks around.  Mouthfeel: Perfection. Honestly. Nicely carbonated, but comfortably viscous and thick. It almost feels as good to my tongue as it tastes. Hate to swallow.  Drinkability: A savory, slow drinking delight and 10% ABV means that one is probably enough.   Notes: This beer should be taken out of the fridge for a while before consuming. It's so much better just a few degrees below room temp. A magnificent creation and as close to the perfect beer as I've ever tasted. Drink it. Know it.

Upon the initial pour, I got some aromas I thought were a bit off,, but as the glass warms it smooths out a bit. Initial impresiion is of dark, dark toffee color topped with a latte colored head. The aroma...I am still picking up an earthy, almost cocoa powder note. There's some alcohol hanging out alongside. The taste helps out quite a bit however...cocoa powder, dark fruit, some spiceyness in the finish. Light but still medium mouthfeel. A nice treat, but not one I will go for that often. While very good, perhaps this one would benefit from some aging. Looks like the bottle is telling me that it would be good till 2005, maybe I should have saved it till then.

The color was a deep chocolate brown. The aroma is of spice and candy; quite surprising actually. The taste has a hint of the candy present in the nose with some roasted grain up front. On the back you get a subtle impression of the alcohol, and a mild lingering bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium, not too heavy. The drinkability is good, I could have a few more of these, and will.

I had anticipations of Rochefort 10 or Westy 12, I was surprised to find it was not even in the same league. The head poured well enough, the alcohol warmed my nose with a slight hint of banannas, which made my mouth water for rochefort... then the first taste. The alcohol hit prematurely, and the beer lay flat on my tongue like a bad kisser. The bananas in the nose did not ever hit the palate. The finish was almost foul, causing me to make a bit of an onion smelling face with each sip. Some may call blasphome (sp), but I failed to finish the beer. I may blow another $4.00 on this beer, but only on sheer curiosity, because the beers reputation was not met, and perhaps I had a bad bottle.

There is more going on than that but I am unable to tell exactly what the wonderful scents are, I will defiantly need to get a few more of these to enjoy and analyze. Up front with the taste is sweet fruity malt flavors mingling with a bit of spice. The taste is very smooth and it defiantly warms you up a good deal. Mouthfeel is full and creamy with excellent carbonation and a dry finish, basically perfect.

The aroma is sweet cherries with the uniquely earthy Belgian yeast strain. The taste at first sip is an explosively spicy alcohol. After that initial attack, other flavors start to emerge. The most notable of these is a lingering hop bitterness that is much stronger than most other beers that fall under the broad umbrella of Belgian styles. The bitterness is not overpowering in any way, and allows the fruitiness of the malt to open up in the background. I imagine as this fresh beer settles down, the character would become more malty and complex, and thanks to the new Georgia law allowing this elixir to enter our fair state, I can find out how it will age without much problem. This beer packs a heck of a punch at 10% ABV. After the 330 ml bottle is downed, there is a fire in the belly that radiates out to the extremities. Very drinkable, even at this potency.

The appearance is a dark ruby, rusty brown garnet color when poured into my large chalice...in other words, the color is hard to describe. It's somewhat murky and speckled with sediment, the creamy dense off-white head reminds me of a dense cappuccino head that is also speckled with the same cinnamon colored sediment as the body.  The aroma is estery with sweet banana bread qualities. There are also stabs of spice and dark fruits to my nose, yet there are also sweet malty qualities as well.  The taste is absolutely smooth, no doubt due to the aging. Somewhat sweet and somewhat spicy, but vinous qualities on the back of the tongue and throat. Warming qualities from the alcohol that I feel all the way down till it warms my stomach.  The mouthfeel is great, nice carbonation and it ends with a dry quality that is very refreshing.  It's very drinkable because of how smooth and well blended it is, but the alcohol is there and will bitch slap you if you dare forget about it.  Overall this is very damn good, I'm glad I've aged it, but I would also like to try it a little fresher than this.

There is pear, apple and a yeasty alcohol working together. Its a sharp, clean smell.  It is amazing how smooth this beer is. I had a very difficult time distinguishing any individual flavor in this beer and not because it was crafted blandly. It is profound how complex and well balanced the flavors are in this beer.

The taste starts sweet and progresses to a wine-like taste. The fruit is here too. As for the alcohol, you know it's there but it doesn't cover the rest of the taste. It's most detectable at the end.  The mouthfeel is smooth considering the beer's strength. The carbonation is much more balanced than in the pour.

Tastes initially malty-sweet, dark fruits quickly move in (dates and raisins), followed by a strong punch of alcohol and sharp hop bitterness. It is a very quick flowing beer, the flavors are gone almost as soon as they appear. Big on the fruit esters, this is definately one delicious beer. Aftertaste is smooth and bitter; reminicent of the dominating qualities.  Mouth feel is what I would consider to be the lowest ranking part of the beer. It is NOT bad, but doesn't match up to the rest of the beer. Good carbonation that glides around the mouth, but the beer is just the slightest bit punishing on the tounge.

259,1708,jvajda,4.9,"I bought two bottles a couple days ago. The first was totally skunked and flat, but this one had a big head on it and was well carbonated, so I assume it was OK. I'll try it a third time just to be sure, because this beer did not live up to the hype.  Appearance: Big, thick, three-finger, tan head with specs of brown goodness that stayed for a long time. The beer was a murky dark brown. Smell: Very malty and banana like with a hint of wine-like acidity. Hints of figs as well. Taste: This is a super complex, full-flavored brew. The alcohol was well hidden considering the high ABV. It starts with bananas and chocolate and ends with an acidic, wine-like, dry finish. Nuts, bananas, figs, dark chocolate are all highlighted in its body. Excellent candy sweetness as well. A perfect dessert beer. Mouthfeel: Very creamy in the mounth and sticky on the lips. Low carbonation. A luxurious feel. Drinkability: A heavyweight for sure, this is a special occasion beer, but perfect for those occasions.  Update: Just tried a third bottle. Review updated accordingly.  Update two: I've had a number of these now, and they've ranged from amazing to flat and stale. This beer is hit or miss. If you get a good, you've got one of the best beers on Earth.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Mitchster,2.81,"Fresh. Part of a Xmas 4 pack with a St.Bernardus glass. 10% ABV. Pours out to a semi-cloudy dark-amber with ruby highlights, forming a modest tan head with good retention and solid sheets of lacing. Adding the murky brown yeast makes it look like turkish coffee. Carbonation is moderately strong, about 3.0 carbs. Aroma of spicy phenolics, brown bananas, rye bread, cologne, tart rotting apple skins, week-old apple cider, and unfortunately wet cardboard and fruit flys. Mouthfeel is light and explodes upon the tongue, spritzy but leaving a dull coating on the tongue in the finish. Medium bodied, finishing quite dry with an unpleasant medium firm bitterness. Not at all sweet. Taste is a bit muddled, cloves, brown bananas, smashed fruit flys (thoroughly unpleasant), then wet cardboard, going into a metallic bitterness which is not at all pleasant, then a peppery hot alcohol bite at the end.  Previous notes of mine do not apply at all here. ""Adding the yeast and letting it breathe allows the brew to develop and makes it much more enjoyable...smoothing out the carbonation, and letting some of the higher alcohols evaporate. The malts take on a cookie-like, raisiny sweetness. The mouthfeel improves considerably. "" There are no raisins or cookie like sweetness here, which would add immensely to this brew.  Not very enjoyable. I've had much better quads, both commercial and some of which I've brewed myself. Compared to other quads, there is no dark fruit here like raisins, dates, figs. I wish there were. The nose of wet cardboard and fruit flys, metallic bitterness and alcohol bite just kill this beer for me. This is the 4th time I've drank this and I think consistently is an issue for this brew. I'm not inclined to buy it again and honestly, I can't recommend it, contrary to what others have to say about this beer.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Sammy,4.2,"Carbonation stung my tongue yet I loved it. Beyond anything I have ever drunk of any refreshment. Like cold spring water on a hot day. Beautiful dark unique color with some doughy pieces. Complex wonderful taste of nuts, sweet malt, spices, dark fruit, cream.  Had another bottle 21 months later, wonderful finish spicey finish. Nice head and lace. The taste depends on where you put it on the tongue. Satisfying.  6.5 years later and good complexity, still aggressive carbonation. 7.3 years later and just yeasty and sweetish.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Aroma is of dark fruit, raisins, plumbs, and an ever slight hint of alcohol. Taste is smooth and creamy in the mouth. The dark fruit is present all the way through. Slightly sweet and fruity sums it up. Very nice and interesting too boot! The alcohol shows its head ever so slightly near the end of the drink. Drinkability?!? Man, I need to slow down and enjoy this work of brewery art. It is a fantastic Abbey ale and a must for all to try!",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,watermelonman,4.37,"This poured to a dark and solid-looking brown color with a huge head. It faded but lasted throughout the glass in its smaller form. The lacing is thin but practically solid around the glass.  The alcoholic content is evident in the taste, but ther beer remains fairly well-balanced. The flavor has hints of fruits on top of its strong nature.  It's a great beer, there's not much question about that.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,RedDiamond,4.45,"Starts with an energized leap from the bottle and a sizable head of feathery beige suds. This brew is a dark rusty brown, the precise color of a monks robe Im sure. It smells wine-like at first, with a base of caramel and spice. The taste is mature, complex, and spicy, with a well-endowed malt profile and a notable though tempered presence of alcohol.  This is a beer of great artistry and poise with a judicious balance of lush malty sweetness and muscular verve. Im beginning to think these monks are really onto something. I wonder if I might look good in a brown robe?",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Excellent lacing on the glasss. What a great smell. Complex malts with fruity hints. The taste is so sweet and smooth. Very drinkable IMO. The 10%abv is very suddle. This may be one of the best beers I've ever tried.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,tavernjef,4.76,"Gorgeous thick color of reddish, dark crusty earth brown with a substantially tall, softly creamy, yet densely whipped, dark ivory crown that remains for a good while before slowly creeping down to an ever present thick murky skim. Lacing starts as styrofoam sheets but dissolves and sticks in big spots and some globules.  Aroma is soft and subtle, not all that strong but comes across complex enough with dark citrusy fruits of fig, raisin, starfruit, and touches of lemon and banana. Some cocoa sits within and a bit of crispy vanilla and cookie dough sweetness. But as it warms some major yeasty tones take over lending phenolic notes and spicy alcoholic burn.  Yum! Taste is super nice; very soft and subtle, full and scrumptious, nice dulled-like dark citrusy fruit notes dancing upon chewy cookie dough sweetness where pleasing sugars, vanilla, and lingering cocoa wait in the wings to finish it off. Quite a bit of things going on; like a waffer lemon tea cookies meets chewy sweet oatmeal raisin cookie dough with a splash of cocoa. Heavy milk-like thickness upfront, some light chewy malts and cookie sugars dominate the middle where it mingles with a solid carbonation and some wonderfully placed yeasty spices of clove and earthy dryness towards the finish. But this really never gets all that dry at all, it remains full and wet with amazing sugary cookie things. Its fades ever so gently off the palate where a dry spice coats under a sweet malt laden heaven. Mmmm...Liquid bakery flavors of oatmeal cookies, caramel chewy raisin bars, and moist chocolate/cocoa cake with a spritz of darkened citrus in the frosting. Amazing! The yeast sits just right for me, mild yet present with just the right amount of give and take around the middle and into the finish with its clove-like and phenolic spice and alcohol.  Full, fluffy carbonation, semi-chewy, very well rounded and just spicy enough, just the right amount of sweetness and sugarsall combine, and whammo, you've got an amazingly easy smooth, soothingly thick glass of necture here. Beyond drinkable; its fan-tabulous! Slides right down with wonderment! How in the hell do those 'smiling' monks do it?

259,1708,99bottles,4.75,"33 cL bottle. Drink before the end of April 2004 the label reads in German and Spanish. I guess I gotta.  Appearance: This beer poured into a goblet is a beautiful reddish brown body with a sloshy white head. Retention is somewhat on the low side, but seems perfect for this beer.  Smell: Is of rich malts with a fruity and slightly alcholic nature. Figs, dates, plums, raisins all seem to be wrapped delicately in the warm phenols.  Taste: Incredible. There is so much complexity that it sort of figures itself out and leaves you with jaw agape saying wow. The sweet malts are ever so light and fruity. Interesting notes of spice slip through the smooth fruit. I'd say clove or nutmeg, but subdued in such a way that they never steal the show. Those monks have stumbled across something here. Very earthen, also very sweet, alcoholic and easy going. This is really a piece of art.  Mouthfeel: Absolutely perfect. It feels so light, so fluid and yet has a deceiving amount of body. Good bright carbonation plays with the smooth and slick malt. No cloying whatsoever in the aftertaste.  Drinkability: Who cares if this is 10% ? If I could, I'd bring them one after another all evening. Really one of the most profound beers I've had the pleasure of tasting. I wish they were less expensive here in the U.S. Awesome.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,ColoradoBobs,4.77,"25.4 ounce bottle with cork and basket stopper purchased from Wilbur's Wine and Spirits in Ft. Collins, CO, for $8.99. Happy birthday to me.  Oh my gosh! What a beer! Really very unique. The appearance is exceptional -- kind of cloudy like you would expect a BCA to be, but a rich thick head and lots of lacing!  Incredible aroma! Mix chocolate, raisins and rye bread rising just before it goes in the oven. Wow!  Amazing taste. Very unexpected! Not the flavor I had expected from the color. Raisin, plum, yeast, a ripe banana note, high note of pineapple, but not overly sweet. My friend, who shared part of this bottle (25.4 oz is too much for one person!) said, ""Like baked raisins with all the sugar turned into alcohol."" Not much of the toasted malt or chocolate tastes I had been expecting -- just a total and wonderful surprise!  What a rich, round feel! The bottle said to serve this at 52 to 56 degrees F., and that was right! Smooth without being syrupy -- I hardly wanted to swallow this, it was so nice in the mouth.  The drinkability is fine for the first 8 oz. or so, but this is too strong to have very much.  Can't believe they sell this at the brewery for about 1 Euro a bottle!  This beer is for special occasions, and worth it. Enjoy!",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Extremely plum like. Seems like I've had a lot of beers like this lately.  Tastes so sublime in it's greatness. A perfect melding of fruity malts with a very understated yeast background. Lots of little funky critters bring out flavors that don't really have a name. Definitely plum and fig dominated. Finishes sweet and fruity with a bit of a warming glow.  Perfectly balanced between it's hugeness and it's delicate side.  It's a keeper.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Hints of brown sugar here.  Flavor is sweet and huge. This is an incredibly complex brew! Notes of coriander, brown sugar, honey, currant, sweet fruit and very earthy. Malt and hop balance is optimal.  Mouthfeel is so rich and full bodied. Coats gently and goes down easily. There's some alcohol character early on, but this fades as it warms to perfection. Finish is slightly dry, like that of a medium red wine.  This is an excellent and very drinkable brew! The only reason I would not drink more than one... I would rather save it for a better occasion.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

259,1708,woemad,4.9,"The consumption of this beer is in honor of the Eastern Washington University basketball team, who played their first ever NCAA tournament game on Friday. Yes, they lost, but they were 15th seed against 2nd seed Okla. St. That they entered halftime tied at 36 is morally the same as a win for them. And let's not forget, they did GET THERE, for the first time in my Alma Mater's history. Here's to you, Eagles!  Bottle purchased at Jim's Homebrew in Spokane for $4.23. Label - featuring a chalice-toting monk that appears to be on his second or third - looked a little weathered. I hoped this hadn't been sitting too long. Foolish me.  This is a gorgeous beer. It poured an extremely dark brown. Only some very earnest gazing while holding it up to the light showed that it wasn't, in fact, black. Big, off-white head. Thank god I had a chalice handy, or it would have taken ages to pour into a pint glass. Big, thick sheets of lacing. It stayed foamy throughout its time in my glass.  This smelled very tasty, indeed. Very winey, port-like smell, but more to it than that. There are sweet elements to it, reminiscent of the best aspects of a fruitcake. A bitter scent like raisins and figs keep the sweeter portion from becoming too cloying. What a balance!  Like the smell, this is a superbly balanced beer. The taste is very complex. Again, like the smell, there is a similarity to a good tawny port. The sensation of sweet and bitter seems to strike simultaneously. All the taste buds get to enjoy it at once. The candy-sweet taste is perfectly matched by the bitter, figgy, raisiny flavors. The high alcohol can only be faintly gleaned from the taste.  Mouthfeel is certainly unobjectionable. It actually seems full-bodied, but not to the point where I feel like I'm about to become full. So, I guess it's perfect!  Drinkability has to be slightly graded down in that it's 10%abv.

The lacing is sticky and thick and the carbonation is plentiful. Aroma is bready, malty, and slightly astringent with fruits and spices. Flavor is a sweet/tart start with a spicy middle and peppery finish. Flavors are complex and change with temperature. Mellows and smoothes as it warms, but keeps its complexity. Mouthfeel is effervescent and creamy - mellows as it warms. Full bodied and smooth, yet oily with a bite. IMHO: This is a truly great beer.

Poured out a light muddy brown with quite a bit of carbonation in this beer. Smell was mostly matls and dark fruits with an ever so sight wiff of alochol. Taste was extremely complex. Fruit hits the palate first with some malts and finishes with a nutty aftertaste and a little dry. But goes down so easy and it's so smooth. I'm so glad my local store got this beer finally.

Aroma is extremely yeasty, brown chocolate in an ocean of yeast, pure cookie dough along with caramel.. It smells sweet and brown. Taste is candi sugar, brown chocolate, hugely malty, but even more so intensively yeasty with a bit of bananas, prunes and plums and a light restrained alcohol bite. Body is medium and creamy. Wow, this is so yeasty, I wouldn't expect this from myself, but maybe too much for its own good.

259,1708,Foxman,4.62,"It pours a rich, murky, milk choclate brown, with ligher highlights at the edges. A fast two fingers of foam settles to one finger, then drops further very gradually. There are dense veils of clingy lacing.  The aroma brings sweet malt and grape characters to kick off the presentation, with peripheral berry notes widening the range. A creamy undercurrent of vanilla and mild spice lurks quietly. Yeast makes a gently sour play at the end.  Upon sipping, the poignant and well-placed sweetness of malt makes the first appearance, quickly partnered with warm tones of grape and berry. A mild spice presence can now do nothing to mask the alcohol that was intriguingly absent in the aroma. An ephemeral dry citrus note gives ground to a yeasty sourdough character at the finish, providing a full palette of taste experience. Overall, It's a thoroughly pleasing blend of basic and perfectly matched components.  Medium bodied, it lubricates and coats just sweetly enough. The progression of elements leave an interesting series of sensations on the palate.  Of all the qualities that stand out in a big beer, smoothness is very often overlooked, but not in this case. Simply, it's a smooth blend of sweet and savory balance. The flavor is all I want it to be, keeping one's attention with the interplay between all the individual pieces. The high ABV is well mitigated by everything else this excellent ale has to offer, though it does raise a wisely heeded flag of caution. Anyway, I'd likely stop at one big bottle because with anything this good, you should want to be able to savor, fully and consciously, every sip you take.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Poured a beautiful deep brown/light brown with a deep tan head. When held up to a light the beer turns a nice amber color around the edges. The smell is amazing. This has to be one of my favorite smelling beers. A malty raisin sweetness rises from the glass. This is one enjoyable beer to drink. There are a lot of flavors present with some bold fruit tastes evident at first before gently yielding to a pleasant maltiness. It is very hard to taste any alcohol even as the beer warms to room temperature. The mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy which lends to this beers incredible drinkability.

The pour, dark, deeply opaque and cloudy with the residue of yeast settling down at the bottom of the glass and a very generous rose/peach toned head that gradually fades.  The smell, profoundly malty (predominantly malty) with some rustic feel of wheat and yeast.  The taste is, however, its disappointing factor because the complexity of its fruityness is opaqued by its intense bitter malty feel that approach it more to a kwak like brew than a top notch dark belgian. The body is also a little weak for the style- not dense enough.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,jed,4.85,"Presentation: 33cl slender, brown bottle with the distinct St. Bernadus happy monk. Best if consumed by the end of 2005. Poured into a chalice.  Appearance: Pours a deep, dark brown with some hints of red near the bottom of the glass. Lots of carbonation when I opened the bottle. Huge, two finger head jumps up immediately, cake like with excellent head retention. As the head disperes, it leaves a wall of dirty lace all over the chalice.  Smell: Smells is very sweet, almost reminiscent at first of a dry Irish stout. Tons of sweet malt, as well as some fruits  plums, cherrys? Very sweet fruit aroma, without being unpleasant. A little bit of a spicy edge, some cloves, but the sweet fruit is the dominant aroma.  Taste: Wow, this is amazing! I'm not sure if my palette can make out all the flavors in this one, but I taste banana, some tart cherry, even a hint of vanilla. Midway through the strong banana fades to simpler sweetness, brown sugar and vanilla. A fig or raisin fruit flavor becomes more evident. Alcohol is very nicely concealed, aside from obvious warmth. Distinctive ""Belgian yeast"" taste is more more restrained than something like Delirium Tremens. As the beer warms, a buttery/chocolate flavor becomes more pronounced. Very strong, pleasant fruit aftertaste, mainly banana at first, although it shifts to a more raisin/bitter taste about halfway through. Warming alcohol in the finish, along with some spicy pepper and cloves. Definitely a five.  Mouthfeel: Perfect. Very smooth, as creamy as a good stout, carbonation is there without being evident.  Drinkability: This one is so drinkable it's dangerous. 10% alcohol is totally concealed, and with such a good mouthfeel I could handle a couple of these in one sitting. Now I know why the monk is smiling.  Possibly the best beer I've ever had. I'm sure this is expensive in the U.S., although I picked up a bottle here in Paris for only 2.30.

Very tightly packed fluffy off-white head foams up about 1 cm and lasts throughout sampling. The aroma is complex as hell! I get bananas, cherries, plums, black pepper maybe cloves too. First sip reveals a very creamy texture and mild carbonation. Flavor is fruity sweet cherry, pear plum up from and fades to a big tangy hit of yeastiness.

The beer retained a small layer of bubbles all throughout consumption and left some fingers of lace, but I've definitely seen better.  Smell: Dark and intense candi sugars. Pear, figs, vanilla, and carob. Overall, a dessert/sweet bread aroma. The booze becomes apparent on the nose after it warms a titch, but it's a nice smell. Wonderfully complex.  Taste: Plummy, jammy, candi sugar laced sweet malts. Kinda buttery and slightly raisiny. Mild booze taste upon warming, but it's oh-so divine.

259,1708,TheLongBeachBum,4.8,"A very familiar looking label design on the now equally familiar low slung neck 11.2 fl.oz (33cl) brown glass bottle. Says (in French) Drink before end of 2005 on the labels side writing, yet the row of numbers, 0-9, on the bottom of the label is nicked at the 1, 2, 4 and the line between the 7 and 8 mark, whatever that means.  A deep dark brown body, that is partially lucid but my Westie Glass Glass reveals some yeast chunks at the bottom. A thin but smooth looking light brown head forms easily, it is comprised of fine bubbles that stay the distance and leave some nice lacing on the goblet walls.  Hmmmm, rich rum and raisins, currants, nuts, dark berries, caramel, toffee and dark chocolate. This has a nose akin to a stronger more complex version of the Prior 8. Excellent fine levels of dissolved carbonation lend a very enticing nasal treat that begs to be deeply inhaled. Transient warm complex feelings in the mouth, this Ale is one helluva ride. Sweet malts and a rich chocolate yogurt start the proceedings, with some toffee caramel, all contribute to start the Roller coaster ride at a fast pace. Raisins and dark fruits with smooth melting milk chocolate and fresh dark coffee see you through the ups and ups of the ride. Creamy and silky, this smooth brew slides down extremely easily. A nice alcohol feel licks the tongue. Smooth and complex, this is incredibly quaffable, even for a big ass Abt 12. Wish I had a crate of this marvel.  When I first drank this beer, it had the words St.Sixtus 12 on the label because it was some aged stock from t Ostens Bierhuis during my very first visit to Belgium at Easter 1994. It was forced to dump the old moniker back in 1992. Sticks and Stones may break my bones but changing names wont hurt me. I was in awe of this marvel back in 1994, and I still am some 10 years later. I have always tried to sneak an Abt 12 during my annual Belgium trip ever since.

When the head receded, an intricate lacing pattern was left behind. The dark ruddy-brown beer was very cloudy and riddled with particulates. The sharp nose was malty and quite fruity, with notes of cherry, raisin, and coconut, with a wisp of alcohol sneaking through. The full-bodied and slighty fluffy beer was a delight for the taste buds. The fantastic slightly tart malt backbone faintly resembled a Flemish brown and was accompanied by notes of cherry, cinnamon, and banana, with a fairly dry finish.

I had to wait almost 5 mins before I could take a sip. But it was so worth the wait. The smell was sweet and malty. Very fruity, especially banana. But not real banana, like the banana flavor of banana gum or ice cream. The taste was also laden with the banana flavor, but mixed with sweet malt and other fruits flavors as well as spices like clove and perhaps nutmeg. I found the alcohol to be hidden well, although I guess some would disagree. The mouthfeel was creamy and thick. Carbonation was much less biting than I expected considering the huge head it produced when poured. Drinkability was also great. I wouldn't expect it to be with a high abv like this, but I can't help myself. The taste is so good that I must have another. To me beer just doesn't get much better than this.

In addition to the smiling Monk on the label, is a ""best before date"" in Flemish, French, and a couple other languages, that tell you to drink it before the end of 2005. Okay, I'll bite. Didn't know at the time of sampling if I would last into 2004. The Belgian ale pours into the goblet a deep, dark brown, almost opaque. The head is enormous, beige, and frothy with an abudance of tiny bubbles. Lacing slowly climbs down the glass. The aroma is of a classic brown Belgian strong ale. Bigtime Bananas in the nose, followed by the spice cabinet of coriander and allspice. Medium bodied in the mouth, tart, and a lot of carbonation. Taste begins tart and spicy. The alcohol is not well disguised. Plenty of earthy Belgian yeast notes are also on the palate. The tart fruits(grapes and plums on steroids) ride a solid malt backbone to a smooth, yet powerful finish. Very good ale, and worthy of its lofty rating. Personally, I prefer the St Bernardus Pater 6. The alcohol in the 12 is just a bit too overpowering.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,steelreign,4.12,"My 100th beer karma point.... hmmm what should I say about this that hasn't already been said? Not much, really. I will say I was a little surprised in that this bottle didn't seem as 'ripe' as it could have been. I regret not lettng it age some before trying it. Raisins, hops, cloves, banana aroma and notes... nice balance overall. I can't wait to try Westy 12 after this...",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Boilermaker88,5,"I was given this beer as part of a St. Bernardus gift set back around Thanksgiving. I finally got around to drinking the Abt 12 after having the other ""little brothers""last month. Was I right to save this for the last? Absolutely, as the others - good in their own right - pale in comparison. Poured from its 11.2oz bottle, the Abt 12 had a murky brick-red and brown hue and a light carbonation-fueled compact light tan head that left nice fine lace on the walls of my St. Bernardus chalice. The smell was so enticing; a bready malt aroma with scents of candy sugar, dark fruit, molasses, and clove all vying for attention. Some banana and spice notes as well as easily detectable alcohol vapors wafted to the nose. The taste was shocking in its complexity and in how well all the flavors complimented each other. Sweetness derived of raisins and plums covered in candy sugar layered over a soft yeasty malt flavor in front before a nutty banana and clove flavor made an appearance. A touch of tropical fruit and citrus briefly played across the palate and each sip finished with a alcohol presence that in no way detracts from the flavor profile. The feel was full, rich, and creamy. An incredibly satisfying beer. The flavors all meld so well; no one flavor washes out any other. Almost indescribable in its drinkability. A masterpiece of a beer and the only one to date that I've given straight 5's.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,granger10,4.83,I must say that I was blown away after drinking this beer. It was truly a privilege to have had it. It poured a dark brown color with a small to medium controlled tan head with lots of carbonation and bubbles running to the top. The smell is really yeasty and bready sweet. The taste is amazing. It starts out lighter in body and taste and then expands to a deep thickness. I can't believe it's 10% abv because the body and taste would tell me otherwise. The initial flavor reminds me of raisinettes. Dry fruit flavor resinates. A bready flavor ensues mixed with some yeast. It's not the base but it's very solid in the body. The yeast strain is amazing and really sets this beer apart. Each taste brought me new flavors and new insights into this beer. I must get it again!,Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,WaltTrombone,4.2,"This beer poured as brown as the bottle it comes in, with a tan head. The cage from the 750ml bottle had a best before date of 2008! The blurb on the bottle says this will cellar up to 15 years.  Aromas are malt, caramel, clove. The tastes were malt, clove, caramel, mild grapefruit. Not as complex as some others I've tried, but probably the most balanced comboination of flavors. The mouthfeel was light, with a medium carbonation, a little more than I'd expect from bottle conditioning, but not over the top. It finished with citrus, leather, malt.  Yummy, I'll have to get this again!",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,twilight,4.82,"33cl bottle. Poured into a goblet.  Hands down one of the best beers I've ever had. It pours dark reddish with a finely bubbled head that resembles the head on a bowl of proofed yeast for bread. The head isn't thick (abt 1cm), but it lasts all the way through. I can't quite pinpoint the smell, but it tends to go towards bread yeast, which I absolutely love. It smells comforting, smooth, like smelling the same way as the head is beautifully fine.  The taste is sweet, yeasty, with a slight aftertaste of alcohol, thus detracting from the mouthfeel, but still maintaining a five for the taste. It just tastes so yummy. I haven't had a strong belgian ale that retains its taste without giving a hint of the high ABV. It fits the description of 'liquid bread' too well. Too bad this is as pricey as most belgians I could spend nights just sitting back and sipping this brew.  This has indeed earned its place in the top 50, and indeed a place in my favorite beer list.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,LuckySevens82,4.75,"Bottle cap is a pain in the ass to get off, but is well worth the fight. The aroma from the bottle in concentrated and amazing. If this beer tastes half as good as it smells, it's fantastic.  Pours a dark reddish-brown with a thick 2 finger head. The head didn't last for long but the lacing is up to the top of the glass and isn't going anywhere.  The taste: Dark malts, dried fruit, spices. Just plain wonderful. It's hard to believe this is 10% abv, I could sit here and sip it all night long. There is a distinct alcohol kicker as the taste fades from your mouth, but the feeling isn't as strong as some of the other belgian ales I've had.  In my opinion, this is better and a lot more drinkable than the Westy 12. I am very happy with my choice.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,CRJMellor,4.58,"Pours deep maroon. Heavy head with enormous bubbles and amazing carbontion racing up the side of the glass. Aroma is dates, figs, dark tropical fruits, spice, cloves, candy sugar and an alcoholic tint. Wow, complex aroma, can't wait to taste. Taste is deep, dark malt with spice and slightly bitter and, yet malty aftertaste. Very complex, spicy alcoholic kicker at the end. As it warms the fruit seems to stand out even more and I get a sort of banana-like aroma and even flavor.  Absolute joy to drink, one of my highest rated beers thus far.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

My favorite out of the five I tried and judging by the marks, my favorite beer of all those I've reviewed on this site. While a very strong tasting beer, one that I thought was still quite smooth. Some nice chocolate notes, spicy fruityness, like the dankest raisins you can imagine. The alcohol was quite obvious, but certainly did not dominate the profile. Something I will seek out from now on.  EDIT 12/19: Had this a couple times since this review and have to say that I'm not as impressed. I was a little drunk when I had it last, first time too at Monks...so maybe its too be expected I inflated the score. So I knocked the taste down to 4.5.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,rkhaze,4.85,"This beer pours amber with red hues. Copiosly thick light beige head that got rocky as it dissapated, which took a while. Lots of fruit in the nose with some brown sugar and rum. Almost a kicked up juicy fruit/bubblegum smell. That obligatory Belgian yeast smell was there as well. Huge bready malt flavors. Red (prunes, raisins) and other sticky sweet fruits. Balanced by the slightly tart yeast. Alcohol was hidden extremely well. Rich, full, round velvety smooth mouthfeel that seemed lighter due to great balance and carbonation. Wicked drinkable for a 10% beer. Outstanding!",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,rdrummer,4.38,"I have been anticipating trying this one since my beer-loving friends rave about it. They were right. This is one of the good ones, pouring a cloudy amber to hazy brown brew with a lot of off-white head. The lacing is pronounced and long lived. The surprise was that it blew the cork out of the bottle when I removed the twist-wire. The first beer that I have seen do this. It is a peppy beer with lots of malt, hops, and grain in the aroma. There are hints of clove and malt in the taste, which is outstanding. This looks, tastes, feels like a true Abbey. It is creamy and rich in the mouth, and I could drink this for a long time. The high alcohol level isn't noticeable until the bottle is gone.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,BeerResearcher,4.23,"My goodness, this is one big abbey! It pours a dark chocolate brown with a full beige/tan head and some spotty and webby lace. The aroma has an over all leathery quality. It has a smell reminiscent of a horse stall (a clean one). Malt, hops, yeast and a faint alcohol fuminess round out the aroma department. There's a candy sweetness within the herbal malt body. Ripe banana, prunes, oranges and a nice clovey spiciness mingle and dance upon the taste buds. A little chocolate and brandied candy appears as it warms. The extremely happy smiling monk on the slightly crookedly placed label should serve as sign of things to come.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

This was a full flavored ale, as malt, caramel, and fruit flavors were strong. Smooth creaminess on the tongue when you first sip it, then the carbonation level caused a crisp finish. Medium bodied and alcohol levels were well hidden, making this extremely drinkable. One of the top Belgian ales I have tried.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

One of those beers that can get you really excited about abbey/Trappist ales (THIS is what it's all about!). Haven't tried Westy 12 (the beer upon which this one is based) yet, but it's coming up soon.

259,1708,byrd,4.03,"Bubbly fizzy light tan head that lasts a while. Dark reddish copper color. Spicy malt aroma with vinous and cherry notes mixed in. This is a very peppery dubbel with considerable carbonation that gives a bit of a bite on the tongue. Clove and other spices I cant place are also present. Malt notes are apparent at the start, but sweetness is minimal. Finishes with citrusy hops notes that linger in the aftertaste with the pepper notes. Mouthfeel is medium and somewhat fluffy from the carbonation. Quite a dry finish that is fairly tart. Somewhat warming on the way down.  This one improves immensely as it warms. Spice notes become more subdued, malts become more pronounced, fruitiness picks up, and all the flavors begin to meld together wonderfully. The mouthfeel becomes increasingly smooth. Malt sweetness reveals notes of bread, honey, and dark sugar. Spiciness is still present, but does not seem as excessive as it does when cold.  I typically keep my beers in the fridge and let them sit out for 5-10 minutes before opening the bottle. Evidently, I was a little over eager and opened this one while it was still a bit too cold. I was quite surprised by the changes (for the better) in flavor as Abt 12 warmed.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

The nose was full of alcohol, raisins, plums, honey, dark cherries, other dark fruits, bananas and cloves. A very nice nose!  The flavor is so complex. Massive amounts of dark fruits, apples, sweetness, a little chocolate and as it warmed the alcohol started to come out.  Overall, an incredible beer that is one notch below the Rochefort 10 but I will still drink hundreds of bottles of this beer when I am in Belgium this summer!",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,HardTarget,4.74,"Re-reviewed 2019: As the ranking metrics has adjusted from the ancient times, I wanted to up some of the scores to bring the beer into it's proper place. This was an early review for me, and this beer got me interested in other Belgian beers. Over time I came to appreciate this one more than I did at first taste, I captured a lot of the flavors, maybe missed a little bubblegum which I've found only happens at certain points in the aging process, namely about 4 to 9 months in the bottle. It's a great beer to put away for a special occasion, or when you need Tuesday to be a special occasion.  Original 2003 review (text garble kept, generated in the great transition):  4 Aroma: Powdery caramelized banana smell I associate with the style. I feel, rather than smell some alcohol, with a slight burn. 5 Appearance: Deep brown only showing ruby edges when backlit. There is a creamy sandy colored head on top of a steady stream of carbonation. I’ve been waiting for a few minutes for the head to die down, but it just looks like it’s settling in and compacting into an enduring fixture. Left a rocky lace. 4.5 Flavor: A mild and gentle blend of a world of flavors. Apples, spices, raisins, yeast, grapes, nuts, malt, slate, & pepper, and that’s just what I’m able to pick out. I think there is more in there. One thing I don’t taste is alcohol, which is a bit scary. 4.5 Mouthfeel: Silk. Has a light-medium body with a bit of an alcohol burn in the aftertaste. 4Overall Impression: Thinking this would go very well with a roast, or a beef meal. Its flavor is pronounced, but not overwhelming. The spices are reminiscent of Unibroue’s blend. Drinkability is impaired only by the alcoholic kick that has clouded my wits after the first goblet. This is truly worthy of the top 50 spot it holds, a classic brew. One to go to school on.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

It could use some time to temper the elemental crush of flavors and aromas. Think what this beer could be! ___  Update: 24 hours later I ate the thumb-sized foamscicle that had formed at the top of the bottle. It was amazing!

Sweet -- like walking into a cave of sugar and yelling ""Hello,"" it seems to reverberate in your mouth. All of this is balanced by hops burn, which combines with the sweetness to form a burning dessert. As is the case with the best beers in the world, this beer grabs you by the hand when it is cold and takes you on a journey, changing (improving!) as it warms.

The color is that of dark cocoa with some ruby hues. Gobs of cocoa on the nose. Wonderful sweet raisin and prune aromas bathed in brown sugar and butter. Damn inticing! Sweet on the nose, yet with a snappy acidity to keep focus. A dream of a brew to taste!! Full bodied, rich and malty with waves of tangy bitter chocolate, cocoa powder, sauteed prune in brown butter, exotic spice-ineffable?-vanilla, cinnamon, mollases-hard to put down!

My nose must be wired wrong because I get very little aroma from this one but hey what a taste. Without smell the taste wouldn't be so unique. The head subsides but remains lumpy and I mean that in a good way. The mouthfeel is silk....Just drink this one. I will get more. This is a celebratory beer.

Smell is not too impressive and kind of fruity. This one is all about taste to me. There's a creaminess that is appealing, to say the least.

Pours a deep jungle wood brown with red shoulders. Buoyant foam crown with tiny black specks intermixed with the brown mocha foam. More sediment on the bottom as well. Lacing up the side of the glass favors one side. Aroma is dank, warm, and fruity. It seems to have aroused the last fruit fly in our house's attention.  First sip, sweet kiss of malt and happy yeast. Free range, evidently. As it warms, more orchard flavors, sweet bready yeast, and here comes that damn fruit fly again.

As smell and taste are so well intertwined, I will simply say that the malty, banana-like quality of this beer is the stuff of dreams.

What are the little brown flecks in the cream colored head, they look like spices. This stuff leaves lace all over the glass, awesome. The aroma is of over-ripe plums, a bit of alcohol, and a really deep red wine. The color is dark, ruby brown, only a small amount of light escapes this brew. Wow, this is incredibly smooth. The alcohol smell and the 10% abv had me expecting the worse, but there's nothing to be afraid of. The taste is of dark ripe fruits, balanced by a very light nuttiness and a bit of hops to even it all out. This stuff even makes your burps taste good.

Half the beer in my glass was thick, white foam, but this led to a very smooth,almost thick and extremely creamy mouthfeel. The first sip of this brownish colored abbey style ale is bits of caramel and fruit. There's some green apple in the aroma, which in any other beer, could be considered a flaw. Almost smoky caramel flavors with bits of dark fruit such as figs or plums. Periously drinkable for its strength.

A very thick lasting rocky head tops this beer, it is very well carbonated. Very spicy tasting, accompanied by a certain mustiness. Finishes with a bit of sweetness. The dense rocky head and the Belgian lacing on this beer is quite amazing. Alcohol in the finish, along with a certain astringency. Malty, fruity, caramel notes, and a strong finish of rich fruit (perhaps plum and/or cherry). Quite a complex brew. Very light in body but quite a mouthful that will hit you when you stand up.

As Lucille Ball would say, It tastes just like candy.  The yeast too deserves a second mention. This has got to be one of the smoothest doughy yeast flavors Ive ever tasted. These are all complimented tremendously by very light spicing (hint of clove, cinnamon, etc) and fruity sugars such as the taste youd find in ripe apricots, pears dipped in honey, and apple slices rolled in brown sugar and cinnamon.  Mouthfeel  Lightly carbonated and smooth, smooth, smooth. The ale is full-bodied for sure, filling the mouth with a chewy wad of malty sugary alcohol with every bite (I mean sip).  Drinkability  Id run down my momma to get another bottle of this stuff. This is one of the most drinkable ales that I have ever tasted.  Comments  Super thanks to jreitman for laying this one on me.  Update – Had this again in ’04 just to revisit the beauty that is the St. B. Abt 12. It really is a remarkable beer and one of my favorite Belgians of all time.  Update – I had this again in 2011 and this really is one of the most complex, amazing ales ever made. I wrap into a different zone whenever I drink this beer and the consistency year over year is astounding. I would love to give this ale a perfect 5.0 but try as I may, using every method I can think of, I just can’t coax a perfect score out of the nose. Great is great though and this beer is spectacular.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,IrishRedRock,4.05,"Finally, I decide to drink my bottle of St. Bernardus 12. And having had it now, I personally see no need to compare this to Wesvleteren. In my humble opinion they are very different beers, with the Westy 12 being far superior. Maybe I have a bad bottle of this stuff, but it is still pretty good so I dont think i do.  Pours a very murky brown with just a very thin head atop. Its almost just lace. Not the massive head of Westy. Aroma is very very spicy, almost peppery. Strong notes of alcohol and grapes as well. Mouthfeel has a bit more carbonation than I expected, but still not very much. Still, it is slick and coats the tongue.  On to the flavor. Alcohol seems predominant, but leads to some mild flavors of plum and caramel. Finishes spicy and alcoholic. This is a quality strong Belgian ale, one definitely to be respected. But please, this is not a Westy 12 clone, not even close.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Stingray5,5,"Pours stunning auburn with a thick long lasting foamy white head. Intoxicating fruity aromas, with some banana and clove, multiple spices. I find I'm inhaling the aromas until there is no room left in my lungs. Getting lightheaded and not even a sip yet! Mouthful is incredible - high carbonation leads to a thick, luscious, creamy, slickness like no other. I can't stop drinking it. 2 sips and all my troubles are forgotten. Nothing else matters now. Why oh why St. Bernardus are there only 11.2 ounces of this sweet elixer in your bottle? Taste is smooth and creamy. Complimenting the wide array of dried fruit and spices is a nice toasted maltiness. A slight sweetness arrives in the finish - just the right amount. Alcohol warmth is here as well.  To hell with hops. I could live on this stuff. Superb.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,WVbeergeek,4.45,"***Update*** After picking up my first bottle from Vintage Cellar, I called them back due to the fact when I cracked the last bottle it was completely flat without carbonation. So, I called them back and let them now and they shipped out another without a problem, good customer service down there. Appearance: Lucious semi gelatinous tan colored head placed ontop of deep ruby brown cloudy body the lacing is layered in thick patches excellent appearance head is unrelenting lasts great retention. Aroma: Apple, raisin, ginger bread dough, layers of candied sugar plum brandy like tones with the alcohol layers this is excellent. Taste hasn't evolved too much since the last time I tasted but this is most definitely an experience. Mouthfeel: Creamier than before with an even smooth carbonation this one is silky in texture and devine going down.  Appearance: Pours a murky mahogany amber brown tone wih the lightest trickling bubbles of a head thin layer of bubbles on top with absolutely no lacing at all here, on top of that when I popped the cap no air released from the bottle interesting. Aroma: Ambrosia enticing spices, blends of fruit juice, alcohol infused figs, this beer is definitely out there some anise tones with a peppery finish just the most unique smell I have ever come across with all the complexity it still holds the candy like smell of wow, complex. Taste: A warming spiced up alcoholic flavor with trickles of leaves a thick dark roasted malt aftertaste on my tongue this beer is complex creamy flavor hard to describe must be experienced I guess, not sure if I love it but it's good. Mouthfeel: Is think lacking any much carbonation redefines beer I guess but overall an experience to be had, I must find some Westy 12 now but this beer is interesting. Drinkability: Challenging to the senses I am dragging just trying to figure this one out, it goes down incredibly smooth I have no idea what the abv is but I'm sure it's capable of rattling the skull.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

259,1708,jackndan,4.18,"St. Bernardus Abt 12: I understand this beer is made from the same recipe as Westervletern, and there are substantial similarities in the two brews, the most important being that they are both freaking fantastic. Nice looking brew, deep brown, virtually impregnable to light. Nice head, slightly off white, nice rocky eighth of an inch coverage.  The aroma is pleasant, although somewhat port like and vinous.  The taste is exceptional, nice malty taste, with the predominant flavor being dried fruits, such as raisons and prunes. Thick, creamy mouthfeel. The alcohol warmth is notable, in this fairly high abv beer.  St. Bernardus does not quite match the wonderful complexity of Westy, but given the fact that it is a third of the price, its well worth picking up.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

I had a huge smile on my face as I studied it for a few seconds in the glass...I had been anticipating this one for a while. It appeared a dark brownish mohagany/chestnut color in the glass, with a thin, lacy head clinging nicely to my goblet. The smell was very rich and fruity, a strong overall aroma. Heavy carbonation in the mouthfeel of this one, but still it was easy on the palate. A complex taste, definately fruity with hints of raisons and grape. Drinkability? Lets just say that I wanted to refill the goblet as soon as I was finished. A fine brew!!",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Smell - flavorful, hard to place all the flavors but very inviting slightly spicy with a lit hop aroma.  Taste - Strong, malty, and wonderfully pleasent. Nice and tart and slightly bitter all thought it leaves the lips slightly sweet. Nicely carbonated to complement the balance of hops and malts.

In appearance, this beer is dark brown with a very thin, but surprisingly persistent, whitish head. The taste is malty, spicy, a bit bready with notes of fig and a slightly burnt aftertaste.

The taste is a very fruity, yeasty, malty one, with the alcohol a bit more harsh than in the Westy 12. Mouthfeel was creamy yet tasting of alcohol. Drinkability-wise, could have a few more.  Though not quite as good as Westy 12, this is also 1/3rd the price. A wonderful treat, and certainly something that I'd have again.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99

Aroma is sweet, fruity and malty. Mouthfeel is crisp yet creamy and full bodied. Really smooth. Has a wonderful big fruity malty flavor. The aroma and flavor here are in my opinion brighter and bigger than the Rochefort. I could drink a few of these quite easily.

It was a nice dark brownish color with a huge head. It was very pleasant to my nose. Very spicy smell. The taste was very complex but not what I expected. There wasn't as much spice as was in the smell. It had a different taste than I can descibe. I could taste the alcohol in the end. It wasn't overpowering though, amazing at %10, it was a very pleasant alcohol taste. I think I may have served this too warm. I will definitely give this beer another chance.

There is lots and lots of lace left behind with each sip. The smell is fruity and pleasant, banana and raisins mixed with just a hint of alcohol. The taste brings forth plums and raisins mixed with sherry. The alcohol, along with the hops, is only slightly noticeable. The body is thick and silky smooth.

Head spread out and rose to a slight 1/4 of an inch to start, perhaps because of the glass. Big thick sheets of lace. A vinous nose, lots of rum and candied citrons -- and alcohol. This bad boy says alcohol quick, brandy mixes with bing cherries and a pronounced ginger. Finishes with a great fresh manure earthiness, but also with a very well done sense of medium and balancing carbonation. Alcoholic, coating and full-bodied, very heavy-duty to my tongue.

Smell is quite complex with notes of dates, raisins, alcohol and yeast. The taste is vastly complex, as well. Here, notes of spice, yeast, dates, raisins, figs and alcohol are all well represented. This is certainly one tasty brew. Mouthfeel is quite luxurious with mild carbonation and an overall creamy texture. With the amount of alcohol in this one, it's really hard to detect overall.

259,1708,MJR,4.73,"Appearance: Pours a dark reddish-brown that is quite clear from a careful pour. A thick tan head starts at a full finger thick and holds strong at a sturdy cap. Adding the yeast sediment towards the end darkens the brew considerably.  Smell: The aroma is rustic and rich with a generous helping of dark fruits: raisons, plums, and dates. Rum-soaked cherries add a sharpness. There's a strong bready smell, as well as a hint of phenolics. The alcohol is hidden well, only showing itself slighty.  Taste: Wonderfully complex and bittersweet with a fantastic balance between the sweet, dark fruits and bitter hops. Lots of Concord grapes, plums, and bananas. What starts out fruity, midway melds with a peppery spiciness, along with a taste similar to warm raison bread. Hefty dose of yeast and earth on the tail end. Finishes with a touch of a phenolic note, and a rush of warming alcohol.  Mouthfeel: Thick and rich, but not the least bit cloying. Very warming and smooth...  Drinkability: Damn good! This is widely believed to be the same recipe as Westy 12, and it's just as good.

259,1708,cokes,4.88,"The war horn sounds under a clouded brown sky, with gradients of orange as light infiltrates the edges of the horizion. A large storm cloud of French vanilla-hued cream lies directly overhead.  The battalions converge, preceded by aromatics of clove, candied plums, merlot, chalk dust and oak.  And so it begins...  An epic clash of fruit and spice. Loads of cloves draw swords with ripe prunes. Raisins come swashbuckling down from the hills. In another duel, banana esters rumble with black pepper. Mace-wielding Carobs whallop the crippled and weakened tropical fruit brigade. Walnuts and chocolate join forces against Concord grapes. A hissing sugar cookie dart fired from a dough crowbow strikes and falls a farmy footsoldier and the horse that carried him.  The echoing shrieks fade, as a fruit-cake laden sword clanks upon the ground.  In the wake of the melee, only Brandy alcohol and the doughy union of malt and yeast remain standing. A fierce glare is exchanged, then they walk away. The atmosphere remains energized and thick. This will certainly be resumed another day.  Delicately embittered hop minions clean up the carnage.

It's a pure temptation to look at this brew. Malt sweetness and alcohol are in the aroma strongly, also plums. WOW, there's a lot going on here.....chocolate and coffee, yeast and banana, spices, caramel, high levels of sweetness and syrupy alcohol. The alcohol really makes a stand in the aftertaste.

259,1708,taez555,4,"This beer poured a HUGE firm very fine white/beige head. The head itself took several minutes to die down to the point where I could even start to taste it. It did however give me time to admire the dark brown almost ruby colored body.  The smell was very sweet and fruity. With banana and clove smells that almost reminded me of some german heffeweizens.  The taste of this beer was very nice. A rather full bodied thick beer, with a lot of up front bitterness followed by some beautiful raisin, plum and even chocolate tones. From start to finish it just passes over the tongue in one smooth motion. The alcohol was a bit more present than I expected, but not overshadowing in any way. Very well balanced. Maybe only a touch to bitter , but otherwise very well done.  It finished very soft, with some lingering bitterness and spice.  To be perfectly honest I found this beer to be a very middle of the road belgian.

Not I, not I!!  Color is a dark russet brown, and head is enormous, majestic, utterly awesome!  Aroma hits you right off: earthy, nutty, and not merely deep, but cavernous. Incredibly complex, and utterly gorgeous: cocoa,plum, port wine, medicine, and a very apparent alcoholic character, plus anise, pepper, and more, so much more!  On first sip, I can't help but think that ""complexity"" is a shallow term with which to circumscribe the many aspects of this amazing brew. So much to contend with, so much going on! I need to take a breath and reel from the feeling, and seek relief from the rush! Extraordinary!  Integration is perfect: there are hops aplenty, and massive malt, but nothing sticks out above or beyond, it all joins forces to create this amazing masterpiece.  Was this only 10%?

Maybe banana or citrus.  Tastes so good I hope I can describe. Figs, banana, citrus. Don't hurry 15 minutes later your mouth is still full of flavor. I love the carbonated bite. This is one of the Best Belgians you will try. Alcohol is not overwhelming until you have finished. One will give you a nice buzz.  I have trouble describing the experience of drinking this beer but I know this is an exceptional beer. I like the label also. Do not pass up the Tripel(green label) That is a good one also.

It pours a deep burgundy hue with an excellent head and hints of rasins, figs and a fine lace upon settling. Its just one of those beers you could take a sip of and let it sit in your mouth for 30 seconds before swallowing. Excellent balance, given its heavy alcohol content. Just the right amount of malt. When tasting a Westie Abbey alongside of Abt 12, I actually found the Abt 12 to be more enjoyable. Definately give this one a look the next time you're at your favorite shop.

259,1708,nomad,4.8,"Pours a very darkened ruby color with great clarity and hue. The carbonation made a pockmarked thick frothy head, was nice to peer at.  Had some lace that fell fairly fast. Nose was very fruity-malty (grape, dark chocolate), and had a spice that seemed like coconut but darker. A slightly medicinal tone as well, and on whirl of the liquid I picked up an alcohol scent of a wine type.  Taste was fruity (darkly so) and malty (akin to dark syrup). Had a soft spice like a roasted coconut mixed with an earthy yeast flavor. A little chewy with a soft mouthfeel, but extremely drinkable. It left a very yummy but peculiar hops flavor  not the bitter, graprefuity type, but more like a salad greens taste (mesclun, arugula). Long finish that tasted like how soft choose lingers. Also gave off a damn yummy burp! Overall, smooth but large maltiness with a subtle though not small stance on the palette.  Simple but effective - an excellent dark and malty beer with that great Belgian bent to it.  EDIT: Okay, many months later and this beer has become my favorite ""big and darker"" Belgian.

Wonderful nose banana, rum, raisin, prunes, sugary candy, and alcohol; complex and inviting. A heavenly quaff, the first sips race its joy straight to the brain yet simultaneously warming the belly. Ultra complex palate The alcohol seems to be a tasty blend of wine & rum with passionate dark, rich fruits mixed with the subtly spicy peppery hints. Then for good measure, well placed bubble gum notes. The malt foundation is perfect. The abv is concealed in the taste not so much with the warming effect though. I find the mouthfeel to be almost ideal just a tad thin at times, no complaints though. The drinkability is phenomenal for the potency and complexity of this beer. An absolute gem of a beer, it is worthy of its World Class reputation.  For $3.50 an 11.2 oz. bottle it is a steal.

259,1708,shirfan,4.38,"Muddy, translucent mahogany-brown, this had a pillowy floater of a head that took forever to level off...and still kept a good 1/8 inch at all times, with excellent lacing.  Aroma is a bit musty and warm, notes of baked fruit, malt, and alcohol.  Very striking is the ""melts in your mouth"" feel of this beer, almost perfect carbonation. A high level of sweetness without feeling sticky or cloying, rounded out by the not especially discreet alcohol. However, this doesn't taste rough in the least.  Taste starts sweet, malty, and warming. A complex body, notes of raisins, pears, candy apples, and hearty malt. A perfectly clean but sweet finish, with a bit of a kick mingled in.  There's a reason the monk on the label is smiling broadly; even aware of the high ABV, I'm feeling this going to my head 2/3 of the way through a single bottle.

259,1708,StevieW,4.5,"12 oz bottle. Foamer. Murky brown with burgundy hints. Prodigious (did I just say that ?) head. Foamy and rich, covered the side of the glass completely. The head stayed in little clumps on the surface. Initial smell were plums, figs, and earthiness combined with a super malty candy sweetness. Smells smoothed out to a mellow carmel candy sweetness and some fig undertones. Overall very pleasant and supersmooth. First taste was a combination of the above mentioned carmel sweetness but with a hot shocking alcohol presence. I thought for a couple minutes I had over estimated this beer, or maybe expected more. As the beer settled the candied sweetness took over, nearly syrupy but falls short of that. Lots of figgy, rum soaked raisins, and malty sweetness dominate the taste. Sticky sweet but not overwhelming. Touch of cotton candy dryness then finishes. Tastes melt together better as the beer sits a while. Medium bodied, perfectly carbonated.

This beer pours a dark brown colour into my Westvleteren Chalice. It has an immense head and a wonderful aroma of figs, dark fruits, alcohol, sugar, various spice and multiple malts. This tasted like more of the same. Super Complex! The alcohol helped tame down the sweetness that I am not too fond of in the St. Bernardus line of beers and so this abt 12 was really the best of the bunch.

259,1708,longpondbeerman,4.38,"From this brightly labeled bottle the Abt 12 poured a dark caramel with just a minimum of light showing through when I held it up to the lamp. There was a big, light tan head, and the heavy carbonation was clearly visible. I noticed immediately a tart (gingery) aroma--with raisens, cloves, and dates mixed in; very intricate. The taste was initially sharper than I expected, perhaps because of the high alcohol content, which was not at all overwhelming; but the complexity I noticed in the smell remained evident in the taste too. The mouthfeel was excellent, with a soft, syrupy consistency--a good ale to sip slowly. I could not drink too many of these puppies at one sitting, but I now understand why the monk on the label has such a broad smile on his face.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,ElGuapo,4.57,"A deep brown cloudy brew with a big tannish foam on top. Aromas of bread, spice, and roasty malts jump out of the glass. A great whiffing beer. Your nose is in sniffing Heaven as it skips through the array of fine aromas.  This is a wonderful beer. Full of flavor and body. The carbonation is at a perfect level. Spices are a vital part of the flavor of this brew. Roasty malts with light flavors of coffee and caramel come out. You will also pick up yeast and breadiness. The alcohol is almost completely invisible to your taste buds. Balance is incredible. It is an absolute work of art.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,GreatPondBrewer,4.47,"Damn fine beer no doubt. Poured a dark red with a huge, pillowy off white head with some fine looking bubbles. The smell was full of raisins, cloves and other sweet fruits, perhaps mellon and just a little hint of alcohol. The taste was syrupy, sweet with notes of cherries rolling off my tongue. The carbonations gave an flavorful sensation on the back of my tongue as the nectar flowed down my throat. Great strong ale that hides the alcohol very well.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,jeffboo,4.28,"An Abbey ale that keeps on giving until the glass is drained (and even then the thick head sits on the bottom,not wanting to leave). This beer was a pleasant surprise from the rare beer store at realbeer.com. It poured dark brown with a thick tan head that wasn't going anywhere fast. The aromas of banana,brown sugar,rum,ripe plums and spice was nice. It started out whiskeyish with a malty sweet long finish that seemed a little thin at cellar temp but became creamy smooth as it warmed. More notes of raisin bread with an alcoholic toasty/nuttiness in the finish. A great evening sipper.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,scottum,4.08,Pours out dark dark brown with a beautiful off white head that never dies. This is one of the most complex brews I've ever tasted. There's a party in my mouth! There is a clovelike taste. Sweet and fruity flavors also override my tastebuds. The alcohol taste is also very much there. If a beer could melt in your mouth this one would. Feels really nice going down. I think this may be a bit too much of a beer for me though. Alas. The flavors are a bit overboard in my opinion. I'd like to taste a bottle of this that has been aged a few years.,Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,UncleJimbo,3.73,"12 oz amber bottle with a blue label and cap. $4.49 per bottle.  Poured a cloudy brown (""iced tea"" brown) with thick, rich, light tan foam that left good lace on the glass. The smell was malty and biscuity with the smell of roasted banana. The taste was good, but the flavor of alcohol was very apparent. Very slightly sweet taste of malt with a hint of fruit and some phenols, with a touch of bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel was warming (the alcohol), creamy and smooth, but with an astringent finish. The drinkability was OK, but the alcohol flavor was too prominent.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,aracauna,4.33,"Okay, supposedly this is made to the same recipe at Westvleteren 12, but I'm not seeing it. Huge, meringue head is appropriate to the style. Very sticky and I saw caves forming in the head along the sides of the glass as smaller bubbles became large but were unable to move because of the viscosity of the rest of the foam. The body is a very dark brown, cloudy. The nose is earthy, similar to some of the smells of a vegetable garden towards the end of harvest. The first flavor that hit me was cotton candy but this was while I was getting nothing but foam. It also seemed a little hot then. There's a butteriness to it that blends nicely into the chocolate and toffee malts. Ripe bananas over peaches a bit past their prime meld in nicely as well. Very low bitterness and the alcohol is covered extremely well. There's also a slight vinous character to it and there's something there that reminds me of the homemade wine my church uses for Communion. The mouth feel is very slick and creamy. This beer forces you to drink it slowly whether you want to or not. Since I'm enjoying it, I want to do so.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,maxpower,4.6,"Small 330ml bottle, pours a thick cloudy brownish color with a huge frothy and creamy biege lasting head that leaves clingy sheets of lace in my glass, nice malty and sweet yet spicy aroma. Sweet and fruity malty flavors, nice and smooth creamy soft mouthfeel,full body with a lively carbonation, finishes with a pleasant sweet and spicy aftertaste, alcohol very well hidden, I love this one.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Sidabeef7,4.57,"The joyous monk on the label says it all. This is another great from the Belgians. It pours with an opaque, amber appearance that is accompanied by smell of fruit and malt. The Abt 12 goes down very smoothly with tastes of ripe fruit and bread. Let me not forget the alcohol which is apparent on the finish and lets itself be known on the way down. Overall, this is a tasty and complex abbey beer that is much easier to come-by (and cheaper) than Westvleteren or Rochefort.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,jtw5877,4.85,"First of all, WOW. This stuff is excellent. Pours a deep brown hue with a thick light tan head. Strong maltiness, Caramel and biscuity taste. Complex malt profile that becomes more complex as it warms. I am really starting to love Belgian Beers. I'd recommend this one for anybody who needs a change of pace from hoppier beer.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Jason,4.4,"Appearance: The glass is rimming with lace, hazed brown colour gives the appearance some depth.  Smell: A spike of clove, layers of ripe fruit and malt sweetness are what the aroma is all about.  Taste: Clove is certain to be the first flavour you taste as it rides the wave of sweetness, big brown sugar flavour with some cake like malty qualities. Some buttery and phenolic flavours shoot to the palate in the middle to make it a bit juicy. Some earth and carob flavours in the mix. Alcohol is a little evident, it hiding under the sweetness right behind the fruity flavour that soon flare into esters and mild solvent flavours. Finishes sweet and warming.  Mouthfeel: Exceedingly smooth with a creamy full body after the smoothness moves through.  Drinkability & Notes: I&#8217;d have no problem sipping this all night long. A heavenly abbey ale that goes down as one of the best for me.  Thanks to D & V International for the sample. http://www.specialtybeer.com",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Bierman9,4.5,"My second foray into the St. B's biers... though the label on mine says 10%, not 12. Ahh, whats 2% amongst friends, eh? The 12 has a verrry dark brown color, nearing the point of opaqueness if not already there. Head is tan, very finely-bubbled, creamy, and forms a thin layer over the aforementioned opaque brown liquid. Lacing was just an after-thought, though. Mouthfeel was similar to the Tripel I just imbibed; medium-plus in the body, and it lightly teases the tongue with some fine carbonation. The aroma was not too difficult to discern. Some malt (with a chocolate lean to it?), a suggestion of dark fruit, and perhaps intimations of alcohol.  Flavors were hard to pin down, yet I liked them none-the-less! Mild notes of dark fruit; malty sweetness; candi-sugar; a nudge of yeastiness.... and alcohol warmth to boot! Pleasantly pleasing!! Zum Wohl!!  overall: 4.5 appearance: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | mouthfeel: 4.5 | drinkability: 4.5  457",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,RBorsato,4.79,"Deep dark brown, murky chocolate color (dark red, burgundy to light) with a big pillowy head. Leaves large sheets of lace. Fruity raisiney aroma and taste. A flavor I can only simply describe as a double dubbel. Faint alcohol aroma and taste which becomes more prominent as it warms. Seems well balanced but hard to tell due to the strength of flavor. Medium-full body despite high carbonation levels so you know this baby is strong.  Label states: ""Abbey Ale"" & 10% ABV.  [11.3 oz / 33cl bottle]",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,hyuga,4.95,"Hazy, almost opaque dark brown with the characteristic off-white head of this style. The head stays at a good level. Great aroma! Dark fruits (mostly plum), yeast spiciness, caramelly sweetness, and a good amount of coconut. Alcohol is only very slightly noticeable in the aroma, impressive for a 10% brew. What a taste! This is delicious! It's like doppelbock meets Belgian strong ale. At the front, sweet and spicy with caramel and that special yeast spiciness. Noticeable after that in the middle is a slight coconut character on top of the aforementioned flavors. Dark fruits (raisin, fig, and plum) make up the rest of the full body. Alcohol is not at all detectable in the flavor, but it does eventually show up in another form, numbing your mouth a good deal and making your head spin a bit. Retro-olfaction brings out some bready maltiness. Good amount of carbonation for the mouthfeel; not too much, not too little. I'm definitely reminded of the reasons for this being my favorite beer style. Even the aftertaste leaves you wanting more. This has become one of my favorite beers, #1 or 2 even, if I were to make a list. If you run across this, don't even think of leaving the store without it. It is a bit pricey, but less than a lot of the other Belgians, and definitely worth it. I was informed that this was only recently made available to us here in Arizona. I picked it up in a gift pack. I hope after the gift pack season is over they'll still carry this beer.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,JohnnyDuvel,4.75,"My bottle listed alcohol as 10% by volume. Alcohol definitely present in the taste. Quite creamy, large head, remained prominent throughout. Significant lace. Nice, somewhat spicy fragrance and taste. Clearly a very high quality beer. I followed this with a Rochefort 10, which was a quite different (and ultimately more enjoyable) experience! This is like a slightly thinner Westy 12. Not as rich or complex as the Westy, but not far off. Very good, gets better as it warms. Handles the 10% abv quite well. Better than Chimay blue (IMO), and I'll certainly take it over Trios Pistoles. One of the best!",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,marc77,4.57,"Murky reddish brown hue. Well retained, thick, light tan head. Yeast derived nuttiness and rustic must at first in aroma, ensued by ripe peach like fruitiness, mellow banana esters and notes of molasses and butter. Hint of pleasantly salty mineraliness is discernible as well. Toffeeish malt and mild banana esters are perceived concomitantly initially in flavor, then are ceded by smooth notes of carob and clove. Malt character is bready sweet, akin to brown sugar dusted crusty whole wheat bread. Understated notes of dark fruit including typical prune like notes uniquely coupled with a citric tartness. Hint of bubblegum esters. Moderately bodied. Once the initially high carbonation diminishes, the mouthfeel is full, smooth and very pleasant. Finishes with light clove and caramel briefly lingering. Abt 12 is a delicious, complex, and supremely drinkable brew. Flavorwise, it's reminescent of their 8, although much more pronounced all around. Highly recommended and worth the cost.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Wildman,4.85,"This beer poured a dark amber color and formed an off white sudsy head that left circular lace. A good deal of carbonation was present. It had an aroma of malt, caramel and fruit. A flavor of malt, caramel and spicy fruit. A very strong flavor element and finish going on with this beer. A very impressive beer.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Bighuge,4.77,"I believe the label reads best by end of 2003 in some other language. (""Tenminste houdbaar tot eind 2003"")  Murky looking brown color. A meringue-like thin brown head tops of this beauty and provides a spiderweb-like pattern of lace. Sweet candy, must, yeast and esters of bubblegum and banana present on the nose. This is one tasty beverage. Very slight alcohol on the tongue. Mixed and subtle tones of fruity esters, sweet cotton candy, vanilla and dry wood. Carbonated just right. Glides over the tongue effortlessly. This one is a dandy.  Gotta give props to pbrian for this beer, the last one left from his shipment. What a beer! Thanks.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,Gusler,5,"St. Bernardus has been a long time favorite beer and brewery, and is one of only 8 beers from my nearly 6000 sampled life time to get a 5.0 from me. It is a beer that I have a case or two of at all times, and trust me it only improves with age. The beer emerges from the 12 ounce bottle a slightly bemused brown color with a majestic crown of tan to top off the body, the texture is semi creamy, and the lace forms a satin skirt to surround the glass. Nose is sumptuous, nutty sweet, bubble gummy, raisin like, fresh and pleasing to the senses, a most ""Sniffable"" beer. Front is ambrosial with a nice malt presence, the top is light to medium in its feel to the palate, with the finish congenially dry, magisterially hopped, notably acidic with a pleasant tummy warming sensation to top it all off, a treasure not to be missed if your into ""Belgian Ales"", and or just like a great beer.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,mmthompson33,4.92,"This beer kicks Chimay's ass, but has difficulty in the ring with a Rochefort 10. Taking a drink of this foamy maple-brown Abbey creation is like taking a bite of a caramel covered apple, with a hint of brown sugar added for flavor. The slick salesman monk on the label conveys the beauty of this beer marvelously. Looks and tastes like the beer has not changed or lost a bit of it's originality since it was first brewed. Truly one of the most complex strong belgians out there. St. Bernardus is one hell of a brewery.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
259,1708,rastaman,2.73,"i'll have to be a real bastard here and disagree with everyone, i just thought it was too strong for its own good, the alcohol showed way to much.

Hits your mouth spritzy but then slides down your throat in a flash, leaving you with a warm alcohol buzz and a mouth-coating sweetness. Flavors detected are raisons, rum, spicey yeast. The overall profile leaves no doubt about the use of candy sugars. When I came back to the last sip an hour later, the fusel alcohol came out my nose.

Smell: Rich, malty aroma.  Taste: Full-bodied, smooth and creamy mouthfeel. Rich and malty with a semi-grape sweetness that mingles in with some dark ripe fruity esters. The alcohol is very apparent, warming as hell!  Notes: Sheer bliss. Viewed as an abbey beer. According to Daisy (owner of 't Brugs Beertje), this beer follows the same recipe, uses the same water and its hops comes from the same hop regions as Westvleteren. ""Abt"" means the ""highest rank."" They also make a ""Prior"" at about half the strength.",Brouwerij St. Bernardus NV,Belgium,Quadrupel (Quad),99
