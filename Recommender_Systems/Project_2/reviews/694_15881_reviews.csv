694,15881,BloodSoakedAleMug,4.43,"Flavors of apricot jam, peach preserve, brown sugar, graham crackers, toffee, orange zest and savory mango. Malty, soft and smooth with hints of tropical fruit. Aroma follows the palate, but with more emphasis on the orange zest. Mouthfeel is crisp and highly drinkable, but still relatively full bodied and rich.

694,15881,JohnniEMc,4.26,"Dark copper-amber, but bright and almost translucent, a clear pint glass full of it reveals. There's virtually no head to describe, but that's the Philly style of serving draft beers. Even without a head, it's a lovely beer. Little aroma rises above the glass, a little malt a little hops and no discernable alcohol. This is one of those that doesn't offer much to the nose, but gives the tongue a workout. Quickly, it's learned that regardless of the word ""nectar"" in its name, this isn't some sort of overly sweetened ale. There is some sweetness provided by ample malting, but this one bites. There's just the right dose of alcohol in the mix that it amplifies the sharp hoppiness, which is noteworthy. With notes of pine and citrus, this is a bitterly hopped brew (a good thing) that brings so much more character than most in this style. The glass lacing is a little short. So, this isn't one for the nose and maybe not long for the eyes. It is a complex hopfest within a solid malted body.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,SWOhio-aquifer,5,"Rare 5 out 5. Looking for balanced And if so high marks it will receive. No hop bomb but you can taste the some of the ""excessively dry hopped,"" But sage quickly to a malt creamy goodness. If you're looking for a hop slinger move on but if you're looking for great tasting grab it whem you can. Cheers!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,dano213,4.19,"16oz can purchased from the fridge as a single from a local bottle shop for $4.55. ""Freshest by 04/28/2023""....given that this was released pretty recently (January 10th), I would say that this beer is less than one month old.  Look: Pours a clear medium amber color with a tan-colored head that slowly dissipated to a very thin layer. Looks very nice.  Smell: Very nice aromas of fresh hops - earthy, resinous pine along with some dankness, woody notes, and grapefruit notes. There's a bit of caramel sweetness underneath all of that hop aroma. This beer smells a bit like a slightly stronger version of Sierra Nevada Celebration Ale.  Taste: It's surprisingly balanced, refreshing, and drinkable. Up front, it has a very nice maltiness with the caramel notes coming through briefly before being taken over by hops. The finish is actually not nearly as bitter as I was expecting; it's relatively smooth and has a pleasant long-lingering bitterness that is not very intense. Nice grapefruit rind flavors on the finish also.  Feel: The mouthfeel is a bit chewy. Nicely carbonated. Medium plus body.  Overall: This beer brings back memories. The first time I had this beer was in the mid- to late- 2000s in Atlanta. Someone had acquired this beer in a trade (I think) and brought it to a beer share. I was blown away by this beer. There aren't many other Imperial Red Ales out there. One that I used to consume a lot of was Terrapin's Big Hoppy Monster. Fast forward to living in PA: I moved here just over 10 years ago. It was probably 9 years ago when I made a feeble attempt to procure some Nugget Nectar. I called a beer distributor that I passed on my way to work and at that time the state laws only allowed them to sell entire cases. I wasn't able to buy/consume that much beer so I passed. Hard to believe that it's been over 15 years since I have had this beer! Enough with story time. This beer certainly deserves its #1 ranking among Imperial Red Ales.  From the can and website: Color: Straw/Orange Hops: Nugget, Warrior, Tomahawk, Simcoe, Palisade Grain: Munich, Pilsner, Vienna Yeast: Ale  It's impossible to forget your first squeeze. Once a year, as the newest humulus lupulus harvest arrives at Tröegs, we blend these super-fresh hops into an Imperial Amber Ale. Exclusively dry-hopped, Nugget Nectar is an explosion of pine, resin and mango.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Bluerabbitbell,4.32,"Enjoying at the brewery in Hershey, PA, on the way home from our after Christmas trip to Bethlehem and Philly, PA. 12/28/22.  Gorgeous amber color, full head that dissipated leaving a beautiful lacing on the glass.  It was hard to get the aroma as the smells inside the brewery are so strong that's all I could smell, the only downer. Could almost smell grapefruit and papaya.  (Edit from having at home from a poured 12oz bottle bought from Troegs) stone fruit, malty sweetness and pine.  The mouthfeel is bright with light carbonation and smooth as velvet with a slight drying of the mouth.  And now to the flavor profile! This is one amazing, well-balanced beer! Bright hoppiness gives way to luscious mango, pine, and grapefruit. I could drink this all day! One of Leah's favs!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,DrOfGolf,4.41,Wow! Drank this one ice cold and right out of the can. When I opened it the beer was filled right up to the top and sort of just overflowed a bit. The smell was hops and hops and exactly what I like. The taste was definitely of a hoppy nature and the ABV just adds to the enjoyment. I will positively be looking for more when I can.,Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,TBoneJones,4.5,"Finally had several of these sent from some NJ family so I can try this top-notch-hyped imperial red. I could never catch it available when visiting. Pours a deep and clear golden color with a modest head. Nose is like sweet cakey/ candies malts and hops all together, makes me want to taste. The flavor goes there, it’s so much flavor up front with sweet caramel and tasty hops, just a well-balanced impeccable red IPA. Resin/ earthiness is a defining characteristic, and it’s tasty. Tingly fresh hop bitterness lives in this beer. It ends superbly. Amazing balance. Feels perfect. Smooth and smooth, then smooth. Slight stickiness, vanishes superbly and I’m ready for more. I can see why this gets the love. It’s like a Hop Wallop meets a red ale, masterfully and silky.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,harrypowers,4.25,"Pours a nearly clear mahogany color with a small foamy white head and a moderate amount of lacing.  Smells of piney, grassy hops and malt.  Tastes of mildly bitter, peppery hops throughout with smaller tastes malt, caramel and pineapple.  Medium body with light carbonation. Smooth dry mouthfeel.  This beer is an enjoyable mash up of a Wee Heavy and a West Coast IPA. Scotch IPA?",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,milkshakebeersucks,4.35,"One of those beers I drink plenty of and then surprised that I haven't rated it yet. So anyway, an attractive appearance; clear copper, nice size head, good lacing. Aroma is equally appealing, earthy and herbal with subtle notes of citrus. Resinous quality on the palate along with the herbal influence. Finishes a bit spicy. Bitterness adds depth and balance. Best by date of 5/11/22",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,bankboy66,3.69,Beautiful pour with one finger foam. Smell is pine and malt. The taste is very much on the edge of IPA…..almost too close. I don’t have much experience with this style but if you told me it was an IPA I wouldn’t bat an eye. Keep that in mind before you try …. This is hoppier than your average Red.,Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Whyteboar,4.44,"Poured a very pleasing amber color with active carbonation and a manila folder (Google it if you've never seen one) colored head that left plenty of lacing. Aroma, even to my chemical damaged nose, was very nice. Obvious malts and hops play parts in the dance; I can't say I got the ""pine, resin and mango"" that the can states are prominent but it is very pleasant. The taste, found it hard not to think of this as an IPA, it's just on that cusp. Likely the hoppiest red ale I've ever had, but that's not a bad thing at all; it's delicious! The feel falters only in that it's way to drinkable for it's ABV. I could quaff this down by the liter if given the opportunity. OA, Seriously good beer, all the way around. The denizens of Hershey, PA are fortunate to have this on tap.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,beergoot,4.29,"Clear and bright body, medium amber colored; excellent carbonation, fine bubbles and gently rising; huge, white head, sculpted and densely creamy. Strong scent of pine resin offset with gentle caramel notes. Outstanding taste, well-balanced and complex; light malt base with a moderate to bold hop bitterness; some peppery spiciness. Medium-heavy body; softly abrasive; light sweetness countered with a moderate overall dryness.

694,15881,Pineroom,4.83,On tap in the pine room in a frosty pint glass. Perfectly balanced. Hoppy but not too. A hint of sweetness. Nice soft head.  Hard to stop pouring this beer and at 7.5 …. My current fav!,Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

I hate to drink it because it looks so nice. S: Mostly hop bitterness, a few citrus notes. T: Just nailed-on balance between the malt and hops, slightly resinous finish F: Very smooth, a little sticky. O: Worth the hype, the highlight of the Tröegs lineup for me. Almost by itself makes PA winter tolerable.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,tcc,4.31,"I suppose I'll contradict myself and say that I'm not overly enthusiastic about beers with ramped up ABV scores. Too often, I find that the pleasure of the mouthfeel is compromised when the main thing you taste is the octane. With that said, I'm always impressed by beers that are a little stronger but bring the complex flavor into the foreground. Seems like that's the kind of thing ""craft"" is all about. I do love the Tröegs company and their creativity and sensibility, but I don't love all their beers (which is no knock on them at all). But for my money, Nugget Nectar is some of their finest work. It's such a pleasurable beer to drink; flavorful with a kind of well-earned sweetness, beautiful balance of the different hop notes and malt, and a stunning color in the glass. Over the years, I've cycled through a number of Tröegs beers, giving many a try, but I'm finally prepared to say that this is my favorite of all I've tried. This is the one I wait for every year and buy whenever it comes to my beer store.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

If would have tasted this blind I would have called it an IPA and while I have not had a lot of red ales this one is excellent.

694,15881,AElfwine_Nerevar,4.23,"From a can with a BB of 05/12/21  L: Pours a medium amber with excellent clarity. An aggressive pour yields two fingers of fine, khaki head with good retention. As the beer recedes in the glass it leave a nice webbed lacing.  S: Very weak nose. I get a bit of caramel malt and a hint of C-hop character. The nose seems to be faded.  T: I get toffee, caramel, grapefruit, honey graham cracker, light herbal notes that transition into resinous pine, tangerine, a bit of citrus pith, and a light earthy spice character on the finish. A very nice bitterness complements the above flavors. Wow this one has an impressive palate!  F: Medium body with medium-light carbonation. The mouthfeel is a bit creamy, but also resinous on the finish. The finish has a minimal dryness, but just enough to bring your mouth back to the glass.  O: Why did I wait so long to try this?

Great lacing and cling and occasional rising carb bubbles are visible through the clear, ever so slightly chill hazed beer. Aromas of rich caramel malt and deep pine forest, orange jam with honey smeared over lightly toasted bread. faint hints of apple and maple. Flavor is weak up front and body is thin on the tongue. But it's still cold so I'll wait a bit............ Rich, complex malt flavor move in as it warms. Delicious toffee and lush fruit - berries and watermelon blend right into warm pine bite of hops.

It’s filled out by a nice tropical fruit character of pineapple and citrus. Very drinkable beer. Could crush a few. Has a nice amber red body with a fluffy white head. Altogether a world class ipa.

694,15881,Rug,4.42,"Best by 5/12/21  I'm very excited for this one, and I'm really not sure how I haven't tried it yet. My first imperial red, and it's the highest rated of the style! This is a truly legendary beer, and I'm so happy to finally try it. Let's not waste any more time and just dive in  Pours an absolutely crystal clear golden amber with a finger and a half of soapy white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves great lacing  The simplicity of the aroma is quite appealing, as it shows a great balance between malt and hops. I'm picking up on aromas of pithy grapefruit, resinous piney hops, honey sweetness, lightly spicy red malt, doughy bread, and juicy orange  The somewhat understated aroma really pops in flavor, but maintains the fantastic balance that it set up. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting fresh pine, juicy orange, honey, doughy malt, and a hint of pepper. The swallow brings notes of dank weed, underripe melon, grapefruit, red malt, oily hops, and crisp bready malt  A medium body pairs with mild carbonation, resulting in a super smooth and crisp beer, drinking well under 7.5% Finishes incredibly dry with a nice lingering bitterness  Well shit, color me impressed. It's so simple, but it's more than just the sum of its parts. I need more. I could find some really good food pairings for this one",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,jrc1093,4.23,"Best before 4/29/21; consumed on 2/8/21  Pours a crystal-clear, deep copper body, glistening and steadily effervescent, capped with multiple fingers of thick, fluffy, off-white foam; great head retention yields a half-finger of creamy cap, a broad, soapy collar, and many thin layers of chunky, webby lacing coating the walls of the glass.  Aroma starts off with a wave of honeyed malt sweetness, quickly establishing a foundation for ruby red grapefruit and pine laced with a dense array of sweaty, dank hop resins evolving over the middle with a distant tinge of bread crust interspersed throughout; peach and apricot flesh accent the back end of the bouquet as intermittent, sweet pineapple and dank mango continue driving a fading citrus tone through the close.  Taste first approaches with a suave honeyed malt balanced with the deft citric undertones of grapefruit rind upfront; building resin soon takes over, with grassy tones sporting a rawer, herbal touch over the mid-palate peaking with dirt, earth, and flaky malts into the back end, where citrus peel underscores and a light mango/apricot compote presents on the finish.  Mouthfeel brings a medium body and a fluffy, moderate carbonation; slick, bright, and paradoxically boggy with notions of a sticky weight which never quite materialize over the mid-palate, the back end highlights a prickly bitterness as a taut malt texture allows for a consistent, moderately dry finish.  In a similar vein to regional stalwarts like Sip of Sunshine, this brew sits in a perpetual flow state of sweaty hop resins and vivid yet simple malt expressions; a distinct focus on the core of natural hop characteristics gives this a perpetual appeal.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Ive read reviews where someone tried the beer several times, while stating they never cared for the style, just to bash it in a review  Again this is not a review of the beer, but a review of the common demeanor of this site.

694,15881,1009,4.13,I was as happy as a honey bee drinking this nectar. This beer displayed a gorgeous amber color with a foamy head that is mouth watering. It has a piney and citrus smell to it that converts to a flavorful beer that is malty and sweet. I could not believe the amount of flavor packed into this brew.

694,15881,Ernald_Elbertson,4.52,"This is potentially my favorite beer. Even though it isn't as complex or decadent as some beers, it is drinkable, full of flavor, and at what I consider to be the perfect ABV.  Look: Typical amber style in terms of color and clarity, but with a small ever-present head that gives it a sense of smoothness you don't always get from other hoppy beers.  Smell: Immediately extremely fruity, like a freshly peeled citrus. Hops and malt combine with bitter and sweet to provide this experience. Slightly dank and herbaceous, rounding out the smell with a full and complex undertone.  Taste: Malt and hops combine together on the first sip, giving the signature fruity bitterness. Hop bitterness is very high at 93 IBU, and lasts for quite a while in the mouth. Each subsequent sip refreshes you and starts the process over again; this beer can be enjoyed in sips over a long period of time, or finished off quickly if you desire. You'll both want to go back for the next sip, but also linger on the last one. As for the particular fruit taste here, it could really be a few. I get mango, grapefruit, but also some orange and possibly even some notes of dried fruit. The head gives every sip a creamy flavor as well. Almost like if you were to have an orange creamsicle with real fruit flavors as opposed to artificial orange flavor. Dank in the flavor as well, adds a lot of complexity here.  Feel: Creamy, but not overly heavy. Perfect feel for this style of beer, and works with the fruit flavors very well.  Overall: This beer is fantastic, provided you enjoy hoppy beers. It can serve different drinking purposes (despite being labeled an Imperial, you can drink a few at a time), and will be sure to satisfy. Personally I might bump the ABV up just a notch to 8-8.5%, but other than that, this beer is nearly flawless. Next time you want a Double IPA, try this instead. It provides a similar experience, but with a more gentle and smooth malt than the typical intense malts of DIPAs. I can guarantee this will be in my beer rotation for as long as they keep making it, and it certainly deserves its reputation as the best of the best Ambers.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

694,15881,BillBarnshaw,4.71,This is another great 1x a year beer from Troegs. Comes out around February in our local Market (New Jersey). Great color and balance. Not as good as Giant Nimble in my opinion but well balanced and great taste none the less. Color is slightly red / orange. Lots of citrus and pine flavor.,Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

694,15881,deleted_user_995920,4.09,"Pours a translucent light caramel color with a decent creamy/foamy head. Smell hops, almost a sweet bun smell, very muted. Taste an explosion of hops,citrus,toffee,stone fruit. Feels medium bodied and finishes juicy. Overall a very good beer, I never had an imperial red before-",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,PathofChaos,3.73,"Appearance: Pours a bright, translucent, orange marmalade color. Clear as a clean window in a gated community. Its head has a white tinged-with-orange hue that boasts respectable retention and heavy, webbed lacing.  Bouquet: The presence of tropical fruit, citrus hops, and sugary syrup are all quiet as mice in a cat kennel. I really had to breathe deep to detect anything at all.  Taste: Bold, shameless hops cut to the front of the line, jumping up and down for attention, shoving the semi-sweet honey, caramels, red malts, and floral spices sprawling to the ground on its oafish way there. The flavors injured by this carelessness still come limping along, but weaker for their sufferance. At times, there's even a hint of something that wants to call itself mango creamsicle, but those citrus hops relentlessly rave and whoop across the palate with bombastic abandon, while the more exotic flavors are subdued into stunned whispers.  Feel: A medium body that's smooth and finishes with a warm, bitter bite. Refreshing, almost crisp, and most inoffensive!  Overall: A daydream of captivating flavors that never quite becomes reality. Nugget Nectar is nice, yeah... but not a World-Class 96 out of 100. That puts it in league with real flavor titans like Stone's Xocoveza, Terrapin's Wake-n-Bake Oatmeal Coffee Imperial Stout, and Founders KBS Stout, which it certainly is not.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

694,15881,SierraNevallagash,4.21,"Big thanks to Ryan for hooking me up with this one!  Pint can - freshest by 05/15/20 - poured into an IPA pint at 46°F.  Pours a delightfully brilliant reddish-amber, with excellent clarity. Nearly two fingers of bone white head form, before receding to a half-finger of sheet that persists throughout. Absolutely mesmerising effervescence that begins nucleating at the base with micro bubbles, before growing and absolutely swarming upwards, keeping that sheet of foam alive. Some heavy sheet lacing is formed.  Nose: That unique red ale malt base sets the tone - not nearly as sweet and honey-like as caramel malt, and also restrained enough to let the hops take the spotlight. Some warm, toasty notes, with a touch of caramel and fresh baked bread, and then a ton of hop notes. The hops are very bizarre. There's a real English floral and spiciness to it that you almost never encounter in an American hoppy ale. There are some very forward pine and citrus notes, but then this bombardment of dank and earthy impressions hit. I definitely get some Simcoe mustiness and touch of black peppercorn, but the rest is just this very unique bouquet of dank, earthy, spicy, and floral notes. .  Palate: The beer greets the palate with a malty sweetness first and foremost. Somewhat akin to typical crystal malt, there is a moderate sweetness, but it lacks the darker, toasty caramel flavour. The sweetness is actually somewhat restrained. The hops comenin quick, with a whole mosaic (not the hop) of earthy, spicy, and dank notes, with a little hint if bright fruity citrus. A firm boiled hop bitterness - pithy and resibous in nature, comes into focus fairly early on, but is kept beneath everything else by the malt. These are unusual hops to me, and therefore I cannot say what it typical of them, or even identify what flavours are from what, but I can absolutely spot some musty, earthy Simcoe in the mix, from a mile away. It tastes like they added Simcoe in boil, but also used it in the dry hop as well. European hop spice, grapefruit, tangerine, black pepper, Douglas fir sap, fresh herbs, a bit of grass, and all these earthy notes, with that punch of musty Simcoe. The finish dries out much of the malt, and sees an increase in bitterness, which becomes purely resinous, with all the spicy notes from before, some dry potpourri florals, dried orange zest, and a ton of sappy, resinous hop oils, which lends a bit of pine. Bitterness does not linger, and the finish ultimately concludes clean and crisp.  Mouthfeel/Body: The beer is squarely medium-bodied. The malt lends some sweetness, some heft, and just a hint of stickiness, but I've had regular old West Coast IPAs that are way sweeter and stickier than this. It is quite crisp and drinkable, and the malt never feels chewy, heavy or sticky. Effervescence is fairly average, or maybe just a bit below average, but for all intents and purposes, it's perfectly adequate, and helps move the beer along. Some resinous hop oils cling to the palate, and while not entirely dry, the finish definitely has some hoppy drying qualities.  Overall: I have to give this beer credit for being unique and a bit against the grain. I've had some red ales before, and while some hit the mark, others just come across as IPAs - often overly bitter and sappy IPAs. This was has a character that is entirely it's own. The malt is absolutely perfect, and really sets the feel for a red ale, the hops themselves are just ridiculously unique and unusual, and the hopping is done to perfection, with the perfect balance of bitterness, flavour, and aromatics. This is a very fine imperial red ale - a bit unusual, yes, and perhaps not what many are used to, but it's a job well done, and a finely crafted ale.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Smell is quite interesting. There's a bit of hoppy floral/fruitiness but also a noticeable sweet smell. Taste is resiny and piney but not to the point where it's off-putting or a palate wrecker. Mouthfeel: Given the abv and the hoppiness of this beer, it might be one of the smoothest I've ever had even with a noticeable stickiness. Dangerously drinkable...Overall, a great beer.

Some dank pine notes, syrupy sweet notes. Honey, caramel.  The taste comes in with some malt presence. It’s a really nice and clean malt background to a pine hop presence. Really nice sweetness in there with the honey and caramel notes. Slight crystal malt being used, but not overdone.  Mouthfeel isn’t cloyingly syrupy, and really well balanced while remaining wet and sticky.  Overall, I could see how this is a winner for people.

694,15881,Lone_Freighter,3.9,"I have had this more than enough times in life. And finally, I'm getting around to record my thoughts here. This time, in a clean nonic pint glass. The appearance was an amber glossy semi-transparent color with an eggshell slim yet semi-rocky white foamy head. Spotty lace spreading out evenly. The aroma takes the sweet biscuity malts to a sweet honey toned grassy hoppiness. Light toffee/caramel smooth character strolls through a super light piney bitterness. The flavor took all of those prior mentioned aromas to bring them together sweetly with a sturdy bitterness but not as cohesive as I thought it could be. So, I can't really say ""bittersweet"" for this beer. Definitely has a long biscuity to caramel/toffee coated honey to piney aftertaste. The mouthfeel was about medium bodied, perhaps just a touch under. Good carbonation and ABV. Semi-smooth honey finish with a touch of crisp grassiness and malt. Overall, a very nice imperial red ale, well worthy of coming back to.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

T-Nice sweetness that is also resinous and compliments the bitterness that sets in and glides into the aftertaste O-I was not expecting so much malt character that I always find takes away from any potential hop profiles, but the summary on the can fits what was in the can...hopped amber ale.

694,15881,VoxRationis,4.5,"Decanted from a 12 oz (355 ml) bottle into a custom tasting pint; no obvious production information.

S: Spicy with strong caramel, molasses, and honey aromas. Lemon and pine elements. More cocoa as it warms. T: Sweet to semisweet with a caramel and white pepper predominating over other elements of the nose. Peppery bitterness lingers pleasantly. M: Light to medium bodied with fairly light carbonation. Drinks smooth and citrusy. O: My first American Imperial Red Ale. Straightforward, but quite complex. I'm a bit shocked by the ABV (7.5%) and IBU (93 or so), but that they can take one by surprise as part of the artfulness of this brew's composition.

It finishes with a rounded stab of pine/grapefruit bitterness , on the anterior quarter of the tongue, that lingers for a minute or so.

694,15881,MoMaMe,3.78,"A little dissapointed after getting this due to the high ratings.  Color is a medium to dark amber - very clear. Medium head that dissapates quickly.  What struck me was an overwhelming malty, caramel,burnt sugar, sweetness, yet not a lot of flavor. For me, this was too sweet, and it lacked the citrusy and piney notes that are typical for an IPA.  Not a bad beer by any means, and it's worth a try as it's different and the sweetness is distinctive, but I probably won't ever get this one again.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

This beer just shines when consumed. Not too dry, nice malt backbone to support heavy dose of hops. I love how the ubiquitous but unloved Nugget hop is front and center.  Slightly cloying MF.  Overall: just a nice rounded out amber ale. This has been a solid hoppy seasonal for years and continues to impress.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

S: Pine like hops are the first thing I smell. Also getting some spicey malt notes too but only to a lesser extent.  T: Beer blends the hops and malt well. The hops seem a bit more obvious than the malt, but both areas are present and nicely blended.  M: Very easy drinker. Soft mouthfeel. The malt gives a slight spicy feel but is well done.  O: If this beer was easier to get in Oklahoma I would drink it in bunches. Malt and hops mix well to make a well balanced beer.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,djkman,4.54,"2018 - review . 4 years drinking this brew. Times have changed. Reading my review from 2015....... “oh my”. But here is the 2018 version:  A-ppearance - clear copper filtered color still there. S-mell - hop is there but malt more present this time, For 2018. F-eel: STILL PRIVATE ! Mouthfeel was not private way back in 2015, for me, but now, It’s a “Thing”......... T-aste: Still a “Home Run” Drinkable a 7.5 and 93ish IBU’s(I LIKE that LOL!) The 7.5 is the “Drink a few and then the alcohol hit is you” thing. O-verall: Been purchasing it since 2015.. Got Cans this year (and cans last year too!) Always good In My Humble Opinion. Craft beer Enthusiast’s: Enjoy.  2017 -didn’t write a review. Didn’t have to, it still a great brew! Yes I got cans on this year.  2016 got another case. great beer. Thoroughly enjoying it again this year.  Happy 2015 .. This time I bought a case. IMHO it is still great! Isn't buying a whole case make that pretty obvious ? I do enjoy this beer.  A - nice clear copper color. ( if it was an unfiltered copper color I would be totally ok with that also)  S - definite hop aroma. ( i am not a -hop head- as in hop to the tenth power) so i appreciate the malt that is brought into the recipe. I poured the bottle into my Guinness glass.  T - taste IMHOpinion - home run... WOW right up there with dog fish head 90min IPA in my humble opinion. the hoppy taste is there , don't get me wrong, but I like how the malt gives it a great taste.  M - good body. not like arrogant bastard ( which is awesome also, the kind of beer that punches U in the face with flavor, - thats a good thing) this does not punch U in the face with flavor.. IT has it.. don't get me wrong but it has good drinkability! I can see drinking a few of these in a row no problem and then finding me under the table with my wife asking -- R U ok? and I would say something like --- ummm yeah... i'm happy.... how U doing ?... and she would say something else that I probably won't remember... maybe it has something to do with it being 7.5?  O - Overall - Ummmm overall... HMMMmmmm how about .. must get another 6 pack?!?!! these guys a Troegs.. keep up the good work... dammit!!  must be the chocolate aroma floating around Hershey!  BYway - i still have 1 bottle left of the mad elf i'm holding in the fridge for myself.  ALSO of all places to find this beer.... A&P in Bergen county. go figure.

So, no tasting for me. I did finally pick up a 6 pack of bottles earlier this week (I don't know the best by date, though) and tried one last night. Although I have nothing to compare it to, I thought it was a well-made beer. Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass, it had a mild hop aroma and a 1 finger head. The taste had a mellow, but not overbearing, hop flavor with a sweetness on the back end (not a distinct mango flavor, just a sweet flavor). Overall, I thought it was good and would purchase again.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Frothy head that stayed til the last sip. Lacing everywhere. Smell: fresh and juicy. Not as off-putting as an IPA can sometimes be. Fruity like fresh mango and pineapple. Taste: very hoppy, yes. But not as extreme or unpleasant as I expected. A fruity hop burst that twisted to a sweet, bready, caramelized malt finish. An excellent balance of malts and pine. Mouthfeel: substantial body. A little sticky. Smooth. What a great hoppy amber ale.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Leaves a minimal amount of lacing.  The aroma brings notes of caramel and bready malts, followed by a wave of piney hops and citrus.  The flavor is the perfect balance of sweet malts and bitter, piney hops. There are notes of caramel and toffee, finished off by pine and grapefruit, with a touch of orange rind.  The feel is medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation. Slightly sticky, yet incredibly smooth. Has a beautiful lingering bitterness that coats the mouth in piney hops resins.  Overall, a truly great Amber ale that definitely lives up to the hype. It's very hoppy, but it's also very balanced. I would drink this all year long if I could.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Gave it a try after years of not having and was really impressed. Remember it being good but this time taking one from an ice cold cooler at a pregame tailgate it was just perfect. Says 96 IBU but does not feel overly bitter hopped. I ran out to get more thinking this beer was readily available and the liquor store was down to last case. So I took it.,Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Malt is well present and the hops are certainly West coast style with some resin, but doesn't pop like you'd expect from a highly ranked beer. Taste is fuller, with lots of pine and resin along with the amber malts and some stone fruits.

694,15881,digboy,4.36,"12 Oz can gifted by a friend - canned 3/27/17  Pours a clear deep reddish amber color with plenty of carbonation and a 3 finger fluffy head  Aroma is vaguely tropical with some cracker notes. This intensifies as the beer warms up and a very strong alcohol aroma grows with temperature as well.  Taste is sweet malt up front but fading into a more citrusy, resinous, bit of candy taste at the end - sort of like a wekly flavored lemon hard candy. Bitterness is present but does not overwhelm, inter-playing well with the malt. Once warmed up there is a strong alcohol burn but the flavor of the beer still wins over the battle.  Feel is a little sticky and heavy at first like an amber should be but it settles out to a very fresh and bright feel at the end. Very unusual and probably one of the reasons this beer rates so well.  I was pleased to finally be able to try this famous classic. It does not disappoint its reputation. A real treat.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Smell is of slightly bitter hops, a little pine, and some warm alcohol. The taste is fairly well balanced by malts considering the 93 ibus. I get more hoppy pine notes around the edges as this one finishes. Oddly enough, I did not taste much of the citrus notes that others have mentioned. Either way, this is one of my favorite offerings by Troegs, I will be getting this on an annual basis!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

I immedatly got the classic hop smell with a slight pine. The taste is malty up front but then quickly follows through with citrus/ pine.

694,15881,Holderness,4.28,"Lovely golden amber with a two finger cream colored head produced by an aerated pour out of the can. Aromas are balanced between a caramel malty sweetness and a floral and resinous hop character -- reminiscent of Dogfish Head's 90 Minute IPA. Taste largely follows the nose: it's not hard to tell this is an amber ale given the sweet caramel malt flavors, but it is backed up by a flavorful bouquet of fruity and floral hops that pushes this brew close to DIPA territory. Not much earthy, herbal, or resinous hops that I can taste, despite what is said on the packaging. Great mouthfeel, balance of flavors, and semi-dry finish. Well worth (at least) one sixer when available!  86/100",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

The nose is surprisingly devoid of too much hop aroma. The taste is similarly not as hoppy as one is made to expect and most of the bitterness arrives late.

694,15881,fyrespritetryst,4.56,"Being that this is my favorite beer in the world, I was honestly a little disappointed this year. One of the best things about nugget nectar is the simplicity of its hop profile. Citrus introduction with a piney resinoid mid to a metallic finish has always been how I've known the beer...the epitome of an imperial red ale. It reminded me of a Six Point Sweet Action with a thicker mouthfeel and a bit of chew. Now I'm seeing imperial amber everywhere on the labels and what used to just be warrior and nugget hops has turned into warrior, nugget, tomahawk, simcoe and palisade hops. It muddies the transition of a cult classic and I wish Troegs didn't mess with a good thing. Regardless, it's still delicious, but it blends in with a lot of other IPA's now...",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Oopssorryy,4.33,"Pours an interesting light amber, with orange highlights. Has a massive off white head, but has little lacing. Head sticks around for a long time. The smell is sweet citrus, grapefruit and orange, along with bitter floral and grassy qualities. Bitter and floral in the mouth, with large flavors of pine. The finish starts off with a ting of sweet caramel, then shows a massive swell of pine, hints of resin, and again, floral. The whole experience is very bitter, with only a brief hint of sweetness to try to balance it all out. The beer is incredibly light, easy in carbonation, and very drinkable. It's dry, as the bitter profile would suggest, but isn't overly so. Overall a great beer, and a nice break from the IPAs while still offering many of the same qualities they'd give you.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Hops are piney and a little Earthy; lotta honey, malty sweetness for balance. Soft, creamy, delicate mouthfeel. (Borat Voice) Wow-a-whoo! Really pleasant beer that drinks smaller than 7.5% ABV.

Lots of carbonation, full 1"" off white head on a red/amber ale appearance. Aroma had all that red malt and plenty of the bitter nugget hop. Is this only nugget hops? They aren't the most aromatic hop to use.  Its plenty malty, plenty bitter. Its a bigger beer than i thought at the outset. The citrus is grapefruit, there is some woodiness but not pine like.

Poured from the bottle into a pint glass, this beer's head is three fingers thick, with secular lacing, and a clear reddish amber body.  Smells like a not-to-the-point-of-astringency blend of hops resembling tangerine, melons dare I say, and a piney ""zing"" at the end of the whiff.  I taste a clean, mild malt foundation with the hops I was talking about in the smell as more of an accentuation instead the main attraction. Which is not to say that their flavor in underwhelming. It just doesn't give you that slap across the mouth. The mango mentioned on the labeling adds a nice overall refreshing element to the flavor profile.  The mouthfeel I'm picking up is medium-light with fair carbonation.  Overall, I'll give Tröegs Nugget Nectar | Tröegs Brewing Company a 4.5. A very easy-going imperial ale that isn't an IPA.

AROMA: the nugget releases strong floral, resinous aura while the tomahawk releases a bitter, orange peel/pineapple...

694,15881,Raidersox,4.58,"Poured from 12 ounce bottle (fridge temp approx. 38 degrees) to goblet-style stemmed glass. Bottle legend says best by 5/14/16, unsure of bottled on date.  Look: Pours a copper/orange color with a thick, creamy, slightly off-white 3/4 inch head that dissipated fairly quickly but left behind a nice lasting lace with moderate carbonation.  Smell: Pine and resins dominate with fruity citrus in the background. Nice overall hoppy aroma hints at what is to come.  Taste: Hoppy pine flavor hits hard and fast, fading to citrus and a faint metallic (but not unpleasant) aftertaste. Caramel malt flavor comes along for the ride and helps balance the bitterness. Favors intensified as the glass warmed.  Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied and crisp from first sip to last. Almost a creaminess I attribute to the continual carbonation and lacing that lasts to the end.  Overall: It is almost like a red/amber ale trying to pass itself off as an APA, but in a very good way. This is my first opportunity to try Nugget Nectar and I was drawn to the hype as well as the Troegs brand. I've always liked red ales, my first love in craft beers, but now my go-to beer is an IPA. This brew satisfies both ends of that particular spectrum. Very drinkable despite the 7.5 ABV, I could see myself putting away a sixer over the course of an evening but would be equally satisfied having one or two before dinner. I gotta shop the other distributors in the area to see if they have any left and stock up.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

The head takes a minute or two to dissipate.  Aroma: Orange, fruits, grapefruit, some mango.  Taste: Hops, pine, fruit, orange with a pleasant hoppy bitterness.  Mouthfeel: A pleasant hoppy bitterness.  Overall: An excellent beer which should be regularly consumed. Not sure why the company creates so much hype surrounding the annual release of this beer.

Aromas are piney, resinous, dank, rind, caramel, rye, biscuits. Taste is light bitterness, lots of pine and resinous hop oils, citrus rind, followed by a light bitterness on the tongue.

Taste: The beer opens with a bit of a spicy taste much like you would get from a gingerbread cookie but not quite ginger. It follows with a bit of sweetness with quite a bit of alcohol flavor. A touch of pith and this yeasty bready aftertaste. If I had to describe this beer in two words it would be bready and alcoholic.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a good amount of bitterness without being overwhelming. Good carbonation and a bit wet on the palate.  Overall: It's a good beer.

Smell is unpleasant. Medicinal with some faint pine and citrus flavors. Taste is also unpleasant. Again, medicinal is the best way of describing it. The first couple sips were like biting into an aspirin, super bitter and metallic in taste (poured from a bottle, btw). About 1/4 through the glass (maybe after my taste buds adjusted) I finally started getting some piney, resinous hop flavor under all that sheer bitterness. It wasn't until about halfway through my glass (maybe after my taste buds were completely annihilated) that I finally started to get some faint hints of caramely malty sweetness. Feel is medium, somewhat creamy, and very dry on the finish. Amber ales are generally one of my favorite styles, but besides the color, I don't really see how this fits the style at all. I found it very unbalanced, very bitter, and lacking in a lot of the toasted biscuit flavors I like so much in this style.

There is a bit of hoppiness, but I struggle to describe the other flavors. Medicinal still comes to mind. I'm not sure what they're really going for taste-wise.  I bought this newly released, only a couple weeks old at most. People said last year's release wasn't the best, so I was hoping for this to impress me. Wow, was I completely suckered into this by the marketing and hype surrounding the release (store I bought it from had a full end aisle display). I'd say this was even worse than I had last year, and I'm still not sure of the taste they are going for.

The palate leads with bitter citrus and pine, with a slight IPA soapiness; midpalate the spicy, candy-like florals emerge, as does a nice weedy character, and the soapiness retreats. The bitterness builds to a point a bit north of middling for an IPA, allowing some of the bready malt foundation to show. The finish is pretty clean, showing just a bit of bittersweet nuttiness; the linger is a moderate grass/pine bitterness that sticks around for a few minutes. Retrogustative olfaction is weedy/grassy.

Aftertaste clean with whispers of sweet malt and hop flavors just barely remaining. Mouthfeel: medium body. Medium carbonation. Very slight alcohol warmth. No creaminess or astringency. Overall: very enjoyable hop forward Amber/ IPA. Glad the finish is dry and Carmel malts are subdued, thus reducing sweetness. Hop flavors, while at higher levels are nuanced and enjoyable.

Taste is subjective, so I don't feel like anyone has to agree with this.  Cheers everyone!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

694,15881,ctylinebeer,3.52,"12 oz. bottle poured into a Nugget Nectar pint glass. From a 12-pack, which are now legal in Pennsylvania smh....  Das Review:  L - Bright and rich amber color; crystal clear hue. Nice and carbonated with a two finger head. Layer of foam on top; loose lacing on the side. Alcohol gripping to the glass pretty well.  S - Difficult from a tumbler, Syrupy caramel malts with citrus notes coming through. Notes: maple, caramel, grapefruit, pine. Interesting aroma.  T - Hop dominated. Very distinctive Nugget hop character that encompasses the whole experience. No amber or red character to it. Citrus tasting and quite bitter.  F - Light viscosity; Clean and crisp with medium strong alcohol burn. Strong nugget hop after taste that coats the tongue. Pretty rough stuff.  O - Fresh nugget hops are pretty bomb if you ask me. I love IPAs and even though this is a Red Ale, this certainly feels like a pine IPA. Nugget hops I feel give the best of both worlds between the tropical juiciness and the pine bitterness, and Nugget Nectar is a good example of that. Only comes around late January, so I am going to try and get this while I can. Cheers!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

694,15881,Hayward,4.23,"After years of tasting and appreciating various West Coast IPAs, I've grown to appreciate beers with an eye towards hops, but with attention and variation in their malt characters. Whereas the traditional West Coast IPAs seem as an expression of hops over a blank malt, Red IPAs or Amber IPAs such as Nugget Nectar offer some complexity and contrast between the body and aroma of the beer.  Tröegs Nugget Nectar, I believe, does this very well. The nose hints at mostly sweet honey amber malt, but it is sweet, malty and bitter (slightly floral) in taste.  As with Hopback Amber, it is a delicious beer with desire for a quick follow-up.  Only thing wanting somehow in this beer is a slightly more aggressive carbonation. It tends to feel mild on this level. If it had a little bit more of a bite it would be absolutely stellar, although once you're halfway through the pint as it is, you already want another.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

694,15881,Fear4Beer,4.42,I'm not a big fan of very bitter beers and I'm just pleasantly confused about this beer. This beer has 93 IBU which would make you think this beer will turn your face inside out with bitterness but for whatever reason (perhaps it being a red ale?) the malts counter the bitterness to the point where this beer is actually enjoyable without giving you a bitter beer face. It has the aspects of an IPA (the hop taste and grapefruit note) but the malts really make this beer great. The pine notes are usually the ones that are the most unpleasant to me in IPAs and the pine taste is very subtle in this beer. I'm not sure if my palette is changing though. 93 IBU normally means I'm not going to like the beer. This beer has proven that theory wrong. Although I'm drinking this beer 2-3 months after I bought it. I'm not sure if it aged the beer at all. Hopefully I can try a fresh beer in the future and remember how this tasted.,Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

They play very well and it's evident that this beer has been fine tuned to let both shine. A very well crafted brew that is fun to find but not a pain the in ass to get. Will definitely be on the search for it next year and should not be looked over.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,JPowell712,4.49,"This was a fantastic beer. It had a lot of hype behind it and it certainly lived up to it. The pour was a deep amber color with a white creamy head to it. The aromas was of soft hops and citrus and pine. The taste was almost identical. It was a beautiful combo of hops, citrus, pine and something sweet like honey. It worked beautifully. I like this beer because it was refreshing and tasted of liquid happiness!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Perfectly clear, bright copper-orange liquid with a finger of orange tinged white head that settles to a thin layer of foam that stays around but doesn’t lay down any lacing.

Smells very nice when you really get a good whiff, but that's about it. Can't say how disappointed I was with this one. The first few sips left a sort of... gas-like, almost sulfur like after taste. Had to really force it down. I've had water problems before at my house, and our water tank had to be cleaned with chlorine to get the gasious sulfur like smell out of our water. The after taste of this beer reminded me of that smell. Terrible. I'm sure it is possible I simply got a bad batch but it really wasn't very good.

Well balanced between sweet malt and rambunctious hops.  T: Deliciously sweet malt, soft brown sugar, thick breadiness. Hops load up in the background, creating a nice reversal of profiles from DIPAs. Smooth pine resin with a acidic bite.  M: Great balance, even better than expected. Medium body, tad oily, soft mouthfeel, smooth finish...albeit a sweet one. Leaves a malty sugar coating with the faintest of hop bitterness.  O: Really damn good.

694,15881,aleigator,4.39,"Many thanks to Ron for the can!   Has a huge, froth white head, with a crystal clear dark orange color.   The aromas release an interesting interaction between ripe blood orange and fresh cut grass with a noteable dank aspect. The intense hoppy aromas get a sweet touch to them by a bready, slightly biscuity malty arise, intensifying the fruit appearance by a adding a gentle ripeness to them. Citrus zest blending well into the dankness evokes a subtle, sour peak.  Drinks very smooth, with soft, dough malts up front, accompanied by citraic, bitter hops. While the malts remain in a supportive role, they develop a decent sweetness adding to juicy orange and tangerine. Grass and zingy lemon get introduced to the tastebuds by a lively carbonation, completing the sublime, surprisingly bitter hop character. Finishes with toffeeish malts, which get overpowered by a bitter, tropical hop onslaught in which pricky lime stands out among grass, pine and blood orange, leading to a long lasting bitterness.

Floral and earthy. It feels slightly crisp, smooth and medium bodied. There is a lot of malty sweetness on the tongue that matches the smell. Yet, there is a strong medium bitter hops presence that takes over. It tastes like grapefruit pith and pine. The finish alternates between sweetness and hoppy bitterness that lingers.

It has a very bitey bitter start, and finishes with a refreshing sweetness.  Feel: Medium feel, carbonation is mild. Thr hops give it a dry feel:  Overall: I HATED this beer when I first tried it years ago. I also had a slightly dislike for most hoppy IPA's. (I know this isn't an IPA).

T - Follows the nose, but with caramel and pine being more prevalent. Bread. Faint orange.  M - The mouthfeel is clean, if slightly dense from the hops, and the carbonation is in the medium range.

Since then, I make sure to get at least a few bottles every spring. I have made the mistake of trying to drink one bottle a month or so- don't do that, this is one that needs to be fresh, otherwise you loose much of the flavor of the hops. I just really like the hops on this one. I have noticed that it's a little different every year, and some years have been better than others. But either way it's still one of my favorites.

It's somewhat rocky, and it's got bubbles in it. Body is a clear, darker, copper, color. You can see through the glass. Looks like nice, champagne, style bubbles rising. Not a whole lot, but looks nice. It's more effervescent than a lot of IPA's I've seen. Lacing is looking nice!  S- Right away it makes you think of a double IPA, even if it's considered an American Amber Ale. Lots of pine, leathery, and tobacco notes. It has resinous, hop notes. Topical fruits, like peaches, mangoes, and grapefruit. Little bit of a a caramel malty-ness as the backbone of the beer. Smells like a pretty well made IPA in the nose.  T- Tastes amazingly good! It's a big, juicy, quality to the beer. The piney, resinous, notes do come out. There is a bit of a earthy, grassy-ness to the hops as well. There is some hop oil flavor and dankness going on. The malts have a sweeter type quality. It's a light biscuity note in the background. For 93ish IBUs (as Troegs says), the bitterness doesn't stick around all that long. And that is nice! The finish is very clean and drying.  M- The body is medium. It does taste crisp, finishes clean, and is surprisingly very refreshing and drinkable.  Overall, this is a phenomenally made Double IPA kind of a beer. It's gonna get a 93-95/100 from me, which is a A+ grade!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Appearance: Dark amber lots of soft white foamy head on top which remains.  Aroma: Some soft tropical notes, not as much hops as you would think, but then again this is an amber IPA rather than the traditional so there are more malts. There is definitely some caramel and sweet malt notes on the nose.  Taste: Very well balanced. Tropical fruits, mango, papaya and some earthy hop notes, Clean taste, not too sweet considering the malt character but there is enough hops to balance it out and make it a very balanced and enjoyable beer.

Not overly malty, but does detract from the bite that would probably be there otherwise.  Overall- while I applaud the balance, I'm not a huge fan of balance, I prefer the scales to be tipped well in the favor of citrusy hops. None the less, an excellent beer.

694,15881,DA84,4.31,"Smells so good... IMHO the best aroma of any amber I've had. The taste was solid but did not live up to the look and smell. Almost too balanced, as I didn't really notice the malt character come through and while the bittering hop comes through strong, there wasn't much depth. It's a very clean very well done beer. I probably would give it higher marks if the outstanding aroma didn't set such a high expectation of flavor for me. It's a great beer. Definitely worth a try.

694,15881,Roguer,4.16,"Beautiful perfectly clear copper ale, topped with a very large and firm off-white (almost beige) head. Head retention is perfect, and it leaves tons of lacing around the glass as it slowly dies - and with each sip.  Sweet hop-forward aroma from the moment you start the pour. Pine is the dominant hop aroma, although there's a bit of citrus and floral mixed in. Caramel malts and sweet brown sugar provide a lovely backbone.  Brew tastes less sweet than it smells; it's fairly subdued and balanced. Caramel and brown sugar dance with big pine and smooth resin notes, with an acidic, citric bite.  Very lively brew, with a bit too much sting, but otherwise very drinkable. Excellent balance, medium-light bodied with a long, cloying hop oil finish.  This is not an IPA; it is an outstanding, hoppy amber ale. The malt balance is clearly as important as the hop profile, and both combine for a fantastic product.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

I certainly admired the fiery orange-red color and the floral aroma, but the taste just seemed rather ho-hum to me. I can't quite put my finger on what I didn't like about it (hence the relatively good marks I gave it), but there was just something off in the overall balance. I would try it again, though.

Rich nose of tropical fruit (mango, pineapple), grapefruit and a subtle orange over a balanced biscuit and caramel sweetness coupled with a very subtle spiciness underneath.  Light medium body with a nice smooth texture that also has an oily character. Slightly above normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence in the middle and a nice burst in the finish.  The flavor profile is World Class. It has intense hop flavor while being mild in bitterness, complex and expertly balanced. It begins with a burst of tropical and grapefruit hop flavor that somewhat separates into the aroma flavors. As these fade in the middle, a subtle caramel sweetness emerges that is quickly surpassed by a mild grapefruit rind bitterness. As the bitterness subsides, a spicy character emerges over a light sweetness that is biscuit in character. The finish is a slow fade of grapefruit rind, with a touch of tropical, over a biscuit/caramel sweetness. The 7.5% alcohol is almost totally covered, appearing only in the lingering finish and a slight burn at the back of the throat.

694,15881,dd43,4.36,"There are beers out there with a pretty high IBU number that leave you thinking ""well that really wasn't as bitter as I would have expected"". This is not one of those beers.  Its called an imperial amber by Troegs, a category they virtually own to themselves. Drink this and tell me it isn't straddling the border between IPA and IIPA.  Pours a beautifully deep copper color, like a weathered penny. Crystal clear, with abundant foamy off white head. Well carbonated.  The nose of this beer makes its bitter grapefruit and orange pith/rind presence felt immediately. Balanced with this is a really nice sweet malt note, with an almost honey like quality. Challah comes to mind.  Flavors are again citrus heavy with an assertive bitter hop punch. The malt bill lends a juicy, tacky quality to the mouthfeel that is exceptionally reminiscent of an imperial IPA, clinging to your tongue like a warm blanket. The back end is bitter without being overly astringent. Quaffable to the point that one could get into trouble with this beer, especially in the new 16 oz can format.

Caramel malts kick in to balance things out and it finished clean and balanced with hops lingering. Every sip demands another sip. Much like the smell I think this bottle is a little danker than the draft that I had earlier. It is 4 days old after all.  Overall this years Nugget Nectar seems to be tasting awesome. I can't get enough of it at the moment and just cracked another bottle. The 16oz cans are going to be a force to be reckoned with next week!

The palate is moderate on the malts with a strong hop presence - mostly in the form of pineapple and resin. Minor grassy/grainy notes. Not overwhelmingly crisp, but smooth. High carbonation with a medium body.  I'm typically over amber ales but this is not your typical amber. Very comparable to a DIPA. The nose has a lot in common with SUCKS. This is highly recommended.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Sweet caramel and citrusy notes meet with piney and peppery notes. It smells great, but the aroma is subtle you really need to work at pulling the attributes out.  T - Bready malts and caramel undertones meld amazingly to a big hop bite mid palate. The hop bite brings with it citrus and spicy notes that finishes with a wave of pine and a crisp, dry finish with lingering bitterness.  M - Medium body with active carbonation and slightly coating. Finishes slightly dry with a nice tingle on the palate.  O - Seriously one of my all time favorite beers. Hoppy, well balanced and a touch of sweetness. I love this take on the style.

694,15881,porter_collie,4.19,"Poured from 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass  A - True to the style, the beer pours a warm amber color. There is no haze whatsoever so you can watch as the carbonation bubbles weave their way to the top of the glass to form a moderate off-white head.  S - Dank, with a distinct pine resin aroma. Some grapefruit and sugar cookie odors sneak in there, too.  T - Similar to the nose, gloriously piney and dank. Grapefruit plays a complementing second fiddle. The malt character is perfect to the style - biscuit and a hint of caramel. The finish is pleasantly bitter and well-balanced by clean malty sweetness.  M - Good but nothing special. The carbonation is robust but not overpowering. Given the ABV, the body manages to not be overtly heavy or syrupy.  O - This is a very good beer. It's hard to think of another amber ale that is superior. It is a dank beer, but does not have the herbal or onion flavors other such brews have. This beer comes with a lot of hype, which it mostly lives up to. Nice to see nugget hops get some love, though!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,MaddestHatter,3.44,"I'll start by saying that I'm not really an IPA guy. Perhaps this is a controversial opinion, but I think that putting too many hops in a beer can totally ruin it by taking over all other flavors. That being said, I quite enjoy Nugget Nectar. When I first had it, the bitterness really struck me as I was not expecting this many hops in an amber or red ale. The rest of that bottle was nearly undrinkable but by the end of the second (which I drank along with food for what that's worth) I was very eager to go out and buy two more six packs. My only regret is that I didn't manage to get any more before the season for it stopped. I have two left now which I am holding onto like treasures for when I eat anything nicer than typical college student nonsense.

There are a good amount of hops but i find the balance to be sweeter. very sticky as well.

694,15881,8stringfan,4.22,"Poured straight down into a large tulip. Deep amber (15-16) with a two-finger head that settles down to a frothy one-finger heard after about two and a half minutes with solid lacing clinging to the sides. Nose is very sweet and floral with big notes of tropical fruit, pineapple, sweet orange, and more subdued floral hops. Compared to last year, I think this is a sweeter version, with far less pungent ganja hop aroma. Sip is sweet malt and fruit notes up front with a far greater hop presence expanding on the midpalate than the nose suggests. The hops bring a floral and resin-y funk to the party. The bitterness is somewhat tempered however, and while certainly a strong presence, the brew still hews closer to its sweeter amber ale roots. The back of the tongue however sees the bitterness become dominant, and the swallow and finish continue this trend, with subtle floral notes and light hints of grapefruit. As the beer warms a bit, the swallow is a bit more balanced, with more of the sweet malty notes, but the finish is still decidedly bitter. Despite the bitterness overtaking the whole affair and largely controlling the finish, there is never a feeling of oppressively drying tannins, which is actually something of an accomplishment and one of the reasons why, despite being a 7.3% abv beer with 93 ibus, this is a surprisingly easy drinking beer. Aiding to that ease of drinking is a soft, silky, smooth mouthfeel with light carbonation and moderate body. I would have liked to see more of the nice resin-y hop flavors of the midpalate continue a bit longer in the finish, but it’s a slight quibble for an overall terrific beer. Though I only have my notes from last year by which to judge, I think this year’s Nugget Nectar, or perhaps just my sixer, is a bit less hoppy and resin-y, so maybe they went lighter on the Tomahawk hops. Again, maybe it’s just my dim recollections, but I think I preferred the 2013 batch. That said, this is still fantastic stuff and it remains one of my favorite limited releases of the year.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

I thought the appearance was a reddish amber, clearly appropriate for the style. If I were to have smelled this beer without looking at it first, I would have sworn it was an imperial IPA. The upfront nose is all hops. On the sweet side. Best part of the beer in my opinion. On taste, it's certainly a well done amber. The initial hit to the palate is an IPA but it mellows in the end to malty amber, slightly fruity. The mouthfeel was the weakest part of this beer. It's a little milky. I left some lingering slipperiness on the tongue. Not super appealing. Overall it's nice take on an amber beer. Glad I tried it but it didn't convert me.

Some transient grapefruit on the front of the palate, again, really prominent pine in the middle along with an excellent, balanced bitterness. More flavor than straight bittering presence.

A hop head no doubt absolutely squeezing the life along with all the fresh hop juices and oils straight from the hop itself. Label is of reds, oranges, and yellow. Just a fantastic bottle to look at. Poured into a standard American pint glass.  A - nearly crystal clear body. Amber red in color with shades of copper orange when in the light. Thick white head on the pour carries a really nice creamy appearance to it. Head slowly turns into a lovely covering of creamy white lace leaving very good stick to the walls of this pint glass.  S - citrus and grapefruit up front with orange and a whiff of mellow mango. Grapefruit bite really steps to the side letting the fruitiness take control while the caramel malts blend and balance this aroma to perfection.  T - luscious flavor. Getting the hop notes we love across then balancing them in a magnificent way. Fruity and citrusy up front with mild mango, big orange and grapefruit. Sweet caramel and bread like malts really shift things into that next gear. Hop spice and a peppery note only add character to the flavor. Candied citrus and fruit pop back up just before the quick but sharp grapefruit bitter finish. This has everything anyone could ever want from a big Amber ale. Fresh hop tasting and packed full of flavor.  M - medium bodied with excellent texture. Smooth and drinkable. Texture isn't overly thick, but somehow finds its way into 'the way its supposed to be' category. Coats the mouth with its luscious flavor, gushing hop notes, and sweet malt balance.  O - Nugget Nectar is one of those very few won't absolutely fall in love with. It's the best thing going in the Amber/Red world these days and few could argue its greatness. It's easily one of the most enjoyable and overall best ales I've ever had.

694,15881,Boggdogg,4.09,"Pours a crystal clear light amber color with a nice white head that leaves a nice ring of lacing around the glass. Smell is very citrusy up front with some sweet and bitter notes added in. A very complex sleeping beer. Taste is excellent. Tastes just like it smells, bitter yet sweet. An absolute perfect balance of flavors. Starts out sweet citrus followed by slightly bitter hops taste. Overall an excellent beer with a lot of aroma and flavor balanced perfection. I heard great things about this beer and it did not disappoint. Best beer I've had from Troegs by far. Highly recommended!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,TheSixthRing,4.25,"Appearance - Pours crystal clear and sappy amber in color, forming a sandstone colored 2 finger head that exhibits good retention, leading to a thin layer of suds across the surface. Shows solid lacing around the glass, with great stick.  Smell - Citrus forward aroma with a helping hand of caramel and faint, light toasted notes.  Taste - Prominent sweet and slightly sour citrus flavors upfront and throughout; like orange with a bit of lemon zest. Juicy sweetness; just a hint of mango. Moderate pine mid-taste. Malts are present, with hints of caramel and toasted bread peeking through the thick hop bite. Finishes with a solid amount of orange pith bitterness, and it lingers well into the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel - Medium to full in body with fair, lively carbonation. Super smooth. Goes down with a light buttery ease.  Overall - A hell of an Imperial Red/IPA. Very hoppy, but manages to keep a nice drinkable balance. Yeah, drink this beer if you can get your hands on it. It really is time to recognize the Imperial Red as a classifiable beer.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,DJED69,4.39,"So after many years of looking forward to and drinking Nugget Nectar, I'm finally getting around to a review. Excellent beer! The hops are very forward and impart an amazing aroma and killer taste to this red ale. Fresh would be a word that describes the beer. Great crisp feel with a sharp hop bite. Malty, but not over the top. At 7.5% the alcohol sneaks up on you, but in no way is detected in the taste. It's a delicious brew! A late Winter tradition I look forward to yearly---highly recommended.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,magictacosinus,4.53,"Finally get to try this - a huge thanks to jdhowe for sharing two bottles of this! Poured out of a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. Both bottles were about 3-4 weeks old, if I'm not mistaken.  Yeah, that's an amber ale alright - reddish amber in color, with some light golden hues at the rim. Pours a frothy white head that sticks around for a while, leaving a ton of sticky lacing as it dissipates. It never fully recedes, however, which is nothing less than awesome given the relatively high ABV and apparent hop oiliness this contains. There's some slight sediment at the bottom, but otherwise, this is really solid. As far as I'm concerned this is a gold standard for how any self-respecting American amber ale should look.  Whoa! I've heard that the aroma on Nugget Nectar was one to be reckoned with, but I had no clue that it would be this fruity, dank, and breezy. Huge, and I mean HUGE orange rind notes immediately grace the nostrils, followed by tangerines, passion fruit, pine, and tons and tons of floral and earthy notes. White flowers, light white pepper, and a robust caramel and toffee finish that rounds up anything that would otherwise become too acidic or bitter. There's a sharp sweetness due to the extra alcohol on this, and combined with the malt profile, it really accentuates the fruity and floral aspects of the hops used in this. Really fantastic stuff - highly aromatic and inviting in every way possible.  Yeah, this is the stuff! I love hoppy amber ales as it is, but this takes the cake in terms of everything I've had before in the style. Big citrus notes grace the palate, ranging from orange to tangerines to apricots, in a juicy and ripe manner akin to actually eating the fruit itself. Huge pine, and lots of floral notes, combined with a brief cardamom and ginger spiciness at the finish. Then, as soon as the malt backbone comes in, delivering a sweet toffee and caramel goodness, it finishes off the initial bitterness and dankness in a biscuit-like manner, with toasted notes that further feel caramelized in flavor due to the higher ABV. Carbonation is really good, and the beer feels crisp and slightly chewy, with the hops always cleansing the palate while leaving the toasted malt notes at the end. Creamy and oily - I would kill to see this on nitro-tap or something. For a beer that's pretty straightforward, this is just fabulous.  This isn't the most complex beer in the world, but it delivers on all accounts on exactly what a hoppy imperial amber is supposed to be - highly fruity and oily, with a underlying hop dankness, as well as a sweet caramel profile that melds with it and softens the initial astringency. This is so easy to drink, I could pound so many of these in one evening perhaps only to my detriment. Amber beers probably don't get any better than this, and I really wish we got six packs of this distributed in California. My favorite new amber, and one of my favorite new single hop beers for sure.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

The color is a golden orange/copper with three fingers if foamy white head and some nice thick lacing left on the glass.  The nose is piney with hints of sweetness and juicy fruit aromas. The pine aroma turns into a grassy goodness that is teasing my nose.  The taste has a nice twang of bitter hops at the edges poking in between the malty sweet biscuit flavor. Each sip has its own touch of bitterness with a pop of citrus flavor a late smack of grassy, earthy hops giving of tangerine flavor.

T - Dank, earth hops. The flavor is fairly consistent throughout. I feel a strong bitterness that creeps in at mid-palate and persists through the finish. Nothing much in the way of sweetness, although I seem to remember a bit more sweetness in previous bottles.  M - Medium-bodied. A bit of softness/squishiness.

694,15881,SerialTicker,4.43,"*5/20/15 UPDATE*  Wow. Had the privilege of having a full bottle of this at Mekong in Sandusky, Ohio. It was bottled about four months ago, but it was incredible anyway -- juicy, bitter, fantastic... maybe better than I remember my sampling of it. The mouthfeel really impressed me this time, so I upped the rating: prickly, with a nearly perfect body. An incredible IPA/amber/whatever-it-is. Distinct and awesome. A must-try.  *ORIGINAL REVIEW*  I wish I had more of this. My dad got a single bottle in a mix-a-six, and I got half the bottle. I wish I had some notes to take when I was drinking it. This is one of the better IPAs I've had. The nose is great and all, but the taste is the best part. Nugget Nectar promises and delivers some massive hops, but it has plenty of sweetness from malts with the tropical notes on the nose and palate. Really a delight to drink. It's got an incredible balance. It has that IPA bitterness, but the juiciness cuts through it almost just as quickly. Pine, tropical fruits, and definitely citrus come through a lot on this one. This is most definitely more of a midwest tasting IPA with its super enjoyable bittersweet combo. Truly excellent, and one of the best beers I've ever had.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

The hit of peach and fruit comes blazing through, chased by grass and citrus, with a hint of pine, as well. The fist wiff made me think of biting into a tart bright, slightly under-ripe peach. Needless to say, I was impressed.  T - Even if the promise of peach in the nose is not fulfilled, this hoppy trip is a wonderful mix of fruits, now more citrus. Think orange and lemon, with sweetness like a peach coming underneath, and caramel and other malty notes. Pine and grass are present, too, making for a very robust hop experience. A snappy sour and bitter bite closes things out. Nothing to complain about here.  M - Given the explosion of flavor, I was expecting a real drying at the close. It is there, but not nearly as harsh as you might expect.  O - Wish this one was available at home, for sure. This is an excellent beer, with great balance, that nevertheless lays down major hop flavor without compromise.

694,15881,falloutsnow,4.05,"From: Trade with tommyguz, much thanks! Date: Bottled 2014-01-06 Glass: Tulip  Troegs' Nugget Nectar is a good, hoppy amber ale, with an enjoyably complex aroma that improves as the beer warms. The flavor is primarily dominated by hop-related flavors and associated bitterness. Good, but I was hoping that some flavor aspects of the malts used would be present, but they are completely overshadowed by the hops. Very nice, but I would not go out of my way to pick this up again.  Pours a 2cm tall head of whitish foam, composed of small-sized bubbles that yield a frothy appearance. Retention is about average, the head lasting a bit more than one minute, fading to a thin ring around the perimeter of the glass and a medium-sized island of thin foam lingering atop the body of the beer. Lacing is excellent, with thick washes and medium-sized dots and lines clinging to the walls of the glass. Body is a dark amber red color, with light bringing out brighter orange-brown-red hues. Carbonation visible through the transparent body, moderate in number and activity.  Aroma is lightly fruity and sweet, with accents of grapefruit rind, floral hop scents, light base malt sweetness, and pine resin.  Flavor is of fairly clean bitterness, with a bit of dried grassy, floral, grapefruit, and pine flavor, hooked to a low pale malt sweetness and extremely faint light-colored caramel-like flavors in the background. Front of palate tastes floral and dried grass-like hops, a bit of grapefruit rind, and a bit of lightly toasted malt sweetness. Mid-palate of high hop bitterness, but which is yet not overpowering. This allows for other flavors to show through as well, including grapefruit, flowers, dried grass, pine resin, and ethanol; little to no malt character. Back of palate tastes strong hop bitterness, grapefruit rind, pine resin, hints of toasted malt character, and ethanol. Aftertaste of dry, grapefruit and pine-like bitterness, pine mulch earthiness, and a bit of toasted malt character.  Beer is medium bodied, with carbonation of medium intensity, resulting in a subtly foamy (1/5), mostly smooth (4/5) mouthfeel that suits the beer adequately and is within stylistic boundaries. Ethanol lightly detectable in the nostrils and the back of the throat, but not unpleasant. Closes quite dry, with heavy stickiness on the palate and lips.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,LeRose,4.1,"12 ounce bottle poured into SA perfect pint glass.  Appearance is a very clear amber with a reddish tint. Head - couple fingers worth of white fluffy foam that subsided pretty quickly, did leave some lacing but not a lot. Pretty beer in the glass. It was a bubble factory with a constant stream from the bottom of the glass.  Aroma - more laid back than I expected. Hops were not overwhelming - tropical/citrus fruit notes, a faint hint pf pine and earthiness. Stayed true to the amber ale origins with a nice bready aroma from the malts. Felt it was ""topped off"" by the hops rather than dominated by hops.  The taste followed through with some very clean citrus zest notes - I thought pink grapefruit but could lean to tangerine-like. A nice sweet balance comes through with a pretty hefty hit of bitterness about midway. Some herbal qualities in the taste - just barely there as it warms up a bit. Picked up some tropical notes - seemed to fall into the mango category. Very nicely flavored beer, much more balanced than I expected.  Feel was medium bodied with ore than adequate carbonation to keep it lively. Did not expect it to be so drinkable - goes down smoothly with some bitterness and lingering sweetness and tropical fruit on the end. Aftertaste certainly reminds me of fresh mango.  Overall this is a very good, highly drinkable beer. It met my expectations in an odd way - it did not taste like I expected it to but I was not disappointed in that. If it was just another hop bomb, I would not have enjoyed it nearly as much. A nice ""meld"" of IPA and amber styles.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,KFBR392,4.03,"Appearance: Ruby red transparent color. Light head on the pour and only present on the edges of the glass. Sticky lacing left behind at each level. Minimal active carbonation.  Smell: Initial nose of bitter hops. Body is filled with amber malt, caramel, and lots of molasses. That malty body continues to stand out very strong throughout. Piney hop poke themselves through the malt toward the back end.  Taste: Pretty much what you'd expect after the aroma. Splash of hops on the front when that big malty body makes itself known. Toffee is definitely the biggest player, stifling the palate. The finish lightens up with sweeter malt tones.  Mouthfeel: Rich malt body is truly impressive.

694,15881,ThePaintedGrey,4.48,"12oz. bottle poured into pint glass.  A: Pours a perfectly pristine copper-esque amber (obviously). A light tan (nearly off-white, maybe?) head sits about 2 inches thick after the pour, taking its time to deflate to a perfectly creamy cap that's well-maintained and retains nicely. TONS of sticky lacing down the glass.  S: Super hoppy! Lots of floral and herbal hops with some citrus fruit and maybe even hints of passionfruit? The hop aroma is unfathomably complex and off-the-charts. A little bit of malt presence underneath doesn't even attempt to get in the way of the hops—just enough to let you know it's there.  T: I hate to be vague, but it basically follows through with the nose. TONS of hop goodness, hop complexity, hop presence. Did I mention the hops? Seriously, though... this brew is chock full of hops and there's a lot of complexity in the flavor; it's not just a full-on hop assault. A fantastic wave of bitterness that isn't pungent, but is strong enough to please any hophead. A nice jolt of toasted malts in the finish cuts through the bitterness.  M: Not quite full-bodied, but definitely hovers above medium. A well-controlled carbonation keeps the brew crisp, but doesn't detract from the silky smooth texture. This one feels sessionable for sure, but at 7.5% ABV, I might think otherwise after a second pint...  O: Nugget Nectar is an absolutely fantastic release from Troegs that I admittedly wish was a year-round brew. It offers a wonderfully complex hop profile that's an absolute delight to any IPA fan, but it also has a controlled bitterness so it won't come across as too pungent for those that aren't really into hop assaults.

Lacing is ridiculous.  S - Damn, this smells heavenly. Lots of orange peel in this one, as well as pineapple, lemon peel, grapefruit and caramel.  T - Kind of similar to the scent, but not as strong in my opinion. There's orange, pineapple, and the distinct malts you get from amber beers. Bitterness is medium to high (~95 IBU), but it works very well in this beer.  M - Mouthfeel is medium or so and goes down easily. Barely any alcohol detectable, if at all.  O - I'm glad to have tried this beer, and it is an amazing example of an amber, even if it drinks more like an IPA. It stands out and is worthy of its high praise.

694,15881,Mongrel,3.83,"So I buy a sixer of this stuff every year just to try and figure out what all the hype is about. It's a good beer, don't get me wrong, but I think it's still a bit overrated.  Appearance in the glass is nice - an orangey amber with about a finger of off-white head that pretty much disappears in a few minutes. Decent lacing.  Smell is a hint of things to come in that it's very bright. Includes pine and citrus for a cool and juicy effect. There is also a faint hint of cool booze on the nose. Nothing really bursts forward - it's somewhat mellow.  Taste is nice and juicy at first - a good mix of juicy, piney hops and sweet honey/caramel malts. Again, all in a very bright fashion. The sweetness fades a little too quickly though and the back half of the sip is a bit too thin and dry. Could use more sweetness to balance out the somewhat astringent booze and abundant hopping. That said, the hop profile is pretty classic - big and robust enough to keep your attention, but far from a palate wrecker.  Mouthfeel - again, really nice at first, but a bit too thin and dry towards the end of the sip.

Smell: Nice citrusy, resiny, and piney Nugget hops followed by caramel, chocolate, and toasted malts.  Taste: Boy do I love Nugget hops. Tangerine, pine, resiny, tingly bitterness, pine, grassy, and spicy. Nice compliment of caramel, chocolate, and bready malts.  Mouthfeel: Super smooth, medium bodied, tingly bitterness, medium carbonation, and a little chewy.  Overall: From one year to another, this beer never fails. World class and top notch.

694,15881,AnthonyBeerdain,3.89,"Poured into a pint glass. Bottled on 5-Feb-2014.  Aroma Fresh piney, spicy hops. Caramel maltiness. Maybe some pilsner malt. No alcohol detected. No indication of yeast.  Appearance Crystal clear, orange/amberThin white head that quickly disappears. Tiny bubbles continue rising from the bottom of the glass throughout the experience. It could have a larger and/or long-lasting head to improve its appearance.  Flavor Nugget Nectar quickly makes an impression on the taste buds. First impression is a welcomed malty/caramel sweetness followed by some hop dankness, exhibiting an impressive citrus and pine assault. A very nice and lasting hop bitterness sticks around long after the beer is gone. Could benefit from a bit more of a malt presence.  Mouthfeel Medium- to light-bodied. Lighter carbonation.  Overall Impression Used to be one of my favorite beers. It's still up there, but I'm less impressed now than I have been in previous years. It could be that my overall beer experience, having grown and expanded, has changed my opinion of the beer as a whole. Definitely more of an IPA style than an Amber. It's well-made and I'll continue picking it up every year.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,JohnnyHopps,4.6,"Appearance - The beer was a handsome deep copper color with a bubbly white head topping the glass. No sediment was noted, lacing was left all around the glass.  Smell - The citrus hops are noted with pine following closely behind the citrus. The aroma was quite potent.  Taste - I could drink a lot of this one. The resin notes are mild at the front, yielding to orange, orange rind, pine, with malt becoming more obvious toward the back. What is remarkable is the balance in this beer. No aspect really jumps out, but all are very present. The bitterness comes to the front in the aftertaste, yet it does not overwhelm what comes before it.  Mouthfeel - the carbonation does not overwhelm making this a smooth beer. It allows the taste of linger and be appreciated.  Overall - I could drink this all day. I wish we got this in Indiana.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,scotorum,4.2,"Part of a trade with BigStein88. Thanks again George!  Bottled 1/14/14.  Poured from the 12 oz. bottle into an Innis & Gunn flute.  a: Clear amber with an inch tall white head which receded to even surface foam and very dense lacing.  s: Moderate citrus and pine  t: Fruity hops forward gives way to pretty intense pine over medium malt base. Bitterness lingers at the sides of the tongue. Some fruit tones in the otherwise dry finish.  m; Moderate, good body. Good carbonation tingle.  o; I have not been a huge fan of Troegs up to now, although I have tried most of their lineup. But this is justifiably a top tier amber IPA. I understand it is 93 IBUs. It tastes it, and the 7.5 ABV is well-concealed.

Very grassy with hints of sticky pine needles. Big juicy grapefruit pulp and tangy citrus rind.  T - small hints sweet caramel and burnt sugar which are quickly demolished by a tidalwave of grapefruit and bitter orange peel flavors.

694,15881,TheIPAHunter,4.7,"There's nothing like waking up to hops on your doorstep. A special shout out to joecodename for executing the plan to perfection. 12 oz. bottle poured into an AleSmith pint. Blood orange in appearance, this crimson colored ale is giving me flashbacks of my first encounter with Sofia Vergara. Aye! The last time I saw this much lace I was backstage at a Victoria's Secret fashion show. The nose detects candied citrus, sugary malts and enough dank hops to make a weed distributor salivate. The taste follows the nose and, quite ridiculously, is easily one of the best all-around beers I have ever consumed. YES -- it lives up the hype and then some. The feel is very smooth on the front side, with some lingering grapefruit bitterness in the finish. Beers like this leave me eternally hoptimistic.

694,15881,LambicPentameter,4.02,"Thanks to BA SammyJaxxx for sending these along. I've wanted to try this one for awhile. Poured out of a brown 12 oz bottle with a bottling date of 01/14/14 stamped near the neck of the bottle. Poured into the IPA-specific Speigelau glass, as I've heard that this one is very hop forward, so it might benefit from the features of the glass.  Appearance - Pours the color of it's style name, with a clear, jewel-like rust red with amber highlights and an active bubble show rising up from the laser etching on the bottom of the glass. The carbonation bubbles stream up to replenish a one-finger head the color of off-white that retains for several minutes before dissipating to a fairly thick film across the top that remains. Lacing is minimal, leaving some faint rings as I drink the beer down.  Smell - I honestly expected the hop presence to be more aggressive based on what I'd heard about this beer, but in many ways, I'm happy that it retains it's ""amber ale"" roots. Notes of bright tropical fruits and some more subtle citrus zest, along with a more bready presence from the malt profile.  Taste - The tropical fruits and hops aren't quite as present in the taste, giving way to the gentle sweetness of the caramel malts alongside some pleasantly pungent bitterness. But as I let it warm and continue to drink it, the hoppiness becomes more obvious with some citrus and herbal notes alongside the tropical components, reminding me a bit of mango and pineapple.  Mouthfeel - Medium-light bodied and moderate carbonation, with a great juiciness that makes for a deliciously drinkable beverage. Aftertaste has a slight bitterness.  Overall, a very good amber ale, but I have to disagree with the fact that people call it an IPA. Yes, it's got a more aggressive hop presence than many of your more traditional amber ales (Fat Tire comes to mind), but this beer is more amber than it is ""india pale"". Regardless, I will enjoy drinking the rest of these bottles very much.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

S: Toast, malt, some light piney, maybe a little citrus hops.  T: Piney, resiny hops, moderate toast and amber malt, and light sweetness, finishing with a moderate but appropriate grippy dry bitterness.

694,15881,Ljudsignal,4.35,"12oz bottle poured into a Night Shift tulip. Big thanks to jaltland for this stellar extra.  Pours a clear, bright amber--looks like burnished copper. Frothy off-white head, about one-and-a-half fingers high. Medium carbonation, spotty lacing.  Smells like...well, at first whiff it honestly smells like a strawberry-banana smoothie. The nose seems to change slightly after a few whiffs, however, as bready, oatmealy malt notes begin to appear and the hop profile becomes slightly spicier and earthier--a bit dirtier, as it were.  In the mouth, an initial surge of piney and grapefruity hops is quickly cut into by a lightly sweet wheat bread malt note. Blood orange and tangerine hop flavors appear mid-palate, as well as tantalizingly subtle notes of mango, pineapple, and what I'd swear is strawberry. Finishes quite dry, with a resurgence of fresh green pine and a touch of caramel malts.  Medium-bodied, with zippy carbonation balancing an otherwise slick and sticky mouthfeel. Finishes at once resinous from the hops and sticky-sweet from the robust malt backbone. ABV is well-hidden.  On the whole, this is a magnificent amber ale, probably the best I've had. The robusticity of the malts brings the beer together while still allowing the hops to shine. Delicious.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

A good 2 finger head on the pour that doesn't stick around long. Constant carbonation that keeps some foam floating around the top. Fantastic lacing follows the beer down.  Not an overwhelming aroma, but very pleasant. The malt sweetness comes through with a slight citrus and alcohol smell.  Perfectly balanced between malt and hops. Great sweetness that is cut nicely by the bitterness. Very smooth and drinkable, with no real noticeable alcohol flavor.  Nice flavor lingers, a little sticky sweetness like with all amber ales.

694,15881,cjgiant,4.13,"Bottle review 1/2017: Pours a clear orangerish Amber. Head builds easily, half a glass on a really aggressive pour, about 2.5 fingers on a more normal pour. Lacing is fairly heavy.  Nose is caramel based hoppiness. It's a citrusy (orange rind) to lightly tropical hoppiness, and really blends with the malts well. This is often called a mis-styled IPA, but the nose is more balanced, either a nice old school east coast IPA.  Taste actually hits with bitterness first - a grapefruit pith/pine classic American IPA note. The malt catches up fast, bringing caramel and a little candied orange peel, likely as a result of the combination with the hop bitterness. The edges of my tongue continue to sense the bitterness throughout, and eventually that piney/resiny bitterness encompasses the entire palate.  Always an enjoyable beer that doesn't really give me too much of that bitter/amber taste conflict that I don't like. It's there, but muted.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,da_beers,4.17,"A - Pours a beautiful, clear, amber with hints of copper. Nice white two-fingers of bubbly head. Lacing coming down evenly on all sides, all the way down.  S - Sweet malts tickle the nose at first, then comes a huge earthy, piney, hop aroma that lingers in the nose. Some faint citrus in the back (poured in a regular bar-pint glass, not a spiegelau glass which would have lent to more auromas).  T - Wow. I've heard alot about this beer, and it isn't dissapointing. Hop forward, but =balance of malt and hops are spot on. Sweetness from malts are nice, subtle. The hops and resiny qualities are great. Some grapefruit (similar to Perpetual in citrusness), some earthyness, great across palate.  M - Medium body. So drinkable that its scary. It says ""Imperial"" on the bottle, but at 7.5, and its drinkability, make it seem less than Imperial (thats ok by me, I'd like to enjoy a few at a time). Low carbonation, but great.

694,15881,ZagZagg,4.21,"12 oz bottle poured into the trusty pint glass  A: Clear light red amber hue with medium carbonation. White to off-white head that looks about one and a half fingers. Weak retention with little lacing; the body looks med to light.  S: Somewhat spicy, and resinous – a little floral with a certain dryness, there’s a whirling citrus sweetness. Some tangy fruits bring out a interesting nose, apple, hints of grape/white grape, bit of mango. Lightly piney, a bit of swirling brings out pear-pineapple and a flowery bouquet.  T: Hop forward, and jumps with a somewhat unexpected dryness (but not overly dry). Very delectable, but struggling to tease out the individual profiles, but tangy. A warmer taste reveals a more piquant citrus zest, with a robust malty backbone. A pine influenced, but tenuous tropical flavor. Delectably well balanced, and more diversified that I had anticipated.  M: Medium bodied, moderate carbonation, sweet semi-dry steadfast aftertaste. Wouldn’t say this quenches a thirst, reminds me of iced tea for some reason. The dryness is that pine inspired resin.  O: The nose and the name (hype aside) had me subconsciously expecting an IPA styled flavor profile. I was a little blindsided by the big malt backbone, but it pulls the overall experience together. The beer is well balanced and a very interesting take on the amber genre.

Absolutely Incredible.  Aroma and taste is as solid as steak and red wine. I get that nectarine that has been upgraded to this boozy, juicy fruit that has the funkyness of weed, while I sled down a slide of malts, more hops, and a mystery flavored exhale that I have never been able to describe but love very much. Needless to say, I was over-the-top impressed.  M - Mouthfeel - This was the best part of the beer. THIS is the mouthfeel I expect from a beer I want refreshment from. It's the type of fizz that is gentle to the front of your mouth, but more intense in the back of your mouth; it hits your back throat with this fizz that you just need when tasting something so damn good, something that hurts a little is there to wake you up just a bit. Just awesome. I just loved letting it sit on my tongue for a second, let the entire tongue just saturate it all in, think about how awesome it is, and then take it in.

It wasn't as hoppy as I expected it to be, (which is good), did have a very citrusy taste (not so good), but it would be something I would consider drinking if it was around.

S - Orange, grapefruit, a little pine, and a little bready malt in the background.  T - follows the nose but pine is a little stronger. I'd say pine is the main hop characteristic with a citrus note right behind it.  M - Finishes a little boozy and bitter. Pine aftertaste.  O - It's a very nice change of pace from the IPA craze. If the bitterness is toned down and the booze was a little better hidden, this would be pretty close to perfect.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Omnium,4.56,"Bottle &gt; Voodoo 12oz sniffer  A - Lovely clear orange color, a finger of white foamy head mild spotty lacing. S - Huge tropical notes mango, papaya, dragonfruit, pineapple, lots of peach, some bright pine and floral quality to it, a biscuity and sweet maltiness. Excellent aroma. T - Tropical notes in the aroma dont come out as thoroughly in flavor, a lot of orange, big biscuit and bread malt profile, a touch of lemon peel, some peach juice. M - A little dry and the bitterness does tend to hang on for a while, a little alcohol warmth in the end. O - Still one of the best winter/spring seasonals you can get your hands on. The aroma this year has been the best I've ever experienced.  Notes from 2-15-13: A - Pours a vibrant sunset orange, rich amber color. Mild head with decent lacing.  S - Bold rich hops, the nugget really pops in this beer clearly giving it the name. Pine, floral, a light sweetness in the end, a little bit of spice in the bitterness by the IBU.  T - Crisp, fresh, aggressive hop presence, not real citrusy like a west coast, but some orange in there, get some piney flavors as well, the aftertaste does carry some bitterness thats not very appealing, but can easily be overlooked  M - Decent carbonation that gets broken by the flavors of the nugget hops which fades out to the bitterness, I can actually feel the 7.5% in this as well.  O - A fantastic brew, one that I feel is consistent year by year. With most breweries seeking to be the king of the IPA realm, Troegs knocks it out of the park with something thats slightly off the beaten path. Drinks with the bite of an IPA, but has other qualities that make this beer stand out amongst the rest. Props Troegs!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,jbwimer,4.28,"Finally had the chance to but a 6-pack today. This is already my third. Clearly I'm good with pacing myself. Bottled 12/2013. Gotta assume it was bottled near the end of the month, cause this still tastes pretty fresh.  A- LOVE the look of this beer. Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip glass and it builds up to a three finger, off-white head. A gorgeous, translucent amber makes this an enticing brew. Head retains well with solid lacing left on the glass. Really good looking beer here.  S- Smells awesome. Great hop presence. Juicy tropical fruits. I'm getting a lot of pineapple. Slight grassiness. Honey. Slight ""pepperiness"" Malt backbone is evident. Really well balanced nose.  T- Very similar to the nose, but not as accentuated. Juicy flavors are there, but not as bold as the nose. Decent hop bitterness. Just enough malt to balance out the hops with some nice caramel sweetness. All in all, pretty nice.  M- Nice and smooth. Bordering between a light and medium mouthfeel. Solid carbonation. Really smooth beer, this one is.  O- Incredibly enjoyable seasonal beer from Troegs. Needless to say I'll be picking up another sixer. The look and smell of this beer are it's strong points. Not that the other areas suffer too much...

Beautiful amber color, with very thick white head which dissipated slowly, leaving nice even lacing all the way through the experience. Incredibly powerful nose, with unique scent of orange peel and pine dominating on the front end. On the palate, soft citrus fruit sets the pace, and the bite of the hops is subtle yet clear/crisp. The alcohol is virtually undetectable, which is understandable in this relatively low OG amber. Tremendous mouthfeel -- soft and chewy. Overall, this one lives up to the hype IMHO. A very nice, crisp, smooth, and imminently quaffable pour. I look forward to drinking many more.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Pine aromas hit the nose upfront followed by tropical fruits and citrus. The nose on this beer is amazing.  T- BAM! Your taste buds are slammed with hop flavor that last well after each sip. The flavor starts off thick and resin like, followed by a burst of pine with undertones of citrus and tropical fruits. It finishes dry leaving a lingering bitterness. It's hard to put this beer down, you want another sip immediately after one another.  M- There's a very thick resin like mouth-feel at the beginning of each sip. It mellows out and becomes dry. The carbonation is on the low side.  O- An amazing beer, I don't know why they don't just make this stuff year round.

Still a good amber ale. The color was a gorgeous copper penny color with perfect clarity. The smell was roasted malts with mild citrus. The taste is bitter orange peel, piny & herbal with with a lingering marmalade finish. I found the 2014 version of the Nugget Nectar to be lacking in the caramel, nutty finish it was know for and I had grown to love but nonetheless it's still a top flight beer from a top flight brewery! Last year I rated the Nugget at 95 and the Nugget Firkin at 97. This year I would rate this Nugget at around a 90. Still a good beer bust missing something!

I thought it was thin and watery, overly malty, and really deficient in flavor. No evidence of alcohol, either. Very disappointing - I had this from a bottle 2 years ago, and rated it a lot higher. Frankly, I wonder if the waitress didn't get the order mixed up. Will try again and re-review as appropriate.  Update: Bottle ""freshest by"" 04/25/18, so I'm well within what Troegs considers their window of opportunity. (I wish they'd just put the ""bottled on"" date on the bottle and let US judge the freshness...). Much better than my previous experience - citrus, pine, and caramel. Medium mouthfeel and carbonation; perfect for the style. Finish is semi-dry and invites the next sip. Ratings revised to reflect my more recent experience.

694,15881,WoodBrew,4.06,The Nugget Nectar is a GOOD beer. The beer poured rich copper clear that had a thin white head which left a nice lace. The scent was a dark rich sweet malt with piny citrus overtones. The taste starts slightly bitter then the sweet malt begins to take over and provide a decent finish. Toward the end one will pick up the higher abv. The mouthfeel was full body with decent carbonation.

M - carbonation is light but no coating. Goes down smooth.  It was good but not great. As it warmes the sweetness dissipates.

694,15881,KYGunner,4.14,"I go into this review knowing that my bottle is within the ""expiration"" date but old enough that the integrity of the hops is depleted. Nugget Nectar is known for big hop flavor, much like an IPA, so I'll review this as the Imperial Amber that is written on the label.  The color is bright, sleek and iridescent with bright orange and light amber. The head was alive in a quickly dissipating rush of carbonation.  This is where the review will suffer as the scent is slightly piney hops but it has more of a biscuity malt aroma. Some toasty aroma, some pecan, this has a nice scent minus the citrus that has been lost.  I love an amber ale and Nugget Nectar holds its own as an amber. Strong toasty malt goodness, touches of biscuit, nutty pecan and hints of pine meld well together. Where this excels is in the feel. It's like water in it ease, but full in its body. It's very deceptive and masks the ABV very well.  Overall, this review is subject to edit when a new batch arrives but if I found it sitting on a shelf four months old, I'd still buy it in a second.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Blends perfectly into a crisp but not too biting hop. Just a little bit of pine and stickiness.  Feel is lusciously medium thick. Really coats the mouth, but not syrupy. Truly like juice.

The malt is full and round on the nose, toasty then giving way to a toffee sweetness. Taste is piney, resin, bitter and delightful with breaddy malt. The malty sweetness keeps increasing on the palate and the strong malt base is inexhaustible next to the thundering hops. Finishes dry, slick, crisp and both the hops bitter and the malt sweetness dance on the tongue long after the swallow.

LOTS of bubbles rising from the bottom of the glass. Smell – Well you could pretty much smell the piney orange aroma from across the room. Taste – Pine sap, citrus, very hoppy, slight caramel… bitterness lingers.  Well from the get-go this beer is awesome. The appearance of it is the very definition of amber… in fact I kind of felt like John Hammond when I poured this out:  [Image of John Hammond from Jurassic Park looking at the amber at the end of his cane]  Minus the Mosquito of course... sorry for that image. I love the tiny little bubbles that are forever being summoned from the bottom of the glass, which stay put on the walls of the glass as lacing as you consume this tasty beverage. This sure is an intense and powerful beer that has the qualities you would expect it would have by merely looked at the label; it’s the same color, and it tastes like you’re squeezing the shit out of a hop.

Malty and a hop forward.  Overall it's outstanding. A super hopped up liquid that's beautifully crafted.

Grapefruit, pine, fresh cut grass, and sweet, bready malt form the initial aroma. Tropical notes of pineapple and mango emerge.  Flavor is a bit more subtle than anticipated at first, with underpinnings of citrus giving way quickly to bitter hops, all amidst a bready caramel malt backbone. Subsequent sips reveal sticky resin, lime, and a muddled general citrus character, which has become far more dominant. The finish is decidedly resinous and bitter. The malt backbone caves to the hop barrage.  Body is moderate and smooth, with moderate carbonation and a fair amount of alcohol warmth.  Expected more malt presence, but great hop character.

A pleasing warm amber-orange color; rather weak retention that was partly but not completely due to the cold. Aroma brings to mind a copper-dipped pine cone nestled in clover and dandelion. Taste experience is just a little short, overall, but builds up to a bitter burst from a foundation of caramel-smoked hemp. There is a nutty nose blended in the back half of the flavor that I just can't place... It sits heavy on the middle of the tongue, but falls off the sides quickly into an almost tannic sort of creaminess. Carbonation balances the chew rather nicely. There's more length on draught than out of the bottle. A pleasure to drink alone or with a variety of savory eats. Overall, it's one of the best regularly available consistent products from a favorite independent brewery.

Kind of like Raul's first ginger, he's happy that he tried it, but he'll pass the second time around.  *Edit  A year later, Raul indulged himself again and he figures that it's not a bad beer (not that the main man thought that it was before) but it's definitely above average.

My no-alcohol wife even says it smells inoffensive when she normally hates the smell of most beers, and that's a lot to say about an ""imperial"" variety.  Taste - 93ish IBU? Perhaps, but very floral hops, not the bitterness one would expect. Extremely drinkable, goes down easy despite having a lot of taste. I dare say that there's sweetness, but not enough to bother a hophead.  Mouthfeel - Exact amount of carbonation, not too much or little. Thick, but you won't need a fork and knife.

694,15881,Benish,4.33,"Poured in a snifter glass.  Gave a subtle amber color with a thick head. The beer smelled of citrus. At the moment, nothing else comes to mind except citrus. To me its more like an IPA rather than an amber however the color of the beer tells me it's an amber.  It taste great, its really like drinking a decent double IPA. The first that comes to my mind is Lagunitas Sucks. Nugget Nectar gives a bitter yet sweet citrus flavor, just like Sucks.  Overall I really like this beer, however because I live in WI and not PA, I'm happy with the IPA's and Double IPA's I can get here without going through the trouble of getting the Nectar Nugget. What I really do like about this beer is after I finished the bomber (I drank the entire thing myself), I wanted another one. It was so drinkable, perfect for a canoe trip to split with a buddy on a hot sunny day or sitting by the campfire in the evening hours. I drank it to the last drop and I was like ""Man, if I could just have another glass!"" A quick and easy drinking; a single bomber was not overwhelming if you don't have anyone to share it with!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,JAlvy,4.58,"Another great beer from the brothers. I look forward the this beer every year. It is a hoppy, juicy imperial amber ale. Most people would call this an IPA. A nice play off of one of their flagship beers. The hop back puts this beer over the top. It pours a nice orangish color and lacing head. The best part is it tastes like it smells, fruity, hoppy and citrusy. Hops and malt are very well balanced for this beer. Coming in at 7.5 ABV. it drinks easy. If you are hop head like me (93 IBU's) you need to get this brew when it's available. I am on my second 1/6 this year!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,StonedTrippin,4.21,"its like the hopback on steroids. the pour is almost ruby red, super radiant amber color with a few inches of fading white fluff. it looks pretty dense. the nose is real hoppy, more like an imperial ipa than the red its listed as here, piney and resinous, like strong ganja, with a nice dusty caramel red malt underpinning. i like the hop flavor of this beer, its complex and tricky, some citrus in there amongst the trees, pleasantly refreshing for its gravity, and really well balanced by the malts. troegs has gotten the big beers down pat, with the mad elf and the troegenator, in your face beers that still retain some degree of drinkability. id happily attempt a sixer of this! nice carbonation and a lot of body, long sticky hop finish. the label is just right for this beer, it tastes like what comes to mind when looking at the bottle, its perfect really. i like the red malt bill for this, it makes the standard big ipa a whole lot more interesting. very well done.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,JMScowcroft,4.75,"Troegs Brewing Company - Nugget Nectar - 12fl oz bottle  Another brew picked up by Hendry and generously shared.  Look - Pours deep amber with an orange hue around the outside. Full, soapy head that dissipates at a medium pace. Good lacing. Moderate carbonation.  Smell - Malty, sweet and tangy with tropical citrus hops on top. Mouth watering and quite unique.  Taste - Snappy dry malt with a bitter hop kick right after, tropical fruits creep in after.  Mouthfeel - Wow! Very nice dry mouthfeel that makes you crave another sip. Taste, refreshing, and not boozy at all!  Overall - This is a must try brew for sure. It is unique, flavorful, thirst quenching, sweet, tangy, and very enjoyable. Cheers!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Hamburgers,4.54,"Pours a crystal clear, slightly brownish red. One finger white head. Aroma is super malty with notes of citrus, grass and tropical fruit. Flavors of something I can't quite put my finger on. Hold on, this is a damn good beer. I'm captivated by it. It's a beautiful beer. There is so much depth. I'm totally won over. Been wanting to try this for a long time and it really lives up to the hype. Wow!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Hendry,4.74,"Troegs is another brand that takes some effort for a Vermonter to get their hands on, and after reading multiple favorable reviews in addition to many mentioning Nugget Nectar on the BA site, I had to try it, so on a recent trip across the Lake to NY I had my chance.  Beautiful amber color,very slight head even upon aggressively pouring into my Lawson's snifter. What head that appeared dissipated quickly, but the nose draws you in: the blend of hops is happy & peppy & bursting with love, gives off an above average aroma that invites the first sip.  The body and carbonation are medium, and the hops stand out nicely for an amber ""imperial."" This is what Samuel Adams probably wishes they could mass produce for $9/six pack but the price of admission is $13/six pack if you can find it. Two friends loved it, one was lukewarm on it (certified DIPA nut).  There is a distinct hop blast to this tasty amber that is delivered in a somewhat sweet honey/toffee toned package. Highly drinkable with a certain panache to it, next to no alcohol detected, and complex in character. One of those six packs that tends to be not as well stocked as the surrounding ones in the cooler, and the store owner mentioned that they limit him on how many he can be allotted. Nugget Nectar is a great beer that is not available locally for me, but worth the effort to stock up on as it is worthy of the ""beer archive"" status in my garage fridge. Fans of IIPA would do well to try Troegs Perpetual IPA, which is of a different character",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Jeffo,4.2,"Been waiting a couple years to finally try this beer, so a big cheers to SliverX for sending this one over.  From a bottle into a snifter Bottled 31 Jan 2013  APPEARANCE: Pours a one finger, medium looking, fluffy, off-white head with good retention. Perfectly clear burnt orange in color with medium levels of carbonation evident. Head fades to a wisp and clings to the sides of the glass. A nice, full wisp remains until the end and leaves some good lacing down the glass.  SMELL: Caramel, melon and some pineapple notes on the nose. Citrus aromas with grapefruit and some light toffee as well. Aromatic and enticing.  TASTE: Caramel and toffee sweetness with some melon, citrus flavors and some piney bitterness at the swallow. Bold and lingering finish of piney hops, lemon and grapefruit citrus flavors, hop bitterness and some nice toffee sweetness as balance. Very flavorful and wonderfully balanced. Excellent stuff.  PALATE: Medium body and carbonation, creamy smooth on the palate, goes down smooth and finishes rather dry. Some bitterness lingers.  OVERALL: This was well worth the wait. An excellent and enjoyable hoppy ale that went down way too easily. Would love to drink this on a regular basis and I envey those of you who do. Thanks again for the beers SliverX. This one comes highly recommended.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,SaisonRichBiere,4.35,"Thanks to ThePorterSorter for this one.  Served in a pint mug poured from a 12oz bottle.  Appearance- Pours a crystal clear, bright amber orange, with a sizable bubbly head. Tiny bubbles pump out all over the place. Like a beer commercial. Awesome looking.  Smell- Big fruit. Honeyed melon and cantaloupe, with tart candied lychee vibes. Crisp white wine fruitiness in there as well. Subtle earthy hop aromas creep in, with a very faint malty finish.  Taste- Sweetness all around. Turbinado sugary candied hop, caramelly honey nut Cheerios maltiness, and clean grassy finish. Orange zest and earty hops linger on the tongue and palate. Really tasty stuff.  Mouthfeel- Slightly fizzy with a sugary mouth coat. A tad overbearing, bit expected for an imperial.  Overall- A great beer. Very glad I got a few of these. Sweet and hopped up at first, but finishes clean, caramelly, and malty like an amber should. I would love a draft version, or maybe even a BA version!

694,15881,Sludgeman,4.34,"Re-review of this beer. As you can see by comparing the two reviews I had two totally different experiences almost two years apart. I have toned down my rating a bit based on my more recent experience.  -----  Reviewed Feb 6, 2015  Bottled on Jan 29, 2015. This beer was eight days old when I tried it. Poured into a nonic pint.  A decent double IPA. I have no major criticisms, but in today’s world of extremes it does nothing exceedingly well in my opinion. 3.75  A – Pours beautiful clear reddish amber with a two-finger off-white moussey head. Head has a tinch of reddish orange in it. 4.0  S – Slight sweetness, malty, blossoms. 3.25  T – Malt, minor citrus notes, some bitter grassy resinous hops in the finish. 3.5  MF – Medium body, semi-dry finish, bright in the mouth. 3.75  ---- Reviewed 3/31/13  Bottled on 2-8-13. Poured into pint glass.  A – Pours a clear amber color with a one-finger white head. Dissipates to a thin white layer. Nice lacing. Average carbonation.  S – Wonderful flora and herbal notes. Rose like qualities and some Italian spices.  T – Sweetness. Nice maltiness balanced against a hoppiness that is clearly evident but not overwhelming. Not too bitter.  MF – Smooth with some slight sharpness on the tongue from the carbonation and hops.  O – A beer that classic amber ale taste upgraded with the nugget hops for greater balance and a wonderful aroma. I will always attempt to keep a six of this in the fridge.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,HarryPotHead,4.45,"ST - poured from 12 oz brown bottle into hollow 1970's era hollow stem Gunther Brewery goblet.  A - rusty amber color with a slight haze. Not much head. Avg lacing.  S - tangy citrus and pine. Not overpowering. Well balanced.  T - hops predominate as you would expect from a beer named nugget nectar! Hard core hop heads may be left wanting more, but I think the Troeg brothers have done a remarkable job keeping this brew very well balanced and approachable.  M - not overly carbonated but still feels crisp and refreshing. Slick.  O - a very good brew. Drank a few down before I noticed that the ABV was a nice 7.5%...well balanced and simple pine and citrus favors do an excellent job of masking the alcohol content with little to no warming effect. I found these really easy to drink even though I'm just starting to warm up to hop heavy brews. I'm more of a porter / stout fan, but even a hop noob like me can see why they call this ""nugget nectar""! Awesome label too!!  2.14.2020 update: Back to this seasonal brew a couple years later and the review above is spot on then and now. Great beer.

Taste is unlike any other beer I have had, I can't place it, it starts out like an APA, but bites on the finish like a west coast IPA, the best of both worlds I guess.

Hoppy and bright, yet balanced and almost sweet.  T- That's it, I'm sold. It's distinctively different than anything I've ever had, and it works. Starts pretty mellow and quickly escalates in to a hop frenzy and finishes bitter but clean.  M- Light to medium bodied with an above average amount of carbonation.  O- This beer is pretty enjoyable.

The bottle boasts Nugget, Warrior, and Tomahawk hops. It is quite citrusy, spicy, and bold. Sweet notes follow.  Quite a hoppy taste that is very good. Nice mouth feel with a medium body. The hops are bold and push the edge of the envelope. Citrus and pine are up front in taste and caramel malts compliment the hops. Very good composition and very drinkable. The more I drink of this the more I Iove it.  Aftertaste is spicy and lots of citrus notes linger. Finishes dry with a bite. .

694,15881,BaltimoreBeerLover,4.24,"Poured from 12 oz bottle into a wine glass. A few months in the fridge but hopefully it won't take away from the flavor.  Appearance: Beautiful looking beer. A honey-red with not almost no head, but very nice lacing that sticks to glass indefinitely.  Smell: Very sweet, but not fake sweet. Brown sugar and honey, but not a brown sugar smell as pronounced in Lagunitas' beers. Caramel and maple too. This beer doesn't smell simply of dried malts either as in other beers I've had.  Taste: Delicious. Very sweet up front but not sickeningly sweet like Leinenkugel. Less hoppy than I was expecting for 93 IBUs. The sweetness isn't just the taste of dried malts but I can't put my finger on it. I'm going to stick with the caramel/maple I mentioned for smell.  Mouthfeel: Medium-high carbonation. Sweetness and hoppiness both linger strongly for a while after the sip. Hoppiness is present in the back of the throat but to much lesser extent than Stone Ruination IPA for example.  Overall: One of my favorite beers. This beer has a great balance of sweetness and hops while being able to remain strong on both those flavors. The hoppy bitterness found in a great IPA along with balanced sweetness make this a fantastic beer. 4.3/5",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Thanks to powz87!  Aroma: Quite a lot of sticky-smelling sweetness making me think of caramel and toffee balanced nicely by a crisp, refreshing citrus/grapefruit aroma likely from the hops. Really nice smell that leans towards the malt portion of the brew. Just the way I like it. (4)  Colour: Pours a nice, clear amber colour with a 2cm white head that dissipates within a minute into a thick white collar. The lacing is sticky and lovely looking. (4)  Flavour: Boy this is a nice malty beer with a hoppy ending. I am really enjoying the caramel and sugary sweetness that only gets accentuated by the hoppy grapefruit bitterness that picks up halfway through and takes it all the way to the bitter end. A lot of beers have a lot of malt and a lot of hops- not a great many make the flavors from these contributions blend together this well. (4.25)  Mouthfeel: A crisp, medium-bodied beer with very good carbonation. A bit dry tasting despite being somewhat resinous but otherwise easily quaffable. Aftertaste is a reasonably intense bitter grapefruit that doesn't leave the tongue for minutes afterwards. (4)  Overall: Really a well-put together beer whose bitter quotient rivals that of many DIPAs. I could drink this every day if I could get Tröegs here.

S - Some fresh citrus and piney hops, mild malt. Very crisp and light. Not really in your face or bold, but certainly nothing bad. If it were a little more prominent, it would be higher.  T - Paying attention to the ""rate it by the style"" rules, this is easily the best amber I've ever had. Taste is super smooth, the hop profile is light but thick, if that makes sense. There is light hop note of bitter citrus and pine is not overwhelming, but it is extremely prominent. Very very smooth. Slight bittering finishes it off. Easy to drink.  M - medium carbonation, little bit creamy, very good.  O - As I said before, as ambers go, this thing is the best.

The aforementioned strong grapefruit and pine flavors, plus mango, dank herbal hops, cut grass. Heavenly. There is an intense hop bitterness on the back of each sip that builds up nicely. Don't drink anything light-flavored after this one, you won't taste much. The malt holds up nicely, a bit toasty and sweet on the back end, which is great intermingled with the bitterness.

694,15881,MrKennedy,4.25,"12oz bottle, thanks to Rifugium and pdeepak for this, into a Fantome tulip.  Beautiful glowing light orange look to this with good clarity and a creamy off-white head of foam on top. Some lacing as the foam ever so slowly falls.  Sweet smelling mix of pine and mainly orange that dominates. Orange and candied orange that seems to last forever. Right underneath it all is a little bit of pineapple and mango. Very impressed.  Taste isn't quite as pronounced as the smell. Still it is a mix of pine and pine sap and orange that drives this. Very solid and still very flavoursome.  Slightly oily body, lighter side for 7.5% ABV and a little lighter than you expect. Still keeps it very drinkable, especially with the consistent bitterness throughout.  As an overall package it works extremely well. Super drinkable, lovely to smell and a good solid hop dose to keep you well entertained.

Caramel notes sliver through as well.  T: Solid hop bitter but not over powering, slight citrus, caramel malty backbone. Slight juicy grapefruit with a slight bready after taste. Really fantastic stuff.  M: Medium bodied, juicy feeling, ideal carbonation with a refreshing bitter clean finish. Slight sweetness lingers on the palate.  O: Fantastic beer that lives up to the hype and delivers some interesting unique flavors. Imperial HOPPY amber would be a better category. More toned down sweet American Strong Ale.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Mertzy81,4.28,Appearance: translucent copper. A nice 1 inch head with great retention and lacing. If you served my an imperial amber this would be the standard for appearance. Not sure what could possibly be improved upon. It is what I thought it was.  Smell: strong hop aroma. Very light citrus. I love hoppy beers but really don't like the pine aromas/tastes that are making their way into so many brews these days. The absence of any pine aroma is a big time plus for me. Again the aroma sets the bar for me in this style. I'm nitpicking but just a little something extra to give more complexity would be nice.  Taste: strong hop characteristic but not overpowering. Slight citrus notes in middle and finish. Very balanced hop profile throughout. Bitter finish but again not overpowering. Just a great well balanced hop flavor. Again I'm nitpicking but maybe a little something to give more complexity would be nice. But this is just a great straight forward hoppy amber. Just executes its simplicity to perfection.  Mouthfeel: light and refreshing. Great for welcoming in spring. The hips and bitterness leave your mouth tingling wanting more.  Just a great simple hoppy amber. Executes the style perfectly. Great to see a brewery executing with simplicity rather than just making crazy brews that don't work.

Floral, fruity, and slightly earthy hops with a light caramel sweetness from the malts. Also get a light crackery pepper in the background from the malts  M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation  O: Definitely a top-tier amber ale. Nice and hoppy with a nice balance of maltiness.

The foamy off white 2 finger head stuck around for a long time leaving a huge amount of lacing behind. The clarity on this beer is stunning actually.  Smell: Resinous, oily pine hop greets the nostrils first with a slight touch of grapefruit. There is a sweetness in the background reminiscent of caramel and a bit of light toasted malts.  Taste: Pine hop hits the front of the tongue first with its bitterness and I do get some of the citrus notes (grapefruit) also. It is bitter but not overly bitter since the amber ale qualities even things out with a slight sweet caramel and malty finish. It finishes very dry actually and leaves the palate ready for the next sip.  Mouthfeel: Medium and sticky with a moderate level of carbonation. Like noted in the taste it has a very drying finish making it highly drinkable.  Overall: Nice easy drinking balanced beer.

Feel: Smooth, perfect thickness for what it is. Not watery, but not thick. It works well for this beer. Its not quite a sipper, but rather a slower drinking beer. Overall: A well made beer. There are some similarities between this and SN Torpedo I like this better, but I taste similarities. I am happy to have tried this again. The last time I tried it was a couple of years ago.

694,15881,KajII,3.93,"[Suggested Glassware: Tulip Glass]  The pour was a clear medium burnt orange with an average (1-2 finger) off white rocky head that slowly receded, down to a puddled film and medium collar with good spotty lacing.  The aroma was right up front with a bold hoppiness (pine, citrus and floral) along with a light grain malt and a soapy yeast with notes of caramel, citrus (grapefruit) and a pronounced fruity ester (pineapple and apple).  The taste was lightly malty with a mild caramel sweetness and a hint of citrus at first, and then became intensely hoppy with a huge grapefruit presence and a slight fruitiness appearing towards the finish. The flavor lasted a very long time after the swallow, with a bitter citrus peel hoppiness lingering on for quite a while longer.  Mouthfeel was just past light in body with a dry texture and a carbonation that was just beyond soft.  Overall I found this to be a really fantastic Amber Ale with a ton of flavor and an extremely smooth and easy drinkability, which did a great job of hiding all notion of the high ABV.

Smell isn't very strong, but is very sweet. It smells almost like peach (or nectarine to be more appropriate). The bitterness and sweetness are very well balanced here with just a hint of pine aftertaste. Mouth quite smooth and tastes very crisp and refreshing. Not very heavy either. After hearing so much about this ale, I have to agree, this is a great tasting beer. Incredibly different.

694,15881,MadScientist,4.36,"A: A light copper colored beer with great clarity. The persistant head is made of rocky, off-white foam with an orange hue.  S: Moderately strong hops aroma of citrus, pineapple and some resinous pine. The malt brings moderately-light biscuit and caramel aromas. The light alcohol note is foral and soft.  T: Bitter hop bliss on the first sip with a moderately-high hops bitterness and high hops flavors again mostly citrus and pineapple with some pine. A bit of malt character is able to make itself know under all the hops being initially sweet followed by some caramel character. The balance is pretty strongly towards the bitter but there is some malt sweetness for support. The finish is dry with a linger hop bitterness and piney, citrus flavors in the aftertaste. A slight touch alcohol sweetness towards the finish.  M: Medium bodied with a moderately-strong level of carbonation. A slight alcohol warmth in the back of the throat.  O: This beer brings out a huge amount of citrus hops character with more malt character and a bit less bitterness than a typical American IPA and is a go to favorite for the hops lover in me.

Deep, dark, pretty amber-copper tones. This is a great looking beer.  S: Woody-citrus northwest hop aroma and not much else.  T: A surge of grapefruit and pine: tart citrus fading to bittersweet and fresh-cut pine compete for flavor dominance. Soft, smooth and sweet caramel malts follow to balance things out. Finishes clean with long lasting hop bitterness and sweet malt.  M: Tickling carbonation, but nothing too harsh. Crisp and clean with a thin mouthfeel.

694,15881,tectactoe,4.27,"Finally found a pack of these in Toledo - the search is finally over. Pours a sickeningly perfect copper color with crazy-exceptional clarity. A big, foamy, eggshell head posts up on top of the beer and lasts seemingly for days. Amazing traces of lacing on the way down as carbonation bubble streams continuous flow from bottom to top. This beer looks stunning.  The aroma starts off with strong, weedy hops that jump up and spike your nostrils. Resinous, oily, and mildly dank. There is a good amount of caramel malt to be noted, providing a perfectly sound and balanced sweetness to the hoppy bitterness. Biscuits, roses, grass, and toffee are all things I would compare this aroma to. Lots more going on here than you might think from the first whiff. The hops gets stronger and the malts get sweeter - this is starting to make my mouth water.  Nugget Nectar contains an extremely solid, seemingly 50/50 mix of ""bitter hop rush"" and ""sweet malt balance"", right out of the gate - this is a very good sign. The hop profile consists of pine resin, hop oils, slight dankness, and mild grass flavors. The malts are packed with caramel, bread, and mild toffee. The execution of flavor envelopment between ""bitter"" and ""sweet"" is nearly flawless, as each contributor brings a nearly equal amount to the table, making this an unbelievably drinkable beer. After taking several sips, my mouth is left with a leafy resin and heavily soaked bread - once again, in nearly perfect harmony. Medium bodied, carbonated well, slightly sticky and coating to the palate.  There's no denying that this may be one of the best executed ""reds"" or ""amber ales"" out there. Hoppy enough for hop-heads, yet balanced enough for people afraid of D/IPAs. So damn drinkable it's nuts.

694,15881,Jugs_McGhee,4.28,"Thanks to Schlimenhaumer for shipping me this one from New York. Label is predominantly orange. 7.5% ABV confirmed. Brewed with Nugget, Warrior, and Tomahawk hops. 93ish IBUs. 12 fl oz brown glass bottle with branded pressure cap served into a conical Samuel Smith's pint glass in me gaff in low altitude Los Feliz, Los Angeles, California. Reviewed live. Expectations are high given its current ratings. I can't read the bottled-on date; it's smudged.  Served straight from the fridge. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated.  A: Pours a healthy 5+ finger beige-khaki colour head of smooth frothy cream, great thickness, and fantastic retention (5+ minutes) for the high ABV. Body colour is a rich clear vibrant copper; translucent. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show. Light sticky lacing as the head slowly recedes. That's a hell of a head. Looking great for an Imperial Amber; the best I've seen since Alesmith My Bloody Valentine. Soft and appealing. I'm excited to try it. That's fecking gorgeous.  Sm: Evocative floral and nectary hops balanced well by lightly sweet pale malts. Subtle pine and grapefruit. Clean, pleasant, and fresh. I don't get any hop bitterness or signs of imbalance from the aroma. A bit of spicy character, actually. Light toasted malt. Some oily hop character. Juicy citrus. Quite appealing, all around. No yeast character or alcohol comes through. A fairly strong aroma. I'm impressed.  T: Juicy citrus with light grapefruit very well balanced by the amber malt/toasted malt backbone. Sugary in the third act. It's nectary indeed, evoking bright fruits and soft floral goodness. Light subtle spiciness; it doesn't seem to be from the yeast though. In any case, it's well integrated and betrays a masterful complexity often unseen in any hoppy beer style - let alone an Imperial Amber. I get some restrained kisses of orange peel. A bit of tangerine. Estery and clean. Very pleasant to drink. The balance is fantastic. Light caramel malt is subtly worked in. The sweetness/bitterness balance is near perfect for my tastes. Juicy grapefruit and evocative pine are dominant. I love it.  Mf: Soft, smooth, and wet. Juicy and chewy. A touch oily. Refreshing. Carbonation is almost ideal; right on the money for the style. None of the bite or sharpness of inferior Imperial Ambers.  Dr: Obscenely drinkable for the high ABV; I could down this one all night. The ABV is very well hidden. I'm a big fan. I've heard this is inexpensive and widely available in New York; how fantastic. Probably the best Imperial Amber I'll ever hope to have. This is a style definer for me. Lives up to the hype. This would be a staple if I was lucky enough to live in a region where it's distributed.  Low A  *** 02/06/17: Living in NYC, I had to pick up 2 sixers based on my memory of how good this stuff was and how high my previous rating is...even though the best price for it in the city is $13.99 per 6 pack (at Whole Paycheck). Brief impressions below from revisiting it via the 2017 batch:  Pours a vibrant gold with a reddish tint and a healthy frothy head, amber malts tempered by pale malts in what looks like a fusion of an amber ale proper and an IPA.  Aroma hints at resin and onion, implicating simcoe. Vague fruits are in there too couched in the sweetness of amber and pale malts, suggesting a more biscuity heartier hoppy ale than you'd find in an IPA - and a hoppier beer than you'd expect of a traditional amber ale. Nectary is a good word for it, with sticky resins abound. A blip of bubblegum phenol indicates additional yeast-derived flourish. A complex aroma promising a balanced yet approachable and somewhat unique imperial amber ale. If I'm nitpicking, I suppose it could be still more fresh and expressive, but this aroma makes me eager for the first sip. Aromatic intensity is moderate.  TASTE & TEXTURE: How I didn't find the oily pine in the aroma is beyond me, but it fuses brilliantly with the amber malt backbone in the taste. Oniony simcoe is there too, along with a hug of floral and resinous hop flavours. Hop oils meet amber malts and the result is a lovely harmony of flavour with more body and nuance than most IPAs or amber ales...this is a true imperial amber, and may be one of a kind.  Highly drinkable for the ABV.  *** 02.23.17  With some age (a scant 2 weeks), this drops to a mere B. Current rating reflects this beer when fresh.  I'm not a huge freshness-obsessive like many out there, but this beer in particular seems to succumb rather quickly.

It has a great copper color, and a thick white head that leaves lacing like beaten egg whites.  It smells like a pineapple upside-down cake. Seriously, I can't think of anything else. It's bready and yeasty and has a ton of pineapple aroma. Maybe it's missing some carmelized sugar notes, but otherwise, I just want to eat that cake. But I hold back, and there's some vegetal hoppiness, too. Good thing, because I did not want a repeat of 5 Golden Rings.  This tastes pretty damned good. The carbonation is soooo soft, and there is none of the sweetness I expected. There's a tiny amount of caramel in the malt, and a hint of roast, but it's surprisingly light and quaffable.

Aroma is earthy, floral hops, a little citrus, a little pine, caramel and some fruit. Good, but not great strength.  Flavor is nice hops up front with citrus, pine, resinous hops, really nice bitterness, then moves on to more traditional Amber Ale qualities of some fruity malt and caramel. Finishes with more good bitterness and some sweetness, mild alcohol.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, oily, moderate to good carbonation.  Quite good, aroma is a little underwhelming, and frankly I don’t find this to be God’s gift to hopheads like some do, but still a real treat to get to try this.

This flavor of this beer basically is hoppy with a citrus side to it. I like the idea but honestly I wish that the citrus flavor was dialed back just a bit. Both the strong bitterness from the hops and acidity from the citrus flavor is a bit too complex. At 93 IBUs it doesn't really need as much citrus that is in it. I'm not sure if it's from the hops or if they added orange peel or coriander. It's complex enough where it won't pair well with too many foods because all the different flavors will clash.

694,15881,RichD,4.54,"Poured this into my perfect pint glass.  A: Pours an amber color as it should. About a finger and a half of sudsy head. Not bad  S: Smells of grapefruit, citrus and piney hops are the prominent scents in here. Not overpowering, it's actually a little faint.  T: The grapefruit, citrus and piney hops are what I taste first. And then some caramel malty goodness come right in. Holy hell, what balance this has. This is some awesome stuff. The effortless transition from hops to malts make this beer incredibly enjoyable.  M: Medium bodied beer with such a smooth feel. This drinks kind of like a lager. This has a medium level of carbonation which is perfect for a brew like this. Good stuff.  Overall: This is one of few imperial ambers I've ever had and this is definitely the best in it's style. Troegs has done an incredible job with this beer. This will be a yearly staple in my fridge every February. Good shit Troegs.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

O - Nugget Nectar is reminiscent of the Sierra Nevada Torpedo...because of the dry-hopping? It's a delicious brew which, if served very cold, the hop flavors become metallic. So, be patient.

Lots of pine and some citrus. You can smell the hops.  As expected, carbonated mouth feel.  Quite bitter for an amber ale. Exceptionally hoppy and imbalanced for an amber ale.  Definite citrus, pine, cradled in hops. The hops and the bitterness overwhelmed the citrus and pine.  I was expecting more. I really like the beer from this brewery, especially the Flying Mouflan.

That beautiful amber glow shows a little bit of alcohol legs where it touches the glass.  S - Big grapefruit, citrus, and pine notes up front with a hint of caramel maltiness and a bit of booze on the back end. Not as intense of an aroma as I was expecting after pouring it out. But when I first cracked open the bottle I could smell the beer with it a foot from my nose. Impressive.  T - WOW! Huge grapefruit and pine notes up front. Getting a mix of citrus flavors mid way through. The slightest taste of caramel malts is there, but only VERY slightly. Hops, hops and more hops for the big flavors.  M - Bitter and dry finish on this one. The booziness that I could smell is non existent. Every sip leaves you wanting more. Very solid.  O - Best beer I have had in 2013 so far.

694,15881,Dirte1096,3.35,"A - Copper/amber in color...like burnt honey. Minimal head and not much lacing on the glass.  S - Pretty underwhelming. Hop-forward for an amber ale. Sweet juicy hops. Some mango, peach, pineapple...your typical tropical fruit hops. Strong malt backbone to this one...very sweet caramel/molasses malts coming in distinguishing this imperial amber from the IPA category.  T - Follows the nose. Citrus hops up front...grapefruit and lemon...followed by the juicy hop flavors of mango, peach, and pineapple...maybe a touch of pine. Then the malts kick in with a strong molasses/caramel-type sweetness. Very sweet on the finish. I think Troeg's marketing division is taking alot of liberty claiming that this beer is in the ""93ish IBU"" range. Good but pretty underwhelming just like the nose.  M - Medium body with low carbonation. Wouldn't mind a little more carbonation to liven up this beer a bit.  O - Man, this beer has a strong following where I live (Philly). People around here wet their pants when this beer is about to release and buy it up by the case as soon as it hits the shelves. I just don't understand the hype. There's also alot of confusion about the style when people rate this beer...it's not an IPA; it's an imperial amber ale. If it was an IPA it would have a hard time holding its own with the better IPA's out there, but because it belongs to a completely different category it fairs pretty well considering there aren't a ton of good, hoppy ambers out there...at least compared to how many good hoppy IPA's exist. It's good...not in the same league as Lagunitas Lucky 13, but it's still a good imperial amber...nothing more. If you like the style, or if you like extremely balanced IPA's you will like this. Just don't buy into the hype...it's nowhere near one of the best beers out there.

694,15881,gr0g,4.59,"Coppery-amber and slightly hazy. Poured a two finger head with above average retention, leaving a nice unbroken lace ring around the glass. Divinely hoppy aroma, bursting with citrus rind (orange, lemon) and mango notes. A little bit of piney/grassy aroma lurks in the background.  Big IBUs hit the palate at first. Pronounced bitterness, again with citrus rind coming to mind. There's a solid malt presence lurking underneath, bigger than many IPAs of this strength. The combination of malty sweetness and bitter, tropical citrus is excellent, yielding a near perfect balance between the two. Lots of hop oils and a moderately soft carbonation hit the mark precisely in terms of mouthfeel. No booziness at all on the way to a crisp, bitter finish.  The classification of Nugget Nectar as an ""amber"" is a bit suspect, as the raw IBUs and apparent bitterness put in squarely in the IPA camp. This is both quite hoppy and yet very well balanced, and while that's a pretty contradictory statement, Nugget Nectar seems to defy logic. Regardless of what you call it, it's one of the tastiest hoppy beers out there and must be tried.

Massive grape fruit, pine and tropical fruit notes with hops that give a delectably intense and smooth flavor. This is a yearly mass produced contribution to the beer world. It is not bitter like some ipas and way smoother than most . It is extremely drinkable and undeniably delicious .

It crushes 99% of ipas in my opinion and is one of my favorites ( still not a hop fan but will drink this all day) .

No date on the bottle, but it just came in, according to the clerk (he complimented my purchase of Sculpin, NN, and 2011 Mokah).  A - pours almost transparent, dark orange from the bottle to dark orange in the glass. Little head on the forced pour, little remains. Nothing too remarkable.  S - good. The hops yield a honey scent mixed with the usual (though unexpectedly subdued) hints of citrus fruit. Smells syrupy.  T - not terribly remarkable, which is surprising given the hype behind this one. The usual players are all there, bitterness on the front giving way to fruity tones (bitter ones, however), but there's something unpleasant about the aftertaste. Something clings, but I can't quite put my finger on it. Maybe I need one more.  M - good. Not overly carbonated, well-balanced in terms of alcohol and hops. Points off for the lingering taste though, which I can only attribute to a viscous consistency.  O - NN is a good beer, but I'm not sure it's worth the craze.

694,15881,Maxwell,4.17,"The beer pours a super clean candied light amber, even bordering on orange a little. The head sits at a nice fingers’ width with creamy tight bubbles, which help to make this beer appear quite beautiful in the glass. The beer’s body is practically lager clean, letting almost all of the light through the beer and showing a nice lazy stream of bubbles streaming up the beer. The beer’s lacing is thin and slippery, leaving very little to look at, and really not helping the beer’s appearance. On the nose, this beer smells sweet and resiny. Pine dipped in light caramel bursts onto the nose, reminiscent of big IPA’s smells. The malts do get a little too sweet at times, but overall this smell is enticing. On the tongue the beer tastes crisply bitter and sweet. The beer begins with sweet caramel, melding into sweet piney grapefruit, which blossoms over the tongue, briefly hinting at medicinal flavors before pulling it solidly into resiny pine hops. The finish rings with bready sweet caramel malts, which levels out the beer and brings some balance to the palate, allowing this beer to give a nice big bitter hop bite while still kissing the sweet malts of a traditional amber/red ale. On the mouth, this beer feels thin to medium in body, but clean and crisp, almost like a lager. The mouth is left dry and resiny with a little bit of sweet lingering with saliva in the cheeks of the mouth. Overall, this is a tremendous India Red Ale or whatever you feel fit to call it. I feel like a new style in amber/red ales is coming soon, and this is a beautiful early example of the style. Hoppy like an IPA, yet still sweet and bready on the finish, this beer does some lovely balancing. The bitters do unfortunately hit a place where medicinal aspirin flavors hit the palate, but that fades quickly and doesn’t really downsize the drinkability of this beer. In terms of other India Red Ales, I would note Nugget Nectar as being highly drinkable, and oddly sessionable for its 7.5% ABV.

Anyway, NN is a good beer, one of the best offered by Troegs. If you can get it, you should, it's worth a try, but not what I remember from last year.

694,15881,Cugabuh,4.61,"Just picked this up on February 4th 2013. It was released from the brewery on February 1st, so the hops still have a very nice, fresh character to them.  A: Beautiful amber color. Not hazy at all. I can see right through this red-orange beer and observe anything going in my room through the glass. The 1 finger head tapers off but leaves some nice residual lacing around the glass as you gobble this delicious drink down.  S: The hops are actually tamer than I expected them to be. They are balanced with a sweet, bready maltiness that stands out on the nose.  T: WOWZERS! This is a damn tasty beer! There's a hint of some citrus hops in there, but nothing like your typical centennial/cascade ipa. Instead they add a nice tropical fruity flavor - mango, pineapple, and the likes. This sweetness totally embraces the maltiness and makes a love sesh in your mouth.  M: Some light carbonation that matches well with this fairly light bodied beer (typical amber body). Certainly a chewiness in the beer that lingers for sometime. Your mouth will just be watering for more of this delicious godsend of a brew.  O: My only gripe is that it's not available year round. It's got a sweetness that works in the winter, but a body that could work in the summer. I'd drink this night and day 365 days of the year. It's that damn good.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,BigCheese,4.6,"FINALLY. Been waiting legit 2 years to try this. Grabbed a 6 pack from Redstone for 11.99  A: Pours a clear amber with a thick sandy colored head. Leaves nice lacing.  S; Mix of Grapefruit and Pine/herbal hops. Some caramel/molasses maltiness. overall smells like a C hop IPA.  T: Starts with a mix of grapefruit rind and pineyness. Then a nice smooth malt backbone comes through. Finishes so sweet, pineapple, mango, tropical, kiwi honey, caramel, bubblegum. Lotta different flavors going on. Some herbal/floral bitterness as well. Bitter but so well balanced.  M: A tad syrupy/creamy and a great chew. . Medium to low carbonation. Crazy sessionable, i could hae 4/5 of these without blinking.  O: This is really f-ing good, the finishing flavors are insane. Drinks like a malty IPA, tons of different flavor profiles going on.

T: balanced hop flavor with the malt base, finished dry. M: coats the mouth in a muted resinous deliciousness O: this beer is definitely good. It's my first time having it, with a name like nugget nectar I was expecting a beer with greater hop presence, but then again, it's an amber not an IPA.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

T- You can definitely tell this is an Imperial Amber and not a straight IPA given the strong malt base this beer has. A burst of Nugget, Warrior, and Tomahawk hops give this beer some bite too.  M- A little thin for my liking, but at the same time, given the style, it is quite crisp!  O- Ahh the sweet Nectar... I look forward to it every year... and that is why i buy a few cases.

Smell: Grapefruit and orange dominate with some subtle mango and bready malt. There is also a metallic element to the smell I can't quite put my finger on.  Taste: Malt and subtle caramel blend nicely over some crisp, citrusy hops that are brought to the forefront at the end as the malt profile drops. The ending is a bittersweet finish that is very well balanced, with malt and hops equally evident. My only complaint is the slight metallic aftertaste.  Mouthfeel: Well carbonated and super quaffable, not much lacking here.  Overall: This is a great brew, I just take off minor points for the slightly metallic aftertaste I always seem to get from it that lingers into the finish.

694,15881,Cubatobaco,4.46,"I was preparing for a mind-blowing experience and was only met with mediocrity. Now I say that mostly in jest, but I don't see a 98pt beer in this bottle. Read the review before judging.  I opened the bottle and poured a beautiful amber ale into my DFH signature glass. This has a very little head, but what it does have, retains well around the edge of the glass. There is light lacing with a a good amount of carbonation brewing.  A nose of grapefruit, pine, hops, and sweetness rise out of the glass and tantalizes the senses. There is just something about a hoppy ale that makes me smile. Maybe its the time and art that went into making something so special. I can only imagine the sense of accomplishment the brewer must feel after making a hit like this.  By now my tastebuds are tingling, ready for a treat...almost to the point of salivation. An exuberant amount of bitterness from the hops intertwined with the citrus-like fruit, and hint os metallic make this a delight to sip and enjoy. The carbonation, effervescence, and crispness on the palate leave one asking for another sip.  Overall, this is a classic Amber Ale and one to look forward to during its seasonal release. There are some other ales out there that can satisfy for the time being and in between seasons, but not many. Keep up the good work Tröegs!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

S-Awesome smell that draws you in. Citrus notes of plum, orange/tangerine/clementine rind. Floral earthy notes spread throughout. Very nice blend of aromas in this one!  T-The taste is as good as the smell. Those hop notes break right through. Orange, plum, grapefruit with earth back tones to bring down the citrus forwardness of this brew. Very well balanced with the malt bill. The hops come in than they are followed by the caramel, sourdough bread crust that blend beautifully together. Finishes slightly bitter and leaves a great aftertaste.  M-The body could have a little more depth to it. A little thinner than I would like for this style. Well carbonated. You can feel the carbonation on your tongue after you have taken a sip.  O-An excellent beer by an excellent brewery. The aroma and taste of this beer is great. Only real complaint about this beer is that I wish it was around 5% abv so I could drink more of these!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,thlayli87,4.48,A - Pours amber with a 3-4 finger off white head. Very fluffy with excellent retention and lacing. This is a beautiful beer.  S - Mostly pine and grapefruit hop aromas.  T - Bready Malts then an explosion of citrus and tropical fruit flavors hits the palate. Nice bitter hoppy finish. Persistent malty sweetness in the background.  M - Fairly light body; crisp and refreshing.  O - A fantastic beer all around.,Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Smell: Caramel sweetness that startes and carries the nose. Some nice grapefruit and pine. Some dank floral hoppiness (read: weed).  Taste: Big pine and grapefruit, followed by an even bigger caramel sweetness. Some bread. Finishes with a floral hoppiness, pine, and caramel  Mouthfeel: Pretty bitter, but more sticky sweet than a hop assault. Finishes bitter. Quite drinkable nonetheless.  Overall: About what I expected.

694,15881,danfisher1,4.84,"12 ounce bottle poured into tulip glass  Appearance: Poured vigorously into tulip glass yielding a three finger head that dissipated quickly leaving extensive lacing that is lingering two minutes after pour. The beer is dark amber and is crystal clear. Head is off white and has now settled to a slim film.  Smell: Intense hop character with four different varietals working to create a sweet cherry aroma. On the exhale you can sense a distinctness that would suggest a funky characteristic strong with strong simcoe notes, And acidity from the warrior hops with an old gymnasium smell in a good way.  Taste: Prost! Hop bitterness upfront with pitted fruits. Plums, peaches and ripe mangoes. Juicy tropical notes. Slight rosemary notes. Sweet maltiness. The balance between sweet and bitter has been achieved.  Mouth feel: There is no sense of alcohol content. Like drinking pineapple orange juice. Dangerously drinkable.  Overall: The balance between the grain bill and hops is amazing. You may say that this beer is aggressively balanced. This is not considered an India pale ale because of the amber like grain bill, but if it was it would be my favorite due to the balance.

694,15881,tstinz01,4.7,"A: typical copper color for amber. Solid head and lacing. S: hop forward for an amber, but this is an imperial. More like a hybrid. T: hops continue from smell to taste, malt balances very nicely though. Little hint of true ABV. Floral notes balanced. M: dry, but not overly. Quenching. O: bought from brewery, so fresh as can be (16 days from bottle to glass). Understand the hype. Call it an amber, call it an ipa, no matter. I call it a must try.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,wiegs4life,4.23,"I chose to purchase this beer because it has a lot of hype lately. But as I am learning fast is that I generally do not have the same taste buds as the majority. The hops in this beer are very overpowering, but as with most imperials that is the point. The smell of this beer is immaculate though, which is my favorite aspect of the beer as you can see in my ratings.  A - The dark orange beer poured with an impressive head.  S - It has a quite intoxicating (pun intended) smell of sweet citrus.  T - Very hoppy, with bitter/sweet after taste. Like a lot of the imperials, the taste was harsh tasting. I feel as though if I didn’t brush my teeth or eat anything for the next couple days I could still have the taste in my mouth.  M – Please pardon me as I do not fully understand how to distinguish how good a particular beer feels in my mouth. It could be because i’m young, but almost every crafted beer felt great in my mouth. This beer was no different  O – I found this beer to be good. I doubt I would ever purchase it again, but I would enjoy drinking again.

Moderate lace.  Delicious, enticing hops bombard the nose, with some sweet, caramel malts balancing it out. Just an amazing smelling beer.  Some sweet, caramel and bready malts hit the palette first, but are swiftly replaced by citrus (juicy pineapple, mango, a little lemon zest) and earthy, grassy hops that dance on the tongue. Finishes with a slight pine bitterness but also a little more sweet malt. The hops linger after each sip.  Great mouthfeel that is both crisp and creamy, with moderate carbonation. Slightly dry finish.  By far my favorite amber ale out there, and this beer could compete with some of the big boy IPA's out there too.

Bitter, clean, slightly tart even. M - off-dry with proper carbonation. Standard fare for a solid IPA even though this calls itself an imperial amber.

Smells of sweet biscuit malt, faint bitter citrus, faint sweet fruit.  Tastes similar--too much malt, some hop bitterness but only faint citrus.  Nice mouthfeel, pretty creamy but could use a little more carb.  I was disappointed in this beer the first time I had it a couple years ago, I'm disappointed again this time...there just isn't that much hop presence and way too much maltiness, I don't see what the fuss is about.

It is a bit more dark than your standard Double IPA (or in this case Imperial Amber, if there is a difference).  The smell is very hoppy. Traditional non west IPA smell that doesn't have that piny smell. Very clean and strong.  The taste is just perfect. Kind of a sweet hoppy taste that is as smooth as you can get. The great thing about imperials is that is so easy on the taste buds, doesn't burn them out and minimal hoppy lingering. Absolutely perfect.  Overall, this is an outstanding beer. I'd put this up there with the best of the best in this category. As a side note, this perhaps is the best beer in the world to eat with a spicy buffalo wing.

Taste is fruity, fresh, juicy, oily, lightly sweaty, lots of melon and mango peel. Softly bitter. No dry bitterness and no astringency. Simple, fresh, fruity.

The head dissipated pretty quickly, leaving some lacing. No worries there.  S: Lots of hop aroma! Is this truly an ""amber"" style beer or a solid IPA? Mostly sweet (and lovely) citrus notes, along with some piney characteristics. A nice bit of maltiness in there as well.  T: A perfect marriage of hoppy and malty deliciousness. The hops kick right away, but then the malt backbone arrives to balance it all out. Hops taste mostly of pine and some ripe grapefruit. A little bitterness on the back end.  M: Medium body with nice tight compact bubbles. The carbonation is a little much for my liking.  O: I love this beer!! I really wish Tröegs was available in NC.

Malt presence is higher than expected, but this bottle is getting old (so hard to read the black-ink best buy when there is beer in the bottle!). In any event, the malt smell is very nice.  The burnt caramel flavour is prominent in the taste as well. Some citrus (grapefruit) and tropical (mango) fruit flavours are present, and a bit of a grassy flavour. Mildly bitter. This is a nice beer, but I fear the hops have faded a fair bit. Impressive that it is this good considering.  Medium bodied, moderate carbonation. A bit oily.

Nose: Juicy pineapples cooked in parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme. These distinct herbal notes really pair well with the sweet hops. There's a biscuit backbone underneath.  Taste: Herbs are up front again to set the palate for a sticky, sweet candied pineapple taste and a nicely balanced biscuity finish. It's fairly complex, but the hops seem more dialed down than the first time I tried it last year.  Mouthfeel: Nice and sticky.

Unfortunately, over the years I have noticed a steady deterioration in quality and now it is just an average beer. At first I thought the decline might have been due to a poor hop harvest that year, but the decline in taste continued year after year.

694,15881,Lawl3ss,4.77,"Lightly chilled 12 oz. bottle into a stemmed tulip. The last of twelve very thoughtfully muled to Texas four months ago. Bottling date 2.20.12.  Look- Crystal clear strawberry amber with three fingers of tight off-white head, falls after a few minutes. Sticky, ropy lacing.  Smell- Even now, the smell of tangerine, mango, and sweet melon is bold. Caramel and toast, semi-sweet and dry, like floured toffee. Has some bite, fruity and floral. Certainly not as aromatic as it once was, but complex and extremely appealing nonetheless.  Taste- Mmm-mmm. Excellent. I don't know how they do it, but this beer actually makes me drool. Exceptional hop flavor without being excessively bitter. Starts with a fruity, juicy splash of mango and lime, followed by a multi-hued malt assault, with the two going back and forth in turns and becoming bolder as the beer warms. Finishes with a bit of sweetness, dry toast, and orange zest. Aftertaste is resinous, sweet and bitter at once. Pine not as dominant as I recall. Faintest hint of oxidation, which is my own fault for waiting so long. Exceptionally well balanced.  Mouthfeel- Smooth, medium-full body, drinks like juice. Vague notion of warming on the swallow, just enough to let you know that it's 7.5%. Mildly drying, smooth, clean feel. Straddles the fine line between refreshing and hearty, and does it well.  Overall- I'm not one to give a beer even one 5, but this one deserves it; it was one of the first brews to really wow me, and hasn't ever let me down. With what I know now, it's even more impressive- every element in balance, it's the Zen of the amber ale. Fresh, half a year old, on tap, growler, whatever- it stands a cut above. For those of you in areas where it's a shelf beer in the Spring, consider yourself lucky and hope that Troegs doesn't start charging what they should for this nectar.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,qcbrewer,4.57,"While I've had this fine brew in bottles for a few years now, I've not had this on draft before tonight (at Rattle N Hum in NYC). This is a classic beer in my book, a textbook hop blast, and I look forward to picking up a case of this each year in my hometown of Blacksburg, Va (at the great Vintage Cellar).  The appearence is a beautiful ruby red with a finely carbonated white head, which in my case poured a little thick off the tap. The aroma knocks your nose back away from the glass with hops and it's possible you might be able to detect the abv in a few sniffs. What comes from your first sip is a full throttled hop experience that seems pleasurably wet hopped and malty at first which then receeds to a dryer body, and then finishes with a very thick after taste that will stay with you for a while. The lacing resembles that of spray can fake Christmas snow frosting on windows, while a slim ring of foam persists throughout the experience. The mouthfeel is solid and there isn't a hint of a watered down feeling.  Once again this is a classic to me that should be tried by all hop heads.

There is also just enough of an alcohol presence to let you know you have a potent beer in your hand.  Not only is this the best amber ale out there, but this may be the beer that is the most head-and-shoulders above any other of its style.  February 2016 update. Sampled a can that was pretty much dead on one month old. Since this was my first canned experience with NN, I decided to give it the Heady treatment and drink directly from the can. The result was that the citrus notes and the hop bitterness really came out front. I might just go out and get a whole case of cans.  January 2019 update: Picked up a sixer that was bottled just two weeks before. It reminded me how lights out this offering is when super fresh.

I can also find sweet cookies from the malts. Dried fruit at the end. Wonderful!  T: The taste is hoppy up front. I find the taste to be more towards oranges, apricots and pine than grapefruit. There is some toffee somewhere in the middle of the sip. It is also quite spicy and herbal at the end.  M: Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Feels smooth and wonderful to drink.

Smells of nugget through and through.  Flavor is hop punch up front. Popping with citrus mixed with piney flavor. Hops wash over the palate throughout. Slightly drying at end.  Mouthfeel is perfect for style. Carbonation also is appropriate.  Overall, this may be my favorite IPA. And I am a huge Stone fan, so this says a lot. Highly recommended.

Smell is up front with pine and citrus. The flavor is certain hop forward. The trio of hops used certainly is potent. But it's not overwhelming, which I enjoyed. There was a sweetness from the malt that gave a nice counterbalance to the tartness of the hops. Pretty smooth on the palate for such a hoppy beer, over 7% no less.

A strong bitterness takes hold just as the malt begins to make an appearance. Some toffee and caramel that definitely let you know this is an amber ale.

A- Perfect 1-finger off-white head that fades into a perfect sheet that lasts to the very end of the glass, crystal-clear red-amber body. Minimal spotty lacing. Only thing you could improve on here is the lacing, a near-perfect appearance.  S- Beautiful hop aroma, fruity with some pine, slightly floral. Slightly sweet & malty. Not an incredibly strong aroma but very pleasing and persistent/lasting. Near the end of the glass as it warm there is a slight bit of alcohol present but not enough to be a turn-off. More malt also comes out as it warms.  T- Moderate bitterness. Piney hops that fade into a citrus/grapefruit pith bitterness. There is a small amount of caramel malt hidden in the background struggling for recognition. Some pale malt lingers in the aftertaste. As it warms, it becomes more balanced as more maltiness begins to emerge.  M- A slight diacetyl-type slickness on the lips. Moderate-high carbonation. Medium thickness. The slickness may actually be from the hop oils but either way it isn't all that appealing.  O- Definitely drinks more like an American IPA than an American Amber which is a good thing for me as I'm not real big on Ambers. The slick mouthfeel was kinda weird and I hope it's just an issue with this batch and not a continuing problem with Troegs. If there is diacetyl present, the large amount of hops cover it up in the aroma & taste and you only get it in the mouthfeel. Overall, a really great beer and reasonably priced!

Taste is sweet malt up front with some initial grapefruit bitterness that goes into a more complex lighter fruit note before ending on a sweet, crystal malt and slightly bitter finish. Really well integrated flavors that create a unique beer.  Medium body and medium to lower carbonation works well. The alcohol is present but not overwhelming.  Great malty and hoppy beer that lives up to whatever praise it receives.

Mouthfeel: Oily, slick with a fairly thin mouthfeel. Not bad, but lacking the carbonation and body of high end offerings.  Overall: This is an average offering overall. Sort of an amped up version of Hopback that just doesn't do much for me. Too much pine and bitterness without the flavor to support it. Perhaps I would enjoy it more if it hadn't been as hyped up.

Look: Poured a deep reddish orange color. Had a semi-clear consistency with a thin coating of off-white bubbles that dropped to a patchy film. Carbonation level was not all that high.  Smell: Aroma was very sweet notes of mango and kiwi. A faint pine resin was mixed in there somewhere. This beer had a very juicy nose.  Taste: The carbonation came alive in the first sip. First was a fruity boquet of tripical fruits. Then a quick bitterness set in and completely overpowered the fruit. An earthy biscuit took over in the finish and lead into another round of bitterness mixed with an almost grapefruit sourness in the aftertaste.  This was a nice brew from Troegs. For only living 30 minutes away from the brewery, this offering is actually hard to find.

The body is so very clean, but some bubbles dance a bit right below the foam. Nice preliminary lacing, which doesn't quite hold up throughout the experience. Very good feature, overall.  S: A sweet caramel hoppy aroma. Like something you'd smell in a candy store - candied fruits. Some definite spice in there -- maybe cloves. Almost a perfect smell.  T: A quality caramel malt flavor that gives way to a hoppy punch before leaving a slightly bitter finish. Hop punch is not overwhelming, though. Very refreshing. Crisp. No booziness. Super quality.  M: Medium body feel. A nice medium to light carbonation that let's the flavor stand above all else. Nothing bad here -- I'd say it's good -- but nothing that stands out as special really.  O: This brew is wonderful. Drank quite few before reviewing, and this beer definitely grew on me. It's a yearly buy for sure.

694,15881,cmq103,4.11,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Duvel Belgian Tulip glass. I just picked up a case of this a few weeks ago from the local Joe Canals. This highly anticipated seasonal wasn’t displayed for sale on the floor. I had to ask for it by name to see if it was in stock. Now I’m going to sit back and enjoy & rate this fine selection.  Appearance: A semi-aggressive pour yielded a nice ½” beige head that really stuck to the side of my glass. It poured a dark reddish amber color with some tight cling lacing as I tilt my glass. So far, so good.  Smell: Mildly sweet citrus and floral hops come to mind right away, following with hints of caramel and malt. Very mild grapefruit-pine middle, but not overwhelming in any sense. Actually it’s kind of light on the nose.  Taste: Sweet floral-citrusy hops with a moderate pine bite, followed by an equally as sweet malt backbone. This is just an extremely well-balanced beer. Bitterness shows briefly before taking a backseat to the malty sweetness. I’m very surprised how well they hide the 7.5% ABV.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth and creamy for a beer that briefly stings the tongue with hoppy bitterness then cleans it up with sweet malts. Mild carbonation with a moderate body, blended with the aforementioned flavors, make each sip very much welcomed. 7.5% ABV, where the heck did they hide it??  Overall: Top shelf in my opinion. This American Amber has me coming back for more every year. This beer is a “big brother” to their Hopback Amber, which is also a mighty fine beer. I just wish I could get the Nugget Nectar in a 1/6th keg, as it would clearly make me and the dual-tap basement bar kegerator quite happy. If you can find it, go buy yourself a case before it’s all gone until next year. Rest assured you won’t be disappointed. I know I made a wise choice!!

694,15881,jegross2,4.1,"Reviewing the Nugget Nectar from Tröegs Brewing Company. Score: 91  Batch #120117. Bottled 02/06/12, served in a Half Ace tulip and enjoyed on 04/12/12. A hearty thank you to Joseph over at ProperHops for sending me this brew. You can check out Joseph's YouTube video reviews by clicking here.  Appearance: Pours a translucent orange-amber color with just under a finger of creamy cream colored head that settles to a thin layer. Above average lacing and average retention. 4/5  Smell: Piney hops, nutty malt, walnut, toffee, caramel, grapefruit and barley. The citrus and hops aroma is a lot more muted than expected. Very malty aroma, but in a pleasant way. 4/5  Taste: Strong mix of malty caramel, barley and piney hop oils. Layering bitter grapefruit and lemon. Earthy nut flavor on the midpalate and back half. Residual spice. There are a lot more hops in the taste then in the nose. Lingering lemon, nut and barley finish. Nugget Nectar is similar to Zoe in that it’s an IPA-like amber, but I think I preferred Zoe more. Not sure how much of that preference has to do with the fact that this bottle is just over two months old, however. 4.25  Mouthfeel: Medium-light bodied with carbonation on the higher end (but not overcarbonated). The carbonation makes the bitterness of the hops perky on the tongue. Very oily and smooth mouthfeel. Malty, bitter and modestly dry finish. 4/5  Overall: Quite tasty, but I imagine this is even better fresh. I will have to revisit this one in 2013. Best described as a nutty and malty IPA. This is one of only two amber ales (the other being Zoe) that I have ever truly enjoyed. I imagine that I would also like Brian Boru and Ginger Twin.  Recommendation: Casual beer drinkers are less likely to enjoy this one, but beer geeks should seek this beer out when it’s fresh.  Pairings: Gruyere cheese  Cost: $12-14 for a six pack.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

It's super drinkable and very well balanced, but still manages to pack a big, delicious hop flavor. As a result, it's quite the challenge to stop after having just one.

694,15881,ThisWangsChung,4.49,"Re-reviewing this one. 12 oz bottle into a pint glass.  A: Pours a lighter copper color. The head is a two finger pale yellow shade. I love how creamy the head looks in particular. Retention is pretty solid, and lacing is plentiful.  S: Well this bottle is over two months old, so the big grapefruit notes have faded somewhat, replaced with tons of caramel malt. Right now, I'd say it's a 3.5 - but of memory of fresher bottles, I'll give it a 4.5.  T: Obviously, the hop qualities aren't going to be the best here due to the age. But, they still exist in a decent capacity. Grapefruit opens the flavor profile, while the finish is pure caramel malt. A distant aftertaste of pine, black pepper, and toffee also shows up. The trump card here is the balanced finesse - no, it doesn't have the enchanting hop profile of some other IPAs, rather it features superb hop/malt integration. Just amazing.  M: I really like the balance between sweet and dry here on the finish. Many times, IPAs loaded with crystal malt create a rough palate; this has a softness to it most (really, just about all of them) lack. It goes down easily enough, to be sure.  O: Honestly, I know why this has a few detractors - it doesn't have a shouty hop personality, fresh or otherwise. Rather, it features a degree of elegance just about unheard of in the style (whether it be IPA or imperial amber). Hands down, still the best amber ale on the planet.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,rawfish,4.31,"Thanks to my man younger35 for hooking this up as an extra!  Pours a dark copper amber hue with good clarity, Forms a two finger head of parchment that steadily rises before settling with average retention. Attractive rings of lacing around the glass.  Kinda of faint, a definite toffee and bready malt character here. Hops are a little muddled with orange juice, dank pine and grapefruit, syrupy as well.  Solid malt backing of toasted bread and honey dough. Hops throw me for a loop, I heard that it was hoppy but it's chalk full of oily and resinous hops that have some grapefruit in the initial drink but really gets you in the finish, coating the mouth with pine resin and a steady bitter stick.  Medium bodied and with adequate carbonation. Dries really well but keeps the flavor and bitterness of the hops for what seems like forever. Though very hoppy in the delivery the drink remains balanced and easy with alcohol really well hidden.  This beer could pass as a good/solid DIPA but as an amber it's top of the class. Drinkable and sessionable in it's construction and wonderfully hopped. Such a greatly crafted brew with a well deserved following.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,4thelvofbeer,4.53,"I gotta say, this is a good beer! I never heard of this beer before until a couple months ago when a guy at my local beer store recommended it. It had just come in and they had a whole pallet, so I picked up a six-pack (I need to go pick up a case!). I am drinking my fourth or fifth beer now (over a one week period):  A: Needed to give this one a 5. I know 5s are hard to earn, but the appearance...a deep peachy, golden amber, almost red-colored beer with a nice coppery head.  S: (smelling the glass I just poured) clean, super-fresh, hoppy, really nice  T: So very smooth, a nice bitterness from the hops, but not over-the-top, a smooth bitterness (if there is a such a thing!!), that mellows out before a sweet finish  M: See above...smooth  O: An extremely drinkable beer, fresh, cold, really nice overall!!

And are those strawberries in there? Anyway, I have a feeling that this will be a very bitter and malty beer.  T: Not a hop bomb, but it's got quite a bit of bitterness and too much caramel flavor to balance it out. That bready strawberry flavor from the nose is in there, as well, but it's not great. Not my cup o' tea (or mug of beer). Unsophosticated and doesn't hide its alcohol well.  M: Heavy body. Not drinkable.  O: I'm going to take a couple more sips and then pour it out.

Light lacing remains throughout drinking.  S: Very light sweet scent, definitely getting pine and toffee, with a hint of citrus. Unfortunately, it's a very light scent, I'd like it to be more powerful upfront.  T: Malt and sweetness upfront, with the pine and citrus hoppy notes finishing it off. Love the mid/end notes, but the upfront sweetness is slightly too strong for me. Definitely balances a bit as it warms, which turns it from something I'd pass on in the future to a really good beer, but I'd like a little more balance.  M: Great carbonation and smooth throughout. Definitely drinks well.  O: I'm mixed. I want the flavor slightly more balanced, but then again, it's not a DIPA. It drinks like one, looks like one, and so I expect those characteristics. I definitely enjoy it. It's so close to a DIPA I find myself wishing it WAS one, but once I get past that, I really like it for what it is.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Some orange and hops are in there as well, but the toffee dominates. To be honest, the nose is off-putting to me. I hope it tastes better than it smells.  T: Again, toffee on the front end here. Huge piney, resinous hops follow it up. There is a very strong grapefruit presence here, too. The toffee flavor is really lingering for me, and I just don't think it's for me with this brew.  M: Very slick, oily mouthfeel here. The mouthfeel of this is very much like a good double ipa, which I really appreciate. Nice.  O: I had no idea what to expect from this brew. While well-crafted, this brew was just not for me. The toffee presence overpowered all of the other wonderful aromas, flavors, and qualities of the beer, and I just cannot get past it. It really reminded me of a more well-rounded version of Stoudt's Double IPA, which I had similar feelings about. That being said, this was a really well-done brew that has quite a bit going for it.

There is a decided herbal, almost floral flavor as well. After a quick sip or two in succession, there is notable alcohol heat which lingers at the back of my mouth. The finish is fairly clean with just mild bitterness and alcohol.  M: A very smooth and full mouthfeel. Carbonation is soft and mild.  O: A well balanced beer.

Leaves a lot of really cool looking cobweb lacing.    S: A big aroma with lots of citrus in the form of orange, grapefruit, and lemon zest.  This is accompanied by a significant caramel malt sweetness, and some booze.  Very nice.    T: Pretty well balanced from the first sip. The citrus hop presence is noted up front with a big malt sweetness coming in on the backed.  I get notes of orange/tangerine, grapefruit,  and caramel malts. As it warms the piney hop characteristics come out in full force, which I really didn't get on the nose, and they become quite dominant, but being a hop head, I like this.  Good flavor profile, but doesn't quite live up to the nose.  M/D: Smooth, with a low to moderate carbonation, medium bodied, finishes very dry.  Drinkability is very high.  Mouthfeel would be very good, but it leaves an unappealing film in my mouth as I drink.  It almost seems like a dirty glass, but it's not as I am home and just cleaned and rinsed the glass myself.  But that's what it's like, and its very distracting, so I have to dock points for that.    O:  Overall, a real good beer.  As it warms it comes off way more as an IPA than an amber, as the piney hop profile just completely takes over the previous well balanced brew.

But, the nose is misleading–this thing is packed with complexity (though it's still balanced). Bread and sweet malt mix with pine, spices, and orange-and-grapefruit citrus bitterness.

The nose is great with a big hop profile, lots of resinous pine with some faint citrus but the pine and sappy aromas really dominate the aroma. Balancing the hops is a nice amount of caramel malt and some mild breadiness, but the caramel really shines here. The flavors are a bit heavier on the malts, which is not uncommon at all for an amber or red ale, and the caramel malt definitely leaps out right away and is very smooth and rich. Hops aren’t far away and provide some nice bitter sappy flavors and some pleasant juicy flavors, not unlike an nectarine or peach that play with some lighter citrus notes at the finish. The body is big and full, not very carbonated, feels similar to having a beer on cask and goes with the flavors very well.  Verdict: Delicious.

I love this amber ale, perhaps even more that GL's Nosferatu, which I always had considered my favorite Imperial Amber. Smooth, hoppy, flavorful, this is an excellent brew which I highly recommend you try.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

I bought a 6 pack last year and thought I reviewed this but I guess I didn't  A- Clear amber pour with a three finger chunky, soapy large bubbled off white head that leaves huge gobs of lacing everywhere.  S- Huge pine and citrus hops followed by a nice sweet malt backing. There is a slight mango, strawberry in there as well as a really subtle soapy characteristic. It smells exactly how you think that hop on the label would smell.  T- There is a huge hit of citrus and pine with a mango, peach and strawberry sweetness. Chewy caramel and sweet malts rounding everything out.  M- Medium bodied, good carbonation. Slightly chewy.  O- This really is a gem.

694,15881,aorloski,4.03,"Appearance - Pours a beautiful golden amber, about a fingers worth of head, clear, no haze whatsoever.  Smell - Pine, citrus, grapefruit and resins dominate the nose.  Taste - Nice smooth bitterness right up front followed by a nice citra sweetness all wrapped around a nice malty backbone. Good stuff.  Mouthfeel - nice carbonation allows the drink to be light and crisp  Overall - I dont know, last year this beer blew me away, not so much this year. Dont get me wrong this beer if PHENOMENAL but it just goes to show how much a palate can change.

694,15881,brystmar,4.03,"Bottled 3/8/2012.  Amber pour, plenty of head, strong lace and retention. A quick swirl awakens the frothy fury after settling. Fresh, piney hops in the nose. Citrusy fruit peels join the fray.  Strongly (nugget) hopped, still retains the sharp piney flavor profile of an IPA. A touch of sweetness midway through reminds me of citra hops. Good malt backbone initially, but this fades quickly to leave a lingering bitterness with some bite to it. Nice body and feel.  I can see how many would like this, but it's really not for me. Don't dislike it, don't love it. I'm not a hop-head, though I do LOVE citra hops.

T: The hops aren't overwhelming, but provide a nice after taste.  M: Not quite full bodied, but it fills the mouth with a very clean and drinkable flavor.

694,15881,CFHMagnet,4.48,"An aggressive pour yields a finger and a half of sandy colored head over a beautiful copper body. Light lacing noted throughout consumption, and a good ring sticks around as well. Slow but steady stream of bubbles from top to bottom.  Citrus and strong pine hops blend together for an amazing nose. This is backed up with good malt and something sweet, like honeyed fruit.  Malt tries to compete with the hops in the beginning, and the two work really well together, although the hops definitely do a good job of upstaging, especially a very good pine note. Light caramel comes in to help the malt out after a little while. Honey is also very complimentary.  This beer is medium bodied and on the creamy side. Carbonation bites your tongue in the beginning, then helps propel the beverage over the tongue and down the throat.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

694,15881,pgofman,5,This is the best beer ever made. Hoppy and clean. Amber in color but the taste is way more complex.  Have had it on tap but just brought home my reserved case of bottles.

694,15881,deadonhisfeet,4.22,"Saw this at Jungle Jim's in Fairfield, OH. Since I have read a lot about this beer and since we don't get Troegs in Kentucky, I picked up a 6er. Poured from a bottle into a New Belgium tulip. It's a fairly clear pour (slight hop haze) with a beautiful coppery orange color. Not much head, but the nose is awesome! It reminds me a little bit of FFF Zombie Dust, only not quite as strong. It's a wonderful blend of sweet tropical notes; oranges, peaches, and lemons.  The beer has a medium to firm body with a nice semi-sweet malt backbone with a very well-balanced rush of hops at mid-palate. Toast and marmalade comes to mind. The hops aren't very well-sustained towards the back of the palate and the finish, while soft and dry, is a bit disappointing. That's about the only bad thing I can say about the taste. Other than that, this is a fine beer.  I enjoyed this beer, but at $12 per six-pack I was a bit underwhelmed by it. However, if you like IPAs and Amber Ales, then you should definitely give this a try (provided you can get it easily). I'm sure you'll enjoy it. As for me, I probably wouldn't pay $12 for another 6-pack, though I would definitely be willing to try it on tap.  FOLLOW-UP: Over the course of drinking this six-pack, I began to like this beer more and more, especially the way it smells. I will definitely buy it again next year if possible.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

It came to our table with a one finger, beige colored head that faded to a light skim on top. Good amount of sticky lacing left on the glass.  S - The aroma is very IPA-like. Lots of citrus and hops. Smell is very inviting.  T - This is a really good beer. Tons of hop bite with a nice citrus flavor. A nice maltiness as well that gives it a toffee-like sweetness. The hops are dominate but not to the point that the beer is unbalanced . The alcohol is not noticeable.  M - A medium consistency. Lightly carbonated.  O - A top-notch beer.

O: Because I like trying new beers I'm not one to normally buy a six pack of anything; or several for that matter. Troegs Nugget Nectar seems to be one of the few exceptions in my case.

The hops are potent but not in the sweet citrus arena. Instead I get deep sticky resin pine that was mixed with thick dark caramel and two cranks of a pepper mill. I really like that this displays a different end of the hop spectrum than is usually used. The taste is really nice. The thick dark caramel malts really create a solid thick base for the strongly herbal spicy hops to jump off from. The mouthfeel is nice and thick, not quite imperial stout thick, but definitely thicker than anIPA. Overall I really like this unique beer. It feels like a hybrid combining the best elements of a strong amber ale, with the hop forwardness of an IPA. Definitely worth seeking out.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Smells of sweet caramel malts with a good earthy hop bite to balance it out.  Starts out with a strong caramel tinged bread flavor. Strong pine/earth hops take over and more than compensate for the sweetness.  Thick and chewy almost like nectar. Fantastic mouthfeel.

T: A full blend of hops that blankets the tongue. No sharpness to the bite of the hops but an evenly thick bitterness that bluntly covers the taste buds. A delectably sweet malt flavor corresponds well with the power of the hops.  M: A very crisp elegance to the mouthfeel. excellent.  Ov: This is a must-have beer for a hops-lover.

S- note of a sweet biscuity base with citric notes of pineapple, orange, grapefruit, and papaya or passionfruit possibly.  T- the sweet malt bill starts things off, but is quickly balanced by the hop bill. The hops follow the smell and really blend nicely with the syrupy sweetness of the malts. On the end is an almost pilsner like malt taste and bitterness which really throws a complex note on this one. The tastes really have definitive transitions from sweet, to hops, to pilsner like bitterness.  M- Slightly slick, and fairly dry on the end, I really like creamy mouthfeels on imperial ipa's/ambers/red ales, and this one really doesn't have it.  O- a very, very good beer.

694,15881,IPhantom,4.57,"Really, the only bad thing I have to say about this beer is that it should be made year-round. But anyway...  Pours an intriguing true amber with a big, sticky, pillowy head. Gets down to about a finger at its lowest point, with nice even lacing. It's a good-looking beer, but really, that's the only area in which this one doesn't excel.  The nose is gorgeous. Bready base, some thick, woody, vinous notes, and of course the hops on top of it all--tending towards citrus-pine, but a little spicy and floral as well.  The taste is well-balanced for all the name would imply. It's actually more vinously sweet than malty, I'd say--but not cloying. Hops hit on several notes as the nose promised; piney, citrusy, and floral. Nice dry, tannic finish with a little sweetness and little to no alcohol (that can be detected through the hops, anyway). Mouthfeel is pleasantly sticky, kinda staying on your tongue so you can enjoy the interplay of all those hop flavors.  Overall, this is a legitimately great beer, and one that I'm really proud to say comes from my hometown brewery.

A: Pours a clear and bubbly amber color with a thick and frothy, 1.5 finger head that has some very nice retention. the head slowly dissipates to very thick collar that leaves some splotchy and soapy lace.  S: A heavy caramel and rich malt backbone is layered nicely with a some grassy and light piney hops. There is a nice sweetness in the background that plays nicely with the hops.  T: Candied syrup sweetness with a rich caramel malt backbone and some bready grains. The hops pop up mid-palate with some subtle dankness and some mildly bitter pine and tangy grapefruit. The malty sweetness shows itself on the finish.  M: Medium bodied with a sticky and slightly thicker mouthfeel. Carbonation is spot on and the blend of hops and malt sweetness on the finish is nice.  O: A very solid ""Imperial Amber"" that I would relate to Imperial Red by Lagunitas. I think I may like the latter a little more because it has a little more hoppy flavors, but overall this was a deliciously balanced beer.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,areich6,4.38,"Enjoying with my good friend pschul4.  A: Pours with very little head and looks great for an amber. Very dark copper/orange color.  S: Really hoppy forward, in a good way. Smells a lot like an IPA.  T: This is very unique to me because I have never had an imperial amber ale. This brew is quite hoppy but the hop flavor mixes with the caramel malt backbone which is indicitive of this beers amber quality. The hops are very strong at the beginning and then the bitterness suddenly recedes and the grainy/caramel characteristic of the beer is made evident.  M: Quite smooth with a small amount of prickly carbonation. A little bite from the alcohol.  O: I usually do not like amber ales very much, but this is causing me to turn on a new leaf.

S: Tropical fruits - mango, peach, grapefruit. Big, big citrus/tropical fruit notes...sweet hop notes.  T/M: Nice! This is a big tropical fruit hop bomb.

The citrus definitely comes through, and has a nice hop smell.  The taste of this beer is surprising. The malt seems to mellow out the bitterness a bit, and is very refreshing. The citrus comes through pretty strong. Even with the IBU count, the hops do not overwhelm, and there is just the right amount of bitterness in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is fairly light considering the ABV. Very crisp.  Overall, this is one of the better Imperial Amber beers i've ever had, and one of the best high IBU beers i've tasted this year.

Smells great, definetely some maltiness, honey, and sugars, with a variety of citrusy/piney hops throughout.  Tastes awesome. Very refreshing. I tend to prefer malty IPAs, and this is exactly what I look for in a beer. Very refreshing, very fruity, yet still has a great hop profile to satisfy the bitterness. I love how this beer tastes.  Mouthfeel is good for the style.  Overall NN is one of my favorite brews. I look forward to its release each year. If NN was released year round I can probably say with confidence that it would replace SNPA as my go-to beer that I always have in my fridge.  AWESOME!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,beercat11,3.11,"Appearance is amber as indicated. Looks nice with average lacing.  Smell is a subdued sweet hopyness.  Taste is different from what I remember. Not as fruity and seems more on the malt side this time around.  Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated but kind of uneventfull all the way through.  Overall:I have tried this beer out the last six years and cannot understand all the hype. It is very average this year from what I recall. I just don't get it. The only thing I can think of to be fair is that this beer arrives here being less than it was meant to be. Very dissapointed and won't bother with this anymore. There are much better offerings out there. I think the fact that this beer is seasonal and limited, it adds an unwarranted hype element to it.  Update:3/23/12. Just visited my local guy and they had this on tap for grolwers. Filled it up and hit it as soon as I got home. I must say I may have been right about that 6 pack I based my review on because this tastes really different. Not over the top, but more on Q of how it is usually described on taste. I must say it was much more worthy of some praise beyond this initial review. I found the carbonation and hop forwardness more prevalent here and it makes an impression worth noting.  Update January 2021: Bought a 4 pack of 16oz cans and a sixer of bottles. Don't see any need to give this brew a higher rating. The canned version seemed to taste fresher even though the packaged date is within a day of the bottle version. I'm still not getting hype on this beer. It's okay but not world class. I would have to say that Oskar Blues G'Knight tastes better start to finish. I'm convinced that if you can't get the Nugget a week or two after it's packaged you are not going to enjoy this beer for what it's supposed to be. Many IPAs diminish in flavor in a matter of hours after they are bottled or canned. That's why I won't purchase any IPA without knowing it's packaged date. Nugget Nectar is still balanced and enjoyable, but it's just never fresh enough for my taste buds.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Taste is super hoppy with citrus zest and tropical fruit flavors up front with a herbal hop quality on the finish. There is a pretty assertive bitterness on the palate after each sip.

Poured from a 12oz bottle into a 14oz Libbey snifter...bottled on date: Jan. 23, 2012  A- The label lives up to its description...it pours a clear, deep amber/bronze with a frothy, white head approaching 2 fingers in height...really beautiful.  S- Aroma was noticed as soon as the cap was removed. Citrus and sweet tropical fruit are immediate but notes of pine resin quickly follow into the aroma medley.  T- Bitter citrus notes hit the front of the palate with a tacky, resinous finish. Despite the hefty IBU calculation of ""93ish,"" the malt bill keeps the hops in check and maintains a bitter, but not overly astringent character.  O- What is there to say/write? Simply stated, Nugget Nectar lives up to the hype and am ecstatic to have finally had the opportunity to taste/review this seasonal offering.  -&gt;Why does it seem that the best brews always happen to be seasonal offerings (Lagunitas, Founders, Troegs, Dogfish Head all come to mind)?

The aroma is a fabulous combination of fresh pine, orange and grapefruit hops with an underlying thick caramel maltiness. Smooth, oily feel with lazy carbonation. Pine and citrus hop flavors bounce back and forth from beginning to end with a solid caramel malt backbone. Although characterized as an amber ale, this to me is the perfect IPA.

694,15881,Alieniloquium,4.22,"12 oz. bottle poured into an Alchemist pint glass. Thanks to greg4579 and Kirchhoff for independently surprising me with bottles of this. My wife and I are most pleased.  Appearance - Reddish dark amber body with a small khaki head. Nice sticky lacing inside the glass and a little bit of the head lingers past the first few moments.  Smell - Pine hops all over the place. Grapefruit and some peach in there too. The hop profile of an IPA with a nice dose of caramel malt. Not sweet smelling, but definitely malty.  Taste - Following the smell, but the malt is more pronounced than in the aroma. Hops right up front, but they blend nicely with the malt. The finish isn't terribly bitter, but it's enough to offset the maltiness.  Mouthfeel - I keep telling myself it's not an IPA. It seems like a heavy IPA, but the flavor is just distinctly amber enough to keep me interested. Decent carb and maybe a bit heavy.  Overall - It's tough to review this as an amber ale. It's really really good as an amber. As an IPA, it's good, but not great. I don't know how that sits with me. I need to be a mood for the malt backbone to enjoy this thoroughly.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Bitter as can be, and I couldn't be more pleased with it. Hard to finish from the rough taste, but I got by. Oddly similar to an IPA. Surprised to see it wasn't.

694,15881,rmcnealy,4.05,"Served chilled in a traditional pint glass.  Poured a dark amber gold color that was somewhat translucent and appeared to be totally filtered. Produced a small bone white, tightly laced head that reduced to a beautiful even blanket atop the brew. The smells are familiar and inviting. As a hop head who has been on an intense hop kick, I quickly feel at ease with this one. There is an intense hoppiness to this one. I don't notice much on the citrusy scale, but the darker, pinier hops make themselves well known. There is a roasted maltiness on the backend. Very subtle, but existent. The bitter bite is sufficient and finishes off crisp. Has some great qualities of an awesome IPA (or double IPA for that matter) paired with red ale distinctions. Crazy hybrid type beer.

A sweet, mild caramel flavor gives way to an awesome fruit profile with a lot of grapefruit, peach, and some orange. There is also some spice notes (like citrus zest) that roll into a smooth, solid bitter aftertaste. The flavor is awesome. Straight up. Good complexity while still highlighting their awesome work with the hops.  M- Moderate carbonation. Good mouthfeel. Just right.

694,15881,wildweim18,4.33,Really enjoyed this Imperial Amber ale. In my mind it could devinately pass as an IPA.  Orange amber color with a thin off white laced head. Smelled of strong grapefruit and pine with some muddled orange or tangerine. I taste some serious caramel malt with nice body. Piney citrus grapefruit flavor and some orange citrus behind all this. Nicely balanced with some lingering bitterness that you would expect from an IPA.

Looks like a solid amount of carbonation, decent retention, nice lacing. Good looking beer.  S - Definite caramel, toffee, malty sweetness. Maybe the slightest tinge of floral, piney hops but definitely subdued. No sign of the alcohol.  T - That sweet caramel flavor is there right up front with some toastiness but those bitter floral and spicy hops show up at the finish. Very tasty. Still no sign of the alcohol.  F - Medium-bodied, maybe a little lighter than expected but still enough for sure with a slightly creamy, mouth-coating feel to it. Nice carbonation, definitely a dry, bitter finish. Bitterness hangs around for a while, but not as long as some hop-bombs. This is really the only place that the alcohol shows up with a slight warming sensation in the throat.  O - This beer is delicious and may be one of the most balanced beers that I've ever had. It looks great, smells great, and you get equal tastes of malt and hops.

Really upfront hops with a nice, but small malt backing to make it one of my favorites. I get a little soapiness, but it doesn't detract from the overall flavor. A floral attack on your taste buds.

694,15881,MONKandTUCK,3.93,"A - Deep orange, almost red. Look at a Blood Orange. Imagine the juice. Put a thick foamy white cap on it. Bang! You've seen this beer before, B!  I got good head-retention because I poured it aggresively (WHO I AM) into a Bulmer's glass. Bitches be easy, it may not look so pretty in your tumbler ;) RESPEK  A - THIS IS PALISADES. Think apricot jam and mowing the lawn... weird? Won't be when you smell this one. I've heard simcoe sneaks in here, too. Is that the hint of spice?  T - This might be the best style ever. Both hops and malts come through. A lot of knuckleheads will botch the malt-hop combo. Troegs does not. Troegs makes a beer better than most IPA's because it delivers with the hops, while still offering something more satisfying because they focus on the malt.  This is not cloying or roasty, nor is it deeply complex. They just used diverse base malts to make something rich enough that you don't get tongue-fatigue half-way thru.  Ironically, I think this beer gets away with being a little harsher than average because the hops are propped up against a stiff, stiff malt backbone.  M - This ABV is ideal. The beer is rich and chewy. Without having to become heavy or hot, of course.  O - This is a great hop experience THAT DOES NOT USE C-HOPS! Son, if I have to tell you again...  Grab this one. It's like Star Wars... an instant classic using B-cast characters.

Aromas of rich, resiny, wet, green hops on a subtle caramel backbone, with some subtle grapefruit highlights. Flavors are extremely complex and layered, with a hop forward blast of peppery and resiny hops, with grassy and cedar characteristics as well. Caramel malt backbone remains subtle, serving as a canvas for the diverse hops profiles more than anything. This is a tasty beer. The aftertaste is rich and bitter, with a resiny, oily, and peppered hop profile that helps to dry the tongue, transitioning to a clean, slightly slick finish.

694,15881,BARFLYB,4.18,"On Tap at Craft Ale House in a Avery Pint Glass. Nugget Nectar is a great name for a beer, I just had to say that.  The Nectar pours out the spout pretty lively. The color is a golden bronze in appearance with a frothy tannish head that stays and sticks. Not many active bubbles.  The difference between the Nectar and your average IPA is that, this is not an IPA, unlike many would assume because of the hop assult. The biscuit like scent from the malt and some grain are embedded in the juicy nugget hop nectar. Signature troegs pine with some dannk hops.  This tastes really good, I gotta admit, this is great beer. Dank piney resinous hop with some citrus appeal and pine, backed by a dry biscuit backbone. Some small sweetness reminding me of hopback. Some vegetal aftertaste that is shortlived. This is a different animal.  Between an Amber an an IPA place, the not obscene amount of bitterness really shows how this is indeed an Imperial Amber. Carb is spot on. No complaints here.  I love this stuff, I don't buy much when it's out, a few six packs and some pints on tap, but that might change this year.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,NardiByNature,4.47,"Haven't had this yet. Clear and definitely amber. Slightly lighter than their HopBack Amber Ale. A decent off-white cap follows the beer down.  Smells are caramel malt and musty, sweet hops. Straight out of the bottle you get a fruity smell but give it a minute and the hops become much more earthy.  The taste is phenom. It pops out like I would not expect given what initially reminded of the grapefruit/mango/floral bouquet of a nice IPA. But the kick is very different; it’s earthier and weedier. Compared with an IPA again, the flavor ordering is reversed: love how it’s sweet at first, and then bitter second. Caramel malts nlinger on the tongue for a while. If we’re grading in style, an ""Imperial Amber"" class that's definitely small, it’s the benchmark.  Very nice, the scales tilt toward bitter, dry, and burning from the alcohol on the backburner.  O: epic beer if you like a bitter ale. I’m a fan of HopBack Amber, and what they do with the hops in this Nugger Nectar iteration is awesome. I’ve been looking forward to trying this one.

T: The taste is wonderfully full and smooth with a very present sweetness that is balanced by a burst of hops. The high IBU doesn't seem overly biter due to the high level of sweetness present in the beer. The aftertaste is a flowery hop flavor.

Orange and grapefruit comes to mind. Balances along the sweet pale malts.  No wonder this beer is on all the ""top"" beers lists. It's damn near perfect. Tons of hops bitterness. Piney resin and grapefruit citrus blends well with a sturdy malty backbone that gives it a sweeter taste that wasn't expected the first time I ever had this. But the flavors work together so well. That even the hops aren't that overpowering. By now I'm used to this beer and it's become something I look forward to every February. It's like Hopback Ale on steroids and it's simply a powerful and deliciously flavorful beer.  Medium to full bodied. Smooth on the palate and perfectly drinkable. Crisp, yet a dry bitter lingering finish.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,draheim,4.42,"12oz bottle (bottled February 2012) (thanks again IrishColonial) into a tulip. Pours a rich coppery amber w/ a thick frothy beige head that hangs around, leaves some sticky lacing.  Aroma is floral, herbal hops and a slightly more tropical, earthy smell when I press my nose deep into the glass. A little bready, caramel malt too.  Taste is a really nice round mellow balance between the caramel and pale (let's call it amber) malt and the floral hops. Hop bitterness is there too, a counterpoint to this otherwise pretty sweet, malty beer.  Mouthfeel is smooth and balanced as well - coats the tongue but finishes clean and refreshing.  Overall just a really nice, easy drinking beer.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,sayyad,4.1,A - Beatuiful copper-amber color. Less than a cm of head. Thin lacing on the glass.  S - Nothing worth mentioning.  T - Complete with piney hops and a mild fruity aroma. The bitterness is certainly subdued -- very pleasant.  M - Very high drinkability for a 7.5 abv beer.  O - I had heard good things about this beer and had high expectations. It certainly fulfilled my expectations and I think it'll become a classic go-to amber ale for me. Certainly warrants a visit to the Troegs facility.,Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,fmccormi,4.5,"Straight pour from 12oz pry-off bottle to my Bruery tulip (Leuttich balloon-style glass). Bottled on February 20, 2012 (my birthday!) at 12:52PM, apparently—bottling date printed in dark ink on the shoulder of the bottle just above the label (“BOTTLED 022012 12:52 BATCH #120130”).  Appearance (4.5): A solid two-finger head rises with very fine-grain bubbles and collapses to about half a finger of light khaki foam, mixed fat and fine bubbles. Very nice lacing on the sides, at times surprisingly thick. The body is perfectly clear, a very warm reddish amber—a deep orange, more like. Burnt sienna? I’m not going down this road. It looks great.  Smell (4.5): A beautiful floral, orange water-laced scent leads the hop profile in the nose, mixing with a little bit of pine resin and a pungent ruby red grapefruit character to make a bright, fruity, floral, wonderfully hoppy scent coming out of this glass. It works perfectly with the moderately sweet, caramel-scented malt that comes along, too—they blend seamlessly.  Taste (5.0): Pine dominates at first, with red grapefruit and grapefruit pith weaving in and out. The body comes along subtly at first but more and more as it warms, a rich, moderately toasted and moderately sweet malt character that comes off as caramel and earthy, toasted bread. The finish is moderate, not overpowering pine resin. What’s great about this is that even in the finish, neither the hop profile or that malt body take control—they work together the entire time, balancing each other out and moving together. Perfectly balanced.  Mouthfeel (4.5): Very nice rendition here. Nothing new or surprising, but it’s balanced: medium-bodied, slightly oily (thank you, hops), dry in the finish and the carb is moderate but well-distributed, in such a way that it does liven up every part of the tongue. Great job. Only problem is, goes down way too fast!  Overall (4.5): Nugget Nectar really is a masterful creation. It’s not the most insanely hoppy beer you’ve ever tasted, but that’s a good thing. Tröegs, it seems, just GETS how to strike a balance with hops (see my review for Perpetual IPA). This is a well-balanced beer that will satisfy anyone looking for a hoppy beer, a malt beer (once you let it warm a bit), and a distinctly American beer. Great job over at Tröegs in making this beer. I’m not sure how it could be improved in many ways, to be honest . . . maybe 16oz cans? :-) Keep up the good work, Tröegs. But please do put Perpetual in sixers.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

No real floral notes but there is some very nice honey sweetness with a lemony sour taste going on.  M) Love the sweet and sour!  O) The alcohol is well hidden.

694,15881,troysoy2,4.54,"Had on tap at Mad Med on McKnight Rd. 22 oz. ""pint"" glass. Yes!  This wonderful, tall glass of Nugget Nectar is deep amber in color with a gorgeous finger of fluffy white head. The lacing was top notch, and when I had finished the glass, I literally saw notches where I had taken each sip. Of course, I had to order up another.  The smell is a bit subdued. Piney, citrus over a base layer of light roasted malt.  Smooth sweetness on the front, with a flavorful, yet under control piney, resiny hop blast. Not a smack in the face, but very enjoyable, and oh so drinkable. Also some citrus, and a hint of honey. The mouthfeel is surprisingly creamy. A moderately dry finish makes the next sip just that much more desirable.  Overall, this was just what the doctor ordered. No, it's not a hop bomb of epic proportions, and I don't think this brew pretends to be one. It's tasty, it's scary drinkable for 7.5%, and I wish I could have more.

The nose seems to be floral, I can also smell alcohol and also earthiness. A very bitter pine and resinous like hop flavor, it has a very subtle malty taste taht follows the big hop punch. Crispness right at first followed by the resinous bitter hops and then an effervescence that seems to lift off my tongue. This is a great beer for those who like extreme hop flavors.

694,15881,mjtiernan,4.69,"12oz bottle poured into a NB globe. Bottled 2/20/12. Served right out of the fridge.  A: Pour resulted in a short white head that hurried away pretty quickly. Maybe that’s just because this is fridge temp. Left a small ring around the edge and a small cap in the center. Body is (it may be the color of the label influencing me) sort of a rusty orange-red and hazy. Some lacing follows the way down.  S: Dank hop resin and sweet malt. Citrus and pear. The over-the-top hop and honey sweetness combo makes it comparable to Hopslam but it’s to a lesser degree with NN. Slight bubble gum scent. Some undertones of spice.  T: Somewhat sweet and flowery at the start, then a flash of light fruit. Transitions quickly to a hefty dose of pine bitterness but the bitter is held up nicely by the slightly sweet malt. This has a real malt backbone to it even as fresh as it is. I think the spice from the nose came from the piney hops. Finish is dry, astringent and resinous.  M: Medium body, medium to low carb. This is somewhat of a tongue drier but it all works together so well that you can’t wait for your next sip. Sneaky drinkable.  O: I love this beer. It keeps calling to me as I drink it. This is one of only a handful of truly great hop-centric beers that gets distributed to my area, so before I started trading this was pretty much the holy grail. Some of the excitement has worn away now that I’ve tasted so many other world-class hop bombs but Nugget Nectar will always be special.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,StoryOfTheGhost,3.06,"A- amber, like it should be, with a very white lacing, and a pillowy head, and lacing left on side of the glass  S- Pretty one dimensional. Some citrusy and piney hops. Not smelling all these things everyone else is pointing out. Maybe I'm the one missing it  T- Piney, and citrusy. Some sweetness, more of the amber taste than I expected. Probably my fault expecting something hoppier and more caramel hops. Very malty, which usually means something good in my world, but it does not work in this one.  M- Medium body, good carbonation, does not leave a very good taste in the mouth  O- probably the most disappointed I have ever been by a ""Top Beer"". Usually the top beers, even when they are not my taste I can at least appreciate the flavors. This beer was very one dimensional and just not that good",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Darkmagus82,4.08,"Poured from bottle into pint glass  Appearance – Pours a very beautiful deep amber color with a big billowy just off white head. The head has some very nice retention lasting some time, which after fading leaves some nice lacing.  Smell – In the front of the nose is some nice citrus aromas. These mix with some more piney aromas and a bit of roast malt aroma. The aromas are nice.  Taste –There is a smooth malt flavor up front which is quickly engulfed by some hoppiness. The hoppiness is mainly citrus in nature, but some more earthy tastes are present as well. The pine hops come in more toward the end. To finish, the end of the taste is rounded out quite nicely with a little bit of sweetness of caramel.  Mouthfeel – The mouthfeel of this one is very nice. It is much more creamy then I would have originally anticipated. The creaminess coasted the tongue while the more mild level of carbonation enhanced the feel on the tongue. Very soothing and nice.  Overall – This is a nice brew, but I think it is a bit overrated overall. It has a very nice look and mouthfeel and the flavors are very smooth, but for something touted as being a “hopheads nirvana”, it was a bit mild to be a nirvana, maybe just a paradise.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,mwill7287,3.85,"Bottled on February 3, 2012. Enjoyed on Sunday, February 26th. Poured from a 12oz longneck into a tulip glass.  Appearance: Pours a crisp autumnal amber color. Reminds me of the amber color that fossils would be preserved in. An off-white head sits half a finger’s worth deep atop the brew after a fairly vigorous pour. A small army of carbonation bubbles march up the glass. Plenty of residual lacing is left behind. A thin layer of head retains very well throughout the brew. 4.5/5  Smell: On draft, this had an absolutely fantastic nose – the hallmark of the brew, in my opinion. Brightly hoppy, juicily citrus. The bottled version is a little more subdued and has more of a caramel maltiness to it for balance. 4.25/5  Taste: The taste seems to be much more balanced than the nose. In fact the taste is much more to the caramel malty side than hoppy. The “nectar” comes in more on the back end, showing through towards the aftertaste, building up sip by sip. The brew overall ends up being much more standard amber than I expected. Quite good, but worth the hype? 3.75/5  Mouthfeel: Smooth and easy flowing on the palate. Low bitterness and mild carbonation keeps it easy drinking. 4/5  Overall: A good beer, for sure, but I was a little disappointed with it compared with the hype made about it. Definitely a solid brew but not sure why it seemed to sell out instantly. I’ll take it, though! Definitely quite drinkable, even at 7.5%. 3.75/5",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

S - Very hoppy (citrus, tropical fruit, and pine notes) with a background of amber/caramel malts.  T - Great blend of citric and piney hops meet the amber/caramel backbone. It is both sweet and bitter (hoppy) at the same time. Extremely well balanced and very tasty. This is the pinnacle of how an amber should taste.  M - Medium bodied, pitch-perfect carbonation. Slightly chewy with a nice dry, hoppy finish. It feels perfect in the mouth and is very drinkable.  O - Nugget Nectar lives up to the hype. This is one of my ""I have to at least get a six-pack of it every year"" beers. It's really drinkable and is the best Amber beer I've ever had.

This eventually leaves the glass messy with sticky sheets of lace. Near perfect for the style. Very, very pretty.  The aroma is this beer's best aspect, and is incredibly bright and hop-forward, especially for any kind of amber able. There's lots of citrus and passion fruit aroma, along with a hint of bready malt and caramel character, just there to remind you that this isn't a DIPA. Well balanced, though incredibly bright and hoppy.  The flavor too is hop forward, with more hop bitterness than expected, along with a floral and citrusy hop component. There's also good amounts of bread and sweetness, almost like honey. Well balanced, bitter, and very drinkable.  Medium bodied with moderate carbonation.  A delicious, hoppy amber.

The first thing to hit your nose from the aroma is a juicy sweet fruit scent, like strawberry and mango, with a foundation of 'resinous' hops. There a pronounced freshness here, reminding me of clean linen or talc. The flavor is overwhelmingly the earthy hops with only a subtle bit of malt in the background. Wow, this easily could pass for an IPA. The hop bitterness in the finish is great - it really has a great bite!

Starts off with sweet juicy pine notes. SOme slight citrus grapefruit notes and tangerines. Mildly tropical. Some nice slight caramel malt sweetness can be perceived as well. Nice pine notes are definitely present and some good resinous sticky hop notes. A bit dank and grassy if you know what I mean.  Starts off with a delicious grassy hop presence. Some nice resinous pine notes and more of a herbal grassy hop character than the slightly citrus nose indicated. There is definitely some nice toasty and bready sweet malts present with some good slight caramel notes. These however are quickly overtaken again by some nice dankness and resinous pine notes. Very hoppy Amber Ale. Mouthfeel is slick and slightly oily and a bit sticky actually. Almost like sipping on hop oils.  Very good brew. I can see and now believe the hype.

Opens up with some hop presence maybe a bit floral. Backed up really nicely by those toasty malts I was smelling earlier, biscuity.

Definitely tastes like sweet nectar with the hops to balance it out.  Mouthfeel is excellent with good spiciness and a slightly dry finish. Sticky, resinous feel is tasty. Medium body, good carbonation.  Overall it's a good beer. Mixes a lot of good things about beer into one beverage. Would've liked a bit more bitter, but very good. The more I drink the more I enjoy it.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,microbrewlover,4.52,"This brew is a combination of Nugget, Warrior and Tomahawk hops. It delivers on its name.  The brew pours a beautiful deep copper/amber color.  The smell is of hop oils and citrus, pine, orange and grapefruit.  The mouthfeel is thick hop oils, some bitterness but well balanced by the orange, other citrus and grapefruit taste.  The citrus, orange and hop oils stay in the mouth after swallowing leaving a nice clean citrus aftertaste.  Overall it looks as though Troegs has brewed another winner. Hopheads especially should like this one.  Notes: This beers claims to be an ""Imperial Amber"" but could easily be an IPA.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Appearance: A clear amber in color with a white head about a finger and a half of head in the pour with beautiful lacing.  smells: a sweet pine citrus hop and loads of em.  Tastes: wow! I love the fresh citrus hops that warm up into a floral note that is blended with a sweet amber malt that is wonderfully balanced.

T: taste is hoppy up front with citrus taste and bitterness, then malty, and then more hoppy bitterness. The citrus taste is mostly confined to the first bit of the sip.  M: fine bubbles, but well carbonated with a medium mouthfeel  O: excellent beer overall, very drinkable, but I wouldn't want to pay $16 plus tax per 6 pack again for it.

694,15881,MrOH,4.45,"Deep amber, bordering on copper with a generous finger of khaki foam. Good retention. Great lacing.  Apricot, grapefruit, orange, and some dank herbal hop aromas backed up by bready and light caramel malt.  Big punch of hops. Much less fruity and more herbal flavors, rich maltiness throughout, and big bitterness in waves. Quite delicious.  Medium bodied with ample carbonation. Gets a little sticky as it warms.  Probably my favorite beer brewed in PA.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

694,15881,dashmartino,4.34,"I guess this is supposed to be the imperial version of Hop Back. That it is! Crack 'er open very fresh bottle, bought 6 days after it was officially realeased for the year. Pours into my pint glass with a half a finger's head. Smells very hoppy, enough to burn your eyebrows if you get to close! First sip, definitely an intense hop bite, enough to almost make you cross your eyes. Bitterness comes more towards the end of the glug, not really up front, I think that what makes the experience very memorable. Bitterness is lingering between sips. Slightly thicker than a hop back. Almost comparable to a 120 minute without the unpleasantly high alcohol or syrupy taste.

694,15881,RobbieB5555,4.77,Travelled to Troegs yesterday with my oldest son and three of his friends so we could experience our first Nugget Nectar of the season. We were not disappointed.  It poured a beautiful amber color with wonderful citrus and pine aromas. The taste did not disappoint! My mouth was overwhelmed by the wonderful flavor of citrus. The initial feel was complex but the finish was a great combination of gratefruit and pine.  Over the last three years this has become one of my top five favorite beers. I recommend this to everyone!,Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,siege06nd,4.97,"Poured into my Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald standard pint.  A. Mostly clear dark orange. Quarter finger of eggshell head. Impressive, finely beaded lacing on the glass. Good retention. Looks great.  S. Very clean, assertive hop profile. Lots of tropical notes, including pineapple and mango. Also hints of pine and some creamy biscuit malt. A subtle but delicious nose. Almost like an IPA. Hops are strong but not overwhelming. Cant imagine this getting much better.  T. Grapefruit, pineapple, pine resin. A little bit of orange and lemon zest as well. Extremely tropical flavor. Undercut with some solid, creamy malt presence. This is ridiculous good.  M. Perfect. Moderately carbonate and medium bodied. The 7.5% is hidden well, not a hint of booze. Flavors are perfectly balanced, with a malt and hop interplay unlike any beer I have encountered. It is bold yet smooth, assertive yet light. Superb.  O. It's a perfect beer. And Troegs is flippin brilliant for making this an Amber style. This gives them greater leeway with the malt bill that lets them enhance the smoothness and full-bodied character of the ale. So light drinking, yet so full of flavor. And at $11 per 6 pack and super widely available in its distribution area, this has to be the best deal in beer, even better than Two Hearted. Standing ovation for this amazing creation.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,B33R501,1.58,"Poured into my tulip almost undrinkable. Into my coffee cup a little better. Its early, but probably the worst beer I've has this year.  Pours clear amber, lackluster head, lace. Smells and tastes bitter hoppy onion, leaving a very unpleasant aftertaste. Love onions on my cheesesteak, not my beer. Where's the balance? Malts? Grapefruit or orange flavor?  Onion beer. The Shmaltz Lenny Bruce RIPA I loved this weekend would be a 10, this a generous 2. Lousy. What a waste of money. My bad.

694,15881,thecheapies,4.35,"On-tap at Wingharts.  Not much head due to a nearly full pour. Nice amber color with red hues. Extraordinary lacing.  Great grapefruit and pine nose. Touched by a caramel malt support.  Crushingly bitter and hoppy. Explosive grapefruit, lemon, and pine hops burst this one wide open. Very chipper and bright. There's an appealing tangy caramel malt in the blend, but it's a lovely hop showcase. Best tasting amber ale to date.  Drinks remarkably easy. Medium body with a smooth whey-like consistency. Good sweep of spritz spreads the flavors across the tongue. A burper.  A PA classic. This is my first of the year, but looking to buy a case. It's that good.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,tlazaroff,4.55,"Bouquet of wonderfulness, full of floral and citrusy goodness. There is a great toast component to the nose as well.  The beer looks amazing. I couldn't give it a five because I just wish the head was more prominent. Its a clear amber color with an nice off white head. Lacing just sticks to the glass.  Nugget Nectar is incredibly hoppy, but not very bitter - this is why I love it so much. The aroma and flavors are dominated by these Nugget hops that provide this incredible burst of a kind of spicy floral/herbal goodness. Slight tangerine flavor and the backend is a nice round toasted bread.  The mouthfeel is quite good perfect balance of body and carbonation. Finishes a bit on the dry side, which I like with hoppy beers. Overall this is a fantastic Red Ale.. it's strange that my favorite hoppy beer is not an IPA.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,nrs207,4,"Bottled on 2/3/12. Enjoyed on 2/23.  A - Really nice amber color. No surprise as it's an imperial amber. Very translucent. 2 finger pillowy off-white head. Good lacing.  S - Citrus, grapefruit, earthy, and pine. Definitely a strong malt backbone to back up the 93 IBU.  T - Same as the smell. Has an interesting taste on the way down. Very earthy, a little bit of alcohol. The 93 IBU aren't as present as you'd think, with the malt doing a good job at balancing it out. Definitely a solid brew.  M - Very smooth. Slightly thicker mouthfeel due to the lower amount of carbonation. Not really sure if I'd prefer more carbonation or not. The mouthfeel suits the beer well.  O - It's a pretty good brew. I'm not sure if it lived up to the hype for me, but I do enjoy it. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes IPAs. This is pretty much an IPA with enough malt to characterize it as an amber.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,TheMultiYeast,4.55,"Clear amber/orange with one finger of beige head. Decent retention with little lacing.  Aroma carries a lot of weight for this one. Fresh juicy hop oils with a fruity, almost medicinal, quality. Moist tropical fruits, mint, pineapple, grapefruit, peach sweetness, sappy pine.  Fantastic layering of flavors. Hefty amounts of steeped hops, more tropical fruit essence upon a slab of malt. Quick stab of bitterness doesn't hit like 93 IBUs. Bitterness is balanced perfectly.  Prickly, fast carbonation, fairly light. Good for a brief session and fantastic overall. Troegs has mastered the subtleties of a heavily hopped brew.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

T- Hops come through from the beginning to the end with a smooth malty body. Tastes exactly as it smells.  M- Incredibly smooth. A hint of carbonation comes through with a smooth body. Stickiness from the hops is left behind after each sip.  O- I had high hopes for this beer and I wasn't let down. Incredible mix of being hop forward with smoothness from the malt.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Viciousknishs,4.5,"A- pours an orange amber color with a finger of off white head. Solid retention.  S- super juicy pungent pink grapefruity hop aromas with notes of floral and resiny pine blend in as well. Balancing malt backbone provides a touch of malt sweetness to the nose while still allowing the hops to shine. Finishes with some tangerine and sticky hop oils.  T- again super juicy citrus hop flavors envelope the palate with notes of pink grapefruit, tangerine and resiny pine. Subtle malt sweetness is there mid palate with a honey coated toasted bread quality. Finishes with a lingering almost tangy grapefruit peel and assertive hop bitterness leaving hop oils and grapefruit in the after taste forever.  MF- smooth full mouthfeel. Medium body and average carbonation.  D- extremely drinkable. Balanced very hop forward brew.  Overall a phenomenal imperial amber that I look forward to every year.

694,15881,KMcG,4.62,"A: This copper ale pours with a nice rich, sticky off-white head. Small carbonation bubbles are present all throughout the glass. Once the head dissipates, the stickiness shows with a web-like lace on the glass.  S: The aroma is really nice, but taunting. You just want to keep your nose in the glass. Citrus and pine dominate the nose giving it a brilliant character that is balanced with sweet caramely malts.  T: This is so well-balanced considering the strong hoppy aroma. The hops are complex with flavors like grapefruit and earthy floral tones. It is not bitter at all, but grounded with caramel malts and a warm backbone.  M: The stickiness also carries over to the mouthfeel. It's medium bodied, but with a crisp light carbonation.  O: It is well crafted and I can clearly see why people hold it up with some of the best hoppy beers.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Two finger fluffy egg shell head with good retention and some lace.  S: Piney and floral hop notes. Some citrus. Nice nose at first but really drops off as drink.  T: The taste however is not mild (thankfully). Big juicy hop profile. Lots of pine and grapefruit. Finishes piney and floral with lots of lingering bitterness.  M: Very nice full bodied brew. Just the right amount of carbonation. Crisp with lots of lingering flavors.  This is a top notch example of the style! Just a fantastic hop profile and mouthfeel.

One of the most aromatic beers ive smelled!!  T: Very unique and balanced. The first sip I had reminded me of a carbonated grapefruit juice with tons of hops. The bitterness is present but far from overpowering.  M:Pretty normal, medium carbonation. Goes down very smooth for the amount of hops.  O: Absolutely love this beer. Ive had almost all of the offerings from troegs, and this is my favorite.

S: Piney hops, citrus, and hint of sweet malts. Smell is nice and strong!  T: Follows closely to smell - absolutely delish. Orange, grapefruit, and other citrusy tones mingle with a sweet malt flavor and a very present, yet not in your face hop bite. It is very well balanced and leaves a sweet, slightly spicey aftertaste in the mouth.  M: Smooth and creamy with moderate carbonation. Carbonation does not have much of a bite though. Goes down very well and is highly drinkable.  O: This is one of the best amber ales I've had. I'm not much of a hop-head, but with the nicely balanced sweetness/bitterness, this brew won over my heart. I only wish it was available over a longer period of time.

694,15881,NoLeafClover44,4.65,"12 oz. bottle poured into HopDevil pint. Stamp indicates it was bottled 2/6/12.  A - Totally translucent dark amber/auburn color with a two finger off-white head that dies rather quickly. Leaves a sporadic lacing down the glass as I drink. Bonus points in this category for great bottle art.  S - Smells of pineapple, with emphasis on the pine. Nice sweet caramel malts and earthy hops make this very fragrant. Good stuff.  T - Amazing. The combination of tangerine, grapefruit, malt, and hops is intoxicating (to say nothing of the 7.5% alcohol). The flavors culminate into something akin to a spicy sweet cinnamon on the finish. It is incredibly balanced and as others have said leaves a magnificent aftertaste unlike any other. Very well hopped, but wouldn't have guessed 93(ish) IBU because it goes down so smooth. Dangerously drinkable as each sip leaves me craving more.  M - Highly carbonated but feels as if there are nano-bubbles, making it velvety smooth. Medium bodied with a great finish. I can't decide if it is moist or dry on the finish, but whatever it is, it is refreshing.  O - I have been waiting since last year for this release and picked it up as soon as it got off the truck today. Nugget Nectar has such a unique flavor that works on every level. It is no wonder it has such a high rating on BA. Very balanced and I believe it drinks as an imperial amber, despite the popular opinion that it is actually an IPA. I can't get enough and always grab a case or two right when it comes out. I wish it was around for longer, but the limited release adds to the allure. Among the best beers I have ever had.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,RnRManifesto,4.57,"Poured from a bottle into a Nugget Nectar pint glass. Pours a deep orange/amber with a nice 1/2"" tan head that lingers a while, leaving lacing on the glass as it dissipates. Lacing sticks around all the way through the beer.  First thing you notice is the smell. Wow! Huge citrus hop presence you can smell a mile away. Mango, grapefruit, and also some pine in the nose. This may be an imperial amber but the smell ranks up there with the best IPAs I've had.  Taste is citrus, pine, caramel malt, sweet up front then bitter on the finish, but extremely well balanced for 93 IBUs. You would think a beer with that many IBUs would be a palate crusher, but not the Nectar, it's smooth and remarkably balanced. Just enough bitterness to make you want another sip... And another, and another. The bitterness does linger in the back of the throat. Overall, the best way I can describe the Nectar is an Amber Ale/IPA hybrid.  Not thick or syrupy on the mouthfeel, medium bodied and juicy!  I was hoping that this beer would live up to the hype, but was afraid it wouldn't. I've been let down by other similarly seasonal and much-hyped beers in the past. I'm pleased to say I'm not disappointed. I won't say it's the best beer I've ever had because I've had too many great ones. I will say that it's a great beer, and I can see why so many people love it. I'm glad I bought two cases because it was flying off the shelves. Now I'm just wondering if that will be enough.

Pours, true to the style, a brilliant amber hue with a very creamly, lush, two finger head that sticks around for a LONG time, and leaves some of the most lovely lacing ever to grace the wall of a pint glass. The nose is lightly hoppy and pleasant, although a bit muted. There's nothing offensive about this at all despite what I already know to be the overall hoppiness of the beer. No pine here, and a very mild citrus at best. The taste on this is absolutely killer. This is about as drinkable a beer as I've had across all styles. The hops are simply perfect. This puts most IPA's to shame in such a manner that were it to be classified as an IPA, it would absolutely lay waste to a good chunk of the big boys out there. The mouthfeel is marvelous too.

The fluffy white head rises up and quickly recedes into a lovely ring that leaves minimal lacing.  Smell: This may be the most aromatic beer that I have ever poured from a bottle. The citrus from the hops hit me square in the face while enticing me with the slightest notes of toasty malt.  Taste: The citrusy hops really come to the forefront here working themselves over the tongue. More orange than grapefruit but both flavors are there. The wonderful malt backbone contains the hops just long enough to give way to the slightest bitterness. This is one of the most balanced beers I've ever had. There was no flavor that was overpowering and everything worked together to compliment each other.  Mouth feel: The medium body used the carbonation to its maximum potential. This beer worked very well on the palate.  Drinkability: In a perfect world I would drink this everyday for the rest of my life. So yeah, I would say it's highly drinkable.

694,15881,DividedAvery,4.29,"750ml poured into New Belgium sniffer  A: Amber in color, a little thin and translucent. When poured gives about a one finger white head that doesn't linger too long.  S: Lots of caramel, light citrus and fruit notes. Really nice aroma  T: Light citrus hop notes, grapefruit-like giving way to a nice caramel background. There is a nice lingering bitterness that is not overwhelming. Got some real nice carbonation on it too.  M: Much lighter than I was expecting, nice carbonation with a gentle warming.  O: This beer gets a lot of hype. This was received in a trade and was bottled on the 19th of January it looks like. So not ideally fresh but I can imagine how wonderful this beer is newly bottled. There is a nice caramel dimension with the age on it. I will have to snag a fresh bottle some time in order to truly enjoy this beer as it is meant to be.

694,15881,jisom123,4.32,"This is the Best beer I have had from Troegs.  Very hoppy, but well balanced through the entire sip. It doesn't ""kick-in"" heavy at any one particular point. Its a great beer from the first sip to the last.  If you like Hoppy beers, you must try. This one is a standard to judge other Hoppy Reds.

694,15881,AllHatDavidson,4.42,"Pours a clear amber, with slightly off-white head. Aroma of sweet floral hops, resiny, with some fruit like apricot and mandarin orange. This beer has a great smell, just sweet dank hops. Taste is sweet but bitter hops, mellowed by sweet malts, with very subtle caramel notes. Mostly hops on the finish, leaving you with hoppy breathe. Though this beer is sweet, it’s not sickly sweet, molasses / sugar-cane like or anything. Not like a barley-wine. Rather, it has a remarkable bittersweet character that really distinguishes this one from other beers. Full bodied but not heavy in the sense of a stout or imp. ipa, soft but bitter mouth feel. ""Nugget nectar"" really does accurately describe this brew. Cheers.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,SkiBum22,4.45,"A - Pours a clear amber colour with an ivory coloured head that very slowly reduces to a lacing film.  S - Aromas of mango, grapefruit, bready malt, piney hops, herbs, and subtle citrus rind.  T - Same punch of a wide variety of hop flavors, perfectly accentuated by the sweet malt's not quite balancing out, but backing up the strong hop flavor.  M - Medium-bodied feel with moderate carbonation and a bit of alcohol warmth. I was looking for a bit more smoothness.  O - Great beer that lived up to the expectations I had for it.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Beerenauslese,4,"Poured into a pint glass, to produce a 3/4 inch head. Body appearance is a translucent hazy orange amber. Foamy off-white head, condenses a bit, eventually dissipating to a ring while leaving some sticky lacing on the glass.  Smells of lightly toasted barley malt, hay, a little orange and citrus hops.  Taste follows the nose, with an intense amount of sweet bready malt that is balanced by an equally intense amount of hops. Hops taste predominantly of grapefruit rind and orange. I find this rather harsh.  Body is medium and carbonation is light, giving this a slightly creamy mouthfeel. A bit of a hop burn on the tongue.  Overall, this is an over-the-top malty and bitter hopped beer that lays a solid claim on the amber/red world, while giving chase to many west coast style IPAs. There are many finer examples of highly hopped and malty IPAs--I find this rather brash and overbearing.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Rippeddisc,4.25,"Shipped out from a friend in NY...sat around for a while so not overly fresh so feel like this is missing some of the hop kick that should be prevalent.

Finger of white creamy head that dissipates. Minimal lacing.  S: Smells caramelly and malty and awesome.  T: Holy hell. That's like a caramelized grapefruit. So drinkable.

694,15881,jondeelee,4.42,"Smells strongly of hops, with a nice grapefruit scent overlaid on a malty, sugary backdrop. Small hints of apricot and berry flavors also reside in the nose.  On the tongue, the flavors are by far dominated by grapefruit bitter hops, but the bitterness is not so much as to be overbearing. Instead, it's comparable to any medium-strong IPA, providing a nice tart tang. As with the nose, a malty, sugary layer lies just beneath, providing the apricot and berry flavors hinted at earlier. These are joined by lightly toasted grains and just the slightest hint of caramel. The aftertaste is almost exclusively hops.  Overall, this is an excellent beer, and though it's listed on the bottle as an ""Imperial Amber,"" it seems to me that it more resembles an IPA, though with a distinctive and wonderful fruitiness. The bitterness may be too strong for anyone who doesn't like IPAs in the first place, but for hop lovers, this is a great beverage.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

T- Candied pineapple right outta the gate, its AWESOME. Sweet and tart with a peppery flavor to the end. I can't get over the pineapple in this, if you couldn't tell. The hops come through in a way that's different than I've tasted before. Has a certain sticky maltiness that is a real crowd pleaser (I'm the crowd).  MF- It's sticky and with a heavy mouthfeel. Well carbonated.  O/D- This is one bomber that I'm glad I'm sharing, because it's boozy. An excellent, wonderful beer but not one that I could or should drink more than a glass of.

694,15881,curasowa,4.5,"Appearance: Amber color with 1 finger of head that fades slowly with chunky lacing.  Aroma: Delectably potent piney hops with some earthiness in the background.  Taste: A big punch in the face of resinous hop bitterness right off the bat that doesn't let up the whole way through. There's some sticky sweet malt in the middle, but it gets pushed out towards the back end and the all-mighty bitterness comes back for the finish, which is lingering and slightly sweet.  The Rest: A nice creamy body and just an absolute blast of piney hops makes this one of my top three seasonals. One of its only flaws is a slightly muted aroma compared to the taste.

694,15881,BarryMFBurton,4.4,"I’ve gotta say, this is some awesome bottle art. A big, juicy hop flower in a guy’s hand, squeezed with such enthusiasm that it’s spitting out an amber liquid; quite literally, he’s squeezing the juice out of a hop. I’m in love already.  This is yet another one of my finds while in Cleveland; I was a bit sad that I couldn’t find any Columbus IPA, but this (and a bottle of Speedway Stout) totally made up for it. The bottle reads “Hopheads Nirvana,” and at “93ish I.B.U.’s,” I have no doubt that what I have right here will thrill my bitter senses to the core. Hit it!  Brewed six months before the date of this tasting (“Bottled on Jan. 24th, 2011”).  A: Not surprisingly, this “Imperial Amber” has a solid amber body. A gorgeous shine reminds me of Bell’s Two Hearted and, though the two brews aren’t the exact same style, it certainly brings back good memories. The head, while thin, arrives with a satisfying foaminess. It trickles down in no time, though it leaves delicate tracks of lacing all around the rim of the glass. It could stand to be a little more spirited in its appearance, but only slightly.  S: Am I imagining it, or does this one even have an amber nose? Seriously, the malts I get from this are mostly roasted, and the hops themselves are even dark. Anyway, I can certainly imagine why this is perfect for a hophead like me: the nose is an earthy flavor bomb of bitterness. These flowers are in top form. Fresh fruits make their statement, too, promising a sweet malty character to the palate. I can’t wait.  T: Slow and fiery, the army of hops in this brew come marching through the palate from front to back. Incredible. I don’t know how they did it, but this is the least overwhelming high-IBU beer I’ve ever had. I like it, a lot; it’s enjoyable, not demanding. That doesn’t mean it’s not hoppy or intense – it just takes its time to hit your palate. Before that, there’s a heavily roasted grainy backbone, supporting even darker sugars. A slight fruity edge gives this a unique element, too, almost like it is imported. Belgium or Germany, maybe, because the fruit presence is as mellow and yeasty as a good abbey dubbel or a bock. Either way, it’s blended very well, with a very dry aftertaste. A surprisingly well-balanced (though still hop-centric) ale.  M: Abundant micro-fizz…perfect for this beer. Slightly tongue-numbing at times, but that just adds to the experience. Flawless execution.  O: Well-rounded is an understatement with this beer; it hits the spot in so many ways. My favorite Amber Ale to date, and it will be hard to beat. I can’t see it getting any better than this; that is, of course, unless I can get it fresh.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

694,15881,Cavery,3.9,"What a pleasant surprise to have had this on this fateful night!  Bottle share between Klym, Chambic, and myself. Thanks to Chambic for whipping this out so generously.  This bottle is a bit old, 12oz shared on 7-11-11, review from notes  Poured into Stone Nonic.  A: Pink/red body with an off-white head, stained with the colors of the body. Looks like a slightly deluded grapefruit juice, maybe with a dash of some guava nectar. Otherwise quite clean looking, just an unusual color of yellowish foam and ruby-red body.  S: Light hops with a juicey body that comes off a bit mellowed. Light fruit flesh that comes off lightly baked. The alcohol comes through a bit in smothering notes of fruit juices. Resins that seem at the end of their lifespan fight their way into my nose, and they let me know they were kind of a big deal in their day.  T: Really delicious zesty citrus fruit juices with some pineapple juices. This is not like that pineapple note you get in a lot of IPAs or Belgian IPAs, it's a rather less acidic and more marmalade like note. Soft notes of mango flesh in pineapple juice punch through the noticeably weaker hop character. An adorable hop background is almost too slight to notice.  M: the mouth is a bit light with the body slightly diminished. I imagine the age of the beer has hurt this. There's still enough to make drinking this quite enjoyable, but the body is disproportionately weaker than the flavor.  O: All in all I have to revisit this with a fresher offering. The flavors are really so spot on, and the only things that are slightly off with it could be improved with freshness. There's nothing wrong with this beer even with some age on it, it's just that the volume is a bit too low on things that certainly are much brighter in their youth.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

According to Chambic this bottle was near 2 years old, so I've tried to be very lenient in my rating of this. To keep it short, I really enjoyed this beer. I typically don't like hop-bombs but this just delivered such a flavorful heavy hop-centric smell and flavor that mellowed out a bit in the taste and allowed the other flavors to bloom out a bit. I would love to have this fresh and would love even more to have this fresh and on-tap. To think that this is an imperial amber just leaves me stunned.

694,15881,stakem,4.08,"Review from notes taken approximately 3 months ago.  Poured from a sixtel on tap in my garage into a snifter. This brew appears a perfectly clear color of copper to orange. 2 fingers worth of white froth for a head appears with a light tinge of yellowish stained coloration. It leaves patches of lace coating the glass in a webbing pattern as the head slowly recedes. A light swirl revives nearly a finger of head back to the surface.  The smell of this brew is a bit of letdown after drinking extremely fresh nugget nectar nearly nonstop since December/January. The aroma of this brew is a plethora of hoppy characteristics smelling fruity, floral, herbal, piney and a bit catty. Whereas a more fresh version of NN has a very bright citrus, fruit and floral component, this brew displays more herbal, mineral. minty and catty characteristics that (while still enjoyable) are not as enjoyable as fresh nugget. There is also more of a persistent malt smell that is quite toasty which is much more hidden in fresh nugget. Overall the smell of this brew has quite a spiced aspect towards to end of the nose.  The taste of this brew is spiced with a resinous hoppy oil cling that is herbal, catty, and quite mint-like. The herbal cling and bitterness of this brew hangs inside the mouth matched with a toasted grain sweetness. However, the hoppiness of this brews flavor is much more pronounced than the hop bitterness. There is a bit of a sulfur touch along with a grassy herbal character that is quite muted compared to fresh nugget which tastes more fruity and floral.  The alcohol incorporation in this brew is evident with a persistent warmth in the back of the throat on every sip. This brew is significantly more spicy on tap and warming than both the bottle and cask offerings I recently consumed. It is medium to full bodied with a modest amount of carbonation. This brew is good, nay it is fantastic. However, this brew falls victim to the fresher the better. If you can get this beer fresh it is absolutely world class, an A+ offering. I never thought I would be saying this but bottles of this beer I have enjoyed for the past 4 months have been significantly more enjoyable than each and every one of my draft experiences, this one included.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Nice balance, oddly without a lot of malt emphasis. It's rather well-done.  Very smooth mouthfeel with adequate carbonation. Body is thicker than I thought it would be.

I think I'm more disappointed because it just didn't live up to the hype that I read on this site.  I hope to try it again and see if it was my tastes that were off. I've only had it once, and I want to give it a fair shake.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,ReelBigwigFish,4.8,"This is long overdue, 2 cases later, I've decided on my final beer of nugget nectar for the 2011 season, I'd write a review on it. Same batch from February.  A: Pours a copper amber color, creamy light tan head that leaves heaps of lacing.  S: Wallop of citrusy and sweet fruit hops up front, with a piney hop and sugary malt scent in the background. There is a definite aroma of pineapple in there.  T: Same punch of a wide variety of hop flavors, perfectly accentuated by the sweet malt's not quite balancing out, but backing up the strong hop flavor. Pineapples, oranges.  M: Medium+ body, with a sticky feel. Honestly goes down very smooth and crisp for a stronger ale of this sort. I'd session it, after all I finished my first case of this stuff in under a week back in Feb haha.  O: This beer is most definitely in my top 3... or 5.... maybe 2. I don't know, regardless it's one that I hold in high esteem. It's perfectly put together for my palette, not insanely priced, and I feel that it's seasonal availability adds to it just that little bit more....

S: Clean, refreshing floral hops, slight caramel malt, a touch of citrus zest  T: A very balanced taste of citrus and floral hops and caramel malts throughout. The initial, middle, and aftertaste all resonate with hops and malts equally, which I have to say is quite an accomplishment. Still, Oskar Blues' Gknight is better than this one.  M: Slightly sticky and resiny, leaves a nice hop stickiness in the back of your throat, warms nicely. Highly drinkable.  O: This is a very tasty brew, but it hasn't changed my top 5 DIPA list.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

The crisp bitterness paired well with the buttery and fatty sweetness of the steak.  A - Poured in a New Belgium globe. It poured a slightly cloudy dark red-amber with a nice one-finger beige head. Lots of sticky lacing.  S - Very pungent aroma with huge citrus; orange, grapefruit and lemon zest. Yeast and pine notes backed up the fruits.  T - Caramel and honeyed malts w/ orange up front. The malt and yeast peek through then fade to earthy, grassy, and lemon flavors before the sharp pine bitterness in the finish.  M - Medium-bodied feel with moderate carbonation and a bit of alcohol warmth. I was looking for a bit more smoothness.  O/D - Nice showcase of hop complexity; citrusy, grassy and piney. None of these characteristics dominate so it ends up being a nice balance. Malt character and sweetness are secondary, but very nice.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,JTSbeerislife,4.42,"12 oz bottle from the 2011 batch, poured into an Imperial British ""nonick"" Pint. The best glass for IPA's under 9-10% ABV, IMO  Beautiful orange amber color, with a thick head when first poured, dissapears quickly but easily revived with a little swirling  When smelled you immediatly notice a nice light sweet malt, followed by distinctly flowery hops, and toasty pine resin. A classic American IPA  The first sip delivers a full bodied, hop delicious entry, crisp mouthfeel, with a touch of malt sweetness, very well balanced, incredibly delicious and a true pleasure to drink  Long hop finish that just makes you want to take another sip, very addictive  One of my favorite IPA's. An American Classic. States Imperial on the lable but at 7.5% ABV it's a little light for that. My ""house"" IPA is 6.7% ABV.

The aroma on this beer is wonderful. It smells like a citrusy floral IPA. It's makes my mouth water just smelling it. The taste is piney and citrusy. It's very bitter and pretty much a kick in the mouth. The mouthfeel is slightly heavy, not heavy enough to keep you from having multiple over the course of some time. Overall this beer is quite good.

M: On the heavier side of medium with appropriate carbonation.  O: I found this beer to be a bit disappointing and a bit of a let down, lacking the strong hop character I was expecting it to have.

Wow, this is complex; there's hops here, sure, but also some wheatiness, and a bit of mango. 'Tropical,' my friend's assessment, isn't off-base. Despite a big old hop-nugget on the front, this is quite well balanced and worth a try even for non hop-hounds. There is a hop-and-honey aftertaste though.  Mouthfeel is fine, a bit prickly.

694,15881,SickGnar,4.42,"A: Warm orangey amber to leaning slightly golden copper. Clear with a few rising bubbles. Huge light pastel mango (sort of light yellow sherbet) head of foam that turns rocky. It keeps a cap and leaves really great lace.  S: Pungent orange, tangerine, grapefruit citrus nose. Caramel & pale malt in the background with a light sweetness. Aromatic and strongly inviting.  T: Bitterness is there for sure, but it is more hop flavor focused. Great robust and rounded citrus. Some orange, some tangerine, some grapefruit juice, some rind… There is also some tropical fruit and a general juicy fruit effect going on. Just a bit of resin comes through in the end. Malts are just the barest step behind with juicy pils, some steely light caramel, some lighty toasty grains and hints of bread crust. Not complicated malts, but robust, punchy, and appealing. Peppery alcohol sneaks in as it warms, as does the herbal/grassy/floral hops.  M: A bit over medium body with CO2 a touch underbalanced. Creates a mildly viscous, chewy feel with a fair amount of residual sugars. Yet, the obviously plentiful hops lead to a semi-dry finish. Super faint alcohol warmth creeps in toward the end.

After smelling this several times I am noticing a few additional things. Backed by caramel malts, I smell apricot, peach, pine...even some cinnamon and black pepper.  The taste includes a good deal of apricot with some peach. Some celery like bitterness comes in after the fruit to offset the sweetness. The balance is very nice as malts pleasantly round out the back end.  I am pleased with the way that this fills my mouth. Slightly creamy and plenty full with a pinch of drying in the end.

694,15881,DrDemento456,4.5,Not sure why I haven't reviewed this. Must have went through a 12 pack of it this year.  A - Looks like a decent amber. Tinted amber tones with a solid inch of the white stuff. Lacing throughout this beer was crafted with awesomeness.  S - You get mostly hops grapefruit and citrus with very little bitter pine and a solid caramel base that almost smells of toffee.  T - Taste is described better by others but to me it's an incredibly balanced red almost in the same vein as an IPA. You get hops but not overly bitter but sweet balanced with a caramel and gram cracker like malt that delivers a great finish bitter yet not cloying.  M - Light to medium. they makes a great beer them Troeg bros.  Overall this beer is a great balance of hop and malt and I will look forward to tracking down a case next year. As this years batch ends the best of this beer can be found in bombers so if you want an offering the freshest it can be grab a bomber (one or two months old I believe) Other than that you will just be one of those guys that give a A rating beer a B+ or something.

694,15881,Mississipping,4.17,"Thanks a ton to a fellow Buckeye for sending a couple of these as extras. 12oz bottle poured into a Sleeping Lady Brewing Co. pint glass.  A: Pours a clear but dense copper color. Light has a hard time making its way from one side of the glass to the other and really creates a nice glowing orange effect. A violent pour produces a small one finger head of off-white foam that settles to a somewhat sticky film and ring.  S: Floral hops, a touch of pine resin, and delicious citrus fruits ... grapefruit and sweet tangerine. The hoppiness, pine, and citrus are balanced very well by a medium malt profile that adds a bit of sweetness most closely matching caramel.  T: Starts out really sweet. Tangerine is the first thing I taste, along with caramel. It remains sweet through the middle and slowly transitions to subtle grapefruit, hops, pine, and pepper. The smell and taste are almost complete complements of one another, however, it provides a surprising deliciousness. I really like the fruity and malty sweetness up front that gives way to a more bitter finish. The finish lasts for quite a long time.  M: Medium bodied. Smooth and creamy with a moderate level of carbonation that makes it tingle just a bit on the tongue. Very nice feel. Slightly bitter at the finish and a moderate drying effect.  D: This is almost too easy to put down. After a couple sips, it starts to taste a little watery, but it regains a little complexity as it warms a bit. Overall, it's delicious and quite refreshing.

Lace is looking a bit sticky at this point.  The smell is of sweet malts. Also piney and citrus blossom aromas. I grew up in a house that was built in an old grapefruit orchard and it kind of smells like the spring time blossoms. I do also get just a hint of alcohol. Very nice!!  Taste is smooth, sweet malts. Kind of tart more that bitter with the hops, but enjoyable. I think the bitter may be like orange pith sprinkled with sugar. Not really getting much alcohol.  The feel is very nice for an ""amber"". I will grade as one, but it tastes and drinks more like a big IPA. As an IPA I give this one a very high mouth score, as an American Amber I must give it a bit higher score. Rich, silky and full. Not a bit watery and ""drinkable"". Getting a bit of alcohol warmyness late.  Overall I really enjoyed this.

Pours a clear amber hue with one finger of bubbly, cream-coloured froth and sporadic dots of lacing on the tulip glass. Head retains for the duration of the beer.  Smell is pine sap, perfume, clementine, honey, orange rind, taffy, oily and resiny hops, cake dough, nectarine, and red grapefruit. Faint hints of tropical fruit and cotton candy can also be detected. Just a massive blast of hops; very impressive.  Taste is resinous, citric, and floral hops upfront; complex flavours of nectarine, navel orange, tangerine, and mango mid-palate; balancing sweetness imparts caramel, honey, and taffy; solid bitterness lingers in the finish but never overpowers the palate. Delectable.  Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, firm carbonation, juicy middle transitions to a clean bitterness with more citrus on the cough. Awesome.

694,15881,Nugganooch,3.92,Tasting notes from 04/15/11 - Bottled 12/21/10 and still tasting great.  *This review made possible by my very first trade with user Shuggy. Many thanks! A brew I would probably otherwise never get my hands on...how fucking cool is that!  A: Very light for an Amber. More of a darkened goldish pale hue with a 1 finger fluffy khaki colored head. Some soft carbination going on. Light lacing that washed back down into the brew with every sip.  S: Sweet caramel malt notes up front with some big juicy citrus aroma blasts that just take over. Damn smell reminds me of a CactusCooler. Really nice.  T: Caramel roasted malt flavors really come through first on this one but a very nice bite of hops on the palate. I am getting lots of herbal and spice notes but mostly dominant pine and citrus. Its all there really. Has a good peppering on the tongue that dries things out a bit with ABV's coming through nice and subtle.  M: Very nice. A smooth and creamy mouthfeel that puckers out with the IBU's coming in finishing things out a bit dry.  D: Pretty solid. I can easily see myself getting nicely toasted off of a full sixer here.  I can definitely see the attraction to the Nectar as there is some solid bitterness in this brew. I can only imagine how much better this stuff is off of a fresh tap or a Double dry hopped cask even. This beer could easily toe the line and pair well with spicey foods and other big flavored dishes.,Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,chiliboy98,5,"Every January, my friends and I begin to stalk our local beer shops as if we were on an FBI surveillance duty looking for contraband. And sooner or later, cell phones begin to buzz and unchecked hooting and hollering can be heard by startled and well adjusted merlot drinkers two aisles over - it can only mean one thing: Nugget Nectar is here! I will admit, I was hyped on this beer before the first sip, and had very high expectations, all of which were met and then some with this hoppy, rich and balanced Imperial Amber ale. This beer is the Bo Jackson of brews - it can do anything. It can stand alone as a quiet sipping beer on a late winter evening. It can be drunk heartily as you watch your favorite sporting event. It is enjoyed by beer snobs and non beer snobs alike. If you find this, get it. And don't tell anyone, lest they break into your home and steal it. And be warned, if your friend steals your beer gets caught and I am on his jury. I will vote to acquit, as long as he promises to give me one.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,mattgreger,4.82,"Picked up this bottle at Capone's Bottle Shop in East Norriton, PA  The pour on this brew was a wonderfully clear, amber color. It had very nice, light tan , fluffy head. It left some great sticky lacing as the brew slides down the sides of the glass. The head had some nice retention.  The aroma is great from the start. I can detect some nice resiny pine aromas at the front, then a bit of malt that lighten the hops just enough to give this brew a nice balanced aroma. As it warms, it has a little bit of a boozy aroma finishes it off really well.  This is the first time I have had this brew. I from the name, I was expecting a huge hop brew, that might be kinda of hard to take. But I got something better. I got a brew with a wonderful hops flavor, but not overly bitter. As the brew warms, there are some great pine flavors that just come out and hit your taste buds, followed by a a nice bready/biscut like malt that just balances everything out. It makes the brew almost creamy.  This brew has a medium body, that is a bit slick and creamy. It has a nice carbonation that goes well with the small slap of alcohol warmth that comes with the brew. Its makes the mouth water for more after each sip.  This brew is great. It was hard to get my hands on, well at least the 22 that I got for this review. I can tell this brew is extremely fresh, and would recommend it to anyone, especially as fresh as this brew is. I would have to say this is one of my favorites thus far by Troegs, but I am sure they will impress me again. Great job.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,CrookedStill,4.32,"Pours a deep golden/amber with a dense foamy head that very slowly subsides.  Absolutely wonderful aroma. Lots of citrus and pine notes against a subtle malty sweetness.  Nice hop bite hits first. Follows the nose with pine and citrus that's balanced by a mild caramel sweetness. Finishes dry with a lingering bitterness that sits softly on the tongue. Very pleasant and little to know hint of the alcohol.  Nice medium body with a slightly low amount of carbonation that doesn't get in the way or mute the hops.  This is a wonderful beer that I'm very glad I got to the chance to try. Although I've only been able to try two brews from Tröegs (this one and Scratch #43), I have been throughly impressed by this brewery and look forward to having others from them in the future. Tons of hops that are balanced very well against a subtle caramel backbone. A wonderful Amber that's an even better IPA.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,dbossman,4.38,"A: Redish-brown hue with generous head and great retention; lacing is great  S: Bready malty backbone with the grapefruit, pineapple, and floral hop presence you expect; the hops just sit so nicely on top of the bready--sweet sugary bread--and caramel malts  T: Such a nice balance of the bready malts and the grapefruit and tropical hops--much more balanced than most hop-centric beers  F: Creamy mouth feel--one of the creamier hop-forward-non-cask beers I have ever had; the beer sits on top of the mouth so nicely after it has already gone down the hatch  O: Great beer; very balanced and delicious; alcohol is well masked and I can't say enough of how well-balanced and drinkable this beer is",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

This fades, leaving some lacing down the side of the glass.  Floral, fruity hops really define the aroma here, backed up by hints of caramel malt. This really smells great, it's hard to put it down.  As in the smell, the taste begins with a nice balance of floral hops and caramel sweetness. Some pleasant bitterness comes in for the finish.  Medium-bodied with good carbonation, the mouthfeel is just fine.  While I haven't tried lots of amber ales, this is certainly the best in my experience. Hops are clearly the star of the show, but they are not overpowering. I'll be looking for this one again.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,birderbeerer,4.47,"Clean, near-translucent amber with a two-finger white head.  Whoa! Super hops in the aroma. Beautiful. Sweet, blooming flowers, some citrus, mango, pine, and grass. Nice and clean and not really pungent but lush and fruity.  Taste follows the aroma. Juicy and clean hops rest on a solid amber malt body. The malts are rather dry and follow after the initial hops. The flavors all blend and complement each other very well. This seems like a perfect example of a craft beer. It's own identity in that it is an amber but also approaching a DIPA, and put together well and obviously with great care. The tastes are just so well blended. Very refreshing and clean.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

I'm digging this beer. The hops aren't over the top or bittering, but it's still hop forward. Earthy floral hops with just a little citrus. Malt definitely keeps the hops in check. The mouthfeel is thin. Could use a lot more carbonation. A little flat. NN is a tasty beer. The alcohol is well hidden. I imagine it would be better on tap.

694,15881,LiverDonor,4.62,"Nice looking amber color. This is only my second review and I'm already having a hard time with this ""appearance"" thing. It looks like, well.... beer and all beer LOOKS good, at least to me. I'm not hanging it on my living room walls or riding around with it in my Town Car. It all ends up yellow anyways!  It smells wonderful. Very fruity and floral. Like strolling through a peach orchard.  The taste is nothing less than divine. It's got that punchy peach/mango kind of flavor followed by the perfect amount of bitterness. Not detecting too much malt in there but somehow it seems very well balanced. Absolutely fantastic. I can't believe this is 7.5% ABV! I could easily drink too many of these in one sitting.  Mouthfeel is good too. Not watery but far from syrupy. Nice amount of carbonation.  In the past I've always been more into malty beers than hoppy ones. This was like my ""gateway drug"" into IPA's and hoppy brews. After I tried this I've been buying tons of hophead style singles at my local craft beer depot, Belmont Party Supply. Out of the nearly 30 different ones I've tried in the past month or so, this one is definitely in my top three favorites along with North Peak's Diabolical IPA and Victory's Hop Wallop.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

694,15881,zeledonia,4.33,"Pours golden-orange, perfectly clear, with a hefty off-white, slightly orange-hued head that lasts and last, and leaves a ton of lacing. Loads of little bubbles floating up through the glass. I know appearance doesn't count for all that much, but this beer is close to perfect.  Smell is all hops up front, but supported well by a solid light malt backbone. Citrus, pine, and floral hops, in that order. There's so much complex hop aroma that it's hard to pick out individual scents, but grapefruit is probably the most prominent. I've rarely encountered a beer with such a variety of good hop aromas together. Wow, this smells good. No bitterness or alcohol in the nose.  Taste is good, though not quite as good as the smell. I get a quick taste of some light, slightly sweet malts before the hops kick in. Again, it's mostly citrus and pine, with pine playing a bigger role here. Finishes slightly bitter.  Medium-light in the mouth, rather thin, but I like it that way. Medium-high carbonation that goes really well with the beer's flavors. Lingers for a bit, not too long, not too short.  This is clearly a highly-hopped amber ale. It has a great variety of hops, especially in the smell.

A - Beautiful, clear amber with frothy white 1 finger head. Dissipated quickly but left a nice cap with some light lacing.  S - Lots of juicy hops along with some nice citrus tones and balanced with some slight malt hints. Great aroma.  T & M - Very close to the smell. Starts out malty and sweet, and finishes with some hop bitterness. Very close to an IPA, but it's called an Imperial Amber. The extra maltiness balances well with the hops so that it's not a hop bomb, but close. Medium bodied and very drinkable. After it warms a bit, the alcohol and malt tend to come out of the woodwork and sneak up on you. Great beer.  Overall - very glad I got the chance to try it.

Appearance is a glorious clear sparkling amber with lots of carbonation rising up keep a very nice 1/4"" head on the beer throughout.  Aroma is very resiny with some light piney notes but a glaring tropical fruit explosion that is just off the charts in deliciousness. But wait - it's not all hops! There is a really nice sweet caramel maltiness in there as well - a welcome thing in most of these hoppy beers of late.  The taste starts off rather bland in the mouth with some piney notes before I swallow but immediately upon swallowing I am hit by the tropical fruit and more pine flavor with the malt sweetness kicking in for just a second before finishing bittersweet with a nice lingering juicy hop taste.  Mouthfeel is good, medium body, really smooth and slightly creamy.

A - Pours a clear dark amber with a generous head of sticky-looking white foam that leaves a TON of lacing clinging to the glass as it recedes. Gorgeous! S - Oh, baby! This is just what I want in a hoppy beer : sticky, resinous hop aromas of pine resin, grapefruit, mandarin orange, and pineapple with a crisp caramel malt backbone. T - Taste is spot on with the nose, more huge hop flavors of grapefruit, pine resin, tangerine, and pineapple with a sweet, malty caramel backbone. This is so well balanced between the hops and the malt, just an expertly crafted beer. M - Slightly sticky with a medium mouth-feel and fairly crisp carbonation.

But at two months this has a nice hop malt balance. First taste of citrus and pine, balanced by a sweet, sticky caramel malt. Not overly sweet, only a little alcohol detection.

694,15881,neophilus,4.34,"Poured from a 12oz bottle - a frothy white head eagerly erupts from the pour and climbs its way to the top of the glass. As it dies down it leaves a delicate web of lacing on the sides of the glass. The color has an amber hue, more on the orange side than yellow. Light shines through the beer clearly.  The smell of juicy hops greets my nose, gently backed up with a sweet malt aroma. The hop smell takes the lead though, I catch hints of grapefruit. The armoa is quite intoxicating actually - as it warms the malt sweetness lays down a rich base for the citrus hops to play on.  The taste is rather bitter at first, but a malty sweetness washes down the back of my palate and cleans up the bitterness. The pungent taste of citrus hops dances on the malt sweetness, reminiscent of the bitterness up front but not so overpowering after that malt has had a chance to tone things down.  The beer warms some more and the bite of the bitterness is somewhat lessened. The amber body of the beer begins to step forward and assert itself with a medium chewiness - neither thick or thin. Carbonation is perfect and the bubbles do not get in the way of the taste sensations.  This is a great beer - I love that it isn't a true IPA and the amber malt body is the perfect foil for the heavy IBU's this brew carries. The citrus hops take on a rich, juicy character when highlighted against the malt body that I find missing in most pale ales. The bitterness at first threatens to overpower the beer but with a little patience the true character begins to shine through.

Appearance: Awesome crystal clear orangish/amber matches the aroma very well. It has a nice white head that falls to a ring leaving a nice trail of lace.  Taste: Starts off with a hint of bitterness, but gets right to the caramel, malty sweetness and gradually builds in hop flavor. The real hopiness is in the aftertaste which comes off as bit piney and lingers just long enough. This beer definitely leaves you craving another taste.  Feel: Nice medium body, not too much carbonation, very drinkable.  Overall: Its got a really nice balance with enough of a hop punch to make you take notice and a sweetness that makes you want more.

The head is thick and creamy a retains a nice frothiness for some time after the pour. Bubbly lacing crops up all over the sides of the glass upon each sip. A very refreshing looking beer.  S: Sweet piney and resiny hops blast the nose up front, giving way a waft of sweet caramel malts hiding away in the background. You can smell this beer from a ways away and seems to draw you in with pleasant aromas of orange peel and tangerine.  T: Aggressive hops dominated by notes of thick pine resin, orange/lemon peel, come through up front making for a delightful blend of sweet, refreshing, and intriguingly earthy tastes. The beer departs the palate with slightly sweet notes of caramel malts and ends with a definitive crisp character. Surprisingly low bitterness in the aftertaste given the dominance of the hops.  M: Medium bodied with lively carbonation and a certain stickiness upon the lips. Clean and dry in the finish with a moderate warming sensation passes down the throat.

T: Rich, ""IPA"" flavor up-front, with a nice amber ale swallow. Grassy, pine tar, citrus flavors, with a toasted bread crust middle, and a nice floral aftertaste. Great balance of hops and malt keep this beer interesting.  M: This feels just right: robust enough without being off-putting, and gritty enough without feeling chewy.

M: Thinner than I remember, bitterness stays with little residual sweetness or oiliness.  O: What was once an all-time favorite tastes more like a generic quasi-corporate IPA. I cannot believe this is labeled as Nugget Nectar as it tastes nothing like I recall from the pre-Hershey years. This is one of the great disappointments in the expanding craft beer era, RIP Nugget Nectar. What happened to the robust, rich, sweet n bitter Imperial amber ale that I once loved? This beer is thin, lacks complexity, tastes one dimensional with too much residual bitterness and not enough luscious velvety sweetness. Another one bights the dust with expansion.

Sweet malt and hop bitterness in fairly even proportions. You get the sweet maltiness up front, touches of the floral and citrusy hops come midway, followed by that bitter hoppy aftertaste. Then a soft, dry finish as it fades away. Flavors are bold, but balanced. Nicely done.  Just mildly carbonated yielding a fairly soft mouthfeel.

Slap an off white half finger head and you got Nugget Nectar.  S - Malts first, citrus. Not an overpowering smell, really have to woft it in here.  T - There is no more appropriate name for this beer. Nectar definitions- 1. A sweet liquid secreted by flowers of various plants, consumed by pollinators, such as hummingbirds and insects, and gathered by bees for making honey. 2. Greek & Roman Mythology. The drink of the gods. 3. A delicious or invigorating drink. The beer tastes of wonderful citrus with an extremely balanced taste from malts. Very slight hint of a piny taste.  M - This beer goes down easy and hangs around in your mouth for awhile. The luscious liquid dissapears down my throat and the grapefuit bitterness hangs around minutes later. In a very good way.  O - So sad I don't have access to this beer. Next release I plan on trading for large quantities.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

S: Great complex fruit arrangement, honey and caramel malts, yeast. Notes of cherry and vanilla bean.  T: Big grapefruit and pineapple flavor up front, mild and fresh, and also floral hop bitterness, molasses, caramel malt. Very earthy body. Mildly fruity sweetness and citrus zest in aftertaste.  M: sticky, thick, and on the fruity side. Medium body with medium carbonation.  D: Absolutely delicious. A fantastic brew.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Pours slightly hazy deep golden amber/light orange color with a 1-2 finger dense and rocky off white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice dense foamy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of big red grapefruit, tangerine, lemon, peach, pineapple, apricot, passion fruit, mango, honeydew melon, berries, citrus peel/rind, wood, peppercorn, pine, honey, caramel, bread dough, toasted biscuit, light nuttiness, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness.

Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/fairly earthy hops and moderate dark/bready malt flavors; with an awesome malt/bitterness balance, and no cloying/astringent flavors after the finish. Light-moderate increasing dryness from lingering bitterness. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/bready/sticky, and fairly resinous/rindy balanced mouthfeel that is great. Minimal warming alcohol for 7.5%.

All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/tropical/fairly earthy hops and moderate dark/bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink for the ABV, with the mellowly bitter/resinous/drying finish; not aggressive. Fantastic Nugget, Warrior, Columbus, Simcoe, Palisade profile. Very juicy, vibrant, and fairly dank/earthy hops; with a great balancing dark/Munich malt backbone.

S - Initial smell is very citrus, with the dominant scent being grapefruit. Also detect a wonderful hop profile.  T - Taste is super citrusy, again with grapefruit being the most present taste. Very hoppy as well, complementing the citrus phenomenally well. An excellent tasting beer!  M - Not overly carbonated, with a more medium body. Very nice on the palate.

S - No lie, one of the best aromas on a beer, ever! Tons of resinous, sappy, piney hops along with pineapple, grapefruit and lemon. Basically a massive fruit salad of smells!  T - Juicy grapefruit and grassy, piney hops meld well with the doughy caramel malts. Actually pretty balanced as far as bitterness goes. Also, just a little spicy, almost rum-like kick.  M/O - For how much flavor is in this beer, it is still so easy to put back! Dry with a smooth, almost creamy mouthfeel. I really wish this beer was available year round.

Good lacing left on the top as well as down the glass as it drinks.  Smell: Citrus hops - mostly orange and grapefruit come through initially. Some floral hops come through at the end, but the smell is mostly citrus.  Taste: Huge citrus taste up front with an almost piny finish. Some toasted malts come through at the very end, but the hops are present throughout. For a beer that is technically not an IPA, this is about as close as you can get.  Mouthfeel: Medium body with a highly carbonated and creamy taste. The bitterness from the hops really never subsides at all.  Overall: Currently one of my favorite beers in the world. Had never had it before it's release this year, and have gone through about 3 cases so far. As long as it's on the shelves I will always buy it, and I am already looking forward to next years release.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Smell - This is what really sold me on this beer even before I tasted it. Very hoppy smell, with lots of citrus, and some pine aromas. Hints of fruity aromas as well.  Taste - Citrus and hops hit first with some caramel maltiness. Nice hop bite that stays on the tongue for a while, which keeps me coming back for more.  Mouthfeel - Very nice mouthfeel with moderate carbonation, and nice bitterness from the hops.  Drinkability - What and excellent brew. Thoroughly enjoyed this one from pour to the last sip. Very easy to drink even though it's 7.5%.

Through the middle there are more floral hops coming through with some really nice bitterness. The finish has a really nice balance of sweet caramel malt flavor and citrus and floral hops and some nice bitterness that lingers.  M - Medium bodied with moderate lively carbonation.

M - Slightly creamy mouthfeel, but there's a bit of bitterness that lingers on the tongue that it slightly disappointing.  Overall, a fantastic beer.

Underneath it is a crazy amount of carbonation streaming from the bottom of the glass and sticking to the side. Some slow moving lacing and slight alcohol feet on the side of the glass.  S- Up front you get some really nice grassy and earthy hop notes with a nice sweet citrus profile behind it. Definitely some tropical fruits in there as well.  T- Wow. Strong citrus and fruity hops up front that fades into a nice bitter earthy hop profile that I assume makes this beer so great. The citrus is almost a little bit to much for me, has that lemon pledge flavor that I'm not a big fan of. But the bitterness and grassy flavors make up for it big time. Also pretty happy that it's not to malt forward like most hopped up beers. The malts are subtle and light and don't take away from the main attraction of this beer. Definitely perfectly balanced.  M- Medium lighter body with a good amount of carbonation and a really nice strong bitter finish.  Overall I understand the hype of this beer but like i stated above I really don't like hopped up beers that overdo it on the citrus to the point where it tastes like cleaner or a summer wheat beer.

There's also a code # but it is smeared and illegible. Served cold in a standard pint glass.  A: Clear dark amber brew with 1/2"" of ivory head.  S: Huge super fruity tropical aroma, wow. A ton of fresh apricot, then coconut and mango. Sweet and juicy but not cloying or overly thick. Again, wow. Fantastic.  T: Taste leads with a big bite of generic bittering hop, a bit jarring and unexpected after the rich fruity smell. My palate adjusts after a few sips. The fruity tropical stuff is present but takes a back seat to the raw bitterness. Sweetness is subdued and a bit dry like scorched caramel.  M: Mostly dry with a long dry finish. Bittering hop lingers for quite a while. Slight peppery EtOH on my breath.  D: I really wish this tasted more like the smell. Cut back on the bittering hop and the alcohol, make this as a fruit bomb and it'd be super interesting. 7.5% ABV is a bit small to be called ""Imperial"".",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Tons of citrus hop notes up front. Some floral notes in the background with a good amount of malt that also makes its presence known.  T - I am loving this beer. Toasted malts combine with a very nice multifaceted hop presence. Citrus and floral flavors linger never leave your palate imparting a strong, but not overpowering bitterness.

Sort of more of an IPA but I'm down with any brewery that calls this an Amber, cuz this is what a brewery's amber should taste like. Props to Moose's Tooth up in the AK for recognizing this as well. Light amber in color, a long lasting sexy foamy head. Some sweet malt, some toasty malt, some caramel, a bunch of juicy hops, citrus galore with a little floral.

694,15881,chumba526,5,"Thanks to JPWV for this beer, Thanks for getting this though they do not distribute to your state.  It appears dark orange and translucent there is a small off white head.  It smells of grapefruit, sweet caramel, grassy hops. There is also a slightly spicy hop flavor as well. It smells amazing. It has a bold smell, but it is not overwhelming.  It tastes initially of sweet smooth caramel malt. The sweetness is good because it is not overly strong. I also get a slight bread like malt flavor. The malt flavor of the beer is bold but it does not take away from the hop flavor. There is a wonderful grassy slightly citrusy hop flavor that goes perfectly with the malt flavor. The blend of the malt and hop flavor is fantastic. The beer ends with a subtle hoppy bitterness that is balanced with a nice malty sweetness.  There is a crisp but somewhat thick mouthfeel to this beer.

694,15881,JohnnyS17,4.53,"Okay, so I am trying to get into hoppy beers and a friend suggested Nugget Nectar as a good kick off beer. He has not let me astray yet, so hopefully this is no different.  The pour yielded just under an inch of creamy, tan head. The beer is a gorgeous red/amber. Just after opening the bottle I can immediately smell the sweetness and hoppiness. The blend is enticing and a balanced aroma. After it is poured I can detect further hints of sweetness like cherries . Additionally, there is a definite earthy pine smell. Great lacing throughout the beer.  The first sip bombards you with a sweet fruity taste with a honey hint that lasts while you hold the beer in your mouth. Upon drinking down the beer a piney, hop tastes subsides the sweetness and leaves your mouth crisp and slightly dry. It's like drinking a two course beer. You can tell a lot of time was put into balancing the tastes. The beer seems thin at first, but a few swishes around it appears to have a medium-light consistency.  Superbly crafted and refreshing. My friend gave me a great jump-off beer for my dive into the hoppy world of beers I have thus avoided in my life.

There is some bitterness but not much I get nice citrus and pine taste without the palate over load. Nicely done.  Mouth feel is medium. A little abrasiveness as it moves through the mouth but not much. It has a nice resin that sticks to the palate and leaves a touch of hops bitterness.

Love the body, but I would expect better head retention.  S: Big hop nose... grapefruit, pine, resinous, acrid, a bit of floral/perfume, and hints of spices. Malt is way down below and is of the lightly toasted, sticky sweet caramel variety. A varied and delicious nose, shown off very well in my brand new Speigelau Tulip :)  T: The sweet, toasted, almost smoky caramel meets you up front, quickly followed by piney, resinous hops, finishing on a blend of the two. Both flavors simultaneously fill your mouth from corner to corner. All in all, a great balance between sweet creamy caramel and resiny hops.  M: Perfect middleweight... satisfying, yet not too heavy. I could perhas use a bit more texture to hold on to, but as it is, it sure makes for some easy drinking.

Fruity, deep, malty backbone that isn't too sweet but firm enough to support the massive hop note. Fun pineapple note. Drinkability is incredible considering the IBUs for a non hop head. Mouthfeel is top notch -- smooth, fruity, and of course, juicy hops round out on the palate. Finish is not too dry and certainly doesn't leave the ""hop burn"" that some heavier hop brews leave in the mouth. Very tasty indeed.

Definitely just like a good IPA. But then something interesting happens. It fades away quickly, revealing a nice bready maltiness as it finishes. No real lingering bitterness at all. Maybe the cleanest IPA type beer I've ever had. Excellent.  I'm a huge fan. Too bad we don't get this here. Quite simply one of the most drinkable and delicious hoppy beer I know of.

Appearance: There is a pure, almost orange amber glow to this beer. The head leaves great lacing, especially on the second pour of the bomber.  Aroma: Nice hop strength, nice malt sweetness, but neither of them go too far, which creates an almost tangerine citrus scent. I love how this beer seems to go just short of being too much.  Taste: The hops, with a citrus rind bitterness, wash in right away, but as the beer settle on your palette, the malty, almost carmel bun malt sweetness kicks in to temper the hops. Umm, this beer is so pungent, yet so restrained.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: So the old mouthfeel comes into play big time on this beer. It has a very light body for an imperial style beer. At 7.5%, it is indeed big, but by no means huge. The lightness allows these robust flavors to leave their mark in a much different way than thicker, hoppy imperial reds or ipas.

In the taste, lots of hops, lots of sweetness which I typically do NOT like but in this case proved the interesting bit of this beer. Complex but not balanced.

Pours a beautiful deep orange color with a 1 finger white head that recedes quickly leaving a nice lacing.  Smell: The hopback and dry hopping work wonders on this beast. There is a nice pungent hoppy smell that I wish I could have all year round. Nice tropical and citrus flavors fill my nose, it makes me smile every time.  Taste: The taste this year seems superior to me as compared to last year. For all of the IBUs Nugget Nectar has the bitterness is hidden behind the great tropical hop flavors. This beer is nice and sweet but contains the perfect amount of dryness to balance it out.  Mouthfeel: It could be a little more carbonated, but really not by much. Nugget Nectar is medium bodied which fits perfectly.  Overall: I love this beer and will likely buy a case and a couple six packs each year like I did this year.

S-smells like honey and hops. smells creamy as well. medium strength  T-comes in with a good hit of honey and hops. very tasty and well balanced. has a great pronounced after-taste of hops. i've been excited to try this for awhile. to be honest, its good, but i feel the only reason people rate it so high is because its probably the best example of a red ale. In my opinion, it shouldn't be considered a red ale, it should be an IPA. as an IPA, it is certainly wonderful, just not one of the greatest.  M-great medium carbonation with a dry finish  D-wonderful. i definitely could've had this all night and i look forward to our next meeting.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Enjoyed on 03/20/11.  A - What an excellent looking beer, one of the best I've seen. Red/amber color, perfectly clear, two finger bone white head that leaves an incredible wall of lace around the glass. Small head with large bubbles stays for the duration.  S - Grapefruity, piney resin hops and a very nice malt character as well. Somewhat nutty with a good candy sweet aroma. The hops still dominate for sure though even after a little while in the bottle.  T - I find this beer to be perfectly balanced. Very nice and sugary sweet with a great fruity hop bitterness initially. Then comes a more piney hop flavor and an incredibly dry finish. I could drink this stuff all day.  M - The mouthfeel is good for an amber beer, but for an imperial, as it states on the bottle, it may be just a tad thin.  O - I loved this beer. This is a must-trade-for each and every year after this.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

694,15881,tr0n,4.38,"Nugget Nectar pours a beautiful amber into the glass. Nose displays clear hop smell, but muted due to the malt character of the beer. This beer drinks very smooth with a light apricot flavor, with the hops adding a slight bite that adds crispness to an otherwise very smooth taste. As the beer warms the hop character is diminished, but the hop bite is still felt in the aftertaste.  This excellent beer is very balanced, and the stronger malt character differentiates it well from what would otherwise be a good IPA.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

S: As most people have said, the initial smell is a piny outdoor smell followed by complex florals.  T: Ridiculous. I found the Hop/Malt balance perfect. The piny, hoppy florals take your taste buds for a ride. The true taste was found at the back of my tongue.  M: Nice, crispy. Nothing overpowering and incredibly smooth for an Imperial Amber/Red. Perfect carbonation.  O: If I could have one beer that took up real estate in my fridge, this might just be it...could be the alcohol talking, but truly one of a kind.

Great piny hops on the nose and very front of the palate, followed by the crisp carbonation and perfectly balanced malts that make this one of the smoothest most delicious beers I've ever had. After I swallowed, the hops lingered just long enough for me to literally crave more, and the bottle (22oz) was gone within 5 minutes. I couldn't nurse this beer if I tried.  I don't work for Troegs.

Beautiful deep orange/amber color on the pour with a fluffy off-white head that stuck around for a while. Smells very hoppy, which is nice considering it's not a very fresh bottle at this point - with some mild floral notes.  Taste is just divine: beautiful balance of hops and caramel malt, just like Bogey and Bacall. I guess he was the hops, for what it's worth. Mouthfeel is smooth, no bitter or bland aftertaste.

Smell: The beer has a nice strong and sweet resin smell to it. The beer also hasa aa bit of a citrus, pine, and orange note to it.  Taste: HOPS!! I taste pine, citrus and a hint of grapefruit. I also get some sweet flavor which I think may be malts, which balance out the hops really well.  Mouthfeel: Very light carbonation on the tongue to the point where there isn't any. The beer itself is a medium bodied and smooth ride all the way to happy town.  Overall: I will say that this is actually a pretty good beer to have every once and a while. It looks good, smells good and tastes good. The price itself isn't too shabby either.

T - Citrus and piney hops up front before some sweet caramel malts come in to balance it out. A slight bitterness lingers in the aftertaste. Definitely straddles the line between an amber and an IPA.  M - Light to medium bodied and slightly below average carbonation. Very drinkable, but much hoppier than other amber ales I've had.  Overall, an enjoyable beer, but very different given the style.

Taste is a hopheads wet dream, huge pine and citrus flavours with a nice dose of bitterness. This hop profile is very flavorful not just in your face bitter.

694,15881,TheBrewo,4.54,"We pour a brew of deep golden orange, not dissimilar to the color of the label. The pale yellow head stands two fingers high, and is of big, sticky bubbles. They cake the glass all the way around as the head disappears at a medium pace. While the beer isn't hazy, and no sediment is noted, the translucency is not complete. Carbonation looks to be fairly active. The aroma explodes with floral, somewhat grassy hops up front. There is a strong fruity, nectar-like sweetness about it, with notes of honey, strawberry, and passion fruit. As the beer warms the alcohol increases in presence. The hops also add wisps of citrus that float to the back of the nose. As we sip, flowery hops hit first. These are accompanied by fresh tropical fruits, with a heavy sweetness that really digs into the tongue. This acts to carry the flavors to the middle, where sugary sweetness runs with biting citrus, all contained within a hop-whirl. The taste evens out towards the end, and the hops cool down to take on an earthiness, with a bit of lingering bitterness. The aftertaste breathes of fresh hops that are bittering and sweet. The barky earthiness is also retained, but so is some fruit. It is like licking a sap covered, tropical fruit bearing, hop bush, in the best way. The body is medium and the carbonation is medium. The bubbles create a heavy froth to each sip. The sweetness and hops on the other hand lend a syrupy feel, which leaves the mouth partially coated, and happily wet and satiated. The abv is slightly above average as the beer is an ""Imperial"", but it is hidden expertly.  Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was the aroma. It was as hoppy as promised, but included some wonderfully fruity, sweeter notes, to cut any bitterness that may have been presented otherwise. Not only was the aroma refreshing, but the taste followed through to attest to the aromas boasted for. The feel was creamy and smooth, and made drinking this beer, which is a standout for the style, that much easier.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

S- Hop lovers dream. Heavy pine and floral notes. Citrusy, but all scents work together and do not overwhelm.  T- The hops and malt compliment one another here. Spicy hop flavors are immediate with a slight sweetness from the malt. Leaves a slight bitter finish that is rather nice. Well balanced beer here for the hop lovers. A VERY slight alcohol burn is noticed after the finish, but that should be expected at 7.5% ABV.  M- Clean and crisp. Enough said. But really, this beer drinks very clean and smooth.

Non-overpowering hops are immediately noticed, followed by spices. A slight hoppy bitterness is detected near the end but fades quickly. The 7.5% ABV is not noticable in the least.  This beer is not crisp and refreshing as one would assume. Instead it is very creamy and somewhat sticky. Not a bad thing, but definitely different for the style.

694,15881,ThePorterSorter,4.25,"Appearance: Red amber with a coppery shine in the light. A thick and fluffy yellow-tinted head of approximately 2 fingers. How appropriate that I'm listening to black and yellow while I unwind and write this review. The beer is looking good, nice and rich with good carbonation...exactly what I want in an amber ale on a night like this.  Smell: I have smelled beers hoppier than this, but this is still quite hoppy. Sweet, bitter, and spicy with a little bite from the alcohol. This beer comes off like a wine, complex oils playing off a rich amber malt. I definitely appreciate the fact that they have pushed the limits on a drinkable imperial amber, but have still salvaged some of the beer for me to smell and taste while drinking.  Taste: Heavenly hops with delicious balance between the bitter and sweet on my palate. Definitely a beer I could drink all night and not get sick of. The ragingly spicy hops followed by a sticky and bitter aftertaste. The entire sip is clean and doesn't leave a gross aftertaste...my kind of beer. In fact, I am already on my second pint by this point in the review.  Mouthfeel: Crisp, bitter, medium bodied beer with a good aftertaste that coats the palate and leaves me satiated after each sip. It is definitely on the border between what I desire in an IPA and what is over the top, but I appreciate its intensity. This is definitely not a watery beer, the alcohol is potent and the malt is there to match. Damn tasty imperial amber that feels great to drink down.  Drinkability: Value wise, this beer is overpriced, but worth trying. The growler fill was about $14, so it's clearly a better buy for a six pack. However, the beer was quite tasty and worth sampling nonetheless. I have respect for a beer that is as strong as this one, as most similar IPAs tend to be 7 pushing 9%abv, but sometimes I do prefer to have a beer I can drink a few of before being unable to operate heavy machinery...thankfully I'm sitting at home writing a review only using light machinery so I can continue to drink more beer.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Citrus and sweet notes tickle your senses.  T - Great fresh hop taste with just the right amount of bitter. You can get just a hint of alcohol if you focus your pallet enough towards the back-end. Does not tire your taste buds.  M - Not to thin or to syrupy. Light on the throat with a full body structure  D - This is a fantastic brew that always gets me exited for the first and the second and so on. The bitterness is low enough to not become overwhelmed but the taste is so pure and fresh that having another goes without saying.

Sparce, yet quality lacing.  smell; upfront quite sweet but fizzles out to very herbal and spicy hops. Hops dominate but an exceptable balance is present.  taste; at first resiny hops, then an odd sweetness from the malts. Very spicy hops in the finish, mostly a bitter hoppy beer but not enough so to be an IPA, the balance is much better but still off.  mouthfeel; very froathy carbonation, with a medium body and slick finish.  drinkability; hop bitters are just annoying, one is enough. I was really let down by this beer. Unless one is a hophead, I suggest to avoid this brew.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,DeanMoriarty,4.06,"Picked up an 22oz bomber in a trade with Dawson's Liquor in Severna Park, MD and poured it into a tulip glass - thanks fellas!  A: Pours a clean orangish copper hue with an amazing head that dissipates slightly but sticks around for the entire glass leaving solid lacing from start to finish.  S: Good amount of fresh grain and sweet malt up front, grassy hop, a bit of citrus and a slight hint of apricot, peach or the likes.  T: Man, one of the best Ambers i've ever had - no lie! Not generally a big fan, but it came highly recommended by a person who's taste I generally side with. Very fresh tasting - nice grainy flavor, sweet malt and tropical fruit followed up with and balanced nicely with a good amount of earthy mossy hop.  M: Medium-bodied, sticky with a mellow carbonation (maybe could have been a bit more), with a noticeable bitterness from the hop.

Some vague hints of nuts-- probably walnuts.  Taste: bruising hops, slight alcohol at finish. Aftertaste is a complex mix of hops.  Mouthfeel: While swirling, it's like liquified fir. After swallowing, the mouth feels as of it's been evacuated of all moisture. Nice, light carbonation.  Drinkability: Extremely tasty, very drinkable, a great one to find cold in the fridge.

S- Wowzer. lots of piney, citrus. lemon, orange peel...wow. A touch of bready malt sweetness intermingles with all of the hops.  T/M- Wowie wow. Keeps getting better! Awesome creamy, almost cream soda like, fluffy body. Coats the palate and makes you think there's gonna be a lingering finish. All of the hoppy smells comes through in spades, but the malts make a showstopping entrance up front- Toasty biscuit and sweetbread like character. Nice grainy texture which the piney, citrus and slight grapefruit flavors play very nicely off. There's even a touch of vanilla like sweetness from the malts and a rye like spiciness from the alcohol in the middle. As it travels from front to back there's a slight prickling on your tongue from the bitter hops, carbonation and alcohol combo. Finishes with a bit of spicy rye, baked caramel cookies, drying grapefruity hop bitterness which mops everything up.  D- Wowfest. This beer is freaking awesome. I would ask it to bear my children if I thought it would have me. Alas, I must be content to drink of it's succulent Nectar- and content I am.

694,15881,ajfa531,4.28,"12 oz bottle. Bottled on 1-20-11. Basically 50 days ago. I contemplated not reviewing it until next year, but, I think it's still tasting awesome. Maybe lacking a bit in the nose. I can always update this.  Poured into my Duvel tulip.  Deep red-orange with a finger-sized head. A calmer pour tonight. The head recedes to a ring with some sheets across the top. Held up to the light brings out the orange. A nice looking beer.  A piney nose with slight citrus. (I found a cap from 2 weeks ago that still held an aroma of orange and tangerine.) Definitely piney resin. Some grapefruit - moreso as it warms. Sweet malts and slight toasty malt notes. Small, small alcohol notes. The ""lack of freshness"" probably hurts this area the most.  Grapefruit bitterness is the most present flavor for me. The malts are there, but, slightly out of my reach. Maybe I can't taste tonight. However, since the bitterness starts strong and finishes weak, I know that this beer is balanced. The malts in the finish remind me of an ESB malt profile. Definitely, a toasty flavor. Maybe biscuit or Munich malt. The color is telling me Munich. Tiny reminders of Marzen beer. It doesn't matter it's good.  Medium body. The remaining sugars and the resinous in the mouthfeel contribute a lot. It stays nicely. I'm in no rush to rinse it away. Unless it's with more of this beer.  Very drinkable. I could easily put away a six in a sitting if the alcohol doesn't knock me out. This beer goes down too quickly.  Very glad I'm in a heavily distributed area.

The taste is bitter with notes of citrus/grass at first, like an IPA, but definitely finishes more true to style. Nice carmel right before the finish, which is of hop.

S - I could spell this one from the pour without getting close to it. Very nice citrus hop nose. I can pick up apricot, peach, and grapefruit. There is a syrupy pine sweetness to it as well.  T & M & D - Hoppy without a bitter bite. There are fruit flavors of grapfruit, some orange and other citrus notes. The pine is in the taste and there is a carmalized malty sweetness on the tounge. There is a little bit of bread flavor on the middle. The taste finishes smootha nd does not leave a sour back throat feel. Incredibly smooth and very well balanced.

Bottled: 1/18/11 at 11:45am  A: Out of my 22 oz. bomber, I slow-poured the beer into my Dogfish Head tulip. Very minimal head stayed around as I poured glass number one. The bubbly head that stayed remained on the borders of the glass. Quite a bit of lacing hung around too as I took a few generous sips. The body reminds of Jurassic Park. I say this because in Jurassic Park they find a mosquito preserved in amber. The body of Nugget Nectar withholds the same characteristic. Call me crazy! I've only had 6 sips!  S: Unripened apricot/peach and hops bombard me as I sniff from atop my glass. What lies beneath is what intrigues me more. I'm happy in that my nose smells more than just a hopped up brew that boasts the addition of nectar in its title.  T: Floral hops that have been laced with apricots/peaches make themselves known right off the bat.  M: Mildly syrupy in the beginning with a crisp, clean, and a dry-hoppy finish in the end.

A: This is a beautiful brew. I noticed how it wasn't labeled as an IPA or DIPA, but rather an Imperial Amber. After pouring, I'm glad it's classified as such. The body is a gorgeous, crystal clear amber color with a nice frothy white head. Plenty of lacing on this baby.  S: Heavenly. Mostly grapefruit hop scent. Not too pungent, but just right.  T: Wow. This is where she shines. Up front you get the perfect amount of grapefruit hop bitterness, and it's followed by a clean malty backbone. Alcohol is there, but the hops mask the initial burn perfectly. It's probably one of the most balanced beers I've had yet. Delightful.  M: This is one that stands out. Most of the times hoppy beers leave my mouth very dry, but this one wets the palette. It leaves a nice watery feeling in your mouth.  D: Dangerously drinkable.

Head reached about 2 inches and receded but left a bubbly thin covering. Sticky lacing.  S - Immediate citrus aroma smelling of grapefruit. Seems to be a bit of sourness as well. Piney.  T - Strong grapefruit taste with a good deal of tart fruit behind it. Hop bitterness of course but not overwhelming at all. Just a bit of sweetness. Perhaps a bit of peach in there as well.

694,15881,SirRuss,4.35,"Massive respect to the man who made two cases of East Coast's finest miraculously appear on my LA doorstep.Let the ""Rhettroactive East Coast Series"" begin....  A - The deep copper body boasts crystal clarity, and a solid, dirty-white head. The retention is less robust than I had hoped, but it still remains respectable to the last, and is accompanied by exemplary lacing.  S - Although I have yet to experience this analogy first hand, I will safely assume that the aroma is like having a prize grapefruit catapulted into your face...just less painful...presumably. Somewhere in the dazed confusion of recovery, flashes of bread and citrus wisp about as though the attending paramedic had hurriedly stuffed his interrupted lunch of marmalade sandwiches into his top pocket.  T - Beautifully balanced. Soft malts serve up light slices of bready flavors, and the bittering hops to provide a lavish topping. Grapefruit, orange rind, and pine intermingle with a background of juicy papaya notes, and a deep primal earthiness adds a rustic layer of old mushroom box on the finish.  M -The carbonation is lively, sharp, and well matched to the acidity. A creamy body lends substance, the alcohol is all but imperceivable, and the overall effect is a harmoniously full mouthfeel.  D - Nugget Nectar is quite simply a seriously solid amber ale. It isn't the most complex of profiles, but it's by no means one dimensional, and the intensity and contrast scream out character. The only lacking aspect that causes disappointment, is this brews availability on the West Coast.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Phelps,4,"Received from hophead101 in the Blind Beers BIF. This here's a 12-ouncer, poured into a tulip and reviewed blind.  The liquid's a handsome light caramel color with perfect clarity. Atop sits a foamy, one-finger head of khaki bubbles that dissipate at a moderate pace, leaving a moderately-sized and sticky ring along with some clingy strips of lace.  The nose is a good blend of fruity hops and nutty malt. I'm getting lots of juicyfruit along with honey, orange peel, hints of basil, some caramel and roasted almond.  Hops lead the flavor as well, with juicyfruit, grapefruit and a newly-emerged herbal character that reminds of mint and basil leaves. Pithy bitterness swoops in at the swallow and remains on the tongue between sips. The malt has been relegated to the background, but the notes of toasted sourdough and light almond are enough to offer some semblance of balance.  Medium-light in body, but with a nice silkiness that makes it seem more substantial than it is. A soft carbonation causes the beer to fizz up just a little bit as it moves about. Alcohol is only slightly noticeable as a warming in the throat.  The hoppiest of amber ales. I've had a few sips of this beer on occasion, but this bottle's given me the best flavor I've ever gotten from it. Bright, sweet hops backed with just enough malt, and letting it warm up a few degrees brings added complexity.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,MaxSpang,4.18,"Served in a 1 pt 6 oz. bottle in a pint glass.  A - Beautiful clear amber/honey color in the glass.

Slight maltiness with floral tones. There was also a very subtle honey aroma.  T - Much maltier than expected, especially after smelling it. Very excellent smooth flavor, there's a lot of hop flavor but not a lot of hop bitterness. Some pine flavor with a good amount of floral honey flavor, especially after it sits and warms up a bit. Very balanced between bitterness and sweetness.  M - Very smooth, it starts fairly carbonated but loses the bubbles after a few minutes. It doesn't feel as full-bodied as other imperial beers, and it's very easy to drink.  D - Very drinkable! Not too heavy, not too light. None of the flavors dominate the other one.  Side note - I had this beer with a fried Walleye dinner, and it tasted EXCELLENT with it!

694,15881,dgfair,3.8,"12 oz bottle poured into Golden Monkey snifter  Beer pours a golden copper color with a big white head that leaves beautiful lacing all over the glass. Not quite amber in color, but still a nice looking beer. The smell is fantastic with tons of pine and citrus in the nose. Probably the most aggressive aroma of both pine and citrus that I have smelled in one beer. There is a non-descript sweetness that balances the hops...it's almost sugary in nature. The taste is nice and bitter up front, but comes up a little too sweet in the back. Brown sugar and simple syrup that leave it a little cloying even with all the hops in there. Even with the sweetness and the hops, the taste is very empty to me and doesn't provide a lot of the nice complexity of some of the best hop bombs. Drinkability is decent but an oily mouthfeel and an oversweet finish leave me wanting a little more from this brew.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,farrago,4.3,"Large, close to three finger head, mostly tan to eggshell white froth and medium-sized bubbles, above average retention, the lacing breaks into thin streaks and splotches but stays put thereafter. Spotless metallic zinc to copper color, as orange as red, multiple beads of active bubbles stream upwards. Sweet honey, pine, rose petals and then pineapple, nectarine, peach fruit blossom into the nose, the more bitter herbaceousness does not swing the pendulum too far in the other direction, the tangerine and grapefruit notes stick in the middle ground, slight cocoa to mocha powder maltiness before it all dissolves, does an excellent job of expressing hoppiness without any burn. Medium-bodied, semi-creamy texture with gently massaging carbonation, freshening lift too. Here the more tart tangelo, pink grapefruit fully equal to the pineapple, apricot, peach, apple fruit. At the same time the dusty cocoa, chocolate adds to its general dryness and erect posture. This not to ignore the quiet presence of cane sugar, molasses and caramel.

Has an orangey/amber look to it. Head was a little off white, dissipated quickly. When you smell it, the hops punch you in the face reminds you of an IPA. Very smooth for a beer with a higher IBU. Can definitely feel the strong alcohol content. Has a dry malty taste to it, which is expected when dealing with a higher IBU. Not for your typical non-beer drinker. Overall, not quite what I was expecting but it's still a great beer. I would highly recommend this beer for anyone who enjoys IPAs.

The khaki colored head tops out at over three fingers in height, before displaying above average retention and coating the glass with sticky rings of lace. The nose is almost entirely a hop bomb, much more pine and resinous notes than anything citrus. I'm actually a little bit disappointed that there's no more than a faint whiff of caramel, I was expecting a little more of a malt presence for an amber. The malt really steps it up on my palate though, as there is a fairly solid dose of caramel up front. That's quickly run over by hops though, as a fairly powerful bitterness punch clears the way for lots of sticky, resiny, piny hop goodness. As with the aroma, there's a lack of maltiness in the body, the beer is a little dry. Carbonation is fine though, cuts through what sweetness there is and elevates the hops without becoming fizzy.

Poured oily looking and very clear dark copper-amber with a good head, retention and lacing. Smell was big on tropical fruit, especially pineapple, with some citrus undertones. The fruitiness was accentuated by sweet smelling malts but plenty of fresh mint like character was present to balance it in a nice way.  The fruity character of aroma was present in the taste as well: smoothly bitter blending well with the sweet malts, the puckering sensation was absent in this one. Sweet oranges and pineapple! Clean flavors of light fruit and a medium finish with lingering bitterness. As it warmed, a spicier character emerged that is not to the best of my liking. Warming to some degree, but very clean finishing with the right body and right amount of cleansing carbonation. Drinks like a killer!

694,15881,coldmeat23,4.42,"GLASS: Troegenator Dimpled Mug TEMP: Cellared @ approx 45 degrees Thanks to Deuane for hooking us up with the NN love, down here in Tulsa!  This pours a beautiful, medium shade of deep amber in color. It is crystal clear. It has a loose, foamy head that is slightly tan tinted in color. It starts at almost a fingers thickness, then recedes to a decent sized surface covering layer. Lacing is in mostly thick strands which are sticky enough to hang around for a little while.  Loads of citrus and tropical fruits burst out of this one. Grapefruit, mango, pineapple, tangerine, lemon, light hints of peach, it just goes on and on. Light hints of pine and caramel try to peek through.  Much like the nose, except that all of the fruit flavors have been dipped in pine oils and drizzled with pine sap. There is a very brief appearance by some caramel notes, around 2/3rds of the way through the sip. It opens back up to hops for a lightly drying finish.  This has a medium body and a medium level of carbonation, as well. it has a slight touch of creaminess to it, yet also has a slight stickiness, which is really nice. The finish still manages to be crisp. Impressive.  This is actually a very balanced beer. The big thing that it has going for it, in my opinion, is that it's completely packed with hop flavor, yet manages to forego a lot of the hop bitterness. This is very appealing to me, as I'm keen on hop flavors, especially tropical and citrus, but don't really care for the bitterness. The 7.50%abv is also nowhere to be found here, which only ads to it's drinkability.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Vdubb86,4.12,"Served in a Sam Adam's Perfect Pint Glass  Thanks to hannydawg for hooking me up with this want  This beer pours a nice clear amber color with a fluffy white foam head on the surface. The aromatics are nice and piny with a touch of grapefruit to make them wonderful on the nose. The taste is actually well balanced for a hoppy amber ale. There was a decent light caramel flavor to match the grapefruit and pine. The mouthfeel was a little on the dry side, which I'm not particularly used to when it comes to this style, but then again many offering in this style don't tend to be very hoppy. This drink very well and I would have no problem handling a sixer of this if only it weren't 7.5 ABV.

Superb balance between the hops and malts. Nice bready aftertaste and rich, toasted, caramel flavors. Much less hoppy than the smell would lead you to believe. Very well built for the style.

Smell: This one is going to be hoppy. I feel like I just stuck a Christmas tree up my nose.  Taste: Full of flavor, sweet and very fruity. Definite peach to apricot flavor. The interesting thing about this beer is that the strong hop taste comes at you like a bullet, but moves away just as quick. I feel like I'm hurrying through one sip just to get to the next.  Mouthfeel: It coats the mouth but is not a heavy beer. Only a slight (read = pleasant) hoppy aftertaste.  Drinkability: Very drinkable, especially for the 7.5% ABV.

Clear, very clear, amber color that looks how you expect an amber ale to look. After an aggressive pour the beer yielded a nice 2 inch off white head that was bubbly and frothy. Head fades to a ring of lace yet fails to leave any on the side, oh well still a beautiful beer  S- This beer has one of the greatest smells I have ever smelt! Huge HUge grapefruit and orange aromas with just a hint of bread. If I was blindfolded I would have thought I was about eat a big ripe grapefruit just unbeleivable.  T- Nice balance of the huge grapefruit taste with some bread coated with a thin layer of caramel. I would have liked more of that grapefruit but that is the IPA lover in me coming out. Overall a great balance of flavors, really hoppy but yet not really.  M- nothing really special here which is not a bad thing. Im not really thinking about it so its not distracting which keeps your mind on the great taste and smell. I would call it light to medium light bodied.

Something about the hop presence in beers from the East just seems to be so balanced without too much of a hop bite. Don't get me wrong, love bitterness but this beer has a great aroma profile that follows through with the flavor without being too forward. Granted it's an Amber and not an IPA, i love the balanced hop presence of citrus fruits, pineapple, lemon, ect. Just as the name describes it pours a very clear amber with a thin white head, and all the hop aroma and sweet caramel malts pour through the nose.

The only thing that keeps this from being a 5 is the fact that the 1"" head, while white and fluffy, fades quickly. It does provide decent lacing while it exists.  S: Seems to be all hops in the aroma, with equal parts pine and citrus dominated by grapefruit. Almost no smell of the malt in this at all.  T: Very closely mirrors the nose - taste is primarily hops, with grapefruit and pine, with a hint of malt on the finish. It is perhaps *just* a bit more pine-forward than I'd like, but it is not a real detriment to this excellent beer.  M: Has a medium mouthfeel with appropriate carbonation, and a dry finish, which I'm not necessarily a fan of, hence the score.  D: This is an extremely easy to drink Amber Ale. There is no hint of the alcohol in this at all, and for around $10 a six pack, this is a great value.

The nose on this thing it super hoppy, with little malt backbone to be found. A plethora of hops gives me a profile consisting of citrus, a bouquet of fresh flowers, spice and a distinct earthiness.  The taste has a distinct grapefruit character that is really quite pleasant; especially in the aftertaste. It is very floral and has more of a malt backbone than the nose lets on to, which helps keep the hops at bay.

694,15881,CliffBrake,4,"Bright, copper-amber color with a modest white head that leaves some lacing on the glass.  Piney and citrusy hops on the nose yield to a big hop flavor. Juicy mouthfeel with a peppery finish. Very drinkable and smooth.

694,15881,dannywest26,4.84,"12oz bottle Poured into a DogFish tulip glass  Appearance is a deep amber with a finger of tan head that dissipates quickly. Smell is lots of hops and lots of malts and lots of amazing. Taste is a punch in the mouth of hop flavor that slowly melts away to a wonderful amber malt sweetness with the slightest hint of alcohol in the end. Mouthfeel is smooth and bubbly and nothing but a bunch of love for the mouth. Drinkability, I would not feel bad about having one or two of these in a night but they are slow sippers that deserve to be savored and loved.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,CraftAleRookie,4.1,"Served in a tulip glass at the Washington House.  Nice bright amber color, very clear. Amazingly big, thick three finger foamy head, with excellent staying power. Took a while to bubble down to thick sticky lace that had amazing retention.  Full, hoppy aroma- very nice sweet hop smell. Typical notes of pine and grapefruit.  Not as bold a taste as the smell implies; a bit on the softer side. Light notes of barley and malt, mixed with soft hop.  The mouthfeel was also a bit softer than I had expected for a brew that smelled like a wonderful DIPA.  I would get this again- I remember having a glass on tap a few weeks ago that had better character than this bottled sampling, but very good overall.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Tifore,4.1,"On tap at Melt Bar & Grilled. Poured into a pint glass.  A - A deep orange, ultra clear amber color that is a little darker than I thought but I'm not complaining. Looks like a liquid orange almost. Blood Orange more like it. Has a nice one finger off white head that leaves some amazing lacing down the side of the glass and has great retention.  S - Lots of minty, piney hops that excite me to drink it, also some light citrus notes that round it out nicely. Theres some malt in the background that has a nice sweet aroma to it.  T - Taste is of a sweet orange right off the bat with a bit of minty taste to it. Lovely. Lots of citrus and piney hops with some good caramel and roasted malt tastes. Very fresh tasting and a easy drinker. 7.5% alcohol isn't noticable at all.  M - Mouthfeel is medium with some good viscosity to it. Also very smooth across the tounge and throat. Some slight bitter notes that linger at the end of each taste.  D - Drinkability is high on this one. A great beer that went well with dinner. Sadly they only got one keg so I'm not sure I'll see this one again.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Brianjames16,4.87,A - Pours a beautiful translucent amber color. Head is small but overall its a wonderful looking brew.  S- I can smell some earthy hops in the front. I also get some fruity smells like fig or nectar like the label says mixed with pines and floral aromas. I could smell this all day!  T- This beer has such a great balance of wonderful flavors. The perfect amount of bitterness from the hops is balanced by the fruity and earthy taste. It drinks more like an IPA with unique components. WOW! This is one of my new favorites !  M- Very smooth with a light/medium body. Not too much carbonation but finishes clean for me. Very refreshing !  D- I would love to sit down with a few of these. I'm already thinking about a six pack for the weekend. Thanks for suggesting this beer to me man at the beverage store ! ! !,Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,KYBrewgrass,4.08,"A- 4.5 Poured a nice rusty orange/amber color with a good .5"" white, foamy head. A close look shows lots and lots of bubbles. A slosh of the glass leaves them clinging to the edges like glue.  S- 4 Pine, citrus (grapefruit, a little orange) and hops.  T- 4 Like the smell, there's a strong citrus/hop flavor to this brew. The hops come thru even more in the taste. They're strong, but I felt there was enough else going on that it wasn't over-bearing (not the biggest hop-head here). Overall the taste is pretty crisp and refreshing considering the powerful flavors.  M- 4.5 Just a tad syrupy on the tongue but turns into a nice bubbly fizz as it lingers and goes down. Makes me want more of it this way. I'd say its a medium body that could be confused for light because of its citrusy flavor.  D- 4 If you did drink this as if it were 'light' it'd sneak up on you! Its a well-balanced brew but boasts some intense flavors that could limit how many you'd want in a sitting. Overall, it's a very well-done hoppy amber that I'd definitely recommend.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

694,15881,thebrood1987,4.7,"Wow probably one of the fruitiest smelling hop forward beers I've ever smelled. It smells like a collection of juicy fruits most that stand out are grapefruit mango and citrus overtones with some slight resin in the back. The taste is that same really smooth and almost syrupy grapefruit, mango citrus taste with the vienna and wheat malt in the middle and ending with that dry hop sort of resin like finish. Not as bitter as most IPA's but maybe that's why they dont call it one? This is all about the hop flavor. As you drink more the bitterness builds with the citrus and resin like dryness but that's only after you get the strong pungent hop flavor that you notice right from the first sip.  This is the perfect beer for people who want IPA flavor without being too turned off with the bitterness not to say it doesn't have bitterness but it's definitely not like the ""hop bombs"" of the West Coast but damn this stands up when it comes to hop taste pungency. That aroma though is so appealing and what really draws you into the beer. The taste just follows it up and lets you know that this isn't just a smelling type of beer.  The only other beer I've had from them is their HopBack which I wasn't too impressed with but it was so long ago and it was probably a way older bottle than this fresh Nugget Nectar. Now that I've had this beer though I see them as a top notch brewery just like the best of them. A plus to the Nugget Nectar.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Big and bold dry-hopping.  T- Sweet tangerines and citrus, nice malt caramel malt character before a huge tangerine and citrus finish with a moderate pine bitterness. Tangerines and citrus are awesome within this beer and even though it is sorta one-dimensional in that aspect it is done very, very well.  M- Smooth, clean, very crisp. Nice medium carbonation. Solid.  D- Way to drinkable for a 7.5% abv beer, dangerous in fact. The tangerine and citrus elements are just awesome as noted earlier.

Grapefruit, orange, citrus, pine and also some caramel malt, honey and bread.  Taste is hoppy upfront with grapefruit and pine. Malts kick in the middle with moderate sweetness. Then comes a mild hop bitterness that progresses to the finish. Aftertaste is again very citric with lots of orange.  Mouthfeel on cask is amazing. Way silkier and smoother than the bottle. Carbonation is also lower, as expected.  Drinkability is extremely high. It took me 10 min to finish the pint.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,timobkg,2.26,"Purchased the day it came out in NJ, poured into a Duvel tulip.  The appearance is a lovely clear amber, with a good head.  The aroma is straight grapefruit.  The taste is more grapefruit, mixed with grapefruit / citrus pith and rind. The aftertaste is mostly pith and rind. It's bitter, but not in the typical hops bitterness. It's bitter like you're chewing on grapefruit rind. The taste of grapefruit and pith overwhelmed whatever malt sweetness may have been present.  I love Troegs' Hopback, but this is not an imperial version of Hopback. Where as Hopback was a hoppy amber, featuring hops on top of sweet caramel malt, Nugget Nectar kicked the malt to the side, discarded the sweetness, and replaced it with grapefruit and pith, and is closest to a DIPA. I had a bottle last year, another this year, and someone shared a growler with me a couple weeks ago. Each time, the beer tasted exactly the same. It may be amber in color, but an Imperial Amber this beer is not.  If you like eating your grapefruit with the pith and rind still on, then this beer is for you. I'm not a big fan of grapefruit, hate eating the pith, and like my ambers to be malty.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

S: Fragrant floral and fruity hops with lots of sweet, syrupy caramel malt aroma.  T: Citrus and grapefruit pith, followed by some caramel and assertive toasted malts. Not nearly as sweet as the aroma had me expecting. Finishes with a light, but drawn out bitterness.  M: Medium to full-bodied with soft carbonation. I like the this aspect of the beer.  Based on the label, I was expecting this to be more of an amber, whereas it came off like as an IPA, dry with a heavier toasted malt bill. Not bad, but just didn't click for me.

694,15881,ms11781,4.42,"Bottled on 02/02/2011. 12oz bottle poured into a pint glass.  Pours a brilliant clear amber color. A 1 and a half finger off white head rises and falls relatively quickly leaving a thin foamy cap and decent lacing.  Exceptionally hoppy nose. Smells fruity and piny. Different fruits are present, not the normal citrus and grapefruit aromas I've come to expect from a very hoppy nose. Maybe something sweeter like juicy melon. There is some malt sweetness as well but the hops dominate here.  The taste is more balanced than the nose but the same strong fruity and piny hops are present along with the sweet malt character. Fruity, juicy melon-like hops lead the way and a huge sweet malt flavor balances them out nicely. Piny, resiny hops show up again at the finish and bring a bit of bitterness.  Pretty full mouthfeel for a beer with a medium body and medium carbonation. Feels a bit slick at times and gets a decent bite at the end from a slightly bitter finish.  Excellent drinkability. Great hop aromas and flavor with the malt to balance it out. Drinks more like a well balanced IPA than an amber. 7.5% ABV is extremely well hidden, though it would probably keep you from having more than a couple pints.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

The finish is a bit sticky and bitter. Also, I am getting a touch of toastiness in the the taste.  M - It has a medium body and good carbonation, that slightly tingles the mouth. There is a slightly puckering bitterness, and a sticky feel as well.  D - This has really good drinkability. It has a great flavorm and it is a very easy beer to drink.

S - delicious! Huge citrus and floral notes all throughout this beer with a malt base that almost takes the taste to maple syrup. Simcoe notes float in the background giving it a whole lot of depth.  T - this beer has a generous amount of hops with delicious notes of grapefruit and floral. The hops are enough to appeal to a hophead, but not totally turn off a domestic drinker to the style. It helps that it was bottled less than two weeks ago, as well.  M - I am very big on mouthfeels and this one does not disappoint. Huge, sticky full body with hops attacking your tastebuds. If it had a tad more carbonation it would be perfection. But it's damn good.  D - drinkability is excellent. Alcohol hidden very well. Good use of malt keeping everything in check.

Hop forward, citrus following closely and nice calm maltiness to balance at the end.  M: Medium body, mildly carbonated, not overly oily or bitter and the alcohol is non-existent in the mouthfeel.

It doesn't reveal a ton, but it has a bit of a melon aroma, with a bit of a spicy bite.  This brew is perfectly balanced. There's a solid hop bite to it. The hops are slightly floral and moderately bitter. But the malts are quite dense with a rye-like spiciness. The flavors are wonderfully compatible, and just mild enough to avoid becoming a distraction.  Mouthfeel is quite nice. It's a suprisingly dense brew, which provides a nice base for the complex flavors within.  Drinkability here really can't be measured. There's such a complexity of solid flavors. There is nothing here that stands out as the dominant flavor, which is a bonus for such a nicely balanced brew.

Hell yes!  Had this on an unseasonably warm February night, in the high 60s, and boy did it go good. Grabbed a six, poured, and ...  Appearance - Pours a pure golden color, minimal head with a modest pour, NO head with a gentle pour, yet aggressive head with an aggressive pour. WOW! This is a beer that knows what it is. I suspect this beer is selling sex. Is it a hooker?  Smell/Nose - Okay, wow, her va-- I mean, this beer's aroma is phenomenal. They call it an amber, but the hops are up front like an IPA, and the citrus is up front like a hardcore West Coast IPA. How do they pull this off? Who knows? All I know is, it smells amazing. You fall in love at first whiff.  Taste - Can I use the F word here? 'Cause I want to. BANG, you get all the hoppy nose, but the front is as tasty as the T-Mobile 4G girl. Wonderfully blended and drinkable in the middle -- almost TOO drinkable -- and by the end, a burst of fruity hops.  Yeah, they call this an ""amber,"" and it does have the mellow, grainy tones of an amber, but at times it's practically an aggressive IPA in disguise. IPA lovers will enjoy this. And so will some people who don't love IPAs. This beer earns its reputation.  Mouthfeel - I had been drinking a few selections from the Saranac mixer prior to this (why don't more reviewers put these things in context?), and they're nice, but damn does that experience show how nice and smooth the carbonation and feel of this beer is. It's a big beer, but it doesn't clear out your palate like a huge IPA. Feels nice, lots of carbonation but smooth.  Drinkability - Well hell, what do you say about a relatively big beer that goes down good? Not much other than, this shiat drinks great!

Smells hoppy, more so than expected from this style. More IPA like than anything else.  Toasty malts are present, but are mostly blown out of the water by hoppiness. More hoppy than you'd expect from a red. The balance is a bit askew towards hops, but isn't completely lost. Piney grapefruits tilt the tables tho.

694,15881,Tucquan,4.37,"Had this from a growler on 2011-02-18 just 45 minutes after being filled at the brewery from a new batch rolled out yesterday. It doesn't get much fresher than this! Had this in 2012 and just now on 2013-01-05 from bottles released yesterday. The 2013 version is much like the 2011 version and better than 2012; perhaps because they were dialing in their new brew house. The 2013 has the sharp citrus, earthy spice and solid bitterness that was missing a bit in 2012. I like this a bit better than their Perpetual IPA. The review that follows is from 2011 and the ratings reflect an average of the 2011 and 2013 tastings. Had this again on 2015-01-23 from a 6-day-old 16 oz can and it is tasting wonderful. I like this new canned format and the 2015 batch is as good as it has ever been. Had this again on 2018-01-20 from a 12oz can best by 2018-05-03. Still tasty; perhaps a bit more malt forward than I remember but my tastes have evolved over the years. Had it again on 2022-01-12 from a fresh bottle - still malt forward with the taste improving in the middle and finish.  Original review below is from 2011-02-18, which had a 4.37 overall ratting.  A - Clear amber/red with a 2-finger white head into a Russian River snifter glass. Good lacing.  S - Tropical fruit, floral hop buds, mild grain, earthy. Very nice but not overpowering by any means, even when warm.  T - Tropical fruit, pine, tart citrus and caramel malt are first out of the gate with the orange peel bitterness and earthy/herbal, bright, vibrant hop cones closing in from behind. There's a lingering orange/pineapple/mango and malt sweetness to compliment the also-lingering orange zest bitterness that ultimately remains in-balance with a little ""sour tart"" note at the end as it dries out. Very fresh tasting. Reminds me of a sunny day in California. Delicious.  M - Medium body and carbonation with a substantial and resinous feel. This growler has more carbonation than when I had it on cask but not quite as much as directly on-tap or from the bottle. It could be just this particular keg and not the growler. It didn't have much time to outgas in my sealed Russian River, swing-top growler.  D - This is a wonderful beer and would be close to, or at the top of my list of beers to represent Pennsylvania in a head-to-head completion against other great beers from around-the-world. It's got everything going for it.  Notes: The brewery said they were close-to-the-end of Nugget Nectar availability for 2011 so I picked up a case, which was just bottled yesterday. Case prices at the brewery are $41.99 and a 64oz growler is $11.00, which are both quite a buy for a beer of this caliber.

T: again the citrus comes through, along with pineapple, floral hints, and a balanced malt sweetness.  M: mildly carbonated and a bit thin.  D: easily one of my favorite troegs offerings, alongside hopback. I wish this was available year round.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,SalukiAlum,4.59,"A- Poured into a pint glass. Nice amber appearance. Light foamy touch of foam on the top. Some carbonation.  S- Really enjoyed the aroma of this brew, probably one of the best smelling brews I can remember! I can smell citrusy, and very peachy!! Can smell the hops but not overwhelming.  T- Agree with someone earlier, you really don't notice the 93 IBUs and I love my hops, but no need for them to takeover the beer always. Again tasting the peaches.  M- Nice hoppy aftertaste, very smooth.  D- Very good beer, the difficult part is only having one to drink. I agree with most I could knock back a few of these. Very pleasant imperial amber red, in a class of its own. Hard to compare to others.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,nickshep7,4.37,Love this brew. Color is a deep yet transparent orange. 2 finer head that fades to a nice lace. I get a good amount of citrus hop and a touch of chive (?). Moutfeel is good -- the taste is truly what makes this brew. Drinkability is good. I could throw back a few of these on a cool winter/spring evening.,Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Bouleboubier,4.5,"I was thinking this reminds me of a more imperial version of their Hopback - I'm always the last one to find out. Nugget Nectar has to be one of the most apt names out there for a hopcentric ale like this.  Awesome contrast between the compact, wet cotton candy, so-bright-its-almost-white, whipped cream head and the fiery orange glow of the sweet nectar below - mostly clear but with oily fruit viscosity more than apparent.  A slippery concentration of red ruby grapefruit and a smatter of creamy mango immediately in the nose - explosively so later in flavor. Super-thick Munich malt presence - mmm, sugar cookie. Mild booze, most welcome.  Blast of concentrated hop elixir greets the tongue first, riding sugar-sprinkled biscuit maltiness - not overly sweet thankfully - malt and hops in tandem, that is. Digging that tangerine-soaked sugar cookie. Bold wallop of nut late. My, what a dazzling sequence.  Even with a prickly bitter twing up front, and an approaching hot (but not) deep warming sensation washing through to the end, just avoiding chug burn, that damn fine malt oil slickness cools it all down - lubes the gears like a champ. Liquid candy.  Haven't had this in years - I think this keg had been tapped for a couple weeks now, too - and still it stands quite alone in what it offers. I wouldn't disagree with ""out of this world"". One of the few hyped brews I've had lately that wowed me. Ain't paying $18 or whatever for a sixer though. Pfft.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,jboucher,4.59,"12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass  Bottled on 2/17/2011  Appearance: Nice clear copper, amber color with a slight orange hue. When held facing light, it appears like a blush wine. Nice sticky, but not overwhelming lacing that remains on the glass until it's gone. Thin head, with decent retention.  Smell: Hoppy nose with a little bit of mellow citrus (mango, tangerine, peach). Slight floral notes are present as well.  Taste: Beautiful balance between hops, malt, and citrus flavors. Very nice malt backbone, so to speak. There are mango, melon, and orange notes along with slight grapefruit notes. The hops are definitely not overwhelming, despite the high IBU count. The bitterness is only sensed on the sides and back of the palate. Malty and mellow citrus attack with a hopped finish. Extremely well balanced.  Mouthfeel: Very smooth and a little heavier than medium bodied. Decent carbonation.  Drinkability: Goes down so easily. This brew makes you want to go back for more. Very enjoyable.  Ending notes: Easily the best of the Tröegs line. Would buy again in a heartbeat. At a moderate price, you can't go wrong.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,oline73,4.72,"I had this on cask at Frisco Grille. This is the first time I've had this beer on cask, and I was not disappointed.  Appearance: Pours a reddish amber with a finger of off white head that went away completely.  Smell: Quite simply put, this beer smell awesome! There is a sweet herbal hop smell initially with a nice malty background. The hops and malt are in a perfect balance.  Taste: There is a wonderful herbal hop bitterness throughout the whole sip, but it doesn't wipe out the other flavors. In the background there is a bready malt sweetness and a little bit of alcohol at the very end.  Mouthfeel: The body is medium and there is little to no carbonation (this is a cask ale after all). There is a very little bit of dryness at the end of each sip.  Drinkability: This is the best beer on cask that I can remember drinking. It is very well balanced and I would love it if I could find more.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

It pours amber with a fingers width head which recedes and clings..smells sweet,fruity and malty very strong likeable nose.taste is similar, citrus hop forward with a nice sweetness slightly doughy and a little caramel. unfortunately in my opinion the mouthfeel is somewhat lacking, considering this is an imperial amber i thought it would be fuller seems just a tad thin. with the thin mouthfeel this is still an exceptional beer would love to have more.

A- The appearance is nice nice golden amber, in the right light almost light plum with a thin white froth covering the top.  S- Intense citrusy hop aromas, grapefruit and lemons burst. Very potent and pungent.  T- Grapefruit citrus, mango, peaches. Delicious. Big hop on the tongue. Very floral, tobacco, woody and light malt.  M- Nicely bodied, dry and bitter low carbonation.

694,15881,BeerMaverick,4.5,"Took long enough to get to Western MA...  Bought a case of this beer and there is no bottled date anywhere to be seen.  A - This is one of the most beautiful beers I've ever seen. Completely translucent and perfectly amber. Light to moderate head and not bad head retention. Lacing is nothing to brag about here. Despite the large amount of hops used ""93ish IBUs,"" this beer is not cloudy at all.  S - This is definitely a highlight of this beer; hoppy fruity whiffs in your face. Extremely strong aroma out of the glass and in the bottle.  T - This is the best Imperial Amber beer that I've ever had...probably because, like most people, I'm a hop fan. I wouldn't say 93 IBUs...more like 75ish, but perhaps that's the freshness I'm tasting(again no date on the bottle or case). In addition to the bitterness, the malts are very noticeable. Slight woody notes, but mainly an active fruit flavor (citrusy I believe).  M - The sweet fruity citrusy flavor lingers and it is complimented by the hops to create a wonderfully balanced beer. Wonderful aftertaste.  D - Despite being 7.5% abv., I would probably drink a six pack of this at one time...it's just so damn good.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Ipatsfans,4.42,"I am new to BA, and Nugget Nectar. I am excited that my first time drinking Nugget Nectar will also be my first ever BA review.  Bottled on 2/7/11, poured from a bottle into a Matterhorn Ski Bar pint glass.  A - Color is burnt orange, like an old penny or a cooked sweet potato. Head about half a finger to start, disappears in a min or two.  S - Hoppy, slightly bitter and sweet, hints of citrus, maybe tangerine. The smell is unexpected in a good way, I love the hop profile.  T - Delicious hop start, subtle bitter taste, much smoother than I expected (not sure why), after-taste bordering on sweet but not in a bad way at all. As a newbie to reviews and thinking about the full flavors of beer, dare I say it reminds me a little of a sweeter 90 minute?  M - Excellent going down, but slight lingering sensation that I don't love. Maybe that's the high ABV.  D - I could crush several of these in a sitting and think nothing of it.  Overall I enjoyed my first Nugget Nectar very much. Looking forward to another one in a few minutes. I will order this beer anytime I see it on tap, and I will purchase another sixer if I find it. I will not scour the city for it again though.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Mouthfeel- medium carbonation with a little bit of hop oils  Drinkability- Fantastic price and moderate ABV of 7.5% make this a highly drinkable beer.

694,15881,harrymel,4.38,"Thanks to Jrod1969 for this as an extra! Bottled 1.27.11 Poured to NB globe.  A: Pours a beautifully clear orange ruby ale. The clarity of this beer is....wow. Single finger peanut head falls quickly. Decent lacing.  S: Very sweet. Caramel malts, cotton candy, bubblegum; I don't what it is about east coast big time hoppy beers, but they are so sweet on the nose. As a PNW native, I have a hard time wrapping my head around this trend. I don't know that I dislike it, but it's not what I'm used to at all.  T: Sweet caramel malts dominate this beer. Which I would expect from an amber. I've seen many want to call this an Impy Red, unfortunately the malt profile lacks the cara pils flavor Red's have. No biscuit flavors. The hops carry through into the flavor here, similar to the nose. Surprisingly, the beer is not particularly bitter. They did a good job keeping with the balance profile of an amber.  M: Just a hare lighter than many ambers I've tried. Medium carbonation. Neither slicking nor drying; a good balanced mouthfeel.  D: This beer goes down nicely. So great to have a beer that packs so much flavor and doesn't pack a high ABV for many beers labeled Imperial. If this was a local, I would advise folks to drink this often. Not sure why they wouldn't make this a year-round offering.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,SkunkWorks,4.32,"Had on tap at TJ Finleys in Bayshore, NY. Served in a pint glass.  Look: reddish copper body with a slightly off white head. There is decent retention and a good deal of lacing left behind. Good looking amber ale.  Smell: wow! That's hoppy. This smells like a DIPA and not an amber ale, and I've had some of the hoppier ambers out there like Hop Head Red and Cascazilla. Big, resinous hops stand out with some hints of citrus, grass and floral characters.  Taste: follows the nose with a huge hop taste kicking me in the mouth. Pine sap, floral, some citrus like grapefruit. Bready, toasted malt sits in the background. Delicious.  Feel: medium bodied, moderate carbonation, smooth with a lingering hop bitterness in the finish.  Drink: easy to drink. You could have a few pints of this without an issue.  Overall, this is a very solid beer. Its more like a DIPA that happens to be red than an amber ale. I would recommend this one wholeheartedly. Well done, Troegs!

694,15881,rudzud,4.3,"Picked up a random 12 oz bottle from Julio's. Why didnt I buy a 6 pack of this?! Bottled 02/07/11!!!  A - This was poured into my Duvel tulip. Pours a great copper colour with a nice one finger head that slowly fades to leave a nice white cloud atop and a thick halo around the beer.  S - Getting some malt sweetness but some really nice citrus notes. More orange like than say, bitter grapefruit. An incredibly light pine aroma too.  T - Not as intense or nice as the nose. Some malt sweetness and hop qualities. The nice citrus is smack dab in the middle with a nice piney/bitter finish.  M - Surprising amount of carbonation here. Really great feel, medium body.  D - Wowzer, a very sessionable beer here. Everything works really well with this amber ale, such great hoppy red ale!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

The smell was nice, kind of reminded me of a DFH 60MIN with some unique characteristics like more a pine citrus smell. Had an excellent taste, a bitter beginning with a real nice flavor on the after taste. This isn't as easy drinking though as a Sierra Nevada Pale Ale but still is a great beer.

Nice balance between the hops and malt... dry yet sweet. A touch of honey on the finish.  M- Such a perfect balance of hops and malts. Not at all acrid on the tongue, but not so sweet that the citrus washes away!  D- My first time having this fantastic brew... it will not be my last!!!

694,15881,damndirtyape,4.12,"12oz bottle (no date I could find) poured into a milkshake pilsner glass.  Appearance: A clear orange-copper color with a off-white to light tan head. Pours about 1/4"" thick foam, but this dies down to a thin ring around the edge and a very thin skin across the top. Delicate lacing of dots and strands noted.  Smell: Good and strong grapefruit and pine smells. Pleasantly hoppy and smells quite tasty.  Taste: Grapefruit and pine hop flavors right up front moving quickly into a maltier flavor (caramel...maybe, can't tell) followed by a bitter finish and some lingering bitter flavor in the mouth later. A very hop forward beer, but not so overpowering that it becomes hops only.  Mouthfeel: Some quick carbonation on the tongue, and then it's gone to be replaced with some lingering sensation on the teeth. A slick and coating beer going down.  Drinkability: Very tasty and this one was gone fast but I cannot see myself having another one right away. I'm noticing the higher ABV early on despite having this with a meal. Incidentally, this went quite well with a meal of Mexican scrambled eggs and salad. I thought it might work with this and it did. Pretty good beer overall - quite good in the aroma dept. and good all around, but I think I can only have one at a time.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,OldIronLungs,4.26,"Had this ages ago, never reviewed it. Happy to oblige.  Poured right into a pint a light pine amber/honey color with a quickly dissipating foamy white head that neatly clings to the rim.  Not overwhelming aroma but decidedly citrus and pine, very nice light prickly carbonation that is smooth and pleasing. Piney-but-polite bitterness that is between the malty sweetness on the front and back end of a sip.  Highly drinkable. The 7.5% is present, but so neatly in balance with the sweet and bitter it makes for a very quaffable pint.  A great example of a hop-forward amber that still wins in the balanced style.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,evanlarkin,4.26,"Thanks to hopz4life for this one.  Appearance: A clear honey orange color. With less light, more of an amber. A single finger of head which dissipated very quickly, like a foamy cola. Some carbonation bubbles.  Aroma: caramelly and slightly sweet. Some bitter aromas come through too. Hops character is both piney and citrusy, but not citrusy enough that I can put a finger on the exact fruit.  Taste: Piney and resinous hops with a good smacking of that caramel malt. Bitter in the beginning and through the middle, but balances for a sweet and pleasant finish.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied, silky. Very smooth with some carbonation and bitey alcohol. Not harsh, not oily.  Drinkability: I'd have another. I can't say what the price was, but it definitely seems very drinkable to me. Good, hoppier than I'd expect for an amber, but I'm an IPA fan so this reflects well.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,crossovert,4.35,"12 oz bottle.n Bottled on 01/25/11.  It pours a clear amber with a foamy and fizzy white head. The carbonation bubbles cling to the sides of the glass initially creating and odd, but interesting look.  From the moment you pop the cap you can smell this one. It is very tropical and citrusy in the smell. It has notes of orange, pineapple and mango. The malt has almost a chocolate rye pastry smell to it. I still want more of a bludgeoning in the smell though.  The flavor is the best component to this beer. The hops explode on the palate. They are both cirtusy and piney, with a high, but hot extreme bitterness. The malt is definitely noticeable, it is an interesting malt bill and it adds some very bready flavors along with a leveling sweetness.  I really like the mouthfeel on this one, it is a great carbonation level for that hop delivery.  Overall a very nice beer from Troeegs.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

S: citrus, pine and malty goodness. This smells like a DIPA/IIPA.  T: Very nice. Mellow, smooth and malty goodness. For a 93IBU beer this definitely doesn't have any harsh bitterness...in fact the opposite. It's quite a smooth drinker and has an amazing malt balance that makes this exceptionally easy to drink.  M: Excellent. I don't know how this can be improved. This is dead on for the style. Great carbonation, great flavor, texture and consistency.

S - aroma is pine and grapefruit and just a hint of something sweet - maybe tropical fruit.  T - taste is predominantly hops, echoing that grapefruit again but the pine is now resinous with bold bright hop flavor and assertive bitterness, carried by just enough malt and a bit of caramel to be noticed along with alcoholic warmth and maybe a bit of fusel, before finishing dry and with a long-lingering bitterness.  M - Medium bodied, restrained carbonation, and just a bit of slickness with noticeable warmth.  D - This beer is dominated by hops in aroma, taste, and finish, to an extent that will delight hop heads but others may find out of balance enough to limit drinkability. Delicious and assertive for the hop-inclined.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,yourchoice,4.73,"A: A gorgeous clear golden amber pour. Perfect head that laces nicely on the glass. S: Pine and citrus that can be expected, but a bit of a mango odor that is absolutely wonderful. T: Very balanced. Not the typical ""in-your-face"" hoppy monster. Orange, grapefruit and pine from the IPA side, but malt, and brown sugar from the amber side. A very impressive beer. M: Seems almost a bit thin. Very neutral on the palate. O: Outstanding!

694,15881,Neffbeer,4.5,"12 oz bottle into a tulip. Bottled on 1/27/11  A: It pours a gorgeous amber that reveals some orange hues when held up to the light. There is a generous two finger white head that stands on its' own for quite some time. Plenty of great sticky lacing to go around as well, it is caked massively onto the glass.  S: Tons of sticky hops in this one; pine cone, citrus, herbal, spicy, and a distinctly dank resinous aroma. As I keep stuffing my face in the glass I am starting to pick up a respectable malt back bone, caramel and toasty bread.  T: There is a blast of hops on the first sip that just goes on, and on. It finishes moderately bitter and quite dry. As the sips continue the hops develop into more specific flavors, fir tree, grapefruit, spicy herbal tea, to name a few. The flavors of the hops in this beer are much more piney and earthy than some, but the Nectar holds up really solid in comparison for me.  M: Smooth and luscious, they kept the carbonation in check which really allows the hop profile to shine.  D: I could put this one away all winter.

694,15881,Chaney,4.77,"Ahhh... I guess it's Nugget Nectar season again and this was my first of what will be many for the season!  A: Poured a crystal clear, bright, bright, bright orange color with a thick 2-3 finger off-white (a bit of orange?) head that stayed stuck to the hoppy liquid below it for what seemed like an eternity.  S: A HUGE floral bouquet of nugget, warrior, tomahawk, simcoe, and palisade hops. Sure there is a big citrus presence, but it didn't have the grapefruit sizzle that a very piney, cascady IPA has.  T: Refreshingly flowery, with a bit of orange peel, but balanced completely by a huge malty and bready undertow. Wow! I could totally recognize this as an amber as opposed to an IPA.  M: The frothy lacing left on the glass was pretty ridiculous, but on the palate, this was straight up golden! No lingering syrupiness, and the bitterness was (once again) of the floral variety.  D: Probably the most drinkable beer in BA's top 100 in my opinion. I once had a craft beer store owner say to me, ""People buy this stuff from me in massive quantities as if it were crack cocaine!""

The hoppy finish made this very refreshing and dangerously drinkable. I could easily finish a sixpack of this.  For somebody who prefers hop forward beers, this is the definition of balance.

Aroma is pungently hoppy with sweet citrus notes and some spicier floral notes. Malt backbone suggests some toasted malt aromas but this is a bit tough to pick up on.  Taste is wonderfully hoppy with a strong citrusy presence but and even stronger floral hop character. Dry hopping seems to be doing a lot of the work here because it does not seem as bitter as I would expect for such a hoppy flavor. The wide variety of hops used blends well together making for an enjoyable hop bomb.

694,15881,veinless,4.57,"Shoutout to my main man Buddha22 for this, got it in a trade with him. Pours deep sappy red, hence the classification as an amber/red ale. Head is a bit thin, with larger than averages bubbles interspersed throughout. Laces decently.  Aroma is so very herbal and nice, with a hint of caramel sweetness in the back. Citrus/fruit tones of orange and mango, a nice combination.  Taste is incredibly balanced, with a back-and-forth between bitter and sour that goes on til the end. Starts with a nice bitter beginning that isn't too strong, bringing out some of the orange/mango fruits from the nose. The malt is then handed the baton and sweetens the deal with a lot of sugary syrup taste. Mr herbal hop runs the third leg like a champ, with specific hints of mint coming out to play. The malt then joins the fray, and the herbal sweet finish is one to remember. Really awesome blend of flavors, and so smoothly blended that it remains fresh and new each sip.  Mouthfeel is fantastic, as this is smooth and silky, and borderline creamy at times, yet crisp and refreshing. Drinkability is just phenomenal, and at 7.50% abv, you could do worse for such a flavorful beer. The finish keeps the beer consistently enjoyable from start to end. Lived up to the hype.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Not particularly aromatic (in this version; much more grapefruit on tap or bottle) in this form. I am doing this review from notes, and actually just had a NN bottle. Interestingly, I much prefer the smell from the bottle. T - Pine, grapefruit and a very green aftertaste. A strong mint element that doesn't come through in the other formats. M - Super creamy, perfect temp and carbonation. Very well stored/served. DB - Way too high for me!!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

There are piney and earthy hops, with a touch of bready malt.  Mouthfeel is crisp and dry. Low carbonation.  Overall, a very drinkable beer. I was somewhat let down by the hype, though.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,ElijahCSkuggs,3.65,"I was in the mood for some nectar nugget....but I had to settle for some Nugget Nectar. I just hope it's as nectary as it is nuggety. Anybody else in the mood for some chicken nuggets?  Pours a clear amber that sports a nice big off-white which settles into a skimming layer, which then later all but disappears. Some alright sticky lace as well.  Smell and taste both bring home the aromatic hops. This is like a taking in a big bag of freshly clipped grass and pine chips which was dunked in a big vat of mild fruity goodness. (?!) I'm not a big fan of overly hoppy, fresh-fresh type stuff, so take that as you will.  Crisp and smooth with a quick bite and a lasting aftertaste is all very memorable.  Not a big fan of this style, and I probably won't be buying this again, but if you enjoy your beers in the forest, for the forest and by the forest, then give this a whirl.  p.s.

Flower hops, bitter in just the right way. A bit of malt presence, very sweet, and delicious.

694,15881,Reaper16,3.92,"12oz. bottle served into a tulip glass I had this on-tap during my recent trip to D.C., along with other beers that I would have liked to review, such as Victory Yakima Glory, various Allagash beers on-tap, etc. But my conference time was not conducive to taking tasting notes. I did bring home a six-pack of Nugget Nectar, so let's give a bottle a proper review.  Pours a very clear amber color with light orange highlights throughout the body. Not much active carbonation visible through the body. Less than a finger of head, far less really. Off-white lacing is pretty meh, but it'll do. Considering how hoppy this beer is, it's clarity is noteworthy (and sends the beer above the mark of 'average').  The hops dominate the nose of Nugget Nectar. They're juicy and resiny. Lots of spruce and grapefruit pulp. The malts don't shy away really, but the gentle, amber ale sweetness is masked somewhat by the spruce/pine bouquet. As the beer warms, a certain minty note becomes more prominent. Like spearmint. It gets to be much like toothpaste, sharp and kind of soapy.  Nugget Nectar strikes me as very strange in that its hops aren't all that flavorful. Its 93 IBUs is manifest in an awful lot of bitterness, but not a lot of hop flavor. The beer tastes pretty bready, with lots of generic ale yeast tastes. A drop of grapefruit oil and a splash of Pine-Sol hit the tongue but they quickly turn to pure bitterness. I would not be scoring this beer a 4.0 if not for the style; as far as Amber Ales go, this represents complexity.  It's a hoppy beer from the East Coast, so what else did you expect but a confusing mouthfeel combination of sticky-sweet and astringent? It works well enough in terms of commanding further sipping. The bitter blast also works to make for a drinkable beer by hophead standards.  Ultimately, I don't get the hype over this beer. If this weren't an Amber/Red Ale then I would be slaughtering it. I found it little better on-tap, but the essential character of this beer is the same: too much bitterness, bland Amber Ale taste underneath.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,nobeer4u,4.67,"I look forward to this beer every year, truly one of my favorites. I just picked up a case of the 2011 brew and found it slightly different than previous years. Not bad, just different. First off, the smell of this beer never disapoints. Apricots and the smell of hops enough that my mouth waters just thinking about it. The taste is exceptional, although I do have to say that it may take two to get the full appreciation of the flavor. This is where this years is a little different. Previous years seemed to have a slightly sweeter mouth-coating feel to them where this years doesn't have that. Not sweet, but just enough to ensure the hops bite stays with you for a few extra seconds.

Nice bit notes of citrus, and maybe even equal notes of caramel malt goodness.  Loads of woodsy, citrus attack your tongue at the start. Plenty of bitterness, sweet caramel malts. Finish is naturally additionally bitter, and lingering. Causes you to smack your lips! You can feel a tinge of heat after a couple of good sips.

Finishes clean and smooth with a great, tasty bitterness. Superior drinkability for a 7.5% ABV beer. A little expensive at $11.99 a 6 pack but it is well worth it, easily met my expectations.

Lacing clings to the glass. Low in carbonation. S) Very hop forward. Peach and mango with an underlying astringency. Some sweet, malt notes are in the background, but the aroma is all about the hops. T) Well balanced beginning. Just a slight hint of bitterness. The finish is malty sweetness, but right before that, there is a huge burst of juicy fruit flavor. The aftertaste starts with a slight return of the bitterness but then shifts to pleasant bready taste. M/D) Medium body. There is very little if any of the dryness in the mouth that tends to accompany very hoppy beers. Very easy drinking beer. Borderline sessionable depending on how well you can tolerate the higher alcohol content.  This is an exceptional beer. Nothing wrong with it at all and very little room for improvement.

There is a little biscuit presence and some soapiness which is a little off putting.  T- Much of the same as the nose. Big piney hops with a sweet malt backbone. There is a decent bitterness to it and there is the lingering soap notes that I keep picking up.  M- Medium bodied with decent carbonation.

Not tons of carbonation going on here. I really love the color. Nice lacing.  S - Sweet and hoppy. Smells like an IPA crossed with an amber ale. A light citrusy hop is most prominent, with a solid sweet caramel malt backbone.  T - Hoppy bitterness up front, followed by a citrus and a sweeter maltyness. Finish is a bit grainy. Touch of caramel in the middle. Not hoppy enough to be considered an IPA like I have heard some people suggest it should be re-classified as. Bottle is only a week old. I was really expecting more hops, from what I've heard about this beer.  M - Medium body and little carbonation. Too wet throughout, but it leads into a nice dryness in the back end.  D - Very very easy to down. The beer is lower ABV for something considered an ""Imperial"". That said, it is a very drinkable brew. I can't get to my next sip soon enough, I want more, I always want more. However, I don't really think it deserves the praise it gets, but it's definitely a great beer. I won't go out of my way to get it in the future, that is for sure.  You should just drink Hopback, it's almost exactly the same, and NN has only a slightly higher ABV and really only a bit more hop to it. I just don't quite get it.

After that is a sickly sweet caramel syrup smell, with a bit of spicing, clove, coriander, slightly peppery when you get really deep.  The taste is strong on the pine hops, backed by the citrus. The malt impression I get is a long boil with lots of caramel 120, very sweet and a little maple syrup texture and flavor.  Pretty smooth but spiced from carbonation and slightly astringent from the citrus. Nice crisp pine hop finish with just a tad bit of lingering sweetness. Not at all what I was expecting, way hoppier and not as malty as the title ""Imperial Amber"" leads me to believe.

There is a strong citrusy hop presence that is akin to the smell, but it's not overpowering at all. It's very well balanced. The taste is sweet with a grapefruit like dryness on the finish. Great flavors. Only a light alcohol presence on the back-end.  M - Light to Medium body with a medium carbonation. Again, well balanced. Has a slight stickiness.  D - This one drinks very easily.

A smoothing malt character is present.  T: The flavor is what you love in an IPA without it being a pallet buster. The hops are west coast style, more dynamic and grapefruit/citrus/pine like. There is a lovely smooth caramel malty character that really sets this brew apart. It is so balanced, everything is smoothing out.  MF: mouthfeel is smooth and enjoyable, spot on.

694,15881,Jesse13713,4.45,"Thanks to AwYeh for sharing a bottle of this with me.  Appearance - Pours a bright orange-amber color with about half an inch of head. When viewed through the glass, it looks very inviting and carbonated.  Smell - I was overwhelmed with citrus hops at first; but after a few more attempts I could smell a sweeter caramel hint as well. It also had a yeasty smell to it.  Taste - Initially, it overwhelms your palate with hops; just as the scent does. The taste gets quite bitter before changing to a sweet and balanced orange peel finish. It also had a hint of caramel or toffee to it.  Mouth feel - It is very hoppy at first but then smooths out. It is very carbonated and leaves a bitter hoppy citrus taste to your palate.  Drinkability - The alcohol is hidden quite well. It has a very complex taste and would be perfect to continuously sip throughout the afternoon. While the complex taste can overwhelm you at first, it is an extremely well-balanced beer.  At thirteen dollars for a six pack, Nugget Nectar is quite reasonably priced for how unique and complex its taste is. Its bottle art is a good description for how it will taste. The art depicts a hand squeezing nectar out of an enlarged hop, which perfectly describes its strong hop start dripping to a sweet nectar finish.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Excellent notes of grapefruit with mild tartness. Alcohol is slightly present in each sip, though not offensive. The beer is very well balanced.  M: Good feel with plenty of carbonation. Sticky hop flavors coat the palate. Alcohol is disguised well and will sneak up on you.  D: A really tasty brew that goes down like water.

Amazing retention and the most exceptional lacing I've ever experienced. Color is a hazy orange-copper, like aged orange juice. Slightly transparent and utterly mysterious.  Smell: Citrus all around. Pomelo, orange, soap. Mild hops. Not as interesting as the appearance and taste. Some sweetness in the back, like bubblegum or gummy bears.  Taste: Similar to taste, citrus all over. Pure hop juice, but of a mild kind, never overpowering. The freshness is evident. Wet, not dry, thirst-quenching, satisfying. Not pungent or brutal like other hop-based ales. If anything, a little too sweet, too much pineapple syrup taste.  Mouthfeel: Low-to-medium carbonation, medium body. More of both, carbonation and body, would be appreciated. Sweet but not sticky, though, well balanced, never ever out of control.  Drinkability: Enormous.

694,15881,edwardhenry,4.9,"got a Growler from Hawthorne's in Philadelphia. Poured into an oversized wine glass.  To begin, both the appearance and the smell of this beer are outstanding. Truly copper colored, with oily lacing and a thin head with tons of grip to it. Gorgeous. That being said, the smell is even better: nectar is really the right word. Huge hop scent, and the complexity of the smell really showcases the five separate hop varieties, with the nugget hops with which its dry-hopped doing most of the work.  Taste: stunning. Very little bitterness, despite it's technically being 93 IBUs. Hop-forward, but with a darker backbone that allows it to sink back into the tongue without bruising it on the way down.  Again, mouthfeel and drinkability are off-the-charts. Smooth and easy, and it lingers delightfully. One of the most astonishing things about this beer is that the ABV is ""only"" 7.5%, which is remarkable considering its flavor has an intensity that easily matches 9-10% Imperial IPAs.

S- Definitely hop-forward, but it's a much fruitier, sweeter hop smell than I'm accustomed to. The fruit is very tropical, kind of pineapple-ish.  T- Hops first, but sweet, with tropical fruit, citrus, and some dry pine. Some sweetish malt on the back, and it finishes surprisingly dry and bitter, with the citrus hops making a comeback. This beer has so much fruit on it, but the sweetness remains very well balanced. Really, this beer is so many things at once but it all works.  M- For all of the bubbles, there really is very little carbonation, and that works well for the beer. Thin to medium bodied. Finish is dry and pleasantly bitter.  D- Uh, unbelievable for 7.5%. It drinks like a session IPA, so there is a need to be careful with this one. In that sense, it really reminds me of an English style IPA for some reason.  Can't say enough good things about this beer. It's so original and so many different things work well together. Glad I picked it up.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,nezelrac,4.25,"I think having this on cask made a big difference. The malt was more readily accessible and more up-front. Excellent texture.  A - deep amber/copper; slightly hazy; off-white head that faded quickly  S - hops and malt dancing together; lots of floral/citrus/pine hop notes with a backing of sweet malt; very appealing  T - layers of sweet malt balanced by a full spectrum of hop flavors and soft-palate aromatics emerging in waves; really well-crafted; caramel and hints of toastiness  M - excellent tension on the palate with malt and hops just barely keeping each other in check - not too heavy and not too sharp; coming off cask, the mouthfeel was creamier than it would be otherwise, I imagine  D - quite drinkable for me though others may find it a little heavy-going",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

694,15881,Crabbicuss,4.52,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle to a tulip glass.  A - Dark semi-cloudy Amber. Decent head with some spotted lacing.  S - Very Earthy, semi-hoppy with a nice note of carmel and orange/nectarine whiff.  T - First sip definitely different than the last. A semi sweet marriage of hop and malt. It's hard to place the Hops too far in front of the pursuant balance of malt and additives. Very nice blend once the sampler's palate adjusts.  M - Medium body with a slight sweet/sour taste lingering on the palate.  D - Easily a session beer in my opinion though the malt and sweetness may cut some drinkers off before others, as that tends to fill some ""bellies"" faster per beverage serving.  Overall, a great beer! Loving the extended season as unlike other timely releases (especially this time of year) this beer is available up through early March.  My prescription: Get it while you can and enjoy a solid seasonal which is in a category of its own. I'm not saying it's better than the others which release in Jan, I'm just saying it's easily worth the six pack experience at a minimum!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

To my suprise it works. I liked it.  Taste- I'm so confused on this beer. Very complex and bold. Assertive in flavor but malty and sweet. Big hop flavors leave me scatching my head.  Mouth- Medium body with a medium/high carbonation level and it was slight bitter leaving me even more confused.  Drink- I could drink this all night. Very high on my meter. Not quite a 5 but almost.

694,15881,elpollodiablo,3.98,"I'm always a little leery of passing judgment on a bottled brew that I've only previously had on tap, but Tröeg's Nugget Nectar definitely held to the quality I've experienced in the brewery's draught offerings. Beautiful, mash tun-copper in the glass, with pungent citrus and floral aromatics. A scrim of head that lingers well and lattices nicely. Medium to light-bodied with good caramel maltiness that evens out and finishes piney, resinous and sweet. At 93IBUs, I was expecting more of a bite, to be honest, but was pleasantly surprised to find a well-balanced, drinkable, almost-session beer.

I like the look of this beer.  Smell: I get plenty of citrus and sweet malt up front, backed by medium amounts of piney and floral hops. Pretty nice.  Taste: I get quite a bit of nice citrus flavor up front. A nice amount of maltiness shows up as well which makes it very nicely balanced. The piney hops come next, and the finish is more floral. Once again, a pretty nice flavor, and very balanced.  Mouthfeel: This beer is pretty light bodied with quite a bit of carbonation for my tastes. Not the smoothest drinking beer out there, but not bad by any means. Overall I'd say it's pretty drinkable.

Sweet malt follows nicely, and although this is often off-putting to me in an IPA, the balance of hops and malts in the nose is really inviting.  T - Nice clean bitterness. Pine is foremost with just a bit of citrus following. Not huge grapefruit, as I was expecting; definitely more piney. Nice sweet malt on the finish, striking a great balance overall.  M - Maltiness is certainly noticeable, but the beer remains nice and light on the palate.  D - I drink one I want another.  Overall - Great beer that I always look forward to each year.

Taste has a grassy, hoppy, citrusy blend that has a very smooth finish. The hops on this beer are pretty strong, but the whole thing is put together in a very tasty package. Very smooth to drink. 7.5% ABV, and I don't detect it at all. I'm going to easily finish the 22oz'er, and probably not feel it that much. Halfway through the glass, and I'm getting a slightly sweet, smooth taste. It's definitely improving as I drink it. The lacing on the tulip glass is excellent. Great beer!

The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus hop, and citrus. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, and caramel. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium carbonation.

S - very fruity, very hoppy. the hint of pineapple is a distinct characteristic. nice blend of sweetness of bitterness. smells fresh. I'm ready to dive into this beer.  T/M - there is the bitterness from the hops but the citrus adds to the bitterness as well. the sweet malts balance out the bitterness and provide a nice, clean finish. really tasty stuff right here. lighter than I thought it would be. also the bitterness on the aftertaste isn't as strong as I thought it would be either.  D - the drinkability is good. very drinkable for 7.5% ABV, you can't taste the alcohol at all. the combination of great taste and lightness in the body makes it easy to put this down.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,yeahnatenelson,3.98,"Appearance -- Pours a coppery amber hue with two fingers of sudsy cream head and quite a bit of lacing. Very bright.  Smell -- Juicy fruit, citrus, leafy hops, and a bit of menthol. Gently toasted malt and raw cane sugar.  Taste -- Hops lend a little bit of everything: pithy citrus, juicy fruits, leafy and medicinal vegetation, and a modicum of spiciness in the finish. Malting is lightly toasted and slightly sweet, akin to raw cane sugar. Moreover the malt stays in the backdrop and leaves the heavy lifting to the hops. As advertised, it's an uber-hopped amber ale. Lingering flavors of dry toast and citrus pith.  Mouthfeel -- Medium-bodied, mildly viscous, with moderate carbonation.  Drinkability -- I had one of these a few weeks ago and this was remarkably more bitter. Honestly, I think the mild hop fade does Nugget Nectar some good. Still quite hoppy, though MUCH more balanced and less rough. That said, this beer is a little over-hyped. Quite good, and I'm glad there are five more in my fridge, but not the revelation that so many people make it seem.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Head dissipated quickly, leaving a lot of lacing on the edge of the glass, until there was a small collar of off white bubbles along the surface of the beer. Some light carbonation visible, slowly rising to the surface.  Nose is a combination of light caramel malts and mandarin orange, maybe a little grapefruit peel. A bit on the sweet side for a beer that is pretty much an IPA.  Taking a sip, mandarin orange and citrus peel bitterness that was faint on the nose shows up on the tongue. Nice bittering throughout, mixing with some fruity and caramel malt sweetness mid tongue and on the finish. Medium bodied, slick feeling beer with soft but ample carbonation that helps lighten it up. The finish is dry, with the orange peel being the primary note.  There is probably enough malt backbone to call this an amber, but it's hopped as heavily as a DIPA.

You can certainly pick up the malts as well. Smells delicious.  T: Big rush of tropical fruit followed by malt backbone. Citrus flavors are also present. The sweetness and bitterness of this beer play off each other quite well. Not picking up any of the pine that I got in the nose. Very enjoyable.  M: Oily and rich. Finishes pretty dry...a little sticky.  D: Goes down well and is pretty easy to drink. Not that it's a bad thing, but the dry, sticky quality will slow you down a little.  Really like this one a lot.

Oddly, I seem to be running into a lot of beers lately with this strong orange-red and virtually no head. Hopslam, Northern Liberties,and an ESB have nearly the same look except this has more clarity.  Aroma....QUITE aromatic. The only beer recently to out aroma this was a fresh Yakima Glory a few days ago...yes...Nugg even out-smelled Hopslam. Like Hopslam, big Pineapple,the ripe and fresh kind a trace of the caramel lurks behind the acres of fresh pineapples. Aloha.  Flavor. The Pineapple does not act alone. Grapefruit is an accomplice and the Malts watch the door ...Dank ganja like whole hop resins drive the getaway car. Real dramatic. This gang is well armed and will blow away some taste buds just for fun.  The malt role here is to mute the bitterness some and let them big hop cones dance about. Seems to work. An Imperial Amber? Okay, Hopslam, Nugget Nectar and Yakima Glory get 3 different style tags and each has a similar mission,to bring a ton of hop flavor and use the malts to mostly buffer off the excess bitterness. All 3 beers succeed.  Mouthfeel/ Quite fine. Here's some substance with sparkle,with aftertaste you'll think about an hour later...the whole deal.  Drinkability Not a big ABV..or a lightweight,flavorful yet not overbearing. NN brings much of what Hopslam has but at about $1 less a bottle...and ya gotta love that.

However, Nugget Nectar is really really good.  12oz bottle into .3l tulip. Popping fresh from afksports.  This pours a pure bright amber with a nice head and lacing that slides down the glass.  Solid aroma, both hoppy and full of malt without any of the sour or mash aroma that sometimes comes along with this style.  Very nice balanced taste. The floral hops in the nose melt right into the light malt middle and keeps a nice amount of bitter citrus right through to the end.  The whole package here is all what is so remarkable.

Tropical fruit hop aromas take this one over for sure.  Very very fruity on the taste as well. It almost seems like they mixed the beer with grapefruit or orange juice. It's perfect for springtime. The alcohol is sneaky so watch out.  Mouthfeel is incredibly smooth but a bit sticky. It has a resiny taste and feel from all the hops.

I definitely understand why hop-heads like the brew.  Mouthfeel - Buttery smooth. Very nice.  Drinkability - With the extreme hops, it perhaps a beer to pound down several in a row. With that said its one of the better brews I've had so far. Good job Troegs!!!  Overall - An exceptional and outstanding beer. I understand the hype now and think its quite justified after sampling. My only complaint is the $14 for 6pack cost where other comparable beers run around $9-$10. Perhaps that is because of the specialized hops in the ingredients.. It is a seasonal brew so I'll give them some slack because of how well its made.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,haazer,4.59,"Poured this treasure into a pint glass.  A- Beer pours a amber color, with decent carbonation. This beer is filtered completely, almost a dark clear amber, kinda a oxy moron. Pours a finger and half of khaki head. Head is bubbly, settles down to a nice thin layer on top. Leaves a tad bit of lacing.  S- Ahhhh the smell. Fresh Nugget Nectar aroma is hard to beat. Potent piney hops in the front, mixed in with a healthy blend of citrus and lemons. You can pick up a decent amount of caramel malts in the background. I detect some hints of honey also. Sniff this beer for all its worth and do it often before the hops weaken.  T- Taste is a lot like the aroma. Great pine, and resiney hops nail the palatte. The citrus is not as pronounced in the taste as the aromas, but it follows the hops nicely. The malt balance is there at the end, but then the aftertaste again becomes the hops, what the brew is all about!  M- Light to medium bodied, smooth yet crisp mouthfeel. The bitterness is there to make your tastebuds submit. Tingly from the nugget, warrior, and tomahawks spiked in this.  D- Overall a very drinkable beer. Alcohol is not present until after multiple of these. Which will occur because the taste will make you come back for more. Best drank fresh, as in get this right after it's released. Better yet if you can make it to the brewery and get it on tap. One of the best, if not the best offerings from Troegs.

Taste is similar featuring lots of sticky pine resin hop flavors up front with some malt sweetness and a relatively bitter resiny finish.  Mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium with tons of carbonation and a sticky overall feel. I always look forward to Nugget Nectar every winter but I prefer it on tap.

Has a nice amber look with shining yellow highlights, a nice full foamy head that dies after some time and leaves nice legs wherever it touches on the glass.  Smell was at first (near the front of the pour) almost IPA/Double IPA like in its awesome citrus and tangerine/pine hop character, but this smell died down once the head went down as well and took a back seat to the dry biscuity sweet wheaty maltiness of fine amber ales. Good stuff, just wish the hops stayed around through enjoying the beer.  Taste is consistently nice with the hops, and features a sugary sweet front and a semi bitter (not too much) citrusy back. Tangerine, bready notes, lemon zest and the signature amber malt strains prevail. A tasty brew for sure.  Mouthfeel is a nice medium to light feel, bitter on the tongue in the back, good carbonation.

Smells of caramel malts and a fruity hops aroma. Tastes of strong fruity hops and pine and a little pineapple or something. Mouthfeel is medium and drinkability is high.,Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,dayswonder,4.8,"A - Beautiful, dark copper color (looks great when held up to the light) with little head, but fantastic lacing.  S - A piny, citrus (lean toward grapefruit) scent. Very floral too a great smelling beer.  T - This beer's main draw for people. When you hold it up to take a sip you get a waft of the pine, but once it's in your mouth it molds into a citrus-y hopp-y conglomeration of deliciousness. Packed full of hops, but is well balanced and not obnoxious.  M - It's a bit sticky vaguely syrup-y, but it's from all the delicious nugget nectar...  D - All night long...only draw back is the ABV wish it was lower, but then again not...  An awesome beer and is a top five favorite of mine. I look forward to January for one reason...Troeg's Nugget Nectar.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Smell: fruity, mango-pinapple is prominent. slight bready malt smell in the background  Taste: woah...very hoppy bitterness but the fruitiness comes through nicely and is cleaned up by a slightly malty finish.  Mouthfeel: a pinish taste lingers behind but little else. actually very refreshing. can feel the carbonation.  Drinkability: This is the first time having nugget nectar and certainly won't be the last. A very fine beer.

694,15881,mobyfann,4.74,"Paid $2.20 for a single at Ludlow Wines in Clifton...  Pours clear and amber, 1/4"" head, decent retention and no lacing on the glass. Extremely nice smell of aromatic/floral hops, great malt and honey smell as well.  Yummy, a near-perfect hybrid of an amber ale meets IPA; the elements present on the nose are there in the taste, light in the mouth, no notice of alcohol; finishes dry with a honey-hop/sweet aftertaste. Easy in the mouth, but a creamier head would make this beer near perfect. A great session beer whose mild sweetness will pace your drink-flow.  Final Thought: HIGHEST RATED BEER, WOW (300+ reviews), says it all.  This is a must for people who love amber ales and IPA's; Troegs really mastered this gem.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

694,15881,seeswo,4.4,"Pours amber with a white head. Smell of hops and citrus. Smells really good, not overpowering, but enjoyable. Taste is of a really balanced, strong hop forward flavor. Tempered bitterness, like having a jalapeño sauce that tastes like jalapeño but isn't spicy. The mouthfeel is right on, moderate carbonation. This is a scary drinkable, hop forward beer.

694,15881,Rschis16,4.47,"A: Pretty amber or burnt orange color with a nice fluffy head that reduces to a thin head as you drink.  S: It hit me hard at first and let me know I was getting into a beer that I'd like. Hops are very prevalent like you find with bigger IPAs. Citrus behind that blending into a very welcoming aroma.  T: Expected it to be a big hoppy almost DIPA from the smell but found that it was much milder than that. The hops are certainly there though and very appreciated. They don't get in the way of the nice citrusy crispness. Perfect blend of hops that make for a nice, hoppy and balanced beer. Now I know what all the hype was about.  M: Somewhat creamy and crisp? Nicely carbonated with a bitterness that makes the taste pop.  D: Could definitely see myself tossing back several of these with ease. Higher ABV may make it harder to keep up with it but I doubt the flavor will ever be lost.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,BeerBuckeye,4.48,"A - Pours a deep reddish amber, good amount of carbonation rising from the bottom. Small, 1 finger head that dissipates quickly, lacing goes down the glass with the beer.  S - I can smell the beer from about a foot away. Sort of some citrusy pine, a mango/peach scent with a good malt background.  T - Lots and lots of hops right up front. It feels like a good American IPA/DIPA, but there is that good amount of maltiness in there. Much more bitterness than sweet, but the finish is just the slightest bit sweet.  M - A decent amount of carbonation is present in the mouth. It somewhat coats the throat, not much alcohol presence, hidden very nicely.  D - Very flavorful and a good amount of bitterness. It's certainly a nice beer to just enjoy, but incredibly drinkable.  Overall - My first experience with Nugget Nectar and I'm very, very impressed. The beer's appearance and smell are just wonderful.

All of their brews seem to share some similar malty sweetness, although this beer has a unique sweet hoppy smell. Overall a very well balance nose.  T: Hoppy sweetness seems to be the strongest point of this beer as the beer hits you with a very well balanced bitterness which fades into a malty sweetness that is very welcoming. Some slight warming in the end, but everything seems to work very well together  M/D: a little lighter body than I expect/might want, but overall a very drinkable beer with some fantastic qualities",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Scents of mango, peach, apricot, and orange. Hoppy citrus is in there too.  T - Flavors of fresh cut citrus fruit (mango, apricot, kiwi, and orange) are coupled with bright hop bitterness. It's balanced out by a nice malt backbone. I swear it tastes like they brewed this with fruit.  M - Moderate bodied and ticklish carbonation make this an easy drinker. Quite smooth, yet crisp and refreshing.  O - If only this flavorful of a beer could be brewed at a lower gravity, I could drink this all day. The only downside (if you can call it that) is the ABV.

694,15881,inlimbo77,4.15,"12oz bottle poured into snifter. FRESH beer. Dated 2011.  A: I love the look of this one! Clear, amber gold color. Definitely filtered, as there is no hazy in this one.  S: HOPS...and more hops. I love the nose. Very florally with some citrus. Actually though I was digging into a West Coast style when I popped the top.  T: Don't get me wrong, it's very hoppy and fresh. But there is a malt finish/backbone to this one. I was surprised actually.  M: This does have some body to it, but not overpowering in the mouthfeel. Definitely not sticky or anything.  D: Very drinkable! I love that this time around I got in 12oz 6-pack....whereas the 22oz bottle before. I could have downed many!

694,15881,Rhettroactive,4.47,"From bomber to pint glass on 1/27/11  A: This beer has been filtered, and therefore has great clarity. I wouldn't go out of my way to call it ""red"" in color, but it is a light shade of amber in my glass. Good head on an average pour, around 1.75 fingers. The lacing, though present, doesn't seem to stick, but rather run down the glass, which is not quite what I was expecting.  S: Pineapple upside down cake. Yummm - fresh hops! I literally pop the cap and it hits me like a ton of bricks. I don't even have to put my nose in the glass, the heavenly scent simply drifts through the air and easily finds my schnoz.  T: Quite spectacular. It's amazing how this beer is hopped like a heavy American IPA or DIPA, but yet has the really forceful malt backbone of a red. I think if this wasn't as fresh, the malt would certainly overwhelm and could easily make this beer fall apart. As it stands now, it's simply amazing. Close my eyes and I'd swear I'm drinking an IPA! As the fresh hop oil and malt dissipate, I get a very biscuity finish.  M: I sometimes wonder if it's the mouthfeel that seals the deal with a good beer, as it really is so very important. In the case of Nugget Nectar, it's perfect. Medium to heavy mouthfeel - certainly weightier then a standard IPA, with carbonation that's just right.  O: I'll admit I was ever so slightly skeptical about this one, as I wasn't a huge fan of the Troeg bother's Mad Elf. But I'm simply astounded by how much I throughly enjoy this beer. Nugget Nectar is a game changer - IPA hops and a red's malty spine. I would highly recommend drinking this fresh, as the hop profile is magnificent. For $4.99 a bomber, I plan on stocking up.  Insanely drinkable, and absolutely worth seeking out.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

D= Really drinkable really enjoyed this beer.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,russwbeck,4.35,"Picked up from the brewery, bottled on 1/18/11  A: Clear amber pour with a frothy white head that rests atop throughout the entire drink, a few lacing. 4  S: Smell is filled with hops. Lots and lots of hops! Nice malty backbone to balance it out. 4  T: Like the smell, the taste is full of hops and has a nice bitterness to it up front, a bit piney even. It's all held together by a maltiness that rears its head at the end, and stays with you. 4.5  MF: Light and crisp, keeps you coming back for more. 4.5  D: Really high. Extremely enjoyable beer. 4.5  ---  Since the above review, I have had Nugget Nectar on firkin twice. The first at Z Bar at the Deli and the second at Zeno's Pub. I wanted to update my review to match that.  The firkin version is much more balanced. The drop in carbonation produces a much less hop forward beer, and a much more drinkable one as well. The balance is truly amazing and I could drink it all night. For me, the firkin version is what puts this beer in an elite category.  ---  2012 Vintage, bottled (I believe) on 1/27/12, reviewed on 3/23/12  A: Deep red-orange pour with around a finger of wispy white head, filled with large bubbles. The retention here is really phenomenal and and leaves behind lacing on the glass to remind you of where its been. 4.5  S: Citrus, grapefruit and piney hops rest on top of your caramel malt backbone that is more typical of the Amber Ale style. Smells much more like an IPA than an Amber. 4.5  T: The taste this year is a bit stepped back from previous years. I posit it comes from the different water Troegs used to brew it. The hops just seem toned down from what I remember. The balance is there with the malts playing a small, but important role. The taste is much more fruity than I recall, with a lot of citrus and an average amount of bitter hops taking over. This seems to be more like a strong Amber than the Nugget Nectar I learned to love. 4  MF: Light to medium body with an average amount of carbonation. This has a nice dry finish and leaves a nice taste on the palate for a good while. The best quality of Nugget Nectar is its drinkability, which is perfect. 5  O: I look forward to this every year. It's priced well, delicious, and well regarded. I do, however, hop next year returns this beer to its former glory.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

This is the cat pee-y-ist smelling beer I've ever jammed my nose into ... and I feel almost embarrassed to say just how delicious that smell seemed to me.

694,15881,Hellabeerguzzler,4.3,"a - very nice. Reddish rust colored clear brew with a white generous head and nice lacing.  s - everything you'd come to expect from a well-brewed big-hop ale. Big citra hops with a nice floral, grassy mixture that drifts around the room!  t - Troegs has always had great beers. I enjoy almost their entire offering. Delicious and no alchy dryness. Not under-carbonated - just right. Hops dominate of course but there enough depth to appreciate the beer for more than its specialty.  m - It is called Nugget Nectar and the label reinforces what they want to give you with this one. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated and taste is a little sticky and will hang around a bit.  d - is good. I'd put this higher on my scale if it wasn't quite SO hoppy. But then what the hell did you buy it for dickweed? The label is a hand squeezing a softball-sized hop nugget. Cmon.  Working through a case of this, with many reviews and trys in between I have to say that this is a delicious brew with multiple hop flavors from citrus to piney and earthy. It's highly drinkable and really just an excellent beer. Good work again Troegs. I love January!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,ShanePB,4.48,"Bottle dated 1/5/11, consumed two weeks later.  A - Crystal clear soft auburn body with a steady stream of carbonation. Big & fluffy white head that leaves a respectable foam ring and wonderful lacing.  S - Citrus hops dominate the nose, with some floral backing. An overall sweet caramel or honey malt base provides some diversity. This smells absolutely incredible and lures you right into the glass for a tasting...  T - Noticeable citrus hops coat the palate with a strangely unique ""sweet"" bite, assuming from the malt. Caramel again plays off the citrusy hops, though the grassy & floral I got in the nose seems to be all but absent now. No complaints. I want to keep using honey to describe how well the sweet qualities get blended with the hops - very delicious and balanced.  M - Smooth, creamy and bubbly mouth feel, medium-bodied.  D - I literally could sit and drink these all day. An absolutely fantastic, easy drinking beer, even at 7.5% ABV.  This is what makes winter great: Nugget Nectar. I wish this were a year-round beer, because it's truly unique and puts the traditional ""Amber Ale"" mentality to shame.

Hardly any carbonation from the bottom upon pour as well.  Hope front on the nose and grass but still small. Mostly a dominant strong hop smell, resiny.  Good tasting gives was to mellow orange and hops and an excellent body. Nice mix of citrus orange and hop balance. Good bread taste upon inhales off palate with a solid mouthfeel.

A - Pours a vibrant reddish orange hue, crystal clear with countless streams of carbonation eager to replenish the head as it disappears. The head itself is a light khaki color, coming in strong at 2.5-fingers, but with moderately low retention. Lacing is sporadic and not very generous.  S - Smell is fresh, fresh hops, filled with wonderful pine and floral scents. There's some slight citrus here, but this beer is more focused on an airy, pine sap, flower type of aroma. That's what I prefer, so this nose is just heaven to me.  T - For how chock full of hops this beer is, it covers its bitterness pretty well. The beginning is a tad sweet before being overtaken by some slight grapefruit, wet pine, before ending with a pleasantly bitter finish. Simple yet eloquent.  M - Mouthfeel is light bodied moderate carbonation. Doesn't coat much or destroy the palate, but I could feel it linger and fight to stick to the enamel on my teeth. Pretty smooth as well.  D - Drinkability is high. So easy to drink and as soon as I put it down I'm looking to grab it again.

The hops are wonderfull tasting and do not over power the malt thus being well balanced. I can taste to a degree pine resin and some citrus qualities. A smooth, medium to full body beer that rolls around your mouth and down your throat effortlessly. A tad bitter on the aftertaste.

Despite being a lifelong Pennsylvanian, this is the first time I've gotten my hands on Nugget Nectar and I'm pretty psyched.  The beer pours an orange/amber with a thick finger of off-white head that took its time to recede to some great lacing.  The nose is dominated by citrusy hops. There is a strong grapefruit/orange smell with a slight touch of pine. The taste is quite similar. The hops dominate the taste, but they are well balanced. A healthy dose of fresh citrus flavor helps to keep the hops from being overpowering. A great tasting beer.  The mouthfeel is thick and oil. The beer seems to cling to the sides of mouth. The drinkability is through the roof. This is a great tasting, easy to drink beer.  Troegs really hit a home run with Nugget Nectar. I can't believe I haven't had it before now. I'll be running out to get more for certain.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,psuKinger,4.38,"Bottle dated 12/21/2010, meaning this beer is exactly 1 month old. Not as fresh as I'd like it to be, but based on previous experience with this brew, it should be fresh enough for a stellar review. It will be poured into a standard curved-shaker pint glass.  It has always been my opinion that this is the best beer brewed by Pennsylvania's most talented and original brewery. I really wish they made this thing be a year-round, but it is what it is. As such, I just try to enjoy it as much as possible during it's seasonal release.  A: Pours a translucent golden-reddish hued bear with a nice frothy 1 finger head on top. The middle of my pour has taken on that big, forthy, bubbly look that I like so much and reminds me of pancake batter. Very nice. And it's leaving great lacing around my glass as I work my way to the bottom.  S: Big smell of grapefruit an tart citrus coming out of this beer. Very pleasing.  T: Wow. Smooth at first, with a very mild malt backbone shining through at first giving it a pleasant level of sweetness before getting out of the way and letting the hops shine through.  And the hops do dominate here. Strong flavors of grapefruit with some other citric subtleties (maybe a touch of mango?) dominate, with the near-perfect amount of hop bitterness at the end to balance it out. If I was to critique this beer at all, it could actually use just a TOUCH more hop bitterness to really round it out and make it a near-straight 5.0 experience.  M: Thick hop oils dominate throughout, and leave a good tongue-coating of hop oils on the finish.  D: High. This beer is unique enough and complex enough that it can be served solo and be considered a ""tasty treat"", but smooth enough and balanced enough that I could crush it all night long and be quite happy about the circumstances.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

694,15881,xnicknj,4.6,"12oz bottle poured into dfh signature glass  Pours a crystal clear burnt auburn color with some darker hues around the glass. A well toned head retains with some bubbly film and plenty of patchy lacing on the glass.  A lovely burst of grapefruit hops in the nose swirled with some slightly sweeter fruits and just enough bready malt base.  Waves of juicy hops kick off the profile with an explosion of fruit flavor and pleasant bitterness. Grapefruit intensifies the hop attack, which wraps itself around the palate. A doughy, bready malt base adds in some light sweetness with hints of caramel. Finishes with another punch of stark hop bitterness and some lingering dryness.  Medium bodied, milder carbonation, way smoother on the palate than you might think, and goes down incredibly easy. The alcohol is masked just enough, and seems to sit just right at 7.5%.  There's very few beers at this point that I can see myself drinking more than one or two of in a sitting, and Nugget Nectar is one of them.

Appearance: Beautiful crystal clear amber color with a 2 finger white head.  Smell: blast of citrus! especially oranges and pinapples. Slight caramel coming through at the end.  Taste: nice bitter bite from the hops and also alot of tropical fruits with a malty backbone. The best well balanced brew I had in awhile.

694,15881,Bmoyer0301,4.42,"Appearance:  Popped the cap off this super fresh bottle which is dated only two weeks ago. I was greeted with a generous amount of carbonation gasses and hissing from the 12oz bottle. Poured into my DFH bubbled pint glass straight on and was left with a one finger thick bone white head that stayed around for a while. When I hold my glass up to the light there is a deep amber almost orange hue to this crystal clear ale. Lots of tiny bubbles streaming from the bottom of my glass which reminds me of champagne. On the swirl the viscosity is medium and not to heavy leaving whit streaks on the walls.  Smell:  Bright copious amounts of pine and citrus loaded hops. Oranges, lemons, pine sap, slight alcohol, caramel and toffee notes. Something that resembles grapefruits skins and pulp are floating around my nose. Very good!  Taste:  Ohhh man sooo fresh...Pliny ain't got shit on this beer when its right from the brewery fresh. Slick and waxy coating of fresh hops stick to my teeth and I'm enjoying licking them clean! Tropical fruits, minty, some earthy spice and slight alcohol in the middle round out all the fresh clean flavors.

Taste: Bitey bitter hops, bitter grapefruit mixed with some malty sweetness towards the end.  Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied and smooth.  Drinkability: Neck and neck with Flying Mouflan as my favorite beer from Troegs.

694,15881,victory4me,4.3,"Poured bottle dated 1/3/11 into a standard shaker.  About a week ago I deleted all 75 of my reviews. I didn't like them, it was time for a change. I held out for my all time favorite beer to do my first review.  Pours orange-amber, perfectly clear with a one-finger head. A quality looking beer for sure, although nothing spectacular. Smell is not as overwhelming as I remember, but the memories it brings are pleasant. My least favorite thing about ultra-fresh NN is the pronounced Simcoe in the aroma (some will call it cat piss or urinal cakes). I can get past the Simcoe as I've gotten quite used to it over the years.  Taste is right there where I remember. Tons and tons of fresh, bitter, citrusy hops. The malt is there, but completely overpowered. Nice dry finish with a slight lingering bitterness. Mouthfeel is thin, but not cloying. Strong drinkability.  Looking forward to drinking this on cask sometime in the following weeks. Not the best beer in the world, but still my all-time favorite. I am one of the few that believes the quality of this beer increases over the first month before going down hill. May make adjustments when I drink this same bottling date 2-3 weeks from now.  Very affordable for the quality of the product.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,CuriousMonk,4.46,Had this beer several times in different places - on tap and by bottle. Pours a hazed orange with a nice cream colored head. Aroma was resinous pine and citrus hops with a good amount of caramel malt to back it up. Flavor was malty yet very bitter and hoppy at the same time. Such a good balance of sweet malts and hops made me want to keep comming back for more.

694,15881,johntangus,4.52,"I haven't reviewed a beer in a long time, and while it deserves much more than my pathetic attempt at a review, it was a gift and I'd like to record my impressions.  First and foremost, thanks to cmurren25 for the awesome beers.  This beer was poured from the bottle into my duvel tulip. It's clarity is brilliant and the color is a garnet-hued amber. The head wasn't huge, and mostly disappeared, leaving a small white ring that clings to the sides leaving a trace of lacing as the glass empties.  As I jam my beak into the tulip and inhale deeply, i get grapefruit and pine followed by a bit of alcohol - but this may simply be an aftertaste from my last sip.  In drinking the beer, pine and grapefruit grace the tongue. As the sip passes the back of the tongue, the rye and amber malt shows itself. But then as the sip leaves the mouth on its way to the tummy, the delicious hop bitterness assaults the senses and leaves the mouth dry. The hop presence stays on the palate even after the glass is empty.  The mouthfeel is substantial yet finishes dry and nicely bitter.  I drank the entire beer while writing this review. And while this beer is dangerously drinkable, I'm a light-weight and could probably only drink two in a sitting. Which is fine. This beer is made for enjoying.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,wvsabbath,4.35,"Serving Type - Bottle  Appearance - Burnt orange, much like grapefruit juice, 1 inch head that disappered quickly. Some lacing.  Smell - Hops, rye, lots of citrus fruits. Some carmal and plenty of malts  Taste - A great combination of hops, rye and amber ale as you can get. Its a bold sweet hop kick with amber rye flavor and bold strong malts. Hops are very present but the malts sweeten them up. Not bitter at all.  Mouthfeel - A real treat for you mouth. Bitter hops tickle tounge, sweet malts and carmael cover palette and balance this all together. Aftertaste is mild and bitter from hops, leaving you wanting more!  Drinkability - This is awesome. Only reason i didnt give this a 5 is cause it is 7.5 %, just strong enough to not suck down like water. This is probily the best beer troegs makes. Troegs really needs to make this year round beer.

Tastes like some serious hop. Kegged 2 days before and really can't get much fresher on the hop profile. Strong malt backbone to hold the hops up.

The smell of nugget hops plumed out of this beer upon opening. Taste is important with this brew, and I feel that I fail to describe the complexity of it. I detect at the front of the mouth intense bitter/ sweet hopness that opens into a pine grapefruit peel like flavor that moves and changes into an awesome hoppy afterflavor and burps!

Michael Jackson the musician.  It pours reddish amber with a bubbly head that settles and dissipates but maintains lacing and legs. Smells like citrus, rich malts and despite Nugget Nectar being a red ale, the hops are still present. At the start you taste the sweetness, caramel, toffee, like your typical red ale. But it's more complex than usual, and the hops also bite. By the end, the alcohol hits in at 7.5% but you don't notice because you're still enjoying the malty hop blend.

A - A tall pour leaves a hazy golden orange amber beer in the glass with a dense off-white topping of foam. Great retention but little lace left over. More lace was left on the glass after it was drank from.

It's very nicely balanced.  T - Tons of citrusy hops. Pine resin and grapefruit with a bit of lemon crispness, this tastes more like an IPA than an amber. Good backing of amber malts. Not as sweet as the aroma lets on, some earthiness pokes through.  M - Medium-full bodied and smooth with a moderate carbonation level. Slightly dry and mildly bitter with a solid citrus kick to the finish.

It looks like an IPA in color, not an amber. Slightly hazy. It had a thick, rich, firm wite head that left lots of lacing behind.  Aroma was very nice given that this couldn't be that super fresh of a beer. Lots of pine, some citrus and a robust malt presence, though not overly sweet smelling.  Taste was great. Lots of hop flavor but also a really rich malty character. Very bready and malty. I'm not sure what to call it. It's certainly not an amber -- it's paler than Troegs Hopback Amber & isn't all that caramelly. It's certainly got IPA hopping. But the malt is rich and complex like a bock. I guess I'd call it an IPA with a good load of Munich malt in the grainbill. Wonderful beer.  Mouthfeel was a bit full for a 7.5%abv beer. It feels like a 10-12%abv DIPA in mouthfeel but is closer to a straight IPA in abv. Overall, this was a highly drinkable beer.

694,15881,dubinsky,5,"Yeah, i know you all think this beer past its prime after sitting in my fridge for such a long time, well you know what, YOU'RE WRONG. This beer simply kicks as much ass today as it did the day it was bottled, the only difference is that its now mellow.  A- Pours a clear, delicious golden-amber-orange color, with a one finger head that dissipates quickly, and leaves a nice lace on the glass.  S- Um, do i really need to tell you all how awesome this smells? Well, in case you don't already know, its amazing. Strong floral hops, honey blossoms, lavender and lemon. Underneath it all hides a wonderfully sweet malt aroma.  T- Um, do i really need to tell you all how awesome this tastes? Taste is delicious. A hop BOMB! The same flavors as the smell: floral hops, honey, and malt.  M- Great carbonation, and medium body.  D- I love this beer and cant wait to get another trade in with an East Coaster. Its incredibly drinkable, and dangerously session-able. One of my top 10 beers",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,hayesez,4.16,"It's always nice when the shipments of Nugget Nectar reach the Haute. Although it's been a few months since the latest release, I thought I would toss up my review of this fine ""Amber."" Had my most recent one at a gathering a few nights ago. Poured into a standard pint glass.  Pours a coppery amber color with a thin light colored head. Very clear, with moderate amounts of lace left behind.  A nice hoppy citrusy nose is my favorite part of the Nugget Nectar. Smaller notes of pine and even some sweet caramel are also present. I really enjoy the intensity of the citrus smell, with the subtleties of the rest.  Tastes similar to the smell with the noticeable sweet malts being pushed aside by the prominent hoppiness. The caramel smell is also found in the drink, although also quite subtle. I wish there was just a bit more. Citrus and a bit of pine - and a sharp bitterness that is just a little bit detracting. Additionally, the mouthfeel is a just a bit on the thin side.  I do like Nugget Nectar, but I feel like the flavors just don't quite work together as well as they could. Fairly drinkable, and still a beer that I look forward to every year.  Consumed: 8/6/2010",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,fear025,4.15,"Aroma:I get hops and sweet malt in the nose. The hop aromas are citrus and pine.  Appearance:This beer has an amber/red color, with a good sized head, and ok head retention.  Taste:The bitter hops make quite an impression up front. There is lots of pine flavor in this one. There is also an underlying caramel sweetness that counteracts the bitterness in the hops wonderfully.  Mouthfeel:This beer has a medium-full body, and is quite smooth with only a little hop astringency. Nice amount of carbonation.  Drinkability:I really enjoyed this beer, it's a great example of it's style.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

694,15881,malty,4.13,"Pours a brilliantly clear glowing copper/amber with a dense & fluffy off-white 1"" settled head. Some visible uprising carbonation erupting from the center of my stemmed Ayinger tulip style chalice. Gorgeous vertically thick rings of lace all the way down.  Sweet, syrupy malty goodness is totally surrounded by fresh, zesty, tropical fruity hops. From what I distinctly remember from Pliney the Elder's nose, this beer is very similar. This keen familiarity is the scent of tamarind. That's right, tamarind. It's found in many Thai dishes and I cannot escape it's sweet, spicy and earthy elements. The entire bouquet is very fresh (yes, I know this is over 4 months old by now) and had held up very nicely. Sweet, earthy and definitely hoppy.  Tastes EXACTLY like it smells. Even the tamarind. The maltiness is more mellow than sweet though, but still makes for a solid platform for the hops to showcase themselves. Since this ale is mostly about hops, they seem to play very well together. The tropical notes I smelled earlier have morphed into a more earthy flavor. Still very pronounced, but more mineral-like in flavor.  Mouthfeel is perfectly soft, medium bodied and just the right amount of fine carbonation. The semi-spicy/sweet finish is long lasting.  Drinkability is through the roof.  Overall this ale was very pleasing to me. It was a bit difficult to pinpoint the fine nuances of flavors, but I think I can attribute this to my unfamiliarity of the Nugget, Warrior and Tomahawk hop. Maybe I've had these hops in different beers, but for some reason they're not jumping out at me, (unless Pliney the Elder uses any of these?). A great beer worthy of it's broad and vocal fan base.

694,15881,Genghis22,4.12,"A - Pours a bright and clear amber with a nice creamy white head, which quickly disappeared. A good amount of carbonation is visible.  S - Hoppy bitterness. Not the floral, piney hops you would expect from an IPA. There is clearly a strong malt backbone, which is indicitive of the style. Very enticing. A touch of lacing.  T - Delicious carmel amber ale, gets hopped! This is great. Before I got super crazy out of control into IPAs, Amber Ales were always one of my ""go to"" styles. This beer takes me back, but gives me some beefy hops to satisfy my current fixation. The initial taste has the characteristic malty amber sweetness. The finish is quick and dry, and aftertaste is nice and bitter.  M - A nice full bodied beer. A little biscuity, a little chewy, but certainly not syrupy. Highly carbonated, but works very well for the beer. Leaves the tongue very dry.  D - Absolutely! This beer has everything, for just about everyone. Sweet caramel maltyness, great hoppy bitterness. Smooth drinking, and a virtually undetectable ABV.

Taste has all the hops you'd expect but balanced by a buttery toasted toffee malt, basically if you take a east-coast ipa and crank the malt up two more levels, its that kind of balance going on here. Still alot of Citrus, once again oranges with some astringint rind bitterness on the finish.  on the tongue its very creamy with a low to mid level of carbination, but i did a semi-vigorous pour, a very buttery texture for the style.

694,15881,GarrettMD,4.33,"This is the 6th beer in the Blind Beers BIF that I tasted. I reviewed this beer without knowing what I was drinking, these are my notes before finding out what it was.  A - pours a clear light amber with 1 finger white foamy head. good carbonation bubbles coming up, great head retention, good lacing.  S - Smells like piney and citrus hops, some malt aroma, maybe a little roasted character?  T - Taste is more piney hops, some slight citrus notes but not much. Malt is just about as pronounced as it is on the nose. Could this be another IPA? some light alcohol burn on the finish. The more I taste this beer, the more the malt sticks out, slightly roasted with caramel malts maybe an over-hopped amber.  M - medium bodied, good carbonation, oily mouthfeel from the hops, finish isn't too dry, slight alcohol burn, malts stay around as well.  D - Good drinkability, probably around 6-6.5% ABV, rounds out nicely leaving you wanting another sip. Maybe this is something from victory? Maybe Troegs Nugget Nectar? Actually, the more I think about it, this could very well be Nugget Nectar with the malt character. I have never had it, but I know what it is supposed to be like. I'm going to just make an outright guess at Nugget Nectar.  I had never tried Nugget Nectar, I just knew what its characteristics were.

(I know you can't see the paper, but just sit back and let the words paint a picture for ya.) It pours a hazy orange amber topped by a short-lived finger of white micro-foam. The nose is all up in your face (...as are most noses, now that I think about it...) with pine backed by what seems like some creamy caramel. Yes, I can smell creamy. Deal with it. The taste follows almost exactly, heavy on the pine, a decent backbone of smooth and creamy caramel. (Told ya.) A hint of flowers is in there as well, but not in much abundance. The body is light but weighty (...), with a mild carbonation and a kinda sticky finish.

694,15881,misinformed,3.68,"Review from 7/7. I had two bottles of this and reviewed the first one, but held off typing it up until I had the 2nd bottle in case of any differences. Poured in to a pint glass both times.  A- Clear red-orange. Poured with a 1 finger pale off-white head. Small bubble carbonation present.  S- Citrus, hops up front. Some malt. General sweetness as well.  T- Citrusy hops up front. Light floral notes as well. Some malt and maybe a hint of grain followed again by the hops. This leaned towards the sweet side, but there was some bitterness as well. For me the citrus and sweetness culminated in a taste very similar to grapefruit with powdered sugar sprinkled on it. Leans heavily towards the hops, but was still quite sweet.  M- Light to medium. Slightly sticky. Smooth and light with some tiny bubble carbonation.  D- So so. I can definitely see why people enjoy this, but it didn't really strike a chord with me.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,connecticutpoet,4.4,"Just got a book that really has convinced me it's time to move on from my pint glasses and invest in the proper glassware. Unfortunately, this one was enjoyed from my standard Shaker pint. Still, I managed to get a half finger head on it. Body was clear amber. Fit the style well.  Aroma started with sharp citrusy hops. It also smelled sweet and syrupy. It was hard to pick out any malt. Still, I am a hophead, so this didn't bother me in the slightest.  Taste began with sharp bittering hops and hop resins. This faded and flowed into a clean caramel malt flavor, which was quite refreshing. There was a light bitter aftertaste, much less so than the initial taste led me to expect. To me, this seemed the best of both worlds.  Mouthfeel was pretty good. A little thick and syrupy, but not overly so.  Drinkability was awesome. As mentioned above, very refreshing. It didn't hit too hard, and when I was done I wished I had more. If not for the ABV, this would be a great session beer.

T: Very sweet, yet balanced and smooth. It has a kick of hops but the malts on the tail end round it out nicely.

Underneath the hops is a nice understanded malty aroma.  T- Taste is delicious, but a little muted compared to the smell. Pretty much the same flavors as the smell: floral hops, rich malty backbone with ints of honey and oats. The taste is great, but it deviates a little from the style, hence my rating.  M- Solidly medium bodied. Moderate carbonation, not much bite, but a rich cream that rolls the flavor around the mouth.  D- This one is drinkable. Delicious, with a great appearance, aroma, and taste. If anything, it might be a tad sweet, but I doubt you'd notice that(or at least be tired of it) before bottle number 3.

The taste has several different layers. Honey maltiness up front with a perfect balance of citrus hops. Slightly bitter finish, that is rounded out with an oak aftertaste. This really resembles an oak aged ale, in smell and taste.  Good mouthfeel, but this beer is a little too thick for me for a brew that is such a close relative to an IPA.

Head was almost 2-fingers with an aggressive pour which settled into a coating. Lacing was there all the way. And that heavenly smell.... Oranges, floral and piney hops. Taste - still pretty frickin' delicious. Creamy and smooth, this seems to go back and forth from the sweet fruit to hop dry and bitter with the almost honey backbone ultimately winning out.

S: nice piney hops, caramel, citrus fruits and malts in the aromas with hints of boozw.  T: nice mild bitter piney hop flavor with caramel and citrus fruit that have a good balance between the sweet malts.  M: light to medium body with a good amount of carbonation to accent the flavor and has a pleasent bitter finish.  D; Even though it's probably not as fresh as it could be it is still a great beer all around. I'm glad I have another bottle of it.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Dangus,4.32,"This is my first review, so here we go. Beer is served pretty cold and poured from a bottle into a standard pint glass.  Appearance- An appealing orangey amber color. Poured very small amount of head that didn't stick around for too long. Doesn't look overly carbonated.  Smell- Wow, what a delicious floral smell. I get some malts as well in an initial smell. Smells delightfully hoppy.  Taste- Very tasty. It's malty and sweet and finishes slightly bitter. It has a taste that reminds me of grapefruit. The hops are very flavorful but not overpowering. The 7.5% ABV is masked well. I do not taste a bit of the alcohol.  Mouthfeel- Carbonation is just right. There is enough carbonation to tingle your taste buds, but not enough to sting your tongue. Mouthfeel is also not watery; I can tell that I am drinking a beer.  Drinkability- The drinkability is outstanding. This is a perfect beer to drink on a warm day. I could put a few of these back and enjoy the weather.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,ghostwalker,4.3,"A: Reddish amber body. One finger of head, falls off fast.  N: Sharp, crisp hop nose. Grainy malt nose hides behind.  T: Tangy, crispy hops with a smooth creamy malt backbone. Much like an IPA/ IIPA, but the malt/hop balance is much more in tune with an amber.  M: Creaminess vies with a bit of the old IPA strippiness. A pleasure to sip.  D: Very high. Goes down easy, the ABV is not very noticeable. Great stuff!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,ekardz,4.65,"Thanks to G311 - received as an extra in a trade we did.  A - reddish amber, decent carbonation, no head, looks inviting.  S - citrus - pineapple/orange scent, nice hop profile, some piney notes.  T - delicious hop blend, sweet, excellent blend of ingredients, nice light citrus taste comes through as well.  M - light on the front, gets heavier bodied as it goes down, mild carbonation, very smooth.  D - very drinkable, will seek out on my own next time. a great beer, a must have.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,haddon,4.3,"A- a gorgeous golden amber hue, clear, with a frothy white cap. nice lacing all the way down  S- pine mixed with caramel, good amount of hops, a citric blend as well.  T- Slightly sweet, malty background but with good amount of hops to go with it. little on the bready, malty side but great balance.  M- medium to full body with light carbonation  D- most impressed by the drinkability of this beer. clean, crisp and refreshing... could drink it all night!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,KickInTheChalice,4.42,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. Thanks to Davolebomb for the hookup.  Appearance: Pours a very transparent amber color with a thick welcoming head. Nice retention and some lace stick.  Smell: Very hoppy, mostly grassy and herbal, with some citrus as well. Roast malt sweetness stays in the background.  Taste: There is toasted malt here, although my hop sensors would not believe me. The variety of hops create a nice, complex flavor. Some spiciness resides on the tongue, grapefruit and apricot hops give a tart pop, and the herbal notes create an interesting finish.  Mouthfeel: Rocky carbonation bubbles in my mouth. Slightly lighter than a medium body, due to the creaminess. Very oily finish, probably due to the herbal / grassy hops.  Drinkability: Yea, this is good. It appeals to my hophead alternative personality without being ridiculous or overwhelming. Solid all the way through.  Nugget Nectar on my list of ""must try fresh"" beers after this tasting.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,AgentZero,3.88,"A - Pretty much a clear, golden beer with some orange tinge to it. Nice looking two finger head with some decent lacing to it. Nice looking beer.  S - A lot more hoppy than I would have guessed coming from an amber. Bitter, floral hop profile, with an obvious malt backbone.  T - Taste is pretty much what I would have expected given the nose. Bitter, resiny hops profile with a slightly sweet malt backbone. It's a pretty hoppy amber, almost IPAish.  M - Touch creamy, lighter side of medium bodied, smooth, decent carbonation.  D - Pretty good, although the resiny hops in this knocks this down a touch, the bitterness just starts to feedback a little too much. Very nice though, would seek it out again.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,DosBeerigos,4.12,"C. Clear H. Amber/Gold in color N. Hops Hops and more Hops, Sweet Candy, (very balanced)  I was looking forward to this since I got it in on a trade. I looked forward to comparing it to the other semi-hyped Hoppy Beers. Well it stood its ground. An EXTREMELY solid Amber beer with a huge hop backing to it and a nice malt balance. Although personally I would prefer less malt and more hop bitterness. Regardless, I know I say that a lot of beers are easy to drink, but this one just went down soo easy, and was really full of flavor. While I had high expectations for this beer it really did live up to the hype. I would say this is defiantly a beer that you HAVE to try.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,DLReeves,4.68,"What an interesting find. Pours golden/orange with solid head that recedes somewhat rapidly making it drink as a liquid rather than a foamy nothing. Pleasant full taste, hoppy yet subdued at the same time. With a pretty strong ABV, its soething one has to be careful with so as to enjoy it without passing out or DUI later!!  As my most important criteria for any beer or ale, if I like it, I care less about technical stuff. I like it. So does my better half so its a definite re-buy...from consumer beverages in Williamsville NY",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

694,15881,beer2day,4.38,"Solid gold pour with strong orange tints. Sturdy 2-finger head, leaving behind a nice 1/2 finger well through the glass. Excellent lacing, thick strands lining all sides of the glass.  Big floral hop nose. Slight esters and biscuit as well, from the amber malt. Faintest hint of strawberry licorice.  Hops come out right at the front, with pine more than grapefruit. Strong malt body gives this a thick profile. Creamy and smooth, with a very light astringency in the finish. Hops linger for a nice long ride.  I can easily drink 3 of these at a siting, though at 7.5% I'm not so sure that is such a good idea.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

No real haziness to speak of.  S: Floral and herbal nose. Smells fresh and deliciously hoppy.  T: Great hop bitterness. Nice malty backbone. Slightly sweet, honey, great overall balance with this brew.  M: Medium bodied. Very little carbonation.  D: Excellent smoothness for the alcohol content. Would be easy to drink several of these well balanced brews.  Summary: Excellent hit of hops from the hop combo of nugget, tomahawk, and warrior. Would easily have this one again.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,jkrich,4.2,"Poured a clear, reddish brown with a quickly dissipating white head. This ale was bottled on 2/11/10.  There was a strong resiny aroma competing with the caramel sweetness when I opened the bottle. Poured into a Samuel Adams' pint glass, the malt aroma becomes dominant. As the ale warms there are hints of fruit.  I was surprised by the balanced flavor considering this is called an ""imperial amber"". While this a hoppier version of an amber style, it can hardly be considered a hop bomb. The pleasing malt flavor complements a little hop bitterness.  This is medium bodied with restrained carbonation. The mouthfeel is slick and a little sweet on the palate.  This is dangerously drinkable at 7.5 ABV. The alcohol is well hidden. I am sure this would carry a greater hop kick if I consumed it just after bottling. I really enjoy the balanced flavor.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,pastradul,4.07,"Thanks to wchesak for this amazing extra!  now this is my kind of Amber!  Pours a nice copper with a very tight head on it. I can smell the hops as I start to pour! The head dissolves to leave some spotty lacing.  Aroma is sweet malt a bit of a boozy kick to it to finish with a very hop forward finish!  I am not quite sure what makes this beer an ""amber"" as opposed to an IPA...maybe the type of malt that is used? becuase the hop kick to it is just amazing! Light sweetness to it with strong hop finish on the palate!  By far the best amber I have ever had!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,malthegal,4.52,"This is one of my favorite beers. I have only had this beer from a bottle, but it seems like with each new pour, I love this beer more and more (too bad it's seasonal). The aroma is unreal, so floral, it's absolutely amazing - the many varieties of hops mingle nicely together to make a smell that instantly brings a smile to your face. It has a smooth mouthfeel with an exceptional ability to hit all of your taste buds in a very robust, yet soft, way! The appearance of this beer is also phenomenal, a very clear, crisp, light amber hue with an equally impressive head. Hand down, a great beer. Don't wait - if you see it, try it!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,generalnotsew,4.52,A: Ruby red copper coloring. Nice fat off white head and very sticky lacing.  S: What a rush to the olfactory glands! Sweet hoppiness. Piney resiney hops. Very close to an IPA.  T: Nice hop zing. Not the hoppiest beer but a nice very clean and balanced hoppy. I am getting a caramel apple touch in the finish with the grassy hops leading the way.  M: Very oily and well carbonated.  D: You can hammer on these all night long. Goes down as easy as a lager. And the abv isn't too crazy high.  Very glad to have finally tried this. I will be buying it again. Seems like a beer that is good for year round weather. Would very much like to see more of something like this. Good change from IPA's.,Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,DenverW1,5,"This is by far the best beer I have ever tasted. Its a Hop Head's dream. It's the Hop Backs older, bigger, better brother. The only downfall for this brew is that its SEASONAL!!

Flavor is caramel, bread, orange, pine, and grapefruit. Mouthfeel is medium, dry and bitter. Overall a good beer, well balanced. Also delicious on cask.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,JoePat,3.9,The beer pours a honey like amber color with a thick white head. It has a huge smell of citrusy grapfruit hops and a hint of the malt sweetness. The flavor is very bitter the main focus a piney hop flavor. It does have a good sweet malt backbone to handle all that bitterness though. The mouth feel is almost syrupy from the sweetness with a dry finish. With all the hops and all the sweetness it is not the most drinkable of IPA's but good none the less.,Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Beerandraiderfan,4.33,"This beer convinced me as to what a nugget hop can do. Decent appearance, nothing earth-shattering, your standard amber ale, with maybe more carbonation and a little more vibrancy. Very clear.  Aroma was unmistakenly hoppy with some of that amber woody smoothness. Taste came through as a happy balance of the high alpha acid resin nugget hop and the amber malt. Very nice. Gotta pair the nuggets up with substantial malt. Mouthfeel was great, I wanted more. Great interplay of everything.  Drank this at Miller Park, Brewers v. Cubs, so there's some cool lucky wild card points for ya on the drinkability.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,TJBurgess,3.75,"#14  Thanks to Stevefinny for this one...  Poured into Sam Adams perfect pint.  A: Big time foamy head. Very frothy and off-white in color, with a very light amber / almost transparent hue. 3.5  S: Wet hops, pine, light citrus, and just plain light in general. Nothing overpowering. 3.5  T: Hop overload. Any citrus was demolished on the first drop of hops hitting my tongue. I'm not a big fan of overly hoppy bears, but this is a decent balance overall. 4.0  M/D: Carbonation in present, but subdued. Alcohol presence is fairly non-existant. 4.0, 3.5  One bomber was plenty for me. I prefer a more citrus balanced hop-heavy beer, but I'm glad I got to try this.  Cheers!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,RevereBeer,4.19,"Poured this into a 22oz bomber into a tulip. This pours a clear, deep orange with a two finger off-white head. Moderate retention on the head with spotty lacing.  The nose is incredible. Hop character is very dominant, though the malt base is noticeable and fruity. The hops are citrusy with some piney and floral scents, the variety is a very strong point to this beer.  Primarily hop flavor, but balanced with the malt base. Bitter for sure, but very smooth and actually leaves me with a sweet aftertaste.  This is medium to full bodied with medium carbonation. A smooth drink, and the sweetness and bitterness are well balanced. Makes for a smooth and delicious brew with great drinkability.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,phiberoptik,4.1,"Tasty! This beer is delicious...  Pours a nice amber red and you can smell some piney hops right from the pour. This beer smells sweet with a touch of malt character.  The taste was great. Just a really clean, refreshing piney hop character. I like what someone else said about a certain caramel character. I definitely agree with this.  Felt a little heavier than most traditional IPAs I have tried. Has a bit of meat behind it. Nothing like a stout, but you can tell there is some body to this beer.  I could drink this for an evening. Not sure Id make it a day in the sun type of beer, but it definitely helped me enjoy putting up blinds last night.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,smithflipper,4.42,"Pale red/ golden clour with a thick syrupy head.  Smells of resiny/ piney hops. Very slight caramel malt flavour get's through. Just tons of fresh hops, yum!  Taste- you get small dollop of sweet caramel/ bready malt, which just brings the piney resinous hops to the fore even more.  Mouthfeel is just right.  Damn the alcohol content, i'll drink this all day!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,InspectorBob,4.2,"Poured into a pint glass. Had an orange/amber color with a one finger off white head,with nice lacing.

Nice.  T: Tasty. Nice and earthy/herbal flavor from the hops, with just a bit of grass in there as well. Balanced very well by a malty caramel flavor. Very well rounded.  M: Medium bodied, slightly syrupy, and a lot of carbonation. The carbonation just sits on your tongue and tickles it.  D: Probably wouldn't do more than a couple in a night. But very solid, and worth seeking out.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,WYVYRN527,4.67,"My first experience with this brew, thanks to DCDevilDancer. 12 oz. bottle, poured into a pint glass.  A: Brilliant amber in color with a two-finger thick off-white head. Head retention is good, as well as thick lacing on the glass walls.  S: Some caramel and toasty malt notes emerge behind all of the hops. Dominant aromas are citrus, pine, pineapple, and some orange peel.  T: Very balanced taste, possibly the most balanced beer of this style I have tasted. Malt gives flavors of toffee, toast, and butterscotch. Hops lend flavors of pineapple, spruce, and rose hips. The finish is crisp, but suprisingly long.  M: NN is medium to full-bodied. It has alot going on in the mouthfeel. Carbonation is fine, yet the malt and hops give the beer a viscosity that rivals many others of the style.  D: Drinkability? Hell yeah! This is what amber ales should taste like. It's one that stands out amongst it's peers. Easy to drink, almost sessionable. This beer is simply delicious!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

694,15881,jgasparine,4.42,"A- A moderately aggressive pour yielded a 1/2"" foamy offwhite head with minimal lacing. The body was a filtered medium amber... with some little bubbles working their way up the sides of the glass.  S- The aroma is massively rich- buckets of floral hops along with aromas of stewed and amber malts. Faint impressions of clean hay. Somewhat balanced on the nose, airing on the side of hop-dominant.  T- The mouth initially replicates the nose- a lot of floral hoppiness up front in balance with amber/stewed malt. Midway, the hops take over with a bitterness that lingers on the palate after the finish. It finishes semi-dry with a resiny bitterness to it. Big rich flavor throughout.  M- Medium body, with some abundant soft carbonation and a slight perceived creaminess. Slight astringency as well.  D- Very drinkable- nay- quaffable; with the alcohol very well hidden.

694,15881,taylorhamrick,4.05,"Acquired thanks to cpetrone84.  Pours a nice deep copper, moving to amber, good clarity, a little chill haze on this one, with a decent 1-2 cm head. The head kind of falls down leaving a ring around the ed and a little pillow in the middle. Moderate lacing, but not too sticky. The smell is slightly floral and pungent hops, almost musty in there. With some raw graininess. You also get some melon smells, like honeydew, but a little bitter and resinous, with just some notes of tangerine in the end. The taste is nice. Starts out with tangerine, lime, and a bit of bitterness. Then a bit of a grainy sweetness comes in, moving to a kind of melon taste that I think is somewhat common in Nugget Hops. There's also a little pine and a tiny bit of grass and leaves, but the fleshy, bitter fruit taste seems to win here. Finishes nice and dry with a little crisp bite of bitterness. I think the body is a little thinner than I'd like, definitely on the thin side of medium, and when I drink an imperial amber, I like that sticky, bready malt body to really almost battle with the hops, letting the hops win out, but really balancing them so their fruitiness wins. The carbonation is nice, not a lot of bite, but just lively enough to let you know it's there. Overall, a pretty nice amber ale, one of the better and more enjoyable ones, it stands out in the top 3-5 of the imperial reds I've had (though this isn't the most bountiful style), but I don't think it does enough to set itself apart. I would definitely go back, maybe drink a few in a night, and I would definitely be happy.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Nesued,4.28,"Appearance - Golden coloring, huge head that lasts for a good long time. Nice lacing forms as the head retracts. Very light carbonation.  Smell - Smells like a lively IPA/DIPA. Big fruit salad nose, some malt sweetness as well. Swirl it around and you'll get another big caress of flowerly, piney hop nose.  Taste - Ample hoppy opening, balanced with a nice sweet malty middle and finishes with a slight bite. When I first smelled this, I was fully expecting a hop bomb and questioned why this wouldn't be classified as an IPA? There is a refreshing balance here.  Mouthfeel - All beer here nothing added by overcarbonation. Big mouthfeel. Crisp finish is a refreshing added feature.  Drinkability - Really, really hard category to judge. I mean, this and Fat Tire in the same class? This was my first Troegs offering and what a nice offering it was. Would love to find these locally.

There's an underlying earthy bitterness here as well. A solid malt backbone makes it's presence known in the finish, accompanied by a lingering bitterness. Great balance.  M - Full-bodied with a clean finish. Carbonation does a good job of staying out of the way.  D - This is a great amber, and very sessionable. It definitely doesn't drink like an ""imperial"" beer.

This is very drinkable and delicious too. The malt remains as the brew goes down  M- medium bodied and carbonated  D- no question about it. This beers lives up to the hype.

A ring stays on top with quite good lacing.  S: Well, there's grapefruit in this for sure! Tons of lemon peel too and tangerine smell. Very fruity and juicy smell overall, inviting! Not much malts though, which is odd for an amber ale. Some sweetness, like maple water.  T: Like the name says, it's a hoppy beer. Grapefruit is VERY present as well as lemon zest and tangerine, just like the smell tells. Very juicy taste overall. Also, piny hops are present. A light malt sweetness is present, which compliments well the beer.  M: Ohh, this is a good feeling beer. Medium body, very creamy but with enough carbonation to keep it very lively.  D: Very fruity/juicy/refreshing brew this is. Easy to drink beer for sure!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,mherring,4.16,"A - Poured out as a very nice red or amber color. Really appetizing. Not much head at all, which was a little disappointing, but that could have just been my pour.  S - Incredible. I'm a fan of hoppy beers, so this is right up my alley. Lots of great, citrus-y hops. Kind of makes you forget that this an amber/red ale. Certainly doesn't smell like one.  T - Very nice balance between the hops and the malts. Based on the smell, I was expecting a pretty powerful hops flavor, but it's actually pretty nicely balanced. Feels like I got a bit of a hop bite, finished with some of the maltiness you'd expect from an amber/red.  M - Pretty solid. Nothing to write home about when compared to the taste and smell, but definitely not a negative here.  D - I like this beer a lot. The only thing that kind of troubles me is that it doesn't taste like an amber to me. Tastes and smells to hoppy.

694,15881,SpdKilz,4.42,"New Beer Friday! A big thanks to neorunner for this great beer. Cheers!  Bottled February 17, 2010.  Appearance - Pours into my Bell's Tulip with a relatively clear dark amber color with over a finger of whit head that dissipates at a moderate speed leaving some nice looking lacing.  Smell - A wonderful passion fruit citrus aroma wafts toward me as soon as I pour this into the glass. Mango, ripe grapefruit, and a hint of orange. The hops are actually on the backend of the aroma which to be honest I am somewhat happy about because this beer is beginning to smell similar to the Oracle which I thoroughly enjoyed.  Taste - As heavily citrus smelling as it was, there is still an immediate hop bite with the first sip I take. However, it is extremely balanced as the somewhat bitter hop/piney taste melds into the wonderful passion citrus flavors (as previously mentioned) along with a nice malty, caramel backbone. The finish actually has a nice spicy hop bite. Damn, I'm glad I have five more of these!  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied, creamy, adequate/well balanced carbonation, and finishes with just a hint of dryness.  Drinkability - Extremely. This is a damn good and pretty sessionable for the abv and style. I really haven't had many American Amber/Red Ale's but this seems more like a D/IPA. I'm glad I was able to try this finally and once I'm back in the Midwest will be looking for this (since it will be most likely more readily available there than out here in CA).",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

The amber ale malt comes out only to blend with a sweet and grapefruit like hop flavor. Fantastic flavor, I see why the hype exists!

Pours out a slightly hazy caramel orange with a bright head of a finger's depth. This doesn't stick around for long, but leaves some decent lacing that's thicker and shiny up top, thinner and sticky down below.  Good nose on this. Sweet fresh citrus- oranges, tangerines, a bit of pineapple- with a lightly sweet maltiness in the background.  The malt is more substantial than I anticipated up front, but it's only a brief flash of bready sweetnesss before the hops take over. The sweeter citrus I smelled is definitely present, but there's also a nice dose of tart grapefruit and a piney bitterness that is fairly strong for a moment, but then disappears abruptly along with the other hop flavors for a surprisingly dry finish. A bit oily before the finish- nice feel in general. Just enough carbonation to keep things flowing. A little bready sweetness returns in the aftertaste.  Overall impression: Very enjoyable beer. I'd put away a ton of this stuff if it was available locally.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

I can appreciate good beer no matter if it is my thing or not. And I enjoyed the Nugget Nectar far more than I would have guessed. So the B I will give it, is about as high as I can go.  Appearance: Light Amber with a hint of orange. 3 Finger of foam held up very nicely.  Smell: Ale and hops. A lot of aroma hops that were very pleasant in relation to the beer. The Malt and grain were very faint.  Taste: Oh so very interesting. I got 3 distinct things going on in the taste. First a wif of hops and a nice light ale, followed quickly by grassy lemony hops, and then strong bitterness (but not unpleasantly so). Each sip took me through these steps. So this was more of a thrill ride for my senses than a beer I would drink regularly.  Mouthfeel: Nice and pleasant. Appropriate to style.  Drinkability: I think I would drink this again, maybe one a year just for the experience.

A touch of grapefruit here as well. No real malt in the nose.  T: All the hops smells come through in the taste. Also some piney hop flavor. I can't really distinguish why this is an imperial amber and not an imperial ipa. Very nice taste though.  M: Fairly creamy. Hops linger on the tastebuds, but not overwhelmingly so.

Appearance: A strikingly clear body that is more copper than amber. A huge 3 finger lopsided head sits atop and lots of lacing drapes glass as i drink. Nice.  Smell: Fresh hops, citrus (orange & tangerine). Raw and juicy. Though not intense, it is pleasing nonetheless.  Taste: Hit first by the malt aspect nut backed up by a modest hops presence. Mot as juicy as aroma. Hops don't necessarily kick but do provide some definite tangerine & grapefruit flavor. Has that twang that all amber ales have in the aftertaste; reminiscent of nuts.  Mouthfeel: Quite smooth but not full rounded as far as the feel goes. After the sip, it kind of exits fast instead of sticking around.  Drinkability: Drinks very well. Zero impediment in terms of alcohol heat. I'd have more probably.  Overall: I think it's important to note that this beer is not a hop-fest as some would like but it is a good amber ale with a decent kick.

The taste pretty much follows suit with aroma, hops and lots of 'em. The piney variety were dominant, still some small room for a bit of malty sweet. I had been nursing this sixer for a few weeks to see if it lost any of the hops like Hopslam did, but it's still going strong.  The mouth feel is oily, medium bodied and respectably carbonated.  Drinkability is good. I could be a two fisted drinker with a couple of Nugget Nectars.  Not my favorite amber (YuleSmith-Winter), but a very good one in a close race for second.

It imitates the look of your average amber ale, but the smell is a different story. This has a great citrus and pine note to it. I am instantly reminded of simcoe hops, which seems to be the dominant scent in this brew. Agitation of the beer summons more great whiffs. This is truly a good smelling ale.

The taste is fruity, hoppy in a good way, but not bitter, caramel malts for balance. Mouthfeel is firm but not sticky. Very drinkable, though a bit boozy, IBUs are well hidden. I expected a more over the top hoppy beer given the hop bill, I thought this was exceptionally balanced and quite tasty.

It has a soapy white head with a few foamier patches. There is one meager stream of bubbles rising in my glass. I can smell piney, musty hops as well as a hint of sweet citrus. The flavor can be described as hoptastic. It's piney up front and bitter in the finish. The bitter aftertaste doesn't linger too long. Nugget Nectar has enough of a malt backbone to justify the imperial amber classification on the label. It has a heavy body and medium carbonation.

Some pine and citrus with malt. Very nice. Pleasant and quite fresh smelling.  T - Awesome. How an imperial red should be. Doesn't resemble an imperial IPA like a lot of imperial reds end up doing. Follows the nose pretty close but not as overpoweringly flavorful as the aromas suggest (thank god). Everything is in balance. A lot of hops but not too much. bold, balanced brown sugar malts. So much freshness. Truly pristine tasting. This is the only other beer I've ever had that is on the level of Pliny the Elder in pure pristineness. It is so utterly clean tasting. This is phenomenal.

I would love to have 3 or 4 of these in a session. Maybe my favorite beer of all time. And despite all the hoppiness, they don't kill your tastebuds.

Pours a pretty transparent Amber. Lacing is minimal.  S: Lots of dirty, resiny, earthy hops in the nose. Pretty pungent actually. Some faint maltiness in the background.  T: The earthy, herbal hops are very forward, but are not that blatantly out of control. A solid malt backbone of caramel and toasted malts balance with the hops nicely.

Biscuity malts and woody, citrusy hops. I actually noticed the smooth, creamy mouthfeel first. It's pretty carbonated, and usually, I don't like that, but here it is a plus, somehow contributing to the creaminess. The malt base seems almost lager-like: very smooth and oh, so drinkable.

Poured a one finger head that crested the top of the glass. The foam has since died down leaving about 1/8th inch on the perimeter, though it's thinner in the center. Thin retention & decent lacing.  The aroma is pretty good, I must admit. It offers pungent hop aromas that encompass most of the nose. There are a few floral notes & pine undertones, but it has a nice citric presence as well. Notes of ripe grapefruit, tangerine & a touch of lemon. There is a faint air of toasted malts at first, though they become more apparent as I the beer warms with notes of caramel.  The taste is similar to the nose, but it manages to a bit less impressive. Sure, it's hoppy & tastes good. It's just that the pungency seems to take on an essence of soapiness. It isn't too bad though & becomes less pronounced quickly. Grapefruit & lemon zest are most prominent with floral wisps throughout. Again, the malt seems well-seated & very much out of the way - swaths of toasted bread & caramel.  Mouthfeel seems close to spot on. It's essentially medium bodied, maybe leaning slightly toward the heavier side. This may be accentuated by the density & near-chewiness of the beer. Indeed, it's resiny & almost sticky without much grittiness. Appropriate carbonation - just enough prickliness. Lingering on the finish is a moderate bitterness & a few stray notes of toasty malt.  Nugget Nectar is quite good. It's certainly tasty without too much in the way of damaging faults. Still, for some reason I don't find myself clamoring for much more. I may have another or two while it's still in season, but I likely won't put it in any sort of rotation. But I digress...Without a doubt it's worth a shot.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,kbeals,4.51,"First off, big thanks to gn0sis for this brew, totally unexpected!  A- Perfectly clear dark amber color with a finger and a half of soapy white head. Excellent head retention and lacing result in a beautiful looking brew. This is what an amber should look like IMO.  S- Tons of fresh hops, but sadly it has sort of an artificial sugary, gummy-bear type smell in the back. Sort of detracts, but still really good.  T- Plenty of fresh, citrusy hops along with a balance of sweet caramel malts. Gummy bear smell doesn't come through in the flavor luckily, most likely covered up by the intense hoppiness. Finishes bitter, but not dry. Delicious.  M- Light-medium body with good doses of carbonation. Slightly prickly mouthfeel, overall very smooth.  D- Ummmm, yeah! I wish I had year round access tot his beer, this would definitely be in my summer rotation.  Thanks again for this one Eric! You're world-class!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,devilben02,4.18,"Pours a glorious clear orange-amber color with a creamy head. The aroma is fresh and IPA-like with notes of orange and pine. The hops are likewise dominant in the flavor, but there is also an underlying caramel malt sweetness for more balance than a straight-up hop bomb. It doesn't come all the way to balance that I would hope for from an ""imperial amber"", though, with a lingering bitterness and a bit of a grainy finish that is somewhat off-putting.  The overall impression is one of a kicked-up amber trying to pass for a DIPA, but it come off like an American stripper-turned-actress playing the role of a French stripper in a movie. The accent isn't quite right, so although you get that the character is French, you know the actress is not. At the same time, because she is focusing so much on trying to be French, the rest of her performance suffers. In the end, though, you still enjoy the performance because you're watching a movie about a French stripper, even if she isn't completely believable as a French woman or as a stripper.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Some lacing as the glass empties.  S - Mostly piney and slightly citrusy hops with a touch of caramel.  T - Leads malty with a touch of honey then turns to citrusy hops. A nice balance of the two. The bitterness lingers lightly but nicely. It drinks much lighter than its 7.5% alcohol.  M - A bit on the thin side with a moderate yet noticeable carbonation.  D - A very smooth and drinkable beer.

694,15881,afausser,4.17,"Appearance: Pours a crystalline, dark, peach and orange tinted amber with about half a finger of snow white fine bubbly head, and a ton of large carbonation bubbles that quickly move to the top. The streams of bubbles are highly inconsistent--around the edge of the glass, they are fine and tiny, in fast moving streams, but near the middle of the brew they move at different speeds to the point where they look more like they are individual bubbles floating to the top of the glass than small parts of an entire stream. The head doesn't last very long, and is about cut in half within the first couple minutes after the pour. What is left, however, is long lasting--and consists of a fairly consistent layer of foam across the top of the glass and about a wuarter of a finger of head still left. Minimal lacing is comprised of the same fine bubbles as the head and is sticky, web-like, and long lasting.  Smell: Full of sweet honey and floral hops, as well as sweet, bread and caramel malt notes. Plenty of ...nectar-like...daylily notes that are a highlight of this brew. Slight and very light orange citrus notes. When all of the scents blend together, there's some funky note that's a little bit hard to identify.  Taste: Crisp and spicy, with black pepper, and heavy pine hops. A bit of grapefruit in the finish. The aftertaste is excessively strong, slightly alcoholic and flavored with pine.  Mouthfeel is good--highly consistent, light to medium bodied, and not overcarbonated, though does seem a bit foamy at times. A slight amount of alcohol heat is present in the aftertaste and comes across as slight minty spice, and is a bit chewy, oddly enough.  Drinkability: easily drinkable and refreshing, though seems to come across as a bit hot for a 7.5%. A nice session beer, but doesn't blow me away the way brews like hopslam do.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

T: Fresh citrusy fruit and loads of bitter hops. Some caramelly malts help keep the flavor from becoming to bitter and keeps the nice sweet fruit tast strong.  M: Medium bodied with nice carbonation and considerable bitterness. No alcoholic heat comes through.  D: If you like hops it will be incredibly drinkable; for the average drinker the bitterness hurts it a little.  Overall its a ""should try"" for fans of hoppy beers.

Dominated with malts and caramel with some IPA like citrus fruits coming through and a solid hop backbone. Taste is solid but nothing like the nose. Flavor profile is caramel malts up front with a very balanced hop finish that leaves the palate slightly bitter. Only complaint with the taste is that it is somewhat watery. Mouthfeel is fairly thin.

I had this one just a few days after it arrived in Cleveland, but was actually fortunate enough to have a 2 day old bottle this summer when a kind BA sent me one from the special batch. I find this beer doesn't fade as much as some of the other hop Bombs but should be experienced as fresh as possible!  Looks great in a 22oz glass - amber bubbly body with a white head that leaves a bit of lace.  Smell is really nice. Hops provide a nice citrus and pine base, and the malt is there too. Caramel with orange, lightly toasted bread with pine needles.  Taste is really quite good. Not an imperial knock-out, but a nice mix of caramelized malt and citrus hops. The Nugget and Warrior have a nice mix of tropical and earthy, and a nice bitter finish that does not decimate. This is much more balanced between hop and malt flavors than West Coast DIPAs.  Mouthfeel is average density and decent carb, slightly creamy on tap, good but nothing groundbreaking.  Drinkability is excellent.

The flavor had that solid malt base to build upon and the hops do just that very well.  The body was solid, full and sticky in the good way.

Good lacing.  S: Bursting with juicy hops- much is going on here. Sweet evergreen is the crown on the head of juicy fruits such as pineapple, pear, slight grape, blood orange, and some malt hiding on the side.  T: Follows the nose in a deft swoop of flavors. First the evergreen and the rest of the hops, which seem as if they are going to demolish the mouth with bitterness, but then don't. Oh these hops are beautiful! The drinkability is fairly good because a good dose of malts show up in the flavor and work at balancing out the hop presence. Nice acidity, pleasing, fresh, and clean.  Mf&D: Mouthfeel is rich but not heavy, with a nice twang but some smoothness to boot. Refreshing. Drinkability is fairly good, but not quite at the level of ""nectar"".  Overall: A fun take on the style, highly recommended. I am pretty much as far from a hophead as you can get, but I can certainly appreciate a hoppy beer when it is brewed with flair and attention. My only complaint is that this beer does not fit its style very well, with 97 IBUs, can this truly be called an amber/red ale?

A- Loving the amber/red tonality going on here, very pretty body, but not much head to speak of. Only thing I can say is that the keg is in the front bar and I generally sit in the back, so who knows what it looks like between the pour and the walk back. But the color is enough for me to rank this highly.  S- I rate this an average with every intention of bumping it up later. At the bar, I can't get any where near as much of a handle on its aroma as I do when I'm drinking at home. But I can still tell you there's tons of citrusy hops in this monster.  T- Awesome. Super dry, citrusy, maybe a hint or two of floral, just about no malts come through, but you can tell they are there keeping the hops from bittering the hell out of this. There's a lot of the same things going on here as in the PtY I had earlier today, but it's missing a bit of the mystery I found in Pliny. Still- awesome.  M- It's all there. You know its in your mouth when you're drinking it, that's for sure, mostly driven by the hop sharpness, but also by a minor creamy carbonation.  D- Keep 'em coming.  So after a day where a successful PtY quest was completed, I definitely put this in the same echelon, and really only a slight notch lower.

Smells more like an American IPA than the Imperial Amber listed on the label. Heavy on bitter and piney hops backed by a sweet but not distracting malt profile.  Smells much better than it tastes in my opinion. Hops are not as pronounced as I'd like and the malt profile dominates more than I'd expect considering the ABV is at 7.5%. It's bitter enough, but is lacking in complexity. Kind of a disappointment after the pleasant aroma.  I'll give this beer fairly high marks because it's a hoppy Amber, not an IPA, and as such it's pretty decent beer.

Taste is alittle muted on the malt end, but the hops are citrusy, with hints of grapefruit and the lightest touch of pine needles. Bitterness is there, but not in large amounts. It's well balanced, and the alcohol doesn't come into play too much, but overall it's slightly muted. I understand that this bottle is a few months old and not at it's optimum flavor capacity, but it still tastes very good and can see how this could be a great beer fresh.

On-tap bumped my score up to a perfect 5 as the head retention is excellent as is the thick lace that it leaves behind. A beer cannot look better than this!  S: A fresh piney and hoppy scent with malty tones in the background and deep floral bouquet. The traditional American Amber aroma melds so well with the excessive hopping. Great smell.  T: Intense but very balanced hop flavor combined with a rich malt which works in perfect harmony to add a wonderfully complex flavor that is never overwhelming. A floral element rounds out a truly delicious beer.  M: Nice mouthfeel that is on the medium-bodied with a slick characteristic and appropriate carbonation. I will say that this may have just a slight edge on the cask version and out of the bottle.  D: Exceptionally drinkable as this beer with a complex hop assault that maintains and delicate balance of being intense yet never harsh. I could dink this beer all day.

694,15881,DrDoitchbig,4.35,"A big thanks to wunderbeer for this one!  Appearance: Poured a fairly dark shade of amber with orange highlights. The slightly off-white head started at around two fingers and faded fairly quickly into an iceberg in the center of my glass. I was expected more lacing from this one, but all I was left with was a few haphazard splotches.  Smell: The hops in this dominant, but not as much as I expected. Getting a lot of apricot and grapefruit, the hops in this are extremely fruit centric. The malt backbone beneath the hops brings up tones of caramel and biscuit. There's also a splash of floral hops in here. It's a great aroma, but I wouldn't have enjoyed it even more if it was kicked up a couple notches.  Taste: This beer has an awesome dynamic bitterness to it. The different hop flavors are at war with each other, in a good way. At the beginning the fruity apricot and grapefruit flavors of the smell were completely in charge. As I continued to drink the floral hops from the smell faded in and out growing stronger until they became the dominant. Even further along the fruity hops came back with a vengeance. It's a very cool experience, every couple of sips were slightly different than the last. The constant here is the balancing caramel malt and perhaps a dose of toasted grain. This sure isn't your daddy's amber ale, it's much better.  Mouthfeel: Solid medium body, spot on for the style. The creaminess here is almost unparalleled by anything I've had out of a bottle short of an Imperial Stout. I felt the carbonation was touch on the low side, but didn't detract to much. Just enough to prevent a perfect 5.  Drinkability: I've had a couple of these highly hopped reds and I've come to the conclusion that I'm a big proponent of the fusion of styles. There is something about the combination of IPA like hop levels with the malt backbone of a red that keeps me coming back for more.  I think if Nugget Nectar was distributed in Michigan and wasn't a seasonal it would own some permanent real estate in my fridge. It's a damn shame I only have one more bottle.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,xanok,3.75,"Expressed my disappointment with this beer in a thread last week. Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass.  A-One thing I LOVED about this beer was the color. Clear amber. Decent bone-white head with little lacing.  S-Citrus smells and floral hops. Has some sweetness in the aroma.  T-My disappointment came here. Follows the nose mostly, but on a weaker level. Was expecting more of a citrus taste from the earlier smell, but it never really came through. The malt is solid, and the hops are great, just expected a bit more in the flavor.  M-Light to medium bodied. Nice carb. Not much of an aftertaste. Smooth going down  D-At 7.5% abv, you won't hurt yourself much drinking a few of these.  I like this beer. I guess I just don't see it being borderline world-class. I may get it again in the future. At $12.50 per sixer, it's a great price for a pretty good beer.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,alcstradamus,3.93,"Crystal clear glowing amber color with a red hue. A finger of head that leaves nice lacing.  Smell is big citrus and floral hoppiness, with a sweet and biscuity malt backbone to add some balance.  The flavor is hop forward, yet by no means hop dominated. There is a strong biscuit backbone that lets you know that this is not an IPA, despite what the awesome bottle design might make you think. Very clean tasting.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied but it feels fuller because of a large amount of soft carbonation. Drinkability is pretty good if you are wanting a flavorful beer to sip two or three of, but I'm not sure this holds up to my ""does one make me happy?"" standard of enjoyment.  Great beer overall.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,cdbooth219,4.67,"12 oz bottle poured into pilsner glass  A: Pours a beautiful amber-red with about one and a half fingers of tan head that dissipates slowly leaving good lacing. A lot of carbonation bubbles release after pouring as well  S: Lots of floral, grassy, herbal and citrus notes from the hops are detected on the nose, along with a malty sweetness lurking behind the hoppiness  T: A lot of hoppiness. The same floral, grassy, herbal, and citrus notes that I detected in the smell. Its not overly hoppy though. The malts are there as well, and they add a kind of sweet backbone to all of the hoppiness. Finishes dry and hoppy again. This is a very tasty and well rounded beer.  M: This has a medium body with a decent amount of carbonation. It doesn't leave an oily feeling like many hoppy beers do either.  D: Very well rounded and delicious. Since it is not overbearing, I could drink this all night quite enjoyably.  Overall, this is an amazing beer. It is amazingly flavorful and well rounded.

694,15881,Brenden,4.57,"This brew is a beautiful amber-red that combines clarity and depth very nicely. The color is what I expect. A tan head pours out at about one finger and retains well, leaving moderately thick lacing in equally moderate volume. I've recently read a forum post questioning the strength and depth of this beer. I inhale deeply and instantly my fears are sated. This one is pure, fresh, raw, and deep, with hops all over the place creating a beautiful mix of citrus, resin, floral and earthy. Combined with a very nice balance from malts adding a slightly sweetening effect, I'm trying hard to imagine how this aroma could be better. This is a tasty brew. The fresh citrus and pine come out straightaway, just as fresh, bright and clean but perhaps not as strong as I get from the nose. The balancing malts add a sweetness, subduing the high IBU and making this just a really tasty beer rather than the hop bomb some expect. Lots of grassy earthiness comes out in the finish. Delicious. The body is medium but pretty filling, with smoothness beating out crispness. It seems almost to thicken in the swallow, if that makes sense. A little dryness pulls through, though it keeps smooth. As such, the finish is semi-dry and lingers pretty well. Overall, this one is really drinkable given a fairly high ABV. It's a delicious beer well worth the hype and which, to be quite honest, I should have gotten more of.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Bright and translucent. 1 finger head that hangs around for awhile and leaves a little lacing.  Aroma is that of hops and citrus.  Tastes like it smells for the most part. I'm getting an earthy/grassy taste mixed in with some sort of citrus. Can't put a finger on a particualr fruit, but most certainly in the citrus family. Grapefruit maybe?  The beer wasn't nearly as bitter as I had expected with the name and big hop on the label.

A &#8211; It pours a very nice hue of amber-red, with good inch of head, less impressive lace.  S &#8211; The aroma is quite hoppy; piney and herbal, with a tad of caramel and a bit of alcohol. The aroma is nicely balanced, yet strongly hop-centric.  T &#8211; The taste is very well balanced. The red element is nicely expressed in this one, countered with a mostly bitter and herbal hop. A bit of pleasant mineral flavor is present as well. Despite the redness, no peat or butterscotch flavors are there, and that is a very good thing in my book.

Floral, Earthy, spicy, and piny.  Flavor begins with intense yet well balanced hops and finishes sweet and nutty with the malt. Hints of citrus and cinnamon. This is truly a top notch beer.

694,15881,BeerPhan86,4.45,"I've been waiting a long time to try this beer, and the legendary Hopslam. Paid 12.99/six pack for the Nugget Nectar but it was worth it to try my first imperial amber, and one I've heard so much about!  A - Very clear dark golden color with a two finger tan head. Varying sizes of carbonation bubbles, interesting.  S - Loads of floral and citrus hops, but not as heavy on the earthy and grassy notes you tend to get with an imperial pale ale, for instance. Lots of sweet, bready malt follows.  T - Very hoppy but just slightly sweet. Not much bitterness or alcohol taste at all. Not as hoppy as I was expecting but it is so damn well balanced I can't complain! Has a smoky aspect to it that I have found in many craft brewed ambers.  M - Very smooth and the carbonation is just right. Doesn't leave much taste in your mouth which keeps me coming back for another sip.  D - Dangerously drinkable. It just goes down so easy.  Overall I was very impressed. It is a unique take on this whole era of imperial ales and one I'd definitely like to see more of. Very hoppy and flavorful without being so bitter to make your average craft brew drinker wince. I'd love to get some more if it was cheaper! If you are a fellow lover of hoppy beers and see this, get it and treat yourself!

694,15881,ChainGangGuy,4.32,"Appearance: Pours out a clear, orange-amber body with a tall head of off-white, long lasting foam. Thin delicate sheets of lace on the descent.  Smell: Sure, there're some mild notes of bready malt to be sniffed up, but, for the most part, it's a nose of fresh, moist, juicy hops. All at once, it's richly floral, grassy, citrusy, and spicy. Nice.  Taste: Lightly bready, toasty, but adequately sweet malts jump-start the taste. Next, in charges a vibrant, multi-faceted American hop character: fresh florals, light pine saplings, ground spices, refrigerator-chilled ruby red grapefruit, and fresh, juicy tangelos. Moderate bitterness, though while it's jam-packed with hops, it thankfully never becomes harsh or unpleasantly astringent. Soon, a staunch, firm grassiness enters the taste. Finishes predominately bitter, though a bit more malty sweetness is encountered, with a lingering grassiness and ever-so-slight alcohol warmth.  Mouthfeel: Just a hair above medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. Smooth, soothing mouthfeel.  Drinkability: Top notch expression of hops. For me, it's just the right amount and right blend of hops to make for a very enjoyable brew, with enough malts and not a drop more alcohol than is needed.

Fluffy white head quickly retreates to a nice 1/4"" lid.  Smells like the label suggests. as is someone has squeezed out a giant hop nugget into the head of the beer. Very Earthy, with a hint of citrus.  The hops manage a nice Earthy flavor, while still coming across as clean and fruity. Grapefruit sour balances it very nicely.  Feel is decent. Not too much carbonation, which works for me.  Very drinkable. Good hoppy aroma and taste, but no overpowering bitter pucker. Great name as well.

694,15881,mechamifune,4.06,"Another beer i've been looking forward to for a while.  Pours a very pleasant deep amber/copper color. I don't usually put much stock in the appearance of beer unless something is obviously wrong, but this one really stood out to me. Light head with minimal lacing. Looks just wonderful in the tulip glass.  Smell is hop forward but with a sense of sweetness behind it. I've read others saying they get a lot of citrus here, but i'm getting only a small amount. Still pleasant.  Taste is hoppy on the front end, but not overly so (i wouldn't mistake this for a DIPA). It finishes very smooth/sweet, which, i suppose is why the 97ibus are not that overwhelming. The longer you drink it the more the sweet/malty elements come through, never really with any indication of alcohol.  Mouthfeel is pleasant, smooth. No harshness to it like i've started to grown accustomed to in some of the bigger beers. This in turn makes the drinkability relatively high, yet for all the smoothness and well blended elements I don't find this as ""easy"" to drink as I was hoping. I feel the same way about brown shugga (though granted that's a higher abv and also not as well put together), so perhaps it has something to do with the sweetness.  In total this is a nice change of pace from some of the big beers i've been drinking of late. Due to the hop levels in this one, i see now why so many are so wanting to compare it to a DIPA, but it really is a different experience. A very interesting and, for me, different beer. At $10 a sixer, it's also nice to be able to get something from the top 100 that's affordable (though, of course, I can't get any more in NC, so perhaps that's a mute point).",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Up front, the hops are very prominent giving a very memorable first impression. Notes of apricot, pine, and honey flavours. Very potent as well. The warmth from the alcohol comes in at the end.

Average retention and moderate lacing. Nice-looking beer, and definitely within the color range of an IPA.  S: Lovely, balanced aroma of pine and citrus hops (emphasis on orange, with some grapefruit as well) along with a pleasantly restrained note of sweet caramel malt. Delectable, if not quite as explosive as some other hop-bombs.  T: Like the nose, the flavors deliver not a pyrotechnic display of hop intensity, but rather an elegantly woven tapestry of impeccable balance. Pine and citrus hops play back and forth throughout, with just enough sweet malt backbone to set off the smooth bitterness and hint of cinnamon of the finish. This beer doesn't deliver anything I've haven't experienced before, but it definitely provides a profoundly enjoyable drinking experience. Top notch.  M: The lightly sticky body is mouthcoating at first, but soon releases a moderate, lively dose of effervescence that helps keep things relatively crisp. Quite nice, if a bit on the lighter side.  D: I have difficulty imagining a more drinkable beer with this kind of strength and hoppiness. There's no trace of alcohol, and the complexly bitter finish keeps me thirsty for more. Impeccable.  Notes: I was fortunate enough to get three of these in a recent trade (thanks again, BeerMan777), and this was my second (I drank my first back to back with a Hopslam). I just can't get over how utterly smooth and drinkable this amazing brew is. Every single moment drinking it is a pleasure.

Pine notes come out as it warms and smell oh so heavenly. T - Citrus/grapefruit hop flavors blast up front and then are slowly taken over by sweet chewy malts in the finish. There is something really satisfying about the order of these flavors. Citrus hops linger on the palate long after sipping. Pine comes out as it warms.

SAE/ECE amber body glows just like the side of a car headlight enshrouded in rain. A hefty sort-of-beige crown recedes to a sloppy tremulous heterogenous smattering of bubbles and then persists quite well. Lacing leaves looping outlines of a series of rolling hills, with no real legs.  Muscular hop presence, spicy and bitter from the namesake variety, along with a cavalcade of pine, earth, and especially citrus from the other strains riding on its back. A touch of caramel and pale malt flavors balance out the bitterness, but this is primarily a showcase for the hops. Dry, twiggy, mildly resinous finish with a final wave of unripe pear, orange zest, and evergreen. Slightly toasty aftertaste as the malt struggles to break through. Over time I notice a peppery quality as well.  Just about medium bodied, with a faint oiliness. Moderate carbonation.  A good amber ale for hop-heads, which highlights flavor over bitterness.

Just want to start this off by saying that fresh from the brewery's pipes this beer is 2000 times better than the bottles I've gotten in the mail, must be a fragile beer. Now I understand the hype because this lived up.  I love the complex, toasty malt body, which is very crisp and light bodied. There are some noticeable carmel malt and Munich malt undertones, and some other malts i couldn't identify. Pilsner is the base malt, which makes it that much more drinkable.  Of course this beer is all about the hops, though. Fresh and intense aroma, and gentle bitterness. Lots of tropical fruit notes, and soem grape-like Cascade notes. Probably Amarillos and Columbus in there. Wonderful; not too much and not palate-killing, yet more than enough to satisfy any hop lovers thirst. Much restraint making this recipe, bravo.  Cheers!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

694,15881,GratefulBeerGuy,4.54,"12 oz. bottle **updated review from a 12 oz. Can (freshest by 5/16/19/ opened on 1/31/19) all updated info is noted**.  Totally clear, dark shade of amber, slow bubbles, a bit relaxed. A clumpy, high rising off-white head with superior retention and lots of lace.  A big juicy-hoppy aroma, pineapple, dark berries, red fruits, earthy pine sap, honey scented maltiness with rock candy and soft, white pepper. **The fruity hops and caramel style malt scent is seriously amazing, lush and ripe hops just tear up tbe nose! Wowza.  The flavor is really all about the hop complexity, it's got citric and sweet fruits, very juicy feel, a bit relaxed and slick on the medium side. The hop flavor has decent copmlexity with fruits all over and then changing to a more earthy pine flavor. the malt provides balance with basically just sweetness in the form of honey and candy flavor's. The heat is very mellow, in fact, i'm not sure it's actually 7.5%. Tricky. ** A simply righteous hop charecter, with deep earthy pine and ripe tropical fruits tgat just explode on your taste buds. I'm jot usually a fan of darker/amber style malts with a huge hoppy focused beer, but damn! This is something unique. Bold-ass malt complexity that keeps its cool andvallows the hops to really pop.  A light and airy mouthfeel, medium bodied once the malty texture kicks in with attributes of juicy and somehow dry as well. Easily approachable and highly enjoyable feel.  This one is much more approachable than i thought, the complexity and balance could be improved and it feels almost like a session brew. $4.50 is a bit steep for a single 12 oz. bottle.** The complexity is sneakily deep, I dont feel like I ""got"" it's simple, yet hidden depth. The layers of abundant hops and lush malt really dance and swirl around eachother effortlessly.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

S- Medium Hop aroma of sweet Grapefruit. Nice malt sweetness coming through.  T- Good amount of bitterness up front. Tasty caramel malt through the entire experience. The problem with caramel malts is that they muddle up hop flavors, but there is still a decent hop flavor pas the bitterness of this beer.  M- The body is a bit thin, and carbonation could be a bit higher.  O- This is a good Amber ale, which is hard to see the imperial aspect of this beer. The malt should be thicker and more hop flavor would be nice. Will drink again.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,jzeilinger,4.1,"Pours a nice medium orange color with very little head, carbonation is very mild.  The aroma is dominated with tangy hop oil. Lots of citrus, pineapple, tangerine, pine, with sweet malt. The smell is really, really nice.  Taste is strong orange/tangerine citrus presence up front with a little bit of pineapple, lemon, sweet malt, and mildy spicy. There's a sweet sugary zing immediately in the beginning that disappears as quickly as it appears - here and gone. Along with the citrus is a very lightly toasted malt to keep things in check, just barely there until midway before it starts to surface. The pine hop bitterness is barely detectable in the initial sip also. 3/4's of the way through, the hops come along right after the malt to knock the sweetness down before it finishes with a lingering pine/citrus/lemon character that coats the mouth with a metallic-like finish.  Is a medium body beer, is fairly smooth, and drinkability runs high.  I haven't been a big Troegs fan in the past but Nugget Nectar has peaked my interest to give this brewery another try, especially after I liked the Mad Elf also. I know alot of BA members rave about this beer but I don't think it has that mystical mojo that everyone raves about. It's good, but not outta the ballpark good.  ADDENDUM:  Had Nugget Nectar on tap tonight and WHAT a difference compared to the bottle. All the hype this beer is getting on BA is appropriate, I was very impressed. I re-evaluated my number scores on this and take back the last couple of sentences in my review above. This is a very noteworthy beer, it reminds me of a few favorites of mine from Lagunitas. Well brewed, Troegs.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,WorldWideStout,4.22,"A: Pours an attractive amber on the reddish side with a bone-white head that doesn't hang around long, but leaves good lacing.  S: As soon as I made my first attempt at opening the bottle using my crappy keychain opener, I started to smell the hops. Lots of tropical fruit, definitely mango, with some sweet grass in there as well.  T: Not as hoppy as the smell. I get grassy, slightly bitter notes at the very start. Then the fruitier hops and a bit of malt sweetness come in at the middle and hang around until they are drowned out by a gentle, but definitely present hop bitterness that comes in and grows through the finish. The aftertaste is the receding of the bitterness for at least five seconds.  M: Smooth, appropriate carbonation.  D: At only 7.5% and with good balance, downing a sixer of this wouldn't be a problem.  I am not a hophead. This was more enjoyable for me than most IPAs, but was still a little too bitter for me at the end. I would've liked the hops with the fruitier scents to be more present in the taste.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,illidurit,3.95,"Bottle from the free table at Woodshop 5.0. Pours amber with a nice tan head. Aroma is big on pine and spruce, with lesser lychee and tangerine notes. Toasted caramel basis but not too sweet. Flavors are again very herbal and leafy with a supporting cast of pineapple and grapefruit. Walks a fine line really; many big ambers just taste like crystal malt and C hops but Nugget Nectar has a more interesting hop profile while the malt profile stays restrained and moderately dry. Decent bitterness, could use more of it. Also could use a bit more body.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Gambrinus1184,4.43,"Poured from a 12-ounce bottle into a Sunset Grill & Tap pint glass.  A: Poured a bright, fiery copper color with stupendous clarity, a frothy two-finger head of white foam which left tons of clingy lace. Carbonation is steady streaming throughout, looks great.  S: Smell is a full hop bouquet; slightly spicy, herbal and grassy citrus notes all combine in one earthy whiff. Tomahawk hops sure are nice.  T: Very clean, sweet bready flavor at first, with light caramel and toffee sweetness. There are fine, fruity ale esters bumping around to give off a sweet, floral taste. This is balanced with a finely bitter hop presence filled with grapefruit and pine notes. Very minimal alcohol warming near mid palate before finishing nice, dry and with a very slight oily bitterness.  M: Mouthfeel is medium bodied and super clean. The flavor and clarity are awesome so nothing gets in the way of slamming this brew down. Possibly one of the smoothest ales I've ever had.  D: A 7.5% ABV amber ale with hop aggression of an IPA and the smoothness of an English pale? Nugget Nectar is the bomb! The alcohol essentially goes undetected and the light hop and malt balance are so easy to down while never lacking full flavor anywhere. A very well crafted, dangerously drinkable ale.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Kaiser81,3.83,"Got in a trade from Stormking47. Thanks!  A - Poured from a bomber in a pub glass. A hazy amber with less than a finger width of head. it settles fairly quickly to leave a nice ring on the top of the beer. There is some nice lacing left on the glass at first, though less and less is left as I drink the beer.  S - I get a lot of piney hops mixed with grapefruit with just a touch of caramel. Not much else...kind of simple...but it does smell good.  T - It follows the nose pretty much. There are hops of front mixed with that touch of caramel. And then a huge boozy aftertaste. The alcohol is not mixed in very well at first, but as it opens, more flavors come out.  M - Medium body with a creamy feel and slight carbonation. Very nice for the style.  D - I think one would be enough, but I don't think I'd turn it down if another was offered.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

S - Smells of super bright hops and grapefruit, just awesome.  T - Bitter orange peeling and hops, with maybe some pear juice. Suprised it was as bitter as it was, I was expecting maybe just a tad more sweetness. Great Carbonation too.  M - Silky smooth, not oil or anything like that just really good.

A - Dark amber color with a one finger head that disappears as quickly as it formed. There was beautiful lacing down the glass as the beer was consumed.  S - Fairly unexciting. Oh, it's all there. The hops are somewhat floral but not pungent. There's a nice , doughy malt nose to it that's balanced well in there. Dried fruit sweetness. Nice but not overwhelming.  T - Follows the nose well. There's a sharp hop bite on the back of the palate, which alternately plays nice with the big malty flavors. It's well balanced and not out of control, with each flavor distinctly present.  M / D - Slick on my palate with a nice, long present mouthfeel.

Leaves continents of lacing all over the glass.  Smell: Tons of hop and malt aroma. Hops are floral, grassy, fruity, with definite notes of grapefruit and berries. Some deep sugary caramel notes in the background. Smells delicious.  Taste: Great balance of hops and malt, though the flavors are a bit less distinctive than in the aroma. Hops give a nice bitterness, with some subdued citrus and oily floral flavors. The malt is rich and occasionally bready. A lot of the flavors are big and bold, but smooth; not abrasive or over the top. Really good balance.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and creamy. A little oily, and finishes rather dry. Better than that description sounds.  Drinkability: Alcohol is well-hidden, and the beer delivers a lot of what a beer drinker might be craving (strong hops, smooth bread and caramel flavors).  I think I'm a bit hopped out as of late, because I really can't get excited by this beer at the moment. At the same time, it's very plainly well-done, and I don't have any complaints about it.

694,15881,tjinohio,3.96,"Appearance: The beer was a beautiful light, golden amber.  Smell: I did not find Nugget Nector (NN) to have a strong bouquet. There was a pronounced peach aroma over the hops.  Taste: Unlike the American Amber it is categorized as, NN is a strong, hoppy beer and this becomes apparent with the first taste. You are hit with the bitterness of an IPA followed by what I found to be a nutty aftertaste. As the beer warmed, more of the peach appeared in the taste.  Mouthfeel: This was the character of the beer I enjoyed the most. Good carbonation combined with the astringency of the hops makes the beer dance in your mouth. But the best came after the beer warmed a bit. It became quite smooth and silky on the pallet.  Drinkability: This was a very drinkable and enjoyable beer. It has a wonderful hoppiness, but I don't find it strong on taste. Additionally, the aroma is small.

Sweet caramel malt with candied oranges -- Cointreau? Southern Comfort? Also big on citrusy hops. Very nice.  T: Spicy and citrusy hops over caramel malt foundation. Good strong lingering bitterness, remins me of pine resin, even pine tar. Results in a drying feel in the aftertaste.  M: A bit slick in feel, moderately oily, but also smooth and creamy. Medium in weight.  D: Excellent. Goes down very easily, though there seemed to be a bit of spiciness in the hops that was more prevalent than when sampled from the bottle. That slight ""bite"" seemed to slow me down a tiny bit, and so I dropped this to a 4.5 rather than the 5 I gave it in the bottle.

Small crown of off white butter coloured head, that dissipates rather quickly. Great colour, but the head (or lack thereof) is slightly disappointing.  S: Rich floral, piney, resiny hops greet you with a bit of toasty malt in the background. Piney, leafy, herbal--you can definitely tell these aren't Cascades or Simcoe. Light ""skunky"" scent can be noticed as well.  T: Piney bittering hops, the slightest bit of grapefruit peel, some light toasty malt, and a bit of tropical fruit (pineapple) that barely makes its way through in the background before it is drowned by the piney character. A bit more malt comes in at the end, but the scathing bitterness is the main feature. A bit more sweet caramel malt comes through as it warms some and the carbonation dissipates. Hop resins fill the tastebuds leaving you satiated, yet craving more.  M: Medium carbonation with a clean mouthfeel provided by a sweeping wave of hop bitterness.  D: An interesting choice of hops to assault the taste buds with (Tomahawk, Nugget, Warrior), but I'm not complaining.

Pours a filtered clear amber color with a nice thin white head. It dissapated fast though. A little lacing but not much.  Aroma is strong on american hops and with a little light caramel flavor.  Taste is great. This is so smooth and easy drinking. It has the frothiness of a beer with alot of hops but it is not too bitter. The malt works very well with the hops. It's like a light candy sweetness. Great American hop taste.  Mouthfeel is great. Nice maltiness with a frothiness that is only described as that that is in high hop beers.

D- Alcohol is hidden well, nothing overpowering or offensive, not really quaffable but easy to drink.  2013: Pretty consistent year to year. Pours a clear amber, thick white head.

Head is a fluffy 2 fingers, but it recedes into a halo with some film on the top. Lacing is ample and generous.  S: Pine hop bomb at first... Mouth-watering in its pungency. Grass. Citrus (lemon). Then a floral and cinnamon spice aroma that -- and I apologize for saying this -- reminds me of urinal cakes. I had that association last year, and I'm still unable to break it.  T: Green pine-needle hops buoyed by faint grass and a substantial citric flavor. Floral hops in the mid-taste with light cinnamon. Caramel and chocolate malt manifest and become more apparent near the finish. There are a couple of imperial reds I enjoy more than this, but there's no questioning that this is a beer of high caliber.  M: Medium-bodied with good carbonation for an amber ale. Well-masked ABV.

Two fingers of white head slowly fade to leave a thick web of lace around the glass.  The aroma is full on juicy grapefruit and oranges. Mild piney hops but most fruity goodness. This reminds me alot of Hopslam. It has that sweetness that cuts through the hops.  The flavor is not as potent as the nose. Some citrus fruit and light pine hops. Nowhere near the bite I was anticipating. I'm not sure if it's the malt winning the battle of who's more dominant or just the hops not trying hard enough. This just doesn't have the huge hop flavor I expected.  Medium body. Seems a touch thin and slick.  Overall a very nice drinkable beer. Just a bit underwhelming.

694,15881,CHickman,4.87,"Pours copper rust color with a 1/2 inch creamy beige / off white head; a massive hop smell, with a huge floral hop aroma followed by piney hops, citrus, some sweet malt, light spices, grass, pine, yeast and more citrusy hops. Wow, the hop odor is so strong and inviting that it's almost hard to fathom. It smells like holding wet hops in your hand, and this is one of the best smelling beers I've ever encountered. The spotty lacing is good as it clings to the glass as this beer goes down.  The taste is intense and dominated by the floral and citrus hops, followed by some piney hops, orange peel, sweet malt, caramel, fresh cut grass (and or flowers), vanilla, grapefruit and slight spice burn from the insane amount of hops in the mix. The beer has a heavy chewy feel in the mouth, like you just finished chewing the actual hops, but it slides down crisp and creamy to oily with a semi-dry bitter finish which is actually on the lighter side in both carbonation and drinkability. It's very surprising how easy the beer was to down considering the smell and flavor intensity; this beer was actually refreshing and easy drinking, which is a nice contradiction to the potent aroma and taste present throughout this brew.  The balance was near perfect, and while the alcohol presence is noticeable throughout, it is masked well by the hops. Admittedly, after a few of these I felt the alcohol buzz, so be careful as these beers are potent.  I thought that the hype and ""A"" rating in BA would be just that, hype, but I am quite glad that this beer lived up to the expectations and was a stellar drink. I might even label this a DIPA instead of an imperial amber, but regardless of what it's labeled I will definitely get this beer again as it was so damn good. I hope Tröegs makes this available year round as this is a fantastic beer!  NOTE: After my first review, I had another bottle from this six pack Tröegs Nugget Nectar and drank it from the bottle to see how it would hold up and it passed with flying colors. The odor still burst out of the bottle and the taste was just as excellent as the bottles that I poured into glassware. A top notch beer!  2015 NOTE: Had this on tap (2/19/2015) at BBD's in Rocky Point, NY and it was outstanding; once again the hops are so juicy and pungent that it's always a pleasure to drink. Had 2 glasses as I enjoyed a perfect burger with blue cheese.

694,15881,FeDUBBELFIST,4.57,"Bottle to wine glass. Bottled on 1/7/10.  A: One finger off-white head, creamy with short retention. The foamy head quickly becomes a sudsy ring with a thin film in between. The color is a brilliant shade of a deep, rich amber. Sparkling clarity. Looking at this glass of beer is not at all unlike looking through a magnifying glass. Lacing was spare at best.  S & T: A very balanced brew boasting a wide spectrum of hop aromas plus a bigger than expected malt bill. The hops are advertised as Nugget, Tomahawk & Warrior. (Interestingly enough all bittering hops even though the result is not an overly bitter flavor, aroma or finish.) Grassy, piney and herbal with high notes of orange and grapefruit. The toasted caramel and hay malts have a rich depth that truly compliments, but does not challenge the hops. Light alcohol comes through on the nose only.  M: Lush and velvety smooth, especially as it warms. The Nugget Nectar becomes really creamy by the end of the glass. Give your glass a few swirls from time to time to witness the transformation of the mouthfeel. Medium-full body with the perfect amount of effervescence.  D: Top notch drinkability. The highlight of the brew is the flavor and the mouthfeel, and how each transforms throughout the drinking experience. A more perfect balance of malts to hops and sweetness to bitterness could not have been achieved.  I won't argue that the Nugget Nectar is an Amber Ale. IT IS! And it's justly classification is the MAIN reason why this brew deserves the high rating it has received. I would, however, love to see another percentage point in the ABV to help justify the imperial title.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,ToddT,4.8,"AA- Clear copper colored liquid topped with a one finger off white head. Head fades quickly to a cap and then to a ring but leaves some spotty lace on the glass.  S- Sweet grapefruit hops, floral esters and a slight notes of alcohol and pine.  T- Bitter grapefruit hops play back and forth with a malt backbone. Pine hops take over for a lingering final bitter note and a crisp finish.  M- Medium in body and well carbonated. Finish is very clean and crisp with a lingering final note of the hop bitters and very little oily residue..  D- Oh so drinkable and a little dangerous at a 7.5% ABV.  This is a beer that taste so perfect on cask that you must seek it out and try it this way.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,JosephLondon,4.3,"Thanks to msulinski for adding this one as an extra. The appearance is a one-fingered, off white head that rest upon a beautiful orange base. As I finished the brew, there were random patches of lace that splattered the glass. In the nose I smell grapefruit and sour fruit. The taste is excellent! There are bitter, citrus fruits. Lots of hop bite and a touch of alcohol. There feel is pure perfection. It coats the mouth and leaves a satin residue in the finish. For being such a bitter, hopped-out beer, it drinks much better than above average but not close to perfection. Overall, I have really enjoyed this beer and if it were available in my area it would frequent my fridge.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,jeffthecheff,4.42,"Thanks to Joe for picking me up some fresh Nugg from out of state.  The beer pours a light copper color with complete clarity. A thin white head sits on top with good lacing and retention.  The aroma has an herbal, spicy hop character as well as some unique fruitiness of apricots and grapefruit. Some pine sap and caramel comes through as it warms.  The mouthfeel is big and creamy with little carbonation. There is an impressivley strong apricot hop flavor in the middle. The finish is bitter, with a piney hop flavor and sweet caramel flavors. The caramel malts seem to help the apricot flavor in the middle shine, and the sharp pine hop flavors are a great contrast.  Nugget nectar is very easy to drink, and is very ""moreish"" for its strength. I usually would think twice before grabbing the same 7.5% beer three times in a row, but nugget nectar just begged me to. See you next year, nugg.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,photomike,4.55,"Big big thanks to largadeer for this kind gift.  Pours a brilliantly clear reddish orange that catches the light in a way that makes this beer glow. Three quarters inch of head has moderate retention and some very nice lacing. Great looking.  The scent of this beer hints at its balance in flavor; candied orange peels, carmelized sugars and sweetened grapefruit juice are the main components, representing the interplay of sweet crystal malts and citrusy hops. Very nice, but lacking a bit of ""punch"" needed to push this into ""5.0"" perfection.  Taste is more or less what I expected given the aroma. Caramelly crystal malts and a nice hit of citrusy hops are all over this one. A slightly bitter finish dries everything out nicely and really boosts the quaffability of this beer. Tastes like a more refined version of Oskar Blues Gordon to me.  Loads of tiny, effervescent bubbles make for a somewhat spicy mouthfeel. Oily body that coats your mouth and a lightly chewy finish. Just a hint of alcohol heat--right where it should be.  A very nice beer indeed, and worthy of its reputation. This goes down too easily, and I'll be sad to see the bottle end.

The Hop smell stands out. Strong but good. Very bold hop smell. I guess that's what it distinct. Someone mentioned grapefruit... I think that is a very good description.

Pours a nice clear gold with a great hear that hangs around for a few minutes and leaves a good lacing.  Immediate hops aroma, you can clearly smell all 3. Terrific mouthfeel, light, but still existent. Tastes of hops, so much so, it almost feels like you have the hops in your mouth. Citrus, pine, with a slight spice aftertaste. Finishes well.

Slight bitter hops, lemons, slight grapefruit. Malty finish.  Mouthfeel - Velvety smooth. Excellent  Drinkability - Overall the best in it's category. The best I've had from Troeg's also.

694,15881,zimm421,4.32,"Poured from a 12 oz glass into a pint. Appears a nice amber color with some ruby red hints to it. Has a nice thick white head, that dissipates slower than average and leaves great lacing.  This beer has a great nose to it, strong hops, with a pine scent dominating, as well as some good sweetness to the scents. The taste follows pretty well with the piney hops dominating. Lots of bitterness to start out, with some sweetness coming in midway to help balance out the tastes. Finishes fairly dry and bitter, but not completely overwhelming.  The mouthfeel is fairly smooth, with not too much carbonation. Leaves a good, thick, smooth coating throughout the mouth and on the tongue. Drinkability is great. With flavor like this, and not too high of an ABV, this beer is something that could be very sessionable, although I prefer to enjoy these one or two at a time. Overall a great brew, just what I expected after reading reviews and posts about this beer, one great seasonal offering.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,TonyReaves,3.81,"I was really excited to pick up some of this on a trip to Mass. I think this was the first thing I put in my cart. I loved Troegs Hopback Amber, and I'd heard this was an amped up version of Hopback. Bottled 34 days ago.  Beautiful golden-red color, perfectly clean-looking despite a boatload of hops. Luscious head that sticks around for awhile.  Smells pretty good for the style. Citrusy, but not a ton of aroma.  Not overly malty like a lot of beers this strong where sweetness overpowers the bitterness. This is a pretty bitter brew- moreso than I expected from the color. Not sure why this isn't an IPA as it's more hop-dominated than, say, 90 min. IPA. Maybe it's the relatively low hopping in the aroma?  Smoother than I expected. Dangerously easy to drink, especially since it's not as intense as I'd expected. I guess that's the problem with hype.  Still, a great beer that I'll definitely be buying again.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,irish,4.33,"This beer really snuck up on me one time! The first time I drank it, I brought a growler and was sitting on the porch enjoying a pint or two, along with a nice cigar, in the summer night. When I stood up, everything went spinning, like taking ether for an operation (I am old enough to have experienced this.) Whassamatter?! It couldn't be the beer--I only had a pint or two. Well, I did a panic-y checklist--stroke? fever? LSD flashback?--but nothing seemed to answer. Eventually I did check on the alcohol content, and considered how many I had drunk (more than a pint or two, imagine that) and how easy it was to drink, and came to realize, damn!, that ol' ""nectar"" sure crept up on me!  I love this beer. But it is TOO easy to drink...  Pours a copper amber, with a lingering lace and appealing small bubbles.  The nose actually portends a robust alcohol base, if you pause to notice it (which I did not do initially...)  As for taste, it is one of those beers whose balance and easy drinkability can fool you into paying less attention than it deserves. This is my kind of beer--it doesn't knock you out by overpowering you with a distinctive taste that can with further sips become overbearing. No, it sucks you right in with its balance and its absence of any flaws. Except for the nose and a bit of fullness in the body, you could easily mistake this for a session beer. At least until the wife/SO starts to look curiously at you and your glass.  Regarding ""drinkability"" I don't know whether to reward or penalize the beer. Initially, I'd be inclined to give it high ratings. But if you are planning to drive or get laid, I'd do just the opposite.

S - The nose really opened up with a few swirls. Lots of citrus - some distinct grapefruit notes - with sweet honey. The hops are very present but not much in terms of floral notes.  T - An explosion of hops with an abundance of citrus; the grapefruit really comes through again. A somewhat earthy flavour is present with a sweet aftertaste (honey). A very nice mix of an amber and an IPA. And an even more impressive balance of bitter hops and some sweet malts.  M - A medium to fully body for an ale with a nice, sticky/chewy texture on the tongue.  D - The ABV is masked very well. The carbonation, which looked to be too present at first is perfect.

A - Poured a beautiful clear amber/orange body with half a finger's width of frothy off-white foam that settled into a patchy veil and deposited ample sticky lacing around the glass.  S - Mmmmm... that first smell is still amazing no matter how many of these I've had. Subsequent whiffs reveal pungent pine notes, citrus fruit and a sweet caramel malt base. This brew just reeks of fresh hops.  T - Nugget Nectar to me is all about balance. At 93-ish IBUs, it's quite bitter of course, but the malt backbone is huge, resulting in an insanely balanced flavor profile that artfully combines sweet caramel and lightly toasted grains with a bold hop profile suggesting sticky pine, citrus rind and leafy oils.  M - Medium bodied with a sticky mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. Hops stick with you for a bit, but they don't wear out their welcome on the palate. Finishes bittersweet with a slight alcohol warmth on the palate.  D - This isn't my favorite beer because it's a chore to drink. Despite its higher ABV and heady hop profile, Nugget Nectar drinks like a champ. And it still remains one of the best smelling beers I've ever had.

Very clean and clear looking with some moderate carbonation.  smell- Mostly just piney hops, but there is definetly some sweet malt in there as well.

694,15881,BeerBelcher,4.06,"This beer wasn't exactly what I expected, but I liked it quite a bit for what it was. I thought it was going to be a really BIG beer, teetering on the edges of what is possible with hoppiness...packing as much hop bitterness into a beer as is zymurgically possible on this earth. And it wasn't that, which surprised me, given as much hype as this beer gets. Instead, it was a very hoppy, yet still fairly light and eminently drinkable beer. It didn't, as the commercial description suggests, make me ""pucker up,"" but it did have more than enough hops to satisfy my cravings for bitterness, while being sessionable enough to have several. This beer looks beautiful - it is a copper red, but has a brilliant body (unlike a lot of other highly hopped DIPAs which seem to become cloudy and opaque with their increased bitterness). Aroma is hoppy with lots of citrus undertones. Flavor is surprisingly balanced, with a good amount of maltiness under-cutting some of the hop bitterness and perhaps explaining why this beer didn't seem as BIG as I expected. Hop characteristic in the taste was more the sweetly-sweaty-sock variety - think a toned-down Moylan's Hopsickle. Mouthfeel was mildly sticky, but pretty good.  All in all, a nice beer. A bit pricey at $12.99/6-pack, but certainly worth the price of admission if you've yet to try it.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

A big punch of citrus and pine hops with a noticeable but not overpowering caramel sweetness from the malt.  T: The flavor is very similar to the nose, but a bit more intense. The hops really steal the show here and give you a nice bitter pine and grapefruit combination both on the front end and on the finish. In between there is a bit of sweetness from the malt.

The beer poured a clear reddish orange, with a good-sized white head. Aroma is all fresh hops and not particularly aggressive or assertive. The taste is citrusy hops with a substantial malt backbone...which makes it sound like a fairly unremarkable IPA. However what sets this apart in my mind is how fresh, crisp and clean the flavors are. The hops taste like they have just been harvested and the beer is extremely crisp. There are no lingering out aftertastes, only something telling you to drink more. Nectar is a perfect description of this beer.

Orange, lemon and grapefruit appear at the forefront followed closely by fresh pine. Some malt comes into play around the middle, revealing some caramel notes to give a little balance to the hoppy beginning. Finish is a bit spicy as the hops make one final appearance.  Medium body with perfect carbonation. I know this one gets hyped up every year but from where I stand, it is well deserved.

Very clear and crisp looking with a thin creamy head which as you drink blankets the sides of the glass nicely with micro-bubbles. Color is a caramel brown-amber, again this thing is clear enough to read through- perfectly!  The smell is pleasant and fresh but very weak. Im getting lite smells of citrus, grass, and pine as I swirl it around.  Taste is amazing, fresh hops, big citrus, and lite malts blended and balanced perfectly roll through the mouth without any stringent characters before you swallow for a clean finish. Great fresh, crisp citrusy hop taste cleanly vanishes leaving you in need of the next sip. The pine and malts become more present as you move through it revealing a balance of ""citra-sweetness"". Fairly lite body, this beer provides what one would expect from it judging by the look of the label, color, and clarity of it in the bottle.

694,15881,krisandajt,4.47,"A tasty beer I've enjoyed many times, I figure it's about time I sat down and done a review.  Appearance: Poured from a bomber into my Sam Adams Perfect Pint Glass, the beer is a clear, reddish amber color with a good inch worth of white, finely bubbled head. The head takes its time fading, and there's nice sticky rings of lacing where the beer settles.  Smell: A big hit of citrusy, grapefruity hops. Reminds me more of an IPA than an Amber Ale, and that is definitely not a bad thing. Not picking up much of a malt presence, the hops definitely steal the show with this one.  Taste: This is such a great tasting beer. There's plenty of grapefruit from the hops, and not a lot of sweetness from the malt to get in the way. There's a nice crisp, clean finish at the end that really makes this an all-round enjoyable beer.  Mouthfeel: Plenty of bite from the carbonation, a nice medium to full body, and a good clean finish.  Drinkability: One of the few seasonal beers that I really look forward to enjoying every year.

Smelled typical of an amber, with a big citrusy hop presence. The smell was strong enough but it didn't jump out of the bottle and chase me around the room like I prefer.  Wayne and Garth said it best,""Schwing!!"" Oh man did this ever taste good. Starts off citrusy at first then fades to a mellow sweet caramel-like middle and right before the swallow ends up just a touch piney. Alcohol is almost invisible in the flavor. Well crafted. The finish is sort of abrupt but it just begs your mouth to take another sip.  Mouthfeel is a little thin for something with this much flavor. A little more viscous and this would be perfect.

694,15881,SpeedwayJim,3.98,"Poured from a bomber into a Captain Lawrence pint glass.  A: Vigorous pour yields a 3.5 finger coarse, creamy orange head bursting with aroma... but that's for later. Retention is decent considering how much head there is. Beer is crystal clear red. Lacing is frothy, thick, to the point where I can barely see the glass.  S: Strong hop character contrasts starkly with a distinct citrus. I've never experience two scents so cleanly different from each other. But this is proving to be the exception.  T: Astringent hop character upfront that transitions nicely into a citrus flavor. There's a battle going on here between these two and the longer I keep the beer in my mouth, swirling it around, the more punches I experience. Astringent hops triumph towards the end though, leaving my mouth and tongue throbbing from the fight.  M: Light to medium bodied, a bit carbonated, but surprisingly smooth as it goes down. Watery but at the same time, hop character is so strong it almost becomes sticky. Finish and aftertaste don't let you forget anything. This beer stays in my mouth long past the swallow.  D: I had this before I was an ""experienced"" craft beer drinker and I absolutely HATED it... how times (and palates) have changed. Incredible drinkability because of the smoothness with a big, bold, distinctive flavor. Not a balanced brew at all, but I definitely appreciated it. My first bomber alone! if that says anything...",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,jera1350,4.15,"Thanks to Joe (krisandajt) for this one. You are one hell of a trader and an outstanding guy.  Bright copper color with a thin layer of off-white foam that leaves a bit of lacing.  Sugary malt with a moderate mandarin orange scent to compliment. Getting some apricot as well.  Everything you could ask for in an amber, but with some extra. Nice amount of caramel malt for sweetness and then the hops kick in. Are they huge and in your face? No, not at all. They make their presence known, but at the same time complement the malt. It's a nice and lightly biting citrus hop taste. Nice balance happening.  Great smooth feel with carbonation that feels soft and slightly prickly. Very clean and dry finishing.  I'm almost done with the beer and I just started it. Goes down as easy as any beer I've had. It's almost impossible for me to believe this is seven and a half percent alcohol. If I didn't know that, I would call this a session beer. Just a solid, solid beer that I think almost every craft beer drinker would enjoy. Thanks again Joe!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,kzoobrew,4.2,"Big thanks to Beandip for this bottle. Cheers!  Clear honey amber colored body capped by a two finger creamy white head. The head slowly makes its way back leaving very decent lacing clinging to the side of the glass. Creamy ring is ultimately all which remains of the head.  Hop profile hits on aromas across the spectrum. Citric aroma is the most dominate though there is a rather strong pine presence. Grassy smells come through but are largely overwhelmed by the citrus and pine. The malt is not to be completely ignored either. Caramel and slightly bready malts provide a sturdy base and slight balance.  Sweet citrus flavors meet the tongue first. Citrus sweetness soon turns to pithy bitterness and a piny bite. Lingering hops flavors tend to lean towards the more floral, earthy side of the spectrum. Malt is strong but an underlying flavor. Bready, caramel with a slight nuttiness. Certainly hop forward but very well balanced. The balance was not expected to this extent but is appreciated.  Medium bodied and moderately carbonated. Drinks smooth leaving a coating of sticky icky hop resin plastered to the tongue.  I am certainly glad to have tried Nugget Nectar, I walk away impressed with my first offering from Troegs. While I was expecting a little more, it is hard to be disappointed. Very easy drinking with loads of flavor. Alcohol just slightly noticeable in the back of the throat but it would take a few to become a hindrance.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,cleeze,4.34,"Stopped by Julio's the other weekend on my way home from the wine-expo to grab some goodie, glad I finallly got my hands on this nectar.  Poured a decent amber hue that produced a huge, frothy creamy colored head and some bad ass lacing to go with it.  Smells like a hop bomb, my friends! Piney on the nose. Some citrus fruit up in there as well (grapefruit and some orange) Is that some malty goodness I detect? I think so.  Again loads of fresh crisp hops. An amber ale ater a cyle or two on some roids and peaking with some rage. Malty goodness. I really think this sucker is well rounded. great brew.  Drinkability is off the charts, so smooth and crisp. I would drink this as fresh as possible",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,turnstile,4.64,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter.  Appearance: Pours a dark amber with an off-white head that quickly dissipated. Film left on the surface, no lacing.  Smell: Tons of piney hops in this one. Mild citrus hops and mango aromas in the background. Second time around, floral notes become increasingly present with some orange and spice. Very, very clean aromas here.  Taste: Piney and citrus hops dominate. Toasted malts. Nicely bittered and the above-average ABV is hidden well. Slightly sweet, dry finish.  Mouthfeel: Creamy with light carbonation. A little on the heavier side and a slightly syrupy finish.  Drinkability: Pretty drinkable. Lots of aromas and flavor notes to uncover. Could have a second.  Overall, a great hoppy brew. A lot of times these sort of hop-forward brews are too bitter to for me to enjoy thoroughly, but Nugget Nectar certainly has its sweet balance which makes it approachable for anyone.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Pours amber in color with a two finger white head. It's very bright and clear and left good lacing which makes it a pretty damn good looking beer in my opinion.  Aroma is hoppy and floral with some pine and citrus. A very nice pleasing hoppy smell for anyone that enjoys hops. Taste is just as delicious as the nose lets on. It's hoppy as one would expect but also slightly sweet. The sweetness is offset by the long dry bitter finish very nicely though. Very nicely balanced between the sweetness and the bitterness.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Drinkability is fantastic, I could drink these all day. if this was beer that was available all year long it would definitely be my go to beer.

This is just an excellent beer, as simple as that. So drinkable, wicked hoppy and a malt backbone that pleases the palate. I love that oak wood dryness and grapefruit.

I had to give the perfect score in the smell category because it was the most pungent nose I've ever had the pleasure of whiffing on an Amber Ale. Lots of dark, resiny grapefruit, toasted malts, spruce with orange and caramel rounding it out in both aroma and taste. Nice medium thickness for the style with an understated carbonation to offset the crispness.

694,15881,sisuspeed,4.3,"Poured into a pint glass. Clear, amber-red body with a decent white head. A very nice looking Red.  Earthy, piney, grassy hops attack the nose, eventually giving way to sweeter and roastier malts.  The taste is excellent. The best way I can think to describe the flavor is smooth, malty, bitterness. By far, the best Red Ale I have had. Oily, bitter hops mix with sweet, yet slightly bitter malts. Earth and grass notes linger on the finish. Lots of flavor in this Red.  Mouthfeel is fairly smooth and somewhat chewy. Good, full body on this beer.  Drinkability is quite good. The glass in front of me is almost empty. Not quite a session beer, but once you have one of these, it will be hard to resist grabbing another.  Overall, this is a great Imperial Amber/Red Ale. Most definitely my favorite and it almost lives up to the hype. My mind wasn't blown, but I'm really glad I have another six pack of this in the fridge waiting for me. I'm pretty sure Nugget Nectar will become a staple in my drinking routine this time of year, every year. Nice work Troegs.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,abuliarose,4.77,"Pours a nice red-amber color with very little head. Pretty lacing, though. Smells in all respects like an IPA with floraly citrusy fresh hops. Amazing smell, but as the name implies.  Tastes incredibly bitter, but in the best way imaginable. Intense hop flavor at first sip with a little citrus backing to it but mostly in your face hopness, smoothed out so thin it doesn't hurt your tongue by silky maltiness. It's almost light-bodied, but the maltiness bumps it just into the medium range and leaves a gentle, clean finish. How is it so hoppy and so drinkable? I don't know. It's like magic.  Carbonation is small and adds some piercing zing to the beginning, but not enough to KO your tongue. Mouthfeel is a little grainy in with the carbonation, but almost watery smooth on the way out. Very, very drinkable. This bottle will be over entirely too quickly.  Overall, it's a pretty neat brew. I have never tasted a better red ale. I don't know if I ever will.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Medium lacing clinged to the slippery sides of the pint glass.  Smells of strong pine and resin, the two most accurate adjectives for describing hops. Nice.  The taste is rich in hop citrus, a bold rush of them, in fact. However it never becomes overpowering and the bitterness is relatively tame. The coldest initial sips were a bit marred by a hint of soapiness in the aftertaste, but this slowly faded. Tastes of biscuit and orange zest blossom as it warms. Mouthfeel is good but nothing unique about it.  I'd order another, but wouldn't be drinking this all night.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

The taste is very interesting with very nice grapefruit and other citrus flavors as well as some pine, all incorporated with a nice smooth caramel malt backbone. It is quite sweet, but with just enough bitterness to make it all come together. Why can't all ambers have this much hop character? Medium bodied with a finish that is quite nice and not too sweet.

The big hop presence carries into the taste with more citrus and piney hops. But the hops don't fade to bitterness. Instead, there's just enough sweetness (think honey, not sugar) that balances the hops perfectly. Not cloying or overdone. Instead, the taste just invites another drink.  M - Medium body and very enjoyable. Maybe a little light for an imperial, but works well for this beer.  D - wish I could get this on a regular basis. It would quickly become a go-to beer.

There is a caramel bread aroma which takes a back seat to the hops aroma.  T - A smooth blast of hop resin with flavors of citrus and pine anchoring the initial taste which fades to a sweet malty bread like flavor which is chewy and caramel like. I can definitely taste more of an amber profile here which is very unique and quite good. The finish is bitter typical of a strong IPA or DIPA.  M - Moderate carbonation with a pretty dry creamy finish. The hop profile really pops in my mouth and is quite tangy and sweet.

Alcohol content is high and beware because the balanced flavors and watery mouth feel make these drain fast.  Would like to add that Troegs is getting too pricey for a beer made in Harrisburg.

A - Deep gold to pale amber clear pour, with a fair head, medium retention and some lacing.  S - There is brief initial whiff that is spectacular, very rich in citrus and fruit notes... Grapefruit, pineapple, floral. Then it fades so quickly that what is left, while nice, is a pale shadow of the initial scent... Retaining a very subdued form of the same floral, fruity, and citrusy hoppy aroma.  T - There is a rich hoppy range with a very particular malty base. In fact, like others point out, it is a well structured lager-like sensation that never overwhelms but neither fades completely. Citrus, pineapple, are woven richly with that soft honey like sweetness.  M - Medium body and carbonation. It feels a bit watery and flat at times with a smooth malty base leaning to a light feel, carbonation picks it up a bit and rescues it around the hoppy finish.  D - Rather nice drink, feels stimulating although some qualities fade to quickly to make it very remarkable.  Notes: A touch over-hyped, although still a rather worthy brew, although it could also be due this year's incarnation. The price-quality ratio is pretty good, and overall is recommendable albeit with a sense of measure.

T: The taste on this beer is phenomenally balanced, but overhyped nonetheless. Expect an IPA balance with hops up front and roasted malt used in the background.

This ale has great visual complexity.  The aroma is as good as it gets. Grapefruit explodes during the pour and fills the nose with every sip. The flavor doesn't quite hold up to the smell; it's a bit more bland. The feel, however, is aggressive and as explosive as the aroma.

The flavor is watered down, there is no way the same amount of hops was used in this years nectar and I swear it has less carbonation than last year. It all falls apart so fast in your mouth.

Light to medium bodied, but you don't need a fuller body for such a highly flavored brew. Refreshing.  Exceptionally drinkable. The main thing slowing me down was the Mad Elf's 11.0 ABV.  The first really hoppy beer I've reviewd since Dogzilla, (11 reviews ago) which it blows away, and the second highest ranking beer I've ever tried next to Stone Imperial Russian Stout. I wasn't all that impressed the first time I tried this, but apparently I've since become a hop-head as I now think this knocks off Firestone 13 as my new favorite brew. (Thanks to Stone Brewery for their Hopheads 101 course)",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,NicholasSchell,4.4,"A- Pours a medium amber color with a dense 2 1/2 finger head that slowly dissipates to half a finger leaving lacing clinging for dear life on the way down.  S- Pine, it's like being on a christmas tree farm. Faintest citrus or floral aroma.  T- Still get lots of pine and resins but this is brilliantly balanced with the ever so light sweetness of the malt. Hops are not bitter at all, just packed with flavor.  M- Medium body, medium carbonation, both fit well with this brew.  D- Flavor is great and not overwhelming, I'll have a few aware of the ABV.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,boatshoes,4.32,"Picked up a bomber of this at Whole Foods Bowery on a recent trip to New York. My first experience with the beer and quite excited.  Appearance- Pours a translucent orange-amber with lots of bubbling carbonation about a finger and a half of off-white head sitting on top. Minimal head retention but some lacing left as I drink and beading carbonation throughout.  Smell- Lots of piney hops initially in the nose. However, definitely some detectable sweet caramel in there as well. Was not as much of a hop punch in the face as I was expecting and smelled almost like a barleywine. That being said, it was a very nice and well blended combination that showed lots of promise for the beer.  Taste- As with the nose, it is piney, resinous hops that are first across is flavor. A nice hop bite. Again however, really more balanced than I was expecting. Lots of sweet caramel and bready malt comes through to balance out the hops so that it isn't a complete punch in the tongue. I for one found this to be a very tasty and well balanced combination that lent itself well to my love of both extreme hops and malt. Once again I find myself almost comparing it to a hoppy barleywine.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Mouthfeel is very solid with a thick and slick body but a touch of drying finish from the hops. Dangerously drinkable for the ABV as well if you are into big and balanced beers.  Overall, a pleasure to drink. May be a let-down to some hopheads, but I found the extra little balance to make this beer a real winner.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Kelp,3.65,"Pours an amber red color with minimal head and lacing to it. Head recedes quickly.  Smells of hops, citrus(grapefruity), and pine.  It reminds me more of an IPA than an amber/red ale. Hopes right out front, followed by grapefruit and pinesol. No real after taste which is nice since I don't really like grapefruit.  It is a bit watery to me. Nothing overly impressive here. Feels a bit slick though only saving point.  I could have one or two, but not my favorite type. I know alot of people are talking about this or Hopslam right now, and let me tell you i would take a Hopslam 9 out of 10 times hands down. It's a good beer to me, but not a great beer. Maybe the next one will change my mind.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,atremains,4.6,"Pours a very pristine looking clear amber with a fluffy white head that diminishes rather fast reducing to a ring. Modest lacing. Carbonation is visible and attractive. Smell is a slap of citrus with some earthy floral feel to it and malt. Fantastic! Citrus hops join up with the with the carbonation and dance around on my tongue creating a deliciously enjoyable experience. Big malt body to it as well, synergistic with the bitterness of the hops to balance the extreme. Some earthen hoppy notes as well and a bit of caramel. Bit thin on the feel, but nothing significant that I miss. The carbonation is dead on. Very! smooth beer, the taste is big and full and the finish leaves you thirsty for another one.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,nhopkin,4.05,"22 oz bomber poured into a pint glass  Appearance: Rich red-orange. Kind of light for an amber ale. Smallish offwhite head, with a little sticky lacing.  Smell: pungent hops and a sweet orange citrus aroma come through in the nose.  Taste: Nugget Nectar is far more subtle than I expected but delicious. Lots of fruity hop flavor; especially orange/grapefruit. Restrained but complementary sweet malt backs it up. Bitter, but not as bitter as many an IPA or other hoppy ale. Tiny amount of alcohol burn as well. Sweetish, balanced, and subtly complex. Nectar indeed.  Mouthfeel: On the lighter side, considering it's strength. Carbonation is adequate. A very juicy beer.  Dirnkability: Goes down startlingly easy. Great stuff, doesn't bash you on the head; balance wins the day.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,morimech,4.52,"Bottled on 01/12/10. Courtesy of Kadonny.  Pours a clear amber color with one inch of white head that had excellant retention before settling to a thick cap. Surprising lack of lacing considering the abundance of hops. Still has a little sticky lacing though. Big blast of hops in the aroma. Mostly pine scents but also a touch of citrus and grass. The malt adds some toasted qualities. No surprises with the hop flavor. Pungent and resinous. Pine and citrus battle it out for supremacy. The malt actually adds its own qualities to this beer so it is more than a lot of the hop bombs populating the shelves. Bitterness is high but not out of control considering the 93 IBUs. Medium body but hard to consider this an Imperial beer. Just enough carbonation to give some life, nice texture. Questionable drinkability at 7.5% ABV but with such nice hop flavor, I would give it my best effort. I do not think this would wear out a palate like other hop bombs.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,CharlatanSin,4.25,"Snagged a bottle at Whole Foods. Been hearing great things about it, and it's finally time to give it a try.  The beer pours into a pint glass a perfectly clear amber. The pour creates a big, airy off-white head. The head falls pretty quickly into a minimal cap, and the beer leaves patchwork lacing.  The smell is primarily citrus and herbal hops. The hoppiness is complimented by a sweet, bready malt backbone. Not too shabby. The taste is better. The citrus hops reveal themselves to be a succulent, juicy smorgasbord. Possibly the best straight-up fruity hop profile I've yet sampled. I'm picking up orange, grapefruit and nectarine strongly. The malt balance is a little weak, which surprised me for a strong amber. Still, the tremendous citrus hop profile is a rare treat for a hophead like me. The alcohol is noticeable, but not distracting.  The mouthfeel is definitely the beer's weak point. It's a bit light and watery for the style, and carbonation is a point too low. I'd like a beer with this gorgeous a hop profile to be a bit stickier. But it's not bad enough that it detracts from the taste. I finished the bomber gladly, and will happily do so again in the future.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,PretzelCity,3.53,"Thanks to ericwo for the chance to try this years batch. Pours a very nice clear honey amber color into the glass with a fluffy one inch white head. Nice and crystal clear, this is a pretty attractive beer. The nose is nice, some malt in there but mostly hops, oily hoppy resin. The taste is pretty similar to the nose, there's some malt in there but mainly it all nugget. Not a lot of complexity, not an overwhelming hop bite or kick, just a nice solid flavor. Mouthfeel is good, light to medium body, the beer just kind of rolls over your tongue with a little bit of a piney aftertaste. Pretty drinkable, I could easily see having a bunch of these with some non beer loving buddies.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Stigs,4.52,"12oz bottle, served in a standard pint glass  A - somewhat aggressive pour yields about a finger of off-white loosely packed foam. the beer itself is crystal clear, strong amber colored with active bubbly carbonation.  S - best part of the beer. could just sit there and smell this for days. loads and loads of juicy citrus hops with some grass and pine notes, and a big malty caramel backbone. just delicious.  T - full of fruity citrus hops then a swift bittering bite of grassy hops. malts kind of fall flat as after the hop attack everything finishes kind of eh, watery. still good, just doesnt develop into anything out of this world.  M - mildly carbonated, which i love. medium bodies with a nice slick and oily feel.  D - crazily drinkable (and dangerous). can put down many of these and not get weary. only thing slowing me down is stopping to take a few good snifs between almost every sip.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

694,15881,goldbot,4.19,"Bottled 1/12/2010.  Pours golden amber in color with a foamy, albeit thin white head. The head quickly dissipates leaving a haze across the surface. A bit of lacing and good carbonation.  Strong, sticky aromas of pine tree, grapefruit, and orange. Nice and hoppy, as I expected. Floral, planty, and refreshing. As the beer warms, some malt notes become more noticeable.  Tastes of nice hops up front more bitter pine flavor, with grapefruit and orange again. Nicely bitter. What is surprising is the sweeter malt notes which immediately back up the hop presence. The aftertaste is pleasantly bitter with hoppy pine flavors making a comeback.  The body is nothing spectacular, but backs up the other aspects of the beer nicely. Light to perhaps medium body, the carbonation is not overwhelming.  Overall I was very pleasantly surprised. I expected a hop bomb which this definitely was not.

Aromas of very sweet citrus, just a touch of pine. A little like white grape juice, almost a little too sweet which hurts drinkability.  A good beer, but I'm not sure it's deserving of the hype.

Smells great, floral, pine, citrus notes, little bit of sweet malts hidden behind the hop aromas.  Tastes of citrus and pine hoppiness, great flavor. This is definitely one of my favorite brews. Great balance for an ipa (although it says imperial amber it really tastes more like an ipa.)

Pleasant.  T: Some sweet malts transition to a citric hoppy finish. Finish is also pretty bitter. To be honest, I was expecting more.  M: A solid medium body with a nice bite of carbonation in the finish.  D: Am I missing something here? This is by no means a bad beer, but I've seen lots of people raving about this one for months and I wasn't really impressed. I drank it kind of warm, 50ish degrees. Maybe I just need to drink it at a colder temperature, but as of right now I'm a little disappointed. Hype aside, however, it's a decent beer.  Edit 3/14/10: I've had this a few more times since my first disappointing experience and I admit it's grown on me some. I still don't agree that this is an amazing brew, but it's tasty and fairly drinkable. I've come to enjoy the nice mix of bitter hops and amber ale malt backbone. It's very refreshing on tap too.

694,15881,Walken,4.62,"Troegs: Nugget Nectar (Bottled 01/07/10) (Tasted 01/23/10) 12 oz. Bottle, poured into a tulip pint.  Appearance: Brilliantly clear golden amber, bubbles rushing up to feed the even, frothy off-white head. Sticky lacing clings on the sides of the glass like a first time boyfriend. Odor: Waxy grapefruit pith, orange zest, some perfumy floral aromas in the background with hints of breadiness. Intense and focused hop aroma. Consistency: Light body, hop oils and bready malt lift the body up a bit, a few tics shy of being medium. Carbonation is perfect, not intrusive, but enough to lift the flavors into view. Flavor: Juicy, fresh hop flavor, similar to the aroma but leaning more towards orange with a waxy grapefruit back-end. Malt is an afterthough, but that's ok! There's some definite complexity going on with the mixed German base malts, a layered breadiness that doesn't push too much sweetness. Finish is very clean, some hop and bready malt flavors linger, very refreshing.  This beer is remarkable. As per the recipe listed on their site, the subtle malt complexities in this beer come from a mix of pils, vienna and munich malt, with no specialty malts to muddy up the hop flavor, pretty brilliant.

I recently reviewed Troegs Hop Back amber ale and this to me truly does seem to be an Imperial version of that beer.

Smells of citrus, maybe pink grapefruit, pine resin and earthy, herbal hopiness.  There a lots of complex hop flavors here; clearly present and in force, yet not overpowering at all.

Very good aroma, but less ""in-your-face"" than I remember, doesn't jump out at you. As it warms, a kind of resin-y hop smell builds, still subtle though.  Again, bright citrus notes in the taste, rounded out by just enough clean malt to be detectable & balancing. Kind of a barely noticeable cola caramel taste to it. Aftertaste has hints of sweetness while still being on the bitter & refreshing side. Booze creeps in about halfway through the glass.  Medium-light body, enough carbonation & acid to entertain without becoming prickly or sharp.  Honestly not quite as good as I remember, but still pretty damn good.

694,15881,rfgetz,4.55,"I've had this beer a few times in bottle, draft and even on cask... and this 22oz bottled version beats the pants off of all of them.  The appearance is a coppery amber color, thin egg cream colored head with minimal retention, but what little ring is left leaves decent sticky lacing. Smell is somewhat tame compared to the cask and draft versions ive had... a more mellow blend of aggressive malts and hops that kinda cancel eachother out. Taste is where this puppy shines... the cask version i had recently was way too green with overpowering flavors on each sip. This bottle is a wonderful blend of smooth, light carmely, buttery and nutty malts backed by a wonderful citrus, earthy and floral hop taste. Perfect medium body for the style, carbonation could use a touch more but still very good. Excellent beer.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,BearsOnAcid,3.81,"After having it for the first time last year because we finally got Troegs I was excited for a very fresh offering this year.  Nugget Nectar poured out wonderfully clear with a frothy white head. The color was a robust maple syrup. Some lacing stuck but mostly fell back down the glass. The color is gorgeous but the head and lacing is rather unattractive.  There is a considerable amount of dry hopping. There's a nutty, woody aroma, similar to Simcoe, with a piney background. I could smell this all day. I wish that someone would make a deodorant out of this beer.  I have to let my tastes adjust a little after having a sour earlier. The woody hop flavor is found in the flavor. There's a lot of fresh juicy grapefruit. This beer fully lives up to it's name. It is hop nectar. The malt is not very sweet. The hops actually over power the beer a little. You can detect a little bit of caramel but your taste buds are hindered by the hop profile. A little bit of astringency forms a while after you swallow. Alcohol isn't too strong, but you can taste it.  Mouthfeel is light. The carbonation makes this beer smooth to drink. This beer is great for hop heads. I can get through a bomber without a problem.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Very nice creamy lacing.  Wonderful aroma. Lots of fruit and hops. Picking up orange and lemons. Overall it's a sweet and inviting aroma.  Flavor is very hoppy on the palate at first, along with strong carbonation...but as the hops flavor fades, a sweet musty flavor comes forward and leaves an awesome aftertaste.

S: Alot of citrus hop notes  T: I dont know, this just tastes like a decent IPA to me (even though its not technically an IPA). Alot of citrus hops up front, some miniscule malt backbone, plenty of lingering bitterness. I was expecting something about the taste to catch me off guard given the hype surrounding this brew.  M: I was hoping for something much thicker than this! When I close my eyes and think of the name ""nugget nectar"", it sounds much more chewy than what I experienced. Moderate carbonation, prickly enough to carry it through.

694,15881,cbutova,4.37,"A very solid beer that I have had a few times before this. Appearance is good. Standard clear amber color is nice here and the head goes up to about two fingers with decent retention. It was very creamy looking while it lasted and leaves pretty thick lacing behind. During the drinking a white cloud stays on top of the beer. Smell, to me, is the best part about this beer. A blast of hops hits the nasal passage with lots of citrus, pine and grapefruit notes. I can get some malt in the background, which is nice in this very strong aroma. It basically smells like a very good IPA/DIPA. Taste is a bit too bitter to me and throws the balance off. The huge citrus, pine and grapefruit notes stick around very well. The bitterness from the hops basically demolishes my palate, even after having a huge amount of hop bombs. I get some pale malt taste behind the hops, which helps to balance this beer out. Without some of the bitterness, this beer would be much better IMO. This beer actually reminds me a LOT of Celebration Ale, now that I think of it. Mouthfeel is right on for the taste. Medium bodied, medium carbonation feel good, some creaminess. Huge bitterness and hop flavors stay on the tongue, crazy coat of bitters, damn. No alcohol taste or feel really in this beer. This beer is actually so bitter, it reminds me of the time I ate a hop pellet, bad memories. Drinkability is decent. The one reason is that the super bitterness makes htis one hard to drink a whole bomber. The price is good for such a big beer, maybe in a month or so some of the bitterness will die down and it will remind me of last year's Nugget Nectar. I have never had it this so fresh, maybe my taste has just changed since last year. I still enjoy this beer through the bitterness, nice job by Troegs and very affordable for once (wish more breweries followed the example).",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

S - Hops, but not as strong as I suspected they would be. Light citrus profile as well, mainly oranges and lemons. No strong grapefruit.  T - Light citric bitterness, like a blend of traditional hop bitterness and lemon/grapefruit but definitely stronger in the former characteristic.

694,15881,BigDoug,4.92,"22oz bottle poured into a pint glass.  First off, I wish this beer was a little easier to get. I could only get my hands on 2 bombers of this great beer.  It pours a nice orange coppery amber color with a perfect 2 finger head. Lacing is nice. Rings around the glass turn into a spider web of sticky foam stuck to the glass.  The aroma is quite possibly the best part of this beer. WOW is it beautiful. It literally smells like some high quality potent cannibus. That's the best way I can put it. I absolutely love this smell. I also can pick up a light caramel sweet malt in the backbone. But the hops dominate the aroma.  The taste is almost the same as the smell. Very nice hoppy taste with a nice bitterness. It says 93ish IBU's but its actually very smooth. The sweetness of the malt balances it out very nicely. I also just drank an IPA with 113 IBU's so it probably makes the bitterness on this taste alot milder. Has almost a slightly sweet orange aftertaste. This beer is awesome. I love the complexity of this beer. I would recommend drinking it fresh as I am right now. I would believe that the hops fade after some aging.  Mouthfeel is right on. Perfect carbonation. Medium moutfeel. Smooth and slightly creamy. Delicious.  Drinkability is perfect. I could drink this all night. I would be hammered because of the 7.5% ABV but it's just so easy to drink. This is a great beer for someone who wants to drink a high quality hoppy brew that doesn't tear your palate apart from bitterness. Yes it has high IBU's but the balance and taste of this beer makes the bitterness very mild IMO. Damn it I wish this was easier to get. I would buy a ton of this if it was available. The price is right on it too. I've spent alot more on beers that weren't even close to the smell, taste, and overall drink of this brew!

694,15881,Beergeeknut,4.62,Appearance: Pours a clear orang amber with about one finger of frothy head that stays around rather well.  Aroma: A huricane force of floral and citrus hop aroma. Incredible notes of caramel malts with a slight bready dryness as it enters the nostrils. Oh this monster also carries a massive of hoppy aroma in case I forget to mention.  Taste: Is it a double i.p.a in disguise. Or maybe a sleeping giant that has been awakend and it's angry. The mouthfeel is crisp with a little bit of a dry finish so wonderful. The citrus and floral hoppiness attack the pallate with brutal force. Hints of caramel malts way in the background but those malts get to go for and endless swim in the hops.  Notes: Upon opening this beer I expected a nice balanced beer. I am so glad to be wrong about that. I also did not know what I got myself into. This is a stunning brew a snarling beast of a beer.

Head dissipated quickly to leave some gorgeous lacing.  Aroma is banging. Boom! Citrus, piney hops with a sweet malt backside. This is the freshest I've had a hoppy beer and it doesn't disappoint.  Taste is balanced. It's surprisingly not overly bitter as the malt comes in nicely, but the hops rule the flavor profile. Grapefruity, piney, sweet. Good stuffs. Bitterness lingers in the aftertaste but not for long.  Mouthfeel is average. I don't know, nothing really stands out here. Carbonation is there, but doesn't leave an impression.

694,15881,cavedave,4.62,"Finally reviewing this. This beer is one needs to be consumed fresh. This is the freshest bottle I've ever had.  A moderate pour fills the chalice with a dark amber brew, clear and shimmery, with a one finger light beige head that settles to a ring and islands. The look of it is of a gem which ought be mounted on gold for a giant's pleasure.  The smell is of fresh citrus, with rind squeezes, pine, and a wonderful neutral grainy sweetness. Subsequent sniffs reveal a light breadiness and an earthy bitter note in the background of it all. Wooah, what a bouquet!  The taste is magnificent. Very full flavored, but not hammers-carrying-blowtorches full flavored. Full of zesty citrus, fresh pine, carried on a bed of light malty notes, not caramel or toffee, or even bread exactly, not yeasty, but a wonderful just slightly sweet balance that ushers the sip into a clean, earthy, citrus and bitter finish that is just dry enough, just juicy enough, and cleeean! I could compare this to some IPA's, or even Cascazilla (or others in this ""style"") but what's the point. It is a magnificently balanced blast of clean wonderful flavor (perhaps I should have left it at that).  Mouthfeel is that of a fine IPA, resinous, clingy, low carb., and it has a finish that is one of the finest I have had in any style, let alone amber ale style. Doubt there could be better in this style. Hope to try one. Doubt it.  Drinkability is off the charts. Seriously. If I had a case of these, prudence would lead me to have the alcohol overdose ward on speed dial.

Smell is great, pine and grapefruit hops right up front screaming ""drink me!"".  Hops galore; pine, grapefruit, citrus, floral, some tropical and lots of fruitiness in general. Strong caramel/biscuity malt as well that comes through really nice in the finish. Pretty bitter but really, really tasty and drinkable.  This is so smooth and drinkable it's ridiculous. Barely any off-feels, lowish carbonation, when going down your throat it feels as smooth as juice. To put it lightly I am blown away. I've never come across a beer this smooth and easily drinkable. And at $6/bomber it's basically highway robbery. I'd love to try this on tap sometime.

The reddish tint almost seems to glow like a halo.  S - Grapefruit, hops!!!!, floral, some spices. So very nice. I felt like I was skipping through a meadow smelling all the flowers and the clouds were raining fresh hops down upon me.  T - Hops, I love it. With the first sip I fell in love with this beer. The bitterness of the grapefruit balanced out by a light sweetness. I love amber ale's. This is my favorite so far. The malts work so well with the hops... It's like they are soul mates.  M - Medium body, medium carbonation. As with all the greatest beers of each style - so well balanced. Everything works so well together. Smooth as my package after I've taken the Con Air to it.

Beautiful ruby color with an orangeish tint. Head is a creamy off-white. Lacing coats okay.  Wow, smells so hoppy, which makes me very hoppy. After I get over the hop bomb that is the nose, I smell grapefruit, mango, citrus, apricot, peach (a lot of fruit). There is some malt, but it knows its place for sure.  Tastes so smooth. Hops come forward, citrus, spice, caramel, this is the perfect bitterness in a beer. Finishes malty and bitter. Just lingers on the tongue. This beer tastes like a forest should taste.

694,15881,mbudner,4.65,"Bottled on 1/7/10 (less than a week ago). Poured into a pint glass.  A- Pours a deep orange with reddish hues. Simply put, it's an ""amber."" Head is a bit small compared to what I was expecting, but it leaves some solid lacing.  S- The aroma is piney, but not overwhelmingly so due to the obviously present malt backbone. It is much sweeter than I expected/remembered from the one previous time I had this beer last year. The piney-ness leads me to believe that it will be quite sticky, but only time will tell.  T- A very resinous, piney flavor quickly overtaken by the sweet malts. The malt isn't the bready/bisuity variety often paired with piney IPAs (granted this isn't an IPA, but it does share many of the characteristics of an IPA,) but more like caramel malts. I do get some fruity or floral hops in the finish as well (possibly a combination of the pine and caramel or a new flavor altogether.) Maybe some juicy fruit bubblegum as well? I can't tell if it's the NN or the Hopslam that I keep tasting when I burp.  M- Very sticky (my prediction above was correct.) I can feel the resinous, slick hop oils on my lips and coating every mm of my mouth.  D- Very easy drinking.

Crystalline - crisp and drawing the light in to create a honey glow... burnt umber, golden, ruby - all ranges of browns and oranges depending on the light and viewing angle. 2 fingers of foam tightly defined on top in a cream colored cap. A consistent and foamy lace recedes into the glass after each sip.  grapefruit, lime and sourdough bread - three associative words that spring to mind on the first sniff. copperish metallic quicksilver highlights that almost sting the nether regions of my nostrils. But in the next sniff I pick up only soothing, salty play-doh. It's playing games with me. Super smooth and long lasting in the nose. Builds steam - a potent mix of dry yeasty bread and piney hop. The result is something exotic on the nostrils - like rotting mangoes one minute and soy sauce -topped tuna the next. This is the true allure of NN. The aroma is complex and out of this world, regardless of style. When taken into style context, it is world class. one of a kind.  Seems a little young on the tongue... hop is dominant from front to back. ""Not that there's anything wrong with that"". Lots of sourdough bread in the middle of the tongue, yeasty and a bit hot, evolves into a slightly tart, grapefruit-like crest. Medium body grows slightly chewy as carbonation spreads the beer to reach all crevices. In the finish the more subtle citric hoppiness is swallowed by some intense pine and earth. Bitterness swells, creating a nice pucker.. feels like raw hop oils pooling in the throat. The plentiful carbonation is required in order to keep the resinous hop moving along. Minutes after I'm done my mouth is still coated with vegetal bitterness. yum.

T: The hops are very potent providing a bitter pininess in the foreground and hints of citrus in the background. Very well balanced between bitterness and sweetness.

My next sip leaves me enjoying some nice piney hops. There is a nice bitterness to this beer as well. Backing up the wonderful hop showcase is a caramel/bread-like malt backbone. This one was interesting, as I usually can pick out which way the malt characteristics are leaning.  M: The mouthfeel that this beer has is incredible! It's perfectly carbonated to let the hop flavors dance on your palate, and it leaves a desireable amount of hop oils in the mouth post-swallow.  D: This is a phenominal beer.

This is my favorite offering from Troegs and I buy a lot each year, part of me wishes this was year round but I like the fact that its a bit of a special treat.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Minotaur,4.04,"** Edit 12/29/10**  I just had my first NN of 2010. I will say I still think it is a well crafted beer, but this year there seems to be a much more pronounced hop-forward flavor. There doesn't seem to be quite the layer of complexity without the sweet-savory malt content. It is still a great beer, but there is a noticeable difference IMO.  There isn't much more to say about this beer that has not already stated.  I will add that as a person who generally does not drink overly hoppy beers - despite the level of hops present - this is an amazingly smooth, flavorful and rich drinking experience.  The molasses like malt flavor balances out the hops to create a blend that - while not my usual style of beer - I can only describe as near perfect. The tangerine-grape fruit flavors ride on the sweetness like carefully implemented spice in lieu of a dominating flavor.  I have had this with both spiced foods such as Gumbo and Curry to dessert and it has not yet failed.  There are nearly no other beers that I have tried that I believe meet this variety of balanced variety in terms of the types of flavors evoked in every sip.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,donniecuffs,4.72,"Poured a reddish amber into an American pint glass, with two fingers of bright white head, and fantastic lacing. The smell..wow...pink grapefruit, lemon, pineapple, caramel, maltiness, and bitterness. Sounds like standard fare for some ipa's/ambers/etc, but the combination had my mouth watering. The taste initially hits you with all of the aforementioned citrus, then blends beautifully mid-palate with the malt and caramel flavor, and then finally climaxes at a bitter dry finish that leaves you thirsting for your next sip. Decently carbonated and a thicker body (almost syrupy) than expected, but it blends surprisingly well with the flavor profile so you don't even notice. So much so that you can probably slug back a bunch of these...of course before the alcohol hits you.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

694,15881,ommegangpbr,4.2,"Been looking forward to this for quite some time. Though I tend not to care for amber ales I have enjoyed most of what I've had from Troegs. Pours pretty enough; expected, bright red/amber colors with a well developed head and lacing. Scents are punchy and hoppy though maybe not quite as hoppy as I was anticipating given reviews. Flavors- I still taste some of the flavors I tend not to like in amber ales but the volume on the attributes I find pleasing is turned up high enough that I can ignore them for the most part. Both tea and hops bitterness is present. A flash here and there of a stale malt flavor that I associate with amber ales but the malts are mostly smooth, accented by the hop flavors. While I would prefer a double IPA over this most of the time I do have to chime in with a recommendation for this beer.

Sticky webs of lacing with lines showing the levels where the beer once rested before each sip.  S: Citrus both sweet and tart upfront, and pine mixed with slight grain.  T: Hops! The whole tongue gets a treat from sweet, bitter and hint of funky hops. This finish is so smooth you almost forget the taste and dive in for another quaff. This beer is balanced for the IBUs and ABV! Make no mistake this is a hop bomb drink it fresh.  M: I am a little let down that this one doesn't come off a bit thicker. Amber Ales to me should have a bit more body. The thinner brew does help the hops pop, but doesn't help me from drinking this bad boy oh too fast.  D: I don't know how to say this... My desert island brew! She warms my belly but I can drink it in the heat. If ever a brew deserved to make it to bombers this is it.

694,15881,Mistofminn,4.1,"Got this bottle in a trade with jstassi. Thanks Joey!  Poured into a pint glass, this is a hazy red amber color with a nice light tan head with great retention. Leaves a lot of lacing all over the glass, leaving rings where the former levels of the beer was.  The nose is much more malty than I would have imagined. Granted, this probably isn't a fresh bottle, so I'll adjust my review accordingly. Fruity and juicy malts come out with great complexity. There is a very light fruity bitterness that also melds well with the malty fruitiness. Pretty good stuff considering the freshness factor.  While the nose is considerably more hoppy than malty, I was a little surprised to find that the taste was much more malty than hoppy. Again, complex malty fruitiness comes out and blends nicely with a subtle hoppy bitterness. Again, pretty good considering the freshness of the bottle. Leaves a nice lingering bitter aftertaste.  Mouthfeel is light to medium, with a slow laboring carbonation and a feathery mouthfeel. Definitely enjoying this one. Drinkability is good too. For being slightly higher than normal in the ABV department, this is a very easy drinking and enjoyable brew.  I haven't been disappointed with Troegs yet, and I'm beginning to think I never will be. They may not be the best brewery in the world, but they are putting out some very solid all around brews.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

A nice balance of malt with the hoppiness. Bitterness is evident and in the forefront, but not overwhelming.

S - Strong citrusy grapefruity aroma mixed with fresh pine, some mango and pineapple too. All hops in the aroma here.  T - Pine and grapefruit up front.

The ale has a very fresh, citrusy hop smell. The added hops impart a fragrant aroma on the beer. The mix of hops give this ale an almost sweet taste. After the sweetness, the hops give a citrusy flavor that is not as overpowering as the stronger DIPA cousin. The ale sits so well on the palate that one does not realize the hop presence.

694,15881,BitterBrian,4.85,"Had this from the Hand Pump at Ortino's north Side. My friends always rave about Nugget Necatar , but I don't think I had it before. Anyway, it was on hand pump, so we made a night out of it.  Pured an orange/amber with thick 2 inch head - unusual for cask. Head was very sticky and left heavy lacing.  Smell was of pine, soap and citrus, Taste was divine.  This is where the cask comes in, because the mouthfeel and taste were intertwined. this was hands down the smoothest over-hopped amber I have ever had. Not too carbonated, not flat, but more of like a deliciously hopped amber ale wrapped in velvet and delivered to the tongue. I'd probably drink this all the time if always available.  Highly drinkable. Delicious. Hard to beat. I'd take it over a two-hearted any day, that is saying something.  Note to self: need handpump at home.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Pours a dirty copper with just a touch of cloudiness. A nice one finger, off white head subsides rather quickly leaving a standing crown on top of the beer.  Smells eatery, almost of light, sweet stone fruit and a hint of citrus. This beer smells awesome!  Taste is not at all what I expected from the nose. Mild malts up front quickly followed by some piney hops and it's quite bready throughout. This beer really is a treat!  Mouth is medium with light carbonation.

694,15881,infi,4.57,"22 oz. bomber, courtesy of BA r0nyn.  Poured into a nonic pint.  Pours a ridiculous hazy and dark red-orange color that hardly allows any light to pass through and forms an thick off-white head of fine bubbles that sizes up to about one finger. Lacing is incredible. From top to bottom, lots of stringy spider webs are forming on the inner linings of my glass. First time I've seen such lacing from an amber ale. Very, very impressive. Upon cracking open the bottle, I immediately smelled SNPA, one of my all-time faves. It must have been the sudden odor of hops and citrus emerging from the bottle. Once that happened, I already knew this was going to be a tasty ale. There's a good earthy quality to the floral backbone of this aroma. Piney and resiny hops, fresh grapefruit and subtle malt are predominant on the nose. This scent is too potently good to let go of.  Taste definitely meets up to expectations. Perfect balance of hops and malt. Flavor profile begins with a slight floral hop bitterness up front, which leads into malt sweetness and ends on a fresh citrus note and subtle hop bitterness that lingers for a couple of seconds then dissipates in the mouth. Excellent the whole way through. It has a medium-bodied mouthfeel with very little palpable carbonation on the tongue. Not as crisp and dry as a pale ale in the aftertaste. It goes down very smoothly and easily. Drinkability is off the charts. 6/5 for sure. Usually, I like to take my time in tasting my brews, but this was too enticingly good to let sit. For some reason, this really made me think it was SNPA. Good to know that there's another sessionable ale worth having.  Kudos to Troëgs for such a fantastic beer.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Very strong ""C"" hop aroma, with light citrus, pine, and some otherwise tea-like notes. Biscuity malt in the taste, backed up by loads of fruity, bittering hops. Actually, the bittering is a bit too strong. No real yeast character, unfortunately. Full bodied, but slightly syrupy.

It pours into an entrancing burnt orange/caramel color that looks just great. Has a decent-sized head that dissipates gradually. The smell is phenomenal. I definitely caught some citrus and mango along with the maltiness. I almost thought I was smelling some sort of fruit cocktail, to be honest.  The initial sip has a blast of bitterness that coats the tongue with the kick of roasted hops. This resolves into the citrus-y fruitiness of the smell to create an evenness between the malt and the bitterness. The finish is lingeringly bitter. Not too much carbonation going on in the mouthfeel; it's silky smooth. Not too heavy, not too light on the body; makes for easy drinking.  Before I knew it, my mug was down to almost nothing. With a good balance of hops and malts, a great look and smell and a pleasant feel, this is one of the easiest beers I've ever had to drink. You definitely don't feel the 7.5% ABV that it carries.

694,15881,Kegatron,4.6,"22 oz bottle into a pint glass. From the brand new summer batch that was released @ the brewery on 8/25/09. I've actually reviewed this beer 3 times now, and this is the first time out of the bottle.  Pours an absolute brilliant clear copper, with 2+ huge foamy fingers of eggshell-white colored head. Near finger of foamy froth hangs tough, just drenching the sides with rich lace that hangs in thick swathes down the sides of the glass. The aroma is basically just a HUGE blast of hops in the face! Flowers, herbs, spice, pine, pretty much any kind of hop accents that you could ask for. A robust tang of pineapples, oranges, mangos, and toasted grains add a certain amount of stickiness to the this hoppy bouquet. Man, does this pop in the nose though!  The hops in the taste are bitter, spicy, and sticky, yet drying. Herbal qualities and a rich and sweet tangy blast of tropical fruits guarantee that there is no lack of hop flavors here. An undercurrent of toasted malts give this a grainy texture in the back, which gives the hops something to nicely lean on. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a sharpness to the carbonation that runs the whole way through, yet this stays just so silky and easy feeling in the mouth. Just an effortless body here, and I would never guess in a million years that this was an nearly 8% beer.  I don't know if I was just extra fired up to be drinking a fresh bottle of this in the summer or what, but I'll be damned if this wasn't probably my best experience with this beer in the bottle. The flavors just POPPED so much here and I can't remember the body on this ever being so ridiculously smooth.

This beer smells a bit less intense than I thought. I can detect some mild piney hop aroma. A subtle caramel aroma also mixes in. Some citrus aroma also.  This beer tastes like it smells. It is a lot less intense than I thought. Mild pine and citrus flavors mix in with a slightly sweet caramel like aftertaste.  This beer is carbonated well. It leaves a slightly piney aftertaste. It is a little syrup like in mouthfeel though, thicker than I would think.  This beer would make a decent session beer. The alcohol content is a bit high, but it is not too much so. Also, the flavor isnto too aggressive or bad to drink.  Overall: Thanks go to monsterfat for this beer. It was part of the 2009 Great BIF race. Rating this beer is a bit harder than I expected. It isnt a bad beer, but it was far from what I was expecting. The bottle said ""A Hopheads Nirvana"" I can not agree with that. This beer is not very hoppy at all.

Poured from firkin on the bar into a NN standard pint glass (free glass too, cool).  A: A medium orange color with a 2 finger fluffy billowy white head. Pretty full glass lacing.  S: Ah, the smell of fresh NN in August is sublime. Huge citrus and pine hop notes with that nice full sweet caramel malt.  T: Sweet citrus flavors up front with huge pine notes mixed in. The hops hit first but the heavy caramel malt sweetness really keeps them held down. Some light floral hop notes as well. The mid taste is pretty much the sweeter caramel malt flavors but mixed with a sweet tropical fruit flavor. The finish is where the hops really shine here as some bitterness sets in. This cask version is so much smoother and less prickly than the tap or bottle. The hops are much more subdued in the flavor and the sweetness really blends almost perfectly with the hops. Creamy smooth, awesome.  M: Creamy smooth, full and coating. No alcohol and slight bitterness on the finish. The sweetness lingers with just a hint of hops.  D: Need I even say this? From cask/firkin it was the ultimate in drinkability.  Overall what a treat to be able to enjoy this fresh from the brewery firkin. Thank you Troegs.

Not exactly your average amber ale.  S: Floral, twangy, and bitter hops dominate the nose. Just a bombardment of different types or aromas. A hophead heaven. A little citrus and a decent malt base provide a great balance for the hops. Also as it warms, there becomes a sweet caramel note that seems to linger.  T: Perfectly balanced flavors. A floral bouquet of hops (wide variety), the bottle says Warrior (my fav), Tomahawk, and Nugget. Firm malt base that really keeps the hop bitterness from running out of control. Just a simple recipe with amazing hops.  MF/D: Thick body for an amber ale, strong and long floral hop finish, PERFECT balance, amazing, finishes a little dry.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,davexisxrabid,4.47,Got this as an extra with 6DaysBottomOcean. Thanks!  Poured a hazy amber color into my pint glass. One finger thick white head with decent retention. Moderate lacing during the drinking period.  Aroma was odd but pleasant; baked cookies with brown sugar with a strong piney hop note. Trippy!  Very balanced flavor. Nice and sweet at first but not too malty with a hop kick at the end that wasn't overpowering or too bitter.  Full bodied with a light lingering flavor. The abundant carbonation help carry the flavors.  Very good drinkability I would say. Good flavor and clean on the palate; won't wreck your taste buds for a nice meal. Glad I got to try it!,Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,ralree,3.88,"A: Cloudy amber with a white head. Incredible lacing, good retention. Full finger head.  S: Barley, lots of hops, brown sugar, caramel, very sweet. Cross between apricot and grapefruit.  T: Hops and tangy fruit come through immediately, with a strong barley flavor backing them up. Alcohol detectable, but not invasive. Very sweet and fruity. Hops are bitter enough to give it lots of bite, but the sweetness tones it down. Definitely more apricot flavor than grapefruit. Could be a little tangier. A tiny bit of metallic taste comes out after swallowing. Taste is a little watered down...  M: Chewy, thick, heavy body, a little syrupy. A little astringent. Carbonation good.  D: Overall, good ale. Goes down easy, but its a little hard to drink a lot of. Will possibly buy again.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,SykDoc,4.42,"I got this courtesy of brewdlyhooked13, much thanks. Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. It pours a very nice amber color with a 1/4 inch very light tan head that reduces to a very nice lacing. No sediment and definitely noticeable carbonation.  The aroma includes a nice level of citrusy hops up front. As the beer warms, a sweeter caramel note becomes present. A mild earthy component is noted.  The taste is again quite good with a nice level of piney hops up front, then a more caramel sweet malts and a grapefruit finish.  The mouthfeel is highlighted by a good level carbonation that accents the flavor well. It is medium bodied. A pleasant dry/sweet sensation is left over at the finish.  Overall, this is a unique but very tasty beer. I was a little surprised when I initially tasted it but as I sit with it longer, it is very good. I hope to get my hands on it again in the future.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Would have drank more but it was my buddy's last one.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,mrkrispy,4.01,"Got a fresh bottle.  Poured a vibrant orange, stunning clarity. Small head, stuck around for a while.  Aroma has a very interesting hop bouquet, mixed with a bit of sugar. Almost smells like a wet hop beer...bit grassy...but some citrus hops too. Nice.  Beer has a full body, almost a little off-putting at first maybe because it was unexpected. Very nice hop flavor, fairly bitter but some sweetness lingering around. Vanilla, mild sweetness of fruit juice but I can't place what kind....orange? Hint of lemon. Still sweet. Still sweet. Odd.  A very interesting beer, excellent hop character. Not real fond of the sweet aftertaste, but the rest of the beer is great.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,alleykatking,3.98,Got in a trade with kmurray8621...thanks again for everything Kevin.  A- Pours a deep and hazy copper amber color. Good 2 finger darker mocha/tan color head. Nice lacing on the sides that sticks around for the entire beer.  S- Nice piney hops upfront with the aroma. Grassy smell mixes along with a sweeter caramel malt backbone. I detect citrus hops in here as well. I think this beer might be a little cold because I have trouble detecting a lot without having to stick my nose almost in my beer.  T- Sweeter taste right from the get go. Citrus and piney hops come through at first followed by a caramel sweet malt middle. The ending is a crisp bitter hoppy taste. Nice tasting beer that is balanced for the most part. I wish there was a little more hop presence in the middle of the beer.  M- Medium-light mouthfeel to this. Carbonation is good and helps the beer move around smoothly on the palate. Nice oily resin of citrus hops left on the tounge balancing a sweeter malt taste as well.  D- This is a very drinkable beer that I would suggest to anyone who wants to try the style out. I would love to get my hands on this more often and can't wait to finish the last couple bottles of it in my fridge.,Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

It took quite some time to find it, due to it always being on backorder and sold out almost immedietley. Truely worth the wait.  : Served out of a bottle into a pint glass it had a beautiful coppertone color. It smelling of citrus and pine...not typical of the style IMO. It tasted similar to the smell with a sort of pineapple after-taste. Delicious. The mouthfeel was decent, a bit watery from what im used to but it was fine. Very, very drinkable but the alcohol content will get you quick.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Soonami,4.92,"I bought a case as soon as it was released earlier this spring. I think there is probably still some leftovers around in the area. This review is from notes of the first bottle I had of the year served at the perfect 50F temperature.  This beer is easily one of my favorites. Though I will admit that fresh is much better than the older, but still great specimens. The beer is the perfect rust amber that I like in a hoppy/amber beer. The sustain and cling of the head is fantastic and leaves nothing to be wanted. The aroma was perfect mix of bready cereal and fruity, piney hops. And all of this was before tasting the beer, which was full of juicy grapefruit, earthy-biscuity malt, and bitter hops. This is a beer that will impress anyone that is even remotely interested in having a good beer. This is the one beer that I would choose if I could only have one for the rest of my life. All of the flavors from the ingredients mix impeccably, it looks great and smells like everything I like in beer.  Most highly recommended.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,kmoore149,5,"One of the best beers for hop heads. I love everything about this beer; aroma, taste, drinkability, and even got a nice kick at 7.5%, and since these go down very smooth with a bit of sweetness to them, it is easy to knock off a few. Being a seasonal makes it even better as you need to wait for it, usually showing up in early February, and is gone by late March. Well done Troegs!  Overall a fantasic beer. Possibly the best in America.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Head stuck around for a while and left great lacing on the glass til the end.  Hoppy aroma, a bit of citrus and spice, but not overwhelming as expected.  Taste is surprisingly balanced, a bit hoppy up front with a nice malt backbone making it quite drinkable.  Medium carbonation, medium body.  Very drinkable, despite its ABV.

The nose is filled with citrusy hop aroma and the taste follows accordingly. Though this beer is filled with hop aroma and taste it's not overly bitter at all, in fact it's rather sweet.

Tastes of more citrusy and oily hops which are wrapped with lemon, some banana and other fruits, and some malts. Goes down silky, despite the overall bitter nature it has.

Pineapple and citrus. Bready malts.  Taste: At first this reminded me a lot like Surly 16 Grit, which is amazing, but I like this one more. Earthy hops and very bready. Honey. A little bit of citrus. A very great tasting beer.  Mouthfeel:A little bitter. But I can tell it has aged a bit. Medium bodied. Carbonation is good for this type of beer. Leaves a very dry aftertaste.

Head is snowy white and laces the glass on the way down.  Smell is exceptional, all kinds of citrus in the nose. There is no hint of being overwhelmed with hops, just an anticipation of what's to come.  Mouthfeel is great, there's a body there that lets you know the malts are used properly to offset the hops. Citrus and pine flavors are there. Very little bitter aftertaste which is surprising given the hops.  The beer is not overcarbonated, it's smooth and stays true to the end of the glass.

There is a one finger white lace with a little carbonation activity after the pour. Little to no cling after the pour.  S- Strong hop presence with a citrus mixture of orange and grapefruit.  T- Nice hop flavor that is followed by a citrus note. A little bitter throughout but nothing overwhelming. The strong alcohol flavor has been masked very well be the hoppy citrus notes.

694,15881,mynie,4.5,"Released a few months ago, and while I've heard that this, like Hopslam, is much better fresh, I'm wiling to judge it as an aged brewed.  But, man, it don't look aged (and in my head I'm pronouncing the term fancy like, age-ed). Bit on the light side for an APA--but, hey, this is an imperial amber! My mistake. It's awfully pale for an amber, too, but it's not at all unappealing, just the right amount of haze, large head.  Sure as hell don't smell like it's aged too much. Heavy, hearty, green hops and doughy yeast. Not picking up any of the earthiness or sweet cereal nodes I usually associate with an amber or red, but the yeast done a great job of balancing out the hops.  Tastes like a large, varied, and well composed blend of high alpha hops (surprise surprise). Some nodes are more traditional--grapefruit, generic citrus, pine, but there's something to this blend. Warrior hops produce the exact same aftertaste as Alpha King, Simcoe gives it the same explosive start as 60 min... but still, there's something else, something fantastic that I can't put my finger on. Maybe it's that the malt is so subdued, that the beer lets the yeast do the balancing so the hops can frolic freely. I dunno. It's damned amazing, though.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,popery,4.57,"Excellent hopped-up amber. I generally like an aggressively hopped amber, and this is a good version of that subdivision of the nebulous style. I wish that I had a Green Flash Hop Head Red on hand to taste against this beer because it's a similarly hop forward amber and, well, it's a good beer. I suspect that Nugget Nectar would come out on top. It's really an excellent beer.  The beer is a clear amber liquid with a frothy head. If it wasn't labeled as an ""Imperial Amber,"" I'd probably just guess it was a DIPA, as I have seen DIPAs darker than this. The aroma is a lovely blend of hops. I suspect that Simcoe found its way into the mix. Every hoppy beer brewer should consider Simcoe in their recipes. Anyway, the aroma is floral/citric hops, like honeysuckle and grapefruit rind. The flavor is similar but adds in a nice sweet malt that keeps the beer away from over-bitterness. The feel is clean with a good bitter bite in the aftertaste. For my money, this is an exceptionally drinkable beer. It tastes great, there's complexity in the hops to make you want more and it doesn't overwhelm in any capacity. One of the best hoppy East coast beers that I've tried so far (Double Simcoe being the other that comes to mind). Also, it paired excellently with a DiGiornio Mushroom and Spinach pizza, so yeah, my beer was significantly better than my dinner.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,StarlightSeraph,3.86,"Poured from a 22 oz bomber into my Duvel tulip.  Appearance: Pours a crystal clear golden-orange (more orange than gold), with lots and lots of bubbles and two fingers of slowly dissipating frothy white head. Incredibly thick lacing. Beautiful looking beer.  Smell: This baby's intense. As soon as I poured, notes of pine and honey began to fill the room. Very bready and grassy smelling as well - a good balance of hops and malt.  Taste: A grassy bitterness, backed by bready/honey malt sweetness. The initial bitter bite fades quickly, but there's a lingering bitter aftertaste. Considering how strong the smell is, however, the flavors are somewhat mild. I have to remind myself that this is an amber, and it's not supposed to be an IPA.  Mouthfeel: Pretty thin, which might be why I think the flavors are a little muted. Might be a tad undercarbonated as well, but again, as this is classified as an amber, they are supposed to be smooth and easy drinking, and not thick and chewy.  Drinkability: A very easy drinking beer. A nice attempt at a compromise between an IPA and an amber ale. I'm not sure if I'm a fan of the hybrid style though - it's close enough to a DIPA that I want the real thing. That being said, I did enjoy the beer, and I would have it again - but I probably wouldn't go to great lengths to seek it out.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,alphanon,3.94,"The appearance of this when poured was really on the low end of amber really quite pale. The nose was nothing but hops, some floral maybe a little nutty note. The flavor, although quite good was more like an IPA then an Amber, I expected more of a malt backbone to balance out this beer, instead I got an IPA.

I've never had a pint pour maintain such a nice coat of lacing through the entire sipping experience, especially an amber ale. Sweet malts and floral hops dominate the nose. Sweet malt, tart yeast and a residual but present hoppiness blend together very well for a tasty experience. This is much more bold than I'm accustomed with an amber ale. The feel of the brew is its only downside. It was somewhat watery, in which the carbonation more resembled that of a nitro-tap. Still, said carbonation is likely what likely produced such a wonderful creamy head/lace. Very drinkable, very well-balanced.

The nose contains notes of candied pineapple, deep earthiness, candied grapefruit.  Tastes like caramel, candied pineapple, pine, oranges and fresh pear. YUM TOWN! On the whole, it is more sweet than bitter, but a sharp, bitter edge is always present.  It has a full, creamy body; nice carbonation.  I have nothing bad to say about this beer.

694,15881,mmmdonuts12000,4.57,"I'd heard a lot of good things about this beer and was really excited to try it.  I had a 22oz. bottle poured into a pint glass.  Color was an appetizing clear orange/amber with a nice head that dissipated rather quickly. This did not in any way detract from my enjoyment of it.  I was blown away by the hop aroma. I detected subtle caramel and malt aromas, as well. Simply put, it smells delicious and way more complex than I'm letting on with this brief description.  I was hoping that the flavor would live up to what the aroma promised, and It did. Sweet malt and caramel-like flavors compliment the hops beautifully. This brew would be great with many a meal. This brew would be great FOR many a meal...  The moderate carbonation lends itself to a very pleasant mouth feel. The sweetness gives an illusion of syrupy thickness that intensifies as it gets warmer. I say ""illusion"" because I actually found it to be quite refreshing and not in any way heavy or sticky. The fact that it has a moderate ABV (compared to a lot of the high powered double IPAs that I usually drink) is a definite plus, too (in that you can have a couple of these and not have them sneak up on you too badly).

694,15881,becktone,3.57,"From notes 4-10-09  Eye: This brew is clear and is pretty much orange in color. Head formation was nice, yet retention could use some work. Formed at about 1.5 fingers then collapsed to a bubbly flim. Lacing left behind is in sheets.  Nose: Hop aroma takes the foreground here, some catty hop aromas, as well as some heavy citrus aromas. Malt aroma is evident, its very strong giving support to hops, caramel and sweet wort aroma are very prevalent. This one almost smells like the wort during the boil as the first hop addition is made. Overall nice aroma, pretty much what can be expected from the ""imperial amber"" label.  Tongue: Hop bitterness and flavor are foreground supported by a very strong malt presence that makes its way through. Caramel and a general malt sweetness give the hops something to compete with. Hop flavor is floral, grassy and earthy. To me it almost seems that there are two specific things going on here, hops and malt. They don't really blend, hop bitterness is huge and it is countered by malt sweetness, one follows the other. They don't happen at the same time. Were the hops absent or the malt absent I think that this would be a poorly crafted beer. As it is I think that the overall blend of hops and malt should be more universal, it could be blended better. There are three single minded aspects to this beer: malt sweetness, hop bitterness, and hop flavor-three different stages of brewing: mashing, hopping the wort and boiling to get concentrated sweetness and hop bitterness, dry hopping. It seems that its all real clear how this beer was crafted....not too much complexity.  Feel and Drinkability:Heavier than should be body with an almost syrupy quality, low carbonation adds to this feel, really this one almost feels if it is under attunated...thick, there are unfermented sugars here that should be fermented. This beer is good, but I think that it could be better, there's some things I'd change about it were I able. Not too sure I like the feel here, a little too heavy, more carbonation would help to lighten it. This is another one of those beers thats reputation is huge, you hear that its completely awesome and blows everything away....then you taste it and find that the only thing that is blown away is this specific beer's reputation. Too much street cred. This is a good beer, don't get me wrong, but I think that now, its riding its own coattails. Not that I won't buy it agian, but when I do I'll know that its not worth $12.99-13.99. Glad I tried it, but really not worth the dollars. Should be cheaper if you ask me, its not all that well crafted....",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,steelerguy,4.44,"A - Nice amber, very clear, with a one finger head, and light carbonation. The head faded quickly leaving just a coating on top, but it still laced the glass as I drank.  S - One of the best smelling beers ever. It smells like they used a lot of late hop additions of a few different kinds. Lots of citrus and pine aroma with floral undertones. Just a great smelling beer.  T - Lots of hop flavor and bitterness but very well balanced with the toasted malt flavors. Nice citrus finish without much sweetness.  M - Dry, crisp beer. Not a lot of sugars left over in there so it is a tad thin. Wish it was a little more carbonated, but could have been the keg my growler was filled from.  D - Lot of IBUs and alcohol don't usually mean very drinkable, but this finishes so crisp it doesn't fill you up. Would like a little more carbonation to make it finish even better.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,originalsin,4.5,"At my local liquor store pickin' up a 6er for the night and magically stumbled upon this Nectar of the Gods. Woe is me... This beer gets an automatic +1 for the label, no question about it. A fist sized hop! Unreal. God knows what I'm getting myself into here. I can't wait  The pour is a beautiful golden amber with a frothy white head and some of that sticky icky lacing all down the sides as it settles. This beer smells complex, honest to god. Malts and hops vying for my attention throughout. I can't help but keep my nose buried in this one. When I'm looking for it, I can smell some caramel malt- then biscuit- then some sweeter malts. Then I adjust and can practically taste all of the hops- citrus, floral, and even some grassy notes. Yowza. First thought upon tasting- Almost the perfect session brew? If it weren't for the drunkability factor with 7.5 abv, I think it'd undoubtedly be the perfect session beer. But hey, some nights I'm looking for that drunkability factor...some afternoons even...ok ok ok some mornings. What a complex taste. That's not all that unbelievable, though. After everything in the nose on this one, it's almost expected. Too many beers out there nowadays just taste gray, with no real discernible flavors. Nugget Nectar is a mix of brown, red, green, yellow...you get the picture. The caramel and biscuit malts are certainly there, but take a back seat to the 3 or 4 separate hop flavors that take their turns on my palate. What can I say about mouthfeel or drinkability that hasn't been said already? Nothing.... So great in those regards.  Nectar of the Gods, I'll certainly be seeing you again sometime soon...and as often as I can after that.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,jwhawkins81,3.75,"Aroma - Very floral hops with some citrus. This is probably the most hops I've ever smelled.  Appearance - Golden red with plenty of carbonation building a decent off-white head that hangs around.  Taste - Hops and more hops with a slight acidic touch. Different than piney hops more floral like the aroma. Bitterness is there too. Tons of flavor and almost none of it beer like, in a good way.  Mouthfeel - Medium thanks to that carbonation  Drinkability - I'm not a hophead, but this was an amazingly interesting beer.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

694,15881,PEBKAC,4.47,"Served at the most recent Chelsea cask event  One of the most satisfying beers I've ever experienced on cask.  Still remembered how faint I felt after trying this at the last cask event, I made it a priority to impose upon some patrons & nudge my way into their booth for this one.  Cask was actually a bit more unsettled then I remember. I think they were tipping it at this point, & I got one of the next to last draws. No matter, just more of what I want. A muddled brown leather color. A heavy quarter-inch ring of meringue head that I wasn't expecting.  Smell at first was solvent-y, but quickly warmed into a macerated glass of stollen, with plenty of extra orange & pit-y zest.  Taste was immensely doughy & packed with crusty loaves & stale cake. Citrus bitterness roamed the background, a bit muddled, but more intertwined then it's straight edged bottle self. A little lactic maybe, filled in with some stale pepper. Finish was a tad leafy, but very grainy & hearty as well.  Drinkability isn't quite as good as it should be just because of my love/hate relationship with cask, but wow, this is better then the bottle. Carbonation is about the same, but I just don't sense the hops that everyone points out. Much more juicy & bittersweet, & delicately peppered, then shudderingly masochistic.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,LordAdmNelson,4.17,"A- Pours a beautiful deep amber/ruby color. Medium head with medium lacing.  S- Smells delicious... big citrusy hops with a sweet, almost molasses-like note lingering behind (carmel?).  T- Not as hoppy as I would have hoped... wait, I take that back. Starts with a nice bready (and some slightly toasted) malt. Moves into a nice blend of citrusy and piney hops. Some sweetness lingers in the background, as in the nose. Definitely one of the better ambers I've had.  M- Creamy. Smooth and medium-light bodied.  D- Loving this one. Definitely a good drink, especially on a hot summer day.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Finkel,4.22,"The label for this puppy is really friggin' sexy in my opinion. Bright orange with a fist-sized hop: labels do not get any more blunt than that.  Poured out, this beer looks a lot like cream soda. It's completely transparent and clear looking with some satisfactory head retention.  The smell of this beer definitely is impactful. Hops, citrus flavors (particularly orange) all burst into your nostrils to create an overall sweet aroma. Other than that, it's really nice smelling and the hop complexity of the beer definitely rubs off on you.  The only real flavor that hits you hard is hop. However, unlike hops in IPAs, which generally can be sharper, the hops in this beer are completely incremental. As I enjoyed each gulp and swooshed it around, I could taste each of the different hops that this beer is loaded with. Additionally, Troegs really perfected the release of flavors with this beer; nothing is nullified from a different flavor and it's possible to really taste each part of the beer.  Although the mouthfeel wasn't anything spectacular and was a bit thin for my liking, it was so delicious that I didn't care.  Overall, I really enjoyed this beer and found myself a new favorite by Troegs. I wish they would make this an all-year round brew though...",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,bulletrain76,4,"12oz bottle from newest release. Appearance: amber with a small white head and some lace. Aroma: Grapefruit, blood orange, light pine or cypress sawdust. Flavor: Hoppy, citrus, fruity, just enough malt sweetness to stand up to the hops. Sweet grainy caramel touch. Palate: Medium bodied with fine bubbles. Overall: Doesn't really have the malt you would expect in an imperial amber, but the massive hops do make it hard to tell. Pretty tasty stuff. Rerate: Cask at Birerria Paradiso. Huge hop nose seemed more expressive than the bottle. Have to give that a boost.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

694,15881,ThreeWiseMen,4.8,"Acquired this in a recent trade with tai4ji2x. Bottled around mid-January, which makes it about four months old. Poured into a pint glass.  Appearance: Clear, orange-amber, body with creamy, frothy, off-white, head. Retention is okay - dies to a soapy ring after a few minutes. Tons and tons of lace with this one. Looks mean.  Smell: Tons of sweet grains. Caramel, pine, toastiness, wood, spice, and then there's the hops! Sweet, herbal, floral, hops with added citrus to boot! Damn!  Taste: Mouthful of toasted bread and grain. Good dosage of caramel and citrus keeps things sweet, but not overly so. Hop bite is mild; nowhere near the listed 93 IBUs. Lots of herbal and floral characters in here. This is super, super smooth! Hops form a sweet, resinous, citrus flavor as well. Simple, but ridiculously tasty and balanced. Best amber I've ever had - hands down!  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied; much lighter than I expected from an ""Imperial Amber"". Carbonation is perfect and makes this one velvety smooth. Sticky, resinous, and a little gritty. Nicely done.  Drinkability: What an awesomely drinkable beer! The best balanced amber I've ever had. Flavor profile isn't too pungent or mild; it's exactly where it needs to be. More of a warm weather beer (perfect right now). I could easily drink this all day long.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

694,15881,Jwale73,4.1,"Thanks to PhiDelt for the opportunity to try this one. 12oz. bottle served in a standard pint glass. Bottled on 01/05/09 indicated on the bottle. Poured a translucent amber with copious tiny bubbles in solution. One inch bright white head sizzled and popped as it slowly receded into a quarter inch consistent cap; thick bands of lacing coated the sides of the glass during the tasting. Nose suggests grapefruit with piney hops hidden in the back. Taste is not as sweet as the nose suggested. Flavors are piny, floral and slightly resinous on a malty backbone with the citrus quality coming across as citric acid astringency. Mouthfeel is between light- and medium-bodied with a consistent background carbonation; a little oily on the tongue, but also a little bit of citric acid burn as the brew hits your mouth and tongue that slowly dissipates as it's swallowed. Awesome brew. This would be a staple if it was available in RI.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

More complex in flavor than I thought it would be. Has some flavors in there that I'm having a hard time coming up with a description for.

M - Rich body and nice malt chewyness to complement the hop aroma and flavor  D - Good drinkability, but not for the hop head searching for a bitter sting, rather a bit more subtle in its hop presentation.

Huge hoppy scent, no malt attributes noticable over the American (cascade?) hops, would have been a great pale ale aroma, but not a red ale. Nice taste, but again, mostly hops with almost none of the maltiness that goes with a good red. Goes down fine, with a huge bitter aftertaste on the tongue that sticks around. Huge drinkability, because I really liked the ale, but I wish it had more red ale attributes; it's pretty much a pale ale, even in color.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,BrianOhio,4.65,"This is my first review so I won't get too deep into the various criteria. I will leave that to experts and will endeavor to refine my review skillz over time.  Purchased a six of this at the recommendation of a friend. I used to be a firm amber drinker, but recently transforming into a hophead. The bottle denoting ""Imperial Amber"" immediately struck my interest.  After a deep amber pour, you are immediately hit with the floral citrus hops that any hophead is looking for. I could inhale it all day. Don't get me wrong, this is not the wondrous assault of a Hopslam to the nose, but it's nice.  Drinkability of this brew is near perfection. The smoothness of an amber coupled with the hoppy bitterness of a DIPA. This beer immediately moves into my top 3, and is nipping at the heels of Hopslam.

Smells like an IPA T: Floral hops taste moving to a bitter aftertaste G: Medium to light in my opinion. D: I really didn't pick up the alcohol taste all that much so I would drink more than 1 in a sitting. Overall, I enjoyed this beer. I had heard it being compared to Bell's Hopslam but I don't really think they are all that close.

Ripe fruit on the tongue, again with the pear, but there's more here. Really vibrant: peach, nectarine, and oddly some perfume quality, followed by a malty punch and back of the mouth bitterness to finish her off.  Multi faceted beer starts a bit thin, rolls thickish and creamy, and finishes bitter clean, but a bit watery.  I'm thankful for the opportunity to drink this.

Excellent big gobs of lacing. Really a nice looking amber.  S: Big smack of dank hops, citrus, earth, pine, ""herbal"" as well. In fact, not a whole lot else, just a big ol' load of hops. Very nice.  T: Big time hops, citrus rind just sticks to my mouth, also a really nice roasted flavor to it too, like a roasty IPA. Caramel malt stands out a lot more in the mouth than in the nose. Quite bitter, but not overwhelming. Lots of good flavors going on. Really reminds me of an IPA, but with a little more of a roasted feel to it. Very nice.  M: A little thinner than I had expected, medium carbonation, nice dry finish, and a hint of alcohol heat.  D: Not too shabby, I'd probably open another bottle if it were available.

Head subsides to mere thin lacing but leaves a nice film on the glass.  S - Wonderful floral hop smell with some sweet candy sugar lemony smell. I had this beer last night and I can still smell it in my nose. Such a great smell.  T&M - Senses are hit immediately with the bouquet of floral hops. The hops are very foreward and prominent but not bitter like an IPA. It's quite amazing. Lemon zest adds some sweetness and it's like drinking a hops iced tea. Incredibly smooth and moderately carbonated to add some crispness. Alcohol becomes a bit slick as it warms but the alcohol taste never becomes all that noticeable.

694,15881,IMincedTheKing,4.69,"So, after enjoying Hopback, reading on the Troegs website that this was based on Hopback, and two reccommendations (one from a random dude at a liqour store which didn't have Nugget Nectar in stock, and one from a guy who worked at another store saying it was one of his favorites), I've got high hopes for this bastard. (My bias has been duly noted, and if I'm let down, I'm totally slamming this thing. Kay?)  Printed on the glass it tells me it was bottled on 2/17/09, and the bright orange label says Imperial Amber Nugget Nectar, 7.5% ABV, and short description on the neck that tells me it's ""93ish I.B.U.'s"". It's also, like all their beers, Handcrafted by the Troegs Brothers. Troegs disappoints me with their lack of gratuitous information (I like big paragraphs hyping the beer!), but the artwork is to die for. The first guy mentioned above described it as a hand holding a hop like a hand grenade, and I see that now (very Green Day), but I just thought it was a hand squeezing a hop. Either way, I love it.  Okay, down to business. The color is burnt orange in the glass with a sticky, bright white head--the color contrast is surprising and alluring. Big soap bubbles comprise the good size head, but it's not over-the-rim large. Very quick to dissipate, though.  The aroma is of earth and oranges. Very floral. Hoppy to its heart, but not in an overpowering way. ""Nectar"" IS a great word to describe it.  That is... that is good, smooth, tangerine (you may WTF? now). For what I thought might easily end up a hopbomb, that was well played. The flavor is extremely resinous and hoppy, sweet citrus taking the lead. The malt is definitely present and there's a mild caramel flavor, but it's riding along like a backseat driver, only hoping to have some influence. But in the end, without much bitterness or astringency, the hops smack the malts in the face and say ""Shut yo' mouth.""  The carbonation is light and smooth. No tingling or prickling, just a good effervescence. Big enough in the mouth to make a beverage out of it, but thin enough to make it go down like water (The ABV? What ABV?).  I crawled across two state lines on hands and knees to get a hold of this, and I slithered my way back before I drank it. Was it worth it? You bet your ass! (And I think I'm gonna go back and get some more very shortly....)",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,taez555,3.89,"This beer pours an amber body with a small white head.  Nose hits you immediately with a huge fresh citrus resin hop smell. There's some light caramel sweetness in the background, but this puppy SCREAMS citrus, grapefruit and resnin.  Taste is medium bodied with an immediate hop slam of a taste. The maltiness of the beer does have a distinct amber/red, sweet tinge too it, unlike some of the other huge caramel hop killers out there, but... almost immediately you're attacked with a bitter citrus hop taste. It's very fresh, and citrusy, and tons of grapefruit peel, lime juice, lime peel, but very encompassing. There's some dry, fireplace brick sort of granite taste in there with the malt. Bitterness is kept right up front and completely dominates over the malt. Although, I must say this isn't a palate killer. Over the top, but not completely. Ends with a long lingering grapefruit bitterness.  Quite an interesting beer. I understand what they're trying to go with, HOPS, HOPS and more HOPS. If that's all you want, this is the beer for you.

694,15881,CHADMC3,4.23,"Pours a deep amber with orange hues giving way to the foamy off white head packed with dense carbonation bubbles and maintaining its retention for quite a few minutes before giving way to a sticky off white lacing.  Big pine and floral hop aroma with notes of citrus to follow. As advertised, this really is a bouquet of hops. The light wood/pine scents become even more pronounced as time passes.  The palate offers a pleasant trifecta of hops with just the right bite, most noticeable are the pine and citrus flavors with compliments of lemon zest or grapefruit and a sweet finish of caramel as the brew warms a bit exposing additional flavor character.  Dry and smooth, great flavor that although its primary characteristics all involve hops, is still not overwhelming to the non-hophead. Medium in body with a noticeable carbonation and just a bit of a kick on the back of the throat.  What a great brew, glad I saved a few for the summer months ahead to enjoy with any variety of foods but instantly seafoods, spicy chicken, and white pasta dishes come to mind. This beer is much more aggressive than your traditional American Amber Ale, primarily in aroma, but perhaps in flavor as well. With that said, the category seems fairly broad in my opinion and this certainly is a winner within it, just perhaps hard to compare to some of its more subdued brethren.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Poured from a 1 pint, 6 oz bottle into a glass in two parts. Beer was an amber to golden color with no haze and no head. Aroma was piney upfront, but there were caramel and vanilla notes to balance the scent. Taste follows what you would expect from the aroma. Pine and citrus notes hit upfront from the hops. This is balanced nicely with the caramel and vanilla notes, with give a nice sweetness. The finish is nice and clean considering how strong the pine flavor of the hops is upfront. The mouthfeel is medium with a nice bite from the sharp carbonation. Drinkability is good as the beer has good flavor and a clean finish. The higher than average ABV could be a problem for having more than a couple though.  Overall, a tasty amber ale.

Consisted of pine, citrus, and lemongrass.  Tasting this was a beer-drinking journey, the variety of hops all showed themselves fully and complimented each other, without making the beer overly hoppy. It had an intriguing hint of sweetness at the end, but the hops gave it a clean, and quenching finish. Flavors consisted of pine, lemongrass, orange rind with some grapefruit, and a nice touch of sweet malt and caramel.  Had a decent amount of carbonation, and although quite richy, felt light and enjoyable on the palette.

694,15881,sgoodship,4.55,"100th review today. Celebrating with this little number that was graciously sent to me by Hophead101. Thank you very much for your kindness Greg.  A: Nice hazy reddish amber. Lighter and more orange toward the bottom with some carbonation bubbles sticking to the bottom of the glass. A frothy, creamy off-white head. The head reduces but sticks around. Lacing is really nice.  S: Lovely. Reminds me of the Hop Slam I had last night. Grapefruit but with a hint of pine. Caramel malt coming through in the background.  T: Wow. I love this beer. Instant piney bite, goes into some grapefruit and caramel sweetness and settles into the finish and aftertaste with a more bready malt but retains the dry bitter hop which keeps the palate wanting more. Just got tastier and tastier as the drink went on. I was sad when it ended. Delicious.  M: Amazingly smooth. Feels slick and buttery as it slips down. Medium light body. Medium carbonation that adds interest without getting in the way. Perfect.  D: Interesting brew. It's an Indian Amber Ale of sorts. I like the balance of malt and it's definitely not sacrificing the hops. I wish more breweries would take Ambers to this very happy place. If I could get this beer easily, I would drink it all of the time. Nuff said.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Very hoppy taste with a malty any citrusy body. Grapefruit and pine also on my palate. Great tasting and almost sets the bar for a great american red amber ale.

Big citrus notes, lemony, pine as well but not as pronounced. A bit of bread on the backbone.  T: Wow! Great variation of what Troegs calls an American Red Ale. More like a nice nitche between an Ipa and a Dipa. Taste was remeniscent of the smell, hoppy without much spice, very little malt presence.  M: Carbonation was nothing special, as I find it quite trivial 90% of the time to even mention it. So long as it is not either missing or overly there I am happy.  D: Well, being that I had 6 or 7 from the tap over the course of 2 hours I'd give it a 5.  Seek this out and try it.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

A nice aroma of hops and when I first tasted the beer, I felt an explosion of hops on my tongue. The aftertaste was like tasting grapefruit and it does not linger.  I loved it and went back to buy another. Its a seasonal beer so I would grab as many as possible.

This was a classic amber ale on steroids. I enjoyed the hop profile up front but I felt that the malts overpowered the beer. I would love to try this one fresh as it has a lot of potential.

694,15881,yeastsipper,4.03,"Received in a trade with WkndatBernardus. Great choice. I lived in Philly for 2 years and never tried this beer. Unbelievable.  Nugget Nectar is a bright reddish orange copper color, almost glowing. Nose is very fruit forward and a lot of malt is evident. Definitely some hops there, but smell is more sweet than bitter. Taste is bitter, with the hops becoming more evident. There is a slight English Breakfast tea flavor that I always find in Red Ales. I tend to find it annoying/overpowering, but I liked the subtlety in this beer. Good balance of citrus and hops.  This is good stuff though I (and I reserve the right to try again) am not sure it ranks up there with the elite. I may have done this beer a disservice, drinking it with friends after a couple of DIPAs, so I may be at fault for not absolutely loving this beer.

S-Fresh, bright citrusy and floral hops with a balancing touch of malt sweetness.  T-Citrus and floral hop goodness comes through strong with the initial taste and continues on strong till the end. A nice underlying malt sweetness balances things out without taking ANYTHING away from the hops.  M-Medium-light body with a sharp, crisp and smooth feel. Good lingering hop bitterness.

I don't care how important you think whatever it is that you're doing is; it isn't as important as drinking this.  Pours a orange amber color with thin cap of white head, leaves a lacing on around the glass.  Smells like piney hops and citrus.  It was refreshing, very crisp and clean taste. Went down smooth.  I've never tasted anything so delicous. My wife was the one who bought it, I told her if she didn't like it I'd drink it for her. She let me have a sip. I quickly drank down my porter and ordered a Nectar. So damn good.  The bartender lady described it to another patron as ""hoppy and bitter."" Bite me bar-tender-lady; you made it taste like you fished it out of the toilet tank.

Very mild malt. Overall really good.  M - Medium body with plenty of carbonation.  D - If I could go in to any store and get this, it would be an all summer long beer. The 7.5 doesn't present a problem at all.  This is a fantastic beer. I really wish I could get it without trading.

I don't know if this is within the rules of reviewing a beer, but it smells like really good pot.  T - The hop is strong, but not overwhelming like some overly assetive IPA. Again, I don't know if this is legal, but it takes like really good pot. Aftertaste is long and bitter, but doesn't leave a metallic feel on your mouth.  M - Medium bodied, but doesn't weigh heavy on the tongue. The carbonation helps and makes it go down easy.  D - Despite is strong flavors and smells it is very drinkable.

694,15881,OldYoda,3.78,"Pours a very nice amber red into my trusty Troeg's US pint glass.( The fact I have a trusty Troeg's pint glass shows I am a huge fanboy). Modest head and lacing.  Smell is pine and hops and that's all I get.  Taste confuses me some - the hops are certainly there and in abundance, but this is well balanced with a strong malt backbone. This is no unbalanced hop bomb - this is really very smooth.  Mouthfeel is mildly heavy and just a bit thin for my taste - I won't call it watery but it approaches that for me. If this beer has a flaw, it's mouthfeel and finish for me.  Drinkability is crazy for a beer with this ABV. You could get yourself in some serious difficulty before you know it with this baby.  All things said, this is a very, very good beer and certainly lives up to it's hype. I don't rate it quite as high as most, but chalk that up to me being overly nitty.

694,15881,michaelgrant1983,4.83,Amazing taste. One of the best seasonal's I have ever had. Wish they had it as a year round brew. I got the beer just to give it a shot as something new that my store started carrying. I was pleasantly surprised by this bohemoth. A must drink for anyone who likes hops. The fact that they serve it in bombers as well is a bonus.,Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,HopHeadRyan,4.57,"Had been wanting to try this one for a while...almost missed the boat this year, as this is seasonal...but I can't figure out why. Still a few places around Philly that have it. This brew would be great any time. Had on-tap and in bottles.  By far one of my favorit PA Craft Beers.  A - orangish/red; quick head; light lacing  S - Intoxicating floral hoppiness w/ citrus fruit (pineapple), pine trees, and carmel maltiness  T - Great! - hoppy w/ light citrus sweet fruit balance; you can taste the complex hop combination; very juicy hop profile; bitter but not ""93ish IBUs"" bitter  M - Medium bodied; crisp finish; lower carbonation  D - Its scary how drinkable it is; again this is a brew that can be enjoyed at any time; and with most food.  I think we should petition Troegs to make this a YEAR ROUND brew!  +++ 2012 Notes: The Nectar this year seems a little less fragrant, a little less flavorful, a little less bitter, and a bit more caramelly sweet and syrupy than years past. Its still delicious, don't get me wrong, but its seems different and not quite as amazing. Perhaps my palate and/or taste has just changed. Not sure I will seek this out with such intent in the future (in bottles). If I see it on tap...I'm sure I'll still get excited though. Cheers! +++ 2013 Notes: Bottled on 12/28 opened on Jan 17 - Fresh hop fragrance - very floral and perfumey this year - a little herbal and piney - and a hint of melon; but not as pungent as I've had it in the past. A definite grainey note, very biscuity/bready; with a slight hint of alcohol. The taste is bursting with juicy hop flavor, resiny and candy-like, makes my mouth water for more. Definite grainy-malt flavors all well blended and nicely balanced. The ibus are well hidden. Beautiful smooth carbonation, and nice head retention and sticky lacing. This brew is a thing of beauty. As long as I live in PA i will continue to track down a case each season! +++ 2014: Beautiful crystal copper-ruby color, Piney and pungent nose with some sweet bready malt a little alcohol some mild herbal minty-ness , juicy and flavorful hops; Super balanced - the malts and hops dance together in an excellent blend of imperial harmony - I look forward to this every year! One of my favorite brews of all time! +++ Get some! Cheers!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,hustlesworth,4.6,"A- shiny clear bright orange-amber with golden yellow highlights. very dense hoppy looking foam is pitted and pock marked and has the yellowish hue of vanilla ice cream. lace is nice and rugged looking, like something from the badlands and eventually forms thick drippy rings. foam settles to a thick creamy disk and stays put.  S- absolutely bursting with hops and all sorts of tropical fruits. orange, nectarine, clementine, meyer lemon, huge grapefruit, pineapple, mango, passion fruit, pine, and the herbal side of rosemary with underlying sandalwood and tobacco, toffee, and toasted grains.  T- a big malt sweetness starts things off, but hop flavor and bitterness moves in almost immediately. there's more hop 'flavor' than actual sharp bitterness, allowing characteristics of each variety to come through, from sour orange, to lemony, to grapefruit, to pine, to road tar. delicious asphalt. fresh, lightly sweet toasted cereal grains bounce around in the background providing a nice harmonic structure. woodsy, toasty. finishes astringent and not overly bitter, but still with great hop flavor.  MF- moderately full, but not quite what i would call 'imperial'. it's plenty hoppy and malty, but seems more like just a big red ale or a toasty ipa. tight medium carbonation breaks through the brew's viscosity so it doesn't sit too heavy. resinous and a little oily, with a slight graininess, you definitely get the feeling of hops in this one.

694,15881,keithricker,4.02,"I'll skip some of the usual observations and cut right to the chase on this one ...  This is a really interesting brew, in that it defies a lot of the usual categories. Is it an amber? Is it an IPA? Is it an imperial IPA? An Imperial Amber Double IPA? This one really straddles the line in terms of style, but I would just call it a strong, ""amberish"" IPA.  It's an interesting dichotomy. Usually, this kind of creamy ""amberish"" flavor undertone comes in a much thicker, cloudier (almost syrupy) package that allows the flavor to linger in the mouth much longer. But this one is crystal clear, with a decidedly lighter, ""draftier"" feel that hits you briefly with the flavor, then fades away quickly while refreshing the palate.  Dare I say that this stuff could almost be chugged down on a hot day. Again, not at all what you'd expect from the flavor.  In summary: Amberish IPA with great hops aroma and flavor ... crystal clear, light-bodied and refreshing like a good draft beer. Compares favorable to Surly Furious, to give an example. Different flavor profile, but still very similar in many ways (to Furious), and if someone told me this were a Surly brew, I'd totally believe it. To those out East who don't have access to Furious, this would be a somewhat close approximation (you'd get the basic idea).  On a final note, I would be interested in trying a variation of this stuff, with a thicker and heavier base. The flavor is really it's strong suit, and it would be neat if it would hang on in the mouth so you could taste it for much longer.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Durge,4.32,"This bottled beauty pours a classic clear copper with a very solid off-white head and good lacing. The aroma is definitely crisp grapefruit, slightly sweet and a bit flowery, just what a hop head likes to smell! The flavor is a beautifully balanced grapefruit with mild caramel toffee. There's a definite bready and yeasty background that settles in nicely as you get through the glassfull, but the flowery grapefruit is the star here and it is wonderfully presented. I could drink this pretty liberally, nicely but reasonably carbonated with a midland feel suited to the style.

Not too impressive, so given its reputation, I blame myself for a bad pour. S: Amazing. As soon as it's poured, you can smell the floral, resinous hops from a foot away. Lightly piney scent gives a good backdrop to the hops. Sweet malt with a light spice goes along. T: Starts off with the floral hops from the scent along with an apricot-fruitiness, but lets up into a sweeter toasted malt profile on the back end of the palate. By the end, the fruitiness develops more of an acidic feel. M/D: The body on this is as full as anything. Damn good.

I'm talking pine tree forest with some grapefruit and a side of citrus. Dare I say, Pine Sol! T: This is where you lose me. Up front, I get a little malty sweetness, but it quickly fades to the grapefruit, grassy biterness on the back of the tongue. Alcohol is hidden well, but I just don't deal well with the lingering bitterness. M: The hops are in full effect, though not overwhelming. Numbs the tongue just a bit, but wears off by the time you are ready for another sip. Nicely carbonated. D: It's not a bad beer. Again, I am not a hop head, but can appreciate a good beer when I try one. This is a good beer.

Sweet malt aroma starts the party, quickly followed by bright citrus (tangerine, pineapple) spicy minty herbs, and smooth piney hops. Wow. The aroma is vivacious and enticing, everything I had hoped.  Deliciously sweet and bitter flavors. Perfectly balanced! The notes from the aroma explode and intensify on the palate. Slight roasted sweet flavor plays nice with all the hops. Can't wait for the next sip. Seriously drinkable, this one lives up to all the hype.

I really think this is a well balanced beer considering the amount of hops in it. Definitely different, in a good way.  Mouthfeel: Very well carbonated.

694,15881,BeerCon5,4.07,"Poured a slightly dark strong amber color with some good white head that left lacing throughout the beer.  There was a good hoppy scent with some citrus.  Good citrusy, hoppy taste with kind of a bitter finish.  Medium-bodied feel with high carbonation, maybe a little too much.  Very good beer, although, I could only drink one or two, they are quite filling.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,PhillyStyle,4.62,"Served on-tap at Birreria Paradiso, Washington DC:  The beer served up a clear amber color with a nice dense white head that was well retained. Solid in appearence, bit not especially so.  The beer gave off an exceptional hoppy aroma that was spot on. Citrus, pine and floral hops all noted. The aroma was really well done and very well balanced.  The flavor was exceptional. All hops but at the same time, not overly hoppy. It had a slight hint of sweetness. The beer had a nice bitter aftertaste, but it was not overpowering, just a nice gentle finish.  The beer was smooth, rich and creamy. The beer had a medium body to it. It was also very, very easy to drink even with the slighly elevated ABV. Overall, this is an outstanding beer, one that all BA's should try.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Pours mandarin-orange amber iwth a luxurious off white head and good lacing. Medium visible carbonation.  Aroma is of fresh pineapple and grapefruit. Like smelling a freshly cut fruit salad. A little lollypop sweetness from the amber malt in there too.  Taste surprisingly retains the amber ale flavor along with the hops which is great. A more intense pineapple flavor from the hops with only medium bitterness but with full hop flavor. The slight bitterness keep things in ""beer perspective"" and distract a bit from the slightly soda like mouthfeel. I've found that to be a continuing problem with Troegs beers. Well made but the texture of the water doesn't remind me of beer. I like that the beer retains a sweet and clean amber flavor on top of the crazy hops. Not just ""imperial"" as in let's make this as alcoholic and hop loaded as possible. Definitely a well throught out beer.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

S- smells a whole lot like guava, with grapefruit as the secondary aroma.  T- Bitter, but very fruity, with guava and grapefruit flavors underpinned by a sweetness that must come from the malt. Swallow is a wash of the fruit flavors, leading out to a more bitter, dry finish.  M- light, crisp, goes down easily. The aftertaste has a hint of the alcohol, but it is mostly behind the hop bitterness. Very crisp, enjoyable, bright beer.  D- pretty high. I wouldn't normally drink more than one 7.5% in a day, but if I had more of these, I would definitely consider it.  Notes- I'm not an ""add more hops"" guy. I actually skipped over buying this in a 6 pack, because I was sure I wouldn't like it, and didn't want a whole bunch of expensive bottles in the fridge, not being enjoyed. When I saw the 22, I was glad to be able to try it, without having to worry about a bunch of leftovers. Then, low and behold, I love this beer. I'm completely surprised.

Served in a North Coast nonic and first sipped after ten minutes out of the fridge.  Pours a golden amber with a short-lasting off-white head. A good amount of lacing looks like it will stick around.  The nose is filled with an awesome bouquet of citrusy, piny, and floral hops, with a light malt balance present. The only thing that keeps me from giving it this part a '5' is the lack of oomph; the nose just seems a bit muted.  The Amber ale drinker's IPA. What an incredibly well-balanced and flavorful beer. What sets it apart is that no one characteristic in any way overpowers the others. It's quite hoppy, but the finish and balance make for a beer unlike any other. A sweet malt presence replaces the hop bitterness on the swallow, leaving the mouth both clean and slightly sweet.  Body is creamy smooth and relatively full-bodied for the style, with carbonation right where it should be. Alcohol warmth is noticeable considering the abv.  If this were available out in California I'd be buying it by the case. This is a fantastic beer.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Honey, lemon, grapefruit(strong smell of this),orange peels, apples, tangerines. This has a very ripe smell of fruits and some floral notes to it. Smells oh so delicious. Smells just like an IPA.  Upfront taste of honey and grapefruit, very sweet citrusy taste that mellows out to a warm biscuity taste and then theres the backbone of that hop bitterness which really does not bite that much.

694,15881,JoBoTo,4.62,"Comes out a really pretty orangish-gold hue. Hints of red. Little head, again, my pouring skills more than likely. Appears to be no lacing. Seems lightly carbonated. The head dissipates quickly.  I know it says Imperial Amber, and I am trying not to judge this as an IPA. The smells gives away the hop flavor in this beer. Sayinng ""skip this step, TASTE ME"" Must be strong. Theres a sweet smell too. A caramel, grapefruity, citrus. But there is something else. A flowery something. I have smelled this on a flower before, but I can't place it. Very appealing to the nose. Only if I could get my wife to put this into a perfume...  Enters mouth, and just hangs out. Don't let it roll back, it will get your uvula/tonsils and try to be drank. Carbonation seems low, as per the appearance. There is low tongue tingle. And seems to coat the tongue in this, layer. The second drink seemed dulled by the current coat. Makes your mouth salivate shortly after drinking. Like the bitterness, good bitterness, sucks your tongue of it moisture, and it need to be replaced, but waits for all that scary beer to be gone, then floods back. Very pleasant sensation.  There is very little flavor on the initial drink. Not a hop slap, or a malt dance. Just a carbonated liquid filling your mouth. There is a mild hop flavor, and you have to play with the beer, letting it hit all the taste areas to get an overall taste. Doesn't seem to be content in only on area. I was expecting much more hop flavor, but also, this is my first imperial amber, so this may be the style. The label says there is a trifecta of hop flavors, and it is a good combination. Nugget, tomahawk, and Warrior. There is a pine, hop flavor that stays in the mouth. And a sort of barley roast in the high after taste. Not like a dark roast, but pleasantly done.  The overall drinkability of this beer is very high. If they distributed outside of the northeast, I would guarantee this would be a constant staple in my fridge. For those that like hops, this is an interesting change of pace, but still getting that beloved flavor we all crave. Acquired through a trade with masterhomebrewer. I was sitting on 3 bottles of Abyss, and he asked, so I got 2 bottles of NN. I haven't had an Abyss so, I am not sure who got the better end of the deal, but I thank him for this experience.

Pine and citrus hit first with some tropical fruit and caramel following. A little bit of wet grass sneaks in too. I even caught a little coconut on one whiff. Lots of hops, as expected, but a pretty sweet aroma tries to balance. Like the aroma, the hops dominate the flavor too. Pine and citrus followed by the tropical fruit flavors again. Strangely, the coconut that was only a passing aroma seems to be more prominent in the flavor. Caramel/brown sugar sweetness come through as a nice balance. Good mouthfeel. Somewhat sticky and resiny. Good carbonation. Quite drinkable. This is a hop bomb, but a balanced one. At 7.5%, only 1 or 2 would be enough for an evening. Probably one of the most complex ambers I've ever had. If I didn't look at the style, I would have thought this was an IPA.

Brilliance from the first drink! The peach aroma transfers quite nicely to hoppy/peach fussion. Suttle sweet maltiness smooths things out for the finish. Medium bodied brew that build slightly when rolled around the tounge. Remains clean and refreshinng throught. This one did not disapoint! One of the best amber ales I've experienced.

The lacing is super sticky and awesome. Aroma is floral, doughy, citric and of course hoppy. Taste upfront is gorgeously hoppy but at the same time there is the perfect amount of bready and toasty malt flavor to blow the mind. A refreshing hint of grapefruit is present.

Just off-white with decent retention; reduced a thinner layer but stuck around. Some visible carbonation. Excellent lacing all the way down.  Smell: A perfect nose of sweet hops, with pine, grapefruit, and other citrus the strongest. All sorts of floral and fruit hops as well, with no bitterness at all. Not really much in the way of malts, but that's just fine with me.  Taste: A perfect balance between the balance betwen the hops flavor and bitterness and the overall sweetness of the beer. Not too bitter, not too sweet or syruppy. The malts seem to add perfect sweetness, but little else; mostly floral hops throughout.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, and very smooth. A little carbonation tingle on the tongue up front, and a very light and smooth hop bite.  Drinkability: An excellent beer. Perfectly balanced hops and malts, very appealing.

Not overpowering or anything.  Mouthfeel is full of lingering hop bitterness, which doesn't feel anything like ""93-ish IBUs"".  A tasty, nicely balanced amber ale here. Doesn't taste like a hop bomb at all and the hops only add more to it. I like the usage of lesser-used/lesser-known (at least in my experience) hops such as Nugget, Warrior and Tomahawk.

Sweet, pine, and resin all come to mind. Regardless, I like it.  The taste has an interesting flat finish that lingers with nothing appealing about it. I'm getting hit up front with the hops as I take the sip and then everything just falls off the table as it slides down my throat.  The taste is a real let down coming off the amazing hop aroma.

Clear amber/copper color with a two finger off white head that stays. The lacing hangs on forever too.  The smell is grape fruity hops, but not horribly strong. I took time just smelling this beer far more than I have any other.  The hops are totally up front in the taste, but not to the point that they over whelm. The hop profile is grapefruity, but it doesn't taste like a glass of grape fruit juice like some hop bombs. The malt is there, its subdued, but not hidden.  I actually expected, with all the hype, to be let down by Nugget Nectar. I can honestly say this beer is everything its said to be.  Edit: Beer reviewed was my first of NN. After two six packs I am less blown away by the taste. Still a great beer, but I needed to update my review. I took taste from 4.5 to 4.

The label mentions Nugget, Warrier and Tomahawk hops but I know there is more than that in this brew, all of it nicely put together for maximum affect, a friendly assault on the taste buds.

Poured aggressively into my pint glass, it produces only a half cm of head, but the lacing is phenomenal. It looks absolutely amazing.  The smell is far hoppier than any amber ale that I have ever experienced. I pegged this one as a higher gravity pale ale, even an IPA when I smelled it. When they called it Nugget Nectar, they knew what they were talking about. The incredible bitter and sweet smells of hops waft up from the beer as it sits in front of me. I want to chew the hops as I smell them. There is a strong hop character there, but it isn't too overwhelming. You can tell there is a nice backbone in here.  The taste is phenomenal. It has been a while since I have tried a beer like this. You get all of the hop flavors that you think you will based on the smell, but you don't get nearly the bitterness. I can really feel every bit of the character that these hops contribute. There is a malty presence in the background that mellows the hop bitterness perfectly.  The entire experience was phenomenal. Wow.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Hoagie1973,3.83,"Pours a nice golden amber with a big fluffy uneven head. Stellar retention; reduced to about 3/8 of an inch and stayed there until the last drop. Nice patchy lacing. Hop aroma is insanely citric. Smells like a fresh peeled grapefruit. A touch of pine in there too. Taste is soft and citrus fruity. Hops are dominant, but not too harsh or biting at all. Pretty smooth and rounded. Malt is a bit thin, could use a little more flavor in that department. There is however a mild sugary sweetness that fights its way through. Long bitter hop finish. The fairly hefty ABV is well blended and barely perceptible. Feel is nice and smooth. Medium body. A nicely drinkable choice if I'm in the mood for something hoppy. One of the better hop-heavy beers I've tried without question.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

694,15881,SFLpunk,3.82,"22oz brown glass pry-top with no date. Picked this up on my recent trip to Wine Gallery Brookline (MA).  Appearance: A clear, medium brown with hints of red around the edges. The head is mostly white, recedes quickly, but leaves a little lacing.  Nose: Caramel malt, pine nettle, sweet grapefruit, and maybe fig?  Palate: Medium to light carbonation, medium bodied. There's some round caramel malt sweetness up front, but the hop bitterness creeps right in and is prickly on the tongue. It's a little boozy, but in a dry, prickly way, not a sweet way. Flavors are similar to the aromas, with sweet lemon on the midpalate, and very dry on the finish. The finish is dry and long, but focused on the dried leaves and pine needle notes.  Notes: This is a seriously tasty beer for the money. Glad to see it comes in affordable 6 packs. I could definitely see sessioning this for a least part of a night without getting sick of it. I just wonder with how dry the finish is, if it might dry my mouth out too much after two or three?

694,15881,JimmieFrisbee,4.79,"Poured into a pint glass from a 22 oz. bottle. Not the entire contents of the bottle, obviously...  Big, frothy head forms with a hard pour, off-white almost orange tinted. Beer itself is an unusual color... looks almost like a very light pink, maybe. Maybe it's the light in this room, but I'd swear it looks pink...  Smells hoppier than I expected, but with a real sweetness to the hops, as well. I've heard ""grapefruit"" used to describe hop smells before, maybe I understand now what that means? In any event, definitely some sort of a fruity hop presence in the aroma.  First sip is absolutely delicious. I had to take two more before I could put the beer down to write these thoughts. I thought for sure the use of the word ""nectar"" was going to be a misnomer, but it really has a delicate sweetness that absolutely merits the name. Looking at the beer in the glass now, it looks less pink but certainly an unusual color, like an ultra-light copper. The odd thing about this beer is that despite the hops, it really doesn't taste bitter to me, just flavorful and well-balanced. And delicious. Just realized, too, that I'm not even getting a hint of alcohol.  Feels about right in the mouth -- slightly heavier in the carbonation than some other beers, but not too much. Good body. I could definitely seeing drinking more than a few of these -- or, I could if they were cheaper or I made more money.  Pleasantly surprised by this beer, will definitely make all my friends try it next time I have some sort of a tasting. I'd recommend this to anyone (well, just about...).

Hazy copper with basically no head. Smelled fantastic. Amazing hop freshness, as with the HopSlam, but this had a little more malt balance. Tasted wonderful. I might enjoy this beer more every time I have it, and drinking it from a cask was definitely an experience. So amazingly fresh, so pure hops, so sweet malt, so well balanced. Not sure if there was a fault in this one. Thick but not too thick, very silky with no carbonation, strong but no noticeable alcohol. This is a perfectly tamed beast. It's the porridge that's just right. Some people might prefer HopSlam for it's more extreme bitterness.

T - The first couple sips almost knocked me over with their hoppy intensity, but continued drinking mellowed the kick into an interesting resiny sweetness. It's pretty much all hops, but that's definitely not a bad thing.  M - Leaves little aftertaste and doesn't finish dry. A very interesting, clean mouthfeel.  D - After the first vicious sips, this one proves to be quite drinkable. But I don't know if I'd want to drink more than one of this one. Just too hoppy for me.

T - Hard to describe how good this one is. Huge hop profile, but it doesn't hit with the ""rip the enamel off your teeth"" acidity as other hop bombs. Gives way to a pure orange/lemon flavor. My favorite part of this beer is the perfect transition to the malts, which is like an orange flavored ginger cookie, but isn't overly sweet. This beer lives up to the hype, and more.

Hops are very present but so well balanced with malt that I didnt even realize how bitter this beer was until a friend pointed it out. A grapefruit flavor leads the pack followed quickly by a caramel maltyness that complements the initial bitterness perfectly. Alcohol has a slight presence that prevents a perfect 5. A full body that is perfectly carbonated with a slight syrupy character. I love this beer. One of my favorites. This is the most impressive beer to grace a six pack that I have ever seen.

English malts, but with a major hop acccent. Great!  The taste is sweet bready malts with an accent of some orange peel and sweet tangerine. The base is very sweet, with slightly sour grapefruit as well. Flowery esters and tart flavors.  The thick and creamy feel has a bitter bite on the way down.

694,15881,marvin213,2.84,"The color is bronze. For an amber ale, I think it's kinda light. I was expecting a dark red that wouldn't be translucent. The head is good and white. It has a fullness I've come to expect from these hoppy ales. In keeping with my characteristic label consideration in the appearance of beer, I'm disappointed in the fingers holding a hop nugget...definitely inferior to the Hopslammed man and the solitary 120 hop.  The smell is sweet hoppiness. That's good...very good. Perhaps the only thing preventing it from perfection is a citrus or similar smell present in many of the west coast hoppy beers. I don't care if that's not supposed to be there--I like it, and I miss it.  Since I know this one's hyped and an ""A"" recipient on this site, I'm most disappointed with the taste. The sweet hoppiness I smelled when I poured the beer has changed to something burnt. I still like the hoppiness, but there's burned woodchips or something I find uncomfortable. It's not even close to a bad beer, but I'm sadly disappointed based on what I've heard about this beer. The aftertaste is almost abrasive to me, and it's not the alcohol.  The mouthfeel is okay, but I just mentioned the aftertaste--it's like I'm charred after I swallow the beer. When you think of charred, you might think of something good off the grill, but this is like a nasty piece of brisquet off an old, seldom-cleaned grill grate. Not impressed doesn't cut it--I really just don't like it.  Now how can I comment on the drinkability of this beer? I feel like I did when I reviewed the Victory Prima Pils--is it that I just don't like the style? I love selections that vary from coffee stouts to light (even macro) ales. It's odd (based on my experience with this site, anyway) that I don't really like Belgians, and it's (relatively) odd that I don't really like this beer. I'll drink it again just out of respect for the people that rate it here--so I can judge it again.

This beer is crystal clear with a funky copperish-orange color. Noticeable carbonation in the glass feeds a very light film of sustained foam atop the beer, which collects at the glass forming a slightly thicker ring of foam. Very heavy lacing going on here. This beer likes to cling to the glass.  I'm getting very strong floral hops that are reminiscent of lemongrass and wildflowers. Some mild sugars coming through the nose as well.  Ah, the best part. A full attack of hops to the tongue. Fairly bitter in a lime or lemon zest kind of way. I'm getting some very tart notes as well, and the aftertaste is very bitter and almost like that of watermelon skin (don't ask how I know what that tastes like, I just do). I'd say it was unpleasant if I wasn't also getting some mellow sweetness coming through, almost like wildflower honey.  This one has an odd feel to it. It's a very wet-feeling beer going down, almost as refreshing as water. Then the aftertaste kicks in and dries out your mouth from the back of your tongue forward. There's a mild carbonation tingle to it, and after resting my taste buds a good couple of minutes after drinking I'm now starting to get a weird ""I just ate zinc"" feeling in my mouth, like what you'd get from sucking on a ColdEeze.  Don't get me wrong, I really like this beer! But it's not going to be for everyone.

The little dots of lace glint in the light all the while the beer itself beams with a coppered radiance. Its transparency is not without some very light haze but all things considered the complexion and clarity are both immaculate.  I was hoping to be blown away by hoppiness and... yes, I certainly was. I can't imagine how many acres of hops went into this one bottle alone! It is so very zesty, nothing short of full on chipotle-style piquant. Fruit is not to be forgotten either - very bitter grapefruit stands at the front with notes of lemon, tangerine and melon not far behind. This whole bouquet has such a lively, fresh, green quality to it!  Few times in my life have I encountered a hop bill so pungent and obnoxious! I happen to love the little green pellets anyhow so I don't mind (truthfully, enjoy) the pungency but I'm a little taken at just how much grapefruit juice and pine sap actually manage to seep into your gums. There's also as much orange in the flavour (if not more) than there is in the colour. The flavours are 'vivid' to say the least; put simply it's like gnawing on raw hops.  I keep thinking I might be tasting some scorched caramel or a hint of butterscotch, but every time I do a giant hop cone jumps out of the glass and hits me upside the head. Troegs design this to be hoppy and they succeeded. It is fruity, zesty, herbal, spicy, pungent and bitter. It is everything that hops are. Oh, and the alcohol isn't noted anywhere except on the label.  They certainly got the beer right but I don't know about the label. That hand squeezing all the alpha-acids and resins out of the hop cone is a poor representation of what the beer is actually like - they drew the hop the size of a man's hand.

694,15881,bobsy,3.63,"Over-rated IPA masking as an amber ale. That said, it is amber in colour, and the pour kicks up a nice white head that laces quite well until the end. The aroma is fresh and resiny. In fact, it reminds me a lot of the Dogfish Head 60 Minute in that you feel as ultra-fresh green hops were used straight off the vine. Beyond the hops though, there isn't much malt support. I find the same in the flavour, and its certainly very green, with leafy hop flavours. I'll trust their call on the IBUs, but I'm not really feeling them or the alcohol, which is probably testament to a nicely achieved balance. Perhaps its the sweetness? I don't really see where the 'imperial' comes into this? The pale toasty malts aren't that big, and they prefer to lurk in the background and let the hops do their thing, while the alcohol isn't exactly stratospheric. The mouthfeel and carbonation are both medium, and provide a solid compliment to the flavours.  A very solid drinker, but it suffers from it inability to live up to the hype. Beers like this frustrate me - while they are decent, there's really nothing here at all to justify a ranking as the 32nd best beer on the world. Flipping over to another beer reviewing site I actually find a more balance view, and one that doesn't place this beer on a pedestal. I don't understand what can account for that difference of opinion other than hype within the BA community leading to score inflation.  It sounds like I've rubbished this beer, but that's not my intention - I did find it enjoyable.

694,15881,MacDomer,4.2,"Recently received from IBUnit63 in a trade - thanks for the opportunity, Larry.  Appearance is nice - a bronze orange color with golden highlights. Nice light head, not particularly big, but it's fluffy and enticing.  The nose is hoppy, as expected, with nice malts coming through on the back end. The nugget hops here are a nice change, which I'd call more herbal or grassy than most.  The taste is like a hoppy amber, but it's not quite imperial as the label asserts. Very tasty, and toasty too, to balance the hops. This is good drinking beer right here, but it doesn't make me say wow in the flavor department.  The mouthfeel on this one is about medium. It's a bit sticky too, which is quite enjoyable. Carbonation is just right.  Drinkability...well, this is quite good. If I had access to this around me, I'd probably buy a six pack every release. I was really glad to have been able to try it, but I probably won't seek it out intentionally in a trade.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,brianlg,4.35,"After hearing good things, and being a huge fan of Troegs I had to try Nugget Nectar. I just got a single 12oz bottle and poured into my pint glass. It pours a deep iced tea color with a 2 finger creamy head, which dissolved rather quickly. It smells very piny and hoppy. The taste is also very piny, but also tastes tart and citrusy. Very smooth and goes down beautifully. Extremely tasty, it just gets better sip after sip. I could drink this all day.

694,15881,imagineiii,3.93,"Bought everything left on the shelves in Boston the weekend of EBF.  Poured into a pint tumbler, solid inch of tight creamy head. Great retention. Great amber hues. small carbonation.  Great pine sap and earth on the nose. clean scent, doesnt show alcohol sweetness.  This beer has such perfect balance. Hops are present but dont bite the palate. They stay mostly at the back of the beer, covered by a perfect sweetness. Neither bitter nor sweet linger after the beer is gone.  Mouthfeel is actually rather thin for a self described ""imperial amber"". Hop bitterness does start to collect on the palate after a few sips, but overall, Im detracting for being too drinkable.  If I want an imperial, I wont be craving this beer. If I want an unbelievably smooth and balanced beer that will go down all too quickly for 7.5%, Ill go for this beer.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Beerzebub,4.47,"Thanks to Yetiman420 for trading me this.  12oz bottle, poured in a big wine glass at 50 F/ 10 C.  Copper-amber color, fine haze, small cream colored head, finely patterned lace.  Aroma of musky, piny, citrusy hops, and caramel malt. Nice richness to the malt, and some complex notes along the lines of mild leather, sweet tobacco, and dulce de leche. Mild, but exceedingly pleasant.  Tastes like an array of piny, fruity hops and toasty fruity caramel malt. An overall fruitiness binds the malt and hops; totally cohesive. Moderate musky resinous bitterness comes in, and the malt grows deeper and more complex. Very well balanced and very tasty. Long finish of tasty caramel malt.  Soft, supple, rich texture. Quite drinkable.  Tasty, well crafted, interesting beer. I enjoyed this.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

This beer is definitely all about taste and it lets you know. Attack is fairly subtle, but the hops kick in quickly with hints of orange and even a little caramel. The finish is awesome, one of my favorites in an Amber. Very vegetal and it lingers very pleasantly.  This is one of the best drinking beers around, IMO. The ABV is totally hidden and it's extremely enjoyable and light without losing any of its great flavor. MOAR!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Smooth malts are detectable.  M = Bubbly and very clean.  D = Easy for the ABV, the carbonation adds a nice lightness.

Not too many bubbles moving up the glass.  Lots of hop aroma. Mostly sweet citrus, along with some pine. A swirl reveals a bit of maltiness as well. Smell isn't as strong as a lot of other hoppy beers though.  Hoppy deliciousness. Hops smack you in the face right away, but then the sweet malt backbone is there to balance. Hops taste mostly of pine and some grapefruit. A little bitterness on the finish. Not too dry. Lots of complexity.  Mouthfeel is really creamy. Carbonation is perfect. Medium bodied.

It looks a lot like what I stained my deck with, so I can only call it ""Mahogany Flame"". The head was only about a finger, but it retained nicely.  S: Like being smacked in the face with a snowball made of hops. Still very nicely balanced with overtones of citrus, pine, and malt. The only reason it's a 4.5 is because the aroma actually seemed to fade as it approached room temp versus intensify.  T: I was amazed at how smooth this beer is. The least bit of that hoppy beer aftertaste, which is soooo nice. Wonderfully clean. Still getting hints of the citrus and pine, but not as much of the caramel malt, and definitely not much alochol.  M: Superb. A perfect balance between carbonation and taste, not to sharp or flat. It feels just right.  D: I was so pleased by this beer, I couldn't wait until I finished it to post this review.

694,15881,woodychandler,5,"I am really excited that one of my home state's last big boys, in this case Troegs, has begun CANning their beers. I will be ecstatic when Victory finally catches up!  From the CAN: ""Squeeze those hops for all they're worth! Nugget Nectar will take hopheads to nirvana with aheady collection of Ameri[CAN] hops. Our Imperial Amber Ale is further intensified with whole flower Nugget hops added to our hopback vessel, resulting in an explosion of citrus, resin and pine.""; ""Pack it in, Pack it out.""; ""IBU[:] 93ish[,] Color: Straw/Orange[,] Hops[:] Nugget, Warrior, Tomahawk, Simcoe, Palisade""; ""It's impossible to forget your first squeeze. Once a year, as the newest humulus lupulus harvest arrives at Troegs, we blend these super-fresh hops into an Imperial Amber Ale. Excessively dry-hopped, Nugget Nectar is an explosion of pine, resin and mango.""  The CANticipation was becoming overwhelming and I could not hold back from the Crack! a moment longer. I CANmenced an inverted Glug, resulting in two-plus fingers of dense, tawny head with good retention, creating sticky lacing as it slowly fell. Color was imperial Deep Amber/Light Copper to Copper (SRM = > 13, < 17) with crystal clear NE-plus quality clarity. Nose smelled sticky, resinous and piney and man, the hops monkey on my back began to screech and squeal and generally act up. Mouthfeel was medium-to-full, not quite creamy, but close. The taste was like liquid music for my deprived, depraved tongue. I have been drinking a lot of malt-driven beers and non-hoppy ciders lately and I missed to intensity of hops as a result. This was more pine than grapefruit, especially given its resiny nose. I am proud to enumerate Troegs as a Pennsylvania brewery and this is a prime example of why. Finish was dry, bitter, and about as close to an AIPA as you CAN get from an AmeriCAN Amber/Red Ale. I experienced nothing to make me change my original scores.  My original, cask review, dtd 28 Feb 2009 follows:  Holy (Beer) Spit (and Cursing), Batman! I cannot believe that I have never reviewed this beer in any of its forms. Last night was probably the best-attended Cask Night at Lititz's GEN Sutter Inn to date and it was thanks to a couple of locals, including this one. Many thanks to the incomparable Paul Pendyck for hosting an event that so many look forward to on a monthly basis!  Onward. This came out of a hand-pump manned by Mr. Pendyck. It had two fingers of light-tan head with decent retention. The color was a beautiful BUPGOO amber with NE-quality clarity. The nose was oozing with pine. My mouth began to water like that of Pavlov's dogs upon hearing a bell. Yow! The mouthfeel was silky smooth, caressing my tongue in its gentle grip. The taste was like licking a pine tree. Mmmm. I loved it, but it may not be for everyone. The finish lingered with a sticky, pine-y, resinous aftertaste.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Not a huge head but it doesn't go away after calming down. Nice lacing.  S: Citrus and pine. My only minor complaint is the smell is a little faint for my tastes. Perhaps a different glass would help it out for me.  T: Absolutely delicious! Lots and lots of hops but well balanced at the same time. No taste of alcohol despite the fairly high ABV.  M: Very smooth with the perfect amount of carbonation. Tingles in all the right places.  D: If I could get enough of it, I wouldn't have a problem turning this into a session beer.

It has a bold pine flavor with juicy citrus peel. It tastes like... essence of American hops. It's hard to detect the malt. There may be a touch of pretzel. There is no distracting sweetness.

Slowly reduces, leaving a web of lacing on the side of my Ommegang 10-year anniversary goblet.  Big aromas of piney, floral and citrusy hops -- outstanding complexity of the nose in the hops alone. A strong backbone of malty caramel smells balances it out.  The taste is again dominated by a complex blend of grapefruity hops. Some sweet maltiness toward the middle giving way to a lingering bitter finish. Each sip calls for another one. Hoppy as hell without being harsh. Smooth is the operative word here.  Mouthfeel is oily -- again from the big hop presence -- but feather-light as well. A little more heft wouldn't hurt, but nothing to complain about.  Extremely drinkable at 7.5% for something that I would categorize more as a DIPA.

694,15881,John_M,4.62,"From a firkin/pin at Max's last night.  The beer pours the expected hazy orange color with pretty good head retention and sticky lacing. As always, this beer has just a gorgeous nose of orange hoppy citrus and lots of underlying spice. You know right off this is going to be great stuff. On the palate this beer is just excellent. Cask conditioning softens this beer, but it loses none of its delicious flavor profile. There is still that wonderful marriage of fruity, bitter hoppiness one gets from the excellent balance of malt and hops. The beer finishes with a nice dry hoppy bitterness, but the cask conditioning gives this beer a creaminess that is just amazing. The finish is quite long and is exceptional. Alcohol is well disguised and you could easily fool yourself into believing that it would be OK to drink pint after pint after pint (which I nearly did).

Smell is piney citrus hops with some distinct orange smells outside of the other citrus smells with a slight malt to it.  Taste is exquisite. Full on smack of delicious hops that gets washed out by tangy orange flavor that has a teeny-tiny malt character to it. I love the fact that from the first taste you expect a bitter hops but it just goes away with this great citrus, almost candy finish.  Mouthfeel is medium, great carbonation, alcohol is hidden perfectly.  This is great. I have been let down by a few other Troeg's offerings, but this one is tops. Best Amber i've ever had.

The taste is pretty good, a slight hop bite coupled with some light malts. A bit more hop heavy that its bottled counterpart, but also strangely smoother due to the cask. It was pretty interesting, lost alot of viscousity due to the cask and it seems to be missing something else. Overall, though its good in the cask, it may be better in the bottled format.

Lots of citrus fruit and candy sweetness in the nose.  Flavor is totally IPA+ with great hop-forward flavor.

T- The big chewy taste of hops has qualities of pine and orange hard candy to them. There is a soft slightly sweet toasted malt flavor that comes through a bit more as the beer warms. There is a pleasant musty hint to the herbal hop finish that has a soft bitterness when cool. The bitterness comes through after the sip is finish and grows as the beer warms. The aftertaste is dandelion bitterness but there is a full hop brightness aswell that balances it nicely.  M- This beer has a medium-full mouthfeel with no alcohol heat noticed.

T: Fruity at first with pineapple and apricot fading into one of the best malt characters I've come across in a highly hopped beer.

Spider like lacing at the top of the glass on initial pour that continues down the glass after completion.  S: Large orange, grapefruit and citrus colors on the nose, big hop presence.  M/T: Light to medium body on the tongue. Big bitter hop and citrus punch, followed by a ""piny"" flavor on the tongue after swallow. Hops are really felt on the after taste.  D: Big flavor for an amber, this beer is not delicate. However, this being an amber beer, it really balances out the ""hop bomb"" factor, making it very drinkable and pretty session able. By far, one of my favorite beers of the season.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

This bottled beer was poured into an American Pint glass for evaluation.  Appearance - A darker shade of amber with a nice, white head. Although the head leaves quickly, there is some nice lacing throughout.  Smell - Yum! Sweet grapefruit. Lots of sweet grapefruit! I can't wait to try it...  Taste - There are definitely 4 types of hops in this ale. Wow, I need another sip. Yep, hopheads will love this pseudo-IPA labeled an Imperial Amber. Great balance with the three varieties of malt.  Mouthfeel - Silky smooth even with the oiliness of all those hops.  Drinkability - High! This just might challenge SN's Bigfoot for space in the fridge!

694,15881,clayrock81,4.22,"A seethru amber red with two-finger white head that dies quickly with minimal lace. An intense hop smell, and I'm not quite good with differentiating between certain kinds of hops, but is the kind of hop smell that is citrusy, piney, floral and soapy. Plus a little spice in the smell and hints of sweet malt. The taste, like the smell, is almost all hops with citric fruit and grapefruit. Some caramel and other sweet and bread malts are minimal but in there to keep a balance (bread, cake or gum...sugary stuff). so the beer maintains its dryness but is also a little syrupy yet also a little creamy. Finishes dry, remaining constant w/ the beer's feel. I look forward to this beer's release every year.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Pretty much that, with a tad of sweetness. Awesome. T - Hops. Citrusy, some pine, just tons of grapefruit. Bitterness is there too, and blends perfectly with the hop flavor. I'm not getting much malty flavor, and not too much sweetness. I wouldn't call this ""balanced"" per se, and don't really care. M- Very oily. In a good way. D - Not too shabby. Hard to follow with anything else, anyway, as your mouth is now coated with hop oils.  This is an excessive, over-the-top, obsessive love letter to hops in a bottle. Very, very good.

Hard to read ink on the label looks like this was bottled on 01/19/09.  Appearance: Pours with 1 finger of nearly white head. This settles slowly to a thin coating with several island of foam, leaving behind complete lacing. The beer itself is a nice deep amber and perfectly clear. No sediment in the bottle.  Smell: Very strong aroma, wafts up I am sitting here at my desk. Sweet, pungent grapefruit. Hands down, the best pure hop aroma I have ever come across.  Taste: Strong and spicy grapefruit hops upfront blend seamlessly into bitter flavoring hops. Lower sweetness in the taste than anticipated by the smell.  Mouthfeel: Average carbonation level. Body is great. Thick, leaving a nice coating in the mouth.  Drinkability: Yum. A great mix of the various iterations of the hop flavor.

A: Orange caramel body, languid carbonation. Frothy off white head of about a finger and a half segues into picturesque, classic lacing, later on.  S: Highly aromatic, a wickedly floral brew -- it really does fill the room with its perfume. Luscious, sultry, and most of all, seductive, hops -- dark ruby red grapefruit, pine sap, candy like orange, JuicyFruit gum, all of this and more at the first whiff. Such a sweetness dominates the back end, it's almost choking.  T: A tidal wave of hops, tangy grapefruit, pine extract, an acidic lemon citrus touches down briefly. Butterscotch and baked bread coated in brown sugar make up the malty spine of this hop heavy beer. Leaves off in a wash of sour bitterness that begs you to have another sip to wash it it down, with another, and another...  M: Medium bodied, starts of creamy and ends a bit dry.  D: It has stopping power at 7.5 ABV, but it's so evilly good, you drink it quickly and just want another. This beer, plain and simple, is a temptress.  As a friend of mine pointed out, it seems sweeter than last years.

694,15881,albern,4.54,"At first take, this strikes me as a very juicy, sweet, and citrusy IPA, but alas this is an imperial amber by label. This is really more of a nouvelle IPA, but what's in a name anyway. The beer pours a clear, slightly orangy red and copper color with a modest foamy and creamy head that doesn't retain all that well, and laces just a tad. The nose is very pungent and wonderful. This is a giant orange burst, piney notes, grapefruity tartness, with just an overlay of biting florals throughout. There might be a bit of malty breadiness underneath.  The taste will not disappoint. The only downside I detected was when the beer was a touch too cold and some metallic notes emerged. They disappeared quickly enough when the beer settled into its natural temperature range. This is a sweet, nouvelle IPA with juicy, oily, and estery hops with lots of orange and floral bursts; there are plenty of citrusy acerbicness to the hops. There are some slight caramel malts underneath, and they are sweet, so the whole just wonderfully complements each of the constituent components. This is a medium bodied beer with a 7.5% ABV that is well hidden. You won't know the strength of the beer otherwise. The finish is sweet, the aftertaste quite mild and refreshing, more than biting and lasting. There is a touch of drying nuttiness in the finish. This beer has few flaws and is a great red IPA, if there is such a thing, but absent that I will accept the imperial IPA label as aptly suitable.

Retention is very nice, and there's plenty of lacing left on the glass.  S: Wow, what an aroma. Some toasted malts are available, but they're dominated by the extremely fragrant hops. Mostly citric, with an orange rind character. Definitely also some strong floral notes. Some more subdued herbal hints as well.  T: This is a hoppy and bitter beer for sure, but it's not even close to being a one-dimensional hop bomb. There's a fairly solid dose of toasted malt flavor that gamely contends with the massive load of hops. Also a bit of bready yeast at times. Citric and floral flavors dominate. Again, I detect orange rind and a strong floral bitterness. As the bottle says, 93 IBUs, so there's certainly an aggressive bitterness, but it never becomes too much to handle.  M: Medium to somewhat full-bodied with average carbonation. A resiny mouthfeel that leads to a very dry finish.  D: I'm really impressed with this beer. I was slightly skeptical given the incredible hype it receives here, but it is definitely warranted.

The color and clarity of this beer are striking. A nice dark amber/organey color with generous amounts of head (though not quite 2 fingers) that didn't hang around all that long and receded to a nice thin film. I got lacing throughout the entire drink.  The nose is dominated by hops, its a very floral/cirtusy aroma that is offset slightly by some malt in the background.  This beer's taste is nearly identical to its smell. A nice kick of hops right up front, but its not overwhelming (93 IBUs). This beer is extremely well balanced especially given its higher alcohol content (7.5%)  The carbonation is great on this beer. Theres no ""sting"" anywhere to be found, and the post-hop bitterness is not overwhelming at all but rather a slight lingering reminder of the well balanced trifecta of hops.  Drinkability is definitely here. If you're a hop fan, you'll love this beer. I could put back a few of these in a night with no problem. Again its extremely well balanced and goes down very smooth.

SMELL is soft, earthy, slightly floral hop aromas. Faint, however. Hard to find a nose on this one. TASTE is very smooth and balanced. Hop flavor is richly floral, backed well by malt that never quite gets sweet, and only ever so vaguely bitter. Very clean finish. FEELS lightly carbonated, pleasant soft texture, med/light body. Clean finish. DRINKS smooth and easy, but overall didn't dazzle me at all. Maybe being on cask had something to do with it?

Smell: I'm sitting about two feet away and I can still detect the hoppy aroma. Smells strongly of hops (Nugget, Warrior and Tomahawk) and maybe a little honey. Hops take over.  Taste: Hop juice. It doesn't make you pucker up like some hoppy brews, in fact the hops play off each other well. Not much else in terms of flavor though. A bit of sweetness and citrus/grapefruit from the hops. Good but not mind blowing.  Mouthfeel: Even though the hops steal the show, its the sweetnesss that lingers on the tongue. Smooth feel and a good selection of hops.  Drinkability: Higher alcohol, but I could go for a while with this beer. For a hoppy beer, I may look in another direction, but I would have no problem recomending this or buying more.

A: Pours an absolutely crystal-crear, dark-amber/burnt-orange color with a light-orange dallop of creamy meringue-like foam on the top. The head recedes quickly to a filmy skim that leaves droopy sheets of lace stuck to the glass.  S: Tantilizing aromas of hops. Piney, tropical fruity hops. Herbal hop notes as well as caramel malt, tangerine, mango, fresh mown lawn, and apricot.  T: Taste follows the smell pretty much lock-step. Gloriously fresh hops, tropical fruit, dried wildflowers, and a nicely paired malt backbone featuring toasted and caramel flavors.  M: Peppery, juicy, sticky, and oily. This thing coats the mouth with a wonderfully spicy, fresh squeezed hop essence. I can feel a peppery tingle on the tongue during the long finish.  D: Yes! I'm so glad to finally have tried this.

A - Med-light amber color, 1/2 inch head becomes a thin film relatively quickly. Very clean and clear with medium carbonation  S - Mile hop aroma. Orange peel. I expected a stronger hop presence in the smell given the label has a giant hop nugget on it.  T - Interesting. Very Tart/bitter right up front, becomes a mildly sweet taste in the middle. Finish is extremely dry with little flavor...wait after about 1/2 way through, the finish is there and it is pure grassy bitterness. These hops were in the kettle for a long time.  MF - Medium body with crisp, dry finish. A bit light for an ""amber"" beer. Leaves some hop oil.  D - One or two at best. The lingering bitter finish is too much and overpowers the over taste/flavor of the beer. Don't know about the price as this was a trade.

Easily produced a full three/four fingers if fluffy white haed that lingers just a little while. Lacing is apparent on the walls of the glass.  The aroma is piney with dried pruit. Smells more like an IPA than a American Amber.  Wonderful full flavor of hops hits you first, am I sure this isn't an IPA? After the hops hit fades I begin to notice roasted malts, and then dried fruit ... apricots I think and some honey. The mouthfeel is rich and full on the palate, and comes across creamy in texture.  I wasn't sure what to think when I first tried this beer, but as I sat and sipped, I began to see some real appeal.

Big hop nose on this one, maybe there's some malt in there, I can't really pick it out. Taste is nothing like the nose, and in a very good way. Very refreshing smooth sweet malty brew with a beautiful bitter finish. I think I like this because even with the floral grassiness it lacks that pine tree bitterness that would lead to this being a little out of reach for most people. Very well balanced smooth creamy beer. The hops are very nicely balanced with smooth carmamel malt backbone that makes this an extremely drinkable brew. Pleases the hopheads with the bitterness and pleases everyone with it's drinkability. This would be an amazing everyday brew if I could get it everyday.

694,15881,JeffV,4.87,The remarkable thing about this beer is not just its hop punch but its smoothness. I bet a lot of that has something to do with how the hops are added late (through a hopback) for aromatics.  The only nits I would pick on this beer are  1. The head could be a little more substantial. Sometimes it dissipates after a while.  2. Ummm... I guess it isn't sessionable at 7%...  I like this beer also on a more philosophical level. This beer is not a mere impersonation of the hoppier West coast ales. It has it's own distinct taste and character and creates its own Hop infused world view.

Good hop presence, but not overwhelming. I would not classify this as a HOP BOMB. There were some nice malty tones in the background to make this a well-balanced flavor.

Did not see any cloudiness or streams of clouds, which made me feel that the taste might not be up to par...but I was surprised again.  The smell was of a Hoppy Wonderland which changed my initial thoughts of this Red Ale. Scents of Citrus and Pine swirled threw this clear beer very strongly with accents of fruit in the background.  The taste of this beer was slammed with Hops and had lots of citrus with other fruits int he back ground. This beer was full of surprises being an Ale beer it was more like a IPA with a Clear amber body and not as bitter as a IPA.  Medium body beer that was easy to drink. Beer was very bitter for a Amber style Ale which was fine for me, but felt like it needed a bit more malt flavor to even things out.

The head stayed for a long time and never dissipated past a thin layer of foam on the top of the beer.  Smell: Great hops, some earthiness and an underlying hint of caramel malts rounds out the aroma. Very inviting.  Taste: Starts off with a hoppy bite before leaving the palate with a quick biscuity aftertaste. My one complaint is that the aftertaste only exists for an instance before it vanishes. I prefer my biscuitiness to stick around for awhile.  Mouthfeel: Very creamy and rather bitter, creating a nice and enticing balance. The bitterness starts each sip, but doesn't have much of a place in the aftertaste, which I find unusual.  Drinkability: I had no idea this was 7.5% until just now when I looked it up. It goes down like a session ale, which is why I had 3 of them in quick succession. One of the best american beers on cask I have ever had.

Smell: Piney hops, some herbal or floral undertones, and a hint of malts.  Taste: Strong hops, predominantly piney in character, backed up by backdrop of malt. Then sometimes when you think you've got its flavor nailed the malts bounce out and push the hops into the background. The finish is long and bitter.

With that being said this beer does have a nice malt backbone lending some sweetness although that is obviously not the focus. The flowery, citrusy hops dominate, which goes right with the bitterness experiences upon swallowing. I was expecting the alcohol to show its head but it never did. This could give any hop addict a nice fix. It is surprisingly drinkable considering the ibu and alchol content.

S- The nose is a wonderful balance of piny, herbal, and citrus hops. The piny comes through the most here. A big caramel malt backbone comes through in the back.  T- Simply awesome. A big bright hoppy flavor that showcases a blend of piny, citrusy, and herbal hops comes through initially. A wonderful somewhat sweet caramel background is also very detectable. The finish is consistent with the initial flavor-through the pine definitely the showcase of the finish. A very minimal residual bitterness lingers along with all the other flavors mentioned.  M- Wow. The mouthfeel is packed full of smooth hop oils. The hops come through in the mouthfeel more than in the smell and taste combined. This has a better mouthfeel than some of my favorite DIPAs. Carbonation is low adding to the wonderful smoothness of this cask ale.  D-I love this beer. My only complaint is a dash more of citrus. wow...its wonderful and oh-so drinkable...and I wish it were more readily available on cask. I still do love the bottle and tap versions through. I'm happy I live in the same state as this great brewery!  Edit: When this site condensed reviews it took my highest review. The above content is from my CASK review...Cask nugget nectar was one of the top 3--5 beers ever. Its a totally different experience than bottled or even on-tap. I believe my tap review on the old system was 4.6, bottle 4.35, and cask 4.9.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Goldfish,4.54,"A - Poured into a pint glass from a 12oz bottle. Strong head with lots of pockets which slowly evaporated away. Had a nice orangey-molasses hue to it.  S - Sugar and hops. Tiniest notes of fruit.  T - Tastes great. Not quite an overpowering IPA and much more complex an intense than an ale or lager. Would use this to introduce someone to the fabulous world of hops. This is a great beer but, I would rather just drink an IPA if I wanted an IPA.  M - Not too smooth, but goes down well. Carbonation plays on the tongue and leaves you wanting more.  D - VERY. I could drink this all day if it wasn't for the price.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,raoulduke37,4.8,"I have to give another thanks to Nate from PA on a trade for this one. This beer definitely lives up to the hype.  Poured it into a Guinness pint glass, color is a light orange, with gold at the bottom and a deep copper in the middle. Beige head sticks around for a while, and fine lacing that I'm sure will be there even when I'm done sipping this beauty. the carbonation keeps rising to the surface like a bubble ballet.  Stuck my nose into this bad boy and smelled pure hops, some pine, and a whole lot of citrus. Much hoppier than I expected from an amber, quite pleased with it, actually.  The taste is like an orange cream popsicle, balanced out with plenty of hops. This beer seems to me like an IPA/amber hybrid, which apparently is a fine combination. Lost of juicy citrus flavors, and a crisp clean finish. I feel like standing up and clapping but there's no one here. I'm sure you all understand.  The mouthfeel was well-balanced, not overly carbonated (surprising because of all the carbonation that just keeps coming and coming. A crisp brew, but with the hard edges smoothed out. This would make an incredible session beer, if it weren't for that fact that I can't get it out here :( Simply fantastic.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,McClungbrew2,4.65,"Appearance - Clear orange/copper hue. Smooth off white head that lasts. Plenty of lace to the end of the glass.  Smell - Lots of hoppy citrus aroma, with pineapple, and pine resin notes in the background.  Taste - Hoppy throughout,very juicey with plenty of citrusy grapefruit. Some hints of pineapple and pear. Held together with a malt backbone that is sweet enough to balance the hops but not assertive. Hops are the featrued ingredient itn this delicious beer.  Mouthfeel - Medium body, juicey but clean. Hop bitterness, and flavor asserts itself and balances the malt sweetness.  Drinkability - Very drinkable for such a hoppy beer. I always finish wanting another.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,RichT73,4.97,"I read all the incredible reviews, heard how difficult it was to find Nugget Nectar, so when I saw one six pack left I thought I had found my holy grail. Now the only thing I was worried about was...would this beer live up to all the hype. Well, I'm happy to report that it did and then some. The main thing that stands out is the incredible smell of citrus. Wow. I almost thought it would be too fruity for me, but it wasn't overwhelming at all. The amount of hops were perfect and the drinkability was incredible. I knocked back three of these in about a half hour before I had to stop. Not only does this taste great, but it's so easy to drink. Highly recommended. Now I just want to find a full case.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,SteveO1231,3.82,"Received a single 12 oz. bottle from TurdFurgison in a trade. I was pretty excited to try this one since it's been receiving a ton of attention on the forums lately. The beer pours a bright amber with golden orange highlights. Lots of large fast moving carbonation and an excellent foamy off-white head. Awesome aroma of caramel malts, and a huge presence of pungent, pine, and citrus hops. Nugget Nectar is extremely light bodied with a super-creamy texture and slight slickness. Faint on the caramel sweetness, whatever is in there is completely masked by hop flavor, pungent and spicy. Finishes very bitter with a aspirin spiciness that is a bit unbalanced. I wish there was a little more malt sweetness in flavor like there is in the aroma. I was left with some blue balls from this one, I did not... JIZZ, IN MY PANTS!  Cheers!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,TheDoorman,4.77,"Pours a transparant amber with a pillowy white head that dissipates quickly with nice lacing. Aroma is filled with dense citric hops. Definitely some orange, nectarine tones. Taste is also filled with citric hops, with a fantastic residual pale malt sweetness. Grapefruit really asserts itself. If I tasted this blind I'd call it an DIPA, because the citric hops are just oh so prominent, but there is definitely a nice light, sweet, malt backdrop that compliments the hops perfectly. Light yet creamy on the palate. Each sip leaves you begging for more. The best, and only Imperial Red I have ever had. A remarkably drinkable beer. Fantastic.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,JWD,4.7,"Thanks to RoyMunson for this,  WOW!!!  A- Looks like some of the best IPAs out there. Golden amber in color with a small white haed that hangs around for a while.  S- Pliny?? I know the is some debate to this but this is as close as you get to the smell of Pliny. Hops and more hops wonderful array of hop aroma.  T- Outstanding, is this a DIPA because it tastes like one!! Just a delicate hop assault that before this only Pliny could deliver in such a smooth and refined way.  M- Thin, this could have a little more malty balance and thickness but still good.  D- Dangerous, i will keep my wife away from this.. Very easy to drink!!  I am very impressed with this offering as I have seen the NN/Pliny debate and though close, Pliny still wins the war. But this is the closest brew i have ever had to it right there with Port Hop Suey. OUTSTANDING!!!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,PoolhouseRebel,4.37,"Poured from a 22oz bomber into my imperial pint. Beer looks nice and rich right from the pour. A golden copper color with small off white head, lots of bubbles and some decent lacing.  Smell is extremely nice. Pungent citrus hop resin and biscuit malt. Very sweet and fresh.  Taste is an almost dry, smooth malt that just explodes into a great hop character, same as the nose.  Mouthfeel is full bodied, slick, almost oily with a nice light carbonation to balance.  A good drinkable ""imperial amber."" I like this out of the big bottle much more than the 12 oz sixer i picked up 2 weeks ago. Its like their Hop Back Amber on steroids and not as crisp and carbonated. Great beer definitely lived up to the hype.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,HopHead84,4.25,"Poured into my Lucky Lab imperial pint glass. The beer is effervescent amber with a huge frothy head. The retention is great and the lacing is ample.  The aroma is pretty potent. Sweet caramel malt with floral hops and some pine. The beer smells quite sweet. The flavor is complex and hoppy, with a pretty decent toasted malt backbone to accompany the hops. Bitterness is medium-high and is citrusy. The finish is bitter with some sweetness. The alcohol is most noticeable near the end. The beer is medium bodied with good carbonation and a sticky mouthfeel.  I know there is some debate on the issue, but I must say that this doesn't taste like an IPA...and it shouldn't. The label clearly reads Imperial Amber, and that's what it tastes like to me. A great beer.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,colts9016,4.57,"Thanks to Traquairlover for this bottle.  Poured into a pint glass at 43 degrees.  Appearance: An coppery orange color with a quarter inch white head. The head has no retention to it. There is a lot of effervescence in the beer. The clarity of the beer is clear and brilliant.  Nose: A rich citrus, pine, malt, and a hint of caramel sweetness in the beer.  Taste: A heavy rich orange, pine and malt characters. There is a caramel like sweetness.  Overall: The beer is nicely balanced between the rich malt and the bitter hops. The beer doesn't have much in the nose or the taste, but what it doesn't have it makes up for the quality of ingredients. The mouth feel is full body and carbonated. The finish is medium bitterness and linger for a bit. The beer is very well made and is really good. The only thing I have against this beer, is the head doesn't have a very good retention.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,BuffaloTapHugger,4.08,"Poured 12 oz. bottle into pint glass. Deep amber hue with a two finger head that stuck around for a minute or two. Magnificent lacing. A sweet hop smell right out of the gate. Smells of mango and cat urine come together and make a very unique boutique. Gulp. Crazy hop on the palate, the sticky nature of the beer along with the sweetness make for some beer. The gulp factor is extremely high which is seldom in most imperials that I've drank in the past. If you like hops and hoppy red ales this should be your beer of choice. This is my favorite red ale (too bad its a seasonal, stock pile is a must), the Troegs brothers should be proud to have this one locked in the recipe book. Very Recommended.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,dqderrick,4.5,"=== === === === === FIRST REVIEW 11-08-2008 === === === === === Thanks to Kadonny for this 12oz bottle.  Slightly cloudy, amber colored beer. Clean malty, sweet smell. The smell makes me ache to taste it. I smell light hops.  Finally... the taste is amazing. Wow, this is definitely an imperial amber. I haven't had many Imperial Ambers, but this one definitely anchors itself as the top of the category. The mouthfeel is perfect.  Drinkability... well, I could have two and that's about it. I'd have to move onto something a little less sweet. However, those two will be a memorable experience.  === === === === === UPDATED 02-11-2009 === === === === ===  First off, thank you sholland119 for trading me a 12-pack of this fresh brew. Served in a New Belgium goblet at 50°F.  My previous review above was done from a bottle that was around 11 months old by my best guess. This review was done with a bottle a month or less old.  I have updated the scoring to reflect this fresh bottle. The old review as scored as follows: OLD: 4.5, 4.5, 5.0, 4.5, 3.5 NEW: 4.5, 4.5, 5.0, 4.5, 5.0  I'm a little surprised by my new drinkability rating, but it seems that I complained of sweetness in the older bottle. Interesting.  APPEARANCE- 4.5 Crystal clear. Copper with a little amber... maybe even pink tint. Poured a nice 1/2"" white head that dissipated in about 30 seconds to nice frothy traces of head. Lacing from the head is coating the side of the glass. A slight swirl still leaves some of the lacing.  SMELL - 4.5 Wow! I smell a DIPA. Reminds me of what I'd expect Dogfish Head's 90 Minute DIPA to smell like. A swirl and second smell brought out more of the malt sweetness. There's the imperial red! The smell is right up there with Green Flash's West Coast IPA and their Imperial IPA along with Russian River's Pliny the Elder.  TASTE - 5 First taste was unexpectedly mild. Quickly went for the second sip... aerated.... delicious. I take it this is a hopped up imperial red (duh). Recently, I've become a fan of imperial reds and this seems to be done perfectly for a hophead like me. The overall smoothness reminds me a little of an aged DIPA (2+ years). I'm going to be giving this a 5 as I'm biased toward DIPA's and Imperial Reds/Ambers.  MOUTHFEEL- 4.5 As I said before, this is amazingly smooth. This could also be part of serving it at a starting temp of 50°F. I feel the carbonation on the tongue just a little. The subtle malty sweetness seems to coat my tongue on each sip that I swish in my mouth.  DRINKABILITY- 5 Through the roof. Drank 2/3 of a 12oz bottle while getting to this point in the review. This is no session beer, but I could easily get caught drinking 3 of these. To me, the flavor seems bigger than its 7.5% ABV. I may have to trade for a fresh 12-pack of this every year.  I've never tasted anything quite like this. I recommend seeking it out if you have not tasted it.  Now, how do I make 12 of these last the entire year... while sharing such a great brew with family and friends...",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,deereless,4.45,"A: Deep orange, patches of foam over the surface of the beer, crystal clear - 4.25, S: I caught wafts of this beer from a few feet away, highly hopped, boatloads of pine, wow - though I realize it is not the only hop used I guess I really like Nugget hops cause this is one exceptional aroma - 4.75, T: Ambers are better known for their malts but this one is all about the hops, lots of resiny pine, borderlines on being a little too bitter almost harsh but somehow manages to skirt the over-the-top label, some malt but that really plays second fiddle to the hops - 4.25, M: Some nice lingering on the tongue - 4.00, D: This is one beer I have learned to look forward to each year, the imperial amber label seems slighly out of place given the primary role of the hops but I get the gist of the direction that Troegs is taking, this is a beer to which I see myself continually returning - 4.50",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,JohnQVegas,4.67,"Bottle into Sam Adams Lager glass.  Pours a clear, vividly effervescent copper with a creamy, fairly thick off-white lingering cap.  Nose is vividly floral and full of citrus - notes of grapefruit and orange mix with a fresh floral bouqet that's sweet, delicate, and stunningly fresh.  Taste starts off with a nice, dry biscuity malt note, a bit toasty, with a gorgeous burst of sweet, clear citrus mixed with a beautiful herbal hop note as well. Finish is dry, lingering moderate bitterness, with the dry, biscuity malt note coming back out for the exhale.  Carbonation is light, mouthfeel is medium bodied, bit oily, slick. Utterly fantastic beers with no real flaws.  Huge drinkability, massive flavor, one of the best noses I've ever experienced, and lays the hop flavors out so clearly and beautifully they may as well be on an altar.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Appearance- Slightly red orange tinted brown with lots of bubbles streaming up to the whit foam head of medium thickness,  Smells- Lots of hops in the nose, but a good unique sweet smell too of maybe citrus and slight sweet malts mixed in over the heavy hop  Taste- A delicious beer with tons of Hops as it lists it self at near 93 ibus, but its deliciously blended with enough sweetness balancing out the bitter hops in the middle, but lingering is a long lasting hop finish that just resin ants beautifully in your mouth  Mouthfeel- Smooth, soft, and creamy a nice mouth feel for sure  Drinkability- INCREDIBLE, the perfect brew with enormous hops and enormous flavor and a perfectly blended big beer at 7.2 percent that leaves you wanting more and more and more, I wish i got more than a sixer that a split with a friend, this is one i count the minutes to having again, great beer",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Taste is rather pleasing- a good level of carbonation that accompanies a caramel malt backbone that is quickly overwhelmed by the hops. Finishes okay. I don't know if this lives up to the hype, but it's certainly a good brew. If it were available to me, I'd probably buy it.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

694,15881,YesFest,3.98,"Sexy pour, beautiful auburn with light visible co2 and a satin-lacey head.  Smells like spiked fruit punch.

Oh so very drinkable.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,joerodiii,4.12,"Beautiful clear amber with small head. Smells purely of hops. Tastes mainly of fresh hops with just enough malt to support the hop flavor. Troegs did a really nice job with this blend of hops. The flavors meld beautifully with each other and with the malt. I can detect a faint caramel taste, but only if I really concentrate on it.  The beer is a bit too bitter for me to use it as a session beer, but it is really enjoyable on a brisk day or with the right meal.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,cpn920,4.68,"Pours a beautiful clear light orangeish color with a medium head that fades to a thin covering quickly. Smell was very balanced and not overly hoppy or malty. Taste was exceptional. It's truly a perfectly balanced beer. Hops and the malt compliment each other where neither are stealing the show. This is a perfectly carbonated medium bodied beer. Drinkability is as high as it gets. I was anticipating to be let down after all the hype surrounding this beer. No let down here, I am actually surprised at how it is better than expected.

Taste: Whether you call it an America Amber / Red Ale or an Imperial IPA, it is nectar from the gods. Delicious and well balanced from start to finish with little to no typical hops bitterness I have come to expect from BIG I2PAs.  Mouth: Light with ever present carbonation to tickle your tongue.

Hops are nice and fruity which are perfectly balanced by a wonderful caramal malt backbone. Finishes with amazing balance, not cloyingly sweet like many DIPAs. Great carbonation, beer gets better as it warms.  An absolute amazing beer, my first Troegs and quite an impression. This beer is so quaffable, i could drink so many of these beers.

Smell is piney hops, grapefruit, and orange blossoms. Smell is extremely pleasant and really stands out compared to other beers. Hope the taste lives up to the smell... Piney hope up front but not much bitterness quickly fades to grapefuit-orange then a sweet malt. Finally a lingering bitterness comes through. I wondered why this wasn't an ipa and now I understand and totally agree. Very complex taste that goes much further than bitterness although the high alpha hops are def there.

Grapfruit, with a hint of lemon then a wave of bitter hoppiness, and a bit of malt.  M: Light to medium feel. As mentioned before the carbonation is tiny bubbles that tickle your palate before you get the bitter hoppy finish.

694,15881,danadeny,3.61,"Pours a clear copper orangish body. Head dissipates to a thin lace rapidly, no carbonation. This is my second bottle where it looks like in the little bubbles I can see hop oils. I am guessing oils because it looks like a puddle of water with gas in it. The swirls of pastel colors (no it's not soap residue). the smell is amazing, just like raw hop pellets. soft hops, no pine or grapefruit. The flavor is all hops, even though they are soft, there is just a dominating flavor. This beer is a good example that a lot of hops does not always mean bitter (60/90/120 min IPA as well). These are floral, herby, aroma hops with low acidity or else this would be an extreme-double-imperial-hophead-hopzilla-American-west coast IPA (any other hoppy beer sland terms?). But it's just not my style. I like more balance to my beers, the malt front on this beer just doesn't hold up. I have noticed over the years my pallet has tolerated more and more hops and appreciated them; this beer is about where I draw the line of enjoyable hops to pointless overdone hops. So for the style I have to say it's pretty good. Mouthfeel is oily from all the hops, slick. it leaves your lips sticky. Drinkability, I probably could only handle 2 of these per night. It's just too heavy and assaulting on my pallet.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

694,15881,BirdFlu,4,"So this is another one of those mega-hyped beers which I'd sought out for a long time and blah blah such and such.. I wound up pretty disappointed. I should mention, though, that I generally prefer malty beers. So if you're a hop-enthusiast you might want to disregard anything I have to say.. Pour is pretty nice, an orange color with white head.. Interesting to see such an orangish color yet smell so much hop. Smell is just all hops with some citrus and pine in there. Very floral. Taste is, guess what? hoppy! It tastes a lot like some of the hoppier IPA's (DFH 60 minute, for example) but with just a bit of an earthier, deep base, due to it being an amber, which rounds out the hop profile and keeps it from seeming like you are drinking a tree.. some citrusy presence, like grapefruit, as well.. The mouthfeel is light and refreshing. Very floral with some lasting bitterness, but very nice and easy to drink.  Basically.. If you're totally all about hops then it will probably be very enjoyable to get a variation from the typical hoppy-IPA theme. If not, then you may be left wondering what all the hype was about.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,bort11,4.28,"big thanks to leftmindedrighty for this one!  12 oz bottle poured into a Sam Adams shaped glass. Thick one inch high head. Solid sticky lace cling to the glass in a near perfect ring. Color is a clear coppery orange. Lazy carbonation rises from the nucleation site.  Smell is a multi layered hop punch. It is mostly sweet and floral, but there are layers of pine resin and tangerines. Taste is very complex, though still very balanced. Tangerine citrus blended with some clover. Finishes a little tannic.  Mouthfeel is crisp and light, very refreshing. It doesn't feel like a 7.5%. I had three tonight and I feel really good. Not weighed down at all. To enjoy I Blipped Fashion Nugget by Cake.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Stimack,4.28,"Brew pours to a nice orange amber color with a good thick dark white head that has good retention. Very nice lacing down the side of the glass. The aroma is in your face pine hop with some citrus aromas mixed in. Think I am able to pick up some slight caramel malt like aroma mixed in. The flavor is extreme hop, that flavor seems a little more citrus like than was noticed in the nose. The three hop varieties here, Tomahawk, Nugget and Warrior have a nice mix that, though in your face and extreme, play nice with a fairly recognizable malt back ground. Though the hop presence is big and lingers through out at the back of the mouth it is not to the point that I get sick of it, does not have that slick sticky feeling I notice in some. I am saying this because I am not a hop head and don't care for many hop bombs, but this one is nice. With this being said this bomber is giving me more than enough hops for the evening, I don't think I could have more than one at a sitting. Good brew, can see why it gets the props.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Finn,4.45,"I'm excited to try this one, as there is a lot of hype surrounding it.  Appearance: A hard pour leaves a modest but dense, fluffy head. Crystal clear with a light orange hue to it. Looks more IPA-ish than Amber ale-ish.  Aroma: Grass, pine, tropical fruit, sweet malt with a hint of alcohol.  Taste: Begins with a malt sweetness mixed with the hops fruity qualities, and then the bitter pine and grass flavors coat the tongue and stay there. The malt is in the background, but is definitely doing it's job well here, by balancing out all those dang hops!  Mouthfeel: Nice full, smooth body with quite moderate carbonation.  Drinkability: This is quite a drinkable beer, especially considering how ""extreme"" in flavor it is. Troegs has done an amazing job balancing this hop monster just right so that drinking one of these doesn't feel like a big commitment, which is what can easily happen when you make a beer that's 7.5 ABV with a ton of hops. Fantastic beer! (if you like hoppy beers)",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

S: Smells more like an IPA than an amber, but whatever. Hops and citrus.  T: Really tastes like a blend of an IPA and an amber ale, pretty interesting. Tastes like it smells, hops and citrus with a bitter finish.  M: Feels like a regular IPA, not quite as coating as a DIPA. Somewhere in the middle.  D: Very drinkable as the alcohol is barely noticed and it has good flavor.

Pine and spruce are the main notes, along with sweet malts.  Very nice. Much smoother than an IPA. the hops are right there but the malt really shines through. Leans a tough towards the malts, but the hops hold. Excellent version of the imperial amber. The malt lingers more than the hops which is pleasant.  Very smooth and not over sweet or coating.  An excellent brew. Freshness matters on one like this.

694,15881,jjanega08,4.8,"I got a Sixer of these from grandq in an amazing trade. Great guy. Took the beer straight from the box to taste it. very excited for this one. A= Completely ""see through"" amber color, not as dark as I expected. One finger head sticks around becoming chunky as time passes and leaving great lacing. S= very interesting hop malt mix. The hops are definitely there big grapefruit smells and then there's the delicious honey malty odor coming from it. T= Oh the fun part. Hmmm. floral and hoppy but not too overpowering. A very well balanced beer. huge grapefruit notes and then a large amount of sweet malts before finishing bitter. So good M= Smooth and sweet but not totally sticky. Very well balanced. Dry finish on this one. D= Very high. ridiculously high. I really wish this was available in MN just because there's nothing that I can think of like it.

694,15881,br3wmeister,4.47,"A- Half inch foamy off white head that dissipates fairly quickly to a thin layer that lay on top of the beer. Some great lacing going on here. This beer is an orange gold color with light red hues.  S- Some sweet caramel aromas with lots of pine and citrus that work beautifully together.  T- Lots and lots of hoppy goodness. Mostly pine character from the hops but some citrus. Malt makes a small presence with some caramel sweetness and some roasted flavors. Though there is not a whole lot of malty sweetness there is enough to keep the hops from destroying my mouth. The hop bitterness sticks around making your mouth watter.  M- This is a medium bodied beer that coats your mouth with hoppy goodness. Good carbonation and lots of hoppy bite with some dryness in the end.  Overall- This is a great beer, the hop character is different from most beers I have tried. Any hop head will enjoy this beer.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Mattysox,4.75,"This is one awesome beer that really does live up to its hype. I've had it several years in a row, but have never reviewed it. While I prefer it on cask, this review is for the bottled version.  A beautiful, bright orange/amber body is capped off by an off-white, rocky head that hangs around for a good long while. The lacing is sticky, beautiful and long lived.  Nugget Nectar has maybe my 2nd favorite nose ever, after Pliny the Elder. Just gobs and gobs of perfumey citrus notes, fresh pine needles, clove, banana, toffee...just gorgeous. I almost just want to keep smelling it. But the taste...  The mouthfeel is full and creamy, palate coating but not sticky. The first sip is like biting into a ripe ruby red grapefruit. Just so juicy and sweet, then the hoppy astringency washes over the palate and makes you crave another sip. A long lingering finish goes on and on.  This is dangerously drinkable; 7.5 percent isn't that big, but it's barely even noticeable here. This beer is nearly perfect and definitely something to look forward to every year.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,adamette,3.62,"Live review. Poured from bottle indicating that it was bottled 1 19 09 into my DFH clean, clear pint glass.  A Nice generous light colored head over a nice golden brown translucent body with no active carbonation. Head creates nice lacing on glass after drinking.  S Ughh..I was afraid of this...floral hops with a permeating scent of pungeant grapefruit that makes my eyes water...but also my mouth. I was afraid of this but I read so many positive things about NN here on BA I thought that I would like to give it a try. As anyone can guess I do not like this smell as it is just unimaginitive to me and kind of, well, easy. I also do not like it since that smell dominates any other smell that may be available in there, eclipsing other smells. Of course I will continue on and taste it but this leaves me unimpressed. You may not like what I have to say next but it reminds me very much of the smell of my cat's urine stains on my carpet.  T Nice...I am glad to say that there is much more balance in the taste than I perceived in the smell. I was greeted by the sting of hops but then mixed in was the malt (presumably amber malt) and even some sweet syrupy (nectar?) tastes. I do not have a problem with beers that feature hops unless they are too ""one note"" beers. This has some interesting balances in it. Upon further consideration I taste a honey presence in the taste too.  M Full with big hops, malts and a nice syrupy aftertaste accompanied by a hops aftertaste well afterwards.  D Better than average and a very interesting beer.  Notes: Mad Elf and Hop Back IMO are better but it was a treat to try this beer.

Moderately intense level of bitterness which also lasts into the finish.  M - Medium/medium-full bodied with a moderate level of carbonation. Smooth and lacking any hop-derived astringency.

This good beer pours a nice - obviously - amber color, and the head is nice and thick. The smell is also very sweet and nugget-y, and I feel compelled to say that there is even the sense of some citrus hops (sarc.). The smell and the look alone make this a session beer for me, even if it's an imperial. The preliminaries, especially for a beer out of the bottle, are fantastic.  The taste is, as many have avowed, a little overhyped, but I swear this is still a great beer. Certainly Troegs' best, and I love the Troegenator. It's malty and hoppy, but nothing is overdone and noting dominates the flavor throughout the progression. Citrus-y, then a little hoppy and the finish is a lot of malt, but nothing is too powerful. Some pine elements too, although I think that's really just the hops and the malt interacting. The smell and appearance are the best part of the beer, but the taste almost equals them. The feel less so, but like I said everything is balanced.  I could pwn n00bs with this beer any weeknight or weekend.

694,15881,bamadog,4.29,"This is a pretty good beer overall, but I've gotta say, I think it may be a little over-hyped by some. I'm also not sure it's quite worth the 13 bucks for a six pack (thankfully, I split the sixer with a friend so the hit on the wallet was a little easier to take), if I had to choose a reasonable price, I'd say closer to 10 -- but I'm also not considering what it costs to brew and ship, so take that last bit for what it's worth.  Appearance: Nice amber/coppery color. A thin sticky looking head floats on top and there's a light carbonation to it.  Smell: This is probably my favorite aspect - it cuts through my nose and it's almost pungent -- comes across pretty bitter, and almost metallic like a handful of pennies.  Taste: Bitter, but smooth. I'd dare say a little piney.  Mouthfeel: Sits in the mouth creamy, and even a little chewy. Leaves the mouth feeling sticky so you definitely continue to taste it once it's gone down the throat. This is my second favorite aspect about this beer.  Drinkability: Goes down smooth and the fact that it tastes pretty good makes it easy to drink as well.

694,15881,kels,4.12,"Okay, so after seeing a million posts on the US-Great Lakes forum about this beer, I had to pick up a six when it came to my area. Here's my review on a bottle poured into a pint.  Appearance: Pours a clear and bright shade of orangey-brown with carbonation bubbles running throughout feeding the 2 finger tannish-white airy head. The head fades pretty quickly to 1/2 inch, and major sticky lacing hangs off all sides of the glass.  Smell: The smell is a major punch in the nose of bright, citrusy, floral hops with a slight sweetness from the malts. It is seriously prominent, and it really makes me look forward to the taste.  Taste/Mouthfeel: The taste is unbelievably sweet and bitter all at once. All the scents from the hops are magnified in the taste. The citrus is bitter like grapefruit or orange peels, the floral is sweet and bright and there's even a sappy, piney hop quality that wasn't as present in the nose. There are just enough malts to sweeten the taste and provide a little challenge (note, very little) to the powerful hops. The mouthfeel is very light and crisp thanks to the good carbonation, and the aftertaste leaves a sticky film throughout the palate.  Drinkability: Definitely a tasty beer - full of flavor and really crisp and light. Couldn't do too many of these though. The stickiness and huge hops would limit my intake.  Lives up to the hype. I saw a lot of posts comparing this and Hopslam, but I think they're different enough to warrant picking up a few of each.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,NoLiberty,2.96,"Pours clear and light reddish orange in color. Definitely on the lighter side for an amber but well within style. Totally filtered and fresh with a nice solid white frothy head on top that settles into an ever present cap with nice stickiness at the edges and soft lacing spotted up with side. Tiny carbonation lazily floats up feeding this nice head situation.  The aroma is strongly hop forward and starts with subtle fruit and floral notes and moves to a slightly more sweet middle with citrus followed by an underlying ammonia notes. Resiny throughout with a moderate sweetness that makes for an aroma that's complex almost melony but also almost unpleasant.  Strong hop resins and oil up front with moderate fruit flavors. Overall this is too hop dominant without a backing malt quality. The hops are used too extensively with little balancing flavors. The hop choice, nugget, is unpleasant for an imperial amber. The alcohol that comes through is astringent and unconnected to the other flavors of the beer.  Mouthfeel is oily up front followed by a cloying sweet finish and lingering bitter aftertaste that doesn't invite me to drink more. I am a hop fan and I realize this is a highly favored beer but the drinking experience doesn't match the apparent popularity. The ingredient choice and integration leaves an unbalanced beer with overly assertive qualities",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

A small 1cm head, off-white in color, crowned the beer. It dissipated every so slowly.  S - hops, floral and citrusy; there's some grapefruit and pineapple going on, maybe some other fruit too.  T - hops, hops, more grapefruit and pineapple. I did not notice any malt flavor at all, however the beer did maintain some sort of sweetness throughout. I do not know where it came from. There's was also a slight bitterness at the end that did not seem to come from the hops. (Edit: after a second bottle I decided to drop the taste rating from 4.0 because of this beers lack of a malt character.)  M - seemed about average for any hoppy ale.

M: Puckering, crisp, but could use a little more carbonation.  D: Goes down pretty well for a 7.5% beer; the bitterness approaches sourness, but in a pleasant way.

694,15881,Jettanbass9,5,"I find it hard to believe that after two years of drinking this beer I have not reviewed it. It may have taken me this long but better late than never. I digress, I have had this beer on cask, on draft and in the bottle and every which way this beer is amazing.  A - Sappy amber, with highlights of light brown, copper and orange. Soft, delicate head with a sticky lace that etches my journey to the bottom of the glass.  S - a hoppy mix of tropical and stone fruits, a pleasant mix of peaches, pineapple and a delicate floral honey aroma lingers. A bready, almost biscuity rounds out the aroma and ties back into the hop character.  T - Light bitterness is balanced by bready, sweet malts. A dark fruit-like character lingers in the background. Hoppy resins of pineapple, grapefruit and peach are balanced by an earthy complex of cedary resin.  M - Smooth almost creamy complexity without a hint of alcohol. For as much hop character as this beer has there is no hint of astringency or grassiness. The balance of this beer is remarkable neither cloying or too bitter, only a light malt and hop note lingers.  D - Dangerously drinkable. This is the type of beer you can do some damage with. It's balance is key here, neither too cloying or too bitter, this beer balances itself and invites you back for a few more rounds.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,zerofear13,4.24,"Was recommended this beer by some personal friends of mine from the beer tasting club. First brew from Troegs.  Once I poured it, the aroma hit me. It smells amazing. The cascade/centennial/chinook grapefruit hops overpower the nose. It smells amazing. I think I inhaled at the lip of the cup for well over a minute.  The taste is quite light and delicious. Great malth flavor, that citrus kick from the flavors and hops hit as well, but I think that's to be expected after the nose. Really light mouthfeel - crisp and refreshing without being too heavy. I think amber is a great category for the ale, as I feel like the hops MIGHT classify it as an IPA, but it really doesn't have that heaviness.  Ultimately, a delicious brew. Grab em if you see em. They are well worth the try.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

The smell of this beer is absolutely fantastic. Straight grapefruit and citrus, with a little hint of pine. Definitely a lot of hops in this one.  The taste is not as outrageously hoppy as the smell. There is somewhat doughy taste, backed by the definite citrus from the hops.  Very thin in the mouth, with a bit of bitterness that lingers behind for quite some time.  Very drinkable.

Potent scents of peach and citrus hops jump out and infiltrate the nose.  T- Really unique. On first taste, presence of earthy, citrus hops blow up in the mouth. The bitter hops carry throughout the finish, but are accompanied with malts of bread like characteristics. Unlike anything I have had before.  M- Smooth, delicious, perfect. Nice amount of carbonation with a thin to medium body feel.  D- This is one drinkable brew. I could honestly put my 6-pack away in one sitting.  Overall, drink this one fresh!!!

Poured into my Sharp Edge Over the Edge goblet a clear amber red with a thick frothy and soapy white head. The head thins down in size but is still thick and clings to the side of the glass. Right off the bat it smells like someone put the Christmas tree back up. Big pine burst with a sweet, citrus scent in the back. The taste isn't as strong on the pine but its there with mostly a sweet citrus that coats the inside of my mouth. A dry hop aftertaste and an oily coating in mt mouth.

Lacing is very wet, yet holds to the glass long after the beer is complete. A different type of lacing that I have only seen on a few beers before, very moist looking not ""foamy"" like other beers.  s- the smell was my first indication of what I was in for. first smell is without a doubt grapefruity. slight outdoor foresty smell. some other citrus notes such as lemon and orange can be smelt, leaving a nice tangy smell.  t- nothing short of amazing. grapfruity, citrusy, with a definite bitter hop finish. slightly sweeter than other ambers/IPAS, but a very pleasant taste and aftertaste.  m- very smooth with not-so-aggressive carbonation. I think that they could have carbonated a tad more to give it a more shocking mouthfeel, but I was impressed in the fact that this beer goes down very smooth.  d- very drinkable, which is upsetting because I only picked up a sixer....must find more!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

It has an aroma of citrus hops with malts coming through it. The hops dominate incredibly though.The taste is mind blowing! The hops are show cased, just like the smell, but the malts, biscuit and carmel, are there to keep everything balanced. I would say this is a IPA that the malts are kicked up more to balance the hops and alcohol. There is a fair amount of alcohol in it, and I couldn't drink the nectar like hopback.

The hops are citrusy, plentiful, sharp, spicy, bitter, imparting a little bit of pineapple like in the aroma. Both the bitterness and flavor is on the high end. Full bodied, with citrus fruit lingering for a while after each sip.  Certainly one of the more sought out ultra-hoppy beers. Plenty of hop flavor and bitterness without it becoming overwhelming.

694,15881,TheycallmeTim,4.2,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into an American pint glass.  A--Two finger white dense foamy head floating on a little more orange than pure amber body. Body actually is a lot like Sierra Nevada pale ale, except a little more yellow in the orange than red, which is weird because this is supposed to be an amber and that's supposed to be a pale ale. What are you gonna do? Nice dishsoap spotty lacing and it only takes a swirl in the glass to get the foam working again. Lively and inviting bubbles.  S--When cold, oranges, pure juicy valencia sweet oranges--almost more like the oil in the rind smell than the smell of juice. As it warms the nose opens up considerably to give you some other citric notes, with brighter tangy grapefruit sneaking in there and even, if you've ever had them, kumquats. I hope that's not too esoteric, but seriously: I've only had them once, but that's nearly exactly the smell on this as it warms. Anyway, bottom line is lots of citrus, low on floral, and some more skunky/catty odors creep in as it warms. Gets kind of, well, urinal smelling underneath all that sweet, which I kind of like, though I feel a little weird admitting it.  T--While I think the nose was not as impressive as SN's Wet Hope Harvest, which is such a hop bouquet that you can actually pluck out the scent of individual flowers, the taste on this one beats it by a whisker. Especially when it gets to cellar temperature, this sucker proves to be a hop bomb on some high-grade LSD; this is a seriously beefed-up beer. Aside from the obvious citric notes up front, there's plenty more cat pee ushering in next (but only when not really cold), with a middle palate of /fantastic/ crackery malt that's just right for everything around it, as well as a touch of caramel. The finish is long, smooth, and dry, somewhere between fresh sawdust and pinetar. Smack smack smack, sip sip sip. The thing I love best about this beer is you can almost taste the three hop varieties separately and distinctly working on regions of your tongue and mouth. A dry, but not really bitter, citric brew with plenty of malt in the middle.  Mouthfeel is creamy, again the comparison to SN pale I hope is not getting old, because that's what it reminded me of, which is high praise in my books. Drinkability is average, really, at seven and a half. Despite the suck and squeeze every last drop of flavor from one ingredient motif, I think this highly impressive brewery could get more flavor out of less boozy.

Pure, fresh, hops...almost like Marijuana. Otherwise the only thing that comes through is a little sweetness.  t - Again, liquid hops. The taste is great but I'm really not getting that bite that I'm expecting from a 90+ IBU brew. There is a bite but it doesn't seem to match the bark, must be a lot of dry hopping going on. But that's not to say a hop head wouldn't enjoy this. Drys out toward the end, not much malt to back it up, unbalanced like the style calls for.  m/d - Nothing much to say here, feels fine...doesn't strike me as thick or thin.

694,15881,Hojaminbag,5,"Nugget Nectar is good, really good. This sample was on tap at the brewery. Here's what I have to say about my favorite beer:  Think about being on a desert island in the extreme heat, dying of thirst.  But then imagine a genie appears and offers you, instead of three wishes, a choice of three items: A glass to catch rain in, a drink of nugget nectar, or some water that could save your life. What do you do? You brain that son of a bitch genie with a rock and take all three items. You use the water to wash the glass to make sure it is completely clean. Then you pour the water out in your excitement because drinking it would take too long and only delay your drinking of the Nugget Nectar. You pour the Nugget Nectar into the glass, so as to appropriately release the aroma. It is not the best smelling beer on earth, it is the best smelling THING on earth. You weep as you drink the beer, out of sadness that you can't have anymore and due to its perfection. It is like a religious experience, you are reborn in the face of Nugget Nectar.  When you're finished you break the glass (after licking it clean), because you can't bear to drink anything else out of that glass ever again, because it would only remind you of the sad memory that the glass no longer held the most bestest beer ever.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

A- Pours a ridiculously clear light orange/amber, with a white head that leaves a wonderful lacing on the side of my glass. S- Hops. Lots of hops. Pine, citrus, and a quite a bit of grapefruit. It's nice when the label does the beer justice. T- At first the pine/citrus/grapefruit hops slame you right out of the gate, but trust me, that's a good thing. As the beer warms the malty/biscuity (is that even a word?) backbone starts to peek through. All in all, a delicious beer. M- Medium to light body, with the little carbonation. I was expecting heavier, but was pleasantly surprised. D- Dear lord, I could drink this all night. The higher ABV would kick me in the ass, but it would be well worth it.  Overall, fantastic beer. If you can get a hand on this one, make sure you get two. Or six. It's well balanced, drinkable, and just plain delicious.

694,15881,Brewnami,4.27,"Bought this beer on recommendation from a fellow beer advocate member. Very happy I listened. This beer tastes similar to an IPA, but not as bitter and a bit heavier. Smells of citrus fruits, piney hops, and malt. Very well balanced flavor. Very flavorful; hoppy, but not very bitter. Very sweet and malty. This is a really unique brew. I will absolutely purchase this again if I come across it again as I just bought the last six pack in the store. Great beer for IPA fans even though its a red ale. Stick with a six pack though, not a very good session brew.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

S - Very aromatic and juicy, with sweet toffee, pine, orange, pineapple, and some biscuity malt in the background.  T - Luscious caramel and biscuity malts are easily overshadowed by a huge hop bill. Hints of sweet grapefruit juice, orange zest, pineapple, and mango. Aggressive hop bitterness comes in early and never leaves, building on itself over time. Pleasant, dryish finish.

694,15881,CoolJosh,4.22,"Picked up a case at Hickey's today for $36 a case, I have been waiting for a fresh Nugget Nectar for way too long.  Poured into my Penn State pint glass. A very pale light pink lemonade in color. The color Reminds me of the inside of a grapefruit. The body is incredibly clear and translucent. There is a creamier off white head from pour, that doesn't last for too long but leaves some decent lacing on the side of the glass.  The smell is very soft and refreshing, with tons of citrus notes. Lots of lemons are present, and there is definitely some noticeable grapefruit scents as well. The hops are very smoothed out, and incredibly sweet but slightly dry scent. Very simple, which is the way it ought to be for the style.  Very sweet grapefruit at the beginning of the sip which leads into some lemon tastes. Next comes a spectacular onset of spicy citrus hops that peak very nicely. Following the hop kick, comes a very dry white grape presence that creates a beautiful finish. There is some slight graininess in the texture, but for the most part this is an incredibly light easy to drink and refreshing beer.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

694,15881,TheMistler,4.24,"Poured a clear orange with a puffy white head. Good retention, eventually settling to a whispy cap and solid ring that evidences pretty good lacing.  A sticky hop aroma. I think someone could be forgiven for thinking they were about to drink grapefruit juice. Grassy, just a slight touch spicy, too. As it warmed up pine became more noticeable. Every hop characteristic possible seems to evidence itself. Malt in the background, maybe caramel.  Biscuit notes, but as with the smell, they play distinct second fiddle to a variety of hop flavors. Grapefruit and orange cover the citrus. Some grass. There is some bittering left on the palate, but the beer finishes surprisingly clean.  Spritzy feel initially, there is some resin-y slipperiness as well.  Very nice flavor. While it is a hop-bomb, it doesn't hit you over the head or seem one-note, because of its full hop profile.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Clear amber beer with a big, fluffy, sticky head.  Big, citrusy hops in the nose.  Bitter hops immediately followed by a balance of silky smooth maltiness.  The alchohol at 7.5% is completely hidden in the massive amount of hops and malt.  This beer is incredibly hoppy and bitter while being extremely well balanced and unbelievably drinkable. Hats off to the creator of this brew.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,froggyfrog,4.59,"Digging into my first case of this year's Nectar it occurred to me that I have never actually reviewed this beer. So I resolved to hammer out some quick notes to rectify this deficiency. I went to my Troegenator mug for the occasion.  This ""amber"" ale has a noticable yellow Pils-derived base color underneath the blatant orange and an unshakable thin white head. Clarity is the only reason for detraction in this category as there a haziness to this filtered beer which dulls the fiery orange in the glass.  Aroma is breathtaking. This beer smells more of hops than the bags of actual hops that I have downstairs in the freezer. I guess it's a miracle of the hopback and/or dry hopping, but this brew is so incredibly dank with grassy/catty/piney/citric hop volatiles as to almost defy logic.  On the tongue this beer delivers the dream. Working in concert with the amazingly hop-packed aroma, flavors of malt husk and light caramel shine through along with plenty of hop flavor and a solid level of bitterness that stands up well to the aggressive cottony sweetness of the malt.  MF is a treat. At once resiny and alcohol-slick, there is a silkiness from the residual sugars cut through to the core by the appreciable IBUs in the finish.  Drinkability. Huh. As far as ease of drinking goes, others have noted that this is not a session beer, and by definition I would be forced to agree. However I have very often found myself sailing through bottle after bottle of this stuff in rapid succession. I am by no means a lush, mind you. Most nights I will spend hours with just a single bomber, but this beer gets me moving. I just can't seem to get enough Nectar, though sometimes the alcohol gets in the way of my gluttony.

S-Hop and citrusy IPA smell with some sweet malts peeking through.  T-Grapefruit citrus and pine resin hops dominate at first with malts kicking in to provide a balance that is very enjoyable. Lingering mild hop bitterness in the finish.  M-Medium mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Well balanced overall.  D-This is an extremely drinkable beer that I would not really classify as an amber ale, as it leans more to the IPA realm to me, albeit with a bit of malts thrown in. Also, a great mid session transition beer in either direction.  I have been meaning to try this for awhile, and am happy that I did. This one bridges the gap for those times when a hop bomb is a bit much and malty sweetness is not the order of the day. It definately leans to the hop side, but does so in a very refined and tasty way. In some ways reminds me a bit of Arrogant Bastard, with a bit more of a citrus bite.

694,15881,Pinto21,4.85,"Poured a pretty pretty red amber pretty. It just looks fantastic pouring it out of the growler. Nice head to it as well.  Smells of citrus hops with malts coming through it. The hops dominate though.  Taste is mind blowing! The hops are show cased, just like the smell, but the malts, biscuit and carmel, are there to keep everything balanced. I would say this is a IPA that the malts are kicked up more to balance the hops and alcohol. I'm not a huge fan of most IPA because of this lack of balance. That being said I think this is the best beer that I have had.  There is a fair amount of alcohol in it, and I couldn't drink the nectar like hopback. I wouldn't want to though.

Next up is a mix of some sweeter malts followed by some more hops with an orange-like flavor. The earthly floral hops end the beer, leaving a slightly bitter finish.

694,15881,Thesoundandthefury,4.35,"Just picked up a case of Nugget Nectar the other day. For mid 40's, this beer is a steal.  A- Poured this lovely dark honey colored nectar into a tulip glass. It has a red tint to it. It produces 2 fingers of head which fades down to about a half an inch that slowly fades as it holds onto the inner walls of the glass as I drink it.  S- Lots of fresh hops. More hops. Pine, and floral notes. It just smells fresh and lively.  T- Great bitter hop flavors right from the initial sip. Some light pine and citrus notes creep in and out. The dryness to this brew makes you want to take another sip as soon as your done with the first. There is a faint sweetness mid palate that is ever so elusive. It comes and goes at random times. The finish is hoppy, bitter, with hints of pine and grapefruit making appearances as well.  M- The mouthfeel of NN is somewhat oily and slick, thin, but not too thin, dry, and the carbonation is just enough to keep things exciting.  D- Yeah, one sip of this and you want to take another, and another, and another. NN can gIet you in trouble though at 7.5% alcohol. A VERY drinkable beer.  This is a great beer from my home state.

Very nice white foam head, I get anywhere from one to two fingers depending on the poor. Lacing down the glass is perfect, a nice web from top to bottom, all the way around. Little carbonation bubbles shooting up the middle of the glass during the entire drink help maintain minimal head on the surface.  Smell: Hops Hops Hops! Very floral aroma, like HopBack on steroids. This is a very fresh bottle (bottle 1 week ago) and you can tell.  Taste: Reminds me vividly of some of the better Double IPA's I've had. A good bitter taste right off the bat with citrus and grapefruit notes. Some lingering hop bitterness and a reasonable malt backbone.  Mouthfeel: Lingering bitterness, finishes a tad thin and goes down real easy. Piney/oily hop feel lingers on the tongue. The 95IBU's are not overbearing by any means. The carbonation is perfect and balances out the whole experience.  Drinkability: Well balanced, very well hidden alcohol content.

T: Tastes just like you'd expect from the smell. It has a very citrusy floral aromatic taste to it. It's hard to explain. You can definitely tell this beer has hop back at its roots. It's like Hop Back X 2.  M: Mouth feel is just perfect to me. A little thick. It just coats your tongue which is a good thing. Not too thick not too thin. Just perfect  D: Almost too drinkable at 7.5%. It is quite bitter at 95 IBU but you hardly ever notice because the aromatic hop flavor takes it over and that is perfectly balanced by the malt. Once you finish your first bottle you are just begging to taste that flavor again. It's hard to stop drinking to be honest.  Bottom Line: One of my favorite beers I've tried. If you are a hop head definitely try to get your hands on this beer. It's worth checking out. Even if you aren't I still recommend checking this beer out.

694,15881,funckygibbon,5,"WARNING* - bias: This is my favorite beer of all time.  What is this spring you speak of? Ohhh, you mean Nugget Nectar season! I await this beer's release with great anticipation, and immiediately rush to Zeno's pub in State College in early February to get it on tap (then have a back up stock at home!).  Pours a deep orangish amber, with a somewhat off white head. Consistent lacing occurs. I don't get much time to view this however, as this beer's heavy hop nose permeates around the vicinity. Whoa. Now i know why hops is related to cannabis. With five types of hops (If i'm not mistaken) blended carefully into this beer, you get a mix of floral, grapefruit, and yes, cannabis-like smells intoxicating the palette before you even take any in. I find myself spending a great deal of time smelling this beer, almost between every swig.  When the smell of a beer is as strong as this one, you can only hope the taste will follow up. Nugget Nectar does so and then some. The taste is amazingly balanced, and highly complex, with esters and different distinct flavors occurring in stages. Initially, you are hit with the 93 IBU's of the hops, as one would expect for this beer type. As I tell folks who don't like hops as much as I do, this beer quickly will show them mercy, as the bitterness quickly is pulled away to reveal a flurry of grapefruit and floral flavors, riding along mellow but ever present malt backbone. Finally post swallow, you are left with all this pleasantness and just a slight puckering bitterness that I must keep renewing throughout the night.  Mouth feel is something that, in my opinion, you can only be negative about when it doesn't compliment the beer's flavor, or type. Nugget Nectar is ever so slightly on the ""thicker"" side, with moderate-heavy carbonation that livens it up quite nicely. Perfect for the beer that it is.  The final note- This beer is almost TOO drinkable. Weighing in at 7.5 Abv, It masks this strength amazingly well, so I often find myself drinking wayyyy more than I plan. Can't complain about that though!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

694,15881,MiguelMandingo,4.14,"Just got this as an extra in a trade. Thanks Steve!  Poured a 12oz. bottle into a snifter.  Appearance - Pours into the glass an amber copper orange color. It is hazy and translucent. The brew produced a 1/2 finger head at best and quickly dissipated to a spotty crown. It leaves spotty light lacing behind as well. A swirl of the glass brings the head back for a few moments and then quickly dissipates once more.  Smell - The smell is pretty good. The malt build and hops notes are in pretty good balance here. I can detect notes of candied orange primarily, intermingled with apricot, along with notes of sweet grapefruit and distant pine. The malts scents peak through with notes of caramel, honey, and light toast.  Taste - The taste is almost as good as the smell, but not quite. The candied orange and apricot i detected in the scent is a bit more muted in the actual flavor. The hop flavor is smooth and carries throughout. There is a nice bitterness that rounds out the flavor. The malt build helps to balance this one out - tasty caramel and a hint of honey sweetness intermingled with a light toastiness.  Mouthfeel - I wish the mouthfeel was a little more interesting. The carbonation is a little prickly initially, but dies way too fast for my liking. By the time I swallow a sip, it feels like it has no carbonation at all. It has a medium body and feels resinous and oily as it rolls over the tongue.  Drinkability - This is a pretty drinkable brew. I expected more of a hoppy bitterness out of this beer, but it is mostly hop flavor, which I really enjoy. I wish it was a little more lively in the carbonation department, but the smell and the taste make up for it. All in all, this is a pretty good brew. I would search it out again.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

T- First hit on the palate is an explosion of of oranges (how they get these great flavors without using the actual item is impressive) and caramel malts. The mid palate is nicely balanced and finishes with rich citrus and grassy hops.  M- Medium high carbonation with a moderate viscosity. could have a bit more thickness to it.  D- This is one quaffable beverage. Above average balance with a large hop presence. the first time I had this I was nearly as impressed with this as I am this time.

Retention isn't great but the lacing is kinda nice.  Smells mildly of sweet malt and light grassy hop.  Taste is very good. The sweet malt does a nice job of overshadowing the grassy hop so that you get both flavors but the hop doesn't dominate as it does in, say, a Cream ale. Hop is a tiny bit dry but the whole flavor blends very well.  Mouthfeel is good, light bodied with a tad less carbonation than I'd like.  Drinkability is good.

694,15881,OlieIPA,3.86,"Thanks PatronWizard...  A: Huge and frothy head with a nice golden/amber hue. Filtered great!!  S: More sweet then hoppy, which leads me to believe that this bottle may be a little old. Still very appealing.  T: Sublte mix of spices and hop sweetness.  M: Light to medium body...perfect for the style.  D: Perfect for a BBQ and easy on the palate and body.  Overall: A good beer. A try it.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,rudylaw,4.5,"Thanks to mikeraser for this one.  Imperial amber... here we go. Pours, shockingly, amber with a tiny head. Nothing out of the ordinary so far... but I know that's about to change.  This smells of citrus. I agree with other reviewers that at the outset, this is just like an IPA.  I get citrus, hops and smooth malt all the way through. This beer doesn't evolve over the course of consumption... it stays delicious and true to the last drop.  I don't drink many ambers, but this Troegs beer has been on my want list for quite some time. After having one, I'll keep on wanting more. Very refreshing on this Indian Summer evening in the Chi.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Beer-Zombie,4.5,"this beer pours up a murky copper color with a big frothy off white head. decent lacing. the nose is grapefruit, piney hops, alcohol spice, sweet malts. the taste is the same as the nose. Lots of grapefruit in this brew. A very smoothe taste, low carbo, light to medium body. This would make a great session beer if I had it readily available to me here in Tejas!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,spointon,4.3,"Thanks to mikereaser for this trade. I poured this one from a 12oz brown bottle into a tulip pint glass.  A= This ale poured a cloudy glowing orange gold color with a 3/4"" dense white head. The head dropped slowly to a 1/8"" cap that stayed throughout. Loads of lacing down the glass.  S= Sweet bakery malt base with a heavy pine and grapefruit aroma over the top. Lots of estery fruitiness as well.  T= This is a flavor war in each sip. The huge malt backbone tries to make this a sweet and grainy malt bomb. The spicy ""west coast"" hop profile gives this enough base bitterness to call this a hop bomb as well. No matter what you call it, I found this ale to be delicious and well balanced. After the hop/malt battle, the finish is smooth, rich, and not too dry.  MF= I found this ale to be very smooth and slightly to the heavy side of medium bodied. Very mild carbonation adds to the creamy and slightly oily mouthfeel.  D= Though my bottle was just slightly oxidized, I still thought this was an outsanding beer. Like a super malty IPA. I will hopefully have more of this in the not too distant future!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

694,15881,PatronWizard,3.85,"Thanks to a disgustingly generous trade from Kadonny.  Color of orange marmalade. Thin head of medium sized bubbles. Died quickly.  Smells of orange marmalade. Seriously.  Tastes of tea leaves. Not so hoppy. Not hoppy at all in fact. Well maybe a little at the end. Maybe a slight tobacco flavor. Peach too.  Nice and smooth. Refreshing even.  Overall: decent but kind of a let down. Actually at the end of the bottle, I was enjoying it a lot more",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,mentor,4.55,"Huge thanks to BeerWorld for this one. Pours a solid finger of clingy tan head (some orange) over a clear polished copper liquid. Sediment was left in the bottle. Pretty. Smells piney hops, baby aspirin, tangerine, soured mango, and dried out musty leaves.  Tastes potent hop flavor with some hip bitter and supporting mild malt sweet. Mouthfeel is creamy and a significant contributor to the deliciousness of this beer. Wow, that first sip was wonderful. Hop flavor is pine and soured tangerine with some grapefruit pith and grapefruit seed. Hop bitterness is smooth with a spiciness that blends into the alcohol burn. Alcohol is clean of fusels and works with a sour cherry and metalic tang in the finish and lingering aftertaste. Malt flavor is mildly toasted, but quite under the hops. Fruity esters are present way beneath the hops, but are blended and supportive (unripe peach and rich watermelon heart). Smooth creamy mouthfeel just makes this beer. Md-thick and moderate, but sharp, carbonation.  Very complex and very well blended. A top notch american hopped up beer. This beer would be the pride and joy in the line-up of any american brewer.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,bonbini26,4.29,"A- Pours bright dark orange/amber with a thin head that stays with the beer throughout Traces of lacing stick to glass.  S- Strong citrus, grapefruit and lemon. Pine and floral notes also come through.  T- The taste is very citrusy. Sweet, with the hops staying well ahead of the noticeable malt. Pine and floral notes interact well, giving the hop profile a wonderful complexity. This is an amazingly hoppy beer with just enough sweet malt to give it a nice depth and complexity. This is an extreme beer that is crazy hoppy, but still retains a nice malt backbone. A pinch of alcohol lends some spice.  M- Creamy and smooth full body leaves flavors lingering with an alcohol tingle.  D- Smooth drinking, IPA, red ale, w/e you wanna call it, always look forward to this every year, wish it was year-round",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Buebie,4.84,"Thanks jtrockchalk for this extra!  Poured rigerously from a brown 12 oz bottle, with no freshness date, into a snifter.  Brilliant golden transparent copper in color. 2 finger foamy white head. Nice little cake of retention and sticky lace.  Aroma is intoxicating on its own. Sweet tangerine, pine, mild grapefruit, mild peppery scent, raw honey, cloves?  Verry smooth upfront, sweet malts. Hops are almost delicate in flavor, more fresh marmalade, tangerines, pine, fruit rind (grapefruit). The water seems very minerally, in a good way. Reminds me alot of Aquafina, crisp clean delicious water. Some doughy bready flavors, mixed with a carmelly sweet honey. Mouthfeel is creamy and rich, with an oily texture, hop oil? The hops are not overly bitter, sweet wonderful balance. Like a piece of chocolate that you continue to suck on, in hops that it wont dissolve...its like that.  Outstanding brew!

694,15881,ibbjamin,4.29,"Received this brew in a trade with deepsouth. Poured into a stein.  Quarter inch white head that dissipates instantaneously. Transparent amber color. Almost no lacing.  Smells more like an IPA than an Amber to me. Regardless, it smells quality. Some citrus tones, hoppy, some malts to back it up. Quality ingredients.  Hoppy up front. Well balanced brew. Again the quality reigns through.  Medium body. Nice smooth mouthfeel. Very easy to drink.  Highly recommended.

Poured from bottle into a tulip glass  A - Pours a pretty amber orange with a finger or so tall white head that dispated fairly quickly but still leaves a ring of lacing as the level of beer goes down my glass.  S - Very piney hop smell with orange citrus. Slightly earthy as it warms up. Starts the smell a little funky the warmer it gets. I dunno about this one.  T - More piney hop but more of a grapefruit citrus than an orange.  M - Nice mouthfeel. Medium bodied with nice carbonation and slight dryness.  D - Pretty high drinkability for a fairly hoppy brew.  Out of date and still an A-. Review to be edited should I obtain a fresh bottle. Great beer.,Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Delectable scents of juicy, juicy, fresh fruity, spruciness.  The is where this beer really demonstrates its excellence. Solid malt base of lightly sweet caramel drizzled white cake, and lightly toasted bread provide an excellent balance to the awesome hop bill, coming in with fresh oranges, pineapples, and grapefruits, along with rindy and fresh pine needle bitterness.  Medium full body is lightly oily slick and smooth with a perfect amount of creamy-tingly carbonation.  Awesome beer, one of the best amber-ish brews of all time, and probably too deliciously drinkable for it's alcohol content. Well done Troegs.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,PerzentRizen,4.84,"This was the second beer from Troeggs I have had the pleasure of sampling. I loved the Troegganator so this was a logical step. I have to say it was one of my top 10 favorite beers of all time.  I poured this beer into a 16 ounce pint glass and now that I don't have any more I am kicking myself for not using a tupil glass to catch the beautiful piney aromas...stupid! stupid! stupid! Oh well, I'll get more this spring will in Florida.  The carbonation is delightful and I can already tell its going to be delicious because of the piney hop resin smell that I can sense before first sip. A good friend gave me this one and when he handed it to me he said, ""drink this one slowly and savor."" He being a fellow BA and a knowledgable one at that I decided to heed his advice.  From first sip to last this beer is hoppy, but not bitter, refreshing, but not watered down, just plain delicious. If I could only have one beer for the rest of my life this might be it! I loved it.

694,15881,naproxen,4.2,"Ok so I am seriously torn between reviewing this as an 'amber/red ale' or just the damned tasty bevvy it is  fuck it  If you love HopSlam, this is your natural transgression.  The nose on this, and I can say with certainty as I am enjoying 100% side by side, that nugget smells very close to Hopslam. A little maltier, thats all. It is all honey-sugar-malt-hops and that is a good combo (where are my chex mix in this flavor??)  Taste...verrrry smooth. The after taste is earthy hops (p.s. this bottle is 2008 but cellared since July) Nothing horrendously bitter in any respect. September is my 'spring cleaning' so any really hopped up beers are making their debut. Not much else I can sat for the NN that hasn't been commented on, it really is a delicious way to spend a Friday night before gosh darn (eh, am i that lame?) hurricanes come aboard  Honestly it really is a beer I would gladly enjoy 365 days of the year, regardless of season.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Very gentle carbonation activity.  Smell is citrus and pine, a sweet malt and caramel.  Taste is more of the nose. Malt is first. A big and sweet backbone that supports the hops. Breadyness follows. Yeasty fruit esters mix in. Hops are balanced and prominent. Bittering in the finish is mild followed by a biscuity note on the palate. Finish is dry and mellow.  Mouthfeel is creamy and delectable. A smooth carbonation keeps the mouth ready for the next sip. Weight medium and perfect for andy season.  Drinkability is superb.

Once it settles, a ring of foam is retained around the edge.  Had a very floral and herblike aroma. What you would expect from a beer with a nugget on the label.  Extremely hopped but doesn't linger as long as other hoppy beers do. That helps a lot with the drinkability.

694,15881,TATTORSO,3.97,"12 fl. oz. into my 8 oz. Peroni stange.  A ~ A strong pour produced an appealing amber glowing beer, almost a hazy iced tea color with a moderate head & nice, sticky lacing.  S ~ BIG Hops with notes of citrus rind, warm biscuits, malt & a touch of smoke.  T ~ A nice balance of sweet & bitter with gobs of layered hops that are distinctly featured & separated. A little smokey, with hints of malty grains on the front side & just bitter enough at the end (for me) at ""93ish"" IBU's. Nice & dry on the finish with a lingering snap on the tongue.  M ~ Cool & crisp ~ full bodied with a sparkling carbonation that enhances the complex 3 hop blend nicely. Smooth & creamy at first. A slightly bitter, astringent finish. A touch of warmth on the swallow ~ the 7.5% ABV is well masked.  D ~ While I'm still developing an appreciation for hops I found this intriguing & was left wanting more.

694,15881,Moxley,4.41,"I have to first say that this beer received a ton of hype from my drinkin' buddies Hyland and Pleepleus. I still hadn't tried it when it went out of circulation for the season. Luckily my good buddy Hyland had one tucked in the very dark corner of his basement beer fridge and was kind enough to share it with me.  So please keep in mind this is a very important review you're about to read.  A - Poured an amber color with a bit of haziness about it. No head to speak of.  S - Christmas morning. Or, well, how it would smell if you were sitting in your Christmas tree on Christmas morning. Lots of pine and hops. Very interesting.  T - Not disappointed. Great beer. Probably, no definitely the best I've had of it's kind. Like a mouth full of hops and pine. I know that sounds gross, but it's actually really refreshing and delicious. I'm sure this is a beer enjoyed by Mr. Christmas himself on those cold nights he spends flying around delivering cases of this delicious nectar to all us good boys and girls - wouldn't that be great!?  M&D - Well balanced, good hop/bitter quality on the finish, but not pucker bitter. Just right.  Keep up the good work Troegs. I'll be making a visit to your brewery very soon!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,GreatPondBrewer,4.42,"This beer was an absolute godsend. My good friend brought it back to Korea after a trip home to the states. It was one of the beers I hadn't even asked for, but after the guy at the store saw the list I had furnished my friend he picked out that some more hops wouldn't hurt.  The beer poured out a deep copper color with a spot of yellow tinted white head atop. This slowly receded into a slick of bubbles that remained with some considerable lacing sticking to the side of my glass. The nose on this beer was outstanding with deep rolling notes of pine hops mixed with just the slightest bit of caramel maltiness and a slightly boozy effect with a deep pull of air. The first blush revealed an immensely full bodied flavor mixing a sharp alcohol with grapefruit and pine hop flavoring and just the hint of malty backbone that any ""imperial"" should possess. The carbonation was nice and gentle leaving a creamy and altogether pleasing effect on my mouth. It was slightly warming in the finish and the perfect beer to drink in the humid monsoon of the Korean summer. After consideration I would say that this beer reminds me of a slightly higher octane version of Victory's Hop Devil. Simply delightful. If I could get a few cases of this shipped to me here life would be just about complete!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Head dissipates into a thin layer of bubbles on top, and the lacing is pretty good.  Smells both sweet and hoppy. It really is a good balance between the two. Could be just a little more intense.  Taste is good. Lots of stuff going on, it's sweet and hoppy, hoppy at first, then sweet, then hoppy again. Really nice.  As good as the taste is, the mouthfeel is the best thing about this beer. It's smoother than a baby's bottom.  The smoothness makes this a very drinkable beer. The taste and smell certainly don't lessen the resume.

694,15881,Reagan1984,4.82,"Thank you to Redmagik99 for providing the information that led me to try this beer. It was worth the effort and I can't wait for the next release.  There were several people who even suggested that I avoid the beer since it was released last winter and suggested that the hop aroma and flavor will have faded significantly. Well if what I tasted was faded hops and what I smelled was diminished aroma then I REALLY can't wait to try a fresh one this winter.  Again, another beer lives up to the hype. It's a great one. I was lucky enough to secure 4 bottles and have shared one with a friend and enjoyed the other last night. (Savored is probably a better word)  I enjoyed this beer in a tulip glass to hopefully highlight the aroma. After pouring there was a thick 1 ½ finger head that slowly faded back into the beer. The color was quite bright Reddish/Amber with loads of orange highlights. It was slightly cloudy. There was a pretty good amount of lacing.  Aroma was Pine, Pine, beautiful pine, huge and fresh. Also a sharp citrus aroma that was sweeter smelling than just grapefruit. Really an amazing aroma.  When considering the taste the first thing I thought and wrote was ""candy like"" and that's meant to be a compliment. This does not describe the beer as too sweet, it's not. But it just takes over like a great treat. At first the taste was of tropical fruit with some nice complexity. I can't really identify a specific fruit, perhaps very ripe mango. Then a pine/hop bitterness enters the scene and really balances the flavor very well. It's really wonderfully balanced. Nice deep flavor that you could think about.  Actually had a bit of a lighter mouth feel than I had expected. But still nice. Drinkability isn't really the question here. It's how do I get more of this when it returns this winter.  Awesome beer and an instant classic on my list of personal favorites.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Lacing seems like it is going to stick around in patches on the sides of my glass.  S- Very sweet caramel malts mingling with the hoppy aromas on first sniff. Deeper into the smell, you will find piney notes, citrus, and a subtle alcohol warming effect.  T- After first taste, I really want to just quit reviewing this beer; I actually just want to be selfish and give it my TOTAL attention. What a nice brew...Pleasantly malty, bittering hop not too overwhelming but balanced. The same citrus and pine carry right over from the hops. The finish is somewhat dry especially compared to how sweet it starts. The alcohol warmth brings up the rear.  M- Medium in the mouth and the carbonation is nice and tingly.  D- I don't think I really need to say anything...amazing beer. I really dont like amber styles, or should I say I really didn't like them until today.

694,15881,CrellMoset,4.23,"My last bottle from a sixer picked up at Market Street Wine (uptown location) in Charlottesville, VA. Poured into a traditional American pint glass.  Appearance: A gorgeous, hazy beer - the body of which ranges in color from yellow around the edges to orange to reddish amber at the heart - with a slightly off-white one-and-a-half finger head that leaves huge swaths of sticky lacing as it recedes.  Aroma: One of the most ""biscuity"" beers I've ever stuck my nose into. Huge roasted caramel grainyness comes out strong, but wham, there's the hops! Overwhelming floral hop goodness, with hints of citrus and a soupcon of pine.  Taste: Amazingly balanced, much like the nose - it really is precisely halfway between an amber and an IPA, with both aspects coming through very strongly. Great citrus hop notes - grapefruit and orange oils, some floral notes - and a solid but not overwhelming bitterness that manages to balance a metric tonnage of sweet, bready caramel malt. No hint of alcohol, despite the unusually high abv% for the style. Incredibly impressive.  Mouthfeel: Uneven and verrry oily. Resinous and syrupy in places, but medium-bodied.  Drinkability: An outstanding brew that's unbelievably delicious. At 7.5% abv, it's a little high for an amber, but who cares? It's expertly balanced, complex, and smooth. Highly recommended.

694,15881,kkosmoski,4.57,"I am updating my review with a much fresher bottle from the 2009 batch. Ratings will be changed to reflect this year's brew. The first obvious difference from last year is the clarity of this year's batch - it is crystal. Aroma is all about the hops - floral, citrus, lemon. It smells like there is a handful of hops steeping in this beer - its amazing. Flavor is very fresh and bright with intense hop tones of orange, grapefruit, pine, and herbs. Also a bit of toasty malt to supplements the hops. This beer drinks great for a lover of the hop.  I am glad I was able to get my hands on some of this in a fresh state this year. This was a good beer with seven months on it, but it is exceptional fresh. The fresher you can drink it the better. ___  Poured from the bottle into a tulip-type glass. Bottled on date is 12/31/2007, so this one has a bit of age on it. The beer sat in the glass a cloudy, orange-tinged amber, and the white head fell down to barely a coating after a couple of minutes. Aroma was pungent and piney with some citrus rind, but a bit more subdued than suspected. Flavors started off with a sharp but pleasant citrus pith bite, which smoothed out but lingered through to the finish and was topped off ever so slightly by a medium caramel taste. Feel in the mouth was medium-full and had a sharp bite of carbonation. For my taste, the drinkability of this beer is very good - I could drink it all night!  Considering this bottle was 7 months old, I missed out on alot of the nice fresh and dominating hop character of this beer. It was still there, just not quite on the level as it once was. Even so, this was a intensely hoppy ale that is very well done and enjoyable. I would pick this out of a hoppy crowd.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,maximum12,4.42,"Thanks to marcpal for shipping this to me as an extra, my first nugget.  Not surprisingly, this pours amber, although it's on the pale side. Smell is one of the strongest I've experienced, it came washing out of the glass without me having to sniff for it. Overwhelming smell of hops.  Tastes less like a red & more like an IPA with a faint reddish character in the aftertaste. Strong hops taste upfrontto complement the nose, with a good bite that's not too bitter but balanced nicely. One note: as the beer warmed a little & I warmed to the oddly mixed styles, this beer tasted better & better.  Mouthfeel is rich, drinkability is high, going down nice & easy. Frankly I really like the balance of Red/IPA, & don't think I've had another beer that succeeded in walking this line.

694,15881,bkett01,4.12,Big thanks to CoreyRhoads for this one...  Half inch frothy white head on this one after pouring it into a pint glass. Color is a clear ruby/amber with a good deal of carbonation making it's way up.  Smell is not as hoppy as I'd imagined it would be as I detect only a mild layer of hops. They are more detectable in the taste as piney hops balance nicely with a bready malt. It leaves quite the layer of lacing on the glass and is very drinkable.  Definitely going to seek out some more of this next time I'm in PA. Solid IPA.,Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,everetends,4.6,"12 oz bottle thanks to AmishT and BamaBeerBuff convincing him of my worthiness. Poured into a shaped pint.  A: Poured a nice copper color, clear with some carbonation bubble activity. Poured a good size head that receeded down to a white ring. The head produced some soapy lacing that really sticks to the glass leaving a web like/helix trace on the glass.  S: Hops. Big, sweet, floral hops. As the brew warms we can get some sweet malt, orange rind. So nice.  T: The taste is of some sweet, floral hops. The hops really shine here because they don't have crazy bitterness. The bitterness is there but is very well balanced with some sweet, caramel, malt. Brown sugar comes across a touch. Alcohol does rear its head but still nice.  M: Medium bodied brew that has amazing creaminess. This beer really sticks to your mouth and brings the flavors out. Alcohol burn sits on the back of the throat, but works well.  D: Great drinkability. Easy to drink because the balance is damn near perfect. I could drink a sixer of this in a sitting with no problem. I would be drunk, but I would be happy. Amazing beer.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Damian,4.33,"Drank from a 12 FL. OZ. bottle Bottled 02/11/08 Served in a tumbler Acquired in a trade with adamharbaugh  Poured a crystal clear, copper-orange with a tight, foamy, off-white, two-finger head that faded to a lasting cap. Excellent retention. Lots of sudsy looking lacing trickled down the glass and lasted long after the beer was finished.  The aroma was hoppy and fruity with a noticeable toasted malt sweetness. As the beer warmed, the orangey, citrusy-ness of the hops really came out. A touch of brown sugar was perceivable as well.  The taste was similar to the aroma but perhaps a bit more forward. Hoppy and fruity with a stiff malt backbone. Semi-sweet initially, with creamy, rich, caramel malts appearing up front. Ever so quietly, the malts ushered in a blanket of juicy hops. The hops were quite citrusy and a touch spicy. This citrus-like, candied orange quality intensified greatly as the beer warmed. The semi-piney/grapefruity finish provided an unexpected zing to this seemingly balanced IPA. A bit of alcohol warming was noticeable as well. Notes of caramel malt sweetness lingered in the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel was creamy and smooth with a fine, moderate carbonation. Medium bodied.  This beer was not as extreme as I was anticipating it to be. It was however a well balanced, highly flavorful, dangerously drinkable and incredibly solid all-around brew that is worthy of the praise it receives.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Goliath,4.2,"Pours a beautiful deep amber color with an nich of slightly yellowed head. Good retention and some fine lacing.  The aroma is delicous. A great hoppiness showing some nice citrus notes. A little sweetness in there too.  Taste is very nice. A good hoppiness showing a great citrus quality. Well balanced and very pleasing.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice carbonation tingle.  Drinkability is fairly high. Easy to consume, great flavor, and moderate alcohol all combine to make a great beer.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,SQNfan,3.88,This poured a light copper in color with a medium fluffy head of fine white bubbles. Aromas were of herbs followed by citrus and finishing with a bunch of sweet caramel. In the mouth it is meidum-bodied and well-balanced with balancing malt in the midpalate which fades toward hops in the dry and bitter finish.,Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Timmush,4.43,"Finally.... Finally I got my hands on some of this. I had the opportunity to buy some at OAK TREE months ago and passed, I have regretted that ever since. Luckily I had a friend on the lookout for it and he picked it up at a bar. I got 2 six's of it and want more. This tastes like a Pale Ale / medium bodied, with an orange color. There is a mix of of hops, and citrus, and floral overtones. Most prevelant is the HOPS and the grapefruit taste. To me it is a cross between Sierra Nevade Pale Ale and Hop Devil. Very Good.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Med,4.75,"Pours a lovely crystal clear deep amber with a nice two finger creamy off white head that never completely goes away and leaves nice lacing. Hops are very much at the forefront. Lots of citrus and a fair amount of floral notes. No perceivable alcohol but some of the sweet malt comes through (but just a bit). Taste follows the aroma with plenty of hops, but this really is an imperial amber, not an IPA, and the malts come through bold and slightly sweet. Finish is just bitter enough and stays right on the tongue. Mouth is medium creamy and has very pleasant carbonation. I love this beer. I'm glad they don't make it year 'round because I might not buy much else. I can't wait until next year!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,punkindrublic50,4.55,"Speaking as someone who doesn't normally care for hoppy beers Nugget Nectar is absolutely delicious and I highly recommend it to beer drinkers everywhere. Tastes pretty much like what the picture on the bottle shows - like someone managed to squeeze all of the oily essence out of some hops and bottle it up. Somehow not overpowering while maintaining its intensity, a hint of citrus from the hops used and a creamy texture add up to a brew I cant wait to have more of in the future!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,johannasclimacus,4.59,"I finally tried my one bottle of Nugget Nectar that I have been saving from a mix-six pack that I split with a friend. I was worried that between how hyped I was from reading about Nugget Nectar online and how long I had been waiting to try my one bottle that I would expect too much and be disappointed.  Well, I was wrong. This is truly an exceptional beer. The look is a pretty amber with an orange tint, and the taste is what really impresses me (as it should!). Troegs has done a wonderful job of working the hops into a very strong taste presence but yet avoiding the overpowering taste of hops that goes with other examples of the style. I also picked up a good bit of citrusy smells and tastes.  The drinkability of this is insanely high for a 7.5 beer. If I am lucky enough to get more soon, it will be something I have to watch out for, as I can see myself easily putting down several of these in a row. My only regret is that it was the only bottle of this that I had.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,tdrshayden,4.32,"Deep Orange, puffy white head that clings to the glass. Faint malty aroma but with a ton of citrusy hops.

694,15881,corey0212,4.81,"Thanks to yaddy44 for this!  Pours a slightly hazed amber/orange color, minimal head and lacing. Smell is an amazing bouquet (yeah, I just said bouquet) of citrusy hops. Taste is just brilliantly hoppy, crazy juicy citrus notes, some great bitterness on the back end. Good mouthfeel, really pretty refreshing and crisp. This is my second bottle of this...I've got one left, and I'll be actively searching out more. If this was available locally, I'd have it in my fridge all the time. One of the more enjoyable beers I've had.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Scrumtralecent,4.45,"A: Poured into a pint glass a very dark amber/orange. Quite clear with a soft white head that left some lacing along the glass as it disappeared. I really enjoy the look of this, seems like a very refreshing beer just from sight.  S: I feel like a mixture of grains and hops come pouring out of this smell with very little to stand up to it. Very profound nose to this and gives this beer alot of character along with the appearance.  T: The taste does not disappoint. The bitter hops hit first and smooth out with the maltier side. Very wonderful combo of red ale meets imperial ipa. Brings that hoppy attitude you find at the beginning of iipa's, but then smooths it out into a refreshing red ale in the end.  F: Feel is medium with the carbonation playing the biggest part in the feel. The carbonation will dance on the tongue for as long as you let it, giving the hops some more bite if you so desire. Goes down very smooth. Overall, a good feel.  D: This beer is one I could have multiples of, especially on a day like today after work. Right from the pour it looks refreshing and the taste will not only refresh, but also keep you interested. I would seek this beer out again.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

A great tasting first sip. Mild spice up front with a nice bitter hop bite...grapefruit is there. A light buttery taste is there towards the end and then finshes with the hops at the end.

T- Nice very nice some citrus from grapefruit to piney hops, also some caramel malts. Overall this is wonderful brew and well balanced. Taste pretty close to an IPA but just a little different a lot of hops.  M- Light to medium in body probably closer to medium. Good carbonation.  D- Incredible.

Poures a amber color with a serious fluffy foamy pink head that leaves some nice thick fat lace on the glass. Smell is very piny and earthy with hints of summer breeze, herbal flowers. Taste is right on cue with a hoppy fluffy bitterness, sweet honey like taste with a mouth watering finish, the resin stayed for a while on my tongue.

Pours a cloudy reddish/orange, has the look of DAA (Double American Amber)  Cant smell much on this beer right now. Thats probably a casulty of it being old. It has hints of sweet malt and citrusy hops.  This beer tastes amazing, it probably has lost a little of its bite. But again, sweet malt, nice hop count. Bitter, stinging Orangey, very good. I bet this fresh is amazing.  Lingering sweet aftertaste.  Great beer, good times. Get this one fresh, it's still good now though. Kinda like Curt Schilling.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,BamaBeerBuff,4.63,"A: An orange-copper with a thick, creamy orange tinted head that retains nicely and leaves some thick lacing on the glass. Very impressive appearance.  S: Rich grapefruit hop aroma with notes of floral and herbal hops, as well. Believe it or not, some caramel malts are present, as well.  T&M: Rich floral, herbal hop aromas complemented nicely by some citrusy grapefruit flavors. A nice underlying smooth maltiness allows the hops to shine through whilst still maintaining a semblance of balance. Body is medium with a decent carbonation that works well. The finish is somewhat sticky and pleasant.  D: Despite the higher ABV, I'm giving this a 5. Nugget Nectar is a hop bomb, but I sucked this one down in under 5 minutes. It's just so delicious and not overpoweringly bitter that nothing under a 5 would suffice for a drinkability score.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Orange/pineapple and slightly piney. Also some sweet malty tones. Tastes like grapefruit and citrus juice with some sweet malty ballance throughout and a bitter finish in a good way.

T: Again hops dominate, but the malts balance it nicely. Sweet and delicious. Finishes slightly bitter, but in a very good way.  M: Medium body beer, just the right amount of carbonation, excellent.

T - Light candy sweetness initially that is quickly overcome by a big citrus and tropical fruit taste. Lots of grapefruit, mango, and even a hint of orange. The malts are present with hints of caramel primarily, but the big in your face hoppiness dominates.  M/D - Medium bodied with good carbonation.

A nice one-finger off-white head...would've been even bigger if I'd poured it more aggressively (this isn't the first nugget nectar I've head, so I've seen how awesome the head can be). Leaves lots of lacing behind. Badass label, to boot.  S - O man, truly hop-head nirvana in the nose. Lots of flowery hops. I think that's enough said here  T&M - Delicious hops start off and endure for as long as it's held in my mouth. Appropriate carbonation level that blends real well with the hops. A real delicious earthy hop after-taste that goads one into taking another sip. Light-medium bodied.  D - So damn tasty. As alluded to earlier, the after-taste really enhances the drinkability.

Smell is a bit faint, but there is some sweet bready malts, a slight fruitiness, a hint of citrus, and some floral and piny hops.  Taste starts off with some sweet bready malts, a hint of honey, and a toffee sweetness. There's a fruity undertone that I can't quite put my finger on.

MMM...this stuff smells good. I can smell the hops. Pine, slight malt, citrus.  oh the taste...complex yet balanced, save for the slight burn of alcohol and it gushes down. I like that, though. Slight grapefruit. Honey and pine aftertones. I cheated and checked some other reviews to try to put a name on this wonderful taste. I think it is clover.  This stuff is ridiculously drinkable.

Piney, fruity, and spicey--all great and working well together to form a complex and pleasing aroma. The five hop varieties used are really showing off here; just a hint of honey  Taste & Mouthfeel After the first sip I fell in love with this beer. It's everything I like...in an IPA; so as an amber ale, I'm not totally sure how to rate it; but as it is, it's an explosion of complex hoppiness held up with just enough sweet malt; it has a silky texture and a medium body; to be an amber/imperial amber, I'd like some more maltiness  Overall Nugget Nectar lived up to the hype and then some. There's just not much to fault other than its labeling as an imperial amber. I don't get enough malt to think of it as that; to me, it's an IPA (""93-ish IBUs""...come on!). I'd rank this right next to Celebration Ale it's so good.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Could be an IPA.  M - medium bodied with good carbonation. Appropriate for the style.  D - Very good beer, probably more of an IPA than even HopDevil, IMO, but I like it.

694,15881,khiasmus,4.22,"Pours a completely clear amber with a finger of head that lasts as a single layer throughout. Hops are prominent to say the least in the nose. Pine and citrus are evident, and there is just a bit of malt in the back, but not enough to balance. Taste is initially honey-sweet pale malt that is quickly balanced and then overwhelmed by the immense hoppiness, both in flavor and bitterness. Clean and smooth in the mouthfeel, with medium-low carbonation and a bit of thinness giving way to immense astringency from the hop bitterness. The more of this beer you drink, the more you want.

In my opinion, this is the most beautiful, most intense, and tasty hop-related picture I have ever seen on a beer label. A big, mean fist squeezing the juice from a ripe hop... No batch # or drink on date to be seen. Poured this bad boy into my Samuel Smith's Imperial Pint glass at 45°F (Just pulled from my special beer fridge!). Pours a gorgeous, slightly cloudy, dark peach or apricot color - lots of orange highlights when put up to the light- looks thick and syrupy. Nice ¼ inch off-white head that remains for a few minutes while I smell.  S: Lots of piney, oily hops and sweet caramelized malts. Brown sugar, orange rinds, light clover and honey all trailed with the faintest hint of alcohol. Delicious nose, I am drooling over here now.  T: Much like the smell. Big, enjoyable blasts of piney hops balanced beautifully with adequately sweetened malts, as should be expected. Also, I think I captured some grapefruits on the finish. Amazingly balanced taste - for me, this is a wonderfully crafted example of an IPA, oh wait! This is classified as an Amber Ale?! Kidding...  M: Medium bodied and refreshing. Slightly waxy aftertaste with honey also detected on the finish. Very good carbonation.  D: EXTREMELY session-able beer here. I can totally see me putting back a few of these on ANY given happy hour. The only question that remains is - WHY THE HELL CAN'T TROEG'S DISTRIBUTE TO OHIO - we're the next freggin' state over!!!???

694,15881,Oxymoron,4.57,"Ex-squeeze me? Pours a mostly light copper to amber color with red hues through out. A nice pour leaving a white head with good head retention that lasted through most of the tasting but did hid to the edge of the glass. Decent lacing.  The nose is most notably hoppy (and crazy hoppy for a red). Mostly citrus and floral but blended very nicely. Orange, grapefruit and lemon with a hint of hibiscus. Some lighter malt notes come out but do play second to the IPA esk nose. A bit of a generic grain with some sugary notes as well. Very clean yeast smell.  The taste is right on line with the nose. The malt comes out more with more of a balance but still is second fiddle to the hops. The hops are mostly finishing hops but bittering comes out nicely as well. Citrus notes come out with orange and grapefruit. The herbal notes come out more with some spicey almost peppery flavors that accent the finish. Some bready almost biscuit notes. And hints of honey in the malt. Very subtle overall but accented by such a clean yeast flavor.  The body is closer to light than moderate. A light texture with a somewhat creamy finish. Very impressed with clean yeast. Very easy to drink and closer to an IPA than a Red. Maybe that is why everyone enjoys it sooo much.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

The top of the beer had a one inch bed of fluffy white foam which collapsed within about 30 seconds into a very thin layer of foam. This beer leaves quite a bit of lacing to is as well. The nose is of very sweet fruity hops, I was expecting to smell some pine, but I don't. At first I couldn't detect any sort of malt, but after a few whiffs I'm able to detect the slightest of malt smells which are again very sweet. After the first sip I know exactly why the word 'nectar' was chosen for the name. I couldn't find a more fitting word! Given the picture on the front of the bottle I was really expecting to have my tastebuds conquered by bitter hops but much to my surprise I got a sweet and juicy flavor instead. The mouthfeel on this is medium-bodied with a perfect amount of carbonation. I really wish I could get this in Wisconsin.

Sort of a fresh mystery fruit  Taste: Up front there is a certain cloying sweetness that has some of the aforementioned characteristics such as the fruit and honey and then fades to a smooth but assertive bitterness with the hops dominating but not overpowering if that makes any sense  Medium bodied on the palate with a very low carbonation level  Overall: What can i say that has not been said? This beer kicks ass, one of the best beers in pennsylvania for sure and an interesting beer in and of itself, smells and tastes like a IIPA to me in a lot of ways, but yet it has its own unique quirky characteristics that make it stand apart.

A nice floral and citrus aroma from the hops. I mostly pick up the Warrior variety of hops in the aroma. Some of the sweet malts come through but only to compliment the hop aromas.  T: Wow! That is the tastiest Imperial Amber I have had yet. Wonderful bitterness from the hops, but I am also picking up some sweetness from the crystal malts. A great citrus flavor from the high alpha hops. I get some brown sugar in the finish along with a palate full of hops.  M: Unbelievably smooth. Great palate, malts and hops are perfectly balanced with a good carbonation level. Very crisp and refreshing.  D: One of the best beers from Troegs that I have had, and a great Imperial Amber ale. Very drinkable, and you could put a few down at 7.5%. Give it a shot...if you can get some.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Boppar,4.15,"12 oz. into pint glass  A: Pours a lovely amber color, with two fingers of creamy white head.  S: A delightful bouquet of hops, of both the pine tree and floral variety.  T: It's funny, this isn't as hoppy as I'd expected given the name and the picture on the bottle, and even the aroma. I was set for mouth-puckering pine pitch. That being said, this is a tasty burger... err, beer. What I like best about it is that the hops are definitely present, but they're not so out of proportion that drown everything else out. There's still a solid malt backbone, and a faint creamy sweet taste.  M: Creamy and smooth with enough weight to satisfy while remaining light enough to want more.  D: Absolutely.  Solid.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,brewandbbq,4.52,"As reviewed on 3/12/06  Pours orangy-gold, clear, with a substantial, dense, off- white head. Retention is short-lived, revealing moderate curtains. Multiple, expanding strands of ultra-fine Co2 sustain a meager coating on the surface. Aromatics are floral and pungent. Some light caramel notes suggest that some malt exists in the lupuline elixer, but it remains in the shadows. The nose is awash with fresh citrus fruits, candied apple, garlic, and peaches at the base of a pine sapling. Further pondering brings forth visions of kindbud swaying in the breeze, after a spring rain, in a freshly mown tangerine orchard. Mouthfeel is thinnish, and creamy with an appitizing dry crispness. A sudued, smooth bitterness, sets the foundation for a substantial base of fresh, leafy hops on the pallet. Exceedingly fruity with a very earthy personality. Sugared tangerine segments harmonize with orange oils and spruce dew. A lingering finish- with a continued drying bitterness, a mild warmth, and a suggestion of nugget pulp. Drink up boys, the hoppy ones lose a lot of glory in the first month or two.  Revisited 5/9/08  Clear copper with a two-inch head of porous off-white head that quickly falls. Spongy lacework remains.  Fresh tangerines, mandarin oranges, cut grass, and peaches in the nose.  Medium bodied and sticky. Crispish with some tacky residuals.  Loads of tropical fruit on the pallet. Fresh mandarin, lush orange blossoms, pine dew, and mangoes. A firm malt base makes for a great balance, and bitteness is low for such a hoppy one.  Finishes with lingering tropical fruit and a hint of alcohol.  What an incredibly drinkable, hoppy, and fun beer to drink. A freshly draught pitcher would be bliss. Impossible not to drink the whole six-pack quickly!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Homerbag,4.25,"Thanks to CrazyMacHarris99 for the hook up at Dark Lord Day.  Has an Amber body with one inch fluffy head. Big, complex hop punch that mixes a grapfruit and pine hops into a great pucker that is eased up by a malty foundation. Great taste that I just want to savor with each drink. Has a good mouthfeel that leaves a little aftertaste to invite a refresher drink.  Great beer that I wish would make its way to the west coast of Lake Michigan. I will definately trade for more the next time this comes around.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,tinman1940,4.2,"An Above average Ale (better because of the cask).  Some of cask ales have a diffrent taste in when poured from the cask.  If you haven't had cask ale try it, everthing's diffrent.  Would like to try it in bottle form to get a better opion.  Found this at T J Finley's in Bay Shore on a wendnesday when they have a second cask on the bar.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,KarlHungus,4.55,"Thanks to MuenchenerKindl for this one. It pours a clear bright red color. The head is one inch in height, and recedes slowly into nice lacing. The aroma is of grapefruit, pine, gin, oranges, and flowers. The taste is has everything from the aroma, with the addition of a mild bitterness in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium-full bodied with lively carbonation, and a silky texture. Overall, this is a great beer. Other Imperial Ambers I have had have been more like darker colored IIPAs, but this has a firm malt backbone which really makes the beer work for me. I could drink this endlessly.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Pleepleus,4.69,"WOW! This is great stuff. Poured from a bottle into a pint glass, a clear amber color with an inch of firm foam head. Smells like a fresh bag of sticky kind buds. Hippitty Hop Hop. Crisp taste of fruity hops that seems to sweeten as it warms. Citrus sweetness clings on the finish. Hardly noticed the 7.5 APV under the hoppy goodness of this ""Nectar"". I would recommend this to all whether they have ever been a pothead (ahem hophead) or not.  The ONLY bad thing about this beer is that it seems to be seasonal, and when I tried it the season was sadly at it's end. Truly a reason to look forward to next year when I will stockpile it. Troegs' best by far.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Monsone,4.42,"Received as winnings from BA Fantasy Football  A - Pours an amber hue with nice frothy head  S - Big hop scents. Pine and citrus, lots of citrus. Some sweet carmel malt in the back.  T - Citrus, grapefruit, orange peel, pine. Good sweet malt backbone. Slight spiceyness.  M - Medium body with a little bit of hop oilyness  D - Pretty drinkable, more so than I expected.  Overall, just a great beer. I wish I could get this in Chicago.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,cjohnson,4.69,"Got this as an extra in a trade with Lupe.  Pours a nice, clear orange color with a pretty minimal head.  The nose is full of hops, and also some orangey / citrus smells. Also something like cedar comes through for me.  Pretty hoppy taste, but not as strong as I'd thought it'd be, and certainly not overwhelming (compare to something like Victory's Hop Devil, which is what I thought this might taste like). There is a certain ""sappy"" taste to it that I'm not overly fond of, and is the only reason I gave this 4.5 instead of 5 for taste.  Medium-bodied, not too carbonated. A little bit sticky feeling. Very drinkable and enjoyable, and something I'd probably drink regularly if I had access to it.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,thickerfreakness,4.27,"Thanks go out to HopDerek for this one!  It pours and looks like an average amber ale with a nice one inch head that lasts for about 5 minutes. The smell is almost pure hops, piney, grapefruit, and a little bit of floral hop smell with a little bit of caramel malts sneaking through at the end. Taste is similar to the smell but even more balanced than the smell led me to believe. Nice and hoppy with a respectable caramel malt backbone. I could drink this one all the time. Oh, I also wanted to add that this is definitely one of my favorite labels of all time.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Phillyduke,4.77,"After never being in the right place at the right time, I was finally able to enjoy this on cask at Theresa's Next Door. I sessioned this with the Hopback Amber from a freshly tapped firkin, so I got to taste both of the Troegs amber real ales in one sitting. Even got to talk with Chris Troegner while I was enjoying his wares.  For the most part my review is the same as the bottled and tapped version, but having this on cask really takes it to another level entirely. The head is denser and creamier, and there is absolutely no bite in the taste. The ingredients just seem to meld into this all at once sweet/citrusy/piney/malty/bitter glorious concoction. Lack of artificial carbonation makes the mouthfeel even creamier than the head. Some I was with thought that TND should store their casks separately from their kegs, but I actually preferred the cooler serving temperature, as it made the beer that much more refreshing.  This one's going to be tough to beat if you can find it. I can't think of a better pound-for-pound beer out there right now.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,m1ked,3.83,"Finally got to try the infamous NN.  A- Clear orangey amber with a brief 1/2"" white foam head, minimal lacing appreciated.  S- Strong sweet piney resin with a slight amaretto note. Wierd after smell like starchy pasta.  T- Sweet maltiness up front followed by a bitter pineyness. Honey-ish biscuit followed by lingering bitter.  M- Medium bodied, oily.  D- Easy to drink, a very respectable Amber. Unfortuneatly I fell victim to the hype, and was expecting more. I have to guard against that better. By like I said a good beer overall.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,hellcatsjg,4.1,"Appearance: Amber beer with a finger of head that sticks around for a few minutes. Layer of foam lasts most of the beer and leaves a good bit of lacing.  Smell: Hops. Nice blend of citrus and piney hops along with a bit of sweet caramel.  Taste: Just like the nose, just not as bold as you would think. Nice complex hop flavor mingles with a back end of caramel and maltiness.  Mouthfeel: Slightly light. Oily hoppy flavor coats the mouth and lingers for a while after the swallow.  Drinkability: Very good beer. While I expected something a bit bigger, this actually helps the beer in this category. Not being overpowering makes this something you can drink several of without feeling full after a couple. Very nice.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,0110x011,4.27,"Thanks to Tilley4 for the hookup.  Pours a reddish copper with a one-finger head that dissipates quickly, moderate lacing.

S: The floral and citrus hops are very potent but not overpowering.  T: Not overally bitter surprisingly. The hop taste hits you at first sip, but contains a little malty aftertaste. Lots of citrus and floral hops in the middle and on the back end. The caramel and bread malt gives a nice backbone.  M: Extremely smooth, medium body beer  D: I really enjoyed this beer and am looking forward to it coming out next season.

694,15881,Umbra,4.72,"Orange brew with sharp white, two-fingered head. Good retention and excellent lacing. Citrus and piney hops on the nose with some caramel playing in the background--it at least smells well balanced. Big citrus hops (grapefruit, orange, and lemon), mixed with some piney goodness. Excellently well balanced with a fine malt backbone with enough umph to keep hop bitterness in check. Even with all the flavors described, i'd still define this brew as light to medium bodied, which leaves the mouthfeel and drinkability off the charts. Carbonation is shy of perfection. Finishes dry, leaving the drinker wanting more.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,desertbronze,4.57,Got a sixer of this beer in a trade with beerbuddha.  Beautiful light amber color - just a slight haze as is typical with hoppy beers. Pours with a 2 finger head which settles to a thin head with lots of lacing in the glass. Tremendous citrus hop aroma which only whets your appetite for what is to come.  Good caramel malt flavor in the forefront with a hoppy finish. The hop flavor lingers on the tongue after the swallow. Very good balance - hops are dominant but don't overwhelm the malt. Just slightly thin on the mouthfeel - I would prefer a little more body.  Goes down very smoothly for a 7+% beer - it would be real easy to drink several of these. A very good example of a hoppy American style amber ale.,Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,indiapaleale,4.47,"The Nugget Nectar pours a beautiful deep apricot color with a short fluffy head that hugs the glass firmly. Faint islands of foam are left once the head begins to settle down. As for the smell of this stuff..well its almost too good to put into words. Its very sweet, citrusy and bursting with fresh hop goodness. Its like ruby red grapefruit juice mixed with some strong Pacific Northwest hops. I love it. Someone make this into a perfume and give it to my wife.  Taste is sweet, strong with a nice hop bite finish. There is definitely a citrusy tartness but its balanced so well with this malt that its a very balanced beer, even at 7.5%. There is a dryness to this beer but its at the very end after the initial juiciness. Everything about this beer is excellent, in my humble opinion. Its definitely one of my favorites.  Love the brewery. Love the label. Love the look. Love the smell. Love the taste.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,yoyo,4.25,"This was an exceptionally hoppy beer, but not overly bitter. The mouthfeel was smooth with a crisp finish. The smell was outstanding, very green and piney.

694,15881,trill,4.69,"Received via trade from crazymacharris99. Thanks, Jason. '08 edition.  Looks like Alpha King (clear, toffee color, billowy cream head), smells like a bucketful of fresh hops; more grassy, herbal and earthy than bright and citrusy. Very similar to SN Harvest Ale, with a more expansive hop character. Very, very smooth mouthfeel, with a barely noticeable alcohol warmth. Heavy lacing, light wet earth in aroma, faint toasted malt smell. For a big IPA, it's picture-perfect.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

694,15881,calebmills,4.89,"This is my ideal drinking beer. Shame its only a seasonal. Pours orange and smells like hops of course. the taste is exceptional makes me think of actually eating hops with the sticky hop flavor in every drop. This beer is has amazing balance but when you drink it im sure the only think you will pay attention to is the hops. You could enjoy several of these at a time so its the ideal 6 pack to just enjoy whenever you need a hop fix and at over 7% you dont need to ""hammer a case"" to get your fill. But this isnt a very heavy beer either making it easy to have a few with a meal or with anything else.

694,15881,Donnie2112,4.2,"I really liked this one, I'm not the most familiar with this variety of beers.

So overall kick ass yummy yummy beer.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,prototypic,4.47,"Thanks to csmiley for the bottle. I've been waiting to try this one.  Appearance: It pours a copper-amber color (slightly orange looking). Head is white with a touch of orange and about two fingers deep. Retention was good, but not spectacular. It receded a little quicker than I anticipated and left lights sheets of lace behind.  Smell: Hops are readily apparent on the nose. They're bold and piney, but feature some floral and earthy elements, as well. It's an impressive, diverse range in that department. Citrus sweetness is spawned by fragrances of grapefruit and orange. Caramel malts and yeast aromas are present, but mix well. It's impressive.  Taste: Grapefruit and orange citrus flavors are sweet and tasty. There's also some pineapple and lemon flavor there that's not apparent in smell. Hops are every bit as diverse in taste as they are in smell. They are a bit piney yet grassy and earthy. It's difficult to tell which is stronger. It seems pretty even keel to me. I think I'd prefer a little more pine, but I'm not complaining. This is too damn tasty. Caramel/toffee malts are sweet and add a little balance, but it's primarily hoppy and bitter. There is a yeasty taste that remains into the aftertaste. It finishes bitter and dry.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It leans light bodied, but it's knocking on the medium door. Carbonation feels just right. It's smooth and extremely drinkable. At 7.5%, it's tame enough to drink quite a few. At least that's my view of the world.  I must say I'm quite impressed. I had high expectations of Nugget Nectar and it's passed inspection with flying colors. It's a shame Troegs isn't distributed in Ohio. I'd drink this frequently if it were. Highly recommended.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Above average beer for me. Worth a try though. It does taste good.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,StonyB,4.6,"I discovered this seasonal gem two years ago, and have looked forward to it ever since. Look for the eye-catching label, a bright orange background framing a hand squeezing the juice (""nectar"") out of a hop flower. 7.5% ABV listed, and a very faint date of 02/06/08 stamped near the neck.  Appearance - This beer's color is almost as orange as the label, slightly cloudy. One finger of foam, tenacious lacing.  Smell - Hop assault. I'm not good enough at this to differentiate between varieties, but the label indicates Nugget, Warrior and Tomahawk hops. Works for me. Some grapefruit for sure, but the hops dominate.  Taste - Yum. Floral and citric hops up front, tart and semi-sweet tangerine and grapefruit follow. A slightly dry yet warming finish. Again the hops are leading the charge, but this is more balanced than you would think.  Mouthfeel - Somewhat thick, though not creamy. Tart and citric, but not overly acidic. Strong hop aftertaste, in a good way.  Drinkability - This beauty is dangerously drinkable. Each sip is just as good or even better than the previous one. It's strong and warming, yet you don't really taste the alcohol.  It's probably just as well that Nugget Nectar is seasonal, or I might never buy any other hoppy beers.

Nothing short of great. 5.5.  T: Hops, a good coating of it and then a bit more hops to top it off. Citrus, grapefruit, mango and a malt kick to go with it. Damn near a perfect drink- only if they could put this year round. A complicated concoction that is a hoplovers paradise.  M: A film of hops coats the lips and tongue.

I admit ambers are not toward the top of my favorites. Hop the shit outta them and now we're talking!!!  The color is (wait for it...) amber. Little bit of a head tops it off. First inhale - boom, hops. I tried to get the malty red character but enough my nose wasn't having it or it simply wasn't there. Oh well - I like hops.

Truly wonderful smell, like walking through a pine forest.  T: Not surprisingly, the piny hop bitterness hits first but is balanced by a nice fruity taste which lingers a little until the hoppy bitterness finishes off the job. Extremely well balanced.

694,15881,Zorro,4.39,"Sampled through ClockworkOrange and CA - PA BIF.  Clear copper colored ale with a small white head.  Smell is what you immediately notice about this beer the moment it is cracked open. Sweet and strong floral and pine hops hit you hard in the nose and you like it. Strong pine and citrus with a little melon, malt only really sweetens the hops. A little wood and a little eucalyptus complete the harsher Hop scents.  The taste starts out sweet and hoppy with lots of floral and citrus in the mouth and a woody and sweet finish. Strong hops and the sensation of mint as something cools and numbs my tongue, add mint to the list of flavors. Tasty ale that never fades in flavor throughout the whole glass.  Mouthfeel is good.  Damn tasty ale and one I have been seeking for a long time. Strong tasty IPA that pushes to the edge of DIPA. I could see drinking this lots if I lived in Pennsylvania.

694,15881,jackorain,5,"I've gone through 2+ cases of this this year and this is my last bottle that I finaly got to reviewing. This is some seriously good shit!!  The appearance is amber to copper in color and is topped by a 2-ich head of egg shell colored foam in a very tight formation. The retention is very good but not annoyingly so as it dissapates to a nice thick coat after a few minutes. The lace left after head disapation is quite beautiful.  The smell is gobs of floral hops up front. There are hint of mixed citrus as well. Blood ornge, tangerines, and a touch of grapefruit. Piney hops come in middle to end in the nose. there is evidence that that actually used some malts in this beer in the formof caramel and biscuit. This is just a wonder to sniff, defintely the best beer I've ever smelled.  The tastes starts off very much like the nose with the floral hops just slamming home. This is followed by a barage of various hop flavors. I'm getting pine, tangerine, orange, lemon zest (but not lemon), grapefruit and a hint of leafy greens. The malt comes in the middle and certainly adds depth of flavor with caramel and biscuit doing most of the heavy lifting here. There is a hint of gaininess that is welcome and balancing. Not that this is balanced as the hops come roaring back on the finish with a nice even long lasting bitterness. Not over the top though, I've had beers with less than 93 IBUs that tasted more bitter.  The mouthfell perfectly matches the flavor profile. The fullness of body is medium but not so full to take one's attention away form the dramatic flavors. The carbonation is perfectly smooth and creamy. The finish is oily and mouth coating.

694,15881,bgramer,4.28,Thanks to Readdiculous for the trade. I poured this beer from a 12 oz glass into a Duvel tulip glass. It's a cloudy amber beer with roange/copper highlights... oh my the head is aggressive... starting out at 3+ fingers and settling down to a thin film coating with little whispy swirls where carbonation stuck the surface.  It's a very hoppy beer - very floral and citrus-y and pine-y and maybe graperuit-y. The lacing is plentiful and sticky. Coats the glass well. The body is is thick - almost oily. There's a sweet malt taste on the finish which was pretty good - not as overpowering so the complexity shows through.  This is an awesome drinkable beer. It's very similiar to Hopslam and Dreadnaught in many ways but also unique in it's own way.,Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

This disappered after settling in to leave a tall glass of amber red deliciousness  Smell - A hop explosion! 3 beautiful styles of hops combine for an incredibly overpowering piny hop scent. If you truly love hops like I do, you'll love it.  Taste & Mouthfeel - The first taste is all hop, and it's wonderful. However, I tasted some citrus and a great sweet maltiness which I didn't expect. A more complex beer than just the hops as I had anticipated.  Drinkability - A great beer if you are lucky enough to get your hands on it.

694,15881,sleazo,3.92,"A_Pours a clear brown with a touch of orange to it. The small head dissipates rapidly and leaves a bubbly slick floating in the beer.  S_Sweet rich caramel and bracing grapefruit-like hops. Very aromatic to say the least  T-The malt hits first, more biscuit than caramel which was not what I expected. The hops come in next and are slightly spicy and redolent of grapefruit. The aftertaste leaves the mouth with a mellow version of the aforementioned hops. Defiitely on the hoppier side with a bit less malt than I would ideally want.  M_Medium bodied with a high dose of carboation. The aftertaste is a bit oily and coats the mouth in hoppiness.  D_A good, not great brew. I would definitely like more malt to complement the hops, which can be a bit intense. Still this is a big bold beer that remains fairly drinkable.

There was minimal carbonation with very few, almost no bubbles rising from the beer after it settled. After each sip it left a sticky layer of lacing.  S- Probably the best smelling beer I have ever had. Like opening a fresh bag of KB. Hops out the ass. When and if you ever get past that sweet hop smell this beer follows it with a decent fruit smell. Hints of apricot and peach that faded into faint alcohol mixed with floral scents. As the beer warmed up I picked up slight hints of pineapple.  T- This is what a hopped up beer is all about. The hops jump out of the bottle followed by a fruity sweetness that finished with faint hints of alcohol. I expected it to have a more powerful flavor but was pleasantly surprised at how smooth yet still flavorful it was.  MF&D- This beer was so incredibly smooth that it should warrant a warning label. It leaves a great oily hop flavor in the mouth. At 7.5 ABV it packs the punch without the bite. By taste alone I would consider this a session beer but due to the high ABV it could lead to an early night. Fuck that I changeed my mind I would session the shit out of this beer and then go take a nap on the curb.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,timbro81,4.37,"Thanks to scootny for the opportunity. Pours a very clear light copper color. Very small head that settles quickly, low carbonation. Smells of very wet grapfruity hops and a nice caramel sweetness. Very lively mouthfeel. Surprisingly big. More glorious juicy grapefruit in the mouth plus some pine. Little bits of caramel sweetness, but not much. Fairly one sided but pulls it off extremely well. In lew of an aftertaste there is a vibrant tingling sensation. But after that passes the caramel malts start to shine through, there they are. A parade of high aplha acid West Coast hops. A hop heads wet dream of an Amber. A must try beer if you hate your enamel.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,misterdmac,4.42,"Pours an amber-gold color, shades of orange under more light. Nice sticky head, but doesn't stick around too much.  Love the nose on this one. Sweet citrus and earthy hops. 93 IBUs but the aroma is sweet, not at all acrid.  Oh, my, and the taste. Strongly connected to the smell, but more pine in the hop balance. Still a good amount of citrus, like a dank grapefruit.  Medium carbonation, medium body. Very crisp, not at all syrupy. I could drink this all day (if not for the 7.5 abv :-).  Really nice beer. Had trouble finding it, had to pay 13.49 for a six pack when I did but IT WAS WORTH IT.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,halfP1NT,4.59,"Got the last six pack in the store...nice.  Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip glass...a deep clear golden brown, no bubbles. Two-finger soapy white head that dissipated quickly, left lacing all around the glass.  Very aromatic! Citrus-oranges, earthy hop aroma. I can smell this several feet away.  Tastes just like it smells. Citrusy hops, sweet, fresh orange, balanced with earthy hop bitterness & mellow malts. Crisp and not overly sweet.  Full mouthfeel, tingly carbonation. Goes down really easy. Personally, I think this beer has all ingredients in nice balance & is exactly what I look for in a hoppy beer.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,boston2bburg,4.65,"Deep orange-amber hue with a tight creamy finger of off-white head that's sticky and leaves giant swaths of tiny-bubbled lacing while not quite covering the width of my snifter.  Smells a whole lot like Simcoe, and although the bottle only lists Nugget, Warrior and Tomahawk, the website notes Simcoe and Palisade as well. True to its name, it is very resiny, with grapefruit, citrus and pine, and a sweet malty character that reminds me of a lot of west coast DIPAs.  The flavor tops most of them. Beautifully balanced but with a huge hop character. The sweetness of the malts complement the hops in such a way that yields mostly flavor and only subtle bitterness. It really is like drinking hop juice.  Mouthfeel is a bit sharp up front and dry on the finish. Not real syrupy which allows for excellent drinkability. This is a beer that those who enjoy well done hops need to seek out. It may seal up a trip to the brewery for me this summer.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Taste: Hops are first thing you notice. The taste follows the aroma. Hops are strong but not overpowering.  Mouthfeel: Very crisp and smooth  Drinkability: A beer that can be drank everyday. Alc % is not too high for being an imperial amber-but can catch up with you.  Overall a quite satisfying delicious beer.

694,15881,Bubba83,4.36,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tumbler at 45 degrees. Drank it slowly to let it warm some by the time I finished.  Appears a nice looking orange, much like you'd expect an IPA to appear. Expected it to look more red. Two fingers worth of off-white head with a nice looking texture. Retention is moderate with good sticky lacing.  Exceptional qualities are made apparent in the smell immediately, even while pouring it without much sniffing effort. A beautiful blend of light toasted caramel, accentuated by pungeant spruce and pine. I found it a joy to swirl it around to create more head just to smell it over and over again.  After the smell, I was a little bit let down. There is a bit of toasted caramel at the forefront, but as the color suggests the malt backbone is not bold enough to keep up with the three strong hop varieties used (Nugget/Warrior/Tomahawk) They take over pretty quick indeed, which isn't bad because this combination turns out to be delicious. Awesome pine flavors with some spice and a little tartness, but pine dominates which is my favorite characteristic. I wish this beer had a stronger malt backbone that I'd expect for a red, because I feel the contrast of these flavors would be astounding. The malt came through a little more as it warmed up to around 55, but it still wasn't enough for me.  Feel is quite good, nice level of carbonation that helps release the scent of the brew and a nice prickly turned smooth experience in each sip.  Pretty easy to quaff if you are a pine lover like I am. Overall a very good beer and my first offering from Troegs, thanks Kegatron!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,sinistrsam,4.92,"Pours a sligthly hazy red-gold with a medium off-white ehad and great lacing on the glass. The aroma is a lot of piney hops but a strong sweet adn toasted malt presence. Mild grapefruit and citrus in this one. Truly fantastic taste. Piney and floral hops for sure, btu a wonderful toasty and sweet malt presence is almost as pronounced. Sweet fruits and an almost grassy/floral character. I've neevr had anything like it before, and originally mistook it for an AIPA. Once again I believe balance to be the mark of a fantastic beer, and this is no exception; the hop bitterness and sweetness of malt merge very well, and yet, for as hoppy as it is, the grassy and floral notes don't get overshaddowed? There is a lot going on in this beer and you're able to taste so much of it. Overall my favorite beer I've had this season and has earned a place in my overall favoites. The only thing that I'm disappoitned about is its seasonal release, but then again, absence makes the heart (and palate) grow fonder.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Spiciness with a sweet malt.  Taste & Mouthfeel - Just as wonderfully hoppy as I expected. I love the malt sweetness that was immediate and sooner than expected. Crisp at first but smooth on the back end. Spiciness blends well with the hops. Citrus notes are present in the background as well. Hell a good beer, and balanced exceptionally. A whole lot more complex than I thought. A lot more to this brew than just the hops.  Drinkability - Picked up a case and i'm only two bottles in.

Piney hops as well are easily found.  T - Sweet and piney were my first impressions. Some bitterness at the end of the taste. very wonderful and smoothly balanced. The big citrus in the smell is a bit more in the back seat. The overall sweetness of the taste really ties it together and brings it up.

The Nectar opens with a 2"" head that slowly dissapears into a moderate layer of lacing topping off a copper colored brew; a smattering of carbonation bubbles can be seen rising from the glass bottom.  Nose-wise, there are notes of lemon and orange. An orange is a fruit. Fruit is healthy. Ergo, the Nectar is healthy. (Beer Logic) Taste-wise, it offers your palate an excellent bite of hop without bitter aftertaste; subsequent sipping slowly reveals mild sweetness.  The mouthfeel is one that is well proportioned, having a smooth balance of malt and hops making for a surprisingly crisp quaff.

The malt is still there to add some balance. The finish is dry and bitter, but very pleasant.  Mouthfeel is very good, a nice thickness to add to the hop flavor and help the bitterness.

694,15881,lightindarkness,4.79,"Traded for this with Jw347, but burnt through it pretty quick. Thanks to a couple extras from jdoncbus and markgugs, I bring you this review.  A good pour into a tulip yields a cream colored fluffy head atop a very attractive slightly hazed orange colored brew. Plenty of full lacing.  Nose is of hops. Pinecone, sap, and grapefruit stand out in excellent balance. I don't need to say any more about the smell. It's just plain great. I have yet to find a beet with better overall balance in hops.  Taste is really an extension of the nose, with fresh piny hops and some juicy grapefruit goodness. All is filled out in the bottom end with nice caramelly malt. Has a zesty robust taste that is undeniably fantastic and hard to find anywhere else. Finishes with only slight resin, not overpowering, but extending the hop experience. Again, I can't quite imagine a better balanced hop taste in a beer. Fantastic.  Has a smooth and enticing feel, slightly oily, plenty of stickiness, and just the right amount of cleanness to the finish. Carbonation is done well enough not to notice, enhancing the flavor and feel.  Drinkability? It'd be hard to find a beer I'd say yes to drinking more quickly than this one.

The aroma hits you right away, a blast of hops and a citrus/fruit mix, like limes and peaches maybe? If you like the Hopback Amber this is basically a juiced up version, so for hopheads like me the taste is right on. A nice balance of heavy hoppyness. Going down it's crisp and bitter, with a very clean aftertaste. The amped up hop action might be too much for some, but for those that enjoy it you could definitely swill more than one.

Balances out a whole lot better than i was expecting. the bottle says 93ish ibus, but there is no overwhelming hop sensation. It has a nice sweet and sour flavor as the hops give a citrus tartness as well as a caramel sweetness and fullness. Aftertaste leaves a nice hop dryness, but not all too bitter. very nice.  Mouthfeel. I thought it was going to be a fuller beer. It does have a fullness to it and is a bit chewy, but I find it still a bit refreshing. I think the alcohol hides extremely well here.

Knowing nothing of brewing I have no idea what they used but it was sweet and not too bitter which you find in many overly hopped beers. Something balanced it out perfectly.

694,15881,joezak5,4.97,"12 ounce bottle purchased at the Princeton, NJ Wegmans at $10.99 for a 6 pack. Printed with a February 6, 2008 born-on date and enjoyed on March 15, 2008.  Appearance: This is a great translucent and rich amber color topped by a very pillowly and medium bubbled pure white head. It reached about a half inch from the lip of the Duvel sniffter it was poured into.  Aroma: The overwhelming sweet hops come through here. It has a very citrusy and piney aroma. It is a huge surprise to open your eyes and still see the beautiful amber color. The ""Imperial Amber"" labeled on this bottle really hits home here. This beer makes you thankful you've discovered a site like Beer Advocate that pointed it out you.  Taste: The good folks at Troegs were right on when they added ""Nectar"" to the name of this beer. It is sweet, balanced hoppy goodness. I had to double check the bottle to make sure the ABV was really 7.5%. The alcohol content was almost indetectable. It wasn't until the the finihing exhale that I was warmed by the sweet hops.  Mouthfeel: This is one of those beers that has you puckering on it to squeeze out all the hops flavor. It has a medium body with light carbonation. The sweetness and stickiness definitely comes out with an extended period in the mouth.  Drinkability: This is a beer I could definitely has a few more of. It is certainly a smooth and easy drinking exmample of the style. Nugget Nectar will be a regular in my drinking lineup.

Some sweet malt in the aroma, hops emerge as the beer begins to warm. The flavor is an amalgam of hops, sweet malt, bready malt, and bittering hops dominating the finish. Hops are present all the way through, but perhaps not as much as promised on the bottle. Nonetheless this is a very well balanced beer. Mouthfeel is crisp and refreshing, perhaps not as thick as I thought it would be, but still a bit syrupy at the end. Enough carbonation to leave a tickling on the tongue all the way through the finish. I could envision drinking two of these in a night, probably no more. Still this is a very easy beer to drink. Not exactly a ""Hophead's Nirvana"" as promised on the bottle, a bit too much malt in there to make that claim, but still a very good beer. 5/25/09 Drinking a much fresher bottle of this now.

I prefer the draft version to the bottle this season, but still not as good as the cask.  A: Clear copper/amber color with a two finger fluffy white head that has nice retention and deteriorates into a thin film and leaves some nice streaky lacing. S: Wow, this always smells so good and is more than capable than cutting through the smoke of the bar (something I usually have trouble with for most beers). Amazing hop smell, strongest tones are citrus (slightly sweet grapefruit) and slightly floral. T: Medium body, very creamy and smooth. Nice balance of hoppy smooth bitterness and sweetness. Malt background is very noticeable but the hops are what dominate. Leans very strongly toward the citrus end of things like the smell, but also a weaker piney taste. My favorite part is probably how soft and smooth this feels in the mouth. Alcohol is well hidden, a little more obvious in the bottle version.

694,15881,goschool,4.5,"12 ounce bottle courtesy of guzzle211  Appearance: The pour is a rustic golden-amber color topped by two fingers of frothy white head.  Aroma: There is a nice balance of hops and malts in the nose. The hop aroma has an array of pine, grass, grapefruit, and mango while the malts are sweet, but clean, i.e., not at all cloying.  Taste: Maybe my palate is tuned abnormally since I'm from Southern California, I drink Pliny the Elder semi-regularly, etc, etc, because to me, this tastes like a well-hopped session beer that just happens to be 7.5% ABV. There's a lot of great stuff going on, but I don't quite get imperial or copious amounts of violently fresh squeezed hops.  The flavor profile has a nice burst of bitter hops up front which run the gambit of pine, grapefruit, grass, pineapple, and peach. The malts kick in at the mid-palate and it's here when this beer becomes special. Imagine a scenario where two enterprising brewers purchase the rights to make Fuller's ESB. One of the brewers wants to tweak it to be more like a West Coast American pale ale while the other wants to make it more like a märzen. They get started on a batch with the original recipe, but each brewer substitutes his own ingredients when the other isn't looking. The resulting malt base is toasty with bread and slightly sweet toffee- solid, yet soft. The APA brewer's hops finish what they started with a crisp splash of bitterness. That's what this beer tastes like.  Mouthfeel: It's medium-bodied and delightfully wet with plenty of carbonation and a sticky finish.  Drinkability: This is one of four beers that have stuck out as having a flavor that will always appeal to me, regardless of what style(s) I'm in the mood for. I'm not giving it 5.0, however, since the ABV is higher than other similarly flavorful beers.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Hop profile is more pine than I expected, but juicy grapefruit and citrus poke through.  Creamy buttery mouthfeel at first, then a nice resiny hoppy coating takes over. Full body.  Drinkability is phenomonal. I did a Hop Wallop earlier tonight, which has long been in my top 5, and this Nectar made it turn it's tail and run.  I know this one isn't an IPA (technically), but it tastes like one. The strong malt footing chisels it away though, so sure, I'll settle for Imperial Amber. I can't wait for more breweries to attempt imperial ambers, reds, etc.  Great job Troegs! This has made my top 5!

Some toasty malt too.  t: Toasted malt perfectly complements a complex hop profile. The hop bill of Nugget, Warrior, and Tomahawk produces a rare balance of flavor. Orange, grapefruit, pine, just an incredible flavor. All without pulling in too many directions or overwhelming you with bitterness.  m:Medium body, lower carbonation, sticky feel.  d: If this is an Amber Ale, it is the best Amber Ale ever made. Nothing else is close. If this is an America IPA, it is one of the better American IPAs out there. Whatever box you put it in, this is a terrific beer. It is quickly becoming one of my favorites.

The off-white head looks nice and creamy and leaves big chunks on the walls of the glass.  Initially a candy-sweet aroma fills the nose. The hops add plenty of citrus (orange) too, but it seems the malts dominate here. Very inviting thus far.  Man, this tastes good. The malts, which aren't nearly as sweet as in the aroma, are balanced by the perfect amount of bitterness. Tons of hops make their presence known, mostly resulting in grapefruit. Seemingly no alcohol.  Smooth as can be with a bit of oily hop goodness. Tart aftertaste leaves me yearning for more.  Drinkable? Doesn't get much better than this. Wish it could last all night.

Taste is crisp, intense hops followed by a sweet malt and smooth finish.  Mouthfeel is not overpowering, somewhat smooth and crisp.

I dont see any carbonation at all, and a quick swirl of the glass shows just a bit of egg white lacing. This is a very clear beer as well.  S: Hops are strong with this beer, both piney and citrus aromas, definitely grapefruit, but quickly followed by a sweet caramel aroma, perhaps even a honey cough drop at the end. Very nice indeed.  T: The pine hop flavor grabs the tongue and controls it, but its followed by a sweet, honey like flavor. Citrus brings up the rear, with pink grapefruit definitely noticeable. There is a very, very mild soapy taste as well.  M: Despite the lack of visible carbonation, this beer has plenty of it. The hop bite is strong and leaves the mouth dry. And just as the appearance of the beer, it feels very thin, not too much to chew on this beer.  D: The ABV is not too bad, but the carbonation for me makes it two to three tops. Excellent drinking.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Has a nice coppery glow, with a white one finger head with a little bit of retention.  S: Pine and citrus hops with a blend of fruits, mainly peaches. The peach aroma is pretty prevalent and distinct. A SLIGHT touch of caramel and honey. Not as much hop aroma as I was expecting.  T: Hops up front. The hops become more citric in the taste, but still retain a pine quality. The peach is more subdued and the caramel and honey come out more, especially on the finish. Mouthfeel is good but nothing to really talk about. Good level of carbonation though.  D: I could drink a growler of this no problem...which would be amazing for a cookout, especially with the warmer weather we have been having here in Raleigh.

S - Cirtus hop aromas are up front leaving no doubt what kind of beer this is going to be. The background contains earthy notes and a sweeter smell similar to molasses.  T - Of course, citrus hop flavors are the first part of this beer. Period. When the citrus starts to fade, it is replaced with an earthy hop flavor. After making it through the hops there are some sweeter flavors that start to peak through. I picked up caramel and honey flavors that tend to stay in the background.  M - Medium bodied with good carbonation. Finish is dry but the beer remains smooth for the amount of hops in it.  D - Drinkability is very good. I only wish I had more.

I'm not sure what makes it an ""amber"" as opposed to just an ""IPA"". The hops really dominate the beer, lots of lemon and grapefruit zest that leads to a little bit of cottonmouth.

Warrior?) and not much else too bad, with a red there'd be a lot of room for the malt to show up even with the hoppiness going on.  A palate shredder, for sure. Sweet and sticky hops are way out of balance with the malt, but that's the point here, so I'm not even considering it a red anymore.  Mouthfeel is where it should be for a red. The extreme drying power of the hops is actually balanced out with the sheer amount of hop oil in this beer.  Definitely one to actively seek out.

Flavor starts just like the aroma. Juicy citrus with grapefruit and orange. A little pine with some resin and a sappy sweetness. Floral notes are present as well. A nice underlying caramel sweetness along with some bread do a superb job of balancing the beer, yet still letting the hops shine. The hops do not hit you with a tongue lashing of bitterness like other big hoppy beers. Delicious.  Medium bodied, super smooth and crisp. Light carbonation but not too creamy. Seems just right for this beer.  Ridiculous drinkability. So smooth and flavorful, full of hops but not harsh or overwhelming. Great juicy flavors and extremely well balanced.

The Nectar I am used to shines in a way that no other beer does. The casked version had a haze to it that would not have bothered me with any other beer. It was darker than other versions, almost a light brown color. It was served to me with a perfect white frothy head.  s: This was served at the proper temperature to allow all the hop aromas to shine perfectly. Some nice caramel malts came through as well.  t: This beer is absolutely perfect. The casked version seemed hoppier to me with the malts being more subdued.

The hops are in front and well-presented but this is not about a balanced effort. Slight off taste at first (dog blanket?). Alcohol is well-concealed, probably mostly by the carbonation. Malt completes the backbone but its flavor is slow to emerge until the offering warms a little bit. Well-made but was expecting to be wowed a little more.  This is very clean and clear with, of course, strong hop pucker. The deep, bitter hop finish is very enjoyable. A little citrus tang goes a long way here.

A: The amber ale is a darker color, more brown than orange, with a steady haziness that arkens the ale enough to prevent translucence. The careful attention to the detail of the pour has resulted in a one finger head that nicely laces in strata as I drink the ale.  S: The nose is an awesome blast of floral citrus hops. The firkin has mellowed out the flavors a touch, allowing more caramel maltiness to come through.  T: The first sip is a silky masterpiece. The hops are as strong as ever, bitingly sharp with herbal grass and citrus flavors. The malts are a minor thought in the body, never adding more than a brief flick of caramel. The hops are the focal point of the ale and they do not disappoint. A booziness is just below the surface throughout the glass, coming close to overwhelming the pleasing drinkability.  M: The hops are biting and strong, softened up just a bit by the cask conditioning. The warmer temperature of the ale really brings out the deliciousness. This ale was meant for the cask.

Great mouthfeel with a tight carbonation that accentuates all of the hoppy goodness. Lower ABV than many similarly styled beers makes this a much better choice when you are having a few.  Most importantly is how this beer tastes. Highly hopped, but not overwhelming like some IIPAs/DIPAs. Dry grassy notes dominate with a slight hint of fruit in the middle. Sharp aftertaste.

694,15881,rbowser,4.27,"This Troegs seasonal offering, hits the glass with an amber-orange hue and has a strong citrus, grassy, pine hop aroma. Decent head retention, it looks good in a glass.  As the name implies, this IPA focuses on hops and I assume nugget hops and I am guessing several others as the hop profile is complex. It has a high bitterness level and a supportive malt background, that seems to have some Munich malt and others.  Overall, the malt background and the hops additions make a fairly complex IPA. This is a clean fermented, West Coast style IPA, that seems to have a more complex malt and hop ingredient list then is typical. The bitterness is intense and lasting. Although still a very drinkable and an excellent IPA.  If I compared this IPA to the best in this class, and this is a very competitive category, the one shortcoming in this excellent beer is that it is not as well balanced for the style compared to the very best IPAs. This is also somewhat odd, as it says it is an Imperial Amber, but really lacks the malt backbone to be in the Amber category.  I am guessing, the use of many different types of hops, most of them high alpha acid hops, seem to make this beer less smooth in its intense bitterness and with a slightly more complex flavor profile which muddies the overall taste profile. So, a great beer but not one of the best in this category.  Still, I could easily drink a case and this is an excellent IPA.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Head is somewhat thin, almond in color, and retreats to a ring while leaving behind average lacing. The aroma, as the label proclaims, is Hopheads Nirvana: Big, resinous pines give way to juicy, sweet citrus hops. Caramel & toffee malts try their best to balance, but the aroma belongs to the hops.  The flavor picks up where the aroma leaves off, with pine-tree resins and bitter, fresh hop notes. It's as if someone were squeezing a giant hop bud with all their strength into this beer...(oh, wait). A malty sweetness greets the front of the palate, but get lost in the sea of greenery. It's very good, don't get me wrong, but I tend to like a bit more balance & complexity, especially with an amber ale. The mouthfeel is upper echelon: medium body, perfect carbonation level, and a sticky bitter hop finish. Alcohol makes a quick appearance, hitting the sides and back of the palate.

694,15881,beerthulhu,4.72,"A: Poured a clear copper-orange with a slight sudsy white head. Visible carbonation was very soft.  S: The nose was perfumy and flowery, with a huge, fresh tropical fruitiness (citrus, pineapples). The aroma was soft, very refined and smooth. Honestly one of the best smelling ipas ive come across.  F: sweet/bitter citrus, with fresh flowery hops of tropical fruit (pineapple, mangos) and fresh orange juice. The hopping takes center stage here, was well rounded, refined and very smooth providing a mouth watering lacing. Unlike other highly hopped west coast ipas, this one was not coarse but very smooth in nature. The fruity pineapple, mangos and citrus hopping made you feel you were drinking a spiked orange juice. Overall a hop heads delight.  M: The mothful was medium with fresh flowery citrus and pineapples leaving your mouth quenched with a tropical fruitiness. The beer was lightly carbonated with a smooth texture.  D: An incredibly balanced ipa with a magnitude of fruity hoppiness will make you wishing you can drink this all night. Case worthy by all means.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Sponan,4.7,"A - This one is a nice copper color. Great head and lacing.  S - Hops and more hops with just a hint of earthy malt. The hop smell on this one is complex, with floral and grass predominant.  T - Love the balance here. Strong hop flavor, predominantly of flower. Just enough sweetness. Excellent balance here.  M - Thick but clean. Coats the mouth nicely and fades away. Just enough carbonation.  D - My favorite lighter American style beer. This one will become a staple. Very easy to drink, would be sessionable if not for the ABV.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,AltBock,4.47,"I got this on-tap at High Street Bar on 2/15/2008. They served it to me in an official Tröegs Nugget Nectar standard pint glass.  It poured a clear copper/amber color that had a tall creamy 1 1/2 to 2 inch head of white foam that had real good rentention that left behind a small white film and a few streaks of white lace. The aroma was so strong that you could smell this beer being poured. It was that powerful! This strong aroma consisted of pine, citrus fruits, citrus hops, and a light touch of toasted malts. It the beer is swirled around, a tiny juicy fruit aroma will emerge from the background. It had strong bitter taste of citrus hops, citrus fruits, and quite a few pine needles. I couldn't detect any malts or anything thing else in the taste because all the citrus bitterness this beer offered covered everything else up, except for the pine of course. It was more of a full bodied beer than medium bodied beer. That's because it had a strong long lasting aftertaste of pine, citrus hops, and citrus fruits. This aftertaste won't leave your tastebuds alone until you drink a few cups of water to wash it all away. This is another winner from the Tröegs brothers! Although I had this on-tap, I'm sure the bottled version is just as hoppy as the on-tap version.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

The hops really come through with a superb sweet, floral hop that is not overpowering. Beautifully managed flavors.  M - Good mouthfeel , crisp and clean with a oily resinous backdrop.  D - I could drink this beer consistently. Well designed beer that highlights the aromatic qualities of the hops without being overpowering.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Hoppington,4.47,"Troegs' Nugget Nectar is nothing short of a superb beer IMO. I would classify this as an Double (or Imperial) IPA, but you can call it what you want.  Smell is all florals and grapefruit with a strong malt backbone. Appearance is a perfect burnished copper. The taste of this beer is outstanding and well balanced, though the malt is in a supporting role to the hops. Mouthfeel is rich and slightly resinous and oily.

694,15881,dnichols,4.47,Thanks to bonezx86 for a great trade. I poured the capped 12 ounce bottle into a pint glass.  A: It poured a orange-amber body with a slight hazy. I poured aggressively and got hardly any head but what head was there was off-white white and clung to the collar supporting a thin leggy lacing.  S: It had a strong pleasant aroma of oranges and grapefruit. Orange. Grapefruit. Under the hops there were hints of sweet lightly toasted malts.  T: This is a creamy mouthful of malt and tasty hops. Rich in citrusy flavors including oranges and grapefruity with hints of pine.  M: It was creamy and medium bodied with the smoothist hop profile I have ever experienced. It finishes clean and warm....nice.  D: I'm glad bonezx86 sent me two bottles...I only wish I had more. Great brew and easy to drink.

Pine and citrus as well as orange and a slight grapefruit aroma with a nice touch of sweetness from the malt. The taste is more malt and more in liking with an amber ale but what distinguishes this beer is the nice hoppy aroma.

The heavy citrus flavor is rounded out very well from the sweet malt. Slightly biscuity in the malt flavor.

694,15881,deapokid,4.02,"Definitely up there with kindred spirit brews like Stone Ruination and Victory Hop Devil, this popular Troegs offering stands up as a big time hop beer.  Resembling the complexity and richness of a Werther's original candy, Nugget Nectar puts off a pungent hop aroma, which is startling at first and emblematic of the flavors to come.  Biting would be an understatement for this beer, which explodes on the tongue with spicy hop flavor and grapefruit bitterness from moment one and never lets up.  An occasional whiff of citrus fruit hides under a never ending wave of intense flavor that may scare off the casual beer fan, but this beer is definitely worth all the hype for the hop-addict in need of a fix.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

I'm partial towards cloudy beers!  S: Good lord, this is a very different beast! While i love the regular nectar, this goes beyond. Massive floral hops in there with the hops even more in-your-face but mellow at the same time.  T&M: The sharpness of the regular NN is mellowed out but this is no less potent hop-wise. The mouthfeel is spectacular - my one little gripe with the bottled version is the carbonation. This is beer. This is beer  D: I drank two when i was planning on drinking only one.

Balanced smells of citrusy hops and some sweet malt, somewhat spicy with hop oils. Flavor is where its at. Huge fresh flavors of oily hops with lots and lots of delicious pine, a decent malt base to support the hops, and a long moderate piney bitterness. Delicious, and most impressive to squuze all that piney goodness into a 7.5% abv beer. Mouthfeel is ample- good full body without being over the top. Firm, and almost oily from all the hops.

When first smelling it, the first thought was ""This is what car fresheners or Pinesol SHOULD smell like"" ;)  T: Like the smell, the hops carry over here, in a very good way. A very pine/spruce taste with a bit of a sweet, malty balance towards the back of the tongue, followed by a bittering finish. Truly spectacular.  M: A full body, a moderate carbonation - not overly so, but just about right to balance the rather big flavour.

Subtle sweetness lets you know the malt character is there. Someone needs to bottle this smell as an air freshener.  The balance of this brew is remarkable.

T - Amazing hop blast, no abv apparent, nice relatively smooth malt backing, but it does in no way interfere with the hoppy goodness. Finishes slightly sweet, relieving the mild bitterness contained in the body.  M - Medium body, low carbonation, sticky consistency, yum.  D - Someone would have to pry this from my cold dead hands.

The head has pretty good retention and sticks around through almost half the glass. The head reminds you that it was there as it leaves thick ringed sticky lacing all over the glass. Here and there bubbles float to the top of the fluffy head for a couple minutes, and then there is no evidence of the carbonation.  The combination of the hops is all I can sniff in the nose. As it warms I get a brief balancing sweetness from the malts.  Hops, hops and more hops. There is a slight peppery taste of alcohol in the aftertaste, which is the only hint that this is a brew you shouldn't slam several of. And since it's quite tasty, and balanced so well; slamming several becomes a legitimate concern. Crisp, clean, powerful. Nice bitterness throughout the palate. The most amazing characteristic of this beer is that with all the bitterness from the hops, with all the power from the alcohol, there is an undercurrent of sugary sweetness throughout the beer that keeps everything balanced.  For all the hops, I was expecting the mouthfeel to be oily or greasy. Definitely not the case. I would describe it as explosive, slightly syrupy but not to the extent where it leaves the mouth coated. Syrupy as in thick and not at all watered down.  This is good stuff. Overhyped?

Creamy white head that leaves decent lacing and lasts all the way down the pint glass. Smells of hops, with some hops, and other hops, not to mention the floral and citrusy smells, too.

The nose is of hops, mad hops with a bit of spice. The taste makes me shocked to see that this is classified as an amber, or imperial amber as troegs calls it. To me this beer is most defenitely an IPA. Granted, imperial ambers can be somewhat hoppy, it is way too similar to an IPA. Hops dominate right up front with a strong presence. some spice through the middle but mostly just a bunch of hopalicious hoppiness with a nice bitter finish, but not too astringent. Certainly a great beer, but I dont know why this isnt just called an IPA. Mouthfeel is that of an IPA. Drinkability is quite high, as the hop flavors are very thick, but the finish is not too terribly bitter. Certainly a great beer.

694,15881,steelcutoats,4.12,"I recently attended a beer tasting at the Headkeeper in Greensburg and Troegs Brewing Co. was there handing out samples of their entire production line. The Nugget Nectar was my favorite, next to The Mad Elf, so I figured I'd buy a case of my own.  The beer poured into my trusty crystal snifter with about a quarter inch of white foam which quickly dissipated. Lacing along the inside of the glass was minimal, and the color was medium amber. The nose was sharp with hops and grapefruit-like citrus aroma. I consulted the Troegs webpage and learned that Nugget Nectar starts off with the beginnings of the HopBack Amber Ale and then they jack it up with three different types of hops. I love the idea of taking a flagship brew and then modifying it to end up with a new beer with an entirely different depth and flavor.  It's almost a shame that this is a seasonal beer and only available in February. The date on the top of the box said ""BEST ENJOYED BY 06/06/08"" so I don't see it being a good candidate for cellaring, but with an ABV of 7.5% you never know. I doubt though the rest of this case will last beyond next week, so I guess it's a moot point.

694,15881,dsa7783,5,"First thought - this is an amazing beer, and the best offering from Troegs that I've ever sampled... the appearance was absolutely outstanding... a clear, lucid, amber, copper-colored hue with a gigantic frothy and foamy head that had some serious staying power... Copped a single 12 oz bottle for $2.99 from Oak Tree in South Plainfield... Smell was above-and-beyond, so rich, so thick, so strong, that I fell in love with this beer just on the strength of its smell... the taste was an equally ""perfect five""... perhaps the ultimate and best depiction of the style that I have ever come across... this beer certainly lives up to all its hype... one of the best representations of the style for sure... mouthfeel was rich, creamy, and thick... taste was slightly bitter but not at all overwhelming, with a tart bitterness dominated by a slight ginger, subtle vanilla, and pine flavors bursting through... taste is very clear, satisfying, and dominant... an excellent brew with a good drinkability and a not-over-the-top ABV of 7.5%... Definitely recommended...",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,ColForbinBC,4.4,"(from notes) Had at the Drafting Room in Exton, PA 12oz bottle poured into a glass  Pours a crystal clear orange amber with a good sized white head. Light sticky lacing finds its way down the glass.  Huge hop smell. Ruby red grapefruits, tangerines, spruce, and a slight sweet toasted malt backbone. A very heavy hop oil/resin smell.  A big punch of hops right off the bat. Very bright and bold. Tastes of grapefruit and pine needles and a chewy caramel malt backbone. It's surprisingly not bitter with all that hopping going on.  Medium bodied and creamy.  The alcohol is nowhere to be found, but I know it's there, it's 7.5%.  An absolutely fantastic beer, about as good as it gets.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,JayQue,4.57,"Good appearance. White head, orange color good size lacing. Smell is hoppy, especially Simcoe (I would have never known this until I swilled some Double Simcoe IPA this week).  Taste is great. Floral hops, nicely balanced between bitteness and maltiness. Mouthfeel is light and crisp but not watery. Drinkability is great. 7.5 abv is a bit high for a session beer, but this one would be a great candidate for someones regular beer. Really enjoyable.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,letsgopens,4.88,"This gorgeous looking Imperial Amber Ale pours a crystal clear ruby/copper with some rusty golden highlights and a small amount of rising carbonation. The frothy, off-white head holds decently well and leaves some nice spotty lace around the glass.  Wow, this is about as hoppy as and Amber Ale gets. The name is certainly fitting. Very resinous and piney aroma with tons of citrus hop character. A smooth, sweet caramel malt backbone preps the palate for the insanely smooth and hoppy flavor to come. Bright, bitter and immensely appetizing.  One of the greatest combinations of massive flavor and smooth drinkability there is. The hops smack you in the face immediately; bold, piney, bitter, and citric: orange, grapefruit, floral notes. The caramel malt provides an amazingly smooth, semi-sweet flavor but still manages to suppress itself just enough to allow the hops to shine. There's a definite sweet, almost candy-like/bready character as well. It's so difficult to find a brew that matches this amount of intense hoppiness with a balancing counterpoint, but Nugget Nectar does it.  Bright and crisp initially with a mellow smoothness later on. In fact it's curiously smooth... kind of like Altoids in that sense I suppose. The finish is juicy and slick with a lasting smooth hoppiness. There actually may be a bit of mild dryness in there but the finish is so crazy smooth that it's difficult to detect.  I'm fairly sure there is no beer on the planet that matches the Nugget Nectar's drinkabilty and flavor combo. The smooth, palatable nature comes in such a well balanced package that I feel like I could walk around for the rest of my life with a bottle of this stuff in my hand and never get sick of it. I often hear people comparing this beer to some big hoppy IPA, but what many people fail to realize is that this is an Amber! I may be coming across as a bit dramatic but I urge you to get your hands on some of this stuff and be the judge yourself. If you're left disappointed i think you may need to get your head examined.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,RblWthACoz,4.45,"So four days from now, Tröegs is making its introduction to New York City. But I am in Pittsburgh right now, and D's had it on bottles. So, why wait. Right? I mean, four days is 5,760 minutes away. Entirely too long to wait for a beer I have wanted to try for some time now.  Pours a clear amber with a decent off white head that falls fairly quickly, but leaves nice lacing on the way down. Nose is extremely sticky syrupy sweet. Cranberry tones and firm floral tones are noticed. Flavor is very piney. This really hits firmly in your mouth, but it doesn't do so wildly. There is purpose in the chaos. Beyond the pine character, there are citrus tones backing it up. Feel is a bit thicker on the liquid and fairly full on the carbonation. Very nice. Easy to drink, even though it is thoroughly thick in hops tones.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,joe1510,4.33,"12oz Bottle  I was lucky to get a six pack of Nugget Nectar sent my way thanks to Kempleton. Nugget Nectar has a crystal clear polished copper body. Moderate streams of carbonation rise to the surface supporting the pillowy head. A one finger creamy white head appeared on the pour and stuck around for the remainder. This is without a doubt a good looking beer.  When I stick my nose in the glass Nugget Nectar makes my mouth water. There's a fair amount of toasted malt in the background but more importantly there's a boatload of hoppiness jumping out at me. The hops are mostly citric but there's some resinous hoppiness sprinkled throughout. The nose is alive with orange and apricot. There's a great candy-like sweetness.  The flavor follows in stride. The big sweet juicy fruitiness runs from beginning to end. There's enough malt in there to keep the hops from running away but it's holding on for dear life. Although there isn't a huge amount of bitterness the tongue certainly feels the hop load. This is very nicely done.  The body is spot on for the style. The body is medium with a moderate carbonation that creates a soft creaminess.  This is a very citric flavorful beer and an easy drinker without a doubt. The alcohol is no where to be found but at 7.5%, to use a too commonly used term, this is dangerously drinkable.  Nugget Nectar is one of those beers that are right up my alley. Big citric hoppiness with the tongue numbing element I love so much. It's too bad this isn't available in my area.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,jdoncbus,4.19,"*Thanks to HopHeed2113 on the beer trade*  Bottle poured into glass. Pours a copper-orange, can see through it with decent carbonation. Smallish head with heavy lacing.  Nose is blasted with a jolly rancher inspired, tangerine-grapefruit hopiness. Not much malt to be had with this one, piney notes also present. Did my 5 year old swap a Capri Sun out for a beer?  Palate smoothered with sweet hop goodness that is a cross between pineapple and mango. Toasty malt peaks through as well offering a nice balance. Crispy on the tounge, creamy notes that end with a moderate dryness.  A very nice beer, almost like a DIPA Light - I hope to see this on the shelves in Columbus some day.

694,15881,rock082082,5,"got a case locally from a distributor 2 weeks after the release of the beer in 2008. about as fresh as you'll ever get a beer without waiting for the first case from the brewery itself...  A - this beer is listed as an imperial amber and man do you get what you pay for... the color of this pour is about as true to the name as you can get. this is the prettiest red i may have ever laid eyes on... wonderful head the slowly dissipates leaving a great lace on the glass  S - since i got this as fresh as i did, you might as well have peeled a grapefruit and cracked a few pine needles to compete with this aroma. the floral aromatica smack you right away but dissipate perfectly as soon as you exhale  T - Ahhh the money shot. perfect balance of hops in the front, with a citrus rhine middle and as smooth as you can imagine in the finish. this beer is hoppy, not bitter... please understand the distinction  M - The carbonation tingles and adds the the flavor, the goldilocks theory, not too much and not too little. almost too drinkable for the ABV and the hop content  D - the fact that i am 5 deep writing this should tell you what you need to know... a perfect session beer or pregame beer... you can't beat it for the money such a shame it is a seasonal  bottom line - perfection!!!!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,tgbljb,4.32,Enjoyed on tap at Bube's Brewery. Served as a deep amber colored beer with nice off-white head. Smell is dominated by strong grassy and piney hops. Taste also shows a strong hop presence with enough malt to perform an excellent balancing act. Way too easy to drink considering the alcohol content.,Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,jeonseh,4.23,Thanks to HopHeed2113 for trading with me and giving me the chance to try this brew.  A - A deep amber hue that tends a bit more towards the reddish hues than the golden; color actually reminds me a bit of copper. The liquid has a nice shiny gloss to it and a bit of carbonation A nice bubbly and frothy head sits on top of this and leaves a nice lace.  S - Smell is a nice floral hops with a bit of orange in it as well. The hops are strong in there but not at all overpowering which is sometimes a problem. I like that I can pick up the citrus as well. There are also hints of sweet mango as well. Interesting and good smell that is gets you ready for the taste.  T - taste at first is a bit hoppy. Mostly floral hops and in a way it reminds me of the taste of alpha king. This hops slowly fades away into the sweeter fruit flavors such as mango and citrus as well; actually a bit of peach as well. Really a nice and interesting beer.  MF - a light carbonation that goes over the mouth with a light stickiness that hits the mouth later. Like how this mouthfeel moves along with the taste. Also the carbonation is not that strong at all but rather light on the tongue.  D -- this is one beer that I could drink all day. This is right up there with Alpha King that I would drink everyday and take with me to a deserted island. It is mellow and good and one of the perfect session beers that I have ever had.,Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Aromatics are strong but pleasant here.  Taste: Hop smack at first taste. Not too powerful but quite assertive. As noted in the smell, pine/floral spiciness. Another reviewer wrote ""reminds me of being out in the woods in the summer"". I can fully understand that statement now. Finish is clean.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. A little slick on the tongue.

It poured beautiful copper color with a huge white head that laced nice. pretty beer.  smelled like, well, hops :) lots of flowery hops.  Taste was of strong, flowery hops that seemed well balanced with a nice malt profile. where i cant take it is the aftertaste it left. a very perfumy, flowery taste that made me want to go brush my teeth after every swallow.  I cant drink these, but i certainly can see where a hophead would really enjoy this as it is a fine example of a hoppy yet well balanced beer.

S - strong hops. citric undertones, spicy piney notes dominate T - Hops first and foremost. piney notes with supporting citric / pineapple undertones all on top of a trace biscuit malt. M - crips, nicely carbonated, a few steps before pucker. Did leave a strong bitter after taste which did not resonate well for me. D - bold, flavorful, amazingly drinkable and all under 8% ABV.

694,15881,MuddyFeet,4,"Been sitting on this for a couple of months. Wishing I had sampled it fresh because there is definitely a drop-off in the hops.  Pours a murky orange brown with plenty of white head. Lace clings in waves around the edges of the glass. Nose has lots of sweet malts but a floral hop presence that has a nice bite to it.  Flavor has a perfect balance between the malts and the hops. Malts have a solid sweetness that clings to the edges of the tongue. Hops are bitter with flowers and clings to the cheeks. Really makes the aftertaste quite nice. However, I think these bottles are a tad old and the hops seem a bit more subdued than intended. Medium mouthfeel that lends toward the lighter side.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,davidt,4.33,"Pours crystal clear reddish-orange with a very thin head. Aroma is crisp citrus and pine. Despite the strong hop aroma, there's a nice maltiness that comes through as well. The nose gives ample forewarning of what is to follow. The taste is a mix of strong pine and citrus hops, with a nice bitterness in the aftertaste. The malt backbone carries the hops well. The mouthfeel is slightly resiny and slick. This is a fine beer that I look forward to each Spring. Troegs calls this an ""Imperial Amber Ale"". I think that's a better classification than IPA.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

The fresh one has insane retention.  Smell is of nugget hops and some crystal malts. The nugget hops are intense as hell. I love it.  Nugget hops are insane. Nice citrusy flavor that's not too much. A little pineyness. Very very nice. A little grapefruit flavor underneath with the malts. Nice toasted malts underneath. Very nice brew  Nice mouthfeel, the hop oils are not too much.  Easy to drink.

Pours a very clear amber color, some head that disappears quickly and leaves a subtle ring around the glass.  Wow, for a Red Ale, the smell is dominated by hops. Strong aroma of piney hops with a slight citrus edge, hardly any malt sweetness at all.  The taste, even though it has a strong hop aroma, is not as bitter as you would imagine. Hops do take the immediate presence and leaves a slight lingering afterwards, but the malt does a fine job of balancing this beer and making it quite smooth to go down. Alcohol is well masked by the smoothness.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,shertz,4.85,"I can't believe I didn't rate this beer last year since I drank a ton of it. However, this case is best by 06/12/08. It certainly won't make it past 2/1/08. Had it on cask this weekend but this review is for the bottle. The cask was amazing and was almost perfect. If I have one complaint(am I allowed?), it is that amber ales are a catch all for a variety of beers. West coast Ambers(Red Rocket comes to mind) are really hop bombs compared to most on the East coast. This one fits in with the great ones on the West.  A- One finger head tops out on this beautiful orange brew. Just a wonderful color.  S- When I opened this, the first whiff I got was some Vienna malts. However, it went to the wayside and the hops took over. Got an overall sweetness that just makes me want to bathe in this. Doubt the wife would enjoy that.  T- HOPS!! 93ish IBU's the Troegs website whispers. Ouch. For a hophead like me, that needs to be preached from the rooftop. Delicious!  M- Nice carbonation, very oily in texture from the hops. Some numbing on the throat.  D- If you plan on drinking a variety of beers and start with this one, forget about it. It will ruin your palate. However, its one of my favs and for the price($37/case), it really can't be beat. If hops are what your after, this is your beer.

694,15881,tempest,4.18,"This is right on the edge of maximum hops and unbalanced hoppy mess and it's on the good side. It's got an orange-amber body with a thick white head and lacing - gorgeous. The immediate aroma is one of big, juicy, fruity hops with pineapple, orange, and grapefuit and then a touch of pine. The flavor is of more juicy hops and citrus rind.

694,15881,MiScusi,4.55,"After having the new batch of 2009, I've realized this is a pretty good beer, but not really up to par with straight 5's like I thought it was the previous year. Ratings updated. ___ Major thanks to Markgugs up there in NJ for sending me a 6-pack of this. I'm going to have to get more of this ASAP while it's fresh.  A- crystal clear pale orange with a frothy finger off-white head  S- Resinous *fresh* smelling pine and citrus hops clumped together.  T- Starts really citrusy on the front end then changes into pine on the back. A pretty good bitterness is there, not over or underwhelming. As an amber ale I thought it'd be a little more malty but the malt really takes a back seat to the hops. There is a nice underlying sweetness to it, when you think about it.  M- Really pretty light here. Not viscous as expected from the 7.5% ABV.  D- Very much so.  Comparing this to some of my local IPA's I would say it's along the lines of Alpine Pure Hoppiness especially in the aroma and taste profile, but I think Nugget Nectar has a bit of a better weight to it, given that they are both about the same ABV.

Poured into a Stone IRS glass. Gorgeous clear golden-orange with 3 fingers of cream colored frothy goodness. Splendid froth, with shiny popping bubbles.  Aroma of fresh picked hops. Not of the floral variety, but of the sticky nasty kind. Another deep whiff, aahhh.  The taste is simply phenominal. I call this a Red IPA, Troegs call it an Imperial Amber. Whatever you call it, this beer is hoppy goodness. The first wave of hop flavor is floral, then comes the bitter, then the sticky coating the mouth and glazing the teeth. Perfectly balanced between 'smack in your face' and 'nice fresh IPA'.  Extremely drinkable for a 7.5% hop bomb. This one deserves 5's across the board.

Oh man, the aroma couldn't be juicier. Tons, and I mean tons of citrusy hops. Though I think the aroma is one dimensional, it is unlike any other beer I've smelled. There is also some candy sweetness rounding it out giving a nod to the toasty malts. On the palate, the hops open up even further. The ""trifecta"" of hops as they call it do some pretty good assulting, the bitterness is ever present. The finish is just slightly sweet, but man, those hops keep coming.

694,15881,ziggy13,4.47,"Had this fantastic seasonal in a colorful 12 oz. bottle poured into a tulip. This beer is a great winter seasonal every year. I always look forward to its release and its always just as I remember.  Appearence: Pours a deep amber with a modest head.  Smell: Wow what an aroma! The hops (five or so varieties) hits you right in the nose. It's a beautiful complex smell that you know will end up tasting great. No foul hop odors here.  Taste: The balanced hops just roll over your tongue. Each individual hop style is noticeable throughout every sip. It finishes beautifully sweet and the taste just lingers until the next sip.  Mouthfeel: This truly is a little heavy. That may be the beer's only problem. It's certainly not a big problem and really doesn't take away from the experience, but it had a slight molasses consistency which was surprising.  Drinkability: Because of the intense hops and chewier mouthfeel it's really not a session beer for me. One or two is perfect, however. Definitely will take your palate for a crazy ride if you have too many.  This is a fantastic Imperial Amber that is a must have every time it hits the shelves or the taps. Also, as a note, it is a great beer, but it is even better on tap. So if you walk into your local bar and see the handle staring at you, DEFINITELY indulge.

The head is about a half of an inch tall following a medium pour. The clarity of this beer is amazing with lots of bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. There's some nice head retention going on here too.  The aroma of this beer is amazing, overwhelming, and inviting all at the same time.  Taste has a pleasent citrus kick with the hops combining with the carbonation for a nice sharp bite towards the front. However, this beer finishes much cleaner than most hoppy beers. Very smooth and enjoyable beer.  Morey's Bottom Line: This is a wonderful beer! Easy to drink for a beer that weighs in at 7.5% alcohol.

Perhaps a bit acrid for me, but loaded with grapefruit, pine, maybe a bit of caramel malt for balance, but not much. No real tropical sweetness or any other flavor to balance the bitter hops.  A good beer, but a bit lacking in balance. For some reason, reminds me of the Racer series from Bear Republic.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,bosco7,4.25,Pours a copper color with a voluminous sticky head. Clarity is perfect. Attractive to say the least.  The nose on this thing is pretty obvious and pungent. Grapefruit and pine completely overwhelm the senses. Some caramel aromas behind the hops.  The bottle's artwork sums up the flavor profile very nicely. Starts with some sweet caramel and lots of juicy grapefruit flavors. This juiciness quickly becomes pithy. Pine resin flavors sting the tongue. The finish is extremely bitter with some grain husk flavors lingering. The sides of the tongue seem to be a little numb.  Mouthfeel is oily and luscious. Carbonation is perfect.  The strong point of this beer is the bright/fresh/juicy start on the tongue. While I find this beer enjoyable the finish is a little on the harsh side.

694,15881,markgugs,4.89,"2008 bottling, just released! 12 oz. bottle poured into an imperial pint glass  A: A wonderfully rich-looking dark amber color flows forth from the bottle, loads of variously-sized carbonated bottles floating upwards from the bottom of the glass. Awesome to look at, and the lovely creamy head doesn't change that.  S: Wow, just wow. Can you say, ""hops?"" I thought you could. This will NOT disappoint. The Warrior & Tomahawk hops really overwhelm the senses here...and just the right touch of malted backbone round out the smell here. Exceptional.  T/M: Fear not worrying that this beer won't taste as good as it smells; it does all that & then some. A tasty, bready malt teases the tongue to begin, and then the hops & body kick in, pulverizing your palate with wave upon wave of resinous, hoppy goodness. An exceptionally balanced level of carbonation simply beckons each additional sip. Just about damned near perfect.  D: At ""only"" 7.5%, drinking several of these won't kill you. And as good as it is, you WILL want several of these. Like, several dozen perhaps. Another HUGE winner for Troegs. Highly, highly recommended.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Nose is bursting with lots of woodsy, citrus base hops. Still more like an IPA. Very crisp and clean as it hits the tongue. Middle of the palate shows strong hop presence but even and not overpowering. A noticeable and welcome nuttie mineral feel developes tword the end of the palate.

Inviting aroma of floral hops, ripe fruit, and butterscotch.  Initial flavor is understated and subtle, but very tasty and complex. Not a wallop to the tongue. Biscuity malt, floral hops punctuated with citric bitter, toffee and butterscotch, cinnamon, ripe pear, and hints of bubblegum.  Mouthfeel is rich and full, creamy and satisfying.

Very strong malt presence with piney in your face hops.  T- I usually don't dig red ales but this one really grows on you. The malt is what dissuades me but the sheer hoppiness of this brew completely overpowers it in a good way. Definitely could be called Imperial red ale. Sweet bread character comes out a bit as it warms.  M- High amount of carbonation and about medium viscosity.  D- This is definitely a hop bomb but it does it in a way that makes you love it.

694,15881,Floydster,4.25,"12 ounce bottle acquired in a trade with MuenchenerKindl, thanks for giving me the opportunity to try this beer  2006 vintage  Poured into my Flying Dog imperial pint glass with a golden red color, surprising how light the color was, the head was little over an inch and was white with foam that did not budge for two or three minutes  Smell was nice with different types of citrus, some grassy scents,  Taste was good as well, lots of hoppiness, both piney and fruity, there was grapefruit, lemon, oranges, and tangerines, to go along with a dry hoppy finish that left a charcoal taste on the tongue, nice balance of sweet malt to go long with the complex hop profile, several different hops were used in this one most likely, as it warmed the citrusy hops came out more and I actually preferred them to when the beer was colder, this tasted more like an IPA when it is all said and done rather than a red ale, its color and appearance made me think this as well, great balanced taste overall that offered strong hoppy flavor and nice long tasty finish  Lots of carbonation in this one still, above average body, and the taste lasted a pretty long time  Could drink a six pack of this probably, definitely wanted more after one bottle, light and easy to drink, alcohol content is fairly high though, it is hidden very well  Nugget Nectar is one of the best ambers I have ever had, I particularly like the fruity hops in it, I highly recommend this winter seasonal to anybody that get their hands on it",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,irishkyle21,4.12,"I believe this is last years release. Still one awesome brew. The hops are fading slightly but they are still very dominant. I would love to have a fresh bottle of this but I am very happy none the less thanks to BillyB for the bottle. The only thing I found disappointing was the look. I gave it a fairly sturdy pour and got a medium sized head that turned soap like rather quickly and there was little lacing to be found. The color on the other hand is a nice lightly hazy golden orange.  The nose is still kicking. Notes of sweet caramel malt, pine, a bit of citrus, a blend of fruits, pepper and just a bit of fading hops.  The palate is very well put together. Lots of chewy malts, caramel, pine, citrus and some spices. I will be seeking this one out next time I'm in the U.S.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,CharlieMopps,4.03,"Vintage 2006, Aged 8 months.  A: Translucent, glowing orange sunburst hue that's rather hazy, topped by about a finger of white head that takes its time sticking around, as well as sticking to the sides of the glass.  S: Mellow herbal and somewhat grassy hop aroma, some spiciness evident. There's also a sweetness that accompanies the hop presence, though it's subtle and underneath.  T: Reflects the nose quite well. A pale malt introduction provides the basis for the varied hop profile, that is mostly grassy and spicy, but subdued. There is a brief hint of sweetness that waxes and wanes during the middle, washing into a slightly dry finish where the hop residue fades perfectly.  M: Carbonation is at an optimal level, giving some body and creaminess to the beer's texture on the palate. Slight bit of hop oil on the tongue, but not an overwhelming amount at all.  D: While being drinkable as all hell, this beer is not quite as good as I recall it being. I've had it fresh, and aged for a year or just over, but not really anywhere in between.

694,15881,younger35,4.65,"Received this brew in a trade with tpd975. That man continues to hook my ass up. Says its a hophead nirvana with a trifecta of Nugget, Warrior, and Tomahawk hops sitting at 93 IBUs. Nice! Drank from my Rogue Kells Irish Lager pint glass.  Appearance- Pours a light pinkish orange with a bit of chill haze. Very nice one finger off white head that recedes very very slowly. Once it does disappear, it leaves a fantastic cap and collar that manages to leave some random, chucky lacing. Smell- Lots of huge citrus jumps out of the glass leaning toward fresh juicy grapefruit and lightly peachy. Also hints of bubblegum show along with a very soft toffee underbelly. Very fresh, very clean, very inviting. Taste- Whoa! Not what I was expecting. The big citrus of the hops really shows from the start with a light grapefruit/lemon zest kick. A bit of an almost spicy pepper kick is present as well. Strange but very enjoyable. The best and most surprising part of this beer is the great malt bill that holds its own against the hops. Lightly toasty with a great caramel/bubblegum/cotton candy like sweetness that I really enjoy. Finishes with a lingering bitterness and zero interference from the alcohol. Mouthfeel- Slick and oily with a nice full body and medium carbonation that is very prickly on the tongue. Drinkability- This is the best imperial non-stout beer Ive had in a long time (with exception of Gumballhead, I know, not a stout or Imperial but it was freaking awesome). Its got the hop pop to grab your attention and the malt balance to make you yearn for more. I need to figure out a way to get a sixer of this stuff in a trade for my drinking enjoyment.

To be honest, I don't understand what the big deal is with this beer. I had some high expectations, and was somewhat disappointed. The flavor was rather earthy, but nothing really jumped out at me. I passed the glass around to see if I was crazy, but everyone had the same opinion that I did... Hopefully it was just a bad bottle.

694,15881,marksto,4.22,"Sought out, sampled, and reviewed at GABF this year after seeing the high ratings here. Glad I did.  Pours medium amber in color, good clarity, with medium head and retention. Strong hops in the nose with some malt in the background. Hops seem almost noble in character, spicy with little citrusy elements like usually found with west coast varieties. Flavor offers a delicious interplay between malt and hop - beautifully balanced. Also has a delicate fruitiness with some caramel and and light toasty notes underlying it all.  Surprised to read it is 7.5% alcohol - I didn't pick that up in flavor or aroma.

694,15881,IronDjinn,3.95,"Pours out a decent coppery hue. Frothy off-white head that leaves residual lacing.  Decent cluster of grassy, herbal hops on the nose, very faint caramel malt in the background.  Sweet chewy malt in the flavour, nicely rounded out by the hops, which really only kick in towards the latter part of the finish. The sweetness of the malt still carries on throughout into the aftertaste.  Medium-bodied mouthfeel, even light in areas, but smooth and velvety all the same, it works.  Not overtly bold, but a decent amber ale, if only most of them were wired this way. Enough there in all areas to let you know where you've been and what you've done.

694,15881,seaoflament,4.5,"Thanks to franksnbeans for the trade.  Pours a nice, clear golden color with a finger of off-white foam. Smell is similar to an ipa but not as assertive as the best ones. Pine and citrus as well as orange and a slight grapefruit aroma with a nice touch of sweetness from the malt. The taste is more malt and more in liking with an amber ale but what distinguishes this beer is the nice hoppy aroma. Toasty and biscuit malt flavors combine nicely with the hops as the beer starts to warm a bit. I believe I sense a little bitterness but my prior drink (DIPA) might be numbing my tongue a bit. Surprised to find out that this is a 7.5% beer, almost seems like it could be a session beer. A really nice amber to try, one of the best, if not the best I have had so far (that's not an imperial red that is).  *updated review. Thanks to ncvbc for sending me a fresh bottle of this fine beer. Bottled 1/11/08*  Pours an amber color with a thick inch an a half of foam. (4)  Pine aromas with lots of toast and caramel. Citrus hops follow closely; some grapefruit and orange. Very well balanced in the aroma, the pine and citrus hops blend very well with the toasty and caramel malt. (4)  Taste is well balanced for the most part, medium bitterness with pine and toast. Flavors are mostly toast, toffee, caramel, pine and citrus peel. There's also the slightest metallic flavor in the aftertaste. (4)  Mouthfeel is just a tad thin but easy to drink.

Consumed in June 2007, review is from notes rediscovered during a little housecleaning... ""93ish IBU...Nugget, Warrior, Tomahawk hops...""  A: One-finger of dense ivory foam caps a lightly hazy amber orange, tinged with ruby. Despite millions of tiny bubbles in the clustered & sudsy head when settling, just a scattering of rising carbonation shows through the glass. Very pretty bands of sticking lace.

Superbly balanced malt/sweet, dancing to and fro between each. A little more stamina and this could have been a '5' for me.  T: Big, fresh-squeezed orange and grapefruit - pulp, pith and all. Some oily, resinous pine clings on the back of the tongue. Caramel and maltiness some repressed to me, creating some imbalance. Bitter finish, but with traces of lasting sugars.  M: Lightly carbonated and smooth. Some warming clings on the tongue and cheeks, thickening with each sip. Mouthfeel is medium.

There is nice and thick curtain of lacing left behind along with an oily residue.  S: Yes this is nectar all right. A most wonderful hop aroma here. Grapefruit, Orange Juice, Star Fruit, and Pine. It also has an almost buttery sweetness about it. Man I can't wait to drink it.  T: Holy Mackerel! Love It, Love It, Love It. An Absolutely Wonderful beer. The hops are front and center right from the start. My senses are overloaded. The citrus taste of the hops overcomes me. The aroma from the glass as I am taking the first sip rushes through my nose. It is just a wonderful drinking experience. The malt balances it out nicely. The taste don't linger it finishes kind of crisp and dry. Pure Hop Juice baby.

694,15881,BuckSpin,4.39,"Presentation: 12oz bottle in a Shaker pint  I enjoy a good red/amber (boy, there is a conversation to walk in on) so I was excited to get the chance to try this.  Poured strong, thick, smooth n' quiet. Wow...guess they weren't kidding about the hops! Without question the hoppiest nose on any Amber/Red Ale I've ever encountered. Blindfolded I would guess IPA, and a good one at that. Great citrused hops, full of grapefruit, a little pineapple, even some pine sap. It has a sweet quality to it, perhaps the grapefruit, also some syrupy qualities, perhaps some treacle or light caramel. Some straw qualities come thru as it blooms. Head was a 1/8"" inch of loose pale lemon ivory foam that faded very quickly to a thin sheen of a floater and edge ring that laced in very isolated splotches. The color of golden honey, its thick, slightly hazy, isolated bubbles rise very slowly thru it.  Mmm...this is a Amber/Red? Damn! Beautifully hopped, lightly bitter, resonating with pine & grapefruit. Crisply dry, the dryness offsets the thick, sweet syrupy twang & mouthfeel very nicely as well as adds some tooth to the already sharp hops. Smooth up front, very balanced. Malts are sweet with caramel, yet dry & even a bit rocky with a straw like aspect. I've never tasted a Amber (sigh, not like that) like this. I would guess IPA in a minute if I didn't know.  The velvet like smoothness continues thru to the palate where it really spreads out, growing almost perfectly even...no real extremes or highs/lows are noticeable as it dissipates, a most peculiar sensation given how sweet, hopped & syrupy it is. It does grow bittersweet with citric, rocky hops on the throat as it finishes, leaving a filmy, painted, piney after bite with a pleasing lil' caramel kiss as it fades away.  A damn fine beer, and a fantastic Amber/Red. The sweet, thick malts & piney citric hops (off the top of my head) would pair well with just about anything I can think of, but right now I'm craving a real good deli sandwich and fries. Highly recommended, one of the best of its genre I've had. An excellent beer, check it out.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Brewfan,4.33,"Recieved surprise bottle from NikkisLiquors. Thanks a bunch Mikey!  Poured into my tall, slim nonic type glass from Pizza Port Nice and frothy off-white head. Lots and lots of bubbles. Great lacing. Thick sheets of head and lace grace about 3 fingers of the glass. Foam finally subsides to a 1/2 inch and stays throughout the beer. Clear, clean amber color, bordering on an orange hue. No discernable carbonation. Immediate punch of resiny, citrus hops on the nose, but the balance of malty sweetness soon comes forward. Pine and some slight pithyness is definitely still there, but fades behind a sweeter nose. Bigger flavor than any Amber I've had before. Hoppy citrus is a perfect contrast to the malty sweetness. Beautiful balance. Bitterness comes through more towards the end. There's no indication in the flavor that this is 7.5%. Extremely drinkable. But as an Amber/Red it should be, so that's no suprise. The surprise is how well balanced the hops and malt are. That's the beauty of this beer.

It had a very small head that settled into a constant thin film with good lacing. The aroma was extreme citric hops. Reminds me of an IPA or DIPA instead of an amber. Definitely gets you excited to try it. The taste was outstanding. You get that great hops bite without the bitter end that you find in some IPA/DIPA's. This one goes down smooth from start to finish.

694,15881,NeroFiddled,4.42,"I think what most people miss about the beautifully hop-dripping Nugget Nectar ale is the malt base underneath. It's not the common, normally expected pale and crystal malt base (and that may seem a bit odd given the ""amber"" designation - at the very least it's not expected, more English malts are the usual) but this is really a beautifully formulated ""lager-type"" malt base. Of course they use an ale yeast, but the malts are so much softer and smoother and, in actuality, not really caramelish. It's really more of an Oktoberfest with ale yeast and bold American hops - and that's what sets it apart.  The hop selection of bold Americans (Nugget, Warrior/Tomahawk, Simcoe, Palisade), and the fact that they haven't slammed you over the head with them is the second half. But that's what Troeg's have always done... they take their beers to the edge and stop, giving you just enough to make you want to jump over the ledge, but also enough to make you want to stay and have another one before you go more! They keep it drinkable! Arrrghhhh.... perhaps TOO drinkable!!! You raise the glass to your nose and you smell that pungent, resinous, fruity, citrusy, grassy, and piney/spruce-like hop chharacter and it's like sticking your face in the opening of a freshly opened 44 pound bag of hops!  The flavor is velvety smooth in its roundness of flavor, despite the rock solid bitterness (once again, not overdone!), and displays the malts first and the hops second (at least until you get halfway into the glass). It finishes with a film of lingering maltiness and grassy, citrusy, and piney hops left on the palate.  In conclusion, I've found this beer to be a personal favorite for all-around drinkability due to depth of character (both in malt and hops), and drinkability. It packs strength, but it's still along the lines of an IPA. It's got a great malt and hop component, and it's superbly balanced. I enjoy it on tap any time I can find it, and I highly recommend you give it a try!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

694,15881,brewdlyhooked13,4.54,"Appearance - orange amber with a thin head. Kind of a flat white holding at a thin but complete covering. Sketchy lacing, sometimes a lot, sometimes nothing on different parts ot the glass.  Aroma - heavy, syrupy grapefruit and pine, reminds me of Dreadnaught. Hints of caramel. A very hop intense amber - well, *Imperial* amber... great aroma regardless.  Taste - malty, biscuity up front, big mouthful of juicy, citrusy, piny hops on the swallow. Lots of flavor, completely obscuring the abv. The aftertaste is very dry, a remnant of oranges and the soft steady burn of Nugget, Warrior, and Tomahawk hops. A slight warming in the belly is the best indication of this brew's potency.  Mouthfeel - plenty of smoothness and creaminess. Somewhat heavy, fits the 'Imperial' bill well.  Drinkability - limited sessionability but limitless flavor. This is an enjoyable six-pack to have around, I would bet. A bit of a style jumper. That is, B# is to C as an Imperial amber is to IPA (they're the same!). Thanks to todd1 for a sample of this fine brew.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,dwarvenspirits,4.47,"Poured a nice thick white head, which laced up nice on the glass.  Aroma - Pine, grass, can I say Earth? and spice to this aroma. One would think you would be drinking dirt with the smell of this, but lo . . . keep reading  color - nice light orangish hue to it with lots of carbonation  mouthfeel - is good, not overwhelming but the flavors roll over your tongue very nicely.  Taste - Flavor hops burst through, followed by bitterness and a classic dry finish. Can't taste any alcohol in this. Can't taste much malt flavor either. Piney, resinous, slight citrus, earthy flavors right up front. The bitterness is just a touch harsh. I think it could be balanced a bit more but hey, it's their beer.  Very drinkable, especially on a hot summer day. They should release this a little later than what they do. Easy drinking with not a huge body which is great.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

694,15881,Risser09,4.43,12 oz. Bottle - February 2007 Bottling - Served At Fridge Temperature Into A Wine Glass  Appearance: Bright orange beer with no cloudiness at all. Head has great retention and very close to a full white color. Tiny bubbles form larger craterous dimples on the minicus of the head. Very appealing.  Smell: Grapefruit and lemon. Hoppiness and slight malt sugar.  Taste: Not very harsh and quite quaffable. Subtle grapefruit but more pine bitterness upon swallowing. Bitter pine and lingering fruit on the finish. Not overly sweet.  Mouthfeel: Smoothe and controllable. Carbonation has little presence. Drying bitterness forces me to drink on.  Dirnkability: Awesome. This beer is in it's own class. I have never really had something so unique that probably demands it''s own category. Interesting and I will buy some every year from now on.,Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Aroma is fruity hops...orange peel, lemon, grapefruit and a touch of pine oils.  Taste is a DELICIOUS sweet malt with pleasantly bitter hops...lots of fresh orange, lemon, and grapefruit...nothing too sharp or bitter...just wonderfully fresh and alive and perfectly balanced with the sweet malt.  This is one very, very yummy beer.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,kajerm,4.25,"Pours a beautiful orange-amber that would be a 4.5 or a 5 for sure, but the beer is too clear and the head is a little bit smaller than I was expecting. Lacing is perfect though, forming an ivory white plate around the inside of the glass.  The aroma is one of the most unusual hop profiles I've smelled in an America IPA--and BA style designation be damned, this IS an IPA (or a DIPA)-- a pine, mango, and citrus base with a decent-sized dosed of herbal, Saazy smell. I like it a lot, and if it smells this good again, I'll rate it up accordingly.  Opens up with hop-derived fruity sweetness that comes into focus mid-palate as a peach-apricot hop flavor. Finishes with measured bitterness. This is one of the best examples of flavor-hopping I've tasted. Most IPAs (Stone is a notable offender here) beat you over the head with citrus in the nose, then beat you over the head again with bitterness without having any mid-palate at all.  Nugget Nectar doesn't fall into that trap-- Troëgs brewed this to make every aspect of the hops shine, and the flavor is one of the big factors in it.  The mouthfeel is another one-- creamy, with very fine, subtle carbonation; soft, slick, smooth, perfect.  7.5%ABV is actually pretty light for a beer like this, and lends it a lot of drinkability.  Now if the damn brewery would just start releasing more of it...",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

This beer had poor head retention after I cleaned my pint glass thoroughly with h2o. It is a bit cloudy (not a bad thing for me). And definitely sticks to its guns being a hopped up beer. I want to say a nice taste of crystal malts mixed with a copious amount of hops -not balanced, but don't think that is what the brothers were going for here. To me, it taste a bit like an IPA and has a malty aftertaste.  ...cmp",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Pours a somewhat clear light copper hue with a one finger white fluffy head that dies down to a thin layer. Stickiness is all over the place, good lacing. Smell is of a very piney, grassy, citrusy hop explosion. This is an amber ale? Taste is one of a kind. Delicious piney hop burst up front but then ending with a very smooth caramel malt goodness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a fair to good amount of carbonation. Somewhat oily in the mouth as well, but not discouraging at all.

S: smells like a really well made IPA, even though it's not. Fresh hops, good malty tones to bring away from the bitterness. pretty simple, really...  T: A little dissapointed here. Semes like this one would have been better fresh. The hops just don't deliver like I know they should. That being said, it's still a damn good beer with a damn good taste. No particular flavor triumphs over the others, just a balanced, well crafted brew. Still pretty hoppy conisdering the age.  M: Exceptional mouthfeel. Carbonation is fantastic. Just a little swirlinng of the mug, and I've got a brand new one finger head. Amazing. It's balanced and it just works well for the beer.  D: This beer keeps tasting better with every sip.

While pouring, I was already blessed with the smell of those wonderful graperfruity hops. The color was a true amber color- a deep orange (almost red)- tons of spiderweb lacing and a small amount of head, although after the first sip it disappeared.  Oh so bitter- oh so hoppy- oh so good.  The 7.5% abv is well hidden but after two it crept up on me. This is a beer that is so drinkable it is almost scary- I'm in love.

Attractive amber/brown colour with a small, quickly fading head. Lots of sticky lacing on this one. Aroma is powerful citrus hops, right from the get go (as soon as the bottle was uncapped). A little bit of soapiness and earth in there as well. Flavour is surprisingly balanced after the hop blast, with a solid backbone of caramel/vanilla malt supporting the grapefruit-and-pine hops. Some definite yeasty and roasted notes in there as well. Great body, oily mouthfeel, and a bitter but not astringent aftertaste.

694,15881,nlmartin,4.8,"This beer was served in a Imperial Pint glass. This review is based off of the second Nugget Nectar poured into this glass.  Appearance: The beer pours a clear amber coloration. The head is dense and has a biege coloration. The head was 2 fingers thick with very good staying power. Thick streams and webs of lacing remain behind on my glass.  Smell: The hops produce a three way assault on my sense of smell. The hops are grassy, grapefruit citrus and pine resin. This smells like a hop heads delight. The hops tag along with a major malt backbone. The toasted caramel maltyness supports the hops well.  Taste: The taste of the beer is exceptional. The hops come on strong with grapefruit citrus and a long lasting pine resin. The caramel maltyness has a great toasted flavor. The flavors are long lasting and balanced.  Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The body of the beer is medium. The carbonation complements the beer well. This has quickly become one of my beer glasses constant companion. some folks may not be able to session this beer due to ABV; however, I am a fairly big guy and it sessions fine for me.

The only thing I can compare it to is opening a fresh, 1-ounce package of juicy hops. Pungent, herbal, resinous, funky, piney and blissfully hoppy. Ahh, but I can now also pick up traces of caramel and butterscotch malt.  Hop flavors and bitterness explode onto the palate. Juicy, resinous, funky, and delicious. Did I mention juicy? Some pine and a little citrus in there too. Toasted caramel malts combine with slightly boozy fruit to give some semblance of balance. Finish is cookie dough and pine resin citrus hop bitterness.

This is followed by some nice hops. Mostly pine and citrusy flavors. I wish the hops were a little bit more pronounced.  Taste: The taste is kind of mild even compared to the aroma. There is a nice balanced blend of malts and hops. The biscuity malts balance out the gentle pine and citrusy hops.  Mouthfeel: This starts slightly creamy. The sweetness of the malt and the piney hops hang around for a while.  Drinkability: See as this is 7.5%, this goes down very smooth. If this were available locally, I'd buy this as a regular in my beer fridge.  Overall: A very nicely balanced IPA (Imperial Red).

This has got a big grassy hop aroma with a sharp bitter edge that is seriously inviting to a hophead. The nose is balanced nicely with malt.  More balance in the flavor than the nose. A nice malty character mixed with the grassy and a little citrusy hops. Hops finish with a heavy bitter grapefruit taste, and the malt stays along for the whole ride.  This (Imperial?)

The head is moderately long lasting, and leaves ample rings of sheeting along the glass sides.  With 4 kinds of hops (Nugget, Warrior, Simcoe & Palisades), this ""Imperial Amber"" (as Troeg's describes it) has a real hop nose! Mostly floral in content, but also very citric (grapefruit rinds).  The taste is HUGE, with a floral hop presence, and a solid malt background. With the many varieties of hops used, the hop taste is also varied, with a citric taste behind the floral. The hops dominate all the way down to the last sip. This is a hop head's delight. This is the first ""Imperial Amber"" I've had, and even if it's a statement beer from Troegs, it's a good statement! Mouthfeel is medium full, with carbonation that is right on. Alcohol content is not 'over the top' (7.5%) and was not detectable in the taste.

The aroma is a mix of pine and citrus, with the pine fading faster leaving citrus and some type of sweet malty aroma hiding somewhere under those hops. The flavor starts sweet and malty. Then a quick hit of hop bitterness flies in before a prolonged period of hop flavor, which gives a profile that covers everything from grassy to fruity. The hop bitterness comes back for the aftertaste and lingers long enough to make you want another sip... which you will take.  I love the beers that bring several distinct waves of flavor. Even though this has ""93ish"" IBU's I do not think that the bitterness overwhelms the malt and hop flavors. Everything has a chance to take center stage for a second. Highly drinkable.

694,15881,instrumentality,4.09,"Note: This is perhaps a somewhat unfair review since I'm reviewing it based on the fact that it tastes like a weak IPA rather than reviewing to style. For an amber, it's pretty damn good.  I received this brew a couple months ago as part of a highly lopsided (in my favor) trade with BA sirhc. Not only did he hook me up with this brew, but I also got a sneak preview when we passed a bottle around at a recent meeting. I remember liking it, but I don't remember much. Now I get a full dose to myself. I'm looking forward to it.  Keeping a level playing field, this is about the 900th beer in a row that I've poured into my Stone IRS tulip glass. Its appearance was nothing special - a light, transparent copper body with a finger of foam that didn't hold out for long before descending into a murky lace surrounded by a white halo. Reminds me a bit of Sierra Nevada Pale Ale.  A little swirl and sniff revealed some awesome citrusy hops. This, clearly, is where the ""nectar"" begins to come into play - a mix of sweet tangerine, sour grapefruit, and pine. My breathing, as usual, is a little obstructed, and I can still get enough of a sense of the odor for my mouth to water.  The first sip was not quite what I expected, but it was still tasty. A bit of piney and grapefruity bitterness kicks things off, followed by a warming, smooth, creamy honey-like flavor and texture and a splash of tangerine. I expected the sweetness to be more dominant, but the brew was actually well-balanced - not too sweet, not too bitter.  I remember reading that this brew is best consumed fresh, so perhaps I waited too long, but it wasn't quite as flavorful as I had expected. The flavors that were present were good, but not quite potent enough, and the body felt a bit watered down. Good for drinkability, bad for mouthfeel.  I remember enjoying this beer much more when I sampled it initially, so one of these days I'll have to track down a fresh batch and give it another shot.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

But it is nonetheless very delicious, and light enough to have in the afternoon.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,rabsten,4.97,"This beer is awe inspiring. I love it. I've been busy this past six weeks or so and largely missed my opportunity to quaff some on tap while it was available. Then, this past Tuesday at Sharp Edge Creekhouse, I made up for it.  Lovely clear orange-amber, thick head, good lacing. Sticky lacing, too. Just a fine beer to look at.  Sweet, sweet floral hop character to the aroma. Perfect, as far as I'm concerned. Almost orange blossom-y in nature. The promise of nuggety hop goodness awaits.  And flavor-wise, the promise is fulfilled. Explosion of floral hops, with mild pine and citrus in the background. Smooth and not overly bitter.  Perfectly balanced mouth feel, immensely refreshing. Goes down smooth and clean. Highly drinkable.  Bottom line: Awe inspiring. I'm just kicking myself that I haven't spent the last month getting this everywhere it's available. To make up, I'm getting two cases this afternoon.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,jjayjaye,4.12,"Pours a light golden amber color with better than a full finger fluffy white head that resists fading. A nice amount of lacing is present.  The smell is aggressive citrus orange and floral pine with a basic malt undertone.  The mouth feel is immediate and consuming hops. It's not overly carbonated.  Past the HOP sensation there is underlying sweet flavor that tends to linger some.  I'm giving it a WOW for complexity and imagination. Drinkability - i enjoy it, but i can see myself drinking more than one at a sitting.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

694,15881,drseamus,4.2,"This beer pours a slightly darker amber color. It has a white head that falls quickly. The aroma is overwhelmingly hoppy grapefruit. A very American hoppy aroma overall. The flavor is surprisingly smooth. There is very little hop bitterness compared to the aroma but a bunch of hop flavor mostly consisting of grapefruit flavors. The background is very smooth and the beer is very balanced overall.  On a side note, how does get classified as an Imperial Amber instead of an Imperial IPA? I realize that it's an amber, but I would easily fit into the Imperial IPA category.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Metalmonk,4.22,"Modest bumpy bone-white head comprised of bubbles of all sizes. But the head doesn't last very long. The color is copper/amber with good clarity. Lace appears in small dots.  Aroma is a prickly hops leaning toward citrus, especially orange and some lemon too.  Flavor is where it's at, providing a depth of flavor that takes you through the whole spectrum of all that hops can offer. Succulent fruits, bitter grapefruit rind, flowery perfume-laced delicateness, earthy huskiness...well-incorporated with the rest of the ingredients. Malt backbone is firm while playing a subtle role, highlighting the depth-heavy orange-leaning hop flavor. Finishes sweet and tangy.  Higher carbonation level makes things sizzle...would've liked a little less action in this department, but I'm sure others think it's just fine. And it is. No big complaint really.  Strikes these tastebuds as more IPA than Amber Ale, but whatever, this is a delicious lip-smacking offering from the high-quality Troegs brewery.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,hunteraw,4.2,"Appearance: Coppery orange in color, good sized white head and retention, some lacing.  Smell: Juicy, citrusy hops, with a good dose of caramel. Nice.  Taste: Wouldn't have guessed it was 7.5% alcohol. Maltier than I expected, but I guess that's what makes it an amber rather than an APA. Flavor profile is much the same as the nose: juicy, citrusy hops and caramel malts.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, medium-body, good carbonation.  Drinkability: Good, but body a little heavy for the style perhaps.

Beautiful bright amber color with a huge billowy head and excellent lacing. Strong grapefruit and citrus, tons of bread, and spicy hop bitterness. Roasted, toffee malt, and light cookies. A hugely hoppy beer that's basically perfectly balanced. One of my favorite beers of all time.  ORIGINAL: 3/18/07 - 4.5/5/4.5/4.5/4.5 12 oz bottle into a mug. Pours a fairly strong copper-orange color with a nice two finger white head. Lacing forms immediately. Crystal clear beer. Strong nose, lots of hops right off the bat. Spices and scent of sweet dried apricots. Excellent smell. Nice taste, although not as hoppy as the scent would have you expect. Fairly nice balance of hops and malt, actually. Son enough, though, the fairly strong hops hit you. Nice floral esters. Light fruity flavors as well, that apricot is sitting in the background. Nice mouthfeel, medium body with good carbonation. Overall, another great beer from Troegs (I seem to say that a lot). I am consistently impressed with the originality and quality of their beers. This one's right up there with the Hopback for me, a really excellent beer.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,IgnatiusReilly,4.73,"Poured from 12oz brown bottle to a tall pint glass at home on a rainy St. Patricks Day afternoon.  A: Brilliant orange/amber coloring. Very clear. Nice thick head, about a finger plus, with loads of retention. Gorgeous. S: All hop citrus in the nose. Mostly grapefruit and a little pine scent. Can also catch a faint scent of malt sugar coming through. T: The hop oils burst in your mouth immediately. Tons of hop spiciness, both the citrus/grapefruit flavor as well as the piney/bitter bite. Towards the middle you have the slightest hint of caramel of the malt sugars, but the ending is back with the hops allowing for a dry finish and warm alcohol glow. M: Good amount of carbonation helps the hop flavor pop in your mouth. Slick and mouth-coating. D: Very. Big 7.5%abv, but not so much that itll wear you out quickly. Not overwhelming for an imperial. Definitely could have a few.  This is excellent for hopheads. Although the hops completely dominate, theres still enough malt sugar in here that it doesnt come off as astringent or too bitter. A full, well-balance beer. Exceptional, and as far as big IPA's go, I'm not sure you could ask for too much more.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Looks brilliant.  Strong smell of sweet, wet hops. No doubt this is a hoppy, American beer.  Punch of bitter hops up front... strong, sweet malty flavor through the middle, finishes clean due to the carbonation levels, citrusy-sweet hop flavors lingering afterwards. Great resiny-hop-stickiness left behind--perfect. I love enjoying an IPA/amber with great malt flavor to complement the hops. Very well done. Very well-balanced. I need a case of this stuff.

Drinkability is good, it's easy drinking and is a tasty beer that will make it's ABV known if you end up drinking too many.

694,15881,JerzDevl2000,4.77,"So here I am in 2011. Out of college for 10 months, jobless, and not a lot of prospects on the horizon. Those of you in the northeast who are reading this can vouch that we've had another ""winter from hell"" with a ton of ice, salt and gray days. Of course, I've been drinking my heavy Stouts and leftover holiday beers during this time but now that March is here, the days are growing warmer and longer. Sure enough, there must be something to look forward to, right?  As you probably surmised, that's where this beer comes in. I first brought this to my lips 5 years ago and from that point on, there was no looking back. Sure, Hoegaarden, the Sam seasonals, and the Ommegang Hennepin will always be the beers that showed me what was possible with 4 ingredients and some TLC in the brewing process, but if there was anything that served as the tipping point in my journey through the malted barley beverages of the world, there's no doubt that this was it.  I always get my beers from the same local store here in Jersey where they take beer seriously and attempt to match the brews up with the customer preferences. I was never picky and would try anything at least once - which remains true to this very day - but this came in late late February of 2006, I was told that this was the real deal and worth the hype. Being the skeptic that I was and still am to a slight extent, I wasn't sure what to expect.  As you can probably guess, this is where I get my bluff called. Bought it, brought it home, and gave it a good crack on a somewhat mild night not unlike the one we're having in New Jersey tonight. To say that nothing compared to this would be an understatement. For starters, the aroma was so perfect that I swear that this was brewed as a unit and not a collection of different hops. Not only did it fill my pint glass, but I could smell it from at least a foot or two away once I opened the bottle up.  To top it off, the hue was a gorgeous, radiant amber with a fluffy head that lasted quite a while. Tasting this beer was so difficult because of the multitude of cascading flavors that meshed so well together. The pine, citrus, resin, metallic, grassy, and earthy notes are all here but nothing shouts out over the others. Rather, the music that they create is that of the sphere as they all fit in perfect harmony, leading to an aftertaste that only has a hint of alcohol and all of the warming and beautiful bitterness that one would expect from a bright, hoppy beer.  It didn't even matter that this didn't qualify as a session beer. Every time I've opened one of these since the first time I tried it, it's been damn near impossible to keep this in my glass for any extended period of time. To me, that's a mark of a beer's drinkability - how long is lasts in my glass and how I feel while drinking it, regardless of how long it takes to work my way to the bottom.  Since that day 5 years ago, I've had quite a few beers and have done a lot of reading on this site regarding what's popular and what people think of this. Sure, this is beat out on the rankings but a lot of Stouts and Imperial Pale Ales that are strong and more potent in the alcohol and flavor departments. No matter - like any great craft beer, this varies a bit year by year but I still get the same sense of wonder and amazement every year when I crack one of these open and realize that another winter is nearly in the books. Say what you wish, this may never be #1 in anyone else's book but it'll always hold a special place in mine. The way it's taken a grip on me is the same way I feel when I have the last one of these ever year in early April and given how much I love this beer, I wouldn't want it any other way. Nothing makes me smile quite like this, even after all of these years.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Absumaster,4.32,"Thanks to todd1 for this one!  Appearance was clear, light amber or dark orange with almost no head, just some lacing on the side of the glass. Some visible carbonation.  Smell is sweet lemonade of oranges and grapefruits. The raw hops are citric and resinous with some pine, very aromatic. The smell of the hops are a little bit pushed back by the sweetness. Great smell though, not something I have smelled before.  Taste is less sweet than the smell would suspect. There is the maltiness combined with a good citric, grapefruittaste and some fresh mowed grass. There is also some hard candy with orange and in general exotic fruit taste. Amazing how well balanced this beer is. The bitterness is not even that high, I expected it to be more aggresive. This must be because of the body. Body is medium and balance is superb.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

There is a little bit of malt prescence, emphasis on the little; this one is plenty hoppy with the same attributes as noted in the nose. Highly carbonated with less than medium body. This is pretty good, would definately drink more of it and it would probably find a good home in my fridge if not for it's distance from me.

Buried the malt nose out. Great hop aroma, like freshly crushed hop cones.  Fresh clean hop tastes piney,grapefruity, with some burnt carmellness. Very hoppy not much maltiness,yet it has a balanced feel. The hoppiness was intense but not overwelming.  Has a light mouthfeel,not real malty the hoppiness gave an oil slick feel. Can't belive how smooth this beer was with all the hoppiness. Increadible. Goes down easily,feels so light the hoppiness just creeps up on you slowly,it just doesn't overtake the palate. Leaves a great hop taste lingering on and on. The drinkability is unbeliveable for the hoppiness,the great hoppy taste makes me want to keep drinking this beer.

The taste is so wonderfully balanced - hops punch you in the face to start with a very nice malty & sweet finish. Absolutely incredible. Mouthfeel is crisp and creamy - so good.

This bottle isn't as good as the last one, it's been sitting in my garage 3 weeks and is showing early signs of getting skunked, but it's still a great beer, slight metalic taste at the edges. Still very tasty, finishes bitter. Mouthfeel is enhanced by good carbonation, a little malt-stickiness, bitter astringency. It's solidly medium-bodied with a little oiliness.

Definitely a lot of sweet, caramel fragrances too.  Taste - A malt character not unlike toasted flatbread--lots of flavor, but not so much body and richness that it overwhelms the senses. The grapefruit smell also makes its presence known in the taste, and there's an underlying bitterness that just noticeable as the sip is finished and lingers on for a little bit longer.  Drinkability - Too tasty and delectable for 7.5%. This one is trouble. And I mean that in a very good way.

The first sip is nice on the tongue and has a malty feel rather than the over the top pine resin notes of a overhopped beer. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and goes down real nice. A lite hop tingle remains on the tongue afterwards. The ABV of this beer around 7.5, but you would not know it from the sample and it could get you if you are not on your game..

I waited a dew minutes for the head too settle and took a whiff. The smell was of nice dank, grassy hops and a little floral. The taste did not disappoint and also had a floral and grassy taste. It was very herbal, dank, and completely delicious. Nugget Nectar is very easy to drink given the smooth mouth-feel and the fact that the alcohol doesnt seem to be present to the taste.

There is no reason why I shouldn't give this a ""5"" but I haven't seen a ""5"" and can't say any beer has had the perfect appearance.  S: Major hints of Grapefruit and citrus, the Nugget, Warrior, and Tomahawk hops make their presence known immediately. This is balanced out with just the slightest hint of malts.

A: Beautiful dark honey color, great clarity and just the slightest bit of visible carbonation. A couple fingers worth of foam head, which leaves lotsa suds and some nice lacing after it disipates.  S: If it was possible to give the nose of a beer higher than a 5, this Troegs would take the cake. I have no doubt that hopheads 'round the world would line up if the brewers offered some sort of Nugget Nectar air freshener. Pine and citrus hop scents (and you can really pick out the nugget, warrior and tomahawk hops from the nose alone) and some slight sweet mals balance each other out.  T: The hoppiness of this beer, alongside a real absence of the biting bitterness you usually find in these hopmonsters, is unreal. Really nice malt smoothness backs up the initial hop taste. Grapefruit, caramel and honey flavors are most prevalent.  M: Nice and creamy, with a perfect amount of carbonation. A nice little bit of stickyness stays in the mouth for a little while.

I really could drink this as a standard and wish it wasnt brewed so infrequently as its hard to find.

So after getting 2 in a six-pack swap last week, it's now time.  APPEARANCE: Pours a light amber/red/gold (what a cool color!). A large white head drops to a thick collar around the glass with plenty of foam still dotting the surface. Lacing is tremendous and covers the entirety of the glass.  SMELL: Strong aromas of pungent, bitter hops. Heavy floral notes along with some citrus. The malt is tough to pick out, but it's there... barely.  TASTE: The taste is remarkably quite heavy in maltiness. Oh, the hops are there. Absolutely. But the balance in this beer is achieved wonderfully. The malt and hops race to your palette, each trying to be the first, but they reach it in a delicious and well-balanced tie. Citrusy hops take a brief but big lead lasting until you're ready to swallow. The malt gets the last laugh however, finishing with a bready sweetness. A multi-dementional beer to say the least.  MOUTHFEEL: Medium bodied and only slightly slick and syrupy. The carbonation is great.  DRINKABILITY: Very drinkable. I was shocked to read 7.5% on the label. Goes down way to easy. Well done Tröegs!  Major props to Tröegs for coming up with basically an all new style, Imperial Amber. The balance that this beer achieves is striking.

S - Hoppy floral and citrus notes, honey, sweet maltiness tucked in the back. I wish this were a bottled fragrance.  T - Bitter and citrus dance on my tongue, honey and malt are along for the ride as well. wow.  M - full, not a watered down aspect of this beer. great carbonation level as well.  D - I wish I had more right now, period.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,DGryger,4.04,"Appearance: Clear reddish tan. Minimal head, almost no lacing.  Smell: Heavy grassy hops with a slight citrus backing. Upon opening the bottle my first thought was that it smelled like a lawnmower. Heavy grass scent eases as the beer warms and becomes more floral.  Taste: Unique. This beer has a very complex multi-layered flavor profile. Taste progresses from a bit of nutty malt to bitter hops, grassy hops and finally citrus hops. As the beer warms pine resins become more noticeable in the flavor profile.  Mouthfeel: About what I would expect from an amber  lightly syrupy body and a good amount of carbonation make this a smooth easy drinker. Dry finish makes you want another sip. Alcohol sweetness helps to balance a little.  Drinkability: I would say that for the style (massively hopped) it is fairly light and easy drinker. But I would have to say that I think a little more malt would help this beer out. While I had this beer solo, I think having it with food would help mellow out a bit of the in-your-face bitterness.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,wcudwight,4.76,Thanks to Enola for picking this one up for me while he was in Bristol. I've had this aged but have never had a fresh one. Pours a crystal clear amber color with some golden hues. Thin sticky head with decent retention and wet sticky lacing. Mmmmm smells like a Christmas tree farm. Mmmm!!!! Taste like a tangerine chased with a pine cone. Lot's of hop goodness. This will blow even the most seasoned hop heads minds. For such a tasty and flavorful beer the body is pretty light. If you love hops you will think about tasting this beer long after it's gone. Warning: Nugget Nectar has been known to cause Hopcolism in labratory animals! I think this and Big Hoppy Monster from Terrapin have taken this style to a whole new and exciting level.,Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Very good a 6er of this would be sufficient for the night!,Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,mikesgroove,4.1,"Poured a bright orange amber with a big billowing white head. Faded quickly leaving a nice layer of swirly, gooey lace on the top. No visible carbonation in the glass, which was crystal clear, no hint of any hazy or cloudiness. Smell was strong bitter hops, pine resin grapefruit, pineapple were the big players here. A very slight tinge of alcohol as it warmed tingled the nose a bit. The taste was a little thin, watery, but not too bad, just would have envisioned a bit fuller based on the smell. Biggest taste here was the grapefruit, big dry piney finish left this very nice. Good well rounded IPA. Overall this is a very good call. Lower ABV makes this very drinkable, and pretty much sessionable for a big time hop head. Very nice beer.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,bigdeuce,4.94,"This brew is ABSOLUTELY PHENOMENAL!!! Pours a nice head and a deep copper color. The nose is sensational, I smelled it before every sip. Leaves tons of lacing down the glass. Is sticky sweet, oily, with massive hops on the back end. Well balanced and dangerously drinkable. Should not be a session beer with the alcohol content, but I cannot stop drinking it. Please Troeg's bros, make this available in Ohio and make it a year round brew, you'd clean up! One of the best beers in the world!!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,nickss,4.45,"Light amber hue with very visible highly active carbonation. Big frothy 2 finger head which disipates ever so slowly. A pretty brew indeed.  Big hop aroma... lemon zest and tangerine... but the malt is certainly noticeable....a wonderful scent... very well balanced.  Subtle at first... then ker-plow... a hop-smack to the palate. Once again, though, the balance is quite nice... the malt bringing up a strong backbone to the hop assault... almost reminds me of a rye-IPA.... quite nice.  Perfect mouthfeel. The carbonation is significantly more subdued than the appearance would have led me to believe. Troeg's lets the hops subdue your tongue as opposed to the efferevescent bubbles. Moderately thick, and wonderful.  Though 7.5% is no longer considered to be a huge beer, it is certainly nothing to scoff at. That said, this beer drinks like a 4% session brew... I could drink this all night without any problem. Immenently quaffable, and thoroughly delicious.... certainly my favorite offering from Troeg's thus far.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,orsulacp,3.97,"The body was clear light amber with a big fluffy white head. The nose was fruity and piney. A real fresh cut pine sent dominated. The taste started bitter, woody and piney, then a little fruity sweetness in the middle some bready malts, and then a woody bitterness to end it. The mouthfeel seemed a little on the light side, the carbonation was really active. Very high drinkability for a 7.5%abv beer. I liked last years version slightly better, but this is still a great beer.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,klewis,3.7,"Thanks to markgugs for this one.  A: Pours a clear amber with a one-finger foamy head that subsides to a frothy ring around the glass. A bit of lacing.  S: Complex hop nose with citrus and floral notes.  T: A hint of maltiness teases you up front before it hits you over the head with hop bitterness. Not nearly as complex as the bouquet.  M: Medium-full bodied with fine carbonation and a nice sticky quality.  D: A nice beer, but this one falls a bit short of the hype for me. A bit more hop flavor (as opposed to bitterness) would make this one better for me.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Matteox3,4.52,"Purchased at Beer Mart, Route 10, Reading, PA. Good availability there if looking for it.  Hop, Hop, and more Hop flavor. However, unlike many IPA's, the hoppiness of this brew (although very very hoppy) blends well with the overall fruitiness of the beer. In my experience with sharing this beer with others who do not like hoppy beers, those people really enjoyed this brew.  The hop flavor is piney in nature. The color is a very appealing amber, with healthy (not foamy) head.  More complex in taste than an IPA. Very fruity. Hop flavor works with the flavor, and is not a separate flavor.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,ClockworkOrange,4.2,"Poured from a 12oz. bottle into my shaker pint glass. Appears a clear amber color with a finger of off white foam.

694,15881,vwcraig,4.3,"One finger high head to start with from proper pour that fades to a thin cap and some bubbles. Perfectly clear and a deep amber color. Great first smells of fruity hops and sweet, juicy malt. Smells are close to a certain Bell's product. First taste was a quick resiny hop bite followed by a finish that was crisper than I had anticipated. Big hop tastes but not abusive. Medium bodied and very smooth. Dangerously easy to drink and hard to put down. Carbonation is on lower side but it still works. Great bargain for the price, too if you have access to this very fine offering from the Brothers Troegs.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,flexabull,4.33,"Another great bottle courtesy of MuenchenerKindl  Pours a bright amber color, carbonation is visible, and a nice white head settled on top.  Aroma is quite citrus like. Very fruity smelling, and a bit sweet.  Taste is at first fruity, sweet and creamy. Beer then settles into hop flavors, I really notice a bitter hop zing on the finish. The flavors are quite crisp, and long lasting.  Mouthfeel is nice. Carbonation is well done.  Drinkability is up there on this one. It's a very flavorful and well balanced IPA/Amber Ale. But it's not overpowering at all. I could easily drink more than one of these. Good stuff!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Taste is magical, a delicious amalgamation of thick caramel malts, biscut, sweet and slick and almost thick, the hops are strong, citric, pine, floral, everything good that can be said about a nice sweet, malty, hoppy beer can be said of this one.

694,15881,InsolublePancake,4.37,"A- Clear orange-tinted gold with about an inch of white head.  S- Huge hop aroma, and I do mean huge. Piney as all hell, with some orange-like citrus. Malt is nonexistent in the nose.  T- Surprisingly mild. The citrus hop flavors blend perfectly with the sweet, bready malt. Supreme balance. Bitterness is very low for a 90+ IBU beer. It's there, no doubt, but it's by no means overwhelming. The overall taste reminds me a little of Bell's Two Hearted. I almost wanted a little more oomph from the taste, but I certainly can't complain.  M- Good, nice and smooth, not too much carbonation, but other than that nothing to write home about.  D- Very good. ABV is a little high, but you'd never know it from the taste. The fantastic balance in the taste gives this beer an equally fantastic drinkability.  Not what I was expecting, but very good nonetheless. I thought I was getting a hop monster, but instead I got a well-balanced, wonderfully drinkable beer. Good stuff.

The grapefruit and citrus fruits then appear dissipating any hoppy bitterness.  Mouthfeel - Medium bodied with good carbonation throughout. Aftertaste leaves hops but with little to no bitterness.  Drinkability - Delicious! I need more.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,HossMcGraw,3.93,"Been wanting to try this one for a while. I nearly had to grab a change of underwear when I saw this at my local packie. A damn fine brew, but I guess I built it up too much in my mind. Set the bar a bit too high. That being said, this is just as good as many of its west coast contemporaries, and I'm fortunate to have it produced so close to me.  Pours a lovely orange/amber, with a finger or two of head, and decent lacing. Aroma is a letdown. It's just too faint. I can pick up some grapefruit, strawberry, a large steely character, and the ubiquitous cat urine that seems to make its way into so many IPAs. Not bad, just faint.  The flavor is better. A bit sweeter than I prefer, but retains a good bit of hop flavor. Not bitter, just lots of hop *flavor. More strawberry, grapefruit, and cherry flavor, with a nice hoppy, dry aftertaste that makes you want to reach for another sip.  Mouthfeel is thin and uncarbonated. Needs a bit more pop to it if you ask me. Drinkability is superb. I've had better IPAs, but few this drinkable. The 7.5% is barely noticeable, and the dry finish helps make this a certified session brew. Troegs rarely dissapoint, and this is another winner. A fine example of central PA craftsmanship.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Freshie,4.22,"Nice bottle, with good artwork. IBU count, with types of hops used on the label, as well as the ABV. No freshness date.  Honey color, with slight head. Lack of head probably due to the frigid temperature of my garage. I let the ale warm for 15 minutes for experiencing.  Smell is floral/fruity hops.  The taste is hoppy. Grassy hops that are usually found in an American IPA, are complimented by a toasty, mildly sweet malt falvour.  Hops are spicy in the mouth, and the ale finishes very clean.  Has a very flavourful bite, that doesn't linger on the palate.  My first review from this brewery and I am impressed.  Cheers!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

694,15881,jdg204,4.92,"After hearing all the praise for this PA brew, I had to give it a shot once I saw it at one of my local brew shops and it was awesome!!  Appearance - It's almost as if the organge color is glowing, it's that bright. This was something to see.  Smell - The citrusy (particularly orange) smells mixed with the spices was fantastic. This was off the hook!  Taste - Ok, this was even better than the smell! The richness of the different types of hops mixed with the orange flavor was superb. The hop combination provided for a great rich start and a nice subtle bitter undertone to finish.  Mouthfeel - Really nice consistent texture, the fullness of the flavor really pleases the mouth.  Drinkability - I flat out loved this beer, I've been quickly consuming my 6 pack in the days since I bought it. This is definetly a classic in the making, really enjoyed this hybrid of an Amber Ale and IPA, this would make a great everyday or special occasion beer.

Not a barrage of hops, but a good hop presence in the nose. Taste is bittery hops. Some nice, juicy, citrusy hops. Not overly bitter or tongue thrashing. This is a very toned down Dreadnaught. It's quite good, but just isn't the powerhouse that I was expecting. The mouthfeel is crisp and medium bodied. This does come across as something that would be highly sessionable.

694,15881,foureyedgeek,4.7,"My 100th review and a beer I've been waiting to try for a year, a perfect combination!  12oz bottle, the case dated best by 6/12/07. Pours a crystal clear orange amber, with light rising carbonation and a fluffy white head of foam, tall and airy. Nice lacing and good head retention as well.  Ooof, the nose is bursting with hops. Fresh and floral, citrusy and juicy. Just a touch of sweetness as well and a whiff of alcohol.  Taste is a sweet and citrusy burst of hops, this is one beer that can easily be described as juicy. There's some maltiness there, the amber part of this imperial amber, a nice subtle wash of malt before the bitterness returns in the swallow. Just delicious.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and a nice combination of the sticky hops and the juicy hops, bringing the best of both attributes together. The carbonation level and dry finish make this a very clean and refreshing beer. Only the slightest alcohol warming.  Drinkability is great, this would be a heck of a session beer if you didn't have anything to do the next day or so.

Followed by hints of grapefruit and ocean or salt water.  Upfront flavors of grapefruit rind and pine resins. Followed by a slightly sweet malt presence. Smoky notes toward the end with some hints of alcohol.  The mouthfeel is slick with hop oils. You can feel a definite coating with the first sip. Little to no bite from the carbonation.

Pine and floral notes also come through.  The taste is very citrusy. Sweet, almost honeyish dough balances out the bitterness, with the hops staying well ahead of the noticeable malt. Pine and floral notes interact well, giving the hop profile a wonderful complexity. This is an amazingly hoppy beer with just enough sweet malt to give it a nice depth and complexity.

The head retains well and sticky lacings line the wall of my glass throughout.  Excellent balance of big, citrus, pine hops in the nose along with a big malt character. Sweet caramel, molasses and vanilla become increasingly apparent as this warms to room temp.  Sweet malt tastes balance smoothly with pink grapefruit, citrus rind, bitter hops and an explosion of pine forest bliss. The hops are fantastic in this beer, highly potent without being insanely over-the-top. Not that too much is bad, as I've had this brew dry hopped and it was also amazing! The hop flavors are so fresh that I can envision myself biting into a hop cone, absolutely amazing! The malt character reappears in the finish, along with some caramel flavors but the hop flavors remain throughout. The finish is bitter, smooth and crisp.  I did find this to be slightly too carbonated but not enough to hinder the drinkability to greatly. The smooth, balanced flavors render this brew highly sessionable.

S - Grapefruity hops hitting you right off the bat. Some pine sticks through there as well. Loads of hop aroma, as always with this brew.  T - Big piny hops up front with a kick of fruitiness.

A nice lacing formed on the walls of the glass. Fantastic looking beer!  Interesting smell here. Very piney, with a backbone of honey and soft tea like notes.  Once sipped, my mouth was full of that pine hop scent I detected earlier. It's not overbearing though, as there is a strong malty background to back up such a hopped up brew. The hoppy flavors are very piney, and the malty flavors are rather honeylike and smooth.  Soft, thin mouthfeel here. It wasn't too thin, though, but just the right viscosity for this beer. I'll give this a five in this catagory.  I can't reccomend a session of this, simply because of the ABV being so high, but it is good enough to warrant a 2nd pint.  Such a wonderful brew by Troegs.

A good froth on the palate sweetens this up real nice. Listed as an Imperial Amber on the bottle, this is tasting and feeling like some killer IPA's with just the right touch of sweetness.

694,15881,JohnnyM2002,4.57,"Sampled at the brewery, poured into several tasting glasses. Freshly tapped this week - was sure to bring home a case!  A - Pours an orangish copper with an off-white head; good retention with a thick, sticky lace that followed the beer down the glass.  S - Powerful, complex aroma built on top of the hoppy goodness. Tangy fruit and sweet malt are both very strong and work very nicely with the spiced hops. Very inviting.  T - My tastebuds really got a workout today. Juicy hops come rushing out right away, but there's no super-bitterness. Instead, they're met with tea leaves, honey, and a plethora of fruits, until finally a malty-caramel kicks in. The end result? A very hoppy beer that doesn't rip the tastebuds right off your tongue with bitterness...wonderful flavor combinations.  M - Medium body with good carbonation...flavors are much more pronounced as the beer warmed. A very tasty aftertaste of sweet and tangy hops. Only a slight alcohol presence...it would be tough to cram any extra flavors in there!  D - It's been a long wait for this one, but now I've stocked my closet for the winter. This is one I can't wait to share with those less fortunate (i.e. the other 45 states that doesn't get Troegs!). I'd love to see more Imperial Ambers out there.  I'd normally expected a higher ABV than 7.5%, but this makes it much easier to drink. Excellent!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Mine didn't produce much of a head even with a semi-vigorous pour, but the little that was there was off-white. There was a modest bit of lacing as this was consumed.  The smell is something wonderful, full of citrusy hops and a bit floral. I couldn't wait to take the first sip.  No letdown from the smell in the taste department. Full of very citrusy hops, and if I had to guess I would think there was a fair bit of amarillo hops in there. Awesome! Bit of malt and a nice well rounded bitterness from the hops.

Mildly spicy, but not in the traditional German Tettnanger/Hallertauer peppery spicy. More of a pungent American hop spiciness, with an indication of a strong bitterness ahead.  Remarkable balance in taste. Biscuity toasted malts (most likely from Vienna or Munich malts) which lends the perfect amount of caramel flavor for a VERY aggressively hoppy beer. Perfect balance of bitterness and sweetness throughout every quaff.  Mouthfeel - moderately carbonated, but smooth as silk.  Drinkability - is this beer really 7.5% ABV? I damn near finished my glass in less than 2 minutes. An outstanding session ale, I feel deprived not having this beer on tap at my local bar.

Pours a slightly cloudly orange/golden color, nice carbonation, small foamy white head that dissappears quickly, not much lacing afterwards. Scents of hops, sweet malts, some citrus, and slight caramel. The taste is nice and hoppy with a sweetness thrown in, slight citrus/caramel hoppy finish. Medium body, nice balance.

Recieved in a trade from....i forgot who, but whoever it is thanks.  Pours dark red with orange hues around the edges. Beautiful color. Decent head appeared with small amount of lacing sticking to the glass.  Smell is very nice. Juicy hops with sweet malt. Smells like a nice west coast DIPA to be honest. Nothing too complex but way above where the style typically goes.  Taste is very good. Juicy citrus hops are bittering up front then the malt profile gives this beer a great balance. They didn't hold back on the hops in this one but while most Reds typically have a numbing-of-the-palate type of bitterness, the hop profile here is juicy and sweet creating a mouth-watering effect on the flavor that is excellent.  Mouthfeel is great. Carbonation is almost perfect.  Drinkability is also great. I could kill a sixer of this stuff easily.  Overall: Very impressive. I wish they distributed this in San Diego. This is the only Imperial Red/Amber i've tasted that can compaire to the Winter Yulesmith.  Highly recommended.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,mmmbeer,4.67,"Found the six-pack in June and almost shit myself as I knew that up until then it was a draft-only release. Naturally, I had to buy it because not only is Tröegs one of my favorite breweries, but I am also a hophead, so this was a real find. Four bottles later I've finally done a full review: 12 oz. bottle with no freshness date and a declaration of ""93ish IBUs."" It pours an unfiltered red/copper with a half-inch ecru head and low carbonation. The aroma consists of fairly strong piney/citric (orange) hops that have a minty or herbal element. On the palate it is almost syrupy, drying, and lightly numbing, with low to medium carbonation, starting with strong pine/citric hops, notes of orange, apricot?, and pear, well balanced by sugary, biscuity, caramelly, and toasty malts that tame the hops, seemingly reclaiming some of their IBUs. As it warms I find notes of coffee and the bouquet becomes more pronounced. The finish is nice and lingering, making me not want to eat or drink anything that would erase any last traces of this wonderful brew. I wonder if anyone else will try an ""imperial amber ale,"" or, for that matter, if they could make it as tasty. I doubt it.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

A: The beer is a light amber color with a thin off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.  S: Healthy hops aroma blended nicely with some good malt and citrus sweetness as a compliment.  T: Just like with the smell, the taste is extremely well-balanced with hops bitterness and citrus sweetness. Both flavors remain in harmony the whole time you drink this beer. Even the after-taste maintains the balance between the two.  M: Very crisp and very smooth, medium body, medium-to-high carbonation, very clean finish.

694,15881,orfeu,4.82,"Many, many thanks to hoppymeal for this excellent surprise he included in our recent trade! Pours a slightly hazy dusky orange into my nonic; a densely-packed just-off-white head sits on top. Magnificent citrus aromas: Satsuma pith and grapefruit rind scents predominate. A sweet smell lurks beneath, caramelly I think, but for the most part inscrutable. Fantastic bitterness with the hop profile: the main flavors I pick up are citrus (grapefruit and bergamot), but there is also a killer earthy mineral flavor which emerges after the initial citric flavors burst forth -- this is unlike any other bitter flavor I've experienced. Medium-light body, juicy and refreshingly dry mouthfeel -- just what I was wanting tonight. I've been growing pretty tired of thick syrupy IPAs lately -- Nugget Nectar is not at all of that ilk and truly hits the spot. I'd like to pick up a case of this next time I'm in PA this coming winter. Excellent beer; highly recommended.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,ColoradoBobs,3.62,"12-ounce bottle courtesy of bitterbill.  Pour is a hazy intense deep orange-amber under a thick off-white one-finger head. Pretty. I LOVE cloudy beers -- the cloudiness seems to foretell a depth of flavor. Am I right in this case?  Smell is intense. Grass, hay, spicey clove, some citrus. Really nice aroma, like a Hefe-weizen on steroids.  Taste is intensely hoppy. Pine hops. Citrus hops. Bitter hops. However, there's a solid malt foundation here that evens everything out. There is a huge load of Nugget, Warrior and Tomahawk hops, to be sure, but there's also some interesting balance. I'm not sure I'm crazy about it, but it's interesting. Long bitter finish, but not dry-bitter. More like orange-flavored bitter with some peppery spice.  Mouthfeel is very refreshing, almost cleansing.  Drinkability? Well, I don't know whether to give it a 5 because of the cleansing, refreshing feeling or a 2 due to the long bitter finish: so, I compromised with a 3.5.  As a malt lover, I admit to being statistically outside the first standard deviation on this one.

S - Delicious juicy hops. Pine, citrus, and grapefruit. Some grassiness mixed in. This would make a tasty IPA aroma.  T - Piney, citrus, grapefruit, earthy hops. There is a slight sweet malt background but the hops truly take over on this one. There is a weird after taste that I can't place. Dirty earthiness?, metallic?, I just can't tell but it is just enough to ruin the delicious hop flavor.  M - Coats the mouth nicely without being syrupy. A little on the high end for carbonation. Very dry finish.  D - This one really baffles me. I have never tasted a beer that was so pleasant but left such a weird taste in my mouth. I waited until I tried all 8 I had over several months and I still can't put my finger on this one. This beer is my Jeckyl and Hyde.

The taste is big on hops up front...the citrus in the smell is there but it's not super bitter as I expected and wait, the malt shows up mid way through with some caramel sweetness and it does a good job of balancing out the overall flavour. Nice. Very nice indeed.  The finish just reiterates the balance in flavours that I mentioned and makes for a pretty darned delectable aftertaste. Wow. This is a goody!

Nose is of citrus, pine, and fruits, co-mingled with a nutty malt background. Palate is so well-rounded, and not like a typical amber. Hops are assertive throughout, and the sweet malt character keeps it balanced. The relatively high ABV is very well masked. Delicious. Mouthfeel is medium and very creamy. Good hoppy bitterness keeps it honest. This is a user-friendly beer that doesn't shrink back from using strong hop flavors. This beer is both biting and smooth.

I have heard so much about this and seen it discussed so much in the forums, I had to have it. But anyhow, back to the beer. The one thing I like most about this style, and this one in particular, is the smell. That grapefruit / pine resin smell. I have to be in the mood for it, but when I fancy this style, nothing else will do. This offering from Tröegs is quite possibly the most fantastic display of the grapefruit / pine resin smell I have experienced to date. In fact, it almost smells like sweetened grapefruit juice with a bit of pine sap in the background, as well as a touch of malt. The taste is more of the same. Again, this isn't really my style, but given what this is, it's absolutely fantastic!! The mouthfeel is wonderful, for the style, with a perfect amount of carbonation.

694,15881,DaPeculierDane,4.12,"Once upon a time there was a jolly BA named AutumnalDave who drove around the upper Midwest handing out phenomenal beers to people he hardly knew. That is how this review began  Preamble: I have a bias against this beer because of how its categorized. I think its insane to put this hop bomb in the same category as Leinies Red, Bells Amber, and Fat Tire. That being said, this is a pretty awesome hop monster.  Appearance: Orange copper body that goldens as if touched by Midas himself when held to direct light. Nice fizzy off white head, pour retention, minimal lacing.  Aroma: Very sweet hops  like somebody took a variety of fresh hops, stringed them up, and dipped them in orange snow cone syrup and a touch of honey. The hop profile is as broad as the tidal wave that swept Madison in a freak flood yesterday. Juniper, mountain flowers, sage, grapefruit, tangerine, etc are all present and accounted for. Despite this, caramel remains nicely available in the nose.  Taste: Hoppy to be sure and bitter like ruby red grapefruit but much of the bitterness is balanced by a strong presence of candy like sweet malts so that the final flavor comes out more like a piece of chewy, sugar coated Sunkist grapefruit candy than that half a grapefruit that I often see hippies eating in the mornings. Other hop flavors of lawn clippings, apricot, and tangerines are as bold as that last sentence was run-on and yet caramel and even a little pastry dough still find a place.  Mouthfeel: Nearly a full body, creamy yet bitter, rich and smooth. No alcohol presence.  Drinkability goes without saying.  Postscript: Im still bitter that this beer is listed as an Amber/Red. Personally, I think its closer to an American IPA but at the end of the day who cares. This beer rocks.

At first with this beer, I didn't detect much in the smell, other then the fact that it was very clean. As i let it warm up though, I noticed that the aroma was chocked full of hoppy resins and oils, giving it a zesty, spicy character. My anticipation that this would be a damn hoppy beer was fulfilled the second the glass tocuhed my lips...this is one hoppy red ale. At first I thought that it was much more IPA like then anything else, but in the end I see the red ale traits. Mouthfeel was medium bodied.

Tiny bubbles are everywhere and you can really feel them. The smell in the glass is like orange juice or maybe even cotton candy. It's sweet from start to finish.  I probably wouldn't label this as an amber at first glance. The citrus taste and the hoppiness would fool me into calling it an American pale ale. But names aside... it is truly tasty.

Upon drinking the initial sweet malt quickly explodes into a citrus and peppery hop flavor which leaves a nice biterness in the aftertaste. It is a bit weak on the malt end though, it just needs stroger malt characteristics. I realize that this is intended to be a hoppy beer, but it can still be acheived with a aggresive malt complexity.

The beer pours a bright clear tangerine color with fluffy off white head of 2 cm foaming up easily and creating large craters as the bubbles recede. Hop aroma is immediately evident. I get a clean mix of grass clippings, pine sap, and rindy grapefruit. There is just a bit of caramel and sweet fruit underneath. First sip reveals thinner body than expected but smooth silky almost creamy texture and VERY fine carbonation that foams up immensely when swished in my mouth. The flavor is briefly caramel and some orange citrusy sweet and then rolls to all hops. The beer has pine sap, and rindy grapefruit hits before it rolls to a drying astringent bitter finish. The finish leaves an aspirin flavored coating on my tongue which encourages me to take another sip. The 7.5% is hidden I think mostly by the hoppiness of the beer.

694,15881,dhchatfield,4.43,"Yet another from BitterBrians ""megaton hop bomb"" trade. Thanks  Chilled for about 10 minutes.  A- Really nice reddish gold. Crystal clear.  S- Hops Hops and more Hops. Actually smells bitter. Definately some apricot as well. Mango?  T- Yummm, this is good stuff. Runs from sweet at the start to bitter and then back some.  M- Very active across the palate. Bitter in the middle but a broad malty finish. Well balanced for sure.  D- Very drinkable. I If had more than this single bottle, I'd run with this one all day.  A very pleasant first beer of the day for Father's Day (I waited until 12:07). My tastes run to DIPA's but this is an eye-opener with regard to alternative styles. I love discovering new genre's.  Give me a case of this!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,deejaydan,4.37,"Thanks to Imstillthegman for the sample during BIF 33.  Pours a lighter amber color, brilliantly clear. Head is fluffy at first, moderate lacing, and the head subsides quickly. Aroma is piney/citrus hops. Clean, a slight hint of toasted malt in there as well. Taste is a hint of malt then a hop explosion! Alcohol is hidden in taste, but a slight burning as it goes down. Mouthfeel is very nice, clean carbonation, and just rich enough. Drinkablity is very high to me, very nicely balanced.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,nflmvp,4,Pours a cloudy copper/orange with minimal head.  Smell is citrusy/nutty with little hint of the alcohol content.  Taste is citrusy with a pine backrground and not much alcohol bite.  Mouthfeel is full but not too heavy...almost creamy.  Drinkability is NICE. I very much enjoy this...considering that I'm not a big fan of hoppy beers I find it very enjoyable.,Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,TastyTaste,4.27,"I expect a lot from this beer, being in the same style, but rated higher than Santa's Private Reserve, Surly Furious, and Red Rocket Ale (some of my favorite ales, and my benchmarks of the style). Thanks to AKSmokedPorter for the sample. Cool 12 oz. bottle of a tat'd fist squeezing hop juice out of a hop nugget like it was trying to steal it's lifeforce.  Appearance: Copper-red body, small head rises and fades quickly leaving a skin of white foam. Fairly clear, maybe a little haze.  Smell: Initial too cold, but you can still get the hop profile from this one. Fresh, resinous, sticky hops, very herbal and reminiscent of cannabis. Not as strong as the others in the field, but has a full and deep smell that has many shades of hop aroma.  Taste: A sessionable but not overpowering amber ale. Carmel sweetness is there along with some biscuit maltiness, the hops steal the show, bitter, medicinal and sharp. Very good.  Drinability: While a good amber ale this is, the best of the style this ain't. Still, I will enjoy finishing this beer, and appreciate the ode to hops that is this beer.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,MeLikeBeer,4.25,"Tasting this one courtesy of warriorsoul, a big thanks indeed!  Pours a yellow/caramel color, with light carbonation and a frothy white head, indeed.  Smells like sweet citrus and caramel. A tender hop aroma pervades as well.  Toffee(?) and pine race across my tongue. Very nice. The bitterness I was expecting when I first breathed this beer quickly succumbs to it's citrus (grapefruit, O.J.) sweetness. Quite a nice surprise! Great malt flavors give some weight to this hoppy brew.  The flavors are sticky-sweet and linger on the palate for quite awhile after each sip. Delicious. This is one enjoyable drink. If I had regular access, I 'd probably be in heaven.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,dfiliaggi,5,"Do not take this as exageration, but in my opinion, THIS IS THE BEST BEER IN THE WORLD!!! No doubt about it.  Strawberry/orange in color. Perfect tecture in your mouth. I know some people that don't even really like hoppy beers but loved it anyway. It is the perfect balance of an ultra-hoppy beer and one with a malty sweetness. I know some of the people that work at Troegs and I keep urging them to brew this all year-round. I bought two cases and hoarded them for as long as could. They didn't last because I couldn't help myself. Next February, do yourself a favor and buy as much of it as you can!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,idlepress,4.97,"This brew is absolutely delicious! It was recommended over a message board I post on so I had to try it. One problem, I lived in California. One solution. Move back to Pennsylvania! Okay that wasn't the reason I moved back but you can be assured it was on my mind the entire ride.  I headed on up to this place I like to call ""Beer Heaven"", as they have tons of great brews in this distributer. Purchased a case and went home and took out 12 bottles to let it cool in the fridge.  Great label on this brew. Nice tangy smell. Nice color judging from the bottle. I busted one out while eating dinner with my parents. My mom asked about it so I gave her a taste. The expression on her face was pure disgust. I laughed and continued to drink it with pride and joy. Absolutely one of the tastiest brews I've had. Nice hoppy flavor. HEADY, even! Very easy to drink for me. I'm really into Ales and the hop taste. I have a feeling I can down these quickly. The first one was gone in a matter of minutes. I know I know I need to enjoy these fine creations in life. I was anxious to try it, though.

Your nose is greeted with an assertive bitterness supported by yummy floral hop and fruity sweet malt.  Malts know their place in this brew... THE HELL OUT OF THE WAY! There is just enough toasty-sweet malt t let you know it's there, but the hops lead the way with a smooth and assertive bitterness and loads of herbal hop flavor. Really spectacular hoppy brew!  Moderately heavy body is slightly slick, just carbonated enough to be very pleasant.  This is one awesome brew! This bottle (one of four acquired from Artusory, thanks!) lasted all of about 20 minutes.

Quaff also noted above, and also a floral kick (which, unfortunately for me, is not one of my favorite flavors). Something about the floral hops that doesnt come across for me.  A medium bodied brew, somewhat surprised at the lack of an oily slickness in this one. And I sure dont know why BA has it down as an amber ale. Geez, this one is IPA/DIPA all the way.  Another great sample provided by beerbeing.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,gestyr,4.72,"WOW! Good stuff. From the first sniff when openening the bottle, you could discern different kinds of hops. The head was a nice tan with tightly packed bubbles and lasted almost to the bottom of the glass, leaving lacing all along the sides. The color is a clear bright orange.

Taste: Tingly, and hoppy combined with a nice maltiness  Mouthfeel: Makes you pucker (in a good way), hops stay on the back of the tongue leaving a nice impression.  drinkability: Love the hoppiness - but this 7.5% could get you in trouble as the alcohol isn't prominent.  NOTE: Also had this on cask at the Standard Tap in Philadelphia - amazing.  Another nice job by Troegs!  Cheers!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

The beer poured a nice golden amber color, with an inch and a half head. The head didn't last long but left a nice lace. The aroma was fresh and you could drink in the hops just through your nose. Tasted great. Not too hoppy (although I'm not sure what an ""Imperial Amber,"" as the label suggests, is supposed to taste like), but defintely fresh and clean. Hits the front like a nice amber ale, and finishes strong like an IPA. This is a highly drinkable beer from Troegs and I would try it again (and again?) should I stumble upon it here in the District.

The malts are also present in the scent. Smells real good  Taste: tastes as good as it smells. Sweet malts you'd expect from an amber beer and a larger than normal hop kick. Works well  Mouthfeel: somewhat thick and crunchy  drinkability: good but the hops and high alcohol could keep you from drinking more than a few,Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

The taste is nothing short of fantastic. Sweet, hoppy nectar. Floral and piney hops, with grapefruit and great malty balance. Nectar is a fitting name, cause this one tastes like hop juice straight from the cone. Smooth as they come. Rediculous drinkability. Ive been saving this one for when I was in a hoppy mood, and this one satisfies my hop craving quickly. If I could get this one locally, it would be a staple in my fridge.  Great beer.

694,15881,edskirk3,3.97,"I got a few of these in a trade with my brother. The words 'imperial amber' underscore the main title on the label.  It indeed pours straight amber; a smooth, syrupy pour. Thin, creamy looking off white head meniscussing (yeah, I know, not a real word) on the edge of the glass.  Scent is largely grapefruity, which confirms that there were lots of Nuggets used in the making of this ale. American Nuggets. The neck label mentions Nugget, Warrior, and Tomahawk hops.  And, yeah, the bitterness is there, but it does not obscure the malts, so the balance is pretty good. Until afterwards, when hop bitterness lingers.  Nugget Nectar has a little bit of body to it, and is lightly carbonated. I can't really pick up any alcohol taste or odor.

Head is one finger, off white, and falls at a decent rate.  Aroma is of hops, mixed with orange and papaya. Nice spiciness on the nose. Some malt undertone here, as well.  Nice hop bitterness right up top. Unfortunately, there's a slightly wet towel hint here. Nice maltiness follows with an orange overtone, of course tempered by the hops. Not bad.  A little high on the carbonation for me. It kind of detracts just a bit from the liquid, which is hearty but not thick.

Bottle inspection: States that it's an imperial amber brewed with Nugget, Warrior, and Tomahawk hops. 93-ish IBU's. cool.  Aroma: Orange juice, lemon peel, citrus all over the place! Great aromatics. Very inviting.  Appearance: Cloudy burnt orange with a creamy, bubbly white cap.  Flavor: Bitter orange peel up front, orange juice sweetness in the middle, bittering and slightly dry alcohol finish. This is all about the hops. Very citrus-laden but enjoyable.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, a touch oily, and lively carbonation. Keeps popping on the palate!  Overall impression: A bit of a one-trick pony but very well done. A hop head's delight! Simply a ""must try"" if you like hops.

Head is thin with poor retention, although carbonation appears strong. The aroma is only mildly potent, smelling much like piney/citrus hops and light sugary malt. Light citrus hops dominate the taste at first, then allowing some degree of bready malt flavor to peek through. A small dose of bitterness lingers, as well as a nutty flavor in the finish. Some character is reminiscent of an Amber Ale, but it more like an American IPA. Medium-thick, with a minor creamy mouthfeel, the carbonation lightly pierces the front of the tongue.

694,15881,Calico,3.21,"Thanks to BuckeyeNation for providing me with this beer.  Poured from a 12-oz. bottle into a tulip glass.  Good clarity. Pretty amber color.  Aroma: heavy on the hops. A little catty, gasoliny.  Taste: Quite interesting, a style I can't quite place (what is an imperial amber anyway?) but a little too sharp, estery, and grassy to be well rounded. Not enough malt. A strong ale, highly hopped.  Reminds me of Middle Ages Wailing Wench.

Smells sweet with a very pronounced grapefruit and floral hoppiness. Reminds me of my favorite IPAs. This is an Amber? Could have fooled me. About the IPA classification, my mouth agrees with my nose. At first, citris hops dominate, but then it moves to a sweet, toasted malty flavor that I couldn't pick up on the scent. Finishes exceptionally balanced between the hops and malts. Mouthfeel is so smooth that I'm going to give it a 5.0. I'd give it an 11 if they let me. Great, smooth, medium mouth that doesn't allow me to put the bottle down for more than a few seconds. Drinkability is very nice as well.

T: Piney and grassy hop blast hits your taste buds first followed by a mixture of bready malts and citrus fruit. Bitter aftertaste is very nice with a lemony/grapefruit injection to remind you of the initial taste. M & D: Smooth drinking ale. Slightly oily at the roof of the mouth and a bit tingly on the sides of the tongue. Good level of carbonation doesn't take away from the hop blast.

694,15881,trumick,4.69,"Thanks to meathookjones for this one. Another very good choice included by him as just a nice gesture in a trade.  Pours a crystal clear amber color with a huge dense head that places a thick lace all around the snifter.  Scent is of huge, piney, grassy hops. Burried deep in there is carmel malts as well. Very nice, the scent just makes my mouth water.  Taste is carmel malts, wonderful fruits-apricots, pineapples and grapes. I love complex hop flavors, this is a prime example of that taste. The hops are there throughout piney, grassy and just a bit of citrus all at the same time. The pine ends the whole experience however. Yes, as I burp it's all hops. Very nice.  Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied with light carbination which is perfect for this beer. It is very smooth and drinkable, refreshing.  Drinkability is exceptional. Combined with the hops, the smooth and refreshing mouthfeel this beer could almost be a session beer. However, the abv would kick my ass after just a few.

Characteristic citrus peel. Also some tropical fruit aromas (pineapple) float around in the nose. Any malt notes in the aroma are initially subdued by the outstanding juicy hops. Some malt is apparent about half-way through the glass as the beer warms.  T - I was expecting the flavor to be a little out of balance from what I got out of the nose. Not at all. This beer has a very nice malty presence in the flavor. Caramel. Bready. A mild earthiness. All wrapped up with an awesome hop bite in the middle and a great bitter finish.  M - Medium to full bodied mouthfeel. Slick, oily. Low to medium carbonation.  D - Drinkable to the extreme. Great balance for an ""Imperial"" anything.

694,15881,lou91,4.36,Whats so surprising about this beer is how average it looks  crystal clear amber with very little head. The first star here is the nose  a hop soup of various hops all in wonderful balance. The taste is just as great in its hoppy goodness and drinkability but a bit thin on the body. This is a great tasting IPA despite calling this an amber. This is a must try for hop heads with unique flavors of grapefruit and wet crackers on the palate which last a long time once you take a sip. Wonderful.,Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,JMD71,4.42,"Appearance: Pours a deep gold, light orangey color. Light penetrates all the way through the pint. Slight head which dissipated quickly. Average carbonation.  Aroma: Tons of hops in the aroma! Wonderful! Smells Delicious. Fruity, citrusy smell also dominant.  Taste: Wonderful hoppy flavor, but not bitter whatsoever. Very smooth & refreshing. Hoppy finish awesome. I love how its very hoppy without being overly bitter.  Mouthfeel: Crisp & clean. Light to medium bodied. Carbonation & light body leaves mouth clean & fresh.  Drinkability: Highly drinkable! Wonderfully clean, easy drinking beer. I could drink multiple of these in a sitting.  Comments: I loved this beer!! Really tasty & well crafted.

694,15881,WaffleSauce,4.07,"Many thanks to Px2Grafx for this bottle.  12oz brown bottle, I really dig the graphics on this one. 7.5 abv, and imperial amber, eh? Cant say Ive ever had one. If theres a date or bottle code on here, I dont see it. Quite frankly Im a bit too eager to drink the bastard to look very hard, though.  Nose is standard amber, with a noticeable hop kick. Sweet overtones to boot.  Pouring in to my trusty Arrogant Bastard pint glass. Not as opaque as I had expect, looks like a decent IPA. A very clear burnt orange with just a hint of amber. ¼ inch head faded quickly (I did have to fish a speck of something out of the head with my finger, which I imagine aided in its speedy demise). Not a whole lot of bubbles coming from the bottom of the glass, but theyre definitely there. Not a whole lot of lacing action, but there is some.  Pretty tasty. Very IPA inspired, in my humble opinion. The amber is almost an afterthought. Very well balanced, not as complex as I had anticipated. A slight caramelly flavor rushes into a burst of very piney hops, with just a slight hint of fruity sweetness at the end. This all passes very quickly, with the hop taste being the predominate flavor. Its quite tasty, just not very complex. This leaves it very drinkable, however, and the mouth feel is very passive, but pleasing.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,TheDeuce,4.4,"My turn to finally have a crack at this thing...  Pours solidly into the glass, big huge bubbles abound in the carbonation and I am ready to go, smell is of major hop kickback, alcohol and malt. Taste is brutally hoppy, stretching me to the limit, I love hops but this came close to overkill for even me, still damn tasty though and goes down well for a big beer. Be careful with this one, four or five of these quick and you'll be in trouble.  Final rating- I love it, like all of Troegs' beers but it lacks the perfection of balance of Hopback or Sunshine Pils in their regions, that said, it is a ramped up IPA that competes EASILY with the best IPAs you can find, bar-none. So congrats to Troegs.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,doubleipa,4.82,"This should be re-classified, as this is not an Amber Ale. The related Hopback yes, the nectar, no. Wow. My wife brought some back from her recent trip to PA. This could replace Terrapin Rye as our daily beer. The aroma was something else. Very, very hoppy, but also with a different, more mellow, not so resin-based smell.

Juicy citrus flavors - loads of grapefruit. The label does it well - hop juice!  The mouthfeel is decent, but just a bit thin.

Very good beer.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,jhollick,3.87,"Presentation - 12 oz. bottle, served chilled.  Appearance - Poured a burned orange color with little head. Lacing clings and clings...and clings.  Smell - Flowers and a strong hop aroma tickle my nose. The malts and caramel add some sweetness. I can't detect any alcohol smell, which worries me :)  Mouthfeel - Less carbonated than I would have expected. The hops cling to my mouth and provide a noticable tingle. Overall mouthfeel is a bit on the light side, but not too watery.  Taste - I would call this HopBack's more ornery cousin. The hop profile is obviously stronger and gives a grassier, rougher flavor. Grapefruit is the strongest flavor, followed by some orange, banana, and spices. After the hop twang burns off, the malts appear and the beer becomes quite sweet. There is a weak alcohol burn at the end. Good balance between the bitter and the sweet.  Drinkability - What is it with these beers and hidden alcohol? I would have never guessed 7.5%. However, even if the alcohol didn't get me, my tastebuds would probably be fried after two of these. Personally, I didn't think there was quite enough carbonation.  Overall - This beer has been hailed by fellow advocates, so my expectations were high. Honestly, it didn't live up to the hype in my mind. Granted, this is still a nice beer that is well balanced for the style. It just wouldn't be my first choice for a hop fix. Still, definitely worth a try for any lover of hops.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Mouthfeel - excellent  Drinkablitity - could and will have plenty in a time period. outstanding selection from Chris and John!,Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Schooly,4.32,"Pours with very little head and a clear reddish golden color. Bubbles form around the sides as I swirl, while the lacing settles to the surface with some sticking to the glass. Whole hop aromas from what I can assume are the Nugget, Warrior and Tomahawk hops. They combine to form a somewhat mild (using the term loosely) hop aroma. Taking a sip and letting it roll around the tougue allows the sticky hops to coat my mouth while suck-gurgling releases the hop citrus and flower burn. The finish is nicely honey and caramel malty very reminicent of the Amber style - one of my favorites. I'm slurping this down so fast I'd better be careful (I have an empty stomach). This will be nice on warm spring afternoon after mowing the lawn. This should be offered all year round.

694,15881,GClarkage,4.62,"04/03/06- Received as a gift from BA member Lou91.  Presentation- 12oz bottle with no freshness dating. Poured into my Marin Brewing pint glass.  Appearance- Medium golden in color, with a 1/2 inch white head. Very nice cobweb lacing.  Smell- Extremely floral and perfumy in the nose. Maybe bits of pine hops as well. A light nose of toasted malt beneath the hops.  Taste- As the nose predicted. Lots of floral and grapefruity hop flavors. A bit of pine as well. Nice medium roasted malt flavor. Almost a green tea like flavor buried beneath.  Mouthfeel- One of the more bitter aftertastes I have encountered. Medium carbonation level.  Drinkability- Great amber brew. Make that terrific. Went great with my chedder-port cheese and artichoke and palm bruchetta on baked costini. Highly recommended. Thanks much for the sample Lou!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,phisig137,3.72,"Pours a dark gold/amber color with a head that quickly diasappears.  Aroma is purely floral and grassy hops. Very nice hop profile it seems.  Flavor again is dominated by floral hops, but with a solid malty backbone. While it's listed as a ""American Amber Ale"", I feel this is definitely an IPA. It's a nice change of pace to have something this hoppy, that doesn't have an overly citrusy ""C"" hop profile of other american IPA's.  Mouthfeel is silky and quite nice. Coats the toungue well, with just enough carbonation to dance across it. Drinkability is fairly good considering the alcohol, but relatively low for the style.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,blitz134,4.42,"Received this in a trade from BeerBeing and from WarriorSoul (if any of you read this, I'm tasting your bottle). I thought I had reviewed it already, but I guess not.  White fizzy head on the pour. Only a thin layer left over. Apricot orange, perfectly clear. A few bubbles of carbonation rise from the sides of my pint glass. Good lookin' brew.  Strong aroma loaded down with glorious hop juice. Floral and citrus hops predominately. Some orange and a bit of grapefruit, overall fairly sweet. Incredibly inviting aroma that I want to smell all day, they need to make a car air freshener that smells like this. Taste is actually a bit different than the aroma. Very spicy and sharp on the tongue, more pine and resin come though in the flavor. I like the Imperial amber moniker on this one as I feel it fits this beer. Lots of hops, especially in the aroma, with a bit extra bitterness, but nothing overwhelming.  Mouthfeel is a bit thin, probably due to the carbonation level which makes this one really crisp. Coats the mouth well and hangs around a bit. Drinkability is awesome. I could handle this one all day, if I didn't pass out.

Aroma is big on hops huge amounts of hops big citrus, pine some floral and herbal hints also man hop heads heaven here. Some malt underneath if you search for it.  Taste is lots of hops flavors citrus grapefruity and oragne, tangerine ect. mixed with pine and some medicine herbal flavors also. Huge amount of hops for a plain looking beer. Hopback Amber on steriods that said this is the best Imperial Amber I have ever had, even though it is the only one. Don't know if this is still avaliable but if it is grab it while you can its good.

Poured a small off-white head that didn't last long, but left a few strands of lace along the way. Transparent amber colored beer looks lifeless with a few bubbles lazily through the middle. Solid malt base with a faint copper taste. Fresh hops dominate all the way though. Sweet candied citrus hops are damn tasty! Finish is mildly bitter, especially for a beer with 93ish IBU's.

Pours out a clear, golden, body topped by an impressive, three finger eggshell head. Excellent retention and profuse patchy lace. Beautiful to behold. Aroma is fruity hops with a distinct note of floral orange blossom. Clover honey and pink grapefruit are very prominent. Delicate malt presence adds a touch of honey drenched caramel. Mouthfeel is creamy and medium bodied. Feels very luxurient, with a prominent hops sting. Taste comes off as very well balanced, but the hops take centerstage. Orange and pineapple are very tasty, with bitter grapefruit rind rounding things out and providing a dry finish. Malt presence balances well with a clover honey presence.

694,15881,mattpetti,4.5,"Troeg's hopback amber ale is one of my favorite beers so I jumped at the chance to pick this one up. As i was hoping this is an excellent beer. The pour is a golden amber with a large, bone white, thin foamed head. The smell is a mixture of powerfull, floral hops and sweet malts. The was a noticable amount of fruit as well such as cantelope and what i thought was pear. Taste was hops hops hops, but well balanced. Taste is of ripe fruit on the tip of the tongue followed by some maltiness. It finishes with sweet fruit and a powerful surge of hop bitterness. This beer is exceptionally smooth and coats the mouth wonderfully. You can definately have more than one off these beers, even with the alcohol content being the way it is. I wish it was available more often. If you enjoy well hopped ipa's this will more than satisfy you. Nugget Nectar rocks!!!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Cool label implies that this beer is not for the faint of heart. Pours a beautiful honey gold with a thick rocky tan head. Sticky lacing clings to the glass after every sip. Aroma is of freshly cut pine, with a little citrusy grapefruit in the background. Taste is very hoppy (93 IBU) but well balanced by the sweet malts. An outstanding brew that has no faults.

694,15881,jasonm,4.73,"On cask at the Sharp Edge Beer Emporium  Had to jump on the chance to have this on cask...  A - Poured a rich, dark honey yellow/orange color, with a foamy head that lasted the entire glass.  S - First smell is powerpacked with sweet, citrusy hops, but does not overwhelm.  T - The very first taste is a mouthful of sweet hoppines, and like the aroma subdues itself on subsequent tastings. The rest of the glass was a nice balance of orange/lemon like sweetness from the initial taste with a more floral bitterness on the finish.  M - Perfect creaminess like you would expect on cask.  D - May not be bitter enough for some hopheads, but a wonderfully smooth and balanced flavor profile.  Definitely more memorable than the pint I had on draught (not cask) at Fatheads a few weeks ago (tho that was after a pint of the DFH 90).

The smell is not what I was expecting, I thought this would be like ground up fresh hops shoved in my nose. In reality it had a mild grassy-earth citrus smell that was limp and the malt was weak behind it with a touch of alcohol. The taste was sharp hop stab and a good flavor overall the yeast leave it fruity, this is not something I really like or dislike. A yawn in these days of much better hopped beers, this needs some more hops in the back end. DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Citrusy, floral, herbal, piney resin over a nice sweet crystalline caramel background that a smidge doughy. Lupulin runs the show here in fine fashion, delightful.  First sip brings a typhoon of fresh leafy green hops. Orange and citrus with a leafy herbal tea aspect. Mix in some piney resins and you have one tasty, hoppy treat. There's a nice crisp malt background with a touch of caramel along with a hint of toasty dough. A tasty brew that brings the hops...drink it fresh!  Mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied with a sturdy blast of active carbonation on each sip. Goes down almost too easily and I could see myself adoring a six pack of this brew without blinking an eye. All hopped out but still balanced.

694,15881,kpantz,4.15,"Executive Summary: Troegs continues to impress me. Just a wonderful mix of hops against an excellent amber backdrop. Here's hoping I find more!  Appearance: Crystal-clear amber pour, with a fervent cream-colored head that's loathe to subside. Lacing is fantastic!  Smell: I may have my new air-freshener prototype. Hops aplenty...just a fantastic combination, including two of my favorites: Warrior and Simcoe  Taste: What the aroma suggested, the taste delivers. Initial malt sweetness first combined with, then overtaken by hop flavor and bitterness. This is truly a study in the tiered profile a good hoppy beer can contain. The bitterness lingers just the right amount of time after each sip.  Mouthfeel: Appropriate for a complex, hoppy brew. Not as sticky as an Imperial IPA, but since this is technically not a DIPA, this is a good thing. Medium body with a light carbonation, allowing the hop flavors to take center stage.  Drinkability: I'll gladly sit back with several of these. There's enough variability in the flavors to hold my interest over a session. 7.5% ABV isn't enough to keep me from going back to the well a few times.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

It's hops are more pungent than bitter really, but still bitter enough for the hophead in me. Mouthfeel is medium and drinkability is insanely high.

694,15881,ITK4ever,4.62,"I had been dying to try this. I thought it was only served on tap and when I found it in bottles at Stateline Liquors...I was ECSTATIC!!! Nugget Nectar did not disappoint. Hoppy...Warrior is prevalent...malt balance..but the hops hit the nose first. Poured into a pint glass, lacing was excellent and the head held. Terrific amber color. Bitter citric hops at the beginning and end, but it did alot of fleeting tastes in between. I believe that was the malt struggling to get through all those wonderful hops. I'm a hop-head, so this satisfied my urges.  My only gripe is that this is in with the Amber Ales and not so much an IPA. So it's a little heavier than my tastes. The ABV was a little lower than I thought it would be which is not bad since that can lead to a better session beer.

694,15881,Gueuzedude,3.8,"This beer is absolutely brilliantly clear, and I mean brilliant. It is a deep copper color with reddish over-tones. The head is initially two-fingers thick, but seems to disappear to a thin layer fairly quickly, it is a pale tan color. The aroma is raw and hoppy, which is quite apparent even as I am pouring this beer into my glass. Aromatic notes of sweet grapefruit, lychee, apricot are up front, but there is a raw, grassy, almost herbal, pine-like note here that plays a supporting role to all of the sweet fruit-hop notes.  The taste is sharp and bitter from the get go. Sharp herbal notes hit the tongue as the beer becomes lightly astringent, and ends with a tongue flagellating bitterness that lingers on for quite some time. There are lots of fruity hop notes here as well, a smooth lychee, almost apricot note seems to lead, but ample notes of sweet citrus fruit are also found here. This beer is missing a lot of that raw, grassy hop character that one would expect in a beer like this, but I have a feeling a lot of that was filtered out. There is just enough malt here to give a touch of sweetness, which certainly helps with the fruit notes. This beer is quite light feeling and goes down easily, it is almost on the thin side, but does manage to live up to the hop character.  I can't help but feel that a lot of the life has been filtered out of this beer (or perhaps it was never here to begin with). Don't get me wrong it is tasty, but it is missing a lot of complexity, even for a hop bomb, that would make this beer quite a bit better. Luckily, I can be a hop head, so this beer is still quite enjoyable.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Phatz,3.95,"Appearance: This beer pours a golden amber color with a great creamy three finger head that has great retention. A constant stream of carbonation fed the head through the duration of the beer. At bottoms up there was still one finger of froth toping this masterpiece.  Smell: The aroma is a remarkably sweet malt flavor. I was expecting to get hit with the hops first but first came an almost candied aroma which was then followed by the great bold hops.  Taste: I am not a hophead. (I know why would I drink something called Nugget Nectar then.) This beer actually holds up for us Malt guys as well. It does get a bit more green than my preference. I don't prefer the pine flavor but it was like eating 'sour-patch kids' candy, you almost enjoy the torture of each tart bite because it is also so sweet yet when the bag is empty you are happy for that glass of water and relief.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel was not quite as big as I would have liked to see from a beer who's flavor is so big. I was thinking American Barleywine though because in reality next to most IPAs I have had this medium bodied IPA is above average.  Drinkability: I have a one Nugget Nectar tolerance level. So I can only give it a 3 for drinkability but that said, I really enjoy that one, and them I really enjoy the relief after.  Hope this is helpful.

694,15881,RedwoodGeorge,4.3,"Oh, what a surprisingly yummy brew... After falling in love with the Hopback Amber and now the Nugget Nectar I think I've found a new favorite PA brewery (sorry, Victory...)  The pour is a very inviting medium amber-brown with a thinnish white head. The foam doesn't last long but the collar leaves some lacing on the glass as you drink it down.  The nose is full of aromatic pine and citrus notes bordering on acrid but very inviting. There's a clear resinous note that's immediately clear on the pour and it's a good indication of the flavors to come...  The taste is very impressive. I've deducted some points because the malt body is quite weak and yet it's -still- a 4.5 because the hop presentation is incredible. Strong, clear, fresh flavors of pine and citrus dominate the sip from beginning to end but there's no bitterness to detract. The malt body is practically nonexistent in comparison - just a few light grain flavors and a small touch of amber ale sweetness and fruitiness but otherwise it's all hops all the time. I can't get over the clarity of the flavors - the presentation is perfect.  Mouthfeel is good - it's a medium bodied beer with a lot of fine carbonation to lighten the drink. Bitterness is really quite miminal considering the hop flavors but it's the right amount to finish each sip.  As far as drinability is concerned, one yardstick I often use is how do I feel at the bottom of the glass - in this case I'm immediately looking forward to the next one and I'm thankful that -two- BA's were kind enough to send me Nugget Nectar. In some ways it's as unbalanced as Deschutes' Hop Trip APA which had practically no body but excellent (fresh, wet) hops. This is similar but as an IPA - a bit more than no body but again it's all hops, hops, hops.  And that's a good thing.  [Re-reviewing... On my first bottle I couldn't find much of anything in the nose but it must have been allergies - this time the taste was exactly the same and the nose just screams ""hops!"" - again, a good thing]",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Smell: Wonderful experience. Sweet, citrusy hops up front. Pronounced fruity esters rush into the nostrils. Reminded of tangerine, peach. The malts are subtle, emerging as a delicate pastry.  Taste: Extrordinary melange of hops. Bitter and piney while replete w/ fruity esters at the same time. Some background spiciness, maybe a subdued ginger? Bready maltiness, perhaps some rye.

Lots of fruity and earthy hops, with a few piney ones in the background. Well balanced with some sourdough bread malts in there. Taste finishes pretty clean for an IPA.

694,15881,mrasskicktastic,4.24,"A - Small head with moderate retention that leaves specks of lacing. Clear amber brew with mild carbonation visible.  S - An excellent bouquet of hops, a sweet pine aroma with some pleasant malt backing. The nugget hops make the aroma delicious, it is not as crisp as some IPAs, but I think it is better this way.  T - With the first sip I was not impressed, but very quickly I began to love this brew whole heartedly. The intense pine is evident and sweet throughout the flavor. The malt backing is overshadowed, but present (not as sweet as the odor suggested). There is a pretty strong bitterness in the aftertaste and next to the lingering sweet pine flavor it is wonderful.  M - Thin, smooth and very, very refreshing. Many hoppy beers lose a lot here to me because the hop bitterness creates a drying effect, but that doesn't happen at all with Nugget Nectar. My mouth was watering for more with each sip.  D - Great! I could easily session this straight to disaster. Is an excellent choice for the few foods that intense hops don't ruin.

One great BA and friend he is, especially for all the beer he has helped me consume, this one included. 12oz. bottle poured into a tulip-style glass. It pours a deep copper, almost light mahogony color with two huge fingers of foam. There's a generous portion of lacing left clining to life on the sides of the glass. The smell is something of awe. This just doesn't smell good for beer, it smells better than almost anything that's ever crossed my nose. It's that awesome. Lots of juicy hop aroma, sticky and sweet. It's perfect, really no other way to describe it. I won't even bother going on. The taste isn't fair behind. A slight sweetness moves over the tongue just long enough to make its presence known. Then's it's all hops from here. Floral and piney, all coming together. Not overly bitter, just a great hop flavor that lasts on the palate, creating a breathtaking finish.

Aroma is rich and sharp, with hops finding the range quickly. Strong and rindy. Body is middle of the road, with a fair bit of smoothness present. Some light, toasty malt works as the foundation here, upon which is layered the hops, and then more hops. Warrior, Tomahawk and Nugget, eh? Nice! A bit of grapefruit and resiny, spicy sharpness hit the palate, and the lupulins linger quite nicely. This is a solid American IPA.... very tasty! So, why's the style here American Amber/Red Ale?

694,15881,BuckeyeNation,4.42,"Coppery orange with honey colored trim. The head is the color and texture (visually at least) of tangerine mousse. It's persisting nicely, but isn't laying down much lace. That's surprising since I doubt there's anything close to a shortage of hop resins.  The nose is uber-hoppy with a complementary amount of toasted malt that, for the most part, stays out of the way. Given the hop bill (Nugget, Warrior, Tomahawk, Simcoe and Palisade), I'm not surprised that the aroma is so multi-faceted. It's primarily citric, with spicy, floral and herbal notes as well.  Nugget Nectar is exceptional, hoptastic beer. I wonder why Troegs chose to put the words Imperial Amber Ale in small print under the word Nectar. Even though the malt backbone is solid, it isn't big enough for this to be an Imperial &lt;anything&gt;. There's a fair amount of toasted maltiness that keeps the hop flavor from entering the stratosphere and *really* impressing me. Come to think of it, it does taste like a generously hopped amber ale.  I love almost all hoppy beer. My enthusiasm, however, is often dependant on the makeup of the hop bill. This one doesn't absolutely floor me like I though it might. That may be because there's too much floral grassiness and not enough citric spruciness. It's still delicious beer, but I would have designed it differently.  The mouthfeel is a fraction larger than medium, comfortably mid-range for an IPA (sorry, an Imperial Amber). I'm enjoying the sticky, resinous feel on the swallow and the carbonation is nicely muted as well. This is a hoppy drinker par excellence. Sessionabililty is questionable at 7.5%, but I'd be happy to give it a go.  Nugget Nectar is very good beer that should appeal to hopheads of all sorts.

694,15881,JackTheRipper,5,"Wow, this is one impressive beer!  A: First thing I noticed was the famous bottle art, probably one of the coolest I've ever seen. The beer itself pours a nice clear amber color. Light tan fluffy head leaves a nice bit of sudsy lacing behind. Head seems to last fairly long.  S: Utter perfection. Resiny sweet pine smells, warm malty aromas to soften the hops, everything beautifully balanced, couldn't ask for more from a beer.  T: I was expecting a bitter hop bomb, I was pleasantly disappointed. There is an abundance of hops, but they're neither bitter or biting. Strong yet mellow sticky piney flavors explode, just enough of a bready malt taste to keep things in check, soft hoppiness leads to happiness. Yum, to say the least.  M: Medium body, somewhat slick and coating feeling, carbonation is spot on and the alcoholic warmth is just lovely.  D&N: The only fault I could find with this beer is that it's not more widely carried. One of the best beers I've ever had the pleasure of drinking, ranks up there with Westy 12 and Thomas Hooker Liberator Dopplebock among my most treasured beer memories. Fives across the board are well warranted, imho. Brilliant job, Troegs brewer guy, brilliant!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,BEERchitect,4.5,"Quite possibly the best IPA I've ever had. A serious bronze, copper, golden hue; mostly clear except a light haze; with a dense bleached white head. Difficult to want to drink--you just want to keep your nose in the glass; the aroma is that good! Serious grapefruit, grassy, and citrus characters in the aroma travels flawlessly into the flavor. Could be easily mistaken for grapefruit juice if not for a moderate, yet firm malt base. Citrus flavors with low level bitterness and bite-eyness because of the caramel barley sweetness. Smooth and silky to the mouth with a lightly alcoholic and hop drying sensation. The perfect summertime refresher and a treat for the senses at any occasion.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Maestro,4,"Being a little brother, I know what it takes to grab attention. Sometimes your big brother does big, boisterous things to make himself known to you. The Nugget Nectar is definitely a bold, big brother move to overshadow the Hopback. With a thick bubbly head, you can easily see a fluffy lacing that coats the entire glass. Take a smell and you can detect a great deal of citrus hops and some fresh baked bread and biscuits. When you sip, you are hit with a strong wave of spicy hop goodness. The bready malts balance well. In your mouth, this beer is quite bubbly and seems to bite back. I could drink this one for a while, but the well-masked alcohol creeps.  Needless to say, this big brother is special. But just as I am a little brother, I have to say that the Hopback still reigns supreme.  Good job, Troegs!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,SwillBilly,4.45,"Poured from 12 oz bottle  Appearance: Pours a light copper to amber hue with a big, creamy, foamy head. Rings of lacing line the glass.  Smell: Big time citrusy (grapefruit), piny hops explode out of the glass. Has an underlying earthiness to it.  Taste: Piney hops dominate the beginning with a well balanced semi sweet malt middle. A big hoppy finish leaves the mouth dry and asking for more. Alcohol very well hidden but does warm the face.  Mouthfeel: Medium in texture, somewhat slick and oily.  Drinkability: A beer that lives up to the hype. A big hoppy imperial amber that is so easy to drink. Could easily put these back but the 7.5% abv will definitely creep up quickly. Seek this one out and enjoy. A great beer from Troegs. Glad its readily available since its now a staple of my DBF.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,NiceGuyMike,4.1,"a: dark golden amber with good head with lots of lacing. s: hops, hops and more hops. Wow...at first sniff I was prepared for the worst. I usually like the smell of hops more than taste, but for this beer I experienced the oposite. t: strong hops, deep malty sweetness that is fantastic. m: velvety smooth. Goes down so well. d: very drinkable. As I write this review I see the ABV at the top of the page for the first time. High alcohol levels. I never tasted it but did experience it. Really good stuff.  Note: first taste of this beauty was at the Slow Food and beer tasting event at Triumph Brewery New Hope PA. I was enjoying some sausages and this really hit the spot. I know why you don't rate beers you've tried at events. I would have given it 5s across the board during the event.

Head lasts nicely, with lots of sticky lace. Aroma is all about juicy citrus hops. Taste is as expected, dominantly hoppy, but doesn't go overboard with a bash of bitter beer. The fresh hop character has more depth than just bitter, which is great. Mouthfeel and drinkability both very nice for the style. Will have to keep an eye for this one.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

694,15881,battlekow,4.67,"Fucking phenomenal. Smell is piney hops through and through, with a fair amount of malt and a touch of yeast mustiness wading in to do battle in the flavor. Finishes very peppery. Honestly, though, the burps may be the best part, just a blissful experience of oily, resiny hoppiness. All the usual hyperbole about frightening drinkablility applies.  This and Dreadnaught in one week? I've gone to hop heaven (I just looked it up, and I'm surprised there's only one beer called that).  Many thanks to BeerBeing for a six pack of this beast.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,numenor1,4.52,"Pours hazy golden straw with a fluffy, sticky white head. Smells like pine needles, pine sap and white pepper, with an obvious caramel malt backing. Malt hits the palate immediately, softly sweet, toasted caramel that is immediately overridden by very round piney hops. Very slight citrus hop character, but mostly pine, spice and pepper. Malts however are never fully overcome, and pepper wins the day through the finish. Ends drying, and beautiful. Great interplay throughout. Mouthfeel is just past medium with medium low fluffy carbonation, creating a chewy texture. Scarily drinkable, in fact, I'm headed for another. One of the top 3 best IPA's I've yet had along with bell's two hearted and Laconner's hop cones in the bottle thing.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,GCBrewingCo,4.42,"The beer poured into the glass crystal clear medium copper with an off-white head which rose tall and fell slowly to lace the glass.  The aroma was hoppy and piney and resinous like a freshly cut pine tree. There was a bit of citrus in the hop aroma and a fruitiness with caramel resides behind the dry hop assault to the nasal passages.  The flavor was malty with a nice caramel malt presence and a well rounded bittering component that was understated when taken in context with the aroma. The beer was bitter, but smooth, much smoother than expected from a beer supposedly bittered to 93 IBU (according to the label). The flavor was piney and resinous and citrusy and nicely balanced with the malt.  The finish was dry with a lasting resinous hop flavor long and pleasantly into the aftertaste and beyond. The body was just above medium and the carbonation a bit on the lower side, but still the beer came off as creamy. Alcohol never really played a part in the flavor. I guess I expected a full on bittering assault in the flavor after evaluating the aroma. Nicely done!  12 ounce bottle.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,goindownsouth,4.62,"Presentation: 12 ounce bottle. Case clearly displays ""drink before 07.01.06""... The image on the front of the bottle is a classic.  Appearance: Amazingly rich looking, this amber brew left me gazing at a fluffy yet rocky off-white head. Sticky and persistent lace followed the beer all the way down the glass.  Smell: HUGE notes of hops and fresh fruit (apricot?). Amazing esthers fill the sinuses.  Taste: Surprisingly balanced. The hop twang was really complimented by the malt backbone displayed here. But the hops and citrus notes still made their presence known - with authority.  Notes: An amazing brew. While I still have some reservations about the overall drinkability of this brew, I will certainly have plenty more chances to revisit the subject.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,santoslhalper,4.62,"Appearence: Pours a clear, light copper with a thin one finger near-white head that dies down to a collar. A little bit of slow moving carbonation is present.  Smell: The smell is a gentle balance of rich, bready malts and strong floral and citrusy hops, with a tiny touch of alcohol, and a hint of oak as well.  Taste and Mouthfeel: Delicious!! Perfect balance between an IPA and a red ale. Mmmm mmm mmm... The hops create a wonderful juiciness in the mouth, and are balanced perfectly by just the right amount of malts. But, obviously, the hops are the focus, and they are truly dazzeling. Floral, citrusy, and full of long lasting bitterness. Hell yeah. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied and smooth.  Drinkability and Overall: Ah, the ever-hyped, ever-elusive Nugget Nectar finally available in bottles. And it was worth the wait, and the hype. This is a truly spectacular beer, and one I can (and probably will) drink all freaking night. Chris & Jon, once again you've created a world class brew.

694,15881,Imstillthegman,4.27,"Pours a nice golden copper color. Medium head that leaves nice lacing. Wow! Smell the hops! Very strong hoppy smell...a little pine scent to go with the citrus. The taste isn't as bitter as you would think it would be after smelling it. Mouthfeel is just a bit too bubbly. Very good beer for fellow hopheads to try. Close to a DFH 90 minute but not quite as smooth in my opinion. Still very drinkable, though.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,gbarron,4.07,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle. Bottle states it is an ""imperial amber"" with about ""93ish IBU's"" with warrior, nugget, and tomahawk hops. No freshness dating, but I know this beer was only made in the last six months or less.  A - golden orange, perfectly bright and clear. Sparklingly white, full head with tons of small bubbles that hold together nicely the whole way down. Beautiful, thick lacing the whole way. Rarely see lacing like this.  S - pungent aroma of fresh hops. Pine, pine, and more pine. Some citrus notes in there as well. Hop smell is very intense, almost smells faintly of cat piss - I'm not kidding, and in a good way. Smells like ammonia. Hint of toffee malt in there, but not much.  T - hops dominate the palate. Strong, fresh bitter flavor of pine and citrus both at the front and at the end. Dry, hoppy bitter aftertaste. There is a malt presence, however, and this beer is actually amazingly well balanced considering the hop content. Don't get me wrong - hops win out here by a long shot. But there is clearly a malt backbone to this beer, some malty sweetness is right there in the middle of each sip. Toffee, caramel, grainy biscuit. Alcohol extremely well hidden, no alcohol aromas or flavors whatsoever.  M - medium to thin body. The only points I'm taking off here are the carbonation - tingles the tongue a bit too much. Seems on the high end to me. Significant hop dryness in your mouth.  D - extremely tasty brew. I'm a little tired of the endless battle brewers seem to be having of ""my IBU's are bigger than your IBU's,"" but this is tasty. The bitterness is very well balanced and it has amazing fresh hop flavor. Give this one a try, especially if you like Hopback Amber - of which this basically seems to be a doubled up version.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Sephiroth,4.73,"Received in a huge box from Beerbeing. Phenomenal lacing, light amber color, complex hoppy aroma. Grassy, and piney, with a noticeable malt backbone.  I don't usually find such complexity of flavor in an IPA. Initial bitterness, then sweet orange, then sweet grapefruit, then bitter grapefruit. I think the malt is there, but the hops are so delicious that they alone are noticed. Piney finish on the back of my palate.  Mouthfeel is light, although the flavor makes it seem heavier. It seems oily, but the bitter finish wipes everything clean. Drinkability is obviously high for me.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,DarkerTheBetter,4.25,"This beer pours a radiant bright orange, much like orange colored hard candy. The head was tall and slightly off white that left a little lace.  Smells of an overwhelming nectarine and pineapple with an earthy, ash and pine hop dryness and a little orange juice sweetness.  Upfront, this beer had a bit of pine hops and a delicate citrus to it, but then came the onslaught of tingling acidic nectarines and apricots. Underneath this was a subtle banana and powdered sugar. Finished with a strong sappy pine.  Mouth feel was light and dry with a swarm of small bubbles that when drank slowly, seem to actively resist being swallowed. However, when drunk quickly, its only slightly tingly.  I think that this beer is easily the most potent, yet tasty hop concoction Ive ever had. The flavors are so intense, and it looks, smells and tastes a little like candy, paired with a fizzy carbonation, I want to call this hop soda. What ever you want to call it, Ill call it delicious.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

694,15881,jaluria,4.7,"This has quickly become one of my favorite beers.  Poured a light, copper-orange color with a white colored head that was thick and left behind quite a bit of lacing. Moderate to high carbonation was present. Aromas of hops, pine, citrus, and grapefruit all whirled together and ever so enticing. The taste was quite bitter with hops and grapefruit flavors dominating each sip. As I drank this beer, I felt as if I were drinking a cross between a Double IPA and a Irish Red; malty and hoppy. Slight malt presence in the finish and in the texture of the beer as it rolled around my mouth. A sour tasting finish and yet refreshing and robust. The flavors just pounce all over my tongue making me want more. This beer is such a wonderful experience, I highly recommend it.  An exceptional beer with excellent drinkability.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

The bright color is very nice.  S: Grass, pine sap, candied fruit, maybe?  T: Strong, biscuity malt back bone (like those southern-style biscuits!). Pine of course comes through, and a bite of alcohol that warms the mouth and throat very quickly. It seems very well balanced and enjoyable.  M: Strong tingling of carbonation, but not a very thick beer. Certainly doesn't dissapoint here; it feels just right.  D: IPAs have really been growing on me - or maybe I've just been drinking better ones.

694,15881,meathookjones,4.6,"I have been waiting to try this for awhile and was very happy to hear they were bottling it this year. I had high expectations for this and was not let down at all. Clear dark amber body with a tall frothy white head that left plenty of strings and webs of lacing as it was consumed. Once poured the hoppy nose jumps right out at you, piney and citric hops galore. Some sweet caramel blends in to support the hops. Very clean smell as well. Plenty of bitter grapefruit notes mixed with caramel and biscuit malts get the flavor going. Piney hops are in full affect as well. Ends with some nice bitter piney hops with a touch of sweetness. Pretty well balanced while still being juicy with hops. Very clean and crisp overall taste and smell are nice. Drinkability is about as good as it gets. I have to go pick up another case before its all gone.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,kmpitz2,4.65,"This was on my doorstep when I got home today. It pours a solid golden color with a 2 finger head maintained by a light cascade from the bottom of the glass, with clarity not to be rivaled. The dank hop aroma hit me as soon as I opened the cap. Very green and brilliant American hop profile. I really need to get more in tune with individual hop aromas, but I would image this is the tomahawk and nugget or some variation there of. The caramel base is super. There is a big sweetness, giving me illusions of spun sugar. The finish is only moderately bitter, with a moderate caramel sweetness. The bitter does not hang on too far into the finish and is very clean, not offensive. The finish is almost a touch soapy from the interaction of the bitterness and the residual sweetness. Still tasty. I really like the super fresh hop character. Very brilliant. Feel is moderate with a strong carbonation which keeps it very nice. This is a nice beer. No hint at all of the 7% ABV definately keeps it working well for me. Its deceptively drinkable and tasty, though the finish could be a little more clean. I'm going to have no problem drinking this one down!  Edit: flavor in the second bottle is not coming across as soapy to me. Lots of chunky citrusy (almost apircot with the interaction between caramel malt and the hop) fruity hop, with a ton of fresh picked green hop flavor. This one will be a staple for the near future...as long as I have more bottles around.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,dawg,3.75,"Had another nugget nectar. This time from poured from a cask into a faceted beer mug.  My last review of this beer was from the same bar (Fat Heads, Pittsburgh). I didn't have a very good experience from the tap. This time, from the cask, was much better. Actually very good.  The beer was served at the correct temperature for a cask pour. Not cold nor warm, somewhere in between. The head was already settled when the beer arrived, but not quite gone. Perhaps about 100 mils. Laces starting to cling.  The nose to this was stunning. At first I got a large woft of hops. This migrated to mellow orange peel and then ruby red grapefruit.  The feel was very soft and medium to meduim light. I was trying to rethink the feel from the tap but I don't remember the tap as good as this cask beer was. Tasted like nice clean hops and citrus fruits. The cask temperature really tamed the bitterness away. Not quite a sweet one but better balanced for my taste.  While I really enjoyed this beer, I stopped at one.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,clvand0,4.32,Pours an amber/orange color with a small head that falls fast and doesn't leave much lacing on the glass. The aroma is all citrus hops.

The body is moderate and the drinkability is good. Great hoppy brew.,Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,jakester,4.82,"Pours a clear orange with a one finger head of just off-white foam. The head falls to islands and a ring, with decent enough lacing. Carbonation appears medium.  Aroma is grassy/piney, strong but very pleasant. Fruity, with a strong mango or kiwi smell. This beer smells great! Very clean.  First flavor is big crystal/pale malt, followed quickly by hop bitterness. Juicy grassy/piney hop flavor is next. The picture on the label tells the story. This all works very well together. For as hoppy as it is, it's well balanced. Mango and kiwi fruits are there in the background, adding a nice touch. Aftertaste is a very long bitterness and a wonderful piney flavor.  Mouthfeel is resiny, medium bodied, with a low to medium carbonation. Residual sweetness is fairly sticky. Finish is sticky with a bitter grab at the back of my throat.  It is absolutely amazing that they get this much flavor and aroma from the Nugget, Warrior, and Tomahawk hops they use, considering all three hops are high alpha bittering hops.

694,15881,Terp96,4.8,"I have waited for this and I was not disappointed. Wine World in Abingdon, MD shelved this for $9.75 last week so I had to pick some up. Interesting that the bottle label indicates that this is an ""Imperial Amber."" Nice artwork too.  Pours a very nice, clear amber color. One finger thick, slightly off-white head. Nice lacing down the glass. This is a good looking beer.  Smells amazing. Very complex hop profile. You can actually pick out the tomahawk and warrior aromas. Very floral and very complimenting.  Taste is exceptional. Sweet upfront and hoppy in the back. Very complex and balanced. Not like chewing on a pine cone. Perfect balance of grapefruit and spruce.  Mouthfeel, again is very balanced. Slick and oily and not overly drying or prickly like so many IPAs out there.  All in all, exceptionally drinkable. This is an amazing IPA. Perhaps, one of the most balanced, enjoyable beers I have had. It quickly shot up my ""go to"" list. Too bad this is a seasonal.

Great piney hops followed by a citrus note. It just fills your nose with the awesome smell. I could just sit and smell this all night if it wasn't for the anticipation of what it must taste like.  Taste is just as overwhelming. Huge hops character but unlike a lot of hop bombs there is plenty of malt sweetness to back it up. This beer is so much more than the hops. Supper malt sweetness with great character.  Mouthfeel is just smoothness, with a slight dryness at the end that make you want to take the next sip. Nice carbonation level.  Ohhhh so drinkable especially at 7%. It will catch up with you if you aren't careful. I've been debating this review since the beer first came out in bottles a couple of weeks ago. My first inclination was that it deserved the perfect 5.0. A half a case later I still feel like it deserves the perfect score. This is the beer I've been searching for. Another winner from Troegs.

Great head retention that gives off a piney and citrusy hop aroma. The flavor is fantastic. Loaded with hops, but there is a strong malt backbone to back it all up. The finish was not too dry and coated the inside of my mouth nicely. This is a beer I could drink all night long, but it definitely packs a punch.

Pours a clear golden amber color with a full head of off-white head...of which 1/4 sticks around to sit gently on top, as almost suspended above the brew itself. Thick lacing holds on tight and goes absolutely nowhere for half of the pint. Sticky, piney hops in the nose and a generous amount of sweet carmelized malt to add to its odor. The taste is sweet at first, but the hops explode in the finish, coating the entire mouth with just enough bitterness and dryness to pull you instantly back for more. Mouthfeel is medium bodied and the carbonation is a touch high. Easy to throw back a few of these in an evening and you'd be well on your way.

694,15881,asabreed,4.85,"Purchased two six packs on general principle. When I say that, I mean because of both lack of availability (through bottles) and the fact that I don't how long it's going to be available. And also being a Troegs fan big time, and, well, a huge IPA fan. So I guess both turns into four reasons. At any rate: 12 oz. bottle poured into a pint glass. The beer's been chilling in the fridge for about an hour and a half.  Appearance: Yellow body, lots of bubbles rocking to the top. Looks like a normal IPA in that respect. However, there's lots of good lacing, and the head fights to stay up. Plus with a bit of a swirl it kicks back up and stays. Deceiving and nicer than expected.  Smell: An extremely harmonious balance between malt and hops. Complex. Intoxicating. A bit piney, a bit citrus, a bit of malt sweetness. The balance is remarkable.  Taste: The best IPA I've ever had? Certainly rivals DFH 90 Minute. The creaminess is insane. The taste is impeccable, with the malt overtaking the hops a bit, while the initial finish is all hops, and the long finish beyond takes it to new levels. This should be tasted in small sips. The backbone is balanced to all hell, yet still remains complex and hoppy for all the crazy hopheads. Wonderful stuff, and don't be fooled by the rumors, this is not a stronger and hoppier Hopback; this is its own thing.  Mouthfeel: Creamy, thick, and velvety, with a perfect contributing amount of carbonation which makes it a pleasure to drink. Best mouthfeel I've ever had for an IPA easily, that's for sure.  Drinkability: Worth the hype. And I hope this doesn't stay limited; this will certainly be a staple for me if I can ever get cases of it. I don't know how long it's around, and I haven't had it on tap yet, but I'm damn glad I bought two 6-packs. Bravo, Troegs.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,drugsbunny,3.7,"The Nugget Nectar offering from Troegs has been recently released in sixpacks. This beer is aptly named an Imperial Amber because it tastes just like their Hopback Amber, only bigger. It pours out with a minimal white head and has an inviting red copper hue. The smell is strong and bitter, just like pine. And the taste is signature Troegs. Bitter pine hops balanced well with the malt flavor. Sharp hop tang aftertaste and no hint of the over 7% alcohol abv. This is a very pleasant beer, but not the outstanding IPA that most people are espousing. I would be just as happy drinking the Hopback Amber, and saving two bucks.

694,15881,whartontallboy,4.67,"Pours out a brilliant, shiny clear orange-copper color with a thin white head. The head isn't enormous, but the lacing is pretty nice.  Smell is hugely hoppy...grapefruits, peaches, pine sap, spruce tips, bitterness out the wazoo. Any scent you associate with hops is pretty much in there in a thick blanket.  The flavor does not disappoint, as an initial wall of grapefruit hops gives way to a bitter, resinous evergreen flavor. However, the real revelation that I wasn't expecting was how big the malt presence was. It really made itself felt, and it was the very definition of ""biscuity."" I've called other malts biscuity in the past, but this tasted like eating a biscuit does, with light caramel tones around the edges. Lovely.  Mouthfeel is firm and well-carbonated.  Overall: Wow. This is the best IPA I've had in months, and it really goes up there with the Stones, Racer 5's, and Smuttynoses of the IPA world for me.

Smell- Candied, honeyed grapefruit with notes of Douglas fir... simply intoxicating.  Taste- The grapefruit elements flow over the tongue so completely, with a richly satisfying malt thickness that gives way to a sweet, beautiful display of Nugget and Tomahawk hops. Lasting and so well done it's a crime.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Sublime. Period.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,ScarletLady,3.3,"I was disappointed in this as were the folks I was drinking it with. It poured a nice light copper color but was done in such a hurry that it wasn't a 'proper pour' so I will skip the head & lacing. The nose was great - hoppy & floral. At first taste the hops were great, then something went terribly wrong. the finish tasted like a wet dog, almost like it was unfinished. It got a little better as you drank it, but not much. I couldn't get past the wet dog. yikes  i'm worndering if we just got a bad bottle. I looked at the other reviews and did not have the wonderful experience every one else seemed to. I guess I would try it again....warily.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,OldFrothingSlosh,4.65,"The gang at Once Upon a Vine come through for me again. Having read the message board and finding out that there was some Nugget Nectar to possibly be had in Virginia, I called OUAV and was pleased to find out that a case could be reserved. Got the call and made haste to obtain.  A: Fiery copper in color. Clear. Sticky-slathery white head leaves globs of lace on the glass. Wonderful.  S: ""Imperial Amber Ale"", eh? If by ""Imperial"" they mean ""a shitload of hops"" then I can see it. Egads! There's a threesome of sweaty hop action here: Pine cones drizzled with grapefruit juice dusted with freshly-cut grass. Surprisingly, there's a stong backbone of caramel sweetness as well. Given the vast quantities of hops this must have, that's sayin' something.  T: The first thing I thought when I tried this was that it tasted like a beefier version of DFH 60 minute IPA. This is good. Up-front sweetness quickly falls victim to the hop onslaught. Noticeable citrusy flavors last throughout the profile. Not too overwhelming. Nicely balanced. ABV cloaked almost completely. Wonderful finish. Hoppy and dry. Not very long-lasting.  M/D: Exceptional. Pefectly balanced. Creamy and slick on the palate at the same time. Spot-on carbonation. Perhaps a case is not enough?",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Fish113d,4.17,"Serving from a growler and into a pint chilled.  It pours a amber honey color with a dense, spongy off-white head (about 1/3""). The body is very clear and nice. The head is very sticky to the glass.  Aroma? Hops! A strong pine & earthy hops aroma shoot through my nostrals along with some slight candy aromas (sugar).  Sipping reveals a very strong and bitter hops flavor that feels very creamy, while the carbonation is not overbearing. Toward the swallow a sweet rock candy flavor pops through the bitterness of the hops to help balance this out. Odd to me though that usually I get sweetness up front with the bitterness coming after; this is the opposite; it starts bitter and sweetens up just a bit keeping my jaw from clenching. Very nice and interesting.  The alcohol is present in this one just a bit, which helps dry it out toward the swallow. The body is a bit creamy actually, making it more medium-bodied than most IPAs I've tried.  Overall, I'm glad I got a growler. I bet i can finish it! haha",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,ggaughan,4.3,"I just picked up a case of Nugget Nectar this evening at the Beer Yard. I had this last week on tap and in growler but I had to also try the bottles.  The beer poured a nice copper color with a medium thickness off-white head that lingered. There was also some good bubble activity from the bottom of my tulip glass. At first sniff you get a strong piney, hoppy aroma which is wonderful and refreshing. The taste was a nice thick hoppy, piney taste that I enjoy. I find this beer very drinkable although it has a fairly high ABV of 7.5%. I even convinced my wife to enjoy this beer.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,joeskirkie,4.03,"Wow, orange, slightly reddish, as it let's the light pass through...it's beautiful. Such a strong head, off-white.  A grapefruit punch in the nose right away, nothing subtle there. It has some leafy hints to it.  Tastes of leafy hops then a bitter punch. This beer keeps punching! It's spicy and well carbonated.  I am loving this beer, no doubt, but I can't help but feel that an attempt to session with it would not end well for me. But until I can build up my tolerance I'll always make room for a few of these when I can.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,sacfly,4.3,"12oz, no dates  Pours a clear copper/orange color. Huge aroma of sweet oranges and a touch of pine. Head is minimal, but carbonation is adequate.  First taste is hops up front with pine sap dominating the palate. Malt is there and comes through only enough to add a hint of sweetness before a dry, bitter finish. A long bitter after taste to this one, in a good way. Easy to drink.  Kind of in a happy in between range Defiantly above the Average gravity beers, but Im not quite with the Imperial title I would love to see what an even more amped up 9% version of this would be. May improve the body a bit and place it clearly in the Imperial range and add to the already nice orange color. With the body on the light side and the malt barely noticeable, I cant separate this from a great, solid IPA. A bit of nit picking on the style/title, but I loved this beer either way.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,PartyHatjo,4.32,"Appearance: Pours a deep amber color, more red present than yellow. Head is offwhite, shades of tan, but unfortunately disippates quickly.  Aroma: Strong citrus pungent hop aroma. Covers up most of the aromas from the malts. Definitely good for a hophead  Taste: Citrus upfront mellows to a slight malt sweetness. The 2006 batch doesn't seem to have the sweetness of past batches which is the only thing this beer loses point tastewise. Nice bitter bite (from the 93ish IBUs).  Mouthfeel: A little thin in body for an ""imperial"" beer. Again something that was better in past additions where there was definitely more body.  Drinkability: Easy to quaff, alcohol presence is not overwhelming, but you can feel it after a couple brews.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Chadbrew,4.4,"This beer is kind of like a tasty hop popsicle. It's brilliantly clear and pinkish-orange. There's a nice head and above average lacing. The aroma is nice and seems to be heavy on the nugget/palisade? hops, which makes it really appetizing. Oh my god the taste is awesome. I am so happy my first taste of this is from a very fresh beer, there isn't a trace of oxidation, in fact... there isn't a flaw to this brew. It is sweet and hoppy with a pleasant aftertaste. I'm gonna rip through this sixer, no doubt.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,sublimesipping,5,"I have had this on tap and now in bottle this mild winter season. Review is based on the latter with influence from the former. WOW! This beer is simply my favorite beer, the best most complete beer that I have been priviledged to enjoy. Is this the best beer out thers? My mind says no, but the palate says this ROCKS! Appearance is beautiful, very beautiful amber color, my favorite most enticing beer color. It promises smoothness and this beer delivers and how. The aroma is of Hops, HOPS, and more hops... piney, citrusy, enticing. taste puckers and warms more than any other super hopped beer. the balance is amazing, no over the top bitterness, just strong, full, utterly enjoyable mouthfeel. A definite sublime experience. My beer of choice this year- will line up for a case and push this to infinity. GET IN THE KNOW before its to late BAs, but don't pay too close attention to rob me of more.  This is an exquisite beer from a micro at the top or their game. wonderful, thanks for the memories...",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Citadel82,4.03,"This a gorgeous beer. Plain and simple. Poured a bright orange with a creamy and sticky off-white head that sticks to everything in sight!  Aroma was lush floral hops, citrus and pine and hints of toasted malts and caramel.  Taste is sharp tangy hops, medicinal, spicy and tongue blasting with a backdrop of pale malts and some toasted bread.  Mouthfeel is rich and thick - like the head - with a longish dry finish.  Very drinkable.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Foxman,4.5,"It came to me a clear amber, with rising columns of carbonation flashing bits of orange. A finger or so of white head soon settled to a matte of froth. Lacing was plentiful and frilly.  The aroma was a swirl of earthly delights, with tree sap pine dancing with dry citrus and floral essence, along with a mild grassy note. The malt crept through fleetingly, providing a glimpse of caramel and currants.  Upon tasting, the hops made the first and biggest move, delivering up coniferous pine, ripe grapefruit, and more grounded flowers. The malt was pushed to the middle, and there made a small show of toffee sweetness and dried fruit deepness. The alcohol was present, but never more than a side note. The close was again dominated by the hops, though more muted this time, and the finish dried to a lingering flow of bitter but juicy undertones. Tilted to the hops, the malt was the backbone, and the result was a well-crafted bonanza of juicy hop-worship.  Medium bodied, the rich, juicy hops feel slid like oil on the palate, and the resulting glow was a joy to behold.  When you name a beer Nectar, you'd better hope it delivers on the promise. This beer does exactly that, bringing the hops into play as the star, and allowing them to buttress a smaller but capable malt presence. The ABV is totally manageable, especially in the name of enjoying yet another pint of this wonderful, dare I say it, nectar. It stands tall, is bigger than the sum of its parts, and it says just what it is. Now, let's get those bottles into my neck of the woods!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,monkeybutler,4.31,"Pours a clear amber, with a nice head, good lacing and carbonation.  Nose is of citrusy american hops. Malt aroma doesn't quite present itself.  The taste is great. It has a really nice malt/hop balance, with lots of both. Very well done. I don't give 5s very often at all, but the taste gets a 5, as far as I'm concerned.  The mouthfeel is creamy and sticky. Definitely a plus.  It's very drinkable, and at 7.5% could get me in trouble if I'm not careful.  Although ""Imperial Amber"" isn't really a style, this beer certainly fits well among other, stronger American IPAs. It's not quite a DIPA, and the drinkability can attest to that. I'll definitely be revisiting this beer in the future.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Light golden amber with a short sand colored head of fine bubbles that slowly settles, leaving plentiful lacing. There are bountiful carbonation streams racing to the surface. The smell is of bold, bright, green hops, citrusy and piney with a promising bite. There are also tree sap and alcohol notes. The hop smell sticks in my nose. Boldly hopped up front with lots of pine, the malt takes over in the middle and the one finishes subdued, with only hints of hops. There is no lingering hop oil, which I expected from the smell. This almost leaves without a trace. Medium body with a creamy, but light mouthfeel, there is plentiful carbonation to move the hops across the tongue. Once swallowed though, it is as if the was nothing there. The palate is left surprisingly clean.  This is definitely drinkable, and unless you keep the empties handy, you might not realize how many youve had.

694,15881,JMH_,4.47,"First off, enough can't be said that this was bottled on 01.27.06 and in my house exactly one week later. Gotta love fresh beer.  This one pours a nice crisp amber colour. It is quite similar looking to the HopBack, although a touch lighter perhaps and certainly a bit more stickier, but the overall appearances are still very much the same.  The aroma is simply awesome: hops galore. There's a grassy smell, a juicy smell, a touch of citrus fruit, some floral notes and some pine as well.  The flavour adds to the hop attack, however the hops flavour, whilst still dominant, is nicely subdued for what this brwe is. malt flavouring is mixed in quite nicely as is a touch of sweet caramel. Alcohol presence is faintly scattered throughout but not even remotely offensive at any point.  This is a nice crisp brew with some bit to it that is very easy to come back to again and again. It doesn't reach the goodness that is the HopBack, but it is an extremely well crafted, tasty beer in its own right. Troegs has once again brewed another kick-ass beer. This is definitely worth a purchase if you see it.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96

Taste is pure, concentrated honey bliss and caramel up front mellowing out to give way for kick ass hops with enough strength to make you notice tastebuds where you never knew you had any. Banana and pear again present and carries over abit in the long lingering aftertaste in which the good hoppiness slowly fades out but never quite leaves completely. Incredibly well balanced. Mouthfeel is abit fuller than most IPA, feels more like a double IPA actually. Good coating.

Aroma is wonderful resiny hops upfront and some grapefruit, orange, caramel, and malts. Taste is absolutely awesome. The big hops taste from the nose are present, but the bitterness is sublimely balanced by the biscuity malts that first hits your tongue. Hints of caramel and honey in the malts are nicely complemented with the piney hops aftertaste, which isn't overly bittering but lingers nicely. Beer was medium bodied with a silky smooth mouthfeel. This is one of the best IPAs I have ever drank, and I will easily finish my growler tonight. Thanks again weeare138.

694,15881,tavernjef,4.42,"Clear and bright dusty orange body with a thin white cap of tight froth. Slips away quickly as it unfolds from a heavy pour. Keeps a loosely bubbled collar and the lace sticks in minimal strings.  Nice floral citrus nose. Boastingly big with a nice grapefruit peel zest and solid pine notes. A fine spraying mist of caramel keeps company on the back quarters.  Flavors are consistent with the aroma, solid piney hops upfront, tamely handled bite and bitterness to its portions. Delicate floral acsents with squeezes of citrus peels. Smidgeons of caramel in the back, way back areas. Takes a toasty grain turn just past midway... and now this is where it gets really fun. Woohahh...nice finishing qualities totally turn this into a whole nother elemental brigade of hoppy stuff. What I find most interesting and striking is the toasty blackened grapefruit peels that escape the hopped oily coating and blended dark pine and earthy dirty peach tones that smoothly float off with only the smallest amount of bitterness. Amazingly in check bite control. Quite fun to behold, just for the sake of its finish.  Feel is medium creamy with a slight hop oiled finish and tends to carry more toastyness to its overall character then the citrusy stuff. Another unique position intwined into the character. At least in most parts, in kinda sweeps back and forth between the two and definately ending more citrusfied with a blackenedness to its edges.  A unique IPA to say the least. The first offering I had of the Nectar about a week and half ago had not survived its rapid transit from PA. But this serving fared much better and satisfing.

The body was pale and clear with a foamy off white head. The smell of highly volatile citric and piney hops got my mouth salivating for the first sip, and it did not disappoint. The taste was dominated by leafy and grapefruit hop flavor as anticipated. The malts were solid in their caramel drizzled biscuit flavor, but the hop oils were definitely the king of the hill. Towards the end of each sip the hops turned peppery and resinous but the beer was never overly bitter. I guess there was enough malt sweetness in here to balance the hops. The beer felt airy and refreshing despite the medium thick body. This is one tasty IPA with not a single flaw to be found anywhere.

694,15881,ski271,4.97,"I think I was starting to hit a little rut in my beer reviewing. I hadn't tried anything outstanding in a while and was starting to think maybe I was getting a rather jaded. Then I had a pint of this ale at Zeno's in State College, PA one afternoon and... WOOHOO!!!! Now what's what I'm talking about.  Appearance: Slightly hazy, medium orange-copper ale with a small, tight, foamy, white head with good retention and excellent lacing. Very inviting.  Smell: ok so I didn't instantly go ""woohoo"", but when I took a whiff of this stuff, I silently became giddy with anticipation. The aroma is about as good they come. Wonderful, fresh, big hops up front. Fruity & pungent, a nice sweetness, pine, caramel, and citrus. But wasn't going to get too excited yet, because I've had several beers that have smelled marvelous, but the taste is disappointing...  Taste: Here's where I go woohoo. No disappointment here. Yes, it has big hop flavors and that's probably most noteworthy of this beer, but then the hops bitterness mellows a little to reveal a marvelous, sweet, malt backbone and let it shine for a short time. Flavors of pear, raisin, caramel and honey become more apparent. Then bitey hops flavors charge back on the finish, which is long and resiny. Wonderful!  Mouthfeel: Medium-full body, a slick, resiny texture, and soft carbonation.  Drinkability: More like an IPA, but if you rate these type of beers by how hoppy they are, this one will not be THAT high on the list because they don't go overboard, instead concentrating on the balance versus a hops slap-in-the-face approach. One of the best beers I have been introduced to in a while. Fabulous balance! Remarkably satisfying! Exceptional quality! A must try! Have I raved about it enough yet?  Edit 4-1-06 Now that they've bottled it, I find that it is the new staple in my fridge and my new favorite 'anytime' beer. Too bad it's only a seasonal, but maybe its huge popularity will change that.

Lots of full hop resin and piney grapefruit coming through backed with a ballsy sweet maltness that doesn't quit. Taste is excellent! Starts on the front and middle of the tounge with the sweet maltiness but the killer finish is what makes this brew exceptional. It doesn't numb your tastebuds on the back with an overkill of hops. It's well balanced and gives a slight linger which comes back through the sides of your mouth to the tip of your tongue, making you lick your lips in utter delight. This brew is extremely drinkable as well. After drinking a few other outstanding IPA's on the same night, this one stole the show. I want more and more!

The aroma was super, and lets you know this will be a tasty brew - bold piney hops, citrus, and strong caramel.  The flavor is big, as malt is upfront with the strong hop level creating a nice bite. Tons of caramel candy. The citrus tones change on your tastebuds as first blast is sweet orange and tangy grapefruit comes through while swallowing.  Mouthfeel is smooth and lightly crisp up front. Mildly dry and crisp at the finish. The bitterness and caramel continue on the tongue well after the swallow.

Excellent lacing.  Aroma is a huge grove of extremely fresh grapefruit and pinapple, among other fruits.  Taste begins with a sweet malt foundation which maintains it's position all the way through. Quickly though, the mouth is engulfed by fresh fruity hop juice. Not mouth puckering bitter, but extremely refrshing and tingling.  Medium mouthfeel, which works just fine.  Drinkability? I can't keep the stuff in my glass.  Another winner by Troegs, and one that hopefully will be bottled next year.

Aroma: pine mixed with caramel, a bright, hoppy amber-y nose, rife with hops, a mellow citric blend, but leavened with other sensations, as well, apple meets toffee, etcetera...and I like that. Let's drink, shall we? Mmmmm! Big, bristling caramel-coated hop feel on the palate, very spicy and slick, with a thick feel on the mouth, a never-ending twang that resounds throughout the senses. Excellent malt back-up. Damn, this is tasty! Slightly sweet, but with no relenting from the hop department, it's a continual kick, riding on the bready, malty, toffee-like underpinning, a thoroughly tasty tango. The first IPA in a long time to really remind me of my hometown favorite, Masala Mama. Close, but not quite...I kid...but rejoice, Pennsylvanians, you've got a good one in Troeg's! Medium to full in body, with a long, hoppy finish, and a rich, unparallelled flavor...well,except when compared to...nope, not going there...

It is well balanced with a thick and rich pale and carapils malt scent and a heavy load of floral hops that tantilize the nose. The taste is great also. It has a very malty core that is the base for this brew. The hops hit you hard and often. They are so intense and add a sweetness to the brew. It is bitter and refreshing and lingers in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is great. It is a medium/full bodied beer with adequate carbonation. This is a kick ass beer.

I really enjoyed it; an awesome beer.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,99bottles,4.44,"Appearance: Sexy. There's something about the cascading beauty of a fresh beer from a handpump. When it settles out, the body is a light orange tinted gold color. A creamy head of miniscule bubbles sits atop the beer like a crown.  Smell: I get a nice boquet from this of some bitterness and some sweetness. The hops aren't really part of the nose, but rather the leafiness seems to have subsided as the effects (sweet and bitter) take over. I hate to say it, but last year's (which I must admit I only had on regular draft, not cask) seemed much hoppier and more robust.  Taste: This is a real treat on cask. I know anyone who gets to try this will know what I mean. The slight sourness of a cask beer makes this come across more light and sweet than any other beer I've tasted. The malts are perfect. They hold together sweet and so smooth that your tongue will be in heaven. The hops lend a nice flavor of sweet honeysuckle and fresh grass. Then, the nuggets finish strong. Nugget is a somewhat uncommon hop variety. This is why. It lends such a sharp bitterness without the strong leafy, piney hop flavor many people are used to in their bittering hops. This finish is contrasted by the slight twinge of the cask conditioning which plays with the sweet floral qualities at first, and then falls back as this intense bitter ending pulls through. What's nice; the bitterness isn't like a Ruination or Hop Wallop bitterness. It goes away rather quickly. This doesn't kill the tastebuds. It just streches them. And as much as I don't want to say this, because this is a great beer regardless, last years smelled and tasted much hoppier. Maybe less dry hopping this year? That's fine too. The differences are what makes such a seasonal treat special.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: Uh, yes. This is so easy to drink on cask. The smooth body, the perfect head, the low carbonation, the cask temperature; they suit this in a complimentary way. The bitterness might be the only thing to hang you up on this, but that won't occur until you've had multiple, multiple pints. This is good stuff. Hooray for Troeg's!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,stingo,4.8,"What a great beer this is - perfectly balanced hops and malts, especially when first tapped. Burnished buttery hops, together with a biscuity type malt make this a treat for the palate. The hops were even more vibrant, but not at all a bitter beer. The lacing just cascades down the glass, and it retains a good dusting on the beer to keep things interesting. I can only imagine what this is like cask-conditioned, but for coming from a keg is it one helluva beer. Seek it out and you will definitely not be disappointed.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,francisweizen,4.9,"'/start rant' I've been reviewing less beers recently, and I have recently taken up the habit of not reviewing anything on tap form that I have had in bottle form or vice versa, unless the other form of the beer is very different, and worthy of a whole new review. Whilst, this is often the case with cask renderings of favorite brews, this beer was truly morphed into something even better on cask, and whilst there is certainly a ""perfect"" beer or several ""perfect"" beers for each and every BA. This stuff has definately become a ""perfect"" beer for me! '/end rant'  Sampled FRESH off of the hand-pump at the drafting room in Exton. Cask nectar was a slight cloudy, fluffy orange colour with a nice soft head for a cask ale. This actually visually reminded me of UK Cask Boddingtons, however, it did not taste like boddingtons at all! This brew still smells like super fresh hops that were dipped in honey and sugar! The aroma is also more hoppy in this years batch, perfecting it for me. The taste is perfect, a lovely blast that seems to combine the favorite aspects of my favorite hoppy beers and roll them all into one awesome flavor profile. Nice. Mouthfeel is perfect on cask. Soooo creamy and smooth. The ultimate session beer for sure, but at 7-8%abv it could beomce a rough night after a while! Drinkability, like I said is extremely good. Liquid crack anyone. Sure there may be ""better"" hoppy brews out there and many BA's may not be too ""impressed"" by this excellent example of an Imperial Amber. But hye, to each their own I say. To me, as it stands, this brew on the hand-pump is hoppy perfection. I just wish I bought a growler of cask nectar from the Drafting room! D'oh!  I had this several times since this review and the drinkability does not hold up to '5' standards...",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Erix,4.79,"Pint glass filled from growler. Appearance: A pale amber colored beer, with gold highlights. Decent pour yielded a liquidy head (large bubbles, not rocky at all) that dissipated somewhat quickly. Very clear. I believe this is lighter than the Hopback amber which this is related to. Smell: Mmmm.. delicious! Piney, citrusy hops most of all. Very fresh, green, and resinous, with a little malt trying to poke through. Probably the best smelling IPA I've come across. Taste: The hops in the scent come across just as strongly in the first sip. Full of flavor and freshness, but not with the brutal bitterness I've come to anticipate in many American IPAs. The malt is assertive enough to counter balance the hops a bit, but make not mistake about it. This beer is about the hops first. A wonderful combination of piney grapefruity hops. Mouthfeel: Pleasently refreshing, yet with a somewhat oily astringency and minor alcohol warmth trailing off in the end. After a few sips of this the hops seem to almost numb the tip of the tongue. Neat! Drinkability: Dangerously easy to drink. At 7% this is no weak session beer, but I want to treat it like one. I just got the growler tonight, and doubt it will make it until tomorrow.  I was anxiously awaiting the rerelease of this beer for quite some time now, and am glad to see that I did not build it up too much in anticipation. Just as good as I remember it, which would speak volumes to anyone who has heard me rave about it in the past. Seek this out!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,blitheringidiot,4.13,"Cloudy orange golden with tan pillowy cloudy cap cover, leaving foamy head lace.  Sharp hop Nugget (?) bite. More relaxed nose than in the standard 10th.  First swigs: Deep resin pine hop above all else. Thicker than the carbonated like drinking maple syrup still retaining dry aftertaste.  Becomes low-carbonation syrupy floral mix that happened to cross my path twice at the Drafting Room...and on cask!!! Sweet!!!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,crookedhalo,4.12,"Pours an amber-garnet color with a fluffy beige whipped head though the hand pump. Big flowery hop aroma with some sweet malt notes, too. Smooth and luxurious at 55 degrees. Good, balanced malty flavor, with a lesser amount of hops noticable in the taste than in the nose. Good live beer, with an impressive yeast quality throughout, but hurts in the drinkability because I feel it's a bit too sweet overall to session with. Props for a fine IPA.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,ngandhi,3.84,"This is my first Troegs and my first cask-conditioned beer. Thanks to WVbeergeek for his generosity.  As a homebrewer, I immediately recognize this as beer fresh out of the fermenter. The vivid hops, hints of yeast, and flatness, but just a hair more viscous than you'd expect, are all signs. Though there's no head and no visible trace of CO2, the tiniest of pricks on the tongue shows that there is some sense of finishing to this -- that it isn't just raw beer -- but this is the closest I've ever come, outside of having a taste from my own fermenters, to tasting beer in its purest form.  It smells like raw, floral hops in the boil, tastes much the same with a keen eye on bitterness that's balanced by great residual sugar, and has the mouthfeel of liquid gelatin. Either it's the residuals or the hopping schedule, but this needs a touch more bittering. As it is, I think it walks a fine line between pale ale and IPA. Despite the light sweetness, the finish is silky, but drying. Barely smoky at the end and really more from the hops than the alcohol. This might be one of the best balanced beer in the world.  There's an obvious -- even intended -- one-dimensionality to this beer because of the single-hop focus, but Nugget Nectar manages to escape that and give us something really complex, opening up to spiced caramel apple and yeast. Bitter, yet sweet; full-bodied, yet quaffable; raw, yet refined.  I could see this being good with carbonation.  Relax, relax. ng",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,DrunkenPanther,4.77,"Trying this cask beer, I was expecting yet another extreme IPA that seems to be cranked out of every brewery these days. I was surprised to say the least at the Nugget Nectar. It came out with a nice creamy head and a beautiful dark yellow color. The smell was like smelling a bunch of flowers. Very fruity smelling. When it came time to finally taste this brew, it nearly blew my socks off. Although it was saturated in hop taste, it was not the type of hop taste that leaves you all puckered up. Surprisingly, this beer went down incredibly smooth. The malt to it gave the prefect balance so one could actually ""taste"" the hops and not be overpowered by them.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,WVbeergeek,5,"Well I already awarded this beer a five does anybody know of a way to kick up the 5 to at least a 6 or so. Amazing on cask I enjoyed three pints without thinking about it so damn good. Appearance seemed a bit darker amber copper mix than the tap version that had a golden tone to it poured slightly hazy thick lucious cream colored creamy textured head locking in the hop aroma. Aroma contains more hops a burst of flowery earthy hops incredible smell the sugary malt backbone shines beautifully, amazing brew my friends. Taste, gets an A+ liquid crack so tasty the creamy texture of the cask conditioning is amazing the sweet malts and caramel buttery sweet flavors are orgasmic man the hop flavor bitter and hoppy as hell but completely uniform and balanced as a whole, get down on the knees I'm not worthy beer gods. Mouthfeel: Medium body fluffy texture hop resins glide across the palate. Drinkability: Wow, incredible I just traded a growler of this for a Dark Lord bomber believe me we are both making out.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,erica,4.88,"This is a beer that I was afraid to try (i have a mental thing against bitterness or hops) but ended up not wanting the growler to end! It poured a pretty deep red-golden colour, with a little bit of a head. It smelled like buttery hops, also malty and a bit sweet. It tasted sooo good! I thought it was very well-balanced, not too bitter but it was hoppy and also very malty and buttery and bready, I guess like nectar a bit too. Mouthfeel was rich and smooth and perfect and each sip left me wanting another! It was one of the few beers of late that actually made me smile. And if a beer makes me smile, it's definitely a good one!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,beergeek279,4.25,"Served on cask at Fathead's. The color was amber, with a foamy white cask head. The smell was a strong grapefruit hop. The taste was a very grapefruit-like hoppiness with just the faintest hint of the amber malt and an almost buttery taste, and very slight noticable alcohol. Mouthfeel felt very creamy. As for drinkability, could have a few of these.  A nice single-batch offering from Troegs. A nice strong hop presence makes this a beer that hopheads would die for, and though I'm in a bit of a malt phase, I still enjoyed this one and would gladly have it again.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,farHillsBrewer,4.71,"The cask version of this ale simply blew me away. It came out of the firkin with a soft creamy head and laced all the way down. The color ws a reddish amber. It was lavishly hopped with Nugget, Warrior and Tomahawk. Like lupulin butter ladled across the palate. I had about the tenth pint from the firkin and the glass lasted almost an hour(it was my third and final beer of the evening). I really wanted another but having to drive home I resorted to stealing a few sips off my buddy's glass. Among the best cask ales I've ever had.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,mkobes,4.05,"Nice hoppy beer. Very roasty. Excellent. It had a nice hop bite to it. Interesting. Pours a nice dark color with a thick tan head. Perfect Pour. I got it at Andy's Corner Bar in Bogota, NJ. Nice caramel notes to it. Very good. Malty. It is roasty like coffee is. Enjoyable.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,ElGuapo,4.03,"A golden orange colored brew topped in a thick off-white covering of foam. The nose is full of hops, and it is very floral and citrusy. Sweet aromas balance, and it looks like I am in for a good one.  It is hoppy and it has some bite, but the hops are a bit more mellow than I had expected. It has good balance with some nice sweet flavors coming from the malts. The overall floral hop flavor is very pleasant, and although I could have used a little more punch, it was just fine. The mouthfeel was great from the cask, so smooth. The drinkability was also excellent, and I could see a few of these going down in a night.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,IrishRedRock,4.07,"I've gotten to try this tasty brew on cask twice now, Grey Lodge and Andy's Corner Bar. Murky brownish color with a beautiful hop aroma billowing forth from the glass. From the nose, I'd thought this would be a hop bomb in the flavor as well, but surprisingly it isn't. The hoppiness is very noticeable, but does not wreak havoc on the tongue. Note: hops which wreak havoc on the tongue are never a problem with me. Seriously though, this is very well balanced for the style. A biscuity maltiness shines through very nicely to keep this in check. Lightly citrusy and bready. Mouthfeel feels a tad thin. All in all another nice beer from a brewery that needs much more recognition.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,stirgy,4.37,"I was denied a tasting of this at the Firkinteenth (Doh!), but Scoats has graciously put this in the Grey Lodges rotation. Its a good thing I got to try it, mainly because its pretty damn fine!  Orangey-gold in color. Very bright and clear with a thinning head. The hops really own the bouquet in this beer. Ruby red sweet grapefruit mustiness. The taste is earthy, sweet and soft with fruity malts and some chocolaty/caramel notes. Slightly chewy and syrupy. Medium to full bodied, bittersweet with a nice and heavy balance. Soft and pleasant bitter sting left on the tongue. A very nice and surprisingly drinkable strong beer.  Keep it up, bros!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,nomad,4.42,"Hazy with an odd color mixing crimson and blonde, this beer is topped by a beige-colored head, sudsy and thick but stuck around fairly well.  Smell was grapefruit with a nice arborous tone, like some strange sort of fruity tree whose flowers are in bloom. A truly pungent leafiness, its scents are accompanied by just as much big sweet and spicy scents. The big amber malts and hops are tightly wound together though, creating an interesting mix.  Taste is plenty of tasty hop flavor over wonderful Munich malts, with some rough edged sweet malt flavors as the high-alpha hops do their work. Spicy hops in a low-grade way, I could feel the alcohol softly hum in the background. Hard not to call it a suped-up version of their Hopback Amber, with the malts becoming much sweeter and the hops more punchy, showing larger shades of edgy citrus fruits. Yet, the bitterness was relatively low, aided by all that amber sweetness. Moderate mouthfeel.  Simply, a damn good beer that must be made again.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Jarod,4.54,"McGraths in HarrisburgFirst beer poured from the newly acquired keg. Yes I am thrilled about this!  This beer was poured an amber gold color that was crystal clear, and decently carbonated. The head that was created was beige in color and was thick, creamy, rich, full and sticky in consistency, and very long lasting. The lace that was formed was creamy in texture, sheety at first then spotty delicate in other areas, but really sticky. The aromas that came from the glass were ooh so complex, first pine needles/Christmas trees hit you, then a light citrus hop (grapefruit like) aroma comes forth, then a surprising aroma of flowers - either tulips or a dogwood tree comes forth, all kind of earthy/springy smells are always present, then as it warms spices (allspice) becomes noticeable, then grapes. The aroma is really fresh and clean. The tastes were not as complex as the aromas, but really nice. Tastes of pine needles, fresh hops, a citrus bite in the front and middle, earth tones throughout, some roasted malts (light), crunchy fall leafs, and allspice as it finishes. A dry finish to each swallow. The aftertaste was mostly dominated by piney hops. The body was medium. This is a creamy, smooth beer that is not overly hopped, and is well blended. As this beer warms and mellows, all aromas and flavors blend like a perfect dance. A well-done job from the Troegs brewery. I would like to see this as a permanent stallion in your stable.",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
694,15881,Edwin,4.47,"I was fortunate enough to get John at Kclinger's to tap this one ASAP. I was also fortunate enough to get the first taste of this brew. Damn, this stuff was worth the wait. (If this is not a true IPA, please make the change, but i'd say it fits).  Appearance - A reddish/golden/amber color with a caramel-colored head. Much like the Hop Back Amber (as advertised). The head disappears, but here is some lacing and a little bit of head that stays to the bottom. Good stuff.  Smell - Ahhh, hops. And a LOT of them. Reminded me of the Hop Wallop for a second with the hoppy smell. Has some hints of pine and a tad bit of fruitiness in there, too. A great boquet for hop heads!  Taste - I am not a huge fan of the Hop Back anymore, but this was one hell of an improvement. Hops abound throughout (Nugget, Warrior, and Tomahawk per the Troeg's website), with some pine, caramel and a pinch of bitterness. Also reasonably sweet, without that hard bitterness on the end. This was truly WAY better than I expected. The look on my face alone got three other people to get this. Troegs has outdone themselves with this complex limited brew.  Mouthfeel - Easy going, smooth, some of that great bitterness from the hops, yet a silky smooth finish.  Drinkability - Yeah, this is a very drinkable beer. 7% alcohol, but worth the plunge. I was tempted to sit and down a few of these, but tomorrow is another day.  Overall - A+!! If anyone in the area an get their hands on this, DRINK IT. If you are a hop head, you'll love it. Even if you are not, it has such a grat character. True Dat!",Tröegs Brewing Company,"Pennsylvania, United States",Imperial Red Ale,96
