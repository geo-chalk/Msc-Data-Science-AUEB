10099,9086,ryan1788a5,4,"12oz bottle poured into a snifter. 2017 vintage, 5 years old.  A: The most vigorous pour I could muster did not turn up any head. Deep brown in color with good clarity. I half expected sediment, but there really isn't any. Not much in the way of lacing either. A few tiny specs.  S: A lot of raw honey, apricot, malty aromas of fig jam and a pop of berry. Highly estery with pineapple/tropical notes. Orange marmalade complete with peels. Earthy and leafy notes with that aged ""forest floor"" character. Treacle and a hint of toast/crust.  T: Follows the nose. Lots of raw honey up front, figs and berries, richer malty notes of molasses and toasted crust and scones. Very tropical and estery- big notes of pineapple, starfruit, papaya. Orange marmalade. Hit of warming alcohol. Downright spicy with herbal oiliness. Earthy and leafy. Dose of ""musty book"" and nutty sherry oxidation. Aggressive spicy/oily hop finish with trailing alcohol heat and figgy malt.  M: very thick with a ton of coating residual sugar. It is syrupy in texture. Good pressing sense of weight. Carbonation is fading, but there's still some fine pricking around the tip of the tongue. Gritty hop astringency.  O: This beer becomes very interesting with age. It might be an acquired taste for those who prefer IPAs fresh, though. It becomes a three way brawl between a brawny malt character, aggressively estery alcohol, and a good dose of oily/spicy hops. Age has deepened that malt into a lot of fruity complexity, brought out more earthy ""forest floor"" hop notes, and a lot of musty and sherry-like oxidation. It's also hot and a bit much when fresh though. Something like 1-3 years of age may be the sweet spot for me I think, but it comes down to preferences. It certainly isn't bad now.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,eatsluggs,4.29,"Well, well, 15$ for this one. Had to try it. Nice experience after a hard day of work. But no sir, it ain't for me. Tastes like a bitter honey syrup. Low to no carbonation. Definitely worth to try. Once!!!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,WIllBonds,3.99,"Yea, this IPA is an icon. However, not the most drinkable IPA for the masses. Your wife nor girlfriend will like this beer! I have heard the term Robitussin voiced. However, you, as a beer drinker, must try it at least once. I’ve tried it several times.Heavy and alcoholic are the first terms that come to mind. Refreshing, no. Tasty, yes. Everyday, no.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,izraelc,4,Pours a cloudy copper. Thin foam. Very chunky. Cider aroma. Huge malt and hop flavor simultaneously. Very heavy. Sweet alcohol cider finish.

10099,9086,Drinking_Mantis,2.9,"the 90min IPA tastes so much better than the 60min that I assumed the 120min would be amazing. perhaps I have an unrefined pallet, but it tastes like a poorly made overly alcoholic mixed drink I would have made in college circa 2006. worth a try but I won't be having this ever again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,ReverendSoup,4.1,"Got a couple of bottles of this as an x-mas gift. Bottle's a year or two old, this is the 2021 release. Poured into pint glass. Pours a dark, rich copper tone. The short off-white head dissipates quickly, but leaves a nice ring and dense lacing. Smells a little like apple cider. I take a sip. Malt! Malt, and it's punching me in the face. Much maltier than it is hoppy- a logical progression from the 90 Minute IPA, which holds the two in balance. I wasn't sure I liked it until I kept drinking and decided I definitely do. Very sweet. Brings a caramel apple to mind, and then you get piney notes on the back end to remind you you're drinking an IPA. A little alcoholic, which works here. I wouldn't mind it being more bitter. Perfectly carbonated with a full body. It's a strange IPA. A prior reviewer said it reminded them of a barleywine, which does track. Another reviewer said it's not an IPA, and I'm not sure I'm equipped to argue with them. I'm not sure what it is, though, other than Very Good. While I do appreciate a beer that is what it says it is, I can also respect a beer that dares to push limits, especially when it's this good.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,atigerlife,4.18,"First, this bottle is very old. Not sure how old, but could possibly be around a dozen years old. Still have another bottle. So, with that preface...  Pours a dark copper, like dark apple cider. Opaque. Small brown head that dissipated quickly leaving a collar.  Aroma of malt, dark fruit, mild alcohol, dark sugar, spice and somewhat herbal.  Taste is dark fruit, alcohol [but not overpowering], apples, prunes, caramel, bread, bitter orange, dates and pine.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied and cleansing. Nicely smooth in the mouth.  Overall, very interesting. Hides the alcohol well and rather complex flavor notes.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,pulse,4.28,"As per plan, this is the Xmas celebration beer, the last holdout from the Extreme box, bottled on 9/13/19. A little over three years old, it pours a deep coppery color into the tulip with lots of head that fades off rapidly into a partial top cloud and ring. It has a sweet, syrupy, and malty smell. It does taste sweet, more sweet than bitter. The bitterness is slighty, lingering around a slight alcohol taste. I think it's like butterscotch and caramel up front. It's a little fruity, definitely along the barleywine track. Fairly thick, syrupy, easy to drink but warming. Moderately carbonated and somewhat dry. Very interesting.  I would love to do a vertical taste test. The last time I had this was in... 2019! At a tasting event that also served Utopias. It's powerful. I'm really out of the race at this point.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,FRANKHAZE,1,"This is in no way an ""ipa"". It's false advertisement and a horrible beer product for $11-12 per bottle. It's all hype/gimmick. It's not satisfying at all. It's over the top in the worst way. Should be discontinued.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,jmvogel512,4.73,The 2022 version is the best iteration of this beer that I've had. The hops and malt are in perfect balance for an imperial IPA.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,JohnniEMc,4.15,"There is no rational reason to have more than one of these per occasion. So, one brown twelve ounce bottle has been emptied into a clear pint glass. Almost no head was produced and it vanished almost instantaneously. Forget about the head, because the brew is beautiful, anyway. It's bright copper-amber and it's on the translucent side. Malt is the predominant smell, with hints of alcohol and hops. Of course, there's an alcoholic aspect to the taste that's too big to ignore. After all, the ABV here is an incredible 18 percent. Considering that, this tastes so much better than some that are less potent, but taste like a shot of whisky was dropped into the beer. This is malty in the Scottish Ale way, sweetly and with a kick. The hops are there for some counterbalance and they add an enjoyable extra layer of taste. But, this is malt and alcohol driven. It's good for what it is, an attempt at making an incredibly high ABV brew that tastes good. To that point, this is a success, for others in this range almost never taste this good. But for most beer drinkers, even those that can enjoy an Imperial IPA or stout in the 8-10% ABV range, this is a little much. There reaches a point when this much alcohol reduces the beer drinking experience and this might be it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,justbran,5,"This review is for the 2022 release.  Best beer I have tried in a long, long time. Absolutely fantastic.  So much flavor but not overpowering, wonderfully balanced. Hard to believe it's over 16%",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,DrOfGolf,4,"Poured from the bottle into a clear chalice-like glassware. Dark amber color. Aromas of caramel, malt, booze, and vanilla. Definitely a strong feel of the alcohol, but it doesn't overwhelm.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,cjeep,3.79,Yah unfortunately I have to say it’s a bit silly. Just too much. Worth a try to see if it works for you but in the end not for me.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,SoupKitchenBeerSnob,3.7,"Been wanting to try this beer out for a long time now and finally came across it at a local liquor store that sells a wide range of craft beers from all over. The store owner said that he was sent two cases of it. So anyway, I pay $40 (!) for a 4-pack and rush home to put a bottle in the freezer… First off, it looks fantastic. Pours a deep copper color with good lacing on the glass. The smell was a little surprising though; seemed very malt-forward, like a good beer that had sat in an unconditioned garage for a couple of years and the hops had been burned out of it (yes, I’m familiar with such scenarios; when you have wildly varying temperature changes of 20 degrees in the winter and 110 in the summer, that ugliness can play havoc on an unprotected beer. Welcome to NW Florida). The taste was unexpected as well. I thought some serious hop action was on the way but said hops seemed nonexistent. I typically don’t care for hop heavy beers but hey, a balance would be nice. And strong? Yeah, you could say that. You can almost feel the alcoholic vapor rising up out of your chest. I couldn’t find an ABV anywhere, although BA says it’s in the 18-20% range and that seems about right. So bottom line, this is a serious beer that demands attention. Is it all that I expected? Not so much. A good barley wine maybe. Don’t get me wrong, I like this brew, but I guess the hype just left me wanting a little bit more. Still, I feel comfortable giving it a solid 4 out of 5.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Eddieeight,4.57,"My father in law gave me a $50 bill to spend on some fancy beer, so this is what I chose. I saw the 4 pack sitting on the shelf for $42 and knew right away that's how I'd spend the money. I've had the 60 minute and 90 minute as everyday drinkers at my local bars on Saturday nights out, but never thought too much about them. But I knew given this beer's reputation I had to try it eventually. Poured out pure gold, richly golden, glowing with a copper luminescence, but it's murky and dense, and cannot be seen through. A beautiful white head formed that dissipated into a mess of mismatched bubbles around the rim of the glass. The smell is all orange and lemon zest, perhaps some grapefruit in there too. No alcohol on the nose. The taste is richly citrus and a full strong wash of hops, bittering and balancing the sweetness of the fruits. Hints of grass and wheat, and a golden touch of honey complete the sphere of flavor. The beer bounces around in my mouth in a lively brew of bubbles, and is quite thin and watery that goes down quickly and easily. I cannot detect the astoundingly high ABV that is present in this beer. This tastes rich and full, but not any more strong than what i remember the 90 minute to be. Overall, this is quite refreshing and lively, thirst quenching and smile inducing. It's not particularly unique, but i don't think it has to be to earn higher marks from me. I'm in Florida and in this heat this is the perfect summertime brew and I'm glad I'm drinking it on vacation. I noticed several reviewers are comparing this to a barleywine, and I would agree on that point. Two thumbs up.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

10099,9086,RyanK252,4.04,"2022 Bottle poured into a Founders Brewing Co snifter  A: Pours golden copper amber with a frothy cream white head that settles to a light layer and leaves a little thin lacing.  S: Sweet bready malt, big honey, citrus, floral notes, dark and stone fruit, some spice, resinous pine, and a bit of alcohol that gets stronger as it warms.  T: Candied citrus, orange marmalade, lemon, and grapefruit, resinous pine, spice, underlying fruity notes, apricot, peach, fig, white grape, and golden raisin, bready malt, brown sugar and honey sweetness, and a little alcohol.  M: Full body, moderate carbonation, slightly syrupy, definitely a little alcohol warmth, though it's pretty well managed and never really gets unpleasant or overwhelming.  O: Another beer I know I've had before, but never logged, so here we go with a fresh bottle to establish a baseline before cracking into a vintage bottle.  Fresh, it's an absolute behemoth. The 2022 edition sits at 16.6%, so not the full 18-20% of old, but still plenty big. There is a hop presence so there's no denying it's an IPA, but there's also a ton of sweet malt there as is required to hit that ABV. Well made and fun to try fresh to say you've had it (Go for a short pour or share a bottle with a buddy), but if you're after a big and hoppy experience, stick to DIPAs and TIPAs.

Taste follows the nose with a blast of rich malts, strong piney hops, with some notes of raisins, dates, caramel, molasses, maple syrup, Even at 4 years old - this is still extremely hot. it warms up the pit of your stomach as you sip on it.  Feel is thick, syrupy, warming and smooth. Moderate carbonation. Semi-dry, trending dry on the finish.  Overall this is a unique beer that is a must try, even if it is not one to drink often.

Live music, BBQ, tackle basketball, etc. It would get to about 10 PM and everybody was feeling right. Then my friend Daniel would show up with a jug of Wild Turkey and everything went to shit. So nowadays, I be sitting with my beer buds (or beer and buds as it were, having lain down liquor 16 years ago) and long about 10:00, I’ll whip out a couple of 120’s and split ‘em up in tasters, pass ‘em around. Cheers! Everybody gets goosebumps, cheeks turn red, and they make ‘that face’. (I truly mean that in the most complimentary way.)  120 Minute IPA is an Extreme Novelty that always satisfies. Sweet and hoppy, boozy and offputting, lowbrow and dispicable - yet the most underrated beer in America. It’s a nipple pinch - whether you like it or not, you know you got pinched.

10099,9086,Perioddicals,4.48,"L - Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Dogfish Head Signature Glass (snifter) at 60 - 65 degrees. One finger off-white head on aggressive pour. Opaque medium honey color. Inclusions present when held up to bright light. Good lacing and has alcohol legs. With a swirl/agitation mid-way through drinking, the head returns and fades to a thin foamy layering with lacing and alcohol legs returning.  S - Light hops of a floral and citrus nature. Sweetness from a molasses. A little bready/biscuit scent mid-way through drinking it.  T - Very complex. Malt and Molasses comes up front and the hops are in the back on the finish. Light bitterness on the finish. Minor caramel hints in there. Overall low bitterness and flavors mask the higher alcohol. Very surprised with the complexity and balance of flavors causing each taste to find something a little different. As with most high alcohol beers, the alcohol becomes more present as you drink and the beer warms up.  F - Mild carbonation. Very smooth to drink. Slightly crisp finish.  O - Overall this is a top notch beer. Perfect for planning your evening around drinking just one. The complexity in the flavors have me guessing whether I’m going to get more malts or more hops with each sip.

Fist sip is heavy on the alcohol. It’s sweet from the alcohol content but then there’s the typical piney resiny flavors you expect from a Dogfish IPA. But mostly this one is dominated by the alcohol flavor.  Feel is kind of heavy and also dominated by the alcohol flavor. Not a ton of carbonation.

The potency of this brew is itself very attractive to me, because it puts me exactly where I want to be in one shot.  The booziness is very present and it's very hop-forward, but I consider this to be a surprisingly well-balanced beer. The secret is a very sweet malt. Some might not appreciate the aggressive flavor, but it really suits me. You're entering YMMV country here. If you're willing to scour the hills and shell out cash for an utterly uncompromising beer, then you'll enjoy the 'hundred-twenty, but others will balk.

10099,9086,Beginner2,4.1,"I recognize that I am late to this party; having 15 from Dogfish, but having avoided the 120 Minutes... being a malt-head. But, what was I worrying about ?  What brought me here was that 120 is on BA's Beers of Fame. And while I had closed in on 2/3 of the Fames, I avoided the easy hoppy hits... and 120 is among them. So after I got a copy that was bottled two years ago, I cellared it until I was mature enough to appreciate better what it is that the hopheads want. I'm not sure I am truly more mature and still do not know what hopheads want, but now was the time to start. I popped its famous top. But first, a comment on what hot water does.  120 Minutes is a long time to boil anything. From a culinary perspective, remember it is a long 10 minutes for fettuccine (which depends on the sauce) and 8 minutes to hard-boil an egg (one of the most nutritiously intense things you can eat.) So if you boil something 120 minutes, you better be producing something special.  And of course, Dogfish did. 120 Looks like not IIPA I can remember seeing, a beautiful amber. The Smells, Tastes and Feel all are integrated by a dedication to using hops to balance malt.  Despite this being my 16th Dogfish, I suspect I've never done them a micro-review... now into its second year of ownership by Boston Beer, the Big Popi of the craft beer movement. How that plays out will mostly be for the Good. For as a purchase, Dogfish understand brewing's depth. Dogfish is active in all three traditions (probably excelling in two.) It has combined brewing with thoughtful kitchen menus for 25 years and it built a 15 room Inn (brining in the British tradition.) And then, it opened a second shop in Miami, tourism central, just to prove its point.  All that said, I think that only a few second generation crafters (20th Century) are as visionary as Dogfish and, when the final analysis is done, Dogfish may be second to none. A good purchase by Boston. Cheers !",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

There's a mild alcohol flavor present throughout.  Mouthfeel: Full and smooth, with decently high carbonation.  Overall: This is definitely a beer that's worth aging.

Hint of fermentation on the nose that dissipated as it was allowed to breathe. At 44 F a creamy mouthfeel initially with a hint of carbonation - a tad boozy. Complex flavor cocoa and toffee, caramel and roasted coffee. Swallows sweet mixed with a hint of bitterness on the finish. The second bottle drank easier than the first.

10099,9086,harrypowers,4.34,"An employee at the store I got my bottle from said that my bottle was at least two years old. I can't find any born on date on the bottle to verify this. >>>>> Found it. Born Nov 2017.  My bottle poured a turbid mahogany color with a small tan head.  Smells of raisins and dank hops. Tastes of brown sugar, raisins with a mildly bitter hop and a verrry boozy warm finish.  Full body with light carbonation. Lush syrupy mouthfeel.  A couple of years ago I had this on draft. That pour had to have been fresher. I wish I had perfect recall. I feel this bottle was more caramelized and less hoppy than the draft.  Beer compared to this brew is like wine compared to Port.

10099,9086,chum_husk,2.11,"12oz bottle. Like $10  Chunky, unfiltered, beautifull (sp). ""Whole and Plenty"". Smells like honey moonshine and hops. Hot alcohol on the exhale, I feel like I'm sipping whisky. Very, very sweet on the tongue, an almost unbearable sweetness, the sweetness of rot or death, the deathly mixture of loads of honey malt and ~20% alcohol. It's almost like a poorly-done mead, it's soo sweet with tons of alcohol burn.. I aged this a couple months, bought it new. There's no way the hops faded *that* much. If I am drinking this as intended (I assume I am), then it is a weird white wine malt-bomb - not at all what I was expecting from a beer with such prestige.  One-note white wine hops over tons of honey malt. As a black-and-tan with World Wide Stout: very interesting 20% b&t that mellows out the white wine funk and turns into more of a beer than an abomination",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

10099,9086,jpmarrero897,5,"This was my favorite imperial IPA thus far and one of my top 10 beers of 400+. The 4-pack I bought was actually from 09/19 so it has been aging for just over a year and was a birthday present to myself!  It pours fairly dark which I had heard about and did not have much of a head to it. Almost reminded me of pouring myself a glass of Black Label to a degree. The smell is wonderful with a very clear aroma of alcohol to it yet floral at the same time - superb to say the least! I found the taste to be reminiscent of an orange peel with a little bit of a peppery bite towards the end but, not over powering whatsoever. It was rather thick and syrupy which surprised me a lot, and I enjoyed that substantially!  Overall, hands down one of those beers that I will absolutely buy again should I see it in store/have the money for it. The price is a little daunting (similarly to the WWS which I had recently), but it is every bit worth it in my honest opinion. I wonder what it would have tasted like had I tried it fresh...

There is a nice lingering hoppy end note that stays on for a while, but the initial sip is just alright. If only the whole beer tasted like the finish. i really dislike the raisin note in any drink and that has this going on so it's held back. It's definitely nice and unique, would be really cool in a tasting, but it's too sweet, a bit unbalanced and too expensive for me. Maybe I would prefer a younger version, with more aggressive hops? I'm not sure.. the raisiness is interesting and unique compared to other old, aged beers I've had so that's cool if you're into that but i see it moreso as a flaw.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

10099,9086,Rug,4.48,"Bottled 6/29/20, about as fresh as anyone has these I presume  Well, here it is. I know it’s not all that rare, but it’s a whale for me, and the last of the DFH “Minute” IPAs for me to try. I found a 4 pack of this and also grabbed an extra single so I can lay some down in the cellar  Pours a murky burnt orange with a small cap of off white head that fades to a ring and leaves decent lacing and legs  A well balanced aroma brings notes of sweet orange, earthy cinnamon, herbal hops, lemon rind, and brown sugar. Way more malt than hops, it smells very rich and caramel like, not unlike an aged 90 Minute  The beginning of the sip brings notes of sweet sherry, caramel, and overripe grapefruit. Mid palate, the focus shifts more towards the caustic side of things, with a mix of grapefruit rind, pine, caramel malts, and fairly strong alcohol (duh). The aftertaste is very long, with lingering notes of brown sugar, alcohol, and orange  This does not drink like 18% at all. I get the the abv is variable, and the exact for this vintage is unknown, but it drinks closer to 8% than 18%. A chewy medium body with nice peppy carbonation leads to a full and smooth drink that finishes sticky and sweet  Dogfish Head is all about pushing boundaries, and that is precisely what they did here. No IPA should be this size, this malty, or this flavorful. Yet, they pull it off flawlessly. Well done, I can’t wait to revisit this at 2, 3, 5, and 10 years and see how it develops. Cheers BA, I loved this  EDIT 11/6/21  So Half Time in Mamaroneck had a 2015 vintage of this for growler fills that I picked up yesterday. I'm jumping the gun on seeing how it progresses over time, but I couldn't pass up the opportunity on this one. On the pour, it's much more alive in the glass, with the head growing as I let it sit. Strange. Some more lacing too. The age shows in aroma, but the hop presence is still huge, a nice balance of herbal hops, toasted grain, pithy grapefruit, and sweet sherry. In taste, the hops have faded a bit more, really letting the caramel shine up front, though with some white pepper. The swallow is sweet as ever and pretty much the same. I guess it just loses it's pithy bite and replaces it with a peppery one. Still the same in feel as well. It's really impressive how it hasn't changed a crazy amount in 6 years, but the change that has occurred is really nice. I would say it's not quite as good as fresh 120, but with a vastly improved appearance I bumped that rating up a bit",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,jwp777,4.82,"Today I purchased a 4 pack from my local liquor store. I saw it every time I went in there for the last 9 months or so, but I never went for it. (I hesitated to pay $40 for just four beers even though I know the reputation.) today, I figured given I just became a father and start a new job on Monday, why not. Treat yo-self or whatever.  Bottled on 02/22/18, tasted the first bottle today, 08/01/2020, making this almost 2.5 years old.  Pours a beautiful mahogany brown color. Head is off-white and disappears quickly, but does retain around the circumference of the glass.  Aroma - very sweet citrus (blood orange especially, maybe even persimmon?), but also lots of cinnamon and nutmeg. Near the end, the hops come in strong. The high ABV is obvious from the start.  Taste - wow. PERFECT balance of the citrus, hops, caramel, malts, and cinnamon. There’s something else there too that I think is brown sugar but I’m not positive. Finish is long and just as balanced as every other aspect. The booze hits the back of my throat near the end, but it honestly isn’t as strong as expected.  Feel is medium bodied, yet thick, with appropriate carbonation for what it is. Definitely a beer to sip, but it really is not heavy.  Overall - one day I hope to find myself at the brewery when it’s fresh so I can taste it that way, but this 2.5 year old bottle blew me away. I normally lack the discipline to age beers in my cellar, but for something this good, you can bet I will be aging the other three bottles and looking for this one when next released.

I can really taste the brown sugar, vanilla, and caramel, almost like a molasses sort of taste. Fruity hops taste really ripe in this, and add supplemental sweetness to the brown sugar and caramel.

Aroma comes off malt driven. Its a little catty, with notes of carmel and maybe cinnamon? Taste is interesting. Comes off like a full bodied beer, very malt forward, but I think you have to throw out your impression of the first sip. The more you drink it the more you pick up on the hop character and bitterness you expect from an IPA. Theres definitely a boozinees that carries throughout, and lingered a little longer than I prefer (hence why I rated mouthfeel a little lower) but if I'm being honest, knowing what the ABV is on this thing it's pretty amazing what flavors they were able to get to come through.

Caramel malt, bread, tropical fruit (papaya and mango) and some booze, but not as much as expected.  The brew is certainly a sipper. Strong caramel malts on the tip of the tongue, backed by overripe versions of the fruit on the nose--mango, papaya--and some strong booze. The hops ride in the back initially on this one, but they slowly grow and hammer with a vengeance at the finish, with cedar resin bitterness.

Aroma is an earthy blend of humidor cedar, caramel, pale brown sugar, sugary vanilla, pine resin and thin citrus hops swimming in alcohol booze but for an 18% ABV I might say it is reserved. Taste is sugary malt sweetness, fruity candied apple, cedar, resinous pine and thin citrus hops up front through mid-sip; it reaches full throttle hop dominance just before the finish. It is delightfully bitter in the aftertaste. Starts predominantly sweet before turning hoppy, finishing extremely hoppy and bitter. Alcohol prominent throughout and expressed as warmth, bitterness and spice.

Left behind are a few scattered, small spots of lacing. Aroma is alcohol soaked pine hops. Reminds me of a port wine. Apricot and pineapple. Sweet malts. Taste is strong with alcohol, and the mouth is quickly dried out with each sip. Good balance between the sweet malts and the bitter, piney hops. Leaves behind a booze soaked dried fruit flavor, such as from candied pineapple and apricot. Has a similarity to a barleywine mixed with port. Sticky mouth feel, with above medium weight. Has a continuous show of very tiny, rising bubbles, which then sink again and appear as tiny black particles (hops or yeast?). This is a very distinctive beer (going way beyond what ""regular"" beer is like), with lots of flavors and then the mouth is dried out with each sip. The mouth is numbed somewhat by the drinking experience, but the lingering high and sweet candy flavors never leave the mouth without a lingering taste.

Hints of orange marmalade T: Taste is sweet orange marmalade up front with some pine and citrus along with a strong caramel malt backbone. Slight oily hops with some earthy notes on top of the pine and citrus. Hints of toasted malts in the background as well. On the swallow there's more orange marmalade, caramel malt sweetness, hints of brown sugar, citrusy, piney, and earthy hops. M: This beer is full in body with a slightly syrupy feel on the palate. Carbonation is on the low end of things but adequate for the beer given the ABV while the beer has an oily hop finish that's a little drying due to the ABV. O: Overall this is a really interesting beer. I remember this being very abrasive when I had it fresh a few years ago but it mellows out well.

The shear bite of bitterness and booze is off putting for the more faint of heart but you are rewarded with a great back of palate hop and mellow delight.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,daliandragon,4.07,"This is a beer I have searched for for a decade. Finding it was anticlimactic: stucck in a mini cooler in an otherwise nondescript beer/wine shop in Germantown. Irony is life.  Pours a dark honey color with a tan head and no lace. The nose is sweet with malt and booze and lots of yeast. As expected, this texture is thick and syrupy but still not quite adequate to protect against the candied alcohol. There are hop notes but the boozy sweetness kind of swallows all the other flavors and subsumes them.  This reminds me of a barleywine or an old ale. A smoothish finish evens out some of the harshness. The aftertaste is big on notes of wood and vanilla. For what it is, an eighteen percent beer with complexity and some balance, this is an achievement. Whether or not it is really an IPA, even a double, is up for debate.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,akaizer,4.32,"Pouring out a bottle I got in 2017. Has a pretty minimal tan head with what can best be descried as a very opaque brown complexion. The scent is an impressively caramel scented sweetness with some sweet (alcohol) coming across compared to any hoppiness. Really a treat on the nose. The flavor is fantastically bold: rich, caramel maltiness with a touch of bitterness in the aftertaste that rounds it out. A robust experience if you let it linger in your mouth as the heaviness has a chance to fully realize itself. Definitely a beer to sip over time to fully appreciate.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,JohnFred4,4.58,"Review of a fresh bottle:  Look: pours thick and juicy looking but then mellows to an amber orange. lacing still present even 10 minutes later.  Smell: orange, mead, pine, tobacco. like honey that has been around for a long time, but hasn't gone bad.  taste: not as hoppy as you'd expect. there is definitely some alcohol heat there, but hey, it's 18%. orange, astringency, bitterness. not as good as i remember.  feel: hot on the tongue. almost as boozy as something like BCBS. would be interesting to see how it ages.  Overall: I was surprised by how much I didn't love this; I usually love everything from dogfish. i'll have to see how it ages.  Review of a 2 year old bottle (that I got for $1.50!)  Look: peach brown? Don't know how else to describe it.  Smell: Csndied orange, vanilla, wood, mint, lemon and lime zest  Taste: Despite it claiming to be super-hopped, I get almost exclusively malts. Sure, there's some piney, zesty citrus, but this is such an earthy, malty, brown-y beer. Vanilla, oak, wood, tamarind, ginger, earth, citrus zest, lemon.  Feel: I mean yes, it's super boozy, and syrupy, but what did you expect? It's not hot though.  Overall: Man, two years in the cellar does wonders for this. 3.75 new, 4.5 aged.

Hats off, DFH, it's a well made brew. I'm a BW guy but this is special. A cloudy rust with low/no head. No lace or much carb. Plenty of aroma of caramel with a hint of booze. This one is a mouth full. No heat, bitterness is still balancing the malt sweetness. Full long lasting finish but not cloying. I hope you get a nose full of an old one of these.

Clear darker amber with a nice dense head with great stamina (wang dang doodle all night long). The aroma is kinda' sharp almost fusel hop with a rich hop oil quality, that never crosses the line in excess (yah!). Not as complex or fruity as so many other, but for the hops of the time is this quite nice. The taste. Ahhh, the taste. Rich but not sweet. Solid malt backing contributes to the taste instead of vale to allow the hops to show. Nope rich combination and yet still a hop forward drink, no doubt. Alcohol has an appearance (rose water and a little perfume) but absolutely no burn. It's quite impressive really. Lovely finish. Very, very, very, very long laying on the tongue, and a good thing that, but too fast and this will hit good and hard. Pleasing with apparent but not excessive hop flavor, more than bitterness although there is some of that too, and it blends quite nicely. Lovely really. Body is not as big as expected, but smooth it is, with a bit of heat, and soft as hell with excellent feel from the carbonation. Impressive. Better than I expected.

Atomic tangerine body with a champagne cap, receding slowly to a fine collar and a modest archipelago in the center. Fine sandy lacing; leaded glass legs; decent retention for the ABV.  Sweet kettle caramelized maltiness in the nose along with some spicy/citrus/forest aromas from the hops. Some candy and white wine notes as well.  Sweet, bitter, and earthy with a deep pervasive maltiness reminiscent of an eisbock though not as dark/roasty. Peppery/grassy hop flavor, though the bitterness and alcohol wins out in the finish which is extremely long and never quite dry. Bears some resemblance to an American barleywine.  Alcohol is certainly present, though never dominant. With the viscous heavy body, this is almost like a carbonated hop cordial more than an ale.  I'm surprised that this isn't more abrasive from all the hopping, but it would make a wonderful winter warmer.

From the moment you pour it out of the bottle and inspect to that next moment up to your nose, and then the subsequent step of bringing it up to your lips, the whole thing just impresses and surprises one step after the other. A dark orange colored brew with weak foam but some lacing to mention gives way to a uniquely smelling IPA - what I consider and almost perfect blend between the juicy smell one expects and the bitter touch of those hops. Mouthfeel is cream - creamy I tell you! - and that's something I've never experienced with an IPA. And then there's the taste - as unique if not more so to the smell - lightly sweet, incredibly juicy, and at just the right amount of bitter flavor makes this superb.

I let it warm for a few minutes before drinking. What is there is leaving a lot of lacing on the glass as it moves down.  Smell is very heavy on citrus, especially blood orange and pineapple, doubling up on pine tree hoppiness and sweet malt as well. The alcohol is also prevalent, almost like a very sweet liqueur.  Tastes just like it smells. Very citrusy, I feel like I bit into a blood orange with that mix of bitter and sweet along with a lot of hop resin. Lots of alcohol, which becomes more forward as it warms in the glass.  Mouthfeel is oily and slick, the hop resin oilslick makes the high alcohol and big hop character easily drinkable and pleasant to sip. It does remind you of a barleywine.  Overall a very tasty Imperial IPA,. It is best shortly before it reaches room temp, as the warmer it gets, the more it enters hoppy barleywine territory. I paid $35/4-pk, and I'll likely let the remaining 3 age for years and compare against fresh bottles at those times.

It's just that the alcohol comes through and washes it all away.  Feel - Medium body and medium carbonation all checks out, but the sinus-clearing alcohol really roughs it up.

10099,9086,NeroFiddled,4.26,"Dogfish Head Craft Brewery ""120 Minute IPA"" 12 fl. oz. brown glass bottle, ""BOTTLED ON 02/22/18 1718"" $9.99 @ Total Wine & More, Cherry Hill, NJ  Notes via stream of consciousness: Well I haven't had one of these in a long time, years in fact. I don't really think of it as an IPA, although I won't argue that term, I just think of it as more of a barley wine, or at least a beer to sit down and relax with at the end of the day. Truth be told though, the last time I had one was at a pool party - BBQ and I still enjoyed that so... I don't know, you get the idea I think. It's quite hazy, even cloudy in the glass with a deep amber/orange body beneath a finger-thick head of creamy yellowed off-white. The head holds fairly well but it has dropped now and only a thin surface covering remains surrounded by a thicker collar and 'distant mountains' of lace rising along the rim. In the nose it's quite floral and malty. Some alcohol is in there as well, which isn't usually good, but it doesn't come off in a bad way. For a beer of 15-20% abv that's to be expected though; and I just happened to notice that that's no longer listed on the label. On to the flavor... there's a nice fruitiness to it, I assume both from yeast and the hops. I'm getting citrus including grapefruit and orange, and maybe a squirt of lemon, apple, pear, and dried orange. Maybe some other dried fruits as well. It remains floral and I wonder how much of that is from hops and how much is from alcohol. You can definitely taste the alcohol but it doesn't quite go over the edge and crash and burn at the bottom of a ravine. I've had better vintages that have had less alcohol, and more hops, but it's still OK. The malt has just a bit of caramel to it, which is nice, too much caramel would've weighted it down. It's sweetish and fruity, but there's also some solid bitterness to it, and the alcohol helps to cut through the malt and dry it out in the end so that it doesn't become too sweet or cloying. In the mouth it's full bodied and viscous, dextrinous but also cut by the alcohol, and modestly sharp due to that, coupled with a slightly less than median carbonation that allows it to have a slight edge and then become very soft and velvety smooth. It really is like a barley wine, an American barley wine, and I'm perfectly content to just slowly sip at it. It's not the best iteration that I've tried, and, in fact, it might be the worst, but I'm familiar enough that I can group the memories of those previous examples together with what's in front of me and come up with a composite score.

10099,9086,Ed3147,1.92,Typical over done beer. Way to high ABV. To strong of an alcohol taste. Not the selection if you are looking to drink “beer”. Actually poured it out after 1/2 the glass. If you are looking for a substitute for a mixed drink it’s a choice.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,patre_tim,4.13,"Deep copper with a little haze, a few sluggishly slow bubbles and 2 fingers of off white head. Looks syrupy.  Smells of candied malts like a barley wine. Light fruity qualities like melon and pears. Some alcohol and stinky foot.  A huge balance of sweet, malty, barley wine like alcohol, and fruity, citrusy, slightly piney hops.  Syrupy body with low to moderate carbonation. Certainly hides the ABV, so that I'd put it down to 10-12% if I didn't know better.  More hoppy than I'd expected, this was bottled on July 3rd 2018, drinking in Redding, CA, August 9th, 2018. Just over a month old. Worth a try as a beer to seek out.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,EMV,4.25,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a goblet  L: Nearly clear golden amber pour. 2 fingers of fluffy white head leave great lacing.  S: Sweet and boozy. Resinous pine and citrus hops.  T/F: Thick and sweet... toasty grains and alcohol (not surprising giving the hefty ABV). Bitter hop profile... so much so that it almost balances the ethanol. Fresh and citrusy... pine, resin, and dankness. Oily on the mouth... coating the tongue and warming on the way down. The finish is more sweet malt and citrus.  O: An outstanding and over-the-top kinda beer. Great flavor... complex and great for aging (I've had different vintages and they definitely change over time... becoming fuller/mellower with less bitterness... more like a big barleywine as they get older). A beer that only Dogfish Head could truly do justice to.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,QuadCitiesMike,4.3,"Tastes like a barrel-aged beer even though it isn’t. Excellent beer, but I can see it improving with a few more years of age. This beer was bottled in Feb 2018, so only 5 months old.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Scottsbeer,4.19,"This is a 2017 keg aged by the bar owner of McK's Tavern in Daytona Beach. I have had the beer fresh but this review is for an aged keg.  The look is a nice cloudy copper color with 1/2"" khaki head that dissapears quickly leaving nice lacing. The smell has slight hop, caramel and some alcohol. Taste starts with caramel malt and cane sugar followed by a little alcohol with some citrus and pine kicking in at the finish. The feel is nice with slight, fine, prickly carbonation, full bodied side of medium and an enjoyable warming from the ABV.  Overall a year in the walk in cooler changed this as would be expected. The hops have faded but the caramel and some sweetness has evolved. The mouth feel has gained some viscosity and the alcohol heat has faded. Still a sipper and pretty darn good.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,PicantePinguino,3.82,"How do you even rate something as unique as this? On the one hand I’m surprised and impressed by the enjoyable bright citruseyness that breaks through the thick 18.5% ABV cloud of this brew. On the other hand, the alcohol burn is very potent and absolutely demolishes any flavors here aside from those related to citrus. This is a fun after dinner drink to share with friends but not something I’d generally seek out over a more balanced option.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

10099,9086,dcotom,3.9,"Poured from 11.2-ounce bottle into a proper tulip glass. Bourbon colored body, with a finger or so of eggshell colored foam that settles without a trace. Aromas of spruce and pine resin, with undertones of caramel and orange peel. These are prominent on the palate as well, with a ton of alcohol burn. Well balanced. Drinks like a cordial, although there is not much sweetness to speak of. Not much bitterness, either, considering the vast number of hops that gave their lives to produce this.

It’s golden, beautiful, surprisingly complex and sweet. It’s going to knock you on your ass. For me, I only get cranky when my 120 is empty. I feel it’s really a Trippy beer experience...a party in your mouth. That said, you need a plan. One will make you very happy. Two on same day, you are not driving and probably a bit bent. Take on a 4 pack like I have more than a couple times and you are missing work the next day. I don’t care how bad you are...you are done. For the best experience, plan on one and what you will follow it with before your first sip. It’s such a great beer that it is so easy to build a happy 120 rave. That said, most don’t have that luxury or blind fortitude. Enjoy the ride. I love this beer.

10099,9086,lastconfederate2,4.11,"First of all, I was incredibly impressed with the head retention, which remained as I nursed this beer for 1 hr+. That's hard to do with a high gravity beer such as this one.  It was absolutely beautiful in the glass when poured - a dark orange.  The smell was what I would typically associate with an IPA - floral and fruity.  The first sip was laden with the alcohol this thing is packing, but surprisingly, that sensation went away after the first sip. It drinks like an IPA of about 8%  The other thing I was surprised by was the relative bitterness. This is billed as being 120 IBUs, far more than any other beer I've had, yet it didn't seem bitter to me at all. It seems like the bitterness was counteracted by malty sweetness.  This beer also had a ton of body to it and a very thick mouthfeel. Not an easy drinker in that regard.  The hop flavors were not as abundant as I'd hoped for a beer hopped continuously over 2 hours. The level of hops I was getting were similar to most IPAs I've had.  That being said, overall I though this was an excellent beer, though I don't think I'd go out of my way for it again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Iryan,4.39,"Whoa.  Completely opaque deep amber and comes out of the tap with a big head. Surprisingly subtle on the nose, hints of flowers but almost like smelling a gin.  You won’t be ready for the first taste. Nothing like an IPA at all- it drinks more like a spirit than a beer (the batch I had was marked at 16.8% ABV., so that’s not terribly surprising).  It’s rich and complex. It reminds me of if you took a field of wildflowers and distilled it down into a beer- Grassy, earthy, and floral.

My sense of smell is not the best but this wakes it right up with fabulous scents of sweet, bready malts and fruity, piney, spicy hops. Taste is truly superlative. Rich and complex, it holds its extreme alcohol beautifully with ferocious tones of lupulin, big big big malts and a strong peppery character. An IPA for the ages. I always keep several of these in my cellar and they do age beautifully.

Only issue for me is the much higher price at $37 for a 4 pack.

Small 1/2 finger head, dissipates quickly to a small ring. No lacing. Interesting because of the unique color.  Nose: alcohol is upfront. Citrus, orange, pine all present but dominated by the alcohol. Still pretty pleasant.  Taste: boozy, piney hops. A little citrus but, like the nose, the booze dominates. But, it’s pretty good booze. Plenty of hop bitterness as well. Surprisingly drinkable.  Mouthfeel: syrupy, rich, viscous, oily. Carbonation seems minimal but maybe masked by the booze. Its a mouthfull. I like it.  Overall: this is exceptionally strong, as expected. But surprisingly drinkable. The alcohol overwhelms the hops but, still unique and enjoyable. They say it ages well and I’m guessing that’s right.

It was super hot and felt like I was taking a shot with every sip. I stored away the second bottle not sure if I'd ever want to try it.  Fast forward to May 2018. The second bottle was now 2 years old. I chilled it and cracked it open this passed weekend. This was a whole different experience.

Amber in color with a thin white head and light/medium lacing. Smells a bit sour and boozy up front and then malty with what I think of as plum and apricot notes. First few sips taste sour up front but not after that. Faint piney finish and sweet. Buttery taste as well. Not too complex in flavor on my palate,just mostly boozy and buttery. The best part of this brew,for me,is the buttery feel that it also leaves on the tongue for a few seconds after swallowing. I would recommend spending your money on something else but maybe it needs to age for a while as the bottle says to enjoy now or in a decade.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

I'm currently sipping a 20 month old bottle and I disagree. I have a lot of sediment in mine, yeast maybe, just floating in the beer looking really unattractive.

This beer had a lot of the similar qualities that I love from the 90 minute IPA with deep orangish amber hue, and a malty raison smell with an obviously complex hop schedule. The taste definitely has a rum raison touch to the strong malt and hop character. This is a VERY drinkable beer given the ridiculously high ABV.

T: Mild booziness that lasts throughout. Moderately sweet up front due to all the malt used to get this to 18%. The sweetness is subdued fairly quickly by the hop flavor, and the hops dominate from there on.  F: It's surprisingly smooth until you get to the end, when the hops really ramp up and provide a nice little bite.

Aroma: sweet dark fruits and some alcohol  Taste: It's sweet, there's dark fruit and some citrus, and moderate piney hoppiness.

10099,9086,Steve_Studnuts,3.98,"Bottled on... OK, it's completely smudged, but there's an 18. Is that the year? I don't remember when I bought this.  Pours... wow, like no IPA I've ever seen. Just a shade below your typical barleywine. Deep, murky amber. Is it always this cloudy? I don't remember. Head is minimal but just kind of sits there, never fully dissolving. Smells rather like an American barleywine - honey, ridiculous levels of malt and a heaping fuck-ton of hops. Deep, resinous pine and grapefruit. Hides it's obscene ABV reasonably well. Drinks far too easy as well. Tastes as it smells, just with the sweetness amped way the hell up. Medium-bodied, soft mouthfeel. I like this a lot more than I did when I originally rated it.

Overall this is too extreme. I am not surprised that an almost 40 proof beer is a bit gnarly.Glad I bought only 2. This is not really an IPA in my opinion. Give me a tropical hop bomb at 8% any day over this.I think people enjoy this because it will get you wrecked. I only had two beers, honest. I love beer and don't get this. Like a beer flavored Liqueur. Lastly, why does DFH overload their malt so heavy. Cloying sweet syrup. I was expecting the mother of hop bombs and tasted thick nastiness. Revised: 3/19/18.

Getting some orange citrus mixed with plum, with not as much heat as I was expecting, though it is present. The 90 minute with some more punch.

10099,9086,aoampm,4.85,"12oz bottle poured into a snifter. No clue the bottle date or ABV. So I'll start this review off by saying I'm reviewing this more as a barleywine than a IPA. Onward!  Pours a dark amber color with less than a finger head that lingers on the ring of the glass. No lacing.  Smell is huge plum, toffee, brown sugar, glazed apple, pumpkin spice, and a vanilla chai. Smells like fall.  Taste is everything I want. A whisky soaked plum and apple, cinnamon, molasses, brown sugar, bitter dark fruit.  Feel is unreal. Thick and chewy likea bowl of bourbon plum oatmeal. Very little carbonation, drinks more like a bourbon or some other liquor.  Overall this is almost a perfect beer for me. I love barrel aged brews and damn it if this doesn't seem like a BA barleywine. But it's an IPA. I dunno. I'm buzzin. This sucker don't mess around!

10099,9086,Wrigfen,4.19,"I started drinking craft beer 4 1/2 years ago and in my part of the country this is the first time it has been available in this area since that time. The girl who owns the craft beer bar/store/resturant said she has not seen it in this area in 5 years. I am in the Charleston South Carolina area so craft beer is a big market. We are home to the world renowned Charleston Beer exchange. We have a multitude of craft beer only bars, craft beer stores and basically craft beer everywhere. So there is a lot of built in hype. I passed in having it on tap since they would limit me to one 10 ounce pour and opted for the bottle. There was no date on the bottle, but it looked new just based on the label (crisp fresh looking paper) but I have no idea when it was brewed. Anyway I am a huge IPA fan and favorably view Dogfish head products. The beer poured nicely with a very solid (can not see thru amber color). This just looked like it was full body. A nice small head and quality lacing on the glass during consumption. It is a vert different tasting IPA. Not hoppy, just very different and complex flavors, but it still tasted like an IPA to me more than anything else others have claimed. Definitely a most different IPA from anything else I tasted before. Can feel and taste the alcohol almost to a fault. Maybe the hype and not having this beer built my expectations up too much. I was a little disappointed in the taste, but not much and my disappointment may stem from lack of availibity (you always want what you can't get) . I imagined the beer of beers. Truth be told though it is a damn good tasting beer and you feel it trust me. Not up there with some of my all time favorites, but a beer I would drink again. I recommend people try it, you should enjoy it and yes you will feel the effects of the ABV. However, the price and lack of availability would not bring me charging back to it. Hey I don't due the fancy reviews, I taste something and I like it or not. Glad to have tried it. Not bad at all.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,VoxRationis,4.46,"Decanted from a 12 oz (355 ml) bottle into a conical pint glass; no production data, but appears to be the latest vintage. A: Pours a very hazy, amber-orange with clearing evident throughout. Leaves a half inch foamy head with modest retention, but strong lacing. S: Aromas of caramel, lemon, peach, cocoa, and pine. Complex and enjoyable. T: Sweet. Blood orange taste really struck me initially, but complex with flavors of caramel, sherry, and mead very evident. Strong, but exceptionally well balanced bitterness. M: Full bodied with excellent carbonation. Boozy, but I mean that in a good way. O: Color me impressed. Drinking this early clearly had its advantages based on the other comments (I refrained from reading them until I was done tasting). My pour was characterized by strong carbonation, head formation, and lacing, which evidently is not the case after aging. Not that aging will not add to the complexity. That said, even in its youth, this was a complex and really enjoyable example of the American DIPA style. Yes, it is at the level of a barley wine, so consider sharing it with a friend.

Appearance: Dark and murky brown with no head to speak of.  Aroma: Toffee and burnt sugar. Mainly a dank smelling beer. I am NOT a fan of the aroma at all. It just smells...old. Hopefully the taste makes up for it.  Taste/Mouthfeel: First impression its like chewing on a handful of raisins and then a brown sugar and maple sweetness comes up and is all evened out with a huge hit of bitter hops. A boozy beer for sure, but the sweetness and bitterness don't let the alcohol come through at all.  Overall: I definitely think this is a barleywine and not an IPA, but of course with 3 years in this it's going to be well beyond an semblance on an IPA.

If you go into this beer expecting an IPA you're going to be sorely disappointed.

Nose is boozy, raisins, maybe a touch of maple. Tastes more like a quad: molasses and raisins with a decently rounded mouthfeel. That gives way to a light alcohol burnt and thinness that make me wonders how long this should be aged?

No bubbles show, the beer could be solid. s) Fecund, fertile, ancient, dank. Hoppy, with set, spent floral character, and a candy store worth of malty sweetness. Hop bitter on the tail. t) Extremely hoppy, with strong bitter, tongue biting finish. Malty sweetness masks the hop parade (avalanche?) Alcohol masks the subtle flavors. This is a bear to age/hibernate at least a year before consuming. Ample sugars again mask the floral hop nuance. A sipper. A flawed monster. f) Smooth and wet, oily.

From reading the bottle I had braced myself for a blast of bitter hops but was instead met with a sweet maltiness, there were hops present but not quite enough to be considered the holy grail of hopheads IMO.

10099,9086,Holderness,3.67,"Only about four months of age on this bottle, so the flavors and aromas are likely sharper than they would be after a few years of aging.  L -- Pours a vivid, slightly hazed orange with a fairly small, cream-colored head produced with well-aerated pour. Minimal retention and some lacing, as to be expected with the high ABV. Looks really pleasing in a snifter. There is some sediment on the bottom of the bottle so make sure to decant when pouring! S -- Very boozy upfront, with strong notes of rubbing alcohol, bourbon, and barrel. Some sweet caramel malts and dank resinous hops in the background, but the aromas are really dominated by the booze... T -- Again, *very* boozy upfront with a hot sharpness that cuts through a lot of the other nuanced flavors going on here. I'm also picking up caramel malts, deeply herbal and piney hops, bourbon, and a hint of orange liqueur. F -- Big, boisterous mouthfeel that somehow remains crisp like most IPAs, despite the incredibly high ABV. The booziness is a little too sharp, however, and the malty sweetness borders on cloying. O -- This one might be a little too much for me.

10099,9086,JackRWatkins,3.9,"Staring at a chilled, full bottle, gotta admit, I'm mildy apprehensive about this one. Could it be that I'm a few (okay more than a few) beers in? Maybe. Could it be that this is a beast of a beer? More likely. Could it be that I'm afraid that this will be a boring hop bomb with no real depth and nothing new to offer??? Yeah that's kinda what it is, but fuck this. I'm going to review it anyway, because cool cat loves me.  A: pours a lovely, amber reddish orange, hazy with a quickly dissipating sheet of white foam that quickly becomes a ring, has pleasant lacing as well. In short, nice. S: sharp malt and earthy, resinous hop aroma abounds! Though I didn't really have to lean into this one to take a whiff, I did, because I'm nothing if not thorough. Clean and sticky pine note, what seems to be citrus (orange specifically). It immediately seems like (shocker, I know) a ramped up version of 90 minute. It's extremely peppery, and almost meaty. It does have those barleywine characteristics everyone mentions which totally makes sense. I feel like someone shoved my nose into a tree and I love it! Pungent and woody (maybe some bergamot)! T: Okay...drumroll...seems good so far...here goes nothin'...where the fuck are the hops??? It's bitter...a little, but my immediate impression is roasty, with a subtly warm alcohol bite. This is toasty, roasty, and, yes, I know, incredibly sweet. Unfortunately I don't see any date code on the bottle, but I find 90 minute to have more bite than this. Don't get me wrong, I'm not one of those guys obsessed over IBUs, they have their place, but this needs more to fit it's malt body. It is far too sweet. But, onward and upward. There is bergamot (orange), there is toastiness and roastiness, there is sweetness and there is woodiness, some berry notes as well. There is a delayed but warm alcohol finish, that is more like a liquor than even a fortified wine, like liquor specifically, which is fairly pleasant honestly. The more I drink this, the more it reminds me of earl grey tea, the bergamot really comes through. (side note: the alcohol is impressively well masked in this one) M: Sticky and incredibly full O: I'm not sure how old the bottle I have is unfortunately. I got it in NYC in the last two months. That being said, 120 IBUs my ass, either A) No, it's not, or B) it's not enough for the malt, but the only beer that I have had that was memorably sweeter than this was Cuvee Van De Keizer Blauw and it was borderline undrinkable. There's a good beer in here, the malt body is wonderfully built and the hops chosen seem to add a good character to the beer, but for me...first of all based on expectation, and second of all based on pure taste, this beer needed more bitterness to make it work. The sweetness here borders on cloying, and it's frustrating, because other than that, it's good, but if that were resolved, it would be great. In summation...ehh...I dunno. Reminds me of Samichlaus in that it is... ... ... ..disappointing. 3.9 as an avg is fucking generous. I love you Icarus, I mean, Dogfish head.

It smells very potent in an unusual way. Not straight hops, not straight booze, somewhere in the middle...  Taste is hops and loads more malts than expected. Very sugary and caramel-like. Definitely notice the booze but the other flavors are not hidden by it. Not overly hoppy. Slightly bitter but sweetness comes through more strongly.  Feel is heavy and syrupy. Creamy and thick, slightly cloying. Definite alcohol warming.  Overall an extremely unique beer. I have never had anything like it.

The other three bottles are mine.  Look - Almost a brownish golden hue with a minimal head. Carbonation is low. No lace or stick.  Smell - Wet catty hops and alcohol. Like there was virtually no attempt to hide the alcohol here. At all.  Taste - Only 18% you say? Tastes like rubbing alcohol with some cat piss mixed into the bunch from the hops used.  Feel - Thick and burning. Swallows rough and astringent.  Overall - Usually DFH makes some great beers. I always wanted to try this but the day my local craft shop received it a man came in and offered $350 for a single case in order to bypass the one bottle limit. What a fucking idiot. Glad this was given to me. Not quite sure what gimmick DFH is trying to pull but I've had TRIPAS near this ABV that were a thousand times better.

Whiskey burn fades into plain alcohol heat. This brew has way to much alcohol. Some citrus hops make it through the alcohol burn.  Full sticky mouthfeel with good carbonation.  Overall I couldn't get past the boozy smell and alcohol flavor. They bury the nose and the palate. I sense a good beer underneath. Just to much of a good thing.

10099,9086,Critofur,4.73,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle. I picked up one bottle when I saw it for the first time earlier this year, I liked it so much I picked up a couple more bottles - if not for how expensive it is, I would have eagerly bought a few cases!  I was surprised at how easy it was to drink this delicious beer, no burn*, just a little warming from the high % ABV! I was also pleasantly surprised that it did not taste overly bitter to me as the ""120 IBUs"" suggested. I found it very balanced for the style (""Imperial IPA"" or ""Triple IPA""). (* - When I say no burn, perhaps I mean no more than I would have wanted, and less than I expected, considering the strength of this beer!)  It reminds me a bit of Bell's Hopslam, it had a lovely aroma and slightly heavy (but very appropriately so) mouthfeel, moderate carbonation. I wish it hadn't been so long since I'd had it (a few months ago) because I can no longer accurately describe the aroma or taste but I do remember the ONLY thing I disliked about this beer was the price. I will review again next release so I can write some better descriptions.  I put 4.75 for the ""look"" because there was nothing about the appearance that distracted me from the other excellent qualities of the beer - I don't think the appearance could be improved for this type of beer nor do I think it's important, it simply looks like it should?",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Beersnake1,4.09,"Poured from fridge temp to tulip. Bottled in March of this year, so it's fresh. Pours a golden orange with minimal head. Quickly dissipates. Nose is citrus and hops. Not getting much alcohol heat on the hose. Taste is quite a punch in the face. I love the hops and alcohol heat, which is definitely present on the taste. To me, this is a classic strong American barleywine. Kind of an Old Guardian on steroids. There is a sweet syrupy taste which evolves into a dark fruit (cherry) flavor. Definitely some burn on the way down. Mouthfeel is nice, although not as thick as I would have expected. Overall, a really nice beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,HipCzech,4.3,"Serving: 12 oz bottle (""bottled on 03/30/17"") poured into a 9 oz Libbey Embassy snifter.  Appearance: Cloudy amber gold with a short but dense, frothy head of off white foam and sparse lacing.  Smell: Pine needles, citrus zest, candied orange rind and clean alcohol - almost gin in the aroma.  Taste: Big, malty body to balance the intense hops. Honey, pine resin and deep, herbal bitterness. Warm, almost numbing alcohol kicks in after a few sips.  Mouthfeel: Full, sticky, coating feel with moderate carbonation.  Overall: Intense and boozy, but still incredibly well balanced. Shows off the piney aspect of its hops amidst a potent brew for sipping.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Tampalocal5577,3.5,"12 oz bottle. Super thick and syrupy as it poured! Color was like a copper/amber. Good hop & malt balance. Hot and boozy slow sipper. Good for 2 people to split a bottle if you plan on drinking other stuff that day. It wasn't my bottle. If it was, I would have aged it at least 6 months to take the boozy edge off. Overall, for the asking price, it's a beer I would buy 1 or 2 bottles of, but not go crazy trying to stock.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Ozzylizard,3.58,"$ 33/four pack of 12 oz bottles ($ 0.687/oz) at Franklin Beer Co, Franklin, PA. Bottled 04/07/17, stored at 42 degrees, served at 42 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. Aroma – An almost oily smell of citrus peel and a little spruce. Head – large (Maximum 4.5 cm, aggressive pour), off white with a yellowish cast, medium density froth, above average retention time, diminishing to an uneven five to seven mm ring of tiny to average bubbles and a complete layer of varying thicknesses. Lacing – fair. Small pieces and drag marks of tiny bubbles. Body – amber, hazy. Flavor – moderately bitter and malty. Hops flavor is subdued and lacking distinct tendencies toward the usual descriptors of piney, floral, fruity, etc. The alcohol does not show in either the taste or aroma but makes its presence known in the slow gastric burn. Palate – medium, oily, soft carbonation.  Well. IMHO overpriced and over rated. The bottle states that it ages well. Maybe I’ll stick a couple away for a year or two then revisit. At this point in time I see no reason to buy more.  Appearance 3.75, Aroma 3.75, Flavor 3.5, Palate 3.5, Overall 3.5.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,DarkSideOfTheMoon,3.3,Just not a beer. I dont know what to say. It's basically like a concentrated beer. An ipa thats been left out in the sun for far too long. It's a shot of beer. I cant see how this would be enjoyable to drink.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Lone_Freighter,3.73,"I had this in a chalice. The appearance was a hazy orange to brown color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within less than a minute. There was barely any lacing but what was there trickled and slid right into the beer. The smell started off with booze making me think I should’ve waited on this Because of the amount of booze I got from this, it took me a good three hours to consume this. As it warms, there are some nice sweet citrus fruity malts along with a super light bitterness from the hops. The taste had a long dry sweet fruity and somewhat bitter flavoring running all about my taste buds. On the palate, it kinda wrecked my taste buds with the amount of booze knocking me back into my recliner. With one month of age on this, don’t try to reckon with this one, as it’s a sipper. Overall, though the booze was strong I’m probably still willing to have again but will most likely next time age it if I ever get that chance again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Lorgeous,4.68,"Deep rich thick copper color. Extremely appealing to the eyes. The smell is of light pine that is overwhelmed with a boozy aroma. The taste is deep and the best I can explain it is warm and caramaly. There is a lot going on. Every sip tastes somewhat different. It's thick, oily, rich, and beyond words. Not much hop taste but thick malt with a warm downing. Lots of sticky raisin leftovers. For a beer of this gravity it does go down effortlessly. Not much aftertaste which is surprising.  = When I heard my local store had these in I had to try it. My highest ABV beer I've had so far. It pleasantly surprised me. Try this if you ever get a chance and consider yourself a hophead. It's something that's almost indescribable.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Figured I would let this mellow for a bit.....Well that didn't work...hahah This is a boozy son of a gun....much prefer the 90 minute over this...kind of a malt bomb, but it is an experience....",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,hopflyer,2.63,"Bottled 3/30/17  Pours a murky dull orange with one finger head which recedes to a sparse film but ample collar  Smell is somewhat fruity, bubble gum, a little orange and booze.  First taste is hot with juicy fruit or fruit stripe bubble gum flavor. Subdued tanginess, light bitterness. A touch malt, caramel flavor.  Lower carbonation and medium bodied. Boozy for sure and bitterness is lasting along with the alcohol burn in back of the throat.  I kind of consider this a novelty beer. I don't think its very flavorful, just more boozy than anything. I won't be getting this one again. Yuck!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Brolo75,4.5,"12 ounce bottle poured into a snifter, bottled in 2017  A: Pours a amber, copper color with a white head that did not last, very little carbonation, slight lacing, slightly hazy.  A: Big hit of pine and resin that quickly fades into huge sweet, caramel, toffee, and vanilla malts, it's very aromatic but the hop notes are short, also picking up a good amount of alcohol, it seems like the aroma is breathing out of the glass.  T: Some pine and resin that quickly transitions into huge malt notes like caramel, toffee, vanilla, also picking up some rum like notes, it tastes like a lightly barrel aged barley wine. There's a moderate amount of bitterness, finish is semi-dry with lingering notes of malt, caramel, burnt brown sugar, toffee, vanilla. As the beer warms the alcohol gains some presence but it's not noticeable for such a high ABV.  M: Big, chewy, sticky mouthfeel, semi-dry on the palate, leaves that sticky caramel feeling on the roof of my mouth, low carbonation, drinks fairly smooth for such a big beer.  O: Not sure if I would call this a IIPA as the hop presence is lacking but it's there. The malt presence is huge but it adds a lot of depth and complexity, amazingly drinkable for such a high ABV. As the beer warms the slight hop presence fades and the malts gain more presence. Definitely a sipper. If you like IIPAs and barley wines then you must try this. Definitely worth the money at $10.99 a bottle.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,rickrem,3.92,"Deep gold in color with just slightly off white decent head. Good lacing all the way. Aroma and taste hit you like a rum soaked fruit cake. Crazy this is a double IPA. More like a Strong ale or barleywine. Not picking up the hoppiness you would expect.  Hits you with heavy 'booziness'. This would be better on a cold winter night in front of the fireplace. Nice viscous mouthfel with light to medium carbonation which fits.  Overall, not an everyday drinker, nor can you buy it everyday anyway. Big and tasty but a bit heavy.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Joe_Palooka,4.75,"This is a big beer. I was able to purchase four of these because I saw them sitting on the counter at one of my local liquor stores. I asked if they were for sale and yes they were for a cost of $10.99/each so I bought them all! The beer poured a one finger head but dissipated pretty quickly. There is no ABV listed on the bottle but the fact that the head disappeared immediately I am assuming it is quite high. On the nose I pick up some molasses and sweetness of malt. The hops and the ether taste is what catches my palate. This is a big beer and it is not for everyone. If this beer is indeed 18% ABV it is well hidden and drinkable. Could I drink it all day long? Hell no, but I could drink it daily. I am fortunate to have found it! I will age a few bottles and see how it is at a later date. This is a wheelhouse beer and if you can't handle a big, hoppy, high ABV beer you better leave this one for the folks that drink ""big boy beer""!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,WickedBeer,4.7,"Picked up at Green Jug Fine Wines in Woodland Hills, CA. 2017 bottle, 12oz.  Look: Pours a slightly hazy rust-colored orange, really nice hue. No foam, slight lacing. Smell: Toffee, fruit, hops, all balanced into an amazing smell. Definitely a lingering caramel aroma, with evident boozy smells as well. Taste: incredible sticky toffee comes back, balanced by notes of raisin and dark fruit. Clear bitterness that lingers in the back of your mouth. Warm heat, with a structure more like a barrel-aged saison. Either way, amazing beer. Feel: pretty heavy body, with low but even carbonation and a lingering stickiness. Really smooth for such a heavy hitter.  Amazing beer! So much more than I expected, with a a lot more to this beer than just overwhelming hoppiness. In fact, I found it taking a back seat to all the other flavors found in this beer. Amazing find from Dogfish Head! Highly recommended. Take your time with it!!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,edward_boumil,3.62,"This is definitely big. I wouldn't really call it an IPA, also its not overtly hoppy either. Bitterness is present but feels on the lower end of things, drinks sort of like a nice Brittish pale or ESB in regard to hops. In regard to malt, feels a lot like a German Bock, lots of dark fruit flavor and aroma, slightly caramel and toffee like.  Booze is up front and bold in this one. Actually in general pretty smooth and the ethanol heat you get meshes with the dark fruit, but there's no denying its present.  Overall this is pretty good. But its like running a marathon, you gotta get yourself psyched up for this one, easy drinking is certainly not a word that comes to mind here.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Antg8989,4.35,"Guess I already rated this a year and a half ago..and coincidentally (or not)..gave it the same exact rating. Well here we go.  Pours amber with a frothy cream head. Not much sticky lacing, but the lacing that falls is consistent with a beer crafted with excellence. Aroma is not at all typical of an Imperial IPA or IPA in general - it's actually raisiny and with dark crystal malts in the nose. Hop presence is difficult to determine, but if it's there, I would say it smells somewhat minty. Taste is of raisins and alcohol. It's a difficult one on the palate more so than the nose. While this is a bitter beer at 120 IBUs, it's a pleasant bitterness that doesn't leave my tongue curling. Feel is smooth, somewhat creamy and has a warming nature with medium carbonation. Overall, this is a beer of it's own - I guess technically it's considered a double IPA, but from a craft beer consumer's standpoint, this stands on its own.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,JohnTurano,4.33,After 5 months aging beer is much less bitter and has more of an alcohol flavor up front. 5 / 3.75 / 3.5 / 3.5 / 3.25 = 3.6 overall.  One year aged coming soon.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

A work buddy kept telling me how much better it would be and it was. So much mellower and the have alcohol taste was pretty much gone, nothing like the alcohol bomb of a fresh one.

10099,9086,IchLiebeBier,3.53,"Appearance: hazy orangish body with lots of floaties; small head, but long lasting and good lacing (high marks for the lacing)  Smell: malty sweetness with good hop aroma; much maltier than I expected; peculiar aroma in background, pleasant, maybe like a dried tropical fruit, but also a bit solventy.  Taste: very malty, syrupy sweetness with good hop bite, but not quite enough to balance it out, surprisingly. This is extremely sweet and cloying. It would be a great dessert beer. You could probably pour it over ice cream (or pancakes for that matter). But the flavor is good, so I'll give it a good mark.  Mouthfeel: syrupy and creamy. You can watch the beer slide back down the glass as you drink it.  Remarks: I bought this beer to share with a friend to say we had it. But he moved. I think this one IS best shared.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,EMH73,3.94,"I am rating this beer based upon it being at least 2 years old and properly cellared. Fresh this beer is a hot mess, in the worst way possible. I made the mistake of drinking it fresh once and it tastes primary of alcohol. As it ages the hops really come through ,there is a nice malty sweetness and it is quite unique, a real good sipper.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,eschaton,4.71,Wow. This is essentially a hop liqueur. I'm tempted to mix it with bourbon and an orange zest but it's just so damn good strait.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Shade1951,4.19,"This one is weird, but not in a bad way. As long as one doesn't expect a ""normal"" IPA.  Because of the super-high ABV, I knew I had to pour it emphatically to get any kind of head. Doing so yields a thin, light amber head that quickly dissipates in a wisp of foam floating at the top. The smell is pleasant - but not overpowering. To me, it doesn't smell as boozy as it is. There is hops, but it's actually more subdued. Very light citrus, almost no piny-ness to speak of.  The taste is where any divisiveness will really surface. Those expecting mouth-puckering tanginess because of the high hops content will be disappointed. The flavor borders on sweet. For 18%, I get very little alcohol burn in the mouth and throat. It is surprisingly smooth. Carbonation is moderate, and there is a bit of creaminess. This beer *might* possibly go well with certain desserts.  At the potency and price, this is not a beer to drink more than one of at a time, or even on the same day. It should be an occasional indulgence, unless one has bottomless pockets and a very high tolerance for alcohol.  It would be a great prank to pour one of these for an unsuspecting Bud drinker, except that it's such an over the top ale that the person would likely not drink more than an ounce of it. Too expensive to be used in a prank.  In fact, this beer is absurdly expensive. Is it worth the exceptionally high price? Probably not. Is it worth the occasional splurge for a bottle. Probably.  UPDATE: I've lost my taste for IPAs. But this is one I can still drink and enjoy. The hoppiness doesn't bother me because of the touch of sweetness. The ABV kicks butt. This is the only IPA I will buy anymore. But not often because of the extreme cost.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,TerryMills,3.5,Big malty double ipa type smell but the taste is something else completely..  Some hops flavor but mostly sweetness and a vodka type alcohol flavor come thru .

So very different I can't describe it. The hops have a new meaning. Easier drinking than I imagined. I will buy this one again when available. From a 12 ounce bottle at Ron's Corner Tavern. Thanks Jesse!! 5/2018 update. Finally got to try on draft. Seems a bit different, shall I say, FRESH! I know they age well and I think I can tell the difference now. The hop aroma is not as strong and it seems quite a bit boozier fresh on draft and not as smooth. It is still unique this way. Still the Holy Grail for hopheads, it brought me to the peak of hops and have become a true hophead myself. So many IPA’s. So little time.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

10099,9086,Harrison8,3.88,"Pours a clear amber with a finger of off-white head. Poured 3/4 of the bottle rather aggressively into the glass. Head retention is okay with a ring of white foam lingering for a long while. No lacing left behind. Aroma is hand sanitizer with little hints of citrus hops behind. Flavor profile is boozy, with huge notes of hand sanitizer cleaning and cleansing the tongue before anything else hits. Citrus, and orange hops add to it. Mouth feel is a little fizzy, with a medium thickness. Overall, this brew is loud - LOUD. It's heavy, with huge boozy notes. Not picking up much else behind that. Hops are boisterous to the point of drowning out any singular notes.  Served in a 12oz snifter from a bottle.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

10099,9086,jkblr,4.18,"12oz bottled 1/14/15 poured into a tulip glass at 55 degrees F. No ABV listed on bottle. The beer is reddish, copper color with tan head. Retention is good for a 28 month old beer and there is more lacing than I expected. There is quite a bit of sediment for a beer that's been in a refrigerator at 55 degrees, but I poured aggressively to produce a one inch head. Aroma is sweet caramel and a hint of booze. There is also some pine from what's left of the hops. The taste is sweet smooth malt and dark fruit at first, followed by piney bitterness on the backend. The mouthfeel is rich and full transitioning to bitterness and a moderate alcohol bite. Carbonation is still abundant. Overall, very good. I purchased this 2 years ago and intended to age it and drink as a barley wine. I may have jumped the gun by a year or two. I've had this fresh and it's too much for me (overwhelming bitterness).

To call it a TIPA is an offront to hops. This is an alcohol forward, non hoppy, non floral, non citrusy, sickly sweet (but not in a good way) mess. Congrats, bums would enjoy getting drunk on this, but it tastes like I imagine their piss would, alcoholic and awful tasting. I don't understand Dogfish Head at all, they make awful IPAs.

10099,9086,Lahey,4.58,"Look is almost amber with light head and no lacing.  Smell is honey caramel and orange, heavenly.  Taste is complex and changes over the first few sips as your palate adjusts. Honey, caramel, orange and light hops. This beer is more of a sweet alcohol bomb than a hop forward beer. You get the warm belly feeling from the alcohol:-)  Mouthfeel isn't too thick or oily for the amount of sugar and alcohol in it. Pretty much what you'd expect.  Overall a delicious beer. I wouldn't buy it all the time (if it was available constantly) but for once or twice a year, why not. Its a one and done style beer, so don't plan a long session around it. Just enjoy the interesting flavor and the story of how you found it:-) If you like this, try the implication by oddside ales (michigan brewer). Its a 13% ipa.  Edit: just tried it on tap and it's a little different from my memory of it bottled. More fruit than honey notes and more boozy than i remember.

M - heavy because of the alcohol burn. Alcohol very present. Think like if you were used to drinking redbreast and then took a shot of everclear. It's about the same difference going from 60 or 90 minute to this. Afertaste is general hop bitterness and sweet booze.

Some fruity stuff like mango & pineapple going on. Only drank half the bottle for fear of getting blasted, as it was not my first beverage of the day. Malt dominant. Stuff is not cheap, but once a year is fantastic. Had drank it a couple times before, and this was the best ever.

10099,9086,flaskman,4.05,The bottle I opened was 4 years old and I paid $20.00 at a charity event. My first thought was I just paid $20.00 and my second thought was it is a 4 year old IPA. Now tradition says an IPA needs to be had fresh. So I was not expecting much. Poured into a 12 ounce tulip glass at cellar temp. First impression - it smelled great. Darkish amberish that lets plenty of light through and it is cloudy. Good head that dissipated with no lacing. No idea of ABV but it can be described as a sweet well balanced old IPA with a pleasurable boozy taste that I enjoy. I never would had believed it was 4 years old. I love it. Time for a nap. It's a great beer.

10099,9086,ccaudill4,4.6,"I have tried this beer twice. The first time was a bottle that was a few days old, the second was a bottle that had been aged for 18 months. This review is for the second beer that was aged.  Look: Hazy orange with small off-white head that persists. Lacing is moderate. Smell: Toffee with a sweet booze undertone. Slight citrus scent as well. With aging the booze scent mellows out. Taste: Caramel/vanilla cream flavor followed quickly by a bit of an alcohol bite/burn. However, the alcohol taste is more refined than a fresh 120 and carries a gentle, slightly pleasant burn. Malt flavor comes through after swallowing and lingers on the tongue for a bit, but the booze taste can drown this out if you take too big of a sip. Feel: Very creamy and full-bodied. Possibly the best mouthfeel of a beer I've ever had. Carbonation is moderate. Overall: This beer is worth buying, but you should definitely age this beer for at least a year before drinking. An unaged 120 is harsh and the alcohol masks the subtle creamy flavors of this brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Mbbc,4.59,Side by side tasting of 2008 and 2016. The aged version was unbelievable. More viscosity and syrup like. Fresh beer was more floral.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,stickel87,4.95,"I'd say this is my hands down favorite beer. Some background on this review, only a few years ago I would only drink things like Coors Light, Rolling Rock, lighter beers, I enjoyed stouts as well, was the only unique beer I could drink, they had to be a non-coffee stout though, Guinness for example... I then moved on to a Cider kick and still do enjoy ciders especially anything from McKenzies. Then I saw this beer one night at a bar, had a buzz on and my buddy said he would give me a ride home and as a dumb drunk decision I chose the bars highest ABV beer they had.  And I was absolutely blown away by the taste, it didn't even taste like an IPA, this beer started my craving for all sorts of other IPAs and now I can drink American styled IPAs as long as they aren't super hoppy, this ""IPA"" as I like to describe it, is amazing, hands down my favorite beer.  It's hard to find but a local beer distributor near me is able to get it frequently now, $180 for a case, or I can wait in line with others in my local town for $150 cases at a different distributor. He will even hold one back for me since we have a mutual friend.  If you come across this beer, and it's not over $12, I HIGHLY recommend it, or if you haven't had them in awhile I would pay anywhere from $15-18 highly depending on location and how long it's been. My local distributor charges $36 for a FOUR pack, $180 for a case.  It's expensive BUT what I do as well, I buy a case, I drink 12 of them whenever I want to have one, and I am letting the others ferment in segments, 1 year, 2 year, 3 years, 4 years, 3 for each segment. I just started this journey of segmenting them but I am super stoked for November 12th 2017 for that 1 year mark for that 3 pack segment :-).",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

It may be a little one note for some but that not the point here. The point is to showcase hops like no other beer. I would drink this again and again and again. The high ABV is very tolerable and balanced but I recommend sharing with a friend - it's what god beers are made for anyway.  Update: Just cracked open a 1 year old aged version of this beer and all I can say is WOW. The little bit of aging just smoothed this beer out. It just reached another dimension for me.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Sophisticated, intermingling tropical fruits, earthen tones, and herbs do a phenomenal job of masking the potent ABV. You will know it's their without a doubt, but once you begin to acclimate it's rather inviting. It's not even comparable to the Dogfish Head 90 minute IPA.

Murky orange to light brown with a short 1/2 cm head which recedes very slowly. S. Big toffee and booze, more booze, then bitter citrus if get your nose in there, orange, lemon, grapefruit. T. Oh yeah. Big sweetness, big bitterness, nice balance on the first sip. Second sip has me thinking of cough medicine. Third sip is bitter orange marmalade. My taste buds need to get dialed in to these big flavors and abv. Toffee and citrus seem most prevalent. As it warms there's caramel, spicy and sweet lemon, orange, brandy-soaked caramel apple. Aftertaste is the same with a little mouthwash in there. F. Full mouthfeel, smooth, sticky. Warming but not really drying in the aftertaste. O. The high abv didn't ""burn,"" but had a flavor that was slightly off-putting, but a little age may change that. Would I buy a bottle again? Absolutely.

10099,9086,CopperMtnPlowboy,3.58,"Very hard to rate this beer. On this snowy winter night, I poured the 120 into a pint glass & let it breathe for 10 minutes. Very cloudy with a medium head which thinned out over the 10 minutes. The first sip was like a blinding shot of bourbon - lots of alcohol heat and malty burnt butterscotch. At this point, I'm thinking I wasted $11 on the bottle (well, ~$90 on the two 4-packs). Halfway through, it had a whole different feel, much smoother and tastier - the burnt taste turned to pleasant piney citrus. And I liked it. Definitely a beer you only of which you have one or two at a time, not one to pound at a party.

10099,9086,GOBLIN,3.77,"120 ipa . . . Been sitting on this bottle since 2012.  Gotta admit, this beer has a very lovely look to it. Appearance is deep candy colored burnt orange. Thin head if at all. Aromas are almost barleywine like with a subdued hoppy nose. Caramel, molasses, leather . . . I honestly wouldn't think much about the aromas if I thought this was a newly bottled ipa. However, I know this is 4 years old so I'll have to take that into consideration. Here we go . . . 2 quick small sips reveal a mature American barleywine flavor profile similar to Bigfoot or Old Stock. I actually think this beer is more reminiscent of an old ale than a barleywine which is what I was expecting. The hops are still present though not as dominant as though definitely were 4 years ago. Thin sweet, candy layers are upfront and a tangy alcohol finish on the end. Feel again is reminiscent of and old ale or American take on a barleywine. Sticky, thin, sugary and malty flavors and feel. This beer is hard to pin point on style and feel. I like this a lot . . . It's a big beer and not just because of the abv %. I'll be sipping this for the next hour at least. Overall, excellent beer . . . I personally wouldn't consider this an ipa but perhaps more of an American Barlywine or even an over the top example of an English Old Ale. In closing . . . . If you like complex beers and perhaps want to over think things (nothing wrong with that) grab a bottle of this.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

ABV  First time I saw this one and insta-purchased it. Had been wanting to try this despite not really thinking much of the 60 (3.45) and thinking the 90 (4.08) was just good. Probably would have paid up to $10 and locked it down at $8.50 for a 500-ml. pour. Hoping to be in the 4.20 range.  Poured a deep gold hazy color with 3-to-4 fingers of white frothy-to-rocky head when I got it. Was quite dark in there, but appeared to be light bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. World-class uneven foamy lacing. World-class retention. (Sight - 4.50)  Smelled kind of a lot of mush up front, More malty than hoppy, getting caramel, toffee, brown sugar, maple syrup, sappy pine and hints of Citra and Cascade. Smelled more like an American Strong Ale or an American Barleywine than I would have thought. (Smell - 4.00)  Taste follows the nose as more of a strong ale or a barleywine, getting toffee, caramel, earthy leather, maple syrup, brown sugar, sappy pine, dates, raisins and dark fruits. Not picking up any specific hops. Crazy smooth for 18 (or 16) percent. (Taste - 4.25)  Medium body. Sticky texture. Lively carbonation. Earthy finish. (Feel - 4.25)  Wow.

Smell: Tons of citrus and tropical fruit. Quite a bit of booze comes through. Malty and caramelly. Taste: A huge kick in the teeth with the first sip. Bitterness explodes. The bitterness is quickly overtaken by a shot of alcohol. The alcohol burn is bigger than expected. After the alcohol dissolve into your bloodstream, there is a brief taste of caramel, malt, bread, and yeast. Many different hop flavors take turns throughout (citrus, mango, pine, floral). Some fruit flavors linger behind after everything else fades. Feel: Medium but almost full. Feels pretty thick, oily, and slick. A bit under carbed, but understandable. Overall: Very powerful Imp IPA. Couldn't sit and drink a 4-pack of these though. More carbonation would be good. A slow sipper for sure.

Get the hoppy taste, but the taste of burnt sugar helps make the high IBU balance fantastic. As the beer sat and breathed for a bit, it has a more pronounced hoppy taste.

The taste is a massive sweetness from the caramel malt and alcohol. Also a substantial spicy heat from the high abv. Pine and resiny dankness follow the huge sweetness.

Immensely potent and immensely spicy, both from the hops and from the alcohol. The taste sticks to my palate and it's almost fatigued between sips that it's hard to recognize all I'm tasting.

When sipped, it fairly explodes with sweet malt, almost cloying, and bitter, biting hops. There is a strong alcohol burn. The sweetness and bitterness are at war with each other.

Sweetness first, bitterness from all the hopping, and alcohol burn come in turn and malts really can't hide that very well. Lots of oaky, bourbon, cognac, leathery type feeling. Really has aged very nicely and all the flavors are mellow and soft.  F: Full bodied, light carbonation, all drying done by ABV and there is a lot of tongue coating. Improved balance with aging, but the sweetness and alcohol burn still peak too high, I think. Well constructed.  O: Why is it not a barleywine? No idea.

The pour is beautiful, just a golden froth the color of OJ from the bottle. It forms into what I can only describe as Tropicana or fruit juice. Lots of reds, oranges, heck it even looks like a tomato beer. The head is 1 finger but diminishes very quickly to moss on top. 100% opaque, but sunlight gloriously illuminates the sides. A beautiful, stunning appearance.  Aromas of ocean tides, melon, papaya, dark skinned grape, prunes, raisin, a hint of burnt brown sugar, freshly uncapped barley in a barrel. It really is an amazing nose.  Holy shit. I mean holy, freaking, shit. Insane beer. Flavor just jumps out at you. Each sip is different. I'm getting figgy fruits (that is to say, dark...plum, prune, raisin), and bright fruits like cantaloupe, melon, and honeydew. An aggressive dry hopped character hits you in the face with what I imagine some high quality space dust would taste like from another planet. I'm also getting tomato soup notes, which sounds bad but isn't, and finishing off with a a vinous quality, wine casks, and bourbon barrel. And I just noticed it's 18%. whoops. If there were anything to improve on, it's that the alcohol comes out more as it warms and takes over the beer.  Feel is hot, smothering, creamy, yet intensely carbonated. Hot, dry finish.  Overall, I mean...what can you improve on this? Insanity in a bottle. The warmth makes it a bit medicinal and hard to swallow, but if this is what NE IPA's are like, count me the F in. This is awesome right here.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Aroma- Candied fruity sweetness, orange marmalade, lemon, sweet pineapple, apricots, and white grapes. Sweet breadiness, glazed fruitcake, honey, brown sugar. Some earthy pine and grapefruit. Boozy alcohol notes.  Taste- Sweet bready malts, caramel, honey, molasses. Candied orange, booze soaked raisins and dates, cherries, white wine grape. A touch of piney hop on the finish, woody earthiness, and warming alcohol notes.  Feel- Full bodied, very thick and syrupy, coats the mouth. Finishes slightly dryer due to alcohol notes. Lower carbonation.  Overall- Incredible sweetness, layers of bready malts and sugary sweet flavors. Hop character has faded back, just a touch of pine on the finish.

It definitely needs to age. I will revisit this review in a year or two when I open another.  Edit at two years: It's still sweet and sticky but it's much smoother and easier to drink.

Smell doesn't really knock my socks off like I expected. Somewhat understated compared to dank Midwest coastal style I prefer. I was expecting a huge resinous smack in the face, and this just didn't deliver that same wallop that some of the better DIPA's deliver. At first sip Initially I was impressed with the sweet malt, barleywine, backbone of this beer. But the longer this lingered on my palate, the medicinal, champagne like, notes overpowered those characteristics, sent this review sideways. I struggle to detect the more desirable hop characteristics I crave. I'm surprised at how underwhelmed I am with his beer, since I am a big fan of both the 60 and 90 minute DFH IPA releases. I guess I'm spoiled by the quality of breweries like Dogfish Head, Founders, Russian River, and the like. I shouldn't expect a smashing success with each years' release of a big name brew.

Dogfish Head?!I consider 60 minute to be a session beer, and 90 min to be a solid hour long sipper, and I imagined this would be like 90 minute, but with a flavor wallop. Instead, it just seemed like they poured some booze into a perfectly good 90 min.

It sounds like cola, showing a lot of promise, but disappears just as quickly, leaving only champagne like bubbles. The alcohol leaves some legs on the glass, like wine.  Smells like a full-on pine forest, with candy, caramel, and grapefruit combining in such a way I've not experienced before, all coming together as one. Graham and honey aromas surface as it warms, and then some cannabis, gasoline, juniper, tobasco, green apple, and wood. It's intriguing but kind of a hot mess.  Again, hot ass pine forest emerges first in flavor. Actually, it tastes more like a wild fire. Then, grapefruit-cherry cough syrup. This is extreme, but what else would you expect from this? Also got some toast, graham, grain, and corn.  At times, there is an unreal amount of froth on the palate for the style and ABV. But all in all, it is truly wine-like, even without aging. This is some really hot, fire-breath inducing booze.  ---  Since this review, I've had 4 and 3 year old cellared bottles. I noticed the heat did smooth out a bit, and the flavor got sweeter with raisin and a more prominent honey flavor, giving a sort of maple aftertaste.

Amazingly hard to get my hands on , don't think I'll bother with it in the future. It's like a wine cooler and a barley wine had kids out of wedlock.

The hops linger on the palate, seemingly forever. I will taste hops until the day I die.

10099,9086,MattinHouston,3.9,"Had this one special ordered and waited about a month to get a fresh 12oz. Honestly, they probably should not release this right after brewing after the 1 month of dry hopping. Has a very syrupy taste to it, sugar comes through more than an IPA hoppy taste. Probably needs more fermentation to convert that sugar to alcohol. Will let the other one I bought sit for some time. I am updating this after letting 1 sit a few more weeks. It needs at least ~2months at least to age before that 90m flavor comes into the brew, along with the IPA smell. Going to buy a couple more and let them sit longer. Just sip this one to bring out the flavor AND let this thing age a bit!!!  Update I am terrible when it comes to aging beer as I drink it too fast. I did just pickup a 2017 vintage and fresh it takes better than 2016. Still very syrupy no bitterness though that I prefer on a DIPA but that's Dogfish brewery for you.

The high alcohol content masks the maltiness and there is strong citrus-sweetness to the front end of the beer (I don't get the bitterness score for this beer), following by a strong burn of alcohol.

10099,9086,SerialTicker,4.13,"Fresh ass bottle... bottled 4/8, poured 5/4. I know, people say to age it or whatever, well I wanted to try it fresh. $12 for a 12oz bottle. My ""May the 4th be With You"" beer. Off we go.  Appearance: Who saw that coming? This is a hazy copper orange color with half a finger of a creamy head and a fair amount of lacing. I was anticipating a flat looking beer... this looks fantastic.  Smell: Intensely huge. Lots of alcohol, but also quite a bit of fruity hops with great malt sweetness. For some reason, all together, I actually get a slight maple syrup aroma out of this at times which I think is phenomenal... now that I'm thinking about it, maple syrup barrel aged IPA, anyone?  Taste/feel: Well, follows the nose. What a monster. The alcohol in one sense is really well hidden -- I don't think this is a very hot beer. It's not burning me going down. Also, I don't find that it dries my mouth up after every sip. However... there's a definite boozy taste, but that's to be expected at 18%. Pretty intense alcohol flavor up front fades with loads of fruity and tropical tasting hops with a surprisingly not overbearing amount of malt sweetness... I figured this would be super sweet, boozy, and hot, and it's not all that. The feel is syrupy in body, but there's a nice bit of lively carbonation to balance it out.  First sniff and taste I wasn't huge on this... but it has grown on me. This beer reminds me of Moltov Cocktail Heavy just in that it's the only triple IPA I've had at 18%. For me, Heavy is a slightly sweeter and definitely hotter beer with a little more flavor depth. 120 is actually a little bitter (or at least less sweet), but the flavors aren't quite as good.  120 is fabulous. It's definitely a beer that's maybe too intense for its own good, but that's the point of it. I know Dogfish says this ages well, but I don't know if I would bother doing that as it would just taste like sweet booze.. I enjoy the hop characteristics and everything that it is right now. If I had a handful of bottles, I'd try aging one, but to me, you're better off drinking this one fresh.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Small head dissipates pretty quickly but leaves a thin ring. No lacing.  Smell opens very piney although I wouldn't go as far as 'dank'. When that drifts away its left with a mostly alcohol/solvent smell.  Taste is very much like the smell, except the pine and fruity hops are buried and I just get a lot of alcohol burn. I tried it chilled and then let it warm, and either way it came off hot. Slightly more malts present when it warms, but they're fighting a losing battle with the 18% abv.  Feel is hard to judge, as another review stated, my mouth is basically numb and whatever feel it does have is not very enjoyable. Its medium body I guess and not as flat as I expected, but thats about as much as I can say.  Overall, this is a bummer. I know its kind of a novelty beer at 18%, but I was expecting it to be somewhat more beer-like... Wish I had my $10 back!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Whey2Hoppy,4.96,"A- Pours a clear amber color with a slightly tan, foamy head that dissipates quickly, leaving a fair amount of alcohol lacing on the glass.  S- Very sweet burnt sugar notes right up front, with some alcohol in the nose along with an array of roasted malts and hoppy pine smells. Liquid caramel, molasses, definitely not for those who don't like sweetness in their beers. The alcohol in this almost tastes like the bourbon you would get from barrel aging, which earns this beer massive points for me.  T- Follows the nose, with a huge punch of that burnt sugar sweetness and dried fruits, almost a syrupy kind of malt to the flavor with a definitive alcohol kick at the end. There's hop bitterness, but it's just enough to balance out the amazing amount of sweetness in this beer. Almost like a dessert in a glass, or a tasty, high end liqueur.  F- Full bodied and thick for an IPA, but you would expect that with an IPA of this strength.  O- Wow, this beer was simply amazing. This is my new favorite IPA of all time, and it was worth every penny I paid for it. This is one hyped beer that definitely lives up to the reputation for me.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,JKasten988,2.48,"Growing up in South Jersey, Dogfish Head was my introduction to craft beer. I've always been a fan of 60, 90, and chicory stout, but Sam Calagione's general attitude and approach to brewing has always driven me up a wall. Rather than putting forth ANY effort to craft a decent, nuanced beer, he makes novelties. I'd knock them for just trying to remain relevant, but it's always been their approach. ""I bet if I brew this beer to 55% abv, use an old board game to create a continuous hopping mechanism, and include an ingredient from every continent, History Channel will give me a show!""  This beer is pretty bad, and people give it decent ratings only because it's a novelty. Oh yeah, don't age it. Dogfish never really understood cellaring beer, and when they realized same, they peppered their website with nonsense like ""people may tell you that you shouldn't age fresh, hoppy ales, but remember, do what you love."" If you give this a full year in pitch black at cellar temps, it comes out tasting like the same beer but more astringent. A true disaster.  Look: Actually good. Incredible amount of legs on the thing because it's Port strength. 3.5  Smell: Alcohol. Incredibly astringent. There may even be a beer down there that wants to smell like something, but it can't. 2.25  Taste: Alcohol. Again, please note, there is a beer under there, and you may taste some fruity hops trying to punch through. This might entice you to let this beer age for a while, but don't be fooled. Those beer flavors are the first to go when this baby spends some time in a cellar. 2.5  Feel: I don't even know; my mouth is numb. I would guess 190 proof everclear mixed with orange juice, but I haven't touched that since high school, so I can't confirm. I think I'll say 2.25  Overall: Go away Dogfish. 2.5",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Flavor is absolute hop bomb. Almost tastes like I'm chewing a hop pellet, then washing it down with a beer. The good thing is I am a fan of really hoppy beers. Although I think it's a bit much, I can appreciate what went into this beer. Mostly piney/bitter flavor with a bit of citrus, followed up with sweet malty backbone and a boozy heat.

I'm also a Scotch drinker so I'm used to prominent alcohol on the nose but here there's not much after the alcohol dissipates. Taste: again some citrus fruit but there mostly a dominant sweetness to it that is followed immediately by a bitter finish and the alcohol level is out of control here. The best way I can describe it would be to say that it taste like burned sugar with a spoonful of cointreau. Right now the 2016 it is just not a very pleasant beer to drink.

The head is off white, which was more apparently initially. It's not exactly bursting with aroma. I feel like all I get is rubbing alcohol. Despite it being listed as having 120 IBUs, this is incredible sweet. It is very boozy too. It's not undrinkable, but not exactly something you can throw down. I am not surprised that aging is recommended. This is a beer with minimum refinement. Calling this would be a barleywine would be kind with this amount of bitter hop character.

It was legendary before I had the opportunity to sip, and it really tastes more or less like I would expect it to: the alcohol of a rich red wine, the balanced malt-and-hop-bitterness of the 90 minute IPA, but highly refined. The only strike against this beer is that it is so refined as to be unbeerlike in nearly every way.  Had a Westmalle Tripel after this, and actually think that was better, despite love-love-loving IPAs and Dogfish Head.  Still, not complaining one bit. This was a once in a lifetime opportunity, and I savored every drop of it.

10099,9086,thepenguin,4.3,"L: Pours a very pretty burnt orange color a good deal of haze and a tight white head. Minor suspended sediment. Superb head retention and lacing. Really a beautiful looking beer.  S: Smells like Bigfoot on steroids. Tightknit caramel and bready malt, piney resinous hops, and a certain toastiness. Pretty sweet but in a hop-forward American barleywine sort of way. Not nearly as much booze as you’d expect for such a big beer.  T: What a massively flavorful beer! Big caramel sweetness and doughy bread crusts, with piney high alpha-acid hops. Some orange zest citrus in there. A good deal more ethanol than the aroma lets on. Rich, boozy, bready sweet finish with loads of classic American hop flavors. Grassy hops flavors take over very late in the finish.  F: Full-bodied with creamy carbonation and an all-around lush and sticky mouthfeel. Quite hot – almost as if drinking spirits – but what the hell do you expect at 15-20% abv?  Thoughts: More of an American Barleywine than a DIPA. Pretty damn good for such a big beer. I don’t usually like my DIPAs to too high up there but I liked this better and found it more drinkable than the vast majority of 10+% abv stouts. This beer is not for everybody by any stretch and it’s no surprise that few other breweries have tried to replicate this style, but it’s a classic for a reason.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

10099,9086,Chris_Huston,3.68,"This is my second one, and unlike the first that I drank right away, this one has been sitting for a few months, so one would think it had, if anything, mellowed, but it seems boozier. The pour is a nice moderate head, without being rambunctious or timid. The color is a dark, cloudy amber that is appealing but not astounding.  One of the unique characteristics is that it offers something fine both cold and warm, which is different than how I remember my first, which seemed to only come alive when it warmed. Whereas many beers just don't let the flavor through when they're below 50 degrees, IMO, this one has a nice mellow, moderately malty and crisp IPA vibe, with that refreshing temp. Warmer, it adds body and starts accentuating more of the beer's malty and restrained but clear hoppy flavors.  I don't like it as much as I remember, but as I'm not at all an IPA fan, this is still one of the few that I think is worth drinking. Beware the ABV, though. Preferably drink at home and over the entire course of the evening. If nothing else, to get the progression from its colder experience to room temp. I think I might prefer the 90 minute, though.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

This is what I would imagine a hop wine to taste like. The aging (according to my friend who tried it when fresh) seemed to have made it much more palatable.

Taste: Molasses, toffee, brown sugar, cashews, cherries, figs, prunes, raisins, brandy/cognac/port wine, red wine, and vanilla. The hops take a backseat to the insanely complex malts but there is some faint grapefruit, orange, and grass. There is some expected alcohol heat on the swallow and aftertaste, but it isn't overpowering like I would expect. This drinks like a twelve or thirteen percenter, not eighteen, but it's definitely a sipper.  Feel: Full-bodied, slick, oily, but with some light carbonation.

Taste is similar, with definite sweet and boozy notes, but more bitter than a traditional barleywine - hops still coming through here, a little pine. Still, I wouldn't guess IIPA here.

Pours a decent foamy fizzy 1/2 finger head that fades at a med pace, nice head for a beer of this high abv, decent lacing too, murky reddish orange color.  NOse brings a mix of characters, like a piney citrus barleywine, plenty of piney hops, not mosaic like pine but a spicy earthy pine, bright floral piney hops, with more orange peel and citrus as well, candied orange peel, a mix of candied stone fruit like an apricot style thing. Big candy malt, caramel, a little toffee biscuit, amber malts, toasty malts and big malty aroma in general, but tons of various candy aromas.  Taste brings more sweet flavors, tons of sweet malts, toasty amber malts, pale malts, some caramel, biscuity notes, etc., but again most of all candy characters, candied malts, caramel toffee etc. Mild fruits, again candied stone and tree fruits, candied apricots, a little orange and tangerine notes, candied orange peel and sweet citrus, even a touch of white raisin. Fair booze warmth, not nearly as boozy as it should be which is why I like to give it a year or two, it's boozy fresh, some esters with that, faint phenols, and fair bitterness. Hops also bring a little pine zesty note, but not much. Finish is sticky sweet but dries a bit, more booze tingle coming through a bit, with sticky candied pine notes, as well as candied tree and stone fruits again, touch of citrus, and generic big sweet malt.  Mouth is med to a bit heavier bod, a little syrupy sweet, nice fluffy carb, some warming tingly booze but not a ton.  Overall def a unique and interesting beer. Fresh it's a bit too much of everything, a year or two gives it a lot of character and makes it at least tolerable in drinkability.

I was skeptical at first being a fresh IPA drinker. Really unlike anything I've ever had in a good way! The hops at this point were almost gone, but there was a slight bitter aftertaste that lingered. Mostly this was very sweet with the sweetness/malts shining through. Slight alcohol on the nose but nothing in the flavor. At this point it's probably 20% so that's saying something. The bottle says ""ages well"" and they really aren't kidding.

A - A normal pour creates 1-finger of dense, khaki head. The body is a very hazy, burnt orange, looking almost like a pulpy fruit juice. There are small bubbles consistently making their way toward the surface behind the cloudy body. The head sustains at 1/4 finger ring around the edges, and a thin, lacy film through the middle. There are really nice, lacy rings left on the glass.  S- I'm initially hit by a load of hops, mostly grapefruit, but there's a big, sweet, malt backbone behind it that comes off as caramel or English toffee. Another whiff and the aroma melds into a tobacco leaf and leathery goodness. Within the sweetness, the alcohol becomes apparent. Not harsh, but something of fruit brandy (like apricot or even a cherry cordial). Hops become more spicy too.  T- Whoa! There's a lot going on here. Very sweet up front, something like brown sugar and maple syrup. Then the hops kick in through the middle, bringing a leafy and spicy quality. The finish is a combination of the sweet and hoppy. More of the brown sugar, but with a juicy hop that combines grapefruit and spicy aspects. Things don't change too much with warmth, but become more pronounced. The spicy hops begin to hint at freshly cracked black pepper toward the end.  M- Very full bodied. High viscosity. The hops provide a spicy bite and combine with the extreme ABV that adds a smooth, warm heat. All in all, the finish becomes rather dry after the syrupy sweet mouthful.  O- I'm so glad my wife pulled the trigger for me. I've been tempted every time I see it on the shelf, but walked away due to the cost combined with an apprehension over the perceived flavor profile.

Aromas of big grapefruit, lemon peel, pineapple, tangerine, peach, mango, citrus rind, pine, caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of bright citrus/tropical/piney hops and moderate malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, lemon peel, pineapple, tangerine, peach, mango, citrus rind, pine, caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/citrus rind bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, mango, lemon peel/rind, pine, caramel, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/tropical/piney hops and moderate malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Good amount of dryness from bitterness and spicy alcohol on the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, moderately crisp/sticky, and lightly creamy/slick mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with a light-moderate warmth lingering after the finish with zero booziness. Overall this is an outstanding DIPA, especially considering the ABV. All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of bright citrus/tropical/piney hops and moderate malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the huge ABV. Extremely surprised and impressed with this vintage, as there is still a ton of hop complexity present and it does not feel overly heavy or malty at all; even after being nearly 3 years old.

10099,9086,havron,4.89,"I drove four hours for the privilege of finally having this beast on tap at the Dogfish Head 20 Beers for 20 Years event at World of Beer in St. Petersburg, Florida on Friday night. I came for the 120 and stayed for all the other great brews that DH has to offer, and this monster alone – my very first 120 Minute – was well worth every mile.  Served on draught into a snifter as a far too generous pour for something with this high an ABV. Damn, I am grateful to the bartender, but it looks like I won't be going anywhere for a while tonight...  L: Hazy bright orange-copper topped with a thin ring of head displaying good retention and solid, sticky lacing.  S: Fruitcake and booze, all the way. Surprisingly not a lot in the way of classically recognizable hops in the nose, but the distinctive fruitcake aroma is quite inviting. I'm not a fruitcake hater, unlike as is the fashion, but I'm not exactly a huge fan either. However I will say that if fruitcake tasted as delicious as this smelled, I would absolutely enjoy the Christmas season quite a bit more.  T: BOOZE. Wow. This wicked brew gives you about a second of false security after hitting the tongue before quickly building the alcohol to a punch in the face crescendo, backed by a short blast of prickly carbonation over a strong malty backbone, accompanied by a vibrant and solid kick of flamboyant citrus and piney resinous hops. The booziness reaches a sharp spike and then gradually trails off to reveal a malty maraschino cherry flavor with a bit of a medicinal note, before melting away to more completely showcase the hop profile. As many others have said, being so strong and malty this beer definitely has quite a bit of a barleywine character but, amazingly, this is still, somehow, resolutely an IPA. At eighteen goddamn percent. I don't know which volcano and/or ancient god these guys sacrificed a virgin to in order to pull off this brewing miracle, but hoo lawd, well done!  F: Thick and resinous, this stuff coats the tongue and sticks around for quite some time after every sip. Not an absolutely complete palate-wrecker, but balancing on a knife edge of that distinction. You won't think you're drinking water, that's for damn sure.  O: Wonderful. An incredibly unique and well-crafted bruiser of a brew, this was an absolutely sublime experience and well worth the wait.

Aroma: Alcoholic burn, fruitiness. Not over-the-top hops as would be expected. This is an entirely different beast at 18%!  Taste: Fruity, but with a definite and pronounced alcohol heat. This one’s sweeter, rather than bitter hoppy, weirdly. Most certainly a heavy brew, and one to sip, 120 Minute leaves a burn on the tongue like a harder alcohol, rather than a traditional beer.

The pour is an attractive looking medium amber-copper-yellow hued tone with a lingering foamy white head up top.  Vibrant aroma of barley malts, caramel, peach, mango, other fruits, and almost no booze for 15+ ABV. The hop character is also more subdued than I would have expected.  Bold, creamy body.  Same sort of roasted caramel and barley malt flavors at first followed by a peach, and orange sweetness and perhaps a bit of cognac. Alcohol burn is notable but not overpowering in the least. Bitterness is far mellower than I anticipated. A definite sipper. I felt its 18% ABV about halfway through the bottle. I bought a single bottle. If it wasn't so expensive I might buy another one to age for a year.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Like a scotch you can almost smell the alcohol. Definitely needs to be served cold. Had one that was probably in the mid 40's and it just didn't feel right. A couple of days later had one that probably 35-38 and was much smoother and easier to drink.

Mouthfeel: slightly syrupy and with hops that linger.  Overall: thinking this needs at least two years of aging before consumption.

The sweetness of this beer is big, but there is a pronounced hop flavor with accompanying bitterness to balance it out to an extent. The caramel on the nose is in your face.

I love the 60 Minute and 90 Minute, and this one looks beautiful, a nice deep orange, but you can smell the alcohol quite strongly right from the start. Far more malty than hoppy, so despite the brewing process, very unlike your typical IPA. This would, I assume, be an excellent brew for those that like the extremes in beer, with high alcohol (and I sometimes do myself; Bourbon County Stout is a fabulous example), but for this one, the alcohol is just too strong and too forward for my taste, so I won't be buying again after my stock is gone.

Smells of malt, crackers, scuppernong grape, lemongrass, and alcoholic heat. Flavors of raw sugar cane, orange gumdrops, maple, grassy hop bitterness, and booze. When fresh, this makes no effort to disguise its high abv. None whatsoever.  I'm enjoying this more than the objective score would indicate, so chalk that up to the alcohol talking at the end of a long day. It's intriguing to call this an IPA; it's certainly not ""too extreme to be called beer,"" but it also goes hard enough to end up outside of the typical IPA box. Interesting enough for me to set some on the bottom cellar shelf to forget about for a few years and see how time treats it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Sweet almost syrupy caramel malts, raisin, hints of grapefruit and apricot, very boozy, warm, slightly bitter  Overall - A big, heavy, super sweet, malty boozy beer. Not your everyday drink.

Some interesting grapefruit-like citrus.  Taste: Delightful amber and caramel malts. Light toast. Soapy pine hops. Slightly citrusy tropical fruit. Malts really overshadow the hops. Pretty dang complex and fairly well balanced for a DIPA. Heat is well subdued.  Feel: Barely sticky. Good carbonation. Perfect body.  Overall: This is a delightful and fun beer. Not sure how I feel about the price point... Ultimately I feel glad that I grabbed a second one to cellar.

I picked up some light fruit and mild citrus notes as well, but the main aroma was certainly heavy on the malt sweetness. I felt the taste did not quite live up to the style.

Pours a beautiful bright, burnt orange with a half finger head. Aroma is caramel, orange, candied grapefruit, and booze. Tastes like a citrus liqueur. Mouth feel is medium and syrupy. It's very sweet, but the booze is well integrated. It's much brighter than most barely wines. I had 2013 Sucaba the other night I prefer this.

T - Booziness dominates from start to finish followed with fermented caramel sweetness, with some citrus and pine emerging at the tail end of the sip, borderline medicinal without crossing the line.  M - Pronounced alcohol warming on the way down and continues to keep the throat toasty warm. Thick, full bodied, lip smacking sticky, velvet on the tongue.  O - Everyone already knows about the reputation of this beer, definitely a sipper and will take quite awhile to work through this bottle if you're drinking alone.

10099,9086,BranfordBound,3.96,"Not sold on this one, but still an interesting beer. World Wide Stout was much better from their extreme beer series. This was super rich, sweet, fruity, oily, complex, and slightly boozy. Some people speak of hops but mine is over a year old so most have faded. More of a brandy than an IPA. Overall it was worth it to try a beer of this caliber, but I don't think I will try this one soon. I have about 2 more so I will experiment with more age.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

10099,9086,DeweyCheatem-n-Howe,4.8,"I'm a budding hop-head, and when I had the chance to try the famous 120-minute at dinner, I jumped at it. From the drinking experience, I hesitate to call it an IPA (I know it is, it just doesn't taste like it). It's almost more like a barleywine to me.  Look: Gorgeous deep amber color with a little bit of head Smell: Delicious. Best part of the beer was just enjoying its aroma. Sweet, a little fruity Taste: Like I said, it's almost a barleywine kind of taste to me. It's sweet, there's no real taste of ""hoppiness,"" it's strong but not alcohol-y. Feel: Medium-bodied.  Overall, this is a great beer, nothing like what I expected. Kicked my butt, too... I went from a tasting flight at Night Shift to this, and my wife had to drive us home.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,FFreak,4.44,"Thanks to BoldRulerVT for bringing over a 4-year old bottle of DFH 120 last night. This was surprisingly good beer and not at all what I expected. Poured into tulips and enjoyed at dusk out on the deck.  It's a hazy washed-out apricot color with a thin white head that sticks around for a while and leaves a bit of lace.  The aroma is strong with an assortment of dried fruit - apricot, prune, raisin, lots of sweetness here with absolutely no hop aroma.  Taste is nicely balanced between the sweet dried fruit and enough soft bitterness to support it. No trace of the high ABV.  Mouth is medium bodied, which is surprising given the high ABV. I really expected a fuller mouth, but was really pleased that it wasn't.  Overall, this is an unusual beer that ages wonderfully and is surprisingly tasty. I have a year-old bottle stashed and I think I'll give it a few more years, as this four-year old seemed just right.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,BoldRulerVT,4.09,"Poured from the 12 oz bottle into a snifter. Pours a medium orange/amber with minimal head. Aromas are very big, lots of malt, lots of sweetness, plum/raisin. Taste is in line with aromas, not much alcohol burn considering the ridiculous ABV here. Very tasty, but very little hop presence. Mouthfeel is really nice, lots to chew on. Overall, a tasty and interesting beer. Hard to consider it an IPA as I barely pick up hops, but still very good and enjoyable.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

But this one, while awesome and powerful, may be too powerful for any one man to handle, like a genie, or a nuke. Tons of flavor, but perhaps too rich. I forget the abv of that particular one, but it was probably up to at least 20% by the time I had it. So heavy, it almost clogs your throat. The hops are choked, suffocated, and smothered with a pillow by the malts who seem to have grown in power of the years. I love this beer the way I love those ridiculous Fast and Furious movies - I feel like a testosterone junkie just being in the same room with it.

10099,9086,infinitebruner,4.04,"May 30, 2015  12 oz bottle, IPA glass  2013 Vintage  A – Medium amber, orangeish-red. Mostly clear. A half inch of off-white yellowish bubbly foam with moderate-low retention.  S – Very malt-forward, with bread crust, graham cracker, and a touch of caramel. Tropical fruit, mango and guava, with some rich resiny hop aromas as well. Some alcohol esters, mostly warm and boozy.  T – Very sweet, a lot of honey, maple syrup, and brown sugar notes. Hops are tropical, guava and mango, with some papaya in the mix as well. A bit of resin, along with some rosy alcohol notes.  M – Thick, kind of syrupy, very malty. A lot of residual sweetness. Carbonation is fairly low. Bitterness is not very high, even though it’s very noticeable as it tries to balance out the sugars. Boozy warmth throughout.  O – A very different experience after two years of aging. The alcohol as mellowed to just a warm boozy sensation, and the edge is off the hops, leaving mostly sweetness and hop aroma. A very unique entry.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,1000lbgrizzly,3.16,"A: Hazy gold-orange, yellow-white head fades but leaves rings of lace.  S: Floral but verging on abrasive chemical. Soil and citrus, but those are quickly smothered by the rest of it.   T: Woody, floral. Pine shows mid-late palate. Chemical like nail polisher still coming through (mega yuck.- what is this??) Cinnamon and baking spices on the finish (I swear), plus more alcohol warmth.  M: It's got some bite! Sky high IBU and sky high alcohol, as it turns out, is intense. Abrasive, but not astringent.  O: Barely fun even as a novelty. It seems like they got a little lazy, trying to make it as extreme as possible and any positive characteristic was a lucky side effect. Insane bitterness and ridiculous hop character is intriguing, but not when the smell and flavor make me worry if I'm going to go blind. I'm glad I didn't, and glad I got to try it, but now our relationship is over. Sorry 120, it's you.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,AmeriCanadian,4,"Barley. Wine. Hard to really grade it as an IPA, as the size, booziness, sweetness, maltiness, earthy barley characteristics, barrel-like notes, and minimal traditional hop notes take it into a different universe. It ain’t a pretty beer (based on a 3-year-aged bottle, though I’ve had it fresh, too). A very muddy brown with gold edging, zero head. All the above notes come out strongly on the nose and tongue, and the heat (understandably, given the ABV) makes you you feel like you’re drinking wine or watered whiskey. But it’s a fun drink (to share) every now and then, very unique, and the feel is silky smooth.

No attempt has been made to hide the alcohol, and that is a major distraction. I really had to nurse this one through, with a glass of water, just like I would have done with a shot of bourbon. M - Alcohol all over the place, just feeling the burn and not much else. O - 3.5/5 and I'm being very generous. Glad to have tried it, and glad to have purchased just the one bottle.

Light raisin and date malts. Strong marmalade, evergreen and orange hop flavor in the middle and the finish has grapefruit and light citrus. The balance is on the hops. Fermentation has produced a ton of ethenol and some fruity esters (pears). High octane flavors throughout.  M: Big body with high alcohol warming in the chest. Creamy mouthfeel with a prickly sensation on the tongue. Also a sticky hop resin covers the palate after a few sips. Carbonation is moderate.  O: Strong in every area. This was a beer that I discovered when I first started getting into IPAs about 6-7 years ago but never had the opportunaty to try it after DFH pulled out of WI. After the long wait Im glad I got to try it but probably won't buy another.

10099,9086,DabblinWiscCraft,4.01,"Saw a few 12 oz bottles on the shelf at my local liquor store and felt compelled to buy one. The bottled on date states it was made a little over 3 months ago. Poured at about 60 degrees from the bottle into my pint glass.  L: A little underwhelming, in terms of appearance. It pours a deep, cloudy apricot with about a quarter inch of off-white head that dissipates quickly and leaves some cling on the glass. Moderate visible carbonation (though it's pretty hard to tell because of the cloudiness).  S: Pine resin, herbal earthiness, and citrus fruit in the nose, along with a healthy caramel malt underside. There's also some clear alcohol in the mix, along with a slight hint of what's registering to me as bread pudding.  T: Caramel malt sweetness and some vanilla tones right out of the gates, with a striking hit of boozy alcohol--the sensation is a bit like taking a pull of whiskey. Some resinous hop notes, along with some less pronounced herbal hop notes. The middle provides more of that sweet alcohol, with apricot and a suggestion of black licorice. The back is warming alcohol, a bit of pine hop bitter, and the persistence of some caramel malt. For a beer that is billed as a huge hop bomb, it's a whole lot sweeter than I expected. I was looking for bright hop notes, but they're all relatively subdued and/or overpowered by the booze.  F: This one has a nice feel for how high the ABV is. It's creamy, just a bit syrupy, and bitter without shooting your taste buds completely. It drinks a bit lighter than I expected it would.  O: This really is a taste experience that I haven't encountered in too many DIPAs. It's incredible how boozy it is without totally loosing its character. That being said, this beer did not deliver the kind of hop aroma and taste that I was expecting. It's possible that I got a bad bottle, but it just seems to me that all the big flavors that should come from all that hopping have been muted, stewed away, or just overshadowed too much by the alcohol. At $10 a 12 oz bottle, I probably won't be ponying up for another one of these in the near future, but I'm glad I had the chance to try it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,BergBeer,3.13,"Look: Opaque hazy copper-amber with a small eggshell colored head. Moderate activity. Good lacing.  Smell: Pine and citrus hop notes burst from the bottle as soon as I opened it. Pungent and sticky. Notes of pine, grassy hops, toffee, whole grain crust with honey, dried apricot, and tobacco. Resinous.  Taste: Toffee, grapefruit zest, pine, caramel, tangerine, golden raisins, bruised pear, honey, and pronounced alcohol.  Feel: Thick and chewy. Huge body. Sits heavy on the palate. Surprisingly moderate bitterness. Sharp alcohol throughout. Good carbonation. Off-dry finish.  Overall: One unique beer. It's everything in a triple IPA turned up to 11. It merrily skips right past any balance and right into soupy mess territory. Yet I can't see how this beer could ever be anything else. Its a wild ride and interesting to see a brewer push the limits so far. Yet, that doesn't make it any better to drink.

It's aroma is a bright, juicy orange / tangerine note with floral hints and a resinous woody undertone. As it warms up caramel starts to poke through with cloves and a hint of acetone. It's highly citrus bittersweet that both compliments and counteracts each other (not necessarily balanced), with perhaps a touch more sweet than bitter. The beer is viscous and creamy with a soft fuzzy carbonation. The full body is woody and citrus with a pine grit and alcohol on the tongue. The finish is warm (vodka or strong bourbon) with spicy clove and woody notes and a clean, vodka-alcohol aftertaste that's dry and astringent.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Almost all alcohol and a musty, sour grape. Actually, it smells a bit like gin now that I think about it.  Taste is better, but not by much. Harsh is the best way I can describe it. Boozy right off the bat with the alcohol coming off the top ropes with a flying elbow to the tongue. Then some hops that also hang around in the form of a terrible, and bitter aftertaste. There is also that musty, stale flavor. Somewhere in there I noticed some sweetness in the form of candied sugars and caramel malts. I actually bumped it some as it improved a bit as it warmed.  Feel is ok considering the alcohol content.  I realize that this is going to be a ""boozy"" beer, and my rdev is going to be off the charts here. Even World Wide Stout couldnt mask all of the alcohol. However, I am just not liking the flavors and I don't think they are well integrated. They are all over the place. This just seems like a mess. It reminds me a lot of Double Crooked Tree (which I didn't care for either) for reference, or a Molotove Cocktail on the more positive side. It is definitely along the American Barleywine lines more so than an Imperial IPA. I would be open to trying one with some age on it. It cant really be worse for me.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,dbl_delta,4.41,"Undated (but presumably quite fresh) bottle split with a friend. (A split is probably a really good idea at this ABV. This is a really potent brew.) However, after 6 oz I was regretting sharing it. It was THAT GOOD. Appearance is nothing special. Medium gold; tenacious white head; carbonation is spot on. Taste: oh, my. Malty, sweet caramel, some hops bitterness but VERY subdued. Smooth and extremely easy to drink. Syrupy, almost. The alcohol is there but it's so nicely integrated that you just go with it. Had a 21st Amendment Hop Crisis (one of my all-time favorite DIPAs) immediately following and it tasted thin and flavorless. Keep telling yourself ""sip it, sip it"" - but it's SO good. Again, it's probably best that I split a bottle. At ten bucks a pop and 18%, this would not be a regular indulgence. However, if you get a chance to try it (and don't have to drive), it's highly recommended. I have a second bottle that's going in the cellar for a year or two. There aren't many rough edges on this brew, and it's an IPA (and therefore best if it's fresh?), but the bottle does say that it ages well so I gotta see.  Update: OK, so I had the opportunity to score a fresh 32 oz growler while in DE. So much for cellaring.) I reiterate everything I said above, and then some! Not yo mamma's DI(PA.  To elaborate: DFH 120 is thicker, sweeter, boozier, smoother than any IPA/DIPA. If you're looking for a hop bomb, this ain't it. I would contend that 120-Minute would fall into the Strong Scotch Ale/Wee Heavy category. And it would be near the top of the class no matter where you classify it. Kudos to DFH!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

The first bottle was tasted in 2013 and comparable to nitromethane race fuel. The second bottle, aged one year, was tolerable but still very Boozy. Today I enjoyed the third bottle of 2013 dfh 120 and found it much more pleasant, in fact, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Very hoppy, foamy white head, still slightly boozy in taste, but at this point no more so than your average imperial ipa. 100% improved from one year ago.

Poured a burnt orange, amber color with a thin head that quickly disappeared. Aromas of booze, booze and more booze with some malt and hops lying beneath. Little scared what it might taste like. Turned out to be pleasantly surprised. Yes lots of booze with a little burn on the finish but a nice mix of malts, hops with fruit. Caramelized sugars are in there as well. Sweet taste that lingers on the aftertaste along with hops and booze. Leaves a tangy taste in the mouth. More West Coast IPA than East Coast pine tree. Still sucks the spit out of your mouth like all IPAs. But less than most. However, I am guessing a full glass would dry you out due to the alcoholic content. Probably the perfect beer for outdoor hockey season on a cold day or night.

Smells of sweetened medium roast malts, cirtusy apricots, brown sugar, and even a little bit of cocoa. WOW this has a lot of things going on. It's difficult even putting a finger on some of the smells since I will type and put it up to my nose and find different things about it.

10099,9086,YeahRightt,4.07,"L- Very Attractive burnt orange, amber color. Thin quickly dissipating head  S- Boozy, tingling nose, nice malt and hop balance. Booze kind of overpowers most scent traces.  T- Surprisingly mellow in terms of booze, but still has a distinct burn and alcohol finish. Hops start mostly in the middle and stick through to the finish. Dominated by hops and caramel but still very balanced. Fruit flavors come forward as the beer warms and you sip (and boy is this beer a sipper). A sweetness lingers towards the end from the alcohol that works with the fruity tastes. The ""fruit"" aspect seems to lack a citrus/tangy flavor that I tend to like in IIPAs, but still a great flavor profile.  F- Chewy mouthfeel. Sticks to the back of your tongue and makes you salivate, which prevents the alcohol and hops from drying out your mouth.  Overall- An easy decision every year to grab. Enjoying this while snowed in and its a perfect late winter beer on a night where you don't need to operate a vehicle or heavy machinery. 90 Minute is still a better IPA in my opinion, but this is a nice and decadent and rich flavored beer to treat yourself with when you can.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

The only IPA I like is Hopslam so I was skeptical going into this. A/Golden hue which I was expecting. S/Hoppy and sweet. I am not too sure what I was smelling that was sweet. T/Wow! This was thick almost syrupy with a sweet taste. It reminded me of a Barley Wine and then the hops hit me near the end. The hops were not a bad thing like in other IPA's I have had. It did not seem to kill my palate and the hops seemed to be balanced. I think some breweries throw as many different kinds of hops in and load it to the max and end up having a bitter, palate killing beer which people love, but I think DFH thought this one through and took their time. O/ I will search this out again but at 18% you have to make a commitment to it :) I can say I was very pleased and impressed. I feel that this beer lived up to its reputation. Well done!!

Despite claims that it ages well, I am digging the hoppy experience I'm getting from a super fresh bottle. One whiff and a bed of hop cones made their way up the nasal cavity. That intensified with the first sip, featuring multiple layers of citrus notes on steroids, tethered with a honey-like sweetness that conditioned the effervescence of the warming alcohol. Fresh baked bread, so doughy and sweet -- this brilliant mothereffer is one exceptional treat. Hats off to Sam and his entire crew.

I was expecting a harsh west coast smell, but it's actually much more malty, with a subtle smell of hops, and alcohol on the back.  T: Starts off almost like a white wine, with a malty back, and then a slight bitter hops, before the booze hits on the back. Not at all like any beer I've had, and it almost pushes a wine/liquor drink. It has a roasty oak flavor that is something special as well. As it warms a more grapefruit note comes through as the malt takes a back seat.  F: Not the thickest beers I've drank, but it has some body. It actually is quite smooth, and carbonated well. I've had a 16% before, and this one is 100x easier to drink than the 16% I had.  O: As I find myself getting boozed up off of one beer, I can't help but be amazed at what I'm drinking.

Hoppiness is not overbearing, but it let's you know it is there. Quite a bit of heat on this one though. Fruity aromas, lemon, orange. These can be detected in the taste as well.

10099,9086,WheelsPSU,4.15,Aged a 2013 120 minute and opened it on NYE going into 2015. Wow  I've been to DFH twice but have never had the good fortune of trying this. So my friend who lives in DE brought this to me.  It poured an extremely rich orange almost copper. Lacing was very light but maybe that was due to the aging.  Taste was very sweet. Sweeter than I was expecting. Not sweet like a dessert but sweet like aged malt meets an orange flavor meets molasses. Interesting. But wow does that alcohol hit you in the face. Gave my stomach a warm feeling like having a sip of a spirit.  Kind of felt like this bordered on barleywine.

10099,9086,samtrillo,4.1,"It's a deep and cloudy copper-orange. I get a big frothy-white head out of this puppy, which is awesome considering the alcohol content.  The nose is pure-sweet-big-malt. Like a barleywine with the candied fruits. Sherry, raisin, prune, caramel, boozy and fruity and sweet. It's a fortified wine or liqueur from this nose, for sure.  First sip.. sweet... an orange liqueur is not far from it, but it's obviously hopped. What and interesting beer. Almost cloying but it's warranted!? I don't know.Can't quite place it. It's maybe the most intense version of an American Barleywine you can find. Hoppy and boozy and sweet, yet somehow it makes it work. For whatever ABV my version is, it is not as obvious as I have noticed with other double digit beers. Definitely more balanced and hidden than Molotov Cocktail. It's surprisingly smooth, but the sweetness keeps it a sipper. I don't know if it's possible, but even more hops could be expressed in this malt backbone if they wanted, because there is a COLOSSAL dosage of sweetness and alcohol. IPA this is not. BA needs a new style that is neither American Barleywine nor Imperial IPA. Evil Twin, Knee Deep and DFH have offerings into this unique style.  If you ever find yourself staring across from this beer... no matter the price point, it is something you must try as a beer nerd.

10099,9086,PSU_Mike,4.4,"2008 Bottle opened on 12/23/14  6 years were magic for this gem.  Not very pretty on the pour. Very dark ruby color with a white head and a murky body. The smell was impressive. Incredibly sweet candied raisins, plum, molasses, and no hop presence to be found. The flavor is incredibly sweet but it balances out the high alcohol content. This is full barleywine territory in flavor. Despite the sweetness, the flavor is an impressive version of the nose. Very full bodied, cloyingly sweet, mild alcohol burn, and virtually non-existent carbonation.  Having never had this before and my first bottle being a '08 vintage, I'm truly impressed with how this held up. I would love to try this beast fresh but age works magic on this monster of a beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Harvest06,3.89,"Let my start by saying if you're looking for a standard IPA don't bother with this. This is much more than an ipa. Its more of very hoppy American barleywine.  Review of Feb. 2013 120 Minute IPA, 18% abv, consumed fresh (within 3 weeks of bottling). A: Golden Orange with thin head, Simple bottle with cool bottle cap. S: Good complex aroma: Sweet malty followed by citris hops and ending with alcohol. T: Beginning: Sweet malty that coast the mouth, middle citris fresh hops w/ maly fruity sweetness & some bitter hops, ends with earthy aromas & in alcohol. Opens up as it warms but the alcohol presence also increases with the warmth. M: Full bodied syrypy & sticky but not too thick & not filling, warming but not harsh, perfect low carbination for sipping O: Somewhat complex, aromatic, good balanced malts sweetness followed by hops bitters. Great to sip with a friend. Don't over chill this. Sweetness does overpower the hops, making it a sipping brew. I'd like to see a barrel aged version of this for more complexity. Laying some of this down to see how it ages.  Update: Tried of the 2013 at 1 1/2 years. Carbonation is about the same as before. The dry hops and aromatic hops have faded to almost nothing as expected - unfortunately this what makes this more than a barleywine. The bitterness is there but lessened. The alcohol has mellowed. Unfortunately the malts have changed very little and without the hop aroma its a fairly uninteresting ale.  I'll try another in 1 year to see how this develops. At 18% this could easily age for another decade. I've consumed a 4 year old DFH ale (not 120) that had no signs of oxidation or reduced carbonation so I trust this brewery.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,iTunesUpdates,4.33,"This was missing a component for me. I feel like it could have used more carbonation or something.  Very easy to drink being at 18%. I think it only took me 40min to finish it. When I look at Bourbon County, that takes me 2 hours. So this gets an A for that.

10099,9086,M_J_Z,4.5,"This one is excellent when on draft and fresh. It's tough to beat, IMO. Lots going on; pine, citrus, sweetness, slight booziness, oak, strong crispness and bite ... it's very complex.  I've enjoyed it from the bottle, too, but haven't tried it that way as many times as I have on draft. One of the drawbacks, IMO, is that the bottles don't have a date on them, so it's tough to tell when they were made. I'd like to be able to distinguish them. I've tried a few bottles that had some age (1-3 years?) on them, but I didn't find them to be as memorable as the excellent drafts that I've had.  One of my favorites, but not something I could drink a ton of or regularly. For me, it's a good one to have a handful of times/year. 4.25-4.5 (though if you can get it on draft, you might be inclined to give this a full 5 stars, as I recently did on Untappd).",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

10099,9086,ColdOneKev,4.25,"A - Hazy gold body, medium off-white head. Fades mostly to a thin layer. No lacing. S - Smells thick. Heavy citrus, grapefruit, I get some biscuit malt there too. T - Holy hops! Heavy on the hops. Bitterness is overwhelming and then the malt backbone is overwhelming I imagine these both mellow with age. There is a lot going on here. Boozy burn at the end drys everything out and lingers. M - Thick, low carb. Coats the palate and then dries out. Leaves a slight numbness. O - This is not an everyday beer, or even every month. This is a special beer for special occasions. Treat it as such. I enjoyed this over a 2 hour period and appreciated the changes as it warms. This is a great beer, but is difficult to find and expensive when you do. For me, personally, that takes away from the beer. Definitely worth a try if you're curious.

10099,9086,NinjaJesus,3.5,"So sweet! Truly surprised by this one. Had on tap at the brewery and boy was I surprised. As the yeast gorge themselves on the massive amount of sugar, they are unable to process it all and are thus left with not only a high alcohol content but also a powerful sweetness. But even this sweetness cannot outpace the bouquet of hops present in this extravagantly hopped beer. With an extremely high price tag, this is not one for the light of heart. If you love extreme IPAs then you will love this beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Aristeia_88,3.19,"So I'll start this off by saying that I'm not a huge IPA fan, or even much of a hop-head... Even so - The first time I ever had dogfish head 60 minute was on tap, and the fresh flavor of the hops blending together so perfectly was mind blowing. Then I had the 90 minute on tap at Buffalo Wild Wings, and decided to buy more at my local beer shop. When I heard that there was a 120 minute, I knew I had to have it... I managed to find a 4 pack recently at one of the beer stores around here - I wasn't sure I could justify $40 for a 4 pack, but I decided to make it a happy birthday present to myself. I have high hopes that by the end of this review, I'll have no regrets. Let's get started, shall we?  Serving Type - Bottle. Poured into a Samuel Adams Wide-mouth Pint Glass   A - It's a hazy golden-yellow with about a half-finger straw-white head that dissipates in around a minute or so. (Even a hopping of this magnitude can't help the head retention in an 18% brew) Slightly disappointing look to it - I expected it to be a little darker, and much clearer.  S - Upon first opening the bottle, you are immediately hit by a massive dose of pine and grapefruit flavors... Very mouthwatering - as it warms a bit, more of a fresh fruit scent comes forward, hinting at berries and possibly even coconut?  T - Now for the big one... Taste. I'm sorry to say that it's completely underwhelming in this department... After the 60 minute, and the 90 minute, and my love of big, heavy, high alcohol beers- This just doesn't live up to expectations. There's a little bit of hop upon first taste, but as it makes its way through the mouth, over the tongue and down the throat, all you get is bitterness, old vegetation, copper-rust and an alcohol burn with no maltiness to back it up or attempt to cover it... Similar to their World Wide Stout, they've focused purely on ABV, and forgotten that when you're going to spend $10 on a single bottle of beer, it sure as hell better be worth savoring.  M - Much lighter than expected... It makes you wonder how much of the ABV comes from corn sugar or other adjuncts. Moderate carbonation helps the lightness of it, but perhaps they would have done well to back up the alcohol with enough residual sweetness to cover the burn?  O - Disappointing :( I wanted to like this beer, I really did - I looked for it for over a year, and was ecstatic when I finally found it, but it doesn't come anywhere close to living up to the hype... My wallet sheds a tear for my poor gut. Half a bottle down, 3 1/2 to go...",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,embass,4.64,A: Deep orange color. Pours really thick.  S: Very strong (boozy) hop-forward and citrusy.  T&M: With the first sip there are lots of citrus and tropical fruit flavors. Finishes a bit bitter. Very thick with mid-level amount of carbonation.  Overall very good. Actually tasted better than described to me by a friend. For some reason drinking this reminds me of the Simpsons when Bart and Milhouse drank that super-squishee (Milhouse takes the first sip and his glasses fly off).,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

10099,9086,vickersspitfire,4.75,"Appearance: Pours out a bright orange as it flows into your glass, it gets a bit darker-a brownish/orange murky color towards the center. Mild carbonation, and a nice had on top. The head is an off white color and thins out into a multitude of islands covering the top of the beer. Very strong lacing in this ale marks every sip you take. Smell: Strong hops, grapefruit and orange zest, you can pick up a slight melon aroma the first second on every sniff. There are some other spices I here that make this one hell of a great smelling ale. Taste: This has a very complicated taste to it, the dryness hits you first and then it breaks up into a whole mess of flavors, hops, orange zest, spices and more. Its very earthy for a DIPA and not overpowering with hops either. Grapefruit and brown sugar seem to mix together as it moves toward the back of your throat. The alcohol is up front in this ale. Its mildly tart on the edges of your mouth. Mouthfeel: Starts of smooth for the first quick half second, semi dry and full bodied. The alcohol becomes most evident right before you swallow.

S- I can smell the malts right off the bat. Not sure what to expect next since this is high ABV, Slight barleywine characteristics, but not hiding the big DIPA that this is.  T- getting malts and hop bitterness nicely blended. Not a juicy hop bomb that the IBU's would indicate, certainly faded with age in comparison to an un-aged prior sample. Mildly resinous on the back fade.  F - The high alcohol is evident but not with any unexpected bite. Reasonably smooth for such a big brew.  O-really impressed with the age impression on this brew. I'd age a little less for more of the hop character to shine through. The age has certainly transformed this beer into a beer that transcends the normal expectations for a DIPA.

10099,9086,TCJ0100,1.5,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a cognac snifter. It looks hazy orange and its completely opaque.  It smells like nail polish remover that has been seasoned with off hops. It is just terrible. It smells like the orange Old English Wood Soap that I use to mop my floors. This could make paint fall off a shed.  The taste is like some terrible new hop-flavored black rum. I am used to my hop bombs being hop forward, and malts secondary. This is the opposite where the sweetness is front and center and the hops are fighting with it. There is nothing good about the taste of this beer. It tastes like if Admiral Nelson made a port or the type of liquor you use in baking.  The mouthfeel adds to the already less than ideal characteristics, making this beer one of my all time least favorites. I would sooner drink Natural Ice than drink this.  This beer is ambitious and that is all it is. I like Dogfish Head as a brewery, and I am really glad they are in Bloomington and Indiana on the whole, but this beer frankly is just awful with no redeeming characteristics. I ended up drain pouring it. I have had enough beers like Founders Devil Dancer that I can appreciate an ambitious attempt at making a one-of-a-kind beer, however, this beer is just too much. There is fine line between a pleasant beer, which rather than attacking the palate attempts to work with it, and a beer that fights your palate every step of the way.

10099,9086,dmgeng,3.62,"I've really wanted to try this beer for a long time but thought that I would have to travel out of Indiana to get some but little did I know that last week my liquor store in Brownsburg got a few cases! At $10 a pop I only got 2 but I was excited.  A - Deep orange color. Pours thick! Totally opaque from all the hops and malt packed into this beer. Light white head with light lacing.  S - Very strong malt character with lots of alcohol and some raw citrus-type hops. Not any where near the hop smell that I expected. Smells more like a strong barley wine with the malty backbone forcing most of the aromatics.  T - The first sip there are lots of flavors but mostly the rich malt character holds true, then the alcohol ""flavor"" more than just heat and then the hop resins come with some flavor but mostly just bitterness. The bitterness seems to mask the late addition hops making it feel more like a hop bomb instead of showcasing individual hop flavors. It feels like the alcohol burn sticks to the back of your mouth from the beer's thickness and the hops you can't just exhale the booziness.  M - Super high mouth-feel with lighter carbonation. The thickest IIPA I could ever had even dreamed of; it's basically a 20% American Barley Wine with less of the caramel tones and color.  Overall, a different DIPA experience and not my favorite. I still think that the best way to describe this beer is a super-charged Barley Wine. The alcohol heat burns the hops into your throat. I was disappointed by this beer especially when comparing this to the amazing 90-Minute IPA from DFH which is has tons of hop flavor, aroma, and bitterness along with the malt and alcohol but this is the complete opposite. I love hops, bitterness, and straight booze but I think the thickness along with the alcohol burn killed it for me. I will try my other one after a couple other beers to really put me down and hopefully after a few beers the burn won't be so devastating.

As I said, I shared this beer and even half of it got me quite buzzed. This is because the alcohol content is so strong; if you are looking for a beautiful high this is the beer for you. The hops aroma and taste is intense yet it achieves for me a perfect balance with delicious syrupy and caramel like malt sweetness.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,rjs246,3.75,"This was pitched to me as the holy grail of American IPAs. And, you know, it was good but the 18% ABV is a little unnecessary and influences the taste.

Really attractive colors coming through  S: Hops and more Hops, nearly overpowering. Some tropical fruits on the nose, as well as something not so sweet. Onion? More wafts bring sweet caramel.  T: Oh my god the sugars, its so sweet! like liquid candy, caramel and bread mixed. The word ""cloying"" comes to mind but NOT in a bad way. Definitely a sipper. Then the hops, they assault the senses and make you wrinkle your nose, again, NOT in a bad way. As it hits the throat, alcohol makes itself known. Spicy and warm all the way down to the belly.  M: Big, Bold, and Chewy. More of a mouthful that some of the best barleywines  O: A remarkable beer, and fantastic experience.

10099,9086,RichKent,2.12,"My problem with DFH 120 is that it's presented as an IPA and it's VERY different from what I was expecting based on that broad categorization. I consider DFH 120 a heavily hopped barley wine, and if you open your first bottle expecting that you'll be better off in my opinion.  The appearance is a nice, hazy orange - it certainly looks like a good IPA.  Smell is sharp and boozy. The hops are there, but overpowered by sweet malty smells mixed with the sharpness of alcohol.  Taste follows the nose. This is a sipper - and a very boozy sipper at that. It's tough to get past the alcohol as it overpowers most of the other flavors. Not really surprising at over 15%, but again, this drinks like a barley wine - not an IPA. There's sweetness from the malts, and definitely hoppy bitterness, but any citrus or fruity flavors take a back seat to the booze.  Mouth is sticky, syrupy, and a little thick. The carbonation is there, but overwhelmed by how sticky it is.  Overall - if you love barley wines you'll probably dig DFH 120. If you (like me) love nicely balanced, smooth, and fruity DIPAs, like Heady, Abner, Ghandi, etc.. then you'll probably be disappointed like I was.  It's possible that the bottle I tried wasn't very fresh and that resulted in less hop flavor and more booze - but from what I've heard 120 is pretty boozy regardless. I'm glad I got to knock it off my list, but I won't be seeking out 120 again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Aroma upon pouring is sweet floral bouquet, honey and caramel malt notes, some brown sugar. Taste same as aroma, has a nice fruity, citrus orange alcohol flavor with a mild hops bite, which has undoubtedly been mellowed by the aging. Plate is a full creamy and smooth body, with good carbonation. The finish is a combination of all the aforementioned taste and flavor, although they intensify as it warms up, the ending is sweet with some light annotations of some vanilla and earthiness and actual bitterness intensifies a bit as well. alcohol seems to be well hidden.

10099,9086,ConanSachler,4.75,"Had this on tap for the first time after many years of drinking bottles. I love this beer no matter how it's served, but I do recommend aging it for about 3 years before drinking. When it's fresh it's all hops and booze. When it's aged all sorts of different flavors emerge, the boozyness goes away and it changes color from blonde to more of an amber. It kind of tastes like bourbon when aged with a nice vanilla/raisin lingering finish. Be careful when drinking, this one will knock you flat on your ass.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

10099,9086,EraDehops,4.8,"Traded this for a Heady Topper to a native Delawareian... Glad I did, but definitely a different character of IPA. SO, Appearance: Poured in a Let It Be Beatles pint glass, is a beautiful heavy, golden, dusty sunset orange with half a finger width head that laces up the edge of the glass like a vine on a trellis. LOTS of gas.. This bad boy keeps on bubblin'. Was just achin' to be opened! Head is creamy vanilla. Aroma: Fits the appearance. Malty, sweet, heavy blood orange. Not the citrus bang of a hopped out IPA, but dank, sweet, and citrusy all at once.. Like a late summer herb. Superb. Maybe papaya? Banana? Something sweet in there... Taste: A ton to describe and every part is very smooth! Malt citrus, Hopped sweetness, Mango at peaked ripeness. Ethanol is actually hard to taste, but easy to feel. The blend is so perfect, must be the boil? Mouthfeel: This is my favorite part. If this thing is 18% I wonder what they're up to over there. Thick but very drinkable. Soaks every portion of my mouth. Viscous, but clean! Mmm! Keeps me wanting more! They must have tapped into some precious water at Dogfish Head. I love it! Really very good. I would guzzle it haha, but I am tipps'd after half the glass... so am enjoying each sip as it's own. Overall: I thought maybe I'd need two to really appreciate, but man right out of thebottle was love at first drink. So smooth, rich and creamy. Props to Dogfish Head. They really produce a good beer. This 120 falls right in line, and probably to the top, with their other beers. I am a fan. They have a way of filling every gap that their water allows. Excellent flavor and I am happy to have made the trade (just one!) for a heady.

10099,9086,Nugganooch,3.38,"12oz bottle from trade with Brooklynbrews Notes taken on 08/10/14 - FW Snifter glass  I believe this was a 2012 vintage – Thanks Andrew!  A: Dark caramel body with a murky brownish amber appearance. Looks thick and syrupy as the bubbles slowly escape to the top developing a short lived layer of khaki suds. Nominal amount of stick noted as its more so just some alcohol leggings.  S: Smells just like a nice American Barley wine should. Rich with caramel candy malt sweetness through and through. A little nuanced breadiness, apparent with alcohol. Lightly dusted with spice hops, crushed pine, florals, candied orange peel, and a few earthy minerals. Not bad but not what I would consider anywhere near a Double IPA.  T: The beer opens with an insulin shocking amount of caramelized malt sweetness piled on top of sweetened breads. Has an almost tangy sour caramel candy likeness and while it is definitely hoppy I find the actual bitterness to be fairly restrained. Too bad as a little sharpness could really help cut all that cloying sweetness. I get some spice hops with dried orange peel, florals, and suppressed pines. Not very resinous for that matter. Alcohol is present and warming but very subdued considering. Just way too rich overall and not in a good way. Not exactly terrible as there are some kudos due for handling such a monster brew this well but this is just not made to my liking whatsoever.  M: Thick and full bodied. Lightly syrupy on the tongue as the carbonation struggles to pop. Somewhat sticky feel but rather clean otherwise with low bitterness and no lingering effects. Warming alcohol upon exhalation.  D: Such a weird beer to produce and then call an IPA. Even coined as a Barley wine this wouldn’t be a favorite. Very low drinkability to this one. Glad to have finally tried the 120 but not something I could touch often. I am not sure if the aging has made any significant impact without comparison.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

S — Smells super boozy and hot, though there is a large hop presence underneath it all. Super piney, citrusy, and boozy.

10099,9086,cjgiant,3.95,"Bottled in 5/2014 (direct 3.87): Pours a translucent orange, with a small amout of soapy bubbles that fade quickly, leaving some along the edges. A swirl does bring the carbonation to the top for a second. Little to no lacing, but some alcohol legs. I must say here, let this beer come to temp, because the head look and retention was much better when I poured the remaining 2 oz into my snifter.  The nose when the beer is still a little cold, I get a nice whiff of alcohol backed by a light caramel maltiness, with some papaya and melon, a little blackberry and/or prune, even a hint of date. I must repeat, however, that the alcohol is easily the most noticeable.  The taste does a better job of hiding the alcohol (at temp). The beer is pretty sweet, starting off like a creamsicle with orange and a surprisingly smooth feel. The alcohol burn starts to grow, and I start to get canteloupe and then some sweet dark fruit (think fig newton). If I swig the beer quickly a get a tart berry flavor that I do not get if I leave the beer on my tongue to savor it. The alcohol grows throughout the taste, leaving a nice light burning tingle on the tongue after the beer has headed down the throat.  I was hoping for more from this beer, mainly hoping the alcohol were a little more hidden, and also that the sweetness would be cut a little more at some point in the taste. There are some very interesting flavors in there, and I get different things at different times. Have one of these to age as well, wonder if a ""mellowed"" version of this will give me more if what I am seeking.  Review in 5/2015 of 2011 on draft: Alcohol is still present, and does still cost the beer overall, but I'm not sure what I expected in such a high ABV. Truthfully, I look at this beer as more of a quad, without any Belgian characteristics (replaced with hops).

A = Crystal clear with a golden orange hue. Head was not appropriate, but faded fairly quickly (due to high alcohol content?). Decent lacing.  S = We had a hard time placing the smell. Sort of a syrupy alcohol aroma - can definitely smell the booziness of this. Another reviewer said ""rum soaked bread"" - that might be a good description.  T = Balanced (not just a mouthful of hops). Some of that alcohol syrup taste comes through - just a very complex balance of flavors: citrus, hops, alcohol, etc. Wow.  M = Just slightly bitter feel to it and that lingering taste that tells you that you just had a very high ABV beer.  O = A very special beer for very special occasions.

10099,9086,Buschyfor3,4,"(Review from tasting notes)  Serving: 12oz bottle poured into my Duvel tulip  A: Pours with an orange-amber body; a miniscule wisp of off-white foam perches atop the body; retention is minimal, as there is nothing more than a collar left by the time I take my first sip.  S: Initial impressions of spicy hops, juicy citrus/resin, grapefruit, a dash of tropical fruit; nose gradually becomes sweeter as a honey and biscuit note develops; alcohol really perks up as the glass warms.  T: Interesting because you get the initial blast of hops, with pungent, juicy bite and an earthy/peppery spiciness, and then everything just turns sweet – syrupy sweet, even; notes of candied fruit, those orange slice gummy candies, citrusy/tropical notes, grapefruit, maybe pineapple, and definitely more than a heaping dose of orange blossom honey; alcohol cuts through the sweetness, but it is a dual-edged sword – it tries to balance out the sweetness, but it also starts to overtake the palate; even then, this is still much sweeter than I would expect for this big of an IPA; fiery on the finish – the alcohol really warms the back of the throat.  M: Very syrupy, oily mouthfeel that coats the palate; closer to what I would expect on an imperial stout than a DIPA.  O: To be honest, it is a task to finish a 12oz bottle – the alcohol is ever-present and combined with the sweetness and syrupy body, it is a daunting beer not only to describe, but to conquer. Sipping away for over an hour, and I’ve still got about a quarter of a glass left. Not sure how it will go down, as it is fully warmed to room temp, and that only seems to make the peppery bite of the alcohol even more intense.  To be fair, I won’t say this wasn’t worth trying – I was looking forward to the 120, as it is one of the revered, “pioneers” of big beer. But I think it is safe to say that once you have tried it, there really isn’t much need to revisit down the road.

Wow, now that is strong beer, you definitely notice the alcohol in the flavor but does not taste as strong as it is, but you do get the warmth as the beer goes down.

Medium bodied with a thick oily feel through the middle and hot, boozy finish.

10099,9086,Mr_Hoptimistic,4.71,"This brew had alluded me for over a year, but I was finally able to grab a bottle recently. I was excited to see it on the shelf and was more than happy to pay the $11.99 for one 12oz bottle.  A: I poured it into a Dogfish Head IPA glass which I purchased from their website. It didn't have much of a head, but the color was a beautiful deep honey and amber color. It had a nice oily lacing on the glass, too.  S: This was hard to describe. I couldn't pull out anything specific other than earthy hops, malty sweetness, and the slight sharpness of the alcohol.  T: Bam! It had the trademark balance of a true DFH IPA. The bitter hops and sweet malts blend together marvelously. It's boozy at the end, but at 18%, what could you expect? I let this come up to room temperature and at that point the edginess of the booze mellowed out, and it became as drinkable as their 60 or 90 minute IPA.  M: Light carbonation, somewhat syrupy, but nice.  O: This was a well crafted IPA. You can tell how much time and effort went into this ale. The $11.99 price was completely justifiable. Sam and his Dogfish crew know what they're doing down there in Delaware, and this beer was further proof. It's a must try. Beware, though. At 18% it has a tremendous punch.

10099,9086,JamesMN,3.75,"Bottled back in March.  Appearance: Semi-transparent deep honey color with some off-white suds.  Aroma: Drunken oranges and caramel. Bit of alcohol. Quite sweet.  Taste: Starts with sweet caramel malt and orangey hops. Back end is moderate hop bitterness and some heat from the 18% ABV. Finish is smooth and hot with an aftertaste of ebbing alcohol and orange/caramel with hop bitterness. More barleywine than DIPA.  Mouthfeel: Easily full in body with subtle carbonation and average drinkability for a beer of this magnitude.  Final Thoughts: After years of searching for the legendary 120 Minute IPA, I've finally gotten to try it. Since this is a beer that I never had incredibly high expectations for I thoroughly enjoyed it. Though I will say it is much more akin to the barleywine style. Not outstanding but very good.

Cool, 18% give or take, but I want flavors and there is just an overwhelming alcohol taste/nose burn from this that I cannot ignore. Don't get me wrong, I'm very happy I tried it and also glad I have a bottle to cellar, but overall, the experience of sharing a glass on tap and sharing a glass out of the bottle was just unpleasant. I love dogfish head, but this one, is not something I would seek out. There are plenty of great high-teen ABV beers and great high ABV IPAs that I would enjoy splitting with someone, but this tasting (actually these two) was more unenjoyable than all of them. Bottom line to me, is that there is a great deal of hype behind this beer. Maybe I just don't get it. Maybe I don't have the palate. But both my girlfriend and I, who do almost nightly tastings of new/different brews could not dig this either of the times we've had it.

The one I’m rating is 2 years and 2 days old. Dark auburn, minimal head and lacing. Muddy. Smell is malty and mildly lemony. Taste is pure malt, brown sugar, caramel, notes of dark fruit, a minimal hop presence, and hints of a boozy burn. Medium to big bodied, surprisingly crisp for a big beer, mouth watering, and while there’s a booze presence, it’s disguised well and sneaks up subtly.  Overall, it’s in a class by itself-is it the strongest IPA ever? Is it a really tasty Barleywine? Is it more booze than you should logically consume in a beer?  Yes.

10099,9086,yokken,5,"I will preface this review by saying that I don't think I've ever rated a beer a full 5. The idea of finding a ""perfect"" beer is a little ludicrous, if you ask me. Poured from a 12oz bottle @ ~40F into an oversized short wine glass.  Appearance: Oh my goodness. Absolutely stunning. As I poured, it was a brilliant, bright orange color that reached a glowing, deep orange in the middle, and then slightly lighter at the top. It reminded me of the color of a ripe papaya - just the most vibrant, brilliant, gorgeous shade of orange that I've ever seen in a beer.  Smell: Intoxicating. If I had a slightly larger/wider snifter, I would have used it here. However, the wine glass with the taper at the top helped to gather the smells… certainly more so than a regular pint glass. I picked up many tropical notes including orange, grapefruit, and perhaps a hint of cantaloupe. I’m no expert in isolating specific smells/flavors, but I could tell that there was a lot going on here. I won’t attempt to name 10 different fruits/smells, because at some point the majority of them blend together into a heavenly tropical smell.  Taste: Mind-blowing. It really is something out of a fantasy. An explosion of juicy, bright tropical fruits massaged my palate as I let the sip rest on my tongue for a few seconds to warm up and soak in. The malt takes a back seat as you would expect, with the bitterness of the hops pushing all the right buttons. I absolutely love IPAs and DIPAs, so I can appreciate a good balance between bitterness and flavor. I love a good hop bomb, but those are easy to make. It is much more difficult to make a balanced IPA. I don’t like my IPAs to be too bitter or resinous, but I also don’t like them to be completely floral or citrusy without any bite to back up the flavor. They really nailed it — it’s got the perfect bitterness, a subtle but present floral taste that could easily be missed, and the citrus and tropical flavors launching a full-on assault of the palate. The taste of DFH 120 is simply too good to be overstated.  Mouthfeel: The DFH 120 mouthfeel fits my ideal criteria. At first there was a bit of a bite, like excess carbonation combined with the high alcohol content. The carbonation is right on the money, though. Not too much or too little. It’s juicy enough to wet your palate, but dry enough to have the perfect amount of bite. The high ABV warms the palate as well, but it’s not as hot as I expected it to be. I’ve definitely had hotter mouthfeels from DIPAs and Imperial Stouts around 10-15% ABV. For comparison, Surly Sÿx was significantly hotter at the same temperature than the DFH 120. They got the balance just right with this one. I noticed that when I smiled, the alcohol gave a nice little burn on my gums. It seems inconsequential, but it added to the enjoyment of this brew a lot.  Overall: This beer nearly drove me to tears. It is truly extraordinary. All I could think while drinking it was ""WOW."" It’s taken me a while to write this review, because my experience was beyond words. I got into craft beer around 2-3 years ago, taking brewery tours, hunting down rare/seasonal beers, trading with friends, and having tasting parties with friends and coworkers. Sometimes I would pay around 3-4 times the amount of a good craft 6-pack for a single bomber/750mL bottle of a rare brew. People are always astonished at the price of some of the rarer beers, most of them saying something along the lines of “that’s so overpriced.” Sometimes I agree — there are definitely some overpriced beers that are not good enough to warrant a $20+ asking price for a 750mL. I treat these beers like liquid gold, making sure to savor every drop. The moment I took my first sip of DFH 120, I was flooded with memories of my first really fresh IPAs and DIPAs. It brought back the excitement I used to get from finding an incredible new brew that pushed all of the right buttons for me — beautiful colors, intoxicating smells, bitter floral and citrus flavors, and a juicy mouthfeel, leaning towards the dry side. Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA is everything that made me love craft beer in the first place. It has become my reference IPA. Something to compare all others to. Something to remember fondly. Something to define my tastes. It's hard to overstate my satisfaction.  Huge thanks to Dogfish Head for making one for the hardcore IPA fans. I think I can easily say that 120 Minute IPA has earned its way into one of my top 5 favorite beers of all time. If I’ve ever had anything close to a perfect beer, this is it. I’ve finally peaked. I guess that should make me sad because I don’t know if I’ll ever find anything more delicious, but it makes me happy, because I feel lucky to have been able to find, enjoy, and savor this exquisite brew over easily one of the best hours of my life. It is simply out of this world. It is everything that is craft beer. Bravo, Dogfish Head. Bravo.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,AyeMito,4.72,"Where do I start, this beer completely took me by surprise. Its bold but you can tell that just by reading the outside label. Pouring it and taking in it's aromas, my taste buds started salivating immediately. It has a very potent citrus and pine scent with a very enveloping tone of vanilla and herbs giving it a sturdy weight. The actual taste itself lives up to it's aroma completely. It is very rich with a powerful hop flavor! I picked up on some of the finer notes of vanilla, spice, raisin, and a slight mineral flavor all wrapped up in tangy notes of orange and pine. I love this beer. It is truly complex and makes you think about what your drinking. In my opinion, enjoy this one like a fine scotch or bourbon. Just a few sips and I got a head buzz from all those hops! warm it up a little in your glass and your golden. I plan on buying a couple more bottles and letting them age.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,delta490,4.23,"Pours a deep clouded amber with just a thin ring of head around the top. The aroma is interesting. The aclohol esters are strong and sweet, balancing against a floral note. The big 18% ABV comes up loud in the taste, as well, dominating initially and fading out quickly. The remainder of the flavor is hard to describe. The bad is full and thick and smooth. This is one to sip and enjoy, if for no other reason than it retails $10 or more a bottle.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,brewdlyhooked13,4.88,"bottled on 5/10/07 for consumption on 7/21/14  Appearance - pours a muddy, brackish plum-brown. Just a faint cover of bubbles, barely sustaining a collar.  Aroma - rum-soaked shortbread and caramel. A boozy citrusy element that is not like Grand Marnier, but it makes me think of it just the same. A touch of plums and soy.  Taste - hard Christmas candy with the weird fruit filling. Light citrus but its there. Extremely warming in the throat and belly, mmm. A light smack of hops, not near enough to balance, just gives a little nip. Some light soy and/or anise as well. Lots of fun flavors to pick out and enjoy. Unbelievably easy to drink for its strength. Yes, the alcohol is certainly evident but the beer's flavors are plenty intense and integrated enough for it to work out wonderfully.  Mouthfeel - impressive carbonation seven+ years later. The body is big without becoming heavy, which could lend too much weight to the sugary aspects of the beer.  Overall - Excellent stuff at both three and seven years, I'll give a new bottle a whirl next time, though I suspect fresh hops rule the day. Toasting 20K on the fitbit - cheers! ***  2003 Edition sampled on 3/18/06 Appearance - pours a clouded light orange color, a snappy but short-lived head on top. 3.5  Aroma - a new experience on this one. I pick up the initial expected fruit and booziness, though not to the degree I expected. But then I get this unmistakeable spicy aroma. A cooking spice, what is it, I know the smell...then it hits my brain - curry! Are my hands clean? Sure enough, and I just washed out the glass from my last beer. Sniff again - curry again. Perhaps this is the effect on my senses when hops get over-saturated into a beer? I don't know. I like curry but I am unsure of what to expect on the taste. 3.5  Taste - wow. No curry here, but this is in the 'beer candy' genre. Intensely sweet, as if it's been concentrated. Orange candy, honey, pineapple, some mildly spicy hop component, and now and then a breath of that curry, but barely. Big alcohol finish, but not as brash as I thought it'd be. Beautifully supportive of the hops flavor, I don't think I can remember a beer being so hoppy and yet so sweet instead of bitter. Without fail, every time I take a sip, I get a whiff of that curry, but it generally does not appear in the flavor profile with any force. Finishes wet, warm and coating. 5  Mouthfeel - very thick, the carbonation holds its own among the heavyweight flavors. 5  Drinkability - I am so glad I grabbed this and am hopeful that I can wait another 5 or 6 years to sample the other one. 5",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,kfh227,2.4,This beer is one I sought out for a while.  Here's the simple straight dope in terms of all i care about ...taste. This was basically the 90 minute turned into a boiler maker. That is my opinion in terms of both taste and alcohol content. You could taste the alcohol and it was not ggood.and my I'm ediate reaction was that it tastes like a boiler maker.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Tsar_Riga,4,"A - Nothing out of ordinary here for a IIPA. Orange, slight haze, but mostly transparent, with a short, tight head, almost white, which resolves to a line around the rim, with only minor lacing.  S - First came a hint of banana, but after that, the alcohol is front and center, with a strong pine element, and a slight hint of lemon.  T - There is a mild boozy note throughout, but primarily the hop resin is paired with a sugary malt backbone. The flavors are big, but the close is not ferocious, and the bitterness is contained.  M - No way I'd guess this is 18% ABV, but it does feel much more thick and oily than a standard super-hopped IIPA. Big carbonation on the tongue, I could literally feel the bubbles pop as I took my first drink. Which may explain how this beer can have that oily feel without blanketing the tongue after a couple sips.  O - Unique, and no doubt extreme. Very well built, the malts and sugars keep the hops from exploding in a bitter supernova, meaning you get a chance to actually taste the layers of malt and hop and appreciate the elements. I cannot say, with all the IIPAs in the world, that this is the one I'll reach for first, but I can respect the craft and effort without necessarily thinking this is my go-to brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Talk2Bill,4.51,This beer has intense layers of flavors from sweet to citrus to malty bitterness. After a few sips the bitterness of the hops gives way to the more complex flavors. At 15% ABV it packs a punch: It hangs pretty heavy in the mouth and has more alcohol burn that I expected. It is something even an experienced beer drinker may want to work up to. And this is not to be taken lightly.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Scott_Anderson_,4.15,"This is a monster beer. It pours an orange amber with minimal head on the glass, about one finger. The krausen attenuates early but lingers with good lacing throughout. The aroma is one of my favorite characteristics. You get a ton of citrus off the bottle, which amplifies as you pour. The malt aroma eventually overwhelms and you end up with a subtle, but very nice, earthiness. The taste is amazing. Citrus up front, which gives way to malt and ends in butterscotch. The mouthfeel is heavy. You can literally feel the malt on your tongue. Overall, it is hard to believe 120 is an IPA. It is complex but very drinkable. It's easy to see why this is the beer that Dogfish hangs its hat on.  *Beer burps taste like Werthers Originals",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,WhiteHillsStore,4.34,"A very angry beer. Pours dark amber with a very thin head. The smell had a lot of booze in it but also bits of hop and citrus escaped. The taste was very sweet from the booze but after the initial reaction you get a lot of subtle and amazing notes through the beer. A lot of toasted malt and even some lemon. Something everyone should try once, maybe even a couple more.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,ThePaintedGrey,4.08,"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass, serving as a replacement for my dearly departed snifter.  *Let it be noted that this is not an aged bottle. This batch was bottled in April, 2014.*  A: A deep bronze color with some crimson-orange tints as well. Head started out at about two-fingers, but quickly faded down to a gorgeously creamy cap, bone white in hue. Not a ton of lacing down the glass, but the small section that's there sits quite thick on the glass. Not world class aesthetics, but definitely a pretty looking beverage.  S: The aroma isn't as boisterous as I expected honestly. This particular batch, according to word of mouth and not an actual source, is sitting in at roughly 19% ABV. Even with that said, there's not an overwhelming amount of booze in the nose. A light hint of booze, with your almost average top-tier DIPA aroma. Some citrusy profiles, mostly grapefruit, melded with some orange peel and a juicy peach undertone, all balanced on a sweet malt backbone.  T: Holy hell... This is /extreme/. There's so much going on here. It goes without saying that the hops are very upfront in the initial sip. A huge wave of mixed juice flavor bombards—grapefruit, orange, hints of lemon, and some peach. Given the fact that I'm a strict beer drinker that doesn't delve into liquors, it's taken me almost 20 minutes to be able to decipher what's going on here in this 19% ABV behemoth. Hearing this mentioned in the past, I've heard stories of candy-like sweetness, but perhaps that comes through aging? The only sweetness here is a comfortable amount of caramel malt that breaks through the belligerent hop presence. A strong alcoholic burn comes through in the finish for me (which might not be a problem to those accustomed to whiskey). The aftertaste is strong and citrusy, and maybe my mind is deceiving me, but I'm detecting almost a cinnamon-like heat in the lingering flavor. The complexity of this beer is truly a marvel in itself.  M: The mouthfeel here, as expected, is huge. It's not syrupy or sticky, but it's HUGE. A full-bodied leviathan that is devilishly smooth and creamy, given it's alcohol content. A perfect level of carbonation adds a little bit of crispness to it all. This is the star-quality of this beer, and it's a truly a testament to the craftsmanship of the folks down at DFH brewery.  O: I know that I scored the taste and mouthfeel really high, but I feel as though this beer is just a tad bit TOO much, and therefore the overall score suffers a little bit as a result. Let not that be an insult to the brewers: the folks down at Dogfish Head are absolute artists when it comes to beer and have crafted an absolute behemoth of a beverage here. The complexity in the flavor is off-the-charts, and the mouthfeel is absolutely a work of art for a beer of its stature. However, with that being said, DFH 120 Minute, in all of its over-the-top glory, strikes me as a strictly once in a blue moon treat. Something this intense needs to truly be savored and simply can not be enjoyed regularly. I will be purchasing another bottle to age for a few years, and may not find myself drinking it again until said bottle is sufficiently aged.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Wortman1998,3.59,"Was not expecting this. It's really hard to put this in the class with other Imperial IPA's that I enjoy so much. At first smell, I knew that this was something very different. A boozy, almost bourbon smell - nice, but wow! The appearance was a very clear copper with good carbonation. Taste was nice at first, (by the end of the bottle, I had enough) with a real malty sweetness and a really subdued hop character - hard to believe that the IBU's on this are at 120. Very nice tasting - sweet, with a warmth like a distilled whiskey. I can't say that I didn't enjoy it. I did, it took me around an hour to sip through 12 ounces. I'm glad I tried it.

M: Viscous, bitter, spicy, and feels somewhat syrupy.  O: Perhaps this would be better after sitting a while. Not my cup-o-tea. Reminds me very little of a typical IPA. Everything about this beer is too extreme, really just a novelty - but I already understood that prior to purchasing. Would likely be a drain-pour if I hadn't paid almost $10 for it.

10099,9086,beergoot,4.06,"Re-visited March 30th, 2021  With an unknown ABV (why doesn't Dogfish Head list it on their bottle labels or web site?), the head is pretty stellar for a high ABV beer; partially cloudy; orange-amber body; head is dense and creamy; sheets of finely grained foam coat the glass. Big malt nose reminiscent of a strong English styled ale. Rich and malty flavor; some ester presence; muted note of alcohol; some phenols; light bitterness. Heavy body rich in residual sugars.  Bottle date stamp: 'BOTTLE ON 07/10/20 1815'. Big improvement in the looks, a mild downgrade in flavor. -----------  Original review July 7th, 2014  Original ratings: 3.5 3.75 4.5 4.0 4.0  The body appears clear with a solid gold-copper color and sports a thin white head. There is a spicy hop aroma along with notes of peach and apricot; caramel. The taste crams in a lot of hop bitterness yet also has plenty of rich, deeply sweet malt sugar sweetness; toffee and dried apricot flavors; twinges of citrus zing. Medium-heavy body; semi-sweet with a strong hop dryness.  If hop bitterness blended with a deep, rich malt sweetness is your thing, then this beer is bound to deliver the goods. Depth and complexity becomes apparent with every sip. Just when you think you have the taste and aroma components nailed, another sip brings new ones to the fore. I'm getting a lot of rich, well-aged orange notes right now. In any case, this beer is big and bountiful and sure to please.  Late note: and I see where this beer is usually sporting a 15-20% ABV (per Dogfish's web site - my bottle does not list the %). and the label states it ages well (no kidding, with this hop profile and ABV!). and this probably explains my slightly off-kilter frame of mind while typing, reviewing this beer, and grooving to a Blue Note Hank Mobley CD that just came in the mail from Europe...well, the point is, this is a powerhouse beer, done up nicely, and worth exploring in a myriad of ways...",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Tastes of the big hops and malts. Hops lead off with citrus and pine notes with a decent amount of bitterness. Malts come next and add caramel, toasted bread, and fairly sweet giving an orange feel to the middle. Leans more towards the sweet end of the spectrum. Booze is present, but not overbearing.  Mouthfeel is full with a smooth amount of carbonation.

Far less boozy than I expected. 18% ABV is arguably well-hidden. Not for chugging, but drinkable. It’s a sipper if only because of the price!  M: Heavy, sticky, gooey. Good-syrupy. Again, little carbonation.  O: It’s a great beer and I’m glad I found some to try out.

T: Intensely sweet, lots of caramel. Hoppy bitterness towards the finish, but not nearly what I expected. Some notes of sugar and toffee, but not overwhelmingly sweet.  M: Medium body, with a very smooth feel, mildly carbonated. While the flavor is not boozy, the burn of the alcohol is noticeable in the feel.  O: As others have said, I have a hard time classifying this as an IPA. So the recipe and process are IPA, but the result is a barley wine (in my opinion). That said, this is a sipping beer, it simply cannot be quaffed. It is well balanced, and very restrained considering the claimed 18% ABV.

10099,9086,blackcompg,4.11,"So I've heard that you need to try this fresh, and to try it aged... I've had this bottle for 16 months now, no idea what to expect, here we go...  Appearance - Pours about a finger of golden yello foam that quickly comes down to a solid cap. Body is a slightly hazy amber orange, and I'm getting some decent webbed lacing as I work thru the glass - surprising and impressive for such a high ABV beer.  Smell - Huge fruity notes, especially pit fruits of peach and plum, also getting rich malts, honey, and even some brown sugar. Now some floral hops coming through, and some earthiness, and some warm alcohol in the nose.  Taste - Wow - Big sweet peaches and plums, candied orange peels, sweet ruby red grapefruit juice. Warm caramels ar along for the entire ride, then suddenly there is a noticeable warmth as the alcohol begins to assert. Finally some of the sweetness drops off a bit and fruitskin peels add a bit of sour astringency. Longer into the finish I get the light dry bitter nuanced of peach and plum pits.  Mouthfeel - Definitely full, and feels heavy in the mouth, but not especially mouth coating. Carb here is nearly medium, and tingles with sharp fizzy edges all across the tongue, and can be felt far down the back of the throat. Definitely a good alcohol presence but it fits well with the full fruity flavors and the abundance of sweetness. Definitely a sipper.  Overall - Okay, so I'm enjoying this aged 120 Minute - and will now find a fresh bottle to compare. This aged version is very sweet and fruity, really reminding me of the flavors I get with old and strong ales, much like an ultra-amped version of Old Curmudgeon or Third Coast Old Ale.

Again not overly hoppy, but the flavour lingers throughout.  Medium-thick mouthfeel with a dry burn from the high ABV on the finish.  This is a fantastic IIPA, but is dominantly malty and boozy.

There's no denying this beer's similarity to a barleywine.  T - A warm booziness follows a strong dried fruit note which is further followed by a keen lingering bitterness and alcohol burn. This—and the warming buzziness that comes along with it—is the only hint at just how strong this beer is. It's incredibly well balanced.  M - Thick and lingering. Think of half and half vs. non fat milk  O - An extraordinary beer from our friends at Dogfish. It really is remarkable just how much care and passion goes into this little bottle. Honestly, I would rate this in the top ten beers that I've ever had the pleasure of tasting and a world-class beer that truly stands on it's own. I'm still not sure if I'd call this an IPA or even a triple IPA. It's more of a cross between a double IPA and an american barley wine. I'm glad that I finally had the chance to try this fresh. I've been cellaring a couple of bottles for over a year. Looks like it's time for a vertical tasting!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,BeerZombies1,3.75,"120 Minute IPA - Dogfish Head Imperial IPA 18% ABV 120 IBU  APPEARANCE: Pours a very inviting golden honey, with shimmering orange highlights and flashes or a deep ruby red. The great big billowy head had amazing retention for being such a high abv. Nice lacing all the way through.  AROMA: Smells exactly like a barelywine with the big malty front that consumes your nose. Honey comb cereal from when I was kid, with the combination of sweetness and biscuity graininess. Light brown sugar and a faint floral aroma lingers on the end.  TASTE: As expected in this big beer the taste follows the nose exact. Huge huge sweet malty explosion with a honey, caramel, vanilla flavor blend going on. Can't believe this is 120 IBU beer I'm having trouble even detecting hops. I do get some citrus, orange, perhaps dried peaches which I didn't detect at all on the nose. Faint spice and surprisingly no heat from that high ABV.  MOUTHFEEL: Heavy body with a medium carbonation. Creamy and really expands in the mouth. Syrupy and oily with a unexpected dry finish.  OVERALL: I still feel this taste and drinks like a barley wine. Very sweet and warms the body so nicely. It is very easy to drink with the 18% I will applaud that. I have another that I going to age for a while and see if it changes the flavor profile on it at all.  RATING: 3.75/5 Zombie Heads!!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Zekenyce,4.44,Perfection!!! Took me over a year to finally obtain. But it was definitely worth the wait and every penny of the $12 I paid. One of the best tasting beers I've ever had. Still can't believe that it's 18 % ABV. Disappointed that the Liquor Store limits the quantity to 1 bottle and that's only for elite customers.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,TheStBernard,4.83,"A: Dark and golden, with a very minimal head, and murkiness. Gorgeous all the way, and indicative of great things to come on the smell and taste.  S: Its so boozy that the other smells are nearly masked. Still, notes of hops (obviously), raisins, apricot, raisins, and other dried fruits; walnuts, and a touch of smoke. It almost reminds me of a great plate of charcuterie., which I love.  T: Mmmmm... just so tasty and boozy and hoppy and incredible. Very smokey, with a hint of, again, dried fruit.  M: A nice carbonation that gives way to an array complexity and booziness. So much alcohol and I love it.  O: Am I drunk already? I can't tell, but god this is a good beer. I'm so lucky to try this at the end of a rough year of law school.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Spiffaz,4.41,"My first review! YAY beer!  This beer is ridiculous. It reminds me a bit of the World Wide Stout due to similarity to Barley Wine. I can understand why people have said it's not really a beer. If nothing else, try this (ten bucks at my local beer shop) just for the experience.  A - Nice foam that slowly fades, good clarity, but the color is what makes this guy shine. It looks like honey, and says ""Drink me.""  S - Just the smell makes you drunk. Potent and sweet. I get fruit notes mixed with alcohol, like when you leave figs in the fridge too long.  T - This is one of those beers where the exhale is half the fun. Like I said, I get some Barley Wine taste going on. Don't forget this has (if memory serves) 120 IBU, so be prepared.  M - A bit syrupy, which just isn't something I especially like. It's got a great mouth-coating, long finish though, so if that's your thing you'll love this beer.  O - Buy this. Drink it. Learn something about beer. It's worth the money. Side Note - Don't F around with this beer, it's 15% ABV so have a DD if you're having this outside the home.  Yay beer!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,mjpolzin,4,"Very glad that I finally got the opportunity to try this beer.  I actually thought it had more in common with a heavily hopped barleywine than an IPA. It had a pretty sweet malty taste and a decent amount of hop flavor and aroma. I may seek out another bottle to age but with the hefty price tag, I would go out of my way to find it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,drdiesel9483,4.59,"Look - golden orangish color slightly cloudy w non stop slow moving bobbles. Smell - slightly hoppy smell, slight alcohol smell, citrus overtones. Taste - so much taste. Good amount hops, fairly thick, can taste some alcohol in it. Good citrus floral taste. For being 18% alcohol I'm surprised how little alcohol you taste. Well balanced for sure. Feel - smooth and creamy with great carbonation. Overall- great beer but cost to much money for 12oz. If I find it again ill age it and see what I think different.  At dogfish head going 60, 90, 120. 2017 Look - only thing I'd add to above is great skimming Smell - very light scent, see above for more Taste - this one is 16.5% but still lots of booze, pretty much what I said above Feel - same as above but I need to add that it has a warming alcohol fell.

10099,9086,Capperryone,4.02,"This beer does have an excellent taste, but man is it powerful for a beer. The alcohol content in this beer seems to over power the hops that are supposed to be present. This is the self proclaimed ""holy grail for hopheads"" and I won't disagree with that necessarily, but I will say that the hops do get lost a bit in the high alcohol content. That being said, This is an excellent beer and I will definitely and gladly drink it again. Dogfish Head continues to do excellent stuff!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,fgmiele,4.07,Sweeter nose than anticipated..almost throws me off for an IPA to smell this sweet. Start to smell the hops as you breathe in deeper. Booze smell is very prominent. Golden amber hue is ideal..slightly foamy head and surprisingly creamy - not thin at all. Taste is very boozy and hops are almost overpowered by the booze. Overall I'd say this beer packs quite the powerful punch and is not reminiscent to 60 or 90 min WHATSOVER imo..although you have to appreciate what it takes to make a beer like this one. Definitely a sipper.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,TheSleepyMonkey,4.79,"On tap poured into snifter at DFH release party in Memphis.  Beautiful, caramel colored brew. Shades of dark orange and light ruby. 1 finger of sticky head, laces nicely.  Smells great, though not overwhelmingly hoppy. Smells of floral notes, peaches, alcohol, and biscuits. Lots in there  Not a hop bomb to me. You definitely taste the hops, but it's very well balanced, almost sweet. Tastes like an aged barleywine. Boozy but not as hot as you would think at 18%. Really surprising tastes here, fig, bread, citrus, floral finish.  Mouthfeel is right on for a barleywine, though not as crisp as a DIPA. Malty thicker backbone.  Pleasantly surprised here. Not exactly what expected, actually better! Absolute must try. Cheers!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,ThisWangsChung,4.16,"12 oz bottle into a tulip. From notes.  A: Pours a clear copper color, with a finger worth of off-white colored head. The alcohol legs are nice, and the retention is incredible for such a big beer. There's even lacing left on the glass!  S: Huge caramel malt sweetness is the first thing I notice. Other notes of tobacco, leather, pine, and alcohol. I'd surmise this is a touch restrained for 18% - but it's restrained in all the right ways. Not bad at all!  T: This is intensely caramely, with a subtle leafy bitterness and a mild burn. For 18%, this isn't particularly boozy. There are also nice notes of nut, brown sugar, and toffee. I half expected this to be a shamelessly sweet, brute force monster similar to DFH's Olde School - instead, it's just restrained/balanced enough to be shockingly easy to sip.  M: When taking the gentle alcohol prickle out of the picture, the beer's texture is smooth, creamy, thick, and soft. Is this really 18%? Not only am I surprised by the (relative) lack of booze, I'm even more surprised how the residual sugars don't linger oppressively. Carbonation is mild.  O: This is NOT an IPA, not at all. It's a barleywine, and a damn good one. Like a lot of DFH offerings, I expected little enjoyment. However, this is genuinely my favorite offering from them. Hey DFH, more beers like this and less beers with moon dust!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

This is a great beer and is one I will age and try years from now.. If you find it, get it. I would say Three Floyds Dreadnaught is the closest to this, but without the FFF signature crispness and taste. Love both beers, this is a must have I think.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

10099,9086,BoardwalkBock,4.27,"12 oz bottle dated 02/17/14 poured into pint glass  A: This bad boy just looks intense. Big ruby and orange colors. The colors almost look divided like a density gradient. Odd but cool. Darker ruby towards the bottom. Tons of carbonation. 1 finger head.  S: Well the first thing that hits the nose is alcohol. This is followed up by a big malt backbone, some citrus, very slight grapefruit. I hope the taste is a little less forward on the alcohol.  T: Worries out the door. The beer opens up with a huge hop forwardness. Citrus, papaya, grapefruit, pine. Malt is gigantic and almost overtakes the hops until they fade back in towards the end. The alcohol comes in as the hops start to come back in. Alcohol is not too bad, and this beer is surprisingly very well balanced on the taste front.  M: Pretty heavy for an IIPA, but is to be expected. Almost like a barleywine in mouthfeel. Huge carbonation and nice bitterness rounds out the alcohol.  O: Overall, I am enjoying this beer very much. I purchased one bottle a few months ago to celebrate with after passing my comprehensive exams for my master's degree, and I am very glad I chose this beer. I've always loved DFH IPA's, and had always wanted to try the 120. This beer is extremely well balanced considering how much alcohol is in this beer.

I smell lemon, orange, lime, nothing but citrus. Of course the hops, but I had an over powering scent of citrus.  Taste: Hollly cow, citrus...again. Very powerful citrus taste. I was surprised. Very boozy, and becomes even more boozy as the beer warms. I like boozy. Hoppy, yes, but the booze and citrus flavor are the most potent in this one.  Mouthfeel: Thicker than I expected an IPA to be.  Overall: I'm not a big IPA guy, but Dogfish head makes my favorite IPA's, and they're my go to brewery for IPA's.

10099,9086,Soncheebs,3.61,"Appearance:A beautiful medium amber that darkens at its core, an offwhite head a finger deep that stays active albeit subtle throughout the sit, with moderate lacing.  Smell: Plums and raisins soaked in ethanol. Feint malted caramel/figs/coffee. Complex, blunt but intriguing.  Taste: You really get hit with this kind of over saturated malty, sticky, overly sweet fig/raisin taste and then it sort of never goes away and instead finishes soaked in its wet hops with enough alcohol to remind you of why they recommend you limit yourself to just one.  Mouthfeel: As much as it's carbonated (and it is heavily) it still doesn't finish timely or crisp because this beer is so syrupy.  Overall: Dogfish brought me into the game of IPA's and after drinking them so heavily for the last 6 years I've wondered if there would be one that I could retire on saying that it's the ""cream of the crop"". And while I haven't lost faith in the brand nor the beer, this years 120 minute was sup par for me.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,itsscience,3.78,"It pours a completely opaque muddy orange color with a thin white head. The nose has pine forest, mango, lemon candy, caramel, molasses, and a touch of char. There's a HUGE hop characteristic to the taste with grapefruit, apricot, orange juice, and orange peel notes. Pitted against that is a cloying sweet malt backbone with molasses and burnt sugar. A lot is going on here and it's overpowering on the palate. The body is full, rich, and boozy: it tastes like someone took a bag of those orange slice jelly candies, liquefied them, and added rum. I also get the taste of plums and raisins, so it has some flavors that are not typically found in double IPAs or other hoppy beers.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Poured a much lighter color then I was expecting for being 18%. The nose was a little boozy, but I could smell the IPA behind it. The taste is not what I was expecting at all. It was DELICIOUS! The booze didn't come out in this one and the hops were still incredibly tasty. This was a white whale for me, having always wanted to try it. It was a real joy to try and this was the favorite of everyone out of the 5 rare's that we tried.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,JerzDevl2000,4.21,"Picked this up in Totowa a few weeks back, never having this before. I can't say that I've enjoyed anything quite like this, as this beer completely caught me off-guard. Yes, it's strong and yes, there are hops underneath all of this but it's not a hop-bomb and like the Bell's Hopslam, this one crept up on me both in taste and in strength. It's not like anything else on the shelf as the ""IPA"" is quite a misnomer!  This had a gorgeous, apricot hue to it with a solid head that filled up the remainder of my pint glass, and lacing that made itself known after my first few sips. Lots of booze, light citrus, and apricot on the nose with more of the latter in the taste. Toss in a Barleywine taste, some roasted caramel malt, a hint of bitter chocolate, and some faint weed-like skunk and this turned out to be a winner when it came to my taste buds. The carbonation was near-perfect a hint of honey sweetness kept this light from start to finish, as well.  It certainly, certainly did not hurt that the alcohol was quite recessed here; so much so that I don't think I've ever had a beer where what I felt and what the actual ABV% was were completely different from each other. I could have downed a few of these in a sitting but there's no way I'd still be sitting up straight at that point. This was brewed on 2/17 of this year and boy,did it still taste fresh. If it were possible to brew mead and toss in some floral and earthy hops and then add some Belgian sweetness in for good measure, this would be the end result. Nothing on the shelf is quite like this and this is one of those beers that has to be sensed to be believed. A really wonderful surprise here!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,larryarms847,4,"Pours a dark golden orange yellow with a thin layer of off-white foam. Noticeable alcohol legs.  Bready and caramel malt sweetness with an explosion of bitter hop resins and some definitely alcohol heat.  Very barleywine like, huge sweet caramel and bready malt bill with loads of bitter hop resins.  Medium-bodied, low carbonation, sweet, bitter, hot, warming.  Overall, a serious sipper here.

10099,9086,tviz33,4.25,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle in to a snifter. I was lucky enough to find this at Lewis Bros. in Horseheads, NY. Fresh out of the fridge, I let this beer sit for about ten minutes before drinking. Bottled on 2/17/14.  A- The brew pours an opaque copper body with a little white frothy cap that hangs around for quite a while.  S- The aroma is so different than any beer I've ever smelled. I spent a good 5 minutes with my nose stuck in it. Yes, there is a bit of grapefruit and the typical DIPA stuff, but they take a back seat to a sort of sweet, woodsy aroma accompanied by just a little bit of alcohol presence. I can't hold back any longer, I just have to take a sip!  T- No amount of review reading can prepare you for the taste. Totally unique. My first sip was a big one, and I immediately noticed the alcohol. My next sip was a bit smaller and this time the hops really flexed their muscles. This isn't the ""palate-wrecking"" (for lack of a better term) type of hop character that a typical DIPA has. Here a powerful hop flavor of most pine sap mingles with a huge sweetness that tempts you to down the whole thing extremely quickly. The alcohol is there, but I notice less with each sip. The warming is quite nice.  M- Full-bodied to the max, especially as far as DIPAs are concerned. Light to medium carbonation. Thick and oily.  O- This beer should be a bucket list item for everyone. Not to be drank regularly, but enjoyed to celebrate an occasion or after a hard day's work. This thick mother F-er even sticks to your lips and you can taste the hops again after your sip! Just try it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,CHickman,4.05,"Bottled in 2011: Pours a slightly hazy amber color with chunks floating in it and a 1 finger tan head that was full of bubbles and faded after a few minutes, leaving minimal spotty lacing.  Smells was not as hoppy as I expected, in fact it had no hop aroma and smelled more like booze or a barleywine than an IPA. Rich malt, caramel, dark rum, dark fruit, pine cone, brown sugar and alcohol make up the nose with very little hop essence coming through; the age must have really turned everything to sugar as it smells very sweet and boozy.  Taste is also more like booze or a barleywine than an IPA. There are more hops present in the flavor, but this is still almost cloyingly sweet and not the massive hop attack I expected. It is very complex with a mix of dark fruits soaking in rum or starting to rot, malt, caramel, syrup, dark rum, pine cone, brown sugar, herbs or some light spices, warm orange juice (with the pulp in it) and alcohol. There is no hiding or denying the alcohol, it comes at you like a gorilla pounding it’s chest to state it’s there. After each sip there is the alcohol burn with mild warming heat that’s not abrasive, leading to other flavors like the yeast/penny taste, honey, lightly toasted grains and some more booze soaked fruit.  Mouthfeel is thick, chewy and heavy, with a dense body, very mild carbonation and only a slightly bitter aftertaste that was just as malty and boozy as it was sweet.  I remember it being better in the past, so perhaps I’ll have to get a fresh bottle and try it as this was way too sweet and syrupy, and devoid of the massive hops used to make it. Strong ale or barleywine would be a better classification for what I just drank as there were not any IPA characteristics in the brew I just consumed. Overall it was OK, but nothing special.  7/4/14-Bottled on 3/18/14: Pours hazy gold amber color with a 2 finger foamy light tan head that faded slowly and left great foamy lace coating the sides and a foamy layer on top. Much better head and appearance than expected based on the ABV, it looks great since it’s only 3 months old.  Smells of massive hops, booze and caramel sweetness, but there is no hop distinction, just hops. Grapefruit, candy and pineapple seem to define the nose along with the booze and sweetness, but this smells much better fresh than it did aged.  Flavor is sweet overall, but the citrus and piney hops seem fresh and juicy, and then there are floral and herbal notes that let the dry hopping come through and shine. After the hop bombardment, there are sweet toffee, caramel, brown sugar and malty notes that try to add balance but basically just contain the ABV and make it drinkable/sipable. It’s over the top, but tasty and extremely complicated at the same time, making for an adventurous brew. More like a Barleywine than an IPA, the sweetness is almost like a fruit shake with gummy bears and rum jammed into a blender, but it still manages to mask the 18% ABV very well; smells more boozy than it tastes.  Mouthfeel is thick and chewy, like a hop bisque with honey and molasses in it, mild carbonation and a slick feel that trails off very sweet and hoppy. This beer is much better fresh and I’m glad I had a few fresh bottles this spring since the aged bottle I had in March did not impress me. This 3 month old bottle was great so my view is to drink this beer fresh. This review raised the overall scores across the board here on BA, as this is how I recall this beer being when I first had it years ago. Buy it fresh and drink it.

10099,9086,kaufmaal,4.54,"This one was a gift, and much appreciated. Pours a hazy orange, like watered-down, golden orange soda. Very minimal head - just a thin rim around the glass. Very tiny bubbles on the bottom gradually expand on their trip to the top; it's like watching an out-take from the closing moments of 2001: A Space Odyssey.  Deep, woodsy caramel aroma. Some pine, some dark rum. I let this one warm a bit, and the alcohol smell is more pronounced, really the only negative.  It's a very pleasing initial taste: Very sweet, slightly bitter, and intensely hoppy. Then a ton of ripe fruit: plums, bananas. Some gumball flavors, brown sugar, more rum. The alcohol really is present in the vapors, and I'm not tasting an alcohol burn or even a liquor-type burn. This tastes like a beer.  This is one that is a pleasure to sip and savor. It's an IPA, a heavy one, but the carbonation is perfect in that is creates a lightness where its needed and allows the flavors to breathe, expand, and work.  I'm a happy camper. Too bad it is not in Alabama.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,bryanbullock,4.8,"*This review is intended to both instill anecdotal worship and fear*  I must start my review to stating that after an long arduous day at work I knew that the 120 minute in the fridge was going to be the right option to take the edge off. I must first state that I went into my drink with awe inspiring fear based off a previous experience.  To understand the sense of trepidation I am compelled to explain, at the fledging stages of my craft beer educational a few years ago in a far away land called Delaware and decided nothing would be better than a trip to the Dogfishead Brewery, the brewery was awesome. We did some tasting and tried some new things and upon departure, a white light shined from the heavens and drew me towards the golden pyramid of 120 minute IPA. At junction I had only ever had 60 minute IPA so my logic dictated that if 60 minute IPA was awesome then 120 had to be twice as awesome. So the beer gods guided my hand the register and back home to the hot tub never stopping to read a review or consider the alcohol content could be different.  I cracked open the first 120 around 5pm and before 6pm they were all, gone. I do not recall much of my thoughts on my first tasking but judging by the speed they were extinguished I can safely assume I thoroughly enjoyed them. Shortly after I can only tell you what my companions told me as I do not recall the rest of the events of the evening. Apparently I cooked a steak and some tuna, but unable to tell the difference I added sesame seeds to my steak and A1 to my tuna. Then proceeded to play Jenga was but astonished that the game was obviously rigged as I could not get one block out without the tower toppling to the floor.  The next morning during quite refection and the sound of bongs beating internally in my head I decided to look at the abv to see what happened, 20 percent! yow! I then decided beer math was in order, yikes I drank the equivalent of 20 miller lites in less than an hour. From this moment 120 minute IPA became my great white whale.  Years later I decided the moment had come for Ahab to conquer Moby Dick, and this moment was yesterday evening. With the eurphoria of a kid at Christmas overtaking the underlying sense of fear I dove in.  The color was a milky golden hue indicating a think and robust beer. The aroma had a mild smell of alcohol but was far less than one would assume for such a strong abv. The malt and caramel smells did an amazing job of hiding the strong alcohol content, and the thick frothy head maintained that solid aroma from start to finish. The mouthfeel was smooth as silky and the taste was a balanced melding of sweet malt backbone what strong hops and mild caramel and fruit undertones. The beer was balanced from start to finish, and left you wanting more.  BUT, proceed with caution, this beer is so easy to drink that you may feel ""a few more won't hurt"" , but this beer will ""Cure what ALES ya"" and then some!  A must drink!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Very unique. Less than a month old. This young beer, with all of its residual sweetness should be very interesting after some aging, but that said it is a “drink-now” beer. 4.75  A – Pours a cloudy pale golden with a one-finger white head – IMO a great looking head for a beer with such a high ABV. Good lacing as well. An extra 0.25 for such beauty with a high ABV. 5.0  S – Hoppy, but not the hop bomb aroma one might expect. Pine, orange blossom, sweetness, malt. Equal parts malt and hops. 4.5  T – A nice hoppy start with a sweet alcohol laced (but not solventy) finish. Balanced.

It is bold, has a lot of character and you can certainly taste the alcohol. However, unlike most beers, the strong alcohol flavor takes nothing away from the taste. If anything, it adds to it. This is a beer that you want to sip on and if possible, condition if for a while as it ages very well. Overall, this is one of the best beers around.

By smelling this, you know it’s going to be a big one. Taste Strong malt and hop presence, quite the kick of flavors. It sure has a “wow” factor. There was a really strong alcohol presence in the finish. Overall I had to pick this up when I saw it for the first time. I wasn’t sure what I would think of it but it was Dogfish’s fabled 120 minute so I had to buy it... For $20.00 for one 12oz bottle.

10099,9086,argock,3.53,"Poured from a 12 oz brown bottle into a clear glass snifter. Bottled on 07/22/11 on the bottleneck. Purchased at Wine Warehouse (Charlottesville, VA).  A: Hazy bordering on cloudy amber with a pretty decent oatmeal colored 1-finger head on the pour which fades quickly and leaves no lace.  S: The aroma is of an American barleywine with heavy caramel malt sweetness and a somewhat passive floral and citrus hoppiness.  T: The flavor is also of an American barleywine, and a pretty middle of the road one. A good caramel malt kick with toffee and raisin/date flavors mixed with light grapefruit citrus and floral hopping. Alcohol is pretty warming although I have to give DFH some credit on keeping the alcohol presence for a 15+% beer pretty well in the background.  M: Sticky and tacky, a little syrupy but what do you expect at this ABV?  O: OK I admit that i did not have the balls to try this fresh mainly because solventy alcohol booze is not my thing -- I will drink hard alcohol if that was what I was looking for. I might try this again at one year old and see -- this one is 2.5 years old and already is firmly in the American barleywine camp.

S: Smells yields obscenely strong pine hop smells. There's a bit of citrus, as well. There's also intense malt flavors coming off of the nose, as well. Not really any alcohol, surprisingly.  T: The slightly older bottle has really balanced this out from the last time I've had it. Still have really strong, raw hop flavors upfront, but it's not overpowering. Pine, slight bit of citrus, even a hint of darker fruit. Grass, marijuana, and herbal notes, as well. There's a bit of alcohol after that. Lots of sweet, strong malt supports the hops. The fresher bottles don't really showcase this aspect. Finishes slightly alcoholic and bitter.  M: Honestly, the body is pretty big here, and it doesn't go down too easy, but it's to be expected for this strength. Yes, it drinks like a beer, but it's not very well carbonated, and it's pretty sweet, resulting in a thicker consistency.  O: This is a novelty DIPA. It's good for what it tries to be. It's not supposed to be balanced or conventional in any way. Therefore, it's really, really hard to grade this one.

T - Sweet and malty. Hops are up front and are huge in the aftertaste. The sweetness is up front, and the booze is potent from the 1st taste all the way down the gullet. Definitely warms you up quick!  M - Full bodied, oily and slick. Coats your mouth like syrup before it releases its hop bomb!  O - A sipper for sure, but an amazing one at that. Well done.

10099,9086,neophilus,4.64,"Copper colored body, thin white head. Somewhat cloudy but not opaque.  Aroma is a great pairing of thick, sweet malt body and aggressive hopping. Hop resins float above a stew of sweet bread scents. Hops are leaning on the piney resin side of American hop profiles.  Bitter hop flavor up front immediately washing through thick sweet maltiness. Swirling flavors of pine resin, toffee, caramel and rich doughy fresh baked bread.  Thick mouthfeel sticks to the roof of your mouth and coats the tongue with lucious flavor. Somewhat chewy. Hop resin flavors flow throughout the aftertaste mingling with warming alcohol heat to create a stiff but inviting bitter finish.  A monster of a beer that responds well to some warmth and sips like a good cognac. I suppose I should share with a friend... but I won't.

I now know it as the DIPA smell, and it's full blast; so sweet bubblegum is coming to mind  T: follows the nose with a covered-up but still very much there BIG bitter bite. it's underneath all the crazy caramel (now vanilla) sweetness, but there is surely a bitter hop taste to go with the rest of the sweet  F: syrup. took thick for me, but it does hold on to enough carbonation to make it drinkable. considering the American over-the-type style which it resides in, this makes sense  O: it's a bit of a workout ... the massive sweetness, the super-thick syrupy mouthfeel, the slight alcohol burn -- I could see even an avid DIPA fan not going for this. at the same time, this brew is coming off like pretty much every other DIPA I've tried in that huge caramel/mango/vanilla sweetness both in the nose and taste, and while I can feel and detect the at-least 15% ABV, it's actually hiding it pretty well.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

10099,9086,MCain04,3.41,"12 oz bottle, '11 vintage, poured into a DFH IPA glass. I've had this fresh on tap before and really enjoyed it, 4.5/5. I aged this bottle for 2 years to compare.  Pours a murky brown-orange with some sediment which settles to the bottom of the glass. Small head of off-white color which dissipates quickly with minimal lacing.  Smell is sweet caramal, toffee, and vanilla. Strong alcohol aroma. Dark fruits and fig are present. Perhaps some dark chocolate. Very little hops. If blind I would have guessed the style to barrel-aged barleywine to be sure.  Taste is along the nose, with a sweet cloying caramel and toffee flavor accented by vanilla notes and dark fruits and chocolate. Again very little hop flavor, and little bitterness to balance the sweetness.  Mouthfeel is full, smooth, syrupy, low carbonation, cloying.  Overall, I can see how one who isn't a fan of ultra-hopped beers would prefer this brew aged to tone down the alcohol and bitter hoppy nature. However, 2 years on this has essentially turned this into an over-the-top barleywine. I'll take the fresh version every day of the week, this was a drain pour.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

10099,9086,MattyBones,4.17,"When I first got into Craft beer I was obsessed with Dogfish Head beers so needless to say when I saw this sitting on the shelf I had to have it. I bought 6 of them for about 12 bucks a pop believing it really would be the Holy Grail of beer lol. It was good, but not to sure it was worth the price.  Appearance: Pores a rich coppery color with a very thin white head. As I pored it into the glass I could see the syrupy thickness.  Smell: Extremely pleasing to the nose, a mixture of tropical fruits and hints of the alcohol.  Taste: ALCOHOL!!! I get all types of tropical fruits mixed in like mango, some pineapple and maybe guava, not sure. Decent amount of bitterness all followed up by the slow burn of alcohol. To me the alcohol outshines the rest of the flavors a bit.  Mouthfeel: Like drinking syrup. :) A thick, syrupy feel that coats the mouth and hangs onto your palate for quite some time.  Overall: Solid and I probably would have enjoyed it more if the alcohol was a little more well hidden. I'm curious as to how this tastes with some age behind it. Every time I tried it the longest it sat was a month.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,coldy,4.72,"Wow....  I first had this beer about 5 years ago from a bottle, and have had it several times since. I recently had this on tap at the Dogfish brewpub.  This is an unbelievably tasty, strong beer. I really enjoy trying the strong beers out there, and the 120 continues to be the benchmark in my opinion.  Interestingly enough, the 120 actually has less hop characteristics than the 90, and even 60. My understanding is that is due mainly to the high alcohol content.  The 120 has just the right amount of strong alcohol notes, carbonation and complexity to make it an outstanding beer that is just right for sipping and enjoying in a snifter or wine glass.  I am a huge Dogfish fan, and I know they love to experiment and create new beers constantly, but this is one that hopefully remains in limited production and unchanged.  Delicious",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,SPThirtyThree,4.18,"This bottle is 4 years and 1 month old, to the day, making this the oldest DFH120 I've ever tried. The bottle advertises that it ages well, and I'm curious to see how it compares to fresher versions.  A: Murky copper with apricot edges. I let a lot of sediment into my goblet towards the end of the pour, peppering flecks that cling to the curved sides of the goblet, huddling towards the bottom. A half-finger head of yellowed creme quickly falls to a small blob of fine bubbles in the middle from the etching, and then the head further recedes to a thin collar of tan.  S: The nose is really interesting on this because I remember it being hop-heavy, but this one is a sweet, complex, plum fruitcake. It's chewy and a little hot, and the fruits are both dark and citrus-laden.  T: Tangy pineapple. This beer is sweet and resinous. Hot alcohols yield to sticky sweetness, touched off by the fruity notes of the west-coast hops. There's a lemon tang, and a slight metallic flavor, but both could just be features of the heat behind the flavor.  At 4 years, I notice DFH120 has a huge Belgian-candy spicy sweetness, and the finish tastes of fusels, but not enough to spoil the flavor. I also think I'm getting some acetaldehyde from start to finish, but it's masked by some of the heavier flavors and heat. There's a slight toasty breadiness malt also buried in there somewhere, but the theme is spice and heat.  As it warms, some vanilla, cocoa, bourbon, and nutty flavors become more pronounced, and this beer starts to have an aftertaste and mouthfeel like drinking a Scotch on the rocks. Since it's 3X the strength of a standard craft beer, I feel the effects of the alcohol only halfway through. The sweetness remains through the full session, keeping the heat in check.  M: Hot, astringent, and thin, but not unpalatable. It feels oily from the viscousness of the alcohol, and carbonation seems very low. It's very prickly on the tongue, with various spicy, hot, and astringent sensations happening and different times on different parts of the tongue. The finish is very interesting with many different elements to focus on, like a distinct stickiness in the center of the tongue.  This beer is a nice sipper, a winter warmer. It's a blend of harsh flavors, and the hope is that they balance harmoniously. The 18% alcohol is impossible to mask, but DFH120 is very smooth given it's strength. However, it's heat, metallicity, and green-apple flavors detract from it's overall palatibility. I'm not sure if two of those words are actually words, but either way, DFH120 is obviously a famed, huge beer, and it's delicious despite some unpleasant flavors.  Overall, there are so many different sensations to focus on while drinking 120 minute, that this beer stays interesting through every sip, and for every bad flavor it seems like there are two delicious ones, so it's not fair to knock this beer for some of its harshness.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

10099,9086,rdilauro,4.02,"To start with I am a big fan of Dogfish Head brews. I have tasted some of their more unique beers, some which I loved, some which I didnt like at all.  This 120. First time I had it was about 2 years ago. I remember back then that it was 'over the top' for me. Too much, the bitter hops really didnt come across. But instead, all I picked up was the alcohol.  Now, I tasted it again and came away with the same conclusion  We make it a deal that at the end of the night, when the store closes up, we taste one or two brews. Lately, I've been working with this young fellow (Joe) who has recently gotten into the premium crafted beers. I select the beer, we taste them and he always enjoys them. He may say that this one has too much or, that it wasnt until the second sip, etc....  But when it came to the 120. It was hard for him. As it has been hard for me.  I love DogFish Head Beers, but the 120 isn't one for me  10/24/13 This is probably my fifth time tasting this one in a serious fashion. I noticed that the overall appearance, color, and head were a bit more vibrant then I remembered in the past The aroma was also more appealing. A definite nose of hops, but not that strong citrus grapefruit you get from highly hopped beers. The taste was full, for the amount of hops, you would expect more bitterness, but I think the amount of malt used here sort of masks the hops. I also did not pick up on the high abv. I've tasted beers in the 9% range that had a more distinct alcoholic taste. I have to admit, I am beginning to enjoy this more. Its a beer to be taken seriously. Its not a chuggable easy drinking beer. Its more like a fine quality snipping beverage. I have 2 in my cellar hoping to age them for about 2 more years. It will be very interesting to taste them later.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Aftertaste is sweet alcohol-soaked hops.  Mouthfeel: Syrupy, average carbonation, warming alcohol presence.  Overall: I would drink it again and again. Alcohol is king though.

The tastes include resinous piney hops, honey, sweet malts, lemon, orange, and more cloying honey sweetness all throughout. For a beer that is supposed to be one of the hoppiest there is, this one slightly disappoints. The malt flavor and alcohol overwhelms everything else. A bit of a chore to drink.  Medium bodied, slow sipper due to alcohol. Low carbonation.

Balance is the key word here. Comes in somewhat light with a strong finish. The hops are definitely present, but not overpowering like I thought they may be. Hint of warmth at the end, totally masking the ABV. Everything just comes together so well.  Mouthfeel - Again, perfectly balanced. Dry but not too dry. Coats the tongue, but not too much. I could sip away for days, it's like sweet nectar.  Overall - Lived up to the hype.

10099,9086,Cylinsier,4.3,"from a 12 oz. Re-review from 2009.  Pours a hazy reddish brown, with off-white fine head at about a quarter inch. Dissipates to a film.  Smells like piney grapefruit hops, honey, a hint of booze, and a bit of biscuity malt.  Tastes very sweet like apples, followed by honey and a bit of nuttiness. The hops are citrusy and subdued, surprisingly not bitter. They are there, but the malt wins out in this beer.  Full, viscous body with light tingles of carbonation throughout the mouth. Notable booze sting and warmth going down.  I like this beer a lot more now than I did a few years ago. I don't think the beer is all that different, just my tastes. It doesn't taste like an IPA, more like a barelywine. The hops are there in the aroma but more subdued in the flavor. Definitely a world class brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,utopiajane,3.97,"Pours an orange copper color. Nice and clear. Streaming effervescence and a practically no head, wet lace and alcohol legs.  The nose is succulent ripe orange with a perfectly ripe pink grapefruit behind that. It has some pine on the nose and plenty of malt. Deep, rich full malt. Caramel, toffee and sugars. You would think that with the tremendous abv that there would be some alcohol on the nose but there is none. Very impressed. It does not really smell like beer but rather like a liquor.  Taste is rich and sweet orange. Not just the fruit but the rind and the pith as well. the pink grapefruit is there to add tartness and the pine is like sap and really sticky. The mouthfeel is thick although the body of the beer is not that thick. It's got a fat, full malt that keeps expanding to carry the both the fruit and the alcohol. There is a whopping 18%? You can't tell that from the palate. It warms at the back of the throat and encompasses the chest so it drinks like a whiskey. It gives a blush to the cheek and puts a smile on your face. It's terribly sweet and needs the bread in the malt to carry that. You don't taste too much bread though because it has that much alcohol and that much sweetness.  This beer is an experience. If I had to say it reminds me of any one beer style I would say DIPA but still not really. It warms and intensifies with some molasses and nutty flavors to come out on the malt and with a nice sticky and creamy edge to the mouth fell. As many times as I have said sweet and sticky it is not cloying. The carbonation is ample and it refreshes in the glass but you don't notice it in the very dry finish because the alcohol is warming and drying and because the malt is thick and rich and sweet.

Smell reminds me of wet hay. Not poetic but accurate. T - Okay, well definitely hoppy but not bitter. In fact, I'd say it is near sweet, nearly medicinal and you definitely get the booziness, almost like a quad. Very slight back tongue bitterness after a few minutes. Yes, sip and evaluate.

The hops aren't as bitter as I might expect, but that's okay - it demonstrates a very good balance for such a big beer. Hop flavor seems consistent throughout - same hops up front as in the aftertaste.  F: Nice body that fits the other aspects of this beer - well balanced. It's silky smooth.

T: alcohol, candy, faint hit of hop spice initially then malty/sweet body. I get some hop bitterness after swallowing but it dies quickly.  M: seems a bit thin for the ABV.  O: I think I like the 90min better. Despite the 120IBU touted, I don't get it, and for that I'm disappointed. Regardless, this is fairly well balanced for the ABV.

Very orange/apricot color to the beer. Very appealing.  S- Malt and booze. For a beer that has been hopped to hell and back all I can smell is sweetness from the malt. On further assessment there are subtle hints of caramel, and spiced citrus.  T- This is where I realized I may not be a fan of such high ABV's. I'd rather have Tequila or Rye Whiskey because of the balance. This beer is all sweet with flavors of citrus and caramel. The malt finish is huge, adding to the sweetness. Minimal hops. I know they are there, because they have to be, but tasting them is difficult. Booze and malt are all I can distinguish.  M- Like a mouth full of a good liqueur this beer has a sweet rich feel with minimal carbonation.  O- Can I say disappointed? WIth 60,75, and 90 being so very impressive I expected this to crush them all. I instead encountered a totally different beast. More Liqueur than beer, this beverage needs to come with a warning.

A-As you might expect with a beer that has an ABV well into the double digits, a normal pour produces very little head, just a thin, patchy cap of khaki foam that lingers in varying stages of patchiness. The brew is hazy and orange, rusty, copper in color. There is a decent bubble show at first with champagne-like streams of carb.  S-There is a lot of warming booze, but I find it appetizing and complex like a good cognac. Flavor-wise, I detect spicy orange, vanilla, and caramel. The brew is mostly sweet with a nicely-balanced bitterness that, in the grand scheme of things, is not all that bitter.  T-The taste is similar to the smell with cognac-like flavors of orange, vanilla, caramel, and a bit of spice riding a big wave of warming alcohol. Again, the bitterness is balanced by the huge malts and result is not so much a hop bomb but just a huge, boozy beer.  M-The feel is substantial with low levels of carbonation and a medium body. The carbonation just sort of rests on your palate.  O-I have had sips of this beer before and not been overwhelmed, but I thoroughly enjoyed my bottle this evening. Obviously, at anywhere from 15%-20% this is a huge beer, so if subtlety is your thing, look elsewhere.

The aroma is big on hops (floral, piney, citrus) and bitterness, even though this has been aged for some time. Also get lots of sweetness, caramel, honey, toffee, fruit cake, rum raison/dark fruits, and a malt backbone that stands up to what was, to say the least, some intense hopping in this beer. I remember the aroma of a fresher bottle was more like a big DIPA that had Barleywine qualities. Now it's more like a big, super hoppy Barleywine and I'm definitely okay with this. Taste is sweet again, alcohol bite is noticeable, caramel sweetness, heavy on the herbal, piney, and citric hops, bitterness, yeah, with toffee, treacle, butterscotch, strong malt presence, and honey swarming as well. Hints of dark fruit, fruit cake, nuts, and vanilla? Pretty good. Mouthfeel is good. Filmy, viscous consistency, round (medium-high) carbonation, medium-full body, and a bitter, dry, lingering finish.  Holy hoppy barleywines, Batman! Yeah, this used to be an Imperial India Pale Ale bordering on an American Barleywine, but the age has turned it into just the opposite. Nonetheless, still a great beer. If I want to get my hop and barleywine fix, I now know where to turn if I don't have any fresh SN Bigfoot on hand.

Nothing too bubbly and overwhelming. Pretty great here.  O: I told myself I wasnt gonna like this one and I was absolutely wrong. Will pick up another bottle and maybe try aging it for a year or two if I'm feeling frisky.

Sweet caramel malt, dried fruit like prune or date, maple, dried cherries, candied fruit, pear and toasted grains are all there but not overly pronounced.  This is a sipper so I've tried to slow down and enjoy this immensely complex brew. Candied fruits come to the front with prune, date and raisin. Hints of maple and cherry come near the middle with toasted grain, roasted nut and caramel malts at the end.

For all the hops, there's very little scent of them. I get some toffee, caramel, rum raisin and a hint of fennel. It's funky in a way that ain't funky...And the strangeness progresses to bad...  It tastes of spoiled maple syrup, molasses, and a sweet hay. It might have some complexity to comment on, but I can't stick with it long enough to find what's interesting. The hops have gone well past bitter and dominate in an untoward manner...with sticky essential oils. This is such an off-putting unilateral experience, I struggle to consume it.  The mouthfeel is heavy and medicinal, making the poor flavor harder to tolerate, because it doesn't go away as rapidly as I'd hope. For all the alcohol, it's not very hot and desperately needs more carbonation and spice to cut it.

10099,9086,jegross2,4,"Reviewing the infamous 120 Minute IPA from Dogfish Head Craft Brewery out of Milton, Delaware. This double IPA clocks in at a whopping 18% ABV.  Score: 90  Bottled on 02/15/13. Served in a snifter glass and enjoyed on 05/15/13.  Appearance: Pours a clean looking caramel color with a thin layer of off-white head atop the glass that settles to ring around the glass. Average lacing, above average retention -- shocking for the ABV. Basically, this looks like you'd expect an IPA to look like. 4/5  Smell: Boozy caramel and surprisingly subtle piney hops. Sweet citrus, cheap waffle syrup (you know, the kind at a Comfort Suite's continental breakfast) and wood chips, a little earthiness too. Smells quite malty. 4/5  Taste: Tastes like an aged Behemoth with more alcohol warmth on the palate. Syrupy caramel malt, boozy malt, a dash of vanilla. There's citrus, earthy hops and a lingering orange and syrup flavor in the finish. Despite the booziness, it does not taste like it is much more than a 10% ABV beer -- certainly not as boozy as you would expect of a beer that has a higher ABV than a bottle of DeKuyper Sour Apple Pucker schnapps. 4/5  Mouthfeel: Full bodied, low carbonation. This beer is surprisingly viscous and syrupy! Has a nice malty sweet character with a dash of bitterness from the hops. Dry finish. 4/5  Overall: Definitely overpriced what it ultimately delivers, but pretty tasty nonetheless. I can't imagine this beer is cheap to brew given the gravity. Although 120 Minute IPA is not quite as good as other malt-bomb high ABV imperial IPAs that blend the line between American barleywine and imperial IPA like Double Crooked Tree or Maharaja, I found that I liked this beer essentially as much as a two or three year old Behemoth.

10099,9086,Roguer,4.37,"Amber, orange, and red brew, with a solid, firm, off-white head that slowly fades, leaving excellent lacing. Slow carbonation leads to a haziness at a distance.  Boozy aroma: alcohol, wheat, honey, hops, about in that order. Caramel grains, toast, maybe a hint of grape.  Huge dose of sweet, sweet malts; no typical DIPA hop presence, yet it's extremely bitter. The alcohol is pretty well-hidden for the 18% ABV, but it's impossible to not notice. If the line between a DIPA and a Barleywine was fuzzy, DFH 120 min erases that line.  I cannot overemphasize the massive sweet dose of malts: heavy caramel, but also honey, some lighter grains, and almost a less odious butterscotch. Despite being a 120 minute hop-bomb, any hint of grapefruit or non-malt floral honey is almost completely overwhelmed; you really have to search for those flavors.  Medium-full feel; thick, syrupy, boozy, warming. No sting. It's hard to imagine a better mouthfeel on a beer this beastly.  This is an incredible, complex, and potent brew. I have to be in the mood for a sipping wine to down this beer; it is nothing like an ordinary IPA or DIPA (although Devil Dancer is a good comparison, and RuinTen lies on the same path).  I've heard people refer to this as a Barleywine, and they're not incorrect. If you're an IPA-loving hop-head, then this probably isn't the beer for you. If you enjoy sipping your beer slowly, and can handle a beer that simultaneously manages an IBU load of palate-blasting bitterness AND a malt load that puts many Belgians to shame, then have at it. It's a special beer.  This is a fresh 120 minute; I'm saving another one for aging. (You know it's a special DIPA when the bottle proclaims ""Ages well,"" instead of the usual ""Drink it fresh!!!111exclamationmark!"")  Update: aging yields slight oxidation notes in the aroma, but the flavor and feel are, if anything, even smoother.

Pours clear medium orange. Just a dusting of whitish head, not much visible carbonation. Looks syrupy.  Smell is an amalgam of fruity hops (mostly citrus), beefed-up sweet malts, and an alcohol pinch. Leans toward sweet and fruity, but there's so much else going on that it's hard to pull out the individual components. Complex in a kitchen-sink way.  Taste is... sweet and alcoholic. Exactly what I was expecting, but still a bit of a shock to the senses. Makes me tingle on one sip, and shudder on the next. A kick in the pants, but a remarkably enjoyable one.  Mouthfeel is really nice, in an odd way. Quite syrupy, leaving a sugary residue on my lips after the taste. Medium-low carbonation, but I think any more would be too much. Lasting and luscious.  A very interesting beer. It's powerfully sweet, and powerfully alcoholic, but there's so much variety in the flavor that I barely (for 15% plus) notice the alcohol.

Silly, but at least I was able to get a few.  Look - Poured into the DFH IPA glass, figured no other way to do it. Pours a hazy deep orange amber with a full foamy head that dissipates slowly and leaves a good amount of spotty lacing, which is quite impressive given the alcohol content.  Smell - Alcohol is right on top, as well as malt, but these both face contention with juicy citrus and piney bitter hops. One hell of an aroma but a little off-putting due to the alcohol.  Taste - Smooth caramel malt with juicy citrus hops gives way to a warm boozy blast to the face. The alcohol is there for sure, but it mixes well.  Mouthfeel - Tingle, warmth (throat and stomach), and general almost bourbon whiskey feel. Surprisingly enough it is quite dry (only ever so slightly sticky) and on the lighter side in terms of body. This is a sipper (of course) but otherwise quite drinkable, I had no problem putting this down.  Overall - Not really what I would call a DIPA, but I guess the formula had to be characterized somehow and it seems to be an extreme version of this formula.

The mouthfeel is thin containing average carbonation and it's very tingly on the tongue.  Overall I consider this a very special beer, only to be consumed during special occasions. The taste kind reminds me of white wine (Chardonnay); however, It has a much more complex taste than wine. It's surprising how smooth this beer is for its alcohol content. It goes down very smooth for the 18% ABV contained in the beer. I would definitely buy this one again.

It looks like a sickly yellow that isn't all that inviting. When pouring, it's hard to get any head on it at all due to the ABV, but what is there kind of pathetically sticks around. Not the greatest look for such a great beer, but also something that I don't think can be fixed based on what it is (nor needs to be).  Smell: Smells really sweet. You can definitely smell hops in there, but they didn't beat me across the face like I was expecting from an IPA hopped continuously for two hours and all that jazz.  Taste: Shockingly not crazy hoppy. The ABV on this one really mellows out the flavor. It tastes sweet, like juice, rather than super bitter. When people say this one drinks like a barleywine they really mean it. It really tastes like a sweet, malty, floral masterpiece rather than a palate-wrecking DIPA. Almost deserves to be reclassified in order to compare it better to what it is (but are there even others like it?).  Mouthfeel: Wonderfully smooth. Barely any carbonation in this one, but just enough there to really fill out the body.  Overall: This is truly an incredible beer, and one I'm glad I had the pleasure of trying.

Is this beer or port like beverage? Beyond barleywine.  Not much carbonation, head, legs, etc....it doesn't need it. Improves as warms; opens up the apricot, peach citrusy taste. 120 IBU's  Someone said relaxing; I agree",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,StoutHunter,4.25,"I picked up a bottle of Dogfish Head's 120 Minute IPA a couple weeks ago for $8.89 at The Lager Mill. Well it looks like this will be my 600th review, I always like to get something that I wouldn't normally buy for these milestones. This is the first time I have seen this beer around so I thought I should take a chance on it, I have heard that this is a really intense and potent beer and since it's something that doesn't show up around here often I thought it would make for an interesting 600th review, so lets see how it goes. No visible bottling date, 2013 Vintage, it's pretty fresh. Poured from a brown 12oz bottle into a snifter.  A- The The label looks nice, it's simple, but it's got a clean and classy look to it, I like it and the special bottle cap is a nice change. It poured a very hazy and nice orange color that took on some darker amber hues when held to the light with almost two fingers worth of off white head that died down to a thin ring that stayed till the end and it left some nice lacing behind. This is a pretty good looking beer, I really like the color and the head and lacing were much better then I thought it would be for such a high alcohol beer, I like it.  S- The aroma starts off with a very high amount of sweetness followed by lots of hops that impart a huge citrus fruit aroma with some tropical fruits in the background with some papaya, mango and pineapple like aromas sticking out the most. Up next I get some malt aromas that were a little grainy and pretty biscuit like followed by lots of sweet malt aromas. Towards the end I get slight cannabis and herbal like aroma that blend nicely with other aromas and is followed by some strong alcohol aromas that let you know this beer means business. This beer had a very good aroma, it was pretty complex and very intense lots of strong alcohol and hop aromas.  T- The taste seems to be pretty similar to the aroma, it starts off with a very high amount of sweetness that instantly coats the mouth and is followed by tons of citrus hop flavors with some tropical fruits in the background and all the nice fruits that I picked up in the aroma show up nicely in the taste and it really dominates the taste buds. Up next comes some biscuit like and very sweet malts followed by a medium amount of high bitterness with some herbal flavors showing up towards the end with a hoppy, citrus and warming alcohol aftertaste. This beer tasted very good, the alcohol was pretty warming but not overly harsh and it wasn't overly bitter either with some nice citrus hop flavors and lots of sweets malts, It's a complex sipper.  M- Not the smoothest, but smoother than I thought it would be, syrupy, sticky, on the medium side of being full bodied with a slightly lower amount of medium carbonation that worked well with this beer. The mouthfeel was was pretty good and it worked well with this beer, I thought it had just the right amount of carbonation.  All in all I thought this was a good beer and a very good and extreme example of the style, once you get past the intensity there some nice layers of flavors and aromas that make it a pretty complex beer that's nice to sip on. It didn't have the best drinkability, it's going to take me quite awhile to make it through the whole bottle and I really don't see a way that I could drink another one unless I wanted to get completely wasted, one is the perfect size and it would also be nice to split with someone. What I like the most about this beer was how complex it was, it seems like every time I smelled or sipped it I picked up a new aspect that I didn't get before. What I liked the least about this beer was the high amount of sweetness, I know beers this strong are always pretty sweet but this one was bordering on syrupy sweet. I would buy this beer again, If I see it again I would like to get a couple bottle for the cellar, I have no doubt that this will age well and hopefully it will get a little smoother with age, I would recommend this to anyone who likes strong and intense beers, just because you like a couple IPA's doesn't mean your ready to take on the hop and alcohol onslaught which is 120 Minute IPA. All in all I was pretty impressed with this beer, it wasn't as harsh as I was expected but it was still a very intense beer that isn't for the faint of heart. Dogfish Head did a great job with this beer, I know when a brewing a beer that is this strong it can get to be pretty difficult and it shows how confident Dogfish Head is to regularly make a beer that's this intense and so difficult to brew, it takes balls to do something like that and you have to be a little crazy, but it all comes together as one hell of experience that everyone should have least once. So far this is the strongest beer I have ever had, I think it's about 18%. Good job Dogfish Head, it's nice to have a brewery like you guys that makes special beers like these that are great to have on special occasions, here's to 600 more reviews.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,BeerForMuscle,4.14,"Revisiting this one after years of not having it. On tap at UNO in Hamilton NJ. On the amber side of things with no head. Smells pungent, with plenty of pine and citrus. Flavor is big, with resiny hops, booze, bitter citrus, supported by a malty touch. Better than I remember it to be but the booze shines through a bit much. Thinking some aging would help.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Mikecap,4.64,"Finally made myself order this last night at Sunset Grill & Tap where it was on tap. At $10 for a 10 oz. pour, I figured I had to give it a go.  Poured a deep mahogany color, with an awesome aroma. Hops, hops, and more hops, with a bit of alcohol mixed in. Definitely resiny and floral.  Taste was surprisingly smooth. The alcohol is surely noticeable, but it drinks like an IPA. However, definitely a sipper and something that is great to take slowly. I could enjoy this for a couple of hours like a nice bourbon or whiskey.  Incredible mouthfeel in my opinion. Bready, chewy but still smooth. Went down a little too easy.  Overall, this was much better than expected. Had yet to try it mostly because I thought it was all hype, but certainly worth seeking out. I would definitely drink this and enjoy it again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Resuin,4.49,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a tulip glass. Stamp on bottle says 'Bottled on 02/15/13', which makes is just shy of 3 months old.  Appearance: Pours a copper/deep amber and leaves about a half finger of off-white head.  Smell: Surprisingly light smell - concentrated citrusy hops, malts, and I detect a hint of raspberry. Definitely different aromas then any beer I've had.  Taste: Matches the smell, but everything is more pronounced. Very sweet, especially for an ""IPA"". I still get the raspberry flavor along with the malts and citrusy hops, as well as some mild alcohol. Also some other fruit flavors including apricot, peaches and figs. The finish of this one is plenty of hops, counteracting the sweet start - very interesting and complex.  Mouth-feel: Thick and syrupy - there is definitely still some carbonation in here but not a whole lot. The alcohol is well hidden for such a monster at 18%, and it goes down pretty smooth.  Overall: A unique beer for sure. While this beer has characteristics of an IPA such as the bitter hop finish and citrus notes, it also takes notes from other styles such as the thickness and mouth-feel of an imperial stout, as well as flavor notes from several other different styles. This is definitely the sweetest IPA I have ever had, but all being said this was an extremely enjoyable drink experience and I can't recommend it enough. Obviously, this beer is one to tread carefully with, as it packs a punch.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,jgurley,4.56,"Poured into my tasting snifter. My second time drinking it, first review. First time was on tap and slightly different, if memory serves. Pretty reddish gold color. Medium to smallish head which dissipates quickly, yet laces nicely. Wonderful citrus fruity/produce market aroma. Oranges, pine, lemongrass, melon. Big sip... Sweet, full bodied. First thing to go through my mind is the word Barleywine. Citrus, dark fruit and big brown sugar. Far from tasting like an IPA, except for the hop bitterness across the very middle. The back end is surprisingly sweet. Good lingering aftertaste. I found this to be more carbonated than what I expected from reading other reviews. Alcohol is masked well by the ABUNDANCE of flavors, but is HIGHLY evident as soon as it hits the belly. Alcohol hits you similar to a warm red wine buzz. Body is slightly thick and sticky. A good beer to sip and swirl, and it warms very well. One word description of this beer: Relaxing.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Axnjxn,4.03,"12oz bottle poured into a New Belgium snifter, about a year of age on this one.  Pours a golden color with a slight white head. Low carbonation. Smell is interesting... it's not that big considering what i had expected. it smells of alcohol and citrus much like a barelywine, but its not over the top. Tastes nothing like an IPA, though i wasn't expecting it to. It tastes quite nice actually. Very boozy but also sweet. Very sweet actually. Orange and citrus and alcohol. Obviously a sipper as this is a heavy beer, but the body is smooth.  Overall dont expect this to taste or smell or BE anything like an IPA, because its definitely not like any other. This is a barleywine and thats what you should be expecting. Im very impressed at how balanced this beer is considering the extremely high ABV. You'd think this was 10 or 11%, not 18! Bonus points for that.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,schnarr84,4.82,12oz bottle (thanks to BeerThursday) poured into Alaskan tulip Holy citrus bomb. all i smell is faint hops and a case of oranges. zero booze on the nose which is mind blowing for a 18% ipa. taste is pretty hoppy but again the orange cuts through it so well. this is incredibly a session beer.. if this was toned down alcohol wise i would drink a dozen in a row. probably the holy grail of IPAs.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,dar482,3.84,"The color is a clear wonderful ruby, orange color with not much of a head.  The aroma has a great papaya, peach, mango, and citrus hops. Sweet biscuit malt, syrupy sweetness, and then some dank herbal, resin.  The flavor is quite good. It has a good hop character and the alcohol does not come out so hard for 18%. It has a hop kick and then wonderful sweet juiciness hops and fruit flavor. Then there's a big sweet malt, bitterness, and the booziness, they all meld really together.  It has a slight flavor of a barleywine, but with the big malt and thick malt flavors. It's an extreme beer that you should try. It's a good sipper and worth the try.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,gpogo,4.52,"A- Hazed red amber body. Light foam, more specifically the tiniest ring of foam. Has legs like wine.  A- Dark fruit and caramel malt, no noticeable alcohol or hops.  T- Very sweet malt flavor with quite a bit of alcohol. As I worked through this glass I noticed myself getting rather intoxicated and my senses dulled.  M- Medium-heavy body and little to no carbonation. No apparent carbonation, but there is still a carbonation bite. Quite warming in my chest as well.  D- So incredibly smooth for the amount of alcohol. This bottle was less than a year old and most of the hops seem to have mellowed out. My previous bottle was ~5 years. I'd like to try a freshly bottled one in the near future. As far as sessionable, nope, after one I had a very nice buzz on.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,ryan0585,4.93,"Amazing beer, plain and simple. Check the Dogfish Head website to see when it is available in Total Wine and other liquor stores. Rare to find, great to drink.  For an IPA, surprisingly not very hoppy, at least compared to the 60 and 90 minute brews. And for a beer with quite a punch at 18% ABV, does not taste too strong, until you feel the effects after the last drop.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,J_Dub,4.81,"A: Dark orange/brown and cloudy.  S: One of the best smelling beers I've had. Malty sweetness and alcohol primarily. There are also notes of dark fruits. I can smell some hops too. Very complex nose.  T: Not like what you think an IPA should taste like (but that's not a bad thing!). Warming alcohol flavors, raisin, plum, hops, caramel sweetness. Like the nose, the flavors are very complex and yet blend together perfectly. Although the alcohol adds some flavor it is hidden extremely well considering the 18% ABV.  M: Sticky, syrup like essence. DFH has made a beer that has the richness of melted down candy but made it very enjoyable.  Overall, a stellar beer that any hophead needs to try. The complex, dark, sugary nose and flavor are delicious on a cold night with friends. If it wasn't for the rarity (at least in Texas) and the price this would be a weekly drink.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Rope,3.17,"Served in Chimay chalice  Appearance- A deep orange color, with a thin white fizzy head.  Smell- Very hoppy, citrus and bitter hops competing in the front with a sweet smell if you search for it.  Taste- Way to sweet for its own good, almost like a Spaten Optimutor. The sweetness is way to much, and is followed by a slight bitter. I have a hard time picking out any flavors.  Mouthfeel- Heavy and oily, less carbonation than expecting.  Overall- I love me some hops, but if I wanted something this sweet I could drink soda. Still better than a AAL.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,tut2528,4.34,"bottled on 2012  A: pours a nice brown color with an orange hue to it and when held up to the light it becomes an awesome dark orange color and you can see some floaties. pours about 1 fingers worth of head formation that is beige in color  S: huge hops rush to the nostrils during the pour. immense grapefruit, orange peel and even some subtle lemon zest are also pretty evident and integrate very nicely with a huge malty and sugary sweetness. to be honest, the alcohol is extremely well hidden.  T: huge sugary and malt sweetness is noticed right up front and it has a great hop profile. citrus and grapefruit still present and there's a big creamy finish. again, for 18%, the alcohol is balanced nicely with the big sweet backbone  M: heavy side of medium bodied, leaves a big sugary sweetness that sticks to the teeth and the palate. the alcohol is warming, but inviting  O: this was one of the first brews i had when i got onto the craft beer scene and it was too strong. but this is simply amazing to me right now. i find this well balanced for 18% and i will definitely be grabbing more of these",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Bouleboubier,4.43,"Have had this maybe a handful of times - from undrinkable (the first time trying it, filtered through a Randall at the Rehoboth brewpub - tooo much!) to actually quite quaffable (as it was with last night's large pour).  A: generously served in a 12oz goblet (menu stated 8oz pour), it's a slightly hazy, copper-orange with a 1/2"" slowly fading head with a vague cream-yellow tint. Moderate ringed lacing. One gets the sense that the beer is not light-drinking.  S: aggressively ""hoppy"" hop aromas, dank, resiny, piney/woody....vibrantly fruity - dried mango....smoothed-out, wort-y, hard-candy-like unfermentables, yet balanced wonderfully against the hops, with the alcohols and phenols present yet surprisingly understated  T/M: as in the smell, they really balanced everything out so well in this batch....actually does not come across nearly as bitter as it's billed - the malt sugars, several notches short of cloying, tone down the bitterness and perhaps the overall intensity of the citrus-resiny, silky-spicy hop flavor itself - that same malt foundation, while surprisingly allowing an almost roasty-nutty, cereal-like grain flavor to somehow poke through, also blankets the burn/bite of the high alcohol superbly - comforting alcohol warmth still manages to ribbon through 2/3 the way through each sip, but it's a creeper for sure....often, in past samplings, came across to me as ""hop syrup"", but this one was refreshingly on the drier side for once  O: certainly not for everybody, including myself....in the mood for an intense, rich, hoppy cordial of a beer? this is king....and when they nail it, they really nail it, and it's wonderful and an achievement in brewing to marvel at!...something to keep tuned in to batch-to-batch....",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,ThomasMetal75,3.09,"A- Dark cooper and cloudy. There is a small head that sticks around throughout the beer. Head livens up with a good swirl of the glass. Very nice alcohol legs/lacing present.  S- Oh helloooo! Alcohol and hops dominate the nose. Smells dank! Hard to pinpoint what kind of hop sent is there. I think it's a combination of floral and grapefruit citrus scent. There is an overall sweetness present.  T- Very complex beer. IInitial sip is of alcohol laced hops and malt. The finish is soooo bitter and soooo boozzy! Sweet as well. There is an overall malty bozzy quality to the aftertaste. Too alcoholic tasting. It's a little better when at room temperature. When it warms, the malty taste balances out some of the alcohol and sweetness, making it more palatable.  M- Full, very rich mouthfeel. Beer really covers the back of the throat. Long finish. It's just too boozy in taste to make this real easy to drink, almost un enjoyable in the mouth.  Overall- This a very full bodied, intensely complex beer. It's too boozy in flavor for it's own good. What did I like about the beer? When it warms, the malty taste balances out some of the alcohol and sweetness. I will never buy this again. Not god offal, but not really my kind of IPA. I'll stick with the 60 and 90 minute IPA from Dogfish Head over this any day of the week. But this is a good beer if you like something more boozy tasting.  *My recommendation would be Avery Brewing's Maharaja for a high abv Imperial IPA over this any day of the week!*",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Clonies720,3.47,"12 oz bottle poured into snifter. This is relatively fresh 120 minute I think?, and not aged by me. Marked ""2012K 23:43"". 18% ABV.  Appearance: Fluffy off-white head. Pours a semi-clear golden orange color.  Aroma: A big hit of malty sweetness to my nose. A light fruity ester combined with a hint a pine and citrus. The aroma then melds into wet and juicy hops.  Taste: It's quite sweet. To the point of being cloy and nearly unbearable. Can't really taste the hops at all. Very bready.  Mouthfeel: Thick and full-bodied with a syrup/molasses-like presence on the tongue. Medium-carbonation.  Overall: Actually not half bad. I'll be interested to see where 1 year of aging on the 2nd bottle I have takes this beer. 18% ABV, and the wholly sweet nature of this brew make it a slow sipper to enjoy and warm up on a cold night.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,yottachem,4.57,"Sampled in small tulip.  Appearance: Pours thick (not quite motor oil) with minimal head. Very fine carbonation produces thin off-white ring around glass. Light copper in color with ruby highlights. Just barely darker than 90 min.  Aroma: Alcohol, fruity esters, raisin, pear, rum, dark caramel, brown sugar, over-ripe fruit. Malt produces a very complex sweetness that dominates the nose and the hops are very light in character.  Flavor: Wow, quite a complex beer. If one were to think about the flavors as you taste them it kind of goes like this: Very sweet, rum-raisin early in taste, alcohol burn, followed by hop-bite and then an alcohol warming sensation. Then the lingering bitterness decays to yield a soft malt sweetness followed by a final wave of hops. Dark toasted bread, peppery/spicy hops. Almost candy-like in it's sweetness. Presence of alcohol is dominant. Hop profile drops off as beer warms and the malt character comes forward more.  Mouthfeel: Med-full body with light carbonation. A surprisingly high carbonation level for this beer considering it's ABV. Bitter components are quite firm, but surprisingly ethereal. Ethanol burn warms down the throat to the belly.  Overall: Wow. Just wow. Flavor ""play"" between the hops, malt, and alcohol is incredible. Warms like a whiskey. Malt sweet is almost belgian-like in character but not belgian-dark (strong dark stone fruits). Hops play back and forth with incredible delight and doesn't completely destroy your palate with bitterness.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,gillagorilla,3.87,"12oz. bottle from 2011 into a pint glass  A: Dark golden amber with a rapidly diminishing head on the pour.  S: Surprisingly you can still smell the hops. It smells like a much more alcoholic version of their 90 minute. You can really get the citrusy-pine smell but it tinged throughout the smell. You can't escape it.  T: No hops whatsoever. Don't mistake this for a DIPA. It is quite sweet with a strong malt backbone. Just too strong ale for me.  M: Smoothy feel that is quite thick.  O: This is fine for samples, but a whole bottle is a lot to take in. I think I should have waited longer to let the alcohol die down. To be honest, I have no idea how they call this an DIPA. It is more like a strong ale or a barleywine. This beer really needs to be aged a while or drank superfresh on tap (like I had at DFH).",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

10099,9086,Prince_Casual,4.8,"A: Amber, Jurassic park type color. Crawled all over the glass  S: Boozy cocktail. The first time I 120'd all I could think was Grand Marnier + soda. There's more going on here, though. There's definitely bourbon'y flavors, not too much sweetness or vanilla which I hate, but a &lt;great&gt; counter to the booze.  T: Sickly sweet, bourbon over soda all the way. There's  M: = It really makes me think of a crown+ginger more than anything else. I'm a Hop person, but this is just straight booze, sweetness, (light) smoke, etc. Grand Marnier is also in the picture.  O: This IS a cocktail, letting it sit in a glass whilst doing other stuff is how to drink this. It develops before you open it, in the glass, and as you enjoy it. GREAT beer, in my opinion.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,BudsAndBrews,3.11,"A nice orange/light copper. The amount of head that accumulated at first was surprising considering the abv, but as expected it dissipated very fast. This beer shows its alcohol content in the glass. Looks slightly viscus and has decent legs on it.  Alcohol hits you most prominently on the nose. Behind the alcohol burn I pick up citrus (grapefruit, orange peel) supported very nicely by some big sweet malt notes. There are certainly some unique wine qualities in this beer. You might say tart grapes, or think there is a mead-like quality.  Taste is very much inline with the nose. I immediately felt the alcohol warmth. It starts with a nice amount of bitterness and finally leaves your mouth coated with a big residual sweetness.  Overall, a nice beer that needs to be drank at room temperature or just slightly cooler. Not a 12 oz. bottle to drink by yourself, but nice for a special occasion to share.

10099,9086,ThickNStout,3.84,"12oz bottle from iLOVEbeer (thanks man!). Bottled 2/15/13. Served in a Dogfish Head snifter.  Pours deep ruby hued gold with a half finger of near white head. Given the high alcohol, I'm surprised to see a good bit of spotty lace. The etching on the bottom of the snifter keeps bubble rising to maintain a thin hazy layer of head.  Smells punguent and sticky. Orange, pine, grapefruit and toffee. More subtle than expected for all the hopping that DFH touts. Still nice.  Taste is a blast of big sweet honey cake malts with a ton of hops. Orange, peach, citrus rind, fig, caramel, grapefruit and an almost oaky vanilla. Booze is there but it comes across as only half of what's actually in there. This is a great sipper to enjoy over 1-2 hours seeing as it seems to evolve a bit as it warms.  Thick, oily, slick yet sticky feel with a nice light carbonation. Long lasting sweet finish with a good dose of bitter.  Glad to get a whole bottle to try- the only other time I had this was only a couple ounces. Plenty of depth to enjoy over an extended sitting so I'm glad I took my time on this one. Also glad to have a 2011 to try soon to compare.

10099,9086,MattSweatshirt,4.02,So much anticipation on finally cracking the big ol' 120 ipa.  Poured a few oz into a small tulip giving way to a hazy orange body with a small white head. Long lasting head for such a high abv beer.  Lots of malt sweetness hits along with alcohol and fruity orange and peach hops.  A heavy handed malt sweetness comes through in the taste. Perceptible alcohol but definitely not over the top or anything. Fruity hop flavors.  The 120 is a syrupy smooth fairly full bodied beer.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,57md,4.33,"Appearance is an opaque striking copper with a thin layer of white head and plenty of floaties. The nose was dominated by citrus fruits and alcohol. A sweet malty taste dominates the flavor profile and this offering has a mouthfeel that comes off thicker than it actually is due to the lingering syrupy finish. Some hops are present, but they get drowned out by the sweetness and the alcohol.  Not what I expected, but good in an over-the-top kind of way.  April 2021 update: I haven't had this beer in a very long time. I spotted a four-pack that was ten months old and pretty cheap, so I grabbed it fast.  The almost year of age mellows out the alcohol considerably. This baby drinks similar to a first-class barleywine without the stale hop essence I get from most aged-barleywines. I hope that I have the discipline to put at least two of the bottles away for further aging.  January 2022 update: cracked open a bottle that's been aging for about a year and a half. It was indescribably smooth with a solid heavy malty sweetness. There is NO hint of any stale hoppiness.

10099,9086,matthewlikesbeer,5,"This isn't a regular review. I love this beer, and I only finished my second bottle.  About a year ago, I had this for my first time. Today my second. This review encompasses both experiences.  When I first saw this brew on a shelf of a local store, I was astonished. Without hesitation I picked it up. Got home, warmed up the tub, and opened up a Rolling Stone. Glass poured, I was blown away by the pleasant warmth, sweetness, fermentation, colour, scent, and simply appreciated this fine beverage. It was so good you'd think it'd be gone in 15 minutes, but the beverage satisfies, it lingers on your tongue, it was sipped for the course of a couple hours. Feeling good, having a cigarette, listening to classic rock, this was a beer to make you a king.

Flavor started off with a nice hit of hop bitterness. Finish was very sweet. Lots of malt and full bodied. Not as boozy as I would have expected. Glad I got to try it, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

10099,9086,laynethiele,5,"What I am reviewing here is a 2011 bottle of 120 Minute IPA. As I rate it a 5 across the board, I will tell you that two years I let this age, it will benefit from a few more. At that point, I would love to go higher if possible. Perhaps I am rating this on potential or the fact it is just an awesome beer already that is only going to get much better. I fortunately have one more in the cellar, so time will tell. If you are not tight with a great beer rep, seller, store etc by now, befriend one soon so you can get ahold of some brews like this. They are very limited and very expensive, but almost always worth it. This one was VERY worthy of the $11 price I paid for the 12 oz. bottle. Plus the two agonizing years of waiting. It IS that good.  Color was hazy, burnt-orange Nose of boozy, malty-bread, figs Taste of booze, malt, figs, vanilla, bourbon Mouthfeel is creamy, oily, awesomeness  If you have one now wait. If you have two, drink one and wait for the other. It is not your everyday IPA. AT ALL! It is more like a superior Barleywine with a hop presence. Any way you slice it, it's awesome.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,RollTide7,3.57,"Cloudy and light brown in appearance. Smell for me was not at all what I expected. I thought it be very hoppy, instead smelled boozy malty and a little fruity like fig. Taste was also very different and hard to detect much hops. Tastes much like it smelled for me, primary flavors were malty, caramel, figs etc. super high alcohol content not that noticeable. But beer is very sweet and different than I expected, (not hoppy at all). Glad I tried it but tastes more like a barley wine. Hated it at first, but grew on me as I got accustomed to the different taste. Definitely a unique brew that was a little misleading for me.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,hopsolutely,4,"A special treat to celebrate my 500th BA beer review, although I would have classified it as a barley wine rather than a DIPA? Bottled in 2011 and remarkably smooth. Has many of the elements of a good scotch, but I had no idea it was 18% ABV until looking at this site.  Pours a hazy, orange amber. It's oily and near-viscous in appearance, with no head and very little carbonation. Malt-forward aroma is milder than I expected, but still with a lot going on. I get a ""sharp bitterness"", with copper and oak, but am not doing it justice. The taste is more developed, with an initial malt sweetness that builds into a crescendo of more rounded bitterness during the body. The finish lingers for almost a full minute, and other than a hint of alcohol warmth at the end, there's no sign of the unbelievably high ABV. I can't pick out individual flavours to list, but it is both well balanced yet distinctly unique.  Although the bottle clearly mandates that this could be aged for decades, as a self-pronounced ""hop head"" I am disappointed that the citrus and tropical fruit tones have almost completely disappeared in the last year. Still an iconic beer on which I'm very glad to have splurged!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

10099,9086,themind,4.23,This beer has an interesting mix of flavors with a decent mouth feel. I have had this beer several times and each year it seems to be slightly different.

10099,9086,TempeBeerMan,4.99,"Poured from a bottle into a snifter. 2012 bottle aged about 6 months.  A - Pours a deep gold, almost amber, with a wispy, 1/2 finger head. (Pretty much as expected for an 18%'er) That said, the head maintained at least some presence all the way until the end of the glass. No lacing to speak of.  S - Immensely powerful aroma of freshly made toffee, sticky sweet breads, fusel alcohols which smell a little like magic marker, and an herbal/botanical blend. Smells closer to a barleywine or an old ale than a DIPA, but also totally unique.  T - Surprisingly, a candied sugar maltiness kicks things off in the form of pineapple, mango and orange marmalade, followed by HUGE hops of pine and some bitter grapefruit. Vinous white wine grape esters swirl about. Minty hop bite in the finish. The whole thing is drenched in booze, but I mean that in a good way as it's not at all ""hot"" on the tongue. ALL the flavors here jacked up to 11 and extremely rich. Some similarities to a good port wine. Man, this is amazing. Is there a way to rate something a 10?  M - Surprisingly delicate bodied, and slightly slick/sticky. Just enough carbonation to tickle the palate. Pretty spot on. Between the booze and the richness, the smallness of the sips I found myself taking while drinking this borders on the ridiculous.  O -Freaking amazing. Unique and complex. Too extreme? If your a wuss, maybe. If not, you can totally lose yourself in the depths of this powerful boozy beast. Yes, it's intense. Yes, the flavors can be jarring, and it might not be the most balanced beer available. That said...may I have another?",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Homebrewpat,4.49,"Have had this many times both on draft and by this bottle. THis is without a doubt an extreme brew. I think of it as the port of beers. Big Alcohol and Sugary hops up front, tropical and dark fruits as it warms. Very rich mouthfeel, similar to high end BW's. Taste is toffee, maple coated hops, figs, and booze. I feel it gets even better with age. Drink this bad boy over and evening and smell and taste the wonderful change as it warms.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,XicanoBeerRun,3.63,"Smells like sugar water and alcohol. You definitely smell more booze as it warms up. I poured half and drank it, and then poured the other half and drank it. Color is similar to other DFH brews like the ninety minute. More carbonation than I had expected. It tastes like beer with a shot of gin. It is sweet, but not too sweet. I like the novelty of an 18% abv beer but it isn't something that I would pick up every year. I will cellar one to see how it changes. I feel like 120 has a fan base like Fantome beers do, but I do not care for those much either.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,MadScientist,4.14,"Decided see what I had of intrest in my cellar so why not a five year old 120.  A: A hazy, medium copper with a deep reddish-orange hue. Some carbonation is evident in initial pour but it look fairly flat there after. The is just a small collar and a thin film of tiny off-white bubbles on top.  S: A mild citrus hops aroma is around but time has changed, I'm thinking of Tums but that could also be the moderately strong malt sweetness and moderate caramel malt aromas. Age had also brought a some moderate raisin notes and a touch of oxidation as well.  T: A rich malt sweetness with a solid hops bitterness. Note surprisingly the hops brillance has faded but there is still moderate lemon and citrus peel flavor along with a light raisin flavor. The balance is fairly bitter however there is a lot of sweetness from the malt. The finish is sweet and the aftertaste is a hops bitterness.  M: The light carbonation gives the perception is thicker than a medium-full bodied beer. Alcohol warmth is apparent  O: Even fresh this beer is has been a too sweet for my taste that sweetness has only increased as the hops have diminished their contribution. Time has mellowed the alcohols character and brought some raisin notes out from the malt.  Bottle 07/07/08",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,mfnmbvp,4.17,"12 oz. bottle, no bottled on or freshness date present. Super stoked to have landed one of these bad boys after waiting over a year to get my hands on one. Tried a friend's glass that he'd ordered on tap last year from Lunar Brewing in our hometown. Excited to try it and be able to fully appreciate it this time around. My first beer of the night, and most likely will also be my last beer of the night, it's 18.00% abv is destined to doom me.  Uncapped and poured into a Boulevard tulip.  A - Pours me a nice standard burnt sienna orange IPA color with tons of sediment and bubbles floating about, giving me a nice one and a half finger fluffy cream head. Looks great, but you wouldn't know this was the monster of an IPA that it is just by looking at it.  S - Tangy, wet, juicy, citrus hops. Fresh hop resins. Fresh grapefruit. A little bit of a alcohol pungency, but it is far from being anywhere near obvious. A fresh and lively type of smell. Would love to see what an aged version would smell and taste like.  T - Wow. Unforgiving blast of spicy bitter hops. Many different types of hop sensations to be had here. Juicy, fruity, floral. And then spicy and peppery. Definitely a beer to warm the soul on a winter's night. You would never know this beer is masking an 18.00% abv, although it is slowly working it's magic upon me. Sticky brown sugars begin to emerge as the beer starts to warm.  M - Very creamy texture to it almost, warming your throat on the way down. Sticky and resinous in the aftertaste, clinging to all sides of your mouth.  Overall, a beer that lives up to it's hype sufficiently well I'd say. Tremendous feat especially for what has to be one of the most bitter tasting IPA's on the planet, and one that ages well, no doubt. I would love to be able to snag another bottle or two to cellar away, but I don't see that happening for at least another year or so. Until then, I recommend snagging a bottle (or a case) while you can.  Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA ---4/5",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

The 90 minute IPA is my beer of choice. After having this, that has not changed. The biggest surprise from this beer is the sweetness. It is sweet like the Three Philosophers is sweet, with an IPA finish. Very interesting beer. Very tasty. I drank an entire 12 oz bottle to myself over a two hour period. I have three more that I am keeping for enjoyment at different times. Going to hold one for at least couple of years.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Trueant1,4.8,"Aged this bottle for one year.  Pours very little head as expected. Nice orange color. Smells sweet with a hint of alcohol. Good, but not great. Aging takes away some hop smells. Tastes of very sweet malt/alcohol duel. Malts win. Bitterness abounds but sweet sweet, medium flavored malts win here. Lightly carbonated completes the flavors. After the brew warms up, alcohol is more pronouned in the aftertaste. Where is the 18 % Most barley wines at 12% have more alcoholic flavors. Medium mouthfeel.

Slight undertones of mango and honey. A light earthy bitterness lends balance. The alcohol is present but not overwhelming. Impressive.  M - Medium-full body, creamy and oily. Average carbonation, warming alcohol, dry finish.  O - This bottle is around a year old now, and it has aged well. For a double IPA, it's pretty good. It's a tad too sweet for my taste, but still tasty. The alcohol is masked well, and is very drinkable at 18% ABV.

Basically just a half-full 1/8 inch layer of surface foam that immediately dissipates to a paper-thin ring around the edge of the glass. Average lacing with some alcohol legs.  S- Sweet malts infused with sharp alcohol that singes the nostrils plus some twangy hops. Notes of vanilla, caramel and brown sugar.  T- The alcohol is the first thing to sink its teeth in, followed by the toffee-like malt sweetness. Hops are there too, amazingly enough since this bottle's over a year old. Bitter and toasty aftertaste. A little bit of raisin too. Also some white grape-type tannins.  M- As said before, sharp and bitey while also syrupy causing the lips to smack repeatedly.

It is one of the best extreme high gravity beers you will taste with an abundance of hop aroma from the second you open the bottle. Deep rich color, smooth on the mouth and throat and finishes with a hoppy gasp at the end.  Best sipped from a brandy glass to take full advantage of the flavor.

T - Lots of sweet fruit notes, and you feel the heat of the alcohol just as if you are drinking a cognac or bourbon.  M - Very smooth but boozy.  O - Excellent beer, I did expect to have more of a hoppy IPA feel but instead got more of a straight alcohol feel but it was very smooth.

10099,9086,StuporJew,4.05,"6-month-old bottle from the June 2012 batch, appropriately poured into a DFH tulip.  A - Pours a burnt-caramel with a two-finger head that lingers about for a full 3 minutes, until the first sip is taken. HUGE amount of constantly-effervescent carbonation, proving that this beer still needs quite a bit of age to truly mellow and reach its' true potential.  S - Notes more akin to a Barleywine than an IPA, with hints of cognac-esque sweetness, and inherent fruitiness. Hops take a backseat, which is strange, but we all know that Sam does things a little differently at DFH. Also Toasty rye and barley malts and caramel, showing that the hops aren't the only star of this monster beer.  T - Creaminess and lighter hop-notes start the palate off, followed by more Cognac sweetness, and some mango and dates. I'm pretty sure that Mr. Calagione brewed some fruit into this one, on top of the candy sugar, because it's just too darned fruity to think otherwise. There is also some inherent dryness to the mid-palate, with the malts complimenting the loony shenanigans that is the whole of this beer, which, once again, IMHO, could use more age. Lucky me, I still have another bottle to hold on to for 6+ months.  M - Lively effervescence, creamy notes, and a lingering acidity round this Barleywine-like beast out well. Once again, NEEDS AGE. (The label doesn't lie...)  O - A nice treat for all the senses, at any time, holding in consideration that you don't have anything important to do, like operating heavy machinery, or taking care of a small human. And for the love of all that is holy, DON'T DRINK ONE AND DRIVE!!! Just by volume, this beer (This batch) is equal to a little over 4 Bud Lights in alcohol, or 2 shots of Jagermeister. It can do things to you, most of which are nice, if you (as previously mentioned) don't have anything pressing to do. Great with a Don Collins Rum-Dipped Cigarillo (From Viejo San Juan, Puerto Rico.... Look them up online, order some of their cigars and RUM, and thank me later!), or some applewood smoked Jerk chicken. I love this beer. If you don't, you haven't had it yet.

10099,9086,Celtics76,4.1,"2012 bottle. My last review for a while. Having a ""dry"" January to lose some weight and reignite my passion for craft beer.  Pours clear copper without much head, which quickly reduces to a light foam ring around the glass. Nice piney smell. Hops noted as well.  Sweet maple syrupy flavor with some pine & caramel notes. Does not taste like a pure Imperial IPA at all - there is a hop presence for sure, but not the bitterness one would expect. The high ABV is detected, but not as obvious as I thought it would be. Very heavy, syrupy mouthfeel with medium carbonation.  Dogfish Head did a good job with this but I would describe this as more of a scotch ale/barleywine/IPA hybrid as opposed to an Imperial IPA. I have to deduct points for the high cost and misrepresentation of the style. Tasty nonetheless, and one I would revisit every couple years.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,TBoneJones,4.59,"Updated review of a bottle marked 9/19/11 DFH 120 Mins. Very hazy amber pour into my snifter. Barely any head. Rich in appearance. Great velvety lacing. Smells like far-away citrus, a distant burn, a large beast with big malts and big everything else ipa. While barely a large aroma to decipher, it's amazing the alcohol is so muted under my nose, as we all know it's there big time. Taste is what it always is (as in prior below review). What else can I say, but this grows on me more each time I decide to open one.   Pours a sparkling amber with thick layer of particles/ little bubbles throughout my chalice. Body looks great, but the head is short-lived. Smells oaky, sweet malts, syrupy citrus (orange peel to me), some pine. Nice but subtle. I cant believe im not picking up alcohol here, esp. when im about to taste 18% Wow what a big beer. This is my second time trying it, and I think I like it more this time around. There's an intense rush off the bat. A bold sweet cognac burn that becomes a smooth & bitter orange-like citrusy finish, tingly all the way. This time around I like how the hops react with everything else to create a unique feeling. Syrupy, but very well balanced overall and smoothly warming for such a strong beer. I wish somehow the hops were even more present in the taste, as I know they were in making this beer. For what this is, it is well-made. Sporadic lacing. Something here reminds me of Devil Dancer (only as far as that beer's ambition is concerned), but this has better balance with malt backbone, and better hop-interplay. I also enjoy what citrus presence is here, and again DFH does a great job balancing malt and hops on this large scale (with the Founder's example i just mentioned, I felt indifferent because it's tough for me to dig big sweet IPAs that are mainly malt forward/cloying). But 120 Minute succeeds in its attempt while avoiding the aforementioned. A once-in-a-while-treat (this bottle was stamped as being bottled in 2012), the few bottles I have remaining I'm going to age another year or so in order to see what might evolve.

Tons of suagry (but not bomb-y) fruit. grape, fig, prune, apricot, mild heat. Heavy carbonation and tough to drink 12oz. by yourself... Very unique.

I am not sure what the alcohol percentage is but this is big. Lighter in body than a barley wine but not far off. This absolutely crushes the taste buds. Some grape sweetness and light caramel. Pine bitterness in the background and what more can I say...there isn't anything out there like this.  Medium mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. The alcohol is warming and has some characteristics of brandy. Subtle vanilla and more grapefruit as this warms. It also mellows a good deal as it warms. Lingering pine and resin.

S: The first thing that comes out is a semi-earthy hop smell. Then a caramel scent, and a sort-of sourness. I pick up alcohol on the nose as well.  T: It has an odd flavor. I get very mellow malty character and a slightly resinous hop character. I get some alcohol but it's more of a presence of alcohol than a flavor...it's hard to describe. It doesn't taste like alcohol but there's some light sweetness from the alcohol that floats in the background. This would be a very acquired taste, but I can't say it tastes bad or good so I'm marking it as average.  M: The mouthfeel is medium, and smooth. Drinkability is rather low...it's more of a sipper.  O: Overall I didn't find the beer to be all that pleasant to drink. I find it more of a novelty due to its high alcohol content.

Overall: It's a sipping beer, and it's something to enjoy over a period of time. Definitely not something you can pound at a bar. This definitely lived up to the expectations.

Smells of orange blossoms and a spiciness that I can't quite make out. Alcohol is present in the nose, but not as overpowering as I would expect.  Taste has a warmness to it, but the alcohol is masked pretty well. Not a hop bomb in the traditional way that you would expect. Tastes mostly of orange marmalade or orange blossom with a spicy warmness from the alcohol. It's a bit of a one note pony though to me. I can't pick up much complexity. Maybe a little pineapple.  Mouth feel is a bit syrupy, but I like the moderate carbonation.  I'm happy I picked it up, and it is definitely a well thought out and constructed beer. Hides the alcohol well and doesn't blow your tongue away with the hops, but I was a bit disappointed with what I felt was a bit one-dimensional.

10099,9086,JamesShoemaker,4.19,"12 oz bottle poured into an oversized wine glass. This is a fresh bottle, but, if I can, I like to sample extra-strong offerings fresh as well as aged. I've had it several times at several different ages, but I've heard that 4+ years is best.  A - good looking beer, very orange, but mysteriously translucent. Hardly any head, no carbonation apparent. Doesn't pour like the high ABV offering that it is.  S - oh my god, I love the way this beer smells. The alcohol is nowhere to be found. Some of the hops come through with the deeper whiffs, but mostly it's this strange, sour smell, not unpleasant, a lot like a wild or a gueze. Fruits, apples, oranges, none of the sweetness that comes through in the taste.  T - hmm. I like this. The bite doesn't come from the alcohol, more from the sour taste I detected in the smell. It's strong, but nothing like I'd expect 18% to taste like. Still very fruity, but this beer benefits from age for sure.  M - okay, here's where the beer lacks fresh a little bit. Fresh bite, not as syrupy as one would expect, but pretty clingy on the cheeks none the less. Coats the throat.  O - I like this fresh. The price deters me from buying it regularly, but it's a good offering.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,KC9LDB,4.66,"Bottle date: 2012 B 15:59. Purchased early 2012, I think the first batch shipped to my store, sat in the cellar ever since.  A: Opened with a great amount of carbonation, I smelled fruit instantly. Light careful pour into a scotch snifter which made little head that is still lingering. Standard IIPA color but very hard to see thru.  S: Really reminds me of Devil Dancer form Founders, I'm smelling more floral hops.  T: Sweet side, I get a good amount of malt which makes me wonder if this is better fresh. It changes up to a hard pine with a maple sweet kind of flavor and then finishes with apricot. Pretty amazing!  M: Carbonation is great, you can feel the alcohol but not the burn at all. On the thinner side than some IIPAs I've had in the past.  O: I am happy with the age, the other bottle I have will sit another year but next batch I'm going to have one fresh.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Ryki,4.2,"This beer is like the 90 minute IPA on steriods. It tastes like a very concentrated form of the 90 minute IPA. But because it is so concentrated it does not taste as good. It's like salt makes food taste better, but if you use too much salt the food becomes unpleasant tasting. At $9.00 a bottle it's way overpriced. For $9.00 you can get 4 bottles of the 90 minute IPA. Nice experiment but it doesn't work. Saying that the 90 minute IPA is one of my favorite beers of all time. Bought it, tried it, not for me.  I was told to dink this beer not cold and that was my first tasting, The 2nd bottle I had was cold. Tasted much better, still like 90 minute IPA on steriods but not quite as concentrated easier to drink. 2nd bottle I would rate taste 5.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

I think it was bottled sometime in 2012, but I am not sure about the month, and therefore, not sure about how long this beer has aged.  A: A fairly aggressive pour into a standard pint glass produced about half a finger of dense head that is a light khaki color. After a few minutes the head dissipated to a thin, patchy layer. All-in-all, pretty good head retention for this level of ABV. The brew is a golden-orange with just a little haze. It is easily translucent and there are steady streams of carbonation rising to the head.  S: The aroma is a blend of pine and grapefruit citrus with some sweet malt in the mix, too.  T: There is a strong sweet malt backbone that supports and balances a bold hops blend of pepper, citrus, and pine, along with yeast flavors of bread and clove.  M: The body is just a touch to the heavier side of the medium range, and there is lively level of carbonation that seems to fit this beer well. It is also surprisingly easy drinking and smooth.  O: This is definitely a top-notch double IPA. The malt and hops are both big and bold, but, they balance each other and play-off each other well. And, the alcohol is well hidden for this level of ABV; so, it is also an easy drinking beer. It is well worth trying for hopheads and double IPA fans. This is a first class offering in the hyper competitive arena of big, hoppy beers.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,jrenihan,4.05,"Bottled 2012G (July?)  Beer is a clear amber colour with a small to medium sized off-white head. Fades quite quickly.  Smell contains a lot of pine resin and generous amounts of caramel, grapefruit, pineapple, mango and other fruits.  Taste is a surprise. A lot fruitier and brighter than I expected (I was sort of expecting little more than a boozy mess). Surprisingly tropical, with mango and pineapple coming out prominently. PIne is there as well. Booze, unsurprisingly- a pretty hot beer. Caramel malt.  Full bodied, moderately carbonated, lots of alcohol heat. Of course, when a brew gets to this level of ABV, you can't drink it like a beer.  Overall, I really like this one. I had it a couple of years ago and liked it a lot but was curious what I would think the second time around. Still like it a lot. Rather unique and not surprising that it gets mixed reviews. I am in the positive camp!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Pretty sweet on the palate.Big sweet fruit notes, tropical notes, well balanced for how chaotic it could be..some warming alcohol  Big chewy body on this..slightly bitter finish  Definitely a sipper but highly drinkable in that realm. You pay for the ABV but there's a good beer behind all of that.  ---  Sipping this same batch now 12/15/13  Very dense looking beer. Some floaties and bubbles around the glass.  Hops are very subdued. Sweetness and malt has taken over. Caramel, candied pineapple, a touch of booze.  Incredibly sweet. Caramel malt, brown sugar, nearly no hops. Very little bitterness.

Beer poured orange with a pretty good white head considering its age.  Nose is wonderful, dark fruits, large malts, definitely the aroma of an aged barleywine with some imperial pilsner.  Taste is very good, dark fruits, hints of citrus, enough hop bite still left to balance out the ginormous malt backbone. Alcohol warming on the first sip but remains in the background with subsequent sips.  Mouthfeel is superb, full bodied and smooth, totally satisfying.  Overall i was not sure what i would get with a combination ageing between the beer fridge, the wine cooler, and my closet. It turned out far better that i hoped. Will have to definitely do this again!  9-2-18: Reviewing a bottle purchased on 4-26-14 from the Bell Road BevMo for $8.99. Bottled on 3-27-14. Been stored in the wine fridge for 3 years and the beer fridge for a year plus.  Notes: Drinking like a quad IPA, maybe 15-16% abv, alcohol is warming but it is drinking like an IPA as the hops are lightly bitter in the finish. Flavors are pretty nicely melded.

M-Low carbonation is present with a heavy, syrupy body that coats the inside of the mouth. An extremely unique ""IPA"" that is full of alcohol (I can already feel the ABV in the middle of this review!).

There is also a caramel/sugary/pineapple sweetness and it ends with a bitter hop aftertaste.. but not as bitter as I would have expected.

Scattered lacing.  S: Huge, boozy, and fruity. A touch of hops (and maybe even citrus) underneath the strongly sweet alcohol.  T: Better than the recent bottle I sampled. Lighter and less oppressively sweet. It doesn't taste as strong as it is. Hops on the endtaste linger on in the sweet-dry aftertaste/finish. A more balanced maintaste than the bottle -- loads of hops are still completely overridden by honeyed alcohol, but it's not cloying. Well-made if...overambitious?

10099,9086,tectactoe,3.67,"On tap at the Oak, 6-oz in a tulip. Nice golden-yellow with strong overtones of orange. A bit foggy in the glass, small white head that doesn't last for long. The nose is oh-so-powerful, full of hops, citrus, and alcohol to the max. Going into this knowing it's an ~18% ABV beer, I was nervous about the taste. To my surprising, it's not nearly as strong or overbearing as you might think. The brew is laid out with a malt character, toasted grains, and a bit of yeast. On top of that are wild, bitter hops, and intense citrus flavors. The bitterness is balanced well by the citrus and the malt. Now I'm not saying the alcohol wasn't noticeable - it certainly was. It provided a strong bite on the forefront and fizzled into an intense warmth and tingling sensation for the rest of the sip. You can feel it warming up your throat and stomach on the way down, too. BUT - it worked well with the beer and was done quite masterfully. It wasn't too strong, making the beer undrinkable, rather it turned the beer into something you have to sit and sip gently, like a fine whiskey. Thick, heavy, carbonated a ton, and a bit sticky on the mouth.  Overall, this isn't something you'd relax with and throw back a sixer. It's obviously much to assertive for something like that. It deserves more care and pampering, like a top shelf mixer. Even though this beer wasn't the greatest, it provided a nice experience and is something I would definitely have again, given the time.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

S: There is a pleasant tropical fruit and grapefruit smell. Finishes with a nice booze burn.  T: As expected there is malty toffee backbone. There is a very pronounced hop smack to the face but not as much as expected. The grapefruit is more pronounced that the tropical fruit with a long lingering bitter finish.

O: I have been waiting for years to try this bastard, but I always seemed to missed the boat. Now that I have had it I would have to say I am a little let down.

A- Very nice orange/gold. Clear, with some sediment, and a half finger of white head, that dissipates very quickly, but laces very nicely. Alcohol legs are very evident.  S- Big sweet notes of pineapple, mango, and booze.  T- This is so well crafted, and the complexity of making this brew is just mind boggling. Yes there is alcohol warmth, booziness, and a bit of a burn, but you have to expect that at 18%. Very sweet pineapple, mango, a bit or orange, with a nice bitter citric hop bite. The family lines are very distinguishable to 60 and 90. An amazing Impy IPA that everyone should at least try.  M- thick and slightly syrupy. A pretty active carbonation, heavy side of medium. Not as dry on the finish as I thought it would be.  O- Few beers live up to the ""hype"", but I for one believe that 120 does. Will certainly get this again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Explosion of fruits, mango, peach, nectarine, orange, pineapple, grapefruit, toffee. Sweet malt provides a perfect counterbalance to the assault of hops.

S- I get a ton of citrus, there is quite a bit of pine as well. Mine doesnt smell to fresh because it has an overly ripened earthy grapefruit smell. The malts smell pretty sweet and a tiny bit of alcohol warms the nose.  T- Surpringly low hop bitterness/intensity at first. The beer does however have a consistently high feel of bitterness. The hops are quite floral. A lot of citrus is present as well, a bit of orange and grapefruit as well as lemon. The malt backbone is sweet, very sugary, syrupy. I can definitely taste the alcohol in this beer so I wasn't surprised however it could be more intense. The fresh hop taste of mine has faded but that doesn't keep this from being a monstrously hoppy brew. Surprisingly balanced but keep in mind of the 18%.  M- Thick, syrupy, bitter and boozy. So in my opinion, nice stuff. And hot, quite warming.  O- Know what your getting into before trying a bottle but I encourage everybody to try this once.

Sweet, like a bourbon infused toffee, with a moderate trailing bitterness but the malts dominate the show, unbalanced. Two gigantic positions of hop & malt fighting it out.

It looks like a beer and even retains its head. I aged it for about a year and the smell is still a blast of peach, mango fruity astringent juicy hops reminiscent of a stronger 90 minute mixed in with a the sweet bready smell and an alcohol spice mixed in with the fruity hoppyness.  The taste is that peachy mango fruity juicy hop flavor with the alcohol spice and bready caramel sweetness malts you find in the 60 and 90. Its an amazing beer that is very drinkable. I remember having a sample of this on tap and it was a brighter hoppier taste. This is a bit more subdued but still mixing in so well with the rest of the beer.  This is all about hop flavor which is still a rather blast of it and then the drying bitterness at the end but not too much at all.

The aroma reminds me of a DIPA, but with a bit more malt sweetness. Mostly tropical and floral hop notes, especially apricot. The aroma seems to linger and evolve as it warms with different notes taking the forefront.  The flavor is even better than I remembered. Plenty of sweet maltiness but the hops do add a very substantial balance. The hop flavors are not bitter, but follow the aroma very closely. I'm a bit surprised that the alcohol does not come through, but it is only slightly noticeable to me.  Fairly thick and oily texture in the mouthfeel.

Anyway the beer was served in a wine glass  no head whatsover, not even a lil lip bumper.  tasted so overwhelmingly like alcohol - it had none of that IPA hop bouquet that I look for.  Took awhile to drink - after the first few sips the burn was so much that I felt like I needed a nice refreshing IPA to use a a chaser for this beer.

10099,9086,KKB,4.43,"Alright, before I even crack this girl open, I have to remark: 18% alcohol? Kiss my mother loving grits, that is a dirty girl. I've been sitting on this beer for a while now, waiting for the right moment, and now, tonight, on a wonderful isolated Friday night, I shall indulge.  A - The appearance is a molasses orange peel with a milk-white head that is about a half of a finger. Great lacing, great retention.  S - The smell explodes with hoppiness and pine resin which overrides the immense alcoholic nature of this beverage, you can definitely smell the alcohol though (actually it's pretty in your face, especially as it warms), and there is a grapefruit quality to it as well.  T - Wow. Woah. Wee. Wowoahwee. This crosses the line between beer and liqueur. I've been told the difference maker with this beer is that you need to approach it with the right attitude, this is not a beer to chug, you need to take small sips, like your drinking whiskey. Entirely unique. The obvious flavor here is orange. I'm actually surprised at just how drinkable this is. And it's GOOD. My god is this good. But it's so different, I feel like it belongs in a class of it's own. Overwhelmingly bitter/sweet with a warming sensation that is no longer a warming sensation but an outright alcohol burn as it goes down into you. This might not be for everyone but it is for me...Towards the end the flavors become more and more sweet with almost a juicy fruity flavor to it and yet a big dry alcoholic finish. Crazy hops in this one, crazy alcoholic, great fruit flavors. I love this beer. So unique. So good. I am definitely going to pick up another one the next time I see it.  M - Full bodied to be sure, but I've had barley wines that are thicker and more gooey than this. It's owing to just the right amount of carbonation that keeps it from being bogged down. Just perfectly crafted.  O - What more can I say. I've never had anything like this in my relatively short beer drinking career. I can't compare it to the 60 or 90 minute because this beer is completely unlike them even while it is like them.

10099,9086,TappaKeggaBrew,3.58,"A: Deep, orangy-amber (I rated it higher than I otherwise would have for the interesting color). Golden head with large bubbles, faded quickly without much lacing.  S: Floral and citrus hops, definitely. A little malt. Sweet fruit, perhaps grape juice, trying to peek through the stronger aromas.  T: In-your-face intensity from start to finish! First, very sweet malt, almost like extra sugar was added to help boost the ABV (initially it reminded me of a mead). Next, a biting wave of grapefruit juice, both tart and bitter. There are some mild phenolic and (banana-like) ester notes later. Finally it moves toward a strong finish of pine needles, with a lingering bitterness that slowly recedes.  M: Crisp and well-carbonated, but I hardly noticed in the face of such intense flavors. There was a little astringency in the finish.  O: I'd put this in the category of a strong liquor, meant to be sipped in small quanities to sample the flavors, rather than enjoyed in any quantity. It really isn't worth $10 a bottle to consume all by yourself (even the 6-ounce half-pour I had splitting the bottle with a friend was wearing me down by the bottom of the glass) -- Get 5 buddies together and each of you can have 2 ounces, which will be enough to fully appreciate all the nuances without it getting old.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

The nose: I have a bad sense of smell but this thing is making my nose do cart wheels. Lots of floural notes and even a carmel scent. Maybe what I'm noticing is just a sweet scent that is kinda carmel like.  The taste is like a mouthful of sugary sweetness up front. The hop bitterness really is rather low for what I expected for an IIPA. I would almost compare this to a fresh hoppy barleywine. It's either there's too much of a sweet malt front, or not enough of a hoppy bite. With the amount of hops they use, I think it's more of the prior.  Mouth feel is HIGH in alcohol burn. Almost like drinking a good whiskey. But the body is perfect for the style.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Citrusy hops, pine, cedar and oak all present with a bit of caramel and earthy malt tucked in the background.  T: It's definitely a big boy, but this is smooth as hell. Big and malty upfront with a firm and piny hoppy backbone. Alcohol is definitely there , tastes a bit like grand marnier, but it's remarkably well hidden.

Drank slowly to enjoy all of the hoppy flavors we love coming at you larger than your normal hop experience. Pours with a nice mellow head and a deep shade of autumn color. Nose is sweet caramel and hops, with a definite presence of alcohol but to be expected. The taste is smoother than the aroma - while alcohol is present - it is not the first experience which is more sweet maybe a Belgian candy with floral to spicey hops present.

I bought 3 of these to try out. Interestingly, the first I drank straight from the bottle - which, honestly, I prefer 90% of the time. But my first Dogfish Head 120 I hated. I thought it was horrible, and actually hard to even finish. I compared it at the time to how kerosene might taste. But a few nights later I poured it into a frozen glass. Wow. I have no idea what makes it different, but it was. It went from horrible to great, and after drinking the last one I just wish I had more. Truly one of my favorite beers I've ever had. I found it to indeed have a bitter taste, but a very smooth and not overly hoppy bitter taste. Hard to explain. Also - as the glass and beer got warmer, it got even better. Don't hesitate to try this one. But - give it a chance. I often find good beer takes a while to ""come around"" and this was no exception. I don't know if this review will help you.

10099,9086,JimsArcade,4.57,"Pours a dark, almost ruby-amber with almost no head. The aroma is an explosion of fruity hops and booze. Everything about this beer on paper should make for an unbalanced mess, but in reality everything comes together nicely. Hop oils, syrupy malts, and alcohol blend into a surprisingly easy to drink concoction. In no way should anyone ever have more than one in a single sitting, especially in public (I can attest to this!). This beer begs you to dare it, though, as it's so drinkable. Instead, save the extra sampling for a friend so they can enjoy it as well.  120-Minute is the reason I stopped using the name ""Double IPA"" for this category. Some people who use that name consider this beer more of an American Strong Ale or Barleywine.

Smell: toffee, sweet fruits, apricot jam and almost a bit like potpourri.  Taste: Starts off very sweet followed by an ocean if delicious hops, alcohol is well hidden but presents itself slowly but subtle but warms you up sip after sip, apricot and grapefruit rind, finish off with rye bread blending Quickly into biscuit like flavor as It settles on palate. After taste feels like i just had some Marble Rye with apricot jam, and feeling warm and fuzzy.  Mouthfeel: very oily and syrupy, not to thick but not light, very medium weight type of feel, starts oily but almost finishes a bit dry with some slick spots like after it rains, the sun dries a good part of the pavement but still leaves some wets spots, the 18% of alcohol in this does not leave the mouth dry, pretty much a perfect finish.  Overall: This is now the best IPA i've had so far, DogFish nailed this one in my book, the recipe on this is top class, well done my friends! $10 per bottle was well worth and i'm now aging 2 bottles which 10 years from now I can only imagine how awesome it will be.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Pours cloudy amber with a small white head that leaves some short-lived lacing and recedes to a light cap and ring.  The aroma is a big potent punch of resinous hops and alcohol. Grapefruit, apricot, a lot of caramel malt, pine, sinus-clearing alcohol. Very strong strength.  Flavor is more intense hop resins, apricot, pine, loads of caramel malt which offer some sweetness to balance the bitterness. Also a lot of warming alcohol, but that is to be expected.  Mouthfeel is medium/full bodied, very sticky, oily, good carbonation.  Incredibly unique beer. A monster. Borders on a Barleywine or even beyond. Is it the best IPA I’ve had? No, not even close.

10099,9086,HardTarget,4.53,"2012 vintage, sampled fresh.  Appearance: Going to give big points here for being able to hold a collar at 18% abv. The glass is a viscous orange amber that shows slowly rising bubbles. Good clarity.  Smell: Heady alcohol vapors carry loads of sweet malt base supporting a slightly earthy hop oil. Total package goes for sugary syrupy sweetness with an almost raspberry ester.  Taste: Scary how well the alcohol is hidden. A Barleywine sweetness gives exuberant amounts of malty goodness. Alcohol flashes a hint of medicinal, almost vodka sterile then helps evaporate all the sweetness. Slight caramel, creme brule crust, with that dark, bruised fruit ester, almost a raspberry jam. There and undercurrents of viney, leafy hop oils, but they don't even pretend to provide any balance.  Mouthfeel: Numbing, lightly carbonated, deceptively thin, yet deeply oliy body.  Overall: Hard to be objective with a legend like 120. I've enjoyed many bottles over the years and have found that this is the only beer that actually becomes hoppy-er with age. All the sugars and alcohol seem to meld a bit with time and let some of the leaf show. Not with this fresh sample though, pure sugar and alcohol driven, smooth barleywine.

Wow, very powerful IPA here that gives up some appeal due to the booze and medicine flavor. The hops come through and it's bitter, but I get too much of the issue previously mentioned.

The aroma was of a sweet grain malt, pine and citrus hops and a sweet soapy yeast with notes of apple, citrus (orange and grapefruit), pineapple, caramel and a slight alcohol tinge.  The taste was very sweet with a mild maltiness and had hints of caramel and orange early on, and then became very hoppy with a strong boozy grapefruit note and a touch of candi sugar and pineapple at the finish. The flavor hung on for a very long time with a sweet hoppy alcohol burn left to fade away slowly.  Mouthfeel was almost medium in body with a syrupy texture and a very soft carbonation.

Beautiful bubbles, well carbonated. The nice deep copper/orange color is indicative of a big IPA.  S-Sweet whiskey is the line leader here.

Well, this hophead would like to pick up some hop aroma, and that is just not happening here.  T- OK, now I pick up the hops, but this is way too sweet.

10099,9086,TheBrewo,3.91,"We crack a bottle of the 2011 stock and pour a rich, caramel colored brew. It holds a one finger head of beige bubbles, showing very nice retention. This clings to the glass as it goes, leaving a single sheet of lacing down the walls. Big aggregates remain throughout the entire tasting. There is a thick haze, but no sediment is noted. Carbonation appears light. The aroma is much like a Scotch ale or American barleywine. There are deep caramel malts, with buttery diacetyls sweetness. Additional sweetness comes from strawberry, fig, and pear. This all sits against a massive fusel alcohol sting, and some light woody qualities. There is mild phenolic bite of medicinals and plastics with warmth. Our first impression is that the taste is so fruity, and that the booze is surprisingly subdued, at least in the beginning. As we sip, sugary sweet dextrin caramel malts hit, along with fermented prunes, raisins, and sweet banana. The front is very syrupy, and big and bready. Sweet honey adds to the drink. The middle peaks with a bit of the alcohol, imparting a peppery bite. More raw honey continues, with the raisin enhancing, cutting back all of the other fruity elements. These do their best to cut the booze, but fail through the end, as a huge fusel peppery bite cleanses the palate of all life. The fruit stays sweet, but becomes more tropical, with pineapple sugars. Hops are finally present, with a light citric brush. The aftertaste breathes of more honey sweetness to cut the booze, black pepper, caramel malts, plum, raisins, and light lactic sours. The body is full and thickly syrupy, and carbonation is low. Each sip gave a sticky, sugary coating around the mouth and to the lips, which became pursed and puckered due to the booze and the sweetness. The mouth is eventually dried from the coating, as the booze evaporates all moisture. The abv is massive, warming, and catches up with you, and drinkability is certainly slow.  Overall, what we enjoy most about this brew is the boldness of flavoring, and how fruity it is. We were a little disappointed that the hops didn’t hold up as well in either the nose or the taste, but the fruitiness really did surprise us. There are deep and syrupy notes which really help to cut the booze. Even with warmth the booze does not seem as strong as it actually is, which makes for a tasty, sippin’ treat.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Almost burns the nose.  T- Starts sweet then transitions smoothly into the hops. Hops are present and strong, but not overpowering. Definite caramel and toffee flavors are present among the sweet flavors. Slight hint of coffee/coffee bitterness is also in there. Sweetness returns and is dominant throughout the drink. Alcohol spiciness ends the drink.  M- Thick and creamy. Little to no carbonation. Alcohol heat is fairly intense, but well hidden for 18%. A nice sipper.

It's incredibly sweet. If it weren't for the medium body & carbonation this thing could be like a barleywine. Hops do peer through in the sips - they'd have to considering how much is in there - but this isn't really a beer for hopheads or even big IPA fans. It's just not like any other IPA in the world. It'll disappoint some and surprise others, but yeah, everyone should give it a shot.  Considering how expensive it can be, one bottle is plenty, for a few years at least, but I bought a couple to age this time. The hops are hardly present in there now, so I'm not worried about losing them to let the rest of the beer mature. It could be nice. I guess we'll see.  Dogfis Head knows how to market this thing.

Don't get me wrong, the hops are certainly present and ready to drop nuclear bombs on your palate, but it is a smooth, maple syrupy texture/taste that really makes this beer excel. Not a hint of alcohol, some mild heat going down, no burn in the throat whatsoever.

10099,9086,Philousa,3.85,"Imbibed at Good Karma on 7/19. Reviewed from notes.  Opaque orange with a thin layer of white head. Color reminds me of the spots on a giraffe. The head come out well with a stiff swirl and sticks around a while. They definitely tapped this right. Extremely piney and a little tingly on the nose. Hops dominate, as expected. Vinous an weedy with concentrated nectar. Slightly metallic malt, but that may just be the alcohol aroma burning my nostrils. Nice pale malt flavor up front. I actually get some biscuit and creaminess before the hop assault. The pine is thick and it turns metallic, like it's concentrated enough to qualify as an acid. It's akin to an attack on my taste buds, leaving them smoldering and tingly. That said, there is some nectar and sweet thickness reminiscent of honey. Hot alcohol flushes the forehead after a while. First time I've had that from a non barrel aged beer. This has a good amount of body, not surprising considering the amount of malt put into this. Dry finish also unsurprising.  This was a hop monster through and through. I'm really quite amazed that they were able to pull off such a highly alcoholic beer that was even remotely balanced. Sure it was acidic, but it was palatable. Big props for that. The taste is something different, a little one note. To be expected for sure, since this is somewhat of a novelty.

Taste is massively sweet with tons of caramelized malts and sugar, with a nice dose of hops that still shine through after a few years. Grapfruits and oranges, which get swept away by the boozy burn in the finish.  Mouthfeel is close to that of a dessert wine - port-like really. Low, soft carbonation and heavy sugary feel.

10099,9086,r0nyn,3.57,"Poured from a growler into my DFH snifter. 2012 vintage.  At first blush, 120 Minute looks like any other IPA, but once it settles it the glass, it becomes apparent that you're not dealing with just a regular pale ale. It's the color of apricots, but with a hazy hue to it. The head is finely frothy, and it leaves a lot of oily, spotty lacing, a surefire sign of the high alcohol content. The smell is fruity, with a definite sweetness to it that belies the potency of the brew beneath. To its credit, the booziness only becomes noticeable after the beer warms up a bit, and even then it's not overpowering.  On the first sip, it's obvious that whatever hops may have been in this beer to start have been completely enveloped by the maltiness, because all that appears is booze and sweetness. There is honestly little complexity beyond that. Oh sure, there's a lot of caramelized sugar with notes of citrus and a bit of cherry, but it can't even come close to balancing the alcohol, providing a cloying aspect that does little to counter the boozy punch. With this much weight behind it, every sip feels laden and syrupy. Carbonation is fairly minimal and the aftertaste is all sweetness, but thankfully fleeting.  I've liked all of DFH's Minute series up until this point, but 120 Minute just seems too... unfinished and raw to be considered a viable beer at this point. I'd probably need to give this beer another five years before attempting to drink it again, and at that point it might as well be a barleywine.

I have to admit I'm shocked that this critter wound up with a three finger, slanted cap of bubbly foam. That said, the head thins in a moderate hurry, leaving sparse specks of lace. Thin layer of retention. Heck, lace actually improves. The overall appearance is fantastic considering the abv.  There's no denying 120 Minute smells like alcohol; it's in the nose from start to finish. The plus side is there are other strong aromatics that shift the focus from the booze. The down side is they are mainly sugary and sweet. Compacted grapefruit flesh and pith surrender the only citric note in the aroma. From there, some floral tones emerge. On the whole, the hops have a solvent bent. Candied fruit, caramel, plum, sherry. Hints of bread and raisin.  Oh, my heart. Each sip is brutal - it's all sugar and alcohol. Sure, hops are in here. It's a big oily mess of a concoction that leaves a barrage of sugars to rule the roost. Candied fruit. Sweet bread. Caramel. Figs. Prunes. Raisins. Something in here tastes peppery or spicy like rye, but I know it's probably just a trick of the brain. Wow, this is sugary to the max.  The feel is a fat, sluggish, oily thing; slick with alcohol and sticky with sugars. Alcohol heat lingers long on the finish. Carbonation is on the lower side of average, but manager to poke this lazy critter in the keister.  Man, I remember the first time I had 120 Minute IPA. It was early October 2008 at my cousin's old place in Portland. I'd flown in for the Robert Plant & Allison Krauss show and rented a Corvette, which garnered dirty looks form the bike turds downtown. Anyway, Jeff took me to several beer destinations, but I picked up the 120 Minute at a Fred Meyer (side note - I was shocked that my Kroger Plus card was valid there). I was stoked as all hell to try this rarest of IPAs, since we tend to not see it 'round these parts what with the abv cut-off and all in Ohio. Jeff handed me a snifter for the occasion and I remember being entranced and in utter awe at how amazing the beer was. I thought it was the best thing ever. Jeff must have thought I was a loon.

10099,9086,Neorebel,4.13,"DFH 120 appears to be slightly hazy, with a golden brown/amber hue. It's head is only a thin sliver, but it is quite sticky and frothy. There seems to be some light carbonation, as I see bubbles rising from the bottom of my ordinary glass. Ultimately, the appearance is very good. The aroma is 'roasty,' and spicy, although I pick up a lot of pineapple and bitter citrus hop notes as well. Curiously, it seems the brew has a malt backbone to it, along the obvious truckload of hops. Now for the taste- wow! First and foremost, It really knocks you over with the alcohol presence, very full body, and thick, syrupy mouth feel. I was right about the malts... believe it or not, there is a good amount of malt sweetness ever-present in the flavor. For the hops... these are the more 'piney' hops that come right in with the malts. With the ABV and body, it bites so hard it's almost like taking a sip of hard liquor. I'd almost say there is some balance here, but once the finish kicks in and the beer is down the hatch, the very, very dry, bitter hops do take over completely. Not that I mind, you see. I knew exactly what I was in for when I bought this. A real treat for hop heads, American strong ale fans, and if you age this one, I'd imagine you'd come out with something similar to a Barley-wine.

Nice co2, Beautiful looking beer  Aroma: Hops with a very well balanced malt sweetness. Dry Fruit, Very suttle aromas  Taste: Strong hop agressiveness at first but very balanced as it finishes. Kind of like Pliny as in you expect so much hop but its balanced to a point where it blends together well. Strong alcohol but thats expected.  Mouthfeel: Thick, syrupy, then somewhat dry and crisp.  Overall: Very good beer. Got it from a trade So I did not pay the outrageous price. However in the future I would not pay the Price. DFH is my favorite brewery however. Great beer. Satisfied.

Bubbles of carbonation rise from the center of the glass.  Spicy pine on the aroma. Very rich. Very ripe citrus and plenty of alcohol.  Very sweet, but with a lingering citric tartness as well. Lightly bitter in the end. Big taste of alcohol, naking it seem almost medicinal.  Rather full bodied. Syrupy and oily at the same time. Burn of alcohol in both mouth and throat.

IMO, DFH IPA's all have a characteristic smell/taste that is noticeable in all of them, can't really place what it is, but I'm not really fan. A little bit of booze.  Taste: More floral hops that are very bitter, but not as much as I'd expect. Honey-caramel malt balances. Boozy nail polish finish (i.e. unpleasant)  Mouthfeel: At first this seems very drinkable, but then it becomes very medicinal and syrupy. Very warming.

10099,9086,kemoarps,3.92,"I was quite excited to try this beer. Having heard great things, I went in with high hopes indeed.  The pour renders a rich amber product, any head at the pour dissipates immediately, with a couple bubbles popping up from time to time.  The nose only served to amplify my excitement. There's certainly alcohol, though I notice the malts before the hops. This surprises me somewhat, but there is still a bitterness hiding behind it all.  This is absolutely a sipping beer. Some sweet caramel malts drip across the backdrop of brandy, balanced by a piney/citrust hop character.  Think of this almost more as a cordial in terms of how you would drink it. It's good, overall, but wasn't quite what I was expecting. I would drink it again, but won't be scouring as hard as I was to find this first bottle. Wonder what aging it would bring?",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,DewTheBrew,3.55,"Curiosity got the best of me on this one. While it was a very great quality IPA, I have a hard time justifying buying a case of beer for over 40 dollars let alone 200, but I was given the opportunity to buy a bottle for 10 bones from a friend. One bottle had me feeling it. Very nice to sit with and sip on slowly. Should be served at a warmer temperature than most. Again, final regards are that this beer is very good but no where near worth what it is priced at. I'm pretty sure it's hand-bottled, which means that most of the money is just going to employees that haven't been replaced by machines yet.

10099,9086,flayedandskinned,4,"Bottled in 2011 Poured into a standard tulip glass Aged almost 2 years. I had this fresh on tap once and I had mixed feelings on it. Once I have a chance to try this fresh in a bottle or on tap again I will update my review to include a fresh take.  Appearance: Pours a cloudy sunrise orange with a small finger of white head which dissipates extremely fast(as expected at 18% ABV). Surprisingly, a little bit lacing mixed in with the massive alcohol legs.  Aroma: This smells like a dynamite barleywine with a couple of years on it. Faint citrusy hops, sweet bready malt with honey highlights. Pretty interesting what a couple of years will do to this beer. Of course a little bit of alcohol peeking through it all. Overall, this really smells like freshly baked orange muffins.  Taste: Oily, citrus-y hops right away which oddly enough take on an assertive lime characteristic rather than the usual grapefruit notes, though age has definitely subdued them. Bready, honey infused malt quickly follows. The alcohol rears it's ugly head a bit, but the sweetness from the thick malt really keeps it at bay for the most part. Finishes dry, bitter and lemony. Slightly warming on the finish. Honestly getting a bit of a Gin and Tonic vibe on the finish.  Mouthfeel: Big, full bodied, VERY nicely carbonated for its size(moderate carbonation) and the bottom line: Dogfish has managed to make a huge, 18% beer drink like a beer!  Overall: Very tasty and a rare treat here in California. Huge thanks to MykelJH for hooking me up with this bottle! Recommended to anybody who doesn't mind something different or a little bit of sweetness in their beers.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,SebD,4.12,"Appearance: It has a nice cloudy deep golden/orange color to it. It has a nice off-white head that dies down moderately and leaves some nice lacing.  Smell: The aromas definitly give out hints of citrus, grapefruit,, pine and caramelly malts.  Taste: Like the aromas, it has a tropical hop character to it with some piney hops, sweet caramelly malts and a definite booziness.  Mouthfeel: It has a low/medium carbonation with a nice overall balance and feel.  Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with good flavors and aromas.

10099,9086,bensbeers,4.33,"Poured from a bottle into a snifter. Already enjoyed first half of bottle...on to second half...  A great looking beer. Poured a rich orange color with a huge, creamy head. Color of head was similar to that of vanilla ice cream. Lots of tiny, sparkling bubbles rising up to form a sheet of foam on the top of the beer throughout the session.  For me, the aroma was mostly grains. I got a strong whif of rice similar to how sake smells - with undertones of hops. Also noted the fumes from the high ABV.  The taste was a total 180 from what I was expecting. I imagined I'd taste a fruity, hop-centric beer, but instead found the taste was mostly malty and VERY sweet. I found the sweetness to be similar to that of chocolate...lots of toffee/caramel flavors with the slightest bitterness. Also reminded me a lot of a dessert wine, brandy or rum...especially when you consider the high ABV. I thought the alcohol would be much more pronounced than it was, but it seemed to have been mellowed out by the rich flavors.  Mouthfeel was unlike anything I've ever tasted. Moderate carbonation, but much creamier than other IPAs. Creamy and smooth all the way down.  Overall, I really enjoyed this offering from Dogfish Head. I'm a loyal follower of the brewery, and I expected nothing less. The complex flavors - while not as hoppy as I expected - were nonetheless satisfying and saturated the palate. Flavors were not TOO overwhelming, though. I'm looking forward to trying the 2nd bottle I bought in a year or two...depends on how long I can hold out...to see how the flavors develop and change with age!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Pours a clear dark orange with a foamy beige head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus zest, citrus fruit, and some mild nail polish remover aromas. Taste is much the same with a definite alcohol kick with each sip. There is a medium amount of hop bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty but I am not really enjoying the nail polish remover aroma from this one.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,tlazaroff,3.97,"Big nose on this one. Tangerine, mango, papaya, pineapple, lime rind, and caramel. All these flavors are easily picked out as none of them exhibits dominance over the others. Very well balanced on the nose.  Visible carbonation rising through the orange beer. It actually has a head which I am shocked to discover as it's only 18% alcohol, LOL. Lacing is minimal, but I expected none, so thats better than nothing.  Booze right up front, but it is controlled as this sweetness punches through. The tropical flavors outperform just about anything else in the taste here. It's as if I had just drank a tropical smoothie with caramel syrup laced within it.  120 Minute IPA is thick too, sticky sweet. The carbonation is at a moderate level, allowing the beer to self clean itself off your palate. It's a great beer for sure, but one that I don't see myself buying too often because of the $1/oz price tag.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Jugs_McGhee,3.41,"12 fl oz brown glass bottle with standard pressure cap acquired at Lukas Liquor in Colorado and served into a nonical generic pint glass in Castle Rock, Colorado. Reviewed live. Expectations are high given the hype, though I usually find Dogfish Head's beers are overrated.  Served straight from the refrigerator and allowed to warm over the course of consumption. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated.  A: Pours a two finger head of great cream, good thickness, and excellent retention considering the high ABV - it retains at least five minutes. Very impressive indeed. Bravo. Colour is a murky semitransparent copper-gold. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show.  Sm: Hoppy, but not as much as expected. Floral character is dominant, with some malty sweetness. The bitterness is buried in there somewhere. No alcohol or yeast comes through. Fairly simple. A mild but fairly subtle strength aroma.  T: Extremely hoppy, bringing out the bitterness towards the climax. Structurally quite brief - the flavours are there for a moment but then they vanish. Malty sweetness helps hide the hop content and surprisingly little alcohol comes through. No yeast here. Clean malts form the backbone. Raw malts and sugars bleed into the finish, a poor effect here. It's very full-bodied - actually a bit overbearing, which is surprisingly for how consolidated the flavour is. No real pine or citrus comes through, just floral quality. It's shockingly simple for how monstrously hoppy they'd have us believe it is. Very little subtlety or complexity at all. I like it for what it is, but aside from how hidden the ABV is, there's little of note. Strangely balanced.  Mf: Quite oily, especially towards the back end. Smooth and wet, with some needed coarseness up front. Too slick towards the back end, allowing the flavours to escape all too easily. It gives you little time to enjoy what's there. Too heavy and overbearing on the palate. Makes my stomach feel a bit bloated. Slightly overcarbonated. Too thick.  Dr: Nowhere near as overtly hoppy as they'd have us believe - which is probably a good thing. It feels more like a sugar bomb than it does a hop bomb. It's alright, but it's not at all worth the hefty price tag. This is Dogfish Head's best beer? I'm really disappointed, though I'm getting used to that feeling with this brewery. I will say that it's shockingly drinkable for its well-hidden high ABV. It tastes like it's about 7.5-8.0%. It doesn't live up to its hype, but it remains a decent IPA. I wouldn't buy this again.  B-  An okay candidate for aging, as far as IPAs go.  Drank fine out of a nonical pint glass. I don't think there's any glass that'll do much better.  Best paired with food. Perhaps an acidic salad. Fresh apples.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,bmoriarty,4.62,"Fresh, from a 12 oz. bottle into a half-pint tasting glass.  Pours a very clear golden, slightly amber color. Thin white head that disappeared quickly, except where it collected against the glass. No lacing.  Nose is STRONG, like a hops VS oaky/barrel deathmatch. Not as exclusively hoppy as I expected, but makes sense given that aging process. Definite undertone of alcohol.  Flavor is strong (surprised?) and almost exactly the same as the smell. The hops are powerful, but it also seems balanced well against the barrel flavor. Bite of alcohol in the finish.  Despite the powerful character of this beer, it is surprisingly easy to drink. Very clean mouthfeel. Would drink this all the time if I could.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,circus_cat,3.87,"A: An amber orange color with hardly any head and no lacing. The head that was there for a few seconds was soapy and off-white, taking some color hints from the orange body. It looks like a typical DIPA with the color and clearness.  S: MAJOR hops (surprised?) This beer smells really nice. Pine, grapefruit, floral, with caramel malt background. Yeah, major pineyness.  T: Hoppy up front with lots of citrus, followed by sweet malts. Ends very sweet. Boozy--kind of feels like I'm drinking barleywine or even whiskey.  M - Eep, a little syrup-tastic (leaves me wanting a glass of water). But it's a nice full-bodied beer.  Overall, I really liked this beer. It's exceptional and very unique. Like most of their stuff, it's bold as hell (I absolutely love the Dogfish philosophy). The price tag is a little rough at $9.00 for a 12 oz. bottle, but I know why that is--this thing has got to be very difficult to brew.

Definitely on the too sweet side for me, but not bad otherwise.  Full bodied, low carbonation, with a bitter aftertaste.

S - BIG hop aroma, piney, citrus, floral, fruity.  T - This beer smacked me in the face with huge hoppy flavor that overshadowed in the finish with a hot alcohol aftertaste. Almost tastes more like a barleywine than a DIPA.  M - A bit syrupy.  O - I'm glad a tried this, but it will only be once. I much prefer the 60 and 90 minute IPA from DFH.

10099,9086,mfc,4.36,"A: Clear burnt orange/auburn coloring. Almost no head on mine. What little there was dissipated pretty quickly but it was a creamy off-white head that took some color notes from the beer itself. So off-white with a hint of burnt orange.  S: AWESOME. Lemon, pine, zesty, malts as the sniff finishes.  T: More lemon and pine up front. I think I drank mine a little colder than they intend (right out of the fridge). I regret not letting it sit longer, but I did after the first sip and the taste notes changed pretty noticeably. When you let it warm, you get malt and more booze, in my opinion. Almost overshadows the hops (ALMOST). Like the 90 minute, the only noticeably objection I have is how syrupy it is, and I assume that comes from the attempt to balance the HUGE alcohol in this beer (which you can feel in the tongue and throat, btw--but what do you expect with a 18-20% ABV beer?) Overall really good.  M: Definitely glad I split this bottle with my girlfriend because it's too big of a beer for me to have had alone on a weeknight! Very good though.

The aroma is sweet, sugary and boozy. The hops pretty much either faded away at this point or are overshadowed by the sweet maltiness. Caramel, brown sugar and alcohol are the main flavors I get out of it.  The taste is also extremely sweet and boozy. There is some caramel maltiness to it, but it's more of a sugary, candy like flavor. The finish has a touch of residual hop bitterness, but not nearly enough. The alcohol also shows through too much, giving it a hot, boozy finish.  The mouthfeel is on the heavier side with carbonation being low for the style. Overall, I don't think it aged well at all and was approaching undrinkable. The lack of hoppiness just made it cloyingly sweet and boozy. It was kind of like a bad, really unbalanced, one dimensional barleywine. I've had it fresh and remember liking it better than this bottle.

10099,9086,vic21234,3.88,"2012 Vintage bottle poured into a snifter. I've had it on 2 prior occasions but this will be my first review of it.  A- Pours like a classic DIPA: nice amber orange color with a finger's worth of head that sticks around for awhile. Some lacing along the sides of the glass.  S- Some citrus and overall sweetness in the aroma, but otherwise underwhelming.  T- Up front 120 is very sweet and almost syrupy. The hoppy bitterness is there but not as much as you'd think for 120 IBUs. The alcohol dominates the backend of the taste.  M- Thick, syrupy, bitter but not bitter enough. Drinks pretty hot.  My review might not seem like it but I do enjoy 120 minute IPA, I'm just more aware of its flaws now. The last time I had this was sometime in 2009 when I was new to craft beers. My palate has changed alot since then. 120 is nice but I feel the alcohol overpowers everything else, making it a bit unbalanced.

Minimal to no lacing on the glass, possibly due to high alcohol.  s- The smell is strange, it basically smells just like a barley wine, and not at all like I was expecting. I'm smelling a slight pine scent, brandy/bourbon, barley wine, sugar, and alcohol.  t- It's not the most complex beer, but considering the high alcohol content it tastes very smooth. It tastes similarly to barley wine, with an almost white-grape flavor, caramel, and coriander up front, then a warming alcohol zing, especially as it warms, and then a bitter citrus flavor on the finish.  m- The mouthfeel doesn't really stand out as a factor in this beer for me either way. It isn't bad, but it's not exciting. I'm glad that it's not too thick though.  o- I give it a 4 overall because if it ages well I can see how it would be very good aged. I also think that considering how high powered this beer is, it's damn well balanced.

A- Pours a surprisingly very translucent light golden bronze (I was expecting a little bit more haze in this one), about a quarter finger of white head that quickly recedes. Slightly below average carbonation.  S- Dry hops, caramel malts, and some booze- not nearly as much as I was expecting from the 18% abv though. About average aroma strength.  T- Dry earthy hops, some light citrus + pine, sweet caramel malts, and a little bit of booze. Lightly sweet + a little bit hoppy aftertaste. Pretty well-balanced between the flavors, nothing is too over-powering.  M- A little bit syrupy but not bad for a 18%abv, definitely some alcohol burn, but very smooth for it's abv.  O- For a 18% IPA this was very good, however I think I prefer sticking to the 90 + 75 minute. For it's abv, the beer was surprisingly easy to drink however the aroma and taste weren't anything that I thought was spectacular. A nice rarity to drink every once in awhile, but definitely not something I would drink regularly, especially considering it's price.

Moderate carbonation is present with a heavy, syrupy body that coats the inside of the mouth. An extremely unique brew that is absolute alcohol bomb. Expect the heaviest malt backbone present in any IPA, which leads many to compare 120 Minute to barleywines rather than other IPA's. However the Dogfish Head IPA hop profile is plainly evident in this brew and this brew truly does remind me of an extreme version of 90 Minute IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

The beer poured clean with a small, cream colored head that quickly flatted out in a standard pint glass.. There is some slight haze to the beer, making it difficult to notice my fingers through the opposite side of the glass. Copper color.  Quieter hop aroma compared to other dry hopped double IPAs, with a slight malt character at the end of each sniff.  The taste just about knocked me off my feet. Very strong hop flavor, characteristic of the dogfish IPA increments. Very strong alcohol presence. However, it's hard to complain about the the alcohol taste, since they made it clear on the bottle that the beer is ""better when aged"". The hop profile is complex.  The alcohol flavors linger after consumption. Fuller body than most IPAs. The bitterness lingers as well.  Overall, it's hard to say how I feel about this beer at the present time. I am saving a bottle for aging, and will drink it in about a year or so.

10099,9086,threeviews,3.65,"After all this time, the mighty 120 Minute IPA...and what better day than my birthday to enjoy this enigmatic brew...let's get into a glass!  Poured from a 12oz bottle (Date on bottle: Bottled In 2012 B 11:01) into a 15.5oz Spiegelau balloon glass. Temperature of the beer was just slightly lower than cellar temp.  A- A lively pour elicits a (due to bottle conditioning) hazy, deep orange-gold-bronze color and with a 1-1/2 finger, eggshell white head. Although the head dissipated rather quickly, simply tilting the glass reveals some serious alcohol legs (not surprising and to be expected from a beer weighing in at ~18% ABV).  S- Initially I get that classic Dogfish Head IPA hop aroma: orange/tangerine and apricot. Once the head subsides, however, the aroma continues to develop. The matured nose comprises of the initial citrus & tropical fruit along with alcohol and additional notes of (red) apple, peach and pear...and yet with a twist...and that twist is as if those fruits have been slathered in honey.  T- The front of the palate is greeted with gobs of honey-like, sweet malt along figs and dates!? Mid palate is met with alcohol, vanilla and wood. Back of the palate is met with hop bitterness, but its initial impact is subdued with the sweetness from the malts. Once swallowed and after the warmth from the alcohol (which is very apparent) subsides, my palate is left stinging from the hops...nothing like I've ever experienced before.  ->(as the beer warms to room temperature, it gets Uber-boozy)  M- Despite other reviews, this is where 120 Minute fails to be ""highly drinkable"" as it is quite syrupy and heavy. Carbonation ranks in the the light-to-medium category which does the job nicely. Although enjoyable, this ranks in the ""one and done"" beers as consuming more than 12 ounces would be arduous.  O- Honestly, this reminds me more of Olde School Barleywine (which clocks in at 15% ABV and 85 IBUs) than anything else {I encourage you to read my review of it on this website}. The sweetness and mouthfeel are almost identical...and where 120 Minute IPA boasts a slightly more citrus-forward profile (aroma and flavor) it also comprises similiarities (apple and pear esters along with the syrupy mouthfeel) of Olde School. The biggest difference between the two styles is the appearance of the beer. In short, this beer is a bit overrated.  If considering price and availability, I would grab a 4-pack of Olde School Barelywine (or better yet, a 4-pack of Burton Baton if taking beer style into consideration) for ~$13 instead of a single, 12oz bottle of 120 Minute IPA for $9. If nothing else, it was a nice birthday treat!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

S- Smells of sweet malt and caramel, alcohol, woody notes, and hops (in that order). Very intense.  T- This beer is like a 5 course meal. There is a strong sweet/alcohol blast up front, then the hops hit your tongue and hang around a little, finishes very sweet. There is like a beer centrifuge in my mouth blasting everything all over.  M- I guess it's medium carbonation and body? But I'm not sure because the flavors are so powerful and overwhelming that I don't know what i'm sensing.  O- This is a very special beer and worth getting a 4 pack of to share with friends. It's obviously not something to drink frequently but great for special occasions. I can't give it super high ratings because the alcohol smell/flavor just is not possible to balance out with any amount of hops/malt and therefore I can't consider it as enjoyable as some of my favorite IPA/DIPA's.

This review is based on my experience with a recently bottled batch 0f 120 Minute and doesn't reflect how amazing it is aged or conditioned in a keg.  Overall: If I blindly sampled this beer without knowing what it was, guessing it was an IPA would be a long shot. It carries the characteristics of an aged beer casked conditioned in a secret chamber. A good beer, but hard to overcome its odd charisma.  Appearance: Deep orange-gold, reminiscent of a sunset. Light on the carbonation. No head, no lace.  Smell: Hops; pine; lemon Pledge; green onion.  Taste: Wood; oak barrel; whiskey--there is not a great spread of flavors raving the palate here.

Pours a very cloudy dark orange/amber color with only a ring of tan head from a rather aggressive pour. Tons of floaties swimming around in the glass, which I expected. No lacing.  The aroma has an abundance of sweet citrusy, almost barleywine-like woody, earthiness to it. Obviously with it's age, the hoppy/piney characteristics are abit secondary to the malty sweetness, but still present. Some alcohol bite to the nose as is warms.  Now for a sip... Wow! An intense malty sweetness, with some oaky/earthiness similar to the nose. The heat from the alcohol is intense.  There is a full, almost creaminess to the body in this one, with a low/medium amount of carbonation I would consider perfect for this style(although ""this"" style would be considered a Barleywine in my book). A slightly bitter, somewhat dry feel in the finish. This is an obvious sipper, as the heat from this beer WILL creep up on you!  Overall... I've had this beer several times both fresh from a bottle, and aged 2 years on draught and have always enjoyed it. I decided to review this over 3 year old version to compair them all and although my favorite was probably the 2 year old on draught... I will always search this beer out to age.

10099,9086,Taylor8189,4.88,"First off, this beer is quite possibly the best beer (not just IPA) in the world.  The appearance is typical for an IPA, dark orange, and a cm white head sitting on top.  I gave the smell a 4.5 only because it is very deceiving. The smell is typical for an IPA; citrus, hoppy, a little bit of alcohol, and some piney notes.  Now for the taste...this is where this beer shines. When you read 18% alcohol you're expecting a little bite from every sip..not a hint of alcohol on the initial taste of this beer. Tastes like a ridiculously good DIPA. As this beer got warmer, the flavors came out even more.  The carbonation is perfect, not too much, not too little. The drinkability of this beer is unreal. It's 18% alcohol but i found myself finishing the beer within ten minutes and this was my fourth beer of the night!  Overall, the beer is fantastic. The price is what it is for a reason; its amazing.

It recedes to a thick ring and a couple rocky islands of foam. The aroma is hoppy: grassy, citric, piney. Not actually as hoppy as I expected. There is also a light sweetness in the aroma. The first taste is floral bitterness, with a touch of malt. Next I get pine and syrupey flavors. As it leaves the palate, I get a touch of citrus and a lot of alcohol warmth. There is a flavor in this that I dislike, it's about 2/3 the way through, it seems medicinal but that may not be a perfect description. The mouthfeel is one of the thickest I've tred for an IPA, no suprise there, but the body is slightly lightened by a ticklish carbonation. This isn't exactly what I expected it to be, but that seems to be how DFH works, they make delicious things that make you scratch your head a bit.

10099,9086,DrDemento456,4.08,Got a 4.5 oz taster of this for 3 bucks at the Beermuda.  A - OK so I know this beer is supposed to be dark (or at least hazy compared to pictures online) But mine arrives clear bright amber brown with a 1/4 inch of sticky white head. Close to the Sculpin in color actually.  S - I agree with others it just doesn't seem to smell that hoppy. It is a double edged sword as I smell little to no alcohol as well.  T - I had to double check but since the owner knows his beer (and a caught a small buzz from the sample) this has to be 120. Taste is almost like hop juice but doesn't really hit any overbearing bittering aspect. The middle of the palate is like a barleywine where the malts hit you hard like a DIPA should and the finish is again bitter but in no way overbearing. I did sip this moderately slow so I could see over 4oz be overbearing (especially as it warms up the ABV shines through) but the 4oz I had was perfect.  M - Not as heavy as I anticipated but I could see this turn away the average beer lover. Such a big bold DIPA.  Overall considering this I would gladly pay the 8 bucks to try it in the bottle to see if it's close to this experience but its really nothing to seek out again strictly novelty.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

T: It's definitely a big boy, but this is smooth as hell. Big and malty upfront with a firm and piny hoppy backbone. Alcohol is definitely there, but it's remarkably well hidden.

Alcohol, no surprise, is noticeable but not off-putting. Vanilla, spice and whiskey notes as well. Full bodied, lightly effervescent. Some coating of the palate and tongue. Warming throughout. A serious beer meant to be lingered over, not slammed back. Enjoy slowly. Additionally, this is a fresh keg and as such, will be more aggressive in the hop notes and weaker in the malt.

Very sweet. Cinnamon and honey with low/no bitterness.  Mouthfeel is slightly thick, but less so than anticipated. No carbonation at all.  Hard to rate to style as this is a category-defying brew.

Appearance: A orange to amber color, slight bubbles through the body, head was thick on a vigorous pour rising to roughly 4/5"". Head settled to maybe a quarter after letting it sit for about a minute.  Smell: Caramel slight butterscotch smell, with hints of hops. It is very light compared to other DFH IPA's.  Taste: Jesus this beer is strong, I mean the alcohol overpowers the Tate of almost everything else. You feel the caramel, which is slightly sweet coming off like scotch. Vaguely bitter and extremely complex.  Mouth: Comes off a but thin, not flat but a lighter medium body. Overwhelming and sticking after taste that says in your mouth.  Overall: This is good beer but not for everyone, you want to talk about an acquired taste this is it. I love IPA's but this one is a little tough to put at the top of the food chain.

It’s been laid down in my beer cellar since last July.  Look: The dark golden honey colored brew formed a surprising 2-finger head of a French-vanilla ice cream constancy. It ad a semi-clear transparency with an even uprising of carbonation bubbles. Head regenerated easily when swirling the glass.  Smell: Super sweet syrupy notes of honey and herbal hops. Some model glue maybe? I also detected a hope profile similar to the 90 Minute IPA. There was some booze, but it wasn't as bad as expected.  Taste: First was a heavy sweetness with a slight hop bitterness setting in to offer some balance. The middle had the sweetness returning with an alcohol warmth that seemed to bring up the finish along with a roasted quality. The aftertaste was an interesting fruitiness of mango and pear.  Overall this is an impressive brew given the ABV of ~ 18%. I honestly was expecting more of a one-track booziness. Instead there was some actual balance. I suspect cellaring for almost a year definitely helped to mellow out the alcohol.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

10099,9086,Doobiendo,4.88,"I recently tried this beer during the DC craft beer week event that was held at the DFH Alehouse in Fairfax, VA. It was served endlessly to about 50+ people at the 7PM ""tapping"" of the keg. 18%abv.  A: The head left by the pour was a solid 1/2 inch of vanilla-mocha color that remained nice and firm for at least 2-3 minutes after the pour. The beer itself was a glorious dark auburn color that gave you a feel that all beers should look as such (OK, OK, maybe just strong IPAs).  S: Smell is the most subjective of all my senses, due to inherent sinus problems. However, the smell of this beer fit directly to that apparent disability. This beer has a smell that deserves a category all of its own. With an abundant smell of the hops (of which I include the aforementioned 'alcohol' smell that others describe) that remains fresh up to the taste, the smells that remain are of molasses and caramel (of which, take your pick).  T: If only I could hold a half-mouthful of this beer for every time I drank a beer. As I tasted, the flavors cascaded over each other with one of the best tasting ""hops"" taste followed by a sweet, yet not overwhelming molasses type of flavor. Hardly any bitterness whatsoever and fruitful flavors dominating over the former description. For a beer that has 18%abv, this is not only an achievement; it is a master of the art of beer craft.  M: Perfect, for my subjective taste. I could hold this within the mouth for about 5-6 seconds to obtain the flavors until I felt it was just ""meant"" to be swallowed. As with many of the DFH beers, this beer goes down lighter than expected and is pretty much on par (yet heavier than the 90 Min.) with any other high-gravity brew.  O: I'll admit that the beer cost $10.50 a pour (which were into 12 oz. snifters, that were given for keeps to the customers), but overall it was well worth the cost. I admit that I enjoyed this beer after a hard day's work at the office and arrived 5 minutes before the keg was ""tapped,"" so my taste could have hardly been experienced in a more favorable light. If on draft, I would strongly recommend this beer to anyone who loves the finer qualities of the beverage. I cannot speak for the bottled version, and I wouldn't be surprised if some of the finer qualities of this beer were lost in the bottling process (as great as it still may be).",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Full body, pretty smooth with low to moderate carbonation.  This was a decent beer, but I was a little disappointed.

10099,9086,RickS95,3.83,"Looks innocent enough. Dark apricot color, opaque. The head is a finger thick and a cross between off-white and straw yellow. It's a foamy head that leads to a creamy ring around the edges.  Surprisingly, there is a malt presence, but it's quickly vetoed by the piney, flowery, citric scents of the hops and the esters from the stupid high alcohol. Take too big a whiff and you'll regret it.  I was scared to take the first sip, but it's surprisingly beer-like. Has a Bigfoot/Barleywine flavor to it. Hops are obvious, but there's some vanilla in it as well. Oh yeah, umm, there's some alcohol as well.  I feared the worst, but was pleasantly surprised. It's 100% XIPA, but not like I'd heard. Calling it gentle is just not appropriate, but it's not as brutal as expected. There's some citrus and bitterness, but all is pushed back by the overwhelming heat from the alcohol. Even slow sips and your mouth and throat heat up.  It's a reasonably drinkable beer, given the IBU and ABV. It's a sipper for a cold day. But it's something you've got to try.

10099,9086,Ungovernable,4.72,"A: I want to say it has a honey, golden hue, but I'm vegan, and that has negative connotations. So, I'll say it's a nice, sunny, light amber color. The head was pretty non-existent, as expected, but some foam remained on top of the pour pretty much throughout.  S: Hops are pervasive in the smell, but in a different way than for a lot of really hoppy beers. For instance, that weed smell is completely absent from this. There is a heavier note around the sides of the smell that's kind of liqueur-y -- in a good way.  T: This tastes a lot of what you'd expect a really strong imperial IPA to taste like. Somebody said it had characters of a barleywine, and I'd agree. It has that malty sweetness to it, but the centerpiece is obviously the hops. I've long wondered if it's possible to put too many hops into a beer. Well, my first sip of this got me thinking that maybe it was -- and maybe this was kind of bad-tasting because the brewers favored a ridiculous amount of hops over taste. However, the more I drink this, the more it settles into a tasty imperial IPA that gets less challenging to drink as it goes down. It's worth noting that this is not citrus-y at all. If that's what you're looking for, look elsewhere.  M: It feels syrupy and stays in my mouth. It coats the roof of my mouth and kind of stays there. Still, it's not overpowering or unpleasant.  O: I gave this a 5.0 because Dogfish Head obviously made a very quality beer that checks off a number of rare boxes. It's 18 percent alcohol, hoppy to a point of extremes and still tastes really good. If I was looking for a really great IPA, this wouldn't be what I'd grab. But I don't think that's what Dogfish Head was going for when they made this. This is a good, interesting beer that crosses beer styles to sit with overall quality beers, instead of reigning in a certain niche. Sure, it's challenging to drink, but I like that a lot. I want something to stick out in beers I drink. This is certainly no session beer. This is one that you're going to fight with a little at first. However, it'll soon have you singing its praises and wanting more -- if you like challenging beers.

Sipping creates a few scattered small pieces of foam.  The aromas are rich and full of grapefruit, the malt backbone and even a bit of alcohol.

The mouthfeel is rich and full bodied with a creamy feel from the light but persistent carbonaltion.  On the whole I like this beer, in part because the hop flavors show without a lot of bitterness to hide them.

Leaves a small amount of spotty lacing on the glass.    S: Initially I get some citrus notes, then lots of burnt sugar and booze.  I get maybe a touch of dark fruits and a subtle roast character, but mostly sugary malt sweetness.  Very unique, but I actually like it, a lot.    T: The first sip has noticeable dark fruits notes.  Again the burnt sugar character is present, with some piney hop bitterness on the backend.  There is no where near the hop characters I anticipated, and my palate is not picking up anything close to the supposed 120 IBUs.  Some booze is noted but not to a negative degree.  Actually is really has the profile of a good, non barrel aged barleywine.  There are not a lot of intricacies, but the flavor profile is nice.    M/D: Really smooth. Full bodied with a sticky mouthfeel.  Carbonation is present but mild.  A little syrupy but not negatively so. It has a whole body warming effect, no doubt the result of the insane ABV, which is masked impressively well.  Particularly in the first 1/2 of the drink, when it is somehow almost unnoticeable.  It hits you harder as it warms, but even then it's fairly well restrained.  I've had 8-9% RIS's that come off as far boozier than this.  The drinkability is absurd for an 18% ABV beer.  Awesome..    O: What an impressive specimen!  I applaud DFH for what it has accomplished here.  Getting a beer to 18% ABV while maintaining a very good aroma, flavor profile, and insane drinkability is an amazing task.  Does it fit the style?  No, but styles be damned.  This is a brewing work of art.  ",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

The 2 are very similar except 120 is carbonated. A very heavy beer. This beer is one of my favs to start the night out with!

10099,9086,NoLeafClover44,3.73,"12 oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass. Bottled in 2012.  A - Poures an apple juice amber color with a bubbly head that dies almost immediately. Leaves a halo of white carbonation around the edge. Some cloudy wisps of sediment settle towards the bottom.  S - Very dank hops, molasses, a touch of rubbing alcohol, and some fruitiness (apple, date).  T - Menacingly sweet up front. Tastes a bit like maple syrup or sweet tea. I get some hops on the back end, but they don't stand up against the massive malty sweetness. Among the other flavors I can pick out are golden raisins, burnt sugar, caramel, and mandarin orange. Despite the obnoxiously high ABV, I don't get much alcohol in the flavor, just a little bit of heat in the back of the throat.  M - Sticky with a very mild carbonation. Pretty thick, but enjoyable and smooth, like a fine liquor.  O - I find it hard to give this beer a rating because it is so very different from any other IPA out there. I shy away from really sweet beers (English BW, Quads, etc.) but I thought this wasn't too bad. I had it fresh in hopes that some of the hops would cut the sweetness, but I think the freshness mostly just kept the alcohol heat. I have a few in the cellar from the last couple of years, so I look forward to trying it aged for a few years to compare. It's definitely a sipper, but pretty good and unique.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,mdurkee11,4.27,"I love Dogfish Head and enjoyed the 120 minute overall. It's really too big to evaluate by comparing to other beers and is more of a hybrid beer/champagne/sipping spirit. Great smell of big ABV when poured along with notes of citrus remaining you it's an IPA. Lighter amber appearance is accompanied by noticeable carbonation, which is also evident when you first sip. Surprisingly smooth taste for such a big IPA and enjoyable finish. By no means a session beer, but a wonderful experience drinking this beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,ckollias,3.72,Enjoyed this 12 bottle out of a large snifter glass. Bottle indicates it was bottled in 2011.  A: Pours a very hazy orange-copper hue with a 1-finger white head that quickly dissipates into a wispy lace leaving a partial trail down the glass.  S: Strong sweet aroma with big whiffs of alcohol. This smells almost like a potent barley-wine.  T: Extremely sweet and alcoholic flavor. I can see how they tried to curb the sweetness form the malts with a ton of hops – but they barely come through in the flavor. Finishes sweet and boozy.  M: Heavy body and minimal carbonation.  O: This is an extreme beer and is not for everyone – but I enjoyed it thoroughly. It is definitely a sipping beer and best shared with a friend or 2.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Rutager,3.45,"Thanks yeahnatenelson. I've been wanting to try this one for a while now.  Appearance. Pours a hazy gold amber with almost no head.  Smell. Fruity hops and sweet malt, some booze, oranges and grapefruits.  Taste. Whoa. Big sweet malts and huge amounts of hops. Quite fruity and pretty boozy, but not nearly as bad as I expected given the crazy abv. The hops come in waves and just beat the tastebuds senseless.  Mouthfeel. Full bodied with a slight sticky feel, low carbonation.  Overall. Holy fuck, this thing is kicking my ass!!! I wanted to review another beer after this but there's just no way. I'll probably just go to bed early and hope I can taste again in the morning. Very unique though, and very glad to have experienced it.

10099,9086,MichPaul,4.3,"I had bought this a few months ago and have let it sit for a while mostly because of the ABV, it has to be drank at the right time. So now mid April, I am trying one that is dated 2011.  I really like this beer! The price it too high, but being a 2IIPA, the taste is stellar for the style. Really reminds me of what I remember a Double Crooked Tree IPA was like from Dark Horse.  This pours a hazy Auburn color. Has a nice citrus like aroma to it. As for the taste, it's not as hot as so many say. At least not to me. It's got quite an onion like taste to it, similar to what I noticed in the Double Crooked Tree mentioned above. Very malty, just like most DFH brew, they didn't deviate here.  Overall, I enjoy this beer, and it's great for the style, but there are too many alternatives that cost SO much less.

10099,9086,bdcravens,3.93,"Overpaid for this, but it's hard to come by in Texas ($21 for a single bottle!) Resisted urge to drink; finally gave in and treated myself on my birthday.  A: Looks thick. Gentle pour into tulip barely clouded at first; leaves a minimal head and virtually no lacing. Red-orange in color. I can't see through to the other side of the glass.  S: ABV comes through first of all. A bit fearful; anything with a ""liquor"" smell really turns me off. However, that smell dissipates within a few minutes, and then I'm getting some apricots and grapefruit.  T: While I can get the ABV in the taste, it's not overpowering. Fruity flavors are coming through. A gentle sweetness. Very little hoppy bitterness. No lasting aftertaste. (The 18% ABV makes me weary of taking too big of swallow, however.)  M: Wine-like thickness. Crisp carbonation. Mouth not burned by ABV, but can feel the warmth as it gets to my throat.  O: Given its cost, I probably wouldn't buy this often. The ABV is scary, especially when you consider how smooth of a drink it is. I'd say the ABV hits you more readily in the DFH Santo Palo Marron, which is only 2/3 of this brew's ABV.

The nose is very muted, no hop character whatsoever, malty with clear caramel malt character. Bready. Hint of abv. The taste is a disappointment. Immediately upon the palete is a strong alcohol heat, no hiding it. Strong and aggressive. Mildly bitter with a lot of bready malt, again little hops. Way to strong and sweet, unbalanced.

The smell is caramel sweet backed up a super strong fusel alcohol presence. Dry grains as well. Initially, I got kicked in the face by pine hops straight away, but now its all sweet. Very dominated by the booze.  OMG this thing is so sweet. Caramel corn dominates, with huge notes of toffee and caramel. No real hop presence at all, I think the bitterness really comes from the burnt sugars. Im definitely throwing the cap back on this thing and finishing it tomorrow.  Tastes and feels like syrup.

Fascinated, I swirled around in my glass then took a sip being overwhelmed by my taste buds. This brought about a surprising, yet heated, sensation not expected from the average beer.

Probably wont buy it again unless I can find it on tap just to try it that way. Not a bad brew, just not worth a dollar an ounce when the DFH 90 is so good.  A- Orange/copper look with a nice head. Poured up just like a 90-minute but with a more yellow tint to the foam.  S- Strong hop scent with a lot of malt in there for some reason. Didnt expect all the malt.  T- Very malty backbone not typical of an imperial IPA, yet the hops burst on the scene just it time to remind you they are there. Could be hoppier and I would be happier. The finish is very long and gets more boozy at the end. Definite taste of caramel and citrus.  M- Super smooth with very little carb bite. A lot like the Burton Baton from DFH.  O- Fun thing to try once, but not something I will drive 50 miles to seek out again.

After a few more sips I get that same over ripe fruit(Peaches) flavor coming out with a strong IPA taste.  M- I would say a strong medium carbonation, body feel.

I've even cracked jokes about this bottle being in my fridge for an eternity or two. I guess it's probably time to try this now that my expectations are properly lowered. Bottled on 2/9/09.  It pours out a nice, red-orange color with an expectantly small head that quickly drops to wisps. The aroma is very sweet and boozy, smelling more like a brandy then a beer. The taste, again, is closer to booze than beer. There's a little bit of hops, but it's really tastes a lot like brandy. I poured out some Remy VSOP to confirm my suspicions. Any way, it is still pretty good tasting, with just a bit of prickly hops on the backend, and plenty of sweetness and fruit on the front. The mouthfeel is thick with a decent level of carbonation.

You can smell a boozy presence with orange and grapefruit peeking through a sweet honey and toffee smell.  They definitely balanced this hop monster with malts. Candied oranges and sugar sprinkled grapefruit. Bitterness takes a background to sweet, malty toffee and honey with sweet wine notes. Some pine and orange marmalade. Much sweeter than I expected.

You can definitely read through it-  Smell I'd imagine would be a little more intense considering how long its hopped for. It smells like liquified candied hops & booze. Strong presents of alcohol in the nose.  A bitter-sweet sipper. The initial taste is of bitter-sweet hops that change to intense yet delicate super sweet malt nectar. Sweet/candied hops are the first thing you taste with an ocean of tongue sizzling sweet malts & hops mid palate and a sweet hop resin finish- For me its almost painfully sweet. You can taste and feel the alcohol quick. I pulled up a few YouTube videos of guys chugging these and that can't end well- chugging one of these would fuck you up! I'm a total hop head but this is a little too much to the sweet side of things, understandably.  Overall I say a must try for anyone who enjoys ""extreme"" beers.

Has no bottled date on the bottle but is from 2011.  Aroma- Huge hops, pinches the nose with a ton of power, and then fruit comes around. Mango, malty, and well balanced. Very nice!  Appearance- Pours a 1 finger head that has average retention. Pours a dark hazy, copper colored body and leaves good lacing behind.  Flavor- Initially super strong and complexed fruits beyond description! American/fruity hops are the main attraction. Surprisingly, it finished off with a light-medium bitterness level.  Mouthfeel- Medium-Full Bodied, Medium Carbonation, Smoothest!, lemon, orange, and other fruits are left on palate. Sweet and complexed!

T - booze has definitely mellowed after a year. Very sweet and syrupy. Taste generally follows the nose with notes of dark fruits and cognac. Robust and earthy. Caramel and brown sugar. Slightly burnt, but that might just be the dry finish. Faint hoppy pine toward the end. Yes there are hops in here!  F - definitely very full and more carbed than I was expecting.

10099,9086,brotherloco,4.42,"12oz bottle. Bottled in 2012. Served in a snifter.  Given that this was bottled in just the past couple of months, this is a review of a pretty fresh batch.  Pours a slightly hazy golden orange with a thin off-white head that quickly dissipates to a ring of large bubbles. No lacing.  Aroma is deeply fruity, floral, vinous, and a little sweaty. Tropical citrus, mango, kiwi, pineapple, and orange. Fruit has a fermented quality to it. Floral notes are slightly perfumy with strong honeysuckle notes. Vinous notes sit kind of between a sweet white and dry red. A sting of alcohol. Needless to say, complex and intriguing.  Taste hits you with a little more sweetness than I got in the nose, but not a surprising amount. Flavors come on like waves. There's the sweet honey, there's the fermented fruit juice (a tilt towards apple cider), there's the wine (a sweet dessert white), there's a big wash of seawater saltiness. A bit of sweetness from the high alcohol seems present, but very well blended. Certainly there's an overall bitterness from so much hopping, but the flavor is much more than just bitter. Much like the aroma, things here are complex and intriguing.  Medium-full bodied with light carbonation. A touch syrupy, but how could a beer this big not be. Encourages sipping.  Took me a few years to track this one down, but I'm not disappointed in the slightest.

S: Smell is sugary, sweet, quite complex, but not hoppy at all, reminding more of a barleywine than an IIPA.  T: Taste is caramel, toffee, very sweet. Also fruity (candied fruits). The aftertaste is more bitter. The dry finish helps the sweet notes not to be to overwhelming.  M: Nice carbonation, not oily or sticky but strong bodied for an IPA.  O: This brew's a sipper.

My 4/8/2022 revisit: I haven't had this beer since I first tried it back on March 29th of 2012 (!!!)... I gave it a ""4"" at a time I was really into high-abv DIPAs and barleywines and the like...  16.6% abv, bottle has what looks to be ""Aug 2022"" printed on it...  Very impressed... I vaguely remember (back then) thinking it was too thick or sweet or heavy or something - like, a bit over-the-top; but that is not my impression now at all - and I'm not into the hop-forwards and high-gravs and DIPAs like I used to be - really diggin' this...  The heat and the hops and the feel air out the rich malt sugars, and this drinks like a ""normal"" DIPA, not a heavy-handed sipper - I'm appreciating how (relatively-speaking) lean it presents - certainly loaded with dank, chewy and sweet resins and piney and citrusy hops, but it isn't too sweet or too heavy...  It's a little sticky, comfortably sweet, subtly bitter, and very drinkable...

10099,9086,andrewm190,4.22,"As one of the reviewers below said, Dogfish head's 60 minute was one of the beers that turned me toward craft brews, and later, forever forsaking the NASCAR fair. Somehow, I'd missed the 120 minute until now. Among my beer loving friends, it has not been loved. Liked, perhaps, but nothing of the fan-fair I'd expect from a beer with even more (!) hops. I have come to find that it is in fact possible to over hop a beer. The 120 Minute was accused of this, and I echo the sentiment. That is not to say, by any means, that I don't enjoy the beer. I really like it and certainly recommend it. I'd even say it's come to enjoy a certain celebrity status, and perhaps should be tried at least once for that reason. But, lacking much else in complexity, this is a pure hopper, and it is strong. I've given this a slightly higher overall mark than I did for it's other sub-catagories, and I'd have to admit I'm not sure why. I can tell you two things though. The first is that this isn't complex; the smell is hoppy, so is the appearance and the taste, not much more needs to be said. The second is that I haven't had a good beer in a while, so having some type of quality round out my evening is a major plus, even if the hops are a bit smothering.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,ludachris,3.88,"Their 60 minute is what turned me onto craft beer and ever since I've wanted to get my hands on their 120. And now that I finally did, I can't wait to review it.  Just under a finger's worth of of ivory white head rest on top of its hazy rich copper body. I'm actually suprised any head was yielded at all. Alcohol legs coat all sides of the glass. Judging from the viscosity of the beer coming out of the bottle alone, you can tell this is going to be a big DIPA.  Coming into this, I had the preconception that juicy, fresh, and resinous hops would pour out of the glass truck loads at a time. Instead, I'm greeted with a beer that has an equal balance between rich, bready, caramel drizzled malts with an underlay of chocolatey mocha and hops that ooze out syrupy grapefruit, sappy pine, lemon peel, and alcohol soaked peaches. An aged American barleywine seems like a more suitable descriptor for the style than a DIPA but that's besides the point. As the beer warms, both the alcohol and mocha/coffee characters increase in intensity.  Slick, syrupy grapefruit and mocha sprinkled with cocoa paste themselves on every corner of the palate. Sweet alcohol follows close behind while lemon candy cuts through the middle. The finish brings out the beer's richness, packed with sweet alcohol, thick sweet bread and lemon drops.  For 18%, the feel isn't as heavy as I'd expect. It's full bodied nonetheless with a slick, syrupy feel. The alcohol is present but integrates well with the rest of the beer.  It's not what I expected but it's still tasty, well crafted beer. It's rich, it's sweet, it's syrupy and it sure is a sipper. I'll take a fresh 60 minute over this but I'm glad I tried it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Great lacing, retention. Hazy look, like peach juice straight from the tree. Reminds of Hill Farmstead beers, that fresh tasty look.  Smell: Disappointing here, with an opaque nose. Funkiness, dirty cow pen. Barnyard aromas. Reminds me of my native Galicia. Dank hops and citrus. Acidic, bitter. Expired OJ with a shot of vodka.  Taste: Yeah! Again the spiked OJ, funky hops. Key lime pie. Fruitcake and rum-soaked shortbread. Sweet! Boozy! Delicious.  Mouthfeel: Low carbonation, boozy, full flavor and body.

10099,9086,dcloeren,4.35,"Poured a beautiful golden orange with just a touch of bright white head trying to form but the weight of this beer definitely won the battle.  Great citrus and tropical fruit hop notes explode out of my glass. Grapefruit and orange peal along with sweet mango. Caramel malt sweetness backing it all up. There is definitely some heat on the nose. Reminds me of when I used to wear Sex Panther.... it stings the nostrils.  Whoa! Tons going on here. While the hops are definitely present, sweet caramel maltiness takes the lead on the tongue. Very malty with some serious heat. I personally love the heat on this though. It's definitely not for the faint at heart. The citrus and tropical notes have been rounded off and lost their bitterness. Great tasting beer for sure.  Full bodied and a tad bit on the syrupy side but with plenty of carbonation to make up for it. This beer coats every bit of your mouth, gives it a nice prickling feeling and then leaves it with a slow burn from the booze. I'm definitely loving it.  Overall, I thought this was a great brew. Dogfish Head knew what they were doing with this one. Sam knocked it out of the park. While this beer clocks in at a whopping 120 ibu's... I do wish that it was more of a hop bomb. It is on the sweeter side for sure. If I could critique it at all, it would be to let the hops shine through a little bit more.

Aromas are citric and floral hop, grapefruit, orange, pineapple, mango, with caramel and grainy malts. Tastes are complex with notes of sweet fresh pineapple, citrus, mango, grapefruit, caramel, and honey. It's sweet with a large amount of booze that is noticeable. I was surprised at the lack of bitterness on the finish - the sweetness rides right on through the finish. It goes down too easy for the enormous ABV, while being creamy, smooth, and full bodied. Towards the end as the ale warms, the alcohol gets hot. Overall, this was a treat I've wanted to try for some time, but never was at the right place at the right time.

10099,9086,cuttsjp,4.03,"Appearance: (split three ways, poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a snifter) golden/copper color, slight haze from both the hoppiness and the fact that the beer is bottle conditioned (active yeast in the bottle), brilliant white head that dissipates into a ring of foam with nice lacing that remains throughout  Aroma: sweet citrus, particularly tangerine, with a distinct aroma of golden raisins/currants and a light twinge of brown sugar/rum/boozy nose  Flavor: tangerine, bitter caramel/burnt sugar, golden raisins, a slight amount of spice/cinnamon, then warming alcohol on the finish  Mouthfeel: silky, medium-low carbonation, definitely not overly syrupy, especially for a beer pushing 20% ABV  Overall: definitely a fantastic beer, certainly more of a barleywine than Imperial IPA, but very unique in its flavors and certainly an experience worth having. It would be very interesting to collect/age these for a few years and do a vertical tasting. DFH recommends trying it with some age on it, so whenever they have another release, I'll try to make that happen.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Very aromatic hops smell more sweet than anything.  T: Sweet tropical/citrus hops, pineapple, tangerine, nectarine, grapefruit. Hops come through sweet but still pick at your palate with moderate bitterness. Honey and caramel stay strong in the background to back the hops up. Alcohol definitely shows but it's quite subdued for it's abv. I've had much hotter beers with significantly lower abv.  M: Full bodied, smooth, slightly sticky finish. carbonation is soft-moderate.  O: I really enjoy this beer. It's more of an english-american fusion barleywine rather than an IPA.

This beer is hard to find so I definitively had to buy a bottle.  The beer pours a light brown color with a thick initial head to it that settles down rather quickly.  The smell is very odd. Very sweet with a definite hop presence, the hops are not overpowering at all though.  Initial taste blows me away. This is a very unique beer. It's surprisingly sweet for how many hops are in it. In fact I barely notice that hops at all. All I get is a refined sweet taste. The after taste is a very pleasant caramel flavor. I could not taste the alcohol at all in this beer.  Overall the beer is definitely worth a try. I can see why some people would not like it because of the sweetness but i liken it to a fine brandy.  I feel as this would age extremely well.  Follow up  Aged 1 bottle for about a year. It improves incredibly well with age. The sweetness calms down a bit, but is definitely still present. I recommend aging this beer to get the best results.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Compared to the 2015, this was much more mellowed out and less medicinal on the finish. Almost an apricot liqueur flavor. Low carbonation, significantly lower than the 2015.  Overall this was solid if not spectacular. I think if I drank this blind I wouldn't have thought it were anything special.

There was a finger of head, which settled quickly to a thin dusting. There was a bit of sediment, not much lacing.  S) Tropical fruit, Mango, pineapple, some orange. This is a bit floral, but really quite sweet. There's a little booze.  T) The initial impression is the sweetness. I got very ripe pineapple and honey. The ABV is initially very well masked. Then is creeps up on you with some warmth in your throat, that follows all the way to your gut. I really can't complain about the balance, it works.  M) Medium body, maybe a little heavier. There was more carbonation than most beers with a ABV this high, but it works. This is actually pretty darn smooth.

S - Its like a fresh honeycrisp apple. Then fills out with loads of grapefruit flesh and some booze.  T - A little more honeycrisp apple, but not there's a lot more over-ripe grapefruit in the flavor. Finishes with thick, sweet, bready malts, big bitterness, and a strong alcohol bite.  M - Full, thick, chewy body, but the ridiculous abv makes it finish dry and hot. Bitterness still lingers.  O - Didn't really want to drink this one when I did, but I was left no chance when my dad cracked this one from my fridge unknowingly. Nice choice, dad. Its an experience, and I was glad I split the bottle, because I'm not sure I'd be able to finish it myself. A bit too boozy for me, but is interestingly balanced.

10099,9086,StoutKing,4.75,"Not the traditional IPA by any means. It poured a deep amber, and gave off a smell of solid alcohol, a step away from the usual flowery wave that comes with IPA's. Inhalation though was the real factor which gives this beer all of the esteem that Dogfish places behind it. First taste, is that of a very light IPA, after which it puts your taste buds into a race, firing flavor after flavor at you. The flavor reaches a peak about 10 seconds after you swallow, when it enters the final wave of a citrus. Don't look to this for a session, because the near 18% when mixed with the overall show-stopper stature of this brew puts all subsequent beers in a lower light. If you consider yourself an IPA person, than this should become your pride and joy, after you experience the complexity of the flavor which honestly is in a league of its' own.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Really complex flavor profile, as you'd expect. Really hoppy, really malty and really boozy all at the same time. Citrus dominates the hop profile with sweet and tangy grapefruit and orange hops, but a bit of pine as well. No bitterness. Really sweet sticky malt. Caramel and even a bit of toffee, but it fades and the hops take over more the further into the beer you get. Then there is an overlying presence of alcohol throughout the entire flavor profile.

I pull a lot of fruit flavors from this beer, both on the citrus hop side and the dark fruit malt side. Great complexion.  M: Very warming, full bodied. Good carbonation. Absolutely a sipping beer.

I was at a bottle share/tasting, was a little tipsy so couldn't do a proper review, but thought it was a bit of a chore to drink. And I know this thing changes year to year, but it really is more of a novelty than something that should be consumed regularly. Yeah, I know, to get an non-barrel aged brew with this high of gravity is a feat in itself, and it's 'palatable', but do I want more? No. Cloying sweet at the finish, sticky as hell.  I was hoping to change my rating a bit, but no.

Crisp. Surprisingly light-medium bodied.  O: Not what I was expecting at all. Balanced yet hoppy. Alcoholic yet smooth.

10099,9086,GarthDanielson,4.34,"Served on-tap and poured in a snifter, the beer is a bright, vibrant, hazy orange marmalade color with a frothy, dense, inch high head that is light tan in color and has very decent retention and cling. Aromas are a hophead's dream, with a blast of pine tassels and resiny, sticky, green fresh hops, balanced with a slight grapefruit citrus characteristic and subtle malt presence. Flavors are huge, and they explode the palate. Robust caramel malt backbone that is quickly surrounded by a roasted character that gives rise to the floral and resiny hops that abound. Wet, green, and heavy are the best descriptors I can give for the hops presence, with a slick, oily feel on the palate. The citrus from the aromas becomes much more subtle on the palate, being slightly absorbed into the malt presence and being somewhat overowered by the solid booze presence. Wow, this is a heavy hitter. The aftertaste is a rich tang of malt, with some peppery hops character making itself known. The finish is slick and rich, giving a slow recession off the palate. It really allows you to take it all in before the tongue recovers for another sip. This is a tasy brew!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Darkmagus82,4.08,"Served in a 10 oz chalice  Appearance –Served a hazy orange color with an off white head. The head was very persistent and faded very slowly. From the look of the brew you could tell it was thick. After time the head faded leaving a nice foam on the top of the beer with some very nice lacing. When swirled it clung to the sides of the glass with it taking its time to settle back to the body of the glass.  Smell – A nice citrus hop aroma was the most present. A strong malt backbone is also there holding up the citrus hops. A bit of floral and earthy hop flavor comes more toward the end mixing with a somewhat astringent alcohol aroma, these aromas, however, are light in comparison the heavy citrus and malt aromas.  Taste – A citrus hop flavor hits the tongue initially. Its lighter then I anticipated. The maltiness however is quite a bit heavier, possibly masking the anticipated hop flavor. A wheat malty body was the most pronounced with some sweet caramel and citrus fruits of orange and a little bit of grapefruit, likely more hop related then sweetness, but it all came together as one. As detected in the nose, there were some more floral and pine hop flavors toward the end which mixed in a bit of alcohol. The alcohol was very well done; it was light and warming without being burning. The taste was incredibly nice, but more hoppiness would have been even better.  Mouthfeel- The malt backbone creates a wonderfully creamy and chewy body. This body coats the mouth with a smoothness that calms the mouth and spirit. The light carbonation only enhanced this nice smooth and calming feeling. With a warming of the alcohol toward the end, it makes for one overall wonderful mouth sensation.  Overall – This was a very nice beer, although I was a little disappointed in the hop level; it was less hoppy then I would have liked. It may have been the heavy malt backbone that hid some of the hop flavor, but to me this was no more hoppy then their 90 min IPA. Taking price into consideration I would take 90 min IPA over this any day. The 120 was well worth a try and one to have very sparingly on special occasions.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Pouring a hazy orange with some peach highlights, a 1/2 inch of ivory colored head leaves lots of lace. Piney and citrusy resin aromas burst from the tulip-shaped glass, with very noticeable hints of alcohol (nail polish) and a little earthiness. Super sweet brew, hints of honey, cherry, pinecone, citrus and alcohol. A chewy, big body with low amounts of carbonation becomes more complex and rewarding as it warms.

Very small amount of head that only lingered at the edge of the glass. Small amount of carbonation can be seen through the cloudiness.  Smell: Slightly hoppy, but not what I expected it to smell like. Definitely an alcohol smell to it as well. The most dominant smell is a sweet, bread-like scent.  Taste: Actually tastes somewhat sweet, similar to the smell. Alcohol is definitely there, but not totally overbearing. Slight hop flavor is able to break through the sweet maltiness, but not nearly what I expected from this beer. It's really more of a liqueur type beverage.  Mouthfeel: A bit of a thicker, syrupy feel.  Overall: If you're a huge fan of an IPA and are hoping for a significant hop flavor, you're in for a let down.

I really did not enjoy it, but forced it down over a couple or three hours due to the effort and cost it took to acquire it. I’m pretty sure it was 21%abv at that time. I had a much more pleasant experience with it this time.  Really good looking amber golden/amber colored brew with fluffy white head, decent retention, activity and lacing.  Yes, it’s strongly boozy. No question. But, the strong floral and fruity hops push through, as does some malty sweetness. Is it unbalanced toward the booze? Sure. But what do you expect for an 18% beer.  Like the nose, the booze is unmistakable and somewhat out of balance. But it doesn’t completely dominate, and modest hoppy bitterness, the juicy fruity and floral hop flavors mingle with the rich malty sweetness to partially balance the booze, and achieve a very tasty flavor profile.  Good carbonation, rich full body, thick viscosity, strong warming, with some gentle bitterness in the finish.  I really enjoyed this one this time. It was nothing like the cloying, syrupy sweet hop juice I remembered from my first experience. I will want to get some more. Not sure about aging this though, though the label suggests doing so?

D: Goes down hot and biting, but it isn't as rough as I had thought it would be. Mouthfeel is way to thick for a DIPA.  Overall: Its tough to rate this one. It really isn't as harsh as it could be, and I'm guessing the softness of the tap may have something to do with that. However, I've tasted beers into the 15% range that were incredibly balanced.

Strong, fruity alcohol with caramel, grapefruit, some grains and juniper. This one develops more of a floral aroma with rum as it warms. (Edit: 21+ month aged bottle mellows and clarifies the aroma. On draught the aroma sings, with richness. Young bottle 3.75 - Aged bottle 4 - Draught 4.25)  Sweet white wine immediately comes to mind upon entry while hope flavors and bitterness are rather subdued for the style. Apple juice, grapefruit, and ginger develop with over-ripe orange. The finish is filled with citrus fruit. (Edit: 21+ month bottle diminished the bitterness. Draught version lost the wine, and amplified the fruit, added honey and mellow lushness. Young & aged bottles 4 - Draught 4.75)  A full body with satin texture and soft carbonation. Alcohol is quite prominent, actually hot, but seems to have mellowed none-the-less with age. (Edit: Age cuts the assertive alcohol, but the Draft version eliminated all harshness while retaining the presence and reducing the carbonation and adding a soft syrupy texture. Young bottle 3.5 - Aged bottle 4 - Draught 4.25)  This is a tasty beer, well worth the experience, but is clearly a special occasion sipper. I can’t imagine having two in any given month. (Edit - Draught 4)  This bottle aged 21 months before serving and is far and away superior to the one I had fresh. The alcohol in the fresh bottle totally overwhelmed the experience. This one, however, did seem to assume qualities of a strong barleywine. I have left two other bottles to age for comparison. (Edit: The draught version was at Village Tavern in Geneseo, and while expensive, it was well worth the price. The draught was remarkably different and superior)",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,JohnnyHopps,4.25,"Based on the reviews posted by others, I was somewhat expecting to not like this beer. Thankfully, I was wrong. By chance, I found this in a ""dive"" liquor store, so I can not confirm how old it is. On the bottle, it does state that it ages well.  Shared with two others, the samples were poured into a snifter. Pouring a beautiful copper color, the ale gave a strong, pleasant, citrusy aroma. The initial taste is citrus, almost like a thick citrus fruit drink. To an extent, citric acid almost seems present. The hops do not become apparent until the back of the mouth. It makes for complex drink. Somewhat thick in its texture, the ale possesses a sweet strong alcohol flavor that permeates a pleasant experience. The flavor will please more than hop heads.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

First 120 min, been loyal Dogfish follower with 60, 90, and Burton Baton  Beautiful copper color with minimal lacing  Smell is A LOT of alcohol, but a sugary caramel scent with it.  Mouthfeel is electric, lots going on there.  Sweet, puckery aftertaste. Just the way I like it.  A beer geek I met compared this to turpentine. I just don't see that. It's high octane, and the alcohol scent is a bit heavy, but overall and excellent beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Hoppedup616,4.5,"7/22/11 bottle Poured into a Great Lakes snifter. Appearance is beautiful, little to no head, but an awesome copper color. Very strong alcohol presence, but extremely inviting. Not as much citrus and floral notes as 90 Minute, but this is a totally different beer. The taste is sweet, syrupy, hints of carmel. Tons of sugar, aging would tame it a bit. Mouthfeel is thick and sticky, great carbonation in my opinion. Overall, this is my first 120, so anything was possible. The hype is there, try this one with caution.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,DonDirkA,4.55,"Finally. Before I get started let me say that if I am within like 2 feet of this glass it smells amazing.  Nose is a mixture of strong, resinous pine and citrus hops and alcohol. Strong alcohol haha. Heavy, sticky pine flavors and alcohol heat intermingle. There's a dominating sweetness and bitterness that sticks around for a long time after. Its delicious and not nearly as strong tasting as I had remembered but it will definitely do well being put away and aged up for a bit. Like it says on the bottle, it can be enjoyed now or aged up for a decade or so. I'm thinking maybe 2-4 years.  Overall I gave it a 4.5, but thats only because in a couple of years it will improve, there is literally nothing wrong with it now.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,2378GCGTG,4.53,"Had on tap at brews brothers  Appearance: golden orange and yellow with a 1 inch full head. The beer is dancing under the head, the bubbles rolling and rising from the bottom of the glass  Nose: Citrus and pine covering a massive abv that isn't really fully evidenced, this certainly doesn't smell like a 18% beer. There is a lot of sweetness here, it borders on too much, which is ok because its just pushing the limits.  Taste: Very malty and very balanced hops-theyre not so much they're own flavor as they are integrated with the taste of the beer. The lighter fruits are present as well, golden raisins and grapes, and there are maybe some cherry notes in there too.  Mouthfeel: Absolutely wonderful, like a liquer almost it is very thick and full yet it flows easily, the carbonation is present but again it balances the beer rather than trying to make itself known.  Overall: I had a 4 year old version of this last year and was blown away, so I was curious to see what it tasted like fresh; I was not unhappy with the results. I have to say I really expected the alcohol taste to come through given what other people have written for reviews, but I think it was barely noticeable which is noteworthy given the huge potency. For a beer this strong, this is a great example of the complexity and craft that dogfish puts in its beer. while its a bit too sweet to give a perfect rating, I would definitely go out of my way to get this, especially to age.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Heavenisbeer,4.79,Had at the Church Key in SF from a hidden keg.  A: Dark golden color. Very little head. Wine-like legs. The ABV obviously mutes the look.  S: Smells of a 90 (tropical fruits and piney resin) but with dark fruits mixed in. Wonderfully complex.  T: The hops are pulled down a bit (compared to the nose). Has a strong IPA/barleywine profile with powerful dark fruits added to the normal citrus and pine punch of a 90. Wet hop linger. A much maltier East Coast version of a West Coast AIPA.  M: As viscous and coating as it gets. Like an AIS.  I think this easily stands up to Pliny the Elder or any other AIPA I've had. Not sessionable but extremely tasty and not as boozy as the ABV (and other reviews) suggest.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

10099,9086,output01x,3.7,"Poured from a 12 oz. capped bottle (Bottled In 2011) into a snifter glass.  A strong pour yields a 1/2-finger cream-colored head that dissipates after a minute or so to a thin dusting and thin foam ring. The body is a hazy dark orange bordering on brown. Some light lacing can be seen throughout consumption.  The nose is full and very complex. Citrus hops aromas meet caramel malts, dark fruit, and sweet alcohol. Notes of tangerine, grapefruit, caramel, berry, and raisins.  Extremely sweet, grainy malts and spicy hops flavors start each sip. Upon swallowing, stronger sweet malts (like a barleywine) come out but quickly fade into dark fruit notes (raisins and prune). This then transitions to a strong booze flavor that rests in the back of the mouth. A good hop bitterness is noticeable throughout most of the tasting but becomes most evident as an aftertaste between sips.  Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer is about as drinkable as an 18% ABV DIPA can get. And while it is a sipper, it is surprisingly drinkable. The body is thick, full, sticky, and a bit syrupy. The carbonation is a bit fizzy but really has its hands full keeping the body a consumable product.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Appearance: A thin skim of bubbles atop a mostly clear copper. Not so much lacing.  Sweet and grainy. Alcoholic, but not alarmingly so . Mildly grassy and lemony. Mellow bitterness that builds slightly.  Overall: It doesn't really taste like beer - it's hot and boozy, but surprisingly well balanced, all things considered.

10099,9086,postulanTrappist,4.37,"Bottled in 2011 (May?).  A - Medium-hard pour gives a 1.5 finger khaki head in my wide DFH Zeno glass. A touch cloudy (unfiltered?) like some kind of deep amber tree sap. Lower carbo, but exceptional head retention given the ABV.  S - First impression is sappy, resiny pine. It does tame the ridiculous alcohol content of this beer a bit. Nutty. Perfumy - like the sea breeze on a beach. Some searching reveals a hint of grain spirit aromas reminiscent of whisky.  T - A lovely crescendo of sweetness into candied orange and port wine. Long finish with sweet marmalade and blood orange fading into nutty special B maltiness, bread dough, and caramel. Hop bitterness is (impressively) there, but it's almost overwhelmed by malt. Recognizable a DIPA, but undeniably extreme.  M - Syrupy like no other DIPA. Thickness you can actually see.  D - If I wasn't worried about developing diabetes or falling out of my chair I could easily drink more. Can't wait to see how it ages.

Very strong notes of fresh pine\ fresh citrus, and spices.  T - Very hop forward, which is not surprising. There is also a boozy bite at the end along with some sharp bitterness. This is the grand-daddy of imperial IPA's. The pungency of the hoppiness is tantalizing and overpowering.  M - How can this possibly be so potent and be this smooth? The epitome of a well blended beer. You never feel how strong this beer really is (until a bit later). Slick coating hits the tongue. Gritty bite at the end. Just a joy to drink.  O - I split a 16oz growler with a buddy, and it was enough. While the beer itself is a one per sitting, you have to try this once.

10099,9086,BBP,3.95,"Pours into a hark hop amber. Slight head but good retention. Laces nicely.  The aroma starts with a fruity hoppiness and a slight amount of malt. Somewhat floral as well. I found it a little light, while everybody else around me found that it was fairly intense. Everybody seemed to think it was one of the best aromas ever.  The taste is actually, surprisingly, incredibly easy hop drinking. Nearly no heat, and remarkably soft for an ~18% beer. It was all about the hop flavour but it didn't seem to bring much hop bitterness with it. They really nailed the balance as well. The malt is fairly rich as well, but it's not the spotlight. It sort of reminds me of 90 Minute in that way. It actually seemed a bit more refined and elegant. Really not the juggernaut I was expecting, but I was still happy with it.  The body was heavy in weight but not the fullest. The finish is dry with moderate stickiness (but less than you'd expect for the ABV).  Overall, it was a solid beer and very balanced. A great example of an extreme beer with great balance. Not as hoppy as I expected, but I had been warned before. Still quite nice. I'd be up to pick this up again to see how age treats it.

T: incredibly sweet and caramelly. Very mild and floral hops, not aggressive at all on the hops. Only mild bitterness.  M: one of the thickest, most viscous ""IPAish"" beers you'll ever drink. Very chewy, with a heavy warming effect, but not an alcohol burn.  O: A memorable beer.

10099,9086,justintcoons,3.59,"Poured into a snifter.  A: Pours an orange/amber with excellent clarity and low carbonation. Not even 1/2 a finger of head shows up before it instantly vanishes.  N: Tangerine, lemon and fruity esters galore. Caramel/toffee, rubbing alcohol and something that smells oaky. Not as aromatic as I hoped.  T: Toffee, caramel, candy sugar, numbing alcohol and hints of lemon juice upfront. Mid-palate shows cleaner caramel malts, notes of tangerine, clementine, some pineapple, lemon, cough syrup and more sugar. Finishes with loads of sugar (some scorched), pine, papaya, lemon zest and orange rind. There's also some kind of burnt earthiness that lingers and tastes rather wood-like.  M: Medium-full bodied, sticky and WARMING. That's all that needs to be said.  O: As far as super high octane beers go the alcohol is hidden quite well with it's 18% abv. Don't get me wrong, it's there and it's pretty apparent but I've had 15% beers that didn't hide the booze as well as 120 does. Sweet, sugary malts really showcase on the beer rather than the hops.

The color is a bit thin at the edges, it looks like it has a ton of booze in it. Leaves pretty good lacing.  S- Alcohol. Lots and lots of it. The smell is pretty harsh. Underneath it I can detect what would otherwise be a pretty nice IPA aroma, with pine and hop flowers.  T- Very quick initial burst of hop flavors, citrus, pine, some honey. This is quickly overwhelmed by an explosion of alcohol and heat, overpowering esters come across as an eye-watering nail polish remover flavor. Alcohol carries some oak/wood flavor in the background and a pretty huge sweetness.  M- Full-bodied, thick, palate-coating. Lots of alcohol burn on the finish.  O- I'm not really sure what to make of this. It's definitely interesting. I feel like the hop flavor is nice but overpowered by the alcohol. I love aggressive beers but, for me, it's too boozy and isn't that much fun to drink, I split this with two friends and felt like I had enough. It's worth a try just for the experience though.

Transitions into a pretty boozy beer, with some caramel, sweet accents.  M: Quite thick, a slight alcohol burn. About what it should be for this beer  Overall, I was really surprised with how much I liked this one. I had heard about it being a sweet, boozy mess, but I think considering the amount of alcohol and hops, it is a very well balanced beer with lots of great flavors.

The nose is very bready and malty with a hint of birthday cake sweetness and some faint citrus hop aromas. There are some definite alcohol esters here. The flavor is identical to the nose. The taste is heavy malt up front with notes of birthday cake and bread followed by a mild citrus hop character with hints of grapefruit and pineapple. The alcohol makes itself known throughout. It adds warmth and body as well as some bite in the finish. The mouthfeel is full bodied, incredibly warm, very smooth, and mildly carbonated.  I really enjoyed this beer. It's like the 90 minute on steroids. The malt character is intense and lends to a more barley wine-like flavor. The hops are more mild but noticeable.

Clearly shouldn't have been there but I am not going to complain - only cost me $3.50!  Split with a few family members on Xmas day. Poured into snifters.  Poured relatively lightly, producing a tiny amount of head in each glass. See through golden-brown in color. Not much action going on in terms of bubbles or sediment (I believe I left most of the sediment in the bottle.  Initial smell blew me away. Minute I took the cap off my nose was filled with some sweet floral scents mixed with evergreen. Definetely can smell the alcohol on this one. The smell made me want to take a big swig, but I was able to resist temptation and took a small taste to contemplate.  Taste was incredible. I let it roll around on my tongue to hit the different parts of my palate. Initial taste is of sweet honey and sugars, followed closely by a stinging alcohol taste, finished with a nice bitter punch. Aftertaste reminded me of one of my favorite childhood snacks - a grapefruit with honey on top.  Moderately heavy mouthfeel. Reminded me of watery-syrup. Alcohol definitely adds a stinging sensation and serious heat in your throat. Left me with a dry mouth.  I truly enjoyed this beer. I am not sure if it had to do with the setting – Stowe Vt., snow falling, music playing, hanging with family - or the fact that this only cost me $3.50.

Intense grapefruit, citrus pith, pine and fresh cut grass open the stroma, with caramel malt rounding things out. The finish is sweet. There's a hint of alcohol, but it's well hidden, considering abv. Bread dough surfaces as it warms.  A huge citrus punch assaults the palate initially, with tangerine, grapefruit, and a tart, almost lime flavor trying to counter the alcohol flavor...but not succeeding entirely. Alcohol is somewhat mellowed by the sweetness of the caramel malt. A pine resin bitterness reigns in the finish. The more sips I take, the less offensive the alcohol. Much better after the initial shock!  Body is thick, but not as thick as I expected. Guess the alcohol thinned it out. Carbonation is moderate and refreshing. Alcoholic warmth closes out the sip.

A - Surprisingly clear orange amber with a 1-finger off-white head into a 10 oz tulip glass. The head fades to 1/4 finger pretty quickly good sheets of lacing. A very good looking beer on the initial pour.  S - Initially almost no smell because it was served too cold. After warming it with my hands I got vegetal hop cones with some mint and herbal/medicinal accents. Sweet malt like date nut bread, alcohol and orange hard candy. Pleasant.  T - Very sweet orange and peppermint candy then a huge wallop of hop floral and bitterness. The brown sugar/fruit sweetness and bitterness duke it out with neither one winning. While they are playing with each other, you notice the big boozy flavor and then the more subtle aspects of the medium roasted malt, oak/tannin and a and leafy/medicinal spice. Quite enjoyable as a big hop explosion.  M - Thick body and light carbonation. Syrupy initially but thins out by being cut by so much alcohol.  O - Very nice. It can appeal to those that like a sipping liquer that want a hop forward brew. Pricey though at $12/10 oz. Yikes. Glad to enjoy this sipper once but not something I'd seek out often for the price.

S: There are moderately strong aromas of citrusy hops in the nose—grapefruit seems to stand out in particular. Hints of alcohol are also perceptible. T: The overall taste is quite bitter, but the flavors of underlying malts are very apparent given the high alcohol content; there notes of alcohol and malty sweetness along with some hints of caramel. M: It feels medium- to full-bodied and a bit syrupy and sticky on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation. There is lots of alcohol warming throughout the taste, not just in the finish. O: The beer definitely tastes strong, but a small fraction of the alcohol is masked from the taste and there is enough bitterness to counteract all of the malty sweetness.

It is creamy and sticks around for a minute before slowly fading back into the beer. I'm guessing this is going to be strong... 4  S - Pine, orange scented cleaner. The pine and fruit characters are nice, but there is a solvent-like backbone that adds the cleaner character that isn't very enjoyable. I'll call it a wash. This is going to be strong... 3  T&M - Yep, this is a bottle of cleaner. It makes my eyes water. My ears just turned red. It burns my tongue. This is at least 18%, but I have had whiskeys that are much smoother. Pure rubbing alcohol flavor dominates here. There are some interesting bright piney bitterness aspects that are hiding behind the booze, but they are largely over-powered. This is either an american barleywine or a ridiculous 6x IPA. My guess is fresh 120 minute. I've had it once with about a year on it, and while it was strong, I remember it being thicker. Perhaps as it warms that will come out a bit. 2.5/2.5  O - This is just way out of balance right now.

Mostly smells of strong piney hops, but also has a very sweet scent to it. In addition has a nice woody aroma.  T: hear me through, for the abv, the alcohol is hidden very well. It is obviously hoppy, however, it is very sweet and you can taste a nice woody flavor adding to the complexity of this craft.  M: leaves mouth feeling watery because it is sweet, but due to high abv it does leave an alcohol burn in the back of your throat.  Overall, this is a very well brew high abv craft. It is not an attempt to cram as much alcohol with zero concern for flavor, it is a very well balanced craft, done very well as expected from DFH",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

This much less perfumy or vegetal than most hops, this is the uber-sweet grapefruit style of hops. Less flower, more fruit.  Ever wonder why this doesn't come bomber size? Think high ABV. Think overwhelming ABV.  A flower festival extravaganza. It is hops madness. Think of this as the hyper-hippy chick that has flowers in her hair. And you want to taste each and every one before you pass out.  Fresh, this is way too strong and completely un-nuanced.

Just a mixture of sweetness, a little bit of citrusy and piny hops, way less alcohol on the nose than I expected. Smelled fantastic!  T: Damn! A first sip brings this rush of flavor to my tongue. Citrusy hops, some pine, and an almost honey-like sweetness. A malty and hoppy mix of magic. Very warming, a little alcohol bite on the finish. Got even better as it warmed a little.

Taste is very fruity, but not unpleasantly so, with plenty of hops to balance on the finish. Very balanced, which is fairly typical of DFH IPAs.  Mouthfeel is perfect given strength.

The grapefruit/citrus is wonderful on the back-end and redeem the flavor of this beer. Some slight harsh hop flavors but not as much as expected based on the description on the bottle.  M - pretty good with high carbonation considering the high alcohol content. Probably the best quality of this beer.  O - I have no clue what this will be like when aged, but hope it is better.

10099,9086,fragilehearted,3.53,"Had this back in 2009 on tap and loved it, when I knew very little about beer. Was excited to try the new version on draft too. On tap at the Meddlesome Moth, served in a wine glass. From notes:  A - almost no head, pretty normal for a high alcohol beer. A few patches stick around while you're drinking. Clear golden orange color. I remember the last version being a fair amount darker than this one.  S - hops first and foremost, for sure. Citrus and lots of booze. Honestly, aroma is more muted than I'd have hoped. Smells a lot more like a DIPA than the one from a couple years back, though.  T - Piney hops and alcohol. Again, more like a DIPA than the previous style. It isn't my favorite style, so a bit of a bummer, but more like the style, so can't ding it for personal preference. However, the taste wasn't that complex. Some citrus, then some caramel/vanilla in the background, but the hops and booze dominate so much that it's not that enjoyable.  M - so very viscous, boozy, and heavy, like drinking liquor. Not that I didn't expect that. A lot of carbonation, considering what it is. I would have preferred a little less.  D/O - sip, sip, sip. I do not want to drink the 2011 version again anytime soon. That thing needs some age on it. Got a bottle a few months ago and plan to hold on to it for at least a couple of years.

Taste is very boozy, a bit syrupy with a strong presence of hops but it's not a very complex imperial flavor.  Mouth feel is ok. Smooth, but not enough efervescent or pre syrupy.  I was a bit let down by this beer.

More carbonation than I was anticipating leads to decent head retention and lacing.  Smell in one word: potent. Huge nose.Tropical fruit notes...guava and mango. Some floral hop notes and a touch of malt in there as well. Definitely the most intense smelling beer I've ever encountered.  Taste is also quite intense. Unlike the nose, the sweetness of the malts dominates here. It's like a pumped up barleywine. The hops have trouble catching up with the malt character. The alcohol warmth isn't as out there as I thought it would be. There's definitely a warming presence, but it's not overwhelming.  I'm digging the mouthfeel on this one...sure, it's syrupy and super resinous, but it's interesting and outside the norm.  Overall, it's a sipper for certain. Big, bold and aggressive.

10099,9086,Naugros,3.23,"With this high of an alcohol content I wasn't expecting a head like this. I poured this into my DFH becker and was rewarded with a good three inches of cream-colored foam. The lacing left behind is pretty impressive. The beer itself is a bit murky (chill haze) but is a decent golden amber and it clears a little as it warms, of course.  The smell isn't what I was expecting either. Citrus and green onion come together nicely with bready malts making a strong back-up showing, promising alcohol. I'm not a fan of the oniony smell in any beer, but it's not as bad here as elsewhere.  My God! That's a strong tasting beer! The 18% is not masked at all and attacks like a cheap sherry or even turpentine. I did expect heat, but I figured the hops load would rule the day...they don't. They're there to be sure, but with citrus and pine and not the onion so much. The heat is the main sense you'll get. This is not a shy beer and one to be sipped. As it warms it gets a bit more drinkable and the alcohol only hits like pine solvent, rather than turpentine...a mild upgrade.  It's not as bitter as expected and is very heavy for an IPA, approaching viscous. The alcohol heat will make you wince on first sip. This beer is definitely meant for aging. I can't quite figure out the bottling date for this one (nothing on the bottle), but with all the issues DFH has had getting this out to its customers it must be from this year. I have another bottle that I will age for a ""decade or two"" as the label suggests and see if that helps. I promise to amend my review at that time.  Another TIPA and another one where I fail to see this as a desirable beer. But I once felt this way about barleywines until I warmed up to them. This beer will be hard to finish as I think the one sip my wife took is all she'll want.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,rmcnealy,3.36,"2011 Vintage  Served very chilled. Drinking slow to get a good taste profile across the entire spectrum in hopes of experiencing changing flavors. Poured a medium, medium/dark non-translucent golden amber. It appears to be totally filtered. As with high ABV brews, there was virtually no head. First smells are of undiscernable citrus (grapefruit?), booziness, sweetness, VERY MILD hops and a noticeable maltiness. The tastes are incredibly boozy. The hoppiness definitely gets drowned out by the alcohol tastes. Citrus, grapefruit, tangerine tastes are very strong. I still believe hoppy beers are best enjoyed with a moderate booziness. The mouthfeel is average. It is definitely syrupy and there is little to no carbonation. A decent beer overall (although not a proto-typical iIPA) But as a hophead, I'm disappointed in what is generally regarded as one of the best IPAs. I'm glad I tried it again to reaffirm my original thoughts, but at $10.99 a 12oz'er, I'll probably opt for something else next time unless I ran across it on tap.

Some Citrus is in the there too. Oranges, lemon and maybe grapefruit. malt smells kind of bready, but sweet too.  Taste: This is really sweet. Almost like a bready honey. The hops are also there, but the hops just don't quite balance out the malts. Not a whole lot of bitterness from the hops.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied beer with low carbonation. This beer is syrup and just thick.  Overall: A once in a lifetime experience with this beer. I am glad I tried it, but I would probably not drink this one again. It was great for what the beer was, but it just too big to call a traditional Imperial IPA.

10099,9086,mrfrancis,4.15,"A: Pours a hazy golden amber with a clinging white mousse. Once the beer settles in the glass, little streams of carbonation are clearly visible.  S: Aromas of peach, mango, bitter orange, lemon, grapefruit, pine, sage, and mint fill the nose and mask the high alcohol percentage nicely. This smells very inviting.  T: Notes of biscuits, caramel, cider apples, mint, sage, lemon rind, bitter orange, pine, brown sugar, white peach, mango, and grapefruit fill the mouth. Oddly, the hop flavors are the last things I noticed after this beer hit my tongue. The malt seems to dominate, but the overall effect is quite nice. Still, I was expecting a bit more of a resinous flavor.  M: Full bodied and silky in the mouth, this beer develops a somewhat syrupy, resinous character just before the finish. Carbonation is very active, but is not overly forceful. As one would expect from a beer this strong, alcohol presence is pronounced. Thankfully though, it does not burn all that much.  O: This is an extremely unique DIPA, but I'm not sure I will rush to pick up a bottle next year. This is a very good beer, and I'm glad I got the opportunity to try it, but I can't help feeling a bit disappointed. When I think DIPA, I automatically think of big, resinous, citrusy hop flavors, of which this ale doesn't really display all that many. The malt dominates this one, and while I would expect that of a Belgian quad or a Belgian strong dark ale, I would not expect that of an American DIPA. Still, this is an interesting ale that is worth a try.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Some strong hops in the background but hard to pick out their profile. Even a little medicinal, like a band aid.  T- There just isn't a lot of hops here. If there are any it's impossible to perceive them over the sweet boozy mess of a thing this is. Upon tasting it, I can see why people take to calling 120 a barleywine, this isn't one but if it was it would be a bad one. Starts of nice enough every taste make me think I might even like it, then that crazy sweetness hits, followed by a booze burn.  M- Strange, not unpleasant, other than the aftertaste. Far too sweet.

O: I loved it, more than I thought I would. It's definitely over the top for an IPA, but it really works for me. The hop profile is great and tue sweetness only seems to back it up. I would drink this regularly if I could afford to...",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Alcohol  Taste: Extremely sweet, I have a 2011 bottle served at room temp and its nothing like what I expected it to be. I thought it was going to be so bitter my teeth would pop out of my mouth but instead the sweetness of this nectar overpowers the bitterness of the hops. It's almost too balanced for what it's claiming to be (an Imperial Indian Pale Ale)  Mouthfeel: syrupy  Overall: I probably would not buy this again as I prefer both 60 and 90 minute as they are true IPA's, however, this is definitely something to try at least once. I definitely like their World Wide Stout better in terms of their limited ageable offerings.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Smell- Alcohol comes right away, but it fades into toffee, citrus and then figs and prunes.  Taste- Carmel right up front. Turns into prunes, pear and citrus.  Mouthfeel- Rather thin for being so high in ABV. Coats your mouth with a delicious barleywine type of sugary goodness.  Overall- I truly do not think DFH could make a bad beer. Do NOT drink this beer cold! Let it warm up and it completely changes.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,vfgccp,4.69,"A – Bright orange amber body. Light off-white head is thin with low lace, but what’s there manages to stick around with nice retention.  S – Soft, fruity alcohol, cloves, buckwheat honey, and a generous helping of apricots and stewed pairs. Round floral notes accent the nose.  T – Opens with a delicious combination of caramel, buckwheat honey, and an apricot reduction. White hot alcohol clears out the center of the profile to reveal bright woody hops. The bitterness glows through a cocktail of booze and honey on the slow, meandering finish.  M – The booze lends an ethereal quality to what is otherwise a full body.  O – Slow sipping, but complex and delicious. Think whisky IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,amp138,3.65,"Well, thanks to my wonderful girlfriend's generosity on my birthday, I finally got to experience this behemoth. As soon as you crack open the bottle, you're pretty much overwhelmed. It's strong. Real, real, real, super duper strong. Her roommate walked in the room as we were drinking it and said that he could smell it from the other part of the kitchen.  With the alcohol content so high, I wasn't shocked that the pour was very thick, almost syrupy, but when it finished pouring, it did elicit a little bit of head - reminding you that indeed, this is in fact a beer. The golden amber color was very pleasing, as I was expecting it to be slightly darker (in regards to the near 20 ABV).  Tasting it was a whole different world. 120 Minute is as if the bitterness of the hops and the sickly sweetness of the malts are having a knockdown, drag-out, pier six brawl in your mouth, with the sweetness coming out on top. I was expecting the opposite. I wanted to be overwhelmed with hops, because I can't get enough of hoppy beers, but it was not to be. That was slightly disappointing. The beer was heavy, but unlike the normal heavier styles (stout, porter, etc.), this did carry with it some ethereal crispness to it underneath the brutality of the alcohol content and the thick consistency.  I drank 3/4 of the bottle and my girlfriend polished off the rest. After that much, I was pretty much half in the bag. This beer is no joke. It's like haymaker with brass knuckles. Dogfish Head 120 is definitely something to experience at least once if you can get your hands on it. However, consume this in moderation. One bottle is more than enough and this is definitely not for your average suds-sipper.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,MsRif,4.2,"I've had the '03 (in Oct. '11) bottle, '08 (in April '11) bottle and '11 on tap versions of 120 minute. As a fresh brew, it's pretty harsh. Very alcohol forward, very hoppy and definitely something you have to take your time with. The '08 was a little more smooth, but still harsh. Actually tasted a little more sour to me than the '11...definitely more malty. All around kind of strange, but good. The '08 was my least favorite of the ones I've had. The '03 was almost an entirely different beer. Sweet, smooth...so drinkable. Malty with a well-balanced hop profile that was seriously just heavenly. I need to get more bottles and age them because I think this is one of the best brews to age, all around.  No head or lacing to be found on any of the variations that I have tried. Generally dark amber in color, and a bit viscous in appearance and mouthfeel. This is a sipping beer when it's fresh, and almost a session beer (seriously) when it's aged.

10099,9086,cosmo4u,3.75,"Pours a clear orange honey golden with a low dense golden head. The initial cap liftoff unleashes a sharp, fragrant cloud of aroma, and my anticipation is heightened. Once in the glass, the aroma changes quite a bit however, with the resinous hops becoming more muted behind sweet fruit malts. The palate is thick and sticky, with intense hop character married to honey-sweet malts reminiscent of Madeira. As sweet as it is hoppy, this will not be to everyone’s taste, but there is almost no other way to support such a supersaturation of hops. This is a unique beer experience to be certain, one to be savoured and contemplated in an unhurried way. Quite remarkable really.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

A: Pours a very hazy amber, almost burnt sienna like color with a half finger head off white head that forms on the pour. The head dies down to a thick wispy collar that leaves some soapy lace down the glass.  S: Smells very boozy and sweet right off the bat. The booze is a little overpowering, but I guess I should expect that with an 18% abv. Very bitter pine in the backdrop as well with some subtle oat malt.  T: The malt is very prominent upfront which leads to a very sweet boozy middle. The backend is very piny and resiny in a semi sweet and bitter way with a touch of heat, but it's not offputting. Very front heavy in the taste and it doesn't come together at all.  M: The mouthfeel is sticky and syrupy, medium bodied. Definitely a sipper. It's a little on the tougher side to drink at this point.  O: Well this is all hype in my eyes. Overall the taste doesn't come together as the booze dominates and the hops all bitterness on the backend. Maybe an aged one that has turned into a quasi barleywine would be much better, but I can't say for sure.

There is light, spotty lacing.  S: Smells primarily of hops with floral and pine notes. There is also the noticeable scent of alcohol.  T: There is a large dose of sweet malt that I didn't catch in the smell. Hops and alcohol are still decidedly prominent, providing a burning bitterness that is almost overpowering.  M: Thin and the alcohol gives a mild burning sensation.  O: The sweet malt flavor goes a long way in complementing the powerful, bitter alcohol and hops.

10099,9086,prg1976,3.96,"Fresh batch, fresh review:  November 2011 bottle (no actual date, just 2011 E - annoying)  Pours a nice clear amber color. very little head, and only a small ring of pale white that hangs around.  Smell is a mix of hops and alcohol - lots and lots of both of them.  Taste is surprisingly good. Still very hot, but the hops are there, and the sweetness is toned down a lot from the last time I had it.  Still pretty heavy, and not very carbed.  Overall, this should probably have its own category, as it's not exactly a DIPA. it's better than the year old bottle I had before, but not as good as when I had it on draft over the summer at the brewpub. I'm glad I have a few more bottles to put aside.  Bottled on 2/6/09, I've let this one sit awhile.  Pours a dark amber color. Small white/off-white head, dissipates quickly.  At first it still smells a little hoppy, but that faded away pretty fast. Mostly alcohol and caramel malt smell.  Taste is super-sweet caramel, then the 18+% abv hits you. The alcohol sticks around for a while, too.  Mouthfeel is ok, not very carbonated, the alcohol overpowers everything else.  Drinkability...yeah, not a guzzler (despite what I've seen on YouTube). Almost too sweet to enjoy.  I'll be back in a month or so with a review of a fresh one. I'm kindof let down with this one right now.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Smells: a super sweet hop character with a presence on alcohol.  Tastes: a super sweet imperial. the hop notes are out of the world in this ale with a candied citrus hint that leaves a wonderful finish.  Mouthfeel: there is a burn from the high ABV. but it is sweet and flavorful feeling to compliment this ale. Which makes it a great brew to enjoy and share a sip with a loved one.

10099,9086,jmshulk,4.43,"This is a 2006 120 min. IPA poured into my brand new DFH goblet glass. It is almost 5 years old to the day. I can't tell if the born on date is 12/13 or 12/18/2006.  Look: A darker brownish/cherry color, off white head is small and falls into the brew quite fast. It certainly doesn't look like any other IPA. There is a good amount of cloudiness too.  Smell: It has a distinct hop resin scent with some honey, caramel, and dark fruit notes as well. It's strong and quite impressive. There is also a subtle hint at the potent alcohol content of the brew. As it warms it almost has an anise aroma.  Taste: There is a bit of a burnt caramel and cherry kind of flavor up front that develops into a more hoppy bitterness. The hops are kind of earthy at this point. It's kind of an odd toasty bitterness with a bit of citrus and an alcohol kick to finish it off. Despite the citrus hop bitterness, the overall taste is really sweet. I really wish I had a young bottle to compare side by side with this five year old bottle.  Feel: It actually has a pretty nice smooth, silky feel. There is definitely a bit of stickiness too.  Overall: This is the second bottle of 120 that I have had. The first was a much younger bottle and I don't remember much about it except that the flavor was too much for me. The sweetness was far too overpowering and while there is still a good amount of sweetness now, it's not as bad. This is a much more mellow and mature flavor that I really enjoy. The aroma and tastes are the real highlights for me. It is very unique. It also goes down surprisingly quick for such a high alcohol beer. I give it a 4.5 overall because it is such a unique smell and flavor, but I suspect that is because of the age and that a younger 120 would get a slightly lower score.

Huge grapefruit hops slam the face, lemon citrus all over the place, a subtle but present dark fruit aroma also. Earthy, tobacco, piny wood characters follow as the beer warms up. A spice like scent is created from the bready sugary malt meeting with the bold alcohol scent. So complex, the nose on this beer is insane. Caramalized fruit explodes on the tongue. Bold sugar meet grapefruits, tobacco, sweet fruits and subtle alcohol. Gigantic on body and feel, through the roof. Subtle and sweet despite the 18%, you only really feel the booze through the heat not in taste or on the nose. Overall; this beer is insane, its aggressive with hops, malts , alcohol and sugar.

10099,9086,ToasterChef,3.82,"This bottle of 120 Minute IPA is from the most current batch, which showed up in stores in Maine this week. It was in an open refrigerated case, and once I brought i home, placed in my cellar for a few hours.  A translucent golden copper body has a small tan foam head. The head settles to nothing but a ring that clings to the sides of the glass. Some sparse carbonation can be seen within. Swirling the glass leaves an oily slick. The body has the color of a normal DIPA, if not the clarity, but the head doesn't seem to fit to the style. Of course, this is hardly a normal DIPA.  The hop aroma isn't too strong here. I caught a whiff of hops while pouring, but after that I couldn't smell anything until I actively inhaled close to the glass. Earthy hops are prominent. It balances with a mild sweetness.  'Surprisingly not boozy' is my first reaction to tasting this beer. It has a decent bitterness, with flavors of pine needles and grapefruit. There is a decent amount of sugar that can be tasted, but it isn't a super sweet beer. Some alcohol is present at the finish. It has a slight stinging quality that works well with the hop oils.  It is a sticky beer. A film is left on my lips. Within my mouth, the coat left behind has some bitterness, but also a lot of alcoholic vapors. It is here you can tell this is a strong beer.  This obviously isn't an everyday sort of beer. It also isn't an everyday DIPA. For being an extreme version of an already ""extreme beer"" style, this beer works surprisingly well. It is worth trying once, even if you aren't a hop head. I am very curious to see how it tastes with some age on it. I already have a bottle in my cellar that I've been aging for 2 years.

The smell is a bit hoppy but with malty sweetness that was a bit surprising. There is even a slight spicy flavor that gives a bit of a zing to the nose.  The taste is big bitter hop flavor with a good sized alcohol flavor. There is some fruit flavor there that is a little piney flavor mixed in. It is hard to draw on much since there is such a large bitterness there is also some sweet malt flavor that comes out when your able to get past the hops and alcohol.  The feel of this beer is big all around. The force of this beer as it mahandles your pallet is something else. I had to take my time with this one.

Head dissipates to leave a soapy ring around the glass. Small amount lacing.  S - Not as much hops as I was expecting (and hoping). It's really sweet and boozy. Lots of sweet maltiness, caramel and toffee. Some citrus and piney aromas from the hops play in. I also pick up the smell of honey.  T - Hello alcohol. To no surprise, the alcohol hits right off the bat and only seems to slightly mellow. The warmth from the alcohol can be felt through the entire sip. It's quite sweet as well. Sweet caramel and roasted malts come in along with lemon and orange notes. Again, the hops are drowned out. Not much bitterness.  M - Thick and syrupy. Minimal amount of carbonation. This is more like drinking a brandy or liqueur than a beer. A noticeable warmth from the alcohol but that is to be expected at 18% abv.  O - An interesting beer indeed. No doubt about it, it's a sipper. This drinks more like a brandy or liquer than a beer. As a DIPA, this doesn't hit the mark. But I don't think DFH's intention was to hit the mark. I really wished the hops played a bigger role in this beer. It was just a little sweet. However, as the beer warmed, I found it to be more enjoyable.

Well balanced.  T- Enormous complexity, but balanced. Caramel, roasted, and toffee malts back the big hops but blends very smooth. Warmth is somewhat there but hidden pretty well considering the ABV. Pine, Citrus, slight ""evergreen"" quality here as well, other than the pine. Aftertaste is slightly dry with a sticky hop flavor left on the tongue. This does not drink like a barley wine for me, but not quite an IIPA either.  M- Medium/Thick with a good amount of carbonation. ""Hop Syrup"" feel, but not as thick as I thought.  O- Very good 'extreme' beer. More balanced with the malt qualities than I would have thought. Hops are still very much alive though, and I couldn't be happier.

Pours a thick one finger head, which rapidly reduces to a thin cap, easily revived though, it is a live ale. Surprisingly light color, medium amber at best, fine bubble carbonation.  Big malt aroma when first poured, but quickly overpowered by “crushed hops”, alcohol, citrus, lemon, dried fruit (fig?), yeast and bread. Spicy. Complex.  Very boozy, hot entry on the palate, followed by a hop “burn”. Then some light malt comes forward, only to lose to the hops in the end. Very full, oily, mouth feel.  Long finish of hop oil, not overly bitter, but coats your mouth forever.  Well I have had this before in bottle and really did not like it at all. The draft is a much more pleasant experience by far. Definite hop burn, but that being said the overall flavor is quite good (tasty malt and spicy hops). You really can’t say this is a balanced ale, but still an interesting experience, and I am thankful for it. Seems at its best warm, say 55 + degrees. Everything that this ale has comes out then, and that is quite a lot. A huge ale. ABV is 18% or better depending on the keg, and it is very noticeable.

Also noted are molasses and dark fruit resins, a rush of hops balanced it out nicely. A slight burn on the back of the throat from the ABV. Surprisingly drinkable for such a large ABV.

S- Big front of malt character, then grapefruit/ mango hop notes.  T - The complexity of this beer made me anxious to try it on draft. The first and most lingering note is the hop flavor, but it drinks more liek a barley wine, with distinct malt flavors, that are present in most of dogfishhead's big IPAs. A barly wine/congac type of warmth radiates through you after drinking this, which is the only indication of a high 18% ABV.  M- The ABV is apparent, but its smooth and meant to be sipped as slow as you can go.  O - An extreme beer at 18% but more of a barley wine than an imperial IPA.

A - Lighter than I'd have though. Thick but inviting. nice head. Little carbonation. Alcohol lacing grips the glass forever.  S - Citrus and hops. Lemon + malts. Nice, not crazy.  T - Very complex. A lot going on here. Syrupy and hops and wood, malts all mask the ridiculous amount of alcohol. Yum. Makes me want to keep drinking (sipping) it. Wow is really well balanced and super warming. Really nice mouthfeel. Makes you smile and nod with each sip. Thick thick, tongue coating, and sticky.  O - Hmm.

10099,9086,vandemonian,4.4,"I had this 120 min at the restaurant in Gaithersburg and it was super fresh, having been released about a week beforehand (I had it on Jul 19). Previously I'd only had aged bottles and they always tasted like barleywines. Fresh 120 minute actually tastes/smells like an extra malty and boozy IPA.  A: Cloudy orange colour and a 1 cm head that lasts. 4.5  S: Intense hops. Amarillo to the point of feeling like I'm eating it. Very green aroma. 4.5  T: The hoppiness is there, but I noticed the strong, malty base more. Very roasty malt. The crystal malt that gives it a strong toffee flavour. Pretty sweet with some smoke. Not especially bitter. Oily green hop aftertaste sticks to the tongue. Dare I say, it could have used more hops. Unique and yum though. 4.5  M: Foamy and thick 4.5  O 4.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,suspect,4.35,"Bottled 7/7/2008 - Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Duvel Tulip. Served at proper cellar temp.  A: Pours a deep copper, clear-yet-slightly-hazy color. Aggressive, 6oz center pour leads to a half-finger off white head that disappears relatively quickly leading to sticky, consistent lacing.  S: Supremely sticky sweet malt forward, caramel malt. ABV is very prominent here but somehow either before, or after, there is a subdued pungent spruce that has to come from the hops but it's a weirdly fermented smelling. In a good way - if that makes sense.  T: Holy shit - this is a phenomenal beer. Tastes like a barleywine, and drinks like a barleywine and the age has really done this thing wonders. It's backed the alcohol flavor down and brought the syrupy, caramel malt flavor forward. It's really, really delicious.  M: Medium body, wonderfully carbonated. Aftertaste lingers for ever and lead. Finish is crisp and bitter.  O: Insanely complex, smooth 18% beer. This doesn't really fit in the IIPA category but it's definitely in a class of its own.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,ProducerBRBeer,4,"A - Great head retention. The lace holds strong. This pours a gold amber. You can tell at the pour that it is a medium bodied beer.  S - Very hoppy smell with a fruity to citrus scent. I can almost smell the acidity.  T - Sweet for an ipa with a strong bitterness from the hops. It almost seems to even out from the two radicals. There is a booming of flavor which is what I expected from this beer.  M - Such a thick viscosity to this beer. I have had stouts that were lighter than this beer. The carbonation is noticeable in this beer but not overpowering.  O - This is a good beer. Out of all dogfish head's beers I preferred this one, except for the chicory stout. This lives up to it's expectations.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,liamt07,3.65,"Bottle shared by Steve at my 22nd birthday. 12oz bottle, 2010 date on the bottle.  Poured a slightly hazy orange brown, moderate amounts of retention and lace. Nose has loads of hops and citrus notes, mild pineapple among other things. Herbal notes, that I'm sure come as a result of the sheer amount of hops here. Some fusel alcohol. Massive malt base - caramel and toffee, some toasty malt notes as well. Taste has lots of resinous hop flavours, lightly toasty malts and sugary caramel and toffee notes. Chewy and sticky feel, but not extremely heavy. Ethanol and heat in the finish, fairly bitter but not palate shredding. Super sweet and rich overall, a sample of this was adequate. I wasn't terribly blown away with this, but this was certainly an experience.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,nmbr0ne,3.75,"Poured into snifter from 12oz bottle. Bottled on date: 9/19/11  Appearance: Pretty amber color. Decent amount of lacing on the sides of the glass. Finger-thick, off-white head.  Smells: The aroma is really good, regardless of how much alcohol I detected. I can tell it's going to be a boozy beer. I get hints of agave nectar, apple juice, caramel, and the slightest bit of hops. The malts definitely overpower the hops though.  Taste: Ridiculously sweet. At first I didn't even really detect the hops. The bitterness in the finish is the only indication I get that the beer was hopped. There is definitely alcohol in the finish too.  Mouthfeel: Creamy in my opinion. A little on the thick side actually. Little to no carbonation, and I wish there was more. I need that refreshing feeling. This beer does the opposite, and the warmth of the alcohol settles in your throat for a while after sipping. Probably a better idea to have had this beer on a cold night.  Overall: It's an interesting beer. I like its taste, but at the same time I don't because this isn't what I feel a Double IPA should taste like. I miss the hoppiness. Where's the citrusy hops? I don't particularly like sweet IPA's, but I can't deny that this is still a good beer. Not my favorite Double IPA, yet I can't stop sipping it.

Definitely coats tongue and mouth.  O- A little bit of a burn after it lands in the belly. Had this in 2008 and 2009...I think. This is not as syrupy as in the past. Love it! Hard to describe.

Nice coppery orange coloration with just a bit o' wisp for a head. Amongst the many citrus smells, I'm actually catching a bit of bubble gum. Taste is strong, but again, the abv is hidden pretty well. Nice crisp bite at the end. A surprising creaminess is there on the mouthfeel.

I think the head would be a dirty-white if I could manage to get one. It just fizzles out.  S- Citrus medley of all sorts... mandarin, orange a bit of grapefruit. Also smells of unfermented wort... like LME or something. Lots of alcohol, but it smells great.  T- Very smooth. The malt taste is peculiar, different than what I'm used to. Surprising how little hop bite there is. The bitterness doesn't linger. Not as syrupy and sickly sweet as I thought (or as people tend to say). Some white tea and the lightest touch of caramel.  M- Obviously not thin... not as thick as I thought though. Moderate carbonation gives it all a nice foamy texture.  O- I enjoyed this. Kind of a bummer since I want to buy more and I found this one for $12.95.  It's a sunny -1C day in Montreal and this has a nice refreshing yet warming quality to it. Good beer.

10099,9086,bebbcorp,4.57,"Served from the bottle into a Great Divide Brussel's glass. Beer is at cellar temp and was bottled 12/18/2006. Smells coming from the bottle are deep caramel and molasses. Pours a dark brown with a one finger head that quickly recedes into a very patchy lace. Beer appears to be mildly carbonatedas there are some bubbles steadily rising to the surface of the glass. Beer has a very potent aroma of brown sugar that can be detected at quite a distance from the glass. Beer goes down smoothly for such a high abv. Slight alcohol burn followed by heavy sweetness and a touch of bitter hops. The mouthfeel is full but not as creamy as I had hoped, but seems to be appropiate for a sipping beer of this strength. Every sip of this beer I take I grow to like the beer more. At this age of a bottle it has matured into a lovely very large barleywine and is would sit well with those looking for a very sweet and balanced barleywine that hides it's abv very well. If I hadn't known it was 18% I would have guessed it to be around 12%. Have not had this beer fresh, but would imagine it to be an animal of a beer. Looking forward to getting a fresh bottle and doing a side-by-side tasting.

A thin scum and collar lasted the whole beer through and left a few spots of soapy lacing down the glass. S: Very strong and volatile notes of solventy alcohol mixed with fruity notes of citrus fruits and berries. T: Follows the nose. It’s pretty sweet and almost honey or nectar-like. The hops are fruity, although I wouldn’t go so far as to say citrusy. The finish is full of raisins and a bit of caramel, and the aftertaste has notes of tobacco and leather.

There is a decent amount of hops, mainly citrusy, in the nose, but this is still highly malty for an ipa. Alcohol is also quite present.  The hops are very muted. There is an incredible sweetness up front filled with caramel and honey. On the backside the citrus and grapefruit come out slightly, but is also entwined with the strong presence of alcohol.  Medium body and carbonation. It is a bit thicker than most ipas and is very oily.

10099,9086,ShemRahBoo,4.08,"Pours a lovely golden color, see through and clear. No retention to speak of and the head dissipated fairly quickly. Aroma is boozy which resides to the large sweet malty body. Aggressive hopping also allows a large pineyness and earthy/resinous dominance on the aroma. The taste is a balance of three extremes. Those of hops, alcohol, and sweetness. For me these three meet a middleground which I found very complex and satisfying. Alcohol on the palette is detectable but the sweetness and hop flavor and bitterness mingle and make it not hot. Huge pine resinous type flavor with a little citrus. Honey and caramel-like flavors balance with the huge over the top hoppiness. The beer is full bodied and a little syrupy. Carbonation is good. The mouthfeel does not get in the way of enjoying this beer, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this. Overall, I love this beer. The balance of the extremes is very impressive.

Rich toasted caramel malts and a large overlay of Booze. Pungent. The first couple sips very surprisingly smooth. Creamy caramel, toasted Portuguese bread. Hops aren't overly bitter. A dark fruity character upfront and a pine sap finish. As it warms up the booze really starts to come through. The malt flavors start to become syrupy medicine halfway through the glass.

Burst of very sweet caramel/honey biscuit up front followed by pine, tangerine, grapefruit, and a warming finish with more malt sweetness and booze.  Worth trying on tap at least once but I don't know whether I'd seek this out in the bottle. The alcohol was noticeable but better masked than I had expected.

10099,9086,rodney45,4.97,"Note: This is the late 2011 batch of this beer. Im trying it in early Nov, and was told it came in late Oct. Saved one to age.  A- Sandy colored decently sized head, for the ABV, sits atop a beautifully defined aurburn, the way a very worn football looks. I could swear that a two thirds of the way through this beer, the spider web like lacing spelled out my name.  S- At first the nose fills with malt character, then is quickly replaced by ethers and grapefruit/ mango hop notes.  T The anticipation and sheer complexity of this beer makes me proceed this tasting with a fine-toothed comb. The first and most lingering note is the hop flavor. It can be broken down into several invidual distinctions: Blood orange, mango, grapefruit and the type of orange you find in diner fruit salads(only way to describe it). This is all laid on a menagerie of distinct malt flavors, that are present in most of dogfishhead's big IPAs. A barly wine/congac type of warmth radiates through you after drinking this, which is the only indication of a high ABV.  M- It hides the ABV very well, but for 10 bucks a 12 oz, i cant imagine it sneaking up on you. Its smooth and meant to be sipped as slow as she can go. It is bitter, but is not overpowering.  O This is the top tier of beer-dom. Its not meant to be reached without climbing the ladder. You can purchase this, review it, and give it a score, but i somehow feel that this beer is judging you. The people at DFH know what theyre doing, and judging by their recent delay of the 2011 120min IPA (because they didnt think it was up to par), I can safely say that they know when they have made the best IPA around (and never settle on less than perfect) The burden of judgement lies not upon them, but on you.

Little carbonation and lightly active bubbles rising slowly to the top.  Smell - Very clean, brisk, hoppy smell. Big plant-like aroma, earthy pine and slight straw. Hops dominate the aroma, creating imagery of endless forests of hop vines.  Taste- Extremely flavorful and much sweeter than expected. Big malts give flavors of sweet biscuit and faint honey. The mondo amount of hops create an active, resinous phenomenon in my mouth, with notes of big earthy pine and citrus. It's like biting into a hop. Definitely boozy, and the warming effects of the alcohol can be felt quickly. I like the bigness and balance- enormously sweet malts meet enormously bitter hops meet enormous alcohol.  Mouthfeel- Syrupy, thick and slightly oily. Very full-bodied, but still refreshing.    Overall- Rich, big and bold. Oddly drinkable despite such massive characteristics.

There is a puffy white head that dissipates over time leaving a thin ring of foam around the top of the beer and a good amount of lacing on the glass.  S: Smells like white bread, malts, a bit of citrus, and alcohol. You're not kidding yourself with an 18% IPA. The alcohol is there.  T: Right up front there is a sweet citrus, but only for a second. It then it changes to pure booze. It tastes like acne astringent.  M: Fully bodied for an IPA. There is some cloying of sweet malt and it finishes super dry with that massive alcohol kick.  O: I get it. The biggest, baddest, IPA on the block! But what I don't get is why people like this.

Malts follow, subtle in the hop department.  T: Not quite what I was expecting. I liked it even though it shares almost no characteristics of the variety. Plenty of malts upfront followed by unpleasant bitterness that builds throughout the tasting and really detracts from the overall experience.

S: Huge hop nose. Like if pine sap was boiled with grapefruit, tangerine, and tropical fruits. Citrus notes dominate, but there is certainly a sweet finish to the aroma.  T: Yowser, that beer is crazy. Resiny, citrusy, sticky, sappy, piney hop flavor. There is a good amount of malt sweetness to back it up, and the alcohol certainly gives you a hell of a kick in the finish. Tropical fruits linger throughout, which helps create a yin and yang between the bitterness and the sweetness.  M: Thick and sticky. The carbonation is medium, and fine in size. I think it works. There is a certain oily feel to it.  O: Overall this is a very interesting beer, and I am very glad that I got to try it.

10099,9086,StonedTrippin,4.32,"holy moly! this is the hophead mecca as far as i am concerned. pours a heady cloudy golden bronze color with what surely must be the thickest head in the history of beer. textured like a bouncy ball! smell is elemental hops, resins, oils, saps, lupulin, all of it. there is a noticeable alcohol smell as well, which of course there must be at 18% abv. the flavor is hectic, evacuating all other flavors from the mouth in favor of the hops in this beer, its got a slight bready thing going on, but its more like a hop loaf. a novel idea brilliantly executed, but this could never be anyone's daily drink. its just a huge huge beer. mouthfeel is sticky and chewy and bogged down by the absurd hopping. i like to have a couple of these every year, and i find the on tap version to be even more pronounced than the bottled version. another classic from dogfish head  edit: just had a really old bottle of this, and i mean really old, like 13 years or more old, wow. it is basically cognac at this point, hard to believe it was ever an ipa, even though there are still some hop elements present here, not least of which is some late onset bitterness to balance some of the rich malty sweetness which is now way more pronounced than i ever remember this being when it was fresh. past mahogany to almost dark brown now, no head, major viscosity, a ton of bottom of the bottle sediment, sandy almost, and a syrupy texture, just insane, doesnt look anything like the original. heavy oxidation in the nose and molasses and brown sugar notes, almost hints at a belgian quad in some respects, raisin, brandy, sherry, compost and rot, its crazy. the flavor has some pine and bitter bite remaining from all the hops, even after all this time, but this has decayed into more of a spirit than a beer, massively flavorful and alcoholic. wet cardboard, figs, old wood, soy and umami, its so layered. sloppy and heavy enough feeling that i dont want a lot of this, its unrecognizable from the iconic original when its fresh, but i see why people hang onto this so long too, even though i prefer it new. what a cool drinking experience, big thanks to my buddy for not only saving this all these years to share with me, but also for schlepping it up in a way too heavy backpack on the motorcycle so we could drink it! real neat experience, heavy heavy beer.  edit: there is a window, sometime later than fresh and sometime newer than ancient, where this really sings. just had one in the ten year range and it was less dense and chunky and oxidized than the one mentioned above, but had all the hops faded out and some of the sugar too, so it presented like rich and complex american barleywine still almost in a prime. probably a lot has to do with how these are stored, and maybe some variance batch to batch over the years, but it also seems to be in constant evolution. i liked this one a little better than the even older one, but know you are in for an adventure when you get past five or so years on these!  edit: been years and years since i had a fresh one of these, 2022 now popping with the new label, so good, i somehow forgot that this really is the gold standard of hoppy beer this strong, its actually not kitchen sinky at all, gorgeously balanced with malt body and sweetness, toffee and almost a nougat note and a candied thing to the hops, dank and resinous and weedy, but also candied grapefruit peel and fresh tangerine emerge, impressively great, and not even really all that alcoholic for what it is. world class, no doubt!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,RandomBattle,4.42,"First time ever having this beer, have had the 60 and 90 minute countless times. Poured from the bottle to a tulip, I didn't think to use my Dogfish Head snifter, gah!  Appearance - pours a pale gold color with a one finger soapy head. While it doesn't impress it has a solid look to it.  Smell - sweet sugary hops, and some slight ethanol.  Taste - very much like smell. Sweet hop flavor right up front, a nice malty back bone, and alcohol! Reminded me a lot of Southamptons Old Herb.  Mouthfeel - I happened to be sipping this one since I split the bottle, but wouldn't necessarily say it's a sipper. It has a slightly syrupy consistency.  Overall - it was quite enjoyable, I was happy splitting the bottle with someone, it was just enough. It sort of falls under the category of a hoppy barleywine in my mind. A nice boozy, hoppy kick in the mouth.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,smerrell,4.94,"Appearance: head dissipates quickly, golden in color  Smell: Hops! floral spice - notes of honeysuckle and sugar  Taste: Wow. Very similar to a barleywine, but much more intense. If someone told you it was a Caramel liquor, you'd likely believe it. Incredible flavor with a ton of complexity. The alcohol is present, but not overpowering  Mouth feel: a sweet attack that coats your tongue. There is a long, hoppy finish.  Overall: This is a powerful beer - much closer to a fine whiskey than a beer. This one is defines what a ""sipper"" is - no sane person would drink a whole bottle in an evening. Fantastic!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Kbogac,4.31,"Intense! That best describes this beer. Draft poured in a small snifter. Darker yellow with a nice inch of fairly dense foam. My color could be off a bit, the bar was dark. The smell is great. Like sticking your face in a bushel of hops. At first the taste is a little much. Extreme sweet hops with alcohol. Once your taste buds recover the sweet, juciy hoppiness takes the stage with some oak and citrus making an appearance. Mouthfeel is medium, not as heavy as you'd expect from something this big. Overall an enjoyable experience. Defiantly a one beer show. Not only due to the ABV by your taste buds are a little worn out when finished. Interesting ans unique beer. Highly recommended.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,aorloski,4.25,"Appearance - Pours an incredibly lush burnt orange. I was amazed at how much of a head this thing poured at 18%. Looks like a beautiful regular american IPA. Alcohol legs obviously are pretty thick and a minimal head sticks around for the duration, pretty amazed.  Smell - As soon as i opened this bottle the hops jump right into your nose. Again i was surprised at how much of a juicy quality this one had, i was thinking it would be overly malted and sweet but rather the smell was incredibly west coast. Big juicy grapefruits and over ripe peaches but if you keep smelling you do get the big malt backbone and in the very end some of the alcohol. But honestly the thing smells amazing. I mainly smell simcoe, amarillo and cascade hops.  Taste - It falls a little flat in the taste, but not far. Bitterness right up front, juiciness in the middle and malts in the end. There is a lot of talk about this thing being too sweet and i am going to have to say that the people who say this are correct. However, i do like over the top beers and the sweetness and hop profile in this work really great. I would like to say they work great but it is just short of greatness. A very well rounded beer though. What blows my mind is that at 18% i dont taste barely any alcohol. you do feel it going down your throat though, very warm, but the taste is incredibly hidden. I get some warrior hops and more of those amarillos, some of my favorites. I am impressed.  Mouthfeel - This things drinks like a DIPA to me, well i guess technically that is what it is, but c'mon its 18%. It doesn't seam to coat the mouth as much as you would think and the bitterness doesn't stick around as much as i would hope but it is still very velvety and for the style perfectly carbonated.  Overall - I have been seeking this beer for years now but not enough to pay crazy prices for it. I walked into my local beer shop tonight and out of nowhere there were 3 bottles of this and i couldn't believe it, its not the type of store that would have it. It was also fresh i should mention. I bought three bottles in giddiness because DFH was the beer that got me into craft brews and ever since i have been looking for this. Well, 3 years down the line and with complete palate change i am still pretty impressed with this. Is it very sweet and malty? yes. Is it a hop heads dream? absolutely not. Is it a very good beer? in my opinion YES. i am very happy with this one.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

A - rich amber, 1/4 inch head, nice halo, lacing the whole drink S - smell uber sweetness, with a touch of hop bitterness. T - a little too sickenly sweet, teetering on barley wine' ish. M - almost feel the alcohol burn, almost. Not bad to hold in mouth, just feels ""better"" once I swallowed. O - a lil overhyped for the taste. Solid, just not the best beer.

10099,9086,ThreeWiseMen,4.41,"Wiseman Justin Reporting:  Found this randomly in Libertyville, IL at a bar called Firkin. Rock on Firkin.  Appearance - Pours a hazy light amber with a pinky sized head. Head fades into a sloppy ring around the glass with pretty large bubbles. Lacing is poor and head retention is equally poor.  Smell - Very strong, almost bitingly so. Hops on the nose for sure so we're in the right place. Wet evergreens; like walking through a forest of these trees after an intense rain. I get some grapefruit and maybe citrus in there too, but for the most part the hops take the spotlight. I love the smell and maybe I'm biased, if so deal with it.  Taste - Smoky, oaky, hoppy, and all around woody. This is not a hop bomb by any means and might be one of the first true ""sipping"" IPA's. I get some citrus in the aftertaste but again, for the most part, woody hops dominate the show.  Mouthfeel - Smooth/Slick; almost ""smokey"" mouthfeel. The mouthfeel is exactly what you would expect and even desire with a beer this big. Despite the high alcohol content something about it makes you want to swish this around in your mouth and experience everything you can, while you can.  Overall: It's most damning quality is what makes it a masterpiece. This beer is a very mature and deceptively aggressive IPA. It's much like a porcupine in sheep's clothing. You complain that it's too soft and when you pull your hand back it's bleeding all over the place. This beer cannot be drunken quickly. Some other 18% beers you can, if you wanted to, drink fast with the consequence being you get drunk and you don't enjoy the beer (Black Tuesday, World Wide Stout come to mind). Not this beer. Something about it's very nature forces you to slow down and enjoy the ride. Again a very balanced and very mature IPA; one that would pair very well with a cigar of the finest quality. Enjoy the good life with 120 minute from Dogfishhead and your favorite cigar.  By the way, I thought this beer was 10% alcohol while I was drinking it. Just an assumption. It might explain why I was having such a hard time drinking it with more haste. I'm not in college anymore. Despite missing a perfect score in every area it's still an exceptional beer. Truly a remarkable accomplishment considering the ABV.  EDIT (12-19-2011): Wiseman Nick does not endorse Wiseman Justin's review. DFH 120 Minute is a terrible, syrupy mess of a beer. Wiseman Justin is a blithering idiot, but a wiseman nonetheless. See you soon friend.  EDIT (4-21-2012): Wiseman Justin reflects upon this beer and grossly disagree's with Wiseman Nick. Any number of variables could have polluted Wiseman Nick's 120 minute and therefore both Wisemen would and could be right without having to resort to ""non-Wiseman"" behavior (such as name calling).

10099,9086,kgotcher,3.83,"pours an ominouosly hazy copper color. Thin white head. Aroma is strong, even from a couple of feet away I can smell this beer. Alcohol warming, strong malts, big hops, there are layers of aroma, from dark sweet fruit to pine. Earthy and strong.  Taste is very sweet and warming from alcohol. Malt is cloying with prune flavor. Foresty pine notes from hops.  Mouthfeel is very slick, syrupy and alcoholic. Finish has a good tartness from hops but leaves a very malty aftertaste of caramels and alcohol. Reminds me of a port wine.  I really don't know where to put this one. Definately complex and great but not really a daily drinker. I get why it is so famous but not sure I would have more than one of these a year at the most. This is not an imperial IPA, Ive had plenty of those and can not really compare those to this.

T: Malty sweet presence up front with warmth of alcohol overtaking hops. Underwhelming bitterness, perhaps because of the 18% ABV! M: Warm and boozy with syrupy feel. Mild carbonation.

M: Thick, sludge like almost, gritty on the palate  O: I will not be buying this beer again, not even at a fraction of the price point. I much prefer the 90 minute to this, and even more so the 60 minute to the 90 minute.  The beer is an interesting experiment, but seems wildly off balance. The alcohol level seems forced and while a boat load of hops were used, they don't pair with the malt profile in a way that pleases this palate.

10099,9086,HopSlap72,3.21,"i had waited a long time to try the infamous Dogfish Head 120 minute IPA. The bottle claims that it is, "" The Holy Grail for Hop Heads,"" but it failed to hit its mark.  The aroma came off very sweet but did not mask the large alcohol smell. Think of sherry, or cognac.  The alcohol was more prevalent in the taste than in the smell. The hop characteristic that i was expecting was no where to be found.  The mouth feel for the 120 was very odd. It started off very syrupy, then as you sat to ponder the taste had a drying effect on your tongue. It seemed as if the alcohol was going to deplete the moisture in your mouth.  Overall I am a little disappointed with my first 120 experience. I would like to get a hold of a few more bottles for cellaring purposes. In the end i still take my hat off to the dogfish head brewery and commend them for their courageous exploration in the world of craft brewing.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Rifugium,4.25,"First had: bottle from Eulogy (secret stash), Philly, PA  I've now had the '08 vintage bottle (April '11), the '11 batch on tap, and a sample from an '03 bottle (Oct. '11). Thanks to Brewerdan for the latter.  *The following review applies to the '03 bottle. The on tap batch, and the '08 were similar to each other and I wrote a separate review for them. The '03 was almost like a different beer altogether.  This was an entirely different monster than I expected, after having the '11 batch, and recollecting the '08 from a few months ago. I don't know if the beer was tamer back then, or if it just mellowed out a lot over the past 8 years. Poured a slightly hazed orange-amber, noticeably lighter than the Raison D'Extra sitting next to it. Slight patchy layer of white head. Aroma of oak, leafy hops, and sugar. I prepared myself for the strong-tasting quaff I've experienced before, but my eyes lit up when I took my first sip of the '03 vintage. Very mellow and flavorful. Instead of being right in your face like newer batches, the alcohol punch took a back seat to a creamy lemony hoppiness overlaid on sweet caramel malts. Notes of pine and butterscotch too. Wow...I liked the other batches, but this was...drinkable! Smooth mouthfeel, a little heavier than medium-bodied.  If this batch has been brewed consistently the same with no change to the recipe, then I can safely say: it take 8 years [minimum] for this beer to evolve to its perfect state.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,psuKinger,3.82,"Had on draft at 6-and-Save in New Kensington, left over from their Halloween party the night before. Review written from notes/memory the day before. What a treat.  A: Pours a hazy golden yellow color. Not a lot of head on the pour, but what was their did cling to the glass for a bit.  S: Huge notes of Malt Sweetness and earthy pine tones.  T: Big big flavors of both malt sweetness and booziness. The 18% is not hidden, nor would I have expected it to be. A moderate amount of earthy pine flavors from the hops, and a moderate amount of hop bitterness on the back end. Hops are far from overwhelming here, as is typical for Dogfish.  This beer reminds me far more of a big, fresh Barleywine than it does an IPA. The huge sweetness and readily detectible booziness is enjoyable, but doesn't seem ""to style"" for me.  M: Lots of thick stickiness here left in the mouth. I would have enjoyed more hops on the finish, and carbonation could have been a touch higher for my liking, but all in all pretty solid.  D/O: A fun, enjoyable beer that I would certainly repeat if I found it again. However, if for no other reason than for the sake of my sobriety, I'd probably not opt to have two back-to-back.

10099,9086,BeerFiend2002,3.65,"Im a big fan of imperial beers (stouts, pumpkins and IPAs), but have never had a beer anywhere close to the 18% ABV Im about to experience...lets get to it.  Poured from bottle into pint glass  A- Pours a hazy amber orange color. Surprisingly, I did get one finger of soapy off-white head, with a lot of the higher ABV beers producing less of one. Little bit of carbonation, with small bubbles rising slowly.  S- Smell the alcohol a little. Picking up notes of pine and pungent grapefruit.  T- This is a BIG beer. I get alcohol notes of caramel, faint honey, some pine, and an earthy grapefruitiness followed with a bitterness from the hops and a little burn from the alcohol that gives it an almost rum-like quality. You definitely get a warming effect from the alcohol.  M- Huge mouthfeel. Big, thick, full-bodied brew. Its has a thick, syrupy type of character, but not too sticky or resinous.  O- This is a pretty good novelty beer and something that I would only suggest to experienced drinkers of imperial craft brews. Not a practical every day beer. Im not a huge fan of these types of IPAs, as I gravitate toward the crisp West Coast style IPAs. However, considering its 18% ABV, its crafted pretty well. Very pricey though, only by a single.

S: Very sweet + boozy, but with some nice sherry notes on top of the pure brown sugar + ethanol. Maybe a hint of bitter hops aroma, too (the first time I've ever noticed hops in this beer at all). It's better than I expected, but still pretty one-dimensional.  T: Caramel + brown sugar up front. Solventy alcohol in the middle. Bitter grapefruit hops on the finish. Sweetness carries through on the aftertaste. I like that I can actually sense the hops, but it's nevertheless a crazy, overdone gimmick if you ask me.  M: Thick, sticky and full of creamy carbonation. Could be any better for what it is.  O: I've never been the biggest fan of the big DFH beers - while I enjoy them in their silliness, I find that they all taste 90% alike. This must have been a very fresh keg, as for once I could actually tell that 120 was brewed with hops.

(10-24-2011)  When we first opened the bottle of awesome, we smelled the cap, and that alone took you to the Happy place that you can visualize via Happy Gilmore.  So we busted out the fancy glasses as to allow the pouring of the beer to be an experience of euphoria as we watched the liquid golden honey poor into and fill the bottom one half of the brandy snifter.  Then we let it set for a few moments, mainly because we had to take pictures.  After that was the tasting. The smell had a strong hold on the senses, you could feel it in your toes, then the taste was a slightly mellowed version of the smell.  The color was a beautiful deep amber and it still had a pop rock fizzy while in your mouth with a repeat of the strong smell that you can experience again in the after taste.

Super sweet which helps to mask the 18% abv, but just barely. Honestly though it tastes like alcoholic raisins. Not something I would buy but I'm glad I tasted it.

The smell is an explosion of sweet fruit and caramel - definite pineapple and mango that mingles with the sweet caramel as I swirl my glass. Flavor - wow, this is just as intense as I anticipated - sweet citrus fruits mingle with bold caramel syrup-like attributes, leaves a flavor on the back of my tongue reminiscent of pineapple juice (the concentrated kind) - all is follow by a huge sweet caramel sugary malt backbone and definite booziness. The booze doesn't necessarily burn but there is a hint of a tingling feeling that coats my mouth letting me know that the alcohol is there.

10099,9086,turnstile,4.03,"Bottled on 7.22.2011; split between two tulips.  Pours a deep amber with a bubbly, off-white head. Excellent lacing.  Aroma is boozy, sweet, and complex. Starts out sweet and quickly delivers a powerful hoppy aroma to the nose, followed by a burning alcohol character. Plenty of ripe fruits in the nose - pineapple dominates. Aroma becomes slightly medicinal as the brew warms.  Taste is warm and sweet; pineapple follows through and brightens the palate. A bit of heat and peppery spice follow and linger in the finish.  Full-bodied and creamy with moderate carbonation. Finishes sweet and slick/syrupy on the tongue. Really coats the mouth and lets the complex flavors linger. Though the extreme ABV is well (and I guess as best they could), it can only be described as intense. Far more drinkable than I imagined.

Also get some light fruity notes in there as well, like apricots or something  M: On the fuller end of medium bodied with little carbonation. Fairly sugary, but nothing too cloying  O: What I expected for the most part. Obviously a sipper, and it has some very nice flavors asides from just booze. Probably the only beer I've had with over 100 IBU's that I wouldn't say is bitter. Gotta love extreme beers!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,bornridiculous,3.85,"Bottle poured into a Chimay Goblet. The beer pours a copper color with a quickly dispersing head. Beer is slightly cloudy but enough only to barely notice. I am surprised honestly at how bitter this beer is but with only how lightly the scent of hops emanates from it. If I had smelled this not knowing what it was, it could be a normal pale ale. Taking a sip however immediately changes your taste buds. There is a lot of malt, backed by a generous hop flavors, and a sweet finish. This is a completely different style of DIPA from say a Stone Ruination. I would say there is almost an element of a Barleywine in this brew. The ABV of 18% is not too severe on the palate, and this bottle is a 2011 release. The beer gets more fragrant, complex, and flavorful as the beer warms into the low 60 degree F range. It will warm on you too, as the abv and the sheer style of the beer makes this a sipper, rather than a session beer. I had to keep readjusting the smell score as it kept changing as the beer warmed. My final thoughts: I like this beer, is it something I would pay to have on a regular basis? No, not even if I could, as in CT this is rather a PITA to find. But it is an enjoyable treat that is definitely different than many of the throw as many hops in as possible style DIPA's.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,cps98,3.06,"Bought 2 bottles and decided to drink one this evening. My hope is to age the second one and see if the alcohol mellows itself out.  A – Poured into a pint glass with a single finger head. Head is a nice creamy color. Beer itself is a hazy light orangish in color.  S – Citrus notes, not as hoppy as I would think for a DIPA the smell of alcohol is very present.  T – Pine and lemon were first followed by the warmth of the alcohol.  M – I didn’t feel this was a very smooth beer because of the heavy alcohol although the carbonation was about perfect.  O – Alcohol was overpowering for me. A decent beer but far from my favorite DIPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,bylerteck,3.53,"Bottle from Potsdam IGA. Split with a friend.  A - Hazy dark gold. One finger of thick white head. Strong carbonation streaming up the glass. Tons of boozy legs when swirled, no lace but a film of retention.  S - Tons of pineapple, booze, glazed pineapple and cherry, sweet smelling.  T - A huge hop profile that doesn't quite balance with the huge alcohol. All the elements of booze, hops, and sweet malt seem to balance though. Lot's of pineapple from the hops and a very sweet note from the malt, almost too sweet. A strong alcohol element is there too.  M - Not bitter in any sense of the term when the alcoholic finish comes through. Fairly well carbonated. Big syrupy body.  O/D - Odd. A very boozy, sweet, and hoppy beer. Probably needs more hops. An extreme beer in every sense of the term. Nice. I was happy to try it but didn't exactly enjoy it as a DIPA. Extremely drinkable and smooth. A solid beer, but too boozy for me.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Good amountbalance of lacing.Aroma is very boozy with some dark fruits and citrus hops. The taste is a big amount of hops and booze. Dark fruits as well as a similar taste to WWS and Olde School. More reminiscent of Olde School than WWS. Not alot of carbonation. Boozey and somewhat bitter near the end with a bit of a raisins. This is the freshest I have had this and I thought the aged ones tasted like someone dropped a shot of vodka into a 90min. Fresh, however, this beer has more of a different taste to it. Almost like a boozier, hoppier version of Olde School, but not as good. Overall, pricey for what it is, but worth having every so often.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,ShanePB,4.08,"Bottle dated July 11, 2011. Split between my girlfriend and I, served in two snifters.  A: Golden sunset ruby colored body, fairly cloudy topped with just slightly off-white sudsy and creamy head. Retention ring is left behind with nice splotchy and sticky lacing on the walls. Gorgeous looking beer.  S: Extremely sweet hop oils and caramel malts. There's not much bitterness, instead simply very rich and again sweet aromas. Touches of orange peel towards the back end.  T: A sweet and sugary bomb while still retaining a certain balance to it (as much as you theoretically could anyway). Loads of citrus hop oils, slightly bitter, sweet caramel malts. This is a big beer and certainly one to anticipate being sweet. The fresher the more bitterness but even at only a few months old this is getting sweeter by the day.  M: Creamy, full bodied with decent carbonation. A bit syrupy on the tongue but it leaves a nice residual sweetness and stick behind. Lovely.  There are so many dimensions to this beer, you really have to be able to sit with this, sip it and let it warm to appreciate how much depth of flavor this has. It's certainly is going to be a polarizing beer due to its aggressive nature, but well crafted this one is. Nicely done, I'm stocking up on some to age.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Hops are more present in smell than taste. Strong grape taste (grape flavor reminds me of muscat in Midas Touch)  M-strong alcohol flavor (although considering ABV it is within reason). Medium carbonation.  I like this one more than the sum of its parts. I couldn't imagine drinking more than one a night, but it would be a very enjoyable night.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,STKPICR0720,4.55,WOW this beer was impressive. I traded for this brew and was kinda intimidated by this beer. I was afraid the brew would not live up too what I had come to expect. Oh but it did live up to a lot. I poured this brew into a tulip. it poured a lite orange hue. I honestly smelled a high dose of alcohol and a little sweetness of honey. It drank a lot easier than I ever imagined. So smooth for the high abv but this brew is awesome and should be sought out. love this brew and cannot wait on the next batch.  Cheers,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,GarrettMD,4.43,"A - Pours a light amber, completely clear with a constant cascade of tiny carbonation bubbles. 1 finger off white head that stays around for quite a while.  S - Fairly well balanced on the aroma. No noticeable alcohol, but the caramel malts and earthy hops balance out perfectly. Pine, orange citrus, hints of lemon, and just general hop bitterness followed up with sweet caramel.  T - Same balance in the nose with some added characters. The caramel malts still balance perfectly with the hops creating a beer that is in no way too hop-dominant. Still, earthy hops dominate the hop flavor, coming in next is the general bitterness with the citrus hops chilling in the background. Alcohol is definitely noticeable in the taste, but not to a detriment. It is there right for the initial hit on your tongue, but that's just it. It doesn't show itself again anywhere in the beer, except maybe at the tail end of the finish.  M - Medium bodied, super sticky. Just as with most IPAs I enjoy, the sticky malts help the hop flavors and bitterness to cling to the inside of your mouth forever. Finish is sticky sweet with mostly caramel flavor and hints of citrus hops with general bitterness.  O - I have been waiting to get my hands on this beer for a while now. It has lived up to expectations. While it isn't the best example of an IPA I have had, it does an amazing job to balance itself and the alcohol for the ABV it contains.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,silver7447,3.87,"Just a heads up... Drinking this beer in one sitting is equivalent to eating an entire loaf of bread. It took me just short of an hour to polish it off (not that it wasn't an hour well spent).  A- This transluscent beer has a golden amber color, with little lacing to speak of, and slight (one fingers-width) head.  S- Very sweet floral and fruity aroma with molasses notes. The characteristic hoppy bitterness is almost undetectable in the smell. But I assure you that the alcohol is quite present.  T- The sweetness almost overwhelms the taste, containing intense hops and lingering malts. The strong alcoholic content is quite apparent in the taste, along with nuttiness and fermented fruit.  M- The hoppy bitterness of this beer is downplayed by the sweetness which almost makes you pucker up when taking your first sip. There is a sharp alcoholic sensation in the front and back of each sip as it travels through your mouth and down your throat.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Smakawhat,4.33,"Wow, it has been a long road you and me mister 120. This was the first beer I ever reviewed on BA, and boy was that some time ago. Man how things have changed... for all of us!  Poured on tap into a snifter glass at Pizza Paradiso Dupont DC.  A really nice off white, off caramel colored head with tiny bubbles presenting a creamy like appearance. A real glowing orb of cloudy orange and light amber. As the beer settles it becomes clear showing off it's great orange transparency.  Nose is a distinct and real interesting unique flavor. It is without question, salted caramels. Slight hints of sweetness, no hop presence but like the smell of perfect French sea salted caramel.  Taste is mild sugar hopped citrus orange and some grapefruit, but mostly a great sweet tangerine citrus sweetness. Caramel like malts come to match the nose profile. Texture is big and bold but surprisingly not syrupy, not even boozy for such a high abv, but gives just a hint of sharp and very quick disappearing pine stinging hop with minor alcohol on the finish.  Overall surprisingly impressive. Not that hoppy really but also not as sweet as I remember it. The salted caramel angle is real nice and I certainly don't remember that at all. And for a whopping eighteen abv, I honestly could hardly tell. I've had 13-11-10 percent barleywines that just flat out knocked me out, this... like drinking a charm. Fantastic. Perhaps a re-review of the bottle should be in the cards.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Dope,4.07,"Very fresh 2011 batch.  A: A cloudy reddish amber pour. Small off-white head. Retention is okay and lacing is good.  S: Super super sweet tropical fruits and citrus primarily - almost like fruity candy. Some raisins too. Lots of brown sugar. Stinging alcohol. Maybe a touch of honey? Very strong.  T: Big alcohol bite up front and then the super sweet malt kicks in. Tons of brown sugar, caramel and raisin. Honestly not as hot as I expected for a fresh 18% beer. The ridiculous sweetness really tries its best to hide it. Impressive. This basically tastes like a really big american barleywine. There are hops but it's not any hoppier than bigfoot considering how badly they are drowned out by the malt.  M: Syrup thick. Constant tingle from all the alcohol. Neither is unexpected but this is BIG!  O: A fun experiment for sure. Good dessert beer, it is as sweet as a huge imperial stout. It hits hard for sure, sip on this bad boy! Deceptive alcohol despite the huge ABV.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Retail1LO,2.96,"Half bottle served into a lowball. Split the bottle with a buddy. Man, this most certainly must be an acquired taste. Pours a translucent gold with a thin head. This smells more like hard liquor than beer. The booze is so forward. It comes off more as brandy than beer. I don't smell hops at all. The taste is ultra sweet. Again, very boozy. This is like...a liqueur. The mouthfeel is very syrupy. This is thick as sin. Again, it's more like a cordial. Ironically, this has more burn to it than liquors of the same ABV. Craziness.

10099,9086,CaptDavyJones,4.13,"Poured a clear copper color into a oversized brandy snifter from a 12 oz bottle, from a slightly less than a month old bottle with no ABV marked anywhere. Nice one finger foamy white colored head that dissipated quickly. Surprisingly big head for such a big beer. Steady carbonation, little bubbles rising constantly from the center of the glass. Sweet fruity candy like aroma with noticeable alcohol in the nose. The alcohol is easily noticeable as it condenses down the insides of the oversized glass. Alcohol is also noticeable from the very first sip. Warming alcohol effect with each sip. The malt with subtle sweetness was evident in the first few sips. Felt like this ale had a big malt backbone, but as the beer warmed up, the hops made their presence felt. Nice linger bitterness in the finish, which is not overpowering, just enough to remind you this is a big, big, DIPA. Mouthfeel is slightly oily and not much lace either. For how big this beer, it is surprisingly nicely balanced. Hats off to DFH for pulling off such a big yet balanced DIPA. A must try for every beer lover, a beer that one should have at least once in your lifetime. Worth investing in two bottles, one for fresh tasting and one for aging.

10099,9086,MicroBeerMan1980,4.32,"Had this beer at Al's of Hampden (Enola, PA) on 10-15-11.  A: White frothy head with good retention sits on a bright golden honey colored ale. The head stays around for a while and clings to the glass.  S: Pungently sweet malts mixed with undeniable citrus/orange zest hops blast through on the nose. Candied citrus and sweet leathery malts. It almost smells syrupy.  T: Layers upon layers of candied malts and citrus hops. The malts seem to be a 1000lb. weight in this beer. Just when you've extracted one layer, its cousin pops up. Then, you're toiling with the complexity of the hops, which tend to be a little over shadowed by the monster malt bomb.  M: Large, heavy and strong. This beer is like a malt steamroller in your mouth. It's size and profile dictates a beer that should be tacky and palate burning, but surprisingly it isn't. Then again, the 18%abv could have been catching up to me.  D: Definitely a once-in-a-while sipping beer.

For 18% at least it's carbonated.  s) smells like a sugary hop menagerie. For the age the hops have held up well, however the table sugar sweetness is almost overpowering compared to the hops. Somewhere hidden in there is some light citrus zest.  t) tastes much like I expected it to, sugary and sweet. Not very bitter, more like a simple syrup than anything. A bit of the citrus fruits come through, but the sweetness is cloying and overdone. I couldn't pick up any alcohol, which is very impressive. That is the only reason I rated this 2.5 instead of 1.5.  m) slick and oily with low carbonation. Not hot at all for 18%, as stated before. Best quality of the beer.  o) overall, just a sweet, sugary beer. Brings under attenuation to a whole new level for me.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Hojaminbag,2.75,"I'm surprised that I have never written a review for this beer, as I have had a love hate relationship with it for a long time, beginning when I first became interested in beer.  DFH 120 Minute IPA has a dark orange body that is almost opaque from all of the haze in it. The head is small, tan, and pretty solid looking. Although the retention is fairly good, there really isn't much lacing.  The aroma has a lot of everything. There is a strong scent of hops, with pine and grapefruit taking the forefront, but there is just a ton of malt sweetness also, with caramel being the most powerful aroma.  This thing is such a huge booze bomb. No matter how many times I try it, that is the conclusion that I come to. Hints of grapefruit and pine combine with some sweet malt and a huge honey-like taste. Mostly, there is a generic sweetness and ton of alcohol. It isn't even especially hot, but it has a strong alcohol flavor. It does remind me a little bit of 90 minute, which I do like, but I can't seem to enjoy it.  Big and mean.  120 is an interesting beer, but it is just too boozy for me. I have tried it quite a few times now, and I just cannot seem to get past all of the alcohol.

And suddenly was an extra $4 a bottle... maybe Sam planned this whole thing out. Anyway, poured this into my chimay chalice, obviously a 2011 batch.  A: Dark red amber color, a lot clearer than I remember the 08 batch being, with a minimal off-white head forming a ring around the glass. Looks thick, like mead.  S: Honey, alcohol, sweet and citrusy fruit, floral hops, there is definitely a malt presence, but there is so much sugary alcohol sweetness drowning it out.  T: Extremely balanced hop and malt blend up front. sweet malts mixing with citrus hops, fading into a sweet and warming alcohol finish. lingering sticky candy/sugar, pine hop and raisin aftertaste.  M: Heavy, syrupy mouthfeel, medium carbonation; it's a real sipper, quite warming.  O: Although I never wrote a review on the 2008 batch (the last time I had this beer) I'll do my best to compare the two:  The 2011 I found to be much sweeter, yet much easier to drink. The 2008 was REALLY overwhelmingly hoppy; like it almost hurt on the first sip. Obviously the 2011 is hoppy enough that my taste buds are a bit destroyed for the next beer or two, but it was definitely easier to put down.

Bubbles form toward the top and flaot very slowly upward. Some super thick stuff here.  Similar hop profile to 90 minute - herbal and cocoa flavors.

Definitely can smell the alcohol. Very sweet taste and thick mouthfeel with almost no carbonation. Alcoholic taste is strong at end but still drinkable. Lots of stuff going on in taste.

10099,9086,jtierney89,5,"Don't ask me how, but I got a 4 pack of this stuff for $10! Just cracked open the first bottle and poured it into a snifter. I'm already excited. Right away I could smell some good stuff coming from this. Lots of citric and floral hops. Smells like a bouquet, lots of tropical fruits. As I let it sit out for a bit, the alcohol presence kind of makes itself known on the back of the notes. The beer pours a beautiful hazy amber with a decently sized creamy head that lingered for a while. Now its time to sip.  Lots of flavors. Hard to pin point them all on this first sip. Balanced is surprisingly better than I expected considering the high degree of gravity this beers boiled at. You can tell there's a ton of hop presence through taste and even slightly on the swallow.  Up front it's very syrupy almost orange marmalade like with some pineapple and even apricots. Very thick in the middle, slightly warming like cough syrup on the swallow but not too bad. The mouthfeel is very very thick with slight carbonation but again, more carbonation than I expected. Getting some pineapple taste on the swallow as well.  The sweetness builds, definitely a sipper but unlike most sweet beers it doesnt have that terrible raisin aftertaste lingering around. A lot of citric and piny hops on the swallow that can be detected taste wise. You can sense the tiniest bit of bitterness but not much, however I do wish there was more.  What do I have to say about this big beer after all is said and done? I like it a lot. More than I thought I would. On the sweet side but better balance than you'd expect. I'd like to try and age some of these but I doubt they'll last that long. Also another plus about this beer is it's a quick and easy buzz in a bottle. I tried to identify more flavors half way through the bottle but i'm afraid my tastebuds already took the day off! enjoy!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Tiny ring on edges with no lace at all.  S- Like a Barleywine and IIPA. Hoppy but also has a huge caramel malt presence. Hops are both citrus and herbal to me. Just a bit of solvent alcohol, like a spirit.  T- Hmmmm...Hops die down here a lot to me. Mostly like what an 17+ % ale would taste like, big caramel, raisin and oxidation. Hops are just a bit herbal and pine to me. Alcohol obviously comes into play. Very sweet.  MF- Nice level of lower silky carbonation in an oily substantial body. HOT from alcohol.

Aroma is very fruity, citrusy, and hoppy. Smells sexy but I don't expect the flavor to be as good.  Fruity, malty, sweet, bitter and hoppy... all in excess. The malty sweet aspect is what annoys me the most. The hoppiness however is fine by me. I get pineapple, orange, and honey. I also taste some vanilla. Very warming in the tummy with a smooth thick, creamy mouthfeel. A little too thick for the style, but it still works.  Good to try once or twice a year, but this is really quite sweet. I don't really dig hoppy dessert beers. The alcohol is smooth and not to be feared, but the malty sweetness is just overbearing. The flavor needs to be worked on hard. In that regard, sometimes less is more. This is toooo over the top. Probably finishes close to 1.040 FG.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Continued to bubble for a good ten minutes despite that fact that it was poured in a Sam Adams Perfect Pint glass with no rough marks or chips to induce bubbling. First taste is a strong IPA, not my favorite style in general but it’s very hoppy and has a nice bitter taste to it. Defiantly some pine flavors and I can smell and taste the hops. Then the alcohol hits and burns the back of my mouth.

Retention is understandably short livid, but some lace and a ring is left behind.  Smell: Oh My are the first thoughts. Alcohol and fresh smelling hops, notes of caramel, almost like an Eisbock. Lots of alcoholic esters are playing with an underlying sweetness, bringing to my senses aromas I never knew existed.  Taste: Big malt sweetness, piney hops stuggle to take hold. Alcohol is quite present, and the brew tastes eerily similar to some examples of the Eisbock style, where a portion of the beer is frozen to concentrate the flavors (and ABV). Mild pineapple notes are present as well, as is some erratic ale fruityness. Sugary malt and booze sticking to the back of the throat. Wood tones are also present, perhaps from the hops or is this wood aged? A symphony of flavors, if everyone in the symphony was drunk.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied, lightly carbonated, alittle syrupy with lots of warming booze.  Overall: This is extreme beer. It is good but must be prepared for. When finished, where does one go? Wherever that is, you will find me there.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

It pours a slightly murky orange-straw-amber topped by a finger of bright cream foam. The nose comprises heavy pine resin, mentholated honeydew, rich caramel, and a hardy backbone of alcohol. The taste brings in much of the same, with everything taken to the nth degree. Honestly, it's all a bit much when put together like this. The body is a heavy-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a nearly chewy, syrupy feel. Overall, what could have been a decent DIPA is hindered by what I can only call too much girth and presence.

Mouthfeel: Pretty smooth, explosive finish. Sweetness lingers for a long time. Nice alcohol warming but very little alcohol taste.

10099,9086,gigaknight,3.5,"A- Poured into a 6oz pilsner-style sampler glass, showing a hazy straw-yellow complexion with a glint of green around the edges. A low bit of fizzy eggshell head that dissipates like a sparkling wine. Otherwise, not a lot of visible carbonation.  S- Aroma carries ample amounts of dried drupe fruits (mostly apricot) and a bit of tart red apple skin. There seems to be a whiff of musky grape character, not unlike a riesling. There's really almost no indication of the extremely high alcohol content in the nose at this temperature, but perhaps that will change.  T- A rush of mouth-wateringly sweet dried/candied fruit opens up the palate, followed by passing notes of German dessert wine and floral booziness. The sweetness is thick enough to hide much of the alcohol (or at least relegate it to a painless flash of warmth), and I am unsure as to whether or not I like it that way. I really don't taste much hop character here at all... I'm sure three months on the shelf rolled off a portion of the hop character but I have trouble believing that it was ever all that much hoppier than this. If there is any bitterness at all here, it is unfortunately lost to the overwhelming white raisin-y dextrins that dominate this beer. Fortunately, the saccharine overload is relatively brief, and a very pleasant dry sweetness of apple rind finishes off the palate.  M- The mouthfeel is quite thick, though surprisingly dry for the amount of sugar present. As mentioned before, the carbonation is adequate in moving the palate along and bringing about a pleasant finish, but the beer also retains a reasonable amount of 'chew' for those of us treating this vino-typical brew as a wine.  O- I'm glad to have had the opportunity to snag a few of these just to see what the fuss was about, but I don't think this was the beer for me. A very interesting piece of work to sip on, but the flavors here were just too out of balance and overpoweringly sweet to be able to enjoy any more than 6oz or so of this at a time. I understand how difficult it must be to tame a beast of this high alcohol content while juggling the unusual technique of 120 minutes of hopping during a boil, but the impressiveness of the feat doesn't quite make up for the lack of finesse that the brew carries.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Taste is BITTER - and bitter is better. Mouthfeel is good too - for a beer that's 18%. Overall, a very good sipper.

Some white foam. Even the smell is subdued. Little pine, some malt, pretty empty.  The taste - whoa, what to say here.. Full on hop and alcohol assault, with forced cough syrup taste and mouthfeel. Is thick in my mouth, and quite heavy. It burns it burns.  I understand why this beer is brewed and why some might enjoy it, but I definitely did not. Found it to be virtually undrinkable.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Subtle nose...frankly, hardly anything there! Cleared my throat and blew my nose...still not much! If anything, I'm getting some rock candy sweetness...but this is interesting.  First sip...good lord. How massive, how sumptuous, how utterly balanced - how does Sam do it? The hop presence coats my mouth but the massive amount of malt eases everything in so much I don't notice the absurd ABV. Wow.  Huge body - comparable to a milkshake.  Here's the kicker - the finish sits everywhere. Top to mid to back palate all at the same time...I'm so impressed. It lingers for minutes, but not astringently...just sweet, balanced pineapple and tropical fruit with a huge dose of sugar.  Age it or not, this beer is one in a million. Odd how the nose doesn't stand out...but it absolutely melts in your mouth.

Up front I get earthy, piney hops and huge malt.  My first sip was surprisingly smooth... Then the alcohol hit me and I had to clear  my throat.  I guess you can't really hide this high of an ABV.  My lips are burning a little.  Mouthfeel is full-bodied and very oily from hops resin.  This is my first time having fresh 120 minute, and it'll be my last.

S - Very aromatic, I picked up strong hops of both a floral and citric nature.  T - Hops are dominant (not surprisingly) with strong citrus flavors. A bit of alcohol heat as well (not surprising nor detrimental). Maltyness in the background after the initial burst of hops.  M - Medium bodied, nice carbonation, and pleasant in the mouth but significant alcohol heat in the aftertaste.  O - The 120 Minute is a special and unique beer. It really tastes like an IPA/Barleywine hybrid. The extreme ABV is something to watch out for and causes a bit of boozy heat, but this beer still has great flavor and lives up to the hype.

S: So dense in its hop profile, that I actually got some caraway seeds on the nose. Not extremely potent, but DFH's profile is there. Don't get me wrong, this is also a malt bomb.

10099,9086,Phelps,3.88,"2011 vintage, enjoyed at AZ Wines, poured into what looks suspiciously like a 12-ounce glass. If so, I'm in for quite a night.  Dusty copper, very hazy. A thumb of frothy tan head is sticky as gum in summer, clinging to the sides in paint-thick walls.  Heavy, sugary nose. Grapefruit and orange peel, caramel, green apple, some biscuits, honey. I can tell it's sweet, but it's not as intense as I know it should be. Tricky tricky, aroma.  Bam! A sucker punch of flavor, like baked orange slices coated with sugar and torched with flame. Oranges flambé? That's what I get initially, anyway. Allow the stuff to stay in the mouth for a while and different flavors emerge — honey, toasted biscuits, white rum and floral notes among them. Something almost herbal, like basil, shows up from time to time. The finish is intensely sweet, yet toasty as well, almost like a burnt sugar cookie.  The body, as expected, is heavy and creamy, like swishing maple syrup. Moderate carbonation pinches the tongue while the alcohol adds enough heat to make you think you're drinking salsa. No getting around 18 percent ABV.  This batch of 120 Minute is the first released since Dogfish famously dumped an obscene number of gallons of the previous lot and tweaked the recipe. The adjustments paid off; this is way more drinkable and balanced than any previous iteration I’ve tried.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

At over 20% alcohol, it isn't going to be timid. Hops are mixed with honey and a little citrus. But the overall dominating factor is the sugary scent.  While many others said it was just too sweet and overpowering, I happened to really enjoy it. Yes, it's intense but it's meant to be sipped. It was a treat.

If this is what they consider their holy grail for hopheads, then they have seriously failed. It says it ages well, but I wouldn't recommend drinking one past 4 months old unless you wanna drink straight malt syrup, which is what it tasted like to me both times.

For some reason, with DFH the more hops the better which, to me, is like putting too much of any spice into a dish....there's a limit.  Now this beer does have its place. It's more of a liquor than a beer. At 18%abv it's something to be sipped. I actually prefer 6-8 ounces at a time as an after dinner beer. I have to say while it's hop infusion to the extreme, it's not as bitter as even some of the double ipas out there.

10099,9086,bobhits,4.34,"120  Pours a crystal clear, syrup thick, amazing golden color. I don't know what it is but this is amazing looking stuff. This is in the Utopias world, only with a touch of fizz on the top that doesn't last long. The clarity of this beer is beyond belief.  Nose of amazingly complex caramel malt, citrus hops, and dominant amounts of alcohol.  Port with hops? Hops with port? I'm not sure what this is, but it's tasty. I've had 120 before, at 22% and a year or two old the last time i had this, it was a beast of a barley wine. This is something all together different. The malt gives off an amazingly liquor like flavor. Giving off just layer upon layer of caramel sweetness. Attempting as best it can the hops give off a nice bite, tending toward the citrus vs floral side of the American hops, but they don't reach that point. Alcohol is nearly non existent and what alcohol is there is hidden in the hop bite.  This beer is sinfully drinkable. I really can't believe what I'm drinking. There is hardly any carbonation, heat, and even the syrup like thick look doesn't translate here. This beer is just way too drinkable, way too mellow, and simply put the best 13%+ abv beer I've seen yet.  This beer is often seen as a gimmick and I thought this about the beer to a degree in the past. This version is simply not what I've had before or age does this beer terrible injustices. If you like a THICK malty double IPA or you want an english barely wine malt profile with american hops give this beer a try. A truly amazing effort that justifies the two dumped out batches.

10099,9086,FreshHawk,4,"A - Blazing burnt orange color with a decent sized, smooth, creamy white head. Pretty good retention but almost no lace. Surprising given the ABV.  S - Sweet citrus and stone fruit. Caramel malt and some booziness. Pine hop aroma is also in there. Pretty fruity overall.  T - Like the aroma, there is a good amount of citrus, tropical and stone fruit. Mango, apricot, peach, grapefruit and orange all in there. A touch of booze on the finish but not much given the ABV. Caramel malt is also fairly strong. Much more sweet than bitter, but bitterness does come out.  M - Medium starting toward full body. Nice carbonation and has a smooth and slightly viscous feel.  D - Even with the ABV it isn't too boozy. It is a little on the sweet side though. That said, given what this beer is, it is very drinkable.  Notes: On tap at Beer Revolution. Not sure the year. It was surprisingly not too boozy. Having had 90 Minute, I knew this would be sweet and it definitely was. Nice beer with plenty of sweet hopiness, but there is a touch of bitterness.

10099,9086,Homebrew35,3.73,"2009 vintage. Pours a quarter fingers worth of creamy bubbly head. This as many have said dissipates to just about nothing, just a slight ring around the edge. Hazy deep orangy amber body.  Smells of sweet sticky juicy oranges soaked in spirits. Quite a bit of alcohol is mixed in with the carmel malt sugary smells.  Tastes quite complex. A mixture of carmel, orange, herbal, grassy, a hit of whisky or scotch. This was interesting to me. I was expecting a big boring alcohol burn, this was not the case. It's very smooth for 18%. Maybe if this was from a later vintage it would have been what I expected.  Mouthfeel is full. Very little carbonation. There is a hop bitterness that helps keep this one from being a one sided malt and alcohol bomb. This is very alcohol and malt forward.  Overall I'm quite pleased with this, is it worth the price, yes at $10, not at 18$ where I've seen it at other stores. Thank you Ian for this bottle.

Barely any carbonation that works well with this beer. The nose hints you with warm port/sherry booze right off the bat. Baking spices along with spiced apple pastry, rich oloroso sherry, currant and booze soaked raisins and a touch of figs as well. Very nice complex nose definitely more fortified wine than beer. The taste brings sweet barleywine like malts with enough alcohol to wash it away - i might be able to tell the abv is this high but it is so well balanced it never comes across as hot. Hops really arent perceptible at this age, there is almost some caramel as well as light red fruit and raisins.

Lots of candy sugar, caramel and toffee underneath, some booze, and bits of spices, wood and nuttiness..honey as well.  T: Tastes a little like a spiced rum or sweet liqueur. All of the components from the nose are here, combined with some sweet fruits like apricot and papaya mixed with honey and booze. The alcohol isn't as noticeable as the nose, though you still feel a slight burn on the way down.

10099,9086,Sky2625,3.11,"2011 vintage, 20% ABV. Poured from a 12 oz. bottle to a 8 oz. glass. (notes from 8/22/11):  A - Poured a golden orange with hints of amber. 1/2 finger of white small bubble head. Some retention and spotty lacing. Shines gold/orange when held up to the light.  S - Blast of intense alcohol mingled with grapefruit. The alcohol brings to mind a solvent or paint thinner, and it nearly blows over all the other hints here: apricot, melon, ripe banana.  T - Melony tangeriney sweet to start, with an acidy stab of pine hoppiness that crescendoes from nothing to prominence, and then lingers back down to nothing again, as moderate hop bitterness takes over with a MASSIVE booziness profile. Finishes tangy and sickly sweet. If you can black out (#pun) the intense alcohol flavor in your mind, you might find the flavors I mentioned.  M - Light to medium body, whilst both creamy and sticky. Moderate crisp tip of the tongue carbonation. Solvent nature of this clears the sinuses right out, and the alcohol burns lingeringly in the top of the throat.  D - To quote @distantmantra and his shock (but not awe) at the first taste: ""Holy Shit! This is roofie beer!"" Holy Shit indeed. The massive booziness of this Molotov-cocktail-sans-rag nearly wipes out any redeeming character I find here. There's plenty of novelty value...that's why I tried it. The melon and tangeriney sweet hoppy flavors started nice, but then it all went downhill into modeling glue.  Not like anything I've ever tried before...not detestable, but just kind of bizarrely intense. I'd try it again, but definitely only sips of it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,BlastBeats,4.4,"While thoroughly examining the impressive beer menu at the Sunset Grill & Tap in Boston, MA, I noticed it. Could it be? Yes, to my surprise, they had Dogfish Head's elusive 120 Minute IPA on tap.. and there was no way I could walk out of that establishment without having tried it.  Appearance: the lighting at the bar was dark, which limited my ability to fully assess it's appearance. However, it's color is dark orange with a thin head.  Smell: right away, you could detect the booziness in the nose. This smell of alcohol seemed to fuse with the remaining citrus scents.  Taste: wow; unlike any other beer I've ever had! This beer has more than enough sweetness to balance out the gargantuan 120 IBUs. The hops are front and center, yet somehow, they don't seem to overpower the rest of the beer. The finish really sets the 120 apart from other IPAs; there's a bitter and warming sensation from the 18% alcohol that lasts longer than any other beer I've had to date.  Mouthfeel: there is a density in the mouthfeel that really demonstrates how big this beer really is. Almost syrupy in nature.  Overall: Dogfish Head's 120 Minute IPA is a truly unique beer. Often labelled a ""sipper"", I found it difficult to put my glass down. A must try for anyone that considers themselves a hop-head.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,KickInTheChalice,4.64,"Served on tap in a snifter at Fountainhead.  Appearance: There is a warmness in the appearance. This pours an amber copper color with a lot of life. A small off-white foamy cap gently rests on top and then fades to a ring. This is dangerous, like a venus fly trap luring me in under a guise of beauty without disclosing there is danger ahead.  Smell: Crystalized raw sugar, caramelized grapefruit, toffee, brown sugar, and some sticky pine are all present in excess. Some nice bready malt aroma exists in the background.  Taste: This is somewhat syrupy and intense, which is not a surprise. Lots of sweet caramel malt with brown sugar, vanilla, and a touch of toffee. I take back every time I have ever said a beer tasted like caramelized grapefruit, because this changes my whole perspective. This is just dripping with caramel and grapefruit rind, taking the flavor from sweet to bitter with authority. Prickly pine and some dank herbal hops play in as well. There is nothing understated here.  Mouthfeel: There is no way this could be anything besides full bodied, but the ultra creamy carbonation is a great feature. Tingly, sticky, and sweet, this has a lot of kick.  Overall: This is the kind of power I look for in a DIPA. Delicious as well. I can see why some people will age this like a barleywine, but I will drink it fresh.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,distantmantra,2.21,"2011 vintage (20% ABV) bottle poured into flared pint glass.  A: The beer poured a golden yellow color with a very small head of creamy white foam. The beer was thick, and numerous strands of bubbles were racing to the surface. Heavy lacing clung to the sides of the glass.  S: My first thought upon putting my nose near the surface was ""this smells like an alcoholic grapefruit."" Along with the grapefruit, I get notes of apricot, caramel, paint thinner, Pine Sol and modeling glue. Wow, this is one combustible brew that I'm not very excited about drinking.  T: I felt like I was drinking carbonated Citron Vodka with a shot of melon liqueur, rubbing alcohol and Pine Sol. There is a trace of grapefruit, candied apricot and caramel in there, but it is completely drowned out by the sickly sweet taste and massive booziness.  M: Very low carbonation with a creamy but sickly sweet and sticky mouth feel. I honestly did not want to leave this in my mouth long enough to even figure out the mouth feel. The sharp flavors kill any redeeming quality to this beer. Lots of heat makes this simply horrendous.  O: My face was incredibly warm after drinking this, which is probably the most positive thing I have to say about the beer. There are flourishes of greatness hiding, but the alcohol really overpowers everything that is going on here. This is one whale that's not worth the effort to capture. I'm sure glad I didn't have to jump through any hoops to get my bottle other than walking into Whole Foods and finding it on the shelf. It's worth trying with a group of friends, but I feel that there is too much hype surrounding this at the moment. I can safely say that I never want to drink this ever again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,abeerlovr,3.75,"Shared a 12 oz bottle and poured into two snifters.  A: It was a golden yellow color, cloudy not much head but good lacing on the glass.  S: I detected a hint of pine hoppiness, sweet smelling.  T: It was a sweet beer, it had a malty honey flavor, with a hoppy finish, orange peel taste present, hints of citrus with the sweetness.  M: thick due to the sweetness of the beer, as the beer warmed it reminded me of a decent port wine.  Overall: It was a sweet, big beer that took a bit of time to drink 6 oz. As the beer warmed it reminded of a port wine, complex flavors, hoppy but with a honey, malt flavor and citrus on the back end. This is a beer I could drink every so often, a couple of year would be fine for me. I'll try aging a bottle and see how the flavors mellow.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Zodijackyl,5,"2011 vintage, courtesy of Gerard from Coalhouse Pizza in Stamford, CT (no they don't have any left)  Pours a dark gold/amber, amber in the middle, gold towards the edges. Not much head, just a bit of lacing around the edges. Aroma has sweet malt and yeast, almost like a barleywine, with a ton of hops. Lots of hops. While it certainly looks and smells great, they can't quite match the flavor of the beer.  The taste is massive. The malt is so thick that it feels like syrup, and the taste is so sweet that it is similar. The malt is extraordinarily strong and sweet, balancing out the massive quantity of hops. The hops are dense, they don't stand out as much as they might in lesser quantities, like the brewery's 60 and 90 minute IPAs, rather the whole beer stands as a massive, monolith of malt and hops. The malt is more prominent than any other IPAs that I have had, but the hops are so powerful that the sweetness seems necessary to balance out the bitterness. I don't really get a bitter flavor from the hops, rather the sweetness of the hops shines through.  The flavor is so thick and intense that it is difficult to describe in conventional terms or in comparison to other beers. It isn't the lone overload of hops that many other big IPAs are, but for a beer this strong, it is the monolith of flavor that it must be to have everything about it be this big. Bottom line is that it is really malt-heavy, but the overall flavor is just massive, malt and hops and yeast. The mouthfeel is extremely sweet, the aftertaste lasts a long time and it feels like the beer is still there minutes later.  This is an exceptional beer, perhaps the best I have ever had. For a flavor-intense style, nothing matches it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,jtingue,4.03,"2011 Vintage. Poured into a snifter.  Appearance. Gorgeous dark copper red in color. A finger of head dissipates to a beautiful layer with some awesome lacing around the glass. Alcohol legs are also present and linger for a while.  Smell. Very sweet and malty with aromas of dark sugars and some nice floral hop aroma.  Taste. A very sweet flavor similar to a homemade hard candy or the filling of pecan pie is up front. This slowly transitions into a very fruity, grape like flavor. There is also a lingering hop flavor that is a bit like mango or some other tropical fruit This is complemented by a very slight bitterness which lingers until the finish. The finish is slightly alcoholic but not really dry.  Mouthfeel. Pretty standard full bodied with light carbonation.  Very pleasently surprised by this one. Sweet, but balanced.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

It's a sweet and caramelized feel to it and goes down smooth. Little head, when poured into the snifter I was drinking from, but it had this note at the end of a sugary variety that just hit the palate perfectly. I was lucky to have it in a growler from the brewery and brought up to Philly for Philly Beer Week at $5 a glass (such a good price I had 2!), but I can't seem to get a hand on it anywhere else.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,aleckpa,4.01,"Bottled 2011. Poured into my DFH signature glass.  I was actually shocked by this beer. I read reviews, and watched beer reviews on YouTube before trying this, and I got mixed reviews. The bad reviews worried me. I went out of my way to get 4 bottles (and paid too much) so I was hoping to at least enjoy the beer!  Anyway, The smell of this beer was amazing. It smelled citrusy and sweet. I couldn't stop smelling it, even after I started drinking it. The taste was a little too sweet, but it wasn't unbearable. It was a little thick, and I wasn't used to that, but I still enjoyed it. I sipped on a 12 oz. bottle for over an hour, and I believe the flavors got better and tasted more complex as it warmed.  I have 3 bottles left, and I am definitely going to age them and save them for a special occasion(s). I'm assuming the sweetness will balance out.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

My first and only time trying the highly anticipated 120 and a dense and cloudy peach orange nectar color filled the glass with little to no head. A vast aroma of caramel, deep roasted sugar and fruit fills the nose. On the palate, a solid earthy sweet peach and orange nectar citrus taste invades the palate with a remarkably smooth and deceptive abv. Alcohol is instantly warming. Dry and sticky herbal exotic fruit sweetness in the finish leaves you wanting a next sip...Five 8 oz. servings after my first sip, I left the bar realizing that I had just had my ass whooped by the smoothest, suavest, nuclear hop bomb of my beer drinking life...",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

10099,9086,eclipse54,4.07,"An awesome trade item from a very generous trader, inlimbo77. Thank you very much Bill! The 12 ounce bottle was from the recent (2011) release, and this review is a transfer from my spreadsheet (as most of my others are, just mentioning here since the bottling date was a quite a while before I got around to posting this review).  Pours a dark rust, burnt orange like color with about a half inch of very frothy, foamy head. Retention is impressive for a brew with this kind of alcohol content. Lacing is wet and generous. Very appealing and inviting.  Smells of clove, rigorous hops with a mix of both fresh, citrus scent as well as an almost cooked or burnt hop smell that gives it a warm, spicy scent. Very unlike any IPA I’ve encountered thus far.  Tastes similar, with an almost ginger/cinammon spice laced between the citrusy hops and toasted hops. Perhaps there is a touch of a toasted caramel malt towards the rear, but it’s not distinct enough for me to say with certainty. If anything, it mixes with the other spicy notes that find their way onto the tongue. It does finish with a warm alcohol flavor, though not nearly what you would expect for an 18+% concoction.  Mouth is medium bodied, and perhaps slightly undercarbonated as of yet.  Overall, I’m very pleased I was able to this guy fresh, and forever grateful I was given a few extra to stock away for resampling down the road. Thanks again Bill, you’re awesome!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Cheesemoose,4.23,"Served into an 8oz chimay glass at the riverside European street.  Golden amber with a glowing nature to it's hue. Foamy white head with a good finger of head. When held to light it glows a reddish yellow. As the bubbles creep up, you get the sense that this beast is meant to savor.  Nose, though cold now, reveals an aggressive and astringent hop base. Spicy, with toasted edges, the malt body is what shines though. Honey, vanilla, and a bit of nuts come mind.  As idly warms, more vanilla and caramel. ABV also makes it's presence known, increasing the spicy edges. Grassy notes? Intriguing.  Wow. This is one dangerously delicious beer. The malt/sweet base is what is dominant, though the aggressive hopping tries to make a presence. Rather sweet. Honey, vanilla and bourbon (aided by the alcohol burn) make an impression. Citrusy finish with a cloying sweetness that reminds me more of a fortified wine than an IPA. Roasted, toasted with an edge of caramel and toffee.  Mild carbonation, and with this abv I can see why. Not as syrupy as you would think, but lingers a bit. Alcohol makes a strong presence, but to be expected.  All around, a great beer. Well made and with purpose. Could do with some age but fresh it is still amazing.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,rowingbrewer,2.31,Well I had this beer on tap at the hipness throw down and I can honestly say I don't plan on trying it again. To start off I am not sure of the vintage. This beer poured an orange with a reddish tinge. The beer is visibly thick and had a small off white head a veery small head. The smell was dominated by sweetness that I knew was not going to make th beer taste good. There was also a hop presence but I took a back seat to the sweetbread and huge alcohol presence. The flavor follows the taste to a tee. Huge sweetness wiu minimal hops followed by a donkey punch of alcohol burning. The mouthfeel is so out of wack for an ipa it's more like q barley wine.

10099,9086,draheim,3.71,"12oz bottle (bottled 2011 1061) poured into a snifter. Coppery orange amber color with minimal head but vigorous carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass. This beer looks great.  Aroma is dank water (same aroma/taste I always pick up in 90 Minute) and sweet malt. I'm not really getting many discernible aromas, maybe buttery rum?  First sip is sugary sweet with more than a hint of booze. I'm not much into liqueurs, but I'd compare this to a carbonated sherry, brandy or cognac maybe. The abundant hops still manage to give it a somewhat dry finish and the mouthfeel is OK, actually pretty velvety. Getting a little more syrupy as it warms. In fact, as it comes up to room temp I find myself wincing with every sip. Like taking cough syrup. Accordingly, I have to knock the taste score down by half a point.  To me this tastes/feels more like a dessert wine or liqueur than a beer. For what it is I actually kind of like it, but I wouldn't want to drink it very often even if I could.

10099,9086,orangesol,3,"Thanks to whoever brought this one to our IPA day celebration. An original 2003 big bottle, which I believe is the very first batch.  A - Pours murky yellow, with quite a bit of sediment floating in it, with a small half finger tall white head leaving no lace down the glass.  S - Smells of huge amounts of candied sugar, caramel malt, booze, light tropical fruits, and just the faintest hint of citric hops. It has held up ok but the sweetness has only gotten stronger.  T - Starts off with a HUGE dose of candied sugar sweetness slowly giving way to a mix of caramel malt, dulled tropical fruits, tiny bit of citric hop bitterness, and lots of warming booze. While this one is eight years old it still has plenty of sweet booze to go around. The finish is very sweet, lingering for some time.  M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Sweet, syrup like, feel with plenty of sweetness lingering through the finish.  O - I have had this stuff fresh, aged for a few years, and now aged for the maximum amount of time, and every time I leave it feeling let down. If you like over the top sweetness, this is your beer.

10099,9086,Cavery,2.45,"from Blue Palms 3rd Anniversary Party, off a tap that kicked before the end of the hour. I was super excited to get a chance to try this fresh, thank you Blue Palms for the opportunity.  Review from notes, dated 8/13/11  A: Pure orange nectar body with some give towards golden yellows. This actually has a fairly rustic body, or at the very least is much darker than I expected it to be. Looks like an atomic malt bomb. Only slightly lighter than you'd expect a barleywine to be. Given that this is an IPA, it's disappointing to see no head retention or lacing.  S: Oh my god. Tamarind infused tequila. Ripe fruit skins of banana and kiwi. So sweet it makes me nervous. Diabetic coma in the nose. Cane sugar concentrates that are being sweated down to the last molecule. All sweetness finds a cough syrup like theme.  T: This thing really tastes like a nightmarish mixer. Hard sweet rum alcohol with a thick honey glazing of everlasting sweetness. Some deep grape nut malt flavors that might be manageable if it weren't for the compounding sweetness. I feel like I should be able to chew down the sugar crystals in this thing, good god I think I need do some blood letting. Really rough alcohol character that makes it seem like a far-cry from ANY beer style, let alone any form of IPA.  M: Medium full body that has some added weight of being like cough medicine. Painful potent alcohol coatings that create a protective layer preventing any other penetrating flavors. It leaves the mouth thick and slick, but also very flammable.  O: Needless to say, this thing is just too intense on the sweetness. I absolutely can't believe that some like this fresh. This kills the palate with some thick sugar crystals and bigger alcohols. Sweet potato fermented vodkas find an evil twin in tamarind infused tequilas. I can't even finish my overall review... passing...out...2....sweet..",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Some citrusy and floral hops are also present. Really weak, just doesnt present itself as a DIPA, all Im really getting is a good amount of hops and malt which is expected but the high alcohol content smell takes over, and blocks a lot.  T: Really hoppy, and really malty as expected, I'm getting a ton of caramel malt and citrus and floral and earthy hops. The dogfish head house yeast strain is there too, but this one doesnt show up as much as in 90 min. changes several times from sweet to bitter, back to sweet and then back to bitter again. The battle is really nice and shows it is well balanced between hops and malt. There is a distinct presence of alcohol, but not as much as you would think  M: Full bodied as hell, this is a creamy drinking beer, and has a really great amount of carbonation too. It lingers for a while on your tongue but in a good way. It really begs you to take another sip.  O: Expectations were high, and they were met, and possibly exceeded.

Extremely pungent citrus hop aroma, complemented by hints of caramel, toffee, molasses, toast, and vanilla. Taste is very sweet up front, probably less sweet than you might imagine.

The candyish sweetness is very nicely offset by the ridiculous accompanying hop flavor and bitterness.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,jondeelee,4.8,"Smells of thick, grapefruity hops--as would be suspected--but underlying that is a warm, yeasty and grainy smell, almost like baking bread.  On the tongue, oddly enough, and considering the sheer amount of hops that went in to making this brew, the first taste that comes across is sugar. But we're not talking any old sugar here--more like liquified superfine sugar mixed with vanilla and caramel and the rich, nutty taste of clarified ghee. There are also fruity flavors in here--think extra-sweet apricots, or the smell of fresh roses somehow turned into a candy flavor. Beneath that sugar is, of course, a massive amount of hoppy grapefruit bitterness (this is a beer with an IBU of 120, after all), but it blends surprisingly well with the malts, and doesn't--as might be suspected--end up being the kind of bitter that makes your mouth seize up. There is a large bitter aftertaste, but even that is readily palatable, and leaves you craving another sip.  Overall, I find this an incredible beer, and surprisingly well-balanced, given its nature. Every single individual flavor in the beer has admittedly been turned up to a Spinal-Tapping 11, but it somehow all balances wonderfully, making this easily one of the best beers I've ever had.  A final note for those interested (including dieters): according to the Dogfish Head website, this weighs in at a hefty 450 calories per 12 oz serving.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,russwbeck,4.3,"Enjoyed with ChrisWisor with WWS. A Heaven and Hell Black and Tan was created.  A: Hazy yellow pour with about a finger of white head. Lot of bubbles rising to the top.  S: Grass. This basically smells like grass. Perhaps some malts in the background, some booze certainly. I don't get slammed by hops like I was expecting.  T: Amazingly a couple of my friends who don't drink craft beer (past a 60 or 90 minute here and there) really like the taste. It gets some bonus points there. A huge hit of hops to start, but it fades quickly to malts and a big hit of booze. Very sweet. Tons of grapefruit. Most grapefruit I have ever tasted in a beer.  MF: Bit of a burn of alcohol at the end. Sips like a nice Bourbon honestly. Nicely carbonated, light in body.  O: I thought this was great. Really glad I got to try it. Can't wait to see how it ages.  Heaven and Hell Review  A: Black pour, a little lighter than WWS. Hardly any head remains. 3.5  S: Boozy. Seems like the majority of the smell is 120, even though I thought it had more WWS in it. Grassy hops, some malts, and a ton of booze. 4  T: The taste really follows everything else I'm seeing. While WWS makes its presence known, 120 Minute really shines through. Getting similar hops, grapefruit, and booze profile as 120, with the heaviness and slight maltiness from the WWS. 4  MF: Heavier than 120, nicely carbonated.

S: Putting my nose to the glass nearly knocked me on my ass. Pungent hops but more importantly sickly sweet candied fruits. It was like getting liquid hard candy shot up my nose.  T: Awful. Just awful. Sickly sweet is an understatement. It's unfortunate because there are some nice tropical fruit and citrus flavors there, but it's covered in tons (literally) of corn sugar. I couldn't choke down more than 3 sips. The hop profile wasn't overly bitter/pine, just a lot of really sweet citrus and tropical fruits. It's really hard to describe anything else. Sure, there was a big malt base, but it was completely lost behind all the sugar.  M: Low carbonation, imagine the thickest possible DIPA... it's thicker. Pancake syrup thick. For a stout with decent carbonation, great. For a sickly sweet DIPA, disgusting. Easily one of the worst textured beers I've had.  O: This was a drain pour for me, I couldn't get past 3 sips. Sickly sweet doesn't even come close, it's disgusting. I don't even know how someone calls this a DIPA. Think of the thickest, sweetest, hottest American Barleywine imaginable, it doesn't have anything on 120min IPA. I can't say this word enough: Disgusting. The only reason this doesn't get a complete fail is because it wasn't a stomach churning, make me puke nasty, just way way way too sweet.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,mrand01,4.08,"2011 Vintage, shared with nicoco184. Poured into a Duvel tulip.  A: Golden, copper color. Translucent. Thin lacing, not very much head at all. Appears to be fairly sticky.  S: Syrupy, a bit boozy. Fruity - dates or figs mainly. Smells a lot like a barleywine. It's kinda hard to identify more through the booze.  T: Sweet - dried figs & caramel. Slightly boozy, but not overpowering, or as much as the scent would suggest. I've had previous years of 120 that have been less balanced than this.  M: Not very carbonated at all, kind of sticky. This is a pretty heavy beer, there is a weight to it in your mouth.  O: Clearly this beer is meant as a treat. No one sessions this! That said, it's pretty well balanced and way better than previous vintages have been fresh.

10099,9086,Pahn,4.15,"12oz bottle into Duvel tulip. 2011 vintage (don't think there's been more than one, but if so, this is the most recent).  Appearance: Free pour yields a one and a half inch frothy white head that dissipates slowly with spotty lacing. Pours a clear, vibrant dark orange and leaves streaks of lacing. Doesn't look like a gimmicky high gravity mess; looks like a solid beer.  Smell: Tons of grapefruit, lemon, pineapple, with some harsh booziness and burnt toast. As the beer warms, it keeps on pushing out deeper, fuller, more complex hop aromas; various citrus zest, melon, tropical fruits, banana (!?). Once again referencing gimmickry, the obscene amount of hops put into this beer are doing their job on the aroma front.  Taste: Surprisingly balanced flavor up front, with some alcohol heat, heavy tropical fruit and melon hops (mild citrus), and a nice biscuit / toast counterpoint. Thick, resiny feel resolves into a strangely sharp bitterness in the finish, unlike most high IBU beers (more reminiscent of extreme sourness than bitterness, but it is bitterness). Predictably long hot aftertaste, more spirit-like than anything--which, while relatively uninfluenced by hops and malt, is pleasant, and something you should expect from a 15%~20% beer.  This is a well thought out beer. The sweetness, thickness, bitterness, heat, all compliment each other well. The hop flavors aren't quite as diverse as the aromas, but they still grow and change into weird melon, citrus zest, and citrus pith flavors. I guess I'm not sure that I want the flavor to go this far out, but I appreciate going on the journey at least once.  Mouthfeel: Full bodied, moderate carbonation, thick and smooth with a sharply bitter finish and long hot aftertaste. The sharpness is kind of weird and maybe unwelcome, and the thickness can also be off-putting, but really it all works with the beer.  Overall: What a strange beast. Definitely pushes and then bypasses entirely the boundaries of any sort of IPA, yet it's distinctively *not* a barleywine. It's a huge, boozy, balanced hop explosion. It's like a wanking guitar solo whose virtuosity gets so extreme that you no longer recognize the genre, or even the instrument. Not something I want every day, but I definitely appreciate the skill and the novelty.  Plus, it really does taste pretty good. I'm impressed.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,xdopiex,4.3,"Found a bar that carried this on a trip to New York. Bottle poured into a snifter.  The pour had a small single finger head, with no retention and medium lacing. Color was a golden apricot brown with a slight orange hue; grapefruit honey nose.  Front end is pretty sweet, with a significant warming effect from the alcohol (18% ABV!). Mouthfeel was a good smooth malty body, with a disappointing small hop bitterness. Light carbonation.  The beer reminds me a lot of Paulo Santo Marron, with much of the flavor coming from the alcohol. It wasn't as hoppy as I would've expected or liked, but it is what it is. A rare beer, but nothing exceptionally special.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,cbarrett4,4.62,"Finally scored a small glass at APEX Portland.  This beer was so amazingly aromatic that I could have written a list of the aromatics while carrying the glass two feet from my nose!  Poured a deep, burnished copper hue with some haze. Lingering head that refused to give up.  Smells slightly of alcohol (not for the faint of heart), lots of hop oils, tangerine, lemon, orange peel, honey, pine, and spice. Seriously. So much going on in this bad boy.  Taste profile is good, just not as dramatic as the nose suggests. Alcohol really kicks you here. It's like a good fino sherry in that way. More hops and some toasty notes.  The texture is about as rich and luxurious as you could want in an IPA without being obscene. Alcohol is really the only detractor and it is a minor one.  Overall one of the best IPAs I have tasted, but it's big and bold. Oh, did you see it's really 18% abv? Yeah.  Worthy!

Some what hot after its all down.  O - Overall great brew. Hard to explain the 18%, but i guess its there. I am usually thinking of piny/grassy/floral hops flavor but this was different for a IPA of this kind. It came undone after it warmed up a little and I kinda liked it better when warmer.

Not much lacing down the glass, though none is expected at this ABV. For what it is, this is splendidly gorgeous!  This is foul. Yes, it's hoppy. Yes, there's some caramel sweetness. Yes, there's a touch of citrus. But, yes, this smells like nail polish remover. It gets worse and worse as it warms, becoming more potent and cough-inducing. This might just be rocket fuel disguised as beer.  This beer wasn't enjoyable on any level. It's more astringent and harsh than most liquors, reminding me of nail polish remover more than anything. The caramel sweetness and slight citrus aren't enough to overcome the beer's brutal harshness. This wasn't for me.  Medium to thick bodied. Appropriate.  This beer simply isn't for me; I'm glad others like it, but I don't find much redeeming about it. I won't be revisiting it again. I struggled to make it to the halfway point of my 6oz. pour.

10099,9086,mdfb79,3.65,"From 08/03/11 notes. Had on tap at Rustico in Ballston in Arlington, VA. Pretty excited to have a full glass of this as I tried 2 oz.'s of it up at NOTB/EBF back in March and enjoyed it quite a bit. 10 oz. pour into a stange.  a - Pour a reddish orange amber color with two fingers of light white head and moderate carbonation evident. Two minutes of retention and lots of fluffy lacing. Looks pretty good.  s - Smells of fruity malts, citrus hops, alcohol, sugar, tropical fruits. Overall very citrusy and sweet, but pretty nice. Not overly hoppy.  t - Tastes of fruity malts, cloyingly sweet, alcohol, candy, and sugar. VERY sweet; a little too much for me. Alcohol is definitely evident as well.  m - Medium to full body and moderate carbonation. Body is thick and almost syrupy, and the alcohol is definitely evident when drinking this one.  o - Overall a pretty good beer, but I was a bit disappointed. It is very strong and very very sweet, and does not have a ton of fresh hops going on with it, more fruity malts. While I enjoyed it, a 10 oz. pour was way too much. They offered 4 oz. samples of the beer which sounds about perfect to me; halfway through the glass it got kind of rough. I'd have it again, but would want to keep it to the 2 or 4 oz. pours. Pretty good, just not what I look for in a DIPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,azdback,4.35,"Poured into a Samuel Adams Boston Lager glass. A light yellow orange color. Pretty clear and full of tiny carbonation bubbles. Head is a small one finger of bright white foam. Lace seems to want to stick. Kind of out of place for such a high ABV.  Smell is like lemon sweet vodka.  Taste is ultra sweet from endless malts and at the same time wicked bitter. Tastes of pink grapefruit and lemon. The sweet is almost straight brown sugar. There is some alcohol in the taste. It actually is quite prevalent, but not even close to as overpowering as it is on the nose.  The mouth is very rich. The sweetness and alcohol kind of leave the palate a bit wrecked, but I was completely expecting this when I cracked the crown on this one.  Overall I must let you all know how great this is! I haven't had this for probably four years or so, but I don't think my palate was quite as refined as it is now. A must try.... every year. This was the 2011 vintage.

10099,9086,Rschis16,4.03,"Bought this at the brew pub in Delaware. It was bottled on 7/7/2008, poured into my signature DFH glass. I chose to pour a few drops of the sediment in.  Dark cloudy burnt orange color with lots of sediment floating around, mostly around the bottom of the glass. 1 finger off-white head that reduces down to a silky sheet. Smells like dried cherries and other dried fruits. Malty, in the form of caramel more so than hoppy, boozy more so than anything. The hops are toned down a lot, I believe due to the 3 years of aging.  The taste is definitely big and bold to say the least. A lot going here. Dried cherries again, but backed by caramel malts that are more prominent than hops. 3 years went a long way in softening up the bitterness, but there is a taste of piney hops that is overwhelmed by the other flavors. The booze is super strong of course. I don't think the 18% is accurate anymore, but I have no way of knowing. It has more of a boozy taste than a 20% port. It actually burns a little going down. But the awesome part is how smooth it feels. Creamy and surprisingly easy to drink. In fact, port-like is the way I would describe the feel of this, only slightly carbonated and slightly hoppy.  Ok for all intents and purposes, this is not a realistic beer to drink very often, but you have to appreciate the uniqueness and out of the box thinking that DFH is known for. I will be sure to try to pick up one from the next batch as I am extremely interested in how they compare. I have no doubt that the newer one will not be so smooth or port like.

10099,9086,Blanco,4.1,"2011 Vintage  Pours a light amber red color with solid white fluffy head. Head starts to dissipate rather quickly. A brief smell of hops immediately hits the air as the beer was cracked. The smell is of fruity citrus hops, big malt, light fruit, caramel, generic ""sweet"" smell. A strong whiff yields a decent bit of alcohol in my nose. The taste is harshly bitter, yet surprisingly mellow. Grapefruit citrus and slightly vinous character. Definitely not as sweet as i expected from the smell. Definitely thicker than normal for the style on the mouthfeel, but it's not exactly as big as a stout. The alcohol provides a warming sensation in the chest as well.  Overall, this is definitely an interesting and great beer if for no other reason than I don't know how they did it. I've been waiting for years and person after person has screamed ""don't do it."" Sam has created a huge monster in this beer, but despite the warnings, despite the ABV, despite the strong alcohol presence in the smell, the beer is incredibly drinkable.

10099,9086,WSB,4.9,"The color is honey, clear, no bubbles, and it seems to have an oily sheen on the head, with only hints of off white lacing remaining. A very thin head returns with a swirl of the glass, but quickly retreats.  Smell is awesome. Huge hops, all hops, it wafts from the snifter and engulfs the nose. Sweet and piney with an alcoholy backside, this aroma comes to you.  Mouthfeel is active and intense. Thick on the palate, oily and alcohol fuzzy on the tongue.  Taste is intense, deep hops, piney, grapefruity hints, with a subtle sweetness and warm finish. Oddly unbitter given the sheer amount of hops.  For the amount of hops, an oddly smooth finish. The hops are super tasty, they don't ruin the palate like with a Stone Ruination IPA.

T & M & D - So sweet and powerful up front and then the middle opens to many citrus characters and the end finishes suprisingly smooth and with a candy like sugary sweetness. The beer is powerful in ABV and it is interesting to taste such a strong sweetness with little bits of hop and citrus mingled in. The body is big syrupy almost with a little carbination - Makes it a good sipper like a sweet port or something.  O - Try it and sip it.

10099,9086,BarryMFBurton,4.06,"Review #100: what a long, strange trip it’s been. Well actually, it’s only been about four months. What a short, strange trip it’s been, I guess…either way, it’s been really fun. I’ve become familiar with more beers than I ever thought I’d get to try in my whole life, let alone in the course of sixteen or so weeks. I’ve become immersed in an area of adult life that I never thought would welcome me. I’m now well-versed in many aspects of this diverse craft culture, and have been able to essentially “travel the globe” by experiencing the beers of other countries. But best of all, I’ve been blessed with more beer experiences than many people will have in years. I’m truly thankful I’ve become a beer geek early, and there’s no way I’m ever turning back.  So, to celebrate this milestone, I’ve cracked open a legend: Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA. The great thing about this one, though, is that it was bottled on 11/05/08 – nearly three years ago. It’s my first experience with a beer that has some solid age on it. A great way to commemorate great beer, which has been a wonderful addition to my life. So, without further ado, here’s review #100: Dogfish Head 120 Minute. Thanks to all you BA’s who helped and encouraged me along the way!  Brewed two years, nine months before the date of this tasting (“Bottled on Nov. 5th, 2008”).  A: Gorgeous! The body on this one shines like a masterpiece, a bright amber-orange. Age may have given it an extra pop, as it shows consistent, heavy fizz through the body for the longest time. The head is a silky cream that leaves just a hint of micro-lacing. Great retention and clarity give this a professional, aged look, as it should have. The Imperial IPA has never looked better.  S: Big, fusel alcohol is first in the nose; not surprising for something with 18% ABV. After that, it’s like a malt explosion. The caramel scent is more syrupy than I could have ever imagined, though you can still pick out the fruity backbone. There’s residual sugars in there, too, leaving aromas of freshly-made, old-fashioned candy. The spice of the alcohol even starts to warm me before I take a sip. Bold and beautiful, this one’s nose even finishes with thick afterthoughts. It’s gonna take a long time to finish this one, I’m sure; but I’ll enjoy every minute of it.  T: THAT is an impressive amount of malt. How did they get all of that in one little bottle? I feel like I’m drinking bread at times – wow. They come in with a sweetness of cloying proportions, tasting almost like cough syrup at times. No matter, it makes up for the bad with even better fruity cream-sweets, like in a dessert soda. The hops haven’t completely faded after this long, either; they provide a solid kick of bitters, but in an aged, almost woody way. That oaky taste might just be the old malts playing complimentary to the bitter flowers, though. Either way, it’s a bitter tinge that pushes this even farther into the realm of a barleywine. Raisins, honey, and brandy flavors come in at the end, sending the aftertaste to somewhere sticky and pungent (almost solvent-like). There's even a bit of citrusy lemon/grapefruit notes from the hops if you wait long enough - interesting. This is a powerful palate, so it’s obvious why this beer is so polarizing. Hell, it cleaned out my sinuses!  M: Surprisingly good drinkability, actually. For all its alcohol, you can’t really tell that this one is approaching more of a liquor than anything else. The carbonation seems to have become rather evident over the past couple of years, so it’s relatively light on the tongue (for the ABV, at least). All things considered, it’s much thicker than normal, of course.  O: EXTREEEME beer is not really my favorite. I really love a nice, balanced beer that manages to remain drinkable. This beer, for what it is, has a lot of rounded flavors and mellow effects (though they are usually overshadowed by the epic maltiness of the palate). It might not be one that I’ll be having again anytime soon, but it was a great way to broaden my horizons after ninety-nine previous adventures in craft beer.  Here’s to one hundred more!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Scrumtralecent,4.25,"2011 bottle poured into a snifter.  A - Pours a little darker orange with a soft off-white head that lingers.  S - No surprise, hops. It's a complex hop character though, with some soothing citrus hop rounding the back end, and piney notes stinging the aroma up front. Some notes of roasted barley and caramel too.  T - Quite the hop punch in the mouth. Oddly, the first thing I taste real quick is a nice sweet citrus hop flavor, and then just a punching of piney hops. Reminds me almost of peppers where you get that taste, and then the heat comes up afterwards. A quite delicious backbone from the malt and barley. Very full and well rounded taste.  M - If it wasn't for the massive amount of hops, I would consider this quite drinkable. The hops definitely weigh heavy on the mouth. The carbonation is good, and the flavors continually pop.  O - I expected just a big hop punch which I got, but didn't expect that smooth silky backbone that made this very enjoyable to drink.

T: Booze is right at the door but it has a nice sweet finish. Subtle hops at the finish. Honestly, it tastes great. Very much like a cream soda or something. It is not really like an IPA at all. That being said, the flavors that are there, are really really good. I would almost see this more as a session ale as it definitely got better the longer I drank it and the flavors were a bit more pronounced and balanced.  M: Almost no carbonation, very strong but very smooth. I was shocked at how smooth it was considering how boozy it was. Very thick and creamy, massive body, but its really great.  O: Very good beer.

On the tongue the alcohol is a little less, but I was definitely overwhelmed by the warmth of it. Lots of caramel and malt with a small bit of citrus hops, but barely.

Surprisingly, I had much hoppier beers...I don't want to say the hops are weak, but there are many other things I taste in the forefront aside from hops such as ALCOHOL and honey. At 18% abv., no amount of hops will defeat the alcohol. Some other minute flavors as well such as the aforementioned fruits.  M - Again, surprisingly for what I would consider a triple ipa (even though it says double), there are pretty much no hops in the aftertaste...they barely linger whatsoever. The honey and fruit sweetness, however, are what tarry in the mouth. The alcohol lasts as well.  O - This is a fantastic beer. Well worth the price and the wait. As far as what everyone says...""it does not at all resemble 60 or 90 minute""...pretty true. Surprsingly this beer is much less hop-forward than even the 60 minute, never mind the 90 minute, and it is also much sweeter and has way more of a noticeable alcohol character. I have also heard about as many positive reviews as I have negative. I have a feeling that many of the negative reviews are due to the fact that most expect it to be a hop-bomb that completely blows away 90 minute ipa...this is far from the case, but it is definitely a great beer that it worthy of the hype...I just wish it was easier to access. If I had to compare this to another beer in terms of similarities...none really come to mind, but this beer is more similar to a Belgian Tripel or even a Barleywine (sweeter styles)...definitely not comparable to any other DIPAs. This beer is closer to mead than a DIPA in my opinion.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,KingforaDay,4.13,"First BA review and why not start with NJ's most elusive beer. Had on tap as a tasting at DFH brewery tour and then again hours later in 12 oz snifter glass at Brewpub in Rehoboth.  A-Amber/Orange in color with very little head, minimal lacing and a delicate carbonation.  S-Hops galore with grapefruit/tangerine/apricot and some peachy flavors and an overall sweetness that I loved. Would love to stick a glass of it in my A/C vents and fill the room with the aroma, but at 18% abv I'm afraid my kids might pass out.  T-Tastes just like it smells, sweet and citrusy with hops taste coming through. Alcohol is definately there, but given the ABV, not nearly as evident as i would have expected. Medium body but overall smooth with a cream like feel.  O-Been waiting for this beer for over a year and it did not dissapoint. Definately one of the more interesting beers DFH or anyone for that matter puts out. I actually ordered a variety 5 beer DFH flight while i sipped it so i could savor it longer. I have a bottle of it also which i think I will age, but definately happy to have had it fresh on tap at the Brewpub.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,davey101,4,"2011 vintage into a DFH signature glass. Reviewed on 7/24/2011.  A - Dark copper/amber body, off-white head that really sticks around. Some nice lacing and retention. 4.0/5  S - Super bitter hops, alcohol. Really strong and intense. 3.0/5  T - Pungent, bitter hop flavor. Lots of sweet malts. Alcoholic twang at the end, but it somehow manages to be drinkable. Syrupy and meaty mouth feel. 4.0/5  O - I equate this to drinking a hop liquer. Very strong and intense, yet smooth and drinkable. It does start to become a bit of a chore to drink this towards the end of the glass though. Definitley worth the experience and high price tag. 3.5/5  2008 vintage into a DFH signature glass. Bottling date of 11/06/08 and reviewed on 7/30/2011.  A - Murky copper/brown body. A slight bit of sludge towards the end of the pour. A tiny khaki head that recedes to some light edging and eventually just legs after a swirl. 3.5/5  S - Sweet malts, raisins, brown sugar and alcohol. The hops have faded and whats left is something that reminds of a toned down version of raison d'extra. 4.5/5  T - The flavor starts off with sweet figs and raisins and a healthy dose of super sweet DFH malt. A bit of spice and alcohol bite rounds it all out. Meaty mouth feel with just the right amount of carbonation. Drinks a lot better than fresh. 4.5/5  O - This beer makes a real 180 with age on it. It transforms from a massively hopped up booze bomb into a mellow yet intense barley wine. Its not overtly complex, but is a really nice sipping beer. A real treat if you enjoy sweeter beers. 4.5/5  I averaged together the two scores to achieve my actual rating.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,MightyCasey,4.25,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. A: Pours a deep copper with a reasonable head, especially given the abv. S: Initial aromas of crystal malts, hops, and alcohol come through in the nose. T: I got flavors of something resemblling ethyl alcohol, a pretty sizable level of malt complexity, hop resins, and hop flavor as I let it slowly expand across my palate in very small and controlled sips. M: The finish was relatively sweet, but certainly not cloying; a feat in a beer with a starting gravity as high as this one must have had. Overall, this was unlike nearly every other beer I’ve ever had. High alcohol but drinkable... Be careful.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

T- The taste is pretty surprising, still really sweet, candy, syrupy, but in an enjoyable way, really easy drinkability which is dangerous for how high the abv is, really warming as it goes down, slight malt presence. M- Medium mouth feel, smooth, coats the mouth.

Getting a finish that has a lot of toffee type flavors.  M- syrupy. Thick. Boozy. Ugh  O- I've been drinking one 12 oz for about...two hours now. Still not done.

10099,9086,rlee1390,3.85,"A-Semi-cloudy orange, one finger head.  S-Great deal of hops, some citrus notes and slight earthy tones.  T-Very sweet and sugary. Citrus comes through as well. Not as bitterness as one would expect. When I hear ""holy grail"" of hop heads I'm thinking extremely bitter (Hoptimum comes to mind as far as just extremely bitter is concerned) There is some slight alcohol notes in there as well.  M-Heavy, semi-smooth, alcohol is notices. Decent level of carbonation for such a high abv beer though.  O-I'm glad I got to try it once. I'll most likely never have it again fresh in my life. Come November if the beer is released again, I'll buy some up to age and see how that works out. At the end of the day it is true what the reviews say, 90 Minute is better. Although I will never adjust an overall score based on price, I will through this out there that at 10 bucks for a 10oz this is one of the worse Rating/Price beers out there.

10099,9086,Alieniloquium,3.65,"12 oz. bottle poured into a tulip. 2011 vintage.  Appearance - Light amber, dark gold body with a little bit of a head. Very clear and a tiny bit of lacing, which is stunning considering the ABV. Swirling it around coats the glass. It doesn't look nice in the traditional sense, but it still looks classy.  Smell - Interesting nose. At first, I didn't get alcohol. The second smell was all alcohol. It smells like apple juice and raisins. Maybe cherries, too. It's all malt. Some floral hops, but it's tough behind all that malt.  Taste - Like drinking honey. Extremely sweet. I get almost no hops from the flavor. A lot of apple and other fruits in the malt. A little bit of a hop bitterness in the finish, along with loads of booze.  Mouthfeel - Not as syrupy as I'd expect, but still thick. A lot of booze and low carbonation. It is what it is so it's tough to hold that against it, but it's still tough to drink.  Overall - This one's fresh and I have one to age. We'll see how it develops, but I'm not in a rush to drink any more of these fresh.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Urbancaver,3.65,2008 vintage. Thanks Carl.  Pours a hazy orange. No real head. Not particularly appealing looking  Smells boozy and malty.

T - Strong citrus. Not very hoppy. Nice malt situation. Strong, but for 18% (or whatever it is) it's not too boozy (but still pretty boozy). Nicely balanced.  M - Thick, and dense.  O (D) - It's hot.

Gorgeous looking. Nice lacing.  S: I get tropical citrus fruits on the nose. Smells amazing. Hardly any alcohol in the smell.  T: Very surprised at how different this tastes. Very balanced for how high the ABV is. I really like this. Nice fruit flavor, with a nice hop bite. Awesome malt finish. Really a special brew.  M: Thickest ipa I've ever had.

10099,9086,Mosley1212,3.85,"My previous review of this seems to have disappeared. Good thing I kept my notes. Poured from the bottle into a DFH Snifter. Enjoyed at The Local in Coral Gables, FL.  A--Poured a vibrant orange with a small off-white head that dissipated quickly. Left oily streaks down the side of the glass throughout the drink.  S--Hop blast up front. Very oily, wet hop smell. Lots of alcohol on the nose. Get a bit of grapefruit, apricot, and lemon peel on the finish.  T--Malty hops. There is a large amount of hop oil on the palate. The dry hop taste that most IPAs have is replaced with an oily malt taste.  M--Very heavy and sticky in the mouth. The alcohol does not go down easily.  O--I'm glad I got the chance to try this. Since I have gotten into craft, this beer has not been available. Luckily, I snagged the last bottle of this before it was gone. Not something I will actively seek out and drop all the money on in the future--especially since DFH makes a lot more wallet-friendly, wonderful tasting IPAs.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Looks very much like a fruit beer.  S: Most of the hops come up here with fruit smells - peach, apricots  T: Ohhh, so good. Hops are there but subdued. This has a very sweet taste but without being cloying. Hops and Honey is probably the best way I'd describe it. Worked very well with the buffalo wings that I had. However, I was surprised that it wasn't boozy given the 18% ABV. This had a very smooth taste.  M: Just a faint hint of carbonation, but this here's a sipping beer.  O: More please.

Appears an orange and gold with a tiny outside rim of thin bubbles and acsmall oil slick in the middle.  Smells of sweet tropical fruits: mango, apricot, pineapple. Sweet sweet hops with a touch of booziness.  Tastes of apricot. Not as sweet as in years past and not quite as boozy. The difference between 18% and 21% is noticeable. This is my favorite for a reason: a sweet hop bomber!  Mouthfeel is thick and filling but just short of cloying in terms of its sweetness. It truly goes back and forth between tropical and hop bitterness due to it's complexity.  I can't deny this. It's my #1 and I'd cross the dessert for it. It's amazing and my heart grew fonder due to not having one for about 18 months. All hail 120!!!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,slash196,4.71,"Appearance: A deep, deep ruby red, with some lingering lace that stuck around until the bottom. Served in a 12-ounce snifter, but it struck me as perfectly suitable for an old-fashioned pint glass.  Smell: Hoppy and sweet, but not as much nose as one might expect out of an ale this strong. Some of that is probably the relative lack of carbonation; the 120 minute is definitely less foamy and ""beery"" than, say the Festina Peche. This beer is all business.  Taste: Like all great beers, this beer packs multiple flavor profiles. Off the tip of the tongue it's sweet, fruity, and complex, with an absolutely uncanny smoothness. Make sure you also get it in back of your throat (sort of a gargling motion), because that's a whole different ball game. Almost brutally bitter, with a massive shock of hop oil enough to challenge any hop-head (but it's well worth the challenge).  F – Full bodied and sweet, fairly light but with a solid amount of the hop oil; let's face it, this beer is basically all hops. Knock-your-teeth-out strength; per-volume it's about two-and-a-half times stronger than a gin and tonic.  D – Unlike a very strong belgian, this brew stays true to its roots; this is unmistakably an Imperial IPA with the hops turned up to Plaid. I paid ten dollars for a glass of this and it was worth every thin dime (for the record, it took me about 45 minutes to finish it, such was the power).  Fun story: I went to the Dogfish Head Alehouse for my birthday, and halfway through my dinner they tapped a new keg of this.

For lack of better glassware this was poured into a nice white wine glass.  I have let it sit for about 15-20 minutes to develop. The nose hits me with alcohol unlike many other beers. Rich fruits, citrus maybe tangerine and grapefruit.  Tastes like candied citrus drops. Tropical fruits and burnt sugars. There is a richness to it and a sharpness of alcohol. I can tell this is going to be better in a couple years after it rounds out more and mellows. To be honest, the alcohol is overtaking a lot of the nuances in it and the warmth in the end lasts quite a while.  The mouthfeel is very rich and coating. Not thick, but just right.

S: The smell is full of hops still, old hops, but its still there. Fusel alcohol and caramel are very big. There is a citrusy smell that might papaya fruit.  T: Big alcohol but nicely mellowed due to the age. There is a nice tropical fruitiness and caramel. This beer is super sweet, almost too sweet but I can handle the 6 oz no problem; trying to drink this yourself might be a chore. The fading floral hops are on their way out at this point in the beer's life. Its easy drinking considering the ABV and the inflated ingredient use.  M: Medium mouthfeel. Carbonation feels very low. The high alcohol is pleasant at this point, nothing absurd, just warming and enjoyable.  O: I really thought this beer was going to be too much. It was a surprise that it drank so well. The sweetness was a little overwhelming for us both but I can see past that to all the good this has to offer.

More apricot than citrus.  T – Sweet start, with hints of caramel, then the hops kick in for a smooth, bitter finish. Alcohol is well hidden  F – Full bodied, heavy, with medium carbonation. You don't notice the high alcohol until the finish, when you get a mild burn on the back of the throat. This is thick, even sticky, with that coat the tongue quality.  D – At $8.50 retail per 12-oz bottle, this is not a session beer. And even if it were less expensive, between the high ABV and the general heaviness of the beer, it would be tough to drink more than 2, 3 max, in a sitting",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Appearance: Pours a clear medium caramel color with golden-orange highlights and a 1 finger off-white head which dissipates fairly quickly leaving a thin film at the top of the beer. Nice sticky lacing.  Smell: Sweet citrus hops, grassy notes and much less alcohol than I expected. Smells quite sweet.  Taste: Sweet caramel and citrus up front followed by a touch of molasses in the middle before ending with mild hoppy bitterness at the finish. The taste is almost cloyingly sweet, but not quite. The alcohol is masked in the flavor. You really only detect it after you swallow. The aftertaste is mostly oranges and orange peel.  Mouthfeel: Full-bodied, creamy and much thicker than I'm used to with DIPAs (of course this isn't your average DIPA). The hops are oily and quite sticky.  Drinkability: High drinkability for a beer with 18% ABV. It goes down very smooth. I had to remind myself that this was a sipper as I was drinking it a little too rapidly.  Overall: Excellent beer overall. This is far from your standard Double IPA, but that shouldn't be a deterrent. Dogfish Head is known for pushing boundaries and this one definitely meets that objective. I plan on aging the other bottle for a while.

Very thin ring present from the beginning and lasting for the session. Small island of tinny bubbles present. Swirling produces some foaming but it dissipates very quickly. No lacing present.  S: At first the hops were the dominant aroma when sniffing this beer. Quickly that was replaced by a very sweet alcohol aroma. There are some spicy notes noted in the background along with some malt and traces of burnt sugar.  T: Sweet malt with an alcohol bite. Hops are hard to detect at first but appear midway then dissipate quickly leaving a lingering bitterness and residual sweetness.  M: Full bodied with a fair amount of carbonation. Very sticky and slightly cloying. Seems to leave more of a film than the 90 minute.  D: Couldn't drink more than one in an evening. One that really should be savored and allowed to open to fully enjoy. I can really only recommend this to those looking for something completely unique or those that are die hard DFH fans.

10099,9086,tomfneph,3.3,"I was given this 2011 version by Tom Behr. He obtained it thru his son's establishment The Beer Trappe in Lexington, KY. I poured this ""beer"" into a frosted mug. I was surprised by the orange amber color and one half inch mocha head. Very good start. The nose is what you would expect from an American double IPA. Powerful citrusy hops followed by the alcohol burn. I put ""beer"" in quotations because this is really a mead. I believe Dogfish mixed honey and hop oil, malted the alcohol up to 18% and called it an IPA. Come on, American IPA's are not this sweet!! It was way too sweet for me to just sip. I recommend you drink this beer with food. It went well with bleu cheese wedge salad and beef. The mouthfeel is what you would expect from a mead, cloyingly thick and oily. You have to wait for the hoppy bitters to shine thru the honey and ?watermelon? But the bitter is very short-lived. I don't really like sweet beer. This one goes way beyond Belgian sweetness. This is supposed to be a fantastic beer but I cut it to 3.0 overall. It's ok with food but tough to drink by itself.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Hops, peaches, plenty of smooth caramelly malt to balance the hops and get that gravity. Also plenty of honey.  Mouthfeel is pretty standard, not much to say here.  Well, completely different from the 60 and the 90. Much more similar to the World Wide Stout, just, y'know... not stout.  EDIT: Tried an '08 at DFH Brewing and Eats in Rehoboth Beach in Dec 2011.

Side by side, this was almost the exact same color as 90 minute.  Smells like sweet and tangy oranges. Sense of alcohol, caramel, darker malts, dark citrus like grapefruit. Hoppy. Malts smell good.  Spice note then a dark ctirus and dark resiny fruit overtake. Very sweet, some caramel. Then the bitter starts up. Not as much hoppiness as expected, but big malts and good bitter close. It's balanced, but it's a larger maltiness.  Theres a thicker feel thats got some stickiness to it, but ok carbonation still. Medium heavy body.  Overall somewhat different than I expected.

S - Citrus notes, a plethora of hops, some noticeable alcohol presence, and a slight sweetness.  T - Cloying and boozy. Far too sweet, the hop bitterness can't mask the rest. More like a syrup than a beer.  M - Oily thick medium body. Low carbonation level. Again, syrup-like.  D - A novelty I suppose, but to me it seems like a waste of a lot of good hops.

A - Poured into my Duvel tulip a crystal clear copper pour with a nice creamy one finger head thanks to a vigorous pour. The earth toned head faded at the typical rate leaving a small halo and a nice cloud. Pretty good for such a high ABV.  S - Its good, but somewhat of a let down. Lots of bitter pine and citrus (grapefruit) but its somehow overwhelmed by malt sweetness, which I didnt think woul dbe possible. The ABV is hidden by all that malt sweetness.  T - The slight disappointment continues. I was expecting an absolute hop nuclear war in my mouth. Instead I get a nice oily hop that is immediately overwhelmed by sticky malt sweetness. Really not what I was expecting. Its good, just, not what I was expecting.  M - Good for a DIPA. Just enough carbonation to prevent it from feeling either too thin, or too syrupy/sticky sweet.  O - Overall, I was kinda disappointed with this beer. For all the hype that surrounds it I guess I was expecting a hell of alot more.

10099,9086,engagechad,3.99,"2011 batch just came in yesterday Purchased as a single from Wine and Beer Westpark in Glen Allen, VA - poured into DFH snifter  Pours an amber orange with a moderate, very dense looking head. Smells like I'm sticking my nose into a jar of hop pellets. It's awesome. Taste is SWEEET.. man.. It is enjoyable to a degree as the alcohol is very well masked however the sweetness is just crazy. Tastes wonderfully dry on the finish. Mouthfeel is thick and goopy almost, not really ideal for me.  Overall this is a beer for the hop heads of course. I'm glad that I was able to try it but I would't kill for another really. It smells amazing and the finish is great but the sweetness is just wooo",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,evanlarkin,3.34,"Got a bottle of the June 2011 batch... About time I got to try this!  Appearance: A light-amber/orange color without much head at all. Fairly clear. It really is a beautiful looking beer.  Smell: Piney hops and booze are the main things to come through here. Really, they're just about the only things. I cannot help but think ""Gin & Tonic"" when I get a whiff of this one. Pleasant, but an entirely different drink.  Taste: First off, the sweetness hits you. It's a malty citrusy sweetness, though the hops flavor comes in mostly piney. Booze is in the background the whole way. Once again, it reminds me of a gin & tonic. Surprisingly low bitterness considering the style and extremeness, by the way.  Mouthfeel: Thick and syrupy, much more so than any other IPA I've ever had. It feels like a more carbonated stout. Also, the alcohol heat is a very strong presence which simply cannot be ignored.  Overall: I can enjoy this, but I probably wouldn't just buy one any time. It reminds me too much of gin & tonic, which I can get much cheaper. Still, I'm glad I had the opportunity, and I may pick up another bottle, since I'm interested to see how well this ages.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,LtCracker20,3.96,"Fresh 2011 batch.  A- Pours a crystal clear deep golden almost copper body with a good 2-finger off-white head that's actually lasting for a little bit before falling to a decent cap and it leaves some sticky lace behind.  S- Citrusy hops up front followed by caramel and toffee sweetness. Slight achohol, but not too much. Very sweet, though.  T- Very sweet, but not overly sweet. The citrusy hop flavors help to cancel out some of the sweetness. Still pretty sweet, but for the abv, it's kind of expected, as is the slight burn as you swallow. There's also some resiny piney flavor towards the back end.  MF- Definatley a big body on this one. Not too syrupy, but that slick feeling is there. It also is well carbonated for having the abv that it does.  O- Fresh, this is a very good beer. Hoppy and balanced out by the sweetness (maybe even too much). Can't wait to see what it's like in a few years.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

10099,9086,Krakistophales,1.18,"A: Pours copper color with very little head and just a bit of bubbles up top and some lacing.  S: Interestingly enough, it doesn't smell like hops at all. I'm picking up roast, coffee, toffee, caramel, candied fruit, curious spice notes like liquorice and anise, and a heavy sort of rum raisin cake smell.  T: Candied fruit, dark rum, raisins, caramel apple, maple syrup, molasses, brown sugar, cloying sweetness. This is complex in smell and taste, but in a way that's offensive to my palate. I just can't grow to like this. Maybe with age?  O: I was hoping for the holy grail for hopheads, but instead I get a barleywine that's been fortified with syrup and booze for 120 minutes. I'm sorry, but this is probably one of the worst beers I've had to drink, and I love other DFH stuff like 90 minute, WWS, Chateau Jiahu and others...but this just blows. Now I'm stuck with 5 bottles of this stuff. Anyone wanna trade?",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Hopfenpeter,4.38,"My beer guy at the ""Bottle Shop"" had reserved me two bottles of this elixir. One for now and one for storage. This treasure poured a clear copper gold with an attractive creamy beige head building about two fingers high. Good retention. It leaves nice lacing on the glass. The smell is a complex fruit composition, with sweet scents of caramel. Tasting this ""nectar"" I felt like I had a turbocharged IPA. I guess this is what it is representing. Up front we have the fruity notes like peach ,apple, fig, and of course sweeter aromas like honey and caramel malts. In the middle some earthy undertones, like pine and resin balance the sweetness somewhat and a composition of flowery hops finish the palette. There is even a hint of a citrus linger. A wonderfully crafted beer, the ABV very well hidden, but noticeably. Well worth the 15 bucks per bottle I had to stretch in Maryland ( 9 percent alcohol tax ). Can't wait to taste this beer when it is aged in the cellar for a year. Must be experience!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Spump78,4.43,I Had to stalk the few stores that were expecting shipments just to get my hands on a few bottles down here in Miami. Needless to say I was pretty excited to get my hands on this gem.  Poured a beautiful orange copper color with a light tan head. The aroma was a fruity with some pine notes and the alcohol smell was quite strong but was still disguised somewhat by the hoppiness. Taste is quite good. Pretty much follows the nose but I tasted less alcohol than I smelled. Much sweeter than I had expected but there is enough bitterness to help balance it out nicely. It is quite an experience on the palate. I expected for it to have more of an alcohol bite in the mouth but didn’t really feel like 18% ABV until the warmth was sliding down my throat. Can’t wait to see what a few years will do to the rest of the batch.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,GreenJetta912,4.28,"After a 3 year journey, I finally found one of these damn things. I bought them all when I saw them.  Poured into a Belgian Goblet (for lack of a snifter). Small amount of head with average retention an great lacing. Lighter color than i expected.  The smell is crazy. I've never smelled anything like this. It's a pungent and actually somewhat unpleasent smell. there's booze and what smells kinda like hops and kinda like cheese. Malty sweetness is covered up by competing flavors.  Taste is pretty damn good. Thank the beer gods, that aroma was beginning to worry me. Obvious relation to it's brother beers, 60 and 90. It's more malty than I expected and less hoppy. Boozyness isn't too overbearing (considering the high abv) but takes away from the hoppiness more than I would like to see. There's a surprising amount of residual sweetness. Still drinks more like a beer than a liquor or wine.  Only word I can use to describe the finish is perfect. This one's a warmer too. I began to sweat a little after the first sip.  This beer was worth the hype (and 11bucks a bottle) in my opinion. I stongly beleive a year or two in the cellar will do magical things to it. I'd give it 2 years and this beer will be emaculate. Luckily I have another, and I think that's what I'll do to it.  BTW- this was from the batch in 2011 that ended the 20 month hiatus.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,DucksFan16,4.07,"Pours a dark orange with an off white head. Aroma is intense, it smells amazing, almost like being in a flower garden. Flavor is very sweet, syrupy, and extremely hoppy. For the amount of hops and alcohol it is remarkably balanced. You need to try this at least once. This IPA is extreme!  02/28/2015 - Re-rate.

10099,9086,Azurescens,3.88,"12oz bottle 2011 batch poured into Hair of the Dog tulip, reviewed on 6/29/11.  A: Pours a clear golden orange with thin light tan head that leaves some lacing around glass.  S: Sweet with burnt caramel, smoky malt notes and some herbal and pine hops that mingle with all the malt, surprisingly very little detectable alcohol. As it warms the alcohol does come out quite a bit more but doesn't overpower the malt and hop aromas.  T: Starts out pretty sweet with some hop bitterness, lots of caramel and brown sugar up front which gives way to some alcohol but not nearly as much as I was expecting given the 20% ABV sticker on the side of the bottle. As the alcohol fades the flavor becomes more hop forward with herbal, pine and some citrus notes. Leaves a lingering taste of sweet, resinous hops. Like the aroma, the alcohol comes out as it warms, but doesn't overpower.  M: Medium-full bodied with lower carbonation. Quite sticky and resinous feel, finishes sweet.  O: I was a bit skeptical about this beer at first, cramming so much alcohol into an ""IIPA"" but after trying it, I will admit I am pretty impressed, this is truly extreme brewing. You can tell that this is a high ABV beer, but I wouldn't have guessed it was 20%. You really get a nice warming feel in your gut after each sip.

10099,9086,dhvnu,3.8,"This is one interesting ""DIPA"". I am not very sure about the old batches ( before 2011), but this year's one is less of an IPA, more of a fruit/vegetable beer.  120 minute boiling have definitely- adversely- impacted its hoppiness, more sugar have come up instead of hops.  I have to disagree with its claim for "" holy grail for hopheads"". but, it IS very interesting. The intense alcohol content is pretty much unnoticeable.  N- fruit-pine carnival L-amber+golden T-sweet Jack fruit ! yes, Sweet Jack Fruit period M.F-easy,appealing O-interesting,  Must try. Coz this is an intense beer , especially for how it maintain that sweetness while carrying so much alcohol !  just finished the last sip.. ah !",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,chilly460,4.25,"A - Dark orange, murky appearance. Thin head of medium tan, minimal lacing. Has a ""rich"" look to it.  S - Wow, more of a barleywine aroma is first thing I notice. Ripe oranges, lemon, caramel, and plenty of brown sugar.  T - Wow, again. Hard to describe this one, basically take lemon and orange combined with a liberal dose of brown sugar...backed with sweet caramel malts. This is a load of flavor, backed up with a warming booze that you'd expect from a 40 proof beer.  M - Big, big DIPA, very chewy, thick and appropriate for this big a beer. Mild carbonation.  O - Just an all around ""interesting"" beer. Huge flavors meld together nicely, this bottle was 2yrs old and had mellowed into a great tasty beverage.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,ThePorterSorter,4.37,"Long awaited, one of the most coveted beverages on the market today.  Appearance: Rich, dark with no haze and a thin, wispy white head. The head disappears quickly and there is very little lacing. I was expecting sludge to pour out of the bottle given reviews, but this looks like a relatively tame beer, although dark for an IPA.  Smell: Uncharted Hop Territory. This beer provides incredible dankness that is exclusively devoted to the hops added. Simple aromatic bliss with a stinging alcohol that is almost completely covered by the hops. The alcohol being covered this much is unexpected, I can only imagine the amount of hops necessary. When the beer warms the alcohol begins to pack a punch, almost making you cough with a sniff.  Taste: Fortified and truly a beer pushed to its limits. The hops are incredibly strong and resonate on my palate. There is also a syrupy sweetness and stinging alcoholic bite that helps compete with the hops for attention. Bitterness melds with sweetness, but the alcohol rules the palate. Straight ethanol aftertaste, do not blow out any candles.  Mouthfeel: I would like to draw a comparison between this beer and some dry hopped mead I had in Portland, ME. This beer is almost 50% stronger and is approximately twice as hoppy, but it's the only beverage that has come close to comparison. The body of this beer leans towards medium, but is definitely hearty. Sip this beer slowly, each sip is incredibly flavorful.  Overall: What a purchase. By volume this may have been one of the most expensive beers I've ever purchased. I am sad that I had to pay so much, but understand that the product is truly superior to other beers I've had. I can't imagine drinking several of these in a sitting, or even one whole one for that matter, but have no reservations about the purchase.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,mfunk9786,4.35,"2011 bottle, about a week after bottling.  I've never had this beer fresh before so I've never thought it was fair to review it, it is an IPA at the end of the day. Dogfish Head has succeeded in making what is essentially a pure hop extract. The beer pours a perfectly filtered orange with a respectable head of about a half-pinky's height. Smells like big hop oils, with that signature DFH sweetness and the most uncanny Chinese Orange chicken sauce aroma (and I mean that in a good way). Taste is huge, perhaps too huge. Big bitterness from the hops that brings out a dirty, earthy orange rind character and heavily boiled hop essence followed by cloying molasses sweetness and a finish on the tongue that's somewhere between an evaporating shot of liquor and a light and fizzy cane sugar soda. This beer, especially if you plan to drink the whole bottle, is a big-time sipper, so don't expect to finish a glass within a matter of a mere few minutes. This, if anything, is an impressive achievement, as close to a downright oddity as I've experienced in the beer world.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,ktrillionaire,3.89,"On-tap at Hoptomic. 2009 Vintage. Pours quite still and syrupy, with an appearance not too dissimilar form Polish Mead, which, incidentally, it resembles in more ways than one. The nose offers unmitigated sweetness in suggestions ranging from golden raisins to honey or mead, but despite the high ABV, alcohol is not strongly noted. The flavor carries the aroma's torch, with an addition of a modicum of actual piney hoppiness, which is impressive given the circumstances. Mouthfeel-wise, it is silky and slick; pretty good, again, given the 18%+ circumstance. Overall, it is enjoyable, and something I would consider should I have a Utopias craving and no Utopias.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Wadsey,2.55,"120 Minute Ale, bottled on 7/08/08 and consumed on 6/14/10.   Served in DFH signature glass  A: Pours murky amber with brown lowlights. Head and lacing are unimpressive, which is to style. No effervescence is detectable.   S: Pureed golden raisins, nail polish remover/solvent, candy sugar, alcohol and some burnt caramel.   T: Super sweet on front of palate, mixed with golden raisins and burnt caramel/brown sugar. Dried apricots. Mild bitterness. Nail polish remover/solvent and fusels figure prominently and detract from taste. The sweetness becomes cloying as I work my way through bottle.   M: Big body and mild carbonation result in syrupy mouthfeel. Mouthcoating and obvious warming.   O: Despite its obvious deficiencies, 120 Minute Ale has some charm if it is compared to English Barleywines and high-octane doppelbocks. Perhaps more aging would iron out 120 Minute Ale's flaws and propel it to the upper echelon of big abv beers. At 3 years, almost all hops, both aromatic and bittering, are a distant memory, allowing sweetness to run rampant and booze to be unchecked.

Very little head that was white, dissipated very quickly.  S - Sugary caramel, lemons, oranges, earth.  T- Wow, very interesting. It is like a huge fight is going on between the hops and the sweet malts. Lots of caramel, toffee, butterscotch followed closely with the fruits (oranges, tangerine, lemon, even some apple).  M - Considering it is 18%, surprisingly not too hot. It is quite sweet and tacky, feels like it coats your throat.  O - I actually enjoyed this one. It has syrupy feel to it and the sweetness didn't completely overpower some of the more subtle fruit and hop flavours.

T- Kind of sour, apple, caramel malt, brown sugar and light molasses. It was a little citrusy, maybe some orange and lemon zest with some dark, fruity notes like dates.  M- Not too bad for 3 years of age, descent carbonation that even stings a bit, full bodied and the alcohol is pleasantly warming. The alcohol is definetely not over powering by any means.

The head is insubstantial, and leaves only faint traces of lacing behind.  The aroma is dominated by a large alcohol and hop presence, despite the nearly five years of aging.  The taste is very bold and assertive, with notes of sweet fruits and a lot of booze. Hop presence is still there, though less forward than in a fresh bottle. The beer is more of an American barleywine than double IPA.  This is a seriously high octane beer. Three to four ounces is more than enough. A 12 oz. bottle could easily be shared four to six ways.

Poured into my dfh snifter, shared with a good friend. Pours a MURKY dark dark orange, bordering on brown color. Completely opaque. Smell- buttery, sugary, some vinegar, spice, apple. Wow. A lot going on here. Taste- some astringency, a warm buttery flavor, sweet apple. Almost a tart type finish- This is very very complex. So much going on in this beer. Mouthfeel- it has lost a lot of its carbonation, but you don't even miss it here. Something about the crisp tart finish of the beer doesn't even make you think about the potential flatness of the beer. Drinkability- especially improves as it warms. Came out of my cellar at 55 degrees, and didn't really reveal itself fully until almost an hour passed. This is an epic beer....and truly demonstrates why you age beer and what it can do.

Shocking that a brew of this gravity can retain head at all.  S: aged boozy malts dominate the aroma. And it's fantastic! Sweet malts, grains, aged booze, fruit.  T: esters greet you at the door and guide you all the way through. Warm, spicy, and fruity; sweet malts with tons of hops are the main attractions though. Aged booze adds a fantastic bit of complexity; truly interesting. This is why you age beer, folks. I could talk about this beer all day!  M: medium body, relatively low carbonation. I'm giggling as I dream of this brew on creamy nitro draft. That would be Utopia.  O: remarkably easy to drink for an 18% beer. Seriously, this one is dangerously mild on the alcoholic burn. Plus, it's so delicious. This is sooo far from your normal IPA -- it really shouldn't be considered an IPA at all. Much closer to an Old Ale than an imperial IPA. And just fantastic start to finish!

10099,9086,Knapp85,4.3,So I've had the opportunity to have this as a fresh release back in 2009 and as of last night I got to try an aged bottle from 2009. What a difference two years makes on this beer!  The first time I had this I bought a 4 pack directly from Dogfish Head in Milton after a brewery tour. I had drank 3 of the 4 over the course of time but only left one for aging. The fresh ones were very lively and bright colored orange. They had a nice head at first that settled into a thing covering over top. The smell was extremely hoppy and had a monster amount of booze on the nose too. The taste reminded me of a very strong fuzzy navel. It had from very fresh citrusy peach flavors going on in there and one hell of an alcohol burn in the throat. The mouthfeel was semi-thick but not really heavy. Overall it's a really impressive powerhouse of a beer.  The aging process transforms this IPA into something that I saw as more along the lines of a barley wine. The color had now become a darker shade of brown with a tan head that faded off just like the fresh batch. The smell was more earthy now but still had notes of the citrus that it once had. The taste has mellowed a bit. The massive citrus boost it had has now changed into something a bit more heavy and complex. The beer has because something like a hoppy barley wine to me.  I suppose that both versions are good but I prefer the fresh batch I think. Hopefully the people at DfH will be able to release this again one day so we can all enjoy or more this brew.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

The head had decent retention and left some lacing behind on the glass.  S - There is a big sweet caramel maltiness. It is balanced by a big hop character and some booziness. I am also getting notes of brown sugar, pineapple, apricot, raisins, and oranges. This truly smells amazing.  T - This is definitely unlike any beer i've tasted before. Up front there are big flavors of caramel malts, hops, and citrus. There are beautiful hints of fruits both tropical and dark. There is a nice piney and citrus hop character that perfectly balances out the sweet malts. There is some alcohol presence, but for the most part it is devilishly hidden. I am also getting some wood flavors coming through. The finish has some lingering sweet fruitiness, hop bitterness, and a bit of booziness.  M - It has a full body and lower carbonation. It goes down very smooth, and has a rich and creamy character to it. It has a bit of a chewy quality to it as well. It is quite sweet, but there is some nice hop bitterness to balance it out. Also, there is a touch of alcohol warmth in the finish.  O - This has great drinkability. It is definitely a sipper, but great drinkability none the less.

Amazing to me that I found it in Jacksonville, FL at Kickback's Gastropub when I live so close to the Dogfish Head Brewery. If you are nearby I highly recommend a stop for beer and the meatloaf. Trust me, it is life changing meatloaf.  Served in a bottle and poured into a Dogfish Head ""snifter."" The bottle had a 2008 stamp on it. Smelled very sweet and had a good aroma of hops and caramel. The first taste I was overwhelmed by sweetness and how the high alcohol content was almost non-existent. Good feel in the mouth but is somewhat syrupy and thick . Not a lot of carbonation or head. Follow on sips really brought out the layered hops but they were very faint and the more malty flavors seemed to be dominant. Very overwhelming with flavor. 12oz is about all I would recommend, and I wouldn't plan on driving yourself home either.  Overall I am very glad that I had the opportunity to get my hands on one of these rare breeds. It was worth it as I am a big fan of Dogfish Head 60 and 90 min IPAs as well. The 90 is by far my favorite. The rumor at the restaurant is that there are more in the back along with 2 Kegs of it as well, but who knows if its true or not.

10099,9086,BuxMontBeerLover,3.7,"Enjoyed this for the one and only time at the DFH Brewhouse in Rehobeth Beach, DE  Served in snifter glass. Serving size was 6-8 oz (I can't reacall)  A - A deep amber color with no head at all. When you swirl the beer around in the glass, you can actually see the beer stick to the sides. Appears rather thick/syrupy. Small amount of lacing left on the sides of the glass.  S - The alcohol is very present but a citrusy, piney and malty smell is also there.  T - Wow! This is a bold, bold beer! A mixture of cirtus, pine and malts that are really playing second fiddle to the alcohol. it is actually very sweet, almost too sweet. This is a true sipper.  M - Very thick and syrupy. Reminds me of the consistency of an after-dinner brandy. You can really feel the alcohol burn.  O - Glad I tried it but honestly the portion I was served was about all I would want to drink. I actually had a 12 oz. 90 minute before drinking this and after just the small serving of the 120, i needed to hand the car keys over to my fiance. It's a beer that is nice to try for the novelty of the 18% but not my favorite offering from DFH. Still worth a try just so you can see what all the fuss is about.

10099,9086,kraken6100,4.24,"12oz bottle, bottled 7/7/08, poured into a 14 oz snifter.  The appearance is a dusky vermillion, substantially darker than an amber or goldenrod. The lacing is clumping together, and looks like a pillowy stratus cloud along the top of the snifter.  The aromas are far and away my favorite element of this beer. Vinous, leathery, with sweet brown sugar, with weaker, yet prevalent elements of orange, concord grape, and toasted vanilla. Robust aromas that really complicate and test the olfactory.  The taste is so similar yet so strikingly different from the nose. Huge sweet front, retaining an alcohol heat. Tastes of lavender, vanilla, sweet citrus, caramel/brown sugar. A hop backbone is there, but certainly has tagged out and allowed the malt and caramel sweetness to have its time in the ring. I'm not sure I'm remotely capable of deciphering everything this has going on in the taste. Truly a beautiful and complex beer.  Despite the sweetness, I get no cloying and nothing that turns me off in terms of viscosity and sweetness. Surely a sipper, it's something I eagerly await an opportunity to revisit. I have three more from this batch, and am utterly intrigued by whatelse I may find in the future. Given the high gravity and that big malty fore, this isn't something that turns me off mouthfeel wise. Be aware, this is certainly a long-sipper, meant to enjoy and embellish in its aromas and complexity.  Overall, I just regret not having had the opportunity to try this back when it was fresh. I just got into cellaring and craft beer more recently than most, and don't know wha t crazy fresh beerness I'm reviewing this current incarnation against. Something to get excited about and something to seek out. I'm thoroughly impressed by what this beer has had to offer top to bottom.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,alexkeil,4.42,"This beer by far is the most fascinating to me...bar the far the most drinkable high high alcohol beer made. It still has beer like qualities (hop flavor) but is more like a port wine..something you can drink on the rocks after a large meal. The residual sugars give it port like qualities and the body is thicker, but it is still light in color which is surprising. While expensive, it is still a better bargain than most wines and liquors... and a great conversation piece at parties.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

This was a memorable beer experience for me, both positive and negative.... Here is what I remember.  A: Poured into a pint glass (probably wouldn't choose this next time) Thick, rich caramel with little head. Very little carbonation.  S: RICH caramel, molasses, brown sugar. I don't recall any real hops. Looking back, it is more like a Barleywine.  T: This is what threw me off. I have (still) never had such an overpowering beer. The viscosity alone was a turn off, it was just way too thick for my liking. The taste was definitely overwhelmingly sweet, all kinds of brown sugar/caramel and some fruit.  M: Again, too thick to enjoy.  O: I am willing to try this again, but my memory is of a very difficult to finish beer. It was just too much for me.

Burnt orange candy dances across your tongue. Carbonation is there but pretty minimal. There is a tiny alcohol feel to it on the backend. It is faint but certainly there.  One would think after five years this would be past its point, I beg to differ. This beer was rock solid.

A: Poured a hazy orange amber color with a finger thick head that slowly dissipates leaving some nice lacing down the side of the glass.  S: As soon as I poured it I could smell major caramel and molasses hitting the nose with great force. There is a bit of a boozy smell with some sweetness in it.  T: Very sweet taste, perhaps it is of the caramel and molasses malts. There is major sweetness throughout, with some fruits coming through as well. A bit of a boozy flavor as well. There are slight, very slight bitters in the finish. Yes, there are still slight hops in this DIPA.  M: Medium bodied, light carbonation. Very sweet and fruitish feel (if that makes any sense).  D: For being 18% ABV, there isn't much of an alcohol presence, or not as much as you would expect, which is kind of scary.

A - Pours a glowing golden-amber with just the thinnest of white heads. The beer is slightly syrupy and viscous, and clings to the glass when swirled, leaving behind wisps of lace. S - Easily one of the most unique beer smells in the world. Boatloads of honey, sweet malt, oranges, and pine resin with a bit of alcohol in the finish. Very floral and sweet smelling. T - Intense honey/hop flavors! This is pure hop juice, no doubt about it! Orange blossom honey, grapefruit, caramel, and pine resin all make themselves known with just the slightest taste of alcohol. M - Huge, sticky, viscous body with low carbonation. Surprisingly smooth, all that alcohol never really ""burns"". D - Well, It's obviously not that drinkable.

A: A murky golden copper color with a small off white head that fades to a bubble lake atop the brew. Good.  S: Super sweet and boozy scent upfront. I get some blackberries and raspberries upfront with some malty sugars quickly following. A hint of rubbing alcohol on the back. Ok.  T: Super sweet blackberries upfront quickly followed by a bready booze. Some hints of toffee and caramel on the back. More like a barleywine or old ale. Good.  M: Medium body with a great carbonation. A dry finish. Good.  D: The booze is definitely obvious in this one. Decent.  All in all, this is a great brew, but definitely not an IPA.

Aroma is lots of citric hops, honey malt sweetness, discrete oak/wood notes and also some booze. Very strong smell to this beer.  Taste begins very sweet and candied with marmelade and mollasses. Citric and oily hops (orange, tangerine) follow but the sweetness prevails over them. Some oak notes come through in the end. Finish / aftertaste is kinda bitter and roasted (imagine caramelizing a sweet sugary IPA on a pan).  Body on this one is huge as expected. Carbonation is medium. Definitely a sipper with very low drinkability. The ideal serving size for this beer is 4 oz (I got it in a flight).  A nice sipping beer to have by the fireplace.

Liquory clinging lace.  S = Hopy! Heavy liquor smell reminding me of a mix of a young brandy and an aged sherry.  T = Good carbonation. Fruity of plum and apricot. Roasted pumpkin. Heavy tanin for no wooden barrel processing. Sweet. Sweet. Sweet. Sweet. Did I mention sweet? Reminded me of a carbonated after dinner cordial. Dare I say my mothers Harveys Bristol Cream?  M = Tingling carbonation on the front end. Sticky but silky smooth finish.  D = This was fun to try, but I could barely finish the bottle. The first few mouthfuls were enjoyable and interesting.

Taste was not balanced, too much of a malt and hop nuclear weapon with nothing in the brew to even it out. Smooth and soft, mouthfeel alone is not bad at all. Not very pleasing to imbibe on. This could be a great beer, but it stops short, unfinished. Strong alcohol and hops, but disjointed.

S: Smells extremely fresh, extremely sweet with lots of grapefruit. I get some pine, but it is really light and different than most pine aromas on IPAs, hard to place it though. Get some caramel malts on the end.  T: Lots going on here. Extremely sweet and candied. Has a honey flavor and citrus hops, very earthy. The grapefruit comes through as does some orange peel. On the first sip there was a little bit of alcohol, but the rest of it surprisingly did not have much of a booze presence.  M/D: Thick and creamy. Much smoother than anticipated. Very fine bubbles give it a really nice mouthfeel. The alcohol was there a bit, but really not that bad. Its a sipper for sure, but I really didn't have trouble drinking it at all.

The smell is of medicine. Cough syrup, malts, hops a little line pine-cleaner.  The taste is worse than the smell. Is this really a DIPA? A TIPA? Tasted like an overly sweetened malty boozy barley wine with some hops thrown in (or pine-scented cleaner). It was not refreshing and I couldn't even nurse it. It's just not a good flavor. Perhaps they need more testing of what's leaving the brewery? Or maybe it's just a high alcohol gimmick? I'm a hophead, IPA lover.  This is a beer you drink on a dare. It's not drinkable.

Light head with a bit of lacing. Lots of grapefruit, sweet orange, and fresh bread, a bit of piney hops on the nose. Velvety mouthfeel. Just a bit of bite on the front of the tongue, quickly disappears into a very grapefruity, sweet citrus, and a bit of herbal hops. Very surprisingly, the hops are not obnoxiously overdone. The peppery alcohol is very dominant, but the 21% is VERY well hidden. Bitterness of cooked apple on the finish. This was one of my first extreme beers and one I had to shell out big bucks for.

10099,9086,HopHed,4.35,"APPEARANCE: A dark amber nearly light orange in color with very little, almost no really, head that dissipates very quickly with no trace.  AROMA: A sweet, malty, slightly biscuity smell with a definite note of alcohol. Emphasis here is on the sweet side. Very reminiscent of a Barleywine.  FLAVOR: My first reaction was still that it reminded me a bit of a barley wine, but sweeter. There were strong malt, caramel, and (maybe) some molasses notes. But this was all about the sweet in the mouth. After swallowing a strong tingle, nay heat, of alcohol comes on. The heat lingered pleasantly like a fine Scotch or a nice Cognac.  PALATE: Definitely full bodied beer, sweet, hot, and wonderful.  MOUTH FEEL: A thick, extremely rich, very light carbonated beer that coats the mouth with sweetness, and ends with a hot heat of alcohol.  NOTES: The beer is rich, thick, flavorful, and the 18.0% ABV comes through quite obviously. This is a beer that you drink, more likely than not, as a special occasion beer. Like you would have a nice Scotch or Cognac. The 120 Min is definitely a beer that opens up as it nears room temperature, you need to let it warm to fully appreciate it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

I was inspired to open this one after watching the Brewmaster episode where they were comparing the older versions and they deemed the 2006 the best. I thought it was time to try it.  I served this 12 oz. brown bottle in a Chouffe tulip glass. The body was a rich golden color. Clear and bright. The second pour made it a little hazy, but still beautiful. The head was modest and left only a light ring of white bubbles.  The smell was deep marmalade and brandy. Malty. Very well hidden alcohol. Complex and interesting.  The taste was worth the wait! The flavors mirrored the aroma. Sweet marmalade and mellow alcohol. Complex but everything worked together. A sweetness coated the palate without becoming cloying. It served to balance the alcohol well. Hops oils and syrupy malts melded together better than it sounds.  The mouthfeel was smooth but expanding carbonation gave it a liveliness. Even the mouthfeel was complex. This has turned into a world class beer. Finally a DFH beer I can love. Generally I'm not a big fan - I don't like the their 60 and 90 min. IPAs at all.

The head was nice and white with medium lacing.  S: The intense amount of hops and malt quickly bombard the senses with a sickly sweet and boozy aroma. I find myself thinking of raisins and prunes and molasses as well as deep dark citrus.  T: Incredible flavor, it is extremely sweet and malty, the hops have not left any bitter notes, instead a dark floral taste that seems to get drowned as the alcohol of this 18% beer comes through. As the beer warms the flavors only intensify and the malt overpowers the alcohol and a deep fruity and spicy flavor resides.  M: Almost no carbonation, instead is a rich thick sweet heavy bodied drink that leaves the mouth tingling and the temples warm from the boozy punch.  D: Not something I could have more than one of and at that with a good distance between them, but still an unbelievably complex and deep beer meant for a cold night and a good snifter.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Small bubbles rise slowly up the sides of the glass.  Very sweet malty smell with lots of hops coming over the top. Alcohol wafts upward with a somewhat brandy-ish aroma, increasing in intensity nicely as it warms.  Taste explosion, nothing like what I expected. Very, very sweet. Lovely malts accent a spicy hops backbone. Some great brown sugar and citrus flavors too. Highly complex.  Rich, full, almost chewy mouthfeel. Carbonation is pretty tangy, even in the older bottles.  The more I've had this beer, the more I like it. It's a specialty beer to me, not really a DIPA. It's almost a hops liqueur. Very delicious tho, I will be seeking out more of this at all times.

Pours a thick dark golden with the shimmer that tells you there is a lot of booze/sugar in there and with much more head than expected. Actually looks fantastic. Smell is almost fusel alcohol and intense sugary. The smell is essentially not good. The taste, however, is sublime. Sweet like an aged American Barleywine with faded hops in the middle the finishes with slight bitterness. There is an almost bready sweetness present throughout that I don't find cloying and somehow seems in balance with the rest of the beer. Great mouthfeel, with good carbonation and that thickness the beer essentially has to posses.

10099,9086,OneDropSoup,3.97,"Got this particular bottle from bstaffor in the Hoppy Summer to You BIF. Thanks, Brian!  Not sure of the year. Poured into a tulip pint: Three fingers of glistening, pillowy head with some peaks over medium-russet body. Hazy with burnt orange highlights. Leaves stripes of lacing.  Smells like a creamy orange liqueur or even a little like cognac. Cooked citrus, apricot, pineapple, with this surrounding ""baked good"" character tying it all in: caramel, sugary, a little toasty, like sticky buns or slightly overdone angel food cake. Rich smell, delicious & almost overwhelming. There's definitely some booze there too, but not as potent as I'd expected. Hoppiness is played down compared to the sugars, but gives it a little bite, like there's something lurking there. Complex is an understatement.  Whoa! Sweetness really hits at first, like candied oranges or pineapple upside down cake - strong & kind of cloying. The sugars really wrap around the palate & do some neat tricks, all under a citrus umbrella. I can tell the alcohol's there, but it blends with the flavors well, there's surprisingly little heat or booze taste, just a nice twist at the end. Good, but man, a little of that malty sugar goes a long way, way into the aftertaste, with some residual orange zest.  Full-bodied & chewy, nice & smooth without any burning sensation. Lots of mouth-coating sugars afterward, this one will stick with you with each sip.  I enjoyed this better than I remember - maybe once I knew how sweet it was, my expectations were calibrate & I was just ready to embrace it. So much more like a barleywine than an IPA, this is a sweet mother with almost no bitterness. The alcohol isn't that apparent while drinking, but I definitely feel a little goofy after half of a glass.

Held up to light, it's almost totally opaque, with a deep amber coloring that varies depending on the width of the glass.  S: Big nose - despite the other reviews here, the alcohol of this bottle was very apparent, but was balanced by a sweet malt aroma with strong hints of hops and orange.  T: Being a big fan of the 60 and 90 Minute IPA, I was prepared for a big hop hit, but was pleasantly surprised. The hops were very balanced by the heavy malt and citrus flavors, all of which cut through what would otherwise be a very heavy alcohol flavor.  M: This is where this bottle shined. A thick, and almost cream-like mouthfeel. Hints of alcohol warmed the tongue and throat, but didn't overwhelm.  D: I'd drink this like I would a brandy or a cognac. A bottle by myself would probably be enough for an evening.

10099,9086,uberkane,4.52,"2006 Vintage  A: Poured into my trusty Chimay goblet. This beer was the color of hazy apple cider. Not too much of a head and some lacing.  S: The smell was intense; a lot of hops with some interesting underlying fruit scents and sugars.  T: The taste was massive and complex. The hops were there big time, but as appose to a big spicy hop flavor, it was a more complex fruity, grassy hop flavor. I got a lot of grapefruit, as well as almost a buttery flavor. I also got a little bit of cannabis flavor in there too.  M: I could almost feel the hop resin in this beer. Also had a light carbonated feel, but not much.  D: This beer was surprisingly drinkable, and the 18% abv was incredibly well hidden. I expected to only sip it, but ended up taking some sizeable swigs. However, I did take the whole night to nurse it, so I would not call it a good session beer by any means.  Notes: I really enjoyed this beer. More then I wanted to, actually (due to the price)... I thought it would be a one-time novelty, but I could easily see myself drinking it again. I did have a fresh batch and it was a WHOLE different animal. Hops and alcohol were much more ferocious.

S- Very sweet, malty and rich aroma. The alcohol is present as well.  T- Definitely not your normal IPA. This beer is sweet and not overwhelmingly hoppy at all. The amount of hops used to brew this beer is incredible, but it balances the sweetness quite well. You do get some hop characteristics though, citrus/pine floral tastes. The alcohol offers a bold flavor as well. Can be a bit overwhelming in ""fresh"" batches.  M- Very smooth. Hardly any carbonation which provides a unique mouth feel. This is excellent on the palate.  D- This beer is certainly not for everyone! And at 18% this can be tempting to drink by yourself, but definitely is better sharing with some friends.

10099,9086,adamdrap,4.3,"Finally, I have been waiting to try this beer for years. Acquired a 2009 release from Caponoes in Norristown outside of Philly.  The pour is orange to dark amber, it tastes like an IPA, but with an extreme kick. The alcohol (18%) is very well hidden.  A floraly front with a sweet caramel after-taste. I am certain aging has done this brew well. An excellent beer from dogfish. I would recommend anyone to seek this beer out (if they can find it!). I can't wait for them to re-release this one!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

VERY GOOD.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,mikeg67,4.74,"12 oz bottle. Pours copper with no head and lots of carbonation. Aroma is of citrus hops, caramel malt , ripe fruit and licorice. Palate is similar, nicely balanced.

10099,9086,scootny,4.05,This is a ridiculous beer. Bottled on 11/05/08 it pours like a regular IPA which considering the abv is insane. A good head that stays forever and leaves lot of lace. Smell is lots of malt and a decent amount hops but not as much as you would expect. There is an alcohol/solvent/cleaning fluid facet as well. Lots of pine. Taste is not for the faint of heart. Super sweet malt and syrup. A large fruit flavor dominates. Orange really. Huge amount of hops to keep it in check and still it is more sweet than bitter. Having said that the finish is entirely owned by the buds. Super clean and dry with enough hop oil to hack through the high gravity sugars. Mostly pine in nature there is just enough grapefruit to cut and dry your mouth so you keep coming back. Feel is just short of thick and chewy. It is surprisingly close to your run of the mill DIPA. Carbonation is lively and right where you want it. Any more and the flavors get out of control any less and you are drinking syrup from the bottle. Drinkability is much better than it should be. Yes you sip it but I find myself sipping faster and faster. An awesome AND ridiculous beer.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Alot of fragrance in the nose, caught some hop oil as well as a sweet syrupy smell. Mouthfeel is sticky and full, coats the mouth and stays around. Taste is serious! alot of carmel and raisions maybe. I bought this beer over a year ago, and am very pleased with how it has changed.

Pours a light brown almost burgundy colour with a very thin head that didn't stick around too long. Nice lacing on the glass. Smells like caramel, slight hops and warm alcohol. Very thick mouthfeel that brought forth a sweet caramel and brown sugar taste. There is a faint hop presence that hags out in the cheeks and sides of the tongue. Very complex each sip gave way to new flavours. I have to say it was much sweeter than I thought it would be, but still one of the best I have tried. Would love to try one fresh to see how it differs from the 3 1/2 year old one I had.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Bmoyer0301,4.3,"*2006 Vintage *  Appearance:  Tonight I reached for my new Dogfish Head goblet on this hefty ale, and as I proceeded to pop the cap off there was a moderate amount of carbonation which really surprised me due to the high ABV and extended aging time. On the pour, I decided to go straight on to try and entice any form of head from the syrupy liquid. As more and more beer hit the bottom of the glass, a thin amount tan bubbles formed on the top and hung around the edge of the walls very faintly. When I hold the glass up to the light there is a hazy deep golden brown appearance almost like non burnt toast that has just a few stray bubbles lingering around. When I give the glass a generous swirl there is a lot of lacing sliding very slowly down the wall of the glass.  Smell:  Right of the start there is a huge burst of caramel and brown sugar rolled in raisins. There is absolutely no aroma of hops here, but being that it is this far along in age it resembles more of a barleywine, than an IPA. In the finish there is some heat alcohol that resembles a wonderful aged brown rum and some oak.  Taste:  Man oh man, this is the exact reason why I take beers and age them. This is nothing and I mean nothing like a fresh bottle which can be quite offensive and to boozy for some palates. Up front there are so many flavors going on like; toffee, caramel, dark fruits and of course alcohol. Again, there is no hops to be mentioned of and to be honest I don't care at all because this is just bliss. The sweetness is the main feature here and if you don't mind a really great dessert styled beer this is it. The mouth feel is super thick and almost coats your tongue with the resin from the faded hop oils which is a wonderful addition to the taste. In the finish there is a warming sensation that is almost like sipping on a great whiskey Manhattan and this bottle will last me for quite a while as I am drinking very slowly.  Drinkability:  Overall this was a great choice for my after dinner dessert and I am really glad that I have been aging this for for three years now. I would recommend that if you come across this beer be sure to get a few bottles. I really think you will enjoy the experience of trying it over a several years. Considering this is 18% ABV it drinks very easily and one bottle can be shared by a few people if you don't feel like the huge head rush from the whole twelve ounces and for $8 it is a pretty cheap buy.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

10099,9086,matt20102,3.02,"Served from bottle into goblet at about 40F form a 2009 bottle. This is a interesting beer, no doubt. The initial aroma is of cider and whiskey- no doubt due to the ridiculous amount of malt present in the wort. The aroma is strong- much stronger than I'm used to from any other beer. The flavor is very sweet and syrupy- somewhat too sweet to be very drinkable. Surprisingly enough there is almost no taste of alcohol or hops- the sugary sweetness of this brew masks everything else. There is an obvious skill to making a beer this extreme but the results are less than wholly enjoyable on flavor alone.

10099,9086,beer2day,4.42,"3 year old bottle aged in the back of the beer fridge.  Pours ruby gold with 1/2 finger head. No retention. Fairly active carbonation for an older bottle. Thin lace.  Strong dried fruit nose. Apricots, figs, grapes, apples, but mainly raisin. Lots of it. Strong whiff of alcohol.  I think I actually pick up the strength of the pour before the beer touches my lips. Alcohol hits right away. Sweet and syrupy up front, with lots of raisin and fig. Grows quite tart midway through. Lots and lots of alcohol in the finish, leading to a substantial burn in the throat. Definite hop presence as well, but the dried fruit completely overshadows that. Getting some light apricot and I think some floral esters.  Very syrupy feel. Pushes the limit here.  Quite a nice sipper, but as I remember my first SA triple bock I wonder how far this has pushed the envelope on what is considered beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

M-medium carbonation, slightly creamy and slightly dry finish  D-surprisingly next to no alcohol note or burn. this is very impressive to me. this is definitely best shared with someone or else it might be your only beer of the night. it tastes great all the way through!!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,claspada,4.02,"First off I just want to say that from every beer person I know, including myself, this beer should be aged for approximately 1 year for maximum enjoyment. Over a year the hop profile will begin to evaporate (over 3 years and it will have none!) and under a year and it is too cloying and not (alcohol wise). As an IPA this beer should be consumed within a year of bottling regardless of the ABV, suggested bottle aging, please, trust me!  Aromas are of malt sweetness, with some earthy hops attempting to show their face, but the caramel/sugary aroma overwhelms, for sure.  The taste starts off with caramel/toffee/brown sugar sweetness, but then as the beer warms you get the subtle apple cider, light stone fruitiness and pitted figs. The body is rather smooth with a medium body, even a creamy feel under the tingly and generous bubbly texture.  Overall this is a great drink/beer. Its strength makes me not even want to call it a beer but it is definitely a nice sipper, it may not feel tremendously assertive early on but holds its own very enticingly as it progresses.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

T- Incredibly sweet, along with raisins, prunes, alcohol, molasses and carmalized sugar. I didnt taste hops or bitterness.  M- Thick, syrupy, very light carbonation, very, warming on the throat, towards the end a portion of my lip was slightly numb.  D- One or possibly two could be consumed. Obviously the abv and sugar content of this prevents one from drinking a lot.  Overall I was a little disappointed, to me this was much more like a barley wine than an imperial IPA. I drank it more for the novelty of drinking something that strong. I would drink it again, but the price prevents this from being a regular.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

10099,9086,devilben02,3.75,"Had the chance to share this one with a buddy who was pulling from his special occasion stash to celebrate his birthday. This particular bottle had been aged for a little over a year. It poured from the bottle with a muddy, reddish-amber color and a respectable cream-colored head.  The aroma was unexpected and strange, with a sweet combination of grape juice and sugar syrup contrasting against citrusy hops, and only a touch of the big alcohol content creeping in. The flavor was likewise interesting, with notes of raisins and candied oranges making it seem more like a (mildly) hop-infused fortified wine than a beer. For all of the dry-hopping that goes into this recipe, it was not potently bitter. Instead, the syrupy, fruity sweetness is slightly more dominant, although not to the point of being overly cloying.  It had a big-bodied but silky texture, and although it certainly tasted and felt boozy, it goes down just fine if treated like a fine liqueur. Overall, this one was so interesting and different, I wish NC allowed for its sale so that I could grab a couple more bottles.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Sweet, syrupy with notes of grape and pure sugar cane. The hops are muted, but isnt that the point here. At 18%+, what do you expect? This is an after dinner drink, one you could sit down to with a cigar and relax with. Great job to Dogfish Head and they're forward thinking on beer. We need to look at beer as an art, not a bitter sparkling mess. Beer is the new wine, think of it in that fashion and then try this again.

A-Pumpkin bronze with filtered clarity and a thin white head that settles into a thin ring. Not surprising given the ABV.  S-Hops and turpentine. Somewhere behind all of this there is a hint of sweet caramel malt. Only a hint. This does not smell like something I want to put in my mouth.  T-Overpowering maple-like sweetness is the first impression, along with some dark fruits. The brew effervesces on the palate, and the hops kick in as this rolls over the tongue. Think Maple syrup with hop cones and grain alcohol thrown in and that pretty much sums it up. I was actually surprised and expected a much hoppier brew.  M-Full creamy mouthfeel with slight under-carbonation.  D-Ok, so much for the hype. I appreciate the uniqueness and can say I tried it. Bought two bottles and will give the other away as a novelty.

10099,9086,portia99,3.93,"12oz bottle (date has rubbed off, but this is at least 4 years old) poured into a Dogfish Head signature glass. Very interested to see how this has held up over the years.  A - Bottle opens with a nice whoosh of carbonation. A rather firm pour down the center of the glass raises a 1/2 finger of off white, creamy foam that actually hangs around for a few minutes, slowly falling. Pretty impressive for an 18% beer. Some light foamy lacing clings to the glass...again, just a bit surprising - pleasantly. A mostly clear deep orange amber color with lots of fine streams of carbonation rising nicely from the bottom of the glass.  S - Surprisingly hoppy up front given the age, although it is obvious that the aroma has faded greatly from its initial intensity. Still manage to get quite a bit of pine and grapefruit. A nice layer of sweetness sits behind the hops. I get notes of raisins, honey, caramel and toffee. I would also say that there is a sweetness contribution from the ethanol as well as some phenolics and an overall boozy aroma.  T - Super sweet up front. Candi sugar, very sweet maltiness, honey...almost syruplike. Citrusy hops, a bit of a green hop flavor. There is some bitterness here from the hops, which I guess does balance this out some, but they really can't compete with the high sugar levels in here. The only thing that stands up to the sweetness is the alcohol. There is a strong alcoholic, boozy flavor in here that really overpowers everything else. In a way, this reminds me of Southern Comfort...doesn't taste the same, but just the level of alcohol combined with the syrupy sweetness - same basic effect.  M - Very full bodied with a smooth and creamy lower level carbonation. Despite the syrupy thickness, this beer just slides over the tongue in an almost oily sorta way. The alcohol first catches me on the inhale in a ""take your breath away"" fashion as it overpowers the oxygen in the air and eventually rests in the back of your mouth and throat with a mild burn. Alcohol and a fruitiness beyond by capability to describe is left behind after the swallow. This is a pretty unique beer.  D - Hmm, how to describe the drinkability of an 18% beer. Well, it's not the best thing I've ever had, but it is unique and interesting. A sipper for sure, although I'm sure I'm plowing through this way too fast and it's gonna hurt. Can't say that I'm looking for another beer after this one is done. At this point I'd lean heavily towards calling this a barleywine instead of a DIPA. Maybe I should have waited another couple of months for some cooler weather, but I've been staring at this in my fridge for too long...it had to be done. This is almost liquor like and definitely more fitting as an after dinner drink than anything else.

10099,9086,marvin213,3.38,"Credit where credit is due: DFH almost always looks great, and this is no different. The beautiful hop label quite fairly and distinctly lends life to this liquid hop bomb. The dark brown, tan, bronze beverage has a thin foam cap that sizzles to a dew-like web.  The smell is strong and sappy sweet. It's like this syrup came straight from the side of a tree. It's definitely got a medicinal, Pine-Sol sort of aroma...because it's strong as shit!  A simple sip suggests a regular IPA...at first...but then, I've got to wait for the swallow. I flashback like Ego in Ratatilloue to my teenage times sipping vodka in a tree house. Again, each sip initially seems so normal...but the small sip packs such a punch that I just about grimace to get 'er down. This full pint glass is menacing! I think my forehead is sweating as I wonder if I'm tough enough. The taste isn't average--it's probably worse--but the beer is such a novelty item that I've got to grade it up.  It feels like an out-of-control freight train. Like Axl in the eighties, it's loaded like a nighttrain. I take bigger saps--I mean sips--and wonder what this is like straight from the barrel. It stings in a sweet, sappy way. I shudder when I think of the YouTube video of the guy chugging this beer (OMG--the burp)! Though crazy shit like sucked me into craft beers like school skirts into Catholicism, my '08 bottle offers none of that yummy, enamel-ripping bitterness that I've come to expect from the best IIPAs. It is overly sweet.  Show me the man that drinks a six-pack of this, and I'll show you a man that needs to be hauled off to somewhere! Though that may hurt drinkability, this is such a neat, innovative beverage.

10099,9086,CHICOBEERMATT,4.55,"Now, listen. I have been wanting this ""living legend"" for a very long time and being that I am a West Coaster, trying to see even an empty bottle in person has been impossible. However, I finally got my hands on some yesterday thus, the review:  I have to begin with ""Exceeded all expectations"" as I was expecting something along the lines of an Imperial IPA or a Double IPA. Wrong. This wonderful and, dare I say, magical libation looks and pours like a blonde barley-wine, thick and syrupy, with low carbonation and a fairly non-existent head (which I was appreciative for). The color was dirty-blonde, creamy, cloudy and mysterious. I was absolutely in awe of this thing once it hit my glass. Like you would with a fine, aged barley-wine, I let it sit for a while to air - but not too long - because frankly, I couldn't wait as long as I perhaps should have. I had to remember: this isn't a barley-wine!  It drank slowly or, rather, I drank it slowly enjoying every small mouthful. The carbonation was more prevalent on the drink than on the pour and it added a nice spiciness. It was thick and syrupy and the words ""hop juice"" came to mind while drinking it. The labor that goes into making this beverage was blatantly apparent and I almost felt guilty drinking my 120 as I know how much work goes into a batch of this stuff. The alcohol was prevalent but not overpowering - but I like 'em strong anyway so perhaps I'm not the best judge of this aspect. But you can't drink it fast, in fact, it took me about an hour to finish.  I have four more bottles and I will lay down at least two of them for at least 2-3 years. I can't even begin to imagine how great they will be then.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Jeffo,2.79,"A heavyweight extra in a trade with NewGeneric. You really know how to spoil a guy. Thanks heaps!  From a bottle into a snifter  Note: Drunk all three in order, so this was the last to pour.  APPEARANCE: Pours a one finger, medium looking white head that crackles enough for me to notice. Decent retention on the head. Slightly cloudy tangerine orange in color with zero carbonation evident. Head slowly fades to a thin wisp and a ring that remain until the end and leave a few dots of lace down the glass. Very similar to the others in the series, with a slightly darker and cloudier color.  SMELL: Very similar to the others in the Minute series, except there's a nose burning amount of booze that likes to singe your nose hairs. Some pale malts, sweet pineapple and citrus notes are in there as well, but the alcohol is just too abrasive. Soapy industrial cleaner and chemical washing powder seem to push their way to the forefront here. Unnecessary.  TASTE: Much different than the others in the series, but not really DIPA like. Pale malts are there, as well as sweet melon and candy notes. Caramel malts and acidic hop resin make an appearance as well. Overall, this is quite sweet. Some pine and bitter hops at the end, but the sweetness and booze overpower. It's not quite as boozy as the nose had prepared me for though, which was a welcome surprise. No real industrial cleaner or anything. Sweet candy and boozy aftertaste is big, bold and long lasting. This is more like a geared up barely wine than a DIPA, and I guess it isn't bad if we think of it as such.  PALATE: Medium body and carbonation. Not creamy per se, but goes down surprisingly smooth without as big of a burn as I'd expected, and finishes quite oily and mouth-coating.  OVERALL: Certainly an extreme beer to say the least, even if I'd guess that this batch probably didn't get up to the 18% listed on the site. Nevertheless, this was an awesome brew to try and it was a lot of fun to do all three of the Minute series back to back to back. It was actually surprsingly drinkable for what it was. That said, this was my least favorite of the three, as it's simply too boozy and malty sweet for a DIPA. I am, however, forever grateful I had the chance to try it. Thanks a lot NewGeneric for making this one happen for me.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,StoneBrewFanatic,3.9,"A - Nice copper color when poured into my glass. Thin head that dissipates quickly and leaves decent lacing. It almost looked like syrup when it was being poured from the bottle to the glass.  S - Smell like sweet candy, caramel, pine, and grapefruit. I was hoping for a stronger hop aroma, but overall it is still pleasing.  T - A lot of pine right up front, but also a candy-like sweetness that is not often experienced. Grapefruit and a hint of orange, and then a slight bit of alcohol as it mellows into its malty finish.  M - This one has some body to it, but it is still nice and creamy.  D - This is a great beer to try once in a while or share with a fellow beer lover.  I look forward to trying this beer as fresh as possible when the next batch comes out. This one was over a year old and although I did enjoy it, it didn't really wow me as I had hoped.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,korguy123,4.15,"Special thanks to Robtobfest for this! 12oz poured into a snifter. (No bottling date)  A- Very hazy copper/straw color. Half finger off white head that settled to a tiny cloud of bubbles in the middle of my glass. Decent lacing. As I'm staring at my glass I can't get over the fact that it looks like I'm about to drink a glass of butterscotch syrup.  S- The alcohol does peak through but not as much as I was expecting. Grapefruit, pine, strong hop oils, sweet candy and hearty malt nose.  T- Pine right off the bat, sweet candy as it settles on your tonge, orange peel, pineapple, mild alcohol as the beer starts to warm. The hops do a good job at cutting through the alcohol IMO.  M- Creamy, smooth, sticky on the lips and a slight alcohol burn/warming feeling as you swallow.  D- Each sip was exciting and magical. I do put emphasis on the word ""sip"" this is something to be truly enjoyed at a slow pace.  I have to say after having a WWS and feeling sickened about how strong the alcohol came through in the nose and taste I was a little hesitant to try this. but I must say this really blew me away I enjoyed every sip of it and can't wait for August's batch to come my way to try one as fresh as possible.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

S-A tit load of alcohol in the scent. Really sweet/malty smell hiding behind the big alcohol smell. Not a lot of hops going into the schnoz.  T-Once the liquid enters my mouth I begin to frown. The shocking amount of booze transitions into a violently malty drink. Not a hoppy beer by any means. Incredibly rich but incredibly unsatisfying.  M-Syrup. Rich Syrup. Sticky and sweet. The booze clings to your tongue.  D- Well, any beer that is 18% will not be very drinkable to me. That being said, I had a hard time throwing back one bottle of this. Sweet honey booze bomb. Not my style.  Won't shell out 10 bucks for this again. Laughing at the fact this this is supposed to be some kind of DIPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Nose is alcohol, caramel and some citrus - mango, grapefruit, apricots, cherries, and dark fruit. Taste is VERY sweet and boozy. This is an IPA? Raisin, plum, sweet malts and the alcohol burn completely overpowered any hops for me. Mouthfeel is relatively heavy, creamy, and very syrupy. This is much too sweet and boozy for me. It certainly is a unique offering but I will take the 60 and 90 minute over this any day.

Dies down to a tight layer of foam on top. Really impressive for the abv.  Smells of...? I want to say blueberries, and raspberries. I made my sober gf smell it she said vinegar, and you know what she's right (at least when you take big whiffs of it). There's some notes modeling glue as well. Swear to God. Very weird. Hints of sweet malts.  Tastes of sweet honey, balsamic vinegar, blueberries, raspberries, and grassy/leafy/resin bitter hops. And rubbing alcohol.  Thick, syrupy, medium-low carbonation. Quite hot.  Not super easy to drink, but good considering the abv.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,exanimo,2.64,"I bought two bottles of this beer before going away for 6 months. Upon my return I was ecstatic to finally try this beer after I had only been drinking Chinese beers whilst in Beijing. On retrospect, I wish I had drank one of the bottles fresh and now I plan on having another without aging. After pouring into a pint glass, I first noticed the smell; incredibly boozy and apricot-y with a slight tinge of hops. The next thing I found was the deep orange/yellow and incredibly beautiful colored beer that sat below the white one fingered head. I was getting excited, even if I thought it smelled slightly too boozy.  As I brought my nose to the glass, the booze came out more than ever and I began to get nervous. When the beer hit my mouth, I found my fears came true and was brought to dismay. Thick, sticky sweet, and incredibly boozy were the first thoughts to come to mind. I stared at the empty bottle on the table just to double check that this is an IPA. The lack of hoppy-ness in the beer was so disappointing, it was more malty and boozy than anything. So much so that the subtle citrus fruit flavors were barely found. What a disappointment.  Halfway through the glass it wasn't the boozy-ness that was bothering me so much but rather the thick mouthfeel and sweetness. It felt like I was drinking alcohol soaked corn syrup. But gosh, was the lacing and retention wonderful looking on my glass.  An interesting take on the IPA for sure, but not what I have come to expect from one. I found myself thinking that perhaps this is what the beer tasted like on the old ships sailing to India. ...and it sure is more interesting than Yanjing or Tsingtao!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,zoso1967,3.68,"Surprisingly my usual pour leads to a decent sized parchment head that is quite creamy and has decent staying power. The beer itself is a fiery orange amber that looks dangerous. The aroma tells me this must be a pretty fresh bottle. It is malty for sure, but I am able to pick out a nice orange, grapefruit, apricot and sweet flowery hop bouquet as well. I've had this beer several times, and every time I seem to take something different away from the experience. It is extremely sweet with a very sugar cookie like pale malt profile. The hops are much less prominent than in the aroma, but I am still detecting the classic ""minute"" hop profile that this shares with its smaller siblings. Candied orange, apricot, pine and cidery sweetness. If this was a hoppy barley wine, it would be great, but for a triple IPA, not quite enough punch. If the ABV was toned down a bit I think this would be a real winner through and through. The body is full and thick, fairly syrupy really, with a finish that is a bit on the sticky icky side, but could be much worse. I just realized that I keep having to remind myself that this thing has a near 20% ABV. It is hot without a doubt, but not as hot as one would expect. This is a sipper and not all that drinkable, but I always welcome the chance to share a bottle with a friend.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

10099,9086,EbPhrygian,4.33,"After something of a beer review hiatus, I am back to comment on Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA, having purchased a bottle at a specialty beer store in Worcester, MA. There seems to be a lot of hype surrounding this beer, centered on the sheer ""bigness"" of it, but I'm not going to let that get in the way of an objective review. I'll start by saying though I have read others' reviews, I really don't know what to expect here, and I aim to review with a 'clean slate.'  Poured from a 12-oz bottle into a pint glass.  Appearance: One-finger off-white head. Pours a very rich amber, a similar color to 90 Minute, and looks harmless enough! Very clingy lacing from what I can tell at first.  Smell: I could smell this one immediately upon opening the bottle. Smells a little like brandy from a distance of about a foot or so, with a definite sugary sweetness. Upon closer sniff, the aroma is really quite pleasant. Citrusy, piney hops are there, making this smell like a beefed up 90 Minute. The alcohol is also there, however, and will not be ignored in the nose.  Taste: Oh man, this tastes pretty incredible...Syrupy sweet and only burns a little bit on the way down. As complex as I had hoped, featuring notes of orange and a caramel maltiness (a surprise considering this was only brewed in February). The hoppiness is simply overshadowed by the sweetness, therefore it doesn't seem as hoppy as, say, Victory Hop Wallop. My sister says it 'tastes like ham.'  Mouthfeel: I feel like I need to brush my teeth after drinking this, for sure.  Drinkability: Actually more concerned about the 120 IBUs than the 18% ABV. That said, it goes down easily, albeit slowly. The alcohol is masked well. This is, without a doubt, a sipper, but for me wasn't a chore to finish (except for the last 2 or 3 sips). Ideal for sharing because of the strength AND because of the greatness...  Notes: Glad I saved this meal-in-itself for after dinner (there aren't many beers out there of which a single 12-oz bottle would concern me as regards calories, but this one certainly qualifies as such). I've read (on the internet and on the bottle itself) that this beer ages particularly well. Most IPAs I try to drink as fresh as possible, but this could be an exception. If there is a way to bring out the complexities of this brew, and a way to tame it a bit, then that's exactly what I want to do. Simpler than its ultra-strong DFH counterpart, World Wide Stout, it's not so elusive to me; it doesn't hide behind anything. And unlike World Wide Stout, which costs a great deal more, I WILL be buying this again, probably soon!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,SpeedwayJim,1.5,"Shared by a roommate that wanted to give this one a try. 12oz bottle (not sure of the vintage). 4oz. pour into a snifter.  A: Healthy pour yields a 1 finger semi-fine white head with decent retention. Beer is a clear, pinkish-peach. Lacing is ringed and patchy with decent stick.  S: Vinegar and booze with the former being (unbelievably) more prominent than the later. Oh yeah, there's a bit of near undetectable citrus hops in the back.  T: Holy shit. A booze bomb all the way. This is more of a barleywine than an IPA. Alchohol is pervasive and vinegary characteristic makes me wanna puke. Hops are barely detectable, just like any other flavors that might've been present. Super sweet also with no hop bitterness. Finish is more of the same with an oily, boozy, sugary aftertaste that just won't go away.  M: Medium bodied, good carbonation and oily in the mouth. No liveliness like I expect from an IPA, however it is a bit coarse around the edges. Finish is messy and aftertaste lingers.  D: I don't know how this is categorized as an IPA and not straight vinegar. Sour from the nose to the mouth but the sad thing is, I can barely get the sourness in the taste because its covered by the immense alcohol. Don't waste your money. I'm glad this was shared because if I had it myself, I would've sipped about an ounce and drain-poured the rest. DFH makes a line of great IPAs with their 60, 75, and 90 minute beers. However, for me, this is definitely the odd man out. Its horrible.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Wafting volatility of stewed prunes, peaches, baked apples, and apricots, that by chance meet.  A fortified brew with alcohol conspicuously bold in bouquet, with caramel butter drizzled golden rum raisin buns, A syrupy, full-bodied honey sweetness on the tongue does weigh, fruity honeydew melon and dried apricot flavor by the tons.  The alcohol warmth enshrouds the taste, but gently like a blanket to a new born. A fruity, cloyingly sugared flavor must be embraced. However barely any perceived bitterness I must warn.

10099,9086,Baraka,3.67,"(reviewed from notes) Dark golden color with a significant amount of lacing on the glass. When tasting, the main thing I noticed was how syrupy and thick it was, but it did not taste anywhere near as hoppy as most imperial IPAs, it was actually fairly balanced. It was still overwhelming in other ways, and the high ABV certainly made itself known both through the alcoholic taste and the buzz felt when finishing up the beer.  This is certainly an extreme beer, and i applaud DFH for that, but it probably should be thought of as closer to a liquor than a beer. It is certainly not sessionable, and not something I'd care to have a lot, but an interesting and worthwhile experience nonetheless.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

M-Surprisingly smooth for a beer of this magnitude. Crisp, yet somehow still slightly creamy, oily and slick.  D-Its a sipper for sure. And one is certainly enough.

I am amazed that the hops still jump out as much as they do. Wet grass, scotch and dark rum aromas. Vinous, muscat grape characteristics. Mild oxidation, but not much considering the three years of age. Sweet alcohol with even some light grains definable. Uber-complex, ridiculously bold.  Taste is...shall we say, unique? Thick, rich sugar coated grapefruit juice, lots of hop flavor but not a whole lot of bitterness. Very sweet, port wine with a squeeze of lemon. Like grappa mixed with cognac, crazy brew.

Smell is very sweet, slightly boozy, with a decent amount of hops.  Taste is very strong. Starts off sweet. A hint of hop bitterness follows that fades away quickly as it's overcome by the sweetness returning, along with a good dose of booziness. There are fruit tastes in the background, and the sweetness is VERY powerful.  Mouthfeel is thick, slick, and very low carbonation. Very syrupy.  Drinkability is low. The taste is very powerful, as is the ABV, so one bottle is more than enough. Would be a perfect bottle to split between 2 or 3 people.  I was really looking forward to this, after loving 60 and 90 minute IPA so much. This is not was I was expecting at all. This is nothing like those beers.

10099,9086,jlenik,3.88,"Bottled on: 07/07/08  Poured into a DFH signature glass.  A: Looks like a darker DIPA but probably more akin to a barleywine here. A light brownish-ruby color is a pleasant sight. Some head but it didn't last too long but I really didn't expect to see much since it's so strong.  S: I can smell some alcohol but it wasn't overwhelming. The hop smell barely comes through and I mostly notice a sweet malty aroma.  T: This is a lot different then I was expecting. Not as hoppy as I had hoped it would be but that's ok (this bottle is almost 2 years old so perhaps it is hoppier when fresh). It tastes good but it really tastes most like a barleywine to me.  M: Somewhat syrupy but it coats the tongue rather smoothly. I thought it would be much thicker and I'm glad it isn't.  D: Well this one is 18% abv so you need to come prepared. The sweetness combats with the alcohol presence making it much more drinkable. While I found that fresh World Wide Stout is much more drinkable than the 120 Minute, this is still great.

Its very sweet, but in a good way. A great cold weather sipper. If blindfolded I never would have pegged this as an IPA. I am most surprised by the tameness of the booze.

And it stays good the whole time while leaving nice lacing. Very surprising for the alcohol content. Color of the head is off-white, somewhat yellow almost. Some dusty sediment as well. Booze is quite up-front in the nose, also getting hops and grapefruit. Taste is better than I thought it would be, first thing I notice is the alcohol is very well-hidden (I think this batch was 21%). It's there, but I would've guessed 12 or 13%. Malts are definitely overpowering the hops. It is very sweet, but not overly so. The main tastes I can get are grapefruit, vanilla, it has a liquor-like presence, almost like thick scotch or rum. Bready and boozy in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is good overall, but the syrupy-ness, sweetness and booze starts to get to you after a while. Drinkability is obviously low, for those reasons, who would drink 2 of these anyway? I've never had this fresh but I'd say age did this beer some good. I liked it much more than I thought it would.

Those smells are so dominate I can only make out some faint toasty malt sweetness in the background.  T - sort of like a hoppy Irish whiskey. Bighting alcohol and big bitter grapefruit hops steel the show muting the maltyness a bit but that sweetness is still present in a sweet lingering finish but the beer does get maltier as it warms.

T: Quite a bit of sweetness to be had with this one, the alcohol is readily apparent and the finish is rather bitter. There were caramel malt, and fresh flavorful hop notes as well.  M: Low amount of carbonation, very slightly tickles the roof of the mouth. Fairly clean feeling.

Much too sweet for me though, would like to see it slightly less sweet so the hops can come out.  M - medium body, complex feel but still is like a weak liquor and no longer a beer.  D - Drank almost the entire bottle to myself and would not suggest anyone else do the same, tried to share it with a loved one but she was not into it at all, so i would suggest finding a friend or loved one interested in sharing it, as it would be a great beer to talk about while drinking.

S - very sweet caramel malts, booze, rose petal, overripe orange, grassy undertone. You get the sense there's more hops complexity hiding under the sweetness, for better or worse.  T - sweet caramel malts continue to dominate. The finish is (finally?) quite bitter, almost coffee like. Interesting, though not sure it's my thing.  M - medium body, very sticky, yet plenty of carbonation to go around. Hard to recall a strong beer that's nailed so many dimensions.  D - fairly drinkable for an 18%; if anything the oddly strong sweet-&gt;bitter balance is harder to stomach.

Pours with a slite head that settles down to a thin ring around the glass. As you sip it, patches of foam stick to the side of the snifter due to the lite syrupy nature.  Smell: Caramel, alcohol and honey come to mind. A slite citrus aroma is begging to come through but held back from the malt sweetness.  Taste: Caramel and raisin with a definite warming sensation from the high alcohol content. Much more complex in the flavor than I was expecting.  Mouthfeel: Viscous with a quick bitter nip of the hop gods followed with sweetness. The experience ends with a dry/tart finish.  Drinkability: Remarkably smooth for the style and ABV. A big alcohol kick if drinking alone.  Wow, this is the cognac of beer by far. This is an extreme beer!! Certainly should be shared with a friend and enjoyed as a sipper (no funnel here).

I was expecting alot of booz and hops but it is nicely balanced. Still warms the throat and is very hoppy but its not overdone. I get alot of yeast in the back of the mouth which has some spicey aftertaste. Orange and pine mixed with biscuity malt flavor.  M/D- Great session beer for a few people to share.

Pours into the snifter a hazy and bronzed red with orange hues and a yellowish, off-white head that subsides to a paper thin ring. A few dots of lace, but the ABV produces a dull appearance that resembles a barley wine. Aroma is bold citrus, Pine Sol, booze soaked wood, apple butter, and peppery, fusel alcohol. Taste delivers a complexity that one would expect from such a strong and highly hopped beer. I get sweet caramel, some nuttiness, apricots, Sultana raisins, juicy and leafy hops, a sharp citric bitterness, and hot liquor to finish. Full-bodied mouthfeel has medium carbonation and a spicy hop bite. IBUs linger on the palate with warm cider and a mild dryness in the aftertaste.  It took me an hour and a half to savour this ale and I really enjoyed the experience. 120 isn't a ""proper"" DIPA but it's still a complex and pleasing drink in its own right.

The feel is full bodied with a sherry sweet finish.  This is definitely pushing things to an extreme. It's very enjoyable if sipped at a relaxed pace.

Like the nose, port like in character and warming. Quite pleasant!  M - Much more like a cognac or brandy than a beer.  D - Surprisingly for an 18% beer it was pretty tasty. Getting the whole bottle down by myself was not happening. I took the last few ounces in a to go cup (I love Vegas!) and woke my wife up with it in the hotel room.

A: Copper colored with a light amount of off-white head that fades to a thin wisp.  S: Hops soaked in brandy is the best I can come up with. The hops are there, but not in the normal way.  T: This has moved beyond beer flavor to a liquor. In spite of the premise of the brew, I'm getting much more malt than hops.  M: Warming. Very warming. If I were in front of a roaring fire in a ski lodge, this would hit the spot. It's a big beer, meaning that the body is very full and the carbonation doesn't really play much of a role.

WOW, not exactly what i was expecting from this one. still good, just different. Instead of the up front hops you get from most dipas, this one starts off with intense sweetness. As the flavor goes along, the honey like sweetness slowly rounds into a flavor full of hoppy pine, citrus, orange, and grapefruit notes. Wasn't actually a huge fan of the level of sweetness it had up front, but the way the flavors come together as a whole is great. Actually a difficult beer to rate for me.  Had a very syrupy mouthfeel, coating the mouth and forcing you to remember each of its flavors (which I didn't mind.)  I don't really know how to rate the drinkability of a beer like this.

The hops are not as prevalant as expected, this is kind of odd for an IPA, I was expecting more as far as bitterness, but this is a much sweeter beer. Also quite a bit of an alcohol aftertaste, probably due to the 18% abv of this monster of a beer.

An extremely high ABV DIPA, that brewer Sam Calagione stated was brewed as an experiment to create the highest alcohol content possible while producing "" a product that still tastes like beer."" I really enjoy the DFH 90 Minute IPA, but I must admit I'm not always a fan of brewing ""experiments.""  Eyes: Pours an extremely hazy, near opaque dark orange with minimal head. The fluffy foam dissipates quickly and doesn't lace at all. I'm sure the near 20% ABV is responsible for the lack of head.  Nose: A very malty sweet, grapefruit infused, floral hop aroma overall. I'malso struck by how boozy it smells. Earthy notes of dry fruit and some subtle pine.  Tongue: Very intense and boozy, a sippin' beer for sure. Tastes of a strong, syrupy caramel, and some citrus hops. Unfortunately the booze and malts push the hops aside a bit too much for me.  Mouth: Thick, syrupy, and pasty. Low carbonation, which would help if it were a bit more bubbly. I can't get past the alcohol either.  Libation: As I stated previously, this is a sippin' beer. I really, really like DIPAs, but this is just to much of an experiment for me. According to Sam Calagione, this beer is ""dry hopped every day for a month"" but it still seems much more malty sweet than hoppy.

No caramel, but some dark fruit, almost what I would expect from a RIS instead of this.  T: Whew, smoooth. The texture on this beast is almost like a half-melted milk shake. Thick. But that's mouthfeel. I get no alcohol, again a sort of aged/faded hop and a lot of malt. But the malt isn't a caramel malt, more of a very very intense and piled up pale ale malt.

The alcohol brings out light apricot notes, and the bread like notes are very mild. The bouquet just kind of sparkles on the nose.  This is full of flavour. Complex but surprisingly balanced due to the extreme nature of this beer. Caramel up front, a good sweet quickly pushed over by a lovely hop flavour. Big american cirtus c-hops. The apricot is a nice sublet note that stays amongst most sips. It's a glass full of citrus rinds, pine needles, and a nice finishing sweetness. Beautiful.  This is a silky, full bodied beer, with low to moderate carbonation. It just fills the palate with amazing flavours and a nice finish with not too many residual sugars. Dry, but not too dry.

It was so intense that I really had to let this breathe and have an opportunity to really open up. Nose is all about the hops. Pure concentrated hop juice. Citrus oils and solvents are upfront, huge bread crust malts follow, with all I can describe as hop fuel. it is really just hops all the way, and not in a way I have encountered before. Upon first taste, I was unprepared for the experience, and let the beer sit for a while longer. I poured a 4 oz sample, and that was more than enough at first. Straight up hops, tonnes of citric pithy flavours, some fuesel components, orangey malts, very alcoholic. The hops here are an all out pine blast. Like eating pure pine needle extract. This is so intense that I had to drink it over 2 days, 3 servings. This is a boozey hop fest in the mouth. Not for the beginner or faint of heart. This is a sipper, and I think this one should be aged for a few years to really let the intensity become a bit more well rounded. Overall, it has huge alcoholic and pine notes in the finish, syrupy and sweet. An experience I will remember for sure. A good beer, but perhaps a little too intense for everyday enjoyment. Certainly a treat! Thanks again Eric!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Carbonation was even and consistent, like champagne.  S - Orange, hops, sugar, molases...relatively balanced and the alcohol seems a bit hidden. I expected this to be only hops I'm pleasantly surprised at the even blend.  T - Hoppy sludge. Very sweet and leaves an unpleasant taste in my mouth and look on my face. The alcohol is way more upfront in the taste than the nose. Very different tasting beer...not much like beer, kind of like a barleywine or dessert wine.  M - Not a huge fan of this one. Too sweet and overly hoppy for my mouth. Leaves a grimace on my face after each sip.  D - The high alcohol content and extreme sweetness make this one I don't plan to pick up again.

There are some grapefruit and pine hops aromas detectable at first, but this gets overwhelmed very quickly by a solvent alcohol smell with touches of cherry and grape character. It's boozy but actually smells rather like a sweet, strong wine with the grape aromas.  Again, the taste tarts briefly with a touch of hoppiness but subsides to a very fruity and boozy taste. Lots of grape flavor and sweetness here, with a fair alcohol heat throughout. It leaves a dry, coffee-ground like aftertaste which I thought was rather odd but pleasant and surprising.  The feel was too sweet and cloying for me and a bit on the hot side but not overly so.  This beer was quite complex and much better than I expected. It hides the 18% ABV beautifully. I've had English barleywines with little more than half as much alcohol that tasted way stronger than this.

S- This ale, if smelled ""blind"" might lead one to guess that it is a Beerenauslese Riesling! There is the distinct character much like that of late-harvested white grapes with botrytis, and the associated aromas of petrol/orange blossom/clover honey/Granny Smith apple.  T- Sweet, resinous hops balance the slightly sticky, viscous-sweet malt. Very opulent, this ale throws a net of fresh sweetness over the palate. First a lush attack of sweet malt and fruity hops, then bright, fresh, light-fleshed fruits, then clover honey on the finish, with lingering notes of orange blossom and overripe, late-harvest dessert white grapes. Sauternes?!  M, D- Do you enjoy, or know someone who enjoys Sauternes, Moscato, Tokay, Auslese/Beerenauslese Riesling, or any other sweet late harvest wine? Then you or they will likely find this ale to be amazing in its ability to transcend the world of ""beer"". This ale is for slow-paced drinking, and it is advised to not even consider opening one until you have made a food-pairing plan and have everything prepared.  I might suggest, at the very least, the best sharp cheddar cheese, tempered. Or spicy Thai pork, hot green or red Thai curry. Or a platter of smoked trout, smoked shrimp, and smoked salmon on crusty bread points. Or raw tuna or yellowtail drizzled with EVOO, sea salt, capers, lemon juice, and flat parsley...

Colors was a deep, burnished gold, very clear, somewhat viscous in character. Nice looking beer.  Aroma was very boozy, full of potent alcohol, also quite a bit of sweetness. Some decent hops, too. You can smell how this once was an IPA but morphed into something completely different. This certainly is the sherry of beers.  Flavor is quite a mashup of sweet, alcohol warmth, & bitterness all at the same time. This isn't like anything else I've had. It doesn't necessarily taste like beer, more like some crazy, excessive, somewhat indulgent cousin. I enjoyed it, just because it was such a different experience.

S: Yowza... yeah, you can smell the booze here. The hops are present as well, but mostly it's the alcohol, and I think I burned off a couple of nose hairs.  T: Wow, not as alcoholic as I would have expected. Ok, yes, the alcohol 'warmth' (or burn) is there all the way down to the stomach, but it's manageable, and it's not as strong as you would think from the ABV or from the smell. Surprisingly, this beer is extremely sweet... the hops become more prevalent after several sips. And that's all you'll be doing here... sipping. Do not attempt to drink this on your own or gulp it down.  M: Full-bodied, very creamy, with average carbonation.  D: No, I will not drink more of these a day... more than one a week, or a month. But I'd love to try it again with a different age (I think this bottle was late 2008)... and after 1/3 of the snifter I was starting to talk a bit of gibberish. Lots of fun!

10099,9086,generalnotsew,1.9,"Before I start I want to say I have had this beer twice before first time about a year and a half ago. Palate has changed a lot since then but I really hated this beer both fresh and with a year on it. This one is 1 year and a half so it is 21% abv. My palate has changed a lot since I had this last so here goes.  A: Much thicker head than I would have thought with something this high gravity. It is a deep amber color but nothing noticeably different than a standard IPA. Still nice looking.  S: Well I must say the hops are still very prominent just that the sweet sickly smell has faded and it smells like it may actually be bitter. Also picking up a very earthy dirty tone. It smelled way better when I first poured it. But still pretty good.  T: Sorry. But I really want to like this I just can't. Way too sweet and sourish for me. Not exactly sour but sourish like a week old apple. This beer is really unpleasant. I love, love, love my IPA's and hoppy goodness but this stuff is terrible.  M: Way too thick. I actually thought I had some food stuck in my mouth it left that much of a film.  D: Terrible. No one could drink more than 2 of these at one time. It would take me personally 3 hours to finish this as I hate every sip.  I never thought I would give ones. I started out with 2's but I hate this beer so much I have to be honest. The smell was really great and I thought after all the DIPA's and IPA's I have had that I would start to like this one.  I really don't understand why this gets such a high score. Do people just feel they have to like it after spending $10 for a 12 ounce bottle? Or is it just really great to some people? I really don't know the answer to that. I suppose a lot of people do like it but not me. If you are a hophead and love your DIPA's be careful of what to expect here.  That being said I could drink the 60 minute IPA by the gallon.

Taste: Once again, sweetness and hops. Malts provide some balance; however, a slight bitterness kicks in towards the end.  Feel: The taste definitely holds on to the palate and to the back of my mouth way after my first sip.  Drink: Definitely a sipping beer and can definitely warm you up on cold days like this. High alcohol content that can kick your ass may be able to finish one but not more than that in one sitting.

The taste is overwhelmingly hops, hops and more hops. They take on a sweet apricot flavor that I really like. The body is full and rich. Sweet like candy and subtly strong.

A: Pours out a yellowish/orangy amber color with a couple fingers of white head that reduced down to a rim around the edges while lacing the glass.  S: Very barleywine esque scent at this point, caramel malts, molasses, biscuit/breadiness, maybe slight pine - very little, if any hop related notes. Not very complex in my opinion.  T: Definitely in barleywine territory now. Predominant flavors are lots of caramel, caramel malts, molasses - very sweet beer. Surprisingly not much alcohol flavor. However, I can still taste hops in there - some enamel damaging with faded bitterness and citrusy grapefruit.  M: I can tell that a ton of hops were used because this has some enamel stripping syrupiness without a whole lot of the hop flavor. This is a low carbonated, resiny, teeth coating type beer. And it fit this well.  D: The drinkability is really not bad for this beer despite being so high in ABV. The alcohol flavor is minimal and more of a complement to the flavor than harsh.

10099,9086,bobsy,2.44,"Shocked to see this on tap at Pizza Plant in Buffalo!  Rich orange pour with a off-white head that died to a film and left a few lace spots on the glass. Looks more or less as you would expect for a high octane brew. The nose is odd... somewhat earthy, with brown sugar, alcohol and pine. Its not a turn-off, but certainly not as attractive as a regular strength imperial IPA, which has got me worried about the flavour...  I have right too be concerned. Weird earthy flavour mixing in with solvents, sweet, sweet malt, pine and citrus. Its weird ( I knew it would be), but its far weirder than I ever imagined. The hop bitterness is actually fairly low, and probably more on par with the 60 minute, if not lesser. Perhaps part of this is because the beer carries a large residual sweetness that deadens everything else. Well... almost everything else... The alcohol is huge, and its not hidden particularly well. You can taste it clearly in the flavour, and feel it as it heads down to your stomach. Other than that, there's definitely some rich sherry notes that add some depth, but I'm struggling to look past the parts I'm not digging. Fairly heavy mouthfeel is somewhat alleviated by a moderate carbonation.  I like how Dogfish Head push the boundaries and refuse to be constrained by anything, but this beer is a huge miss for me. The alcohol is too apparent, the hops don't shine as they should for a big imperial IPA, and everything is just too muddled and unbalanced.

Small bits of sticky lacing coat the glass.  S: Strong caramel, pungent esters, sweet hops and surprisingly subtle spirit.  T: First off, let me say wow. This was completely unexpected. I'll start by saying that this beer rates on the IBU scale around 120. You really have to taste this beer to believe it, but it's incredible. The first thing to hit my taste buds is sweet syrup and baked pear. It rolls to the back of my tongue with a fruity and complex hops...It's not even a bite. The hops are extremely pleasant in this beer. Ah, there are some great flavours in here. Raisons and candied apples mix into this full bodied and fruity IPA, in turn giving it a sherry taste.  M: The mouthfeel compliments the beer wonderfully. The carbonation is minimal, the bubbles are small, and thus the thick syrupy texture isn't broken.  Drink: I am blown away, elated, and getting a bit tipsy. I have a found my new favorite beer. I expected something far more volatile and bitter, but for such a behemoth of a brew it is incredibly well balanced. Surprisingly enough, I would recommend this beer for someone who is just getting into India Pale Ales. I'm looking forward to aging a bottle of this and seeing what comes out. In retrospect, I haven't been drinking at all for about five months. This is really starting to get to my head....maybe this is why I like this beer so much.

10099,9086,StoneTSR,3.6,"I've been waiting for this one for a long time. After searching keeping my eyes open for a bottle of the 120 Minute IPA from Dogfish Head, I finally came across one about a month ago. A few nights ago, I finally decided to crack it open and dive in.  As a side note, my plan was to pour this bottle into a Delirium Tremens tulip glass which I stole, fair and square from work. That plan seems to have been thwarted by a certain female friend of my roommate's who apparently stole that glass from me. She's the only one who could have done it...I am outraged. Anyhow, instead, I will be forced to use my favorite rocks glass which I stole from my other place of employment. It was the last glass my buddy Alan drank from in Chicago before moving to South Korea. So, not ideal for tasting, but at least I can dedicate this review to one of my favorite drinking buddies and his glass:  APPEARANCE: After reading all the reviews talking about how syrupy this beer tasted I was a little surprised to see it look like a somewhat normal IPA. Nice transparent copper color with a thin head comprised of tiny bubbles.  SMELL: When I cracked the bottle open I took a quick whiff and was delighted. I could smelly hoppy deliciousness, the smell actually made me smile. Once it had been poured and I got a better smell, I realized what made me smile. It was the smokiness. It almost reminded me of a bourbon, but without the vanilla flavor. Bourbon, like beer, often makes me smile.  TASTE: The big moment, and...well, wow, I really did not expect that. The syrup, sweet taste is noticeable right away, although I never would have guessed that from the smell or the look. It isn't too sweet or syrupy, just didn't see that coming at all. I read about it, but didn't believe it until I tried it. The hops come in late, but I do wish they were a bit stronger. A nice change of pace, but not what I expected.  FEEL: The syrupy flavor seems to trick your mouth into thinking this is a thicker liquid than it actually is. The carbonation maintained its liveliness no matter how long I held the beer on my tongue. It was actually quite nice to let it sit in my mouth for a moment, let it soak in. Oddly enough, for a beer that is 18% ABV, I expected the alcohol to hit me harder. I was expecting to feel like I was taking that first sip of bourbon, kind of like the first sip of a Goose Island Bourbon County Stout, but it just didn't happen. I could see this being kind of a dangerous beer for someone who didn't know what they were getting into. That said, half way through the glass I am beginning to feel it.  OVERALL: Holy Crap! Now it's kicking in. It is the only beer I've had tonight and it is hitting me already. I guess that's what happens when you drink a beer that is really the equivalent of about three. I heard and read a lot about this beer before I tried it, but it really surprised me. In some ways I was surprised that others were right about it and in other ways I just didn't see it coming. If you're looking for super-intense hops (as I was) this is not your beer, but if you're looking for something unique, different and original than this is an excellent beer. Despite it not being what I was hoping it would be, I am still very happy with it and look forward to having another...but on another night, cause in the famous words of Dave Chappelle as Sam Jackson ""It'll getcha drunk!""",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Slightly, more head on-tap than with bottle.  S: Alcohol (both on-tap and bottle). Of course, followed with DFH hoppy smells of citrus, grapefruit, and pine.  T: It was like a concentrated DFH 90. All of the hoppy, citrusy flavors were right up front. However, so was the alcohol. Not as well hidden as anticipated (esp. the on-tap). Understandable with the ABV.

This is one of the most polarizing beers out there - lots of people love it and lots of people hate it.  Dark orangish-amber color with a medium off-white head. Looks a little syrupy, yet otherwise fairly innocuous.  Aroma is sweet, syrupy malt, and intense hops. Lots of caramel in there and some booze. Hops are mainly of the citrus variety.  Man, this is sweet. Probably one of the sweetest I've ever had. I like it though, ""Too sweet"" whiners be damned. It is much hoppier than the 90 Minute, but not brutally so. Caramel malt, citrusy hops, and alcohol is the basic flavor profile. A little nail polish maybe.  Excellent syrupy mouthfeel - but not too syrupy. I like that in a beer like this. A little palate-wrecking, but not quite as much as you'd expect.  Drinkability is really not bad at all, even for a beer of half the ABV this has. This is one of the more dangerous brews out there as far as drunkenness power goes, as it definitely doesn't feel like 21% ABV.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Smell: Sweet smelling, strong hop aroma, as to be expected from a beer with 120 IBUs. Strong alcohol aroma.  Taste: Unlike any beer I've ever had (If you could even call it a beer); extremely sweet, almost too sweet for my tastes. Some hop flavor, but not the extreme hop ""punch"" one would expect from such a brew as the sweetness and high alcohol content mask the heavy hop flavor. Warm alcohol aftertaste with a lingering sweetness that lasts until your next sip. Very tasty beer, but is definitely one that you have to sip on.  Mouthfeel: Slightly syrupy.  Drinkability: Not the most drinkable beer in the world, but thats to be expected with such a strong, sweet beer.  All in all it's a pretty damn good beer, although I enjoy the 90 minute more.

Its pretty orange with some amber. The aroma is very alcohol forward with some hoppiness to it but mostly sweetness aside from the alcohol aroma.  The taste was very surprising. There's almost no bitterness and no alcohol burn and its all sweet. Its pretty delicious. The hop flavor is more or less lost in the sweetness. I expected this one to be very harsh but was pleasantly surprised instead.  It was incredibly easy to drink. I split it with a friend and was able to down it very fast, as much as I tried to pace myself. The mouthfeel was a little thicker than I would've expected from an IPA, but this isn't a bad thing.

Its still pretty chilled from being on my back porch for a few hours. The 120 minute is very thick limiting the drinkable nature. The taste to me is more sweet than hoppy. Some sweet candied citrus flavors a very abundant. Also some heavier brown sugar like notes. To me it has a straight forward smell and taste huge flavor lots of booze.  I am having this brew at home.

10099,9086,ffejherb,1.6,"On tap at TJ's on 12/5/09 for their 6th Anniversary celebration.  A - Beautiful clear orange-colored body with ruby highlights and amber hues and half a finger of bubbly off-white head that reduced to a patchy veil and deposited minimal lace around the snifter.  S - Hmmmm... smells like solvent or kerosene or some kind of glue or nail polish remover. Think Silly String. You know that brightly colored, foamy stuff that you shoot out of an aerosol can? Unfortunately, yes. Now you get some idea of how nasty this smells. Some citrus peel/hop oil character attempts to claw its way through the overpowering gas-like fume to no avail.  T - Flavor is really hot, perhaps the hottest beer I've ever had in my mouth. This is ultimately extremely sweet and syrupy, and doesn't really scream hops at all. As a matter of fact, it doesn't even whisper hops. I hope for the sake of this beer's reputation that this was a bad batch, because I've heard that this beer is amazing on tap. Let me tell you, amazing this is not. Imagine (as bad as it sounds) drinking a glass of gasoline with a giant heap of sugar mixed in.  M - Mouthfeel is sweet and cloying beyond belief. Texture is syrupy and very sticky. There is virtually no hop bitterness on the palate at all.  D - Honestly, I would have drain poured this if I didn't pay over $6 for a snifter. Very, VERY disappointed with this offering on tap. 90min. is so much better and hoppier than this abomination, and the only reason I can think of that DFH would brew such an undrinkable beer is purely for the novelty of it.

Some spotty strands of lacing revealed on the tilt side of the glass. Huge, malty nose, definitely reminiscent of a barleywine. Lots of dark fruit (i.e. plums and prunes) and breadiness, with a suggestion of citrus acidity in the mix. Taste consistent with nose - wow, this is a total malt bomb; also getting some brown sugar and molasses in the flavor profile. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, with a light, smooth background carbonation and a slightly oily quality. This is a pretty decadent treat.

10099,9086,BS68280,3.95,"Received in a trade with hayesez. Thanks for the great beer. Poured from a bottle dated 02-09-09 into the DFH signature glass. This is my second bottle of this, the last one i had i few months ago was a 2006 vintage. I will try my best to compare them since that review was deleted with the site crash. I rated the 06 higher than this, as i did enjoy it a good bit more. On to the review.  A: Pours a golden amber, slightly hazy, with about 1/2"" white head. The head does not stay very long, and leaves only the slightest lacing. To be expected from 18+abv.  S: As soon as I opened the bottle I immediately smelled the hops. Now that I am giving it a few more sniffs in the glass, it is more fruity and alchohol then hops. Peach, apple and caramel? Smells delicious, but not like an IPA of any kind, but just as i say that, here come the hops again... citrusy. If i recall correctly the 06 had more of a good cognac or rum smell to it.  T: I don't know if my palate just isn't that great yet but this one is difficult for me. It is not the hop bomb bitterness that you would expect. Very sweet... carmel, maple sweetness at the end. At first i believe it is from the malts, but the alcohol definitely lends it's giant hand. The alcohol is there, but not really hot and for sure not overpowering. I think the biggest characteristic the alcohol gives is the sweetness. I am trying to figure out where those hops went. Again not bitter in any way, i only get hints of the citrusy hops but they are outplayed by the sweetness. As it warms the alcohol gets a little warmer too, or maybe it is because i've had half the glass now. The 2006 reminded me almost exactly of Pyrat rum if any of you have had it.  M: Silky smooth, and more carbonation then you would think coming from a beer like this. I don't recall what the 06 felt like.  D: Wow... this is 18%+? Really? Goes down very easy.

10099,9086,superdedooperboy,3.87,"Celebrating my 600th new beer since hitting 21 with a brew I couldn't purchase legally in Georgia. Received this puppy in a trade courtesy JFFoodie. Thanks a million!  Poured from a 12 oz. brown bottle into a Dogfish Head Signature Glass at cellar temperature, 45 degrees F. Bottled On date of 05/01/09 is clearly printed on the bottle.  Pours a crystal clear golden amber with a finger of off-white cream that doesn't linger for long, falling away to form a nice thick crowning that leaves some thing rings and legs of lace behind; surprisingly more lace than anticipated due to the weight of the beer, but considering the heavy amount of hop oils at play, it doesn't seem quite so surprising after all.  The nose is quite sweet and fruity. Some citrusy, floral hops are present, but not dominant; instead, the dominant aromas seem to be reminiscent of rock candy, apricot, fig, and a rum-like boozy alcohol note. Recalls a well-aged barleywine.  Body is thick and heavy, though not syrupy, and carbonation is quite light, though it makes itself known. On the palate, things become difficult to point out. Up front is a dominant fruity sweetness, but the notes are mangled - perhaps some green apple or pear, though sour cherry or raspberry seems liklier; hard to tell, though it is tart and satisfyingly fruity. Sweet candy-ish malt envelops the tongue; bitterness makes itself aware just in the middle before a mildly herbal, somewhat citric hop flavor takes up the rear. Warm alcohol takes hold from there through the finish, almost burning on its way down the throat, leaving behind a warming afterglow and a tart, somewhat grapefruity, slighlty syrupy-sweet aftertaste.  This is one hell of a beer experience. Almost a combination of American barleywine and a fine single malt Scotch. It's most definitely a sipper, to say the least; In order to decipher all of the flavor components I downed a little more than anticipated and the alcohol certainly has a warming bite afterward. Time to sit back and enjoy the rest of this delight. One 12 ounce bottle is certainly enough to split between two people.

First taste is of very sweet malt. Lots of diacetyls, like drinking butterscotch schnapps. Hops arent as extreme as in the nose. Resinous, piny with some orange citrus. Alcohol is definitely apparent in here but mixed with the malt and flavors of dried apricot and candied sugar, its toned down abit. Tastes like an aged double barleywine, if those exist  Mouth feel is good. Goes down thick and buttery. Carbonation is surprisingly lively for such a big beer.

An amber tint with a sizable white head.  S: Peachy bread mixed with hops. I like.  T: Spicy is the second word that comes to mind...after sweet. But I sense the 120 minutes worth of hops.

10099,9086,swhite11,3.05,"Let me preface this review with the fact that I am reviewing this beer as an Imperial IPA. This beer was consumed about a week after purchase.  Appearance - Poured from a 12oz. bottle in to a snifter. Very opaque amberish orange appearearance with a decent head that does not retain for any substantial amount of time. Leaves mediocre lacing on the way down.  Smell - Malty bread/sweet/caramel notes with a slightly pronounced spicy/earthy/floral hop aroma and some faint dark fruit notes. Alcohol very apparent in the nose.  Taste - Extremely sweet up front with notes of bready, slightly toasted malts and caramel that intensify even furthur as the beer warms. Hops struggle to make an appearance on both aspects of taste and bitterness although they are perceived to a minimal extent in taste as slightly spicy/herbal/floral. Closes out with a massive punch of warming, yet completely unoffensive alcohol and very faint notes of dark fruit.  Mouthfeel - Slightly silky and a little on the viscous side at first, which was not offensive. Becomes overly viscous and cloying midway through due to the excessive malt sweetness. Alcohol helps to balance/dry but without an ample level of hop bitterness, the beer continues to cloy.  Drinkability - One is more than enough. As stated before, this beer becomes cloying around the halfway point. Additionally, the alcohol content makes this a tough beer to enjoy more than one of.  Overall - This was a very tough beer to review. To say that it is an interesting beer would be a gross understatement. I am reluctant to stand by my ratings, especially on taste (Which I felt killed this beer's score), but as stated before I am reviewing this beer as an Imperial IPA. I was very dissappointed with this particular beer in that it displayed very little to no characteristics of an Imperial IPA. I was however, very impressed with the complexity of the malt (albeit cloying at times) and the extent to which the alcohol taste was refined. I would highly recomend this beer to someone interested in an exceptional barleywine with a slight hoppy twist. A bit of ageing would furthur develop this beer as a more traditional yet less dry barleywine as the already minimal hop levels would continue to decline to an extent.  A very intriguing beer that does not come across as an Imperial IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

10099,9086,psycroptic,3.63,"So, at this time (12/7/09) i'm still a bit new to IPA's. I've come to love nearly every DFH offering i've had the chance to sample, with the 90 minute being a particular favorite of mine. Picked this 120 up at the local liquor place today, poured into my ""Harpeth River Watershed"" glass.. lol  A: To be honest it almost doesn't look like an IPA; if it weren't for the sizeable head upfront it would look like a barleywine, to me at least. Tiny clinging mini-head persists throughout the drink. Color is the classic english burnt-orange; held up to the light it's entirely opaque, giving it a quite ""thick"" appearance.  S: Fruity hops with a strong backbone of alcy and some residual malt characteristics; you'll have to forgive me as, being only a ripe old twenty-one my experience ain't that lofty. For ~18% ABV the alcohol actually seemed a bit subdued, taking a backseat to the fruits.  T: intense intense intense! I don't usually drink higher gravity beers such as this (well, usually nothing above 8 or 9% abv) and it realllly smacks me in the taste buds. The hops aren't too tangy to be honest, but they're absolutely present upfront; alcohol, as expressed before, totally dominates here for me, and as someone who isn't tooo into liquour it seems mighty close to a shot of somethin' or other.  M: This is where it starts to decline for me. It only takes a few sips to start covering up the taste buds with what feels like a thick syrup of malty alcohol. I hate that I bring up the alcoholicness of it so much, but dayummm.... this s**t'll rock your tongue. I broke down and had to munch on some leftovers about halfway through as the feeling began to get a bit too much for me, but it helped; having something else to balance out the beer really did cover up the intensity. I could imagine this being a tasty end to a large course, spicy meal.  D: Of course I can't drink more than one of these; remarkably heavy, remarkably strong. After 3/4 of the glass I was feeling toasty... Definitely not something I could wind down with, as there's just too much going on.  Maybe for the style it's a bit regular? Idk... Imperial IPA's aren't something I have tons of past work with. Just seemed over-exaggerated on most accounts except, ironically, the hops; like I have a feeling that more bitterness would actually improve upon the syrupy sweetness that it has. Also, I hate to be a pussy, but... too much gd alcohol! If this was 12-14% it'd probably be much much more drinkable and, consequently, enjoyable for me. Dogfish Head makes stunning beer, and this is no exception... It's just that ""stunning"" doesn't always mean ""great"".

I didn't get as much of a dark fruit presence as some of the other people tasting, but that might be shaded by my experiences with Raison d'Extra, which has a very pronounced dark fruit characteristic...this one just struck me as a malt bomb through and through, and this is in evidence from the first pour...huge aroma of malts. Very thick in the mouth (as expected) and what I would call dangerously drinkable. I had two in one evening. No, that was not a good idea.  The bottom line: Despite the fact that is part of the XXX Minute line, this is a beer that is recommended, first, for people who are used to pretty high gravity alcohol (whiskey fans would likely find some things to like here) and second for people who can appreciate beers that don't have all that much of a hop presence. I don't doubt that DFH threw a lot of hops into the kettle, but the sheer amount of malts present here drown most of them out. As a malt fan, I like this, but don't buy expecting a hop bomb...for that you're much better off going with something like a Founder's Devil Dancer or the like.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,AndrewNWI,4.55,"On Thanksgiving I purchased two 12 oz bottles and me and my cousin had split one. The other one is being aged right now. The bottle was chilled and than set out to reach a little warmer temperature. Pour into two snifters and was eaten with crackers and cheese spread. Which complemented it nicely!  Appearance - Upon pour me and my cousin looked in 'awe' as probably the most beautiful color appeared in our glass. It looked like the time right before the sunsets lighting up a wheat field on a clear day. The vibrant dark golden orange-brown lit up the room and that head topped the glass perfectly and was so thick and creamy.  Smell - It has been over a week since Thanksgiving and the smell still lingers. That sweet malty citrus smell, with the aroma of ethanol. I was already starting to taste it from the fragrance.  Taste - I took my final sniff and added a small taste and the combination was exuberant. Strong at first and then it settled and the taste buds went off the chart. Malt, hops, fruits, sugars, and then the alcohol, which is intensely notable, but not to where it draws away from the other tastes.  Mouthfeel - It was pretty thick almost sticky and very warm, and that head stayed around the entire time as it it was the gatekeeper protecting the beer. You'd think the high alcohol content would be an annoyance but the slight prickles on your tongue makes you feel as if you were five years old again trying Pop-Rocks!  Drinkability - We split the 12 oz bottle, and that 6 ounces went down smooth. Each sip was like a wake up call to my tongue alerting it to take in the tastes again and again.  Overall this beer was probably one of the best IPAs I have had thus far. I still have one bottle left I plan on aging, which I can expect to be even better than the one we had drank that day! I've never been disappointed by DFH. Raison D'Xtra will still be top on my list from their selection, but this is an excellent second!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Way too Sweet, hot, and mediciny. Hops taste faint. This beer is a total mess, A perfect example of just because you can do something doesn't mean you should. Though this might have been aged improperly or be better fresh.  D: Ha! are you kidding me it took me a few hours to finish this beer. I never really contemplated drain pouring it but I wasn't exactly looking forward to each sip.  It was worth trying but other than possibly giving a fresh bottle a try I won't be seeking this out anymore.

10099,9086,Ralphus,3.47,"On the way home from the office I notice my throat is getting sore. I get home and immediately try and kill whatever it is with a few shots of whiskey and then look for something with more volume and a high alcohol content. Look at that.. a bottle of Dogfish 120 min IPA! If this really does have an 18ABV it should do the job.  This beer, even as I poured it, looked syrupy. It just came out of the bottle a little different than other beers have. The colour is nice.. a orange bronze with good looking highlights. The head is small and quickly recedes to a ring of foam. Some lacing is noticeable.  The smell is mostly sweet citrus fruit and earth tones. It's pretty good. The taste is strong.. amplification is bumped up.. and sweet, boozy and a touch under balanced by the hops. This is no hop monster, or if it is it has been beaten by the alcohol and malts in my opinion. The orange citrus sweetness dominates. If it really is 18% they have done a good job with it. My suspicion is that it's somewhat less.. perhaps 12-14%.  Mouthfeel is smooth, syrupy and sticky. But it goes well and I have to give the brewery kudos for being able to deliver such a beast that is still drinkable. Overall not a bad beer.. and I might even prefer it to the 90 min IPA.. especially now that my throat feels better!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,godfathermg57,4.28,Poured into chalice  Darker in color and with less head that I expected.  Interesting IPA without an overpowering hops flavor. Subtle sweet flavor to the beer and because of the high alcohol content very warming. However I would say it hides the alcohol very well in that the alcohol taste is not overwhelming. Like others have said it is a sipping beer that will hit fast compared to most beers. Very smooth and flavorful and overall I very much recommend it.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

I am astonished how pronounced the malts are given the alcohol content. The alcohol is extremely well hidden in this one. Although it definitely has that malt liquor backbone, the malts still play out very well.  It could be that this is an old bottle (although I don't think so), the hops are not overwhelming. They seem to get lost in the overall sweetness. Aftertaste is sticky and malty, but not terrible.  Overall, great beer. Amazing concoction.

10099,9086,lacqueredmouse,3.35,"Pours a murky brown-orange colour, with some loose-bubbled head initially. The head dissipates quickly, unsurprising considering the high alcohol content, but there is a little white fizz around the edges. Body looks surprisingly thin considering the strength of the brew. Overall, it looks good, if a little scary.  Extremely strong nose, full of spiritous alcohol and sharp high-alpha hop acids. Citrus is pungent, and the alcohol is redolent of brandy. Little sweetness, although there is a port-like residual sugar character lingering around - mostly the alcohol and the hops take charge, however.  Strong and pungent on the palate, initially brash with citric hop bitterness, before the tingling warmth of booze bellows up from the back, roaring a fire of spicy spirit-like burn through my mouth. The alcohol is the main-event here, slightly sweeter than pure spirits, but almost with the intensity. The hop character even takes a backseat to the booze. I can't deny it's confronting, but it's almost too much - perhaps there is a limit to just how far you can push beer after all.  Overdone. Too full of booze, and too straight up with its roar of dominant power. If you're after insanity, maybe this is the beer for you. For me, while it is in all respects unique, it's so far beyond the realms of decency, and so confrontingly undrinkable. Maybe it mellows with age. Maybe we'll see.

10099,9086,Cabadrin,4.57,"Being a big fan of Dogfish Head and their IPAs in general, I wish I could have this beer more often, but it usually sells out quick at our local stores. Our neighbors and I had this when we came over for dinner, and the aromas and taste both put us in our place. This is an excellent beer! I have the 90-minute and 60-minute pretty regularly, but this was only my second time having the 120-minute.  A - Pouring into a glass, the beer itself is a light amber color with a solid ring around the top. The foam disappeared relatively quickly once we began drinking.  S - Spicy and sweet, with bitter notes in the smell. The aroma also had some Vanilla, similar to DFH's Palo Santo Marron. The smell of alcohol was faint, but there.  T - When you try a massively hopped beer like this, you expect it to be bitter. What I didn't remember was how sweet it tastes. There's very little alcohol at cool, but not cold temp (~55 degrees). First taste was sweet with some bitter hops, later tastes felt like vanilla and alcohol. Overall the taste is sweetness and some spicy undertones. Alcohol taste was there, but very low for something with such high ABV. Very good, but a sipping beer - drink it slow.  D - For such a specialty beer, this is very drinkable. The high ABV may seem like a barrier, but my friend and his wife both found it to be easily paired with dinner. Anyone who enjoys IPA should try this beer.  If you like IPAs, this is a beer for you, if only to taste what something with this much hops really can taste like.

Appearance: Poured a very copper and amber in color, with very little head. Left some mild lacing while drinking.  Smell: I couldn't quite place it, but it was like a sweet and sour smell. Strong citrus and alcohol smell was noticeable.  Taste: The 120 was incredibly sweet with a lot of apple and honey flavor.  Mouthfeel: The beer was very smooth with very fine effervescence, while not feeling overly carbonated.  Drinkability: The beer really hides the alcohol well. I'm not sure if it was the ABV or the sweetness, but this was a struggle to finish. My stomach was really feeling it after.  After having the 90 Minute last week on draft, I was really surprised at the difference in the 120. This tasted much more like a barleywine to me as opposed to an IPA.

""Bottled on"" date of 11/06/08 with an additional letter ""F"" after the date, whatever that might mean. Poured into my Three Philosophers 8 oz. chalice. This is one of my favorite glasses which is why I chose it to taste and review this infamous beer.  A Dark butterscotch translucent body with a light brown but brief head that dissipates to a ring around the top of the chalice within a minute although there is trace amounts of head in the middle as well. I really do like the attractive color. 4.0  S Well, this is one hell of a beer already by the smell. Warm alcohol hits me first. That is followed by nice, organic hops smell (could it be the dry hopped aspect of the beer?) and then a nice, deep malt bed which all of this is laying on. 4.5  T Wow...I feel a rush of sweet malt and the warmth of alcohol wash over me in what really reminds me of a hard alcohol drink and the ABV may approach some hard alcohol drinks. Hops, which to me appear after the mid taste of sweet malt and alcohol are bitter but they do not have the prominence that I was expecting after reading the label which announces ""What you have here is the holy grail for hopheads."" They are certainly awash in the other tastes of the beer. I do not drink hard alcohol so it is difficult to come up with a comparison to another hard alcohol but what few times that I have had whiskey I think that I recall that it had some taste in common with this. Come to think of it, the only thing that they could have in common is the burn of alcohol but I thought I would leave these comments here as it is a true reflection of my thoughts. Its proximity to a hard alcohol ultimately drove down my rating of the taste. I struggled with this rating though. 3.5  M This is one of the biggest beers that I have tasted due to all of these factors. It has a thickness and a syrupy stickiness that is matched by only a few beers. It might even be too big of a mouthfeel, driving down my rating of the feel. 3.5  D Not good as it is such a huge beer and such a high ABV. 2.0  Notes: Well there you have it.

10099,9086,BillyBoysPie,2.16,"To cut to the chase - I'm rather disappointed. This beer is extremely expensive and not worth the money. I like expensive beer and wine - and often pay the price tag. This is the most overpriced item I've bought in beer, wine, or food.  From a very expensive bottle into an oversized wine glass.  Pours a dark burnt orange turing into an amber the lower the beer is in the glass. Half inch of yellow-white foam that dissipated immediately. No lacing.  Smells of pine, orange rind and other tree saps with a little clove. Interesting, but nothing remarkable. Seems very sweet, and there is no presence of alcohol. If I am to believe the 21% alcohol, it's hidden well.  Taste is very unbalanced, but has the elements of what could be an interesting beer. Mostly pine and sap (see mouthfeel for the other sap part of this beer) and a little bit of bitter orange and sour flavors. Nothing attractive about this beer - especially considering that there is very little food that would be good next to this.  I generally like beers that are refreshing, but that should be prefaced with the fact that I find a big Quad refreshing. But this beer is very poorly conceived for a drinker in mind. The beer is, quite frankly, like drinking sap. The mouth feel is sticky and there should be a great deal of carbonation to balance it, which there isn't.  This beer is an expensive experiment. If you like to try beers you might not like, go for it - but I'd strongly recommend sharing it.  I never pour drinks down the sink unless it's a ruined batch - whether it be beer, wine, or a cocktail. I poured the last half of this down the sink. First, in the hopes of salvaging this beer, I experimented with a plethora of ways of drinking this. First, I warmed the beer in my hands, then I chilled it again in the glass, then poured a bit into another glass and added carbonated water to thin it out and see what flavors remained. I also returned some to the bottle and shook it gently to get more of a flavor release. None of these things brought out any balancing characteristics, but revealed to me that I'm just not a fan of a beer that has been hopped for 120 minutes.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

10099,9086,Lunch,4.37,"Served on-tap at Frisco Grille in Columbia, MD (11/05/09). Served in a 12oz. goblet at an appropriate temperature.  A: Pours a glowing orange, golden, amber with a slight cap that disappears quickly leaving no real lacing at all.  S: A sweet alcohol hop bouquet that included pine, apricot, grapefruit, and tropical fruit . A sugary-sweet caramel malt came through as well. Smells quite intense.  T: The palate is bombarded with a sticky caramel malt and a intense piney hop with a slight bitterness. Extremely cloying and viscous with a definite sense of the 21% abv. shining through, but in a pleasant warming way. Very complex as well containing tropical fruits, flowers, grapefruit, and orange peel.  M: Quite oily, thick and sticky with a pleasing alcohol burn.  D: I must say that I enjoyed all 12oz. and would have gladly had another, but one must respect of beer of this abv. as it will catch up to you sooner rather than later.  Overall I find this beer to be a great example of extreme brewing at its best. Certainly not a beer to be enjoyed frequently, but certainly one that needs to be experienced at least once. Highly recommended.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,WCBCFrank,3.52,"Dogfish's 120 is a example of having too much of good thing. For those who have not have had 60 or 90, DO NOT START WITH THIS! A true Imperial IPA, copious amount of pine and grapefruit. It pours a good head in a wine glass or pint. Truly a beer geek's beer...my wife hated this beer.  This is a well-made beer, and I certainly enjoy haivng one every now and then, but more a treat than a beer staple.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,BarrelO,4.2,"12oz bottle poured into a snifter. Bottled on 5/1/09.  A: Dark amber body with an impressively vigorous head which leaves some lacing.  S: Sugary sweetness and alcohol hit you like a ton of bricks. Hardly any trace of hops.  T: Total malt bomb. Caramelly sweetness with a faint trace of hops that show up mostly in the aftertaste. Astonishingly, alcohol is barely detectable. It comes across more like an English barleywine than any IPA. In fact, I'd say the beer I've had that matches its flavor profile the most is Thomas Hardy's Ale.  M: Syrupy, almost sludgy.  D: You know, I'd like to see how this would have turned out if DFH had followed the logical progression and made this 12% ABV. As it is, it's probably the biggest beer the average beer geek will have access to. But don't be afraid. As long as you treat it with respect, it's a gentle giant. It certainly carries its weight more gracefully then WWS. It may not be a very good IPA, but it's an excellent after-dinner beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,DrKnoskelson,4.7,"I enjoyed this beer on tap at the Hulmeville Inn, located in Hulmeville, PA. It was served in a 12 oz chalice.  The beer poured golden amber and relatively clear for an imperial IPA. I guess the aging of the keg might have added in clarification. Only a trace amount of head.  Very faint smell of hops. Unfortunately the Hulmeville permits smoking, so I can only assume that the true aroma was masked by cigarette smoke.  The first sip reveals extremely bitterness; almost sour taste, with a harsh alcohol presence that slightly burns the mouth. The flavor is vastly complex, malty, with notes of currants. This beer tastes what dank hops smell like. I've smelled some dank IPA's before, but this brew tastes like what other beers smell like.  This beer finishes bone dry with flavors revealing themselves along the way. Amazing beverage, but 12 ounces is a bit much. I would have rather enjoyed it in an 8-ounce snifter. This is truly a beer that should be experienced by any IPA or hophead enthusiast.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,jrallen34,3.86,"I drank this from a bottle into a chalice.  It pours a medium bright clear orange that is very pretty. The head is a very light tan or off white that only rises about half a finger and is gone quickly. There is light lacing.  The aroma is very strong, bitter crazy, almost so strong you it overwhelms your olfactory senses all once and drives them down so you don't smell it anymore. There is also a light citrus note.  The taste is very surprising, the aroma is totally misleading. The first you get a burst of sweetness of citrus and then get some light hops and towards the end a burst of hops an alcohol. The flavor is very complex but not very remisicant of an ipa or how hoppy I thought it would be.  Mouthfeel is heavy and complex. Drinkability is very good considerin its abv.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,drabmuh,4.3,"Poured from a bottle into a Dogfish Head snifter. Not sure what year this is but I'll assume its a 2009 vintage. Beer is orange / brown, high haze, thin white head, tiny to medium bubbles, carbonation mild. The beer clarifies as it warm, it becomes almost completely clear, this is chill haze. They should just add ""chill haze"" to the style description of DIPA since I have yet to have one that does not have this characteristic, and I penalize all of them for it.  Aroma is strong, full of hops and alcohol, malt sweetness, it is a lot to take in. Smells more solventy than I expect, slight deduction.  Beer is very sweet and has a lot of bitterness at the back end. The sweetness is a mixture of alcohol / solvency and malt character. It is very interesting and the hop bitterness is well balanced. This is NOTHING like the 90 minute IPA. Let us be clear, they are different beasts. It is not as thin as I thought it would be and the mouthfeel is really great. This beer is surprisingly (dangerously) easy to drink. Drinkability very high. A well crafted fine DIPA, more like a QIPA. Overall a good drink, this is probably the third or forth time I've had it, still a good drink.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Otesanek,4.15,"Two reviews, one bottle at 3 months old, and another at 1.25 years.  Fresher:  Pours with no head, just a thin wisp of bubbles covering the surface, very hazy golden-peach-pink. Smells surprisingly like an English barleywine, sweet cream balanced with fresh hops, the alcohol shows up, a hotness in the sinuses, but for the abv totally reasonable. Flavor is amazing and vibrant, this thing is HUGE, reminds me of a beer version of Sauternes, all acidic honeyed oranges down the sides of my tongue, super bright golden cherries. Very juicy, the finish is long and mellow with a surprisingly mellow rolling bitterness, looong finish.  Aged:  Pours an 1/8th inch head which fades quickly down to spotty cover and solid ring of bubbles, a little lacing, but tons of alcohol legs. Golden where thin, deepens to peachy-pink. The nose hits me with some alcohol, sweet malts, lightly bready and lemony-sweet. The taste is a little shallow, mostly sweet pale caramel, a sugary-fruitiness. There's a subtle vegetal bitterness in the finish. There's a light alcohol sting on the tongue. Thin, yet coating mouthfeel, like watered down honey, balanced out by a light spritzy carbonation. Seems diminished, but a lot of dogfish bottles go through an awkward middle age to become really great a few years down the road, or so I've heard. One left from this bottling, I'll crack it open in a couple more years.  I'm rating this against the fresher of the two, as I think it's better and a fairer thing to do. I rated the drinkablity of this one a four point five, not that I would ever session this monster, but it goes down amazingly easy considering it's abv.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,iheartcraftbeer,4.72,"Poured into my brand new Duvel tulip. Thick, reddish-orange body. Small foamy head shrinks quickly but never disappears. Small amount of white lacing creeps down the side of the glass.  Aroma is, in a word, heavenly. Very floral (rose petals?) and very fruity (strawberry, peach, cherry). It beckons me from across the room like a scent cloud that forms into a curled finger like in those old school Daffy Duck cartoons.  Taste is ... wow. This is one bad ass IIPA. The intense flavors are almost too complex to describe. I'm getting cherry, orange peel, bourbon and strawberry. Extremely sweet, borderline cloying. Very thick, syrupy mouthfeel. The alcohol at the back end is quite warming, but it doesn't hit me until the last second. Slick on the way down.  Drinkability is way too smooth for a beer this big. But at + 20% ABV, I can't see drinking more than one. Hell, if I had more than one I wouldn't be seeing much of anything.  Dare I say, the best IIPA I've ever had the pleasure of partaking in. Big ups to Kevin's dad for bringing this to me from MD.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,AventinusCam,4.34,"First off all it took me way too long to drink this...this...gift from the hop gods.  A: The appearance was surprising to me. It didn't pour much of a head due to the alcohol content, but the bright amber color more than made up for it.  S: Hops along with some coriander and orange peel with hops hops hops hops hops. Incredible.  T: The beer was not aged. It had a sweet taste that caught me off guard. I was expecting all hops. They were there but in no way overpowering. The alcohol doesn't hit you until the back end and it is very very smooth.  M: Thick and syrupy. Understandable with a beer of this magnitude.  D: I could maybe put two of these down in one sitting. Just a beer that is in your face and makes no apologies...and I adore that.  What a beverage.

10099,9086,Habanero58,4.37,"So onto Dogfish Head 120 Min IPA a few days after sampling their Palo Santo Marron...  This one is a sweet, ""thin syrup"" like beer that tastes like somebody had tried to make some sort of alcoholic grapefruit marmalade including an IPA in the recipe ... more hops in the smell than the taste, which becomes more reminiscent of a sweet barley wine such as J.W. Lees Harvest Ale...but with that grapefruit twist.  Pouring into a narrow flute this gave a pretty deep foaming head that lingered throughout the tasting.  Onto the verdict ... well, like the Palo Santo Marron it certainly stands out from the crowd and like the PSM I absolutely loved it. As my very favourite beers include the Cantillon sours and the more bitter DIPA's this surprised me!  No way I could drink this all night but this bottle went down like a dream and I had no problems finishing it at all ... more please, but maybe not tonight :o)",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Wow Wow Wow. What a awesome smell. I get cirus aromas big time. Also the alcohol is picked up easilly and some pine notes that are a bit more sudel. You can also pick up the sweetness of the malts used to brew this beast!  Damn I died and whent to hop heaven. What a killer taste. Surprisingly sweet when sipped quickly and hugely bitter the longer you keep it in your mouth. Just awesome well worth the 12 dollar price I could sip on this all night! Very thick almost syrup like.

10099,9086,Flightoficarus,3.9,"Serving type - 12 oz. Bottle  Appearance - An orange-ish amber hue, similar to other IPA's. Forms a tan head upon pour with a good lacing.  Smell - Dense malts, and loads of hops. You can tell upon smell that it's going to be pretty extreme.  Taste - Wooah!! Very different, that's for sure. A massive explosion of hop flavor is complimented by a huge amount of malty sweetness. Very sweet, yet somehow, surprisingly balanced. Doesn't taste like a traditional IPA, in the sense that it is much sweeter. But the hops still dominate the palate. Beer candy is the best way to describe it.  Mouthfeel - A full bodied beer, with medium carbonation (would you expect anything less than a full bodied beer @ 20% ABV?).  Drinkability - The scary part about this beer is how drinkable it is for how strong it is. The extremely strong flavor will probably make most choose to savor it, but I was expecting something harder to drink for a beer of this strength (strong flavors conceal the high ABV). Any more than one of these is asking for some serious drunk time though.  Overall - A very unique beer, and definitely something I think every beer fan should try at least once, even if you're not a fan of traditional pale ales or IPA's.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

10099,9086,Brenden,3.85,"All my thanks to JJFoodie for one of my best trades to date, this beer being the main focus on my end.  This one is the very epitome of copper-colored. A creamy head sits sturdily on top of this one, taking a good while to dissipate and leaving a thick ring of lacing followed by some spottier lacing in the glass. The smell is sweeter than I expected. Not having read any reviews on this one beforehand, but well aware of the hype, I wasn't sure what to expect. There's lots of character and depth here, from caramelized sugars to dark fruits to possibly cane sugar to yeast to alcohol to barley (malt) and floral hops. The sweetness is incredibly strong. Aside from the alcohol, this element is enough to keep one from chugging. All of the complexities from the nose are in here, and the hops are quite strong underneath all the booze and sweetness. This absolutely must be sipped. The feel of this one is fairly thick, quite rich and creamy in feel. The body is medium to full. There's a light to moderate carbonation, and a crisp bite adds to the feel as well. This one is obviously well-crafted; while some may have difficulty with the extremity of the sweetness, the complexity and balance in this one can't be denied, and it feels great. While this one's very good, drinkability's much lower than the quality might typically account for due to the extremely high alcohol content and the sweetness that forces this one to be a sipper. I'd certainly drink more than one in a sitting, but it might knock me out.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,kaseydad,3.42,"Finally found this in Vegas.  I love the huge hop on the label. Way cool.  Pours a caramel/copper/apple juice color. The appearing head quickly vanishes to a few bubbles.  Aroma consists of sweet candy, prunes and alcohol. Reminds me of an old or strong ale.  Inital sweetness on the taste quickly kicks into a rush of candy and booze. There is a slight alcohol burn on the swallow. Definitely a sipping beer and a cigar would pair with this nicely.  Putting one back on my own was tough and would make most call it a night after one.  Overall the major sweetness and booziness was a hindrance in my enjoyment and my ability to call this a ""world class"" beer. Definitely happy I tried it though.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,BackAlleyBev,3.9,"I was excited to try this beer as the availability is very limited. I was expecting more of a head upon the pour but that's not very important to me. The aroma is complex and gives hints of cinnamon, raisins, and carmel. Upon initial taste I was surprised that a slight sweetness presented itself. Overall it's a medium body beer with plenty of character that changes sip after sip. Has a long finish that's not bitter which is surprising for a 120 minute IPA. Can only have 1 or 2 in a sitting as the ABV is very high. Cheers",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

This has always been a nice, deep, copper/amber color with good clarity. Lately though, it has been served very cloudy, almost milky in color.  This problem doesn't seem to affect the taste or aroma, though, and I've always been impressed with Dogfish's ability to make this beer. True, it has tons of alcohol sweetness but that is balanced by almost unfathomable proportions of hop flavor and aroma.

10099,9086,blaje,3.73,"Highly sought after beer. Being looking for this one for four years now! Thanks to a coworker for bringing this back up here in Montreal.  First constatation @ pouring: surprisingly liquid. Honestly, I was expecting something more liquorous, as of a port wine. Served @ 10-12 oC. Thin head forming and disepearing quickly, in less then 30sec.  Nose: Very strong nose of alcohol. Complex fruit aroma. Sweet malt burst out, literally. Floral aroma is strong. I should say impressive, certainly because of the tons of hops used is this brew. This results in mostly in floral aroma, forget anything dominating citrusy/piny nose as of regular IPAs. Mint is detectable. Caramel & toffee, sugar cane too are noted. Bitterness is surely present, but completely submerge by the high amount of residual sugar from the malt. This tempers downs a lot the pungent bitterness of the hops.  Lacing on the glass is not quite as a port wine, but very impressive for a beer. Alcohol in mouth is very impressive. You can easily compare it to a port wine. Carbonation is low, medium-low at most. In mouth, this beer is almost oily. I'm sure that if you would be able to strip down all the alcohol is this beer, the amount of hops oil in your glass would decant on top of your beer!  Overall: Impressive beer. Certainly not for the faint of heart. Worth trying, but forget having a few of this beer on the same evening. Very loading. Very challenging. Very DFH! Will age very well for MANY years.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Ek0nomik,4.15,"Poured In: Tulip Glass Purchased At: Steve's Liquor (Madison, WI)  Appearance: Pours an amber orange color with a surprisingly good amount of head. A steady stream of bubbles are floating up to the top of my glass from the center of the tulip. The head slowly faded away and there is now a thin layer of white bubbles and foam at the top of my glass.  Smell: Not the typical nose from an IIPA, but still pleasant. The alcohol makes its appearance, leading me towards the smell of a hard liquor like whiskey or brandy (I'm not much a hard liquor drinker, so I can't really pinpoint which one). Blending with the alcohol is the generous amount of hops they used to while boiling and dry hopping. Some citrus and earthy notes are unveiled, including raisins, apricot, grapefruit, orange and some pine and soil.  Taste: I expected the alcohol to be more visible on the palate than it actually is. I held out on buying this beer given the price because, quite frankly, I didn't expect this to be as good as it is. The alcohol is well hidden. I've drank IPA's with half the ABV than this one and they've revealed their alcohol notes much more.  This beer isn't as bitter as one might expect given the hop profile. It's a rather neutral beer, not being too sweet, but also not being very bitter. The palate is picking up sweetness from the caramel malts, alcohol in the form of brandy, and then finishing up with some earthy and citrus hops including the same flavors mentioned in the nose above.  Mouthfeel: Well this is just a bit odd, but I like it! If the alcohol were stripped out of this, I think you'd feel the normal coating of the mouth with hop oils. Now that the ABV is so high, the oils aren't as pronounced, but there is still a coating of the teeth, tongue and gums.  Drinkability: Too many people are knocking this down in drinkability because of the ABV. This is the style of beer they were after. I don't think it's fair to rate beer consistently based upon the status quo. While this beer is in the IIPA category, it's unlike many of it's sisters.  I don't want to drink a bomber of this in an evening, but this is a well put together beer and I'm glad I tried it. I can't say it will end up in my crate very often given the price tag, but I will mostly certainly pick this up again and keep it for a rainy (or quite special) day.

After it poured a nice orangish copper color with minimal head (a warning of the intensely high abv), everything went downhill from there. Instead of a combination of malt and hop characteristics, this thing is huge interweaving of confectionary sweetness and heavy alcohol fumes. Both cloying and burning, the syrupy texture was almost sickening in my opinion. I only drank maybe 2 ounces of the 12 ounce bottle before offering it around to anyone who might like a try before ultimately getting rid of it. Huge waste of 10 bucks.

First hops (bergamot) followed by something very sweet (almost sugary), then grapes, and a slight bitter finish. You can also taste the alcohol, but just barely under the sweet and the bitter.  Mouthfeel - no carbonation on the tongue that I noted, nothing special really, but I'll admit to being very uneducated on this point.  Drinkability - due to the high alcohol content and the unusual flavors I'd say that this is a beer to enjoy if you like cognacs.

Pale color, like a shade of clover honey with some orange-ish hues coming through with the light. Very thin film of foam forms and very small bubbles actively rise creating a thin white ring. Aroma: Deep layered hops consisting of pine, grapefruit, caramel and a sweet alcohol aroma that smells like flavored rum. A swirl of the glass intensifies the aromas and heightens everything. Mouthfeel: Very faint carbonation delivers a sweet, sticky, hop solution that actually rolls down easily but leaves enough bitterness behind that elicits a slight pucker. As it warms the sweetness comes to the front with a boozy edge that gets a little hot. A froth on the palate keeps it about the same. Definitely worth trying and I am glad that the hops lean towards the citrus and pine profiles. I was expecting more of a hop burn but I was pleasantly surprised.

I'd long wanted to sample this brew, but its cloyingly sweet, leathery smell nearly changed my mind. The taste was better. Still too sweet, but not unpleasant. It tasted like molasses filtered through crushed flowers. It was not IPA-like. Not even beer-like. (It has a nice, amber color, but a scant head.) Though I haven't tasted Southern Comfort in decades, it reminded me of that. It's drinkable, and it masks its alcohol content quite well until the dwindling aftertaste. This beer lives in the twilight zone between the beer/wine abv's and the hard liquor abv's. Not many beverages go there, and none are as popular as their weaker and stronger cousins.

10099,9086,sweemzander,3.95,"12oz. bottle poured into a tulip glass. Bottled on 2/6/09.  (A)- Pours a hazy golden orange hue that produced a great 2 finger off-white to light yellow head that is staying around for awhile; after a few minutes, its down to a 1 finger size. Some tiny bits of lacing here and there.  (S)- Massive mango, peach, pineapple, and grapefruit citrus aromas with an equally huge pine/wood component. This is some strong smelling stuff!; has a pretty serious alcohol whiff to it.  (T)- This is just massive! Very sweet; almost candied mango & peach fruits followed by a very dry grapefruit, pineapple, and bittering pine with a robust to equally massive boozy burn at the end. An ample malt backbone exists somewhere in there that is providing a light honey sweetness to the middle but is mostly overpowered by everything else in there.  (M)- Huge boozy burn with really sweet fruits and big bittering hops really makes your mouth go through a rollercoaster of layers and complexities. Sadly, the ridiculous level of alcohol is almost off-putting and destroying some really superb characters in the beer.  (D)- Just ridiculous, massive, and potent on every level imaginable. Great stuff, but is lost in the overly boozy mouthfeel. Give this 5 years and try it again, give it 10 years and try it again.

S- Definitely lots of pine hop aroma and a major rush of caramel sweetness. A bit musty with a faint alcohol scent. Not nearly as much alcohol present in the nose as what I was expecting.  T- Wow, the alcohol has made a sudden reappearance! Huge wave of alcohol and sweet/tangy citrus flavors of orange, passion fruit, and pineapple. The finish is an overwhelming flood of caramel sweetness. The alcohol is quite apparent but I wouldn't call it 'hot', even though I would describe the alcohol level in many other lower ABV brews as such. This is easily one of the booziest AND balanced DIPAs that I have ever had. I can certainly see why some others seem to think that the 120 favors the barleywine style more so than a DIPA.  M- Thick and syrupy with a pretty decent amount of carbonation. The alcohol bite flashes strong and leaves as quickly as it appeared. The sweetness is border line cloying which I wasn't really expecting.  D- Overall, this is definitely one of the most interesting brews that I have had. Way too sweet to be considered an IPA by me, but it certainly wasn't a bad brew. In fact I enjoyed it quite a bit. The alcohol, even though it is rather apparent, is exceptionally well hidden considering how strong it is. Certainly worth trying.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,chicagoish,1.46,"Anybody who's had a colonoscopy knows how hard it is to drink the prep. You hold your nose and do anything possible to distract yourself from the thick sickenly sweet, perfumely, pungent, syrup that's about to enter your body. I find myself doing the same with this brew. The sweetness is too much to take. The smell is not pleasant, and the mouth feel, combined with the above conspires to make the whole experience unpleasant. I tried really hard to finish the bottle, but alas, it's down the drain.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,kegger22,4.02,"One of the legendary beers. Poured a very cloudy amber/brown with a tiny head that became embarrassed, and shrank to nothing, immediately. The aroma was ripe, dark fruits, and sweet alcohol. The taste was boozy, malty sweet, I didn't find the highly vaunted, super hop presence here. Feel is full bodied with light carbonation. The drinkability is fair to middling. Overall, this appears to be one of those love it or hate it beer, with me firmly ensconced in the middle. 120 Minute was tasty, and I know production costs must be high, but not worth the price. Although, ya gotta have just one in your lifetime.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,jbhuxley,4.55,"I've heard about this beer for years. It is obviously not available in the Carolinas or anywhere close as far as I know. I finally got around to obtaining two 120s through a beer trade about two weeks ago. I plan on aging one but I've been waiting for the right time to drink the other, since it is so hard to for me to come by. Here we go...  Poured from a 12oz bottle into a snifter. Bottled on date reads 07/07/08. I poured this just above refrigerator temperature, wanting to experience the full range of flavors as it warmed.  Poured the whole bottle aggressively into the snifter. To my surprise, a small amount of head developed. It didn't stick around for long, as would be expected. Color is a hazy ruby amber.  Strong smell of sweet currants and alcohol. No hop character comes thorough in the aroma.  First sip has a heavy presence of alcohol, along with a brown sugary sweetness. The warming feel of the alcohol is something I've never quite experienced in a beer. The flavor is almost too complex to describe. The complexities keep changing as the beer warms. Sweet fruits, continue to dominate the flavors. It is definitely not the hop bomb I would have expected. The hops remain largely unnoticeable until it reaches room temperature. It tastes more a ruby port more than it does a IIPA.  A nice amount of carbonation keeps it from becoming to syrupy or chewy. The lasting flavor is amazing.  I can't believe I am saying this but it is relatively drinkable. I mean, it's not something to have two of, but it is great for sipping.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,cpone,3.87,"A: Amber body with little head - some retention and a bit of spotty lacing.  S: Pine covered in sap. Sweet aroma quickly follows, unlike most IPA. Very Spicy - cloves.  T: Very little hops, extremely sweet - this is to beer what port is to wine. Alcohol a major player and forces smaller than normal sips.  M: medium to full bodied. A very sweet and boozy finish.  D: Not the most drinkable beer by the standard measure, but not bad for what it is - a very high abv extreme beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

10099,9086,chas1326,2.68,"This is not a recreational beer. It is meant for beer ""sipping"". It pours with a sweet aroma and little head. It is a deep amber color and totally opaque. If you are a true IPA fan you will probably not enjoy the experience since what hoppiness it has is overpowered by the strength of the alcohol content. It will definitely make you feel good, but there are more satisfying ways to make that happen. NOT FOR IPA LOVERS!!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,kingcrowing,3.03,"12oz bottle poured in a snifter.  Pour a deep golden color, much darker than the 90 minute IPA, no head or lacing to speak of on this. It's very sweet on the nose with almost no hoppiness to it. A little suprising, but at 21%abv... don't expect anything.  taste is crazy, obviously very strong, more like a desert wine han a beer. No hop to it at all, which is a bit sad because the alcohol covers it all up and just dominates. it's very sweet and syrupy. Drinkability is so low because it's so strong. One is plenty. I split mine with a friend. You should do the same.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Beerzebub,4.25,"Poured in a big wine glass at 54 F/ 12 C.  Deep amber color, Ring and film of light beige froth, finely textured rings of lace.  Bright, powerful aroma of lemon, grapefruit, fresh spruce tips, sweet white wine, and light caramel. Just a bit of alcohol, surprisingly little. Tart and zippy, this aroma is surprising and very pleasant.  Tastes like sweet white grapes/ white wine, quite a lot, with bright citrusy hops. More lime than lemon, along with grapefruit and a bit of pine. A medium level of bitterness gradually comes in, barely putting a dent in the sweetness, but that's ok, the sweetness works well with the citrus flavors and is quite enjoyable. Long finish, sticky sweet white grape juice and bitter lime zest.  Thick sticky sweet texture. Surprisingly easy to drink for what it is, not that I would crack a second bottle.  Good interesting beer, with surprising finesse.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,sjccmd,4.08,"Pours a shimmering copper with an off white head. More of a head than I was expecting. Also, I was expecting it to be a little more gloopy.  Even mentally preparing myself, and making sure to be open minded, I was still pretty surprised by the smell. Lots of alcohol, but also a decent amount of citrus and sweetness. Avoiding big whiffs, the heat from the alcohol combines with the citrus to make an interesting smell of perhaps caramelized grapefruit. Bigger whiffs reveal a bigger punch from the alcohol.  Approaching the taste the same way as the smell, taking small sips, makes it much more palatable. Sweet pine and citrus. Toasty malts in the background. Leaves a comforting warm finish.  The subtle carbonation helps out quite a bit. If this were thicker, it may be pretty hard to drink. It also avoids being overly fizzy...but that probably wouldn't have been an issue.  If I didn't know what I was getting into, my review would probably be different. It is really boozy for a beer...but it is still drinks like a beer. I drink most of my beer fairly slowly anyway.  Overall, it's not really what you'd expect for the style, but I wouldn't disregard anything that is pushing the envelope.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Daniellobo,4.67,"Spectacular extreme IPA. Complex, heavy, and very boozy. A sipper to enjoy slowly.  Presentation: 12 oz bottle. Iconic though simple Dogfish Head Design. Another understatement other than for the front phrase, which is nowhere near to hinting at what the bottle actually holds. Green warning bottle cap points to those in the know that this is one of the extreme experimental brews from Dogfish. Printed bottling date on side (07/08/08 F), neither shows IBUs or °Plato, nor Alc. (which at about 18.0% is something that is a critical part of its identity) Poured into a medium size snifter.  A - Hazy copper color. Touch of head on the first pour that quickly goes down to a faint ring with minimal surface presence.  S - Touch of orange peel and pine resin surrounded by balmy alcohol that subdues all hoppiness. A fragrant booziness that is perceived well outside the glass.  T - Very sweet and alcohol laden first sip. It offers further complexity as it goes through with a strange heavy fruity hoppiness as the backdrop.  M - Minimal carbonation within a very heavy body and something of an oily bite to it.  D - It's a delight to drink. It has to be taken with the right attitude, in essence knowing that it is a complex brew that is better drank like one would a fine brandy  Notes: These eccentricity is a total favorite. Great as the final warming sipper after a meal or the final note for a group beer tasting dinner. I think a common misconception is that this is going to be a heavy DIPA very hoppy and bitter, whereas so many hops and malts make it very sweet, boozy and complex taking it to another range of flavors.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,crossovert,3.36,"So here it is, the 120.  Comes in a 12 fluid ounce glass with a neon green Dogfish Head logo ""warning sign"" cap. Says it ages well. Bottled on 11/06/08, so its realatively fresh. If this one doesn't go over well I'm definitely keeping one of these to cellar for a few years. It has just under a year under it's belt since it has been bottles. I would also want to try a completely fresh version of this.  Upon uncapping there is a rampant syrupy cough medicine scent. I pour it into an over-sized wine glass, has a small 1 finger head that dissipates within a minute leaving behind some speckled lacing. The lacing is very gooey, expecting a high sugar content. The beer itself is a nice dense copper/orange. There is a fair amount of yeast visible.  Initial smell was medicinal when I uncapped it but in the glass it has a decent amount of hops, and some sweet malt along with an uneconomical blast of alcohol that stings the nostrils. The hops are fruity, citrusy, and a bit spicy. You can smell the massive amount of dry-hopping that went into this brew. The malt is decidedly rummy and mixes with the alcohol.  Has a creamy, thick, and chewy mouthfeel. Not enough carbonation. Surprisingly the taste is hoppier than expected, although still dominated by cloying sweet malts though. Initial drink gives some major sweetness and some hops but on the second you can pick out a lot of citrus and tropical fruits. The alcohol serenades the tongue and intensifies the sweetness. Ends with a dry finish with some bittersweetness. It actually mellows sip after sip, probably the alcohol acting up, haha.  Overall this is one bad motherfucker, I would recommend a half bottle for yourself, and the other half to share. Its a slow sipper with just enough hops on the palate to make it worthwhile. Just pure intensity.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Tates,4.6,"Will knock you on your ass. One of the sweetest yet highest alcohol content beers I've ever had. I don't like their 60 or 90 minute IPAs, but this is a beer to be respected.

10099,9086,huguey,3.55,"I read about this monster, found it at a local Whole Foods, and just had to have a taste.  Ten month old bottle (vintage 11/06/08) poured into oversized wine glass.  A: The color is impressive, looks like a mixed orange juice and rum drink (sorry, it's the best I could describe lol).  S: Brown sugar overpowers, with Maple Syrup and orange undertones.  T: Very sweet. Extremely sweet in fact. Hops are completely overpowered, so it was weird to drink expecting a Double IPA. Alcohol comes through at the end and warms the throat, makes me shiver!  M: Oily and not extremely pleasant.  D: Good luck drinking another, I was feeling buzzed a third of the way through and I don't think I'm much of a lightweight!  Notes: Wow, I think the thing to expect with this beer is not beer but instead, make sure you think of this as a mixed drink in a bottle. It's ok, nothing I'd recommend more than once for the experience.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,DeathbySexyBT,3.75,"A: Hazy amber with a thin white head. Given the high ABV, the fact that it retained a head at all was cool.  S: Strong pine and citrus notes from the hops. A bit of white pepper smell to it actually. A slight hint of rubbing alcohol.  T: Very well assembled hop profile. Very palpable hop presence of the pine and citrus variety following the smell nicely. Slightly astringent alcohol undertone that goes from interesting to annoying as the beer warms.  M: Heavy! This is deceptively syrupy and full-bodied.  D: 21% ABV means that this is a one and done affair and should be paired with food. I like this one, but the 90 is better balanced for my taste.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,photomike,3.78,"A very highly anticipated beer for me--mostly due to novelty. Prior to cracking this beer, I think I actually FEARED it. 21%? Sweet Jesus. 9 month old bottle.  Pours beautifully; almost prototypically DIPA. Grapefruit juice hazy reddish orange with a surprisingly long lasting off-white head. An everlasting swirl of bubbles lasts on the surface and a thick ring of head sticks around forever. Some lacing, but not a ton; the only area where the appearance lacks.  Smell is really pleasant as well. Grapefruit and candied orange peel are backed with a HEAVY wallop of vapory alcohol that predictably gets more intense as the drink warms.  Taste is a party. Pine, grapefruit and tangerine citrus jive happily beneath a disco ball of carmelly malts until the local bad ass, the one the Sheriff calls ""Boozy Heat,"" kicks down the door and clears the dancefloor. Thankfully, ""Bordering-On-Cloying Sweetness"" comes in and restores balance to the situation; everyone dances together in a state of tense, forced peace. Whoa, this review is getting off the rails. Lots of nice flavors here held in a delicate balance by huge honey-sweetness. As a man that hates an overly-sweet DIPA, I am amazed at how much I like this. The ultrahigh ABV keeps you from drinking this fast enough for the sweetness to be a real issue. Minimal bitterness for a beer with so many hops invested.  Full bodied and syrupy, this beer is oily and slick with a nice warming feel going down that is rarely experienced in beer. Lightly carbonated as it should be.  This is a sipper. There is no denying it. Take it slow, take it easy, enjoy every sip, and don't reach for a second. Somehow, the bottle went by too quickly.  My fear of this beer was misguided. I loved every sip. Would buy again.  That said, this is a hard one to rate. My rating came out a B+, but I enjoyed this much more than other beers I've rated higher. Tasty stuff.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,bgjohnston,4.11,"This has been one of my favorite beer drinking experiences since I discovered it. I only have one once every 3-4 months or so, but am enjoying one on a special occasion tonight, and feel inclined to finally write a review.  Appearance is not what this beer is about. It doesn't have much of a head, even if poured vigorously; it's cloudy and a dull brown in color, and it really doesn't do much in this category.  However, as the glass gets closer to your nose, you pick up a sharp astringent smell that let's you know this one is hot. If you like this sort of thing, like I do, then you know this is something special. It is very distinctive, with grapefruit, pine sap and some sweetness, too.  A sip brings more of the same, and with real force. A major reason why I rate this one highly for taste and mouthfeel is how a few drops of this beer light your mouth up. Having been a whiskey drinker for many years, it still surprises me that a ""mere"" beer can do this.  Drinkability is what anyone should expect from something this strong. I would never dream of drinking more than one in a night, but even so, you still spend the whole evening drinking it, as it is a slow sipper.  More of an experience than just a beer. Try it at least once. If you like this sort of thing, you know who you are, and you will be back for more.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

T: Incredibly malty and sweet, too much sugar in your tea sweet. Tons of booze. Some orange flavor and seemed like some banana also. Not really any hop bitterness to this, which is unfortunate, because I feel it would really help this beer out in terms of balance.  M: Obviously this thing has enormous body, but their was almost a grainy feel to it, probably because of how sweet it was.  D: As much as I'd like to be a tough guy on the subject, this beer is not very drinkable. I'm glad to say that I've tried it, but I don't think I will have it again any time soon.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,ditch,4.13,I give this probably a higher rating than it should have for it's uniqueness and ability to mask the ABV!  Pours like a hazy iced tea with a white head that hung around for longer than i expected with the ABV.  Smell is lacking of the hops mentioned on the label. more orange and fig than of a hoppy IPA.  Taste... WOW and WTF? was not expecting it to taste like this at all! Overly sweet and lacking the bitterness i was expecting fro the hophead reference on the label. Where's the hops? hidden behind the over powering sugar and alcohol flavor that's where.  Overall not a good beer for it's classification but a well designed beer and extremely unique. a good one to share with your buddies. Not gonna be a regular pick up for me.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,ArrogantDeadGuy,2.44,A: Hazy straw hues with a good sturdy white head. Lazy carbonation.  S: No real hop nose with a dominant alcohol aroma.  T: Boozy! This was a keg from 2007 (2yrs. old) The storage caused the loss of nearly all hop character and made the beer entirely too sweet. The ABV was dominant and allowed little else to come through less the sugars.  M/D: Smooth and crisp with plenty of body and smoothness. Unfortunately the ABV and lack of hoppiness makes this a less than desireable aged brew.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

The smell is strong with sweet fruit -- apricot, raisin and fig. A bit of spicy hop, like Chinook maybe, but not as much as you'd expect for a beer that proclaims to be ""the holy grail for hopheads."" Taste is very sweet, too much for an Imperial IPA, with strong orange and tangerine, and finishes with pepper. The mouthfeel has some alcohol heat, stabs at your tongue and leaves a light burn down your throat, almost like bourbon.  Does it want to be loved or feared? I think feared.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

This wasn't even a full pour and I had a hard time finishing it off. I know it's hoppy, but the the syrupy sweetness dominates everything.

10099,9086,roadhouse,4.47,"12 oz. bottle (bottled 02/09/09) into a snifter.  Pours a mostly clear orange color with a one inch head that gradually fades to a cap which actually retains. Not much in the way of lacing, but there's a bit, and for the ABV, I'm surprised there's any head.  Aroma is excellent. Exploding with citrusy, floral hops and a huge sweet sugary and boozy background that reminds me of rum soaked raisins.  Taste is delectable as well. I think the bottle I had last time was a lot older and this one has much more hops. At first there is a big burst of hops but it is quickly supplanted by a huge dose of caramel and sugary sweetness again with the raisin taste recurring. The sweetness is taken over by the hops once again to leave a wonderful citrusy hop flavor on the palate. Finish is actually quite balanced with nice fruit and sweet malt flavors blending with the hop bitterness, just tasting awesome making you want another sip.  Mouthfeel is medium-full, quite smooth going down, I would guess this at 8% ABV at most. The alcohol is hardly noticable at all.  Such a unique and excellent beer.

Nose- Oranges, faint floral hop aroma, burnt sugar?  Palate- Much sweeter than expected. Hops are present, but not what you would expect from a 120 ibu beer. Personally I think it could use a bit more bitterness. The orange flavors carry though to palate, combined with the alcohol it reminds me of a fine orange liquor. Alcohol is present but hidden well.  Mouthfeel- Thick, syrupy  Drinkability- I thought one would be my limit, but as I near the bottom of the glass, the hops start to shine through a bit more, making me want another.

Poured from a 12oz bottle into an oversized wine glass to celebrate my 33rd birthday. Moderate pour evokes a 1/2 inch of head which really surprised me given the alcohol content. Very spotty lace. Color, due in part to the second portion of the bottle, is a very cloudy dull orange.  Nose- Alcohol, a thick aroma of sour oranges. Reminds me a bit of a barely wine.  Palate- Super sweet and sticky. Very reminiscent of a port wine only a bit hotter. Some very nice concentrated caramel flavors. Some woodiness and notes of orange rind. Like a sweet less volatile version of grand mariner.  Mouthfeel- Cloying, tangy and thick.  Drinkability- I was glad I split this with the GF.

Mouthfeel - Sticky and smooth at the same time with the sweetness it feels like it could give you cavities.

The beer is bright orange, like coolaide, although slightly hazed.  S- Strong orange rind, grapefruit, alcohol and some floral notes.  T- Super sweet upfront, orange, floral hops. I get the sense of biscuty malts laying a base. Followed by some big alcohol. Theres some piney flavors.  M- Thick syrupy, its like sap almost. Medium carbonation.  D- Real boozy, sticky and sweet, makes this one a sipper Ill probably not try again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,esv,3.43,"A) Beer is orangish. Great head, it dissipates over time, but good considering the ABV. White head. Sediments floating around. Beer got stirred up on a short hike before drinking. Lacing all the way down.  S) Sweet and hoppy.  T) Big 'ol prunes. Big, spicy alcohol that cuts some of the sweetness. Sweet, Sweet, Sweet, Crusty-Sweet. Cotton Candy. Intensely bitter but easily overpowered by the malt. Winey.  M) Big and heavy and big.  D) I mean, what can you say here. I hurt all over. It beats you up a little. I enjoyed it, but it wasn't easy killing all 12 oz.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,taylorhamrick,3.26,"Pours a nice and clear burnt golden orange, the last little bit of the pour provides a nice cloud of haze that falls through, and then clears up nicely. The head is moderate, but I mean, it's got to be hard to carbonate a beer this high in alcohol, leaves minimal lacing. But it actually looks nice. The smell is primarily peachy alcohol, some raw sugary smells, a bit of raisins and dates, a tiny bit of esters, maybe some tart cherries, a tiny bit of spice, and a sweet, syrupy maltiness. The taste is kind of interesting, like bread pudding, maybe french toast, soaked in rum, with raisins, dates, plums, cherries, etc., just like a syrupy, sweet, kind of malty, bready burst. Just huge on flavor, a bit of esters, some light tart cherry hoppiness, nice, but not as much hoppiness as you would expect from 120 minutes of hopping and 30 days of dry hopping. But the alcohol rules this one for the most part. Not my favorite thing in beer, but actually, for the ABV, this one seems like much less than it actually is. And surprising, a lot less syrupy than even some other DFH beers. It actually does a nice job finding the balance between dry and sweet. Very good. Light carbonation, and any burn provided is upstaged by alcohol burn. The drinkability, well it speaks for itself. It took me well over half and hour to finish 4-5 oz, and I can say that the last 5 or 6 sips will probably take me another 10-15 minutes. Very slow drinking. But overall, an interesting beer, though for the amount of stuff that goes into it, it has a few less dimensions that I would expect. Not an everyday drink, maybe not even possibly a once a year thing for me. But it's worth the experience I'd say.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,neenerzig,4.55,"I have had a bottle of this sitting in my fridge since I picked up a few bottles of this in Arizona in September of last year. I also have 2 bottles sitting in my cellar. Finally decided to crack it open tonight. A 12 oz poured into my tulip glass. Pours a very cloudy and hazy orange/golden color. White head is about 1/2 inch when poured, settles to a nice thick ring lining the inside of the glass with a thin surface coating about 10 minutes after being poured. I can definetly see some yeast bits in here too. Very nice lacing. The aroma of alcohol along with a nice strong citrus aroma and also a piney, floral tart smell. Has a sweet, caramel malt, Belgian candy sugar sweetness upfront, followed by the citrus fruit tart flavor, rounded with with some floral hops. The piney, floral hop flavor is here too, but not that strong. Certainly less hoppy here than when I had it on-tap in Boston last year. The flavor of alcohol also seems to me a bit more apparent this time than when I had it on-tap last year. Has a full bodied, syrupy, chewy, thick, crisp mouthefeel with moderate carbonation. Certainly easier to drink than I would have thought, especially as it warms up a bit. I can't wait to see what a few years will do to the bottles of this that I am aging.

10099,9086,MaxBrews,4.55,"Presentation: 12oz poured into a snifter  The holy grail for hopheads lets see how it faired in my glass.  Appearance: Glowing bright orange. Pours with a surprising head for the ABV as well as a soapy lacing. However as the beer warms up this dies almost altogether even upon agitation.  Smell: A musty hard alcohol smell is the first that hits you which is surrounded by citrus fruit and pineapple. A little bit of a biscuity malt in the scent.  Taste: Strong and intense pineapple taste and sweetness, followed by a biscuity finish. Surprisingly well hidden ABV for 18%. Alcohol warmth is more pronounced as the beer warms up. Being this strong of an ipa and with this alcohol content it does have a huge hop & alcohol bite bite but its pretty masked by the pineapple/citrus finish. This beer is very complex, the barley wine of IPAS.  Mouthfeel: bitterness followed by sweetness with a huge alcoholic warmth. There is a firm carbonation. This beer does bit your tongue and is an intense experience with a full body.  Drinkability: I give this beer a 5 due to the simple fact that it is fairly easy to drink for how high of a ABV. This not a beer to have often its a special experience. Its also 7-8$ a bottle. I feel anyone who is interested in strong beers and imperial IPAS should have this at-least once in their life. Anyone who doesn't like strong beers need not apply. I spent two hours sipping this beer and as it warms up it changes a lot. I'd give it a go again, I'm kinda craving it right now just because I feel i Diddn't get all the flavors down in my tasting.  I gave this beer an A because due to its high level of craft and the fact that Dogfish was able to pull it off. Just because its an A don't run out and buy it thinking it will be excellent. This is an experience not a session.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,KarlHungus,4.5,"This beer pours a clear red-orange color. The head is a half an inch in height, and recedes slowly into a quarter inch of lacing. Due to the extremely high alcohol content I was expecting the head to be minimal at best, and am very pleasantly surprised. The aroma is very hoppy with lots of pine and citrus. There is a lot of malt too, but it is soft and easily takes a back seat to the hops. The alcohol is present in the terms of adding a slight cough syrup note. It is, however, a lot more subdued than I expected, and I like that. The taste has a bite...wow. There is more malt here with an almost mead like honey character. The citrus, and pine from the aroma are present, but the malt masks the bitterness which I'm sure is in there somewhere. The mouthfeel is full bodied with appropriately low carbonation, and a silky texture. Overall, this is a very interesting beer, and huge kudos go out to DFH for dreaming it up. I certainly couldn't drink this every day, or even every month. But I'm could picture myself sipping this down two or three times a year, and thoroughly enjoying it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

I've never had two bottles taste the same - which I happen to enjoy as it just tells me the beer is made with real ingredients.  The beer has an agressive aroma - you can get a whiff of it long before you pour it. It's a heady aroma of hops and you can smell the alcohol. This is a beer that needs age.  Some bottlings were much more out of balance than others. There is a definite alcohol burn which should mellow over time.  I like a more balanced offering, but this is a well-crafted beer of high quality and I wish I had the ability to keep it for a couple years before imbibing. Alas, nothing in the house ever lasts that long.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Taste is alot better then i expected. I thought this was going to be like eating straight hops. it was actually more floral sweet then hoppy bitter. you can taste the alcohol in the after taste. It is an amazing beer. I'd rather drink one of these then a six pack of something else, and its just as alcoholic! full bodied beer. wish i can get them a bit cheaper.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,TheBeerWolf,3.42,A - Pours a very light copper. A little cloudy which is to expected with a hop monster like this. There was a bit of a white head but it quickly went down to lace ring.  S - Huge hop smell. Spicy lemons and other citrus fruits. Some flower like notes also.  T - Christ almighty its hop candy. The sweetness slaps you in the face. There is still plenty of hop character there. Piney hop presence but mostly the sweetness overwhelms. Not horrible but if I did not know better I would think its some super sweet malt liqour or something. With everything else going on I don't really get much bitterness out of it. Strange.  M - The mouthfeel is pretty silky. leaves mouth puckering piney resin on your tongue after every sip.  D - Like I said not horrible but it will be a chore to even get through this 12 oz bottle. If you do buy one leave it in a closet for like years. It might mature into something else. Then again maybe not. A unique brew for sure but don't know if I will ever get another one. 90 minute and 60 minutes are pretty good drinkable IPAs. This is something else entirely.

Smelled somewhat lemony with a hint of banana?  Taste was pretty wild with the lemon zing, malty sweetness and prominent alcohol along with the dry finish. The sweetness of this beer drops the drinkability score.  A unique velvety mouthfeel from this full bodied brew...Not overly carbonated.  Not a beer to be taken lightly..This is a sipper for sure.

Amazingly sweet taste with a big bold hop flavor. Not sure how they got those two conflicting tastes to be so bold and go together so well but they did it. Both are fighting for the prominent taste. Follows by a huge alcohol flavor, very warming. Sweet but somehow dry finish, maybe because of the alcohol.  Very full and smooth in the mouth with an alcohol bite on the tongue.

10099,9086,PhillyStyle,3.68,"12 oz bottle at Union Jack Pub and Restaurant (Winchester, VA):  Appeared a very nice rich copper/amber color with a huge white head that had good retention that was reduced into a thin cap.  The aroma, WOW, no real hops to mention, smelled more like a wheat wine, sweet, rich, fruity. I think that the alcohol was hidden very well.  The taste is excellent but if you are a hop head, stay away. The taste is much like the aroma, malted barley sweet with no hops to mention, with some fruit hints and again more like a wheat wine than a DIPA. I don't really recall much alcohol at the beginning of the beer, but much more so as the beer warmed up. Going into this beer, I was aware of the style, so I gave it a lower mark than if I had not since I was trying to compare it to other DIPA's.

And before drinking it's rather apparent how much alcohol is in this drink just by smell alone. T: Wow, very very strong taste. Both the alcohol as well as the hops kick you in the face right away. After that, very sweet aftertaste that I can describe as fantastic. Still, the initial taste is off-putting to say the least. M: No complaints, nothing special.

Aroma is strong, hoppy, and surprisingly fruity - the orange and hop aromas battle for dominance, so one whiff is hoppy while the next is of orange. It pours a hazy orange-amber with a fairly thick and rather persistent white head. Flavor is richly orange and a little sweet with a firm hoppy but only slightly bitter hop undertone. This is quite unlike any IPA I have ever had - well worth the effort of setting up a trade!

Boozy, rubbing alcohol, bit of hops. The empty bottle smells like one gigantic hop.  Sweet, caramel, warm alcohol. Complex malt and hops. Wine like complexity to this beer.  Feels like honey on the palate. Outstanding carbonation feel on the tongue. Velvety smooth and full bodied. Warming sensation all the way down.  Definitely a sipper with this kind of ABV. I didn't think it was 21%. I guessed 15% when drinking it. I would like to age a bottle or two of this. Have to try this once in your life.  *Update 2/24/15: (1/14/15 bottle date) After several years since first having this, I had to update. The nose is full of incredible hop cone goodness. Huge citrus and fruity hops. The taste is like a Hopslam on steroids. It has the honey sweetness like said beer with huge hop presence that lacks strong bitterness.

There is no more than a hint of hops. the flavor is pretty good, although too sweet. it is truly difficult to describe the flavor other than sweetness. some fruit in the aftertaste (perhaps peach or apricot?). Lots of alcolhol of course.  M- The best part of the beer. thick, and well carbonated. the flavors linger and continue to develop long after the swallow. amazing.  D- for what you would expect from 20% abv, this beer is highly drinkable. despite it being a little too sweet (which inhibits drinkability for me more than the alcohol) the only thing(s) that would hold me back from drinking multiple units would be the price and how hammered i would be after two or three.  all around, a good. beats the hell out of 90 minute and 60 minute.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

I had such high expectations for a beer that I thought I was going to have, then after the first sip those expectations were blown out.  The appearance is a good orange amber color. With a strong pour I could barely pull off a one finger head. The bottle is absolutely beautiful, and the yield sign on the cap is there for a reason. When moved around the glass the alcohol just left a residue of pure silk.  The smell was just out of this world. It smells like fresh grinded hops with sugar. I could not smell the alcohol, but rather a booziness to the whole feeling. When swirled in a wine glass the aroma rushes in and takes control. Amazing.  The taste was nothing of what I was expecting. It has a taste of sugar, and alcohol, and light candy taste. The alcohol taste is not hidden, but rather accompanied by the sugar, and it just makes for an unique experience. Maybe a little too much sugar for my palate.  The mouthfeel was nuts. You could take a sip, then wouldn't have to take another because the flavor of the brew stays and evolves on the palate. Imagine getting a deep tissue massage on your tongue, that is what its like.  The drinkability is not the greatest for some obvious reasons. There is an alcoholic boozy aspect that changes the name of the game. This is technically like drinking four or five brews, in the same time it takes you to drink one. It is a little too sugary and a hop characteristic is not as prevalent as I was hoping. I would for sure buy another, but getting this one was like pulling teeth off a tiger. Amazing brew from an amazing brewery.  J",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Strong, sweet, intense malt. Some caramel, candi sugar, and just general sweetness. A little bit of pineapple and/or general citric hops as it hits the back of the palate. Alcohol and a very warming/burning sensation as it goes down. Thick and creamy mouthfeel that I really enjoyed, somewhat velvety.

Heavy nose of glazed apricots, peaches and pineapple, this even beats down the sweet pink grapefruit, tangelo citrus, finds room for pine sap and a light dusting of cocoa too, smells like a ""dessert"" beer. Full-bodied, spicy, hot and boozy entering the mouth. Tiny fizz for carbonation, nowhere what's needed to cut through the abundant flesh of the apricot, peach, nectarine, pineapple, mango fruit.

A thin ring of froth clings to the edge of the glass. Translucent... Almost opaque. Light penetrates, but that is all that penetrates.  Smells... Sweet. Uber malt over malt divided by malt to the maltiest power all of which is multiplied by isopropyl alcohol. Reminiscent of extract of malt liquor.  A variety of flavors... But not really. Sugar, cane sugar, brown sugar, honey. Pure sweetness. And not in a good way. There is no balance at all to this flavor. At the very end of the swallow I can detect a faint honey-dijon mustard flavor.  The mouthfeel on this beer could be great, but the taste is so bad that I can't stand to roll it around long enough to tell. It's nice, but the flavor kills it.  As for drinkability... Ummm... No?

10099,9086,BaltimoreMike,4.7,"So I finally did it. I broke down and spent $8 for one 12oz bottle of beer. Overall impression - it is awesome. Very think, hoppy, strong, and surprisingly smooth for such a strong beer. Kind of reminds me of a Chimay Red label in it's flavor and drinkability. It's definitely not your football Sunday beer at the bar, it's much more refined. A beer that you would drink while enjoying a great steak, or hanging with some friends and talking in more of a relaxed setting. What I'm trying to say is that if you get this beer, be somewhere that you can truly enjoy the flavor and the quality.  Over all grade is an A. The only downside is the price. It's really hard to justify spending $8 per beer on a regular basis, and it doesn't matter how good the beer is, that's just too much money.

10099,9086,association330,3.75,"Love the 60 and 90-Minute versions of this brew, so when I saw the 120 singles on the shelf of my local co-op, it was an easy choice.  A - Pours a thick, cloudy amber. Fleeting cap of foam quickly evaporates to a thin ring. Minimal lacing.  S - Piney, citrusy hops. Bitter orange and grapefruit peels lend a distinct, juicy sourness. There's some caramel malt sweetness in the background, and even perhaps a touch of dark fruits, but the hops dominate as expected. I was anticipating alcohol to singe my nasal passages, but surprisingly I cannot detect any.  T - Extreme caramel sweetness up front, that builds into candy sweet flavors of dark fruit. The swallow is sour with bright citrus and only moderately bitter. Makes the mouth water, just like eating orange or grapefruit segments. Definitely some alcohol present, but it's held in check nicely. A sweet and citrusy aftertaste lingers.  M - Luxurious and creamy, which leads to a great swallow. Carbonation is on the low end of moderate. Warming, numbing alcohol present, of course.  D - At 21% ABV, this is the epitome of a slow sipper. At $8.99 per 12 oz. bottle it is pretty hard on the wallet for most, including me, but I'm glad I gave it a try. A unique summertime nightcap.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,0tt0,2.54,"My second go at DFH 120. My recollection of the first one isn't too favorable, to be quite honest. Time to take another stab roughly two years after the fact.  You can smell it as soon as you pop the cap: big-time orange, almost candied orange, and a bit of peach and apricot. Swirling the glass creates this amalgamation of head and honey-colored beer that is about the most tantalizing thing I've ever seen. As it settles, though, it loses some of that appeal. A 1/4 inch head and a color that light cannot penetrate.  The taste: like the nose, oranges, but its odd. Sweet, candied ginger flavors mix with the tart citrus but are, alas, overcome by the hot, hot alcohol and big malt sweetness. (An aside: Sam Adam's recent double witbier suffered from this same issue--too sweat, too hot, handicapping any nuance from penetrating the surface). The hops are certainly there, but the dominant note, from start to finish, is heat. In fact, it reminds me of putting too much wasabi or horseradish on something: whatever goodness lies beneath is elided by machismo of too much.  I like 'extreme' beers, but this falls into the class of big guns/big tits/big explosion American-style overkill that ruins what might have been a good thing. Nuance? Forget it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,tr4nc3d,2.11,"Poured from a 12fl oz bottle into my pint glass  Pours a dirty hazy orange color(not to attractive looking if you tell me)with a one inch light fluffy slightly off-white head. The head resides on average leaving a slight white layer on top of the beer(not much)and around the edges of the beer.  You could smell the alcohol on this as I was pouring it into the glass. Besides the prominent alcohol, which is almost liquor like smell, I got dried stale fruit, especially oranges come to mind, slight grapefruit, and some piney/grassy hops. The alcohol really dominates though.  Man oh man, too much going on and not in a really good way either. Starts off with a strong alcohol like burn/bite(go-figure since its 21%)and in comes a very sweet sugar like taste to try and cover the alcohol which fails very much. Thats about all your going to get out of this beer. Alcohol is dominant all throughout this beer and leaves a liquor like burn way after you taken your sip(and I mean you will be sipping this bottle of alcohol).  Mouthfeel is very syrup like and teeth clinching with an alcohol burn. Definite sipper.  For those who dare to have another bottle of this, you sir just want to get drunk. For the taste and high alcohol and price tag, I will never, I repeat never drink this stuff again. I will stick to 60 and 90 minute IPA for sure.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,ralree,4.06,"A: Raisiny and dark, opaque, with a nice tan head. Retention good, lacing basically non-existant. A real winner for looks.  S: Really alcoholic and raisiny. It's like Mr. Raisin and the Raisinettes just beat the crap out of you, which isn't all that appealing in my book. Hops are somewhere down there as well.  T: Raisins, dark fruit, really tart, brown sugar, more raisin flavor after swallowing. The tartness makes it much more palatable than it could be, and the sugar covers up the alcohol flavor nicely. I didn't think I'd like this one, but even though it's really sweet for my taste, it is quite satisfying.  M: Really thick and chewy, almost like oil. Dry after swallowing. Leaves the mouth clean except for the insane flavor - no oily remnants. Carbonation is perfect for the style. Non-astringent.  D: Goes down really well, but it IS really sugary. Not cloying, just feels like you're drinking dessert. That's the only thing stopping me from pounding this thing. Good for a dessert beer, but not to be served with a meal.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,greenjeff4141,3.25,"A: Poured a rich amber color with almost no head. Very thick.  S: Hops and the tingle of alcohol on the nose.  T: Very sweet like honey, and then the hops. For a IPA that brags about being hopped for 30 days and 120 min the hops wasn't as strong as I would have liked. Not much bitterness but rather a tad citric, almost sour in the end. But the sweetness finishes everything.  M: Very rich and syrupy. A bit oily and definitely heavy. A small amount of carbonation. Very smooth.  D: For a beer of this ABV content surprisingly easy to drink. A sipper for sure, but seems like it would be easy to swig away.  A gimmicky beer that is good to try once or twice but not the best IPA by far. I think it is a show of what can be done if all the stops are taken out in the brewing process and someone is allowed to go nuts. The sweetness, ABV and the price tag make it too far out of the ordinary though to get used to.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,ThaBobfather,4.23,"Pours a cloudy orange/copper color with a sampling of medium bodied beige/white head. Smells nearly overwhelmingly floral. Highly noticeable twinge of hops with a solid malt back-up. Taste has notes of honey, some rind, grain, bitter hops, a little malt, and a boozey quality. Finish is crisp with a decent bite to it with a very earthy floral after-taste. Drinks incredibly well for being wine strength, there is a noticeable alcohol bite, but this beer is an impressive feat.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

D - It killed the taste buds pretty quick.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,jballeng,2.26,"Poured a murky dark amber with a smallish head. Aroma of hops and alcohol. Accents of booze, hops, and cough syrup. Mouthfeel likewise similar to syrup. Drank it slow and tried to think of it not as a normal beer, but this did not help. Way too sweet and viscous for my taste. A shame, as I was really looking forward to trying this beer. My dropping $12 on a 12oz is testament to that. A big disappointment all around.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,mltobin,3.55,"12 ounce bottle, most expensive of that size I have bought.  Appearance is a dark golden color with a smallish head. It smells boozy, some vinegar, some sweetness. The taste is carbonated, molasses, sugar, hops, very thick. Mouthfeel seems to be a combination of a strong barleywine and a DIPA with an extra couple punches. This beer is serious, as you could easily see just be looking at the ABV. Drinkability was fine for one of these. I was glad that I finally had one, a very unique and good beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,NewGeneric,4.32,"Shared this earlier tonight with a friend and was pleasantly surprised. From all the reviews I'd read I was expecting something not quite my taste. Poured a beautiful golden/orange beer with very little head. Smelled of hops, alcohol, honey, and fruit. Tasted wonderful, almost like a cross between beer and port. Mouthfeel was exceptional, going down incredibly smooth with just enough carbonation. Incredibly enough, I drank my half pretty quickly and found myself wanting another, though had I had a whole one to myself it may have been a different story.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,charliedango,1.23,"I'm under the impression at this point that my review is unfair as I believe I got an outdated bottle.

Again, I may have gotten a bad bottle.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,thekanna,4.6,"A: Pours a gorgeous orange / dark amber with a thin white head.  S: HOPS! Lychee flavors galore. Resonant fruit-flavored hard candy sweetness permeates the background.  T: Gorgeous barleywine taste with freshly made caramel and sugar cane. Hops slowly ease in and then saturate the palate. The sweet malt to hop taste conversion is perfect. Every drop of this radiates with flavor and juiciness. Aftertaste is somewhat phenolic and reminiscent of Lillet. I think this is what people are referring to when they say ""sweet, sweet beer"".  M: Extremely heavy wth an oily and slick feel as it enters the mouth and goes down.  D: This is one stellar brew, meant only to be sipped. At $10 a bottle, this was completely worth it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,AVDeuph,3.32,"Served in a snifter, my first taste of this famous and infamous brew.  A: A dark copper-orange color, which is quite pretty. No head to speak of, naturally.  S: Interestingly, when I smelled first out of the bottle, I smelled only hops, and I was really excited. When I poured into the snifter, it really came alive, and not entirely in a better way. Some very strong paint-thinner edge, which is essentially the primary aroma.  T: Extremely sweet up front, tastes an orange-lemon-hop syrupy extract. It is a little bitter on the finish, but no nearly enough to balance the crazy sweetness. I do like some things about it though, and the taste is definitely more agreeable than the aroma to me, as the paint-thinner parts were able to translate to non-paint-thinner flavors.  M: Extraordinarily slick and syrupy, yet I wouldn't say it is undercarbonated at all. In fact considering what the 21% ABV might predict in regards to carbonation I'd say the carb levels are much higher than expected, and I think that is important and helps the beer a great deal.  D: Drinkability is probably the most subjective category, because there isn't really a good definition to go off of in the first place. Can I drink it? Definitely, it tastes good and I paid a premium for it. Can I (or anyone really) have more than one? Very unlikely, not to mention I paid a premium for it. But considering the extremity of the beer, I think drinkability is average.  A very interesting beer. If I didn't dislike the aroma so much, I think I really would have liked it. Maybe next time I'll leave it in the bottle ;)",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,MeisterBurger,3.5,"Had this after a DFH 60 minute and 90 minute IPA.  Bottled on 11/06/08. Reviewed on June 4 of the following year.  Pours a beautiful, rich copper with a fizzy, clingy head which dies down to a thin film and then dies down to nothing at all. Some lacing but nothing to write beer advocate about.  Smells like brandy and canned pears, maybe some apricot. For something that was supposedly dry hopped every day for a month I'm surprised how little hops I pick up in the nose. I just get sweet fruity booze. No bad thing. It smells good. Just not like any dry hopped Imperial IPA I've ever had before.  Holy estery esters of estrosity batman! Tastes like candied pears drizzled in brandy. Some bitterness. A super hit of dizzyingly warming alcohol with every sip. Fruity and boozy are the two words which best describe this. Almost more like a sweet mead than a beer.  Mouthfeel is full...and sticky. It kind of coats the tongue with sugar and numbs it with alcohol. I'm finding I need to sip some water in between sips of this. Yeah. This is a beer to savour slowly. Very slowly.  Alas, if this is the holy grail for hops heads that the label suggests then I did not choose wisely. Because, honestly, it's decidedly unhoppy. It's more than anything sugary. If it's in any way bitter it's far more cloying and the saccharine beats the bitterness by a longshot. And holy fuck is it ever alcoholic  American Double/Imperial IPA? Not really. A double imperial quadrupel india pale eisbock barley wine brewed with yeast that was on steroids....maybe. If beer is a social lubricant than this is more like a social anesthetic.  Sam Calagione is the devil. I mean that in a good way. I could see this beer being even better with some age because it sure kicked me in my ass, and I'd love to try it again after it mellows out a bit.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,JoEBoBpr,2.68,Poured into a snifter.  A - Poured a dark honey colored with some haze to it. a .5 in head that left quick and left a nice thin mat.  S - Smell initially of some pears and peaches. Then the warm alcohol gets in there.  T - Taste is very fruity and sweet. Alcohol quickly warms the tongue. There are some hints of pale malt in there with bread hints and then subtle hops after tastes and floral hints. Most of these come at the end of it. Honey sweetness is extremely present.  M - Very oily and full bodied. Complex.  D - Not my favorite. Its a nice experiment to have once but I prefer other IIPA's,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,ShogoKawada,4.44,"A- pours golden brown with no head. Looks like apple cider, actually. Cloudy/milky appearance, like coffee with a creamer or unfiltered apple juice.  S- Like smelling concentrated hop oil. You've never smelled a beer like this.  T- WOW. Taste kicks you in the face. What's surprising, though, is you taste the hops and a sweetness, but you don't taste the alcohol. You can taste it, however, after you exhale. This is more like 'hop juice' than it is a beer. This really is the holy grail for hop heads.. You have to try this just to experience the first sip. After the initial shock wears off and the alcohol numbs your tastebuds, the beer gets a little mellower and the flavors start to really work well.  M- Very nice, considering the alcohol content. Not too carbonated. Warm going down.  D- I'm mixed on this, it goes down very smooth considering it tops out at 20%, which is insane. You're better off splitting a bottle or only having 1 12 oz for yourself, though. Doing 2 of these in a night would almost certainly cause you a lot of problems. About 1/3 of the way through, my head started feeling really warm. This packs a ridiculous punch, which is compounded by its drinkability.  Final thoughts: I buy 4-6 of these a year. Good for a special occasion, but more than 1 of these a month and you'll overdo it. Still, these store every well, I have put a couple in storage and have been satisfied with how well they sit. Dogfish hits the bullseye with this beer and show again how they are on the forefront of brewing. An extreme extreme beer on steroids, this beer is not for the weak.

Maybe, I just fell victim to the hype or I'm making untoward comparisons, but at 21% abv, this beer should be better. I'm not slamming 120 min. I thoroughly enjoyed my bottle. It was delicious and probably a testament to the skill of the brewery that the alcohol is felt so little. However, at 10% abv higher than the best DIPA in the world (Pliny the Younger, in my experience), I was expecting some sort of extreme flavor or something otherwise outlandish. The mouthfeel isn't even as thick as many a much lower proof barleywine. At any rate, the beer is a fairly thick golden liquid with a good head. The hops dominate with a citric-orange flavor, but the malt isn't terribly far behind with an excellent caramel sweetness. The beer is fairly sweet but, shockingly, never cloyingly so.

A thin white head, some nice lacing.  Smells of really piney hops, sweet citrusy malts, apple cider, wine, vineger, alcohol, very complex.  Tastes sweet and cidery upfront, a nice piney hop aftertaste, not really balanced, seems more sweet than a hopbomb. The alcohol is very well hidden and will creep up on you for sure.  Thick cidery mouthfeel, not too carbonated.

One finger of off white head slowly dissipated into a thin film and eventually disappeared all together.  Aroma= intensely complex- a mix of alcohol, rich malty sweetness, caramel, and piney/resinous/citrus/grapefruit hop notes merry together in the nose. almost smells like cognac.  Taste= malty sweetness hits the front of the tongue first, followed by a myriad of flavors (similar to aroma) from the over-the-top amount of hops used in the creation of this beer. hop bitterness tickles the sides and back of the tongue. finishes with a relatively good balance between bitter and sweet- though the bitterness and dry hop flavors linger on the back of the tongue for quite some time as the malty sweetness fades.  Mouthfeel= medium to low carbonation, slightly syrup-like, with a complex and full body. slightly warming from the alcohol content.  Drinkability= dangerously drinkable for a &gt;20% ABV beer- though the cognac-esque nature of the beer begs you to sip and enjoy slowly! increases in aroma and flavor as it warms. do yourself a favor with this one- take your time and soak it all in...Cheers!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Great smelling brew, like cutting open a apricot and taking a whiff. The taste was very sweet, but not too overbearing and there were plenty of complexities that wafted in and out of your perception. At 21%, obviously you aren't drinking a lot of these, but I enjoyed my 8 oz pour very much. Really impressive.

Very sweet, totally smell the alcohol, but really, really distinct. Very faint hops smell, but then the sweet alcohol fumes take over. The taste is a complex mix of mostly sweet alcohol - brown sugar and molasses - but then there is a surprisingly subtle underlying hop bitterness that holds it together and really keeps things interesting. The hops come through more as the beer warms. Medium body with very little carbonation and a nice oiliness.

Fruit, pine, wood, candied sugar...all of these notes waft up into the nose in a dance of powerful hoppy aromas.  T - Wow. Just wow. I would have never expected a beer like this to be this sweet and smooth. My cousin, with whom I shared the bottle, said it tasted like hops and watermelon. I'm inclined to agree with his observation, as the pine, fruit, floral notes, and downright sweetness of this extreme brew permeate one's palate. Almost no bitterness; finishes oily on the tongue.  M - Almost syrupy, but still well carbonated and smooth. The body is fuller than a RIS and really easy on the bitterness.  D - I'm always using hyperbolic warnings against really drinkable high ABV beers. Well, this time, I really mean it. This stuff is like hop candy, and will destroy you if you're not careful.

Ended up getting two goblets of the 120 to start of the night. There's a little bit of apple on the nose but it mostly just comes through as sweetness- the alcohol is certainly there. I expected a lot from this beer and it didn't necessarily disappoint at all. The 90 minute is a really complex beer and at times, this rivals it in that regard, but not completely... The hoppiness is there from the start and you know it's a dogfish head brew, that's for sure. There's a lot of sweetness there too with a huge lingering alcohol taste.

Smell was sweet. Taste was sweet and very alcoholic. Not hoppy like the other ones dogfish has. Actually this beer has a sweet candy taste to it. A tiny bit of sour taste too. This beer you cannot take a swig of and just swallow, it won't let you. Makes your mouth feel like your sucking on a sweet candy. Let me tell you this, the beer after you drink it, you will be feeling mighty warm from the 21% ABV! I shrugged it off at first then pow it hit me.. this is strong stuff!!

Complex aroma creeps up to my nose, outdoorsy, hoppy, fruity, and then a bit of brown sugar or burnt sugar or caramel. Delicious aroma.  Perfectly balanced hop bitterness and the a bit of sweetness not cloying but my friend described it as syrupy. The alcohol warms the back of your throat and you can feel it, but it is not a burning. I enjoyed it more as it warmed slightly.  Full-bodied ale mouthfeel, not watery, but not heavy in any way. I could drink a lot of these but I'd fall off my stool after two.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Deus1138,3.97,"I have been dying to try this stuff for a while. Since we can't get it here in GA, I had my cousin from Delaware pick me up some.  Pour into a pint glass. Hazy, cloudy, gold color with very little head. Not a lot of carbonation, but it's cool watching the the bubbles slowly make their way through this thick, hazy brew. This is one of the strongest smelling brews I've sampled. It's very sweet and citrusy smelling. It's almost like a citrus candle. Taste is pretty good. Very hoppy, citrusy. Grapefruit comes to mind. There's also a lot of sweetness is the background. Alcohol is present, but not as much as you'd expect. I mean, it's 20% alcohol, so I was expecting it to be very noticeable. You definitely feel the alcohol as it warms your mouth, throat, and stomach. Mouthfeel is thick and heavy. It's a slightly syrupy brew. Whoa... excuse me. Burps are very citrusy. :-) Drinkability is good. It's something you should try at some point. Can you handle all the flavor and alcohol?? I don't think I could have done this a couple of years ago when I first ventured into craft beer. No one should drink more than one of these per night! It's drinkable, not chuggable!  Very glad I tried this. If this were available in my area, I'd buy for special occasions as a novelty for people to try.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Larrytown,3.46,"Pours a vibrant orange with a tiny cap of quickly dissipating foam. We definitely have a boozy smell here. Lots of sugar too, but it's not covering up the alcohol. I've only smelled it and I feel kind of drunk.  This is an intense beer. I almost wanted to say ""complicated"", but that's not right. It's not like there are a lot of flavors delicately darting in and out of your mouth or anything. Instead it's BAM alcohol, BAM sugar, BAM hops. Repeat. Then repeat again.  My first impression was simple: ""This isn't beer; it's liquor."" Put aside for a moment the incredibly high ABV, that's not even what I'm talking about. I'm referring more to the experience of drinking it; it's a lot like scotch or bourbon. The smell hits you hard and you ain't taking anything more than a sip at a time. The deeper you get in the glass, though, you start to pick out the deeper elements.  Sure enough, as the drink went on, it began to recede into a beer-like category for me, but still way over the top, though not necessarily in a bad way. As you get used to the more vibrant flavors, the hops have a chance to come out and you almost notice something you'd call ""balance"". But not quite.  At the very least, you have to concede that this is one-of-a-kind. I don't know if I see myself coming back to it, but I'm glad I tried it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,LordAdmNelson,3.28,"A- Pours a nice orange/amber color with about a half inch of white head. I'm surprised this has head at 21%.  S- Honestly, it smells kind of like vinegar. Lots of alcohol, but lots of buttery, citrusy hops.  T- Alcohol! Very acidic. Some hops present. Sugar and honey come through when you can get by the initial alcohol bite. Definitely the most unique beer I've ever had. I'm not sure I like it though.  M- Medium bodied. Goes down smooth. Velvety. Carbonated.  D- Tough drink.

10099,9086,wesbrownyeah,4.55,"Dogfish 120 Minute IPA...21+ alcohol content. Bottled date of 01/07/08.  A- Very thick dark orange fluid that shows a mildly active head that falls to excellent heavy lacing that sticks to glass. Supernova look in the light mild orange tint in middle and dark firey outer shell of glass. NICE.  S- The beer is over a foot and a half from my nose and I smell it! Heavy sweet sugar scent with thick overtones of Malts and hops. Very appearent hop oil smell with alcohol esters obvious.  T- Severly complex in flavor that is combined with every flavor in mind. Starts with heavy brown sugar thickness, massive malt body, followed by a alcohol warmth, finishing with a great hop bitterness tart and tang.  M-D- Thick and very alcohol feel and taste. It's my favorite ""can you?"" beer. Can you drink it all like any other? Yes I can! Heavy malts and hops can almost crush any average drinkers palate. I personally can down the whole damn thing in about 15 mins. Hardcore flavor means a need for a hardcore drinker. Like light beers? Dont waste the money on trying a true massive hopped and aged beer like this.  Note: Love Hops? Go for it! Just bought out the last of 08 120's in local store.

S: Apple, wood, and a funky/sour smell - like it has over-fermented and turned sour, probably the smell of the immense amount of alcohol.  T: The alcohol flavor dominates this one. I do get some apple cider and pear flavor. This does not taste like an Imperial IPA, but I will rate it disregarding the style. As the beer warmed up I picked up a hint of orange flavoring.  M: Medium to full bodied, and it doesn't leave much oiliness/ stickiness on the tongue or in the mouth.  D: The funky/ sour flavor gets to me a bit, plus the abv is so high.

Amazing!  appearance: golden amber hues, almost red  smell: disappointed, alchohol covered the hop smell.  taste: decent hops flavor, this beer is loaded with it but again the alcohol content smears it. very sweet...  mouthfeel: medium to slightly full  drinkability: surprisingly smooth. another weird attempt to make beer different.

A closer investigation reveals an apricot scent with a hint of bitter hops. Time to taste... Wow- this thing is crazy! Massive hops up front. It's not that bitter up front but not very bitter. Lots of sweet citrus, no pine at all. Slightly sticky though. This is followed by a huge caramel, syrup malt then a slight bitterness followed by a slightly strange chemical taste. This aftertaste would be my only criticism. I really liked this beer and look forward to another bottle.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,therica,4.02,"Wow I was in the mood for an IPA and all I had was junk in the fridge until I found this bottle given to me a few months ago by my son. Great! I thought.... Well, I'd totally forgotten how powerful this stuff was supposed to be! I already feel over-warm and I was just looking for a nice IPA to cool me down on a 90-degree too-early-summer day in April!  SIP AT YOUR OWN PACE-- OR AT YOUR OWN RISK!  A= nice copper-amber, just-off-white creamy head about 1 finger in a tall glass 1/2L stein, tons of lacing. Profuse tiny dancing bubbles coming up erratically and swirling like a gnat-swarm. Where's Jerry Garcia when you need a good light-show?!?!?  S= very evident, with strong everything-- hops, florals, malts, liquor.  T= a bit overpowering on the first gulp before I realized what I was drinking. Actually a bit nauseatingly sweet. But after readjusting my brain, a fantastic display of hops, a solid foundation of malts and some bready traits, definite liquor evident, high sweetness.  M= sweet, with bold varietal hops, bready malts, occasional hints of a woody hops taste of some sort; lasts for quite some time.  D= one only, for me.

10099,9086,alcstradamus,3.98,"Poured a beautiful glowing amber color with a very small head and no lacing. Smell was dominated by a honey sweetness, taste followed suit and was sweet but surprisingly tame. The alcohol was noticeable but not as overpowering as I would have expected. Mouthfeel was oily and medium/full bodied with limited amounts of carbonation.

S: LOTS going on here with plenty of hops shooting out a grocery market full of citrus and tropical fruits. Solid malt sweetness to back it up.  T: Again, a ton going on here. Not as god as the nose, but quite tasty. Lots of sweetness and candy. It's simply overpowering.  M: Have to let this one sit on the palate for a while, as there's so much going on. Can definitely feel the alcohol, but wouldn't know it was 20% abv just from the feel.  D: Pretty good when it was relatively fresh (currently adding notes from old handwritten review).

Citrus, pine, pine, citrus super hoppy smell. A bit redundant to say I know, I know its a bit redundant to say. Faint alcohol smell on the nose as well.  Massive hops, like a ton of em. Coats your tongue with bitterness, almost like a hop syrup. Wow.  Mouthfeel is overly intense, hops galore, tingling sensation, and a sticky coat of bitterness lingers.

While the flavors are overwhelming, I don't think I would want to taste this beer without them. The alchohol would just take over.  M- Syrupy and sticky. Really coats your whole mouth. Then, ooooh the alcohol burns, but then it gives you the pleasant warming sensation of sipping some liquor.  D- I was sitting at the review page adjusting the ratings as I was drinking. The more I drank the further the drinkability dropped. The next time I buy this I will split one with a friend. It's more economical and 1 would be the absolute maximum for one sitting.

Taste: Very sweet, almost like a peach or melon with a sugary fruit texture. Analogous to a sweet wine? Alcohol definitely showed through though, I couldn't take more than a sip a time. Carbonation was pretty low, but considering I was prepared to sip a liqueur, it was surprised  Drinkability: Way too strong for me, but from my perspective this isn't really a beer.

10099,9086,JordanEllwanger,4.68,"A celebratory review honoring the birth of my newborn son and my own birthday.  A sniff from the bottle reveales a very high alcohol content, reminiscent somewhat to that of superglue or rubber cement with a hint of fruitiness.  A very amber pour into a weizen glass with little to no head. Semi-transparent and lighter that I expected. It takes a good few shakes to pull up the sediment up from the bottom of the bottle. Once pulled then poured, the sediment adds a little head and clouds the glass as can be expected.  The aroma is hugely alcoholic hinted with a sent of an over ripened peeled banana. Almost intoxicating in and of itself.  For such a high alcohol volume I would expect it to taste more like wine, but it powers through as an unusually strong hoppy swell. With the first sip a sharp fruity sweetness tickling to the mouth (carbonated very well); my nasal cavities are instantly permeated with the overwhelming ripened fruity burn. An after taste of carmely browns and hoppy greens mist across my pallet. For such a high alcohol content this is easy to sip yet tough to gulp.  It's effect runs quickly. Very smooth for such a high alcohol percent. I don't think I'll be able to review another tonight after this.  Cheers, Jordan.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Getting TONS of sweet caramel malts, some sherry, raisins, vanilla in there as well. The alcohol is also noticable. Taste very boozy and sweet. It's definitely a complex brew. It taste like there are alot of hops in here but I'm not getting bitterness from them at all. Feels kind of slick and oily in the mouth carbonation is good though.

Poured a copper-orange color, white head that dissipated fairly quickly. Hoppy, fruity aroma. Taste is, well, like nothing I've ever tasted before. I can tell that it's got a good amount of hops, but it has none of the bitterness or astringency I associate with traditional hop-bombs. The fruity-citrusy flavor predominates, with a complex mouthfeel that is smooth, sweet, rich and hoppy all at the same time. The alcohol is incredibly well hidden; if I had not read this beers reviews I would never have guessed the ABV.

10099,9086,jonziefle,3.61,"Note: I may have gotten a bad beer (got a little shaken), which may skew the review slightly. However, at $10 a beer, it may be a while.  Appearance: Poured a cloudt opaque light brown color; looks like apple cider. No head to speak of and no visible carbonation. Some lacing down the glass. Overall, though, pretty dull and lifeless.  Smell: Smells like hops and booze, plain and simple. Very intense nose of grapefruit, citrus, pine, and lemon frangrances. Very sweet and syrupy in the smell. Very interesting, but foreboding at the same time.  Taste: A very big beer, front and center. Strong juicy hop and alcohol bite up front dominate the taste. Syruppy sweet after the bitter bite wears off. The taste is so strong/intense that I can't detect much complexity at all. The amount of alcohol is definitely limiting.  Mouthfeel: Strong bit up front, but a little thick and syrupy feeling. Also, kind of flat. Coats the mouth well, allowing the flavor to linger.  Drinkability: An interesting beer, quite intense. One to try, but quite a different beer than the 60 and 90 minutes. Like some one else stated, the 90 minute is just a more intense 60 minute. However, the 120 minute is a different beer altogther (whether good or bad).

Bananas! Holy crap this tasted like a banana smoothie, but with a hint of citrus hops. The hops were not as apparent as I expected.  Overall this beer is great. In my hazy mind I thought this was just a 10% beer and I thought it hid it well, but now I see it's 21% I'm just shocked at the lack of an alcohol note.

It smells amazing--a sharp alcohol bite (it's a 21 ABV, for crying out loud) but surrounded with sweet citrus and pine and caramel and hops. I smelled it for five minutes before I got down to drinking. Best-smelling 21 ABV I can imagine, in short.  So many hops. A solid mouthfeel, maybe a bit too syrupy. Somebody lower down said a ""hoppy barleywine"" and I think that's just right, since it was much sweeter than I expected, and I had to sip it more than I'd ever have to sip an IPA.

I was overwhelmed. amazed. i couldn't believe my nose this could be conceivable. heck, it's not my favourite array of smells but it is exceptional. i had to smell it twice and thrice and hand it over to my friend and have her smell it too. i spent some 8 minutes just smelling this beer. what's in here?? the smell of pines, kind of syrup, caramel, maybe charred apricots. i can't completely describe this.  And the taste? another 8 minutes just decrypting this. strong, burnt sugar-syrup feel with an as-much-as-possible hidden alcohol but it's just too much. it's not tacky like some other alcohol bombs which are plain revolting sweet, this beer is simply oh-so well balanced, but still so strong, so flavourful but so harmful, i cannot describe this fully.  It is exceptional but i couldn't drink more than one. by the end of the night i was asking the bartender at the BT if this beer was really 21%. of course- before it got to me fully. no way you'll handle more than one and a half.

I decided against it. I shouldn't have. This beer has an initial taste of beautiful hops and a floral undertone, but as soon as it hits the back of your tongue the stark alcohol taste sets in and sets in hard. As I sat on the beer for a little bit, I don't know if it was the beer warming up or myself getting intoxicated from the 21%, but she softened up and smoothed out.

10099,9086,Goblinmunkey7,4.4,"Pours an opaque, deep-orange with a small off-white head. I can smell the floral and citrus aromas with the beer sitting on the desk next to me. The first smell is full of bright-orange aromas coupled with a sharp alcohol bite. A light floral note sneaks through the back, screaming of some crazy-hop infusion. I can tell it's bitter, but the smell isn't really letting that lose. It's more sweet, citrusy, and floral than it is outright bitter hoppy. I know those aromas are in fact derived from the hops, but it's different than I would have expected. The first sip is significantly less intense than I expected. The citrus bite hits right up front, mostly citrus zest, with a larger emphasis placed on orange than lemon. The ABV, all 21.00% of it hits the tongue at the same time as a slightly grassy hop note, burning just a little bit on the tongue before the swallow. A pronounced burning hits the throat, but it's by no means harsh, just a general sense of warm. A mild sweetness cuts under everything, brightening the beer up just a touch. After a few more sips, the citrus flavor becomes a little sweeter, more reminiscent of a real orange than the zest. The alcohol picks up a bit as well, warming and biting harder than it did earlier. After a little warming, this thing picks up some serious power. The hops still don't carry too much of a bitter taste, but they certainly make up for it with the insane amount of floral and citrus notes that come into play. The alcohol hits the same way, strong, intense, and delightful. There's a subtlety here that is lost in other DIPAs, Southern Tier Hoppe comes to mind. Somehow, with almost twice the alcohol, it tastes less like vodka and more like a damn fine beer. Quality all around. I'm looking forward to Black and Tanning this with World Wide Stout. It should be an exercise in ludicrousness. The overall profile is a little unbalanced for my taste, but not enough so to really hurt this thing. It's over-the-top, but deliberately so. Well-done and well-rounded...at least as far as it can be.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

T: There are plenty of citrus hops up front, followed but some malt to sort of balance it out, but alcohol taste is ever so prevalent.  M: Leaves a 'burning' feeling on the palate and back of throat.

10099,9086,alleykatking,4.02,My roommate and I split a bottle of this after I got off one night at work. Bottled July 2008. It was my roommates first extreme beer. I think his cherry exploded after the firstd taste.  A- Poured into a small plastic cup (I know I know but I was at work). Massive and I mean massive head that never really quite left. I notice if you taste the foam it is nothing but hops. Lacing left everywhere that the foam could touch. Medium murky copper brown appearance.  S- Lots of hop smell to this. Almost a sweet alcohol undertone to this. I couldn't help but smell this for about 3 minutes before I even tasted it.  T- Holy shit...this is almost to extreme for someone who hasn't been prepared for it (seeing the look on my roommates face). Hop undertones that almost get put behind a sugary alcohol taste. Very sweet but seemed a lot more mellow than fresher bottles in the past that I've had.  M- Thick....chewy....coats your mouth in a sugary hoppy goodness.  D- Yea I only drink one of these everytime I am in the mood for a 120. More than that and I'm afraid I would upset my stomach with the sugary sweetness. Kind of like drinking Boones Farm to get fucked up. You puke from the sugar intake not because you are drunk.  Dogfish Head never ceases to amaze me. Much like my roommate who after taking a couple sips doesn't want any more. And instead of letting me finish it for him just slammed it instead.

10099,9086,Florida9,3.75,"Wow. What a beer! Can't say I'll ever buy another bottle, but I sure am glad to have had the opportunity to try it.  A: Beautiful deep copper color, polk-a-dotted with a lot of oatmeal-esque yeasty floaty thingys. Hazy. Only about a 1/4 inch of thin head which dissipates very quickly  S: At first I smelt just pine, but as the beer warmed up it opened up a lot as well. Pine, fruit, some muted hops, and honey, though I've got to say, compared to 60 and 90 minute, there is a distinct lack of hops.  T: Intense, syrupy sweetness, with an almost artificial fruitiness, sort of like Juicy Fruit gum. Some floral hops, but these are clearly in the background. The beauty of the beer lies in the finish as the smorgasbord of flavors develops nicely over the period of a minute or so.  M: Very little carbonation with a cloying sweetness.  D: This is a tough one. First of all, at $8 for a 12oz bottle, there is going to be a limit on my drinkability before I even open the bottle. This is a sipping beer. You need some time between each sip to truly appreciate this beer. But, at times, this beer can be overwhelming and intense. And, frankly, I don't see how it can be considered an IPA; sweet with a noticeable lack of hoppiness. Compared with the 60 and 90, this beer is in a class by itself, but its not the logical procession. The 90 minute is a more intense 60 minute, but the 120 is not a more intense 90 minute. Its just a different beer all to its own.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,BeerFMAndy,2.77,"Before I review this, Id like to say how pleased I was with buying it. It was totally worth the try, but really, I think that it would GREATLY benefit from sitting in my basement for a few years.  A - Quickly diminishing head (poured into a 6 oz. glass so to share the bottle). Fresh amber color. Slightly cloudy and syrupy looking due to slow bubbles.  S - Incredibly complex smell. Fruity, hoppy, and a smell of a cleaning solution (from the copious amount of alcohol no doubt).  T - Thick, fruity, sweet yet hoppy. All of this is outshined with in milliseconds by the amount of alcohol. I think that 2, 3, maybe 4 years would smooth this beer out in ways that would really make it much better to me. Very mead like - fruity, honey.  M - Smooth, very thick and rich. Burning from alcohol  D - Incredibly low on the drinkability scale. This guy could be consumed once a year in my opinion. And, each time I'd share it too.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Vonerichs,3.42,"I feel obligated to start with a disclaimer in fairness to the unique beer that this is... I consider myself a fanatic of ipas, especial doubles. 90 and 60 minute are two of my favorites and I enjoy most everything DFH has to offer. With that being said, DO NOT go into this one expecting anything that resembles an IPA in any way, shape, or form. This is so over the top I have a hard time even believing this is a beer. This is definitely not one for the weak or someone who is just getting into IPAs.  It poured an extremely hazy orange color with almost no head whatsoever, except for around the rim.  The smell was quite surprising. Right away it smells like bubble gum and sweet, fruity esters. Very sweet, for that matter. There is a floral hop presence, but nowhere near what I was expecting.  Again, the taste is way over the top, unlike anything I've had before. It's medicinal and reminds me of candy flavored cough syrup you'd have as a kid. It's very sweet and the hop attack I was expecting isn't there and subsequently neither is the bitterness.  It's thick and syrupy. Cough syrup. By the end I felt like my mouth was sprayed with Chloroseptic.  I struggled to get through this beer more than any other I've ever tried. It's not so much the alcohol content, although that contributed, but it's more of the sweetness and syrupy texture.  I'm glad I tried this beer. It's very creative and worth the price to try, but it's doubtful I ever buy it again unless I have a friend that wants to try it for the first time. I actually scored this beer significantly less then went back after thinking about it for a while, mainly because you have to understand going into this that DFH is trying to create something over the top and not for the every day consumer. It's not a bad beer by any means, but it definitely takes an open mind and palate to appreciate it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,nicnut45,4.35,"Appearance: Pours a honey amberlike color. There was almost no head. Just a nice rim around the glass and some faint whispy head in the middle.  Smell: Upon first opening there is a strong floral aroma almost like being in a greenhouse. After that it fades away and you have a sweet Elmers glue paste, scotch tape, kind of smell. Im not saying these are disagreeable. Matter of fact, I kind of like it and I think we all remember some kids eating elmers paste in grade school.  Taste: It tastes sweeter then I thought it would. A mixture of cotton candy and orange. And at 21% its not suprising. Not the hop bomb I was expecting. To me it is more like a hoppy barleywine.  Mouthfeel: I like it, carbonation is just right.  Drinkability: The high alcohol content is definetly subdued and it is easy to drink. It has a certain sweetness that keeps you coming back for more. I would like to have more of these but at the price? I would much rather have a Trappist 8 for cheaper.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,paulxqx,3.78,"Before I get into the specifics, let it be known, this is a very special beer. Very different then anything I have tried. If you have the opportunity I would definitely give this a try! Now onto the specifics...  A: Poured from bottle into pint glass. Color a medium yellow/red/orange. Not as dark as I would have expected for a 120 minute brew. The head was fine, white, and did not last long. The appearance of the liquid seemed to coat the glass like a thin watery syrup.  S: Smells like a sweet alcoholy syrup. For how much hops are used in this brew the smell does not come through as much as I would have expected. Hop smell is there, but you kinda have to search for it. The dominant smell is sweet alcohol. Maple, alcohol, essence of fruit, sweet, strong, and overwhelming.  T: Very well balanced for how much alcohol is in this beer. A warm lasting finish. Again, there is not nearly as much hops as you would expect, alcohol and malt have more of a presence here. Slight citrus fruity taste, but quickly dissipates.  M: Tastes like the 120 minute boil really concentrated the flavor down - thick, full, syrupy. Fine and slight carbonation. The after taste magnifies these qualities.  D: Great beer to try, not something I would like to drink once a night, or even once a month. It is something that I am glad I tried once though. I raise my glass to DFH for the effort put into creating this fine beer, however, I wouldn't mind if it was a while before I had this again.  Overall... Something definitely worth trying, or tasting, but not something I will long for tomorrow.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,alpinebryant,3.94,"Poured a hazy medium ale color 60L?. Some head, but nothing exceptional. I would imagine if you were hopping it every day for a month, you would be losing carbonation in the process and would need to add more CO2 at the end.  Smelled very fruity, candylike aroma / bubbilcious / Cotton Candy  Tasted extremely sweet, almost like a fruit punch flavored wine. So sweet that you need to sip it and I immediately wanted to pour it into a wine glass and have a friend try it while they were over. Naturally, it wasnt their type of beer : ) After being hopped for a full month, the hops have to decompose partially, which lends to a little bit of a sour funky taste in addition to the sweet hops.  Drinkability: I would probably want to drink this on special occasions, but fear what it would do to my head if I drank a 6 pack of these... Very good, but not a session beer. Definitely a sipper",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Vancer,3.6,"""Let it age for a decade"" says the label - fork that! I might not be alive then!  Pours a hazy amber with a quite a bit of ivory head for such a heavy hitter. Oily sheet ringing the Corsendonk tulip.  Sweet juicy fruit gum and citrus in the aroma, and the quaff? Lord, just like many have said, a real sweet drink of pine and bubblegum. No hint of any high octane booze, but a sharp and tangy spruce finish gives it away. And an odd sour funk makes this one a strange bird indeed.  Welp, good for a try and I'm enjoying it, but I can't really see getting any more at the high dollar 12oz bottle price.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Poured from a bottle purchased recently @ The Liquor Stop in Highland, IL.  Colored a burnt orange/red, not the color I expected after drinking both the 60 and 90. Hey, it's different, gotta like that.  The smell was amazing...I really enjoyed the nose...good stuff. Def a sipper, not something one could gulp down unless they really really wanted to.  Taste? Well, HOPS & ALCOHOL but with a twist...gotta try it to know what I'm talking about.

That's where the similarities stopped  S- Incredible smell: Blood orange, booze, hops on performance enhancing drugs and a faint mango in there  T- Sweet booze, like a orange hop liqueur or Triple Sec. Still was tasting it the next day  M- Syrupy and powerful  D- I believe I would like it more with some age, will get more and try that.

10099,9086,Stimack,1.99,"Let me start by saying that I am not a hophead, though I do like a number of DIPA's. I was able to give this brew a try last night as it was on tap at Mahars. I also got this brew with the idea that it would be slightly more intense version of the 90. I did not realize the magnitude of the difference...  This brew poured to a cloudy and murky yellow to bronze color with a slight head that had no real retention. The aroma, wow ... lots of hops, very sweet, caramel. Not to bad of a smelling brew. Well now for the taste, good god, alcohol is the first thing that comes to mind and then it breaks to hop resin and such a sweet flavor that after a while it is very difficult to get down. At first I just thought it was an odd ball but after a while this one was just grossly over the top for me. I did finish it, was not going to let a $7 draft go down the drain, but it was one of if not the most difficult beers for me to finish. Clearly this was a one time endeavor for me.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,amneziak,3.26,"Appearance: Considering how dark the DFH 90 Minute IPA poured, I expected the 120 Minute to be even darker. My assumption was wrong. It pours a very nice dark yellow color with only the faintest amount of pale white head. Because of the insane viscosity alone in this beer, there is quite a bit of lacing and sheer heaviness that coats the side of the glass.  Smell: Two of my good friends joined me to drink this one - and for good reason. As we held the glass up to our nose for the first time we all laughed out loud. This is an INSANE ""beer."" I mean, wow! The first thing that came to our mind was model glue or sticking your nose in a bag full of freshly-purchased pungent hops. This is unquestionably the most intense smelling beer you're going to find. I imagine it's the most intense beer you're going to find...period!  Taste: The laughs continued because holy hell this is a monstrous beer. Taking my first sip was like taking my first leap off the high dive at the pool - I was hesitant to say the least. There's no question what hits your mouth first - HOPS, HOPS, HOPS, HOPS, and more HOPS! And when I say hops, I mean the most intense essence of hops you can find. If you could somehow liquefy strong hops into a gold liquid (oh wait, it's been done).  Mouthfeel: The DFH 120 has about the same consistency as Sauternes. If you can imagine how a hop liqueur would feel on the tongue, then you're about halfway there. There is a lot of body and sweetness that coats the mouth and tongue and holds on like there's no tomorrow. Makes you wonder why it's not called a Quadruple IPA. Maybe one day...  Overall: We had a lot of fun drinking this beer and enjoyed the insane bitch slap we got from the hops. However, this is a beer that should not be taken seriously. What I mean by this is that there is no way anyone should want to drink this on a regular basis. It is extreme beyond belief. I will definitely search for another one to keep as a conversation piece the next time I get together with other hop lovers, but in no way see it as one of the better IPAs out there.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

10099,9086,ZimZamZoom,2.68,"I had this on tap at the Dogfish Head Alehouse, Gaithersburg, MD.  The snifter came out almost full to the top with beer, no head visible on top of the hazy bronze colored beer, with few signs of carbonation evident.  There is a bit of a piney hop aroma to this, but it's mostly big sweet caramel malt. And I mean big and sweet. Alcohol is noticeable in the aroma as well...big surprise here. I'm not finding a lot of complexity in the aroma. Hops well subdued which actually is a surprise. Taste...God-awful sweet. Holy crap, I can taste some alcohol and even a touch of those piney hops, but there is no balance here at all. I've never puckered from sweetness before, but I'm sure there's never been anything this sweet in my mouth before. Sweetness turns to an alcohol sweetness which quickly turns sweet and stays that way through the finish. I guarantee there's a lot of hops in this beer, I just wish I could taste them. Maybe a touch of hop bite in the very end, but no real hop flavor. Sipped this all dinner long.  Yes has big body, and is not drinkable in the least.

S- the nose consists mainly of alcohol and a little bit of pear. theres a faint odor of hops, but nothing like id expect the ""hop lovers holy grail"" or however the bottle puts it.  T- man, this burns. solvent like alcohol and pears. a slight bit of hops, but nothing like i was expecting.  M- thick and syrupy. it leaves thick sediment in the glass, thats a first from an IIPA. the warming from the massive ABV is intense.  D- amazingly enough, this wasnt as hard to finish as i thought. i certainly wouldnt attempt another one right now, or anytime soon, but for 21% its alot easier to finish that i would have thought. i feel the hoppiness of this one to be embellished, and im not sure why everyone loves it like they do. it seems more of a novelty to me than anything else.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

I think there was citrus on the nose, and some big malt backbone to take her on home. And then my ex said I hit Montell with a keyboard on the way out, but I don't think she's trustworthy....after all, she kicked me out right before Oktoberfest and what sort of person does that to a guy she says she ""loves""?

It's a different way of looking at dining, eating for the CHALLENGE as opposed to eating for enjoyment.  It's similar with DfH 120: You don't really enjoy this $10 concoction that has the same alcohol content of five Budweisers; you conquor it. In my case, you conquor it with the help of a friend.  Pouring it out I am slammed with the smell of pine and hops. Alcohol smells, barely noticable in more pedestrian beers, overwhelm the rest of the smell.  Head is minimal to moderate, but I think that may of been the way I poured it. Banding, on the other hand was the heaviest I have ever seen in a beer.  The taste was quite carmel sweet, a lot sweeter than what I thought it would be. THe hops were extreme and mainly pine-y hops, but it was considerably less bitter than most barleywines I have had. I think the heavy, sweet body compensated for it.  I have to talk about the alcohol in a seperate note: It's heavy. You notice it in the smell, at the front, middle and back of the tongue, in the top of your throat to the stomach. It turns this beer from a ""drinking"" beverage to a ""sipping"" drink. The hops are so extreme as well that this combines to a beer that you can only take a few sips every two or three minutes at a time. In short, the drinkability of this beer is nonexistant.

This beer is an amber delight with a little bit of head, surprising for the abv.  Smells of sweet sweet hops and alcohol, not so much hot as vinous. This is going to be a recurring theme in the beer, this beer drinks much like a wine (only better of course).  The hops give a wonderful essence to the palate of this lupuliquor. They come in droves, lines, lines, lines deep, but leave no bitter trace as the warming malty alcohol washes them away. The alcohol is amazingly well hidden in this uberbrew. I am shocked with every passing sip.  The mouthfeel is interesting, little to no hop bitterness, a sweet tang, slightly off kilter but the carbonation works wonders.  I could drink a bottle of this without much problems, pretty good drinkings for such a big brew. I love DFH",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

S: Judging by the nose, this is a very BIG beer. Very sweet malty aroma that moves into a hoppy pine smell finishing with alcohol in the background.  T: Hits my tongue with a sweet honey flavor right off the bat. Next comes a citrus & maltiness in the middle, followed by a huge hop spice always present in the background. It finishes with the warming taste of alcohol.  M: One of the most interesting mouthfeels I've experienced in a while. A very big oily mouthfeel very thick & heavy, yet smooth. Reminds me of drinking 2% milk...then the carbonation kicks in to remind you this is a beer.  D: Definitely a BIG beer! Would have to say it's not a very drinkable brew, but who would expect anything else but a nice sipper at 21% ABV!

The head shows decent retention for such a high ABV brew, but it stayed at a fine little cap for almost the whole time I was sipping on this one (about an hour). Lots of really nice foamy lace sticks to the glass.  S - This smells like an overly ripe caramel apple. You know the almost-rotten but still smells good tingle you get when you smell a VERY ripe apple? This reminds me of that smell that I remember from growing up with two apple trees in the backyard. Bees buzzed around those apples on the ground and tortured us kids who were forced to push mow beneath the trees. The caramel aspect is big here too. This smells like those little caramel squares that pull out your fillings. The ones that you melt to make caramel apples. Vanilla bean, Oh, and booze... applejack (apple brandy) comes to mind. This is quite a heady brew!  T - This is immediately shocking to the palate. It's extremely aggressive and tart with loads of what tastes, too me, like rotten apples. This isn't what I normally think of as ""hoppy"" per se (although it is hoppy and I know that there about a friggin' metric tone of hops used per bottle), but rather sour and complex like a Flander's red or something.  M - Full bodied and boozy as hell. This one never seems as heavy as it is due to the extreme alcohol feel and the tart/sour acidity. I started to catch a buzz after about three tiny sips... this stuff is more like liquor than beer, and should be treated as such. I wouldn't drink 12oz of Jager (about the same ABV) in one sitting, so I'll be enjoying this one ery slowly.  D - This is not what I expected. That's not to say that I didn't like it, it's just weird... and although almost all of my top rated brews are high ABV, anything much over 12% is just a little ridiculous and begins to detract from the flavor. I ride a Yamaha Vino 125 scooter, and what makes a scooter a scooter is it's small size, low cost, and small but peppy engine. Some of those big Suzuki Burgman and Honda Silverwing scooters are 650ccs and cost close to 10 grand... then, what's the point? Why not just buy a motorcycle? If you want to pay upwards of $10 for 12 oz of something boozy, why not just pick up a good single malt or a good upscale bourbon? I understand that this is not distilled, but there comes a point when beer really isn't beer any more.

It pours a beautiful golden red color, very slightly cloudy, and I swear that it's glowing from within. Very little head, very little carbonation.  Smells sweet -- honey, clover, honeysuckle, and alcohol. Hard to detect hops through the alcohol smell, but it's there.  The taste is complex. I'm not terribly good at picking things apart and identifying components, but here goes: I get a little orangey/lemony citrus at the front end followed by a burst of sweetness with maybe a little oakiness. As it sits in the mouth, the hops come out, and then the alcohol burn overpowers it all. The aftertaste of the film left in the mouth is hops with a caramel character. Overall, I think the incredible strength is a drawback -- the alcohol is too astringent. As it warms up, the alcohol comes out even more.  It's thick and syrupy and filmy. It clings for a long time.  The beer is to big and powerful to be very drinkable. I've been working on this one for about half an hour, and I'm probably not quite halfway through it (this is definitely a sipper).  I would be interested to try this beer after aging it for a few years -- I wonder if the sweetness would mellow out?  --- 2012-04-01  Again in a 12oz bottle (not aged -- I have another one aging). Doesn't look so ruby red as I remember or as I reviewed. Looks flatter. Cloudy orange instead.  Still totally overpowered by the alcohol.

Unlike any nose to any other brew. Taste is the same but magnified times 100. It is ridiculously hopped and has a very heavy aftertaste of syrup. Again nothing like I've ever had. My tastebuds are still watering after the first sip. For such a high ABV the alcohol seems to be well hidden therefore making it very drinkable. As most have already said this smells exactly like the 60 minute and 90 minute IPA just highly concentrated.  As I looked into my bottle I seen a bunch of sediment's at the bottom. So I poured some back into the bottle and shook up the rest to collect some of that sediment. When I poured it back into the snifter it looked like a lava lamp and just stayed frozen in the glass.

I should probably note that I really enjoy DFH's high-alcohol brews, so this could be slightly biased.  Aroma - Hello malts and alcohol, how are you? In DFH's defense, it's reallly hard to make a high-alcohol beer without it reeking of alcohol and malts. Although it still smells overwhelmingly strong, it's not terrifying and, in a weird way, almost inviting  Appearance - Oh, this is probably my favorite part of the beer. It's so warm and amber looking that it's positively inviting. It's also slightly cloudy if you manage to get all the good stuff lurking at the bottom of the bottle out.  Taste - Again, Hello malts and alcohol, how are you? I may be the only one who feels this way, but DFH's high-alcohol brews taste VERY similar. The alcohol warmth is there, along with the sugary malts, and there is usually always a hint of raisin involved. I actually forgot this was an IPA because it was so malty.

A - Absolutely opaque orangey amber. I dipped a spoon handle into it, and to my surprise it was totally obscured in less than an inch of beer.

In a totally unrelated note, is beer supposed to have ""legs""?  S - As I raise a trembling glass to my nose, I struggle to reign in everything that's going on in my olfactory center of my brain. Good Lord! this is a busy beer. I am tempted to just put ""Everything"" as my description. It literally smells like every beer I have ever consumed, just concentrated. (except for steel reserve triple export, leave that one out) Here we go. Floral, citrus, pine, honey, smoke, grassy herbs, anise, bacon, toasted rye bread, toasted other things, toasted malt, sage, caves, tree bark, loam. Everything.  T - The moment of truth. (Preface) Oh God, am I ready for this? This will be the single strongest beer I have ever Consumed. Here we go...  ....KaPOW. Never in my life would I have dreamed that a beer could taste like this. Holy hell. There is so much going on in my mouth, it's like the mind of a schizophrenic on bathtub meth. Let me see if I can get a handle on this.  Sugary malts dominate. I was looking for a little more bitterness here, but it just gets plowed out of the way by the malty sweetness. Seriously. If the malt in DFH 120 min. was a mechanical device it would be painted yellow, huge, and have CAT printed on the side. Oh, and don't forget that it's 21%. This sucker is gonna slay me tonight. I've had exactly three sips, and I can already feel it. There are infinite flavors here. The initial opening isn't so bold, but the swallow/finish is a blasting cap. An explosion of flavor rocks the back of the palate. Oranges, every imaginable fruit, some herbal notes, and surprisingly little alcohol. The hops are a caged beast, imprisoned behind carbohydrate bars of syrupy impenetrability. The jury is out as to whether or not I like this beer yet... Toasted notes are coming in now, as are some coffee elements. This beer is the Cayman Trench of beer. Deep. Waaaay deep. Good God, I can TASTE the SMELL of this beer.  Wait a minute. THERE'S the alcohol. Warmth. Wow. ...I'm reduced to sentence fragments.  Ok. It's growing on me. the longer it's out of the bottle, the more it mellows and balances out. the hops come out a bit more, and keep things together. This is an incredible beer. I don't know if i'll go out of my way to keep them stocked, but this is incredible.  M - Smooth and thick. Thick thick thick. Syrup. molasses. Motor oil. Slick alcohol feel. wonderful. light carbonation.  D - I am going to have to say ""5"" here, knowing that traditional criterion of drinkablity cannot apply. If you drink this out of a snifter, the same way one might drink an overproof bourbon, the drinkability is spectacular. It would be ridiculous to try and compare this beer to other beers with regards to ""standard"" drinkability assessments. Beyond ""apples and oranges."" This is like comparing apples to Dark chocolate dipped strawberries served from the nude body of your supermodel lover.  This is the single longest review I have ever written. It's fitting. This is the single most intense beer I have ever experienced.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

This really isn't much like other DIPAs in that it is overwhelmingly sweet. It has a strong cider-ish vinegar smell. There is definitely a strong hop presence, but the overall flavor of the beer is just trying to pack as much of punch as possible. It is extremely strong, but I found myself having no trouble drinking it.  It is definitely a unique beer that doesn't align itself very much with other DIPAs. And it is delicious.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,unclejimbay,2.56,"120 Minute IPA Dogfish Head Craft Brewery Style: American Double / Imperial IPA ABV: 21.00 % bottle&gt;tulip glass  Overall I was unimpressed by this beer given all the hype that surrounds it. I had cellared a ""special"" bottle for a special occasion. So I decided to open it for a buddy's bday as a pseudo gift gesture. He appreciatte's good beer, so I was excited to share this brew (considering it was $9 for a 12 oz bottle.) I did not enjoy it a bit. My buddy finished it for me. I appreciatte it for it's extreme ABV as an experience. The appearance and mouthfeel were intersteing that's about it. I wouldn't drink it again. I dig DFH and their extreme brewing ideas, but this one is over rated for me, and missed the mark. I would much rather drink 2 90 min IPA any day over the 120!  DFH 120 as a DIPA? Far from it IMHO, clearly not enough hops for a true DIPA. Classify this brew as a barleywine and I may have a different review.  A 4.0 - caramel orange in color, small head gone quick, satisfactory lacing S 3.0 - sweet liquor almost port or brandy like citrus smell. Strong ABV in aroma.... T 2.0 - Strong alcohol taste, overly sweet and cloying, too extreme sweetness and alcohol overpowers the malt & hops MF 4.0 - interesting moutfeel, warming from the alcohol, very low carbo, sweet slickness D 2.0 - un-do-able, wouldn't do it again - I would grab a 90 min IPA instead! Too boozy and sweet.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,StarlightSeraph,3.01,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle (bottled 11-5-08) into my Chimay goblet.  Appearance: Pours a surprisingly clear, dark golden-brown, with one finger of white head. The head dissipated fairly quickly, but left a nice blanket of lacing.  Smell: Alcohol. And lots of it. There's no hiding the 21% ABV in this one. Smells like a mix of vodka and rubbing alcohol, with a hint of piney hops in the background. Some grassy notes intermixed with the alcohol. I can't say I'm surprised, but man, this smells strong.  Taste: Very sweet - honey and syrup notes off the bat, with an alcohol burn behind it. Surprisingly, and disappointingly, the hops don't come through as much as I would expect. Tastes every bit of the 21% ABV, however, so I'm sure that hides some of the hop notes. This could easily be confused for a barleywine. The taste becomes almost cloying after awhile...it is VERY sweet. A sweet/tangy note on the aftertaste (cherries and currants, maybe). Becomes almost sickeningly sweet as it warms.  Mouthfeel: Good thickness, and nicely carbonated. Not really much to complain about here.  Drinkability: Well, for the ABV, you're obviously not having more than one. That being said, it's interested, and I'm glad I tried it, but I can't say I'd seek it out again. It's more like a barleywine than an IIPA, and the main reason I'd spend the money on a bottle would be to age it, and see how it turns out. There was very little of a hop presence, and like I said, it becomes almost unbearably sweet after awhile. It was difficult to finish this one - and not because of the alcohol, but because of the overwhelming sweetness. Still, I'm glad I tried it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Douglas14,3.83,"It pours a deep, deep amber color...maybe burnt orange mixed with a touch of brown. There isn't much if a head and I don't expect one because of the high alcohol. The smell is syrupy and not at all of hops and so is the taste. I like it for some reason even though I know no shouldn't. It's almost more of a barleywine...not really but it's thick enough and malty enough to be one. There is a definite alcohol hottness to it and you feel the deep alcohol burn down in your stomach long after you've taken a sip. It's not crisp at all, which is what I look for in a highly hopped beer. Anyway, as I said, for some weird reason I like it...maybe it's just for novelty reasons. I wouldn't consider it one of my go-to beers!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,TheSkunk,2.63,"Where to even begin with this?  I will preface by stating that this beer is unlike any other beer I have ever tasted. In all honestly, this tastes much closer to a barleywine than an IPA. Being a huge fan of IPAs, I was very excited to try this. However, I ended up with something completely different than what I was expecting.  Appearance: Pours a very attractive, thick, cloudy orange/amber color. Head is very minimal and dissipates into a thin ring around the glass very quickly. No lacing to speak of.  Smell: The first thing you will notice about this brew is the intense alcohol aroma. You can smell the booze in this one, which is not surprising since it weighs in at a hefty 20-21% ABV. There is also an aggressive attack of sweet malt, apricot, and an undertone of orange. While the alcohol is definitely present, it is offset nicely by the sweet fruit scents.  Taste: Wow. What exactly am I drinking? This beer is labeled as an IPA but this is nowhere close to any IPA I have ever had, and I've had quite a few. Though bitter up front on the tongue, the 120 goes down extremely sweet, with a biting alcohol warmth on the back of your tongue and throat. I am not a fan of overly sweet beers, and this ""IPA"" is almost cloying in that regard. As stated before, to me this seems much closer to the barleywine family than the IPA.  Mouthfeel: Thick, chewy. Pleasant enough.  Drinkability: I had trouble finishing my one bottle. Not because it is overly alcoholic, but because the intensely sweet apricot-like flavor becomes more and more cloying as you sip. I went into this expected an extreme IPA, and, well... I'm not exactly sure what I got.  I'm glad that I tried this beer, but I don't think I'll be picking it up again, especially since it's so expensive.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,steelerguy,3.89,"A - Poured thick with a 1 finger head that faded to just cover the top. A nice amber color but is very cloudy. Light carbonation.  S - Great malty smell with a strong hop presence. You can tell this is an extremely big beer simply from the smell, got me very excited to actually taste it.  T - First thing I notice is a slight alcohol tingle, then the malt hits first...wow, was expecting to really get hit by hop bitterness. Then the sweet and I mean pineapple juice sweet hit me. The hop presence is strong but overwhelmed by the sugar still left in there. Nice warmth on the way down, but I can not believe how sweet it was!  M - Different but nice mouthfeel. Could tell how viscous it was when I poured it so I expected a heavy mouthfeel and that is what I got. Not bad by any means, but not like any beer I have had previously, more like milk then beer.  D - This is difficult...I bought a single bottle and no way could I drink more in a sitting. I think this is very drinkable if served in a 2 or 4 oz. serving. 12 oz. just seem like too much, this is more of a dessert wine than beer.  Overall, this is really hard for me to review. I was expecting something different than what I got. I would not consider this beer an IPA at all, it is a barelywine. I also think, at least my sample, was under-attenuated. I don't mind a little residual sweetness in my beer, but this was very sweet. I suppose it could be argued that the sweetness helps balance the hoppiness, but I felt it was the prominent feature of this beer. (I measured the gravity at about 1.030)  If I have this again, which I won't if I am buying, I would like about 4 oz. of it with dessert. I'd take the 90 minute IPA over this if offered a bottle.  Lastly, this is NOT a bad beer. I just don't think it is and IPA as advertised. This would get knocked if being judged and essentially I am judging it. If they called it a barelywine and I expected a barleywine like beer I may have enjoyed it more.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,thespaceman,3.92,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip.  Apppearance: This one poured a cloudy, dark amber color, lots of unfiltered particles and some yeast can be seen from the bottle, very little head on this, lacing and retention were decent.  Smell: Very piney aroma, a sweet grapefruit tinge is relavent, but a sharp twist of esters and alcohol lets your nostrils know this isn't your typical DIPA. This one gave off a bit of a musty hop oil smell too. Alot going on here.  Taste: The hops are obviously there, a oily citrus body is accompanied by a nice maltiness, very rich and syurpy, followed by a huge backround of hop spice and some alcohol. After letting it sit in the glass and warm a bit, the alcohol becomes more prevalent. You could probably fool a non BA by telling them this is some hard alcohol, very robust and extreme to say the least.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, the overdose of hops makes this one bold while sitting on the tongue. The huge dose of esters through the mouthfeel makes this one sharp to the feel, yet the malt makes the crisp body almost velvety smooth.  Drinkability: Is this a highly drinkable brew? Not by any means, this is a beer to be consumed solely by itself, anything after this is really just a regular beer. For what it is worth, I felt that this beer lays down the groundwork of what brewers can actually do to make a beer so extreme and out of the box.

10099,9086,ksullnh,4.25,"Tasted 2/4/09 in an oversized wine glass.  Poured a translucent orangey-yellow with a thin oily looking head. Doesn't look like there's much carbonation.  Wafted this one towards the nose after a friend almost choked after sticking his nose in the glass. Some alcohol and oranges stand out at the front, creating a somewhat perfumey sweet smell. There's also a sort of grape-y booziness smell, almost like vermouth. Quite nice overall; don't breathe too deeply though.  Tastes of oranges, grapes, and booze, in a good way. Prickly heat on the tongue and a nice balance of sweet and dry. There's a medicinal botanical taste that reminds me of gin with juniper and pine notes. Sweet and nicely balanced, not cloying or oily. Very warm on the tongue but without any burn.  A pretty over the top beer, and definitely worth trying.

Have not had another beer like it.  Had this at the brewery after a brewery tour-the keg was 2 days old-needless to say it was very fresh.

It was a real nice pretty pour, with a nice almost orange juice crossed with muddy water appearance. Unfortunately, there was no head to speak of. The aroma was a mix of floral hops and citrus, but they were so overpowered by the alcohol smell that they might as well have not been there. The taste was what I would imagine a beer schnapps to be like, overt alcohol presence dimmed just slightly by lemon and hops. But if I had to place it in a realm of known tastes I would say it was like drinking a glass of gin with a touch of sugar and a drop or two of liquid hop extract. I guess what I am trying to say is that this one needs time to mellow out and finish its fermentation.

Incredibly boozy--I've never actually had a beer that burned my nose upon sniffing. Very loosely reminiscent of a brandy. It's all sweet malt and alcohol upon tasting.

T - the first thing I taste is a distinct sweetness on the tip of my tongue, this spreads back and envelopes the whole of my mouth. it is sweet yet tart, like candied rind. the finish presents a huge explosion of hoppy bitters in the mouth and some dry alcohol burning down my throat. the aftertaste is initially sweet, like a sugary sweet, but fades to hops and then alcohol. this isnt a very complicated beer, nor does it really get the chance to; it just kind of gets in your face and goes ""hops and boooze!!!!"" then it tones down when you finish the bottle. not bad, but with the price tag of about $8.5, not something I would want to buy again.  MF - the feel is quite thick and the carbonation is not terribly noticeable. this makes for something one really has to sip, no gulps here. the thickness is a bit unappealing for how much alcohol is in the brew, makes it a bit like a hop-a-hol slushie.

M- Impressive that this one is 21%, how is there no burn? I've tasted red wines and liquors w/ less alcohol and more burn. The feat of hiding that is quite impressive. The carbonation level is perfect- low, present but barely.  D- After I poured this one into my snifter I added a few ounces of water to the bottle, swirled out the sediment, and drank that down- could've been a normal pale ale. This I think demonstrates the raw power of 120. But really while drinking it I didn't notice the power, not the alcohol, but the delicious caramel and orange flavors. I could very much enjoy this beer as a nightcap, if I was a richer man that is. But for this special occasion of my 200th review, and 2nd year BA anniversary, this beer is a delicious tribute indeed.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,BeerImmediately,2.84,"12 oz bottle served around fiddy degrees.  Deep orange, mostly opaque, with 2F head dropping to film, and leaving a bit o' lacing.  Holy crap that's a strong aroma. Smelled of Pine Sol and old latex paint, and frankly scared me...  Taste was a little more manageable - but still like drinking a toxic chemical. There was some grapefruit rhind, and a deeply bitter barley sweetness. One of the few beers I've ever had that required me to eat something with it - not to enjoy the flavor, but to simply to finish this one-of-a-kind beer.  Rich, slightly cloying mouthfeel. Ok carbonation, and lingering after-film.  Drinkability Analogy: ""How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time.""  Look, I love DF Head, hops, IPAs, and even DIPAs, but I'm not sure WHAT this was... other than truly UNIQUE.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,jpiper,3.97,"It pours a cloudy orange-yellow with a small off-white head.  The smell is dominated by pine and lemon. Medicinal. There's plenty of strange maltiness which is a bit tough to pinpoint: orange syrup?  Again, pine and orange on the palate. Very sweet, rich, and hardly bitter at all - at least for a 120 minute. Very different than any other beer I've had. The alcohol is exceptionally well hidden.  The feel is smooth and mouth-coating, and a bit cloying. The carbonation is nice - light and effervescent which this beer need.  This is dramatically more drinkable than expected. But, to be real, it is a 100% sipper, with consequences when under pressure to drink too fast. I was in a bit of a rush to make my dinner reservations, and this beer is tough to drink at anything faster than a slow sip.  The exception already noted, this beer gets better and better further through the bottle. I get the impression on both the nose and palate that the hops used are a little scattered and unfocused. It creates an experience which is a bit all over the place and extremely unclean. I like my hoppy beers to be clean (thus my preference for West Coast IPAs). This beer is well balanced, even fresh; and it is easy to see how this beer would change with cellar time. I'd like to try that at some point, and I do wish this were more available for me.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,johnd513,4.22,"This beer pours a dark orange with a nice frothy white head that quickly disappears. Smells like a huge IPA with pine and a hoppy sweetness. Tastes incredibly strong with alcohol at the begining, middle and end with classic Piny, grapefruity tastes throughout. The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy. Drinkability is decent considering the outrageous abv. I split this one and probably could of drank the bottle if I really took my time. Overall I am really glad I tried this.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,tmoneyba,4.32,Poured a copper color with large frothy off-white head that lasted with excellent lacing. Heavy complex citrus hoppy aroma with a sweet tone. Full body with a slick texture.

10099,9086,Bagman007,1.98,"Served in a bottle poured into a pint glass.  A- Dark brown, reddish appearance with about a finger width's of head.  S- VERY hoppy. Extreme would be a good word to describe the scent. Nothing but hops.  T- Alcohol and extreme hops. By far the most hoppy beer I have ever had. Definitely overly hoppy. Weird after taste.  M- Bitter and dry, though it's hard to tell because you can't really get much in your mouth because it is so hoppy.  D- It's hard enough to finish one.  Overall this takes hops to a new extreme. Definitely something unique that everyone should try once.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Wisconsin,3.38,"I shared this brew with a friend, what a treat.  A - Pours a two finger head that is nice, white and fluffy. The body is a dark orange almost brown body that is much darker and hazier than most IPA's.  S - Pretty strong IPA smell, with the standard pine, hoppy smell with a nice sweetness. This isn't the best IPA I have smelled but it is solid. The smell of alcohol is also slightly present in this beer.  T - WOW. What an intense drink. This beer has 21% abv and you can tell the minute it hits your tongue. In an attempt to mask the alcohol there is an uncharacteristically odd sweetness that this beer has that is not in IPAs. The hops and citrus that are present in any IPA are here too but it doesn't do it for me. The sweetness is strange for an IPA, however I can applaud there attempt to mask the alcohol as it is pretty impressive despite not following a traditional IPA.  M - The usual IPA components stand out early with the hops and citrus flavor releasing into your mouth first. It then transitions to a sugary, sweet finish that leaves an odd taste of alcohol and sugary sweetness in your throat.  D - Low and not because of the alcohol content. While the alcohol content is strong, my biggest point in contention is the sugar and sweetness this beer has.  I would have liked to see more hops added instead of this sugar/sweetness combination to mask the alcohol. Still impressive feat but for about $8 a bottle this isn't worth it to me. Still fun to try once.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

10099,9086,Gehrig,4.5,"Slightly hazy cider orange body with a thin layer of off-white head despite a fairly aggressive pour; decent lacing. Fine aromas--some hops but certainly not overbearing for a DIPA, or a strong IPA for that matter. The smell is also malty, vinous, and like rum liqueur.  Good taste, lots of fruit especially grapefruit, orange, and pineapple. It's really delicious but boozy, with occasional flashes of hot alcohol. But it's also on the whole quite smooth and viscous. Very delicious, but not a quaffer. The 21% alcohol is for real and one must be wary. Thankfully, 120 easily maintains its flavor when sipped periodically and set down for a breather, which I'd recommend.  Terrific beer, a DIPA liqueur really, and one I enjoyed more than I thought I would. Very unique and, though expensive, well worth enjoying one and cellaring a couple, if one can afford it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,DigitalHype,3.73,"Bottle date 11/06/08  Poured into Mug (sorry)  Light amber color with very little head. It quickly dissipated to almost nil. Small amount of lacing.  Smell of crushed wildflowers and thyme.  Very heavy, and a bit chewy. Certainly hangs around for awhile on the tongue.  Flavors of honey, lemon and cardamon. Moderate to heavy sweetness, with the alcohol coming in heavy toward the end.  A tad too sweet for my taste buds. Still a happy experience. I stop at one. But, will definitely have it again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,spointon,3.9,"I had this from a bottle, poured into a straight sided half-pint glass.  A= This ale poured a slightly hazy orange-gold-copper color with a 1/4"" thin white head. The head only lasted a short while, dropped to a skim, and left just a few spots of lace.  S= The most dominant smell was of course a huge solventy alcohol. My trick is to blow softly across the glass to clear this away, and then take a good sniff. In that instance, I found an aroma profile dominated by super sweet malts, tropical fruit, and some piney hops.  T= Very sweet malt character up front lead into a middle filled with tropical fruit (mango, grapefruit, melon) and citrusy hops. Finish was all hot alcohol with a slight aftertaste of hops. Overall taste: The alcohol is once again the 800lb gorilla here, but the flavors do at least mesh well with that peppery alcohol hammer.  MF= Heavier bodied with a syrupy and slick mouthfeel. Moderate carbonation level does keep this from being too syrupy.  D= A very interesting beer here. Not something I will want to drink too often or in very high quantities (thus reducing its drinkability). It is a well crafted beer however and one that everyone should try from time to time and certainly a great candidate for aging a year (or three).",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,KBoudreau66,4.2,"This is the super strong IPA that has the strong smell of alcohol. I mean how can it not with a 20% abv? It is an excellent looking brew that pours a mid amber color with an off white head that melts quickly. Probably from the strong amount of alcohol. Smells of piney, flowery hops, citrus, sweet honey, and alcohol. Tastes sweet and syrupy with hops and washes down with a lot of booze. I would be a big liar if I said this was drinkable. Imagine drinking this everyday? and at $8.50 for a 12 oz. It's irrational to pay that much when for 54 cents more I could get a whole 6-pack of Sierra Torpedo or Hopdevil.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,bheilman,3.95,"I had this on draft at the brew pub and got a four pack to take with me from the brewery. It's an overwhelming beer. It's a stretch to call it an IPA, this beer is more of maybe a monster IPA. The beer looks good, has a nice golden color. It smells good, but with more maltiness. The taste is very multidimensional. It's more like a port in terms of the sweetness, but the flavors are all over the place with a nice focus in the hops, with a slightly bitter finishing bite that regresses back to sweetness. The hops flavor doesn't stay long though because of the extreme alcohol. The flavor endures for a good 30 seconds after swallowing this beast with all sorts of sweet fruity goodness. I'm excited to try the beers I've been aging this summer to see what happens. A great beer for a special occasion.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Appearance: Medium amber with a tan/white quarter-inch head. Head recedes quickly and leaves no lacing. Just a scattering of foam on the surface.  Nose: Super sweet smelling (I know, I know, you can't smell sugar). Aromas of dried figs, dates, dried flowers, white rose petals, something like cardboard (not faulted), dried orange peel.  Palate: Immediately sweet and round mouthfeel. There's a little prickle from the alcohol and a warming of the throat after swallowing. Flavors of dried figs, mango withpeel, dried papaya, aloe, hay, lemon, and dusty clay. There's something that really reminds me of a nice sweet Madeira (Malmsey and Bual blend perhaps?).  Notes: Although this monster is super sweet, it hides the 20% abv pretty well. I think there's a lot of complexity on the palate, more than most critics want to admit to. Yes, it's unbalanced, but who ever thought they were going for balance with a 2 hour boil and 45-degree plato? I tried this beer two years ago and thought it was marginally ""overpriced,"" but my opinion has changed.

The beer is full bodied with moderate carbonation. With a 21% ABV 120 is a definite sipper.

Not much head, but great lacing as you work your way through the glass.  Smell: A lot of alcohol aroma hit my nose first. Some very light fruit notes in there as well. A bit intimidating, as if the ABV listed on the bottle wasn't intimidating enough.  Taste: A lot of grapefruit. I'd call it a grapefruit bomb if it were not for the citrus taste that came in later. Hard to swish this brew around in the mouth for too long as the alcohol burn kicks in.  Mouthfeel: Very oily hop feel that sticks to your palate. Little carbonation. Very warm alcohol feel in the back of the throat that travels down your chest for a few seconds.  Drinkability: I found this to be a very good tasting beer, albeit a sipper for sure. I docked it a little in the drinkability department because the ridiculous ABV makes it very hard to get through more than one without being quite drunk. I finished one in about 30 minutes and it was a very surreal feeling getting that tipsy that fast. Thats not to say I didn't like it :)  A great beer for the hophead in you.

The alcohol and sweetness are just too overpowering. I feel like I'm fighting to get to the bottom of the glass.  Wow! This beer packs one hell of a punch! 21% abv is just ridiculous to me. I think 9% is pushing it. I appreciate the fact that beers with this kind of abv are actually made but I think that's what straight liquor is for.  This is supposed to be the holy grail for hopheads- I don't agree. More like the holy grail for alcoholics! I'd rather have a DFH 60 Min IPA.  (p.s.

10099,9086,chakadrum,3.99,"A - There really isn't much lacing or head but the cloudy thickness of it makes me feel like it deserves a more than average rating. I like a beer that just by the sight makes me want to investigate further.  S - Actually very hard to describe. Lots of weird things that don't quite sit as an everyday smell. I thought of manila envelopes. I thought of resin. I thought there was a hint of something illegal in some countries. There are some very earthy fruits.  T - The thing that really surprises me about this is how sweet it is. I suppose that with a beer this big you've got a lot of residue sugar. At the same time there are a ton of hops but not so much the traditional feeling of bitter on the tongue. I suppose that is due to the sweetness. It is a unique taste I struggle for adjectives. I think the alcohol taste is very well hidden as there are only hints of it on the end of a sip.  M - very viscous.  D - You obviously shouldn't plan on driving anywhere.

Aroma of fresh grassy hops, citrus peal, dried fruit/candy sweetness, a little bit of envelope glue and booze. On a good whiff the alcohol stings my eyeballs a little.  Full bodied like hell with a syrupy slick texture, alcohol tingles the palate.  This beer is incredibly sweet at with the flavor of canned peaches in syrup. Fresh juicy hop flavors that are absolutely delicious, a light pine/citrus hop bitterness from the hops. Most of the stinging bite however comes from the incredibly high abv, which is masked very well among the delicious brew. That envelope glue taste that I've been getting in in some of Dog Fish's big beers comes through in the end but is much lesser in this bottle. 21% goes down way too smooth!  I give this beer's drinkability rating a 5 based on it's extreme drinkability despite huge abv.

Combination of sugar, malt, hops, and fruits.  T- This beer can be very deceiving if you go into expecting a traditional IPA.

10099,9086,Brewnami,3.48,"Wow... Absolutely overwhelming. I was very anxious to try this brew because I love the 60 and 90 minute IPA's but this cannot even be categorized with those beers. I guess I didn't know what to expect from a 21% beer, but I was at least expecting somewhat of an IPA taste. This tasted like a really strong, bitter, slightly carbonated wine. In my opinion, no resemblance whatsoever. I would probably have rated this beer higher if I knew what I was in for when I tried it for the first time. I would definitely say its worth picking up, but do not do so on the shear fact that you like 60 and 90 minutes as there is almost no similarities other than the name. If you like barley wines, definitely pick one up and try it. If you are a big IPA fan and are looking for a new imperial IPA to try, heads up, grab a bear republic, stone ruination, a 90 min, or something else. Only available in 12oz singles, my suggestion is that if you havn't had this yet, split it with one other person and/or pour it into a wine glass. The 25-27% ABV Sam Adams Utopias is normally poured in 2oz and this seems like beer that is best in small servings. I poured this into a pint glass and drank the whole thing and when I buy this again I am just pouring it into a small drink/wine glass and drinking a little at a time.

10099,9086,yeastsipper,2.42,"Well, this is an interesting beer that I have wanted to try for a while. Unfortunately, 'interesting' does not always mean 'good.'  Bottle obtained in a trade with Blazer 06. Cracked open the bottle to share in anticipation of the ball dropping on new years eve.  The 120 pours a light copper color with no head whatsoever. this is not surprising given the alcohol content.  There is a heavy alcohol scent to the beer (again, not surprising) and pine notes from the hops. I do detect some citrus, but not as much as many other IPAs. More than anything, peach notes stand out.  This beer is cloyingly sweet. Again, tons of peach flavor. Unfortunately, it is more of a peach schnapps flavor, very sweet and syrupy, than a subtle peach. I can't get over how sweet the beer is. As I tend to love DIPAs for their bitter hop characteristics, this is frustrating. A sweetness lingers on the tongue and palate. And I mean lingers.  For a beer that is hopped 'continously', why is it so sweet? It is simply too sweet, too syrupy, and too strong.  Did I mention that this beer is really sweet?  I love DFH. Their beers were really the driving force of me becoming a beer lover rather than a beer consumer. And I love the fact that they are pushing the envelope. However, the 120 is more of an experiment - and the results of the experiment are a crazy big beer, but not one that really tastes that good or is particularly enjoyable.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Slightly overpowering sweet taste, with strong taste of alcohol. You can tell this was hopped for an extended period. A little too sweet for my taste.  Smooth not overly carbonated or bitter. Not much bite for an IPA. So much alcohol you can feel it.  Have heard about the 120 for a long time and had to try it. I am a big fan of the other Dogfish Head IPA's.

A slightly aggressive pour produces a nice sized head that dwindles down to a thin sheet. A nice amount of bubbles and debris is seen floating throughout the glass.  S- 120 has a super strong smell of sweet malts and some alcohol is present, but not as much as you would think coming from a 21% beer. Caramel on top of citrusy hops with some floral qualities. The dominance of the malts makes for a syrupy smell.  T- similar to the smell with a start of an enormous amount of malt sweetness backed with a nice hop presence. the alcohol is present in the finish as the heat is noticed going down. the sweetness consists of caramel and sugars with a bit of grapefruit coming through. It's almost like i'm drinking syrup which is kind of weird, but most DFH offerings are considered weird to me.  M- Thick, thick and thick, with a full body. I have to say though that for a beer of this size it is pretty smooth going down.  D- For 21% very drinkable but i had to check myself after i found myself drinking this a bit fast. after the 1st few sips i could feel the alcohol taking effect. this is a big beer for big boys & girls who are down for a challenge so be prepared.

Had to try it because I absolutely loved the 60 and 90 minute versions.  This is simply not my kind of beer, though I appreciate just how good this beer is. This was just way too strong and wine tasting for my likes. While it was extremely smooth, this simply is not how I want my IPAs to taste.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,chaz410,4.11,"This is truely an awesome beer,been waiting to try this one for as long as I knew what it was! The pour on this leaves a very cloudy thick body, it's intimidating from the get go. It looks thick and smells completely different than I imagened. I assumed this beer would beer unbelievably hoppy, and while there is plenty of hoppyness on the nose, there's a ton of malty smells of raisens and peaty sweetness. The tast is similar but with definate alcohol pinch. It's very smooth with consideration to the alcohol and it really does ride the malt notes as much as the flower hop flavors. A great beer that everyone should at least try but I do recommend you tell them that drinking one is the same as drinking four+ standard strength beers.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

A smattering of carbonation remains, as well.  S: Hops, honey, raisin, and peaty.  T: Sweet hoppy goodness. Hints of raisin and citrus. Peaty. Not really complex, but do you really expect much more than hops from a 120 minute IPA.  M: Strong alcohol taste. Not a really strong hoppy feel, but the strong alcohol is prominent, and takes away from the hops a bit. Dry. Brandy-like.  D: Good, if you have time to drink it. If not, don't waste your time.  Well, this is an extreme brew. Good to sip from the snifter, as the bouquet is important to this one. Atmosphere, good flavor (although not very complex), good feel.

Split this bottle so I didn't get a full 12 oz pour. Not sure you'd want to drink an entire 12 oz bottle.. This beer was made for sharing. Bright golden amber with excellent clarity. Really a nice looking beer. No lacing or visible carbonation.  Aroma was huge and of pine & citrus. As if you were snorting hop pellets.  This really is an extreme beer. As huge as the flavor was, I was impressed with the balance. Huge sweetness and equally huge hop bitterness. Apricot, Melon/cantelope and honey flavors. Towards the end, some deep pine resin notes.  Syrup like and thick. Big doesn't begin to describe this.  It's very interesting, but I'm not sure I'd want an entire bottle for myself.

10099,9086,Hokies,4.35,Shared this with my brother which I would recommend doing. Pours a nice light brown shade with a big white head and a very sticky lace. The aroma is filled with a grapefruit hop aroma that dominates. The taste is actually almost the complete opposite as the hops are present at first but then the sweet malt takes over coupled with some notes of brown sugar. For such a potent beer this is dangerously drinkable since the alcohol is very well hidden. A sipper but a great beer.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Body is a slightly murky dark amber/brown with a small whitish head that fades fast to a thin film.  S: Waft of booze over brown sugar, honey and caramel malt. Brown sugar-coated oranges soaked in Southern Comfort.  T: Brown sugary-sweet malt with honey sweetness as well. Alcohol is obvious at the finish and hot down the gulley. Finishes with a rounded sweetness and heat. But, there's a semi-dry hoppiness that cleanses the palate a bit, a hint of grapefruit, maybe, allowing you to avoid cloying sweetness. It's not very strong, and if you're not paying attention you'll miss it. But there's a bit of that drying there. Still, it's mostly sweet, with the emphasis on brown sugar and orange licquor (sp?).  M: Heavyweight. Slightly syrupy.  D: A sipper, but more drinkable than I expected, to be honest. Somewhat dangerously so, given the ABV.

Smells of hops, no kidding huh? Resinous Piny Citrusy hops. Lots of malt in the nose as well, caramel, burnt sugar, biscuit. Taste follows the nose, first a hop assault of grapefruit, resin and pine then the caramel, molasses malts mixed in with a little alcohol. Desceptively easy to drink for such a strong brew. Mouthfeel is syrupy, Body is thick, carbonation is moderate. Wow that is one big beer! We both loved this brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

The nose is extremely malty with lots of dates, biscuit and brown sugar. The taste is phenomenal. This tastes like beer despite the ABV. I'm not sure how they did it, but this is quite dangerous. I notice a lot of fruity hops and lots of bready malts as I drink. The alcohol is warming and seems to keep you interested in the beer.

First taste I was not prepared for.. felt like a full on shot of booze.. didn't sit well with me. The next sip, and following sips for that matter, went down much smoother.

10099,9086,TubaManJack,3.03,After much anticipation I finally cracked it open.  Aromatic hop notes and a low carbonation level. The head within the bottle has a irreverence of multiple colors like blue and purple. The pour produced an red amber body and light white wispy head. The body was very thick and akin to cough syrup. The hop flavor was muted and overall produced a substantial disappointment. I was not expecting the camel flavor or lack there off. I was constantly reminded of cough syrup and to flavors which do not meld. The alcohol was very moderated and reduced to a warming after effect.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,ibbjamin,2.6,"Paid $7.99 for a loose 12 oz bottle from Discount Liquor in Milwaukee, WI. Poured into a snifter.  Leaves a fizzy quarter inch white head. Opaque with cloudiness, this has a autumn orange hue to it. Great lacing.  Smells very potent. A fairly strong nose of well hidden alcohol for a 21% ABV. Some orange grapefruit hoppiness mixed into the naughtiness of this one.  Taste is a bit too much for a beer in my opinion. Alcohol comes through more, but is still pretty well mixed in with the grapefruit hoppiness. If I didn't know better, I'd say this was a mixed drink with grapefruit juice.  The mouth is somewhat carbonated. Rather bitter/sour after a while. Medium to full body.  As I drink more of this, I like it less. It is still crazy to me that this is the equivalent to 5 cans of Coors Light in ABV.  Hats off for making a DIPA that is moderately drinkable and 21% ABV. Will I be buying again?

T: WOW. EXPLOSION of flavors. AND SMOOTH! What in the heck. This is by far one of the most intense beers Ive had since DFHs Raison D'Extra. Sweet sweet sweet and no alcohol burn until it hits the stomach. Loads of hops and malt, sour apple (NOT CIDER as that would taste terrible, but imagine for a second SOUR APPLE) phenols and did I say hoppy? Make me happy. Oddly enough it doesnt ring IPA to me but more of a strong ale. Probably because Ive never actually chewed on something as hoppy as this. Not bitter at all, mid range smooth and surprisingly just above thin. Wow, no other way to describe it.  M: Very bouncy but it only compliments this brew. Ages well. Not thick and syrupy like some IPAs but definitely not thin. Perfect.  D: All I can say is watch out, buy a bottle and trust me, it will be more than enough. WAY too smooth.  Overall: If you are complaining or rating this puppy low due to ""ABV BURN"" or the intensity of it then you might as well skip this one and go back to drinking your Blue Moon or oh so flavorful Boston Lager. This thing was made for extremity not for the faint of heart. Confused? Did you expect for a 21% ABV to be light? Maybe you actually have balls and a tongue that exists outside of boring, maybe you should buy it and expect exactly what it is.

Stong earthy hop presence melded with an apricot like sweetness. Undertones of pine, alcohol and an earthy must. Tasting knocked my palate out of place. Very cloyingly sweet with a nice hop bitterness and aroma. Surprisingly, the sweetness is almost matched by the bitterness, almost. Tastes of apricot, lemon, pine resin and alcohol. Finishes quite sweet. Alcohol is very deceiving, doesn't hit you till its dripping down your troat, then burns like a scotch. Mouthfeel has very little carbonation and very syrupy.  An unbelievable beer. I'm not sure if i should judge it by its uniqueness or compare it to any other beer. I think i'll take the middle road. A fantastic experimental brew, but way to cloyingly sweet to even think about having another one for quite a while. The hops are great, i love them.

10099,9086,chrisweingart,3.73,"Trying at room temperature in a dogfish glass (football shaped pint). Allowing to decant for a few minutes. Bottled on 11/05/08.  Appearance - Pours a cloudy orangish-copper. Nice thick head that manages to stay put for a good while.  Smell - Extremely sweet smell that I can almost taste as I inhale it. Can also smell the astringency of what I'm presuming to be the alcohol. Hints of orange and clove? Not sure if I'm overwhelmed with the stronger smells but I can't really place the hops.  Taste - Overload. Taking a second, wasn't really expecting that. Starts off really sweet but quickly evolves to a peppery burn from the alcohol. As my mouth calms down I taste what I would compare to late harvest grapes. Very similar to strong port and dessert wines I've had before. I never really am able to distinguish a definite hop flavor.  Mouthfeel - Definitely finds a way to linger and warm the mouth. Very little carbonation but seems good to me.  Drinkability - Overall an awesome beer, not sure if it's a beer I should enjoy all by myself (not sure if i should, but definitely will finish).

10099,9086,coldmeat23,4.57,"GLASS: Tulip Glass TEMP: Cellared @ approx 50 degrees BOTTLED ON: 04/17/08  Dark copper/light amber in color. Nice two-finger head of light tan foam. Very good retention and the lacing is nicely sticky.  Good hops aroma. Floral, grassy and slightly piney. Big sweet caramel maltiness. Light booziness, though not as much as expected as expected, considering it's over-the-top ABV. Big butterey biscuits. Very sweet and hoppy, overall.  Mmmmm. Good stuff. More like a barleywine with hoppy undertones than an IPA, really. Notes of caramel and raisin from the big malty backbone. Bits of tropical fruit and hints of vanilla. Nice underbelly of big hops spice. Molasses mixing with grapefruit, sprinkled generously with various spices. An odd combo, to be sure, but one that I like. The alcohol provides a nice warming touch, while not being in the way of your enjoyment.  This is a brew with a body that I can love. Big, thick and viscous. It coats the inside of your mouth, along with everything else, on it's way down. Oily, almost verging on sludge-like. Excellent!  This is extremely drinkable, IMO. Sadly, at 21% abv, or thereabout, most people could only down two or three in a sitting before being unable to function.

10099,9086,CAMRAhardliner,4.03,"10.99 at New Beer Distributors in Manhattan.  Pours a murky rust color with bright orange edges. The head is pillowy and medium sized. It has incredible retention for a beer of this weight and it leaves an intricate lacework behind. The aroma is extremely potent, I could smell the mighty malt profile the instant I popped the cap. Sniffing directly from the glass reveals a heady mix of sweet, fruity malts, alcohol heat and a side of citrusy hops.  The taste very malty with a strong tropical fruit, pineapple, tangerine character. An immense bitterness lies underneath the glacial mass of malt. Some pine sap and citrus hop aroma manages to show through the assault occasionally. The booze is alway present, but surprisingly under control for a beer of this weight. The mouthfeel is close to syrupy and mouthcoating. The finish is fruity and bitter with a lingering booziness.  This beer is something to experience, an assault of concentrated beer flavors that needs to be sipped. I cant imagine the amount of malt and hops they use to make this.

10099,9086,MrHungryMonkey,4.62,"1st Review | 05.16.08  The great 120 Minute.  Provocatively syrupy smelling, and a bit alcoholic too. Citric notes, almost like tangerine. A little zesty/spiciness. Quite a noseful; smells like it will be viscous. The syrup/alcohol smell almost takes on a rubber sensation - like latex.  Orange/amber hue, translucent, minimal head.  Oh wow. Not what I expected at all. It's insanely tart, and ripe . A sipper for&#61514;with alcohol heat. Goes down like motor oil laced with whiskey, sure. I do get some rich, dark whisky kind of malt and vanilla hints. A bit of hop bitterness comes into focus through the heat, and helps to tie down a tropical hop vibe. As it warms, I experience more malt and not so much hop. Dominant in the malt, though, is an over-the-top, sickly-sweet sweetness, reminiscent of butterscotch.  It's fun to see where a style of beer can evolve and meander to, given the freedom to be extreme. For my taste, though, this specimen is hard to drink. If you could brew the Elephant Man, this is pretty close to what I'd envision you getting.  I do get flourishes of that perfect malt/hop mix, but mostly I get alcohol and tartness. With all that hop, I sense no harsh hop flavors - something I'm unable to avoid in my IPA brewings.  3 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 2 ___  2nd Review | 12.10.08  Nose is sugary malty, alcohol, and full of bright, floral hops. Strongest is the very sugary, rich, and malty aromas. Hints of vanilla. Smells good, almost very good.  Pours a dirty deep straw color, very hazy, almost fruit-juice looking, almost no head (completely understandable). Looks good.  Flavor hits hard and fast with strong citric juice, rich malty creaminess, and alcohol. First impression can be likened to a spiked orange cream party punch. Incredibly thick and smooth. Citric flavors round out with a nice tartness. Very sweet - like a sweet fruit rather than just raw sugar or excessive maltiness. Reminds me of a nectarine or tangerine, not quite orange or grapefruit. Mild bitterness. Tastes wonderful. Feels even better.  Last time I tired 120Min I was put off by the over-assertive alcohol. This time, I served it at frigid refrigerator temperature. I got a lot more flavor and less raw alcohol heat. Not the IPAest of beers; I'd like to see some more hop flavor to combat the beautiful malt. It doesn't speak Barleywine, but certainly American Strong Ale... Imperial IPA, I guess.  From my previous review: ""if you could brew the Elephant Man, this is pretty close to what I'd envision you getting.""... Man! What was up with my palate that day? Perhaps nothing; perhaps today I have an invisible cold that has immunized me to alcohol's nose-tingling effects; or perhaps I have become numbed, or perhaps this is just not the same batch... regardless, it is really, really, seriously good. It never once flashed up in intolerable heat today. I've had 12%ABV beers that stung worse than this bottle. If I had another I would definitely crack it open when this one's gone. Well done Sam!  This is a beautiful beer that I hope you will get to experience and enjoy. Approach it with an open mind, open palate, and perhaps a stuffy nose (if you're opposed to flavor of pure ethyl alcohol ;-).  3.85 | 4.25 | 4.6 | 4.75 | 4.4",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

You can certainly smell the alcohol but it's not as overpowering as you'd expect from a 20% brew. There is a slight spiciness from the oak at the first taste. This did seem to abate after each sip, no doubt in due to the high abv. Very oily mouthfeel which I love in this beer.

10099,9086,biboergosum,3.97,"Ok, it's Repeal Day Observed, in our southern neighbours, and my Yankee ancestry is encouraging me to try something special from south of the 49th. Tonight that can only mean one thing - a slightly chilled bottle of this sweet elixir to share with my own sweetie. I procured it on a recent trip to impressively beer-rich Austin, Texas. I actually got to try this a few months ago, in the BeerBistro bar in downtown Toronto. A special order from the LCBO, I got past the $30/bottle cost (hey it was dinner, thank you Accounts Payable), and proceeded to kick off that Saturday night in amenable style.  Now, this 'beer' pours a dense cloudy apricot-brown, and looks like fresh-squeezed fruit juice. There is no appreciable head, just a minor reminder of effervescence, and no lacing to speak of. The smell is very strong, crisp, and hot, like fermenting grape must - it actually twinges my nose - and evokes raisins and molasses, and pine hops. The malt only seems omnipotent at first - there is an underlying citrus hoppiness that seems to struggle to make itself known. The flavour starts with grapefruit hops becoming more prevalent, holding the huge raisin malt body at bay only for a bit, until, buoyed by the alcohol, it washes over and envelops your palate. A number of warming spices also appear, difficult to discern amongst it all. The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy, and a tiny carbonated finish delivers a warming to my system that I had previously associated with port or sherry. Accordingly so, this is a slow sipper, lovely for a quaff with the pine scent of the newly-erected Christmas tree nearby.  My hat is off to those sensible folks 75 years ago who reinstated the law and the mindset that paved the way for a brewery like Dogfish Head to create such a sexy beast as this offering.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

The flavor is a malty sweetness with some light hops in the background. While good it's very sweet.

Smells like rubbing alcohol. I'm not looking forward to this but once I take a pull, I'm pleasantly surprised. Sweet, yes. Boozy, yes but pretty tasty. Drinkable? Not unless I want to sleep here with my forehead on the bar.  This is a case where the grading criteria is seriously distorting my ability to tell you how I feel about this beer. Is is supposed to be drinkable? Could it smell or taste anything but boozy at 20%?

10099,9086,abfraser,3.78,"Bought this bottle in early 2007. Not sure how old it is but has a little bit of age on it.  A: Dark copper, burnt orange with a smallish white head.  S: Caramel overload. Huge nose of brown sugar and caramel. Really don't get much more than that.  T/M: There's the brown sugar and caramel again. Bitterness from the hops there to help balance out the sugary sweetness, but there's no hop lingering (which is a good thing in my book). For as over the top hoppy this is supposed to be, I'm a little surprised its not more dominant. Full bodied.  D: A sipper, big time.  Overall, very interesting beer. A little overboard on the sugary sweetness scale, which knocks it down a notch. But I'd enjoy one of these every once in awhile",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,bigkahunas4,4.59,"Poured a 12 oz bottle into my snifter  Poured a headless amber honey, with peach accents. Though lacking any big head, there are some suddy sides, with minimal lacing. The aroma from the 120 minute though, started billowing out of the bottle as I opened it. This is one of the strongest smellers I have ever witnessed. Aromatics range from potent, sweet alcohol, apple, raisin, and pine.  Man is the taste complex. The brew is extremely full bodied with a slight viscosity. Flavors run from sweet fruit notes like white grapes, to honey, to an extremely warming alcohol finish. So slight grapefruit hopiness emerges at the the finish. I really enjoy the flavor of this guy despite the big ABV.  I really loved this, however, after about 6 ounces I was satisfied, as she really is a doozey in terms of ABV and flavors.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,MeanGene,4,"Had to try this beer after a friend of mine ordered a case of it through his father's beer distributor.  Poured an orangish color with a fairly small head...smelled fruity...maybe raspberries? The taste was out of this world considering the 18-22% or so ABV. The mouthfeel was unlike anything I had ever experienced... upon taking a sip, you could feel the effervescence in your mouth and up into your sinuses. Sort of like a soda but very, very different.  Very expensive beer (12 bones/bottle) but definitely one you have to try! Just make sure you stop at 1!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

M: thick and syrupy with a hint of carb.  D: amazing to taste - it's the port of the beer world. If you approach it like you would a port, it's very drinkable, but it's not to swill during the Giants game.  So the mystery question to all fellow brewers - how the heck do they get it down to 1.020 and maintain that sweetness?",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,OlieIPA,3.62,"Thanks to PatronWizard for this gem!!!  A: An orange and hazy appearance that seems to illumintate even further as I hold it closer to my lamp. Poured thin with a nice fuzzy one-finger head. Carbonation is visible as well.  S: I absolutely love the smell!! A strong grapfruit characteristic upfront followed by a dty-piney hop aroma. Incredibly unique and appealing.  T: The alcohol is quite noticeable as expected. Not overwhelming and hidden well, but about what I had anticipated for a 21% ABV. As for the flavor, I picked up a acidic and piney hop flavor with hints of citrus. A carbonated wine taste would be the best way to describe this unique flavor.  M: Clingy and creamy; sticks to the tongue like Velcro. Light to medium body with a decent amount of carbonation.  D: This is definitely a sipper, so I would have to say its a beer that better be enjoyed with food.  Overall: Unique, unique, and unique. I think I got my point across. I was actually a lot more impressed with this beer then I thought I would be, but to be honest, the taste is more unique than good. Not bad at all in the flavor category, but something I won't be dying to get again. Worth a try, but make sure you enjoy a bottle with another person...I made the mistake of drinking this one all to myself. Good job Dogfish Head...you pulled this one off quite well.

This stuff is pretty easy to find, but I remember a few years ago when this was THE FIND. anyways..  A- Pours golden to slightly amber with very little head.  S- Sweet sugar, apricots and subtle citrus hops.  T- This is not an upfront hoppy beer. Its actually very sweet. Very tasty, complex sweetness followed by very tasty, tolerable hops bitterness that stays subtle. Very well done.  M- Very thick, creamy almost syruppy.  D- This is one of the biggest beers, yet it really goes down so easily. This is my favorite beer to share with people who have never tried it. I say, trust me, you won't expect this stuff.

Taste is over the top, so much citrus it's like having a glass of orange juice. I mean, Goddamn, I love an intense IIPA but there is such a thing as too much of a good thing. Halfway through the glass I was getting tired of the stuff. Carbonation is intense but in the ballpark, and the outrageous alcohol content is impressively well-hidden.

Looks very appealing.  S- Very sweet smelling with candy, a little funky, a slight hint of vegetable and plastic. The alcohol is not nearly as strong as I would have expected. It is also not a nostril burning hop bomb like I would have expected either. Very complex and sweet.  T- Very sweet and complex and unlike anything I have ever had before. The alcohol is warming, but not overly harsh... or I guess not nearly as harsh as you would think it would be for 21% ABV. Kind of a boozy candy beer.  M- Dry, bitter, and warming. That being said, it's awesome. It is also very creamy.  D- For the ABV, this is obviously a sipper. But is so unique and tasty, you have to appreciate the work that went into this.

Quite nice, and thre is not too much alcohol to smell. Taste is very sweet but it kinda levels up with citrusy and hoppy notes. Alcohol is noticable, but it's warming and not offensive. Mouthfeel - thick, very heavy, but smooth and silky. For 21% ABV it's drinkable. I would go for more than 1 at the time, but I would definately have it again. It's very unique brew, very balanced, warming and complex with very nice citrus notes. Alcohol is very well hidden there for 21% and it is not dry at all. Very nice.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Kadonny,4.45,"Poured from tap into a miniature snifter glass at Capones in Norristown. What a treat.  A: A medium amber orange color with a slight layer of tight laced head. Tight small glass lacing.  S: Wow, lots of sugar sweetness with layers of bubble gum, hard candy and citrus pine hops. Second sniff produces a large amount of bubble gum sweetness, almost like a blow pop. Alcohol is noticable on the nose.  T: Syrupy sweetness with flavors of a sugar cube, candy, bubbble gum, sweet fruits, caramel and a real citrus pine bitter hop bite. The finish comes back to the sugar sweetness and finally ends with hops lingering in the mouth minutes later.  M: Heavy and coating with a fairly heavy alcohol feel when the beer warms up. Sticky sweetness with bitterness lingers in the entire mouth.  D: Medium for this alcohol level. The beer does go down fairly smoothly but with a big alcohol bite. One can only drink a minimum amount of this beer.  Overall a real unique beer that everyone should be lucky enough to try. It really is a testament to DFH that they actually make this beer, it is groundbreaking.  Edit: I'm editing this review and upping socres because of an experience I had while drinking a fresh bottle not long ago. Bottle was dated January 2015 and was consumed February 2015. I tell you that beer was mind blowing. So complex with huge mouth numbing hops, huge malt sweetness with less candy sweetness as I got before. Make no mistake, it was sweet and alcoholic, but fresh this beer is balanced by the huge hops and boy is it fantastic.

I could definitely tell it had a high alchohol % but not overpowering.  Took about an hour to drink and was a very enjoyable sipper. Warming as it sat didn't take away from it at all.

10099,9086,Padron4KM,4.64,"2008 vintage. 12 oz bottle. Pours cloudy orange with a nice two finger, slow to disapate, creamy tan head.  Aroma is ruby red grapefruit crushed with lots of pure cane sugar. It literaly smells like you took a 5 lb bag of grapefruit, placed it on a 20 lb bag of sugar and stomped the hell out of it. One whif and you can tell this beer is well rounded.  Flavor starts out a bit sweet, almost sugary, but is tempered by the caramel, and the well defined grapefruity hops.  Slick, begining mouthfeel almost detects high abv, but by the way it goes down you would never know. more please",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,mnstorm99,2.46,"Alright, before I get flamed here. I appreciate this beer, but all I could think of (while drinking it) was cloying, sloppy mess. I expected it to be sweet (20%+ ABV will do that), but there is way too much sweet malts used in this one. Nice cloudy orange copper pour, but it lacks the head that would be expected in an IPA. Aroma is all malt, very non-IPA like, and very sweet malt at that. Taste is similar, although I do get some of the hops mainly spicy and floral hop notes. But the hops are way overpowered by sweet carmel and honey malt. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth, coats well, but this is a 20%+ beer, and it should feel good going down. Drinkability, I finished the beer, it took me a couple of hours which didn't change much with the temperature change. But I would never buy another bottle for the price. I did finally get to try this beer. I probably would have appreciated this beer more, if I got any hop character out of it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,marcpal,4.29,"Week long vacation starting today, start off tonight finishing up some work with style by breaking out one of these.  Never sat down with one at home to review.  12oz bottle poured into oversized DFH snifter. Bottle graphics: Classy, B+  A: The beer looks innocent on the pour. Pale orange color with a thin head that faded fast.  S: Ultra sweet smell, nothing remotely close to any form of IPA. Smells like a true barleywine or flat out wine. A slap in the face of sweet flavors. Somehow the hops make themselves known so you know for a fact there are a ton in there. Alcohol detectable? Oh yes, the alcohol is more than noticeable. Warms the throat just from the aroma.  T: Bold, sweet, bracingly intense. No more hops really but somehow, some way you just feel that they are there in the flavor. Something nutty coming through that combines with the hard alcohol flavors. Just like Ive had when on tap and from younger bottles, the hops finally start to be detected and its just mindblowing intense in a variety of ways.  M: The heat of this bad boy sets the tonsils on fire. Carbonation doesnt even bother trying. As thick as some grade B maple syrup straight from the trees of Vermont in the fall.  D: I like this one with a little more age but I can say Ive also enjoyed a 6oz pour from tap even more at a fresher date. At 21%, it is shockingly 'drinkable'. You will not have more than one in a sitting but after a few other low hitters, this one comes in a bats cleanup like Bonds on his Balco regimens.

Nose was strong bit of hops and alcohol. Some dried fruits on the nose with some citrus, apricot and malts. The beer over 2 years had really balanced itself on the taste. Hops had subsided. Previously I thought the brew was way off balanced, to hopped up and too hot to finish. Now it was great. Another two years and it would be perfect. Taste was warming, sweet, hopped, well hopped, the citrus feel in the middle. Mouthfeel was good and warm. Drinkability gets better with age. Much better. Another two years and I would give it a 5.

I let it age over ten months, then had a friend over that I knew would appreciate it, so the time was right crack it open and share.  Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a wine glass. Nice, rich golden/bronze in color. Very hazy with light colored flecks suspended. A little bit of a head that reduces to an oily film. Not really much lacing, it's more like syrupy ""feet"" that wine leaves.  Wow, intense smells. I cracked open the bottle and a few seconds later my friend leaned over, ""is that the beer I smell?"" I love brews that can be smelled from a few feet away. Intensely sweet citrus... orange and pineapple in syrup. Maybe a bit of pine resin, but the hops are mostly sweet, nectar citrus. Also rich alcohol nose. I haven't had much hard alcohol, but maybe a brandy or cognac aroma there?  Flavors are extremely concentrated and complex. Definitely sweeter than I expected. Lots of hops still (despite being 10+ months old), in the order of sugary, nectar-like citrus. Alcohol is noticeable, but much less than I expected for this big of a beer. For being such an ""extreme"" beer, it seems to me to be something very dignified and calm. The hops don't rip your tongue off, the sugars don't over sweeten, and the alcohol isn't boozy. Somehow, they mingle and compliment each other very well. Not much that I can discern of the malt profile besides residual sweetness. Nor bittering... lots of aromatic dry hopping, but they didn't add much of the bittering type of hops.  Mouthfeel is slick and oily. It thankfully escapes being hot from the ABV, which I was thinking it probably would be. Maybe slightly thinner in body than I expected, but maybe that's because I was taking small sips.  I'm glad I drank this as a dessert beer after dinner. It went great with coconut macaroons! Give this beer a lot of time to drink, it takes some patience to enjoy, but this one truly exceeded my expectations. Very drinkable in the sense of tastiness and enjoyment, but price, availability, and sessionability factor into my drinkability score, none of which are positives in this case.  Nevertheless, I heartily recommend sharing this beer after a good dinner at least once. It is expertly crafted by the artists at DFH. Thanks for the opportunity!

The alcohol definitely overwhelms the hops, but don't doubt that you'll smell the hops. Probably more hoppy than any beer I've ever smelled.  T: Honeslty, I tasted something that tasted like a shot of vodka in a barrel of hops. Very full bodied beer that also had a bit of a fruity pineapple taste. By the time I got to the end of it and it was a bit warmer, the tastes of grapefruit or some sort of dry fruit came out big time.  M: Syrupy! Left nice oils in your mouth. I couldn't get the hops taste out of my mouth for hours after I drank this beer. The oils and my love for hops gave this one a higher rating than most would give it.  D: Beer took me 3 hours to drink.. maybe a bit longer. I had to sip it like I was sipping a glass of scotch. Couldn't ever drink more than one of these at a time.. ever.

I wouldn't pair this beer with food, or drink more than one serving of it but it is a great beer to experience.

My initial reaction was to the wondeful scent of this beer, it had a great array of fruity scents, a touch of sweetness and of course a sort of grain alcohol burn too. I didn't get a bunch but I had a good 5oz's and it was enough to see why it has a great reputation. It had an amazing taste that lingered for quite some time.

I think someone snuck some weed in this beer because a smell like this cannot come from any kind of normal hop, it's like some mutated, super hop, on steroids, on a three day meth binge. Just super sticky, super, sweet, boozy, essential oils, essence of hops, whatever you want to call the most pure form of distilled hop aroma ever created. If you don't take time to enjoy some of the nuances this beer has to offer it may come of smelling like nail polish remover, the beer is big and such things are possible, but there is so much more than just booze here.  T/MF: Hot and sweet, syrup on the tongue and the back of the throat. Boozy hop juice, little carbonation, if any at all. Super full bodied, syrupy consistency. Taste is big everything, big malt sweetness, hot, wet, sweet, hops. Sweet, almost overripe pineapple and mango, serious nutty and pine resins and mild booziness all mix together yet are able to define themselves as seperate entities in the beer. Just needs a bit more carbonation to keep things a bit more interesting in the long run.  D: I've been drinking this beer for well over a half hour and have barely gotten halfway though. For as big as this beer is, it hasn't turned into a giant boozy mess and this shows incredible skill on the part of the brewer. An amazing accomplishment to say the least, and certainly an adventure to drink. The taste and complexity of this beer make for an interesting drinking session, not to mention the size of this beast, whose size, though it lets you know it's bit, still stays remarkably well hidden.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,djeucalyptus,3.58,"I'm not even sure how to begin this review... or how to properly score based on the usual criteria. This just isn't your everyday brew. I try to score based on other brews in the same category, but this one just doesn't quite fit. It falls somewhere between an insane DIPA, a Barleywine, and grain ethanol... not necessarily in a bad way.  a. pours a beautifully rich bright marigold verging on pumpkin, with a billowy, thick golden head that isn't going anywhere. It seems to be sculpted out of syrup. The lacing is some of the thickest and most mollasseslike I've seen.  s. Alcohol. Definite hops, with an almost artificially surreal grapefruitiness on the nose. It mixes up front with an intense and nearly intoxicating alcohol bite. Some floral hops peek through, as does the brown sugar and maple notes. bread and malt notes are all but drowned out by the alcohol and the overwhelming hop aromas.  t. Wow. It tastes like I'd expect a 21% DIPA to taste like. Overly sweet and sugary at first, and then the tongue is bombarded by a one-two punch of intense grapefruit and pine hops, and then the intense alcoholic maltiness.  m. Thick and syrupy, it leaves a lingering bitter alcohol oil on the roof of my mouth and back of my throat. Even the strong carbonation couldn't absolve the intense hoppiness clinging to my throat nearing the brink of alcohol burn. Definitely an interesting experience.  d. This is definitely a big brew, and it's pretty much in its own field. Definitely for sipping, this one was almost too over the top - and I love over the top brews. You have to try it if you have any interest at all... but whether or not you need another one in your life is up to you. Definitely an experience.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

S- Smell was very fruity, slightly malty with a presence of hops and a hint of strong alcohol at the end.  T- This beer was very sweet which I wasn't expecting but was very good. Hops definitely come through after the sweetness with a nice maltiness to go along with it. The alcohol is very well covered up, I would never guess this beer was around 20% if I tried it blindly.  M- Thick mouthfeel and light carbonation. Warmed up my mouth, throat and belly momentarily after the first sip.  D- I could easily sip on a couple of these. It tastes like nothing I've ever had before but in the good sense. Not your typical IPA but very interesting and good all around. I will hopefully have another one of these in the future.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Looks like melted caramel, just a lighter shade. Looks incredibly thick. Small head of small bubbles, short lived. Has several shades actually. Or layers would be more correct. Like an ogre. Reminds me of pulp or mulch.  Can't place the smell. It doesn't smell like hops. Taking a sniff burns the eyes, alcohol I believe. Smells like some form of resin or glue. Not what I was expecting from reading the label.  Tastes like it smells. Resin or glue. A slight hint of hops way at the end. I'm baffled with this. Gotta look it up. &lt;Checks out 120 Min on Beer Advocate&gt; Ok, so I'm an asshole. It's the MONSTER 21% ABV that's kicking my ass. And kicking my ass some more. I thought I would be drinking a DIPA like Pliny or something. Expected way more hop flavor.  Very syrupy. Seriously.

Open er up, get a whiff. Wow. Felt loaded just smelling it. Hops bitterness will hit you, but it's perfectly balanced with syrupy sweetness. Very big beer.

10099,9086,gyllstromk,3.5,"This review is from my notes.  I've wanted to try this one for a long time, but it's too strong for legal sale in NC. Many thanks to Sara for smuggling it in.  This beer tastes like a hopped up riesling: very sweet, with some pine notes and a mildly astringent hop effect. Malts are apparent.  The mouthfeel was the only problem with this beer. It left a pretty syrupy coating and aftertaste. At 21% this is not one for sessioning.  I would not stock my fridge with this beer, but highly recommend trying it at least once. It's a very interesting beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,JoeMayo,4.18,"A- Pours a dark gold color; almost brown and significantly darker than most IPAs. A slight head forms but recedes to a ring around the snifter for the remainder of the beer.  S- The actually hits before the hops. Caramel, toffee, and sugar come through pretty clearly. An astringent hit immediately precedes the piney and citrusy hops.  T- The sweetness comes through above all, but the hops are certainly there. Pine and citrus smooth over the palate with the almost syrupy sweetness and body of the beer.  M- Thick, sticky, with just enopugh carbonation to keep the beer alive. A slight alcohol burn is noticed after swallowing the beer, but not in the mouth.  D- This goes down very easy for a 20+% ABV beer. It's smooth and well-rounded, and not nearly as astringent as I would have immagined. Overall, a really solid beer that dares to cross lines and push limits.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

S: Main portion of nose is alcohol which makes sense with as high as the ABV is. Slight twinge of grapefruit which I usually find in Imperial IPAs.  T & M: The alcohol is definitely apparent but surprisingly does not overwhelm. Quite sweet which I suppose if from the large amount of malt to offset the hops. Surprisingly the hops are not hardly apparent as well. Mouthfeel thick and syrupy.  D: Considering the ABV the beer is drinkable but I'm not sure I would see out again. Just a little too overwhelming but I'm glad i finally had it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,razorsdescent,4.4,"This is my first review.  Let me start out by saying that i prefer strong ales and IPA's  I had this brew at RFD in washington DC.  While eating dinner with a friend i noticed this beer and was attracted by the high ABV which exceeded anything i have previously had. at $20 for 12oz bottle i had fairly high hopes.  A pouring into the glass it had a nice autumn color maybe a little darker than a normal IPA but still attractive  S this is where things started to go down hill it wasn't horrible but behind the hops smell there was this sickly sweet smell.  T Now maybe i got a bad bottle but this was disgusting. Between college and the army i have had some horrendous alcoholic beverages but this was on par with rot gut tequila. The only two discernable tastes were that of a sickly sweet syrup that leads into a taste that i can only define as industrial alcohol or everclear.  M The mouth feel was fairly thin and unimpressive.  D this is the least drinkable beer ive ever had  i wasnt even able to finish the bottle. i eventually poured what was left into a half filled glass of a dark amber ale the resulting drink actually tasted rather delicious.  I believe there was probably something wrong with my bottle leading me to believe that maybe the brewing process used for this beer is a little hit or miss and i got one of the misses. i plan on trying this beer again at another venue and finding out.  Well, it finally happened. Years later, I have had 120 Min and enjoyed it very much. During a friend's going away party rare beer that he could not take with was flowing like Coors. A bottle of indeterminably aged (> 1 year) 120 Min was opened, and it was great. It was given to me blind, with the desire that I guess what it was. It was completely different than the previous times I had tasted it, and I was able to taste it fresh, and without bias. My updated scores reflect this tasting. If anybody has read this twice, remember to age before you drink.   Original score 4,3,1,2,1",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,jbphoto88,3.1,"A muddy copper brown color that is translucent not transparent. There is a fine tan head with some sticky lacing that fades to a hop oil slick that puddles in the middle of the glass.  Smell is deceptively simple. This doesn't smell like a 21% ABV beer. In fact it is a lot like a simple IPA. There is a deep caramel malt scent followed by a light citrus... all balled up and soaked in rum. I guess I was expecting over the top hop scents followed by rough alcohol notes but only some rum notes float to the nose.  The taste is again surprisingly deceptive. There is no over the top flavors like one would expect from such an extreme beer. The start is citrus syrup followed by a malty backbone. The finish is sweet mixed with bitterness. The big turn off to this one is the grain alcohol flavor that persists through out the experience. Its not heavy like doing shots, its more like the after taste of and burn of shots.  I'm not a fan of the syrupy feel or the dry grainy finish.. This beer is a heavy sweater on a summer day. It's a novelty act that almost becomes undrinkable because of the high ABV. Definitely a sipper or a chugger if you want alcohol poisoning. I would recommend trying this one once and then aging it for a few years. Perhaps the negatives will mellow and accent the positives after some age.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

So after an awesome weekend in Boston, including the Great American Beerfest, We decided to check out the 100+ taps at the Sunset Grill. So ive learned over the years that there is always an item that isnt on the menu, so i asked our waiter if there were any special beers on tap that werent listed....and low and behold DFH 120min on tap...JACKPOT  A - Nice cloudy orange color with a huge foamy head  S - Hops, hops and some more hops. Really you can't smell anything else some grapefruit/citrus notes  T - Sweet with a lot milder hop flavor than expected from the smell. The only flavor I could pick out was orange peel. and more hops  M - Medium bodied with good carbonation.  D - Pretty easy drinking considering the 21% ABV  I had this out of the bottle once, and i dont think the bottle has that old and i did not enjoy at all, way to much alcohol and not a good hop balance, but on tap a totally different beast",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Pretty large malty backbone here and not nearly as bitter as I expected at all. I can't pick up hardly any alcohol in this one at all.  M- Chewy, full bodied and low carbonation.

A- An off white head with firm structure, but one which possesses large soda-like bubbles as well! The color profile is a beige-amber and the head dissolves to unearth a fizzing mayhem of beer body.  S- Like a carbonated/hopped brandy...so rich and fruitful. I wish they bottled this smell. I'd wear it as cologne any day of the week. Watch out, beer ladies.  T- A sweet fathom of energy that gives way to a metallic/pale taste. The complexity is messing with my head, and all I can think about is BALLANCE! Not only in the literal sense that 20% abv is coursing through my veins, but in the sense that this beer delivers such a balanced wallop to every sense!  M- Caramel, molasses, pennies, battery acid, camembert, orange peel, apricot and alpha acid!  D- This is such an expensive beer I just want to curl up and die thinking I just drank 20 dollars away in 2 minutes!

10099,9086,BirdFlu,4.02,"I think anyone who goes for one of these pobably has an idea of what they are getting into.. I was pleasantly surprised, however, that a lot of what I was expecting turned out to be incorrect. For such a high ABV beer I was expecting a much, much thicker, sludgey, malt-bomb. Indeed, there is a ton of malt in the smell and flavor, but it is (somehow) balanced quite impressively, that is, while working on this scale, with hop. It doesn't look the way I thought it might look (its a very cark, cloudy copper/orange). It smells very strongly of both hop and malt, moreso than even the 60 min IPA's malt aroma. The taste has a lot of hoppy tree/forest-like essence right behind an upfront flavor of dark cherries and raisen sweetness. The mouth isn't nearly as heavy as I was expecting, aside from the somewhat-extreme taste, its ABV isn't so noticeable in the mouthfeel. It is a little syrupy, however.Drinkability is a hard one to determine... on one hand, it's pretty extreme in aroma, flavor, etc. And, of course, its over 20% alcohol (and, I believe, something like 500 calories according to the DFH website). However, it definetely gains points for not being really that difficult to get thru or swallow. Its really good.

White head with so so retention but quite good lacing.  Hoppy aroma to this brew I have not smelled before. The hops are very fresh, very organic smell. Some sweetness could be noticed in the nose but the over all hop aroma is right up front.  Very sweet flavor. Honey, apple and grape flavors. The bitterness can be noticed but is easily overtaken by the malt sweetness. Warming alcohol but not hot like many other high abv brews.  Very smooth and creamy for the abv.

Poured a dark, hazy copper with very creamy head that stuck around. Obviously the hops were apparent from the smell, to the mouth, to the finish, but what I found interesting was the slightly mild fruity finish which almost tasted of apricots.

10099,9086,CrellMoset,4.05,"12 oz. bottle courtesy of edelweiss, purchased at Market Street Wine, downtown location, Charlottesville, VA. Poured into a traditional American pint glass, because lord only knows what the proper glassware to serve this beer in is.  Appearance: Pours a muddy, hazy, particulate-dense orange/brown amber with a one-finger fluffy, tan, fine-bubbled head (this part is surprisingly normal-looking). Retention is average, but lacing is definitely alcohol-retarded.  Aroma: Orange zest, leafy, spicy mint notes, a sharp, spicy alcohol. Other fruits, too - apples, pears, bananas, and lemon.  Taste: Holllly crap. Leafy and spicy up front, followed by sweet, sticky caramel malts - honey-like, roasted, citrus and some slightly darker fruits (which, in conjunction with the wicked alcohol, lends a distinct spiced rum note). And there's banana - definitely banana, I taste it in the afterfeel (i.e., the belch). There are spiced notes here - cinnamon, and spicy, chemical-esque plant phenol notes. There's bitterness, too, and it's up there (duh), but there's definitely enough sweetness to balance - more than enough, even. Oh, did I mention there's alcohol? Um, yeah - there's alcohol. It's spicy, which melds with all sorts of other spices going on here in a pleasant way, but the alcohol itself is, while not harsh or hot, sort of chemically, which is where I have to knock this beer.  Mouthfeel: Low-to-medium bodied but incredibly fine-bubbled and smooth, creamy, milky, and with a thick, syrupy, resinous, sticky body.  Drinkability: Had this one with some sharp cheddar cheese, and thank god. This is one biting bastard of a beer. It's spicy, fruity, sweet, bitter, astringent ... how do you even rate a beer like this? This beer improves slightly with warmth, peaks, and then goes precipitously declines in quality. The alcohol is high, but not high enough to make it too difficult for me to spell precipitously.

Taste: Sweet mother of god! This is ambrosia. Very fruity- grapefruit mixed with honey and a great malty flavor that balances everything out. Perfectly balanced and the best IPA I have ever tasted. There is a little blackberry in there, too.  Mouthfeel: Oh so perfect. Thick and meaty, but dry enough not to be too cloying. Nice moderated carbonation tickles the tongue and throat.  Drinkability: Very heavy. I would not have more than one of these in a sitting. It also packs a pretty heavy punch so I wouldn't want any more anyway.

T- Taste is exceptional for the 21%ABV(Really?) tastes like an IPA with every ingredient doubled, perhaps tripled. Truly unique and intense. Beware, this beer will shock you if you've never tasted a craft beer made for heavy flavor, like Arrogant Bastard.  M- Feel is perfect for what I look for in beer.

Almost like a cappuccino.  Smell was sweet and alcohol and was pretty hard to handle. I didn't get any hops on the nose at all.  Sweet and balanced taste, dark fruits in the sweetness with just a slight bitterness that balanced well. Alcohol taste well hidden while drinking but it burns going down.  Mouthfeel is very heavy, a little carbonation could do this beer a lot of good in my opinion. Left a film feeling on the mouth and a burn in the throat.

T: The initial flavor was pungent grapefruit, a big sugary sweetness and floral hoppiness; also some sweet caramel and sweet pine resin. Caramel and sweet grapefruit finish. Slight alcohol awareness for a beer thats 21% ABV; guess its masked by the huge sweet malting and citrusy sweet hopping. The strange balance brought to this beer has to be experienced.

10099,9086,Dodo2step,4.27,P- Grape and Gourmet in Va Beach!  my 150th review and i have a dandy!  A- Pours a nice colorful reddish orange color. Like a tomato mixed with a pumpkin or better yet an orange tomato (If you ever ate one of those).  S- strong citrus hops aroma. alcohol and pine are the other dominant fragrances.  T- fermented alcohol is the first thing i taste but then there is grapefruit and pine that complement the strong essence of alcohol extremely well.  M- potent and citrus mouthfeel. Nothing to much except the burning alcohol sensation as it goes down my throat.  D- considering the high ABV this bad boy is only good for one or two a day at most. Finish a sixer of this and you will bein a coma. Good flavor and easy to put down for the most part.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Pauly2X,3.7,"A- Light amber, one finger head.  S- Lots of citrusy hop aroma with an unusual underlying sweetness.  T- Wow, impressive to say the least. The instant this beer hits your lips it could be mistaken for any other DIPA, this is where the similarites stop. The assertive up front bitterness is amazingly balanced out by not only a solidly sweet malt profile but also a strong warming alcohol note. The alcohol note then dominates the finish.  M- Syrupy, yet still has good carbonation.  D- If you think this is ""drinkable"" then your balls are bigger than mine.  In my opinion this beer defines extreme beer. Simply a must try for any beer geek, especially hop heads. To be honest I didn't really ""like"" this beer but damn do I respect it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,phantomwyse,3.55,"A: Deep caramel brown/orange or the color of really rusty water. No transparency at all. Barely a head. Carbonation is there, but hard to view it.  S: Sweet molasses, burnt caramel, slight floral pine aroma, fermented juice, the high alcohol is perceived just at the end.  T: Tremendous sweet and tart collision right at the beginning. Lots of malt notes, baked breads, warm biscuits. The hops are in there but they are submerged under a burden of malt.  M: Creamy, chewy, astringent just for a passing moment.  D: This is a beer to be a appreciated more than drank. It's heavy and the taste can be shocking to the unaccustomed. I've had this beer before and it always takes a gracious amount of time and a lot of little sips in order to retire it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,positiverpr,3.63,"a: bronze and turbid with slight haze that was probably due to my serving it too cold. finely b eaded, thin and wispy but lasting head.  a: pears and apples. winey? minimal hops. etoh!!  taste: sweet and ?cidery?. hop note there and bitterness is there but its overwhelmed by sweetness. not being a big dogfish fan, i didnt realize that this was 21% when i opened it. I was suprised by the alcohol in aroma but this beer hides it amazingly well in taste. i would have guessed 12% before i read other reviews. alcohol more prevalent as it warms. lingering maltiness that is not in initial taste.  mouthfeel: tart and viscous(cant bring myself to type syrupy)  overall: not what i was expecting. my initial impression was not good(mentioned that it was served cool). a unique experience indeed. dfh should think about re-categorizing this beer, so as not to have people expecting a typical dipa although i cant find a reason that it doesnt technically fit. one of my first questions was ""would i recognize this as beer if i didnt know?"" would i pay 10$ for another? yes but just barely and i'd split it with at least one other person, because i need a nap.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,itcomesnpints,4.65,"Surprisingly extensive creamy head covers a light bronze haze. A candied aroma of apricot, pineapple and ginger succeeds at masking the high abv. The taste is fruity and spicy, and there really is no apparent bitterness from the hops. The alcohol is concealed very well by the generously carbonated and full-bodied mouthfeel. 120 Minute IPA is more drinkable than expected, and the only factor keeping it down is the high price (lucky for me or I wouldn't be walking away from this one). All in all this is a great ""beer"". Calling it a beer is a stretch. Calling it an IPA is comical. But calling it incredible is an understatement.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Nowhereman529,3.98,"This beer poured a very nice, hazy amber from the bottle. It left little head and what little there was dispersed pretty rapidly.  Smell is very strong on hops. Like being in a field of hops with the smell of hops being piped in from some other hops field. Of course with hops there's a little pine scent to it at well.  Wow, so ok, not what I expected at all. As it turns out this is a pretty sweet beer. Not like any other IPA I've ever had. It gets an 'A' for uniqueness, but a 'B-' for the style. Again, strong on hops flavor, minus the bitterness. Really, it's like sweet hops, it's hard to distinguish much else.  Mouthfeel was a bit of a let down as well. There's a reasonable amount of carbonation, but the beer still feels like is a bit too syrupy for an IPA.  Overall this is a reasonably drinkable beer, and at 21% abv, one or two of these and you're down anyway. I'd drink it again for sure.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

10099,9086,schoolboy,4.76,"If anyone asks, Dogfish Head 90 is my favorite ""everyday"" beer. That's not to say that it isn't special, it's just that it is readily available and I wish I could drink it every day (but of course that would cause health problems). I have always loved it, and I have never aged any of it.  At first the Dogfish Head 60 was a disappointment to me. But I later realized what a dope I was. It was just something completely different. Now I love it, especially on tap.  A few years ago (when my son started at Purdue) I was able to procure a few bottles of 120 in Indiana (they can't sell it in Ohio - too much alcohol). They were around $10 each. I just let the suckers sit in storage until today, when I finally had one (I have been meaning to do this). I had good reason, I wanted to relax and enjoy something special - I deserve it. 120 did not disappoint.  I had an opportunity to buy preaged bottles of 120 at their brew pub in Delaware last summer but for whatever reason I passed (I am pretty sure the price was in the $15 range and I was already spending a bundle there). But the one I am drinking is one I aged myself. It's over two years old. Everything seems to be settling in on it.  It is sweet, hoppy, well balanced. There does not seem to be a boozy smell whatsoever. The alcohol is definitely there, but the smell is not. The smell actually is a bit weaker than I would like. Everything else about this beverage is what I would expect from a well aged, over hopped, over malted ale. Smooth.  It was worth the wait and the $10. Now I have to think about (1) when to drink the rest of them and (2) how to get some more to put up for later. And how the hell do you follow that act?",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,glid02,4.15,"Got this from the Liquor Loft in Tallahassee.  Pours a good copper color that lightens up to amber when held up to the light. Big two-finger white head that recedes into a thin layer of bubbles on top of the beer. Pretty cloudy, and not much lacing.  Smell is very sweet. The alcohol is also noticeable, and there's just the faintest tinge of hop bitterness.  Tastes very sweet as well. The alcohol is surprisingly well-hidden, but it does feel warm on the way down. There's a little taste of hop citrus at the beginning and end, and both the bitterness and the sweetness can be tasted when I lick my lips.  Mouthfeel is good. Carbonation is at a good level, and it's very thick. Goes down as smooth as is to be expected with 21% ABV.  Rating the drinkability on this is hard. It's certainly a sipper, but for a beer this big it's pretty drinkable.  Overall I'm glad I finally got my hands on one of these. Very interesting, and worth a try.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,PerzentRizen,4.48,"Dogfish Head's brewery has always been at the top of my list, but I just recently got a chance to sample their 120 minute IPA. This beer truly is the ""holy grail for hopheads.""  I poured mine into a tulip rimmed chalice at around 50 degrees. The color is light mahogany to oak. The initial head was frothy and thick which quickly reduced to a thin lacing around the edges to the end.  The aroma of alcohol, vinous fruit, and orange peels is only out-matched by the extreme hop presence.  Upon first taste mouthfeel is huge and the alcohol is almost too much at low temperatures. Better serve this beer around 55-58 degrees to minimize the alcohol bite and let the hops take control (let's face it that's why you wanted this beer anyways).  The taste is hoppy and full but not bitter. I think the alcohol cuts the bitterness into shreads. The twang is almost in line with a flanders style red. If you love the flemish sour ales you will absolutely love this!  The carbonation is reduced as a result of the long fermintation, but it isn't missed. The bottle variety is almost like a cask ale (without the oak overtone).  I will definately keep the other three I bought in storage for a while as these need some time to cure (probably 2 years plus). I loved it and I think in a few years I'll love it even more. I think trying a flight of these from five different years would be interesting. I would liken its current taste to a Samichlaus Helles. Enjoy this one slowly!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Squelch,4.08,"Appearance: Cloudy murky. Off white head. Very unappealing color  Smell: Wonderful grassy, earthy, and piney hops. Very aromatic.  Taste: Hops aggressive.

Drinakablity: A sipping beer that is to be enjoyed on a special occasion.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,reignsong,4.25,"Like the 90 minute, you'll love smelling this one. Unlike the 90 minute, you'll love the smell more than the taste, but the tast is still good.  It's nearly identical in appearance to the 90, but no real head. A head is not necessary for me, and sometimes a turnoff, personal preference. So this is ideal on that front.  The taste is heavy, and knocks your socks off at first. The further you get into the 12 oz glass, the taste seems to build on teh long lasting residual aftertaste.  It's good to split, actually it's perfect for that. I finished this beer in an hour and needed a nap not knowing the alcohol content. A definite sipping beer to sniff for long intervals between sips. I nurse it throughout the occasional hockey game, and it suits that well.  The taste is syrupy. There is a hot spiciness from the hops and alcohol content, if you have one two days in a row, your throat will burn the second day. It is intense, but tasty and imaginative. Well deserving to be the choice special occasion beer for hop heads.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,clayrock81,4.32,"My bottle is the latest batch to come out as it was bottle 7/7/08. Poured into a snifter because I was told this batch was maltier than the usual so I figured I would go with that instead of a winge glass or tulip. Poured a cloudy auburn with gold tints that gave one-finger head that stuck around forever and left a slight lace ring. A complex array of sweet malts like caramel, butterscotch and maybe honey or something. Also in the nose is a great hop presenece that brings both citric fruit notes (lemon) and some tart and dark fruits like sour apples, pear and a little black cherry. My first instinct when trying this is that it would be a ""hopbomb"", and it VERY hoppy, there is a thickness and stickiness to it from the sweet malts (mostly caramel in this regard). There is also tart and citric fruit tastes in this fuller-bodied beer that rolls across the tongue for the most part (like I said, a tad sticky at some points). The only drawback is a very minor alcohol burn on the backbite which stems from the immense ABV%. For that reason (the ABV, not the burn) and the cost (I'm not rich) prevent me from sessioning this bad boy. This reminded me a of Belgian Triple and maybe a heavy Dubbel, and is one of the best beers I've had in a long, long time.

How could I not start with a 120?  A: Deep golden amber, thin white head that dissipates to a ring quickly. If it was a girl, I'd call it pretty. It looks pretty. Weird, but whatever this is an amazing beer.  S: Hops, but not the usual hop smell. This is hops packed in candy. A sweetness that is unusual in beer. This almost smells crystallized. Crystallized hops.  T: Smooth, sweet hoppiness. Not overwhelming at all. A slight citrus flavor, backed up by sweetness. I can't taste any alcohol, except perhaps for a brief hint at the mid-throat level. 40 proof? Completely hidden.  M: The carbonation is light, but it still feels like silk. Yum.

10099,9086,bsoakley,4.7,"dogfish head is a favorite of mine in general. do i like every beer they make? i would be lying if i answered yes. however, where as i dont love all of them thru and thru, i do respect and love their attitude to experiment and adventure with their beer. they really put their money where their mouth is and you have to respect that.  the 120 i have had was on tap. i have had it twice so far. once at the actual brewery where they were serving an oak aged version and now at julians. at julians it doesnt say that it is the oak aged but i have a very stron suspicion that it is indeed the same beer.  first off, its a twenty percenter so prepare to have ONE and surely do it on a full stomach. It has a nice amber color with a faint head more similar to a cider, as in barely but a few bubbles on top.  the smell is amazing. floral. hoppy. alcoholly.  the taste is surreal. very complex like an expensive wine that occasionally reminds you that you do indeed like wine. the chain of flavors is perfectly segregated but blended so well and smoothly. first you taste the bitter, the hops, the spring like floral powder. then you get the grapefruit and citrus sweetness. lastly a dry oaky finish. really a wild ride. so smooth. so smooth that although you do feel the alcohol you barely notice it while you are drinking despite how strong it is on the nose initially.  obviously not something to drink everyday but you must at least once treat yourself to this delicious brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

10099,9086,cnally,4.6,"Here before me, a 120 Minute IPA. Bottled in '03. The beer poured a great looking very light head. The coloring was a dark amber-brown with some orange hints when held up to light.  The smell was very floral and fruity. The aromatics consisted of apricot, peach, and honey.  The taste of the beer continues on this apricot trend. In addition, there are elements of mango, and more honey. There is a pretty significant malt flavor as well. The alcohol, which is a major talking point about this beer, is well hidden through the drinking, but rises up a bit during the aftertaste.  The texture of this beer is more like wine than beer. Thick, sticky, sweet, and a numbing due to the alcohol. I feel like I have a sterilized tongue, then someone comes in with a flavor injection.  As far as drinkability, obviously you wouldn't want to have more than one. In fact, I had to wait till the next day to write the review. However, for the punch that this beer packs, it hides the alcohol taste well, and it is highly enjoyable and is a highly drinkable brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,ndekke39,3.68,"Bought a 12 oz. bottle of this at a grocery store in Portland, Oregon, and brought it home to Ohio. Decanted into a white wine glass (tall sides, nice and open).  It looks just like apple cider: cloudy brownish-red, with a thin rim of white lace. It's delicious - makes me look forward to fall.  The first thing I notice with my nose in the glass is a sharp twang of alcohol, followed by a bunch of strong sweet, fruity notes. It smells like apple cider spiked with brandy or rum. Strong sugar notes, too: brown sugar and molasses. Can't detect a hit of the hops.  The taste is dominated by the alcohol and sweet notes as well. Begins with a big cut of alcohol, then again the brown sugar, apples, molasses, and a general boozy sense kick in. There's some bitterness in the finish, like apple skins, although there is a bitter herbal hoppiness in the aftertaste. For something marketed as ""The Imperial India Pale Ale,"" I expected more of this off-the-hook hoppiness, when instead I'm getting strong boozy characteristics. This honestly reminds me of DFH's Raison D'extra more than the 60 or 90 Minute IPAs.  Mouthfeel is pretty thick, again like a heavy cider. Seems a good complement to the bold flavors.  You have to drink this slowly because of the high, high alcohol and the overt sweetness.

10099,9086,beerthulhu,4.32,"A: Poured a medium burnt caramel-orange with a thin, creamy light beige head that had some orange hues to it. The head diminished rather quickly while the lacing was clean. Visible carbonation was light.  S: The nose was very sweet, with pungent pink grapefruit with sugary notes and a beautiful floral aroma. Some tangerines and sweet pine also are detected rounding out the aroma which was very nice.  T: The initial flavor was pungent pink grapefruit with a big sugary sweetness and floral hoppiness. There was some tangerines, sweet caramel and sweet pine resin also detected. A sticky caramel and sweet grapefruit hop lacing is found on the finish with only a slight alcohol awareness of the massive 20% abv. which is beautifully masked by the huge sweet malting and citrusy sweet hopping. The finish finds a dry floral, pine hopping and a beautiful balance of sweet caramel malts and hops that simply has to be experienced by oneself.  M: The mouthful is oily, thick and viscose with sticky sweet grapefruit and pine resin and caramel with a dry flora bitterness on the fade. There is a spicy alcohol nature upon warming but is very subdued considering the 20% abv.  D: Amazing drinkability, hardly any detection of the massive 20% abv nature which could be dangerous. A monster ipa that was beautifully crafted and balanced. Needless to say one should be plenty enough for an evenings enjoyment. Comes highly recommended and worthy of its price per pound.

I was thinking this would either be too sticky and sugary sweet per the other reviews, or just a massive hop bomb by nature, but its something completely different.  Yes, it's sweet, and yes, it's sticky. But it's not overboard on either. Definitely a slow drinker, not a whole lot of aroma to my bottle, but the aging seems to have mellowed out the profile.  Much more drinkable than I thought. Some lingering hop resin on the tongue late, not as much as I expected but about as bad as I've had just the same.

S- First thing that hits is an alcohol sting. But there is a huge fruity sweetness. Orangy.  T- Very fruity up front, finishes with a burnt sugar quality that reminds me so much of the burnt outer coating of a roasted marshmallow that has caught a bit on fire. As it warms up its just so amazingly sweet. I'm thinking the sweetness is really coming from the alcohol+hops and not so much underattenuated malt, although it could be some that.  M- at first there was a lot of fine carbonation in it, like minuscule bubbles. It's actually very good carbonation for the type of drink this is.  I thought I could only take my first 3 oz pour of it, since it was so sweet, but I've gone back for a 2nd pour. I really like this much better at fridge temp, cause when it warms up it gets way too sweet for me.

Very little carbonation but more than I thought with the ABV. 4.0  D: This is a once in a while/once in a lifetime beer. It is ok, but nothing worth $10 a 12oz bottle.

10099,9086,KeefD,3.35,"Is there any reason why this one has a clever warning symbol painted on the cap?  Poured into my Duvel tulip glass, a very dark amber color with light foam that settled into a thin cap, only to disappear completely very quickly. A quick swirl of the glass brings the foam back, and some nice carbonation is is created from the laser etching in the glass. Upon taking a big whiff of this thing, it's surprising not all hops and no malt. In fact it's the opposite. First hit is of strong, warming alcohol, followed by big bready malts, and then the floral, piney hop smell.  Good lord, what have I gotten myself into? This is the most extreme beer I've ever tasted. It's VERY sweet. Almost too sweet for a DIPA. I don't know if I could consider it that, as it's more along the lines of a barley wine. Maybe they should create a new category just for this beer known as TIPA (Triple India Pale Ale).  Malts are very present, lots of caramel flavor, very bready and thick. Hops are a mega-blast of resinous hop oil, slightly fruity, but mostly sweet with lots of candied-sugar and maple syrup flavors. Alcohol warming is deep and very present.  Mouthfeel is thick, chewy, very full-bodied - syrupy. There's somewhat average carbonation by the look, but very hard to feel on the tongue.  Obviously this is a one-off beer only. There's no way I could drink more than one in a sitting and not lose my head. Alcohol is just way to high and it's WAY too sweet.  I'm not sure what to think about this one.

10099,9086,chuckd123,3.97,"Big IPA fan as well as huge DFH fan, so trying the 120 was a must. But.. holy crap this thing is intense.  Poured from a 12oz bottle (purcahsed at a Whole Foods of all places for about $12 I believe) into a goblet. First impression, just watching it pour - was that the stuff has the consistency of syrup. I knew going into it that at 21% this was going to be in a league of its own and nothing like DFH's other IPA's, and that was a severe understatement.  No doubt DFH set out to create the most extreme IPA they could, and I guess you could say it's a success in that regard.  After pouring, I took a whiff and it's a little hard to describe. It actually smells thick and syrupy -- with the hops right in your face. There's a fruity/floral smell mixed with the hops, but the hops hit you right away -- and oddly, it actually smells syrupy if that makes any sense.  The taste is like no other beer I've ever tried. If I didn't know it was an iteration of an IPA, I probably wouldn't have guessed that it was. If you're thinking -- well, I like theiri 60 min, and the 90 is good too -- well know that this thing bears little resemblance to either of those.  Needless to say, drinkability is hindered by the abv%, one bottle of this is something you'd want to enjoy slowly. The taste grows on you substantially from the first sip to the last.  If you call yourself a hophead, give it a try - at least once.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,lbkornlb14,3.94,"The infamous 120 minute IPA definitely holds its weight, kinda thick. I love the dogfish head brewery and IPA's, so this was a must try for me, at 21% abv, I was impressed with the taste. However that being said, for the average beer drinker it is semi too much, most non beer enthusiasts will make a face if you let them try or smell it, It is a must try for all IPA lovers but ill stick with the more drinkable 60, or 90.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,StonyB,3.91,"Now here's a beer I have wanted to try for a while. Barcade, I salute you, thanks for tapping this...  Appearance - Thick, viscous, cloudy, almost chunky. Looks a lot like old-school apple cider. No head, a thin coating. Unusual, to say the least, though not unappealing.  Smell - Pungent. Real strong aroma of paint thinner. Tangerine, a bit of hops, and a whole bunch o' alcohol.  Taste - Oh my. Sweet, sweet, sweet liquer. Tart apples, toffee, floral and citric hops, bubblegum, oak. A potpourri of flavors here, amazingly complex.  Mouthfeel - Chalky feel, almost powdery. Thick. Quite acidic.  Drinkability - This really depends upon your definition. Incredibly complex with a 21% ABV, versus a tasty and interesting beer that seems to get better with each sip. You make the call.  Leave it to Dogfish Head to not push but eviscerate the boundaries. 120 Minute IPA is unique, and a must try.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,GatorBeerNerd,4.33,"A: Pours a cloudy orange that doesn't let much light through at all. An aggressive pour resulted in a very minimal amount of head that disappears quickly down to a small ring. The ring stays all the way down since tiny bubbles come up from the bottom constantly to keep it around. The small ring of foam does leaves a sheet of lacing behind as it is consumed.  S: Hops, hops, and more hop aroma. They have a sweet citrus aroma. I really do not pick up anything else in the aroma. I like the hop aroma, but there are many in the style that are more complex and pleasing.  T: The hops and alcohol attack the mouth as soon as it crosses the lips. The two go hand in hand to make the mouth tingle just a bit feeling almost astringent in nature. It is in some ways similar to a Belgian style beer, but with a ton of alcohol and a ton of hops at the start. As it starts to warm, more of a malt backbone starts to come through. The affect of the alcohol and malt in the taste start to subside. It then reminds me of some of the better barleywines with a bitter after taste kick from the hops that many of those do not have in such high concentrations. This beer is like a chameleon constantly changing. Thank goodness I got two of these even if it set me back $8.50 a piece for a 12 oz.  M: A very thick creamy mouthfeel. The hops and alcohol make it have almost a very tingly sensation in the mouth. It is a very interesting and unusual experience.  D: I struggles a bit with how to rank this one for drinkability. Its a HUGE beer so obviously you can't knock it back unless you want it to return the favor. It is a bit of a sipper, but for the style it is very drinkable. It makes you want to come back for the next sip to see what new thing you notice.  This may not have ended up ranking as one of my favorites, but it was surely one of the most amazing experiences I have had drinking beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

A: Pours a dark amber- darker than any IPA I've ever seen. Hardly any light comes through- again, strange for the style, but in a positive way. An agressive pour yielded a one finger whitish head.  S: Smells of citrusy hops, not much else (and since I'm a hophead, this is a good thing).  T: Hmm. I was expecting an atomic hop bomb, not quite what I got. The hops are very present, sure, but a strong, almost barleywine-like malt presence as well, and alcohol. (I know, I know, it's 21%, but I've had beers from DFH in the 18-20% range that hide their alcohol presence quite well.)  M: Thick, syrupy mouthfeel, which I like, but the carbonation and the alcohol burn are a tad much IMO.  D: It's 21%. Need I say more?  I'm really glad I got a chance to try this one, but I'm not sure I'd buy it again, especially given the price. Perhaps I'll age the other bottle and see what that does, but as it stands I prefer the 90 and even the 60 minute varieties.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Carbonation is present and sticks to the sides of the glass. Smell is in your face hops, pine and candy sweetness. This is a beer you have to sip. It's amazing how this beer can be so incredibly sweet, yet bitter hops shine through at the same time. Delicious.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,sevopie,4.66,"Appearance - Heavily clouded burnt orange in color with a creamy white head. It maintains a solid amount of head all the way through, and you can see the carbonation lacing the sides of the glass on its way up.  Smell - Sweet hops smell surprisingly with some raisins/figs in there. Also a bit of a caramel malt smell. The smell is a bit underwhelming, especially considering how loaded this one is.  Taste - If I didn't know any better, I'd think I was drinking a hoppy version of the Raison D'Extra. It really does feel like a Belgian with hops thrown in, although this accomplishes it so much better than other examples I have had. The things that really jump out are the raisin/fig flavor again, hops entering in slightly thereafter, and finishing with caramel and alcohol. There's a few other fruit flavors floating around on the tongue as well.  Mouthfeel - Perfect. It doesn't need explaining.  Drinkability - Even with the reviews I had read, I was still expecting a hop bomb. Once I get past the fact that this is more of a treat than a true DIPA... it becomes apparent how well made it is. The alcohol is so well masked that I am having trouble believing this is anywhere near 21%. I truly could sip on this to the end of eternity, it has a fantastic blend of everything I would look for in a great beer... I love Belgians and I love IPAs, and it really feels like the perfect blend of the 2.

10099,9086,JayQue,4.02,"Unusual experience, much different than I expected. Poured a golden/amber color, cloudy with a surprisingly (for the abv) big head, although this would be a small head for a more reasonable octane beer. Smell is hops and caramel.  I was expecting a hops bomb, backed up by a too sweet and burning alcohol taste. Happily surprised that this was not the case. This tasted more like an English Barleywine (JW Lees) with a hops factor added in. Granted, I had imbibed a few other beers including SN Southern Hemisphere Fresh Hops first, but I did not see this as a grit your teeth drinking experience.  There was caramel, fruit, hops, malt and some alcohol taste - overall very pleasant but not something you would slam down in quantity.  Mouthfeel is rich and creamy, the alcohol does not affect the mouthfeel or the taste in any negative way. How do you rate drinkability on a 21 percent beer? I split the 12 oz bottle and had a satisfying amount. Compared to other DIPAs drinkability is average. I will probably get another one to taste so I don't have the fresh hops on my palate and tongue first.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

It was very mouthy (clinged to the side of my mouth for a long time) and was very distinctive.  ABV is said to at or about 18% but I think it was higher and the label state that it can be laid down for a time only to get a higher ABV.

10099,9086,BuckeyeNation,4.38,"Bottled: October 2007. Bronze-like orange peel with blazing bonfire borders when backlit with sunshine. I'm amazed to see such a great looking head. The upper half of my crystal snifter is filled with a beauteous dollop of light brown sugar colored cream that is leaving plenty of glass coverage. So much for the theory that alcohol is a lid and lace killer.  Despite the EXTREME nature of the beer, the aroma is no different than the aromas of many lower-ABV DIPAs. Sure, there's a bit more alcohol, but at least it doesn't smell like solvent. I'm not disappointed that it isn't over-the-top hoppy because I knew it wouldn't be. Let's go with grapefruit and orange rind macerated in white rum.  One thing is obvious right off the bat: 120 Minute IPA is unique beer (a Dogfish Head specialty). It's also good beer if one has the right attitude going in. Using a snifter, drinking it barely cool and taking small, whiskey-sized sips is the way to go.  One of my initial impressions is how well-hidden the alcohol is. There is plenty of 10.0% beer that's boozier and hotter than this. Kudos to Sam for having the chops to pull it off in such remarkable fashion. Of course, it helps immensely if you're used to drinking 100-proof bourbon neat.  I decided to review this relatively fresh bottle and let my 2005 bottle age a little bit longer because I wanted to get the maximum impact out of the hops. Now that I've tasted it, I'll definitely be on the lookout for a superfresh bottle. Despite the absolutely insane amount of hopping, the beer is sweeter than it is bitter. Thankfully, the hops provide much more flavor than the pale malt. Think Cointreau mixed with 90 Minute IPA. Orange is clearly the dominant fruit on the taste buds.  The mouthfeel is superb as well. It's full, no question about it, but I've had barleywines that were more thick, sappy and gooey. The secret to keeping things from bogging down must be a perfect amount of carbonation. All things considered, the mouthfeel is brewing craftsmanship par excellence.  Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA is anything but a typical DIPA. In truth, I didn't expect to like it as much as I do. This is one of those cases in which extreme beer is also incredibly good beer. Even though I won't be drinking it often, I'm now a huge fan and will spring for a bottle or two on those rare occasions when I run across them. The bottom line is that this is delicious and surprisingly drinkable hop liqueur.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Buebie,4.83,"Purchased this bottle from Casanovas in Hudson WI today. I also have one cellaring from '06 and have wanted to try this, but was reluctant to crack the '06 bottle.  Poured from a 12pz bottle into a snifter. Head is white, light and fluffy, 2 fingers deep off a rigerous pour. Hazy amber in color. Retention is medium, little to no laceing.  Big peach marmalade smell, alcahol fumieness, to be expected off a 20+ % beer. Some grassy floral hop aroma, a bit of bready malt, but mostly overwhelmed by marmalade and alcahol. Smells delicious.  Holy bang me! This is one huge flavored beer! (This was my actual reaction to tasting it) I've come to the conclusion that I'm not worthy of reviewing this beer. But I'll do my best.  Bittering hops with a yeasty bread tone, some dme/ malty wheat like quality. Sour mash alcahol with a grapefruit zing through the middle and a good dose of carbonation. Lemon zest mixed with the strongest white wine like flavor. All through this sour and sweet do a happy dance on my tounge, finishing dry with a hop linger and alcahol warming. Maybe some champagne like flavor qualities?  I'm still not sure exactly what I tasted, that was awsome....  Mild syrup like feel, mostly dry in a champagne like similarity in texter.

I love how DFH puts that on the bottle! Oh how I wish ALL beers from ALL breweries showed the bottling date. Kudos to DFH!  This 120 pours a cloudy amber with small head, but with a small head/ring which continues to stick around. To be honest, it's just not very appealing in appearance. The aroma is more interesting, but it's a bit weird too. There's a strong citrusy (grapefruity/rine-y) aroma, but also a slight stinky (feet?) character. It's certainly an odd mix.  The flavor pretty much backs up the aromas, but expands on them in every direction. In many ways, the flavors are similar to DFH's 60 or 90, but on overdrive. I swear, DFH has a house character which shows up (mostly) in their hoppy brews. Unfortunately (for me), it's a characteristic which I'm not all that excited about, but seems to be very popular with most other people. Whatever the case, I certainly respect DFH and all the envelope-pushing brews they make...including this brew. This is not one of my personal favorite uber-hoppy brews, but there's no denying that it's one of the most idiosyncratic hoppy brews ever brewed!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

The taste is sweet and full of citrus notes, mostly tangerine with a bit of grapefruit tartness balancing the sweetness slightly. Lots of alcohol warming from the lips to the stomach, but not much alcohol flavor it's over powered entirely by the malty sweetness and wonderful hop flavors.  This beer is very thick and heavy. Unlike anything I have tried.  This is a big boy beer no dought. If you don't drink 10% + beers on a regular basis this will knock you out.

Very fresh hop smell, got me all excited about the fist sip, but...  Taste was very underwhelming. Over sweet, almost sickly-sweet. I can understand this in a stout, but in an IPA it seems very out of place. It was hard to pinpoint any other flavors. I'll admit my palatte isn't fine-tuned, but it was hard with the one-dimensional There was no discernable alcohol taste, which is amazing considering the reported 21% abv. I just really wish they would cut back on the malt a bit to lessen some of the sweet taste. Really this could go on pancakes and be acceptable as a syrup. Mouthfeel was pretty good. Carbonation was right on target, but it was hard to leave it on my tongue for more than a moment due to the pervasive sweetness.  Overall drinkability I am rating low because this is really a special beer. I can see someone enjoying this after dinner *sipping SLOWLY* but other than that it's hard to imagine a situation where I'd be really enjoying this.

10099,9086,GilGarp,3.78,"This is one that I have wanted to try for quite a while. I enjoyed both 60 and 90 so this seemed the next logical step.  Twelve ounce bottle is dated January of 2008. Pours a beautiful red color with nice fluffy head that seems to grow like something living even after visible bubbles have reached the top. It quickly wanes and soon appears to be not carbonated at all.  Not the hoppy aroma I was expecting. In fact, it's more sweet, fruity, and musky. I really wanted to to be incredibly full of fresh hops and all that goodness but it's not.  Taste is totally unexpected. Surprisingly sweet but also bitter. It really reminds me more of a port than a beer. In the beer world, I might say an imperial barley wine.  Mouthfeel is very smooth but drinkability is obviously hindered by the ABV. I think 120 minute is really a suggestion of how this one should be consumed. I started it almost 2 hours ago and still have 1/3 left.  This is possibly the most inappropriately labeled beverage I've ever had. It's certainly not an imperial india pale ale by any definition in my book.

They did this IPA near wonderfully, and I had no hint of the 21%ABV. It just stuck me as a normal 8-9%ABV beer. Then I looked at the bottle and hardly believed it. That is what makes this an excellent beer.  M - It was very sharp in the taste area and crisp because of the light nature of the beer. It is a nice summer bitter beer.

Appearance: Hazy, amber color, small head, that doesn't stick around too long. Leaves a ring of head around the glass and some lacing.  Smell: Sugary, (maybe honey) and alcohol, with a bit of citrus and pineapple. Not too pleasant, too sweet smelling.  Taste: Very sweet, some pineapple, citrus and caramel malt, then the hops and alcohol. If you leave in your mouth for for more than a few seconds the alcohol becomes very apparent, otherwise it is well masked.  Mouthfeel: Almost syrupy at first, but it has the perfect amount of carbonation that comes through after passing midway over the tongue.  Drinkability: It is drinkable, but I started drinking at my normal pace and had to slow down when I started started feeling a good buzz (after having a few other beers.) I probably wouldn't want to drink more than 2 of these in one sitting.  Overall, it is good, not great. From the self proclaimed ""Holy grail of hopheads"" I was pretty disappointed, the flavor of the hops was overwhelmed by the sweetness, and the hops flavor that came through just mixed into the alcohol taste. I like most DFH beers, but this was waaay too sweet for me; I suspect this was to help cover the alcohol. For an Imperial IPA, I would take a Bell's Hopslam, or 90 Minute over this any day.

Pours a slightly cloudy amber-orange color with a paper thin beige head. Amazingly with the alcohol content this thin foam layer persists throughout the snifter. No lacing as expected.  Just a huge, complex and unusual aroma profile running the gauntlet from Sugar Daddy caramel candy, American ""C"" hop resins and sinus clearing ethanol to leather, bourbon, cedar and ripe red apples.  Palate is quite full and pleasantly slick for such a strong brew. Just the right touch of CO2 is subtely perceived.  Flavors much like the nose; a bit all over the place and distracting but so unique you can't help but admire it.

Finally grabbed a 12oz bottle for more than I care to admit, but I'm excited all the same.  Pops crisply and pours a very cloudy very orange. Little head, but lots of individual bubbles. Poured into a nice big bordeaux glass. Hey - a beer this big gets the special treatment.  Smell is almost eye-wateringly boozey, even cold. Hops, hops, more hops, lots of grapefruit, a little pineapple. Warm notes have a character like amaretto.  Taste is a smack of hops, but far sweeter than I expected. Mild cedar, some lemon rind, more pineapple. Goes from fruity to being more herbal/salty as it warms. Alphas abound. Pear when very warm - like they've been stewed in white wine. Lemon curd. So malty that it almos suggests oaking, but more likely that's the roasty character of all that barley.  Feels, as expected, warm on the lips. The oils actuall cling to them so after each sip you can lick them and get even more taste. Dry, though not exceptionally clean on the tongue, but not cloying in the least. Chalky if anything.  What a brew. This one was exactly as described - hop vodka with a hint of malt. Whereas the 90 minute is only 50% more exciting than the 60 minute, the 120 minute is about 10 times the beer the 90 is. Not you every day drinker, but if you like hops, you owe this one to yourself.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

T - Very interesting balance of hop bite, alcohol, and a hint of malty sweetness. The alcohol/hop combo is a very unique taste and the sweetness provides just the right balance.  M/D - Full bodied with good carbonation. It is a little hot with the alcohol, bit overall a very good feel. Doesnt taste like it is 21%. An excellent beer for ending the night.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,rye726,4.32,"2004 vintage:4.8 2007 vintage:  I don't know what to call this unique brew. Possibly more towards a hoppy strong ale than a double IPA. Either way, it is quite good.  120 pours a nice medium brown and holds a silky beige head with decent lacing. Quite impressive considering the ABV.  The nose has aromas of big sweet candy malt and complex alcohols balanced by a bouquet of citric hops.  At 4 years old this has mellowed out nicely. The alcohol has been quieted and the flavors have really blended together. There are the fruity citrus hops up front that meld into creamy rich malts by the finish. There is also a good amount of matured sweet alcohols through out.  Creamy full body has good crisp yet delicate carbonation to keep it active. Amazingly drinkable for the strength. Another impressive creation from DFH. Makes me want to try more of their premium brews.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,far333,3.7,"Served in a tulip glass. Slightly opaque apricot colored with a thin orangey head that requires a vigorous pour to rise up, and then settles out quickly.  Vaporous aroma of cinnamon and ripe fruit, brown sugar and sweet citrus.  Flavor of orange liqueur, boozy and brandyesque. Big malts emerge followed by an alcohol warmth, and some grapefruit rind spiciness and bitterness. Grainy sweet malts linger. Not as hoppy as I expected.  Fairly full mouthfeel, warm, tingly on the tip of the tongue and cheeks.  Pretty drinkable for its bigness, obviously not a session beer, but I expected more hops. Good sipper, it's almost a sipping liqueur.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,BretSikkink,4.27,"Just days after trying my first bottle, I find this beast on tap at Papago.  Super-attractive appearance, just a lovely double IPA: orange, creamy looking head, chill-hazed. The aroma is very strong; it blew away another massively hopped double IPA. The hops are so pungent that it's almost like smelling mustard seeds, just very potent and amazing.  Seems a little hoppier in the mouth than the bottle did, with a little less of the sweetness from the malt. It's still terribly difficult to drink, with a ton of booziness, but the 120 Minute is a truly incredible experience.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,GJ40,3.2,I've wanted to try this for quite some time and last night I finally got my chance. I love the work that Dogfish Head does (especially the 90 Minute IPA) but this one was a bit over the top for me. I found the alcohol overwhelming. I love beer but I don't enjoy hard alcohol and this one felt like a big glass of the hard stuff so it wasn't my thing. I'll just go back to the 90 Minute and save Dogfish Head the extra time.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,hdofu,4.64,"Finally got a bottle of 120 minute ipa... Wow.... this stuff is intense...  The color is a dirty orangeish brown with la thin white head. Smell is of tangerines and pine. The taste is intensely of apricots, even moreso then aprihop which is weird since that is actually made with apricots with an intense bitter hoppy finish. The mouthfeel is slick with an incredible alcohol burn. This is a beer I wouldn't mind again but there is no way this could ever qualify as a session beer... Way too strong for that.  Anyway between 60, 90 and 120 minute ipas, the 90 stands out as my favorite as it is more intense and flavorful then the 60 minute ipa, but the 120 minute ipa is almost too intense for everyday.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,ChainGangGuy,3.93,"2007 Vintage.  Appearance: Pours a clear, amber body with a tight inch of off-white foam. Impressive that it can even form and sustain a head with all that booze in there.  Smell: Whoo! Even upon opening you get a whiff of alcohol-soaked hops. Very apricoty, maybe a few golden raisins. Leafy and tremendously resiny hop character and, of course, an excessive, though exciting amount of fusel alcohol.  Taste: Whoo-boy!! Ultra sweet, incredibly juicy apricot taste. Searing alchol presence upon that first sip, but give it some time, friends, that'll pass. Sharp flavors of ruby red grapefruit citrus oils and pine resin. Still, though, I get alot of apricot. All of the high levels of malt, hops, and alcohol push and shove each other around without letting one quality sit on the tongue for too long. The grapefruit and apricot come together, become morphed, and start tasting of mango and passion fruit.  Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium-low carbonation. Sticky yet also pretty warming.  Drinkability: A sipper, for sure, but a good one. Really holds itself together fairly well for being packed to the gills with malt, hops, and booze. Like it or not, it's hard not to be having a good time when you finish the bottle.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

T - Very hoppy with pine and citrus notes. But this beer is dominated by hops. Aftertaste you feel the alcohol of this beer.  M - Very clean and crisp tasting.

10099,9086,DavoleBomb,4.52,"Poured into a pint glass. I have a tulip, but I didn't have it with me at the time, dammit.  4.0 A: Rich orange amber in color. Quarter inch head.  4.5 S: Somewhat woody, caramel. Sweetness is there for sure. You can smell the alcohol, but not nearly as much would be expected from a 21% beer.  4.5 T: Hardly bitter, unexpected from an IPA. Sweetness comes through. Alcohol isn't overpowering at all. Woodiness very apparent. Otherwise delicious, very delicious.  4.0 M: For a 450 calorie beer, it feels lighter than expected, but still very rich. My mouth feels happy, but not ecstatic.  5.0 D: I think I could easily drink another and enjoy it just as much. For that and the alcohol content, this is an exceptional drink. One of most drinkable beers I've ever had.  I'd have to say that this is a great beer, but not worth the $9.00 pricetag per bottle. One day when I have more money, it won't be a big deal, but right now it is (college student). I would recommend Dogfish's Palo Santo brown ale if you want a high flavor beer that's less hard-hitting on the wallet.  Dogfish head seems like it can do no wrong.

Candied fruits: pineapples, grapefruits, mangoes, apricots, etc., etc. I could smell this beer all day.  Very sweet and not bashful in alcohol either. Taste is primarily of sweet candied tropical fruits and a slight toffee-like malt.  Full-bodied with a long sticky finish.  I am a lover of hops and this was even a little tough for me. A definite nightcap.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Grapefruit. Blood oranges.  The taste was a tad alcoholic. It is quite overwhelming at first. It was really sweet like eating a piece of candy. I think you only have a few drinks to take your notes because the senses loose touch with reality quite quickly.  While it was really in your face with the abv, it maintained a smoothness to it. After I finish I know there will be no taste buds left till tomorrow to rate a beer. Definitely one and done. It was smooth on the tongue but it burned the roof and the sides.  Overall not a bad beer and worth trying but I probably won't buy it again due to the extreme cost for the return.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,hopheadsal,4.95,"Nose on the beer is increadible. Smells like fresh hops! Thouroughly enjoyed kicking back and sipping out of a snifter.

A: Pours a cloudy, amber body with a nice, white head with excellent retention and excellent lacing along the sides of the glass all the way to the finish.  S: Smelled a little sweet and fairly malty. Not too much of a hop presence noted in the smell.  T: A very strong alcoholic taste. Any note of malts and hops were overpowered by the high alcohol content of this beer. While most people find this beer appealing because of it, I feel that it takes away from the overall enjoyment of the brew.  M: A very good, smooth and silky mouthfeel that was very pleasant and went down easy.  D: This beer would be a whole lot better if the high alcohol content was not as evident in the taste. I understand that 21% is ridiculously high and that it would be a challenge to mask it, but the alcohol content needs to be hidden a little bit in order to truly enjoy the greatness of this beer.

The aroma is surprisingly subdued - caramel malts, fruits, spicy hops and a little alcohol.  The flavor is strong sweet sugary malts, some fruits (melon and fig) and some alcohol and a touch of hops in the finish. The alcohol is noticeable but I'd never guess this was 20%. It is warming in the tummy though and does become a bit harsh as it warms. The mouthfeel is medium to full and with smooth carbonation.  Overall, an interesting beer. The alcohol is surprisingly not dominating, but it is cloyingly sweet and the hops are not that noticeable. The alcohol gets balanced well by the sweetness of the beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,DunesBrewer,4.67,"The second time around on this beer since last summer and it is still amazing. Opened a 12 ounce bottle late one night and was totally blown away. It is a hazy beer from excessive dry-hopping and long term bottle conditioning. But it is that good, heavy type of haze, more intriguing than a poor chill haze turn-off. The smell is amazing: hops, hops, and plenty of booze hit the nose square as the beer is held. One can open a bottle of this in a wide room and everyone will smell it without putting it up to their nose. Slight vanilla undertones to the massive floral hop notes in the nose of this beer. Also, slightly sweet in the nose, I'm not sure how to describe it, but the beer is definitely not all hops. The taste is I feel described above: massively hoppy and boozy, yet strangely tempered into a hazy brew, easy to drink. Mouthfeel is actually a big thin; makes me wonder what they left out of this beer. Probably nothing; probably I'm a Russian Imperial Snob, but for such a heavy duty beer I was a bit dissapointed. Of course, drinkability is phenomenal. If this beer was produced ""en masse,"" we'd be a community of drunks. Defintely one of my favorite beers.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Goliath,3.12,"Pours a very hazy, opaque orange/amber color with a thin layer of slightly yellowed head. Head has very poor retention and leaves no lacing.  Aroma is very nice. A strong hop presence, with a sort of citrus/pine combination that's kind of funky. Also a bit of alcohol present, which isn't surprising at 21%abv.  The taste is interesting. Not really what I was hoping for. The hoppiness is extremely low, at least for what I expected. It's sort of sweet with a mild citrusy hop, and a lot of alcohol warmth. Actually, alcohol is pretty much all I taste. It was way overdone! Although a lot of people don't like to age DIPA's, I think I would go ahead and throw this on in the cellar.  Mouthfeel is full bodied and syrupy with a subtle carbonation bite.  Drinkability is low. Alcohol is ridiculously high and the flavor isn't really that great. Again, I'd like to see what it does with a few years on it. Don't judge my low rating too harshly. it just doesn't seem appropriate for the style.

10099,9086,BucBasil,4.44,"Pretaste Notes: This is the famed 120 Minute IPA. I've been trying to find this for a while, and I finally got my hands on one the other day. It says on the label that the beer ""ages well,"" and that one can lay this beer down for ""about a decade."" However, I'm moving out of the country and will probably be unable to cellar it in one place for any extended amount of time, so I will go for it now. After all, it does say on the label that it is perfectly OK to ""enjoy now""  Appearance: Poured from the 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. The bottle is very classy looking, simple and clean, with a painting of a hop displayed above the logo. Told how it's made on the side of the peach colored paper label. The beer is a bright orange with shades of red. After a hard pour, the beer achieved a little less than 2 fingers worth of off-white head with little retention.  Smell: A great introduction to this beer experience. The huge hop aroma is noticeable from over a foot away. After swirling the glass, a surprisigly fruity aroma rises from beneath the immense piney and citrus-smelling hops. For a beer this hoppy, the sweet smell was not expected but definitely not unwelcome. Surprising balance, while still preparing you for the hop bomb that is sure to follow.  Taste: Huge flavor, even from the smallest of sips. Interestingly, there is a huge amount of balance as well. The beer starts out with an unexpected maltiness of all things, leading into a sweet berry fruitiness. Then the hops just take over everything. Spreading to every corner of the mouth and throat, citrusy flavors of orange and grapefruit fade in and out of the immense bitterness, along with a big sprucy pine flavor. The beer finishes with a big alcohol dryness that wasn't unexpected that leaves the toungue tingling and a slight burn in the throat, along with the lingering flavor of fruit and of course the ever-present hop.  Mouthfeel: Thick in the mouth with an unmistakeable alcohol tingle and burn. The sensation left in the mouth after swallowing is a little sticky and oily, as if I just swallowed some tree sap. Delicious, sweet and hoppy tree sap. However, the alcohol comes through and dries everything up.  Drinkability: One. Is. More. Than. Enough. This was one to take extremely slowly, lasting me about an hour to take in the whole thing. The beerevolves as it warms, and the flavors become more intense and pronounced as it reaches room temperature.  Notes: My first experience with this near-legendary beer was a good one. If I can find it a couple more I'd really like to lay them down for a while to see how the flavors evolve over time. Unfortunately, as I previously mentioned, I don't think I'll be able to do that for a while. However, it was still quite the beer when fresh. Overall, this experience did not disappoint. Everything that I expected from such an intensely hopped beer, but also surprising in that I found sme balance and an underlying sweetness holding everything together. Truly, this was more than a drink... Rather a meditation on all things beer, an exercise for the tastebuds and a great opportunity for contemplating the good things in life. Definitely recommended",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,kinnaird,3.77,"Thanks to jessecarr for a great trade.  Pours fairly thick and builds an eggshell, half finger head before quickly receding into a ""barely there"" ring. When held up to the light, it's a bright orange and very clear.  I initially smell the hops, I think mainly because that's what I was looking for, but when I delve further into the bouquet of this beer, I smell hints of apple, orange, grapefruit, and rich, sugary syrup.  When wondering what this beer would taste like, prior to opening the bottle and taking in the complex smells, I expected something much hoppier. But, after taking a deep whiff, this is basically what I was expecting. All of the subtle fruit flavors come together as well as the richness I smelled. To me, this basically tastes like a huge barelywine. After the swallow, there's a bit of astringency but no hop bitterness to speak of. The sweetness of this really showcases itself after it warms up, and toward the end I found it a bit cloying.  I love a full bodied mouthfeel, and this certainly has it, but it's on the thinner side of the full body spectrum.  For what this beer is; something pushing the extremes of what beer can be, I think it's quite drinkable but at times cloying. I'd like to have a few more of these around for the occasional nightcap.

10099,9086,paco1029384756,4.45,"Orange brown pour with very little head and perfect lacing. Scent is massive with a sweet sugar scent up front with some malts and alcohol backing. A little deeper in the scent lies some citrus and blueberries with a hint of caramel and cinnamon. The taste is ridiculous, powerful sweetness with some alcohol initially, fades into a calm sugary sweetness with citrus and malts weaving through. Mouthfeel is slightly biting, but very smooth. Drinkability is pretty high, too high in fact. A perfect example of a dangerously drinkable beer.  08 bottle reviewed. I will definitely get this again, but I will try an older bottle to see what age does to it.  My favorite thing about this beer is the mouthfeel, and because of it's strength, if you hold it in your mouth, it takes over your senses.

Huge alcohol, fruit, whiskey/scotch notes, apple jack, brown sugar, herbal/medicinal hops, blood orange, flowers, grapefruit oil. So much going on here.  Mouthfeel is full but not syrupy, strong drying alcohol, tingling on the tongue, but not much carbonation. Obviously, you won't drink a lot, but it is very pleasant and not at all cloying.

No floral or grass-like aromas from all that dry-hopping.  T: Again does not really taste like an IPA. Very complex flavors, lots of alcohol, reminds me a lot of a tawny port or other fortified dessert wine. Sweet sugary flavors and dried fruits dominate. Finally some hop flavor at the end.  M: Very good mouthfeel. Syrupy, really coats the mouth. Bitterness kicks in a bit, but less than expected.  D: Definitely a sipping beer.

The taste had an ethabol bight like none other, and an enourmous presence of dextrins, with very little hop presence.  The body was decent, and had layers of flavors playing off of sherry, and scotch, or a fine brandy. However, this is not what I look for in an IPA.  It was very hard to finish, there was simply too much going on here, I really did not know what to make of it.

10099,9086,kurtissellen,5,"I finally decided it was time to crack this one open. I tried this beer once before, but that was before I became a BA. I credit this beer with enlightening me as to what beer could be and getting me into reviewing and sampling different beers. Well enough reminiscing...  Emptied bottle into oversized wine glass producing a fingers worth of light beige head that receded but never completely. Had a nice glowing orangish amber color to it with carbonation visible and left a fine lace all the way down the glass from the extremely tiny bubbles. Amazing sweet smell of white grape juice and figs. Sweet tastes of honey and maybe a little raisin or fig in there as well. This beer feels like it's just melting in you're mouth with all of the fine carbonation. I didn't even notice the hops at all until the end where I detected a mild hop bitterness. I don't know how they hide the huge amount of alcohol in this, maybe the sweetness masks some of it. Just as awesome as the first time I sampled this one, truly a great beer but not for the faint of heart and to be enjoyed single serving. Still don't understand how they can call this a double IPA it reminds me more of barleywine, I guess I don't care what they call it it's simply just an awesome brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,BeardedBoffin,3.17,"This is a beer on steroids in every dimension-sweetness, hops, and alcohol. The particular specimen at hand is a 12 ounce bottle served in a Chimay chalice. The beer is a cloudy dark copper orangish color with very little foam. Surprisingly, alcohol does not dominate the aroma, but it is detectable. Sugary sweetness is the primary fragrance, along with caramel apples and some piny hops. The beer is heavy and syrupy on the palate. A sugary sweetness tinged with apricots blows away the taste buds from the outset and doesn't let up. As the beer roils toward the gullet an oily piny hop flavor emerges followed by a significant alcohol warming all the way down. All aspects of the flavor profile linger, especially the alcohol. It would be difficult to toss back a large quantity of these. If the flavor overload doesn't get you, the alcohol will.  I really like the 90 minute IPA from Dogfish Head, but this one comes across as a bit too much, almost a gimmick. Every aspect is over the top. I don't think the flavors meld all that well, rather they come across as a collection individual flavors.

I wasn't sure if I'd like this one but it is quite good. It is very potent, with a clear taste of peach and apricot. The alcohol jumps out at you, and it has a bit if burn (almost like a mellow scotch). I needed to drink water every so often before proceeding.  M - Burns a bit, which is a bit unpleasant with the slight carbonation.  D - This is a weird one. On one hand, it smells and tastes great, but it hits very hard.

Smell: Plenty of noticeable alcohol from the start along with sharp resiny pine. Notes of ripe fruit are lingering underneath, bringing to mind oranges and apricots.  Taste: Caramel and overripe fruit. This stuff is intensely sweet. Undertones of Mandarin orange, apricot and mango. The hops don't stand a chance against the malt; pine and lemon rind-like bitterness are present but never quite break to the forefront. The alcohol is surprisingly hidden in the taste, though the slight burn in the finish makes it known that this is strong stuff.

I saved it for last, knowing it would kill the palate, but even sharing it w/2 others left me on my ass. A-Poured a thick copper w/slight haze and decent head that did not last. S-Cascade hops, sweet citrus, and apricot. T-Very sweet upfront, and the hit comes after about a second-hops and more hops, and typical hop characters like pine and citrus. It's actually quite good despite the texture. I was going to rate the taste lower, but the taste is fine...it's the mouthfeel that detracts rather than the flavor. M-Thick and syrupy, like I'm drinking a schnapps. D-An interesting experience. A great session brew for any raging alcoholic hophead with a sweet-tooth. Although I enjoyed sampling this one, it's a novelty item. I highly recommend trying it, but with friends, since you really don't want anymore once you're halfway down, and it's not cheap.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,praufs01,2.6,"Appearance - Dark ruby color with a creamy tan head.  Aroma - Alcohol, pine resin, and orange citrus smells.  Palate - Thick and syrupy.  Flavor - Sweet and sour up front followed by a sour orange and warm alcohol finish.  Final thoughts - Very medicinal, like drinking cough syrup. The alcohol was way over the top. Although it was interesting I didn't enjoy this brew at all.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,JToad,3.87,"I finally got around to reviewing this.  Pours a dark copper, with very little lacing and no head.  Smells of alchohol first, then citrus. Hops are so strong, that the alchohol masks the aroma.  Tastes, very sweet, syrupy. More of a barleywine IMHO. Alchohol overload.  Now I am a huge DFH fan, the 60 and 90 are two of my favorite brews. This is a once in a while, sipping brew, but could not be drank very often.

S- okay first thought was ""nail polish remover"" seriously, piney, flowers, but hoppy was not my reaction.  T- More like a strong barley wine, not an IPA. After the initial shock of alcohol, there was the comforting hop aftertaste. This beer reminds me of strong sherry-like wine.  M- Thick, very little carbonation (no bubbles in my Sam Adams glass) Strong alcohol, very warming.  D- Good to try once. Too strong for a session beer, and I wouldn't really consider it an IPA at all. Granted, I have tried strong IPAs, but this beer didnt give off a ton of hops to me. It tasted like a Barley wine crossed with Sherry wine. It really does smell like nail polish remover, that being said, MUCH too strong for me.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

This ""beer"" requires its own category and cannot be compared with any beer one normally meets. It is more potent than sherry and many aperitifs. The color is a pleasing warm golden brown, just a touch of carbonation. One if immediately taken by the smell that boils out of the glass: intense, aromatic, citrus peel, petrol and alcohol. Tiny sips reveal the potency but a very interesting sweet complex mixture of citrus and rind with some honey and a very potent hotness. it coats the mouth with oily suppleness and lingers for an age.  How do you really score this? If by drinkability you mean easy to quaff then this is not because of the intensity.

10099,9086,ebit,3.58,"Had on tap at the new Sugar Maple bar in Milwaukee. There is no way this beer should be considered an IPA.  Appearance Poured with a 3 finger offwhite head into a tulip glass. Deep orange/amber body (it was pretty dark so it was hard to evaluate the appearance).  Smell Lot of things in play here. Orange peel, coariander, some hops and a bit of astringent alcohol.  Taste What the hell is this? I can't figure out the style at all but it certainly doesn't fit in the IPA category. I get lemon, orange peel, with a pineapple syrup punch in the middle (or maybe sweet and sour sauce). Alcohol in the finish.  Mouthfeel Heaviest bodied IPA I've ever had. When the pineapple hits it literally feels like a syrup of sorts in your mouth. Not much in the way of carbonation.  Drinkability I'm a bit put off with how sweet and big the beer is and one is definitely enough (especially with the abv). If the sweetness was toned down a bit this could be a great beer, but my taste buds just took too long to recover from their immersion.

A: It poured a orangeish-gold syrupy body with a slight head that clung to the collar and did not support any lacing.  S: It was dominantly sweet and cirtrusy with an aroma not unlike a combination of dark brown sugar pared with bitter white grapefruit. Plenty of sweet malts and floral and citrus hops.  T: Dogfish like Stone know how to balance malts and high IBU beers. It started syrupy sweet then the sweetness was infused with citrus flavors including grapefruits, oranges and pineapples. It ended with a slight bite on the back side with a sweet and tart aftertaste.  M: It was a full-bodied brew with a syrupy stickiness that coated my mouth. It finished warm with a lingering sweet and tart after taste.  D: It was a sipper beer that did a tremendous job of packing in a mountain of hops along with an equal volume of sweet malts. It is not a ""session"" beer unless one bottle is the definition of a session.

10099,9086,Beertracker,4.32,"Commercial Desription: Too extreme to be called beer? Brewed to a colossal 45-degree plato, boiled for a full 2 hours while being continuously hopped with high-alpha American hops, then dry-hopped daily in the fermenter for a month & aged for another month on whole-leaf hops!!! Our 120 Minute IPA is by far the biggest IPA ever brewed! At 21% ABV & 120 IBU's you can see why we call this beer The Holy Grail for hopheads!  Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA pours up with ample carbonation that creates a low-moderate creamish-white head that sits ever so briefly atop a bright deep golden-ochre body. The poor head retention is probably do to the higher alcohol. The aroma is bursting with a ripe fruitiness (blood orange, pomelo, tangelo) and a monster maltiness (caramel, toffee, honey, roasted almonds) accenuated by a somewhat floral, herbal hop character that's reminiscent of freshly cut grass, pine cones, and mild green tea leaves. Some spicy pungency, but not as resiny as one might expect. Solid alcohol derived legs that hang on the glass, as it's swirled. Some fusels. Warning! Big beer lies ahead. The flavor starts off sweet (candi sugar, corn syrup, clover honey) with an absurd amount of maltiness with hints of rumcake, sugar loaf, and toasted pine nuts. The sweetness becomes more controlled as a moderate-high bitterness creeps up to subdue this malty, hop laced monster. The bitterness starts lingering towards the cheek warming finish. This is an extremely complex, full bodied elixir with a surreptitious strength. Definitely not for the weak or timid! Cellar a few bottles for when something strong is needed. This is a showcase of the brewer's art and love for the hop plant (Humulus lupulus). Here's to another ""Off-centered"" creation from Dogfish Head!  CHEERS!

10099,9086,Pencible,3.67,"Very rare and expensive ($10 for a 12 oz bottle), this poured a slightly hazy light auburn with moderate off-white head. It smelled like sugary hops and alcohol. It tasted like honey beer, with very sugary hops and not much else. The flavor was super sweet with a decent amount of bitterness and some alcohol warming in the aftertaste. All that combined makes this very unique, but pretty hard to drink. On the plus side, it did have a smooth texture with very little carbonation. Overall this was a ridiculous beer that would be delicious for those with a huge sweet tooth, but disgusting to anyone else.

T: Not what you'd think when the bottle says Imperial IPA. Not much hoppiness, mostly malty sweetness. Very tasty!  MF: Well carbonated and smooth. Feels viscous and thick, a little syrupy.

Lot's of floral hops and a good sweet malty presence as well.  Taste: I believe that this has mellowed quite a bit with aging... the hops is there, but balanced very well with the sweet malt.

Wonderfully hoppy, fruity - I'm getting lots of apricot here, and floral hops on top of floral hops.  What a great tasting beer!  The downside is the high alcohol content. This one burns a little going down. Mouthfeel is smooth, but this is hard to drink. I'm nursing mine in a Three Philosophers snifter, and drinking a big glass of water every 4 ounces or so.

I poured the beer into a 12 oz glass. The beer rode down the side of the glass like a molasses water slide. In between an amber and copper color. The one finger head had great retention.  The smell would satisfy any hophead. Mixed in with the hop aroma is the big maltiness of the beer. At the end the nostrils get a little burn from the alcohol.  Going into this I expected a good burn from the alcohol. I was wrong. This beer is so big it hid the alcohol. First the sweet maltiness (molasses) comes out then quickly balanced with the 120 IBUs. At the very end of the taste is the alcohol but not too profound.  Syrupy, molasses that floats over the tongue like silk. In between sips you can still feel the beer sitting on your tongue encouraging you to take another sip.  With 21% alc. and just plain simply a huge beer this is not a beer I am going to throw down. But then again I didn't buy this beer to throw down. I could enjoy only a few in a night but thats all I need.  Overall a great beer. This is a type of beer that makes DFH the brewery it is.

I just didn't find it anywhere near as drinkabile as the 60 or the 90 minute IPAs and it has nothing to do with the high alcohol content. There was a certain sweetness that comes from God knows where. With 120 minutes of hopping I was expecting something similar to the 90 min served through Randall the Enamel Animal. The beer had a certain ""thickness"" to it that really took away from the mouthfeel.  All is not lost though. Get yourself 2 bottles. The first one you can drink by itself and give it a fair chance.

S - Heavy malt with lots of molasses. Hops are less forward than I expected likely due to the noticeable alcohol. It smells BIG.  T - Tastes BIG, too! Alcohol is immediately present and a little harsh. The malts almost remind me of a nice imperial stout with their chocolate tones but this is much more woody. Again the hops play in the background. They are definitely there, but more subtle than expected, likely due to how forward everything else is. The finish is more bitter, and I think this is where the hops come through.

The alcohol is hidden really well in this beer which is surprising for how big it actually is.

Flavor is extremely sweet up front, with grapefruit liqueur and maple syrup. The harsh rubbing alcohol comes out in the finish.  Mouthfeel is very thick. Obviously a sipping beer.

Body is a golden honey amber in color. Nose is lovely and really reminds me of a barlywine. You get hints of phenol spices, fresh citrus, alchol soaked dark fruits and boozy hop character. On first sip you get a very up front spicey alchol induced fuzzy feel all over the mouth. Big notes of citrus rind, rum soaked pears and syrupy sweetness. At 21% alchol this is a bottle best shared but if you have it to yourself sip it all night long. The hop profile is very subdued by the alchol but it is there, mostly on the end of the palate.

I don't remember tasting the alcohol so much in previous batches, but I'm getting it here. Half way through the glass I'm getting the alc in the aroma heavily as the head is gone. Lacing is actually on the glass even with the high alcohol. Very slight 90 minute comparisons, the alcohol is really overpowering taste and smell. Almost done and I think my tongue is dead, I could drink another at this point (though, no need too.) Drinkability got better as I neared the end on this bottle.

The color was a dandy shade of gold with a thin head and little to no lacing. My first sniff reminded me of alcohol and honey. Then the taste, to me, the fine ingredients and brewing were overpowered by the alcohol and sweetness but how do you hide 21.00%. I am sure Dogfish head did their best.

Very sweet, big pine flavour and a tart edge up front. Doesn't feel as bitter as I would have expected in the finish. Some fruit - notes of peaches, grapes, apple and tangerine are evident. Some nuttiness shows through as well. Finish is quite clean though, and many of the flavours don't linger overlong. Alcohol is noticed of course, but given the extreme strength of this, well hidden/balanced by other elements.  M - Syrupy and thick. Moderate carbonation. Warms my tummy.  D - A sipper for sure, but very tasty. A touch expensive to drink a lot of, but I would definitely try it again. A good deal more drinkable than many barleywines.

Definitely not as hoppy as I was expecting, but that's OK here; the flavors work together pretty well. It seems really smooth, especially given the amount of alcohol in it (there's definitely a nice warming note).

I'm a hop fanatic, so I was a little disappointed the hop flavor were not more prominent - but, after a few sips I realized this was probably the most unique beer experience I'd ever had.

Strong, but not offensive (which is saying something considering I don't really *do* hoppy-ass beer like this).  The flavor is really quite something. Where a level of bitterness was expected, there was the drippy sweetness of overripe fruits. It goes down smoothly, with residual bursts of intensity here and there.

S: The smell was slightly sweet with citrus notes and pine. with the obvious floral hop aroma mixed in.  T: I was shocked that the ABV is hidden quite well. That being said, my wife grabbed it and tasted it as I came back in the room. Her response ""HOLY GOD what is that?!... tastes like vodka"" Well.... pay no attention to her. The taste is amazing if you are a hop head. BUT, that is not to say that this is a terribly hoppy TASTING beer. It is very balanced, and the fruity, citrus taste is very nice indeed.  M/D: The mouth feel was pretty thick and viscus for a beer of this clarity. This beer is an experience. You certainly cannot / should not drink more than 1 or 2, what's the point. this beer is like a dangerously fast car REALLY fun when you are careful and know what you are doing, not a daily driver, but one to roll out on those very special occasions for an exhilarating spin around the block.

T: This my second 120 I expected more hops. Because the first was over two years aged and the hops had eased a lot and I really enjoyed this batch not as sweet, with some alcohol warmth, and a hops present were very balanced.

10099,9086,stephens101,4.1,"Approaching this ""extreme"" beer with some respect. Have another bottle that I'm going to age for awhile, as instructed on the label, but couldn't wait any longer to try one. There are very few beers of this magnitude around, which doesn't necessarily make it a great beer, but it's hella fun nonetheless. Pours reddish-brown with a one-finger, thick off-white head. Spotty streaks of lacing are left behind. I'm very surprised that the aroma up front was big on the malts and caramel and not a hop attack. Oddly enough, the alcohol and hops are barely discernible to the nose. Taste of sweet raisins and malts in the beginning, then the hops and alcohol heat kick in toward the end. The caramel sweetness covers up the alcohol heat pretty well, but there is some true bitter complexity to the whole experience. Mouth-feel is rich, almost creamy at times. It's full-bodied and carbonation is decent with some bubbly activity throughout. I'll have say beers like this definitely have their place in the beer world, and it's awesome seeing people experimenting and pushing boundaries. Just think where we'd be if the craft-brew pioneers didn't take some chances along the way?

S: Very interesting, a full brunt of pine hops attacks first, lemon, orange liqueur, and ethanol, kind of peaty as well in the end - scotch like, but it's a minour note.  T: Quite hoppy on the first taste, hoppier than I remember it being - piney, some grapefruit there, then it balances out, becoming a lot more sweet, orange comes out, some spice notes - pepper and coriander-esque, banana, and also a large amount of solvent alcohol character.  M: Alcoholic, solventy, phenolic, full-bodied, viscous, thick.  D: Drinks a lot more like a spirit than a beer, but even at 21% alc./vol., it is surprisingly easy to drink, an drinks of a beer at half that potency.

Smells fruity, like pineapple or raison, also some hops. A little spicy maybe. There seems to be a lot going on. Tastes very sweet and fruity with a hop bite in the end with some alcohol. I can't taste much of the alcohol, but can feel it as it goes down. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy and smooth. The carbonation is light. Would be difficult to drink more than one at a sitting. For all the hops in the brew I would expect more of a presence in aroma and taste. Not exactly what I expected, but still a very good beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,denali99755,4.4,"Pours pretty, hazy dark amber, the color of good honey. Nose is moderately strong with boozey apricot hops.  This beer hides its alcohol well, which is to say it drinks like a 12% instead of the 21% it actually is. The flavor is very smooth and hard to describe, besides that it tastes like what would happen if a good, solid lighter IPA (Two Hearted Ale, Terminal Gravity, Walking Man, or something like that) got older and wiser, gained some weight, and developed an appreciation for the finer points of living. Very rounded, but dries out on the finish and the 120IBU finally starts to show.  Mouthfeel is a little greasy, which is to be expected from a beer with a higher ABV than most liqueur. And it gets very dry, as mentioned, at the end.  Obviously, this is not a session beer. Best enjoyed as a celebration or on a special occasion (I got a new job!)--and in that respect, it's great. It's a little over the top, but for what it is, I don't know if Dogfish Head could have done much better.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Aggressive sloshing yields about an inch of white head. Mouthfeel is oily and syrupy; interesting.  Smells like tropical fruit and malt. No real hop smell. Taste is more of the same; big booze, big sweet caramel malt, gigantic almost overpowering sweet fruit. Orange liquer-ish, mango, god knows what else. Again -- where are the hops? This is a DIPA with almost no hop content. There's some pine/grapefruit on the swallow, but this is a pretty unique DIPA.  I had no idea till I punched up Beeradvocate that this was a 21% abv.

10099,9086,t0rin0,3.13,"Wow, what the hell is this stuff? I mean, everything about this beer is so incredibly extreme, even the description of ""age for a decade or so"". The beer poured a reddish color that was a little dark for a DIPA, maybe a tad lighter than red. The color of the liquid and its clarity were nice but the foam is where it lost points. The foam, while sticky, was a nasty urine soaked whitish-yellow color. I can only assume thats the oils from the hops that are continually added.  The aroma is malty and sweet but at the same time I got this impression that I was just opening a box of new shoes. The grapefruit smell of hops (lots and lots of them) mixing with a ton of alcohol smelled of fresh rubber. The reason I gave it a 3 is because it had that nice malt backbone to it. This odd rubber quality was more subdued in the flavor. The alcohol was also subdued in the flavor. The flavor was an interesting mix between a ton of hops and a ton of malt. I would really like to try a decade old version of this just to see what its going to turn into. My theory is that it will be intensly sweet, like a low abv mead or an ice wine or something.  The body was definitely heavy on this one. Heavy for a DIPA especially of this size. Would drink again but its pretty expensive.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

10099,9086,Lothar666,4.47,"I got this as part of a christmas present from my beloved wife to be, and have been looking forward to finally drinking it but I wanted to get over my head cold first.  A- A very cautious pour produced a single finger thick, foamy head that was set atop a red-orange-amber body. Head slowly receeded and left a sticky lacing- the body was very dark for an IPA, not what I expected at all.  S- Strong hop character backed by notes of pine, flowers and citrus. Could be smelled from at least a foot away.  T- Wow. The potent, abraisive, kick you in the teeth with hops characteristic of a true imperial IPA from the start of the sip mixed with the alcohol burn of a strong barleywine in the finish. Both of these are good things, by the way, and truly help this beer to live up to everything I hoped it would be. A true masterpiece in the art of brewing.  M- The thick and chewy viscosity is also something I wasn't expecting from an IPA, though I found it most enjoyable.  D- Definitely a slow sipper by absolute necessity due to the alcohol by volume and the complexity of the flavors, but this is not a bad thing. The worst thing about this beer is that its price point puts it out of reach as an everyday brew, but for special occasions this is well worth the money.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Damian,4.72,"Drank from a 12 fl. oz. bottle purchased at Julio's Liquors, Westboro, MA  Poured a beautifully bright and glowing, deep crimson-amber. Slight chill haze disappeared as the liquid warmed. The beer was capped by a small, bubbly, one-finger head that quickly faded to a frothy ring. On each sip, the sticky, viscous liquid slowly carried spotty blankets of lacing down the glass.  The aroma was ridiculously lush and intense. Calling the malt backbone ""stiff"" in this double IPA would be a huge understatement. Sweet, fruity and boozy with strong notes of canned peaches, citrus, pineapple, maple syrup and white candi sugar.  The flavor was also super sweet and fruity. Peaches, apricots and mango came through strong. Orange peel, grapefruit and hints of jasmine appeared as well, diligently making their way through the malty sweetness. Brown sugar was also noticeable. It was not until the beer reached the back of my palate that I discovered any element of bitterness. The finish was hoppy and citrusy with a slight alcohol warming, and the aftertaste was sweet and syrupy with a touch of pine.  The mouthfeel was syrupy and viscous to the extreme. Rich, creamy and smooth with a fine, mild carbonation.  Aside from beers that have been sweetened ""artificially,"" this was definitely the sweetest brew I have tried to date. It's understandable why many people (especially hop heads) would dismiss this DIPA as cloying, yet I enjoyed it very much. With the 21% ABV being so incredibly well masked (I have tasted 12% beers that that were hotter than this one) this beer is perfect for enjoying slowly. In fact, if there ever was a hoppy beer made to sip as a wintertime nightcap, it would be this one.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Phocion,3.43,"Traded a little over a year ago from ManiacalOne.  Poured into a Corsendonk tulip with a beautiful semi-transparent copper color. Being such a high-alcohol brew I was expecting a smaller head, but this thing is massive. Huge white frothy head just isn't going anywhere...  Whoa. I think I might've actually gotten a little dizzy smelling this thing. Immensely sweet fruit salad in my nose... grapefruit, orange peel, apples, plums, God only knows what else.. oh and of course, a ton of alcohol. Somewhat of a floral hoppiness too hiding in the back.  First swallow... took me completely off-guard. This is not at all what I expected out of a beer that advertises itself at 120 IBUs. In fact, it's downright sweet. I expected a little bit of sweetness from the ridiculously high alcohol content, but after reading on the label about this so-called ""holy grail for hopheads"" I am sorely disappointed. But still, just because it's not what I was expecting doesn't make it bad. Very bread doughy malts and a ton of tropical fruits here, oranges, mangos, peaches, etc. Not a lot else minus the huge alcohol flavor.  Very thick, sticky mouthfeel. Definitely full-bodied and actually somewhat reminiscent of schnapps....or maple syrup. In fact, I'm having to grab some water every couple sips. Frankly, this one is just going a little too far... try it for novelty if you get the chance, but don't go too far out of your way.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

The color is a hazed deep orange/amber topped with a minimal head. Smells of big sweet Belgianesque malts balanced with a hefty amount of spicy hops. First and foremost this beer is a sipper. I was expecting a big ""syrup-like"" beer from some of the forum posts. Don't get me wrong the body was very big but very well balanced nonetheless. I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of spicy, piny, juicy hops. This is balanced with a nice malty sweetness and maybe some apricot fruitness too. A good boozey aftertaste tags along in the aftertaste. I will admit that I was hoping for a ""hop-bomb"" but considering how much malt went into this beer I am quite pleased with the hop profile. I would certainly enjoy this beer again and would love to try it on-tap poured through a Randall.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Somewhat subtle nose that is moderately malty with resinous pine to citrus hops on the grapefruit side of things. Hint of spice and a little sweet smelling. The taste is big, sweet malt with mildly bitter hops with a decent balance that is a sweet and almost medicinal. It transitions to an aftertaste that is sweet and very medicinal. The mouthfeel is full bodied and very syruppy with a soft carbonation and an alcoholic finish. The bottle says ""enjoy now or age for a decade or so."" The bottled on date was not entirely readable, but appeared to be in 06. My impression is that this is a beer that really needs to age to mellow. The flavor is nearly overpoweringly sweet . Almost like artificial sweetener mixed with cough syrup. I would definitely not buy this again, especially at its very high price. Not sure what everyone sees in this one, and I sort of wonder if I got a bad bottle, but I won't be trying it again to find out. There were no off smells, and it looks good, so I don't think this is the case. I give Dogfish head respect for this attempt.

10099,9086,DoubleJ,4.72,"I was lucky to grab the last bottle from the shelf at Marty's Liqour (Allston, MA) during my visit in BoTown. I haven't had a Double IPA for almost three months now, so I'll admit I'm a little nervous. The only problem is this isn't a Double IPA, it's greater than that. The numbers are earth shatering, 20% ABV, 120 IBU's, and 450 calories. Love the design on the bottle cap, though I think there should be a warning in text on the label too (Idea: if a fizzy yellow beer drinker inhales this, seek medical attention immediately.) Something's missing...oh yeah, my bottle opener and my oversized wine glass. Let me get those, and as soon as I come back, let go on to the beer:  Into the glass it goes...it's a deep orange color, chill hazed. Ruby red hues are mixed in this eye candy. The head is short-lived. The aroma isn't strong, but it is deep. Hops? Yes, there are hops, but it's surprisingly sweet. Lots of juicy tropical flavors in this one. More like concentrated syrup is what it is. It's like ecstasy; I want to continue smelling it. But I must press on to the taste...  Here we go...WOW, that is one smooth devil. I can still feel the alcohol inside of me. It isn't really ""bitter"" at all, it's just like the aroma. Sweet, juicy, tropical fruits all around. I want to continue sipping on it, but I must break a little more than I want as this is some very thick stuff. Very syrupy and carbonation is short lived on the palate. Oooo, ahhhh. Another sip please. Yes!!! More! WooHoo!! Although you feel the booze on your insides, you can't find much of it in the beer. Hold on, I got to lick the flavor off my lips. Yum. Hey, I'm feeling good now. I think I feel the alcohol starting to kick in. Let's wrap this up.  I was expecting to struggle against this beer, but my palate won the battle. I'm really glad I tried it out. I have nothing else to say expect this: get yours hands on a bottle if you see it.

S- Smells like resin and slight citrus, alcohol, a decent malt profile supporting. Perhaps a bit of cane sugar... smells quite sweet and quite hoppy- Perhaps the strongest on both counts of any DIPA.  T- Initially ridiculously sweet. Like--drinking honey. Then the hops come in to balance and override, with tons of sappy, resinous flavors and a bit of grapefruit. Alcohol flavor comes in quite strong towards the end, and it finishes almost like a port. Actually, the whole thing is like a port. If someone made a port with hops and barley instead of grapes, it would be exactly this. The overall impression is just like drinking a good 10 year.

Taste is very very very sugary. Not as much hop flavor as I was expecting. Very good sugary taste, the hop taste is there but it is not as bitter or obvious as I expected. Defenitely some pine and particularly citrus flavors here though. The most marvelous thing about this brew is that for 21% it goes down riotously smooth. Sugar is plastered on the lips. The mouthfeel is real thick, but not mud. Alcohol heat is present especially in the stomach after the finish, but still is hard to beleive this is 21%. The drinkability is life threatening.

10099,9086,Hoppington,2.88,"Too strong, to sweet and too expensive! Here is a case of extreme brewing that has gone too far, IMO. They probably should have stopped at 90 minutes on the hopping. I just don't find this stuff that drinkable. At DFH pub, they serve it in a brandy snifter. So strong it is just not very refreshing and the hops ratio is so overpowering that it obliterates the palate so that every other IPA you try within the next few hours tastes like a pilsner! Looks fantastic though and smells like heaven. Strangely, I was getting faint vinegar notes in the times I have tasted this beer. I applaud DFH for taking this style to the limit though!

The nose is packed full of sweet caramel malt, spicy citric hops, rum like alcohol, dark fruits and licorice.  This is one powerful brew.

Smells of very sharp citrus and pineapple hops. Some honey and candy scents as well. Extremely sweet on the palate, huge alcohol hits immediately (think schnapps). Lots of honey and peach flavors at first, with caramel and candy, followed closely by the huge citrus hop kick. Not overwhelmingly hoppy as would have expected, much more dominant malt sweetness, but still the hops resonate. This beer is every flavor of a great IPA amplified by 10. Alcohol warms the throat and stomach. The mouthfeel is all syrup and slick. Drinkability? Considering the 21%, very.

Color is a nice reddish-amber hue, very Hazy.  Smell is magnificent. Very hoppy, nice notes of evergreen and hints of fresh Maui Pineapple and floral tones.  Before describing the taste, I must mention the nice full mouth feel which stands out in this beer. I wondered why they compared this to port: now I know.  The taste is sweet and extremely complex. Notes of citrus, sweetness balance well with the hops.  This is a wonderful beer. It would be hard to rate in terms of drinkability on this one.

Its a totally different beer than 1 year old 120. Poured orangish amber. Nice white head. More head than any other 120 ive had.  Smells so brilliant and gorgeous. Toasted sesame oil. Ive never tasted that in a beer. Hop smells like pine nuts. Mikado ginger dressing is what this immediately reminded me of. Defintitely some citrus as well.  Pleasant sweetness. Ahint of freshly cut grass I actually taste the sesame as well as smell it. I bit of orange flavor. I can't believe how well the alcohol is hidden. That is master craftsmanship. If I guessed the alcohol in a blind tasting i would probably guess it to be 11-13%% or so. Not much phenyl aroma or flavor. I bit of smokiness. I'm in love with this beer. If you love extremities in art you'll love this beer in the name of creativity. Scarily drinkable. I'm glad it's 10 bucks a bottle. If it was cheap I'd quit my job, buy a hammock and take up the accordion.  The hop finish is rich with pine. Not really that hoppy despite the toil of sir hops a lot.

The color is dark yellow to light orange as it pours into the glass and clear medium orange in the glass with a modest, fluffy head that sticks to the glass, leaving a dense lacing as the beer drains away. The smell is surprisingly sweet and suprisingly mildly hoppy with an earthy background. The mouthfeel is sticky (which I like) and the taste is sugary sweet with a much subtler hoppiness (at first) than I expected. As the beer warms a bit, more hoppiness comes out in the smell and the flavor. But still, this is definitely not in the mold of a CA-style IPA or DIPA (I don't mean that as a complaint, just a comparison). I suppose the hopping is more nuanced, but with my (non-super taster) palate and frame of reference, I'm afraid some of that nuance may be lost on me. For me, the sugary sweetness is most noticeable; and due to it, I couldn't drink a whole lot of this beer in one sitting.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,geexploitation,3.85,"Bottle with just a bit of age on it -- almost a year (bottled January 2007, opened 1/1/08) -- that I'm comparing to a much newer bottle (two months) from the newest batch of 120. Pours with excellent clarity and a small, yellowish head that fades to a collar on top of a dark amber body with some nice darker-brown ""highlights"". The nose is nicely balanced between the hops, which display a fine-grained, metallic grittiness (think 300 sandpaper) and the malts, which give off a honey graham note. On the palate, the sweetness of the malts and the bitterness of the hops are far more well-integrated than in younger bottles. Nice fruitiness that's hard to put a name to -- it's halfway between citrus, berry and tropical fruits -- comes out at the mid-palate. The finish sweetens significantly but somehow ends with hop dryness. Mouthfeel is improved with age, but still shows a lot of hotness throughout the palate. It's expected with a 21% ABV beer, but it's still distracting. Overall, 120 is much better with a year of age on it. The flavors play much better together, the sweetness is toned down a bit, and the hop astringency is gone. I would guess that 18 to 24 months would be the perfect age at which to drink this beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

A - Pours a cloudy orange with a creamy white head...more of a red color appears as the head dissipates to a thin ring.  S - Powerful aroma of piney hops, alcohol, and a sweetness I can't quite put my finger on...  T - Caramel malt, alcohol, and dry, bitter hops are all extremely pronounced as they work very well together; needs to be sipped very slowly in order for all the flavors to come through. As every bit malty as it is hoppy...I was expecting more bitterness, but the caramel flavor comes through extra-strong as well.  M - Thick-bodied with a wonderful warming sensation as your reward.  D - Obviously with such a high ABV, it would never make for a regular selection...I'd say it fits well as a cocktail-hour beer, as a replacement for a liquor; a beer to be enjoyed over a long period of time.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,abcsofbeer,3.97,"From a 12 oz bottle, split this one with my brother in law as a nice after Christmas present from the wonderful Mrs. We poured this into oversized wine glasses and the color is a cloudy, dark amber. It is topped by a thin, off-white head that falls to a thin crown.  The aroma was difficult to pin down, but, is somewhat medicinal with the high alcohol content. It also has hints of cherry and other fruits. The hop characteristics are minimal in the aroma.  The taste is different from other Imperial IPAs I have tried in that the hop flavor is not one to rip your tongue out. The maltiness and fruitiness balance out the hop flavor to give it a different type of overall hoppiness. There is some warming alcohol but not overwhelming with the high content.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied and the hop flavor becomes more apparent when held in the mouth.  I enjoyed this one immensely as a late nightcap.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Traquairlover,4.12,"12-oz bottle with about 6-oz poured into a tulip, and the rest split between two port glasses.  A = Copper tinted honey color, lots of very tiny bubbles of carbonation, small white head very light lacing.  S = Hops are very strong (more piney than citrusy), but an underlying sweetness pervades so the smell is less that of a pine attack than of a sweet bouquet of fresh flowers in the Spring. Good balance with sweet honey notes rising in with the hops.  T = Sweet honey flavors hit first, followed by light fresh baked bread notes, flowers, pine, not much bitterness until the good long finish. The entire experience has an alcohol hotness that is present but not unpleasant or over powering.  M = Luscious, thick, excellent mouthcoat.  D = This is a very good beer, which I look forward to having over time (since I have now stored some away), but with the strong flavors and high ABV, you don't want more than a glass or two at a time, but what a time!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

10099,9086,younger35,3.23,"Received this brew from chadbrew in my very first trade. Im a bit weary about this brew but Im pretty excited to try it. Im guessing its right around a year old. Drank from my snifter while watching season 1 of Lost.  Appearance- Pours a copper orange with a huge off-white fluffy head. Great cap and collar left for the entire brew and more lacing than Ive ever seen. Smell- Ridiculous amounts of grapefruit, pineapple and mango. Super fruity and citrusy and fresh. Some peanut brittle background does manage to seep in under all of those hops but barely. P.S. Loads of alcohol. Taste- Starts super bitter with massive amount of fruity grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, bubblegum and cotton candy. That quickly passes and the ridiculously sweet caramel malt moves in and trys to balance things out. It really isnt successful but this isnt the hop bomb I was expecting. Its more of a malt bomb with loads of alcohol. Finishes with a lingering butterscotch aftertaste. Mouthfeel- Very thick and syrupy with a oily slickness, light carbonation and loads of warming from the alcohol. Drinkability- Sitting at 21% this brew isnt exactly sessionable, or really drinkable. Its definitely a sipping brew; a sipping brew that you should enjoy with a friend, or six. This isnt exactly my cup of tea but considering the extremes that this beer reaches, its really not that bad. Worth trying but dont expect a whole lot. Im going to try one more of these in my life and its going to be super fresh.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,smcolw,3.37,"It pours a cloudy orange amber. Not much of a head, but there is some lace left behind.  Very strong pinecone-like hop smell--very fresh. This is too strong to detect much malt or alcohol.  This has the sweetness of fruit punch with a slight hop counter point. This is, for me, too much of a good thing. Strong alcohol warmth in the aftertaste along with the pine hop. Still, the sweetness prevails. Almost oily in the body with low carbonation.  This is an interesting beer, with extreme flavors all around. It is difficult to finish because of it overbearingness. I would say it is worthy of a one time try.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,BBM,4.4,"This beer is called the ""Holy Grail for hopheads."" In my humble opinion, I would think a hophead would get more enjoyment out of a nice, powerful IPA or American pale ale as opposed to an Imperial IPA, only because the malt profile is so prevalent in this style of beer that it somewhat detracts from a real big hop bitterness. But that is not to take anything away from this delicious brew.  It poured a smooth, clear amber into a brandy snifter, with minimal head, but nice web-like lacing around the edges of the glass. The aroma was very sweet. There were hints of fruits and flowers, as well as a musty smell that transformed into alcohol as the beer warmed.  The huge, caramel malt backbone really pushes through and navigates its way through a rambunctious hopfield to balance everything out. The bitter hops keep things interesting, as hints of fruits, citrus, and pine try their hardest to assault the palate. The alcohol is masked incredibly well, but you still feel like the beer has some weight behind it (and it does). Mouthfeel is smooth and thick, and not very carbonated. Obviously this is a sipping beer, one to be enjoyed with another (I was fine after splitting a 12oz bottle) and a perfect winter treat.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,pwoods,3.43,"12oz. brown bottle, purchased at Party Source, poured into a snifter. Dating is smudged but I believe it's from '07  A: Pours a ruby red grapefruit with a bronze tinting. 1 finger of off white head rises up in the snifter and eventually dies to a thick fluffy skim. Some patchy lacing.  S: Alcohol is definitely present with raw phenols. Alcohol doesn't destroy other scents. I can still easily get a nice sweet grapefruit oil with a spiciness to it. Malts are hugely sweet and very similar to a barleywine.  T/M: Bitterness isn't extremely huge like I thought it might have been. It could either be the massive malt backbone overpowering it or this might already be aged a year. Sweet citrus oils can still be detected. Malt is very sweet and slightly oak-y. Alcohol is still very present. Medium full bodied that is a bit syrupy. Carbonation seems on the low side after the first minute or 2.  D: Not bad tasting at all. I'd suggest sharing a single bottle with at least 1 other person. If I were blind tasting this without even a style given, I'd bet on it being a barleywine instead of a Triple IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

There is noticeable oily hop residue in the bottom of the glass, and carbonation is sparse.  S: Smell is quite alcoholic, almost to the point of being medicinal, or like ""cleaning supplies."" However, the oily pine, grapefruit and citric hop aroma is so deep and musky. There is a sweetness rising from it, but it's mostly like a wonderful Christmas tree.  T: Big time hops; sweet oily pine hop attack on the front, sides and middle of the tongue. There is a certain balance to it, and the alcohol is masked somewhat, but it could stand to mellow a bit, if that's possible.  M: Has a heavy, warming, syrupy mouthfeel, like your holding a bit of Aunt Jemima in your mouth. Hop sting is noticeable, and the alcohol burn is there too.  D: It's not difficult to drink, but it's meant to be savored, and as such, I wouldn't recommend having the whole bottle by yourself. It's a sipper, and a true delight for hopheads.  Got this bottle for Christmas from a friend, but I've been cellaring a 4-pack bought in Rehoboth Beach this August. Now that I've got it out of my system, I can let that sit for 5-10 years, if I can contain myself. 90 Minute is smoother, but this brew truly embraces the slogan, ""Feel the Burn ...

I agree with some of the othere reviewers that the alcohol is very well hidden...in fact it was surprising to taste after I had the initial smell.  Definately not an everyday beer but nice for special occasions - it almost felt like I was sipping a cognac. I have several more bottles of this that I intend to age, and very anxious to try in another 2-4 years due to the fact it is so smooth now !

Soo complex...floral nose, hoppy deliciousness, sugar and caramel followed by a perfect balance of sweet malts. The amount of hops is present on the nose, but it smells more sweet than it would be bitter.  T: Holy shit!! Again, a very complex taste consisting of a variety of hops and a touch of malts accompanied by large amounts of brown sugar. The best part of this beer is the incorporation of fruits, namely strawberry, dates, raisins, and a handfull of others. It is a very very very sugary beer  MF: Soo smooth. This beer finishes with a fruity and hoppy aftertaste. Very very viscous (bigger than some stouts I've had).  D: Very high despite the 21% ABV  You know you are drinking a high quality beer when the ABV is 21% and you cannot notice the alcohol.

Poured a deep deep orange, reminded me of the 90 minute, but more opaque. The smell was sweet and floral. Taste was sweet and tangy. If i were to blindly taste this, i would not think it was an ipa. I agree with some other posters that it tastes like a barleywine.  The first half of the bottle went down smooth and I tasted notes of pineapple. By the 2nd half, I think the booze was kicking in and my taste receptors shut down a bit. However it was very drinkable considering the ABV.  Overall I think is a bit too sweet for my tastebuds.

The smell is alcohol, hops and sweet malt, under-attenuated sweet malt anyway, in that order, it is more like a liquor than beer, without the hops I wouldn't call it a beer by smell. The taste is very much the same as the smell however I'd call it fairly mild in comparison to some of the other extreme beers that I've had. Sure the alcohol is very noticeable, but it isn't overpowering, the sweetness tends to build but doesn't become cloying and there is enough of a hop presence to keep things in check and balance the sweetness, which is one of the places that World Wide Stout by dogfish fails. Mouthfeel is good rich full warming, peppery due to the alcohol and it leaves a residual sweetness and wine like drying sensation that is quite pleasant. Drinkability is ok but not very good, come on this almost isn't beer, definitely a sipper make sure you have no where to go for a while after you order one of these but worth every penny when sampled on draft, if you've only had it in the bottle, seek it out on tap!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,brenthaertlein,3.87,"The local beer enthusiast store (deceptively called Liquor Loft) was kind enough to reserve me a few of the Dogfish Head beers released this winter ('07). After picking up an Olde School Barleywine, a World Wide Stout and a much sought-after 120 Minute IPA... I couldn't decide which to sample first.  Waiting a week or so, the 120 became my obvious choice, being not only the strongest but also possessing of a delightful reputation.  Pouring about half into a Delerium snifter, the head was quite faint and was paper thin. The tiny amount of head relegated itself to the edges of the glass and left a very sparse lacing. A clear but deep amber color fills the glass.  The smell was fruity and sweet, highly alcoholic but not overpowering. Notes of citrus and the hop flower's undertone.  Surprisingly, the taste hides the alcohol content remarkably. As both the hoppiest and most alcohol beer I've had to date, I expected an almost cognac/brandy alcoholic taste and mouthfeel. The taste has an immediate impact of cidery sweet, with a caramel undertones. The aftertaste is a plethora of hoppy explosions on the palette, more like savoring a wine than drinking a beer.  The mouthfeel of this beer is powerful, the hops coating the tongue. Harsher than most beers, this also hurts the drinkability of the beer. Quite obviously, this is a sipping beer in which one serving is enough. Drinking a whole one is akin to eating a hearty sandwich.

It is so syrupy sweet that I had trouble swallowing and tasting what else the beer had to offer. The hops aroma and bitterness is there as advertised, but the alcohol sweetness overwhelms the entire beer that there is no balance.

An average pour produced a 2 fingered creamy head that lasted longer than I expected for a 21% abv beer. Some splotches of lacing appear on the sides of the glass as you indulge.  Nose is absolutely huge .. biggest I've ever encountered. Big hop notes of course, which are of pine, hay, grass and citrus character. Also present in the nose is huge sweet floral malts, along with the obvious alcohol presence.  Taste is surprisingly sweet (malty) up front, but all those hop aromatics and flavors are battling for your palate. The balance is pretty good, and the mouthfeel is immense. The 120 IBUs are clearly offset by huge malts. This is a very impressive beer, but not one I'd have more than one of at a sitting. First of all, at 21% abv, one is plenty. Secondly, at 450 calories per bottle, it's darn near a meal in a bottle.  I split a case with some friends, and will be cellaring the rest of my 'stash', to see how the beer matures as it ages.

10099,9086,sharpy26,4.3,"Appearance - A dark brown/amber hue. Poured nicely into a pint glass from a 12 oz bottle.  Smell - The smell did not represent 21% abv. A mild smell, fruity and nutty.  Taste - WOW. Nature's bounty laid in front of you in a frosty pint glass. The alcohol is masked by a strong sweetness. Doesn't taste nearly as hoppy as the 90 minute ipa, but it tastes sweet and roasty going down.  Mouthfeel - The first sip is like a cool autumn night. Harder to drink as it warms. Not too much carbonation, not too little. It is nice in the mouth.  Drinkability - 100%.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,pieper,3.98,"This is a great beer but such a different beer that it is hard to classify it in the double IPA category. I bought this at the Milton Brewery and think that it is a great beer, but because of its strong alcohol content and flavor, it does not lend itself to be a session beer.  Aroma: I have a poor sense of smell but you can definitely smell the sweetness of this beer along with its alcohol content.  Appearance: Thin silky head, mahogany red, clear, stain glass like.  Taste: Wow - smooth alcohol taste with a nice balanced sweetness to it, slight bitterness on the back of the tongue.  Mouth feel: A very nice even level of carbonation",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Gizmo,3.95,"I just had to try this at least once. ""Continually hopped over a 120 minute boil and then dry hopped every day for a month"", sounds reasonable enough...  It pours a thick, beautiful deep caramel orange with a massive, chunky head that just sits there after a heavy pour; very nice for such a high alcohol brew.  The nose is intense, I'm not even sure how to describe it. Heavy orange marmalade, toffee, bubblegum, and a cotton candy-like sweetness; hops are there but very sweet and citrusy.  Taste is incredibly thick and complex. Heavy dextrin sweetness up front, more cotton candy and bubblegum, heavy tongue numbing alcohol, grassy pine notes, wow! This is a huge freakin' beer. Honestly the sweetness is a bit much, and pretty cloying and syrupy throughout. Finish is like sucking on a sugar cube; intensly sweet and hot from the alcohol.  Mouthfeel is something like maple syrup, extremely heavy and viscous, with an equally heavy body. Carbonation holds together pretty well considering the amount of alcohol. I'm not sure about this one. It's extremely syrupy and sweet, and the hops kind of get lost in all that malt. Pretty good beer overall, and very well done considering it's strength, but probably not something I'll have again anytime soon.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Floydster,3.18,"12 ounce bottle purchased from Liquid Solutions in Oregon for about twelve dollars  Enjoyed this while watching football today, and watched the Colts and Manning completely choke  As far as alcohol content goes, this was the strongest beer I have ever had, it pretty much knocked me on my backside  Poured into my Dogfish Head snifter with a orange red color and a soapy white head that was barely visible and settled immediately, left lots of lacing though  Smell was grassy-like hops with some grapefruit and oranges, could definitely smell the high alcohol content, strong citrus smell mixed with strong but sweet malt  Taste was alright but nothing like I expected, did not taste like much of an IPA to me, hops were overpowered by the malt and I could really taste the booze in it, too sweet and not bitter at all, could have really used some dryness, tasted more like a strong ale to me because of the excess malt, smell was a little piney but this was not evident in its taste, I was hoping for this to be bitter and was disappointed, cannot expect much taste out of something that is so high in ABV though, not bad but not great at the same time, they should make a new category for this type of IPA because it is like nothing else I have ever had  Not much carbonation but taste stuck around for a while because it was pretty potent to begin with  Could not drink much more of this, maybe half of another bottle, heavy and over twenty percent alcohol which is just crazy  Recommended just to say you have tried, strongest IPA you will ever have, be will be able to tell that this boiled for two straight hours based on the strength of its taste",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Anyways I have been meaning to try this one for some time. At $10.49 for a 12oz, I don't know how often I will be having this. It may be a one time thing, so here goes.  A-Pours a clear reddish brown. Aggressive pour yieldsa a cream coloured soapy four finger head. The lacing and retention are phenomenol. Streams of vertical lacing cling to the sides of the glass.  S-Bracing piney hops intermingling with a potent sweet malt and alcohol kick. Potent to say the least.  T-Hops at first, followed by a very sweet caramel and alcohol soaked malt. A nice toasted bread quality comes through as well. The alcohol is very warming as can be expected of something so strong. Definitely a sipper, but does that even need to be mentioned? Some spicy noted also come through, a sort of generic quality though without anything jumping out at me. Aftertaste is very bitter with a bit of drying from the %  M-Not as syrupy as I thought. this is actually slightly above medium bodied but akin to many other 2XIPAs. The body is actually lighter than the 90 minute.  D-This is a night cap sipper, maybe even one to share a 12oz bottle. This is a very tasty brew but the alcohol prevents you from drinking more than one. It is basically like drinking a pint glass of liquer. While tasty, this is much more of a novelty than something I would seek out.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a pint glass.  A. Poured reddish yellow with a fluffy head and moderate lacing.  S. Some grassy hops and malt. So far promising.  T. Now I am let down. For such a highly hopped beer I was hoping for a huge hop presence. This is all sweet malt. Although I will say the high abv is well hidden by the malt.  M. Moderate carbonation and some alcohol warmness.  D. Of course this score is determined by the high abv and the hoops I had to jump through to score this bottle.  I have vowed to try again. I will be trading for this again soon.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

10099,9086,superswing123,4.77,"Appearance: What a fine beverage Dog has created here. Poured from a 12 oz standalone bottle one of the most beautiful presentations ever in my pint glass. Opaque creamy tangerine with not too much of a head but that can be swilled back to its' original presentation. Some minor lace-traces remain wherever the beer has been in the tumbler.  Aroma: Loads of alcohol - stay away from the DUI stops after (1) (just (1) of these) ....you're busted buddy, This stuff is loaded with alcohol. From the get-go, it's been brewed pretty solid towards the ABV advertised. Outside of the booziness, wow what a fragrance of hops and fruits, herbs, more hops, and then, more hops.  Palate: Flavorfull. Fills your mouth with hoppy happiness. The alcohol bite is big but not overwhelming, just really strong. And following the bite the sweetness of honey-flavor remains to remind you have likely have had one of the finest taste experiences available.  Mouthfeel: Very drinkable. Smooth... like silk, almost whiskey, scotch-like without that much of a bite. Powerful lingering hops infuse into your entire entry-port and carry on down into a warming feeling overall. (No doubt enhanced by the ABV content)....  Drinkability: I'd only have one a night, if drinking anything else. This one will ""put you quietly down"" if you had more than 1. Glad I had a full beefy meal before sampling, otherwise...well, who knows, I sure wouldn't be preparing this review. Super brew, not for the amatuers among us. Be careful!  Overall, a sensational experience of a brew. The beer has ""heart"" in a big way. I would recommend every serious beer drinker try one of these at least once. It reminds you of what can be done with some hops, water, grains and a whole lotta talent as a brewer.  Fine stuff, overall.

Rich, full body with a thorough underlying malt and sherry sweetness that is somewhat surprising considering the increasing hoppyness of the 60 and 90. Hops are present to be sure, but are masked by the caramel malt and alcohol flavors. The finish is syrupy sweet as well, and by the end of the bottle you can definitely feel the 21% ABV.

The quarter inch white head dissipated quickly.  s: A very piny hop odor assaults the nose. Very nice. A tiny bit of simple syrup hides behind the hops.  t: Taste is just the opposite of the smell. Here the sweetness is completely dominant. The hops are noticeable, but damn it I want more. A lot more. This beer tastes like it was brewed for novelty purposes only. Far too sweet.  m: Pleasant up front with a nice oily stickiness. The sweet finish is a turn off as it lingers for far too long.  d: I didn't drop into the 1's because I didn't dump it, though I was tempted. Fool me once shame on you. Fool me twice shame on me.

Second try about a year later.  A - This time there is something sourish or medicinal in the aroma. It's entirely unappetizing and I am dropping my score. I almost don't want to drink this.  T - This time, there is nothing subtle. This bottle has to be contaminated. There's a harsh m flavor with a sour finish. People like this?  D - Way too overwhelming for me.

The pour is nothing unusual. The color is interesting in regard to its cloudly appearance. The extra hopping seems to add an element of cloud that is very noticeable.  The head disappears very quickly. Lacing is indeterminate because i foolishly poured this beer into a previously used pint glass. Wrong glass - i know.  Aroma is strong, floral yet contains an unmistakable element that burns the nose in the slightest. There is an almost caramel note to it that i cant quite grab on to... but it is there none the less.  Mouth feel is exactly what you'd expect. All the bitterness of a good hoppy IPA combined with the extreme APV.  The taste is surprisingly sweet for such a high APV. No lasting finish which probably works to this beers advantage. A citrus backnote is pleasant surprise.  Overall, I would recommend this beer - in moderation. seriously.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

I'd planned on cellaring it for a bit longer, but a few trips to the cellar rendered me weak and thirsty.  At first appearance it had a slightly cloudy amber to caramel color, with a nice head that quickly dispersed and left some lace. The aroma was heavy on caramel and slightly nutty, with a roasted hoppy overtone, tinged by the high alcohol content. The first taste was full, with a sweet caramelly taste and a slight nuttiness. The feel was smooth with a lingering dry touch and rounded sweet aftertaste. As far as overall drinkability, I'd have maybe one more.

In fairness, I was unfamiliar to this particular beer up until recently and decided the $8 price tag at Murray's in Milwaukee was worth the gamble.  Much of my opinion has already been discussed in other reviews. Poured nicely, the head not lasting very long. I was unaware of the ABV before diving in. The smell warned me this was dangerous, yet enticing. Overall, I don't know that this is a beer I will be drinking regularly.

10099,9086,BeerBelcher,3.75,"This beer pours a rich amber color with a pretty abundant and persistent soap-scummy head. A lot of ""extreme"" beers suffer in the appearance department (looking more like coffee or cognac than beer), but this one genuinely looks the part. Aroma is a lot of malt, significant hops, and a fair amount of bourbon and sourness. Aroma is in my opinion the high point of this beer. Flavor is a lot of alcohol esters (I get some astringency from it, but perhaps not as much as I should given its 21% ABV) along with a lot of malt cerealness that I typically find in bock beers, balanced with abundant hops, with some sourness/astringency at the finish. The taste is also rather floral. I definitely got a warming feeling in my mouth, throat and stomach after only a sip or two - this is not a beer to be trifled with (or sucked through a funnel, if you were considering it). Mouthfeel is astringent - it's like you have a drying agent or hydrogen peroxide in your mouth - which must be a by-product of abundant alcohol. However, it's not syrupy or unpleasant, which is a good thing.  This is a very unique IPA. It doesn't pack as big a hop wallop as many, and it doesn't come with a lot of very easy-to-like citrus flavors, but it is rather likeable nonetheless. Definitely recommended.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Dark roasted malts, prunes, a rich earthiness, and a big sugary sweetness. The hops is very piney with a juicy, tropical fruitiness. The alcohol is its biggest a second or two after swallowed...a nice warming effect and leaves your palate slightly numbed. Mouthfeel is full, somewhat syrupy, and the carbonation is good with a nice great creaminess. The finish is relatively tame, residual fruit flavor with some dry grains and sweetness.

Reddish hues shine through, a nice white head forms and then dies quickly Smells good. Very hoppy, but not so bitter. Agressive aroma, but also some sweetness in the nose Taste is very good. The alcohol warms but is not overpowering. The hops aren't nearly as agressive in the taste, but they are certainly there. The taste is sweet, but I think it comes from the stupid amount of malt, not through a cheap, sugar addition way. Mouthfeel is good. It is thick, which is nice, but very sticky and sweet Drinkability is truly dangerous on this. I have to stop myself from not drinking more than one in a sitting.

The smell of alcohol is somewhat present too.  Taste is very sweet and syrupy. Hops aren't really that bitey, but are there for sure. Really a smooth beer all the way down. Never harsh at all. Maybe this bottle has been sitting around for awhile and tamed a bit.  Drinkability is very good when your just drinking one every once in awhile, but considering the alcohol it packs I can't give it a higher score.

Pours a muddy amber brown with a 1/2 finger creamy off-white head that will not quite die (21%, how is this possible?). Smells hot - rum-soaked caramel malts and earthy, piny hops. Resiny smelling. Nice.  Taste is quite unique. Lots of alcohol here, but I am actually enjoying it in this beer. Brandy-soaked caramel. Piny hops. Earthy, woody flavors. Lots of bitterness at the end. This beer has ridiculously strong flavors working together (and occasionally verging on fighting against each other). Hot alcohol finish as well - the hops and alcohol stay on the back of your tongue a while. What a warming beer!  Mouthfeel is immensely rich, something the carbonation never completely matches up to - this, however, ends up giving it sipping characteristics that work nicely.  Drinkability? How to rate this one? I don't know. I personally find this quite drinkable, so I shall rate it high enough.  Recommended. If you enjoy the boozy flavors in a rich DIPA, you'll enjoy this beer - or at least find it interesting.  Edit (2008-02-05) - Still love this beer. Rich sweetness and alcohol is still somehow mellowed by the hops. An exceptional 21% beer. That said, I'd guess this is best fresh or with a number of years age on it - anywhere in the middle could become too sweet I would say.

A: Amber/copper hue with some slight haze. Big slow bubbles rising to the top. Small head. A good looking beer.  S: Huge hop nose and I mean huge. All types of citrus character gives it a very sweet candy-like aroma. Really a great aroma.  T: Incredible taste, sweet with an extremely dry finish. Some coffee hints and surprisingly little hop bitterness. Some alchol taste and warming. Some grapefruit.

On first pour, it looks like an average Double IPA--deep orange and coppery colored, not a great head, but I can tell it's not flat. Then I take a whiff--again, nothing out of the ordinary here. There is an alcoholic note buried in there, under lots of malty sweetness that reminds me of dried pineapple (the real stuff, not the sugary crap), and yep, there's some hop aroma, but it's not overtly floral.  Then I take a sip...whoa, hold up a sec. Let me try that again...Wow. I was expecting something like this, but then again I wasn't expecting *this*. The carbonation starts to come out as soon as it hits my lips, then the underlying silky texture fills my mouth, while my taste buds do a boogie like we were back at a Dead show in the late 70's. There's more than enough malt to go around in this beer. Well balanced with the hops, too. It's as though the hops were stripped down to their most elemental tastes, there's no hint of overly aggressive bitterness, no light-as-air-freshener citrus like some modern DIPA's...but it's all there. Finally, there is something of a buttery, alcoholic fuzz lingering around the finish line. Hmmm.  It's not something I'll be drinking a lot of, but that's not because I don't like it.

With banana, cloves, honey, hops, plums, dates, figs, raisins, grapes, pine, grapefruit, ginger, lemon, and alcohol all working together, how can you go wrong? This is a glorious challenge for the palette, one that everyone wins with. Absolutely incredible flavor. A 5.0 might not be a good enough rating.

10099,9086,kajerm,3.74,"Bottle at Clark St. Ale House. I may as well disclose right now that I fully expect this to be cloying, over-the-top, overpriced crap.  Pours dark amber and extremely cloudy with a very thin head but ample lacing. It pretty much looks how I expect a massively-hopped but malty 21% ABV beer to look.  And it smells that way too, but in a very weird way. The ample malts are huge in the aroma, but the hops are clearly present, especially towards the bottom of the bottle. The interplay between the absurd malt, ridiculous hops, and certifialbly dnagerous alcohol creates a weird, almost Bretty funkiness. My girlfriend thought this was infected, and I really sort of see what she means.  The flavor opens up with big, sweet mixed malts and a little residual sugar. Fruity hop and yeast-derived flavors blend in from the beginning to make for a really weird taste profile. The finish is sweet and alcoholic; not at all bitter, but somehow still hoppy.  This is one fucked up beer. I think I like it.  The mouthfeel is thick and rich, very similar to Devil Dancer, but with a lot more booze.  I don't even really want to rate this for drinkability-- it's 21% ABV for christ's sake-- but if I have to, then I guess it's about a 2.5. It's horribly undrinkable for a double IPA, but spectacularly drinkable for a beer that's over 21% alcohol by volume.  Dogfish Head has cemented its place as the weirdest brewery in America and possibly the world. This is actually pretty good-- way better than that godawful Raison d'Extra or the malt-and-everclear apocalypse that is Worldwide Stout.  I really can't believe I like this, but I do.  NOTE: I wish DFH dated their beers; I really think that this one's been sitting for quite a while, because it's nothing like the hot, sickly-sweet mess that other people have described and that I was expecting.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,williamherbert,3.38,"[My scores on this beer may be misleading, because while it has a very inviting look and aroma, it's one of the most undrinkable beers I've ever had, in terms of pure enjoyment. It's one of a kind, that's for sure.]  The look is a big and hazy deep, dark orange. Nice half finger of light brown head. Looks like a thick, chunky apple cider. Lots of little carbonation bubbles. Minimal lace.  The smell gives a rich combination of flowery hops and a dark oak scent. Heavy dark berry/grape smell, curiously. Alcoholic presence is almost black licorice. Lots of oak and pine. Really dark and heavy. Slight nuttiness comes through.  OK so the taste. First, there is a major blast of alcohol. Seriously oaky. Massive (though still overshadowed) woody hops. Huge alcoholic onslaught with every sip; it's like gasoline. Seriously. An assault on the taste buds. Though there are tons of hops, I wouldn't consider it ""hoppy"" because all the hops are overshadowed by the other elements. It's like licking a wooden nightstand. I give it points for strength, power and sheer balls.  The feel is a big, thick, chunky, sandpaper feel. Not at all smooth. The true definition of a beer you have to choke down; I've had Metamucil thinner than this. A slow-sipper, not a chugger. It burns like whiskey on the way down, in the esophagus and stomach.  Drinkable? Seriously? Two in a row? I couldn't have two in a decade. It's just too extreme. (And it got me drunk fast because it's the equivalent of 4-5 ""session"" beers.) I'm glad I tried it once, but I'm unlikely to try it again.  http://jbojangles.blogspot.com/2007/08/120-minutes-of-pain.html",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Hops and malt are both present in the aroma, as is a bit of fruitiness and some alcohol. The mouthfeel is downright thick. The flavor is very sweet, almost syrupy, followed by alcohol in the end. You can pick up hops and malt in the flavor, but this is not the hop bomb many might imagine. This is a sipper, the alcohol is definitely noticeable. Not something I would drink on a regular basis, but definitely worth a try.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,DIPAbrewer,3.37,"Finally found one of these at a local liquor store. I poured the sweet hoppy brew from a 12oz bottle into a wine glass and was immediately struck by the deep resiny hop aroma. The color was deep amber with an off white head that fell into a ring around the glass and left significant lacing. Another whiff of the ale rendered even more hoppy aroma with a deep dark almost smoky note from the malt. The hop aroma was complex but pleasant and the strong alcoholic content is revealed in the nose of this formidable heavy hitter.  The first sip overwhelms with hop flavor then fades into a syrupy sweet malt taste. This is a heavy slow sipping drink. The hop flavor is resiny, piney, and vegetal. The malt is super sweet and smoky. The malt seems to outweigh the hop bitterness in my opinion, leaving this ale a little too sweet. Despite this perceived flaw this is still an excellent beer that any IPA lover should try at least once. The drinkability is low given the extreme flavor and alcohol percent. I would recommend sharing a 12 oz serving between two people. After half of this beer my taste buds felt numb and burnt out.

10099,9086,ncvbc,4.57,"Review #120. How appropriate. Thanks goes to zutmin.  Sort of a ruby orange with a hint of brown thrown in the mix. Great carbonation and a whispy white head.  Looks potent, though I already knew it was because I smelled it long before. This stuff packs a serious punch! Alcohol is quite present but so are many other wonderful scents. Huge hop presence, from pine to citrus. Caramel malts are also there and honey also adds sweetness.  Taste is crazy. It's a thick, potent flavor of enormous hops, the malts providing some backbone to this monster. A little booze is also present but actually plays well because of the resinous character of this beer. It's like drinking some hop juice with a sweet honey glaze.  Never experienced anything like the mouthfeel of this one. It was very warming. Not extremely bitter, though somewhat dry. But, wait...in comes a creamy, buttery like sensation from the alcohol like never before. Damn, this stuff is good!  Considering this is a 21% motherload of a DIPA, it's quite drinkable. I shared my bottle with a friend and we both enjoyed it from the first sip to the last. Not something that I'll be drinking on a daily or even weekly basis.

10099,9086,HoustonTX,3.55,"Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA  ""The"" Imperial India Pale Ale.  Damn, that's one sexy hop picture on the label. Wonder if it's scratch and sniff... hmm, no go. Says on the label the holy grail for hop heads, lets hope so.  Visually, this beer is absolutely amazing. What a great pour! Very dense viscosity with color swirls melding together. Body ends up a very hazy orangish-brown. Head is solid.  The aroma is very fresh smelling. Ripe fruit, aged oak, and caramel malt. A strong booziness amongst a deep layer of citric hops.  Taste is otherworldly. Enough hops to actually sting your tongue into remission. I love it! Upfront DFH 120, has a strong barleywine flavor tone. Some pleasant sweetness, that is not overwhelming and acts as the backbone for the immense hops to come. The sweetness does linger, and really only finally balances out near the end of the sip. The dry-hopping has produced some extremely nice flavor tones about midway through the sip. A deep herbacous floral mixture with sassafrase, oak, and light tobacco. The alcoholic burn/sting is relentless and does not give up.  An amazing feat of a beer. Truly unique, and definitely a beer, that not everyone can handle.    *Side notes* Hop burp after 2 sips, and it was one hell of a hop burp. This beer is worth buying just for the hop burps alone, god they just keep coming. I am already starting to feel a buzz after drinking maybe only 1/8th of the 12ozer.

I have a few 12 oz. bottles of the stuff, but I have been reluctant to open them without cellaring for a while. The beer was a dark, tawny orange with a frothy tan head that subsided kind of quickly and smelled of amber and pale malts with a layered hop character. The taste was arresting and beautiful. Caramel-y and hoppy, this is the way a Double IPA should be. It wasn't a brutal and bitter hop slap in the face the way you'd expect something boiled with hops for 2 hours and then dry-hopped for a month to be, the malts came through excellently; it was amazingly well-balanced from the hops and malts to the different varieties of hops in there. Mouthfeel also was exceptional, it was thick and chewy, coating the mouth and smooth going down despite the alcohol content.

Sweet, malty, and a bit sour. It has distinct alcoholic warmth in the finish.  M - Thick and syrupy with moderate carbonation. I little bit of astringency in the back of the mouth.  D - It is always hard to give a drinkability rateing to a beer this unreasonably strong, but overall this is a solid beer. Many ""extreme"" beers are almost undrinkable in my opinion but this goes down relatively easy, the only fault is the mouthfeel which is syrupy and a bit unpleasant.

Comes across peppery with a dull bitterness upfront before spreading out into soy, heavy caramel, earthy and green hop resinous hops. Turns a little nutty and tartly acidic on the backside ending in very spicy alcohol. Remarkably tame for 21% abv though. Body is immensely viscous, though surprisingly not nearly to the level i expected. Carbonation is low but appropriate.

Warm alcohol follows soon after swallowing but is not immediately noticable. Mouthfeel: Medium feeling beer. About what you would expect here. Drinkability: Deceptively drinkable. Tastes smooth and sweet at first, but after a few minutes, the 21% starts to make itself known. Final Thoughts: At $10 for a 12oz bottle, I would recommend a buy, but wouldn't make this a regular visitor to my fridge. Definitely prefer the 90 Minute, which has become one of my favorites.

10099,9086,Atlas1,4.15,"I've had the 120 Minute IPA several times now, and have been looking forward to reviewing it. This one is poured from a bottle with a ""bottled on"" date of 5/10/07 into a belgian style snifter. A 12oz bottle costs me $10 in the DC area.  Appears a very golden copper color with a sticky, off-white and slightly orange head. Held up to the natural light from the window the true beauty of this beer shines through; hues of ruby red and deep orange bronze shine brightly. The nose is, as could be expected with a beer of such high alcohol, boozy. But it's still attractive, because the layers of complexity filter down from there. Strong malts, powerful hops, aged dark fruit, citrus on steroids. The taste is bold and, if you're unprepared, can hit you like a mack truck. Strong alcohol presence eventually gives way to dark fruits, rich molasses, and hoppy resin. To me, it's almost like dining on an overwhelming serving of a piney butter pecan ice cream. Smooth, velvety mouthfeel. At times it's almost syrupy.  This is an intense beer and should not be taken likely; 21% ABV is hardcore for any brew. This is best served as an after-dinner drink, in my opinion, like a fine sherry or brandy. To be enjoyed in the smoking room with a cigar over a discussion of Rudyard Kipling or Ernest Hemingway. Something absurd like that.  But damn it's tasty. This one has been on the shelf for a few months, and I'm sure this sucker ages quite nicely, seeing as its alcohol level could sustain it for years. But I actually prefer the 120 Minute as fresh as possible. I think the piney/citrus notes in the hops stand out more when the beer is fresh.

The first taste brought a punch of caramel which flowed into a tropical fruit much like a pineapple then finishing quickly with hops. I expected this to be intensely hoppy but it yielded an overpoweringly sweet, thick and syrupy taste and mouthfeel with an astonishing hop balance. This DIPA (Double India Pale Ale) is definitely a sipper; very thick and heavy with little carbonation and high alcohol. Although the price seemed quite steep, one could justify it in ratio (ABV/price) to wine. The 120 minute term refers to the full two hour boil of high-alpha American hops. In addition to the full two hour boil, DFH radically dry-hops the fermenter daily for a month and then ages the brew for another month on whole-leaf hops!

I found this beer and WWS at a liquor store across the street from my hotel and promptly releaved the store of their supply of both. The owner was more than happy to sell it all to me since no one else in this neighborhood was buying them. The beer poured a hazy amber/orange color with a rather large half inch head that receded quickly. The aroma was very malty and alcoholic, with the hops hidden in there somewhere. Where are the hops? Taste was hot alcohol, extremely sweet honeyish malts and citrusy hops. The longer I sipped on it though, the hops became overwhelmed by the massive sweetness. I was expecting a hopsmack in the face and instead got kicked in the balls with an un-Godly amount of malt. Mouthfeel was very thick and sticky in the palate. One 12 oz bottle is all I can handle.

The smell is also incredible, hoppy, grapefruity, and slightly of honey.  After tasting it the sweet and honey odors are much more present and dominate the smell, making it not as great, but when I first smelled it before tasting it was incredible.  The taste is good and for the 21% abv the alcohol is surprisingly masked. The issue here, as others have noted, is that it doesn't taste hoppy or like an IPA really at all. It's just sweet and malty. The more I look at it and taste it the more it's reminding me of honey, which isn't necessarily bad but now what I was looking for here. Mouthfeel is great...for how sweet it is it's not syrupy and rolls around in the mouth quite pleasantly.  It's pretty drinkable but I won't be having more than one and I don't know if I'll drink this again, with the exception of an aged bottle perhaps. I keep hoping that one of these 20% abv beers is going to blow me away and become one of my serious go-to beers but thus far they are all just sweet and while they do have redeeming qualities they're not all that great.

However, as DFH has gotten wider distribution it's become a lot more commonplace. Needless to say, as a hophead and a fan of DFH, I was excited to try it. This is from the 12oz. bottles.  Pours a bold orange/copper, with a decent white head. Head diminishes fairly quickly. Smell is hoppy with some elements of sweetness behind it. The taste is where the sweetness dominates however. My expectation was to get smashed in the mouth by pure hops, yet the sweetness of this seems to overpower everything else. Given that it's 21 ABV, I would imagine this is to help cover the alcohol taste. My hope is that they would have really amped up the hops to add balance, but the malty sweetness just dominates. Mouthfeel is syrupy yet smooth, with a strong alcohol presence.  Drinkability for me has this as a one-off or occasional beer.

I wish it were less sweet so the bitterness and hop flavor could come out to play. I love this beer and its a great sipper after dinner but I want more out of it. I know I am asking a lot since DFH puts so much into it but a man can dream. The most impressive thing about this beer is its smoothness.

Remembering my repeatedly yammering on about how much I enjoyed DFH beers, she hands it off to me. 6 120s, 6 60s, and a handful of Punkins. Not sure how long the 120s aged, but they're the caution/exclamation point caps. --  A: Poured from the bottle into my Duvel Tulip. A 1-finger head with a fair amount of staying power leaves a very sticky lacing. Held up to the light it's a deep orange/brown with a bit of a ruby hint in the background.  S: On top of a base of a malty carmel, there's a strong, but not overpowering, hops smell of orange and other citrus.  T: Ahh, here we've got it... Starts with a bit of that carmely malt, but that's just a palate to paint the tasty hops flavors on top. The hops open with that citrus that you smelled. It's followed with a piney hops, but what's interesting is the way the flavors blend. It doesn't feel like two separate tastes, but they move into each other. The bitterness isn't overwhelming, but it fairly well balanced.  How can a beer this strong not have too much alcohol burn? It's definitely alchoholic, and you can taste it, but it doesn't kill the flavor, just encourages you to savor it like a nice bourbon.  M: This might be the closest thing to a weakness for this beer. It's still good, the alchohol makes itself known through the mouthfeel. It's a bit heavy, but it coats the mouth well. It's not strongly carbonated, but in the middle of the taste, tied with the piney hoppiness you feel like you're missing a bit.  D: This is a toughie to judge on drinkability. Compared with your average IPA, this isn't refreshing or exceptionally drinkable, but with the wonderful flavor, and especially with the high alcohol content, it's remarkably easy to drink. It drinks more like a good barley wine, so that's what I'll judge it on here, in which case, it's exceptionally easy to drink.  Overall -- I love this beer. It's the beer that I compare great beer with, but with all the great beer in the world, what do you need to pay $9.00 for a 12oz bottle for.

M: Moderate to full body is slightly syrupy, modest carbonation, hop acidity.  D: It's a sipper.  I'd say it's closer to a barley wine.

10099,9086,Gump,3.37,"12oz bottle, $8 Woodman's Madison, WI.  Cloudy amber, thick mouthfeel and smells like laundry detergent. Incredible hop taste, sweet pine, leaves sugary taste on my lips, like a candy. Very sweet and super strong. The aroma isn't as strong as the taste. I know I should be sipping this one, but it's going down very well. I have one more bottle, which I plan to age. That might be difficult. Drinkability: Drink this one slow.  --- one year later re-review --- Aged for one year in my basement. A beautiful orange color with slight cloudiness. Dense white foamy head that turns clumpy eventually settling out.  Mild rubbing alcohol aroma. Thick mouthfeel leaves a lingering sweetness on my lips. Bitter fruit flavors and tartness can be detected if you can get past the strong alcohol flavor. Let it just sit in your mouth for awhile.  Intense heat once the air combines with it.  Dry apple aftertaste. Sip slowly.  Aging one year didn't mellow this out much at all. The most intense alcohol flavor I've ever had from a beer. Personally I'd rather pay for the 60 or 90 min, but I'm glad I had the opportunity to try this one.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,wspscott,3.92,"12oz bottle in pint glass  A: Gorgeous amber/gold color with a thin white head. The head disappears quickly and leaves a small amount of lace. S: Holy crap, this is incredible. A massive burst of citrus hops hits immediately. T: My wife described this as apricots soaked in grain alcohol :) I think this is a huge mouthful of malts and american hops. It comes across as very sweet/malty at first and then the hops. M: It doesn't come across as thick but, it is very mouth-coating. The carbonation helps balance the malt but, it only helps a bit. D: Like most Dogfish beers, this is a very interesting beer and I am glad I tried it but, I don't think I will pick up another of these. In the end, this is just too over the top for me. I like most/all double IPAs but this has too much of a malt backbone.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,becktone,4,"Eye: Dark cloudy orange amber in appearance. This beer has great head retention and lacing. Head is creamy in appearance. Overall good though I would have thought it wouldn't be as cloudy.  Nose: Spicy and floral hop notes are right up front in this brew. Also has a good strong sweet malt backbone. Given that this brew is up there in abv, I'll say that it is hidden pretty damn well in the aroma. Even though it is noticeable, unless I knew this were about 20% I'd guess it were about 7%. Was expecting something a bit more ""in your face.""  Tongue: Bittering hops make themselves know right up front. Malt flavors slightly balance this brew out then again are swallowed by floral and spicy hop flavors. Alcohol is evident, giving a warming sensation as it goes down.  Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Good medium bodied mouthfeel with lower carbonation levels give this beer a good mouthfeel. Warms a bit as it goes down. This beer also ends with a bitter taste and feel, making the mouth water, making one want more. The beer is great, I'd definitely drink it again, though at about $8.50 a bottle its a little steep. Sure its good, but I don't think one could drink this all night, if you can and you have the dollars to roll like that more power to you. However, once a person has had two to three of these I think that drinking such an expensive and high class beer would be a waste. I wouldn't want to waste this beer by drinking it when I am drunk, or getting there.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,mrasskicktastic,4.53,"Bottled 12/18/06  A - A thick, monsterous head sits atop a hazy amber brew. The lacing thin, yet densely populating the sides of the glass. This is the first beer over 15% that has had any lacing to speak about.  S - Smell is awesome! Caramel with a touch of molasses. Black licorice, grapefruit and pine.  T - Molasses. I really figured I would say hops first, but it is definitely molasses. Absurdly sweet with anise and caramel then comes some spicy pepper and grapefruit flesh. Aftertaste is a surprisingly mild bitterness. This would age absurdly well, but now I really want to try this fresh.  M - Thick, like swishing yogurt in your mouth, there is a lot of residue, in spite of this it is actually a little refreshing. A huge amount of warming in the aftermath.  D - Here it gets docked. It is too strong. I will definitely have again. Probably this week since my favorite beer bar is getting it in soon.  This is my 500th review.

10099,9086,TexIndy,2.83,"Poured from a 12oz bottle with a laser bottled on date on the label. This one is 6 months old. Poured a copper orange color. Was very hazy with a ton of yeast floating around. It had a good head that slowly settled into a constant film. Good lacing. The aroma was very hoppy as expected but shared the limelight with a heavy sweet syrupy smell. Could tell from the smell that it was gonna be too sweet and I was right. Expected an insanely hopped ADIPA and instead get a overly sweet syrup with some hops in the back. It's a mess and not very enjoyable. Love ADIPA's lately but hated this one.

10099,9086,tanarm,4.58,"Poured into a snifter and received a real nice head that stuck strong for a few minutes. Beautiful copper tone on this one. Once the head settles out, a little ring is left and the foam just sticks to the sides. No visible chunks on the first pour but not completely clear either.  The aroma is very floral and sweet like nectar. Fruity hop tones come through nicely. Orange peel...  The taste: Surprisingly sweet... Fruity and floral hop notes dance with the sweet maltiness. Sour oranges. Fresh green herbal notes. A touch of cough syrup. Biscuit. Caramel. The finish is complex with hops and dries the palate, leaving you wanting more. A nice warmth from the ethanol on the roof of the mouth is there but not overpowering. The carbonation plays an important role here, leaving a dry, crisp finish.  Dangerously drinkable! This one was bottled just over a month ago, and is much hoppier than I remember the last one I had, which must have been quite aged. This one is quite hoppy, but very balanced with the sweetness and the alcohol. I am stocking up on this batch!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

It smells like citrus and pine hops, caramel and a bit of brandy. The taste starts off very sweet and finishes slightly bitter. I can taste hops (both pine and citrus), caramel, apricots, brandy, and some spices. The alcohol is very well hidden considering it's 21% ABV, and it does pack a punch later. Mouthfeel is full, syrupy and oily. Drinkability is good, although this is definitely a sipping beer. It's nice and smooth and easy to drink. Overall I think this is a well balanced brew.

10099,9086,kwakwhore,4.4,"April 2008 bottle. Fresh is the way to drink this beer. the hoppiest of the three bottles I've reviewed on here. Get this beer fresh to experience the hops. Alcohol is a little hotter too. 2007 Pours a hazy reddish orange into my DFH snifter. Smallish head which dissipates quickly. Piny hoppy scent which doesn't leave much room for anything else. The level of hops in the aroma promises a severe shredding of taste buds, but the flavor is a lot more balanced than you might guess. Sweet malt balances and almost overpowers the citrus of the hops. The alcohol is well hidden for such strong beer but hits pretty hard a few minutes later. As the beer warms the hops become more pronounced. A truly unique beer, one I look forward to every year. This is the May 2007 release and I think that my other bottles will benefit from six months of cellaring as this seems a bit rough around the edges compared to some other years. July 1 One month later and I had another bottle from the same 4 pack. It is already much smoother. The malt is actually more prominent than the hops. Candied fruits, sugars are up front now.

10099,9086,BassAssassin,4.13,"--2007 Vintage--  A: Pours a deep reddish amber. Appearance is cloudy due to bottle conditioning. Off-white head is thin and dissipates rather quickly.  S: Smells of leafy, grassy hops mixed with alcohol. Not terribly complex regarding the smell. Slight dried fruit aromas emerge as the beer warms up.  T: Huge hop presence. In fact, the first sip is all hops: leafy, grassy, and herbal. However, there is plenty of malt to balance. The malt flavors are sweet, reminiscent of dried raisins. Strong rummy, boozy alcohol character is very apparent, but complements the malt and hops quite nicely. Finishes surprisingly clean. Taste is significantly more complex than the smell.  M: Full bodied and quite smooth. Perfect amount of carbonation. Rounded mouthfeel.  D: Very easy to drink for such a huge beer. However, it's a sipper for sure.

Pours a cloudy red amber-gold with a dense milky tan head that retains well and leaves solid lace.  A really great aroma as well. Fruit (light/dark), citrus, peach, spice, and some hops. A honey-like sweetness and a bit of alcohol.  This American Double IPA has massive flavor. Robust and formidable. Wonderfully and complex. A variable whirlwind of flavors all over the palate. The initial sweetness is that of orange blossom honey and light molasses, but intensifies to more resemble pure cane sugar. Caramel and hops. Nice hops. Almost syrupy, with notes of candied fruits. A nice bite on the front of the tongue and citrus toward the back. Stunning.  The texture is smooth and thick leaving a coating on the palate. Heavenly warmth. Even and decadent. There is a distinct alcohol presence but its difficult to comprehend that this beer has a 21% abv.  Definitely a beer to sip and savor. And savor it you will. One on my all time favorites.

Not much of a head and it's certainly a heavy brew. The flavor, this is nectar for the elites palate. Big fruit, with some honey like sweetness. Lingering flavor of hops and pine. The flavor invades every nerve in your mouth. Criminey, 21%!?!?! Geez, 2 sips and I can already feel a buzz.

10099,9086,ccrida,4.31,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle (12/18/06) into a snifter, the 120 is a gorgeous hazy amber, with a 2 finger olive tinged egg-shell head that left sticky lace.  The smell is weird, strong and sweet but funky, a little off-putting at first, medicinal, sherry and some cinnamon, a bit like sour candy. Very unusual, and ultimately, strangely attractive.  Whoa, this sucker is one crazy beer, unlike any other. Thick sweet malt is tempered by a nice hop bittereness, although no hop aroma or flavor per say, just this really malty, almost candy like flavor. Surprisingly, this is not as hot or ethanol tasting as some 10-12% beers can be, although there's not fulling it's a booze bomb, but in a more visceral way. Or like a drug that takes a bit to kick in!  The mouthfeel, well, is actually much lighter then you might fear, and even though it's a sweet beer, it's not syrupy or a sugar bomb, a la Burton Banton, and is really well done.  As for drinkabilty, what can I possibly compare this to?? It's a +20% ABV IPA, so of course it's a really slow sipper. Nevertheless, the 120min IPA is a beer drinking experience like no other.

10099,9086,MiguelMandingo,3.92,"This was the very first Dogfish Head beer I tried when I first began my beer tasting hobby. It took me an hour and a half to finish, as I was not prepared for the HUGE flavor this beer packs. It turned me away from Dogfish Head for awhile. That was until someone coaxed me into trying a 90 Minute IPA. I loved it and I have tried several other DFH since then but haven't returned to the 120 Minute...until now. As it turns out the problem was my palate because, damn, this is a good beer.  Poured a 12oz. bottle into a tulip glass.  Appearance - Peach tan with a one finger head that dissipates into a foam halo on the beer's surface. A quick swirl of the glass brings the head right back.  Smell - Alcohol - and lots of it! At 21%ABV this is the most potent brew I have ever sampled. It certainly makes an appearance in the smell. I also smell caramel and hops. Overall, it smells very rich - a good indication of what it will taste like. The smell becomes a lot more apparent as the brew comes to room temperature.  Taste - Almost like the 90 Minute, just heavier on the sweet side and the hops side (obviously). The alcohol isn't as apparent in the flavor as much as it is in the smell and the mouthfeel. The alcohol makes its main appearance in the throat as it goes down. It has the sweet malty front taste followed by hop bitterness. It has a very balanced flavor - something I was surprised by.  Mouthfeel - Smooth. Perfect carbonation level. Oily with warming alcohol as it slides down the throat.  Drinkability - I would never be able to drink more than one of these, but if a second was offered to me...you never know. I would probably be too tipsy to refuse. The fact that you would be plastered after the second is why I gave this brew an average score on drinkability. I was pretty tipsy 3/4 of the way through it. But it went down smoother than a lot of other beers that I have sampled that were less than 21%ABV.  This beer is a hell of an experience. Perhaps the most accessible high ABV brews out there - definitely not for the faint of heart. It still takes me an hour and a half to finish one, but I appreciate every sip.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Wow, what an aroma! It smells of solvent alcohol and hops mixed with caramel. It's like nothing I've smelled before.  The taste is sweet with massive flavors of alcohol, leaving a strong warming in the throat after the swallow. There is a powerful citrus flavor that becomes apparent after several swallows.  The body is super smooth, thanks to the super-high ABV.  Overall this is a special occasion beer. Its qualities are so extreme that it's hard for me to compare it or judge it fairly. It reminds me of Avery's The Beast Grand Cru and their Samael's ale.  If you like strong beers, you need to have 120 Minute IPA.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Durge,3.8,"Bottled 12/18/06. It pours with authority, a hefty sound and reasonable head that quickly dissipates to an even, thin blanket of white. The aroma starts strong with a bitterness suggesting grapefruit, very crisp. Give it a little longer and there's a hint of sweetness, cherry perhaps. The appearance is a beautiful golden brown with plenty of floating goodies suspended evenly throughout. The first roll onto the tongue is startlingly thick and sweet. Tangy at the tip of the tongue and a heavy apricot rolls to the back of your mouth. This is strong stuff and proves itself quickly as it warms its way to your belly. By the third or fourth swallow you feel like your mouth has been converted to a new level of thinking and the dark cherry bitter-sweetness reveals itself with authority. This is obviously quality stuff but probably a bit too much ale for my palate. It stays tasteful at the front but overwhelms me a bit at the finish. I added a little mild cheddar cheese to this taste experience which was a nice pairing, but for me this definitely demands thoughtful sipping. It definitely holds its carbonation as ten minutes into this glass the head looks as good as it did a minute after the pour and the bubles still sizzle on the tongue. There is some degree of an oak overtone here as the flavor matures over the long haul. But this is still some strong stuff, I imagine somewhat an acquired taste for most. Taking it slowly I found that as it went closer to room temperature it seemed a bit tamer to the tongue, more manageable so to speak. I will need to try this again, hard for me to rate as a relative neophyte. But it is quite a taste sensation and a heavy brew to ponder! This won't be my favorite Dogfish brew but I have good faith that it is another quality offering for those fans of this variety. However you shake it, it is impressive.

S: After sampling the 90 minute IPA, I was expecting a more aggresive smell. Very sweet, a lot of hops but nothing overly aggressive. Pine, some citrus. T: Very, very, very sweet up front with the hops kicking in shortly after. Pretty well balanced for something this strong. A lot going on here: pine, citrus, dark fruit, earth. M: Thick, moderate carbonation. D: I've kept my eye out for this beer for a while now, I was expecting something very bitter and I got something very sweet. Don't get me wrong, it's a great beer, so good that I didn't mind paying $9.99 for a single 12oz bottle at Marty's Liquors in Allston (is it normally this expensive?).

The aroma is reminiscent of fresh hops. Theres a little fruit as well, and lots of pine, grapefruit, flowers, and herbs. Its a heady smell for sure. Surprisingly, the smell doesnt broadcast the alcohol as Id expect. The taste is sweet, yet balanced. Theres a lot of everything, but nothing is truly overwhelming. Theres a bit of warming, and you do feel the alcohol after a bit, but its taste is folded into the flavor of the beer. Fairly smooth, the beer is moderately heavy.

The aroma comes off as strong and hoppy with some alcohol aroma as well. The taste is, how do I describe, warm and alcohol-ish but tastes of caramel toffee in the back of my throat. Hops are somewhat subdued but the beer has a sweet, syrupy consistency to it. Definitely a sipping beer!  Overall, I enjoy it.

10099,9086,John_M,4.2,"I have reviewed this beer previously, but from a 750 ml. bottle. However, that was a while back, and according to the DFH rep at Max's last night, they have tweaked the recipe a bit the last few years (whatever that means). In any event, the beer I had last night was so superior to what I had out of the bottle last, they might as well have been two different beers.  The draft version pours a beautiful orange amber color, with decent foam retention and great lacing. The beer smells very sweet, but there is noticeable citrus from the hops as well. On the palate the beer is sweet, with a cornucopia of cherry, currents, raisans, pineapple and other tropical fruit. However, unlike the bottle version I had, all of sudden there is a huge wash of hops that pounds through the sweetness. Nevertheless, this beer is still viscuous, rich, smooth and long, but with refreshing citrus in the finish from the hops.  The abv. is certainly still noticeable, and there's no way you can drink a lot of this (who'd want to) or drink it too quickly. Definitely a sipper... and a beer where the abv. becomes increasingly noticeable as it warms and sits in the glass. Still, an excellent beer.

10099,9086,3Vandoo,4.5,"I am in love, what can I say, hops juice, hoppy beer, hophead's beer, well there was enough hops in one sip to hops all of Coors Light's decade production and even if it was extreme, I did like alot. The bottle was bottled three months ago and considering the amount of hops and alcohol content, it was quite fresh.  Burgundy in color, with a foamy head that came out to say ""hey"" and dissapeared right away. Shy striking golden lights all around the beer, not bad.  Smell is well guess what: hoppy, did I mention hops a billion times so far. It is floral, piney, grassy, name it, I love it.  Taste is citroneus, malty, rich malted caramel flavours followed by a floral big rich hoppy flavours.  wonderfull bring, when the 240min IPA",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Westsidethreat,4.32,"I dont know how old this bottle is. There is an 05 imprinted into the glass, thats the only thing that could shed some light on it.  A: Gorgeous toffee colored brew with a lot of haze. Head is quite small but present, a light beige color.  S: Extremely doughy with vanilla, butterscotch, old orange rinds and black pepper.  T: Begins with caramel, drambuie and toffee at the front of the tongue. Butterscotch/vanilla swagger across the palate next with super concentrated orange marmalade, honey and blood orange flavors. The flavors intensify after the swallow and linger for what seems like minutes. Alcohol vapors go shooting through the nasal cavity, bringing with them citrusy notes. Finishes with a bitterness that goes the distance and a marshmallow taste that wont leave my mouth.  M: Full bodied and smooth with only a touch of syrup qualities.  D: This is a ginormous beer. Theyve avoided it being too syrupy, which is surprising for the alcohol content. Definitely worth checking out. I wish I had a guaranteed fresh bottle to sample.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,blsfreak,4.72,"Thanks to JonMyers for the 2003 vintage, what a great birthday present!!!  Pours a cloudy amber, no lacing or obvious head, very little carbonation.  Smells sweet, very little hop aromas  Tastes amazing, not what I expected from an IPA at all. Sweet, smooth taste, very little noticable alcohol taste till it warms up a bit.  Sticky, sweet more like a liqueur than a beer mouthfeel.  I would not want to drink two or three of these, the high ABV would hurt anyone, but overall a great beer. One of those sipping on Sunday, cooking out beers to enjoy slowly. Being the hophead I am, I was a bit disappointed at the lack of over the top hops, which is what I have come to expect from American IPAs and IIPAs. Having not tried a fresher vintage, I have nothing to compare the 2003 vintage to, but this is an amazing beer....well done, Sam!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,boelker62,4.12,"A - Pure amber perfection in a glass. Make sure it is poured into the proper glassware, and take in the beauty. Lazy, hazy head that goes away as there is no significant carbonation. It sheds a brilliant sparkle of what I see as pure onto the table or couner around it.  S - with many IPA's there is not too much to pull off the top, however, this beauty from Sam and crew really gives you ALL senses with which to work. Without the first sip, or knowing what the ABV is, you can smell the density and gravity of this crafted ale.  T - where to begin? I will leave out all the adjectives, and tell you it's great. Take it slow, move it around to different parts of your mouth and tongue. That's where the differences lie. Go ahead, do the ""aficionado"" thing, just don't spit! 20% ABV and sweet. There are likely 1000 different hints to this, so go get some, and discover it.  M/D - man is this heavy, appropriately so. A significantly oily feel, it wants to go down easily, and can, but you know this ain't your grandpa's beer, so enjoy.  For anyone who likes anything over 50 IBU's, this is a must try. It is really out there for most people, I am sure. As the 60 Minutes is supposedly 60 IBU's and the 90 Minute, 90. One would think...but it is very smoothed out.

10099,9086,Backer2004,4.6,"Received two bottles of the 120 in a trade with zutmin. Cellared one and tried the other out tonight. Expectations were met, if not exceeded. Nice orange hue with a half inch head. Smells of fresh hops, fruit, candy. Taste the same, with a nice grape-citrus finish. Though alcohol was apparent, the hops balanced it out. Definitely can tell this is the highest gravity beer I tried after the first half of glass. Easy enough to finish and really enjoyed every ounce. Not for everyone, but my palate is finally to the point to appreciate this. Another hit by Dogfish head.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,yelterdow,4.42,"2004 Edition, cellared longer than anything else I've ever kept. After sampling this on tap in 2004, I picked up this lone 12 oz. bottle and decided to save it for a special occasion, the right moment.  Here's that special moment, and I am commemorating nothing at all.  Served in Dogfish Head's beautiful oversize brandy snifter at cellar temperature.  Appearance- Pours an almost perfectly clear whisky orange, carrying a small but sticky bone white head that winds up randomly decorating the inside edge of my glass. Alcohol content aside, this looks like it should be a fun ride.  Smell- Initially, the burst of air that wafted out of this bottle truly smelled of an English Old Ale... notes of leather and 19th century hardcover books, notably. Now, in the glass, we've got a fully integrated hop beast that has engaged its malts and just simply smells *enormous*. Fat and deep, and in wonderful balance aromatically.  Taste- All I can say is... *wow*... amazing... what a sublime example of what a fully mature, impeccably crafted beer could be. At first, the tongue receives a sweet, honey-like hop flavor that spreads gently across its surface. It then transforms to a chewy, rich, vintage quality that showcases a beautiful malt character along with the hops. Three + years of aging has all but eliminated any potential alcohol heat, as I swear this is drinking smoother than I ever would have expected. The finish goes on for days, the hop bitterness rich and complex, like an old wise man with a century's worth of wisdom.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Slick and smooth, easy down the throat and taking the obligatory back seat to a phenomenal flavor profile. This beer has provided an unforgettable tasting that I'm extremely thankful for, and I must give Andy's Corner Bar in Bogota another round of applause for having this on tap three years ago where I made the decision to grab one for the road. And DFH, way to go... this one certainly stood the test of time.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,tempest,4.15,"Bottled 12/18/05  Wow, the drinkability really surprised me here. It was a sipper, but a fine one for the alcohol. I guess its had some time to mellow, but still. The boozey flavors were very low with estery malts and and fruit punch hops flavor. I remarked to a friend that it tasted like ""hops candy."" Its not the richest or most complex beer, but its good and its different.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,dedge85,4.48,"Appearance: Dark golden brown with a small amount of head.  Smell: Caramel and malty  Taste: Delicious!! This definately hit the spot. Think and syrappy and even hoppy.  Mouthfeel: Tons of flavor hitting every part of the mouth.  Drinkability: A little hard to drink which is why you have to sip it.  I know that a lot of people say that this beer is overkill, but i wish that they would make a 150 min IPA because I think that it was a little bit too easy to drink!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,barleyman,3.25,"Poured from the brown glass 12 oz bottle into my straight sided tumbler. Appearance is a cloudy medium brown with good initial head receding into a faint one. Smell is of citrus mainly, with a hop undertone. Taste is of raisins and clove, hops and citrus with a strong hop finish. Mouthfeel is quite complex, more so than most beers out there. Drinkability is limited, one would do most people. Overall, a bit over the top in my opinion.  Just a thought,  barleyman",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,jasonjlewis,3.7,"Decent head that stays around for a while. Pured into a tulip glass.  Nice hoppy smell with some malts on the nose as well, mainly caramel malts.  Decent taste, Decent hoppiness that is overshadowed by extreeme sweetness and maltiness.  Mouthfeel is decent and thick, but the maltiness takes away from crispness. Syrupy in mouthfeel.  For a 21% alcohol beer it's not that hard to drink, but the extreme thickness and sweetness of the malt make drinking more than a couple of these a chore.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,joeysmokedporter,3.57,"Poured a 12 oz bottle into a Chimay goblet.  A: Pours a cloudy pale amber, very little head formation although a constant ring around the glass throughout consumption.  S: Aroma is a mixture of alcohol, malt, and citrus fruit. Reminds of scotch with the addition of grapefruit-like citrus aroma.  T: Starts with acidic, sweet grapefruit flavor, moves into hoppy bitterness and ends with an alcoholic bitter note that lingers for awhile. Lots of hops evident in this brew, but balanced with the fruity/malty flavors. This beer reminds me of a slightly stronger Old School Barley Wine (also by DFH), with similar flavor profiles although quite a bit sharper.  M: a little syrupy, with an expected heaviness although it is still quite light for a 20% ABV beer. Almost sticky.  D: For its strength this is a surprisingly drinkable beer. Given the ABV I was expecting something closer to a scotch or whiskey, but the balance of alcohol to the rest of the drink was about on par with wine. Although this is a quite bitter beer I would probably serve this with a dessert because the fruity sweet flavor seems to strike me more. Not something I would drink regularly, but certainly worthwhile to pull out for a special occasion, or if I can find a good food match.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,mymrnngjckt,3.19,"I had a bottle of this at Coopers a few weeks ago. This beer needs to sit and cellar for a long time before it is even drinkable. Perhaps if it was store in a cave like the one from the move ""Deep Impact"" it would be more enjoyable after 300 years.  It look golden and hazy. Almost murchy.  It smelled like heat. Seriously, the smell had an overwhelmiing hotness to it.  It tasted like burning.  It didn't stay long in my mouth so I couldn't give a good review of the mouthfeel. I was in such a hurry to swallow it because I was afraid my tounge would burst into flames.  I can't imagine going to a bar and ordering this and enjoying it. Perhaps if global warming were actually real and I needed to hide from the impending ice age I would drink this to warm me up. Since global warming isn't real, I guess I will never have to drink another one again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,flexabull,4.45,"I got two of these courtesy of two great BAs. (drseamus and nathan15) Thanks guys! I figured I would drink one now, and one later.  I heard about this beer about 3 years ago, and have always wanted to try it. I am a total hop head, but I had a feeling that at 21% ABV, that this one wouldn't be all that hoppy... let's see.  I poured this into an oversized Riedel wine glass. It poured a nice slightly cloudy orange color, with a great looking white head.  Aromas are very biting on the nose. Super charged alcoholic fruits, and some pine notes as well.  First sip... wow! If you set this in front of me, I would have never guessed this was a 21%!!! ABV beer. I would have said at least half that amount. There is a surprising light flavor to this beer. It doesn't really bog you down with huge overbearing flavors. It is big, no doubt about it. But it doesn't wack you over the head with any particular flavors. It has a sweety creamy undertone to the first sip, the beer then settles into a bitter hoppy finish, that does give you a bit of a jolt from the alcohol. But it's not overwhelming. This is a wonderful beer.  Mouthfeel is exceptional. This is so full bodied, and well crafted. The beer really coats your mouth nicely.  Drinkability? Well... one and done for sure with this beast. But this is a special beer, and I am really glad I got to try it. I was skeptical about aging this at first... (I prefer double IPAs fresh) But this isn't really a double IPA. It's really more like a super alcohol hop charged barleywine. I think the other bottle is going to sit for a while. I also think this will stay on my wants list. Well done Dogfish Head!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Pineapple, some subtle floral scents, and alcohol present in the smell.  Malt taste is doughy. Citrus fruit from the hops dominate the taste, but there is some less-obvious fruity sweetness.  The beer is quite complex and rather drinkable considering the ABV.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,IntriqKen,3.53,"Really pretty clear golden orange in the glass with surprisingly larger head than you would expect with a beer this big. White head melts quickly but never goes away...remains a sticky ring all the way down the glass.  Aromas are fruity, tropical, and piney.  A definite sipper. Flavors are intensely sweet tropical candy and alcohol with a lot of pine oils that sort of stick to your tongue.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Metalmonk,4.75,"Bottled 12/18/06  A beautiful beer: lots of bubbles swimming inside a toasted rust/copper glow. Small head, but you would expect that at 21%. Poured into a tulip glass, and the head stuck around longer than expected, fed by an amazing number of bubbles. Lace is thick and ever-present.  Aroma is one-of-a-kind. Big juicy pine essence, fragrant, flowery, orange-y...not at all nostril-flaring. Kept perfectly in check. One of the purest hop aromas you'll experience, aside from standing in a field of the stuff.  Flavor is as delicious as the first one I ever had, and as illuminating as all the others that have come since. It's remarkable how well the big hops and big alcohol are balanced against a hefty malt backbone. The hops are sticky, juicy, succulent, even a bit spicey and spikey, but well-balanced against a sweet malt that feels lightly toasted. 21% alcohol makes this a sipper, no doubt, but we've all had beers with half the ABV that were ridiculously hot and out-of-whack. This is not.  Mouthfeel is thick and creamy, utterly smooth, and luckily no pastiness in the mouth. Feels (and tastes) like a big ol' barleywine in some ways. Perfect.  Drinkability for a beer like this should be considered relative to similar beers. I doubt another 21% beer with such insane hoppiness could be made to be as luscious and enjoyable as this. And no significant weaknesses either. In a league of its own...one of the best freakin' beers in the world.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,prototypic,3.65,"Bottled on 12/18/06  Appearance: Pours a slightly hazy, copper color with a one and a half finger head. Head was retained nicely and left a really nice coat of lace.  Smell: Very sweet smell. Hops are really strong. Nice pine aroma. Citrus notes add to the sweetness (grapefruit and orange). Surprisingly, I cannot pick up any scent of alcohol.  Taste: Sugary, sweet taste is the first thing to note. This is a sweet beer. Grapefruit taste adds to the sweetness. After that rush, there's a bitter hop kick to it. It's balanced out a little by the malty taste, but it's still pretty bitter. Again, alcohol is hard to detect. It's blended extremely well for such a high abv.  Mouthfeel/Drinkability: This is pretty heavy and syrupy. I'm sipping it. Due to the 21% abv, I'd be extremely hard pressed to drink more than one. Drinkability is extremely limited. Overall, it's a good beer. Definitely extreme and pushing the envelope. Recommended.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,klewis,4.53,"Thanks to markgugs for this one. 12 oz. bottle  A: Pours a clear golden with a small bubbly head and small bubbles of carbonation that fight their way to the surface. The head quickly subsides to a frothy ring and leaves spots of lacing.  S: Nice smell with both malt and hop characteristics like a barleywine. Sweet-smelling aromas of candy sugar and floral hops. Not even a trace of alcohol in the nose.  T: Like the smell, the taste is simultaneously malty and hoppy. Very well-balanced with a complex flavor. Again, little of any sign of alcohol in the flavor.  M: Thick and syrupy with just the right amount of carbonation. It's here that the alcohol makes its presence known with an intense heat that makes me warm and fuzzy after just a few sips.  D: An amazingly smooth and tasty sipping beer.

Nose is hoppy, fruity, honey, malty, and sweet. Flavor is all of that and more of the very ripe fruit, yeasty, and big honey. Alcohol is definitely there, but not as noticeable as the actual strength would suggest. Looong sweet finish. Big beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,oakbluff,3.88,"2003 edition I've been holding onto this one for awhile- somewhat scared to drink it. Finally, after an exceptionally long work week I said to hell with it. Down the hatch  Pours out quite clear with a golden hue. Not much head to speak of- lacing was decent but thats about it. The nose is sweet with minor hops in the background. Taste is in a nut shell- lapping up lquid malt extract. Holy shit that's sweet! Boozy, huge caramel malts with some breadiness with a hint o' hops in the background trying to sneak through. Given that this is four years old, I think I would prefer a fresher version that has more hop presence. The sweet malts are just too much in the aged bottle. There is some bitterness on the tail end which helps the finish of this beer immensely. The hops that are there lend more of a resiny quality than anything else, but given the age I was expecting a hop aroma bomb. I am very happy I had a chance to try this monster and if given the chance would love to try a fresh bottle.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

A hint of candy/medicine smell and some peppery alcohol notes become more noticeable as it warms.  Very sweet flavor with more fruity, hoppy, almost candy-like characteristics. A touch of alcohol burn and warmth with some nice hop bitterness in the finish. Sweetness is not overpowering, and the alcohol warmth just gives it a nice dimension.  Thick, syrupy mouthfeel but the good carbonation keeps it pretty drinkable. Hides the huge alcoholic strength very well.

Taste consists of apricots and pear with a pleasant bitterness cutting through the thick sweet mouthfeel. Sticky sweetness cut with a tinge of bitterness coats the mouth in the aftertaste. Wonderful. Age has done this beer some good. I love it fresh, but with a few years on it, it takes on a very smooth barlywine character.

The appearance is amazing .. lots of bubbles on the side of glass when poured , a very strong color orange and hardly no foam on top.  The smell is goot as well kinda like hoppy citrus with a bunch of alcohol.  Taste is kinda overpowering at 1st , very spicy hoppy pine smell with that alcohol kick. 90 min x 3.  Mouthfeel isnt the glory of this beer, the alcohol makes it tough and very carbonated in some way as well.  I would truely drink alot of these beers for some reason, the taste makes it very easy to drink and you kinda forget about the 21% in it after a while.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Blakaeris,3.58,"Reviewing a 2006 version.  Pours golden-apricot with a foamy white head that dissipates quickly leaving only slight lacing.  Smell is bitter citrus hop and comparatively mild caramel malt sweetness. However, everything is eclipsed by the strong alcohol sting.  Taste is not what I had expected from the nose. Strangely, it reminds me of a screwdriver. Sweet and citrusy, with stinging solvent like alcohol. Caramel malt is present but completely overwhelmed. Citrus sweetness turns slightly sour in the finish. Lingering alcohol burn.  Mouthfeel is full and chewy. Generous hop oil.  This is unlike any IPA that I have had the chance to enjoy. It will definitely need some time in the cellar to mature. The alcohol sweetness is a little overwhelming. Definitely a sipper.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,bashiba,4.1,Reiviewing a 2006 bottle.  Poured a dark hazy orange with a long lasting and sticky short off white head.  Smell is sweet malts mixing into a big green juniper hop odor.  Taste has a huge sweet alcohol taste mixing into a big and bold citrus and juniper hop taste. There is almost no hop bitterness at all.  Mouthfeel has a heavy oil like quality along with a big and lingering alcohol heat.  Shockingly easy to drink for the high ABV.

More orange in color and suprising amount of pinapple in the nose. Excellent head retention as well as a modest to decent amount of lace. First time I've ever had it and went right out the next week and procured some for home. Definitely NOT a beginner beer!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,beertastegood,4.25,"Second try. Can't remember much about my first review other than it was not at all what I was expecting.  Pours a deep orangey gold with a surprisingly large head, considering the alcohol content. Head fades slowly. This beer has legs!  Aroma: intensely resiny, piney, with a grassy floral note to it - like grapefruit and fresh pine sap. Slight mintiness to it. Alcoholic - not solvent, but strong alcohol aroma. A moderate amount of caramel-like maltiness in the background. The hop aroma is not what you would find in your average DIPA - powerful but not rough.  Taste: Hop flavor is the word(s?) here. This beer has hop bitterness, to be sure. But there is a lot of malt, a lot of alcohol, and consequently a lot of residual sugars to make for a huge sweet malty backbone. But the hop flavor is showcased here - wonderful pine/lemon/peach flavors that meld into the slightly fruity and over-the-top maltiness. Finishes slightly sweet, but with enough bitterness to stop it from being cloying - coats the mouth with a hoppy glaze.  Mouthfeel: Thick, creamy body and medium carbonation make this beer slide down your throat - in a good way.  Drinkability: Well, it is DFH 120...don't expect this to be way up there. But as far as ~20% beers go, this one is pretty damn good. Their Raison D'Extra is the only one that will top it, IMO.  Don't get me wrong. This is much more like a liqueur than a beer. But if I had to drink liqueur instead of beer, sign me up for this one! I think I appreciate this beer for what it is now, rather than trying to cram it into the IPA category. This beer is in a class by itself.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

From a brown 12oz. longneck bottle with a cool label and (fluorescent) green bottlecap, pours a bright apricot orange-amber with some haze and an inch of white fluffy head. The head fizzles down to some surface foam and leaves some serious sticky thick lace behind. There is no freshness date on the label but it does mention that it Ages Well...I'm sure it does!  It smells very sweet and ""Malt Liquor"" like with a peppery alcohol and hop juicy background...very interesting.  The taste starts super sweet and malty and then..slam, hot and peppery alcohol and abundant hopping take it away, but only for a brief moment. The sweetness returns and goes down with some warmth, leaving a spiky little tingle on the tongue.  There is a meaty body to it, but the high ABV kinda lightens it up a bit...the alcohol is very evident, it's hard to hide at 21% by volume.  Easy to sip and that's what you best do with this one...the ultra sweetness helps make it a sipper. Big @$$ gnarly ale here...go easy on it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

10099,9086,mcallister,3.78,"Main reasoning for the 4.5 over a four is the lovely creamy thick head that possesses great retention. Considering this beers ABV this is a feat in itself. Cascading lace down the glass also has substance and great retention. Nearly opaque copper with an amber reddish hint too it.  Nose is nice and very piney. Alcohol is there but not as big as anticipation led me too believe. Very green and earthy aromas. A nice bit of malt to balance out the aroma and not make you overwhelmed by the hops. An odd metalic aroma is noticed on the very end of the nose.  Alcohol is hidden terrificly considering the ABV. Piney, piney, piney. RS is high in this beer but it fits well. Thick with a candied malt that fills the mid palate out nicely. Finish is moderate and sweet. Overall a great beer that hides the alcohol nicely. Not sure how drinkable this is however.

Today, I judge it from the experience of the 60,90 minute. Awesome, this beer should be brewed year round, just an awesome experience, it is like putting dynamite in your mouth with flavor. You have to drink it in sips, to truly enjoy it. Thanks to VwCraig for the trade, I absolutely have to get more of this ale. The smell of absolute pure hops. It sort of stings your nose. For the alcohol in this beer, you sure can't tell. It is sweet with a sting.  My last review was simply not on the mark, I called it horseradish.

10099,9086,biegaman,4.72,"2007 batch, 12 oz bottle. Enjoyed in my favourite mug. An expensive but exciting treat from Milton, Delaware. Continuous 120 minute boil followed by one straight month of dry hopping!  Pours a beautiful colour, a toasty brown with orange hues. A fine level of off white head that leaves thorough rims of lacing. An absolutely explosive bouquet!!! Not quite like any other hop filled aroma - so potent, so fresh, so whole. Small hints of booze peak through but not initially, what strikes first is this tremendous smell of hops, filled with pineapple, tangerine, grapefruit. A great deal of malt too. An exotic taste profile - notes of citrus, and more hops! The hop resin has imparted so many different flavours, it's incredibly complex. The alcohol doesn't even show on every sip, and even when it does it stays surprisingly balanced within the flavours.  I'm not even sure what to say, or how to describe, the beer has overwhelmed me. Dangerously quaffable. Everything is so balanced, it's incredible! I couldn't of imagined this being so balanced AND so tasty! Even at 20% or so percent this still drinks like a beer. Far and away my favourite of the series...",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Mebuzzard,3.56,"Found a little guy (12oz) single at Liquor Mart in Denver. Pours a glossy rust color, orange and copper hints. Big, big foam of off-white thick head. Chunked a bit. Nice lacing Spice and citrus dominate the aroma, with alcohol and the pine hops coming in and out. Taste is intense. Spice, citrus, alcohol, hops, pine, oak, some sweet malt. The syrup feel clings a bit and reminds me of PineSol. The abv is huge, and this bottle was all I can gulp. A good try, but I'll stick with the 60/90 ipa",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,grub,4.5,"big thanks to crwills for hooking me up with this one. anyone who goes shopping with a copy of your 'wants' list is great. thanks craig!  12oz bottle dated 12/18/06.  pours deep amber, almost red, with a half inch of dense tan head. the head drops fairly quick but leaves lots of sticky lace behind.  aroma is great. the glass is sitting on the table about 3 feet away and i can smell grapefruit and alcohol. up close the alcohol is fairly intense. tons of grapefruit and a bit of pine. burnt toffee and sweet caramel.  wow. taste is intense. blast of alchol, then sharp piney bitterness. the bitterness level actually doesn't seem too high, but that could be the high alcohol numbing my tongue and taste buds. orange and tangerine, with a nice sweetness that isn't the least bit syrupy. the alcohol is pure and clean too - no nasty fusels. sherry and port-like notes. there's some bready malt buried in there too.  mouthfeel is great. i didn't expect much carbonation from a brew this big, but it's got a nice moderate carbonation level. great body.  drinkability is suprisingly good. it's definitely more of a sipper at this strength, but damn is it good. sort of balanced. i could actually see a few more IBUs in here. good sweetness and lots of alcohol.  obviously this beer is over the top, but i'm pleasantly suprised at how good it is. the bottle says it ages well, so i'd be curious to try one that has some age on it. damn good even fresh.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,hoppymeal,4.55,"Pours gold to coppery orange with a medium cream head that fades fairly quickly and leaves a small amount of lacing. Aroma is big on sugary sweetness, very sweet malty aroma. There is also some citrusy hops in the aroma with lemon being the strongest note. Just a hint of alcohol is evident in the aroma but it becomes more pronounced with some agitation/swirling. Taste is malty and sweet. Like a lemon candy or citrus candy. Sweetness is along the level of an eisbock and then some. Citrusy hops may be huge but don't come thru that way, perhaps because of the large malt bill. The hoppiness is nice though, a clean citrus hoppiness. Like a eisbock and ipa mixture overall. There is some boozy warmth along with a hot alcohol bite in the finish. Alcohol seems nowhere near the 18-20 range. I love this beer. Perhaps not one you can drink much of, but a nice big sweet treat cut with some nice citrus hoppiness. Call it a barleywine or dipa, this one was meant for cellaring and I plan on loading up as the wallet will allow.

THe taste is heavy on the hops at first, but that quickly fades to a touch of malt and finally alcohol burn. the hops reappear on the finish with a wierd sweet alcohol taste.

10099,9086,Jacobier10,3.52,"I have sampled this several times at various beer festivals, but this is my first showdown with a full 12 oz. bottle. Let's take a closer look...  A barely legible inscription on the neck of the bottle says it was bottled on 09/07/06. Date of consumption: 03/01/07, so it has spent 6 months in the bottle, about 4 of those in my fridge. Sometimes I am amazed by my own patience.  Poured into an oversized wine glass with thin walls, the beer has a bright orange color with a small white head full of larger than normal bubbles. Holding the glass up to my nose, the beer reeks of hops with a sweet malt backbone. Very pleasing and unique. The first sip packs a punch. The hops are still present, but they have been dominated by an overwhelming sweetness. The alcohol is noticeable, but for a 21% beer, it does not make it too hot too drink. Personally, the sweetness is just too much for me and it takes away from the beer. Instead of being a smooth sipper, this beer is just tough to handle. The aftertaste is not pleasant and after a few sips I am ready for something else.  For me, the 120 Minute just gets worse as you drink it. I think it would best be served in 4 oz. servings. Possibly in a small snifter as an after dinner drink. A truly overwhelming brew, but one that I believe would be better off if it was toned down a bit. But I guess that is what the 90 Min IPA is for...",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Taste - Deep sip? I don't think so. This bad boy lasted all evening for me. This will kick your arse if you try to down this 40 proof brew. This is so very exceedingly smooth it was unreal. I purchased two and one will be aged for a good long time as a comparison.  Mouthfeel - Not a whole lot of carbonation presence which was suprising. I drank this one cool/cold and I personally think this added to the experience. This is a premier IPA.  Drinkability - Consumption, yes. Store, heck yes!

Thick lace with lots of swirls rounding about in the top, looks alive. Very nice hue and presentation.  Smell will knock you on you ass1 Deep pine resin, nothing I have ever smelled before, and lots of alchol. It actually started to burn my noce it was so strong. As it warms, citrus starts to flow, grapefruit, pineapple, but the pine nugget explosion is definatly intense,  The flavor is rediculous. It tore up my mouth, almost undrinkably bitter, but that just spurred me on. A whole new level of hops, and of beer for that matter. Warming is not the word, this keep my whole house warm last night.As it warmed alot of complex and sweet flavors came to the front, but the most again was a sort of pine sap flavor. The finish was a huge deep dry finish. This is an amazing beer, just huge hops, alcohol is obviously a factor, but if you limit yourself to one, I don't see it affecting the drinkability.

10099,9086,MSchae1017,4.28,"The Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA. The ""Holy Grail"" for hopheads. This 20% ""imperial"" IPA certainly pushes even the most avid beer lover's perception of beer. It falls right in line with the rest of the Dogfish Head beers adorned with the CAUTION Dogfish Head exclamation point, daring the drinker to crack it open. On this occasion, I have had the privilege to open my 2006 vintage alongside my friend's 2003. It pours into my Dogfish Head Raison D'etre oversized wine goblet with pale golden amber body. At 20% ABV, one would expect no head at all but the head surprisingly erupts from the 2006 version whereas the 2003's head barley creates a film. The head of the 2006 leaves a nice film over the beer the whole way down leaving lace down the side of the glass. The aroma is almost nothing but malty sweetness, however this is also surrounded by notes of alcohol and citrusy hops. The taste is up front with the sweetness, followed by the alcohol, and finished with the bitterness and flavor from the hops, but the sweetness dominates over all. The 2003 is certainly sweeter. The beer exhibits more than a full body with an extreme amount of dryness on the finish and surprising lively amount of carbonation. In the end, the Dogfish Head 120 minute IPA is a very interesting beer. The warming sensations it brings can make it one of the most enjoyable beers on a cold winters night. However, its not an every night or even every week beer for that matter. If you are looking for that truly extreme beer though, this is the one you are looking for.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

No one really needs this much hop. I do love the 60' and 90' ales. But this is a beer to age and see what happens. Hazy amber. Very Tacky palate. takes quite a while to adjust. I'd like to meet the guy who could drink a 6 pack of these. It's a sipper, I could only do one a night probably.

Taste: Thick and saturated with sweetness, grassy, brown sugar and some molasses, but it's balanced out with continuous alcohol in the nose, hops are hidden, present and spicy, but subtle. The end result is a warming swallow of sweetness, almost brandy like.  Drinkability: A very complex brew in my opinion. Huge alcohol is pleasant, but does mask the rest of the beer.

Taste: Very balanced hop and malt flavor in the initial taste with a bitting hop and alcohol finish  Mouthfeel: Very oily hop feel and a rich malt character.

Visible carbonation keeping the head alive and some lacing remains.  Wow, that's a unique aroma. A lemon-banana floral scent and sweet malt and the presence of alcohol.  Another set of ""Wow's"". This beverage has a lot of character. The immediate sensation is smooth and creamy with a whispered fizz. It has an interesting fruity malt flavor... and then a modest burn in the chest on the way down. The alcohol characteristic, while oh so real, is not overbearing.

A small head quickly reduced to a thin cap. Definitely some particles floating about. Sparce lacing. Smell is an ether hop blast that lingers. Initial taste is hops and quickly is over powered by alcohol. There are sweet citrus tones as well, but almost everything gets over powered by the booze, which isn't even a bad thing with this beer. I tasted this beer with any surface it met in my mouth. Which left a very nice 'full' mouthfeel. It quickly dries and lingers on the cheeks and throat.

This one is a clear example in my mind. I get the marketing angle 60 -&gt; 90 -&gt; 120 min IPA. Build off the amazing success of the 60 and 90 series brews.  Doesn't do this beer justice.  A - hazy golden color, wispy white head that actually increased as the beer warmed up from cellar temp to room temp. 1/8th inch head lasted the full glass. S - Never smelled anything quite like it. Go to your local homebrew shop, buy a half pound bag of hops. Rub vigorously in your hands till you have a good coating of resin. Cup your nose and inhale. Yeah, something like that. Huge piney hop with citric undertones. A nice underlying malt body. Viscous aroma. Feels like I'm taking a taste as I breathe it in.  T - Less hoppy than the aroma suggests. Strong pine hops balanced out amazingly well by a golden buttery caramel sweet malt. Somehow the balance between hops, malts and alcohol tease the taste buds and swirl with an amazingly intoxicating flavor (pun intended).  M - definitely a full bodied beer. Mellow and clean finishing.  D - At 21%, thankfully it's only 12oz. One finished my night quite comfortably. Pour into a tulip or other glass to enhance the aromas, clear the schedule and sit back for a sipping indulgance.

10099,9086,Jmamay22,4.02,"2006 Vintage from a 12 oz. bottle poured into a snifter.  Appearance - Hefty pour creates a inch of head that thins some, but has some staying power. Under the off white head is a lovely burnt orange brew.  Smell - Intoxicating smell. Definetly smells of syrup and balanced with piney hops.  Taste - First thoughts - oh wow! I was unsure of what to make of the first sip. Very complex and well balanced taste. Fruity, flowery, syrupy taste give way to hints of hops and finishes dry with a taste of alcohol. After warming the sweetness becomes tough to handle and is really overbearing.  Mouthfeel - Syrupy at first then turning towards an oily moutfeel. Very little carbonation and the alcohol is smooth and not overbearing. It really sticks to your pallate.  Drinkability - Definetly a sipper, but what delightful sips they are. Might be best to split this with a friend, even if it is only 12oz.  Notes - Great for a special occasion, with its high alcohol content and price.

Honestly, I'm not sure I have a need for this beer once I tried it a couple times. Certainly worth a try, but it is more of a liability to have around, as I need to make sure I have a couple friends to share it with to guard against sudden inebriation.

In the glass, it resembles Amontillado sherry with carbonation that rises fast and violently. The deep amber color and a thick sticky head is an immediate turn on. The aroma is reminiscent of warm buttersctotch and honey, followed by a thick honeyed accent. On the palate, there is the immediate presence of honey, candied fruit, and malt. It finishes with a slight hop flavor of garden flowers.  This is one of the most full-bodied beers I have ever tasted. It is not ready to drink at this point, but will benefit from age.

Like mixing centennial and cascade hold them up to your nose and breathing deep.  Tastes good. Very good. The hops are more aromatic than anything, and the smell serves to blot out much of the amazingly sweet maple syrup malt that takes over most of the start and lasts throughout the middle. Ends on some pine and floral hops and a long, lingering bread yeast. Very well balanced, but the syrupiness is a bit too intense for me.  A sipping beer, for sure.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,maundythirsty,4.62,"Pretty pink-tinged peach-colored beer. Poured easily off of the thin yeast cake at the bottom of the bottle, but there is a little bit of particulate roaming around with steadily streaming bubbles. A quarter-inch head thinned to a loose mat of foam.  Candy sweet smell and taste. Matching tropical fruit aromas and flavors that mean business. Smells of grapefruit hops. Spreads out in the mouth with some powerful malt that goes to fruity flavors like citrus, peach, pineapple and mango before hanging a sharp turn into clearly heavy -- but mellow -- booze.  Nearly syrupy mouthfeel, and I wouldn't want it any other way. Very little carbonation breaking it up, and the alcohol is soooo smooth. A velvet hammer.  I'm sold. This is not a six-pack session beer, understandably -- six of these will buy you more than a case of most craft beers, and put a few martinis' worth of alcohol in your gut.

10099,9086,wcudwight,3.87,"Vintage 2004 Pours a cloudy peach/umber color. No head(none expected), and patchy lace. The aromas remind me a lot of Bigfoot Barleywine maybe a bit more intense. Smells of candied fruit. Banannas, pineapple, grapefruit dipped in caramel. Whoa!!! On first sip my sinuses are clear and my ears warmed. This made my freakin eyes water and it's 2+ yrs old. And I like it!! Not the intense hop flavors I was expecting. Taste more like a big heavy malty barleywine that is uber sweet. The alcohol is very noticable and is a complementary star player to the huge malt sweetness. The alcohol flavors add to the beer and not subtract from this. In fact I think this beer would be incomplete with out the potentacy of the alcohol. Mouthfeel is good. I'd call it refreshing. My head feels clearer anyway.

It pours a deep amber color with a slight haze (maybe because it was in the fridge for a while). There is really no head and the carbonation is so little that you have to wait for a bubble to rise every couple of seconds. The smell is rich with an appely-grapey tang to it. You can smell the sweetness synonymous with an American Double IPA and strangely, no alcohol smell is present. The taste is rich, woody, sweet, creamy, and bitter towards the end. It is very fruity and rich. The mouthfeel is thick, syrupy and a little buttery before the bitterness hits. I thought it was going to be hard to drink this one, but it is as smooth as silk.

S - Strong grapefruit, peaches, pears, almonds, caramel sweetness, plums, grapes, and a bunch of solvent-ish alcohol, dominate the nose. Really an over overwhelmingly aromatic aroma that puts a lot of DIPAS to shame.  T - The aromas transfer to the taste, but are melded into a cloyingly sweet taste, of thick, pungent fruitiness. All of it is good, but then it turns into an alcohol flavor bomb that lets you know that this is no beer to mess around with.  M Heavy, thick, and sweet to start then warms as the alcohol comes out, and lightens. Leaves a caramel-ish residue on the tongue.  D - Let this beast of a delight age.... for a while.

The taste is of thick, chewy hops - citrus and pine especially. Nice hop profile. Raw alcohol mixes in with hops, leaving some peppery heat in the mouth. Although not quite as much as a 21%er might. A bready malt background give it a thicker body and some balance.  The feel is thick and full-bodied. Syrupy with a rawness to it. A bit heavy on the tongue.  Well, this is well-hopped and alcoholic. It's nice, but alcohol does disturb drinkability, and even enjoyment to a degree because it kills quite a bit of the aftertaste. A nice DIPA, but I can't say I liked it more than the 90 minute.

Some lacing is left behind as it warms. Initial nose has grapefruit and pineapple juice smells. Some burning alcohol present if you inhale deep enough. Upfront taste is very sweet followed by an alcoholic burn. I imagine it's hard to hide 21% ABV. Looking for the bitterness here. Can pick up a piney hop taste if the swig in mouth is kind of for lack of a better word, ""chuffed"" around. If cellaring this mellows the hops, then I believe you want this as fresh as possible. Heavy mouthfeel and oily. Hardly any carbonation in mouthfeel. Overall drinkable if you can handle the sweetness.

After trying it I can say it's way overpriced based on taste, but it sounds like DFH employs a labor-intensive process to make it (the bottle says dry-hopped with daily additions for a month).  Beautiful hazy dark orange color with a foam that lasted forever despit the ABV (&gt;20%). The smell is barley wine and hops, you can tell this is a strong beer. The flavor is really sweet and hoppy with an alcohol burn, I would have liked it better with less sweetness. Actually I tasted a cough medicine note which I objected to also.

10099,9086,isaac,3.98,"12 oz. bottle to my new, st. bernardus chalice. what a way to break this glass in. music: billy bragg's ""there is power in a union""  A - Amazing, ruby red body that seems to glow. above sits a creamy, beige head, which sinks to spotty lacing and medium-sized bubbles.  S - Huge, flowery hops with shouts (as opposed to hints) of grapefruit, apricot, mint, and slight pine. Malts are candied and sweet smelling and there exists a slight burn in the nose from the booze. This smells like the best of IPAs.  T - Very juicy, very sweet, much of the hops bitterness is lost to this sweetness sadly, but only momentarily, as they come back in the finish. again, this tastes much like candy from the malts, perhaps even hints of strawberry jam and butter (mmm toast...). booze is also present in a vodka-like way. while i very much am enjoying this taste, it is far more reminicent of a barleywine than an IPA and it is for this reason that i question its catagorization. however, i review by beer, not by style, so... we're cool.  M - big, juicy feel with medium carbonation and a syrupy finish that really brings out all the flavours quite nicely.  D - at the halfway point of this beer, i would have said that the drinkability was quite high, but now, with one sip remaining, i don't know if i can muster it... it is just so sweet... at this point all the hops are gone and i feel like im drinking vodka and honey, whisked together, microwaved, frozen, and then melted to room temperature. gross. i could keep drinking this beer... if only it stayed cold, or at most around 45 degrees.  this does for DIPAs as world wide stout does for double stouts. a very inventive take on an already great style. though, to be fair, i don't think im ever going to go back to either. glad i tried them both, but, yeah, ill stick to more traditional beers.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,jcdiflorio,4.6,"First off even before the served info,extra thanks to Susdog for sending me this beer which I always wanted to try. OK, served into my favorite large tulip gold rimmed glass from a 12oz brown long neck bottle with a crimped on cap.  Mirky,glowing reddish/golden color,apricot nectar-like color. 1"" thick,creamy head with good retention,some tightly knitted strings of bubbles surging to the surface from the sides and center of the glass. Spotty lacing with some small curtians of lace clinging to the sides of the glass. Constant layer of foam with a never die attitude always on the top of the beer. Gotta love it!  Intense hop aromas, lots of pine and citrus,pineapple,sweet carmell maltyness,burnt syrupy aromas. A candy-like aroma,a slight boozy aroma,stings the nostrills a bit,you know the alcohol is in there. Still a very tempting aroma,not an aroma for the weak at heart.  Wow! Intense hop taste very piney/citrusy great pineapple taste,lots of sweet carmell tastes a great burnt taste to the carmell.Very sugary,reminds me a bit of cotton candy. Lots of candied flavors to the taste.Amazing balance to all the intense tastes,the balance is the key to this beer as far as i'm concerned.If the balance was a bit off this beer would really suffer in the taste department,no problem here.Lots of boozyness here as expected, don't have a problem with it and it is not offensive to me.Resiny and sugary in a good way, this beer just pushes the limit for me but just never exceeds it. A real palate buster,my tongue will never be the same again. Thanks,Ted  Thick,chewy,cloying,Whatta ya expect? A pleasure for the taste buds. This beer was better than I could have even imagined. A very balanced taste throughout. A nightcap beer, by no means a starter beer. The drinkability for this beer was astounding,would never think this beer would be as drinkable as it is.I wanted to savor it as much as I wanted to slam it. ABV 21.00% would never know it,was a bit fraid to give this one a try,now I'm glad I did. Thanks again,Ted Send me this beer anytime !!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,FenwaySquid,4.62,"Presentation: 12 oz brown bottle, bottling date of 12/18/06 laser printed on the bottleneck with the proclamation fo ""ages well"" on the label (I'll find that out in about 2-3 years, but that's a review for another day), poured into a Duvel tulip glass.  Appearance: Pours a deep reddish brown color, rather clear with just a few carbonation bubbles rising. the head formed about 2-3 fingers thick (tulip glass after all) and faded very slowly into a thin layer that retained.  Aroma: All hops, very strong but oh so inviting.  Taste: Same as the aroma, hoppy throughout. Slightly bitter at first but it kind of sweetens up in the middle. The finish goes bitter and hoppy, along with a peppery alcohol taste.  Mouthfeel: Very thick and syrupy. The carbonation was light but fit perfectly for how thick this beer is.  Overall: At 20-21% possibly the highest ABV of any beer I've ever had, and definitey the most bitter. Still, very drinkable, doesn't taste like it should be so high in alcohol. If you're not sure about how much hops you can handle, start with the 60-minute, then the 90-minute. If you enjoy both of those give this one a shot. Be advised, it's VERY hoppy and bitter.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,jordanmills,3.98,"Poured from a 12 ounce into a pint glass. Comes out a hazy copper with a rocky, tall head. Smells of lots of hops. Tastes - wow. Lots of hops, but sweet and complex. There's a flavor like molasses or something. I don't like hoppy beers, and this is great. Feels thick and smooth on the tongue, hops and sweet all the way down. It's a tad bitter and rich to drink all night, but I could have a Couple.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,kipling,3.45,"Served in a tulip glass from the bottle.  A: Gives the appearance of a slightly over-ripe peach; deep orange red through the thickest portion of the glass turning to a slightly golden orange nearest the surface of the glass. I was rewarded with a robust, off-white head two finger-thick. The carbonation, though present, doesn't keep the head alive and, sadly, it fades away within minutes, leaving me with a ring of bubbles around the edge of the glass and a thin film towards the center of the beer. Some lacing left on the glass as I imbibe the beer.  S: Zounds! Hops, hops and more fresh hops. There's something else there mingling with the hops...honey, nectar, molasses, I'm not sure, but it's definitely something sticky sweet . The smell is heavenly.  T: The hops are there from lips to gut in all their resiny, piney goodness, but so is the sweetness that I picked up through the nose and it doesn't go away. It almost tastes like that over-ripe peach that I mentioned earlier. It doesn't really detract from the taste, but I don't feel that it adds to it either. It's just somewhat distracting.  M: Somewhat oily up front, but finishes remarkably clean (although that damn sweetness won't subside). In a beer of this potency I am utterly astounded that the alcohol profile isn't running roughshod through and over the flavor, but it's not.  Overall I am glad for having tried this beer. Hell, it inspired me enough to finally sit down and write my first beer review after years of lurking on BA. If it happened to find its way back to Peoria I would probably do what I could to get another bottle, but realistically it's not something that could be considered a staple of any one's ""beer diet"", readily available or not. I must give a shout-out to BA MWalters for the heads-up on this one. Thanks-a-million!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,BeerCheese,2.97,"Took this one out of the fridge about 2 hours ago to let it warm up a little. Poured into my favorite glass. Big white head on this cloudy amber/gold beer. Very sweet malty flavor. Much more than I expected, and the first drink went down like a shot with the high ABV%. The hops came through mostly in the aftertaste. Smells a little malty, but I could smell more hops than I could taste. Nice mouthfeel. Light/medium carbonation, medium full body. For me, this is not very drinkable because I could only drink it in limited quantities. It's also too sweet for my taste. Perhaps I could acquire a taste for this one over time, but at $8/bottle that probably won't happen anytime soon because there are so many more beers I still need to taste.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,atsprings,3.53,"Poured into a standard pint glass. At 23% this is by far the strongest beer I've ever tried. As a hophead, I'd been wanting to try this for a while. Took a whiff of the aroma and WHOA! Hops galore. As expected, the hops come in strong in the taste, but they cannot overcome the medicine syrup qualities that all that alcohol creates. I'm glad I tried it, but it really wasn't for me.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,TheSarge,4.2,"Single 12oz bottle that I paid $9 for.  120 IPA is very floral from the hops overload, as well as a bit of grapefruit rind. I also detect notes of fresh cut grass, and pine as well.  This brew is dark golden amber in color, and was very clear at first, but after I poured the rest of the brew out into my glass, the brew clouded over like a hurricane. Produces a very light tan head, sticks around for a while, and leaves lacing the whole duration of the sample. This must be a fresher batch than the last reviewer's. There is a lot of CO2 action going on here, and this Imperial IPA is easily agitated.  This is surprisingly very sweet and not over dominated by the load of hops. I can't believe this is a 21% ABV. Not dominated by the alcohol, and the head retains very well for such a high ABV.  This brew bites a little bit, and is not watery by any means. This is slightly warm to the palate and back of my throat.  120 is great overall but a bit pricy for the 12oz sample I got. I suppose this is understandable due to the limited number of batches per year.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,cbn,4.07,"single brown bottle of the 12oz. type poured into a tulip. interesting, slightly hazy deep orange-gold with a creamy golden head quickly dissapting, lively carbonation forms islands of lace.  tropical fruits,black peppper and a complex acid aroma reveal a sweetness as of cherry tomatoes, queer yet intriguing.  sweetness from an impeccable malt is assaulted from every corner by a champion hop.  fairly thin and oily, yet clean, lightly astringent.  beware this is a bad boy, sit back at home relax and write a review.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Patrick999,4.15,"I wasn't sure I was ready to drink this beer, much less review it. Prior to this experience (and it was an experience), I'd not had a beer above 9% ABV. I had no idea what to expect here, as this was definitely uncharted territory.  A - Upon pouring, this had an odd, highly intriguing appearance. A cloudy, honey-golden, viscous pour revealed many bubbles, but they were moving around in a way I'd never seen before. The carbonation didn't just bubble up to the surface. It was...frenetic, moving in all different directions with no apparent rhyme or reason, though perhaps this should be expected with such a high volume of alcohol. The head was better than I expected, and it left very fine clingy filaments of lacing. This beer looked incredible in the glass.  S - Wow. Forget drinking this beer, the smell is intoxicating enough. I smell hops, glorious sticky resinous hops. Quite honestly, it smells as if a metric ton of hops were compacted and concentrated into the singularity of this one bottle. A veritable black hole of hops, if you will. Smelling salts? Who needs smelling salts when you have 120 Minute IPA? Good god, this might wake the dead. What else do I smell? Alcohol, definitely a boozy fusel kick, especially as the beer warmed a bit.  T - This beer is too sugary. There, I said it. The excellent hops bitterness eventually cuts its way through the sugar, but it has to work way too hard, especially with such a blatantly hopped beer. Make no mistake, there's still a blissful cacophony of tastes here, which is why I give it a 4. Candy, grassy, piney, woody, oily, boozy, back to candy.  M - Oily, buttery, and surprisingly not harsh at all.  D - This is not very drinkable in large doses, even adjusting for the fact that this is 21% beer. It isn't the alcohol that is making this difficult to drink, it's the sweetness. I'm typically a pretty fast drinker, and this took me nearly one hour to finish. For all practical purposes, it's too much for one person....it would be better to share it. I have another bottle, and that is what I will do with it, after I age it a bit.  In summary, this is simply one beast of a beer. It could be an exceptional, legendary beer if the sugar was toned down somewhat. It might already be legendary.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,stevecee2003,4.17,"Appearance - A cloudy amber, with deep reds hidden inside. Lots of bubbles, settling into a one inch head. Sticks to the side of the glass. A good sign.  Smell - Wow! Never smelled these smells before! A heavy dose of flowers, with shavings of orange peel thrown in. There is a strong hops smell, probably waiting in the taste, is everpresent in the background.  Taste - A rush of flavors. It's surprising how much flavor can be pushed into one bottle. But then I remember I did pay about $8.50 for this one bottle, retail. The high alcohol quotient is not present in the taste, but you know it's there.  Drinkability - This is so rich, so flavor-filled I don't think I can drink more than one. But perhaps thats the point. One is all it takes!  Notes: In my IPA circles this beer is legendary. The 90-minute style has its points. But Wow this 120-minute version will knock your socks off! But only just one!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,SkinnyElvis,3.2,Fresh bottle bought a month ago so the beer is a bit hot. Lighter in color than a usual DIPA but DFH is never usual. A bit of hops and fruit in smell. It tastes fairly hoppy but the alcohol taste is a little strong which affects the drinkability (besides the massive ABV). This is a sipper for sure. I won't drink another one this fresh and see how aging affects this beer.  Cheers.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Washburne,4.64,"Found a bottle of this at Trinity Hall Irish Pub in Dallas. The server said they only had a few left so I had to take the opportunity even at $16 for the bottle, especially seeing as it's not even legal to sell here in Collin County.  A - Lovely, deep golden brown colour with a creamy head which, unfortunately, didn't last too long.  S - I've recently been getting into dessert wines, so I could pick out notes I recognised from those on this beer. Definite honeysuckle notes, and I'm thinking tangerine, or at least something similar, along with some smooth caramel.  T - I never really imagined the possibility of a dessert beer, but this definitely qualifies. Again those sweet honeysuckle and caramel notes, with enough bittering hops to remind you that, yes, this is a beer. Surprisingly little alcohol flavour for a beer that weighs in at 20%.  M - Smooth, creamy and thick but without ever being cloying. Also, once it goes down it doesn't leave the somewhat sour aftertaste I've found a lot of the higher percentage beers have. I could feel this slide down my gullet as I swallowed and it definitely added a little warmth on this below-freezing night.  D - You know what? Were it not for the price tag and the fact that the pub quiz was over, I could have ordered another. While it's a definite sipper, the high alcohol content really doesn't make this as stand-alone as you'd expect it to. I enjoyed and could quite happile enjoy another!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,oelergud,4.32,"Translucent brown orange body, good carbonation. Light tan head with a white swirl, tiny to medium bubbles. Head collapses to a thin float leaving little lace. Nose of spice, grapes and raisens, muskat, molasses, wet musty hayloft and a sour note. Very complex. Sweet raisens and spice up front. Very strong molasses and toffee also with some fruit to it. The high alcohol content is nowhere to be found save for the fuzzy warm feeling it imparts. Although the malts certainly dominate the taste, there is a constant undertone of slightly spiked hops which are allowed more room in the long aftertaste. Full heavy body with some coating and a slick sensation. So drinkable and delicious, if the abv wasn't so high I'd indulge in this brew more often.  -Oelergud",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,DogFood11,3.52,12oz bottle poured into a chalice it forms a solid eggshell white head that has decent staying power. Body is a dull copper shade with little visible carbonation.  A large amount of dark fruits and caramel come forward at the get go in the aroma. The body of this beer is much thicker than it looks in the appearance. Stick to you ribs type of beer. It doesn't surprise me that the alcohol makes up the majority of the balancer. At 21% its a big player although it doesn't completely dominate this offering but is a big complimentary addition. Slightly medicinal is a bit of a turn off. Hops come through in the bitter portion but don't have any taste value.  Notes: Interesting. On one hand I liked the over the top expirimental approach but on the other more sane hand I found it to be nothing I would purchase again under normal circumstances.

Gorgeous looking beer. Not too many different smells from this one, not surprisingly a huge hop scent, not a whole lot of malty smells and just a bit of grapefruit coming through. The taste is the definition of hops wow, I thought ruination was a bitter beer, this takes the cake so far. Its also got tastes of sweetness and a very small hint of citrus. It definitely hides the 21% ABV very well. I should clarify that last sentence, the alcohol is definitely present and detectable however for 21% it's not that bad.

10099,9086,jamie2dope,3.6,"I was debating what to get at the liquor store last night, and decided a 12 ounce bottle of this would make things a little bit easier. It poured a bright orange color with no real head. Smell was of juicy hops, and also a certain herb presence. If you've had Stone's 10th Anniversary Ale, there is a certain onion/garlic presence, which was also present in this beer. Taste was really sweet and juicy, almost too sweet. Mouthfeel was medium bodied, with the alcohol really making itself known. One is more then enough for me. DFH prides themselves on making high gravity beers that don't taste like hard liquor, but in this case, you really can taste the alcohol. Not a bad beer at all, but it will probably be a little while before I decide to pick it up again. Cheers.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Very light in the mouth (lighter than you'd think). Very sweet taste, much like the aroma. Finishes smooth with relatively no hops in comparison to what I expected, or to what i feel the beer needs for balance.  Too sweet, but the alcohol is amazingly well masked.

10099,9086,MaltyGoodness,4.02,"12oz. bottle - Xmas present from Josh  Pours a hazed orange-amber with a creamy eggshell head that thins.Thick lacing on the glass.  This beer has a boisterous aroma. Sweet caramel malt companied with layers upon layers of hops. Citrus, herbal, piney, just waves of all the usual suspects. There is also a slight booziness present, but not as much as expected for the huge ABV.  I know that this beer is both labeled as a DIPA and is placed in the DIPA style, but everything about how this beer tastes says barleywine. Sweet caramel maltiness upfront leading into waves of layered hop flavors.There is some bitterness, but not enough to offset the sweetness. Finishes sweet and malty as it started, with some lingering hop flavors. Sweetness is a touch cloying.  As big of a body as you'll find, slightly syrupy. Nicely carbonated.  Huge beer, still retains decent drinkability. Overall, a very complex beer and a nice experience. Definitely limited to a single bottle because of the ABV and the sweetness. Again, I really don't see how this is a DIPA. It more closely fits the characteristics of a barleywine, or maybe even a double barleywine considering the extreme nature of this beast.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

10099,9086,Risser09,4.63,"2006 Vintage - Poured into a big snifter I bought a case of this stuff in October of this year so I figured I would make a routine of having one every New Year's Eve. Thankfully, at 21% this beer would last longer than I will.  Appearance: Glowing reddish orange color. Small half inch head gives way to moderate lacing. Moderate effevescence-this beer is still young and lively looking.  Smell: Earthy hop smell. Faint sugar and alcohol aromas. Tangerine and other citrus aromas.  Taste: Sugary and dense, not beaming with flavor as I thought it would. This beer tastes woody and possibly as though it has spent some time in an oak barrel, although the carbonation would not indicate this. Alcohol burn is there, and is quite warming. Very satisfying finish. Like a nice single malt. As I drink on I realize that the finish of this beer is exceptional. Not overly hoppy or explosive, but warm and juicy. Take some time to appreciate this beer.  Mouthfeel: Syrupy, but not as sweet as other people have indicated. Hops are present but not cloying. I am very fond of the alcohol warmth. I've never had such a tremendous warmth from a beer. I'm surprised it came from an ""Imperial"" IPA.  Drinkability: I love it. I could have more than one of these in a sitting if I could afford to. Not a session beer but certainly worth trying. It would also be nice to have a few of these around if the mood strikes you to have the experience. Perhaps beer like this could find its way onto Scotch & Brandy lists in finer restaurants.

10099,9086,foureyedgeek,4.35,"My first 120 Minute IPA, as it says on the bottle a 'Holy Grail for Hopheads'. So, I am a little excited. This would be the most recent bottling, which would be... late summer 2006?  Poured into an oversized wine glass, poured with an absolutely huge fluffy off-white head. Body is a lovely dark amber. Nice sticky lacing, more developing at every sip as the beer falls back to level.  Smell is a hop explosion of pine, of citrus, of HOPS, accompanied by a touch of sweetness.  Taste is amazing, the mouth is full of hops, each sip brings the flavor out more as it warms from cellar temperature. The alcohol is barely even noticeable, an amazing feat for a beer that clocks in at 21%. There's even a decent malty sweetness that helps carry the hop flavors through, fruity even, flavors of peach or apricot, a little caramel. This is a very well balanced DIPA, quite a feat of brewing.  Mouthfeel is nicely bodied, a tad oily and oh so warming, both to the mouth and body.  This beer is incredibly drinkable. Being a standout, incredibly ramped up DIPA this is no session beer but definitely something I could sip all evening long. Now if only we could do something about that $10 price tag.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,kernalklink,4,"Wow- mindblowing D-IPA. Poured a cloudy gold as a good IPA should, with little head and lacing effect. Slick piney hop aromatics controlled the nose- the sharp burning on the first sip was masked only by the fruity apricot- peachiness of the crazy malt profile. An uppercut of hops on the finish- smooth and biting at the same time- great brew but keep it to 1 or 2 bottles or you may not wake up.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,trevorwideman,3.33,"12oz bottle poured into a tulip glass, thanks to demcorhip for this one, I've been wanting to try it for a long time. Bottled 03/29/06.  Pours a hazey orange colour, very murky with lots of sediment. Medium carbonation from what I can tell. 1/4 inch head subsides to a lace that thinly coats the top and the glass. Nose is lovely and hoppy, citric and floral, and a funkiness I can't quite put my finger on. There's definitely a sweet toasted caramel backbone, and the Alcohol makes itself evident, but I guess it would be hard for it not to. The nose is great, but much more subtle and muted than I thought it would be.  Taste is whooo, really sweet. Wow. I was not expecting the huge sweet malt presence here, but that's what it's all about. Caramel, plum, honey, dark fruitiness, and yes, that monstrous warming alcohol all appear in great quantities. I really feel like the hops are so well balanced as to not be as detectable as in some hop monsters. Yes, there's a bitterness in the finish, and if you search really hard though all the sugariness, there's some mellow orange peel bitterness and a lovely floral character, but not nearly the bitterness I was hoping for. Mouthfeel is thick, creamy and a little syrupy, then the palate dries in the finish. Carbonation is a bit more than I'd like, but maybe it's not the carbon that's making my palate numb. Lord knows that I would not want more than one of these, and it's an all-night sipper to be sure.  Final verdict: This is an extreme beer, and as such, I can respect it for what it is. It's way to sweet for my palate, and even though I don't find the sweetness awkward or cloying, it's just too much sugar. Also, I wanted a much more brazen, out of control hop bomb, and this to me is more like a barleywine. All that said, wow, I'm buzzed, and I still have half a glass to go.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,BeerMang,4.92,Apperance is a hazy orange with a medium head that dissapates into a ring around the glass when drinking. A good amount of lace is present when drinking.  Smell is of hops with citric and pine also present. The alcohol is not as powerfull as I would have thought.  Taste is unbelievable hops all around your mouth. A citric and pine taste is very present too. Everything is so well balenced....awesome for such an extreme beer to be so well balenced.  Mouthfeel is oily and for a 21 Abv it is not overpowering with alcohol.  Drinkability is exceptional and if it wasnt for the 21Abv I could drink this beer all night.

10099,9086,Andbrew,3.03,"Straight out of the bottle I thought I was in a flowering humulus field. Talk about hop city. It even says right on the label and of course the namesake is dedicated to its hopping. This beer was exceptionally hard to get as my distributor told me that they were only delivering this one case at a time to CO.  Poured into a wine glass a rich golden color with light cloudiness and tints of green and yellow towards the bottom of the glass. Very light head retention with only a film of head left after a few minutes; no lacing. Taste is bitter beyond most, yet retains a delicate flavor of malt and hop. I was expecting a pickled mouth from the 21%, however I hardly noticed the strength due mostly in part to the overwhelming bitter and scotch taste. I was able to finish the bottle with little trouble and found a comforting buzz in a small bottle with a ton of taste.  I am not personally a huge hophead and this beer proves it. If you are however, I would say dive in. I wouldn't drink this with a meal as the meal would be completely overshadowed by it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,kimcgolf,4.05,"This is the first time Ive ever had citrus flavored moonshine. Immediately upon opening the bottle, I caught the overwhelming scent of alcohol. While pouring, citrus hops were present, but still muted by the alcohol. The flavor was a good mix of bitter citrus hops and malty sweetness, again, surrounded by alcohol. As I was drinkling this, my eyes actually started to water from the intnese wafting of the grain alcohol. Finish was good, but again moved to the back seat by, you guessed it..the alcohol.  This actually was not bad, especially considering it is 21% abv, but just much stronger than I normally care for in a beer. The next time I think about having a DFH 120, Ill just move right to the Everclear instead.  Note: Tried this on tap several years later at The Pint in Vegas. Much smoother and enjoyable than the bottle. In fact, friends who also had were stunned at the HIGH ABV given the smoothness. Much better the second time around",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,biking4beer,3.35,"12 oz bottle split with a friend.  Pours a frothy half finger head that diminishes, but sticks around. Beer is a hazy, deep amber color that shifts to a light brown in the heart of the glass.  You can smell this one a mile away. Strong sweet, caramel aroma. Orange, floral/flower. almost sugary sweet smell. Sturdy alcohol is in the mix.  Very sweet malt taste is the first thing noticed. Caramel again. Slight sourness and alcohol break up the sweetness somewhat, but not enough. Grapefruit hoppiness is prevalent in the aftertaste. I'm tempted to give this a 3.0 on taste, but it's definitely not average.  I like the oily, thick texture of this beer. The carbonation breaks it up well, and I was genuinely surprised by the level of carbonation. With the ABV up around 20%, I was thinking carbonation would be more like a barleywine. My 6 oz was really hard to get down as it warmed. The alcohol and sweetness is a bit too much (and I like scotch clean). Maybe I should consider style with my drinkability rating, but it truly was hard to finish off. A super slow sipper. I couldn't imagine trying to drink 12 oz of this. Definitely worth a try if you spot it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,BeerSox,3.72,"12oz bottle into wine glass.  Very cloudy amber hue with an off-white thin head that doesn't last long. Stringy lacing.  Extremely strong hops, resonating grapefruit with piney citrus scents. The hops mixed with the amount of alcohol almost burns your nostrils.  Thick and syrupy sweet malts balanced by the devastating hops. The flavor is almost like melon, but very bitter and acidic. The hops make your mouth almost pucker, and the alcohol brings an extremely dry finish. There is very little carbonation, so the feel is slick and oily.  Probably one of the most extreme beers you will find. Sip this one slowly and perhaps share the 12oz bottle with a friend. A 60 or 90 Minute IPA from Dogfish Head will probably be more enjoyable, but you need to try this one just to say you did it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,kpantz,3.4,"Executive Review:  Note: 2004 Vintage  Appearance: Very hazy amber pour into a chalice; I can barely see my finger on the other side. Thin head that reduces to a film. Lacing is actually not as persistent as I had anticipated.  Smell: Wow - this smells somewhat like one of those J.W. Lees numbers. Very malty, almost musty aroma. Caramel/butterscotch notes in there as well.  Taste: You know, it almost tastes like one of those Harvest Ales. This is nothing like the green, fresh 120 Minute IPA to which I'm accustomed. This is like an aged barleywine or strong ale. Quite malty - butterscotch again - with very little noticeable hop character but in the final second where the bitterness surfaces.  Mouthfeel: Sticky, sticky, sticky. I need to brush my teeth.  Drinkability: Riiight. One and done. GREAT evening sipper, however.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,goochpunch,3.48,"Bottled on 09/07/06.  Pours out a peach and orange hued honey color with a small head that settles to a thin layer of bubbles. A small, slow, single stream of bubbles comes from the center of the glass. When swirled, it leaves scattered spots of ""lace."" Smells of very strong and sharp hops; with aromas of pine piercing the most, as well as some citrus. Very grassy. Lots of alcohol is picked up, as well, and a general sweetness from the malt. First off in the taste is the hops: mostly citrus as opposed to all the grass and pine I got in the nose. The ""greener"" hop flavors come out as well, but the citrus is more pronounced. Not much bitterness at all, as this is ridiculously sweet. I get a little toastedness from the malts, but it's more just blaring sweetness. Alcohol comes through as well, but much less than I suspected. I get a slight twang in the finish, which I'm not sure about. There's a lingering vapor like presence of fruit loop-like hops in my mouth post-sip, which I like a lot. Mouthfeel is thick and viscous, but, considering that, I am very surprised that the carbonation manages to slightly prick: stopping this from being a mess in the mouth. Drinkability isn't so hot, at first, but once I become more tipsy, it goes down a bit quicker.  Not a great DIPA, but this is really in a different category entirely. And for what it is, it's good, but not stellar.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,aljordan,3.7,"Smells like an orange and a pine tree. Some faint orange colored lacing that chases the beer deeper into the glass. Feels somewhat heavy in the mouth to me. Oily as well. Lots of yeast left in the bottle, as well in the bottom of the glass. Some critus tastes along with pine needles in addition to others that I can't describe. Each drink feels like I've just taken a sip of schnapps. This is a 21-22% ABV beer so that makes sense. Similar to drinking wine.  Honestly, I'd rather have a DFH 90 minute that isn't as high on the ABV.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,jnelson54,3.85,This beer is not as good as the 90 minute version. Dont get me wrong it is a nice beer but they went a little over the top even for a hop head like me. The aroma is wonderful flowers and pine very nice. The taste unfortunatly leave the nice bitter bite of its little brother into the taste of pine resin.

10099,9086,HopHeadKen,4.08,"Wow ! I had not talked with anyone or read any reviews prior to trying this beer. I like Imperial IPA's and was wondering why this was about $8 ber bottle.  It comes across to me as more of a Barleywine than Imperial IPA.  Served at cellar temp (60 deg F) Pours clear golden yellow with thick white head that slowly dissapates. You can sense the viscosity during the pour.  Smell is alcohol, crisp hops and sweet malt.  The alcohol comes thru first. I did not know what the ABV was until I pulled up the beer to review . . 21% ! ! Wow, its clearly there. The malt is SWEET and I get a vanilla character to the taste.  The mouthfeel is thick and viscous, you can sense a huge amount of grain boiled into a sweet syrup thickness.  Drinkability - Price and availability make this a difficult beer to consider a regular, but it sure is a treat. I have another to savor for some future day.  IF I consider this a Barleywine instead of an I2PA, I have to say that I like the Immort-Ale by DFH better (especially for desert).",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,RedChrome,4.12,"A clear light orange copper blend. White head of inch and a half sunk slowly in glass. Large amount of medium sized carbonation bubbles can be seen rising to the top. Sheets of lace all the way down glass.  A strange blend of aromas. The first smell as a very fruity initial scent. A hops quality is citric. The initial smell ends with a noticable spike of alcohol. Light lemon aroma blends with malt sweetness nicely.  Super sweet malt taste finished with a burn that betrays the alcohol content to an otherwise sweet, fragrent beer. Nice hops bitter on the back of the tongue. A light fruit blend is present, and includes tangering and grapefruit.  A thicker then average body. Very nice carbonation helps the multiple flavors shift on the tongue.  A great offering int he style. Great beer to enjoy with a burger topped with pepper jack cheese. This one is not for the faint of heart. A monster alcohol taste would turn a lot of people away.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,jasonguit,4.77,"Yikes!  This beer is good - damn good. Why start off a review as such? Because as so many have mentioned, this beer is 21%. In fact, there is a good chance you, the reader, know this. You might wonder what such a big beer tastes like, so you have come here. Well, it tastes pretty much like Dogfish Head's other IPA offerings, and there in lies the problem.  The beer has a typical deep gold/amber appearance that good IPAs have and about a finger of head that quickly falls away.  It smells very fruity and floral. Inviting very definitely.  Taste - Very sweet. I actually like it quite a bit. The malt sweetness plays well off of the hops. None of the hop character is lost as it still maintains a bite. I think the apricot description earlier was very apropos.  It has a nice, tingly mouth feel. Very crisp, not heavy, but certainly not watery. It will certainly excite your taste buds.  This beer is WAY too drinkable to be as strong as it is. If you are familiar with Stone IPA or the Dogfish Head 90, expect this to be just as drinkable. You simply have to make an effort to pace yourself.  All in all it was worth the $8 I spent on it. It is a very neat beer, well executed, and I have enjoyed it. Actually, I'm glad it doesn't cost less. If I could afford to purchase several of these I would probably hate myself tomorrow.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,DarkBeerGuy,4.42,"Upon opening this bottle the strong odor of alcohol was mask slightly by a fruity, pleasant aroma. I poured it without expecting a head, yet one appeared. I was surprised by its creamy and foggy color.  The robust flavor of hops is present from start to finish. This was an enjoyable beer that I would purchase again. Its not too often a high concentrate of alcohol (20%) tastes this smooth. A super, nice beer to start the evening with .",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,carln26,3.99,"Extremely hazy with a light fluffy head that receded quickly into the glass. There is just a light residue settling to the bottom as I examine the beer. I'm still shocked that there is any head on the beer at all with the amount of alcohol present. The nose is a citrus bomb. Loads of grapefruit, pine, and herbal hop pour from the beer. Mild mandarin orange sweetness on the finish. Sharp grapefruit and mandarin orange sweetness up front, mild caramel notes are dominated by the hop. The finish has mild alcohol heat. It's there, but I can't believe there isn't more. The mouth feel is mildly sticky, still full. Decent drinkability. This is a big, hoppy beer. Not the best drinkability. It's more of an event.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Byeast,4.82,"Appearance: deep , hazy orange / auburn , with a half inch of foam that dissipates quickly to a ring. A fair amount of lacing left on the chalice.  Smell: A multitude of hop aromas assault the senses once you take this wonderful brew to the nose. Citric , piney , oily , green , and a presence of alcohol.  Taste: The hops ride all over your tongue , filling the mouth with an awsome spectacle of what the humulus lupulus is capable of. Mouthfilling , oily , resinous flavors of pine , citrus , slightly floral , earthy(green) , and a bit spicy combined with the warming alcohol. Hop Heaven! As strong as the flavors are , none of them effect the taste in a negitive way.  Mouthfeel: oily , chewy , viscous  Drinkability: For it ABV this beer is remarkably drinkable.

10099,9086,mmcave,4.7,"Finally found this, at whole foods of all places, I must give props to kim for getting hold of some. 12 oz was about 9 dollars total with tax, not bad, I heard it was 12 in Colorado. Poured aggressively in a tulip glass, the head was immense, thick and bubbly. Lovely white sticky lacing is every where. The color is a dense musty orange, amber, with darker tones centering about the lower middle. The sent is great, to the best of imperial IPA, lots of hop character balanced well with sweet malt notes. Fruit and sugar all over the place. There is a small hint of Alcohol; it is possible that this sent only occurs to me because apparently this beers ABV is 21. I definitely do not smell 21 Abv in this, which makes this a deliciously dangerous beer. Honestly I think theyve done an excellent job concealing it. I must say that of all the strong beers Ive had this one is the beer you should be most careful of. At about 9 dollars a 12 oz I doubt Id buy it all the time, but since its around so little Ill buy every one I can just to show off to friends. Also Im cellaring this beers brother for one year from now. This beer is not too different from any great double IPA at 9 abv, but this is a 21 and delicious, so be careful.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

This is certainly one of the more expensive little buys out there; the pour shows a more golden-amber glow than expected. First nose impression is ""this stuff is not nearly as harsh as I thought all this octane would deliver"". Second nose impression is - ""if I didn;t read up on this, I'd not have known the octane - this stuff's aroma is more tart"".  The taste is Samichlaus smooth, moreso if that is possible. The finish is a nice hoppy one. Mouthfeel is Olympic medal winning quality.  All in all, this 192 dollar a case drink is All That.

A: Looked exactly how a strong, extremely hopped up IPA should look. Rich, golden, full of character.  S: The smell was incredible. If you love the smell of fresh hops you will love smelling this beer. Smells a lot like kind nuggets of a plant in the same family.  T: The taste is pure heaven. It's sweet & beyond hoppy. The quality and attention to detail in the brewing process really comes through with each and every sip.  M: This beer left my mouth wanting more every time I swallowed. If only it weren't so expensive, I could indulge myself in it's excellence more often.  D: A sipper. I could drink it faster if I weren't so overly concerned with making sure that I thoroughly enjoy every sip. Plus, if I drank it too fast I might not be able to get back off the couch. After drinking just 4 ounces of this beer I felt great.  If you love hops and IPAs then I highly recommend trying this beer.

Poured a slightly hazy copper with a large off-white creamy mostly lasting head with good lacing.  Smelt of strongly of candied pineapples, cookies, pecan pie, moderate pine.  Taste was upfront harshly sweet fruitcake, pineapple, maple syrup, brandy, followed by a strong sweet dough and gelatin with light herbs on a infinitely cloying finish. Palate was full bodied, viscous, softly carbonated, almost flat, and mouth-coating.  Overall, it was really good as a dessert beer. Lots of fun tastes and smells to discover. Sickeningly cloying and disappoint hop bitterness. The malt sweetness dominates over the taste of the hops. Alcohol , albeit present, is well covered by the sugar though.  Huge props to JesseDaniels for sharing this and not liking, thus my drinking the majority of it and getting a good alcohol rip.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,mobud,4.32,"Served: Shared a bottle with a friend. Used small cocktail glasses due to lack of proper glassware.  Appearance: Poured slowly and produced a light head that disappeared after a while due to my slow and paced sipping. The color was bright, almost glowing and on the cloudy side.  Smell: The hop smell grabs you and pulls your nose in to it. There is a sweet candy undertone, but the hops really is the star here.  Taste: The sweet hoppy character is followed by a reminder that this is a high alcohol beer.  Mouthfeel: The thickness of this beer, not really visable to the eye, stays with you after you sip and swallow. The candy flavor gave way to a light floral feel.  Drinkability: This is a great beer, but one for special moments. The cost ($8.00 for 12 oz) may scare folks, but I have seen people pay more money for less of an experience.

This beer polarizes the beer faithful: some think it went too far, others love it. I enjoyed it quite a bit. It's an experiment - I've heard it described as a ""pixie stick hop bomb"" - but I think it does what it does well. It's a thick, viscous syrup - think afterdinner drink (and at roughly 20% ABV, it's proofed like one). The aroma is afterdinner drinkish too - sweet almost plum brandy. It's sweet, it's hops-in-your-face, it's overboard - all that it's supposed to be, but also quite tasty. The version I had was from 2004, so the hops have likely mellowed out a bit.

I was slammed by the first sip, belly warming alcohol lets you know this is not a beer to mess around with. But then the flavors start coming through in waves, up front were strong malty flavors, raisins, plum, dates, and molassas. Then the balancing hop profile started comming through, strong floral and citrus flavors, orange, apricot, tangerine, peach, and more. In my notes I wrote ""its boozy like bourbon or cogniac.

Not only because its the strongest (in terms of ABV) brew I have ever purchased, but also because I knew it would be like molten hops pouring out the bottle....yummy!  First impression, it is a deep copper, almost amber color with a modest white head. Plenty of lacing on the glass. The smell is amazing, very hopy. No hint of alcohol in the smell at all. It tastes equally as good, very sweet, hopy, and spicy. This brew has excellent body, it feels very ""full"" in your mouth. I would say this is one of the most drinkable brews out there. You are assaulted with amazing smells and tastes with every sip and gulp. At only the halfway point you begin to feel the affects of the alcohol, even though I found it difficult to detect the presence of 21% in the smell or taste. Most brews that are over 10% have a heavy impact in the taste by the alcohol.  This IPA is the holy grail for the hopheads out there...highly recommend this one. It is definitely worth the premium price! Another excellent product from Dogfish Head!

10099,9086,scruffwhor,3.49,"Poured from a 12oz. bottle from the first batch this year.  Appearance- A strong amber with hints of anti-freeze translucence. The bubbles for this IPA are clearly slowed by the amount of alcohol mand malt sweetness visible in just the color. Some mediocre head, looks like any nromal, run-of-the-mill IPA.  Smell- Not at all like any IPA I've had before. Insanely sweet. Is there even hops in this??? Sweet caramel candied apples drizzled with Skol vodka. I thinks it's sort of cool because of the shot before you even taste the beer.  Taste- Starts with more Amaretto like swetness that quickly develops into a more malt intensity beer than hops. The flavor lets you know they added insane amounts of mlats and removed water to just boost the abv. But it is unique for its resiny sweet, toasty malts. Almost like biting into a caramel apple with two inches of caramel and only haalf of a whole apple in the center. This will be my relaxing nightcap beer.  Mouthfeel- An almost over bearing malt sweetness mixed with an alcoholic burn never felt before in any burn. These new sensations in this highly heralded IPA are very intriguing because they break the mold for any normal IPA. The bitterness is there, but only a little due to the crazy amounts of malkt. Drank like it was fine cognac.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

A.- Clear, deep golden color topped with a huge head of foam that leaves plenty of lacing down the sides of my Corsendonk tulip glass.  S.- Sweet, smell of some sort of hops. Doesn't remind me of any particular variety of hops - just sweet, probably due to the vast amount of malt used to balance the hops. Cookie dough, perhaps?  T. - Sweet, almost cloyingly sweet, yet at the same time the hop bite makes itself known. The sweetness hits the tip of the tongue while the bitterness hits the back of the tongue. This beer certainly walks the knife edge between bitter and sweet. Also present is a fruity note, something similar to pineapple and apricot mixed together. Alcohol is noticeable with the first several sips and then falls into the background, maybe due to the effect of the hop bitterness.  MF.- Lucious. Silky. Coats the tongue.  D.- Honestly - how can anyone take more than one of these with such an ABV? This beer is twice as strong as the typical Belgian Strong Dark or Tripel. Almost like a whisky. It's a sipper, that's for sure!  Overall: I've had this beer laying around in storage for a good 4 or 5 months just waiting for a special occassion to try it. I'm glad I waited for my half century mark to sample this beast. Now I can say I've had the 60, 90, and 120 minute IPAs from DFH.

A: The beer is a light amber color, with a short foamy white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.  S: The aroma is strong with wheat alcohol, hops, honey & caramelized malt. I was expecting a bit more hops in it though.  T: The flavor is boozy, but with a 21.00% ABV, it was what I anticipated on that front. What I hadn’t anticipated was the intense syrupy, honey & brown sugar sweetness that accompanied the sting of the alcohol. There’s a little bit of hops there, but it’s simply over-powered. Knowing what the 60 & 90 Minute IPA’s are like, I definitely thought that there would be a heck of a lot more hop character in this one. The only real hops significance comes out a little bit in the after-taste as the beer warmed some.  M: Smooth for something so powerful, medium body, medium carbonation, oily & sticky finish.  O: Even though this beer isn’t filling and is very flavorful, I can’t see how this beer can’t see how it can be anything else but a sipper with such a huge ABV.

The nose held citrusy fruit caramel, malt, spices (cinnamon maybe), and pine undertones.  Immediately I can taste the alcohol along with an oily sugarness that coats your lips. At first i tasted the hops but they seem to be less noticeable after a few drinks which is a let down. I also taste raisins and caramel. Infact it reminds me of the mexican desert ""flaun"" Creamy with caramel sauce and cinnamon on top.  This was a very good beer because of its uniqueness but lacked the hops I was hoping for in a true IPA The complexity was decieving, the first drink really is the best..

A good pour gives you a huge two finger thick off white head that never quite dissappates and leaves a lot on the glass. The brew itself is golden orange on the bottom and has a deep orange halo around the edge of the glass. Beautiful coloring to the brewers!  The smell is intense! Of everything. Of alcohol, fruits, malts, and of course... HOPS!  Very sweet and oily at the begining. The orange, grapefruit, pineapple are very present in the tongue. Tastes strangely of vodka for some reason. The fruits really overpower the taste buds and there are lots of hops but you feel them going down, lots of hop burn. The fruity feel wasn't what I was expecting this style. You can really feel the booze in here. 20% is a lot. The finish is very very fruity and full of bitterness of the hops. Burns my mouth just thinking of it.  You definitely need to sip this one.

Warming alcohol-infused hop resin; hop oils practically jumping from the glass. Smooth, cognac-soaked fruity esters: peach, pear, green apple. Creamy, sweet maltiness with vanilla tones.  Big sweetness up front: vanilla, honey; that lasts into the aftertaste. Liquid hop oils; hints of pear, melon. Floral hop hints and just a touch of pine. Very warming alcohol presence that works wonders with the creamy sweetness. In terms of flavor, reminiscent of a brandy flavored with maple or vanilla. Liquid gold to my tastebuds.  Medium in body; blissfully smooth and creamy on the palate. It doesn't get smoother than this for an ale this big.  If you're expecting a gruff, American hop monster filled with pine and citrus hop flavors...you'll be in for a surprise.

Pours a golden amber, with a small head and swirls from the collision of alcohol and water, almost like looking at a tequila anejo swirling in water. Tastefully extreme bitterness, coupled with sugary syrup and noticeable but delicate alcohol. Like novocain for the tongue and hot butterscotch for the throat, and a sweet beer reduction left on the lips. Numbing hops and numbing alcohol. A note of saccharin. Side note: it would make a great beer sorbet or salad dressing, or a sweet marinade or beer demi glaze for that matter. A near-liquor concoction with chewy malts and bitter oily hops galore. A real palate-killer, so save this one for last. If you like whiskey, rum, or tequila, you'll love this one.

S: Heavy fruit hops with grapefruit, orange, lemon, passion fruit, and pine all are noticeable. Spicyness of the high abv is bold. Sweet wafer notes also. T/M: Holy crap what a huge body this brew has! Big massive juicy mango, orange, and grapefruit fruityness with luscious pine notes. Extra sweet with a big spicyness that stings the taste buds and combines with a bold bitterness that hangs out. Creamy, oily, and resiny crawl across the tongue. Extra sticky with a sweet sugary residue left on the lips. It seems that as this beer warms it gets thicker and more syrupy. Not extremely bitter as I thought it was going to be. The back of my neck is getting warm---extra warming in the chest and head. D: Ahhh, drinkable? Drinkable how? quantity?--no way. It's worth getting a hold of even at the steep price tag (~$9). 21% abv--Holy Crap! Definately a sipping beer---and only one at a time!

It smells of sweet malt and hops, but the sweetness comes through in the aroma...almost like a high gravity wort that you would be putting into your fermenter.  The flavor is sweet syrupy maltiness. The hops are certainly present, but the sweetness dominates.  Mouthfeel is full.  This beer is worth trying, but for the price, not more than once or twice. It is more the style of a Samiclaus than a I2PA, but not as complex or balanced as that beer. I know it's hyped, and I do like Dogfish Head beers a lot, but this beer is not for me. I am tempted to get a bottle to age for several years, but only a little tempted.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,drotski,4.22,"Poured a hazy honey color, with a thick foamy head. Nice lacing on glass.  Smelled very very hoppy, smelled just like fresh hops. As a homebrewer, this is a delightful smell.  Tasted at first, quite hoppy (citrus and spice especially), but was surprisingly sweet. The outragous alcohol content was nicely masked. Indeed a very big beer.  Sort of thick in the mouth, hiding the alcohol (considering its 20+%, impossible to hide, but you know what I mean).  Drinkability is a hard one. Its good enough to keep drinking, but you wouldn't want to drink too many. A 12 oz of this is like 6oz of vodka. A little goes a long ways.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,terrabyte,1.39,"This poured a very cloudy orange color. Almost half the glass was full of foam. Careful pouring this.  Although there was a quick frenzy of smells when I first poured this beer, it subdued into almost nothing quite quickly. As I waited for the foam to settle, the smell settled down to a dull fruity musk.  The flavor will make you stop what you're doing. Even if all you're doing is drinking beer. I'm immediately reminded of ""Four O"", a malt liquor by La Crosse brewing that is ranked at 10% ABV. It's high dextrose content gave off a solvent and fuel like flavor. While that beer tried its best to mask that flavor, this beer fails at it. I'm still not finished drinking this beer, and I've gone off and read about 20 reviews, 3 beer style reviews, and read all my email since I started the bottle and this review. I've been making bitter beer face the whole time.  This beer is too thick, too sugary, too sweet, too strong. And here I thought I was going to be hopped to death? The hop flavor takes a back seat to the syrup flavor.  This won't stop me from buying another bottle and hiding it in the basement for a decade. After all, it does say on the side of the bottle:  ""What you have here is the holy grail for hopheads. This beer is continually hopped over a 120-minute boil and then dry-hopped every day for a month. Enjoy now or age for a decade or so.""",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,ggaughan,3.9,"Although I have had 120 minute several times before and I have a handful in my cellar, I am reviewing this from my last sampling of it, at the DFH brewery at about 10am during the bocce tournament. The beer poured a deep caramel, almost deep brown color with a slight offwhite head. The nose was caramelly and also a bit fruity and sweet, all the while with the high abv lurking in the nose. The taste is extreme as can be expected and pretty sweet. I felt that at times I could feel sugar swishing around in my mouth but not overpoweringly sweet like a syrupy beer. There is a nice hop bitterness amongst the sweetness and the high abv (about 18% on this version I think) really comes through and kicks you at the end...also in the middle.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,redsahx,4.25,"** Special notes: Beer had been bottled for 6 months. Drank this bottle more on the ""cold"" side ~ 40 deg  I had been looking forward to trying this beer for a while and was finally able to locate a great store not too far away that carried it. I was a big fan of the 90 minute IPA, but was looking to try this more out of curiosity, than actually expecting a great taste.  I must say I was very surprised at the ""drinkability"" of this beer considering it's 21% abv. Prior to this, the strongest beer I have tasted was Dogfish Head's Immort Ale at 11%, which was also on the sweet side. I enjoyed it thoroughly but cannot justify giving it any higher than a 4 on the drinkability scale given that it doesn't go down ""easy"" compared to most beers.  I was very surprised at how sweet it tastes. Dogfish's 90 minute and 60 minute IPA have a much more typical IPA taste. I probably drank this beer at a lower temperature than intended, but it wasn't frosted by any means. I assumed I would be drinking it slowly so I gave it a little extra chill, so one can keep that in mind when reading this.  I agree with those who sense a ""caramel-like"" or butterscoth taste. Was very rich, and while the alcohol could be sensed, it didn't dominate the taste. I will definitely be trying this one again, perhaps at different ages. I'd like to get a hold of a few that have spent multiple years in safe storage. I'd definitely recommend it to those willing to spend $9 on a 12oz bottle.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

A generic hop flavor and and aroma were present, but indistinct and battling the intense sweet butterscotch/caramel malt. Bitterness was barely perceptible against an intensely thick, almost cloying sweetness.To its credit, it was not undrinkable, but half a glass was as much as was possible to get down comfortably. This was the 2006, I can't imagine how much less hoppy this could get when aged.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Pours a lovely caramel color with a fine long lasting head. It's a beautiful thing.  The aroma of caramel is the first thing to hit your nose, kinda strange for an IPA. After that the more common smell of hops show up along with a notable alcohol scent.  The taste is not at all what I was expecting but it quite nice. A caramel flavor starts this beer out and fades to a faint hop flavor along with a slight alcohol punch in the end.  Gotta say I really enjoyed this brew, it was worth the wait and the cost.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,peabody,4.04,"pours out very cloudy lemmony tea with no suds at all. Flat beer here. I suppose the alcohol took care of the carbonation. smells like whiskey or a strong plum wine. Lacing occours as the stuff warms up. Mmmm, taste is like apricot brandy. Delicious, this doesn't taste like beer, but is does taste good. caramel and sugar abound, and the hops are not here!!! If you don't like IPA because of the hops, then this is your beer.. Mouthfeel is like a peice of sweet hard candy that is made with burboun. Warms you right up! I couldn't drink more than one of these at a sitting but still, it is a pretty great beer. Dogfish Head kicks ass!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Skidz,4.97,"2003 Edition, 12oz bottle. Constantly kept cold since purchasing way back when.  This sampling spurred by a roomate opening the bottle and commenting, ""gee, this beer tastes funny."" Split the beer with him.  Pours out golden amber and sits light garnet in the glass with a smallish white head, keeping a fair skimming and some lacings around the sides.  Amazingly fruity aroma, even after all these years. Soft, juicy grapefruits, oranges, pear with undertones of late-harvest grapes. Mild piney behavior, sugary coatings.  Tastes moderately sweet up front with sugary caramel up and down. Fruitiness dominates, all the afromentioned fruity aromas apply here as well, but in big, sugary doses. Mildly apparent alcoholic tones bring forth a bit of spiciness on the finish.  Rich, creamy and rich, rich, rich in the mouth. Soft and light carbonation and a big, full body.  Even at 21% (was the '03 that high?) this is extrodinarily and exceptionally easy to drink and boasts probably some of the best flavor arrangements I've ever come across. As far as highly suped-up IPAs go, this is on the top rung. Almost no contest.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

10099,9086,BDTyre,3.76,"Purchased June 2006 and allowed to settle and age for a few months.  Starts off looking good, even though the head is a little thick. Amber to burnt orange colour. Very vibrant, almost like some Belgians I've seen.  Smell is off for an IPA, especially a DIPA. Hoppy, but not bitter and not too hoppy. Malt presence. However, the scent I pick up most is a blend of alcohol and candy sugar with a hint of spice, almost like a tripel.  Well balanced taste. Very hoppy with definite bitterness, but this is countered but a big blast of malts. Very sweet, almost syrupy. Again, I can taste candy sugar. This is almost like a Belgian-style DIPA. Very noticeable alcohol profile.  Decent mouthfeel. Thick, maybe undercarbonated but not unpleasant. Alcohol burn is somewhat distracting.  Okay, its good, tasty and I would buy it again...maybe even age it a few years. But it is not so drinkable...you can really feel the alcohol in this one. And at 20% (my bottle is 20%, not 21%), to think you wouldn't notice the alcohol is just silly.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,BradBLR,4.33,"WOW, another great Beer from Dogfish Head. This beer poured a nice dark amber color with a very white head. The head was thin, but lasted most of the beer with fairly good lacing. The smell was that of a sweet malt and hops... lots of hops.  The taste was not what I expected. I thought it would be SUPER hoppy, but I was suprise how good this beer was. The taste was a nice balance of hops and malt. The malt had a distinct sweetness to it that help balance it self with all the hops. There was also the taste of alcohol, but that is to be expected with a beer with this much alcohol. The mouthfeel was good, it was a fairly thick beer, but it lacked a little in the CO2 department. There was a nice burn that you don't get from many beers.  Another great beer from DFH, not a beer that I would drink every day or every week for that mater. A very interesting beer that is alot more complex than some people give it credit for. I say it's worth the price to try and you should pick one up if you can.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,jarsh,3.83,"Presentation: A 12 brown bottle. Kinda cocky stating ""The Imperial India Pale Ale"". Bottled on date of 03/03/06, not as fresh as I would have liked.  Appearance: Pours a nice ruby red. Decent off white head that dissipated to a pankake right in the middle of my glass.  Smell: This is one odoriferous brew. The alcohol makes itself known on the first sniff. Additional, softer sniffs reveal a fruity sweetness, which is actually nice once you get down to it.  Taste: Again the alcohol is very evident in this beer, but really at 20%AC it should be expected. Very full and syrupy mouthfeel. It starts off hot and sweet, you feel it going down and warms your belly. Hop character is definately there and hangs on the back of your tounge but the hope bite that I was expecting was not there. I definately enjoyed it more over the course of the hour or so I was sipping it. As it warms the alcohol subsides and lets more of the flavor out.  Overall: For the ""Holy Grail for Hopheads"" I was a little disappointed. A little too sweet for my tastes. I understand and respect DFH for what they were going for here and I did enjoy this beer and I will have it again, in about a year when the other one I bought has aged a bit.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

10099,9086,Deconstructionis,1.59,"This beer had been lavishly praised by a friend but it can't be had where I live, so when I saw it on a trip, I bought a 4 pack. I was very disappointed (The price is absurd-- ahh, the wonders of marketing). I found it had no balance and the hops were so overpowering the only other flavor besides unadorned sweetness I could really distinguish was a strong raw alcohol. Rather than a malty flavor, it tasted more ""woody"" and sugary as if pine bark and molasses were part of the wort.  I was impatient and drank the first one after only a short stay in the fridge. The best description I could come up with would be ultra-sweetened hop tea mixed with grain alcohol added to a run of the mill IPA..  Maybe I got a bad batch but I did not think it was good at all. It was essentially undrinkable lukewarm and I had to chill it to the point my palate was numbed for it not to be unpleasant.  If we want to give points for extremism. that's one thing, but if tasting good and being pleasurable to drink are criteria this one fails.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Foxman,3.93,"It pours a rubyorangebrown, coppery and cloudy. A thick finger of frothy off-white head piles on, then ebbs slowly to a pillow of foam. Lacing is plentiful and puffy.  The aroma is very thick with candy-coated and malt sweetness, sugary and with plum, caramel, a very vague spiciness. The alcohol is decidedly manly, with tendrils that ooze and plunder.  Upon tasting, the honey and sugar sweetness invades again, but this time more mitigated by sloe fruit, caramel, and a vinous port splash. The hops are more notable here as well, with a strained but present citrus note. The alcohol is more incorporated, sending a whiskey-like message through the center. A credible bitterness struggles near the close, losing out to the residual and long-lingering grain and honey sweetness. While absolutely massive, it presents itself with considerable manners, and a plesant, though sweet, profile.  Very full bodied, it's more than syrup, it's treacle and honey, laying cloyingly on the palate, though with the merest hop bitter glow in tow.  Like it or not, this is one beer that is guaranteed to induce a ""wow!"" What's amazing to me is how understated the hops present, knowing the prodigious amounts used. And yet, with the scale weighted to the grain and sugary fermentables, it still does come through as quite bitter and hoppy, though in the background, not upfront. The ABV is glaring in the nose, but decidedly more down-tempo in the taste, or as understated as 21% can possibly be.

This beer has a delectable nose of caramel, orange peel, a slight hop spiciness, and some brandyish boozy smell.  This is a sweet treat with a long finish. Just as much a treat for malt heads as hop heads, and probably more so. Very sweet, perfect for an after dinner quaffer. Spicy with hops and coriander up front, then a long, long malt bomb with very nuanced flavors of dried apricots and cherries, spice, and honey. This is followed by a long finish of honey spiked piney hops. Delicious now, but this would be absolutely extraordinary with some serious age on it. There is the slightest soy note that dissipates as it breathes.  The mouthfeel is very thick and rich with good carbonation throughout, something that I miss dearly in certain other over the top abv brews.

10099,9086,MuddyFeet,3.94,Received this 12 ounce bottle for Christmas from my brother. I have had it cellared since but decided to drink it with my upcoming move down South and all.  Poured a tangerine brown in color with a thick-ish white head. Layered lace around the edges of the glass while the head slowly receded. Nose was phenomenal. Deep and musky with some woodiness and just bits of cherries around the edges.  Flavor is not as whacked out as I expected. There is a bit of heat from the alcohol but the burn is not nearly what I would have imagined. Kind of a fruit/cherry juice thing going on and a wood aged tannin flavor too. Malts are surprisingly strong and hold up quite well. Best part is that the hops are not nearly as astringent as I imagined. Medium mouthfeel that improves as the beer warms but in the sense that the beer evaporates off the tongue and becomes more light bodied. Nice beer but not sure I have much interest in trying a second bottle.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Had an odd stench when I opened the bottle, but after letting it breathe for a minute or two, what you get is a very sweet malty nose, with a hint of alcohol. Nowhere near as much alcohol as you'd expect from something 21% though.  Taste...wow. Very malty, very sweet, and with just the right amount of hops to balance out all of that. Manages to taste of raisins, plums, and lemon at the same time, which sounds impossible until you try it. Only a hint of alcohol on the finish keeps this from being absolutely perfect.  An expensive bottle, but absolutely worth every penny. A must try.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,EPICAC,3.58,"This was purchased at Downtown Wine & Spirits a few months ago. I've been putting off trying it because of the high alcohol and high IBUs, but decided to give it a try tonight. I let this warm and served it in one of my Duvel tulips.  Appearance: Pours a hazy copper with a thick, fluffy, creamy, off-white head that leaves thick lace. For such a high alcohol beer the thickness and retention are striking. The head thins to a persistent quarter-inch layer.  Smell: Sweet sugar and caramel dominate. The aroma of spicy alcohol is also very strong. There are notes of citric and resiny hops, but these are surprisingly low.  Taste: The initial flavors are very sweet. The sweetness is reminiscent of raw sugar. Towards the center the sweetness becomes fruitier before being met by a strong spicy alcohol flavor. The finish is resiny hops mixed with residual sweetness. Overall the bitterness, though noticeable and significant is overpowered by the malty sweetness.  Mouthfeel: Low carbonation, full-bodied and syrupy.  Drinkability: The alcohol is noticeable, but it definitely doesn't seem like a 20% abv beer.  Overall: Definitely tasty, but the hop bitterness is overpowered by the malty sweetness. I was hoping that the balance would tip towards hops rather than malts.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Omniscia,3.28,"Serving: 12 oz bottle purchased from Martignetti Liquors on Cross Street, in Boston, poured into a standard American pint glass.  Appearance: Lovely, hazy golden color, like clover honey. Tall, two-finger head developed upon pouring, leaving an uneven lacing behind, confined mostly to one side of the glass.  Smell: Sweet, though not cloying. Somewhat like a barleywine.  Taste: The taste definitely leaves something to be desired. The hops, if they are indeed present, are completely overpowered by the malt. A strong medicinal character is present, as well. It's like Robitussin mixed with Ridge Runner... Too fracking sweet!  Mouthfeel: Velvety smooth. It has a definite thickness in the mouth, again reminiscent of honey. It's surprisingly fluid for something that feels so viscous on the palate.  Drinkability: Well, it goes down well, and provides a nice buzz within the first few sips, but it's nowhere near as quaffable as its siblings, the 60 Minute and 90 Minute IPAs.  Overall: An interesting experiment, to be sure, but not something that's likely to take up residence in my cellar and, at nearly $9 a bottle, that's not necessarily a bad thing.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Taste is amazingly sweet with a bit of alcohol on the finish and a small amount of hops trying to come through. The finish actually reminds me of cotton candy it is so sweet. Mouthfeel is very rich and creamy. This is not a beer that has a high drinkability, this is something that you split a 12oz bottle of with a friend. Definately worth a try if you can find it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Smell is sweet, caramelly malt up front, hops very faint but present, slightly grainy and grassy, followed by some light alcohol notes that finish out the nose. Taste is super sweet, huge alcohol presence, no suprise there, leaves a crisp and dry aftertaste with a hoppy bitterness. Mouthfeel is slippery and smooth, fuller bodied with low carbonation. Drinkability is impressive given the extreme +20% abv, sips smooth and wonderfully complex balancing act between some super heavy sweet maltiness and heavy hops.

Then the alcohol hits, strongly, but it doesn't seem like 21%. There is a lot of risidual sweetness in the finish. All in all, the sweetness is the most dominating characteristic. The taste really is much more similar to a barley wine than any other double IPA I've had. In fact I've many barleywines with a more noticable hop character than this. The mouthfeel is very smooth and rather heavy. This isn't very drinkable. But it's not meant to be. Overall this is pretty good stuff and amazingly smooth for the alcohol.

Smell. A very rich and potent hoppy and yeasty aroma. Smells like a very hoppy belgian tripel or bspa.  Taste. WOW. Very potent. Has a sweet and bitter taste. These hops have a bit of an earthy taste... i need to research and see what hops they have here cuz it is quite interesting. They dominate the flavor, but there is also that belgian characteristic that is quite noticable. There is a warming sensation from the alcohol during the swallow and aftertaste is still full of hops.  Mouthfeel is very full from the alcohol. It also gives a syrupy sensation that is getting quite sticky. Balance is heavy on the hops, but still seems balanced in the mouthfeel. Carbonation is more than i expected.  Overall one hell of an experience! this one is not for the faint of heart. I really could have this one again and again, as long as it isnt in repeating days.

10099,9086,UberWasser,4.25,"12oz bottle served in a snifter.  Popping the top on this beer illicits a suprising pop and gun smoke for a beer of this ABV. Usually I expect them to be rather limp, at least in the carbonation department, but not this time...which follows suit on the pour, when a copper orange beer, with a slight haze, comes to rest in the glass with a finger or two of off-white head. It does dissipate quickly, but it leaves a nice halo and film of bubbles on the top of the beer for a while. Quite attractive.  Taking a deep sniff brings up some pleasent stuff...a strong sweet malt/alcohol smell with just enough orange citrus hop presence to give it some balance. Also slightly peppery. Smells pretty good.  But then the taste...pretty good too? No. Much better. The very first taste you get from this is a strong candy sweetness on the tip of the tongue. As it moves further back, a subtle pepper and herb taste with a bit of saltiness spreads slow over the middle. As the beer hits the back of the mouth a nice floral and orange citrus hop flavor makes itself known, mixing in with the sweetness rather than overpowering it. After the swallow both flavors stay for a long time, leaving the mouth with an orange candy finish as the ABV goes to work as your throat tingles and your cheeks warm up. Mouthfeel is nicely slick and creamy, helping all of this flavor stick to your mouth.  I must say, this is a disturbingly well-balanced beer for how hugely powerful it is. I could, if I didn't know better, finish this off pretty quick, only to find myself planted to the floor, most likely. I really like this...though it is NOT something I would drink more than one of (which is why I ding the drinkability) or buy that often (dollar/oz ratio is a bit rough and I'm not out to get drunk) but yeah, I'm very glad that I tried it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,GratefulBeerGuy,4.38,"Original review below. A Re-review follows notated with *.  Lookin' a pale Golden Amber, clear, lots of activity, 3"" Foamy Vibrant head. Great Head retention. Fantastic lacing from top to bottom.  Smells: Thick-sweet malt and hops overdose. Floral and fruity hops over Maple syrup. you can easily smell the heat from the 21% ABV.  Taste: I know DFH creates some sweet-dominated brews...this one is on another level. Maple syrup, molasses in the heady malt with a sick amount of mildly-bitter, fruity and citrusy hops...it's like drinking hoppy maple syrup with a high alcohol content.  This brew Really has exceptional feel, Medium/Full body, syrup-thick but plenty active with good carbonation. You can actually feel the alcohol going down like a scotch whisky when the bottle is fresh, the aged version of this brew is different with a more laid back hop and less heat from the alcohol. My lips are actually sticky from this stuff!  This is an extreme brew, Ultra-sweet, Super hoppy and heady. Mega ABV % that limits this to a maximum of two. If you can handle two!  4/28/17 review . this version is 16.5% abv. Ages well.....yes it does. This one is fresh. Bottled on 3/16/17 just over one month old.  12 oz. Bottle into a Dogfishhead signature glass.  Amber color with golden highlights. A short foam cap is created, lays out flat pretty fast. A light ring of foam around the edges remains.  A very dense aroma of sweet fruity hops eminates from the glass. Wild honey malt and multiple layers of dank hops. Big and sharp alcohol heat blends well with the caramel and honey sweet tones. As the liquid warms, it becomes much more tangy and wild hop thing with even more impressive alcohol filled sweet malt complexity.  BOOZY first sip, honey and caramel sweetness in the full-on malt attack. The hops come rolling in thick shortly after, with a whole-cone and dry hopped complexity that has multiple layers. A long, heat tingles and warms, thick, full-bodied mouthfeel comes from the fat malty complexity. I've always felt this too be more of a hop bomb than a high-alpha hop bomb. The sweet and dank malt takes over the feel and most of the taste. The hops never really have a serious high-alpha bitter bite, especially for being seriously dry hopped. Tastes more wet-hopped to my palate.  As the liquid warms, there is a smokey, woody, cask, barrel-aged taste to the malt, making it even more interesting and complex. The hops become a bit more high alpha and bitter as well.  The 120 minute Imperial IPA has set the bar soo high for extreme brews, it really hasn't been eclipsed. A radical brewing alchemy that still impresses me with it's massive complexity. Certainly the top-draw at the craft brew carnival freak show!!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,hunteraw,3.88,"Appearance: Poured from the bottom of the keg, with a huge stiff head that lasted to the bottom of the glass. Copper color, very nice looking beer.  Smell: sweet, floral hops, and a good bit of alcohol.  Taste: much like the smell, but stronger. This is an intense beer! sweeter than I think I'd prefer, but well worth seeking out.  Mouthfeel: slightly syrupy, this was a low-point.  Drinkability: found myself wishing I'd gotten more beer and less head from the pour, but it was complimentary so no complaints! That said, the huge alcohol content limits drinkability.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,sopclod,4.08,"This beer is so off the wall that it's prompted me to do my very first review.  Others stated that it has a lot of sugary sweetness, but I figured they were just being colorful... boy was I wrong! This is like a glass of maple syrup with alcohol in it.  For me the taste was so striking that I really didn't notice the sky-high abv. I sure felt after I finished off my 12oz bottle though.  I would definitely be interested to see what this is like after being salaried for a couple of years or even, as the bottle suggests, decades.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

10099,9086,Toddv29424,4.41,"Pours with a hazy golden color, with a cascade effect like I have never seen before. Much like a cream ale with the white top floating lightly on the beer down below, and it creeps op on the top. Interesting lacing left on the glass after all settles too, rigid on the side of the glass. Smell is almost non existent, but after swirling it a bit there is a touch of alcohol. Not the huge hop nose I was expecting. Taste is extraordinary. Very thick, and when it gets on your lips it wipes away like molasses. Amazing, not a hint of alcohol. You can taste the malt that was added to make the higher ABV. Almost scarily smooth, one could keep drinking this and be in trouble real quick!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Erdinger2003,4.75,"I realized later that I didn't rate this beer according to style, just as a beer.  Head is thick and pillowy with a sticky lacing. The color is gold to slight red and clear making it very inviting.  The smell is very aromatic and sweet, almost like a barleywine or Belgian, but also hoppy like an IPA. The smell is a fight between amarillo hops and burnt sugar.  The taste is very spicy and hoppy with burnt sugar flavor as well. It also has dark fruit tones with a caramel behind it.  The mouthfeel is creamy and soft.  Overall it's a wonderful new flavor that makes me want more.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,orbitalr0x,3.81,"Finally getting down to crack open my first bottle of 120 Minute. A fresh one at that, bottled on 3/29/06. Pours from the 12oz bottle into my tulip glass a nice deep amber orange/peach hue with a suprisingly thick inch of creamy white head that leaves sticky rings of lacing. An impressive head for a beer of this abv. Aromas begin with sugary sweet malts, maple syrup, fruits and maybe even some cotton candy. The piney, citric, resinous dank hops are there but not as explosive as I expected..they do have a nice depth though when you get a good inhalation. Alcohol is apparent as well...this is quite a beast.  First sip brings a wall of syrupy, sticky sweet maltiness. Notes of honey and fruitiness work in along with plenty of piney, slightly citrusy resinous hop flavors. Bitterness attempts to break free from the sweetness but doesn't get very far. This goes down with a slight alcohol burn that lingers in the throat. Slighty peachy and tropical as well with a lingering hopiness and hop burps that seem to be more intense than actually drinking the brew. I must say I was expecting more in the hop flavor department from this one. Overall, one big, intense brew that demands respect!  Mouthfeel is quite big and slick...this is a sipper no doubt about it. An interesting brew but I think I'd rather stick to the 90 Minute myself as the sweetness gets to be a bit too much for me. I gotta them props for hiding the alcohol here though as it's not overly noticeable. Definetly a brew that everyone should try at least once as it shows how far things can be pushed! I have a few other bottles aging and it will be interesting to see how time affects this one. Thanks to FoolCircle for this particular bottle.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,maristfan,3.68,"Well, I had heard about this beer, it was almost a fable...""21% alcohol and it is still a beer?!""...but had never actually ""seen"" it anywhere. Many places carry the 60 minute or 90 minute ales but it took a trip to Portland, ME to actually find a single bottle of 120. And trust me, I have been to a lot of incredibly savvy, beer filled distributors in the past. So was it everything that people had talked about and more?..eh, not exactly. Maybe I had hyped it up too much in my mind as being one of these holy grail type beers, high ABV and extreme drinkability, but it took almost 2 hours to sip through the heavy, almost syrupy liquid. No doubt on the ABV, this stuff packs a punch, but I could only find one person at a party of 35 who enjoyed it.(side note: it was a little tiny girl who said it was better than the summer ales she was drinking, go figure!) The reason was probably the strange sweetness that accompanied the brew. It was a very strong flavor that I'm sure is added to make consuming a high-test alcohol and hop beer more drinkable...but as I am a fan of the pure hop taste it kind of ruined the fun for me. Would I drink it again? Probably not, as one BA said before it could have been better for a late night in the dead of winter instead of at a 4th of July BBQ like I tried. It was 6.99 for the single bottle, a bit pricey but in the limited quantity not outrageous. Still, in the spirit of try everything once I would recommend it to all BA's and hops lovers alike.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Phatz,4.4,"I am a bit conflicted on this beer. I really do like it but maybe it is just all the build up and the year of anticipation; but it was not quite everything I was hoping it would be. Maybe I was just expecting the wrong things... I did taste this side by side with the Golden Shower (a little experiment comparing DFH sugar levels in the various beers). So maybe I will try it again not next to and Impy Pils. Still, on its own merit this is the largest ABV beer I have ever had (WWS is 18%) and I did love the fact that it drank like a smooth light rum. MMM Jamaican Rum. =)  Appearance: Pours a dark gold cloudy orange color with a fluffy white head.  Smell: SUGAR sweet grain, alcohol, RUM and port fill the nose with a whirlwind of aromas, and triggers of liquor. There is a hint of some fruit but I was really digging to find the *big* hop I expected. The nose seemed to reveal more of a pale malt and breadiness.  Taste: The flavor is *big*. The first thing that came to my mind as the 21% alcohol hit my lips is aged rum. I had a bottle of 15 year rum from Haiti (thanks froggyfrog) and this brought back memories. Now I know it is not the same but that is how mental triggers work. Delving further into the flavor I found suggestions of vanilla, fusel alcohol, earthy citrus floral hop character, more sweet malts and dark fruits on top of raw sugar. All this but swirled into a nicely balanced very warming body of alcohol.  Mouthfeel: Much more thick and almost chewy than I would have expected but still quite slick and smooth.  Drinkability: This is definitely a sipping beer. I had it next to a hot grill on a hot day and I wont do that again. It is one to treasure on a cool evening in the fall, after you have put on your slippers for the evening pour it into a snifter and sip.  Hope this is helpful.

10099,9086,jettjon,4.1,"Highs: Complexity, flavor, feel Lows: Price  Wow! 9.99 a bottle was it worth it?  Pours a dark orange/apricot translucent color with a small amount of suspended yeast. 1-finger head of small creamy bubbles that fades rapidly to a never-ending sheet and very good lacing. Nose is predictably the DFH IPA signature hops along with an sweet orange scent. Taste is heavy on the hops up front, fading to an extremely sweet citrus fruity flavor, a definite but not bad alcohol presence, a nice hopsy bitter finish then a long, slow alcohol burn at the end. The alcohol (reportedly 21%) is there, but is beautifully integrated into the beer, appearing as an footnote, not a feature. Definitely a complex and sophisticated dessert beverage. Mouth is semi-creamy and substantial, perfect for this style. Drinkability is rather iffyis it good? Yes. It is extremely expensive, insanely sweet and complex, and crazy go nuts high in alcohol? Yes. So youre not going to drink more than 6-12 oz here. I drank six and it felt like 20. Very filling.  Overall: So was it worth it? Maybe. As the latest must-have beer, I guess it was. Is there better out there for less? Surely. In all, Id say that 120 Minute IPA is a damn good dessert beer to be enjoyed in moderation.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,hammer09,3.71,"Being a hophead and having previously tried Dogfish Head's 60 Minute IPA, which I liked, and their 90 Minute IPA, which I loved, I couldn't wait to drink this beer. While I enjoyed this beer over the one and a half to two hours it took me to drink it, I was a little surprised by some of its characteristics.  The 120 Minute IPA poured a clear caramel/amber with very minimal head, approximately 1/8 of an inch. Carbonation appeared to be moderate with fine bubbles rising in the glass.  Smell was sweet with some citrus. Other aromas included a faint grassy note and slight spiciness. Being a 120 Minute IPA, I expected to be knocked over by the hop aromas wafting from this beer, however, I was surprised by its severe lack of hop character. Both the 60 and 90 minute varieties have increasing hopiness, but this beer differs from that. I suspect that the 120 Minute IPA's very high abv tends to drastically subdue any bittering bouquet from the hops.  This beer has a very malty and sweet taste that arrives with a burst of spicy flavor and a hint of vanilla. I could taste the alcohol, but found that it wasn't overpowering. Also surprising was the lack of bitterness compared to the 60 and 90 minute varieties. Again, I suspect that abv was a factor which subdued this characteristic.  Mouthfeel was slightly numbing, but with a rich character and good carbonation. Definite warming in the back of the throat.  Drinkability. Good, but one is enough. This is a fine sipping beer for sitting back, putting your feet up, and relaxing. At 21% abv, the 120 Minute IPA is an extremely strong beer and should be consumed in moderation.  Overall, another fine brew from Dogfish Head. The only drawback is the lack of hop character for this American Double IPA and it's high price for a single bottle. However, I will be purchasing the occasional bottle for those times when I want sit back and take it easy.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,maniac,3.82,"A light brown ale, with a thick white head. A very hoppy aroma with this beer. The sweetness of the high alcohol content overwhelms the hoppiness of this beer.

10099,9086,ElGordo,3.63,"Poured from 12oz capped bottle into my LaChouffe tulip glass. Bottle lists alcohol as 18% ABV. Pours a color somewhere between orange and auburn, topped by a creamy white head that slowly recedes from about 1 inch to a thin film over the course of a couple of minutes. Heavy aroma of sweet, fruity hops, some fairly mellow sweet malt, and a ton of alcohol that overwhelms any subtleties that may be present. I think the mouthfeel actually takes precedence over the palate here in a lot of ways. Rich and syrupy, it develops a highly-carbonated creaminess towards the finish, leaving a texture somehwere between a barleywine and a cream stout. The palate is very complex - full of sweet, fruity hops up front, some sweet caramel malt emerges mid-palate, with a huge, sharp alcoholic finish. Notes of sweet fruit (plums, apricots), pine, and maybe almond peek through at various points. Given the absurdly high alcohol content and the thick texture, I'd say this is fairly drinkable.

Appearance- Rich clear coppery gold, Creamy head that clings like glue to the glass and your tongue.  Smell- Sticky hops, sweetness times 10, some citrus, floral, candy, and malt richness.  Taste- The sweetness dominates all. The hops overwhelm most everything else. This is like drinking a Sauterne wine. Fruity hops roll over the tongue, candy, cherries, caramel, slightly burned sugar. The alcohol burns slightly and warms the brew no matter how cold you serve it.  Mouthfeel- Like thin glue or motor oil. Thick and cakey, oily and slick.  Drinkability- I love it, but then I love extreme beers. I could easily drink 2 but will cellar the other 2 I have for at least 6 months.

10099,9086,jokelahoma,4.19,"Poured a cloudy burnished brass color, with little head, yet a small skiff of foam which lasts and lasts.  The aroma is malt. Sweet malt. Yes, this is an IPA, so there are some fruity hops in the nose, but the malt truly dominates. How could it not, really? Sure, 120 IBUs is high, but 45 degrees plato (20% abv) is higher still. The beer has an aroma of grape juice, plums, raisins... almost a Hawaiian Punch smell. Quite attractive, really.  The taste is as sweet as the smell. Again, don't let the 120 IBUs throw you. This is getting into fortified wine territory, but made from barley instead of wimpy little grapes for the foo-foo, hold out your pinky, spit it out when tasting crowd. It isn't cloying, but is damned close. It tastes quite a bit like a port... perhaps a white port. Very, very fruity, full of grape, plum, and other dark fruit flavors. Very good.  The mouthfeel is, as one would expect, decidedly on the heavy side. This is oily, thick, chewy... and appropriate. You'll know you're drinking something, to be sure.  This brew is actually drinkable, in small quantities. I'm not sure I could do even a 12 ounce bottle by myself. The alcohol cacn become overwhelming if drank too quickly, the sweetness goes past cloying if you try to guzzle, but sit back, take it in a sip at a time, and this works wonders.

I'd like to enjoy it now.  In the oversize wine glass, it's a light orange. It's hazy with a well laced white head.  Oh my goodness, a pungent citrus. It's sweet but slightly medicinal. I've never experienced anything quite like it.  The flavor profile begins rather sweet. It suddenly becomes very bitter which is accompanied by an intense alcohol burn. As fast as that arrives, it gives way to a honey/citrus sweetness once again. As I continue, that bitter shock goes away, and what once was very sweet, suddenly takes on a tart cherry-like note. It's surprising. It tingles on the tounge.  To say the least, this is not a subtle beer. I wouldn't go haphazardly passing this out to friends. One has to make sure they are prepared for a beer like this. The hops do beckon me to want more. At this point I usually check the ABV....wow, this will kick my ass.

Sweet honey/sugary flavor in the forefront, slight citrus/pine dryness in the backtaste. This beer has a thick, almost syrupy mouthfeel. Very drinkable, especially for being 21%. The alcohol is presented well for such a strong brew. I really liked this beer; however, I have not had any other IPA that presented itself like this.

Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer is very sweet and sticky. Man this beer is over the top. The beer is full bodied. The beer avoids being sickly sweet due to spicy alcohol and maybe a bit of hops. Honestly the hops really didnt play a big part in the beer. The beer is pretty drinkable inspite of its massive alcohol content.

Powerful sweet and estery qualities, but absolutely no acidity to it at all. It's so strong, in fact, that I can barely tell if I'm tasting overt hops or none at all. Very syrupy/creamy/sticky mouthfeel.  As far as drinkability goes... it's not fair to rate this beer on drinkability, being that it's freakin 21%.

Citrus and pine laden hop tone with a crazy sweet malt backing. Alcohol is well hidden on the palate but once it hits the old gut zang!

The beer almost feels like resin - sticky, piney, but not in a bad way - and bursts with a wide range of flavors - the mangoes, pineapples, and lemons mentioned above, along with a biscuity element, a chewy candy sweetness, and of course, the warm tingle of the alcohol. Surprisingly, the 21% doesn't send my tastebuds running, though the combination of that and the massive hops profile obliterates all other tastes in my mouth (at the time, this included garlic, bleu cheese, and a heavily spiced steak).

Dogfish Head's 120 IPA is an Imperial India Pale Ale boiled for 2 hours while being continuously hopped with high alpha American hops, then dry-hopped daily in the fermenter for a month and aged for another month.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,RJLarse,2.75,"I picked up a bottle of DFH 120 Minute IPA at a specialty shop to taste, review and enjoy. I poured this beer into a fute.  Pours a rich gold color and is slightly hazy. A sticky foamy one-finger white head forms and is quite resilient. The head is the consistency of whipped cream, and produces heavy lacing on the sides of the glass.  The smell is fairly strong and typical of an IPA. It is a sweet and fruity smelling beer. There is a strong hop aroma, and evergreen or pine scent as well. The alcohol smell is hidden well by the other aromas.  The taste is also all about hops, and a bit one-dimensional really. The alcohol lends sweetness to the citrus flavor, making for a sweet grapefruit taste. Its overly sweet and hoppy.  Mouth feel is quite thick and syrupy. This is a good sipping beer, with the consistency of a liqueur. Sip only and sip slowly.  This is not a particularly drinkable beer. Its extreme flavor, heavy mouth feel and high alcohol content make it more of an experience than a drink. Its price is as extreme as its flavor. I dont think Ill have 120 Minute IPA again, but I am glad I had it once.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,TheBungyo,3.88,"Poured an absolute gorgeous color of orange with a wonderful creamy looking half inch of head. Carbonation races to the top of the glass furiously. I really like the way this looks. Nice lacing too. The nose consists of syrupy malt and syrupy hops. Taste feels as if it's yet to be fleshed out. I bet some time under the belt would do wonders here. I get a hint of pine, sweet malt, and actually pretty well disguised alcohol considering the ABV. Not very complex yet, but I would surmise that's what the cellar is for with this beer. What I would give to try a 5 year old version of this. Mouth is rich and creamy. Drinkability suffers due to the immature taste. If it were ripe though, I can only guess that it would be off the chart. Thank you Dogfish Head for being adventurous in your brewing. Please continue to tread new grounds.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,nouseforotacon,3.94,"This one gushed out a lovely, transparent amber bottom full of carbonation, with thin white lace on top forming a very small head.  Sweet, fruity nose, with phenols and alcohol. Also, strong on grapefruit.  Heavy carbonation with strong hop bitterness and a warming alcohol presence. Cloying fruitiness, ginger and spice, and a dominant phenol character in the taste. Biting tartness with a medium body, but surprisingly not too heavy or overwhelming.  Beware of this one, alcohol is VERY well masked. Not a bad showing from DFH at all.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Brian700,4.2,"This beer poured a cloudy orange with a head like whipped egg-whites. Interesting looking beer.  The aroma of this one was sweet and there was some good pineapple aroma. There was some hop presence but not like you would expect.  The flavor is very nice. Not as hoppy as I thought it would be because the sweetness kind of balances it all out. There is some pineapple like flavor as well, a lot of residual sweetness here but it is tasty. There is some warming from the 22 ABV%. Great tasting beer.  The mouthfeel is full bodied with medium carbonation. Coats the mouth nicely.  This is a pretty drinkable beer for how strong it is. For the most part, the alcohol is pretty well hidden. It's obviously there but it doesn't hit you like you think 22% would.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Incredible blast of flavors right off the bat. Malty sweetness balanced by big hop bitterness. great beer WAY expensive. would love to have some several years after cellaring, i think the flavors would blend and improve even more.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Zorro,3.9,"12 Oz bottle sampled through the efforts of dirtylou and The No BS BIF.  First I write out my will before approaching this hop bomb.  A pour in to my Duvel Tulip gives me a new motor oil thick and colored brew. A near clear apricot colored beer with a little bit of head, which is impressive as at 21% ABV this should be able to dissolve any head.  Smell is quite sweet and surprisingly fruity to the nose more like a barley wine than a mega IPA. Lots of aroma of melons and some pine and grapefruit. This has what I would call the Dogfish Signature aroma all over it, that melon smell that DFH seems to put in all its bigger beers. Bit of spicy black pepper is noticeable mostly from all the ethanol in this beer.  Taste is very sweet with a large hit of melons, fruit and raw sugar cane in the first taste. Very sweet beer with tons of melon and fruit flavors, this just isn't one of the better Mega IPAs like Pliny The Younger or FFF Dreadnaught.  Mouthfeel is syrup.  Not a super drinkable brew here. Super sweet and thick with a high alcohol content this is decidedly inferior to the best from Three Floyds or Russian River.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Gagnonsux,3.43,"Review from 3/14/15 (ratings changed to reflect this review) - On-tap at Yard House. Still a little too much alcohol and too thick for me, but I appreciate this more that I used to. An interesting beer for sure, but still not something I think I'll ever be craving.   Original review from 5/12/06  Look - 4.0 Smell - 2.5 Taste - 2.5 Fell - 2.5 Overall - 2.0 Avg - 2.49  Sampled from a fresh bottle dated 3/3/06. Color is a bright copper with lots of big, slow moving bubbles for carbonation. Head is tall, thick, and off-white. Retention is high for a beer with this much ABV. Not much here in for smell. Traces of citrissy hops, alcohol, and a fruity malt are noted. Taste is of a very sweet, make that an almost sickly sweet malt, with a slight edge of fruitiness. Strong alcohol flavor is in the mix. Some citrissy hop flavor fades into the background. I was actually expecting this to be a very, very hoppy beer. This reminds me more of a supped up euro strong lager, like something from Russia. There's just too much sweetness and alcohol here for my tastes. I'm gonna set my other bottle aside for a long, long time and see what happens.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,copasetic,3.92,"Holy hell! Is this a beer?  In the glass, it's a deep cloudy orange with no head. Little bubbles float to the surface. The aroma is sort of hoppy, but also fruity and sweet -almost Belgian-like. Oh, and alcohol. Big hits of alcohol waft off the surface of this monster and overpower everything. Taste and mouthfeel converge, as the thick syrupy body and alcoholic zing carry in a huge maltiness and potent hits of hop bitterness and flavor. With other hoppy beers, I can usually detect differences in hop flavors and aromas, but not here. I just know there are hops entering my body aggressively and I can't see past that. All of this is overlaid on a base of sweet malt. Seems like the yeast, if they could have taken this beer up to 30% ABV, would have had plenty of sugars to work with.  Overall, this is a very complicated and very strong beverage. Unlike anything I've ever had (a title that formerly belonged to Dogfish's Fort). If you haven't, try it. You won't regret spending the $9 for a bottle. Will I buy another bottle? Maybe. Not anytime soon; this is not one that I'll add to my standard lineup, but a worthwhile adventure.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,kaimcm,3.94,"bottle from a 2003 batch, reviewed in May of 2006.  A: deep golden, turning to medium brown body. little to no head, though its more carbonation than I expected for the age of this bottle. doesnt look likemuch but I didnt buy it to look at it.  S: loads of sugar, and sweet candied fruit, raisons, some more tropical as well. no hops whatsoever. a little booze and a bit of toffee. plenty of carmelization.  T/M: nice viscosity, thick but coating and pretty drinkable considering. lots o' malt and sugar. very sweet. the hops have completely faded from this brew leaving this big thick and sweet body thats out of balance. plenty of juicy tropical fruits, even some candy qualities, a little cloying. hints of rum.  D: what can one say? a 21% DIPA? come one. this beer exists in its own world where mere mortal language and concepts arent sufficient. who knows? just drink one and you know what can never be said.  while my score for this isnt very high I enjoyed this brew and was impressed at how well it held up. the label says you can age it for a decade or so but i suspect you'd have really expensive paint thinner by then and not much else. get this sucker fresh, despite the alcohol content, dont make the mistake of cellaring this thing.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,BEERchitect,4.42,"Man...that's a serious kick in the teeth! Even puts the most seasoned beer drinker back on their heels. The beer just plops into the glass, then laces and legs and carbonates around boastfully. Releases aromas of bigtime hops and malts with every descriptor word that has ever been used on this website. Flavors to the same, and more. Use every 'hop' adjective you know, use every 'malt' adjective you know. That's what this beer is. Use every 'mouthfeel' word you can think of. That's it too. The beer is more that an IPA; it's an IPAwine. Must be sipped like a cognac. The hops never subside under the imense malts and alcohol. Could easily be put in the 'Strong Ale, or Old Ale' catagories. Easily competes with Utopias for most powerful beer. A 100% joy and honor to drink.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,fredferrell,4.45,"All I can say is this beer will knock your socks off. There are two ways it can do this. Either by the hops aroma or the alcohol after taste.  I just picked up 3 cases of this in Richmond, VA and could not wait to get home to try it. When poured, it fills up the pint glass to the top with about an inch of head. It has a dark orange color to it. The scent is great, but may be over the top for some. If you don't like IPAs, don't waste your time or money, and at $9 a bottle it would be money well saved. You can smell the hops right away and there is some smell of alcohol. When tasted there is a flavor of great hops and some malt. I think it is a good balance since I like that type of beer. There is also a good bitterness to it. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,johnniemarg,4.25,"12oz bottle poured into a tulip. Cloudy, dark golden color with a persistent 1 finger of head. Small bubbles move very slowly to the top after the pour, hinting at the thickness of this. Sheets of lacing cover the glass.  The smell is very very sweet. Bubble gum and spice.  This tastes very good, but not like any kind of ""ipa"" at all. It tastes like the best quad I've ever had. The sweetness tastes like candy sugar. Despite all the hops, they are hard to distinguish. I guess most quads I usually feel are unbalanced towards the candy sugar and alcohol, so the tons of hops in this I guess balance them out perfectly for me. The taste is very good and smooth and the alcohol at over 20% is not overbearing. The hops I think are little more than a spicy aftertaste on my tongue.  The alcohol in this beer actually numbs my tongue a bit. This has the consistency of engine oil and immediately begins to warm and numb my mouth with an alcohol spice.  I will give this a ""4"" on drinkability because it's amazing they have balanced this out so well at over 20% alcohol. It's an easy drinking beer, all things considered. More than one of these would be out of the question generally, but this one is mighty tasty and enjoyable. Fantastic balance for such a high abv extreme beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,rhoadsrage,3.38,"(Served in a snifter)  A- This beer pours a warm hazy dark orange body with a thick creamy mousse of a head. The head clings to the side of the glass and has a orange hue to it. After a bit there are some large bubbles starting to form in the head.  S- The smell of green piney hops comes through but not as strong as I was expecting. In the background there is some lightly caramel malt aromas. There is a nose of alcohol when this beer warms a bit.  T- The taste of caramel hops is quickly overpowered by a strong alcohol finish. The sweetness of the malt hangs on my lips and I didn't seem to notice the hops. Is this the right beer? With the next sip the alcohol note is blended with bitter hops as it burns my nose on the exhale. As the beer warms the hops start to come through but the alcohol becomes even more pronounced.  M- This beer has a medium mouthfeel with a strong alcohol heat in the finish.  D- I was expecting the hoppiest beer of my life but that was far from the case. I got loads of alcohol heat and some nice caramel malt note in the back but not the hops. This beer was fresh and I was hoping to get the most of the hops but no such luck. The bottle says the beer ages well but there is no ""brewed on date"" for reference. I love Dogfish Head but this beer is a bit of a letdown.

10099,9086,objectivemonkey,4.41,"Here we go, the mother of IPAs, the mecca of hop-dom.  Pours a hazy golden orange, a slightly aggressive pour yielding a whopping two inch head, white, frothy, and cloudy, mounds of lacing sticking to the sides. After 2/3 of the bottle poured, waited for the head to settle, poured the rest in, and appeared almost smoke like streaks, clouds in the haze, must be the yeast, fascinating. Although it kind of freaks me out, this is way better/cooler than the Guiness avalanche. Quite frankly, one of the loviest (and most fascinating) brews I've yet seen.  A potent hop nose at first, then goes away, the alcohol not hiding but not oppressive, floral and has a sugar-like malty base beneath other elements.  Taste is much sweeter than I expected, and not nearly as hoppy, but you definitely need to take it slow, as the alcohol makes its presense known in the middle through the end, warming nicely, somewhat oppressive, though I'll use the term 'stern'. Mouth screws up from inital sweetness, kind of letting you off guard when the alcohol bite strikes like a cobra, puckering, and this is where the hop bittering makes its debut, and while basically overshadowed by the abv, combines with the sweet fruits and malts and sugars yielding an almost zen-like state of beer nirvana. And while I've seen others describe the taste as 'grapefruit-like', I'll say its more sweetly caramel-like syrup, coinciding with the thick mouth and the high abv to just linger there, giving you much to think about. Appropriately, the after taste, sweet and warming, stays with you for quite some time before receding.  This reminds me of when I first tried Samichlaus, another super-high abv beer, and this seems to IPAs what Samichlaus is to doppelbocks. It is wierd, as I know this is in the IPA style, I can feel it, but it has just been loaded with so much, almost to the point of overpowering, that it takes on a whole different character, a breed unto itself. One of a kind.  Take your time, sip away, respect and enjoy slowly. That is the nature of this beer, and while one person might say its hopped to high hell and abv is out of control, I say its a beautifully crafted. At $8, and basically needing to spend a half hour focusing solely on enjoying it, I can't imagine having more than one a year, or one every half year. But, I'll be headed back to the store to pick up a few to stash the cellar.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Dithyramb,3.9,"Golden orange with a head that stuck around longer than expected. Nose full of the gamut of hop offerings.  This should be more complex, but feel that the alcohol and sweetness really detract. Yes it is hoppy, but your mouth will warm and sticky up so fast you won't notice at times. Boozy nice sipper.  This is a young bottle, and I grabbed several, we'll see how it lives up in the basement. Good overall, but so far can't go wrong with 60/90 minute versions.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,GClarkage,3.79,"04/22/06- Purchased via mail order..can't remember who with though.  Presentation- 12oz bottle. Bottled in year 2004. Has sat in my fridge for almost two years. Poured into my St. Feuillien goblet style glass.  Appearance- Glowing golden orange in color. 1/2 inch head at first...very sparkling white. Light rim of foam left behind while leaving medium spotty and streaky lace. A very nice sight indeed.  Smell- Really doesn't smell like much. Medium fusel alcoholic fumes with a light malty base and some muted sugary fruits. None of these smells really stand out though.  Taste- At first taste it doesn't seem like it's a 20% beer. After the first few sips you can feel it though. It's deceiving for sure. Malt actually comes out to play nicely. Good base leading to some sugary grapefruit and floral hops. Not to bitter though. Alcohol flavor is pretty strong and stays around into the aftertaste.  Mouthfeel- A bit higher carbonation than thought. Nice light bitter sugary coating on the tongue. Warming to be sure. Nice beer by the fire beer.  Drinkability- Umm, session beer...no. Maybe a once a month beer is you can stand to pay the $10 a pop. Not the hop bomb people expect, but a very nice sipping liquor-like beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,dustified1234567,3.62,Appearance-Golden amber with two fingers of off white head. Very inviting by the appearance.  Smell- Is sweet and fruity more of a pineapple smell. Very inviting.  Taste-Very sweet almost two sweet. Makes your mouth water and does not actually taste like pineapple but at this point more of just a mixed fruit.  Mouthfeel- Good carbonation not too smooth but a littlle on the heavy side. Leaves your mouth with a dry feeling.  Drinkability- Too sweet and wouln't try antoher i don't think but recommend trying at least once.

Aroma from the hops was not as prominent as I thought it would be. Oaky alcohol on the nose woth fruit. I was expecting an absolute hop bomb but it wasn't. Great citrus tones with a little grassiness to it. The maltiness balanced this beer so well. Very thick mouthfeel. Definately looking forward to the other bottle.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,acehart1,3.6,"This stuff really hit me. It is definitely more drinkable than the extra and a little stronger than the WWS. Drank a little cooler than room temp (probably around 55 degrees, not sure if this is the proper serving temp or not...I figured this was around correct since the Burton was best at that temp). The appearance of the 120 was pleasing, very orangey (with a hint of red). Pour was smooth and produced a very sutble lace. It has a very sweet, citrus-like bouquet, but the faint hint of alcohol is definitely there. This stuff is strong and not for the faint of heart. The 90 is definitely more drinkable and the 60 is the optimal beer for first-time Dogfish Head drinkers, but the 120 is pretty solid all around. Props to the brewers. The mouthfeel is very oily and the drinkability is very low on this one. Definitely a sipper.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,nflmvp,3.78,"Poured VERY aggressively into a large snifter and all I got was a one finger head of dense, off white foam that had lots of large wispy bubbles in it.  Smell is tougher for me to pin down though the alcohol is right up front. This seems somewhat bready and piney.  Taste is very sweet a little citrusy. The finish is all alcohol but even that seems ok. It is certainly only a sipping beer anyway.  Mouthfeel is thick but only a little syrupy. I'd say that's an accomplishment all it's own, considering the ABV of 21%.  Drinkability is a little less than I'd like to see. I thought WWS and Raison D'Extra were both VERY drinkable at 18% and 20% respectively so I was expecting more out of this one.

Nose is a very strong citrusy hops, some floral notes, a sweet alcoholic undertone. Taste is a mix of burning alcohol and strong resinous citric and grapefruit hops. It's a little much, not nearly as enjoyable to drink as the 90. Full bodied with a slick oily mouthfeel, this one is definitely a sipper. This isn't nearly as drinkable as the WWS--I'm glad I tried this but don't think I will again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

A pretty red/orange color with a medium head that quickly dissipated. All I could smell was sweet fruit and alcohol. The taste followed the odor: sweet,sweet fruit, alcohol, with a hops coming in later. A very thick, rich mouthfeel. I started with it chilled, let it sit, and finished it at room temperature. Definitely better at room temperature. I'd look at this as a dessert beer, and would figure that 6-12 ounces would be my limit.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

This had a great concentrated orange color, with a thick head which thinned quickly. Again, probably more my glass than the beer.  I smelled all of the hoppiness I would have expected in what I think is a DIPA: citrus and pine, and an overally spiciness that bordered on red pepper (cayenne-ish), balanced by a hint of malt in the background.  The taste was exactly the opposite of what I expected. It was hugely sweet; sugar, sweet fruit with a tang (think pineapple). A massive concentrated sweetness of lighter sugars (not deep fruit like a British Brown Ale), with some hop presence on a spicier note, like pepper. It finished with a big alcohol warmth, but less ""fumey"" than I would expect.  On the mouthfeel, again, it was a big alcohol warmth after the mouth-caoting sweetness. I'd classify it as medium bodied; just a hint of thickness from the sweetness of the beer.  Overall, I'd drink it again.

Served from a twelve ounce bottle into a snifter at cellar temperature .Poured a golden orange with very little head, but didn't pour too vigorously. The aroma was of hops , citrus fruits, and tons of alcohol. First taste was totally alcohol. The next was a little easier with a taste of hops, followed by more alcohol that left a little burn at the back of my throat. There is no hiding this alcohol. Had a nice full almost thick mouth feel.

A - Pours a slightly hazed bright orange-caramel color. An off-white head rises to about 1/2 inch at best (with a vigorous pour) and quickly dissapates as expected. Remaining bubbles are soapy and big, sticking together in a big clump. Lacing is sporadic, but noticeable.  S - Juicy sweet, nectar dripping fruitiness. Pineapples, peaches, apricots and pears. Kiwi fruits even. In lesser amounts, there is also a tinge of pine. Orange blossom honey.  T - Big big sweetness up front, but ambiguously sugary and without much discernible malt presence. In the middle, the alcohol makes a big isopropyl-style entrance. At the back of the throat, the fragrant west-coast hops become very prevalent, although not as punchy as the smell would have you believe it should be. As you swallow, you notice that your mouth becomes sucked dry of any lingering moisture and the alcohol leaves a slight burning in the back of the throat. Big, warm afterglow.  M - Very thick and syrupy with a hint of carbonation. The swallow is slick, but the alcohol keeps it from being smooth.  D - The main thing I kept thinking as I was writing this review is that the alcohol is unnecessarily strong. I feel that it knocks everything else out of balance.

10099,9086,danielharper,4.17,"Received in trade with fdrich29. (Thanks Frank!) Bottled in 2004.  A: Poured into a snifter, forms a dark orange color with no head whatsoever. I know high-alcohol beers tend to have little head, but for my money an IPA should give me a nice foamy one for appearance -- a slight dock on appearance for that.  S: Very strong, clean and crisp hop presence on top, with a nice citrusy grapefruit and even an orange presence underneath. Yeah, it's really, really, hoppy, but the hops are wonderful here and the fruit, while not as extreme as in an Arrogant Bastard, is very nicely presented.  T: Heavy hops flavor (duh), crisp and intensely bitter with fresh hops, with strong orange flavor. As the beer warms, the 21% alcohol becomes more prominent, but this only adds to the complexity of this wonderful brew.  M: Excelptional. Heavily-carbonated and very hoppy, it's an assault on the palate that is very, very, good -- after finishing the beer I couldn't taste a thing. I've tried Stone Ruination, and this is even more intense than that -- really amazing mouthfeel.  D: My notes simply say ""dangerously drinkable"" and it's true. I had a 12oz bottle of this -- if I'd had a bomber, I'd have drunk that and enjoyed every drop. The alcohol is hidden here very well by the overall flavor of the beer, and I rejoiced at every sip.  I used to not like hops. Still don't, when the beer itself doesn't match its hop presence. But here, as in other really fantastically hoppy beers like Rogue I2PA and Arrogant Bastard, the hop presence is nicely balanced within a really great fruit profile, and the overall experience is amazingly textured and good. I guess I'm just a reluctant hophead, but I guess anyone who loves this beer as much as I can't be considered anything but a fan of the hop-bombs. I'll buy this instantly the next time I see it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Left nice lacing as the head settle very quickly into a thin white covering. I was disappointed with the smell of this beer. I was expecting a great hop smell, but the sweet smell over powered the hop smell. It smelled of candied sugar with a hint of hops and alcohol following. The beer (like the 90 Minute) first hit me with a overly sweet taste, and followed with a decent hop presence. Alcohol warming definitely is a flavor in the profile, but not as dramatic as I expected in such a high abv beer. I don't think this beer tasted like a DIPA, but more like a really sweet barleywine. The mouthfeel was medium to thick and really coated the tongue. The drinkability was good for such a high abv beer, but sweetness really detracted from the overall experience.

Hops and alcohol mix together in a slightly burning manner. Interesting, boozy (but not overly). Soft, sweet doppelbock-ish malt sweetness. Sugary, candy malts come through. Fruity (estery) alcohol floods the palate. Tropicalia pineapple, mango, pears. Brandy. Singed hop flavor and futile bitterness come in later. Warming, sweet and sticky finish (long).

The last beer of our february MCD meeting. we saved it until the end because we didn't want to be totally smashed while we were tasting everything else. Poured reddish brown with a small white head. looks fine. Mild hop smell. smells sweet, too, like cane sugar. Taste is sweet, alcohol tasting. syrupy sweet hop flavor. thick consistency, like a hoppy brandy.

10099,9086,SkeeterHawk,4.07,"I don't know why I am doing this to myself, but here is sit in front of my second bottle of DFH120. I tried it before and didn't like it...which is no wonder because I am not a hop head. I like their 90 min IPA, but I remember this one being WAY over the top. I have had this particular bottle about a year in my fridge, so hopefully the real greenness has subsided a little bit.  Gulp! Here goes...  Appearance: Pours a pretty cloudy orangish brown color with a small 1/8 head at first pour that fell within a few seconds. There are a few bubbles rising slowly through the thick liquid, but these don't maintain the head. There is some thin lacing left on the glass after drinking.  Aroma: All I really get in the nose is a bunch of citrusy hops. There is a bit of a toasty/caramel-like sweetness in here, but the hops rule the day. As the beer warms a bit, you can pick out specifically oranges and grapefruits.  Taste: Wow, now there is a LOT going on in this beer. Granted, it is mostly hops, but there is certainly some serious alcohol in there to give them a run for their money. There is a bit of sweetness that you can pick up in the beginning of the sample, but this doesnt last long. I believe that it is the alcohol that blows it away first before the hops step in and completely annihilate your palate. This one will clear your sinuses! You get about two sips where you can discern one flavor from the next, but after that the alcohol has pretty much numbed your senses. This beer goes down more like a Hop Schnapps than a beer. The middle of the flavor profile is muddled from all of the sensations, and leads straight into the finish. The finale is a syrupy hoppy goo that coats the throat and leaves some serious warming in its wake...a bit like I imagine eating a tablespoon of Ben Gay would be like. As it warms up some, the alcohol becomes more noticeable, but the overall flavor takes on more of an orange juice-like character.  Opinion: Well, what can I say about such an anomaly of beer? There should be a special category for these project beers so that you won't put them there with some of the more palatable products on the market. You can't knock Sam for producing this beer, and it takes talent to squeeze the yeast this hard...but this ain't no session beer! I was happier with it this sample than I was last timethis may have to do with the fact that I aged it for a year, but I think that I am just more appreciative of the stronger beers here lately as I too have made a few in the 1.200 OG range this last year.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Smells of a combo of metallic, earthy, pineapple and oaky hops with a little wheat and honey beneath, followed by a smooth and gentle alcohol.  The flavor is amazingly dynamic. Starts with a zesty sour that wraps around the edges of my tongue and the presents a green grape and honey sweetness. This is followed by a dry tingly concoction of earthy, pineapple, plumb and oaky hops. Finishes with a nice dirty sting of dryness  Mouth feel is thin but dense with a light and tingly carbonation.  I have to ask, where did the alcohol go?. DFH once again does an amazing job of burring an amazing amount of booze. Delicious!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,mmmbeer,4.05,"12 oz. bottle with no vintage year, but it's the latest bottling as far as I know. It pours a very clear orangey/amber with a thin 1/8"" off-white head that leaves some bits of lacing. Upon closer inspection it appears unfiltered and even has a few beads of carbonation. Overall, it looks much better than I expected for something of this strength, but it's nothing to rave about. It smells of gentle fruits/hops (citrus, apricot), alcohol, and lots of sweetness. The taste is very sweet as well, with a dose of caramel, perhaps some smoke, and a good amount of fruits (orange, apricot). It is pretty bitter, yes, but... 120 IBUs? It's all hidden by the intense sweetness of the malts, which is also evident in the almost syrupy mouthfeel - it's one of the thickest beers I've come across. Also one of the most warming. Each sip feels like I just drank a liqueur, but I suppose it is as strong as some cordials. Not sure if I'd classify as a double IPA, as the malts seem to take the forefront here, and at times, the 120 reminds me of a barley wine. Apparently many reviewers here feel the same way. Too over the top I'd say, though not a bad beer. I'd like to see them tone the malts down some and let the IBUs come through. Not sure if I'd buy it again, but I'd drink it again if it were offered.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

The hops are not nearly as powerful as I thought. The alcohol content is present in the aroma. This beer smells more like a Barley Wine than a Double IPA.  This beer tastes more like a Barley Wine than a Double IPA also. It is very sweet. It has a malty flavor. The hops are there, for sure, but not the main flavor I am getting. The alcohol content is very present in the flavor.  This beer is very sweet and syrupy. It has very full bodied. The alcohol warms the throat as it goes down. The beer leaves a sticky sweet aftertaste. It is not very carbonated.  I dont think this beer would make a good session beer at all. It is way to high in alcohol. Also, the flavor is quite aggressive. I am still curious by the flavor. This beer is way more like a Barley Wine than anything else.

The smell is fairly hoppy, with citrus aroma, only partially alcoholic considering the ABV on this one. The taste is very dry. The citrus flavor is stronger and tastes like tangerines. More hop flavor also. The alcohol taste is quite strong, but not enough to ruin it. It does burn the back of the throat slightly. You can certainly feel the alcohol peeking into the bloodstream. The mothfeel is slightly thin, perhaps because there's so much alcohol, carbonation is medium. This one is definitely a sipper.

The clean grassy hop aroma with some pine undertones is strong, but not overpowering. Wow, what a huge beer. I'm not even sure how to describe this. Almost a hoppy port? The sweetness stands out, mostly fruity. Raisins, plums, grapes... This is a big, sticky, chewy beer. Good God, there is no way this is 21% ABV.

It looks very creamy. The bubbles are very small and compact they leave good lacing. It smells of hops, did you expect me not to say it? It has a very floral aroma with breads, tropical fruits and just a hint of caramel underlying. Of course there is an alcohol smell to it but if you didnt see that one coming from around the corner then you need to step off of the short bus.  WOW! There is sooo much going on here. Well, firstly, it is a little syrupy and viscous. Sticky! There is really a nice balance of malt, hops and alcohol here. It has a nice sweet, fruity taste. The alcohol isnt overpowering, surprisingly. Mouthfeel is really excellent. Although it is slightly thicker than I typically prefer, it is nice. It coats the mouth and feels chewy. Good carbonation. Not too much though; I was afraid that there was going to be a ridiculous amount of carbonation in this one.  At the outset of this endeavor, I went into it with an idea of what this beer was. I thought that it was a novelty of sorts. I was wrong. It isnt overpowering and has plenty going on. I thought that I was going to be getting myself into a bottle of pancake syrup with lots of burning alcohol. Again, I was wide of the mark. I am impressed. I paid about $9 per bottle, but it was worth it. It was tasty, enjoyable and entertaining. I am anxious to cellar the other bottles. I rate the drinkability at 4.0 due to the fact that it is about 21% abv and about $9 a bottle.

Smell is of intense sugary malt with tons, and tons, and tons of hop varieties. I'm getting rich biscuit, bread, followed by massive amounts of pine, citrus, grapefruit, orange, pineapple. Taste is equal to the aromas in terms of intensity. To me, this is really the 90 minute stepped up a notch but it's a little harder to handle due to the high abv and intense flavors. Mouthfeel is full bodied, sugary, bitter, and bread-like chewy. Drinkability is good.

Clear orange color with a small, tight head of bubbles that erodes to a whispy haze after a minute or two. The aroma is hefty pale malt and a floral hop background.. can't believe it doesn't smell hoppier than this. I expected my nostrils to be permanently damaged after smelling this. Taste is...surprisingly (dare I say) malty? The 90 Minute IPA ""seemed"" hoppier, although there's no doubt in my mind that the 120 had more hops in in. The gigantic malt and alcohol helped mask the brutal hops quite a bit...but not completely. Oily mouthfeel and thick, syrupy texture. Very drinkable for a 20+% ABV monster.  This is one creation by DFH that is even a bit extreme as far as ""extreme"" beers go. A nice one to try, but the high-price tag (around $8 for me) make this a beer that is saved (or cellared) for special occasions or to try once or twice.

10099,9086,akorsak,2.19,"I am drinking a cold 12 oz poured into an Appalachian Brewing Co. tumbler.  Appearance: An auburn colored ale, this poured with a nice head and kept a residual amount of lace as the beer was consumed. It is translucent, with no sediment.  Smell: There are some light hop oils that I detect, but for the most part, I smell malts, lots and lots of malts, akin to a barleywine. For the beer advertised as the Holy Grail for Hopheads, this is more like the Messiah of Malts.  Taste: As with the smell, malts overwhelm any hop sensations throughout the sip. At the end of the sip, a bitterness of hops appears, but it is not sufficient to redeem this DIPA. On the bright side, the GIGANTIC, ENORMOUS, GINORMOUS ABV of approx 21% is not detectable.  Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel lacks any hop profile, which is disapoointing, as the 90 Minute IPA is a work of art. The malts sit nicely on the palate, but that is not typical of a DIPA.  Drinkability: The drinkability is redeemed by the masking of the ABV. One does not realize the high ABV when enjoying it, although that can easily get one in trouble.  Overall, this is an interesting creation from DFH. I enjoy the ale and recommend it.

The beer is a light amber in color.  smell: A moderate presence of light fruits and caramel from the malt. Definately picking up a considerable ethanol sharpness. The hop aroma is not as large as I had expected, but is big nonetheless...and is mostly aroma and little bitter smell. The smell is reminiscent of the hop material that I filter out of my homebrew batches while pouring into primary...somewhat tealike and a little grassy. I feel as though I am picking up some hints of scuppernong grapes and honey...this one smells pretty sweet.  mouthfeel: The carbonation is at the peak of the medium range. The body is slick and on the heavier side of the medium range. Though it feels thick, something about it makes it seem lighter than one would think.  taste: Sticky sweet caramel, white grape, and clover honey notes. Big hop flavor, but not much bitterness. Moderate alcohol presence...pretty well hidden, actually. Finish is of a red appley sweetness and a light bitterness.  drinkability: Shite, I had no idea this was a 21% beer until I got toward the end of my review...very well disguised. Highly drinkability, considering both the style and the ABV.  Split a 12 oz. bottle with dirtylou on the last night of my stay. We've been pining to try this beer since the beginning of our beer enlightenment period...this has truly been a ""momentous moment"". This one kind of threw me for a loop.

It is really a unique experience that is hard to compare to other IPAs, but I feel I must. If there were another beer of its type I would rate it differently but with such huge alchol there is a lot lost to other IPAs.  The flowery hops is there, the mild body is right on for a good IPA, but you cant get away from that 21%. It pours golden rich but the smell of the alchol pours out over the glass like a mad science experiment. The taste is nothing like you have ever experienced....IPA hops and body, but a burn like someone poured in grain alcohol.  I have had this many times, and like it regardless of what I said above, but I usually pour this in a ""vertical"" tasting for friends with the 60 and 90 minute IPAs along side.

Yeah, there's some hops, but there's also a huge alcohol burn if you hold it in your mouth for more than a millisecond and a meady honey sweetness that is truly disgusting.

Easily the strongest beer I've ever, except for Utopias. 120 is like a really strong beer, where as Utopia's, for better or for worse, deserves it's own category.

Nice peach golden orange color.  Smell is a lot of hops and alcohol as you'd expect, but balanced with a syrupy maltiness that's kind of like sweet brandy. Hops are really citrusy and sticky, with a backbone that's very piney.  Taste is dominated by fruity hops and above all else, alcohol obviously, but not in a bad way. Very much like liquor, but still pretty tasty and refreshing.  Chewy sticky mouthfeel that leaves a little bit of a film on your teeth it seems. REALLY warming alcohol, as you'd imagine.

I'm always impressed with the Dogfish Head offerings and was expecting great things from this beer. It was great, but the flavor was not what I was expecting at all. Not sure what vintage this was - 2004 or 2005.  Appearance - orange colored, light amber. Clear, bright white, compact head. Head stays around, lacing as it goes down.  Nose - I'm bracing for the hops . . . but no, malt! Toasty, sweet, caramel. Finally the hops come through, some citrus, resin. But not nearly as much as you would expect from an IPA continuously hopped for two hours. Also the alcohol is there, but dominated by sweet smells and esters.  Taste - amazingly balanced. In fact, tilted in favor of the malt. Sweet, with citrus in the background. Tastes like alcohol infused brioche with hops on top. Lots of alcohol, but not overwhelming. In fact, I wouldn't guess this was as high in alcohol content as it is in a blind taste. The more it warms, however, it almost turns into a nice, light port wine. Winey flavors abound - dark fruits, grapefruit, raisins.  Mouthfeel - light to medium-light bodied. Coats your tongue with sugar. Hop bitterness very muted on the tongue. Amazingly thin for the beer's size.  Drinkability - highly, highly enjoyable. I would love to be able to sit around and drink several of these, but it would probably kill me - both financially and from alcohol poisoning.

This becomes even more evident once you pour it into the glass. the first thing that came to my palate was hops,hops, and more hops and then take a guess what was next...the alcohol..once this beer warms it becomes a nice sipper that i might just sit back and relax with.

Appearance: A clear melted copper colored brew that was pellucid, the kind that seems to give an opposite image of your finger, like in that perfect spot in front of a magnifying glass. Head was fleeting, but bright white.  Smell: Highly alcoholic and medicinal, like those disinfected gauzes. But this wasn't that infected, band-aid kind of aroma. It sort of reminded me of Laphroag...The hops are massive, but it's different than most of the other hop monsters I've tried before, as if the hops aromas were extracted by maceration in booze, like a crème de cassis.  Taste: The malt is there, and chunky as hell. Take a heaping spoonfull of DME, put in a few drops of vodka and mix it into a rough paste, and chew it like gum. Then shove a few hop pellets in there. I wouldn't exactly call this Beer a balanced one, nor did the brewer intend it to be this way, I bet. A very present malt sweetness that stands side by side with the hops like two gigantic robots fighting for the fate of the universe in some japanese manga. Taste is like rapinis blanched in maple syrup. Even in the aftertaste, smaking your lips immediately brings back the herbal, mouth puckering hops, but the lingering malt also! It's like rock candy with the hop bud center.

Pours a deep golden/bronze color with a head that dissipates to a sticky film for the rest of the glass. How do they get any head at all from a 21% beer?  Ready for the first sniff, will it be all hops? Will it be all alcohol? Not at all, big surprise. There is some citrus in the smell and just a tinge of alchohol but mostly sweetness.  OK I think i'm ready to take a sip. All i can say is not what i was expecting at all. Very sweet, almost a little too sweet. I imagine that is has to be to get 21% but i was expecting much more of an alcohol and bitter taste. Both are there but they don't stand out the way you would expect.  The only thing i can say about mouthfeel is syrpy. The sweetness sticks to your mouth. No aftertaste at all!!! Again a big surprise.  Drinkability - if you look at this as being able to drink more than one at a time it fails misserably. My belly is already warm and my head is spinning. But if you look at it as a question of whether you would try it again and recommend it, it gets a big yes. This is a must try beer if for no other reason than to appreciate how Dogfish managed to brew a 21% beer.

Its strong and syrupy sweet to start with, and while bitter, is actually kind of balanced, which was not what I though I was getting into. The sweetness is like syrup and powdered sugar on French Toast made with lots of vanilla. The hops are not overpowering, not out of line. They are bitter and resinous, but blend well with the super-sweet malt profile and hints of alcohol, which are amazing light for a brew this strong. I was expecting, and kind of hoping, that this would be more of a super bitter hop brew, but the sweetness is so prevalent it fairly well balances the hops. Syrupy body and very light carbonation. Not bad, but not what I would call drinkable and not what I was hoping for.

Extremely impressive. It almost seems like the 60 or 90 min IPAs have a more noticeable hop character than this one.  I would love to have this more often, if it wasnt so damn expensive.

Oh yeah, sugar coated hops. Seriously, this beer hides the alcohol exceptionaly well, but covers it up with a flat out sugar taste. The hops take a back seat to the sugary stickiness. Mouthfeel is sticky and think, coating my mouth with the sweet aftertaste.  The problem is, Im not a fan of sweet beers - at least not this sweet. This beer tastes more like sugar than anything else. The hops play second fiddle here, if you can believe it. The fact that I cant even taste alcohol is amazing - the only indication that its 21% is the warmness in my belly.  Although I can see why some people would love this beer, its just not for me. I wont give it too bad of a score though, since this style isnt exactly mainstream theres not much to compare it to.  Drinkability cant possibly be very high with a beer this strong, so I cant go very high with that score.  Definately worth a try but not something I will be buying again. Well, I might buy one more bottle to cellar for a few years to see how the taste changes, but other than that, I can say Ive tried it and I will leave it at that.

10099,9086,gotbeer,2.95,"This review was from a 2005 bottle release.  The appearance was average really, with a pleasant golden, orange color and a head that went dissapated to nothing very quickly.  The smell was a little subdued from what I expected. Some citrus, and some fussel alcohols.  The taste made it obvious that this was a very big beer. Overly sweet malt flavors and huge citrus hops. The malt flavors were well balanced, but too sweet in my opinion. As the beer warmed to room temp. the fussel alcohols made themselves very well known in the taste.  The mouthfeel was viscous and chewy.  The drinkablity was low at this ABV (can you say booze bomb?). Definitely a sipper, and I took a couple of hours on mine. I definitely would not want more than one.  It's an interesting beer that you really can't compare to anything else. I'm glad I tried it, but I prefer it's little brother the 90 minute IPA. It won't be a regular in my rotation.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,phisig137,4.32,"I was actually lucky enough to try this badboy on tap at Capitol Ale House in Richmond. If you have a chance, get there.... they've only got one 5 gallon soda keg of it!  Anyways, this beer poured from the tap a little cold for my taste, but a gorgeous orange toffee color. Head was absolutely minimal, and disipated quickly.  The aroma of this beer is actually a little subdued I felt. Definite smells of caramel, toffee, and of course loads of hops. Perhaps the beer was simply too cold, but I was surprised by how mild the smell was. For something this huge I was expecting more. What I did smell was great, but a bit muted.  As far as flavor though, this beer is HUGE. as soon as you sip it, specialty grains, caramel and mucho malt coat your tongue. The finish is purely dominated in all ways by hops. But perhaps not even hops, but pure alpha acids. The finish is so incredibly hoppy and tangy that it is incredible. The difference between the time it hits your tongue, and the time you swallow is unreal. It it literally almost beyond description. Maybe that's the 21% abv talking though...  The mouthfeel is thick and syrpy without a doubt. Kinda feels like your drinking a huge glass of Nyquil. The flavore just coat your mouth and linger there forever.  I had to dock the drinkability a bit due to the alcohol. I personally love huge beers, but many may be scared by it. Having experiance with large alcohol beers, I really enjoyed this one, but others who didn't really know thought this was horrendous. I guess it really just depends on your tastes. In any case, this beer goes down very smoothly, and hides it's huge amount of alcohol VERY well. It's almost easier to drink that the 90 minute.  All in all, this beer is incredibly good, and should not be missed. $9 for a bottle, or $10.50 on tap does seem expensive(expecially on a college budget like mine), but DFH 120 is well worth every penny. It's not a beer, it's an experiance. And this is one beer that should be experianced by everyone at some point. Granted, I don't think it's an IPA, or anything even close. It is way too malty and sweet to be classified as such.

Then again, at the time I'd probably never had a beer greater than 8% ABV. Wasn't I surprised, then, months later when I tried it again... and loved it.  I'm wondering if that's going to be the case with this beer. Granted, at almost $8 PER 12 oz. BOTTLE, I'm not sure it'll fit in my budget any time soon. At least, not until my portfolio matures.  My stance, for now, is that this is a beer for special occasions. If you drank one of these every day after work, you'd quickly become an alcoholic, because there is just a ton of alcohol in it.  As far as taste goes, this beer is all about the alcohol and the hops. The film left behind the dissipating head was so sticky that it never left.  Really, I have no gripes with this beer. I love hops, I love strong IPAs, but this beer was just too much for me. Once I've decided to stop being a pansy, I'll try again.

It was very sweet at first with a zing of hoppiness. The after taste was sweet too, not like a Lambic though.

10099,9086,shbobdb,2.42,"Now, I was really excited to try this beer. I like Dogfish Head as a brewery, and their 90 minute IPA is AMAZING. This beer, however, does not live up to its little brother. I found the taste to be overly vineous and sweet. Correction: cloyingly sweet. Don't get me wrong, I like malty beers, but this 'beer' reminded me of a very sweet blush wine. Dry-hopped? More like dry-humped. That isn't to say it's all bad. I was completely unaware as to the alcohol content while drinking this beer. Except near the end when it was pretty warm, I never noticed any alcohol bite. In short, I wouldn't buy this beer again if it were four dollar a bottle, let alone fifteen.

10099,9086,warchez,1.93,"Appearence: Looks identical to the 90minute IPA, great color as orangy vibrance, the head is a wonderful yellow-tan. bubles streamy up glass and are medium in size. If the boil is 30 minutes longer that the 90 minute, how do they keep the color the same? Wouldn't the wort caramelize a bit more and make a different colored beer, even a little? Aroma: Smells like porkfat or bad BBQ. I couldn't really get much hop character. There should be plenty of distinct hop aroma if it is truely dry hopped every day for a month, its not there. Perhaps the big malty character overwhelms the dryhopping process, reducing its efficiency. Taste: Holy cow this is big. Classic ""imperial"" sweetness. The intense maltiness is overpowering and now terrible enjoyable. tanginess presumably from the high ABV, bites at the tongue, making it difficult to taste teh complex malt body. The long hop schedule presents itself as being very sweet/flavorful, with little bitterness. As with the 90minute I expected to be blown away. Mouthfeel: very milk like texture. Caramel candy like stickiness on the palate.  Overall: It is amazing how sweet the hop flavor is, and the bitterness from teh hopping is just not there. I don't quit understand how this beer is really an IPA without the bitterness. Maybe just a really big hop flavored Pale ale. This is unique and novel, but its not good to drink. I am impressed by the technique and the truly unique character to this beer, it iw well done in the strangeness catagory.

10099,9086,bignick,4.25,"On tap at TPH 10/31/05 (boo).  This is a very good beer. It was poured into a DFH snifter. There was a decent head, and it was a nice amber. It smelled exclusively of medicinal alcohol. In a way, I almost wish it were served out of an over sized shot glass or even a highball glass, to eliminate the offensive smell. The taste, however, was incredible. It was both extremely sweet and bitter from the hops which was a cool mix. In addition, there was a mild citrus flavor to compliment the hops. It was delicious going down...I could drink this all night. Its drinkability is on par with a strong barleywine, and is much better then any 42 proof liquor. This is one mean beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,asabreed,4.67,"Wow, here it is, finally. I couldn't find this anywhere, but they had it at Caliente in Richmond, so a buddy and I split it, 6 ounces a piece.  Appearance: Not much head or lacing, but with the sweetness and high ABV%, it's to be expected  Smell: Fresh green hops more than a field of flowers, so to speak. Some orange as the citrus. Very very nice, very strong, and some sweetness shows through also.  Taste: Insanely well done for this type of brew. Initial burst of sweetness, thick sweetness, but there's so much hoppiness to it that it balances out. It's almost barley wine caliber, though a sweet barley wine more than a crazily hopped version, but the balance is incredible. There's a honey-like sweetness that comes through, which makes sense, and some sweet orange zest, not lemon so much, but I can definitely discern the orange flavor. The reason this works seems to be from the extremes -- so much alcohol, so much sweetness, but the nutty process of hopping makes it a fantastic experiment and a singularly beautiful brew. A success on all accounts: this one takes you to great places, and it's a beer like none other.  Mouthfeel: Thick, creamy, silky, low carbonation (with the high ABV% and sweetness). Certainly a treat.  Drinkability: Share this with a friend, as I did. It's surely a must, though I could've finished the bottle with at least an hour to do it. An amazing beer, and I'll be looking for a case ASAP to cellar and enjoy on special occasions, and of course winter also.

The bouquet was extremely intense hops and a slight hint of fruits.The taste was of hops first and foremost; what I expect from an IPA but ended very smooth and relatively sweet. There was a bit of carbonation to begin with, but it died down after a few minutes. As it warmed, subtle flavors of citrus(namely orange) and honey came out, giving a very pleasant creamy mouthfeel and overall excellent beer experience.

10099,9086,NiceGuyMike,3.53,"I'm not a great fan of IPAs. I've enjoyed them in the past, but they are not something I seek out. This, however, is a DIPA and my first.  I've never sought this beast out even though it gets written up a lot. I've had their 60 minute IPA, and to be honest it was too hoppy. I cannot imagine the 90 minute IPA. The 120 was something I was afraid to even think of. Tonight is the first time I ever saw it at a store. I had to get it even for $6.99 for a 12 oz bottle. I had some excitement to have such a highly praised brew.  Appearance: decent, dark amber color. I poured lightly so not much of a head, but a little head present contains lacing (impressive amount of lace).  Smell: hmmm....soap. As intense hop smell as any I've ever smelt. So much so, that my excitement faded a bit thinking it would taste like every other IPA. I do enjoy the smell of hoppy beers, I just generally don't like the flavors very much.  After a few drinks I started to notice some sweet maple scents. Not bad, very interesting.  Taste: unexpected....totally unexpected. Not sure how to describe, so I shall use stream of conscience for it. Very sweet. Almost like a Belgian dubel in sweetness. Smoky caramel with maple syrup. Medicine flavor. The medicine is the only trace of alcohol I can pick up. For such an extremely high alcohol content, I've never had something so balanced. Too sweet, too syrupy.  Mouthfeel: full bodied....not much carbonation. Syrupy...every much so.  Drinkabilty: I poured half a 12 oz bottle in a small glass...I'm through about 3/4ths of it and feel like I've been kicked in the ass. Not very drinkable.  Notes: I'm impressed with this. Not sure I like it so much, but I'm impressed. It is very complex, extremely complex. The complexity is what makes me give it a 4 for taste. My initial take on drinkabilty is 2.5, but after thinking about it I'll give it a 3.0 because I want to try this again, just not right now.

10099,9086,froggyfrog,4.12,"Presentation:  2004 vintage 12 oz. bottle purchased by me from DFH brewpub in Rehoboth in August 2005 decanted into a snifter-type wine glass in October 2005.  Appearance:  A muddy looking cloudy ruby-orange in color. It looks like a considerable amount of yeast in suspension even though this bottle has been sitting untouched for several months.  Lots of carbonation is visible in the glass at first, with hundreds of tiny bubbles clinging to the bottom of the glass and then rising up the sides.  Smell:  This beer is an olfactory delight. An amazing sweet citrusy aroma assaults the nose. The faintest hint of smoke and ultimately a crisp alcohol note round out the smell.  Mouthfeel and Taste:  Big and thick on the tongue, surprising for an IPA. The bitterness is there but the balance leans more towards the malt. The citrusy hops in the nose are almost completely drowned out in the mouth.  The citrus fruit theme does still continue on the tongue, but now it's a darker flavor. I'm tasting a bitter orange flavor like a rind. The alcohol is a pronounced but not unfavorable flavor component. This beer tastes like an orange-flavored dark rum (if there ever was such a thing.)  Drinkability:  My God! There is about a half inch of liquid left in the glass and I'm having trouble focusing on my monitor as I write this. A little hint: watch out for that 21% ABV. I guess as an alcohol delivery vehicle this would be about the same as shotgunning four or five [insert crappy mass-produced beer name here] in a half an hour.  So drinkability then, except for the falling down on the floor part I could probably drink these all night. The beer is super smooth and tastes quite good. Unfortunately my glass is empty and that means its time to wrap this up.  Endnotes:  This is a huge, full-bodied beer. The sugary sweetness was a surprise. My wife's take on this beer: smells like brown sugar with rubbing alcohol in it. I'll agree with the brown sugar reference, this beer leaves a caramelized sugar stickiness wherever it goes. Big Citrus in the nose gives way to that sweet sugary goodness in the mouth and finishes with that ""Holy Crap I'm Drunk Now"" warm feeling in the belly.  Final Verdict on DFH 120 Minute:  Well worth the ten dollars I had to part with to acquire it. Sam Calagione...I love you man!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

It's the color of a new penny (the beer obviously, not the head) now that I lood at it. Tons of lacing is already sticking to the glass.  S - A nice caramel aroma, along with some piney hops. A touch of alcohol could be felt as I inhaled as well.  T - Tastes like sweet caramel on the first sip. I'm picking up the candy corn flavor that I've seen others talk about. I detect a tiny hop presence, of course I expected none at all after two years, and an alcoholic kick. A distinct taste, one of those that I'm not sure if I like but can't stop sipping.  M - Very smooth, not much carbonation as can be expected but it feels nice on the tungue and has some alcohol warming that rolls right down into your gut.  D - Obviously a sipper, with the high alcohol content and sweetness, but not as rough to drink as I expected.  Notes: Glad I gave this one a try, don't know how often I'll go for this one but it is definitely an experience.

Nice lacing from beginning to end and fine foam remained righ through to the finish. The aroma was a good balance of caramel and toasted maltiness, warm alcohol, and rich American hops (mostly pine) that were never quite aggressive. Big, caramel malt flavour kicks things off, and the alcohol warmth begins at the midpoint. This is also where the hops pick up, starting with pine and changing to orange/citrus towards the finish. Great balance. Full, viscous body that's just short of syrupy. Medium dry finish from the bountiful hop resin.

The mouthfeel is amazingly thick, low carbonation, very warming from the throat on down, slight alcohol burn. The warming/burn is really the only alcohol presence you get, besides the fact thatr 6 oz will give you a mean buzz. Very surprisingly drinkable, it was a shame to see the end of the glass.

A penny copper tone is the IPA, and the head rises fashionably late, almost delinquent compared to other beers. The head is thin, but a holy white that sparkles.  S: I smell apricots and a slight hint of peaches that shelter the smell of alcohol very well. I thought with this Double IPA having 20% alcohol that it would be a lot stronger.  T: The taste of apricots with a hint of walnut is what this drink reminds me of at first taste, then it transforms into a strong Sherry taste, very sweet. The after taste has a bit of hops, that gets slightly overwhelmed by the strength of the alcohol, despite this I find the taste very fascinating. It also has a nice sweet spice to this, reminds me of the spicy sweetness sauce found in the Korean Dish of Bi Bim Bop.

Nose is caramel with fragrant florals and a more subtle citrus hop, nicely balanced.  Light carbonation in a thin but refreshing body, caramel sweetness and biscuits overpowering whatever bitterness there is supposed to be in here, resulting in IBUs perceived as much lower than the 90-minute. Goes down with a rush of piney spice and activity, the first time with a nice warmth, subsequently the spice alone. Lingers satisfyingly.  Not as hoppy as I expected, nor as it should be, a little on the sweet side. Alcohol is masked very well, and quite drinkable. Ended up sipping it though, not really sessionable. Can't really compare it to the 90 or 60, either, as the purposes are totally different.

The taste is something else, full hop attack is quickly diminished as the malt sweetness takes over and the alcohol finishes and the aftertaste lingers on and on.

It sticks to and covers the sides of the glass, and looks wonderful. High appearance score is mostly because of beautiful white head.  The moment I opened the bottle I knew that the smell would be 5. I love hops, and I cannot ask for more from the aroma. Hops, hops and more hops. I feel grapefruit and some orange. Very aromatic.  The taste is a bit of a let down.

Smell: Alcohol...rum soaked dark fruits, almost burning on the nose. Very English Barleywine-esque. Maybe port-like in smell with burnt sugars dominating throughout. How this smells like a double IPA? I don't know.  Taste: Good gawd. Malty almost cloying sweetness. Brown sugar notes, ice wine, honey, dried dark fruits, with a metallic finish. Amazingly, the alcohol is hidden nicely. This tastes like no IPA I've had before. I don't know if it's b/c of the age of this beer but I taste no hop presence at all. This continues to be more reminiscent of a barley wine.  Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a light syrupy feel.  Drinkability: I'm glad I split this. I was barely able to finish the shared sample. Nothing is off here but this is a sipper for sure. It pushes the envelope and I have to give DFH credit for that. There are many beers with smaller ABV's that can blend flavor and ETOH like DFH does.

Smell: sort of a citrusy, piney, grape-like hop smell reaches my nose just as soon as I open the bottle.  Taste: Well it is very much hopped indeed. Not quite past my tolerance level though. Incredibly sweet alcohol...something like good russian vodka. Hops are very grape-like and a hint of cedar.

Drinkability: How drinkable can it be? you might ask? Hopped to hell and extremely high gravity--but done in such a way to make it an easy drink for the hop head in me. The real question is probably whether it is worth the hefty price. I can't buy it everyday, but it is still worth a try.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,TastyTaste,4.92,"I was going to save this for a special occasion, but I figure today is special enough. Pours out more like a normal pale ale than I expected, clear copper body, with very minimal carbonation, but has a head that lingers longer than I expected. The nose hides the ABV very well, I just smell huge hops, quite impressive.  The taste is a through and through hop bonanza. Huge bitter, unrelenting, punishing in some respects. The alcohol adds to the intensely sharp flavors this beer has in store for the consumer. 21%? Yeah, but extremely drinkable for being stronger than some hard alcohol. Wow, DFH, keep it up.  A very huge thanks and dumptruck full of beer karma to Twilight for the awesome sample.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,paterlodie,3.74,"Not much head but lasting ok and amberbrown beer. Nose is very much hops; citrussy and a nice sharp maltnote. Alcohol and some sweeter malt in the back but alltogether a very fresh and good nose. Taste is IMO overdone on many occasions. Too sweet, heavy and bitter witch dominate the whole taste. Some maltyness there but mostly sweet& bitter. One that would do good on a clear and sunny cold day after a long walk with my dog but to sticky for me now.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,lostbearbrew,2.43,"Single bottle 12 oz  2004. From bottle shop in Boston. Served cold, at about 58 degrees.  Pours a light golden with hints of amber. Looks like a fairly average beer in its body  not like most other DIPAs Ive made or tasted. Decent lacing, small head.  Good strong smell of hops in the nose, but overpowering all else is the waft of alcohol. Wow! Yes, it is 20%, and yes, you can sense it coming. Very unlike the WWS, which I thought hid the abv well in both the nose and the taste.  Ok, the taste  if this were meant to be a barleywine or a brandy, Id give it higher marks. I felt like I was drinking grain alcohol mixed with beer. Syrup texture belies the look of the beer, and the sweet residual taste brings much more alcohol (yes, MORE) but not much of a hops finish. Disappointing in that regard. As it warmed, more flavors became apparent - took me 2.5 hours to finish this 12 oz beer - and there was a nuance or two that came forward but nothing that made me think it was better 2.5 hours later.  I do not think I would purchase another bottle at this price point. I do especially like the 90 min IPA, but find the 60 and the 120 lacking in different respects. For me DFH is very hit and miss for my palate.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Thick and sticky, sweet mouthfeel, makes you sip it from start to finish.  The taste is not hoppy like one would imagine, but more of a malty sweet syrup. The alcohol warms, but does not overpower even with a 20% abv. There are tones of brandy. A great brew that is a must try!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,LPorter33,2.58,"Purchased single bottle of 2004 batch from Martignetti's (about $10). Waited many months to crack this baby open.  Appearance = Good looking semi transparent light golden amber. Not as thick as I would have imagined. Minimal head but respectable lacing.  Smell = Hops hops hops but loaded with alchol also. A bit overwhelming and smells like the taste won't hide the alcohol in the least.  Taste = It's a little too much for me. The alcohol is VERY intense all the way thorugh. There's a peculiar, disturbing salty taste that hits you upfront and lasts for a bit. This is definitely a slow sipping beer. It could use more flavor. I wish there was more of a cirtus flavor as with the 90 minute. Aftertaste doesn't give you much, just a lot more alcohol. Very syrupy tasting, nearly like a strong liquor.  Overall = After loving the 60 and 90 minute IPAs, I'm very disappointed with the 120 minute, especially give its price.

10099,9086,mentor,3.96,"12 oz bottle obtained from Sulldaddy (thanks!) and shared with MABZ in June 2005. Poured a one-finger light cream head that left decent lacing on the inside of the glass. The beer was clear and light orange in color. Smells almost like a crystal sugar with and orange character. Some apricots. Flavors start with hop-tangerine, oranges, a *really* sweet malty, some cinamon and then APRICOT. There is a tiny moment of piney and pineapple to the hops. Hop bitter and co-ho comes along only during the swallow, prior to the swallow, the beer is all about the sweet and fruit. There is a gentle alcohol sting, that in no way presents as 20%. The aftertaste just hangs around forever. There's just a ting of carbonation forming on my tastebuds that combines with the alcohol on the inside of my lips. This combination counters some of the sweet and fruit. I think this beer need more hops and some caramel. To me, it's just too sweet and I felt like I wasn't able to catch everything that was going on. Thick mouthfeel and mildly caronbated. The beer just sticks to the tongue. It isn't quite syrupy, it's just really pleasant.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

The taste was a bit disappointing. I love the 60 minute hop profile for what it is, but it is completely lost in residual sugars in this monstrosity of a beverage.  Mouthfeel is syrupy. Alcohol is huge, but completely hidden under the sugar. Overbearing to say the least.

10099,9086,scooter231,2.39,"This is certainly the strongest beer I've had so far. And, as chance would have it, not my most favorite of beers.  It pours a pretty light orangeish color with some white frothy head, very appealing looking. But looks can be deceiving. It smelled... slightly fruity, but mostly more of a vinegar smell- not the most appetizing combination.  The taste... rubbing alcohol comes to mind. Some fruityness prevails but mostly it's just not a wonderful tasting thing. Mouthfeel is okay, nothing special. Drinkabilty... well, I had half a bottle, and that was half a bottle too much. Sure, this will send you from sober to drunken haze pretty quickly, but personally, I'd rather enjoy what I'm drinking if intoxication is my goal.

The flavor grows on you after awhile but it's too intense at first. Not quite as hopped up in flavor as I was expecting... probably because of the alcohol content. Quite a bit of fruityness to be found. Certainly looks like an IPA in color and clarity. I rather enjoy the smell of it... though, again, too much alcohol. However... considering that it has the alcohol content of a liqueur, it's pretty well balanced. Double IPA? Maybe more like a pentuple IPA.

Light copper with a small white head that sticks to the glass, but lasts only a few minutes.  Smells like fruit syrup. Sweet with some alcohol underneath. There's some citric hops in there too.  Tastes like alcoholic fruit syrup. This is one decievingly thick ass beer. I would expect something this oily to be black. Very sugary, oily, and warming as it goes down. There's some hop juiciness to distract you from the sweet thickness.  There's no way in hell this could be a session beer.

10099,9086,TheLongBeachBum,3.45,"Presentation: 12 fluid ounce bottle with a simple brass colored crown cap. Parchment quality label has the words Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA The Imperial India Pale Ale underneath the picture of a hop cone. Bottom of the label has the words AGES WELL Brewed in 03 04 05, nicked at 04. Cost me $7.99 about a year ago, it has been in my beer cupboard since and my fridge for the last week.  Appearance: Decided to use a tall curve sided flute for this on, considering the fact that this was going to be a sipper. In fact, I used my borrowed LopLop Glass from the Brussels Bar of the same name. Has a graded color profile, light gold at the base thickens to an orange-gold at the surface. Dissolved carbonation quickly forms a reasonable looking white collar head, maybe a ¼ thick. The head slowly dissolves, but it never disappears, the  Nose: Dark dried orange peels, alcohol, sweet malts, laced citric vodka and heavy sweetish malts, but not much in the way of classic hops strangely.  Taste: Sweet start that builds into a warming middle laced with hop oils and gelatinous fruits such as pineapples, oranges, and a highly distilled white wine essence. Syrupy feel that detracts from the experience for me. Has a solvent like nasal singe at times.  Mouthfeel: Warming tropical fruit dimension in mouth, screeching hop-heat in the swallow, the 20% alcohol is still here. Thick fruity feel but it is not that appealing to me, big feel but sickly.  Drinkability: It is a sipper and whilst I love the hops, the oily nature and the burn and that annoying nasal singe means that even the little 12 ounce bottle takes a while to finish.  Overall: Maybe this is one of those brews that really needs a few years hidden away, but even after a year it still feels raw to me  and thinking about it, I dont really see how it will improve to be honest.  Sure, its a unique brew, and yeah props to DFH for creating a 20% Imperial IPA, or an American D-IPA, or whatever you want to call it, but I prefer the big-ass IPAs from Alesmith, Bear Republic, Great Divide, Stone, Rogue & Russian River and I still think the [750ml] DFH 90-Minute IPA kicks ass and is the best of the Doggie styles  The beer world's version of all those funky Concept Cars that never make it. Sometimes beers are just too big, I think that is the case here, and it doesnt really deserve top marks just for that..I think this is over-rated IMVHO.  Im an Imperialist you know..but this is a 'one-off' DFH 120-min Imperial IPA try for me, worth it and definitely and experience, but I wont bother with it again.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

What I got: Fresh beer brewed in 2005 not aged for very long. Purhcased from Cloverleaf today. Smell is very hoppy, head is creamy not very fizzy and one finger high. Piney in aroma. Certainly costs a lot more than a Bell's 2 Hearted at $7.99 for a 12 fl. oz. bottle. Expensive.  Taste: Hops! A bit of a sweet flavor. Kind of rings on the palate. Surprisingly not much bitterness. No grapefruit hops. I'm not sure what type of hops is used. Not a green hoppy taste. Some alcohol burning sensation but not much. A bit more sweet and malty tasting than expected.  Not very drinkable in large quantities. I enjoy other IPA's more and not worth the extra money.  By the way, I had no idea this one was at 20% ABV. It tasted like it had far less alcohol.

An alcohol presence makes a very nice appearance. There is some bitterness and hop flavor to balance out the sweetness, but not nearly as much as the sample I had on tap. The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy, as expected with a beer this big. Not very drinkable in a pounding sense, but for 21% alcohol its not bad. The tap version had even less alcohol presence.

Smell was strong, hoppy and earthy, particularly reminiscent of grass, or peat. Taste was spicy, vinous like a barley wine and not as hoppy or bitter as I expected. Very smooth mouthfeel.

Left a small lace island floating on the surface.  Aroma seemed to have a grainy, grassy hop bouquet, this could be due to age. Smelled of sweet malts like that in unfermented wort, still lots of sugar left here. Alcohol will hit you in the nose!  Flavor consits of big bold sweet malts with lots of caramel. Nice piney hop bit still there, although I am sure it was huge when fresh. Smooth warming alcohol in the finish, just sip this one!  Mild carbonation but appropriate with a nice thick mouthfeel.

The alcohol though quite noticeable really takes a back seat to the massive hops. The sweetness in the taste was a bit surprising. Plenty of hops going on but it seems its so hopped its a hop induced sweetness. Not quite cloying and the alcohol really plays a part in balancing that out. Tasty stuff, that would be better with a touch less sweetness in the flavor, but at this strength that might not be possible. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy with a coating sweetness. Towards the end of the bottle the sweetness really started to get to me which hurt the drinkability a touch.

I saw a 12 oz. bottle of the 120 in the back of the cooler and took it home. I waited about a week before trying it. I wanted a real unbiased opinion. I read about the bitterness units and the 120 blew away the 90. So the rating said. When I finally opened the 120 the first sip was alcohol, followed by sweet. Somewhere in there the hops kicked in but from what I remembered, I though the 90 was much more harsh. I took me 35 minutes to down the one bottle. You have to sip this like cognac. While I did like the smell, taste and mouthfeel, drinkability suffers. I couldn't do more than one bottle. First, the 20 abv will have you ready for a root canal with out novacaine. (I was buzzed for more than an hour from one bottle.) Second, it's way to sweet/hoppy. And third, I don't know if it's the alcohol or the hops or the combination of everything but, I had some wicked heartburn after this one. This is a good one for those special occasions when you need to forget the world for a while. Like when your house burns down or something. Two 120's and you'll forget everything.

Taste - Well, it is very bitter, but I was expecting something that was going to toss me on my behind. Much to my surprise, this beer is also quite sweet. Alcoholic warmth is very strong, but well balanced.  Mouthfeel - Great, very thick body. Sticky. This is truly a sippin' beer. The beer finishes with a alcoholic burn.

Aroma relects of a rich hop bouquet and discreet carmel undertones. First taste is an explosion of hop intensity. The balance of the high alcohol content, malt, and hop intensity creates what I would call a suprising sweetness. Subsequent tastes reveal the depths of the malt and hop mingling. The warming effect of the alcohol is evident, but not as intense as in the high-alcohol barleywine and stout offering by Dogfish Head.

THAT was an experience... and gave me one HELL of a buzz.  This particular one had almost no head, but did leave lacing on the glass, as the other two did. Visually, all three were pretty close. They were all clear, yellow, and a bit fizzy.  This one's aroma was of intense aromatic hops, overlying a deep malt fruitiness. Like the others, but twice as much. Also, there was an alcohol presence that the others did not have.  The taste... INTENSE bittering hops, smoothing out to a mild bitter pine taste with an alcohol aftertaste. Didn't taste like a 20%, but maybe a 15%. It was definitely there. Again, quite a bit like the others, but doubled.  Mouthfeel was pretty thick... VERY chewy.  And drinkability? The one bottle was enough for me, thanks. Wouldn't want to do more than that.  It was a hell of an experience, one that I think I was glad to have, if I remember it right through the haze.

Aroma is lots of malt sweet caramel some toffee lots of citrus hops hit the nose at the start but soon fade under the malt. Woo taste is really sweet lots of candy like sugars then lingering caramel lasts for a while until the citrus hops add some flavor to try and drown out the overwhelming sweetness to no success. This beer needs lots more hops to balance it out. Some alcohol flavors show up here and there but are not strong considering the 20%. Mouthfeel is big surpy almost very full but how could it not be considering the malt in this beer. Drinkability is not good way to sweet to be drinkable for me. Still this is a beer everyone try atleast once just to experience it.   Finally had to try again as constantly seeing people praise this beer.  Overall nose is nice of course it was before. Taste is better though wonder if what I had before had too much age on it. But not as cloying as I made it out to be but still to much malt and could use more hops.

It pours golden honey colored with a shaggy white head that quickly fades, leaving thick trails of lace in my Delerium tulip. A swirl around the glass shows that it is a thick, viscous brew.  It smells like I'm in a flower garden here. Super bright, floral and orangey citrus hops dominate the nose. Like honey drenched hop flowers, it is a combination of sweet and spicey.  Awesome upfront burst of malt sweetness quickly overshadowed by intense floral, citrus, candied fruit, clover honey, and pinecone flavors. Very deep and complex hops are the highlight.  Mouthfeel is thick, oily, and coating. Finish is sweet fade into hop oblivion. Alcohol is warming, but does not steal the sceen.  Like I said, I like this much better than the cellared bottled I've had. It's far less sweet, and has a lot better hop profile. I think another 3-4 months may help round it out and mellow the heat a bit, but it tastes pretty damn amazing now!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Pegasus,3.62,"Appearance: Quite clear medium brassy golden color, moderately carbonated with a small off-white head, which retains well.  Aroma: Devastating floral, orange, and light sweet fruit hop aroma, hiding beneath all of this is some light malt, amazing that it was able to assert itself amidst all of the hop pungency. That being said, the hop aroma is more floral and tangy, rather than being bitter.  Taste: Incredibly sweet caramel malt balanced against intense, but mild hop flavors. The staggering alcoholic content of twenty percent goes largely unnoticed in the taste, due to the sweet malt character, tangy light fruit notes, and lesser hops, although it is quite warming. Finishes with a note that is slightly reminiscent of port.  Mouth feel: Very smooth, quite thick and syrupy, feels like a cordial on the palette.  Drinkability/notes: A most interesting creation, quite difficult to categorize. Those expecting over the top hop bitterness will be disappointed; it has a very high alcoholic content, but this goes largely unnoticed until afterwards, so it lacks a significant characteristic of Old Ale or Barley wine. Well worth a try, if only to ponder over.

The aroma is definately hops, overpowering any malt and even that 21% alcohol. My first guess is a citrusy centennial or amarillo hop, but as I let it sit my nose tells me piney northern brewer, or possibly chinook. The flavor is surprisingly harsh, with the hop flavor being somewhat grassy and medicinal. There just doesn't seem to be enough malt flavor to balance the hops. I am impressed at the subdued nature of the alcohol. My palate seems a little sore from the harshness.

Alcohol is present in the aroma as well. The flavor is malty and sugary sweet. It has a citrus hop flavor throughout, along with alcohol.

10099,9086,schemb,4.2,"I violated my review rules and read another review before I wrote this one. Here's why - I had different experience with the same tap: Spuyten Duyvel, Bkln 11/27/04. Ok, yeah, its stong as hell and yes kinda like bourbon. I found it to be frighteningly drinkable though. I did only have one, so as not to make the early morning rain swept holiday traffic commute back to Boston that much worse. It was well hopped but also well balanced - quite an accomplishment at its strength. I had a hard time believing it was 20%, sure its a sipper, but I didn't labor to finish it. Maybe it was at the magic spot in the keg, maybe the Cantillon I had before it was the perfect warmup, or maybe I have alien DNA but I found 120 to be a real pleasure. I have the impression that in the bottle this is much more of a beast but the magic of the tap's introducing some air and letting out some of the demon spirit really tamed it.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,SCW,3.11,"I had this beer on tap at... where else? Spuyten Duyvil.  I don't know how to exactly rate this beer according to style, because let's face it, are there really any other beers in its class?  It's 20% alcohol, and nobody even comes close. An American Double IPA? Lol. This stuff is a licquer.  I have to give them props for the nice appearance. To have a beer this strong and this light in color (a nice amber hue) is pretty amazing. It obviously took a lot of malt to achieve the gravity, even if they only took the first runnings.  The smell was pretty good too. Obviously, it was packed with aroma hops, but then again, I think it was necessary. Underneath the smell of hops was the lingering of higher fusel alcohols, and it could be detected more and more with every whiff.  The taste? Well, it was balanced, but then again, it kind of tasted like gasoline.  The mouthfeel was pretty good. It was thinner than what I expected for being so high in alcohol.  I don't think this beer is very drinkable. As a matter of fact, it's only a sipper. It just doesn't go down easy. But I think that's how it's meant to be, one glass and you're done.

Try paint. A few swirls erupts this to a coating that sticks.  Pungent sweet hop oil and pine sap aromas like a nugget of hops. Grassy blast with some malt to back up this out of control hop tornado.  First Swigs: Fusel burning hop juice. My tongue is blasted off the perception map after one sip. Burn goes down the gullet. There can be no description written to describe this cooker. My tongue is torched. Seriously speaking, there is an orange juice concentrate flavor. Under the avalanche of fusel hops, some malt character emerges. Complex as complex can be.  Full bodied, coating like a Home Depot roller was rolled on my tongue. Coated like a sip of Ouzo 12. Despite the hotness and isopropyl notes, this sucker is drinkable. Another would be most appreciated, if there were another.  Last Swigs: Rummy awl-kee-hawl pine hop syrup. Calling this an Imperial IPA is like calling rocket fuel Imperial gasoline. This is the stuff that other IPAs are made of add water. This is the first time that a beer inspired me to reflect upon the condition of my esaphagous. The most references to body parts ever used. This is just an insane brew. For making it and for drinking it. This is a 100% MUST HAVE for those that dare. Otherwise, you are not missing much of a burn and hop oil imbiber. All reviews from BA are loooong.

The sweetness was overpowering in the smell and I could hardly discern any floral notes. The taste hit right away with a massive flow of sweet malt. Too much in my opinion.(perhaps I should have let it sit longer than the 6months) It seemed more like sugar water than a beer since it was on the lower side of carbonation. Not much of a hoppy bite like in the traditional IPA.

It's cloying sweetness diminishes somewhat as it warms, but still not much fun to drink/sip/whatever. The high ABV makes it a serious sipper, but it is too damn sweet to do anything else with it no matter the ABV. This was a 2004 bottling of the 12 oz version...and a stark contrast to what I enjoyed on tap at the AOBF '03. I gotta say though, the 20% ABV is well disguised...no small feat. I still have an '03 750 ml original in the cellar, and after this 12 oz version I'm thinking I'll let that bad boy sit for quite some time.

It poured a coppery, amberish also in color, and left a nice 1/4"" head that left nice lacing on the sides of Trusty.  To smell it...oh my GOD! Can I get some hops with my sugar please!!!???? The hops smell was suprising subtle next to the smell of sugary sweetness w/ tones of citrus in there as well. As I began to tilt the glass to sip, the hops shot up my nostrals and left me with some delightment.  Taste- Okay, I am biased about DogFish Head in that I enjoy their beers maybe more than from any other brewer, but I have to say that after having the 90 minute, I didn't think it could get any better than that...well, it did...a half hour of hopping sure makes a difference in taste and feel. From the start the 20% alcohol doesn't mess around and hits you with burn right away. It makes it tough to taste any hops, which you do get some there and they come on at the end of the swallow and leave a great aftertaste, along with lots of sugar there. Due to the carbonation and alcohol burn along with hops, I almost got a peppery taste in there that was interesting.  Mouthfeel- aside from the destruction of my palette due to alcohol burn (yager style), this beer is a very creamy, full-bodied Imperial IPA to which no others can hang with! Decent carbonation there, bitey alcohol; what more can you ask for from DogFish?

10099,9086,Ego,4.62,"regarding the other reviews, I suspect this wouldnt be as good in a bottle, but I was lucky to get it on tap (4 oz serving in a snifter). You don't immediately sense the alcohol at all, and the light brown color throws you off (but seems consistent with the style). I too thought that at 20% + it might be barley wine style-ish but on tap it was not nearly as syrupy as say foghorn or bigfoot. Dogfish hit a homerun in my book, for this depth this is unreal. You could slug this stuff if challenged but yet sipping provided a much nicer experience. I really did not feel an overwhelming alcohol nose or flavor. It flowed nicely with barely any head, correct carbonation, just enough to slide over the tongue. After a little 4 oz version the alcohol hits you, the strength on the start is way less than barley wine in notice-ability imo, although I understand the comparison. It was very light feeling on the stomach consisdering the strength of the brew. It had a nice light mahogany color, and very clear, not much lace on the glass after sips.

Now after saying that I have tried alot of thier beers and have been looking for the 120. I bought a bottle of it for 17 dollars and rushed home to taste it. I was immediately dissapointed. It is a good beer however I love hoppy beer and looked as though this one would be the holly grail (it wasn't). Very Sweet and alcoholic, which drowns out alot of the hop flavors. This is a great barley wine and should be classified as a barley wine.

Those lofty expectations were likely unjust, but the beer seems to have missed more modest marks. While it's lovely, a light and fiery red orange, the brew seems surprisingly simple. There are three notes that show up repeatedly- resinous hops, sugary sweetness, and alcohol. The beer smells and tastes the same. It's oversweet, tasting more like a sweetened barleywine than an IPA. I could almost feel the sugars crystallizing on my tongue. The beer feels saturated with sugar. For a sipping beer, this brew was almost, but not quite, tedious to drink.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Theres just a sheen of head but thats really all I would expect given the abv. No where near the aroma I expected-while floral and hoppy its somewhat subdued. Almost reminds me of that ""new capret"" smell. Theres also a slight sweetness to it.  Wonderful flavor. Big,big assertive hop rush-very citrusy. A caramel like sweetness and a slight,slight alcohol finish behind it all. It really is very well balanced overall. Velvety smooth but for the slight alcohol burn. Again the burn is not unpleasant its just the way it finishes.  Man I could have a few of these!!!! 20%? Where? Didnt know what to expect-had heard a few negatives but this is a killer beer.

I certainly could taste plenty of alcohol (Especially towards the end), but not much more than some much lower ABV beers. Lots of hops, and a great malt backbone. Overall balance leans to the malt, as expected. Appearance similar to other IPA's, and it (amazingly) had some head and lacing! I was feeling a little under the weather, so I broke this out (I've had it for a while).

This beer is re-dry hopped every day for a month and as a hop-head, I figured this would be a real treat. At 20% abv, this is the 2nd highest abv I've ever tried.  Beer arrived in a tulip style ale glass. Medium to light yellowish-tan with creamy dense head peeking playfully above the rim. The head had tremendous staying power and left very heavy lacing. It's a rather pretty beer.  Smell was absolutely nothing like I expected. I was expecting a tremendous over-the-top blast of hops like nothing I've ever smelled before. What I got was an interesting balance of citrus hops along with carmel and vanilla. Strong alcohol presence in the nose as well. It's smelled more like a fine liquer than a beer, but in a good way.  Taste was absolutely incredible. Lots of sweet carmelized malts, medium cascade hops presense and a ton of alcohol. Strong vanilla flavor in the finish.  Mouthfeel was heavy and strong, a little syrupy. This is a beer to sip VERY slowly.  I'm not sure this is going to be in the weekly (or even monthly) rotation of my regular beers, but I can see having one to celebrate special occasions.

I really can't believe the way the alcohol hides in the taste here when cold but becomes so apparent as it warms. Maple syrup texture mixed in with an upfront honey sweetness. Lots of residual sugars. Alcohol, though hidden well by the sweetness, tries to offset the syruppy texture and cloying aspects to some avail but ultimately suffers. It does however provide another depth of flavor. Slight grassy hops lie underneath but are faint until the finish. They are stronger in the finish but here the alcohol kick comes in for real. I feel it trickle down my body warming me up instantly. That is very good and very intense but the flavor profile seems to lack a depth or creativity that the really excellent beers have.

There are certainly some floral notes in there though.  Taste is very full, which kinda threw me off. I was expecting a hop monster, but the malt sweetness was so high that it pretty much took over. If this had been a blind testing I would have thought I was drinking a barley wine. The alcohol that was very present in the nose sure does hide in the taste though. I would have guessed around 10-11% and to be honest I forgot that this was a 20% beer until I started this review.

10099,9086,FormatKid,4.7,"This beer has sat in my fridge for weeks, Ive really anticipated trying it but have been waiting for just the right moment to sit and enjoy it. It was also highly recommended to me to try this with pancakes so that was a further issue. Well here it is, Friday afternoon, my work closed due to flood warnings, the perfect time for a nice late breakfast of pancakes and 40 proof beer.  This is a 12oz bottle, with the DFH head labels I so love which indicates this was a member of the 03 batch (being consumed 9/04). I pulled it from the refrigerator and let it sit while I made my pancakes and reach cellar temperature. Upon cracking the cap I heard the faintest hiss of carbonation escaping and could already smell hops and alcohol with the bottle literally feet away from my face, pouring it resulted in that smell spreading even further. I served this one in my round goblet, looking through the body is the color of beaten copper. The head is meager, but that is to be expected in a beer that is this huge. What does survive the blistering ABV is very sticky and clings to the glass creating spider-web thin patterns of lacing. Only the tiniest stream of teeny-tiny carbonation bubbles roll up through the center of the goblet and coalesce into the thin filmy layer of head that survives.  Wow, the smell is a truly unique and powerful experience unparalleled by anything Ive ever encountered. Hops and alcohol, big time. The hops smell juicy and citrusey and the alcohol comes off a bit grainy and oaky. The two seem to be married though so its almost hard to discriminate when youve stopped smelling hops and started smelling alcohol. Sticky sweet caramelly malt also resides powerfully in the nose, standing up even to the forces of the hops and booze.  As anticipated by the smell, the taste is unlike anything Ive ever tried before either. The beginning presents me with a faint hint of the floral hops and vibrating bitterness that will fully unfurl later, I catch a hint of a dry apple taste that I find commonly in higher ABV beers here as well. The middle is as explosive with malts as some of the most girthy barleywines I have tried before. Sweet, sticky, sweet and sweet, I agree with others if you dont like beers that have a lot of residual sweetness in them, than this beer is not for you. It almost seems I could pour this on my pancakes in substitution for syrup. You wont hear me complaining though!! The finish completes the voyage and brings it full circle, flat, ground-shaking bitterness, and floral, citrusy hop flavors appear as the last of the sweet malt is being pryed from your tongue, a spicy alcohol character appears before you swallow and a gust of alcohol fumes seems to assault my nose from the inside out. Warmth from the alcohol spreads welcomely down my throat and pools in my belly. The carbonation is very soft and if you didnt catch it the mouthfeel is syrupy and sticky.  Wow, very different from what I was expecting, yet no less amazing. If youre smart youll take the advice I did and plan yourself a special little block of time, with a nice meal of pancakes and sip away.

Holy grail is quite fitting, as this beer has reached legandary stature, and for very good reason. The first time I tried this was at Charlie's Kitchen at a Dogfish Head tasting and Sam brought a mini keg, it was unbelievable.  This bottle poured a mellow, Fall brown with minimal head. Smells very sweet and hoppy, with a hints of alcohol as well. Tastes strongly of alcohol and hops. It's very sweet and smooth and goes down all too easily for something that is 20% alcohol. Needless to say drinkability is quite low on this one, well it is if you wish to avoid becoming comatose that is.

10099,9086,assurbanipaul,3.33,"Pours a bright honey-gold with a thin, lasting head and tiny, tiny microbubbles throughout. Aroma is fruity citrus and pale malt, not that much different than other IPAs. No trace of alcohol in the nose (more noticeable as it warms, though).  Taste is very strong, sweet malts and orangey hops with a fair dose of candy sugar. Very nice hop presence without being too cloying or overpowering with bitterness. Taste reminds me of a very high-octane SNPA or Celebration mutant. Very much in the barley wine league rather than IPA both in taste and heft. Little trace of alcohol in the taste either, but a familiar burn going down the gullet leaves one with no mistake that this is a sipping beverage.  Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy but very, very smooth. Impressions are more towards a nice hoppy brandy than a beer. A credit to the brewer that such an outrageous product is not only still drinkable but enjoyable.

Some hop bitterness up front that combine with a powerful alcohol flavor and spiciness. As it warms, traditional IPA bitterness becomes more pronounced, but very subtle compared to the sweetness and alcohol. Finishes with a bittersweetness and leaves an alcohol coating all over the mouth.  Not really what I was hoping for. The 90 minute is much better and the hops presence here is really minimal.

It's thick and sticky, with a nice amber tone and a fluffy, sticky eggshell head. The smell is of malts and grass and syrupy fruits. The first taste isn't hoppy, not in the bitter sense, rather it's sweet with a little bit of piney(?) hop. God, it's sweet. As it warms, it gets syrupy. Thick and sticky, still drinkable, and still quite sweet. It's not bad, but it's not something to drink much of, there are too many better beers out there. Oversweet and too heavy.

Not surprisingly the aroma is all bitter hops. I didn't know I could taste bitterness with my nose, but on this beer I certainly can.  The flavor is strong of bitter hops and a slight floral taste. Alcohol also permeates the flavors and the beer sits very warm in the stomach. It's also slightly sour and bready with the flavor of a pale malt. Sadly though, the beer is less complex than I would expect. The strong alcohol taste tends to dominate so much that any complexity in the beer is just overpowered. The sweetness is nice, but it does lack the complexity of a great beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,rajendra82,4,"This one came to me thanks to the fine BeerAdvocate mikeys01, as part of HHHIF 1.0 take two. The pour was intense reddish orange with a foamy smallish head capping the body. There was very little latent carbonation to speak of. The aroma was much more subdued than I had anticipated, with resinous hop presence balanced out by sweet malts, and perfumey alcohol. The taste nearly bowled me over with the extreme sweetness of the first sip. The next sips revealed spicy, warm alcohol, and surprisingly very little hop bit, but the initial sweetness continued to overpower all other tastes. The mouthfeel is syrupy and sticky, with a deep burn. The drinkability is a letdown. This is a genre busting drink that is very unlike any other Imperial IPA, or any other beer for that matter. Its closer to a distilled beverage than your average beer, and makes no bones about it.  Update: The second time I tried this I liked it a whole lot more. I have updated the scores to reflect that. This time I rather enjoyed the zingingly spicy hops and the searing alcohol burn. And the sweetness didn't bother me as much as I had remembered.

The next thing i noticed, or rather didn't notice was the alcohol. This changed as the beer warmed it brought out the estery flavors of the alcohol and it became even sweeter, if that's possible. The flavor was wonderful. It was like drinking sweetened hop juice. The mouthfeel was very syrup-like. The drinkability suffered greatly because of how sweet this beer was.  I struggled to finish this beer, even though i enjoyed it immensly. My first mistake was trying to drink the entire twelve ounces in one sitting. My second mistake was trying to drink the entire thing alone.

Mouthfeel is very smooth and coats the mouth in a syrupy effect; medium to full bodied. Tastes quite sweet; again, syrupy. I am quite surprised by this because as an imperial IPA I expected overwhelming dominating hops, but this is not the case. It is very sweet, smooth and drinkable. Perhaps the alcohol will hurt drinkability in greater quantities but I shared a 12 oz bottle with 3 coworkers. Finish is long, syrupy sweet.

There is almost a smell of candied hops here.  The beer is thick and sweet, yet somewhat light and not nearly as alcoholic tasting as I expected. A fair amount of hop flavor manifests itself as apricot, tangerine, pine, wildflower fields, and a bit of bitterness in the finish. This beer is much more enjoyable than I was expecting from such a beast. It certainly could use a bunch more hop flavor (especially given the billing).

And that concludes my paragraph on the positive qualities of this beer...  ...on to the negatives. For one, this beer is sickeningly sweet. I expected a load of full frontal hoppity and instead got corn syrup in my glass. To be honest, this beer hurts my tastebuds so much that I don't even detect any hops at all. 120 Minute even smells too sweet, and that's saying a lot coming from someone who'll try just about any spiced beer, stout, or ""alcopop"" (in the right situation) -- all sweet beverages. For another, this beer is extremely alcoholic, and I was beginning to feel it after only about 3 ounces. That's a feature of mixed drinks which I enjoy, but beers should cut me some slack in the drunkenness department.  All in all, I will never buy this beer again, and if I hadn't paid $10 for the bottle, I would have dumped it out.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Tastes very very sweet, nearly sugary. Probably could have aged 2 years or more. Looks pretty, not much head to it. Heavy alcohol, but not as heavy as you'd expect.

IPA that it became a different creature all together. the body is pretty syrupy and delicately carbonated. i could do with with it being a little lighter. drinkablity is not going to be too high, because first it's like drinking maple syrup, and second an entire bottle is a session in itself. this was pretty good, i'm definitely intrigued.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

We paid $8.99 for it, which seems to be about the going price for this Double IPA at most beer stores. I had my 6 oz sample out of the bottle and served in a wide mouth wine glass. The beer was cold when we bought it, but we let it sit for about 15 minutes to let this warm up a little.  The appearance was a copperish brown. Very minimal head on top. Really nice sticking lacings on the sides.  The smell was malty, fruity and a faint wiff of esters.  This was one complex beer and very difficult to compare to anything else I have tried. The taste has a malt sweetness, classic DFH hops intensity and an apricot/grapefruit/apple blend. It was hoppy, but not as hoppy as I was expecting it would have been. This is well balanced and a very strong beer. I noticed a slight carbination of bubbles that prickle your tongue. We sipped this one and talked about it as we went along. This will warm you up quickly and probably would be great by a fire in the middle of winter.  The idea that this brew is 20% ABV is incredible. I was very surprised at how good the drinkability level is on the beer. Remember, it's all relative and for a 20% monster, this is smooth in comparison to other beers that are somewhat close in strength.  I am really glad that I finally sampled this beer after contemplating buying this on the shelves of some package stores.

The smell is malt accented with hops. I've been waiting to taste this one for a while now as part of my collection to share with my best friend when he came to visit. Here goes. Not what I expected. The hops are hidden behind a syrupy sweet malt character, but that's what you get when the beer is going upwards of 20%ABV. I'm slightly disappointed. The beer is very syrupy and thick to drink. There is almost no carbonation evident. I'm splitting this one with my buddy, and I imagine that we will take a good hour to enjoy our halves.

10099,9086,dmbfrat420beers,3.47,"Presentation - 12 oz. bottle making some pretty lofty claims such as ""the holy grail for hopheads"" - I hope it delivers. Here we go.  Appearance - mostly transparent copper color with a tight white head, very tight indeed. Pretty nice.  Smell - lots of hops obviously, suprisingly little to no alcohol aroma at first, though once it got closer to the nose, alcohol became more apparent. What is there is a decent spicy corrolary to the hops. Also noticed a pretty fruity, grapey aroma as well.   Mouthfeel - suprisingly light bodied, more robust than most IPA's for sure, but not spectacularly so. Slick sweet sort of feel as the beer went on.  Taste - whoa! I has a lot of expectations for this beer, but was still taken aback by its overpowering aroma right as it enters your nose and then the palate dessimating flavor right as it goes in the mouth. Starts with a light carbonation bite and then some sweet malty/fruity taste at the front that gives way a powerful aromatic hop kick which lingers. I didn't find this really bitter at all to be honest, less so than the 60-minute version, but maybe some of the other hop flavors were so overwhelming I couldn't tell. Goes down with some fruity flavors, want to say grape, kind of reminiscient of their Raison D'etre. Alcohol flavor present as well, but not what one would expect for 20% abv, and leaves a warming burn in the throat. Interesting spiciness that hit towards the end, especially as I got farther along in the bottle and it warmed up some. Leaves a refreshingly candy sweet feel on the lips with a fragrant, slick sweet, fruity, hoppy character all over the mouth. Couples a too alcoholic taste with a semi-cloying sweetness that I wished would have smacked me with a bitter resonance.  Drinkability - Had to sip this one the whole way and was well on my way to being drunk by the end. Couldn't possibly drink two bottles in a row, but I'll give it some credit, since there is no other 20% abv beer/wine/liquor that I have tried which could keep me satisfied for over 12 oz.  This beer tore my palate a new one, so to speak. I could use a DFH 60-minute just to rinse my mouth out after this. Won't be having another right away, but definitely want to drink it again in the future. Very hard to rate this one because 1) it's not to style, but that is not really a downfall; 2) it's very interesting, but flawed; and 3) I want to give them credit for their effort and experimentation but have to be honest that this beer didn't win me over.

Rich colour, boardering on amber. Powerful smell, very sweet. This was to be one of the sweetest tasting beers i've ever had. Where's the bitterness? Hop flavor is relaxed, but i was expecting alot more. Seems like any kind of depth in flavor is killed by the alcohol. I can't say I'm not enjoying this beer, because I am. Just underwhelmed. I do very much enjoy the thickness of this beer. IPA? doesn't taste like any ipa i've ever had. Hell, bring on another!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,coasterfreak75,4.79,"The pour was a medium copper red with a half finger of head that quickly dissapated to a light white ring around the edges of the beer, this hung on throughout the glass.  The smell was heavy in malt sweetness, with just a hint of apricot or date. Also hidden in the back of the nose was a hint of alcohol.  The drink hits hard with sweet malt right up front the middle is hop bite, no, a hop oil that coats the tongue. The finish is nothing but alcohol heat.  I'm glad I finally got my hands on this one. I really think this is a good sipping beer. It's not refreshing, nor would it go good with food. Still I think I'll get another bottle and put it up for five or eight years just to see what age does to this one. I really don't see why they call it an IPA, it's more of a barley wine in my opinion.  If you're looking for hops, like the 60 or 90 min. don't look here. The alcohol and malt hide the hops, but ask me again in a few years and maybe I'll change my review.  Thanks to a good friend I just got two bottles of the 2016 release and have changed my rating on this beer. Throughly impressed this time around.

The alcohol and malts completely overpower any of the hops. It may have lots of hops but the balance is definitely not there. Perhaps it would taste better after aging for years as the bottle suggests, but I'd rather spend my money on something that is drinkable now in not in ten years.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Sweet malt and alcohol scents are also in there. Starts very sweet and rich, syrup-like. I thought this was an IPA...ok here we go. An underlying hop explosion that shows the full range of flavors that can come from this herb. Doesn't get overly bitter, but nicely showcases the flavors: citrus and grapefruit, floral, grassy, and earthy. Thins out a bit towards the end, plus a dash of fruitness. Alcohol makes itself known, but doesn't get in the way of this flavorful brew. Full bodied, rich and surprisingly smooth. Drinkablilty is scary, but you had better watch out.

I poured this intimidating brew into a tall schooner glass with reckless abandon, and I was rewarded with a mellow orange, crystal clear brew with a short but thick hoppy head. The beer is full of hop aroma, but unlike other double IPAs, I got a strong whiff of malt and alcohol too. The aroma is hard to place -- I just know it's very different from Alpine or Stone... Not English hops. There's an element of citrus but also other flavors. The beer is terribly sweet. Cloying. There's a liqueur-like thickness and alcohol taste. The hop bitterness is medium high but I don't really get good hop burps, and it isn't puckering, probably because there's so much candy sweetness. Unfortunately, the sweetness sticks all over your mouth hours after you finisht the beer. Oh yeah, that 20% alcohol knocked the crap out of me after about half a glass. sheesh. Surprisingly, the alcohol, though apparent, was not off-putting or astringent, like it was in EKU28.  Overall: lots of hop flavor to ponder, and the alcohol is pretty fun, but it's too sweet to drink often. However, Venom's review said the 750ml was less sweet, so I'd love to share that with say 10 of my closest friends. Also, he suggested this could bear some aging; if it can attenuate the cloying sweetness, this could be one amazing beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

While I still consider a rookie when it comes to tasting craft beer, I decided to enjoy a night of Dogfish Head IPA, first sampling the 60 Minute, then trying the 90 Minute variety, and capping it off with a bottle of the 120 Minute.  It took over an hour for my buddies and me to find the package store that we suspected stocked this beer, and it was worth every second. The beer poured roughly, with very little head, but I was still impressed with its evident character in the liquid. The carbonation did nothing special, but such demonstrative beer behavior was unnecesary, since the beer is truly all about the taste.  Before even tasting the beer, I thoroughly smelled it, enjoying it through and through. When I finally brought myself to drinking it, it was literally pure bliss. The first taste was of slight wood feel; it was almost a dull variety of the 60 and 90 Minute, each which featured a strong nutmeg and wood taste. After swirling it around, the hops came straight through, and I knew I was priveleged to have had the opportunity to taste this beer. While it cost me $6.99 for a 12 oz bottle of it, it was worth every penny.  The worst part of the beer was the last sip, since I knew it meant I would have to wait to enjoy such a great beer again. This is the morning after I had my beer tasting, and I'm still drooling and yearning to taste that sweet nectar at least once more.  Buy this beer if you come across it, and drink it slowly.

Unlike any IPA imaginable. According to the brewer, this beer was a mistake (it should have resulted in a 12% ABV brew). No one knows why this beer turned out the way it did, but I'm glad this is the result. Like drinking nectar. Absolutely deliscious. Hops and malt are balanced to perfection. Alcohol @ 20% is present, but not as much as one would imagine.  Edit: Got an email from DFH on this review.

So I should know better than to log onto BA when all I have in the fridge is my roommate's Bud Light. Also, it was after 2 a.m., so I had no chance of getting any good beer here in Ohio.  I read a few reviews, and found myself craving beer. I thought ANY beer would soothe me, so I tried a Bud Light for the second time in my life. Needless to say, it did nothing for me. So I tried another one. Again, nothing. (Side note: to say Bud Light has as much flavor as seltzer water is an overstatement.) Then I remembered: I have a 12 oz bottle of DFH 120 min in my cabinet! I put it in the freezer and went back to BA.com to check out some reviews of DFH 120. I was surprised to learn that a full 2.4 oz of my bottle was pure alcohol. I hadn't known that when I bought it. I read some reviews, and grew a little apprehensive about trying it; there was a lot of fluctuation in the scores, from a 2.4 to a 5.0.  My bottle says it was brewed in 2003. It's now *early* morning on June 24, 2004.  About 30-40 minutes after putting the beer in my freezer, I took it out and poured it. Perfect temperature. A nice thick head developed. I took a few big sniffs, and it immediately reminded me of the Hitachino Nest New Year's Celebration Ale (2004). Sweet. Spices. Not very much that I could call ""hoppy,"" although I'm still learning what hops are all about.  Taste: Again, very reminiscent of the HN Celebration Ale. Not as much ginger flavor, but sweet, almost too sweet. In a blind taste test, I would classify this as liquor, not beer, but I would be hard pressed to say what kind of liquor this is. Very unique flavor. I still don't taste what I would call ""hops,"" but again, what I know of hops comes from Stone's Ruination IPA. Mouthfeel is that of thick liquor, like carbonated Jagermeister. Drinkability is also that of liquor; I would say 12 oz is way to much to drink in one sitting.  Overall, I would say this is a good once- or twice-a-year beer. As far as IPAs go, I prefer DFH's 60 minute offering. For a strong IPA, I'd say Stone's Ruination is as good as it gets.

Appearance: This beer pours a deep amber body with a foamy yellow/off white head that clumps and fades to a thin lace. The lace sticks in rings as the beer is consumed.  Smell: Rich hops and malt, lightly bitter hop oils.  Taste: Thick, sugary maple syrup feel balanced with huge leafy hops that poke through and dance on the tongue. There is a good tingle of hops in the aftertaste, but it is subdued. If you're expecting a hop-monster, you will be let down. This is instead a wonderfully rich and filling beer, that pushes the envelope in terms of ABV and craftsmanship. The balance between the rich carmel malt, the extra sugar and the bitterness imparted by the hops is something exceptionally done. Light citric esters pull through and are rolled in sugar, keeping the pucker down. I haven't had the 12 ounce version, but in the big bottle, even after only a year, the sweetness doesn't override the entire flavor, instead it helps it along.  Mouthfeel: Decadently rich and thick. Almost like drinking maple syrup, though some small carbonation gives a breath of life to this belly-filler.  Drinkability: I actaully put away the entire bottle in one night. The alcohol is very well masked, and it will sneak up on you. But, I don't really see this as drinkable on a large scale. This is the antithesis of a ""session beer"", but it's worth it to at least say you've tried it. Very good overall.

Really nice citric orange peel aroma. Good hop nose. Not overwhelming. Nice little sweet malt accent on the nose as well. The flavor profile has such a nice balance of sweet malt, bitter hop resin and spicy alcohol. None of those characteristics comes through in an overwhelming way. The drinkability is beyond belief for 20%. DFH does it again in this respect. The sweet qualities are really appealing in the context of this IIPA. I just want to keep sipping, drinking, gulping, etc.... The lingering aftertaste has a little alcohol sting. Hops add some bitterness and pine sap/ hop resin tones.

The beer poured with a dark amber color. A short frothy head appeared only to collapse back from whence it came a few minutes later.  The nose was a scant hoppy, malty wisp.  The flavor was surprisingly non alcohol centered. But still considering that the bottle label said IPA- its but a scant IPA. There bittering units of Hops were there, commingled in a deadly embrace of a strong note of sweet malt. Some notes of caramel and other sweet related permutations of malt were there, but considering the IPA paradigm, the flavors seemed out of place.  The alcohol was not center stage, but none the less could not be ignored, especially 10 minutes after half the bottle went down my gullet.  Finally, I have to consider the 10 bucks a bottle.

Not much surprise given the 20% ABV.  Aroma is (surprise again!) hoppy, and very sweet, with a spicy warm alcohol glow.  Mouthfeel is syrupy thick, and the flavor is cloyingly sweet. Hop resin is sticky, dripping, oozes down the throat like a hop-infused honey. Hints of grape and a huge, spicy alcohol finish.  Interesting? I guess. Drinkable? Not in the least.

Hoppiness is masked in the aroma, but there are hints of pine and orange/grapefruit  Taste: Wow!!! I tend to not like the hugely alcoholic beers (and this one definitely has a lot of alcohol...second most alcohol in a beer I've had--after WWS from 2002). The alcohol is present, but it blends exceptionally well with the malts and hops. Hoppiness is much more apparent in the palate than the nose. The bitterness takes a bit of the bite off the intense sweetness one gets from all the malts in this brew. Citrus is definitely prevalent, with maybe orange being a better description than the typical grapefruit one gets from certain hops--this could be caused by the sweetness.  Mouthfeel: Very very smooth and thick--heavy, heavy body. I wouldn't call it syrupy, because the amount of carbonation present balances syrupiness better than in some other high malt/high alcohol beers I've had.

Hop oils evident in the mouth along with hints of pine sap, fruit, & some extra corn syrup-like flavor.

10099,9086,Boilermaker88,3.72,"A few weeks ago I was searching through the shelves and assorted cases scattered on the floor of one of my favorite local beer stores when I nearly tripped over on unopened case of 120 Minute IPA. My first question to the manager was, ""You got any 90 Minute to go with this?"" Knowing DFH's penchant for monstrous beers, I was hoping to score one of my favorite I2PA's (the 90 Min.) and pass on the 120 Min. Alas, no 90 Minute was found so I grabbed up one of the 120 Minute IPA and moved on. Well, last night I decided the time was right to open up the 12oz bottle and see just how far DFH would go. Emptied into my trusty tasting glass, this brew had a clear nearly copper color topped by a modest white head that left no lace and didn't hang around long. The nose gave me a clue as to how far DFH went. A sniff was rewarded with the aromas of booze, hops, toasty malts and fruits. The most potent of this blend were the alcohol and the hops. The hops were a real nose-tweaker. The taste had all these elements taken to the extreme. The flavors of tropical fruits, candy sugar, and the proverbial butt-load of hops juice had me thinking about what candy-coated hops would taste like. Somwhat surprisingly, the alcohol didn't light me up very much, only leaving a slight warmth down the throat and in my belly. The full, syrupy feel really coated my palate and left a lasting taste long after each swallow. Well, one of those will do it for me! I honestly couldn't imagine having more than one of these at a sitting, such is the nearly overwhelming potency of all the flavors. Still, like I stated at the start of this review, gimme the 90 Minute over this one any day.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

10099,9086,GuinnessSmurf,4.57,"The Dogfish Head 120 minute - behold, I too have witnessed it in all it's majesty. I had heard all the legends about this brew, but I felt that would never come across one. In truth, some beers must be sought after, and this is one of them. I discovered this beer with a few other Dogfish Head brews, nestled back on the shelf. I could see it glowing from the end of the isle. It hopped right in my shopping cart.  Later, I had it hop into my glass. The pour came bearing tons of fine bubbles that headed up on top of an attractive golden/blonde beer. The head diminishes at a very medium rate - a very comfortable rate. Parts of it still stuck to my glass at the end of the beer.  This is a very aromatic beer. With all the talk of hops, it should be mentioned that this beer does not try to enrage the senses with hop-overkill. The smell is very sweet, with perfumes and citrus smells. Of course, those scents accompany some hop notes as well.  This is one of those tastes that really grows. From the opening sip to about 3 minutes after you swallow, the beer will entertain every part of your tongue and mouth. It comes on strong at first - as if to let you know, ""Yes, this is a hop craft, and we aren't afraid to let the hops shine."" I have theorized that this opening blast of bitter/sweet hops is to mask the high ABV - which I never noticed during the whole beer. The taste gradually sweetens up in your mouth...going through stages that remind me of grapefruit and ending in what I could only pinpoint as an Orange Julius.  This is one smooth, long lasting flavored beer - and it goes down way too easy. I wish they were a little cheaper...on the drinkability scale, I could have had this beer all night...and even had one this morning with breakfast.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,CBFanWish,4.5,"Behold, the infamous Dogfish Head 120 minute IPA. The mighty King of the Pale Ale. As we all love to talk about our big beers, there is one that shall always be mentioned as the biggest, the hoppiest, and the all around scarriest. This is it. I poured mine into a pilsner glass, just because I don't want to waste anything. The colour, not quite what I expected from a real live monster, was a hazy golden amber. The head was moderate and released a ton of fantastic aromas. Sweet lemon with a warming alcohol nose. The taste was super sweet with a giant citric flavor as well. The alcohol bit was more of a warming than anything. It was actually quite nice. This is something you can get lost in. It doesn't seem like such a big beer, but it is.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,ngandhi,4.45,"Vintage 2003. 12 oz.  You can't make an Imperial IPA and just ignore hops. And, if you focus on hops, it can't just be all about the surprising citric and floral flavors you can extract from them; you've got to get bitter. And, by anyone's standards, 120 IBUS -- a practically impossible measure of bitterness to reach on a homebrew level -- is an atomic lupulin bomb. Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA, at 120 IBUs and 20% alcohol by volume, drinks like a session IPA and does everything a beer can.  The overwhelming sweetness in this oh so young beer balances out the high alcohol and intimidating bitterness (take, for example, Stone Ruination which, at the same IBUs, I twice poured down the drain). Yes, it is much like a barleywine or old ale with so much malty sweetness and notes of vin santo and sauternes, but the unctous extract serves only to make this beer palateable and nothing else. The nose is of raw, grassy hops tinged with alcohol and the finish is as leafy as any IPA. Without so much sweetness, we may likely be struggling to even swallow this beer.  Nectarous with so much residual sugar yet flavored predominantly by the hops, I think of this as I think of a good lemonade -- it has to be sweet to be drinkable, but real lemonade still tastes as fresh as the oils from the rind. Sure, I could do with a bit less sugar, but it gives it structure which is something a 20% alcohol beer needs to avoid tasting distillate. I've had several beers with half the alcohol that haven't done even half the job of masking their volatility.  As I have said before, this ""Minute"" hopping has done well to blur the lines between bitterness and flavor when it comes to hops. And though some might rightfully prefer the taxing bitterness of brews like Ruination, Dogfish Head shows off what American IPAs have always been great at showing off and that is the glory of the hop in all its forms.  A focus on bitterness simplifies the bud by blowing off all its flavor, while aggressive dry-hopping without much bitterness rarely makes more than a perfumey hop tea. In this beer, however, nothing is compromised.  Indeed, 120 Minute IPA is everything a single brewer can possibly achieve. Yet I suspect this is only the beginning for Dogfish Head. It is to us what Thomas Hardy Ale was to the Brits (and now is once again). The joy of malt. The joy of hops. The joy of one man and his glass.  Relax, relax. ng",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Afterburner,5,"Appearance: Copper-orange, with no head or lacework. Looks like my latest batch of homebrew in that respect.  Smell: Fantastic bouquet. The hops are, oddly, not as assertively floral as I would have anticipated. But they're definitely present in a piney, citrusy way. Strong malt aroma as well. Very sweet, almost like brownie dough. Rum and butter notes as well. Quite possibly one of the best *smelling* beers I've ever had.  Taste: Oh my freakin' gawd. Absolutely fantastic flavor. I think I have a new favorite beer. Sweet, malty beginning, very much like a barleywine. Hints of molasses and toffee in the foreground. Mid-palate sees an explosion of ale fruity-ness, with peaches, currants, and chocolate. The finish lingers with buttery rum notes, also some vanilla. The alcohol is well-hidden and doesn't leave a heavy burn.  Mouthfeel: Outstanding. Very small-bead carbonation. Just enough carbonation to give it texture and make it interesting.  Drinkability: This beer is dangerously, deceptively drinkable. It doesn't feel at all like a 40 proof beer. You won't be drinking more than two or MAYBE three of these in a sitting, but individually they drink like lesser beers. You'll have it drained before you know it, and it'll catch up with you.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,vurt,3.41,"appearance: A gorgeous orange-amber, almost perfectly clear but for a slight suggestion of haze (which I attribute to its viscosity rather than anything in suspension). Not much head to speak of from the pour, but a dense, creamy head is generated by swirling the glass. The liquid coats the glass and leaves behind a sticky archipelago of foam. Tiny bubbles rise from the bottom of the Piraat tulip I'm sampling this brew from.  smell: Easily my least favorite aspect of this massive brew, sorry to say. There's sweet rolls (with icing), and orange candy slices, and the expected DFH nuttiness, and something meaty and gravy-like, and enough alcohol to curl my nose hairs...and an earthiness that brings both ""wet cardboard"" and ""Fuggles aftertaste"" to mind. As a West-coast double IPA veteran of long standing, I was expecting a heady and bludgeoning hop aroma (which probably just means that my expectations were way off base).  taste and mouthfeel: Sweetness first and foremost, redolent of sweet rolls and marzipan, and when the alcohol kicks in the flavor morphs into something like a Grand Marnier with a bit less orange. Then the hops break in (have mercy!) like a brass section recorded in a parking garage-- rolling, booming, loud as hell, but blurry and indistinct. The bitterness is much more floral than the nose led me to believe. Mouthfeel is full, oily, and luxurious, as befits flavors this huge. The finish lasts forever with the bitter winning out over the sweet, though the lingering flavor is of roasted nuts (pine, filbert, brazil).  drinkability: Too much of everything leaves my palate tingling and saturated. This is a beer I might crave in another 6 months or so, but I can't imagine having more than one in an evening. Or a week. I'll break one out of my stash in another year or so, to see how it's aging. If it dries out, I could see bumping the drinkability score up to 3 or maybe even 3.5.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

I wasn't crazy about the aroma. Not sure if it was my glass or something but it smelled metallic, also sweet and malty, abit boozey, not too hoppy somehow. It tasted wonderful, since I am more of a malt person than a hop person, and this was very malty. I don't know how DFH does it. And at 20%abv, my god it didn't taste like it. Mouthfeel was a bit thick but it worked, and drinkability, well yes, it was very drinkable. Again, it kicked my ass with its no hint of alcohol in there!

No head at first, so I did some ""tall-thin pouring"" (beer bottle one foot over the glass, pouring a stream); this resulted in the kind of roiling head formation one sees in a vigorously poured imperial stout. Head is almost tan, but too white to deserve the label. Very resilient, with foam that sticks to the glass like insulation.  Aroma is like a 60-Minute IPA that's gone off its meds.  A blast of hops juice. Mouthfeel is tremendously thick and chewy, slick and foamy.  Taste? OK, DFH, you have finally gone over the top. You are one of my top-tier breweries, and your 60-minute IPA is always welcome in my fridge (there's a six-pack in there right now). But, I could not drink your 120 Minute IPA. This is just too much. This is at least 30 minutes too much hopping. In fact, the entire beer is too much of everything.

Taste: Once again the aroma lends hints to the taste. Wonderfully hoppy without tongue numbing bitterness, however like the nose alcohol and a nearly sickening sweetness mar this near perfection of hops.

10099,9086,bditty187,3.45,"Slightly hazy, bronzy-brown in hue, I couldnt get much of a head to form; all I managed was a wobbly foamy collar around the edges of my glass. There was no subsequent lacing. The appearance is a little dull, if not disappointing. I cant say the bouquet is telling me much, there is a big malty-alcohol sweetness and the hops are noticeable but hollow, vague flowery notes. The smells are more intriguing than inviting; regardless I took a sip. My first swallow was so sweet! Was I drinking a solution of sucrose, Saccharin, Aspartame, Cyclamate, and Acesulfame K? Yes, it was that sweet. It took a little work before I noticed the hops; it never even approached a balanced point. An IPA? Pure BS. Frankly it never became that tasty either, yes it was good but Im not sure why this beer is in existence. DFH likes to push the envelope and experiment but what is the deal with 120? The maltiness is not complex enough to be a barleywine and the hops are too drowned to be an IPA. The brewers did a topnotch job at hiding the massive alcohol content in the taste; the effects of the alcohol are noticed elsewhere (i.e. the brain) but the cloying sweetness is just too off-putting. It is full bodied, thick and unyielding; the minimal carbonation makes the mouthfeel feel a bit sluggish. This is a one-try beer for me, I always wanted to try it and I am very happy I did.

The taste is great. Slightly unbalanced and quite alcoholic, but not in a bad way. In fact, I was surprised by how much I liked the taste. The bottle I had was brewed recently, so perhaps in a few years (120 Minute IPA will be the drink of choice for all discriminating cockroaches once we're done with these dark ages) the taste will sort itself out a bit more.  The mouthfeel, or rather the finish, is what really excited me. The is beer lingers longer than any I have ever drank. In fact, the warm alcohol slides down your throat slower than bourbon.

Hops are promised on the label (they are both depicted in art form and mentioned in the text) but this beer is not about tasting extreme amounts of hops. As a homebrewer, I know that truckloads of hops had to be added to this beer in order to balance all the malt, but this does not taste like other double or Imperial IPAs that I have sampled. Far from it actually. That said, Dogfish Head 120 is quite different and I do like how the hops sort of surface here and there in this beer. They appear to be sort of in the shadows. Faint whisps of hop aroma (mostly a grassy aroma) combined with caramlized sugar. The malt aroma is so strong strong it almost reminds me of sniffing a cognac. The color of this beer is a light copper to my surprise it pours with a decent amount of carbonation with a soft white head of foam. The first flavors that I detect remind of a syrupy sherry more than any beer, especially and IPA. A bit grapefruitiness is detected as the beer warms up and a hop bitterness also emerges. The finish is otherwise dry and grows more bitter as the beer warms up. I liked this beer, and I loved the interplay between the massive amount of hops and malt, but I did not find this too be the extremely hoppy beer that the label and the hype seems to suggest. This is not an Imperial or Double IPA (this is reflected in some of my marks above), but it succeeds in pushing the envelope of strong beer, and I think it succeeds in being a very unsual beer which is precisely what Dogfish Head beers are good at being.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

I was surprised with the mellow fruity fragrance with a hint of floral hops. The taste blew me away with the first sip. It almost tastes like concentrated fruit cocktail... very sweet, tart and syrup-like with warming alcohol. The tartness reminds me of grapefruit, and the aftertaste lingers and the hops start to show themselves. The taste is somewhat overpowering. It is hard to pinpoint the mouthfeel of this beer with its extreme taste, but it is very smooth feeling once you get past the shock of the taste. The alcohol is covered up well by the sweet candy-like character, but you definatley know its there with its warmth and the buzz it gives you. This is not a session beer at all. Unless you soley pick a session beer on the basis of alcohol. This is a very slow drinking beer with its intense sweetness, and probably should be drank in about 4 or 5 ounce servings.

In the flavor, again, I was expecting a hop bomb. Instead, it was very sweet, perhaps cloyingly so. It did have some hop bitterness, but not enough to balance out the overwhelming sweetness.

Taste: Sugary sweet, almost meadlike in both intensity and in general flavor profile. Floral nectar and honey tastes. Peachy fruitiness.

I also detected hints of what tasted like pineapple? Crazy! This is an extreme beer. Not for the faint of heart, very exaggerated flavors in every way. Mouthfeel was surprisingly good, although I swear I could feel the alcohol evaporating off my lips. I gave the drinkability a high rating only because it went down waaaay smoother than I expected.

10099,9086,mkobes,4.43,"Great beer. Really strong almost like barleywine. Subtle in alcohol, not noticable. But be careful it sure is there. I think its 20%. Good winter beer, really warms you up.

10099,9086,jtfest,4.1,"'03 bottling. This brew looks innocent enough. Pours a clear amber with virtually no head. The aroma? Alcohol. I felt my nose hairs singe and my eyes blurred. There may have been some other scents in there as well, but they were lost after the damage to my mucous membranes. The funny thing was how non-prevalent the alcohol was in the taste. It was sweet and fruity with apricot tones -- dangerously pleasant, in fact, considering the ABV. I didn't even detect bitterness or alcohol in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel was substantial, syrupy, and like chewing on moist dried fruit. I was torn on the drinkability rating -- no way I could pound these back, but it went down pretty smoothly. I'm going to cellar a few of these ...",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Smells of alcohol, fruit, alcohol, apricots, alcohol, peaches, etc.  Taste is like a blend of braggot and cyser so an apple honey beer. The apple and fruit flavors play heavy just floating on top of that alcohol monster lingering beneath.  The mouthfeel is great, heavy, and full.  Drinkability is low around sippability but not for lack of flavor rather just too heavy.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Shiredave,3.41,"12oz bottle, notch between ""03 and '04 for bottling date. Wow. Pours a deep, honey gold color. Gooey, bright white head is very dense and recedes quickly leaving spatters of lace behind. Carbonation slowly streams up, struggling thru the oily viscocity. Very yeasty aroma at first which seems to blow off with a few swirls and is replaced by a sharply alcoholic blast of floral hop. First rush of flavor is intensly citrus- grapefruit concentrate and mandarin oranage mixed with big dose of alcohol that cleans the sinuses. Ultra sweet alcohol and more apricot like flavors move in followed by scorching pepper hop and flaming alcohol to finish it out. Very full bodied and heavy on the tongue. Just too much going on to savor - flavors too intense. Way over the top and difficult to drink for me. So much alcohol is distracting and not really enjoyable. Almost sickeningly sweet , massive hop flavors and over the top alcohol all sound like things I might enjoy but doesnt really work for me here. Hard for me to finish 12oz. I should have saved this bottle and shared it w/ 2 or 3 others. Sipping 3-4 oz and saying "" Holy shit!"" w/ friends is the way to go w/ this beer.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,JMH_,3.97,"i have to admit that this one frightened me a bit, as it's abv is way higher than anything i've sampled in the past. i was anticipating the alcohol flavour to be just overpowering. thankfully, it was not. this one pours a nice amber colour with a tiny white head that has decent lacing effects. it smells hoppy as hell. wow. fruit, bread and earth notes can also be detected here. the taste is definitely less hoppy than the smell and more mild than expected for the 120. it is actually very fruity with a tropical/citrus flavouring to it. alcohol is apparent throughout but nicely intermingled with the rest of the flavours here. there is a bit of a tart, dry hop finish. different, but good. i'd sample this one again, but it's just too strong to throw back (and by throw back i mean take 1.5 - 2 hours to drink it, like i did) on a regular basis.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

It tastes like a cross between mead with its honey alcohol warmth and an IPA. Rich, thick and sweet  maybe a bit too sweet or too young. Definite tastes of melon, and raisins. It tastes like an ice wine or a good desert wine.

The color is brilliantly clear gold with reddish-amber highlights when held to the light. Sticking my sniffer into the glass reveals aromas of grapefruit, some tropical fruitiness, small amounts of fusel alcohols. I'm sensing a small amount of bubblegummy notes here too. Taste is ultra sweet, damn near cloying sugary sweetness, massive tropical fruitiness that coats the mouth, substantial hoppiness....not nearly as bitter as you'd expect, and a gargantuan warming alcohol that warms throat, chest and stomach. Midtaste I'm getting residual sugariness for the malt that lasts and lasts, alcohol vapors that fill the roof of my mouth and damn near fill my sinuses, mixed with the hoppiness. Finishes long, lush and bold. Don't quite know what to make of all the sweetness as it masks alot of the subtleties contained within, but I'm glad I got to try this monsterous ale.

10099,9086,jlervine,4.09,"Poured into a wine glass a deep amber-orange with a white head that put up little fight. Lace receded to the edge of the glass. Smell is hops, hops, and more hops. Citrus hops, herbal hops, piney hops. Caramel malts seem to support them. The taste is other-worldly. You start with a head on collision of hops, then a strikingly surprising sweetness paired with loads of alcohol notes. It slightly burns, slightly numbs, and slightly dries out the mouth, making you even more succeptable to the next sip. You taste oranges, rum, plums, caramel, maple syrup, it's all briefly tossed in. The mouthfeel is such that you can't drink this one too quickly. It is almost like a port in that regard - yeah, it tastes really really good, but there is a bit of apprehension involved with taking that next sip. You really want to spread this one out.  And it indeed, as another reviewer mentioned a possibility of, goes fantastically well with pancakes. Seriously.

10099,9086,goose114,4.22,"This is, in my opinion, a hard beer to review. Let me say up front that I'm quite fond of it, but I don't think it's ""the holy grail for hopheads.""  This beer pours a dark amber color, darker than I'd expect for an IIPA. Very thin head that dissipates, but what were you expecting with 20% alchohol? Considering the minimal head, the beer leaves a generous amount of lacing in its wake.  Smells wonderful, just doesn't smell hoppy to me. This is far and away the sweetest smelling IIPA I've encountered. Almost smells fruity, but I like it. A lot.  Taste follows the smell here, sweet with some slight alcohol burn and just a slight hint that there are hops here. Again, overtones of fruit, but not the citrus taste you expect from an IPA. Very delicate and tasty. The alcohol is beautifully masked, with just a hint of burn on your tongue, and it creeps up on you in a hurry. The aftertaste is even sweeter.  I want to say medium bodied in the mouth, but it's probably closer to heavy. But not Imperial Stout heavy. Feels almost perfect to me. Sits delectably on the tongue and rolls down the throat with ease.  I want another, but the alcohol content won't allow it. This stuff has potential to hurt you, especially in the larger bottle. Honestly, even 12 ounces seems like too much for a single sitting, but damn, it's tasty. The last swallow is as delicious as the first.  My only complaint is that this tastes *nothing* like any other double/imperial IPA I've tasted. It's overpoweringly sweet. If you're looking for the height of bitterness, it's not to be found here. This beer baffles me, and it comes back to the bit on the label claiming to be ""the holy grail for hopheads,"" which this is definitely not. That doesn't stop it from being delicious though, so seek out and try this unique brew.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,tavernjef,3.93,"A slight chill haze yellowy-orange color, very thin white head barely lasts, but not expected really much there with the 20%. Fairly good amounts of delicately thin lacing though. Not much aroma wise, mostly some very soft butterscotch-like warmth in alcohol, seemingly malty sweet mostly with light touches of waxy fresh hops. Taste is quite warm, moderate malty sweetness mostly, a bit complex yet mild, subdued fruityness of melons and a few darkened qualities with yellow raisin and fig. Some toffee and butterscotch meld together with a schnapps-like boozy warmth. Ends with a little extra kick of warmth, somewhat port-like and/or even vinous in character. Feel is well rounded, smooth, clean, and pretty full with a little burn of booze nearer the end and has some nice lingering sweetened mixtures that come through late in the finish...ah yes more malts...and more warmth. This is a major sipper and a great warmer-upper. I can see how some would be put off by its unusual presense and unexpected character, I went in with an open mind not trying to judge it from what I knew about the long hopping process this brew has. I was either expecting something overly hoppy or heavy malted, its the later, more like a sweeter aged barleywine then anything. Quite nice.

10099,9086,lampkins,2.66,"Before I offer a review of this brew I must confess that I have been on a mission for the last 1/2 year to get a couple of 750ml's of this stuff. And thanks to a fellow BA I was able to score 2 bottles of the IPA and like the new Star Wars Trilogy I find myself dissapointed with the beer hoping that it will only get better.  The beer poured a thick golden yellow with almost no head to speak off. The aroma of the beer was almost pungent and I could really smell the alcohol. Has this beer on New Years Day and before I opened it I let it stand @ room temp from the fridge for about 30 minutes. Tasted it burned my mouth and reminded me of a strong liquor ala gin. Waited anothter 30 minutes and another, the taste did not change and I hate to admit it, but I did not finish the beer. I am hoping that the beer will get better with age and will open the other 750 ml a year from now. I am crossing my fingers and hoping that it will get better.

10099,9086,Crosling,4.58,"The 120....  Hazy dirty orange in color with a thick and dense head. Sticky lacing clings to the glass. A pretty solid looking ale.  Not the most pleasant aroma. Suprisingly weak for what i was expecting. Old lemons, apricot, alcohol, tropical juice and grapefruit were easy to inhale.  Like a BIG sweet barley wine. Thick and warming mouthfeel. Felt very heavy in the mouth and certainly not for the timid. I cannot stress enough how well the alcohol is hidden. This can sneek up on you...fast! If I were to have guessed without knowing the ABV beforehand I would have said 11-12%. Not as hoppy as I had it built up to be but certainly really fucking tasty.  WOW!",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Stopper,3.77,"This brew pours a translucent orange with touches of yellow, topped with a thin whitish head. The aroma is somewhat hoppy, but definitely not abrasively so, and has a notable sweet aroma to match it. The mouthfeel is very smooth and sticky, and the initial taste is a chewy sweetness. The alcohol is definitely noticeable in the taste, but not as much so as I would expect if this is really 20%ABV. There is far less hop bitterness or character throughout than I expected, though a bit of dry feeling and bitterness come in the finish. This, however, has a very tough time breaking through the thick coat of sweetness left on the tongue.  The alcohol presence combined with the sweetness makes this remind me quite a bit of an eisbock. The hops were nearly unnoticeable compared to what I expected from dogfish head IPA, especially after having tried the other X-minute beers from this brewery. The sweetness is a bit much and the alcohol is packing a punch. I think I could like this more next time if I approach it with more accurate expectations -- I definitely would share this with someone as a sipping dessert beer, and not drink it where I'd normally have an IPA. This doesn't seem anything like an IPA to me, and not really even a double IPA. But I doubt it fits any style's definition very well. I think this one could survive a very long time in my basement, and go through a lot of beneficial growth there. And it's definitely good enough to entice me to buy a few more bottles for that purpose.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Brent,2.08,"A prime example of the adage that you can have too much of a good thing. Poured a rather odd, hazy golden - it almost had a thick, syrupy appearance. The flavor was an unusual syrupy sweet hoppyness, like a mutant barleywine. A brutal bittersweetness marked the finish, one that was simply hard to get down. No depth to the flavor, just hops boiled in simple syrup. The 60 and 90 Minute IPA's are good - this was, without a doubt, pushing the envelope too far.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,FranklinPCombs,2.75,"Rightfully, this shouldn't be reviewed as an IPA, but rather as an experimental beer. It pours a light amber with little head an lace, receding to a patchy foam. The smell is syrupy, with an understandably high concentration of hops, and a slight hint of malts and citrus. The taste of this beer is, as a beer, unpleasant to say the least. It is far to sweet, again with the syrupy taste with banana and vanilla, and piny hops. There are minimal tastes of malt and the aftertaste is very sweet. There is a fair amount of carbonation, but the beer feels very thick, almost like congnac. At 20% ABV, this is definately a sipping drink, not to be drinken like a beer. Its far too sweet also to be drinken like a regular beer. Despite its low ratings as a beer, I still find it absolutely amazing that this could come from just water, malt and hops.

THe head is primarily small tightly packed bubbles but some larger bubbles mixed in as well. Great retention as the head doesnt seem to be fading at all. The aroma is lightly hoppy with a mixture of fruits present, mostly pears and also hints of alcohol scents as well. First sip reveals light carbonation and a fairly thick mouthfeel, definitely thicker than I expected. almost syrupy, but in a good way. The flavor is rather crisp up front with some hop flavors, while the middle transitions to a malty sweetness and is actually almost candy like, finally the finish reveals the alcohol that I know is in there. There is also an earthy flavor in my mouth after the swallow. Some fruity flavors as well again pears but maybe apples now too. This beer is very smooth considering it is 20%.

10099,9086,merlin48,4.06,"12 oz bottle, with my 2003 birthday(April) printed on the label. Pours a clear honey amber. Not much of a head, even with an aggressive pour. Small beige head quickly fades. Exceptional nose, but difficult to describe with all that's there. Hay, pine, citrus, rum-soaked fruits, and a lot more. Mouthfeel is fascinating! Like a giant orange pez that instantly dissolves in your mouth. What a way cool feeling. Taste begins with caramel syrup, followed by candied fruits(you name the fruit, it's there)...eventually some hops kick in. Very interesting brew here. Bit of a syrupy aftertaste and high abv detract from drinkability.  Overall, this one is difficult to review. An IPA? I don't think so. 120 minute? Yep! Took me 120 minutes to finish. Yee-Haw! This one bottle has sent me for a loop. How could anybody drink two of these and still walk straight? This was, by far, the most interesting ""beer"" I've ever sampled. I compliment the folks at Dogfish Head for pushing the envelope with this brew. I'm going to cellar a couple bottles of these for awhile.

10099,9086,Edwin,3.98,"Served in a 12-ounce bottle.  Appearance: Pours out a beautiful amber/gold color. A small amount of head at first that disappears quickly. Looks like a thing of beauty in my Troeg's Mad Elf glass.  Smell: Citrus, hops and an alcohol nose throughout. A bit strong on the nose. It gives you every indication that there is a lot included in the recipie.  Taste: Not at all what I was expecting. Sweet...very sweet. Hoppiness and an almost candy-like flavor. Fruit, honey, and hops plow over your tongue. Also...the alcohol is very noticeable. Gives a sweet burn in the throat, but not like drinking Souther Comfort. This is more of a mild warmth that is quite welcome after a few sips.  Mouthfeel: Smooth, with low carbonation and a slight alcohol burn that will redden the cheeks.  Drinkability: Very drinkable for a single tasting. Anyone who can possibly drink 6 of these in a sitting deserves a trophy. The sweetness is very potent and the alcohol is very high.  Overall: I commend Dogfish on this complex sampling. It looks great, smells great, and even tastes great. The complexity of it is astounding. But it is meant for having one and one only. I reccommend the 60 or 90-minute for enjoying hops more.

10099,9086,GreenWBush,3.32,"Finally I sit down to write the review on a beer i've been craving for months. I am a hop-head, and I thought this beer would be the ""holy grail"" it proclaims to be. We'll see about that.  I have to admit, I had to wrestle with the 750 mL bottle to get the damn thing to open. After a good five minutes, I won the battle - but with the cork came a huge glass chunk from the rim of the bottle that shot across the room. Warning signs abound! Beware!  The beer pours out a very unassuming copper color. It didn't have the thick, foamy look that most equally strong beers have - in fact, it looks almost identical to the 60 minute IPA. The beer bubbled up into a small head that disappeared immediately and little lacing at all. After finishing a snifter's worth, I could've sworn that the lacing looked like hebrew characters. Goes to show that the beer really had me under its power.  The beer has a silky mouthfeel that greets you. The beer is amazingly sweet and complex, with layers and layers of flavors attacking you from every direction. I encountered maple syrup, honey, bubblegum, rock candy, with the floral hops in there somewhere. They are just icicles in the ocean in this brew, unfortunately.  The beer isn't weighted with anything but sweets. Towards the end, I did happen to catch slight suggestions of lowland scotch whisky and apple cider. With that being said, the beer is not at all medicinal or overpowering with its alcohol taste. Everything is blended quite well.  This is one rich ass beer. At times, it will convince you that it has a normal consistency, and then out of nowhere you will be swarmed with too many tastes for you palate to deal with.  I knew what I was getting into with this beer - it truly is not an IPA. The only thing that gave me the hint of hops was the dry feeling left in my palate after about two glasses. Another unfortunate side effect of the beer is the Diet-Pepsi taste you are left with.  Basically a beer you've got to try to believe. But for the sake of your pocketbook, split it with four people just to get the taste and save your money for superior Dogfish Head beers.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Whoa Nellie! Nose big time hop floral, sweet malt, fusel alcohol, just from the nose you know this is going to be one bad assed beer. Start is devastatingly sweet with a thick malt profile and the top all rich and full in its feel to the palate. Finish is lenient in its acidity, the hops robust and delightful in their bite, but the alcohol rules the day, aftertaste somewhat alcohol bitter, vinous and desert dry with the hops, sweetness and alcohol all lingering on to the very end, what a Hoot, I thank my good buddy , The_Tsunami for this bottle.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

The alcohol and a strangely strong aroma also come from the beer. The taste is far from what I was expecting. It starts out extremely sweet/tart then smoothes out and leaves the taste of many fruits (and alcohol) in your mouth. The flavor is incredibly complex and enjoyable after you become accustomed to it.

10099,9086,jahred,4.04,"Wow. I can recall not too long ago when 120 Minute IPA was my favorite beer. My friend and I used to buy 25 oz. bottles of the stuff, slowly drink it over the course of an evening (get quite tipsy in the process), and think we were in heaven.  It's been awhile since I've gone back to the beer and actually tried to review it - I recently bought 4 bottles (2003 vintage), and left 2 in the closet to age.  Pours a dark amber amber color with little head, which quickly disappeared. Smells pleasantly of pine, with hints of citrus/lemon. Taste? WOW... it's as thick and complex as I remember, and super sweet, too. The hoppy taste is there, but it's pretty much the exact opposite of bitter. I taste caramel at first, then sweet maltys, and then some hops , with an orangey-hoppy aftertaste (but still little-to-no bitterness). My lips taste of caramel and sweet oranges!  As it warms, I get a bit more of a grassy, hoppy flavor, more caramel, and a slight taste of apples (very nice!) that I never noticed before. The alcohol is very present (perhaps too much so), but for a 20 % ABV beer, I can't complain. Unfortunately, it's a little wild, and the flavors don't mix as well as I remember them (because of my refined tastes as I continue to drink beer? or a different vintage? i don't know ...)  This beer is amazing - and not your standard IPA. It's just a little tooo sweet and all over the place right now.

You can sense malt in the background behind the hop aromas. As it warms a huge alcohol aroma develops which overwhelms the senses. The flavor is cloyingly sweet but contains grapefruit and citrus which are well balanced. In 10-15 seconds after sipping the sweetness dissapates into an infectious dryness which evolves into and alcohol warmth that lasts. The balance is well done once the cloying sweetness is gone.  It would be difficult to consume much of this.

Aroma is entirely of hops, but a bit sweet with juicy grapefruit notes. The palate is at once sweet with a definite warming sensation. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy. The start is sweet with a hint of dark fruits and pineapple syrup. The hops come in quickly with some slight grapefruit notes, but are not as sharp as I would expect. Some acidity from the hops sticks in the mouth past the finish, but even the hoppy finish it is still overly sweet. I really felt the alcohol in this one go straight to my head by the end of the glass. I couldnt image drinking more then one. This brew is a bit too sweet for my palate especially when I was expecting a high octane IPA. The sweetness and alcohol degrade the drinkability, and make it seem more like an IPA/barley wine.

The smell is rather sweet, with the hard to pinpoint characteristic Dogfish Head smell. Although the smell of hops is there, it doesn't qualify as the ""holy grail for hopheads"" by any stretch of the imagination.  The taste is ripe fruit with just a trace of hop bitterness. A bigger dose of hops probably would have made things work a bit better. It definitely doesn't smell or taste like a 20% abv beer; the alcohol is warming and a bit mouth-numbing but not overwhelming. The mouthfeel is delightfully creamy. What's strange is seeing the ""Other IPAs"" listed at the side of the web page with the likes of Hop Devil. It doesn't taste like any IPA I've ever tried.

Taste: Very thick body. Candy sugar with hops. Notes of brown sugar, blackstrap molasses, and caramelized apples. Overly sweet, not very balanced. Maybe it needs 200 IBU's?

Sweet, finnicky, bizarre, a bit overdone. Say what you will. It's probably all true.  But this is a hell of a beer with some real paradoxical complexities and simplicities that help you forget you're talking about a beer that weighs in at 20%.  A recommendation for the folks at DFH: Put a Surgeon General-style warning on the label: ""Share with friends."" Who the hell put this in such a huge bottle?",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,putnam,4.37,"Bright sticky hop fragrance. No grapefruit, though plenty of cool herbs like chervil, parsley and basil...candied, spiced lemon peel in the background. There is a suggestion of honey and caramel on the nose which becomes more dominant on the palate. Very sweet, with flavors of pineapple upside-down cake...concentrate. I was just beginning to think this beer was way over the top (narcissistic, attention-grabbing) when a costumed woman from the next table offered us chocolate chip cookies. This is dessert beer. Drink it with cakes, cookies, buttered, flamed fruit and balance will be restored. Really beautiful in this context. Somewhat awkward (and oversized at 750ml) alone.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,RoyalT,4.14,"Appearance  Scarily devoid of any head to speak of. The body is florescent orange and very clear.  Smell  Strong, floral hops with a big orange compliment. Theres some balancing malt as well making for a well-rounded aroma.  The sweetness is primarily tropical fruit. Theres a huge pineapple and orange melon aroma as well as smashed cocktail cherries. The malt is kind of bready and very solid. I swear this smells like a good Abbey Tripel.  Taste  This was rich and chewy like you wouldnt believe. The orange malt flavor is big here, read Abbey Tripel again, with huge alcohol notes. The hops are lost in the madness.  The fruits from the nose are monstrous; almost overpowering. Mixed with the strong alcohol its like an Abbey Tripel cocktail. This lacks the subtle notes of the equally powerful World Wide Stout. This ale shamelessly flaunts its high ABV and style deviation.  Mouthfeel  No carbonation and somewhat smooth, all things considered. This ale is a behemoth in the mouth. Dont drink this with a raw cut in the oral cavity. You could use this stuff to numb the gums for a root canal. The alcohol is overpowering in the mouth, which is too bad because there are some good flavors in here that get lost in the booze.  Drinkability  I wouldnt recommend driving cross-country and sucking down a few of these bad boys. You have to take it real easy with this batch. I did my taste and gave the rest to the wife to finish.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,AtLagerHeads,3.35,"A bit over the top in most categories, this beer is less an IPA and more a barleywine in taste. Rather than belabor its high ABV let's just say that the body feel is a bit too thick and syrupy, the sweetness not balanced too well by the hops, and its drinkability very limited by all of these factors. I'll try again at some point to see if my sense of this beer changes.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

In fact, the smell was very fruity and citrus'y' with a nice warming effect on the nostrils from the alcohol. My hopes were high at this point. Mouthfeel was full and thick...again, not bad. Unfortuneately, that is where the average/good qualities of this beer ended for me. It tasted like a World Wide Light! Very malty and syrupy tasting. The somewhat pleasant fruity smell did not transfer to the taste. Drinkability, forget it. My bud and I split the 750ml, and were ready to be done with it before our glasses were even half empty. Curiosity of this beer's ""gimmick"" persuaded me to purchase it...and at $20, it was a big mistake.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,taez555,3.38,"12oz bottle  This beer poured a thick creamy white finger sized head with a surprisingly clear amber red/orange body.  The nose was very fruity. Citrus, lemons, limes, some sharp pepper, round malt, yeast. A nice big maltyness. Not as much of a hop presence at the name would suggest, but it was definitely there.  The taste was a big thick doughy malt. Full bodied, but very easy drinking. A sugary sweet caramel malt taste. A firm alcohol warmth. Tight black pepper, citrus hop. An even bitterness that comes out more as it warms. but the sugary sweet malt really dominates over the hop in this beer. This beer does not taste 20% at all.  It took me over an hour to finish this beer and it really took on a different character as it warmed. The hops came out a bit more, but still.. the sweet malt dominates over the hop.  I'd really be interested in aging this beer a few years. I could see the sweetness blending amazingly with the hop to form almost a hop candy taste. Good beer, but I'd take the 90 minute over this any day.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,aracauna,3.55,Calling this an I.P.A. is ridiculous. Everything about the flavor says barleywine. It has that characteristic buttery fruit aroma common in barleywines and it was surprisingly not hoppy given the name. Sweet and alcoholic and definitely best in small doses. It was odd to look at it next to the 60 and 90 Minute. The 60 was by far the palest but the 90 seemed just a hair darker than the 120 and had a better head.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

There is a fair amount of lacing left, which is unusual for a 20% brew. The smell is very sweet with the aroma of citrus, flowers, and alcohol. The taste starts a little bitter, then fruitiness in the middle, and just the slightest bit of alcohol on the finish. The mouthfeel is super thick and heavy, much like World Wide Stout, leaving a thin coating over the lips. The drinkability is fairly good for this high-alcohol brew. Something that every great beer lover must try once.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,HonestWeightBeer,3.3,"So, this beer is a monster, 20% ABV. Drank a 750 ml I recieved for my birthday (with no idea of its strength) during a movie (Kafka's The Trial) and standing up was quite the chore...Here it is in it's new incarnation as a 12 oz. bottle.  Pours a hazy orange blond, with a fluffy barely-off-white (yellowish) head, really healthy looking, leaving nice trails. The head reemerges on swirling the glass. Smells very heady (astringent), floral hops, hop resin and sweet alcohol.  Tastes syrupy sweet to start, beyond malty sweetness, hop resin and candy or sugar sweetness. Theres a saturated hop bitterness...then, whoa, the alcohol really takes over (both on the tongue, and in the brain). I don't even taste hops anymore, and being an I.P.A., I have to say ""???"" Even with swirling in the mouth, the hops still take a backseat to the sweetness and heavy alcohol. A burley barleywine, I say, with more than it's share of sweetness.  Mouthfeel is syrupy, sticky, and really lasts on the palate. Please note that any beer after this is water.. save it for a night cap. Drink slowly.  Drinkability, well I don't know what to say, probably best served (as it was at AOBF) in 4 oz. increments.  Realistically, this beer might be too much, maybe it'll mellow a bit with age (says 'Ages Well' on the label). I love DFH, but the 90 minute IPA and the Olde School (barleywine) both do different aspects of this beer, IMO, better than the 120 Minute does itself.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

This beer is pretty bitter, but the huge presence of hops gives it a somewhat sweet taste at some times. It is definitely what I would call and Imperial IPA. It will dry your mouth out quite a bit, but it is still pretty drinkable. The alcohol is there, but not at the lever you would expect for 20%. This is one intense beer, and if you can chew on hops, you will like it.

The aroma is like citrus candy with a faint floral hop bouquet just as you inhale. Because of the high alcohol this candy sweetness dominates the flavor and the drinkablity. There is a small hint of hops flavor at the begining of the sip ( I sipped it ) . The sweetness kept me from rating the ""smell, mouthfeel and drinkability higher.

Smell was spicy and full of cinnemon, cloves, syrup, caramel and esters esters esters. There was a surprising lack of hops present. Taste was heavy. In fact heavier than most Imperial Stouts I have ever had. It was thick, hardly carbonated. This was the closest I will ever come to quafing a whole glass of syrup. It was incredibly sweet, a little sharp, but mostly maple syrup and honey. Hops were almost non-existent. Malts were all this beer was. The alcohol was not necesarily apparent, but it was also not hidden well. Hard to explain. The sweetness seemed to dominate masking the alcohol, but when you sat back and thought about it there was tons there. Drinkabilty? What can I say No one should drink more than one of these. An interesting brew that would be better designated a port or sweet brandy than an IPA. Many thanks to nomad for providing me with this hard to find brew!

The head dies pretty quickly. Aroma: Piney and citrusy. Flavor: In the first sip (and I emphasize sip, don't try gulping this one) you're hit with a sticky, syrupy flavor. It's sweet, but not too sweet. Little tingles of alcohol pop up & tickle your mouth.

Smelled of tons of maris otter malts, syrup, brandy, grapefruit, roses, and tiny hop leaves. Lots going, but mostly toward the sweet side. Taste was of big ass malts, potent alcohol, syrup, and hops that come on only with warming. Unfortunately, the hop flavor was oily and barely bitter. Had some strange creamy but earthy notes too, and also some strange alcohol and hops flavor in the finish. And, a thick and syrupy mouthfeel.

The taste is very sweet. Even with all the hops in there it's hard to hide the sweetness of 20% alcohol. Actually in my opinion, the incredible amount of hops is necessary, otherwise this would probably just taste like vodka. Instead it just tastes like a beer, but it finishes with the warming sensation you get from a shot of whiskey. This is going to be one of beers where some love it, but some hate it. Well I love it.

Not much in the way of hop presence. The flavors here are slightly meady. Brings to mind the 'Midas Touch' (also a Dogfish Head product). Alcohol warming in the middle of the tongue. Must be pretty high in alcohol. Finish is slightly bitter.  Notes: This beer is supposedly 20%abv. The bottle claims that it's prepared for a couple of decades of aging.

Initial taste of pine and sweet malt then the bitterness of the brew creeps from the tip of the tongue to a larger spread of hop bitterness on the back of the tongue. Very smooth mouth with effervecent bubbles swirling around the tongue. Warmth in the stomach after gulping.Definately a sippin' brew. You can't get away from the pine and grapefruit rind bitterness. Very different looking and tasting from the tap version I had in March 2003. Certainly worth a try... not as bitter and hoppy as you would think. It's drinkability is still there for such a monster...,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,IrishRedRock,4.07,"Hooo weee. I have sought, I have found, and now the day hath arri-ved. This is some serious stuff. Pours in a thick fashion, with a golden body and a thick head that disappears very quickly. Very few bubbles cascading to the top. I expected a potent hoppy aroma, but the aroma is rather subtle for such a big beer. It smells not unlike their other IPA's, hoppy and slightly fruity. However, sugar is much more noticeable in this than in the others.  The flavor did not yield the hop overload I had expected either. The alcohol in this young version seems to be the more dominant flavor. Hops are detectable, but I want more! Brown sugar is also very discernible in the flavor, and this finishes thick with a fairly strong alcoholic presence. Although the alcohol is strong, in a blind tasting I never would have guessed as high as 20%. This is highly drinkable for its alcohol potency, but not something I would drink a lot of in a given sitting. Definitely an interesting beer I am glad I picked up though, especially due to the demand for it. What will be more interesting is to see how the other bottle in the cellar turns out after some aging...stay tuned...  ...re-reviewed May 16, 2004...a great way to celebrate my college graduation, with a bottle of 120 that has been in the cellar for almost a year. This brew has smoothed a bit. It's still intensely sweet and alcoholic, however a nicer fruity apple flavor begins to show. When initially poured it showed that it still had some carbonation, but any head was short lived. A random bubble will pop up every now and then, but most traces of carbonation are gone. Although not really hoppy when fresh, it has lost a little more of it's hop flavor, as I would have guessed. Still an enjoyable sipping brew, a tad smoother and easier to drink after nearly a year, and one that should undoubtedly be respected.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Jon,4.15,"IPA? No. Super barleywine? Sure. This beer receives much attention, and rightfully so. This brew pours a golden color with a quickly-fading bubbly white head. Leaves no lace in the glass. Smell is not too far from an IPA with some aroma hops present, although the main draw here is an almost overpowering sweetness. Taste is huge, with a monstrously huge sweet malt flavor with hints of caramel and residual sugar. Hops are hard to pinpoint in the flavor department, but they're certianly around. Finish is oily to be sure, with an alcoholic burn as it goes down. Similar to Dogfish's World Wide Stout, this extreme beer is very drinkable for its overly substantial alcohol content (21% abv), although it's not on my list for continual drinking. If you can locate a bottle and have some funds to part with, I would suggest giving this special brew a try.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Much maltier and hoppier than the 60 Minute version, but this was expected. The malt taste lingers long on the tongue, allowing extra time between tastes. This is an IPA to savor the flavors and drink slowly by itself (not for pairing with food).

10099,9086,purplehops,3.38,"This ale poured a copper brown color with golden highlights and a tight white head that left some lacing on the glass. The aroma was malty sweet with some notes of citrus and a hint of alcohol. The taste started with a rush of malty sweetness and some honey and molasses flavors along with a good slap of alcohol. This was followed by a mellowing of the alcohol and the coming forward of flavors of passion fruit, plums, raisons, and the first hint of citrus and floral hops. The finish had a bit more hop flavor but not enough to override the sweetness of the malt and the power of the alcohol. The aftertaste was warming with a lingering sweetness and fruitiness along with a feeble last attempt of the hops to assert themselves. The mouthfeel was sticky, not quite heavy enough to be called syrup, with a medium heavy body that had some chewiness to it. Overall this was far from what I expected. If I didnt know before hand what this was I would have thought I was drinking a very young barleywine. I would like to lay down a few 750s and try them in a few years to see how this one matures. My hats off to Dogfish for the attempt but I dont think I would call it an IPA (strong dark ale perhaps?).",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,avylover,3.82,"I normally won't review from memory but I had this last night and it was pretty memorable so here goes. It poured a very thick & light gold in color, with very little carbonation. Aroma was very sweet , along with taste, which was heavy on the apricots. Suprisingly the alcohol was masked well. It seems like Dogfish head can mask 20% beers well but fail to mask a 9% beer's alcohol...weird. Anyway, the hops really did'nt make much of an impact until after the beer went down, surfacing after the sweetness had receded in the aftertaste.A very nice mega-hoppy finish.

10099,9086,DrewBeechum,4.1,"Sampled at the Map Room during the AHA NHC Conference.  Well, this was it.. my last brew of the 2003 Chicago Conference.  The beer pours a deep glossy amber and oak in the glass with a dead head that reflects the later density of the brew.  The aroma starts with a bright orange focused aroma with a large alcohol and malt character lurking in the back. (Let's just call him Bruno the Orange. Bruno in many ways resembles EKU 28)  The flavor is big with a dominating burning sense of alcohol with just a touch of hop bitterness in the finish.  As the beer progresses, Bruno tends to fade into the back ground and Penny the Orange County Citrus Queen tends to run forward. The strong alcohol EKUish character does eventually get supplanted by a more Pennyish citrus hop.  Overall, this beer is good, but bewildering. 120 Minute !PA conjures hops during a forbidden tango with trails of wilting would be suitor taste-buds in the background.

Here is one of the finest Imperial IPAs I have come into contact with 120 minutes of continously hopped amber goodness with an off white cream toned short lived head, but at 20% abv it's all good. Aroma contains a plethora off hop tones including those of the floral, pine cone, and citrus (grapefruit) varieties along with one very distinct alcohol nose butterscotch. The taste is strikingly sweet with overly ripened fruit tones apricot and plum notes very nice very hoppy, but amazingly balanced with one hell of a warming effect.

This beer poured a clear copper amber color and formed a huge foamy white head that left laticed lace as it subsided. Very little carbonation is present. An aroma of hops and malt, but surprisingly balanced. I thought the hops would have been more dominating with the usual Dogfish experimenting, but I was wrong. A slight hint of caramel is also present with a touch of pine. The flavor was of malt and hops with a medium caramel like taste with a warm aspect of the alcohol present. The finish was a medium creamy body with a sweet finish and warming alcohol. After Imperials, IPAs are one of my favorites.

This beer poured a dark yellow, orange colour with a nice fluffy white head, that was suprisingly large for a beer with this high of an ABV. The aromas were very complex, port like, syrupy, very fruity, a bit hoppy, boozy, heavily malty, and very sweet and dry. This beer tasted exactly how it smelled, it went down with a warming alcoholic flavor that was mixed in among the other complex flavors noted above. This beer was very similar to the De Dolle Brouers Still Nacht, but it was not as extreme, despite its 20%ABV. The mouthfeel was thick, but not cloying, and the drinkability was very good as well. I split a bottle of this with my friend as well as a bottle of the 90 minute IPA and we were warm for most of the evening. Although next time I will keep the 120 to myself.

The taste is very sweet, with noticeable alcohol, but not like drinking schnapps (which generally has the same ABV). For all the hops, the malt dominates. The mouthfeel is solid, but actually seems lighter than expected. I guess all the alcohol cuts it a bit.

The taste was also fruity, and despite having 120 IBUs wasn't very hoppy at all. The mouthfeel was fairly smooth, and certainly didn't seem to be 21% at all. As for drinkability..........I'd have as many as possible before falling flat on my face!  I've been looking forward to this beer since they announced the release for May 1st, and it didn't disappoint! I called this one ""beer schnapps"" today, and that's the best way to describe this.

The *huge* line put serious doubt into my head that I'd be able to secure an ounce or two of this mysterious concoction. I was very interested to see how this beast of a brew compared to its siblings.  A clear golden color with tightly fizzing bubbles comprising a thin white head. Aromas are of definite sweetness, raw honey, sweet fruits. Barely any notes of bitterness in the aroma. Taste was certainly different than expected. Sweet, bordering on excessive. Virtually no hop influence, barely detectable at the end. Alcohol content surprisingly well-hidden, though. Thick and chewy mouthfeel, with a nice coating effect of the palate. Drinkability was OK due to how sticky sweet it is.  Notes: I had been waiting for this beer ever since it came out, unable to find it in Virginia yet. I am hoping that when I purchase a few bottles and let them sit for a few months that the flavor will soften and be a little better-balanced.

10099,9086,Bierman9,4.38,"Bottle review of 04JAN04. I found a bunch of bottles of 120 at Harringtons today, at $8.95 for a 12oz serving. The color is a rich golden hue, with a suggestion of cloudiness present. Head was creamy and fine, a bit off-white, and lasted as a thin layer well. Lacing was nice as well. The nose was sweet and honey-like. Seemed to be a nice amount of hops lingering in the shadows as well, though the sweetness dominated. The body was well above medium, and the Bier passed velvety across the palate. Silky smooth! The flavor, like the nose, had lots of sweetness, and it was tasty! A bit of toasty malt, honey-ish sweetness, and then some spicy hops round things out. This is a huge mouthful of flavors! And soooo warming, too! The honeylike flavors and richness are almost too much to handle! Is this what mead is like? I am thoroughly enjoying this, but must remind myself to take my time drinking it, lest I find myself on my ass. Not yo Mama's IPA, that's fur sher!! Good stuff!! Zum Wohl!!  overall: 4.4 appearance: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | mouthfeel: 4.5 | drinkability: 4.5  *** ***  On-tap review from 25MAY03. I was able to worm my way through the long queue at the AOBF and scored a couple samples of this. It has a stark copper/golden color, and the head on top is thin, yet finely bubbled. The aroma speaks mostly of sweetness and honey-like characteristics. The body was more than medium, having a nice fullness without being thick. It passed verrry smoothly over the tongue as well. Tasting the 120 produced a lot more sweetness and honey notes, reminding me of a mead. There seemed to be a touch of tropical fruit as well. Upon first sips the hops were very well hidden, yet they did tend to come out of hiding a bit as the bier warmed and gave you a little bite at the end. A very warming bier, to say the least. Though pushing the envelope on being an IPA, I really enjoyed this one. (4.0/4.0/4.5/4.5/4.5 - 4.30) Zum Wohl!!  554",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92

Apricot fruity, with a muzzy haze of hop flavors and aromas all over the place - not really bitter (actually quite sweet and syrupy, but not cloyingly so) but the hops are really trying hard to keep up with all of the lmaltiness going on here. The alcohol strength is extremely well hidden - dangerous. I keep expecting a bitterness to balance the malt, but that's not what this beer is about. There are a lot of floral, citric, and herbal hoppiness behind the malt that make this one well worth quaffing. A bit too big for extensive drinkability - NOT a session beer by any means. But it does work well as an homage to the flavor of hops.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,davidlown,4.38,I bought some from the online source vintage cellar in VA. I just opened a bottle last night and in my opnion it was close to amazing. Nothing like the 24% wws which to me tastes like hard alcohol. The 120 minute actually is not hoppy enough to meet the sweetness but it is damn close to. It is a beautiful beer. Not too carbonated (like most beers that use champagne yeast are). It is actually hard to taste the alcohol. Nothing like earlier reviews from people who tasted the keg and said it was spoiled or too thick or gooky. This beer looks beautiful and professional and it is a joy to taste. I guess this beer proves the theory that at a certain point hops can get more flavorful or bitter in a beer because it still wasn't enough for me. Great job Dogfish.,Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,sprinkle,4.28,"This beer had a deep golden color, with a viscous of a fine dessert wine. Nice lace because it just clings not to carbonated but suites me fine. Not too big on the aroma but still nice. Mouthfeel of a belgian with the sweetness which tapers down the high hops this has in it. It is amazing that this beer is so well balanced for 20.04% abv. This is definately one of the best put together extreme beers on the market.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,BeerResearcher,3,"Nothing subtle about this IPA, or for that matter, any Dogfish brew. Deep cloudy gold with white foamy and fizzy head and plenty of sticky doily type lace. The aroma is mostly strong hops with a blast of alcohol. A medium amount of sweet doughy malt and very highly hopped with strong metallic and grapefruit peel bitterness. An In-Your-Face-Strong, wild and raw tasting brew. Oh! Little tiny bits and particles of interest.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,Denali,2.38,"On tap at Blind Tiger Ale House in New York City.  Appearance: Looked like apricot juice. No head.  Smell: Strong and very sweet peach and apricot aroma. Could not detect any alcohol in the aroma.  Taste: Extremely sweet peach and apricot flavors. Some hops were also tasted. Could not taste any malt. Just too sweet and not balanced, like it was not fully fermented. Despite its strength, I could not taste any alcohol (probably overpowered by the sweet flavors).  Mouthfeel: Syrupy with light carbonation.  Drinkability: Was way too sweet for me to be able to finish the glass I had.  Comments: I had been looking forward to this beer for months, since I like 90 Minute IPA a lot. However, this was disappointing. Maybe if they let it age it might help.",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
10099,9086,scottum,2.43,"That's a strong brew! Hazy orange amber with a big white head. The 21% is apparent in taste and quick buzz. Hops are big enough to cover most of the strong alcohol flavor. This beer is still young so there is hope yet. Right now, this beer is just too big for itself. Not as good as the 60 and 90 minute versions. bleh",Dogfish Head Craft Brewery,"Delaware, United States",Imperial IPA,92
